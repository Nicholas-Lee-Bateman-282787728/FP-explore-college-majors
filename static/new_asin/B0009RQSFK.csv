2313945,5,B0009RQSFK,"Its' often been said that, ever since Vince Mcmahon destroyed the mainstream territories (WCW, and the already financially-crippled ECW), many fans felt the time had come to abandon the WWF, without comepetition, there was no diversity, no preferred promotions, and without motivation, the WWF has been reduced to a hit-and-miss mess plauged by political manipulators like Triple H, and forced to change it's name to satsify the World Wildlife Funds.

Whilst WWE occasionly still manages to bring out a great PPV here and there, a long term goal on thier part has yet to be accomplished: To grab the attention of an IMMENSE worldwide audience, and not just thier loyal fanbase.

Then, in 2005, Rob Van Dam proposed an ECW reunion PPV to follow the immesnly sucessful sales of ""The Rise And Fall of ECW"", the result? The most entertaining WWE funded event in YEARS.

ECW One Night Stand reunited most of the original stars of ECW (minus Terry Funk, Shane Douglas, and Raven, arguably three of the greatest wrestlers and draws in the companys' history), and even managed to accomplish the unbeleivlble and restore Joey Styles to commentary, alongside hardcore legend Mick ""Cactus Jack"" Foley.

The event, featuring surpise finishes, unbeleivible shoot promos from Rob Van Dam and Paul Heymen, and a main event brawl which included the return to the states of burning tables, completly outperformed the promotion that funded it, a promotion whose main PPV attractions range from Chris Masters' masterlock challenge filling up ten minutes, and Diva segments filling up five, and Triple H in the main event as usual. ECW One Night Stand was a tribute to a truly exciting and innovative diversion from the same ratings-sapping garbage we've come to expect from the WWE, a company now, in DIRE need of examnining itself.

Lance Storm defeated Chris Jericho: **, a short, yet enthrallnig wrestling match between Jericho and the former Impact Player, Storm puts on a credible performance, and aid from Justin Credible ensures he wins the match.

Super Crazy defeated Tajiri and Little Gu=ido (Nunzio): ***1/2, another short match, but far above any cruserweight encoutner on SMACKDOWN, Super Crazy took more than a handful of risks in the match, even moonsaluting off of a balcony in the ballroom.

Rey Mysterio vs Psychosis: **, Rey and Psychossi played it safe here, Rey's recent leg injury however didn't hamper much of the action that followed, look out for Psychosis' leg drop off the top rope onto Rey proned on the steel barricade, Rey wins with a 619 (Not a finsiher he had performed in ECW, hence why the New York Crowd boos him)

Chris Benoit defeated Eddie Guerrero: ***, match of the night so far, another criminally short, but enthrallnig encounter,m Benoit wins with the crossface

Following this, Rob Van Dam emerges and cuts a scathing promo on his WWE Chracter, Rhyno speares him, setting yup a match with Sabu

Sabu defeated Rhyno: ***1/2, a great match, which revived expectations from the legendary Sabu, Rhyno was out to prove something tonight, as he pulled all the stops, even a pildriver, before Rob Van Dam interfered, giving Sabu enough time to hit a legdrop onto a table to defeat the ex-WWE employee

Mike Awesome defeated Tanaka: ****, say what you want about Awesome, but he redeemed himself in more than one way as he and Tanaak put on a ferocious powerbomb-ridden encounter with many near falls, broken tables, and broken bodies, Awesome awesome bomba Tanaka through a table followed by a diving head butt to the outside to pin him.

Heyemen then emerged to cut his own promo, acknowledging the fans for restoring ECW, turning his attention to Edge, Heymen only had two words for him: MATT-FREAKING-HARDY (Edge tries to disguise his complete decimation by insisting Heymen said three words), confirming the REAL person who suffered from Edges; affair with Lita behind the scenes. He also went the distance in confirming J.B.L was only champion for a year because ""Hunter didn't want to work Tuesdays""

The Dudley Boyz defeated Tommy Dreamer and The Sandman: Not a five star classic in terms of wrestling, but TEN STARS for being the main reason WWE main event currently suck, the crowd singing The Sadmans' entrace theme to the ring, Sandman swallowing beer from fellow ECW Divas' chest areas, cameos from Kid Kash and the Blue World Order,  Tommys' former girlfreind Buela returning and helping him to double DDT The Dudleyz, and the return of the flaming tables, which the Dudleyz used to destroy Dreamer and pin him to win the match.

Following this was a short brawl between ECW and WWE led by Stone Cold Steve Austin, with WWE being destroyed in a matter of seconds, Kurt Angle being choked into submission by Tazz, and Eric Bischoff left to the mercy of the very promotion whose talents he raided to keep WCW fresh and innovative.

Although each match was quite short, not ONE was actually bad, the excitment and entertainment was everlasting, when have we seen this in WWE for a long time? Even Wrestlemania doesn't hold a candle to this gem, this reminder of what we used to watch. This not the WWE, nor is it WCW, or RAW, or SMACKDOWN, this is consistent, non-stop WRESTLING, this is E-C-F'ING-W",1118707200,5,5227,4.916004540295119

2313954,5,B0009RQSFK,"After seeing both Hardcore Homecomings and a few other ECW reunions I decided to check this out for the cheap price of $3.97 on ebay. It's obviously more well produced and put together due to the WWE having a huge budget, but the wrestling is straight up old school ECW. The only people they could have added to make it even better was Raven, Jerry Lynn, and New Jack to name a few. But otherwise they covered all their bases pretty well. Every match is fast and hardcore on top of that. There are a few times where Paul E. and Joey Styles shed a few tears because they seem very touched that even though ECW eventually failed it still lives on in the fans and wrestlers.  RVD and Paul do amazing promos in the ring, and every match is just plain explosive. My only qualm is the WWE guys throwing in some stupid story line and sitting in the audience and arguing with the ECW guys here and there. I also believe the end fight between WWE/ECW is the incident where JBL and Blue Meanie had some actual back stage heat due to the Meanie saying JBL was a bully on the radio. So during said ""fight"" JBL decides to actually punch the Blue Meanie and not hold back, he ends up a bit of a bloody mess and opens up his stitches which he had just gotten after the Hardcore Homecoming Reunion show. If you are or were an ECW fan you will love this PPV where WWE actually did the right thing. Unlike the One Night Stand PPVs that follow this 2005 one which I wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole. If you are a WWE or wrestling fan in general and never watched ECW it's an amazing show you will love, but you will most likely appreciate it more if you were an old school ECW fan who knows the wrestlers and feuds etc.. Check it out!",1290556800,,1718,4.174698795180723
2313955,5,B0009RQSFK,"One of the best non-major WWE PPV shows of 2005. The best matches were The Mike Awesome-Masato Tanaka match which stole the whole show and the tag team main event between The Dudley Boy against the team of The Sandman & Tommy Dreamer which was one of the most hardcore matches of all of 2005 and even the 2000's. The match between Rey Misterio Jr & Psychosis was not great but pretty good and the same goes for the Eddie Guerrero-Chris Benoit match. The rest were OK. The only downside to this PPV is that all the matches last about 6 to 10 minutes long. Other then that,it's still a fun PPV to see. I give this event a 9 and a half out of 10.",1277251200,,643,4.111111111111111
2313956,5,B0009RQSFK,"""ECW: One Night Stand"" was, without a doubt, the best pay-per-view of 2005 (as was its successor in 2006). This go-round, however, featured strictly old ECW talent in New York's Hammerstein Ballroom. Some of them were working for the WWE at the time, but they all had their roots (and their fanbase) in ECW. Featuring instant-classic matches from technical superstars Lance Storm and Chris Jericho and veritable wrestling clinics from the now-deceased duo of Eddie Guerrero and Chris Benoit to the high-flying antics of Super Crazy, this is ECW as it was at its peak. Paul Heyman and Rob Van Dam (among others) make in-ring appearances before a very enthusiastic crowd and the atmosphere is as charged as it ever was for the fans. If you're a wrestling fan, young or old, you're bound to find something on this DVD that you'll enjoy.",1251072000,,833,4.8321678321678325
2313957,5,B0009RQSFK,"Chris Jericho vs. Lance Storm
Good match here. A lot of technical wrestling. Submissions, suplexes, and counters and much more. Lance Storm pulling off the win with Dawn Marie distracting the ref and allowing Justin credible to hit Jericho from behind with the kendo stick
Match rating:7.5/10

Three Way Dance-Super crazy vs. Little Guido vs. Tajiri
This match is great. Three high flyers and a great match. Super crazy did great and pulled off the win when it came down to him and Tajiri. Super crazy pulled off 6 moonsaults, including one off the balcane onto the entire FBI. Great match here, but a little short.
Match rating:8.5/10

Sabu vs. Rhino
This match is good, but way to short. Sabu pretty much beat the heck out of Rhino, and won with a legdrop through a table for the win. Also, RVD got involved and hit Rhino with the van terminator.
Match rating:6/10

Extreme Luchadore action-Rey Mysterio vs. Psicosis
This a match worth watching. This match has great high flying moments where Psicosis does a leg drop on Mysterio on the Barricade. But, this match had some slow move moments which gave the match a different twist. But even though Rey was injured. I still give him props for pulling off the win with a 619 and west coast pop.
Match rating:7.25/10

Eddie Guerrero vs. Chris Benoit
Pretty good match here. Like Jericho/storm earlyier, this match had tons of technical wrestling. But Benoit pulled off the win with the cross face after Eddie missed a frog splash. Good moments in this match like when a chair came into play.
Match rating:8/10

Masato Tanaka vs. Mike Awesome
This is defenatly match of the night. Three tables and about 4 chairs were used in this match. Great part in the match were Mike does a Awesome bomb outside and through a table and nerely breaks Tanakas neck. Also, the ddt through the table by Tanaka from the second rope and then Mike Awesome winning with a Awesome bomb through another table and then doing a splash on Tanaka for the win.
Match rating:10/10

Then Paul Hayman comes down to the ring and cuts a funny promo. He attacked edge, jbl, and eric bishoff. ""Hey guys, hide your wives, its edge."" and ""JBL, you were champion for a year because triple h didn't want to work on tuesdays.""

Tommy Dreamer and Sandman vs. The Dudelys
Great match here. Funny moments when the BWO came out and when Spike came out. But this match is very brutal and has a lot of weapons like, trash cans, signs, tables, and a kendo stick and a cheese grader, also, a ladder. Awesome moment at the end when Tommy Dreamer went through a flaming table. There were about 2 tables in that match. Great match here.
Match rating:9.5/10

Awesome moment at the end when Stone cold comes out and starts a brawl between ECW and wwe. Funny moment when Eric bishoff gets a 3d, flying headbut, 619 and a stunner. My favorite moment in the brawl, was when snitsky went through a table.
Brawl Rating:20/10

I recomend adding this to your wwe collection. Thanks for reading and please comment and rate.",1248912000,4,3010,4.632270168855535
2313958,4,B0009RQSFK,"By popular demand, ECW returned in 2005 for their first PPV since 2000. This PPV is definitely one of the bests from the 2005 year.

The show starts out with the introduction of the voice of ECW, Joey Styles. As you will see, Styles gets a little teary eyed and choked up. After his introduction, Styles would then introduce his fellow broadcast partner for the evening in the ""Hardcore Legend"" Mick Foley. Throughout the PPV you will see many classic ECW moments from a particular ECW era. You will also see special appearences from ECW alumni including Rob Van Dam, the BWO, Bill Alfonso, Balls Mahoney, Al Snow, Spike Dudley, Paul Heyman, and others. Also the invasion from the Smackdown superstars led by J.B.L. and Kurt Angle and also from RAW led by Eric Bischoff.

""Lionheart"" Chris Jericho vs. Lance Storm w/ Dawn Marie
Fantastic opening match up. Jericho got some cheers during his entrance when he came out in his classic ECW ""Lionheart"" attire. Storm didn't look rusty at all and along with Jericho, these two put on a great match with non-stop action throughout. This match was also definitely one of Jericho's best wrestling performances during this period in recent time before his departure in August. The ending led to the reunion of the Impact Players among Justin Credible and Lance Storm. Terrific wrestling match. 4.75/5

Three Way Dance
Super Crazy vs. Tajiri vs. Little Guido (Nunzio)
A very quick and fast paced match up here. Tajiri was accompanied by Mikey Whipwreck and Sinister Minister (James Mitchell from TNA) while Little Guido was accompanied by fellow members of the F.B.I. who all interfered at some point during the match. Some crazy moves to check out here such as Super Crazy moonsaulting off the balcony onto the members of the F.B.I. Nothing really ""OH MY GOD"" here besides the leap from the balcony. Still a great lucha libre three way dance. 4.25/5

Psichosis vs. Rey Mysterio
Mysterio was working with a bad ankle here but he did everything he could to keep the match going and interesting. The fans BOOed Psichosis after he unmasked. The match was really stucked to the mat besides two dives from Mysterio and Psichosis. One with Psichosis scoring with a leg drop from the top rope to Rey who was leaning over the guard rail and the other with Rey hitting his senton bomb to Psichosis from the top rope into the crowd. But not much happening here besides that. 3.75/5

Right here is where Joel Gertner tries to interview the Smackdown superstars but would only get shoved right down on his a** by Kurt Angle. This soon leads to a special appearence by RVD with Fonzie by his side. RVD tells how he gave the idea for One Night Stand and also how not wrestling at ONS sucked more then not wrestling at Wrestlemania 21. After a while this leads to Rhyno coming out and hitting the Gore to RVD which would then lead to...

Sabu vs. Rhyno
The only problem with this match that it was too short. Rhyno and Sabu brought some good intensity to the match which added more. This was a classic Sabu match as you see Sabu using a steel chair for innovative types of moves. Ends with RVD getting retribution with a steel chair and Sabu dropping a leg drop to Rhyno through a table. For what it was worth, Sabu and Rhyno delivered a solid ECW match up. 4/5

Chris Benoit vs. Eddie Guerrero
Benoit and Guerrero didn't bring their A game to this match which was a disappointment. Guerrero was in his ""I can't beat Rey"" heel mode instead bringing that classic Eddie Guerrero ECW style to the match. Benoit and Eddie still put on a great back and forth match up but you can see it wasn't their best. This match was more WWE style then ECW but still a pretty good contest between these two wrestling generals. 4/5

Mike Awesome vs. Masato Tanaka
You better get ready to say ""HOLY S***"" because thats exactly what this match brought. Not a bloody war but it was just violently brutal. Tanaka takes some of the most hardest steel chair shots ever along with some brutal crashes through tables but still came back fighting strong. This match displays the action ECW truly brought back in the day. Just an out of this world match. Match of the night right here. 5/5 [Match also available on Bloodsport: ECW's Most Violent Matches]

The Dudley Boyz vs. Tommy Dreamer & The Sandman
These four didn't hold anything back in this one. After the run-ins by the BWO, Balls Mahoney & Axl Rock, & Kid Kash, Bubbah Ray and DeVon along with Dreamer and Sandman put on a great main event. But this match was basically your classic ECW extreme rules match up where you see blood, chairs, ladders, and a cheese grater. After Beulah came out to take out Francine and her reunion with Tommy Dreamer, little Spike Dudley came out to set a table on fire to end the match with a flaming table finish to Dreamer by Bubbah Ray and DeVon. 4.5/5

The conclusion to the show is Stone Cold Steve Austin coming out to call down the superstars from Smackdown and RAW for an A** Whoopin' from the ECW Originals. This eventually led to Eric Bischoff being thrown out of the Hammerstein Ballroom with the ECW alumni celebrating their ""One Night Stand.""

I recommend purchasing One Night Stand. This PPV is definitely one of the bests from 2005.",1240617600,2,5234,4.605150214592275

2313960,4,B0009RQSFK,"After the success of the ""Rise And Fall Of ECW"" & by popular demand, ECW gets one night to showcase why it is a promotion that is truely missed by all wrestling fans around the world. The result was one of the best PPVs of 2005.

At the start of the show, Joey Styles made his introduction & by the look on his face, was very emotional & happy to be there. From there, we found out that his co-commentator for the night would be none other than hardcore legend, Mick Foley.

Chris Jericho vs Lance Storm w/Dawn Marie. This was Lance Storm's retirement match while Jericho came out in his original ""Lionheart"" gimmick while it was always great to see Dawn at ringside. Great opener with non-stop action between these two as they had the best pure ""wrestling"" match of the night with an ending that lead to the reunion of the Impact Players.

ECW Remembers. A video package acknowleding those who had passed away featuring Rocco Rock, Pitbull #2, Chris Candido, Terry Gordy & others.

Super Crazy vs Tajiri vs Little Guido. If you know your ECW history, you know that anytime that these three have a chance to battle, you are in for a quality match & this was no exception. One thing to point out, it was nice to see all of the member of the F.B.I. along with Sinister Minister & Mikey Whipwreck returning with Tajiri. Anyways, a great match between these three with one moment to look out for being the awesome balcony spots that really shows how insane Super Crazy really is.

Rey Mysterio vs Psichosis. Before I begin, I want to mention that Psichosis came out with his mask on but then took it off which lead to some chants demanding for him to put his mask back on. This match didn't come close to their previous ECW matches but this was a nice match to watch considering that it appeared that Mysterio was injured during this match with highlights being Psichosis dropping a leg drop from the top rope while Mysterio was hanging on the railing & the crowd booing Mysterio for doing his WWE finisher.

This was the time where the SmackDown invaders lead by Kurt Angle & J.B.L. arrived & not only beat up Joel Gertner but also got an expected negative reaction. From there, it lead to Rob Van Dam returning with Bill Alfonso to deliver a shoot promo about the idea of One Night Stand, how he would rather being competing at ONS than WrestleMania, how he was booked in WWE along with Fonzie saying how long RVD was the Television Champion...which lead to Rhyno attacking RVD that lead to...

Sabu vs Rhyno...this match as this was the best performance that I have seen from Rhyno in a long time as he resembled his old ECW self while Sabu deserves much respect from being injured from his Barbed Wire Match the week before & not letting it affect his performance. With cameos from RVD & Fonzie along with the usual chair & table spots that you get in a Sabu match, this match really delivered & was a nice retro moment.

Chris Benoit vs Eddie Guerrero. Eddie came out in his heel persona instead of the ECW version of Guerrero. I might be in the minority but I didn't see a classic as this was a good wrestling match between these two but something felt off about this match that I just can't put my finger on it as I have seen both men do way better than this.

Mike Awesome vs Masato Tanaka. This match right here alone shows you the true value of what ECW was all about as these two stole the show here. Anytime that you see Awesome vs Tanaka, you will get some of the intense battles in professional wrestling history & this was no exception. They went high impact right from the start till the end not holding back on anything with sick chair & table spots along the way that include Awesome ""awesome-bombing"" Tanaka from the apron through a table, Tanaka smashing one chair onto another one that was on Awesome's face & the finish that was worthy of the chants it got.

Paul Heyman came out next to give his thanks to the fans that made this event possible before cutting a shoot to the Invaders, specifically Edge (MATT FREAKING HARDY), Eric Bischoff (UR IN OUR HOUSE, BITCH) & J.B.L. (THE ONLY REASON YOU WERE WWE CHAMPION FOR A YEAR IS BECAUSE TRIPLE H DIDN'T WANT WORK TUESDAYS).

Tommy Dreamer & The Sandman vs The Dudley Boyz. Unfortunately, WWE removed ""Enter Sandman"" & replaced it with the same generic music that was used for the Sandman on the ECW DVD while the Dudleys had their theme edited out for their old 2002 version. Before the match got underway, there was a special appearance from the bWo, Kid Kash, Balls Mahoney & Axl Rotten that lead to Balls hitting Nova in the head with a chair to the point that Joey Styles said ""That's more painful than being Simon Dean on Mondays"" which caused me to stop the DVD since I couldn't help but laugh at that comment. This match was what you expected it to be as it was a hardcore bloodbath with everyone was a bloody mess & using various weapons like pans, a cheese grater & a flaming table along with more appearances from Spike Dudley, the Impact Players, the returns of Francine & Beulah (who are always worth watching).

In the end, Stone Cold Steve Austin made an unexpected return & called out the WWE invaders which lead to a big brawl between the ECW locker room & the WWE invaders with moments like Taz choking out Kurt Angle, J.B.L. going straight to the Blue Meanie, & Eric Bischoff getting beaten up by Austin, Rey Mysterio, Dudley Boyz, Mick Foley & Chris Benoit before being thrown out of the building to a bear bash to end the show.

DVD extras include comments from the fans before the event, all the commericals & superstar spotlights, highlights from the ECW funeral on RAW & a ""JBL alternative commentary"" feature in which JBL was wired throughout the event & you just hear the comments from him & those around him.

Overall, like I said earlier, this was one of the best shows of 2005 with one ironic moment being that due to the success of this show, WWE stacked their Vengeance PPV to make sure that their event would be the better of the two (Thanks for the insight, DP).",1231977600,,6061,4.443744374437443
2313961,5,B0009RQSFK,"The Rebirth of ECW is HERE!!!!!

This PPV started the rumbling of bringing back ECW and doing something different with an at the time slightly stale WWE. This PPV brought back the heroes that all TRUE EC Dubbers have loved for so long with the exception of Raven, Bam Bam Bigelow, Shane Douglas and Chris Candido who unfortunately passed away a few months prior to the event.

This PPV has some of the best matches I think of 2005 and in general, the last 5 years. There are truly no slow or uninteresting points of this PPV (with a few bad exchanges during the Mysterio v Psychosis match and in true ECW fashion, the crowd lets them know). There are even spots of classic ECW moments. And the promo by Rob Van Dam is absolutely classic. And there's even a small vignette dedicated to some of the fallen heroes of ECW like Chris Candido, Crash Holly, Terry Gordy and Pitbull 2.

The matches are amazing! Thank God for Hardcore wrestling! The matches in this PPV were all very well done and even though not all of the matches had the hardcore element (tables, chairs, frying pans, barbed wire, thumb tacks and.... Cheese graters????) the actual wrestling matches were great.

Here is the match list:
Lance Storm w/ Dawn Marie v ""Lionheart"" Chris Jericho (NOT Y2J, but Lionheart. If you don't know what that is, you need to get your forehead kicked in for not being a true wrestling fan)
Three Way Dance
Super Crazy v Tajiri w/ Mikey Whipwreck and Sinister Minister v Lil Guido w/ the FBI

Rey Mysterio v Psychosis

RVD promo that leads into.... Sabu v Rhyno

Eddie Guerrero v Chris Benoit, just like the Storm/Jericho match this is straight up WRESTLING at its best. Most people forget how good the actual wrestling was in ECW so here's a great shot of how it was.

Mike Awesome v Masato Tanaka, this match alone STEALS the show. An amazing rematch of 2 former ECW Champions and even as the Judas of ECW, Awesome still comes out and gives a great match. And Tanaka is impressive as always.

Paul Heyman promo, funny stuff in this one

Tommy Dreamer and Sandman v The Dudley Boyz, this match gets crazy from the jump start with interruptions from the bWo, Balls Mahoney and Axl Rotten and Kid Ka$h. One thing that is kinda annoying about this match is that originally Sandman comes out to Metallica's ""Enter Sandman"". On the DVD, they use a pretty basic theme song. I see that a lot of people are bothered by that and I can understand why because it showed what ECW was all about. A bond between wrestlers and their fans and that gets lost slightly without the real music. HOWEVER, in the same light I don't see anyone complaining that RVD didn't come out to Pantera's ""Walk"". Just putting it out there.

All in all, this is a great DVD. You can call it what you want, you either like it or you don't. If you are a true ECW fan, you will love this PPV. And if you're a whiny John Cena loving non-wrestling fan, you won't understand it so put it down and don't even try. I would definitely suggest this DVD to all REAL wrestling fans but you should also pick up The Rise and Fall of ECW and Bloodsport: ECW's Bloodiest Matches.",1216857600,,3124,4.444055944055944

2313964,4,B0009RQSFK,"As is typical with ECW One Night Stand (I also got 2006), it's a showcase of some of the best of ECW with the production values of WWE.  The athletes return for one night and we get to see them do what they do best.

The likes of Yoshohiro Tajiri, Mikey Whipwreck, Little Guido, and Super Crazy (pre-WWE) are astounding athletes, all of whom save Whipwreck have been criminally underused during their stints in WWE.

Showstopping matches are the likes of Rey Mysterio vs Psicosis (who removes his mask as a show of respect to the fans), Tommy Dreamer and Sandman vs The Dudley Boyz, and Eddie Guerrero (rest his soul) vs Chris Benoit.

It's the flaws in the event that bring this otherwise stellar showcase of talent that is sadly lacking in today's professional wrestling down a star.  For one, some superstars' original music apparently couldn't be paid for, and so instead of ""Enter Sandman"", you get some random generic rock song (was also used in Rise and Fall of ECW DVD when covering Sandman).  Me, who has never seen Sandman enter to ""Enter Sandman"" was disappointed at not being able to experience the event.  Other superstars' music, while I'm not sure if it is edited generic music or not, certainly sounds that way.  Tajiri's entrance music sounds very cheaply done, like a single person in the back with a tambourine and a keyboard, and Balls Mahoney's music, whether or not it is his original music, and though still the same melody as his current music, sounds like it is done by someone backstage on a single guitar with a 12 inch amplifier (ie, the really cheap ones you buy for like 60 dollars when starting a band).

Another irritating event is the presence of WWE Superstars in the top balconies looking smug at the ECW superstars, and their not-funny and not-entertaining events with them tormenting Joel Gertner or saying ""ECW sucks"" or whatever.

The end also seemed a bit of a trashy way to end, with all the ECW superstars (including some who didn't compete for the PPV) and all the WWE superstars crowding the ring and having a pillow-strike brawl, while Eric Bischoff is stunned by Stone Cold Steve Austin (helping ECW guys) and whose last words before being dragged away by the Dudleys, ""F*** ECW!""

All in all, the matches were great, but it has some flaws which could have been averted.  Not as good as ECW One Night Stand 2006, but definitely a great event.",1173139200,,2388,4.65952380952381
2313965,4,B0009RQSFK,"ECW One Night Stand 2005 was probably the best iteration of ECW we the fans are ever likely to get from Vince McMahon, and as history as proven, it was more of a lucky strike than a harbinger of success to come. There are some truly great matches on this DVD, and I'd suggest buying it if for no other reason than to see the late Eddie Guerrero (who wrestles Chris Benoit), and the late Mike Awesome (who steals the show along with longtime partner in crime Masato Tanaka) tear up the ring one last time. Both men will be missed, and even if these were not their absolute finest matches, they ARE still better than 99% of what you'll find on RAW or Smackdown lately.

The angle with RAW and SMACKDOWN invading the PPV does kinda interrupt the flow, and yes, portions of the DVD are edited for crowd profanity, and bizarrely, The Sandman's theme (Vince will hand a fake-breasted talentless bimbo $250,000, but can't pony up the cash for Metallica's ""Enter Sandman"" ? WTF is up with that?) but aside from that, I do think this DVD belongs in any self respecting wrestling fan's library, if for no other reason than pure nostalgia.

Recommended for ECW fans, and hardcore wrestling fans. All casual wrestling fans would do well to avoid this, and all fans looking for a glimpse of the ""true"" ECW (if you've never actually experienced it) would do well to seek out Pioneer's ECW DVDs.",1172361600,2,1380,4.538152610441767
2313966,4,B0009RQSFK,"The first One Night Stand produced by WWE was more of a tribute to the old ECW unlike the second ONS. All of the old fans of ECW will not be dissappointed with this dvd. All of the old nostagalic touches from the old ECW pay-per-views are in place. The pay-per-view takes place in the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City, a place that is only topped in its importance to ECW by the ECW Arena in Philadelphia, ECW's birthplace.

The matches start off kind of slow then pick up later on. Chris Jericho takes on Lance Storm with a surprise reunion of the Impact Players. Chris Benoit takes on Eddie Guerrerro (R.I.P) in a mat-based ""wrestling"" match with no weapons. Rey Mysterio takes on Psicosis with some nice high-flying action. I almost forgot about the "" Raw & Smackdown Crusade/Invasion of the ppv. There are some funny segments with JBL, Kurt Angle, and Eric Bischoff with the other wrestlers. Paul Heyman comes out a completely disses Edge, JBL, and Bischoff. The pay-per-view starts to get goof though when the main ECW guys takeover. An injured Rob Van Dam does a promo about how he wants so bad to wrestle at this ppv then is viciously attacked by the man-beast Rhino. This causes Sabu to come to RVD's aid and a match takes place between Rhino and Sabu. The real showstealer of the night has to be Masato Tanaka vs. Mike Awesome, this match alone is worth buying the dvd. There is alot of chair shots and people being put through tables(mostly Tanaka). Plus Joey Styles shoots on Mike Awesome leaving ECW for WCW while he was Heavyweight Champ. The main event is the Sandman and Tommy Dreamer vs. The Dudley Boys. This match is the best when it comes to straight-up garbage wrestling. Alot of weapons, blood, and violence!! And even appearances by Little Spike Dudley, Beaulah, and Francine. And someone gets put through a flaming table.  At the end of the match the Sandman tells somebody to get him a beer after all the mayhem and none other than Stone Cold Steve Austin comes out and says he wants to see a fight. Then the WWE and ECW stars face-off in the ring and an all out brawl breaks out. The ECW stars win and have their revenge on Eric Bischoff who after taking a beating screams "" F*** ECW"" and is given the Stone Cold Stunner. He is then thrown out of the building by the Dudley Boys and all the ECW stars celebrate with a beer-bash!!!

2313967,5,B0009RQSFK,"I never thought I'd say this in my entire life, but I could kiss Paul Heyman for bringing back ECW with such a splash!  A lot of my old favorites were there -- Tommy Dreamer,the late Eddie Guerrero, Chris Jericho, Mick Foley, and Stone Cold Steve Austin, to name a few -- and they brought the roof down at the Hammerstein Ballroom with their high-flying, dangerous antics on this, their first night back together in years.

Aside from the fact that I can watch it over and over again if I want, the most appealing thing about the One Night Stand DVD is that it's chock full of extras.  More matches, backstage interviews, promo footage from the wrestlers -- you name it, and this DVD's got plenty of it.  ECW One Night Stand is most definitely not for kids or the faint of heart, but it's a fun ride!",1151884800,,800,4.348993288590604
2313968,5,B0009RQSFK,"One Night Stand was a fantastic PPV. Now we know they eventually would go on to do a second One Night Stand in 2006 and ECW is revived for the time being on the Sci-Fi channel. This PPV was special because some of these guys thought it really would be the last time they wrestled in an ECW ring. This was a final ""thank you"" to the fans and everyone who loved ECW and worked to make it successful. They did a fantastic job.

A lot of people did a great rundown of the matches, so I will spare that here. I thought they were all solid, some better than others. The last match with the Dudleys, Sandman (not coming out to Enter Sandman, which was weird)  and Tommy Dreamer was awesome. Beulah, Francine, the BWO and a few others make appearances throughout the match and this one was for the hardcore fans of ECW. Francine looked great and I was glad to see they had her in the show, even though Shane Douglas refused to be at the event.

We see that a few wrestlers were in less than ring shape, most obvious was the Sandman, sporting a huge beer gut (although he probably put on one of his best performances ever). A few wrestlers missing that were true ECW were Raven, Terry Funk, Shane Douglas, and New Jack. Still, the show came off solid and it was very well done by WWE. I never really liked the WWE stamp on the ECW stuff and they basically allowed this to be true ECW.

I think ECW showed they can appeal to a broad audience with a good mix of wrestling, hot girls, blood, tables, chairs, ladders, and more blood. Definitely worth owning for any wrestling fan and a ""must have"" DVD for the ECW fans out there. Maybe the best wrestling event I have ever watched, it was really fun.

Other good DVDs were Rise and Fall of ECW and Forever Hardcore.",1151539200,,1752,4.2492492492492495
2313969,5,B0009RQSFK,"This was the long awaited return of the most revolutionary wrestling promotion in the wrestling business ECW, but it was under the wing of the WWE which alot of people had their doubts about but let me tell you Vince made a good move in letting Heyman produce and book this entire show because it delivered everything we expected.

""Lionheart"" Chris Jericho vs Lance Storm W/ Dawn Marie

Very good match with some great holds & smooth action that no old school WWE fan will of ever see. This match was a true display of what ECW was and that was unscripted and unplanned action.

Three Way Dance match. Tajiri vs Little Guido vs Supercrazy. Lots of fast paced action and this is a basic re-creation of a match that was back in 1999, must say it was good then and it was good now. Plus this had a very good high spot.

Psicosis vs Rey Misterio Jr. This match was a serious let down because i have seen numerous matches between these 2 from their days in mexico and in old ECW with their mexican death match & This match was below them all.

Psicosis tried a different style in this match that we're used to seeing but we didn't want something new from this PPV we wanted something that we can say ""Oh Yeah That match was better this time around.

RVD comes out to a huge reaction as he is due to do a shoot promo on WWE and lemme tell ya this promo made an impact on RVD's entire future wrestling career. RVD was injured on this night but was still accompanied by his long time manager Bill 'Fonzie' Alfonso. RVD trashed the WWE for scripting him and making him out to be a weak guy who just said chill all the time. After this promo WWE never put a script to RVD again and quite possibly if Rob hadn't said the words he did he wouldn't be WWE champion today.

Rhyno vs Sabu Unscheduled match but was a very hard hitting match and i was glad to see that Sabu had showed up and wrestled because i am a big fan of Sabu's

Chris Benoit vs Eddie Guerrero (RIP Eddie) 2 Amazing veteran wrestlers go at it in a classic bout that was also a great match but that was to be expected, the only problem i had with this match is that Eddie was using his WWE heel persona when he should of just been himself

Mike Aweome vs Masato Tanaka. This match was the most Extreme match of the night as Masato Tanaka easily the toughest wrestler alive was driven through about 4 tables, had his head smashed by chaird over 10 times and the guy still kept getting up.

Amazing match with a really cool ending.

Dudleyz vs Tommy Dreamer & Sandman This match was cool too and Tommy, Sandman & the Dudleys really put alot in this match but there where so many interuptions during the match that it started to get annoying. Still very violent and really exciting all the same

The end of the PPV saw ECW standing tall against WWE and that was a pretty cool moment as the ECW guys got to do what they always wanted and that was to beat the crap out of Eric Bischoff",1150329600,,2935,4.212121212121212
2313970,5,B0009RQSFK,"When I heard that ECW was coming back full-blown and in its entirety I knew I had to review the best ECW show ever put on, and without a doubt one of the best PPV's put on under WWE's name

Lance Storm vs. Chris Jericho - One of the best openers I have ever seen, these two just mesh so well, and that's mader completely obvious when you watch this the two dropkick spots are great but the ending makes you feel like you've been cheated 8/10

Super Crazy vs. Little Guido vs. Tajiri - Excellent way to follow up the opener there are spots galore in this m atch with the top one obviously being Crazy's balcony moonsault this match has a lot of run-in's but that doesn't hurt it that much 7/10

Psicosis vs. Rey Mysterio - I'm kind of in the middle on this match, as its nowhere near as good as some of the stuff they have put on before it is still a solid bout with a great legdrop spot Rey picks it up with the help of the 619 (boo) 6/10

Sabu vs. Rhyno - This starts right after RVD's heart-felt promo, this was a little bit of a let-down although Sabu can't be expected to do everything anymore, kinda feels slow and dragged-on even though it is only 7 minutes and that's never good, great finish 5/10

Eddie Guerrerro vs. Chris Benoit - Technical masterpiece, with both men using great ring psychology, only complaint is that just when it kicks into high gear it ends but that's one complaint over one great match 8/10

Tanaka vs. Mike Awesome - WOW, is the only word that comes to mind when viewing this match, that and OUCH, it is just a spot-fest but what a brilliant spot-fest it is where the action never lets up for a second, withouty a doubt MOTN 10/10

Dudleyz vs. Sandman & Tommy Dreamer - this had to be on the card, although it is not my cup of tea, it is still a very good match, the teaming of Sandy and Dreamer works like a charm and creates some funny moments 6/10

All this action is capped off by the trashing of Eric Bischoff, so I do not know how it could have gotten any better, great climax to a great night",1147305600,,2032,4.152671755725191

The main things I wanted to see were the introductions of Mick Foley and Joey Styles, Paul Heyman's promo, and the Sandman/Tommy Dreamer vs. Dudley Boys main event. My only beef is that they didn't use the Dudley's wwe ""Drop the Bombshell's"" music, same with the Sandman's ""Enter Sandman"" music by Metallica. Those alone would get my blood boiling and rush the adrenaline. ECW was a short lived phenom to me. It was a lifestyle to the fans. And it was all in Bischoff's face!

An excellent extra would also have been the invasions on Raw and Smackdown that they showed on ""Extreme Heat"" on June 12. Even better, they could've included ""Extreme Heat"" altogether on a seperate disk.

First off I want to say GREAT JOB on this to the WWE. VERY VERY GOOD.

Pat yourselves on the ass.

This is none stop action, from start to finish.

First match:

Lance Storm vs. Chris Jericho.

*****

Lance wins with interference from Justin Credible. The Impact Players strike their pose and exit in style. Mick Foley doesn't like it, but he can go to hell. HOW MANY MATCHES DID YOU WIN TONIGHT, MICK! YOU FATASS WALRUS!

Ahem...

Jericho gets a nice ""Lionheart"" chant as the simulated ECW fans show appreciation.

Yes...simulated...tell me they're not...I'll laugh in your face.

Evidence of this is quite clear during the Chris Benoit/Eddie G. ***** match.

Next match was Rey Rey vs. Psychosis.

I hate Rey Rey's ""music""...so this gets a ****.

No, but it's still a fantastic match. But Rey Rey will never get 5 from me until he changes his music back to the old WCW theme.

Then...the ""crusaders"" enter the Hammerstein Ballroom. Angle cuts a bad promo about how ""ECW SUCKS"" and ""YOU CAN ALL KISS MY ASS!"" I really expect more from the man who carried out probably the single funniest skit with the Rock not too long ago...

JBL is next. He's MUCH better on the mic tonight. He informs the simulated ECW virgin fans that he is a wrestling GOD. I tend to believe that. He tells the crowd that they love ECW because they themselves...can be ECW. No matter how much they are losers in real life...they will always be potential ECW heroes.

LOL2006!!!1!!11!!!one!!one

JBL, Angle, HBK, RVD, and Bischoff are the only reasons to watch wwe nowadays...

Speaking of...RVD interupts.

RVD does a weak shoot, and gets speared by Rhino...

Rhino proceeds to stomp a mudwhole in stoner boy's ass...then the lights go out!...

*points to ceiling*

SABU!

****1/2

Sabu's always good for at least 4 stars. RVD interferes because...well...he can. Bill Alphonso is there and he's uglier than ever.

Match 3: Chris/Eddie - Gold. Already rated.

Match 4: Mike Awesome. Masato Tanaka (JBL's doorman)

*****

You can also see this on the new ECW Most Violent Matches DVD...which is SO stupid. I hate WWsupposed""E""...

Heyman comes out and sucks up to the simulated ECW fans...cuts a shoot against Bischoff, Edge, and JBL. Weakest. Shoot. Ever.

Main Event. Dudley's vs. Sandman/Dreamer

Both have a spectacular entrance...but just before the match can get under way...the BWO interupts and screws the entire mood up.

Really...this one moment was the cheesiest, lamest thing I've EVER seen in wrestling. The only thing that might come close is Joey Style's fake, obnoxious laughter in response to it. It was funny about 10 years ago...now it's just lame. But he still laughed like a javalina on crack. Stupid...stupid people. Whoever thought this interuption was a good idea should be drug out into the street and shot in front of their children.

Match was ****1/2. Fantastic ending with Dreamer being powerbombed through a flaming table. As Dreamer lays dying...Sandman dramatically screams ""SOMEONE GET ME A BEER! SOMEONE GET ME A BEER!"" That almost made up for the BWO gayness that happened earlier...but...Jesus forgives...I however, do not.

Austin finishes the show with some good old fashioned redneckian instigation. I'll let you see it for yourself.

Highly recommended.",1140739200,,3272,4.950367647058823
2313976,5,B0009RQSFK,"Match 1 - Chris Jericho vs. Lance Storm  8/10

A fast pace match with Storm winning after interference by Justin Credible, Dawn Marie and Jason.

Match 2 - Yoshiro Tajiri vs. Little Guido vs. Super Crazy  9/10

A great international luchador match with Super Crazy winning. Lots of high flying action.

Match 3 - Rey Mysterio vs. Psicosis  7/10

Not as good as it could be. Rey wins.

Match 4 - Sabu vs. Rhino  8/10

Rhino attacks a broken legged RVD and Sabu comes out to defeat Rhino. RVD cut a shoot promo dissing WWE's use of him and does a mini Van Daminator with a broken foot. He's HARDCORE!!!!!!!!

Match 5 - Eddie Guerrero vs. Chris Benoit  9/10

A great match between two grappling legends with Benoit winning.

Paul Heyman cuts a promo killing Eric Bischoff, Edge and JBL.

Match 6 - Mike Awesome vs. Masato Tanaka 10/10

One of the best matches I ever watched. In the words of the great Joey Styles OH MY GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Match 7 - The Dudleyz vs. Tommy Dreamer and Sandman  10/10

This match had everything from the BWO, KId Kash, Axl Rotten and Balls Mahoney to weapons like Kendo Sticks, Chairs, Ladders, Staplers and FLAMING TABLES. Dudleyz Win

Stone Cold came out and watched the WWE invaders get their asses kicked by Tazz and ECW. Then Bischoff gets 3-D'd, 619'd headbutted and stunned by Stone Cold.

Overall 10/10  I hope they have another ECW PPV next year.

2313977,4,B0009RQSFK,"NOTE: I UPDATED THIS REVIEW IN 2013

After the highly successful sales of the ""Rise & Fall Of ECW"" DVD, WWE held a reunion show for ECW called One Night Stand from the site of the final ECW PPV in Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City.  Joey Styles returned to commentary alongside Mick Foley while special appearances were made throughout the night by ECW alumni such as the bWo, Bill Alfonzo & Rob Van Dam, Kid Kash, Balls Mahoney & Axl Rotten, Al Snow & Head, the biggest gathering of F.B.I. members in ECW history, Joel Gertner, Mikey Whipwreck & the Sinister Minister, Spike Dudley, Justin Credible, Jason, Francine, Beulah, Pitbull #2, Danny Doring & Roadkill, and others while various clips were played throughout the night of historic ECW moments & a ""farewell"" tribute those ECW alumni who passed away since the closing of the company.

Chris Jericho vs. Lance Storm - Jericho went back in time as he came out in his ""Lionheart"" gear while Storm came out to ringside with his valet (and pregnant) Dawn Marie in what would be his last match as a full time active competitor.  Both men had stalemates early before Jericho got the upper hand with a takedown, bow & arrow submission, and dropkick coming out of the corner but Lance came back with a leaping dropkick & delayed vertical suplex as both men traded momentum such as Jericho's dropkick to the back of the head & Storm's trademark sidekick followed by trading submissions like the Walls Of Jericho & single leg crab.  This was a good opener & the best match they've had against each other that's been televised in the United States.

Super Crazy vs. Little Guido vs. Tajiri - Guido came to the ring with various members of his former F.B.I. faction (Tracy Smothers, Big Guido, Tony Mamaluke, J.T. Smith) while Tajiri came to ringside with his former partner Mikey Whipwreck & manager Sinister Minister. The action started off so fast paced that Mick Foley admitted that he would just have to just take a backseat when doing commentary because he knew he couldn't keep up with the action. This was full of various highlights like Crazy's dropkicks to the face on both men, Guido delivering a legdrop off the top rope onto both men, Crazy's own highlight reel of doing a backflip off a balcony onto everyone in the crowd below, all the partners getting involved along with Whipwreck delivering a stunner from the top rope, and the final showdown between the last two competitors. No pun intended but total non-stop action.
[Wrestling's Highest Flyers]

Rey Mysterio vs. Psicosis - This match represented the ""Extreme Lucha Libre"" period of ECW with the interesting note that this was their first televised match in over 6 years. Both men started off slow with Psicosis working a more grounded offense (which the audience booed) before picking up the pace with a flying legdrop from the top rope while Mysterio was hung on the guardrail on the outside. He tried to continue the fast paced offense only to crash & burn in the corner missing a dropkick & later running with such force & missing that he ended up in the front row. The match was considered disappointing with Rey wrestling the ""WWE"" style (hence his signature moves getting booed at the end) & Psicosis being more grounded in the beginning as opposed to the lucha libre style that he was remembered for while it was a little known fact that he was working through a minor knee injury as well but it was still a good match for but pay attention to the commentary as we had a funny moment between Styles & Foley when it turns out that Mick didn't have his facts correct in regards to Mysterio's history.

Sabu vs. Rhyno - What started off as an emotional speech from Rob Van Dam resulted in this encounter with Sabu going extreme right away launching a chair to Rhino on the rop rope followed by his ""vintage"" triple jump dive to the outside & later a slingshot leg lariat before Rhino was able to use Sabu's own momentum against him sending him face first into the chair on more than one occasion with moves like a drop toehold & TKO but Sabu came back while Rob Van Dam also made his presence known.  While Rhyno did get some minor offense in, this was mostly just a showcase for Sabu.

Chris Benoit vs. Eddie Guerrero - This was advertised as the ""pure wrestling"" dream match that we've seen in WCW & WWE & Japan many times but it never happened in ECW with both men starting off with aggressive stalemates during the tie-up causing Eddie to retreat to the floor with his nose cut.  Eddie got some offense in with stiff kicks & chops grounding Benoit while also using dirty tactics like a thumb to the eye & chair on the outside before both men started exchanging chops in the corner allowing Benoit to regain momentum in his favor with his various suplexes including 3 back to back germans, diving headbutt, and the crossface.  While they've had more high quality matches, they was definitely the most aggressive match they've had in WWE because both men came off very stiff than they usually have been against each other.

Masato Tanaka vs. Mike Awesome - This match stated off with Awesome using his power & athleticism such as an over the top rope shoulder block into the ring & suicide dive to the outside while later executing a top rope splash & a stiff powerbomb but Tanaka retaliated with a a running chair into Awesome in the front row before Awesome came back with 3 chairshots.  Both men from here used whatever they could get their hands on to beat the living hell out of each other including a tornado DDT onto a chair & later through a table, chairshot coming off the top rope, powerbombs through tables coming off the top or over the top rope, and suicide dive onto the other on a broken table.  This match was what you called a ""show stealer"" because this was the match that had everyone talking when the show was over & for a long period of time afterwords...and as a side note, pay attention to Joey Styles at throughout the match as he made it clear it's still got some hard feelings in regards to Mike Awesome's exit from ECW.
[Bloodsport: ECW's Most Dangerous Matches]

Tommy Dreamer & Sandman vs. Dudley Boyz - It should be noted that the Sandman's entrance on the original PPV broadcast was ""Enter Sandman"" but that's been dubbed over with generic music on this release & we got a bunch of appearances from many fellow ECW alumni resulting in ""a brawl before THE brawl"" with Joey Styles hitting the line of the night in response to one chairshot that was delivered.  It didn't take long for both teams to start assaulting each other with weapons from a cookie sheet to the cheese grader causing blood to floor & Bubba wearing it as war paint before Dreamer payed homage to Terry Funk with his classic ladder airplane spin while Sandman also was able to use the ladder against Devon on more than one occasion with Bubba eventually able to use the ladder to his advantage like as a frog splash onto it.  Things got even more chaotic when other people wanted to ""make an impact"" at the expense of both teams leading to a ""catfight"" & reunion that ECW fans have been waiting 7 years for only to be eventually topped by another family reunion that involved a road sign, singapore cane, and the flaming table.  To steal a line from the original ECW...this is ""EXTREME"".
[ECW: Extreme Rules]

Various members of the RAW & SmackDown rosters such as Kurt Angle & J.B.L. & Eric Bischoff & Edge sat in the balcony watching the show throughout the night & showing their disapproval of the show in various ways resulting in various moments like Rob Van Dam addressing them during his emotional speech of how important this show was to him, Paul Heyman making an appearance saying some things towards certain people that others weren't allowed allowed to say on a regular WWE broadcast, and the most successful ECW alumni himself in Stone Cold Steve Austin showing up finally calling out everyone to the ring resulting in the big WWE vs. ECW battle (look for who J.B.L. singles out that almost resulted in a potential lawsuit) along with Tazz looking for revenge against Kurt Angle before ECW's anti-christ in Eric Bischoff was left alone with all of the ECW roster.

DVD extras include comments from the fans before the event, all the commercials & superstar spotlights featuring Tommy Dreamer & Sandman & Sabu & Rob Van Dam & Dudley Boyz, highlights from the ECW funeral on RAW, and a ""J.B.L. alternative commentary"" feature in which J.B.L. was miked throughout the event as you just hear the comments from him & those around him.

During that time, this was a very emotional event as it was set to be the final goodbye towards the company with the show set to give you a taste of all the elements that made up the atmosphere of the original ECW that still make this a stand out event years later so this has to be in your collection.",1135900800,10,8872,4.591282375236892
2313978,5,B0009RQSFK,"No flasy effects or big stages were needed for ECW.  It was violence, it was stunts it was for the fans of brawling, street fighting, cat fighting, high flying and painful bumps.  In other words it was ACTION!  A participant at the end of the show proclaims that he nearly ""OD'ed on violence!!""  No lame disjointed story lines to provide a need for the action.  I never saw ECW ""back in the day"" and in fact have only been catching wrestling (WWE) for a year or two now.  I'm sorry I missed ECW, very little WWE has provided for me in this time measured up to the raw two hours of energy and fun that this disc provided me.  Below I will provide a quick run over of matches.

""Lionheart"" Chris Jericho against Lance Storm with Dawn Marie

Very good match with some great holds and smooth action that doesn't sag much throughout.  This match was a good indication of the little to no scriptedness that the night had in store (there is some though).  It's a shame we didn't get to see more of Dawn Marie though...what a honey.

Three Way Dance match.  Tajiri vs Little Guido (Nunzio) vs Supercrazy.  Lots of flippity tricky movements make this match worthwhile.  Supercrazy's Second story balcony moonsault is breathtaking.  Interfereance from a lot of outside guys but it doesn't make the match drag much.

Psicosis vs Rey Misterio Jr.  Not quite what I'd expect from a match with two cruiserweights.  It really could have been better.  Psi tries sleeper holds in a fast action match.  It even gets booed at one point.  Rey and Psi still put on a decent show.  Amazing how Misterio is cool when not being on every waking hour of WWE and aloud to wrestle.  After this WWE guys lowered their ugly heads and stunk up the joint.  This angle was added at the last minute hopingto attract fans who may not have been interested.  It only provided one benefit which I will cover later.

RVD Shoot Promo followed and RVD talks and with breath that probably reeks of weed.  He does capture the audience with and old title story and saying how much of an awesome night this is, and better then Wrestlemania.  Some annoying Bill Alfonso guy is accomponying Rob.

Rhyno vs Sabu  Impromptu match with some stiff hits and bigger power moves.  First use of blunt objects of the night if I recall.  Seeing Sabu wrestle here and at one point seeing him in a vignette landing on his head and breaking his neck in a suplex was a little chilling.  Overall good but short.

Chris Benoit vs Eddie Guerrero (RIP Eddie)  Two awesome wrestlers going at it, loses some steam in a few places but manages to be entertaining with some great diving moves and submission holds.  Watching this and realizing the number of untalented oafs I see on WWE half the time getting a push or airtime (a few of whom were in attendance for this show as part of the Anti ECW group) made me realize how much I should have saw ECW if I had the chance.

Mike Aweome vs Masato Tanaka.  Good Lord this is EASILY the best match of the card and one where I relized the screen was glue in that my eyes couldn't look away.  When Mick Foley (doing commentary with Joey Styles for all the matches by the way) says that Tanaka is one of the toughest guys hes ever met, that means something.  Tanaka must have had 50 lbs of braindamage for signing on to this one.  Two suicide dives, about 5 broken tables and many chairshots later we had a winner.  Yeah, this match ruled, and the ECW fans thought so too.  Don't believe me?  Listen to the crowd at the end of the match.

Paul Heyman, clearly moved by the night came out and expressed his love to the fans and his disgust for some of the WWE guys including outing Lita cheating on Hardy with Edge.  Edge, what a prick.

Dudley Boyz vs Tommy Dreamer and Sandman in a Tornado Tag Match.  The main event could have been as great as the previous match but a long intro by the Sandman and too many interuptions before the match got started and little cooperation between the team mates made it seem less then it should have been.  Plenty of blood and weapons galore including the cheese grater made it fun though.  Listen for Bubba's swear after he attacks with the kendo stick before getting a table.

The WWE vs ECW at the end was anticlimatic unfortuatley but the very end proved to be a happy ending so to speak.

Extras are mostly TV spots from the wrestlers and a montage of WWE proceedings about the PPV.  No bonus matches unfortunatley.

I did say that there was one good point to having the WWE involved.  It came from JBL and his own commentary track after he showed up.  He is clearly loaded and his shouting and comments are drunken gold.  Yelling out during the Awesome/Tanaka match ""Thats my doorman, my doorman's doing good!"", was hilarious.

I've seen many WWE PPVs.  Some of them were doglinks (05 New Years Revolution) some were pretty good (05 Unforgiven and Survivor Series) this one blew them all away.  If Vince is smart he'll make sure another reuinion is in the works for next year.",1134604800,6,4993,4.4448123620309055
2313979,5,B0009RQSFK,"Y2j vs. Lance Storm

Very good chain wrestling in the beginning but MUCH too short

RATING: 80/100

Tajiri vs. nunzio vs. super crazy

An excellent 5min match that had it all in the short time. But wasn't nearly long enough to get into the high 80's

RATING: 80/100

Psicosis vs. Mysterio

Some crazy high flying action, but another match that could have been ten minutes longer (which heavily hurt the rating). This had great potential but ended up being just as long as Smackdown or Velocity match

RATING: 81/100

Sabu vs. Rhino

Various awesome moments with a great ending. Another good match

RATING: 83/100

Benoit vs. Eddie

The longest match on the card and at only 10min, it was an excellent match. Now, I would have loved to have given this match a higher rating, but feel that 90's and high 80's are only due if a match is over 17min. Still a very good wrestling match and had the best technical wrestling on the card.

RATING: 85/100

Mike Awesome vs. Masato Tanaka

A match with many crazy spots and painful moments. The fact that it was one of the longest matches here definitely helped get this into the mid 80's.

RATING: 85/100

Dudleys vs. Sandman & Dreamer

A little bit sloppy at stages but a good memorable ending. The only problem here is that as a main event, it was only ten minutes; my only disappointment.

RATING: 83/100

81% - What will undoubtedly be the best PPV of 2005 (not a wwe ppv however). Every single match did not disappoint and for the first time ever, not one match failed to reach an 80. That in itself is a truly outstanding achievement, and although every match was shorter than what I would have liked, they didn't give 1 boring moment. Only problem here is no titles on the line or storylines in matches - however no real hindrance.

Lance Storm w/Dawn Marie vs ""Lion Heart"" Chris Jericho

This was a good opener that had a lot of chain wrestling. It is said that this is going to be Lance Storm's last match and it didn't disappoint. The match ended when Justin Credible (former ECW Tag-champion with Lance Storm) struck jericho with a singapore cane in the head and Storm pinned him.

Rating:****

We then take a look at a video memorial for the decised members of ECW.

International Three Way Dance: The Insane Luchador Super Crazy vs Little Guido w/ FBI vs Tajiri w/ Sinister Minister and Mikey Whipwreck

This was yet another good match, that let all three competitors shine. The biggest spot of the match (and possibly the night) was created when Super Crazy executed a moonsault off of the balcony onto all five members of the FBI. Little Guido was the first man eliminated after Mikey came in and gave him his finisher and was pinned by Tajiri. Tajiri was eliminated after ward when he recieved three consecutive moonsaults from Super Crazy.

Rating:****

We see a video clip of early ECW moments.

Extreme Luchador Action: Psichosis vs Rey Mysterio

Before the match even started, Psichosis took off his own mask and threw it down in the middle of the ring as a sign of respect(though the fans wanted him to wear the mask). The match started off a little slow, but slowly started to build. There was a sick spot about half way through where Psichosis gave Rey a Guilotine legdrop from the top rope while Mysterio was bent over the guardrail. The finish came when Rey hit the 619 followed by the West Coast Pop. It was a good match, but not up to par with their former matches.

Rating:***1/2

Next we have an excellent shoot promo from Rob Van Dam. I am going to rate this segment because it was so long and brilliantly done. RVD talks about how his time in Extreme Championship Wrestling was the best time of his life and how One Night Stand is bigger than Wrestlmania, and how bad he felt that he couldn't wrestle because of his knee. This was excellently done and you would have to see it to believe it. The promo led to an impromptu match between Sabu and Rhyno.

Rating:***1/2

Rhyno vs Sabu w/ RVD and Bill Alfonso

Sabu comes out to one of the biggest pops of the night. This was a pretty good match with a lot of action. RVD eventually got into the ring and saved Sabu after Rhyno gave him a gore. RVD held Rhyno down on the table as Sabu went up for the Arabian Skull-Crusher through the table.

Rating:***1/2

Chris Benoit vs Eddie Guerrero

Very good match, that shows us that ECW wasn't only about chair shots and amazing dives, but also about amzing mat wrestling. This match was full of intensity from start to finish, and we saw both men show off their qualities. Finish Came when Benoit forced Eddie to tap out. Eddie was an asset to the WWE and wrestling altogether and it is a shame that he died so young.

Rating:****

Mike Awesome vs Masato Tanaka

The match of the night, without a doubt. Both wrestlers bought their A-game and showed us what they are made of. There were many spots in this match, including one were Awesome gave Tanaka a running power bomb of the apron through a table. Later in the match, Tanaka Tornado DDT'ed Mike through a table off the turnbuckle. The finish came when Awesome gave Tanaka an Awesome bomb over the top rope and through a table.

Rating:****1/2

Paul Heyman then came out and gave an emotional promo on ECW and a shoot promo on the WWE Superstars.

Tag-team Match: The Dudley Boyz vs Tommy Dreamer and the Sandman

There is still nothing like a Sandman entrance. The crowd loves him and are explosive as soon as his music hits, still today. Before the match started, there were multiple interferences. We even got to see an awesome double jump swanton bomb-type maneuver from Kid Kash that was absolutely amazing. Tommy and Bubba were cut up by a cheese grater early on in the match. The Impact Players came out to interfere, but were disposed of by Dreamer and Sandman. Finish came when Tommy recieved the 3-D through a flaming table. After the match, the WWE crusaders stormed the ring but were quickly disposed of by the ECW lockerroom. The ECW guys then had a beer bash as we go off air.

2313984,4,B0009RQSFK,"Let me first start off by saying that I am not an original ECW fan. I never saw them on TNN, but maybe once, or seen any of their PPV's. Since becoming a member of an online movie rental, I noticed some old ECW shows. I watched Wrestlepalooza 97' and Cyberslam 99'. But truthfully I wasn't that impressed by them ""wrestling"". ECW isn't wrestling, ECW is carnage. Now their have been some good wrestling matches in the ECW arena, but this is hardcore wrestling. I'm talking senseless beatings of random objects, but they have been known for bringing wrestlers such as Lance Storm, Chris Benoit, Taz, Chris Candido, Shane Douglas, Rob Van Dam, and my personal favorite, Chris Jericho. Also you can't be anything then less then amazed when watching Tag Team matches of the greatest team ever, RVD and the suicidal, homicidal, genocidal, Sabu, managed by the most annoying man alive, Bill Alphonso. So saying ECW is utter crap isn't exactly true. Watching Jerry Lawler ""invade"" ECW with the help of RVD and Sabu was truly amazing. ECW was easily the best wrestling promotion for fans and if they had the money to keep core wrestlers and hardcore legends happy, their would easily be no Vince McMahon on television. So I think it's clear to say, ECW is the most amazing experience.

So if ECW is so great, why only 4 stars? Like I said, the best WWE PPV of the year. Key word being WWE and of course that was going to ruin it. Vince couldn't stand that One Night Stand do well without having a little bit of his creative genius. So in order to promote the PPV on television he incorporated it into a absolutely horrible storyline. He created the crusaders from Raw and Smackdown! to come and ""liven things up"". First of all, true ECW fans aren't going to buy the PPV because of this, so why did they do it? For all the WWE fans. So thanks to that we continuously have to see JBL and the supposed man to ""kill"" ECW, Eric Bischoff. So not only do we get to see an awful WWE storyline, we get to see Bischoff be made a fool of on WWE once again. Vince took all this as he was the man who kept ECW alive for so long, the man who funded all things ECW. Please, Vince was just as bad as Bischoff was during the Monday Night Wars. Do names such as Tazz, the Dudley Boys, Too Cold Scorpio, Cactus Jack, and of course Stone Cold. So while Vince tried to come away with the hero, he just came away over exposed.

Alright, the ECW part of the PPV was excellent. Even though the matches showcased current WWE ""superstars"" and employees, I had some high spots. The Jericho VS Storm match is supposed to be Lance's final match and it was a good opener, nothing over done but it got the job done and it brought the Impact Players reunion as Justin Credible and Jason show up. The crowd gave Jericho props, chanting ""Lionheart"" at the end of the match. What I didn't like was when Jericho put on the Walls of Jericho, the Boston Crab. Do us all a favor and give us the Lion Tamer with the stand up version. The 3-Way Dance had a lot of spots, Super Crazy went nuts. His Moonsault off the balcony was jaw dropping. Also we got to see FBI and the Whippersnapper got Little Guido eliminated. Nice quick match. Rey VS Psychosis wasn't as good as I expected. These guys had a series of good matches in ECW earlier I guess, and Psychosis just went slow and Rey just isn't what he was. The fans showed their disproval as well. It had its moments but nothing worth getting this for. RVD isn't great on the microphone but his injury kept him out of the ring which sucks. The fans loved him and he got to speak his mind. Rhino shows up and Gores him, the Sabu shows up. Sabu is just nuts, no other way to put it and RVD did a little bit, nice match. Fans didn't take to Rhino well, but he did a good job. Eddie VS Benoit wasn't great, the JBL tried to claim Benoit to Smackdown!. Like I said, match didn't really do anything for me. Least favorite, if they ha been given more time it would have kicked ass.

The final 2 matches were easily the best of the night. They bled hardcore ECW style and the fans ate it up. Awesome VS Tanaka was amazing, a lot of amazing moves and things and Awesome ran wild while Tanaka took the pain. Almost a squash match though, great match though. Paul Hayman gave a great promo and took shots at JBL and Edge among others. The Dudleys VS Sandman and Tommy Dreamer. Here is the thing, these guy can't wrestle, they are strictly hardcore. The Dudleys are the best Tag Team in ECW history and Dreamer and Sandman are legends to the promotion. The bWo showed up was great along with Balls and Axel. Kid Kash cleared the ring to get things started. Great hardcore Tag match with an excellent run-in by the Impact Players and some eye candy, Dreamer's wife and Francine. You get to see a cat fight and  Francine's ass but it is nothing you haven't seen before.

So overall a really good PPV, I won't say the end, even though everyone probably knows what happened. They needed Raven and a few other stars, but what can you do when he is with the rival? New Jack would have been cool too, but the law got involved. Like I said, WWE crusader's ruined the PPV because guys like Snitsky, Maven, one of the French guys, the Basham's and a bunch of other useless tools. Like RVD said, this PPV didn't need storylines, but Vince couldn't help himself and made a great thing just simply good.",1129939200,5,5379,4.33234126984127

Chris Jericho vs Lance Storm (with Dawn Marie)

A great opener that shows the WWE wasted storm's talent by branding him boring.  Good moves and fast pace.  The ending was not great as Storm could have won by himself.

8/10

Tajiri vs Super Crazy vs Little Guido

A good match, quick falls and some great moves from super crazy, not my favourite of the night.

Psicosis vs Rey Mysterio

Probably the worst on the card although there were some great moves and thrilling moments.

This one hapened after RVD got gored by Rhyno.  I thought it was great with chairs, high flying moves and brutality.  Great match.

1) Chris Jericho vs Lance Storm - I thought this was a perfect opener, both men just worked their asses off in this, pretty incredible when you consider that Storm has been retired a while now. Jericho ditched a lot of WWE moves in favour of moves ECW fans would appreciate (unlike Rey Mysterio). I liked the ending, as we got to see Storm/Credible/Jason/dawn in the ring togeather which I thougt was cool - 8/10

2) Tajiri vs Super Crazy vs Little Guido - for the very short time it lasted this match was great. We have all seen what these men can do in a triple threat situation and they didn't dissapoint. The match was weakened simply through it being rushed - 7/10

3) Psicosis vs Rey Mysterio - this is the match that did nothing for me. I am not a fan of Psicosis and as awesome as Rey is he was wrestling with an injured knee and also didn't realise that his 619 move would get booed out of the building. Once is forgiveable but he was dumb enough to do it again later in the show - 6/10

4) Sabu vs Rhyno - this is basically your typical Sabu spotfest, which means this was a great match. It was also nice to see a recently fired Rhyno make a welcome appearnace - 8/10

5) Benoit vs Eddy - this was not the best match these two have had, but it was still an awesome technical match - 7/10

6) Mike Awesome vs Masato Tanaka - words simply cannot describe this match, absolutely brutal, you have to see it to believe it - 10/10 and well deserved. Match of the night by a mile.

7) The Dudleys vs Tommy Dreamer and Sandman - this was another brutal match, flaming tables for gods sake, what more can you ask for. Watching Sandmans entrance was awesome, not that you can see it on this DVD because the WWE are too tight fisted to play Metallica's version of Enter Sandman - 9/10

ECW was brought back for a One Night Stand. Paul Heyman's small business came back for one time because of the ECW fans and the sales of ""The Rise And Fall Of ECW"". I was so excited to hear about because I am a huge wrestling fan and I will never forget about this night. Some famous ECW superstars were there including The Sandman, Tommy Dreamer, Rob Van Dam, Sabu, Dudley Boyz, the BwO and others. There were seven matches at this extraordinary Pay Per View and the WWE Crusaders. Here are the matches and reviews:

ECW : One Night Stand

Hammerstein Ballroom

New York City, New York

June 12, 2005

1) Lance Storm vs. ""Lion Heart"" Chris Jericho

This match wasn't as good as the other matches, but it was good enough for the ECW fans as they were cheering and cheering away for these two guys. The match started off pretty fast and there was not much outside use. In the end of the match, Lance Storm's long time friend and tag team partner Justin Credible came out to the ring and hit Chris Jericho with a kendo stick across the head and gave Lance Storm the victory. Not the way you want to see Lance Storm winning a match. 3/5

2) Three Way Dance

Super Crazy vs. Little Guido vs. Tajiri

The match started off pretty quick for the three superstars as they got some quick moves and kicks. Super Crazy pleased the fans when he back flipped off the top of the barricade and moonsaulted onto the whole F.B.I. Later on, Tajiri got Little Guido with mist and a kick and picked up the victory. Then it was between Super Crazy and Tajiri. It ended quick when Super Crazy got the triple moonsault on Tajiri and won the match with a lot of fans pleased by his victory. 4/5

3) Extreme Luchador Match

Rey Mysterio vs. Psicosis

This match also started out pretty fast as well as the two men got fast moves on eachother. Rey Mysterio with some high flying moves as well as Psicosis. In the beginning, Psicosis showed his respect for the ECW fans when he ripped off his mask and showed who Psicosis was. A nice move that Psicosis did was get Rey Mysterio with the leg drop off the top rope onto the ground. Rey later got a nice move from the ring to where the fans were sitting onto Psicosis. The match ended off with Rey Mysterio getting the West Coast Pop on Psicosis to win the match. 4/5

4) Rhyno vs. Sabu

This match was made on the spot when Sabu came to the aid of Rob Van Dam who was talking about how he wanted to be at One Night Stand more than anything. So, Rhyno came and started attacking Rob Van Dam and Bill Alfonso. Then Sabu came and the match was made. It was probably the second best match on the card because there were a lot of chair shots and a lot of tables used in the match. The match was over when Sabu got the leg drop onto the table with a chair in place on Rhyno. Rhyno also got hit with the chair to Rob Van Dam to weaken him out a little as well. Second best match of the night. 4.5/5

5) Chris Benoit vs. Eddie Guerrero

This match was more of a wrestling match than it was an ECW match, but the fans were pleased about this. This was the first time that it was Eddie vs. Chris. These two men showed a lot of courage and power going into the match. The match was pretty long and it was pretty good when Chris got the Crippler Crossface and won the match. Was more of a WWE match than ECW. 3/5

6) Mike Awesome vs. Masato Tanaka

This match was also a pretty good ECW match. There was a lot of chairs and a lot of tables in the match. The Awesome Bomb onto the table was an amazing move. The chair, table, and fighting use was awesome and I was proud to see the match. Mike Awesome won the match with an Awesome Bomb from the ring to the outside on a table and then the Suicide Awesome Splash. 4.5/5

7) Dudley Boyz vs. Tommy Dreamer and The Sandman

This was the best match of the night because there was a lot of action in the match and a lot of weapon use. The match showed a lot of courage from the four men and there was a cheese grater in use which was amazing. Any weapon that you can possibly think of was in use. Dudley Boyz won the match when Dudley Boyz slammed Tommy Dreamer through a flaming table which I thought was cool. 5/5

Later on, Steve Austin came to the ring and told the WWE Crusaders to come to the ring and gave a beating to the Crusaders and Eric Bischoff was brought to the ring by Mick Foley and Bischoff got hit with a 3-D, Flying Headbutt, 619, and a Stone Cold Stunner.

For those of you who were fans of the promotion, it's your chance to go back in time for one night and pretend that Vince McMahon didn't really kill off all his competition and the wrestling business as a whole.

Chris Jericho vs Lance Storm is great, and serves as Storm's retirement match.

Also watch the Mike Awesome vs Masato Tanaka match, as they literally KILL each other for your viewing pleasure, and the crime is that neither were offered a WWE contract after this match.

The only knock on this show is that, in the back of your mind, you still know it's a WWE produced show, and that you can never truly go back in time. This is never more evident than when a group of WWE wrestlers appear on the show sitting in the stands, to ""invade"" the program. It's a bit of a buzkill, but doesn't ruin the show as a whole.

2314003,4,B0009RQSFK,"For starters, I have to say that the quality of the matches are mostly superb, with Tanaka vs Awesome being the highlight of the night.

The opening bout between Lance Storm and Chris ""Lionheart"" Jericho is also a solid match, with the Impact players making..well..an impact.

The threeway-dance between Nunzio, Super Crazy and Tajiri is also a good one, with an obvious highlight being Super Crazy's bump.

So far so good..till we get the match between Psicosis and Rey Mysterio. While having some good moments it's painfully obvious that it's more of a match you'd seen at a WWE-event rather than at an ECW-event. Then the WWE-crusaders start to arrive..and I gotta say I actually enjoyed that aspect of the PPV. Highlight being JBL taunting Rey saying: ""I got a ticket you little mexian""..priceless. Just about the only highlight for JBL that night in my opinion.

Sabu vs Rhyno

First RvD (with Bill Alfonso) comes out and does a shoot-promo on the way he's been treated in the WWE. Excellent. Then he get's gored by Rhyno..and Sabu comes in. Not a technical wrestling-clinic, but pretty awesome brawling in my book. Sabu is one crazy SOB, and this isn't even close to his earlier stuff in ECW. He still doesn't slow down. Good solid bout, ending with Sabu & RvD paying tribute to Sabu's uncle and their trainer The Original Sheik.

Chris Benoit vs Eddie Guerrero is a let-down, I'd hoped for a classic but in reality it sucks. Guerrero is rumoured to have been a bit pissy backstage about the finish, where he taps out cleanly to the crossface. It's alleged that he sandbagged the performance, and Benoit was visibly frustrated. And..Guerrero didn't look as he was in much pain while under the crossface. Didn't sell very well at all.

Tanaka vs Awesome is..well..it's frikking awesome that's what it is. Easily match of the night in my book. Sick bumps, excellent brawling, liberal use of chairshots & tables and Joey Styles using the first five minutes of it to shoot on Awesome. I loved this match, and so should you. As a testament to its quality..the fans started chanting ""This match rules"". Could you get a better seal of approval?

Paul Heyman shoot-promo: Two words..Matt Freaking Hardy. This one is awesome, and pretty much worth the ppv alone. Altough, the match that followed this promo isn't bad either.

Dreamer & Sandman vs The Dudleyz: Brutal fight, flaming tables and cheezegraters..you named it and they pretty much had it. The bWo makes an appearance..so does Axl Rotten & Balls Mahoney..and of course Mr. Total Nonstop Attitude Kid Kash.

I loved it. BUT...they cut out Sandmans entrance-music. Or rather, they changed from Metallica's Enter Sandman to some generic crap. Horrible decision, as that entrance was actually worth the price of the ppv alone. Altough Sandman is still visibly drunk, which is always a good thing.

Then the post-show brawl, starring Steve Austin. I liked it..albeit JBL was totally unprofessional in the way that he beat on the Blue Meanie. And basically, I don't think it was a coincidence that only WWE-guys got to beat on Bischoff..

Extras..they are allright I guess. Should have included the Byte This! before the ppv, which was excellent. In my opinion they pushed it out too soon, and should have made more an effort. Still, the show in itself is still very much worthy of ECW. Even if no nudity was included, you still got to watch Beulah McGillicutty (Tommy Dreamer is one lucky SOB) one more time, and that's always a bonus.

All in all, 4 stars. If they had included the orginal Enter Sandman, and did a bit more on the extras-bit it would have been five. Maybe I'm being a bit generous, but the show in it iself is very much worth the money. Still, I'm glad I taped the show orginally so I can still see Sandman's entrance.",1123027200,,3788,4.764885496183206
2314004,4,B0009RQSFK,"I matched ECW during it's last 2 years and i have more fond memories in those last 2 years then in maybe the last 5-7 of WWE. ECW brought a ton of emotion to wrestling and that is clear on this show. The DVD itself is pretty much just the PPV so it loses points on the lack of special features, a classic ECW match here and there would not have killed them but is understandable with how fast this DVD was produced. As far as the matches go Awsome v. Tanaka was great, Eddy v. Benoit Psycosis v. Rey Jr. were total let downs. The main event seemed like they tried to cram everyone in there and the fallout after the main event with the WWE brawling with ECW was marginal. The live version of the show had Tommy Dreamer (my all time favorite) come out to a generic version of ""Man in the Box"" so his entrance lost nothing on the DVD however Sandman got the real version of ""Enter Sandman"" but the on the DVD it is replaced with a generic version. On the live show Sandman's entrace was worth the price of ordering the show but on the DVD it loses a lot of impact (although it bleeds through from time to time and you can kind of hear the crowd). If there was one thing about the show that really bothered me it would have to be Mick Floey on comentary, had Joel Gertner been with Joey Styles, or Styles alone it would have been better.

But One Night Stand turned out to be the best PPV I've seen in years.  If you liked ECW, or are curious about ECW was like, I'd recommend buying this PPV.  My only complaints are that it's a lot shorter than most PPVs.  They could have easily added another match to the card and had time to spare.

As a result, we get a generic-cised music overlay during his 5+ minute ring entrance, with all commentary having to be stripped out of it.  The Dudley Boys music has been changed too.

2314010,4,B0009RQSFK,"The first time I saw ECW was on public television, when the Dudley Boyz 3-D'd Beullah, thus breaking her neck. I forgot what year that was or how old I was when that happened, but it doesn't matter. The end result was the persistent viewing of ECW every Saturday night. When this PPV, and later DVD, came out, I was happy to watch the competitors of old fight the way wrestling ought to be--no storylines, no phoniness, no script, no bulls**t. Pure, adrenaline-rush style wrestling straight from the heart.

Although some of the matches and parts of the PPV/DVD I was not sold on, the event still had that old magic during its run. Here's a review and/or rating of the happenings in this event, with the winners of the matches listed first.

Joey Styles and Mick Foley come out--Hearing Joey Styles' ""OH MY GOD!"" quote was quite refreshing and brilliant, and Mick Foley's appearance was great. 8/10

Lance Storm vs. Chris Jericho--A fine fought match between two friends and probably one of the better technical matches in the PPV, despite the organization's tendency to go to extremes (no pun intended) and Justin Credible's interference on behalf of Storm (although the cane shot was loud and sick). Dawn Marie still looks hot. 8/10

Pitbull Gary Wolfe leads a memorial of late ECW stars, including Rocco Rock, Mike ""Crash Holly"" Lockwood, and Chris Candido, who passed away just this year. Fans voiced their support in Candido's memory.

Super Crazy vs. Tajiri vs. Little Guido--Killer match, especially with SC backflipping onto the FBI from a balcony and Mikey Whipwreck doing the Whippersnapper on Little Guido. Tajiri may have been a little slow, but there were some good spots he showed. Interference could have been less prevalent, but the match was good. 8.5/10

Rey Mysterio Jr. vs. Psichosis--Disappointing for the most part, except for Psichosis' Guillotine on Rey. Psichosis is aging, which is understandable, but what's not understandable is Rey sticking to his WWE format. Certainly didn't win anyone over with that, but his time for redemption will show up later on. 4/10

Smackdown Superstars arrive--What a stupid idea. Who the hell cares about them anyway? 0/10

RVD's emotional speech--Clearly moving and it was a shame he couldn't be able to wrestle. 9/10

Sabu vs. Rhyno--Rhyno does the Gore on RVD and attacks his injured knee. Then Sabu is in the ring after the lights go out and a match is underway. Sabu might not have been slower than usual but he performed and came away with the win, with some help from a vengeful RVD. Despite the loss, Rhyno appears to be in the best shape of his life. Too bad WWE cats fired him 'cause he had some talent. 8/10

RAW Superstars arrive--Again another despicable idea. Bischoff must die!! 0/10

Chris Benoit vs. Eddie Guerrero--Not an impressive match, but then again it wasn't their best either. It was still good to see them in the ring at the same time again. 6/10

Paul Heyman makes speech--Very moving and truthful, and I was pleased even more when he targeted the WWE superstars on the balcony. Thanks Paul for the memories. 9.5/10

Mike Awesome vs. Masato Tanaka--The matach of the night. So many nearfalls and tables used. Both competitors got the respect of the fans for this match. 9.5/10

Dudley Boyz vs. Tommy Dreamer and Sandman--Great match from start to finish. Sandman's entrance is one of the greatest I've ever seen, other than his music being butchered by some techno-idiot, but hey Metallica may have had a problem with that so no hard feelings. Anyways, BWO, Kid Kash, and Balls Mahoney & Axl Rotten make appearances before the match starts. Balls & Axl bring out the chairs, I wet my pants at BWO's entrance including Blue Meanie's dance, and Kid Kash jumps on top of everyone in the entranceway. Match finally goes on and there are weapons everywhere--cheese craters, signs, trash cans, chairs, and a burning table. Glorious. Then the Impact Players come in and attack Dreamer, and hot-ass Francine low blows Tommy. Then Beullah comes out to the ring and a catfight ensues between her and Francine. Later on Dudleyz powerbomb Sandman through table, then 3-D Dreamer, and then put him through a burning table, with help from little Spike Dudley. 9.5/10

Stone Cold comes out to invite the ECW wrestlers and challenges the WWE ""crusaders"" to fight them in the ring. Taz then comes out and attacks Kurt Angle and the brawl is underway. Taz chokes out Angle while ECW clears the ring of WWE superstars. Stone Cold asks Mick Foley to come to the ring and drag Bischoff along with him. The ECW then proceeds to beat up and humiliate Bischoff (including Rey Mysterio, who plants a 619 on Eric, gaining him cheers and redemption from the earlier match), capping it with a Stone Cold Stunner. The ECW wrestlers then drink beers in celebration. 10/10",1122854400,,4827,4.833939393939394

First of all, most HARDCORE fans will tell you that the inclusion of the WWE guys on this show WAS NOT a selling point. I can't stand looking at JBL on Smackdown as it is. I could give a rats a** less about him. The actual wrestling was great compared to what i've been watching for the past 5-6 years.

I am only writing this review because I really there is only one type of person that would buy this disc: the serious Wrestling/ECW Fan. And it is to *this* person, I target this review.

Now there is nothing wrong with the actual card itself. That's why I decided to buy the actual PPV in the first place, and was elated during so. And because I knew that the reason this PPV even happened was because of the phenomenal success of ECW Compilation disc, I bought this disc at the first chance I could (which would be almost a month late, thank you Florida.)I pop this disc in, love the heck out of seeing emotion in wrestling again and look foward to the conclusion of this charged card.

The Dudley's enter

Followed by Tommy Dreamer and his mangled theme music, but I knew that what was coming up next would make everything worth while.

See, The Sandman's entrance was always one of my favorite reasons for watching wrestling. That the entire viewing audience is in on this amazing example of ""entertainment more wrestling"" in a league that often had the best of both worlds was just simply awe-inspiring. The smoke kicks in. I get ready.

For nothing.

The Sandman's entrance, is gone.

Now, if this was *just* the completely different music edited into the audio, I would be able to deal with it. After all, I had just experienced it 30 seconds ago with Tommy Dreamer.

But, this is Vince McMahon, who tends to like setting his fans on polar opposites. So the actual camera angles are changed/edited too. WWE has done everything in their power to avoid any affiliation with Metallica. You can't even just sing along at home since you can never catch any of the fans singing along, which considering what we're talking about is quite a feat.

I was so disheartened by this, I ejected the disc, and am currently using it as a snazzy looking coaster.

To wrap up what is probably far too long of a review, The extra's are laughable (It comes with a commentary...by JBL.), and the previously discussed Editing Sacrilage is a smash in the face of every fan who payed $40 in the hopes that Vince would figure out what he was doing.

2314013,4,B0009RQSFK,"I have mixed emotions about this ppv. It has its good & bad moments. I never was a fan of ECW but I will be fair in my review. For those who whine & complain why WWE didn't get more non WWE guys who competed in ECW. The reason is that some were under contract to TNA. I don't think the Jarretts were going to allow their guys to compete on a ppv run by WWE. I believe the guys who did compete were basically trying out for WWE. To say someone was a sellout is absolutely wrong. Most of the old ECW guys would jump at the opportunity to get a WWE contract.

  The ECW promotion had good ideas but they drove it in the ground. Every match was hardcore & that gets old after awhile. I like to see different styles of matches. Now on to the matches.

The ppv opens with the introduction by Joey Styles. Styles & Mick Foley are the commentators.

Lance Storm(w/ Dawn Marie) vs Chris Jericho 9/10- a great match with back & forth action. Storm hasn't look this good in years in what will probably be his last match. Justin & Jason Credible make an appearance.

Psichosis vs Rey Mysterio 7/10- a pretty decent match. they have had much better together. Psichosis removing his mask wasn't a good idea. He doesn't seem the same. Mysterio wrestles with an injured ankle.

The WWE Smackdown invaders arrive headed by JBL & Kurt Angle. they include The Cabinet, Carlito, Matt Morgan. Joel Gertner attempts to interview them.

Three Way Dance

Tajiri(w/ Mikey Whipwreck & Sinister Minister) vs Super Crazy vs Little Guido( w/ F.B.I.) 9.5/10- an excellent match. these 3 put on a show especially SC. the drawback was too much interference. an awesome must see move in this match!

Rob Van Dam comes out with Bill Alfonso after being out for 4 months. I was disappointed to see he wasn't able to wrestle. he cuts the most awesome shoot promo. WWE needs to let him be like this.

Rhyno vs Sabu 7.5/10- this starts when Rhyno interrupts RVD. hre lights go out & Sabu appears. the years have taken their toll on Sabu. he is a shell of his former self but still can halfway perform. RVD gets involved & injures himself worse.

Al Snow cuts a promo with Head.

Gary Wolfe hosts a tribute to the deceased Ecw alumini

Eddie Guerrero vs Chris Benoit 8/10- a good match but not among their classics. it was way too short as is most ECW matches. Eddie seemed distracted.

Masato Tanaka vs Mike Awesome 10/10- the match of the night! these 2 were at the top of their game. brutal back & forth action. this should have been the main event.

The WWE Raw intruders arrive lead by Eric Bischoff. they include Edge, William Regal, Jonathan Coachman, Rob Conway, Gene Snitsky, Christian & Maven.

Paul Heyman comes out & cuts an awesomely funny shoot promo. I have never liked Heyman but he knocks it out of the park.

Bubba & D-Von Dudley vs Tommy Dreamer & Sandman 8.5/10- i hate Sandman. he takes 10 minutes to get to the ring. Dreamer & Sandjerk do a vulgar act with 2 women in the front row. great to see the Dudleys return after a 5 month absence. before the match can begin, people start coming out. Lance Storm, Credible Bros, B.W.O., Balls Mahoney, Axl Rotten, Kid Kash, Danny Doring, Roadkill & Spike Dudley. after the chaos clears, the bell rings.  good action but nothing spectacular.

Steve Austin comes out after the match & joins Sandman. Austin challenges the WWE invaders to come down to the ring. they accept & a wild battle royal ensues. a wild way to end the show. Mick Foley grabs Eric Bischoff & drags him to the ring. ECW beats him down.",1122422400,,3529,4.416666666666667

To see all the ECW stars who weren't there, check out Hardcore Homecoming, which took place at the ECW Arena a week before One Night Stand.

2314015,4,B0009RQSFK,ECW one night stand was an amazing ppv. such a refreshment from the normal wwe programs. Many of the matches on one night stand are exellent everyone gave it their all and over all it was just awesome. my only real complaint was that there were a lot of ecw wrestlers that should have been on that show that weren't. but atleast this ppv had a chance to do ECW some justice and show how ECW wrestlers put thier bodies on the line over and over again for the entertainment of the fans.,1122076800,,484,4.21505376344086
2314016,5,B0009RQSFK,"This was an amazing show that for 1 night made me love wrestling again, for one night it was about the wrestling and not the drama and the storylines.  It would have been a lot better w\o the WWE Invaders crap, but since Vince put this all together that was to be expected and is forgivable, but what is not fogivable is the blatant and very cheaply done overdubbing of Enter Sandman when the Sandman entered, if you watched it on PPV they played Enter Sandman by Metallica no problem, but on the DVD they just slapped some really cheesy WCW jobber quality music over top of Enter Sandman, you can acutally hear the original music playing underneath.  Other than that it was a night to be remembered, the performance of the night I gave to Supercrazy because he was just on fire, the match of the night goes to Mike Awesome and Masato Tanaka those two really know how to give a good match, the biggest disappointment of the night was Psicosis, he has slowed down in his old age and he's just not the same without his mask, but for those of you who want more ECW stars of the past I recommend Hardcore Homecoming which features Mike Awesome vs. Masato Tanaka and the main event and 3 way barbed wire dance between The Homicidal, Suicidal, Genocidal madman Sabu, ""The Franchise"" Shane Douglas, and the Godfather of Hardcore Terry Funk.",1122076800,,1333,4.5041322314049586

The WWE invaders' parts were crap, but then who's really surprised about that. JBL's commentary was usually quite funny, in a not intended to be so way.

2314020,4,B0009RQSFK,"Like the review title says, it's nice to see some old ECW faces again; like Sandman, Tommy Dreamer, Lance Storm, Justin Credible, The BWO, Balls Mahoney, Axl Rotten, Joel Gertner, Mikey Whipwreck & The Sinister Minister, Bill Alphonso, Roadkill, Francine & Beulah.

Unfortunately, Vinny Mac couldn't or wouldn't get several more of ECW's stars to work the show such as; Raven, The Franchise, New Jack & Mustafa (the gangstas), Kronus & Saturn (eliminators), Bam Bam Bigelow, Terry Funk, Brian Lee, 2 Cold Scorpio, Tommy Rich, Dr. Death Steve Williams (who I understand is in ailing health), Sign Guy Dudley, Woman, Kimona and several more.

Raven & Franchise are understandable as they work for TNA and couldn't work due to contractual limitations.

All in all, it was a great show. The Lance Storm/Jericho match was good, the 3 way dance was good, the Guerrero/Benoit match was good too. The Rey Mysterio/Psicosis match was a little let down as Psicosis unmasked before the match ""out of respect"" and Rey (although I haven't seen Smackdown) seems to have done his usual WWE match format, not so much old ECW style.

The tag match with Sandman & Dreamer vs the Dudley's was great!

Blood & Flaming Tables! Buh Buh Ray seems to have lost a lot of weight & looked better than I've ever seen him. Unfortunately with the recent ""rumored"" WWE cuts it seems if we won't get to see the Dudleys (including Spike) on WWE TV anytime soon unless there are some secret plans to fire up a new ECW tv program when WWE moves back to the USA network in August.

As with any ECW show, there were a few special surprises & shoot interviews. Not too many promos, but for a one night stand, I can understand.

The ""ECW Remembers"" segment was ok, but left out some major ECW talent who are no longer with us like; Rick Rude, Brian Pillman, Eddie Gilbert just to name a few.

I thought the dvd should have included a full tribute in the extras section dedicated to all the ECW stars that are no longer with us.

Although Chris Candido last worked for TNA, it would have been nice for a special memorial for him as we lost him so recently.

The announcing by Joey Styles was pretty good, almost as good as the old ECW days. Mick Foley (mankind, cactus jack, dude love) was helping with the commentary, but I felt Mick was a little slow and didn't have much energy.

The ""wwe crusaders"" from smackdown & raw were a joke, so bad that some of them are rumored to have been let go shortly afterwards. I have no idea as to why WWE wrestlers who didn't work in ECW, and some of who probably never heard of ECW before were brought into the mix, unless the WWE bigwigs thought they needed to add some WWE flash. I would have rather seen an old school ECW brawl with ECW wrestlers beating the crap out of each other.

As you may have read online, JBL must have had a few too many ""cold ones"" before the brawl because he literally beat the crap out of the Blue Guy... the Blue Guy was bleeding and quite upset at JBL for the unnecessary beating.

Roadkill & Danny Doring were ""featured"" on the dvd, but I only saw them in the brawl briefly. Similarly, the FBI were only seen briefly.... although Big Guido, Doring & Roadkill were recently shown on OVW's Saturday nite show which leads me to believe they may show up on WWE tv (likely Heat or Velocity)

The ""extras"" were pretty lacking. 2 tv commercials, a few vignettes of ECW wrestlers & ""ECW fans at the show"" that looked like they were just trying to fill up the dvd.

It could have been better with a full bio on each of the ECW wrestlers, or the ECW titles, or something better.

The running time states ""approx 3 hours"" but it was more like 2 hours 30 minutes.

This event had it all, from awesome matches to great shoot promos. The Mike Awesome vs. Masato Tanaka match stole the show by far. The only real dud match was Mysterio vs. Psicosis. It could have been so much more was utter garabage. The JBL commentary is weird and people can criticise it all they want, but if they don't like it, turn it off. The only gripe I have about this DVD is that the ECW funeral from raw is on here but is shown in clips.

The only good part were when Stone Cold Steve Austin showed up, and when the Dudleys put their opponent through a table on fire.

Super crazy doing the moonsault off the balcony was great. the rvd shoot was emotional. as was the paul heyman shoot emotional and just seeming like getting things off his chest. the mike awesome vs tanaka match stole the show and was the best of the night. the only problem i have is the dvd feels rushed. thats why i gave it 4 stars. pretty much no bonus features. a few seconds of clips put together. and a lame alternate commentary from jbl. i think if the wwe waited a few more weeks to add bonus features this would be an amazing dvd. but the ppv is worth the price and relieving memories of when wrestling was fun.,1120348800,,892,4.252941176470588

2314027,4,B0009RQSFK,"This DVD is worth your $20 bucks and I can only describe it in one word: EMOTION! While there are a few things they could've done without or done better, it was overall a good show! I do have to give Vince McMahon a little credit for letting them more or less do an ECW style show for the most part! Here is a review of the matches:

Introduction of Joey Styles - Very emotional. You could see Joey fighting back tears as I am sure he never thought he'd be doing this again for ECW. Was good to see Mick Foley again too!

Lance Storm w/Dawn Marie Vs. Chris ""Lionheart"" Jericho - The former ""Thrillseekers"" got it on in the opening match! Not a great bout but definitely a good opener. Look for Justin Credible and Jason to show up during this bout too!

Super Crazy Vs. Tajiri w/Mikey Whipwreck & Sinister Minister Vs. Little Guido w/FBI - They did an ECW style Triple Threat bout rather than the WWE one. This version is better in my eyes because it is a more satisfying ending with two men being eliminated rather than the first man to get a pinfall! Best spot was S.C. doing a mooonsault from....well, you'll have to see it but it was great!

Rey Mysterio Vs. Psychosis - Okay bout but definitely not one of their better ones. Fans turn against Rey during this because he did his WWE style rather than his old ECW one.

RVD shoot interview - I like this new intensity out of Rob Van Damn! I hope they let him keep it when he returns to action for WWE RAW!

Sabu Vs. Rhino - Pretty good match. Have to give Sabu props for wrestling at all as he isn't in good health these days! Rhino looked in great shape as well!

Chris Benoit VS. Eddie Gurrerro - Pretty good match but definitely not their best! I've seen better with these two! Word is even they weren't happy with the match either!

Paul Heyman shoot - Very entertaining and truthful!

Mike Awesome Vs. Masato Tanaka - Match of the evening! Awesome wasn't in good shape BUT he and Tanaka did tear it down! I also liked how Joey Styles reminded the fans how Awesome screwed over ECW a few years back! Hilarioius!

Tommy Dreamer/The Sandman Vs. The Dudley Boyz - Probably my only real gripe about this DVD! They edited out ""Enter The Sandman"" for some crappy generic theme! Then again, considering how big of jerks Metallica is over their music, the WWE probably didn't feel like fighting with them! Brutal bout that saw Justin Credible, Lance Storm, Kid Kash, the bWo, Francine and Beullah (Tommy's real life wife) interfere in it! Ending will widen your eyes!

WWE Vs. ECW brawl - ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin makes an appearance and challenges his fellow WWE wrestlers to come down and kick ECW's butt (Austin was clearly siding with ECW by the way)! They come down and TAZ from WWE Smackdown makes an appearance too! The ECW group pretty much beats down WWE and even Eric Bischoff gets his butt handed to him at the end!

Overall, this is a good DVD! Just one piece of advice: DO NOT TURN ON THE ALTERNATE COMMENTARY OF JBL! THIS SHOULD NOT HAVE EVER BEEN ON THIS DVD AND HE SAYS NOTHING OF VALUE WHATSOEVER! LISTEN TO IT AT YOUR OWN RISK BUT I'LL BET MOST OF YOU WILL AGREE THAT IT WAS A WASTE OF TIME FOR WHOEVER PRODUCED THIS DVD TO PUT ON THERE AS AN EXTRA! THAT ALTERNATE COMMENTARY WAS A WASTE OF SPACE! IF ANYONE, THEY SHOULD'VE GAVE IT TO ""STONE COLD"" OR TAZZ!

Anyway, that's my only real gripe about this DVD! Still, it is a good buy and I would only rank WWE Vengeance above it so far this year!",1120348800,2,3462,4.315870570107858
2314028,5,B0009RQSFK,i think the ecw ppv was carzy it was the best ecw ppv i think we as ecw fans should stand up and boycot wwe program  till thay put ecw back on tv,1120348800,,145,3.393939393939394
2314029,5,B0009RQSFK,"This is a great ppv with great action and a lot of shoots. RVD comes out and actually gets to talk and he shoots on how the WWE limited his vocabulary to ""Cool"". Paul Heyman does a great job telling of Bischoff, Edge and JBL.He tells JBL that he was only a long time champ because HHH didn't wanna work Tuesdays. At least someone tells it like it is. He also tells Edge that he has 3 words for him ""Matt Friggen Hardy"". Edge looks shocked but then raises 3 fingers and says that's 3 words. Edge deserves a spear himself these days.

  Anyway the matches are pretty good too. Lance Storm verses Jericho isn't bad. Is nice to see Storm actually get to put on a good match. Unlike in the WWE where they made him into a dancing fool. And  Foley was knocking WCW for turning Mike Awesome into That 70's Guy ?? Anyway Storm vs Jericho offers some great wrestling. It ends  disapointenly though when Justincredible causes Jericho the victory with a kane shot to the back. Super Crazy vs Tajiri vs Little Guido ""Nunzio in the WWE"" has some good action too. Guido gets eliminated first by Tajiri, then Crazy pins Tajiri with a powerbomb I think. Rey vs Psychosis was ok but not as good as it could've been. Rey  beats Psychosis with the 6:19 but the fans booed because that wasn't his ECW move. Anyway in those matches amd Beniot vs Eddie, ECW reminds us that it just wasn't all about hardcore wrestling. It also had some of the best high flying action and mat wrestling.

  When RVD did his shoot, it ended with Rhyno goring him. Then Sabu made the save. Which setted up sabu vs Rhyno. Was nice seeing Sabu in action despite wrestling with a seriously injured back. Still he showed a lot of guts wrestling and did pretty damn good for an injured guy. He beat Rhyno with a leg drop through a table with help from RVD.
Chris Beniot then versed Eddie Guerrero. They're 2 of the best in the world. The match should've been made the last and given more time though. Both wrestlers I hear didn't like how it went. It shows too since they look pretty angry after the match. Beniot wins with the crossface in what could've been a better match. Then was Mike Awesome vs Masato Tanaka. All I have to say is, man I missed these guys going at it. They beat the living hell out of each and it's always 100% unpredictable which one will win. They kick out of a lot of nasty looking moves just when you think it is over. Awesome wins though after a power bomb off the apron through some tables. Then he dives on him through the ropes and makes the pin. Awesome then gets a big pop for power bombing the ref after the match. Awesome is another one that the WWE wasted and they knock WCW for wasting him ?? In WCW Awesome actually beat Hogan more than once which not many people remember.

  The Main Event was the Dudleys vs Tommy Dreamer and the Sandman. Before the match starts Enter the Sandman plays and Sandman takes forever to get in the rind as usual. Him and Dreamer lick some beer off of 2 girls cleavages and it looks like their tongues touched...eww lol. Anyway when the match finally starts it's the most violent and wild next to the Awesome/Masato match. Bubba cuts Tommy open with a cheese grater and wipes his blood all over his face. Tommy then cuts Bubba up to eventually. I don't even remember what the Sandman does besides drink lol. Anyway the match ends when the Dudleys put Dreamer threw a flaming table for the pin.

  Then Sandman asks for a beer. Stone Cold comes out and calls every ECW wrestler out to have a beer. When they come out Austin calls the WWE wrestlers to the ring. They finally come and the ECW wrestlers kick their ass. Taz who's wasted as an annoucher in the WWE gives Kurt Angle the Tazzmission. The Blue Meanie who's the whimpiest of the bunch gets brutally attacked by JBL. You don't see it happen but see Meanie bleeding afterwards. Anyway Stone Cold gets some beers delivered and the show ends with ECW wrestlers drinking. I really wish they do another ECW show because it was the funnest ppv in a long time.",1120176000,,4031,4.356
2314030,5,B0009RQSFK,"Ok, first and foremost, people need to chill out on the whole 'hating wwe and vince' it was after all RVD's idea to do the pay per view, and everybody who was involved in the old days was involved and it was important to them.  I personally thank vince.  On to the actual event itself, this was a truely awesome ppv.

Jericho VS Lance Storm-This was a good match, it wasn't a great match, but it was a solid match, and the fans were really into it.  Really cool to see the impact players together again, along with Dawn Marie at Lances Side.

Triple Threat Match-This match was one of the best of the night, I had never seen Super Crazy Wrestle before and he is absolutly sick!  (in a good way) He stole the show, I almost didn't recognize Mikey Whipwreck.

Rey Mysterio VS Psychosis-This was another great match, really nothing else to say except it was an awsome match, kept your attention.

Chris Benoit VS Eddie Guerreo-This was also a really good match, Eddie didn't seem into it or something, it had an uneven pace, to the point where the ECW fans started chanting stuff at Bischoff, during the middle of the match, but it was good.

Mike Awesome Vs. Tankana-I didn't expect much out of this match, I almost didn't want to watch this match, but I'm glad I did, this was one of the best matches I've ever seen as far as the match relates to a bigger picture, every ECW fan knows how Awesome screwed over the ECW by breaching his contract and going over to WCW while he was champion, and if they don't know, Joey Styles makes a point to remind them.  Awesome put on a truely great show, and took some amazing bumps, it was a true redemption, and to have redemption on something as crappy as he did, you know it had to be one hell of a performance.

RVD & Paul Heyman ""Shoot"" Promos-These were two of the best parts of the night, now whether or not these were actual 'shoots' remains to be seen, but they weren't like anything we've seen in the wwe before, as far as the smackdown and raw superstars reactions were concerned, usually a slam on the mic warrants some kind of over dramatic reaction putting the other person over, but there seemed to be some kind of legitamate heat there, (I.E Bischoff's finger reaction, Edge pointing out that Heyman said 3 words, when he said he had 'two' for him)

Sabu Vs. Rhyno-This was  a decent match, it was just cool to see Sabu and have an imprompt match like they did in the old days.

Dudleys VS Dreamer & Sandman- Regardless of the music entrance change, this match was awesome, to be honest with you, the bwo stuff and run ins at the begining was a little annoying, but the match itself was great, the Belulah run in and spot where her and dreamer double DDT'd the dudleys was my favorite spot of the night, it was this generations Randy Savage-Elizabeth reunion.

Overall it was a great event, Stone Cold's apperence was kick ass.  The wwe 'invasion' angle didn't swamp the whole show like many thought it would. Generally on great shows, after i see it once, I will go back and watch the best parts and matches, this DVD I literally just played it from the start again as soon as I was done with my first viewing.  It was great wrestling, with a great feel.  Highly recommended DVD",1120176000,,3232,4.385259631490787
2314031,2,B0009RQSFK,"Let me say straight off about the PPV itself. Amazing! You've already seen the match lists from previous reviews so I don't need to retread.

The matches in the first half of the PPV were mediocre, but then it really picks up and we see what ECW was all about.

I saw the PPC live, and now I wish I could get a refund on the dvd. To me the most energizing and incredible moment of the night was Sandman's entrance, barnone. He enters the stadium from the crowd as ""Enter Sandman"" plays, and as he slowly makes his way through the crowd the ENTIRE audience starts singing every word and goes nuts as he makes his way to the ring. Those 3-4 minutes were an instant classic and the best entrance I've seen of any wrestler.

And then Vince decides he doesn't want to shell out the dough to keep that moment alive on dvd, and decides to replace the whole thing with generic rock music! I was showing this to a friend who didn't get a chance to see it live, and all I could say after hyping this up was, ""uh, this isn't how it happened live..wth?""

The PPV is great, don't get me wrong. But for such a defining moment to be ruined b/c of Vince's greed over money vs. keeping this instant classic preserved on dvd for fans who didn't get to see it live turns my stomach.

Just be warned before you buy, and if you didn't see it live, you'll definitely see what I'm talking about when you see it for yourself.",1120089600,7,1401,4.193308550185874
2314032,4,B0009RQSFK,"While ECW may not be back, it is worthwhile to see the brand's top picks make one last stand! Vince is the big man who allowed this to happen, and as much hate as most have for him, he deserves a round of applause for letting Mr. Heyman do what he did best.

The PPV was very cool and entertaining. If you need to nit pic, it arguably had the worst opening theme of any PPV, showing just small clips and editing the ECW theme song to a mere 12 seconds or so. If you are a fan of the theme song, they do play it about three or four times throughout the PPV, most noteably when Paul E. made his way out.

Again, for those who are vintage ECW fans, the most valued area of the ECW show was the dedication shown by the fans at the event. We all helped get this PPV to happen by buying the Rise + Fall DVD, and it showed that the fans were there 100% throughout the entire show. It brings back some highly emotional memories, and no greater homage could have been made for ECW than to let all those involved take one final stab at performing for the fans the only way they know how...to the EXTREME!",1120003200,,1094,4.0368663594470044

Why would you want to screw all of the ECW fans out of there money. Dont tell me you cant get the rights to Enter Sandman, you have enough money to compromise with Metallica, i mean they have worked with them before. Dont waste your money on this dvd. Any true ECW fan would not and im not. No need to buy it if you ordered it on ppv. I never thought i would see the day that i would give an ECW show a one star and the show was excellent.

Only... where's the Roadkill/ Doring promo that they aired out of order. And why in hell did they need to edit out the "" Enter Sandman "" and dub in a bogus B.S soundtrack?

It's not only taken the crowd angle out of the disc, but has tainted the whole package...

I Vince Mcmahon... I hate WWE... I hate that this is what the fans are left with. Perhaps if Paul E was Fu@king his daughter and not Triple H, the product would be taken seriously!

This was easily the best PPV in years, and it was nice of Vince to have the balls to let Heyman and the gang have their night. There are moments that arn't the greatest, ie. When the WWE wrestlers arrive and talk, but other then that this was a great show. I won't give the results but heres a breakdown of the matches.
1. Chris ""LIONHEART"" Jericho VS. Lance Storm in his possible final match. 4/5.-Not a bad match wrestling match. The end was kind of cheap, but it was a good farewell for a under used wrestler outside of ECW.
2. Tajiri VS. Little Guido VS. Super Crazy in a ECW intnernational THREE WAY DANCE! 4/5 - This was just a fun match to watch. Great Balcany spot by the always entertaining Super Crazy! Involved Mikey Whipwreck, Sinister Minister, and the FBI!
3. Psicosis VS Rey Mysterio in and EXTREME LUCHADORE match. 2.5/5 It wasn't there best match by anymeans. Go back to 95 if you want to see some of there best matches. But still had a some great spots.
4. Sabu w/RVD and Bill Alfonso VS. Rhyno-4/5. Fun match, great spots, and the finisher was straight ECW! To bad RVD was to injured to wrestle. Other people said that he does the VAN Terminator in this match...NO! But he does do a spot!
5. Chris Benoit VS. Eddie Guerrero 4/5. A solid wrestling match, that is what you would expect from these two great wrestlers. Not there best, but still better then what you would find in a RAW or Smackdown Ring.
6. Mike Awsome VS. Tanaka 5/5. Match of the night. IF you have seen these two wrestle you know what you expect from this match. CRAZY table spots, CHAIRS...Ill give Mike props for showing his traitor ass in the ECW ring and he earned the respect of the crowd. In the words of Joey Styles ""OH MY GOD!!!!""
7. Tommy Dreamer and The Sandman VS The Dudley Boys -4.5/5 another great match. Great guest apperances. A good ol fashioned ECW match with some great spots! Blood everywhere. Its always fun to see a man use a Cheese graiter on another mans face! Plus CAT FIGHT CAT FIGHT! This match would lead into the finale of the show which was well worth it as the WWE and ECW wrestlers finally fight.
All i have to say is ECW ECW ECW ECW",1119916800,,2222,4.292857142857143
2314037,5,B0009RQSFK,"Regardless, this dvd is a must buy for any wrestling fan. Especially for the long time ECW wrestling fans. The only downside to this video is pretty much the lack of extras and the fact the WWE edited a generic theme over Metallica during the Sandman's entrance. The extras include all of the television promos aswell as an interview with a few fans before the event. The menu screen is pretty cool if that helps haha.",1119916800,,418,4.5131578947368425
2314038,5,B0009RQSFK,"I am so happy that WWE listened to the fans for the first time in awhile and let them have their dream of ECW having its one final show to go out with a flare that they should rightfully have, this is the best WWE produced PPV i've seen in a long time and its sad that it has nothing to do with the actual WWE product, ECW was and still is the premier company in professional wrestling in my eyes no matter what anybody has to say about it, like the great man himself Paul Heyman said ""You think you know what ECW was all about?"" You have absolutely no idea, it was completely counter-culture and it was up in your face the perfect mix of hardcore action and actual WRESTLING and was home for some of the biggest and most recognized superstars of wrestling today (Benoit, Jericho, Guerrero pretty much every mexican or japenese cruiserweight, Sandman, Sabu, Raven, The Dudleys, Mick Foley, Steve Austin, Shane Douglas, Taz, RVD, Jerry Lynn). This was one of the best nights of my life seeing the stars of ECW together again, i drove for 10 hours to go to New York to be in attendance and it was totally worth it(New Jack should've been there tho). You won't be dissapointed with this at all...that is unless you didn't see it live b/c they edited the DVD horribly but what did you expect it's WWE of course they're going to ruin it.",1119916800,,1332,4.353413654618474
2314039,1,B0009RQSFK,"WWE have horribly edited the DVD release of ECW One Night Stand.

They softened the crowd chants.

They boosted the microphone track when the Raw & Smackdown guys were talking in the balcony. So now you can't hear what the crowd is chanting, but can hear Kurt Angle & JBL crystal clear.

They removed Metallica's ""Enter Sandman"" song from Sandman's entrance, and replaced it with Ken Johnston psuedo-rock crap. Even though everyone in the audience is mouthing the words to ""Enter Sandman"".

I'm sure there's more things I haven't found yet.

Not Recommended.",1119916800,2,558,4.956989247311828
2314040,5,B0009RQSFK,"Although WWE plays a (thankfully) small role in this, it's still a WWE PPV. The true ECW reunion show was Hard Homecoming that happened a few days prior to this. However, this is a great show, and it blew away anything the WWE has put on for years..Joey Styles and Cactus Jack (Mic Foley) do commentary. I was sure the WWE would ruin this by their ""invasion"" crap angle, but instead it's pretty much all ECW except for the final 10min or so.. Also there are ALOT of surprise ECW alumni on the show, but I'm not posting any spoilers on who. If you want to know read the other reviews.. This review is for the PPV, I'll edit this is any of the extras on the DVD are worth it.. I tend to rate ECW matches higher than normal smarks.. P.S. If you hate blown spots and sloppy wrestling SO MUCH that you jump up and down and cry, sutract 1 star(*) from each match..

1. Chris Jericho Vs. Lance Storm - Former SMW tag-teamates. Really good opener! These guys were made to wrestle each other like Guerrer/Malenko.. Man this would've been a great feud. May be Storm's last match ever. :-( *** (out of 5 Stars)

2 - Little Guido (w/ FBI) Vs. Tajiri (w/ Whipwreck and Da Sinester Minister) Vs. Super CRazy - Poor Super Crazy is the only guy with a billion people watching his back from the outside. Eliminatio 3-way which means 2 Falls. Really fun and Short but Awesome match which the quick pace and highspots these guys usally have. ***1/2

3. Rey Mysterio Vs. Psicosis - Lucha Libre.. TO THE EXTREME! Nowhere as good as their past matches, but it was fun to see them wrestle again. Short also. ***

4. Sabu (w/ Bill Alfonzo) Vs. Rhino - Another short but really fun match. Rhyno (whino?) is upset that WWE released him for breaking a plant that he takes it out on the injured RVD. Luckily Sabu comes to the rescue! ***1/2

5. Chris Benoit Vs. Eddie Guerrero - Not really ECW, more like The best wrestler of RAW Vs. The best wrestler from Smackdown. Suprisingly slow..!? Guerrero didn't bring his A-game and they seemed to be going through the motions. Or maybe it just didn't seem ECW enough after watching the last matches.. **

6. Mike Awesome Vs. Masato Tanaka - Basically they tweaked all their big moves from their past matches. But like DDP says: ""That's not a bad thing.. That's a good thing!"" Awesome still looks awsome and Tanaka is like Jason from Friday the 13th aka. HE CAN'T BE STOPPED. HE CAN'T BE HURT. HE CAN'T BE REASONED WITH. ****

7. Dudley Boyz vs. Tommy Dreamer & Sandman - Ha, typical ECW crazy-ash tag-team brawl. :-) A bunch of people other than the 4 man make surprise apperances! Although a brutal match,  Perfect match to end the PPV with! ***1/2

I was smiling just because of how happy I felt at seeing all the past ECW gimmicks and happy to see all these new fans get a kick out of ECW.. (TO Vince McMahon: Please don't water it down Vince!:-(.. Let this be the only reunion show! At least for awhile!!",1119312000,2,2924,4.380073800738008
2314041,5,B0009RQSFK,"I'm not going to give a match by match analysis here. All I'm gonna say is that this is the best wrestling PPV Ive seen in years. WWE has put out some terrible matches, ppv's, and god awful wrestling recently (just watch smackdown... if anybody still watches it.) ECW was exactly what the doctor ordered. It was the only place in north AMerica this time ten years ago with great pro wrestling and after watching this PPV, its still the best pro wrestling in north america. Some reviewer mentioned how heyman and RVD's promos were just suck ups to the fans.....GIMME A FRIGGIN BREAK. Those were straight up SHOOT promos. No scripts, no writing teams. Those were off the top of their heads and straight from the heart. Those are interviews you will NEVER see on WWE. Do you think Van Dam can rip wwe the way he did on this dvd on raw or smack down? HELL NO! And joey styles isn't a good announcer?!? At least he knows the names to every wrestling move you can name instead of making up words like ""slobberknocker."" There wasn't a bad match on this entire card. The weakest match was prolly guerrero vs. benoit.....and if that was the ""worst"" match, how bad could it be. They always have good matches.

2314042,2,B0009RQSFK,"Foley saved the Night on the Mic, this Joey Styles is a bigger goof than Tazz and Cole together.

Chris Jerico vs. Lance Storm (w/ Dawn Marie). Sloppy Match the timeing was bad all Storm's fault since the little girl quit in ring action like 1-2 years ago. Credible comes out and hits a hard cane shot on Jerico the timeing was off on that as well, it was like Jerico was there waiting for it. Storm rolls him up for the win. 2 Stars

Little Guido vs. Tajiri vs. Super Crazy. Another off match, the ref was bad and out of place and not when he should hve been. the Timing was off too. Who won, who cares! 2 Stars

Rey Mysterio vs. Phsycosis. BAD BAD BAD BAD!!!! Rey wins. Bla Bla!! 2 Stars

Smackdown invades... BORING!

Van Dam comes in and bla bla bla, kissing the fans @$$. Rhino gives a mean gore to him which leads to an on the spot match when Sabu come to Mr. PPV's aid.

Sabu vs. Rhino - Very good match. Sabu does a high flyer to the outside. The ending was awesome, Sabu gives 'The Arabian Death Drop' to Rhino through a table! 4 Stars

Benoit vs. Guerrero. They suck to watch on RAW, they suck to watch on SmackDown, and guess what they suck to watch in ECW. Could care less who won I think it was Bentwat with the crossface.

RAW invaders come...

Heymen enters and sucks the fans @$$ more than RVD did. BLA BLA!! He did tell JBL that he was only champ cuz HHH didn't want to work Tuesdays (when SmackDown is taped) so that was very good. He looks at Edge and says ""I have two words for you--Matt Freakin Hardy"" what wa funny is that Edge looks at Paul and holds up THREE fingers and mouths ""that's 3 words"". Now that was funny.

Mike Awesome vs. Tanaka. Amazing matchup about time , a real ECW Match. A real slobber knocker, Awesome won, he used alot of hard impact moves. JBL wants him in his Stable and I think we will see Awesome again. 5 Stars

Dudley Boyz vs. Tommy Dreamer and Sandman. Great match.  The amazing finish of Dreamer going through a flaming table! 4 Stars

2 Stars because 4 of the 6 matches sucked @$$.",1119139200,,2034,4.158163265306122
2314043,5,B0009RQSFK,"First of all, I would like to say this is the only event I have ever rated a 5 of 5. I am a very tough grader, as you will see. ECW was back for 1 night only, and I expected to be dissapointed... I was so wrong!

  PROMO - Styles enters in what was truely a wrestling moment, he pleased the crowd with an infamouse ""oh my Gaawd!"". It was cool, then he said Foyley would announce with him.

  MATCH #1 - Chris Jerico vs. Lance Storm (w/ Dawn Marie) - Awesome technical match. Hand two amazing drop kicks (one by each guy). Credible comes out and hits a hard cane shot on Jerico. Storm rolls him up for the win. good stuff, but for storms last match should have been 5 min. longer. 6/10

  MATCH #2 - Little Guido (w/ FBI) vs. Tajiri (w/ mickey W. and Sininster minister) vs. Super CRazy - Let me say that Super Crazy lives up to his name with an awe inspiring moonsalt off a balcony! Interference was used perfectly, and Guido was on his game. Tajiri could have done better, but the finish was perfect. Good was to use an ECW three way Dance match in the card. 7/10

  MATCH #3 - Rey Mysterio vs. Phsycosis - very cool of Phsycosis talking off his mask in respect of the fans (even though I love the mask). Started slow, but the leg drop from the turnbuckle to the outside rail was amazing. Rey also does a pretty cool jump into the crowd. Rey wins with a 619 which was not cool, and the fans in N.Y. agreed. 6.5/10

  PROMO - Smackdown invades... JBL = BORING! Finnally Van Dam comes in and tells us that this suck's. He was okay but it was a little long. Rhino gives a mean gore to van dam which leads to an on the spot match.

  MATCH #4 - Sabu vs. Rhino - Cool match, short, but cool. Van Dam does some stuff hurt knee and all with a chair. Sabu does a high flyer to the outside which was sweet. The ending was awesome, Sabu gives 'The Arabian Death Drop' to Rhino through a table! Fun match, and best so far. 7.5/10

  MATCH #5 - Benoit vs. Guerrero - The sleeper of the evening. Don't get me wrong, this was a good technical match. This was just not ECW style. It seemed more like a WWE match, so it kinda sucked. 4/10

  PROMO - RAW invaders come... blah. Then Heymen enters and gives the greatest speech ever! talks about Matt Hardy in front of edge, tells JBL that he was only champ cuz HHH didn't want to work tuesdays (that was funny), and tells of Bischoff.

  MATCH #6 - Mike Awesome vs. Tanaka - 'OH MY GAAAAWD'!!! Amazing matchup. I didn't sit down the whole time! Match of the night by far! Bunch of table spots, and chairs used better than ever (in any fed). I believe this is the greatest match of all time! it was brutal, high flying, and everything was put in the right place. Tanaka is power bombed off the turnbuckle onto a broken table (it was very creative). Awesome wins when Tanaka is bombed out of the ring through a table!!! Then Mike dives over the ropes onto him! Amazing, best ever. My first ever rating of - 10/10

  Match #7 - Dudley Boyz vs. Tommy Dreamer and Sandman - Great match. simply brutal with a cheesgrader to dreamer! Then the ladder is used great. The amazing finish of Dreamer going through a flaming table! great tag team action, showed every aspect of what ECW was all about. 9/10

  PROMO - ECW vs. Invaders - not a good way to end this great event. I guesse it was okay, but this should have been done before the main event.

  OVERALL - WWE's greatest PPV ever (maybe even ECW's?). It was really good. Every match was placed correctly, and the promos were better than usual. Had the greatest match ever (even better than the cell!). Loved it... BUY THIS TAPE.",1119052800,4,3609,4.194767441860465
2314044,5,B0009RQSFK,"Finally wrestling has come back to the people! It's been to, to, to long since the last time I saw a ""WWE"" PPV (I put it in quotes because it was only technically a WWE event it was 95% an ECW show) that didn't bore me to tears. Was putting hart in an event soooooo hard? Give the people what they want. While not the overall best technical wrestling you'll ever see, if you want to see wrestling that really reflects what people want to pay to see? BUY THIS DVD. You get a real sense of why these guys go out and do what they do, not all do it for the money, it's certainly not an easy job. They do it for the love of the profession. They love what they do. Honestly wrestling fans (I'm sure already know this) need this DVD.",1118966400,,726,4.0137931034482754
2314045,5,B0009RQSFK,"Match #1 Lance Storm vs. The Lionheart (Y2J): This was Lance Storm's retirement match, and Mick Foley had made mention of this during the match. Good opener, and a great display of technical wrestling by these two. Lance still has it. The ending kinda sucked with the Impact Players coming out and Justin Credible whacking Jericho in the head aloowing Storm to get the pin! 7.5/10

Match #2 Super Crazy vs. Tajiri vs. Little Guido (Nunzio) in an international 3 way dance: Super Crazy was the only one without people interfering for him in this match, and he shined the most because of it! Crazy did an insane moonsault on the outside leveling out the FBI. Tajiri eliminates Guido and then shortly afterwards, Crazy gets the pin on Tajiri with yet another moonsault! I look forward to seeing this guy debut in the WWE!!! 7/10

Match #3 Psychosis vs. Rey Mysterio in Luchadore action: This was also a great match, but could have been better. But a lot of amazing spots by these guys!!! Psychosis is awesome and I am also looking forward to his debut in the WWE! Rey wins after a 619 and West Coast Pop! 7.5/10

RVD comes out and really gives a heartfelt speech about his time in ECW! He bashes the WWE wrestlers in the house and then says he is heart broken because not being able to take part in the PPV is the hardest thing he has ever had to deal with. Then out of nowhere...Rhyno GORES the hell out of RVD!!! Lights go out...Sabu is HERE! We have a match! 10/10

Match #4 Rhyno vs. Sabu: AWESOME! I'm glad we get to see one last match out of both these guys. Sabu is phenominal, eventhough his injuries from two nights earlier and pretty much his whole career have caught up with him! Some good spots here, and RVD managed to do a ""Semi-Vandaminator"" on Rhyno. Sabu does some botched leg drop with a chair on Rhyno through a table and gets the pin! 8.5/10

Match #5 Chris Benoit vs. Eddie Guerrero: I loved this match! It was a technical extravaganza!!! Benoit makes Eddie tap out to the crossface, YAHH!!! 9/10

Match #6 Masato Tanaka vs. Mike Awesome: HOLY CRAP! This was by far the match of the night!!! This was a SUPER spot fest! So many near falls it was unbelievable! The match should have ended about 5 or 6 times before it actually did, but these guys just kept on truckin'. I give Tanaka mad credit for taking all those cahir shots and power bombs. I thought he broke his neck at one point! Awesome finally finishes him off with a modified Razor's Edge to the outside through a table and then dove over the top rope onto Tanaka for the pin! Simply AMAZING! 100000/10

Paul Heyman comes out to a thunderous ovation from the fans and gives a great speech!!! He alsos says everything everyone has wanted to say to the WWE before he leaves...calls out Bischoff, Edge, and JBL most importantly! 10/10

Match #7 Tommy Dreamer and The Sandman vs. The Dudleyz: Great main event, and the very first time I've ever seen the Dudleyz get busted open!!! Before this match even started, we saw interferences and appearances by practically EVERYONE!!! The BWO and Kid Kash showed up just to name a few! Finally the match started and this is what ECW was all about! So so violent! A cheese grater, ball shaped barbed wire, and kendo sticks all came into play here! The Dudleyz win after putting Dreamer through a flaming table and did Tommy ever sell it so well!!! great ending to the show! 10/10

Then Stone Cold Steve Austin came out (not surprised at all) and lead the ECW locker room in beating the living hell out of the WWE wrestlers. Tazz got his revenge by choking out Kurt Angle while Austin laughed his ass off! Mick Foley then brought Bischoff out and he received the beating of his life! The ECW guys all celebrated with a beer and that's a wrap! 10/10

One of the best PPVs of the year!

The matches were all relatively short, but it made sense because they had a lot to fit into the show! It got a 89.5/100 which I'll round up to an A!!! Get this DVD, it's SPECTACULAR!!!",1118880000,4,3982,4.433652530779754

81 - 90 - Superb. An outstanding PPV, I highly recommend that you buy this.

61 - 70 - Good. A satisfying PPV. Perhaps buy this if you really feel you want it.

51 - 60 - Fair. An average PPV.  It is worth a look, not your money.

41 - 50 - Mediocre. A dull PPV. - Perhaps take a look at this if you get a chance, I don't recommend it though.

31 - 40 - Poor. An unsatisfactory PPV - Maybe for hardcore wrestling fans, not for anyone else.

21 - 30 - Bad. A lousy PPV - This is not worth a look from anyone.

11 - 20 - Terrible. An awful PPV - Stay away from this and make sure you never see it.

1 - 10 - Abysmal. An appalling PPV - This is just a waste of time.

ECW ONE NIGHT STAND:

Lance Storm with Dawn Marie vs. Chris Jericho: 7.5/10

A good, exciting match. A good opener to the PPV. Not very hardcore but an enjoyable match.

Rey Mysterio vs. Psychosis: 8/10

Great high-flying match. Could have been better but this was another solid match.

Super Crazy vs. Tajiri vs. Little Guido: 8/10

More great high-flying action. Super Crazy does an amazing moonsault you have to see to believe. Again I felt this match could have been better and longer.

Eddie Guerrero vs. Chris Benoit: 6.5/10

This was for the fans of technical wrestling. I'm not a great fan of technical wrestling but if you are then you will like this match.

Sabu vs. Rhino: 7.5/10

This match kind of disappointed me. I know sabu was in pain from the barbed wire match two nights before but this didn't feel like sabu. There were no crazy flips to the outside and the table spot at the end was kind of messed up. Still watchable though.

Masato Tanaka vs. Mike Awesome: 10/10

Holy crap. This match was amazing. I rewind this and watch this match over and over. This is what ECW was all about. Great hardcore action that will keep you at the edge of your seat for the whole match. The crowd really got into this one as well. Sheer brilliance.

Tommy Dreamer and The Sandman vs. Bubba & D-Von Dudley: 9.5/10

Another impeccable match. Again very ECW. Cheese graters, trash cans tables, road signs, flaming tables, chairs, and ladders. All the appearances by ECW wrestlers at the start also made the match very enjoyable.

Microphone time (RVD & Paul Heyman): 8/10

These were long so i felt they deserved a rating. These were great. Unscripted, personal speeches and all out attacks on the WWE. Great stuff.

SCORE: 65/80 (81/100)

According to the key i have rated this PPV as 'Superb', an outstanding PPV and I highly recommend that you buy this. I totally agree with this. Make sure you buy this. This belongs in a true wrestling fan's collection.",1118793600,,2815,4.326959847036329
2314048,5,B0009RQSFK,"Come on, you have to be just plain stupid not to like this ppv. The promos, the crowd enthusiasm, the brutality, and the emotion made this the best ppv so far of the last 2 years. So many great moments, one night that won't be forgotten, [especially by me]

Lance Stom [With Dawn Marie] vs. Chris Jericho:

A great match between two canadians. Technical wrestling at its finest by Storm, who looks as if he never left wrestling or that he has a reason to retire. Dawn distracts the ref which allows Justin Credible to nail Jericho with a singapore cane to have Storm win. 8/10

Three Way Dance
Super Crazy [who is just plain crazy] vs. Tajiri vs. Little Guido:

A great match between three great crusierweight size men. Super Crazy gives an INSANE moonsault off one of the balconies onto Little Guido and the entire F.B.I. Tajiri pins Little Guido thanks to Mikey Whipwreck, then Super Crazy gets the win after moonsaulting off the top rope onto Tajiri. 8.5/10

Sabu vs. Rhyno:

The only problem I have with this match was that it was too short! A hardcore dream match with Sabu giving huge chairshots to Rhyno, then Rob Van Dam gives the Van-Terminator to Rhyno after Rhyno gored him during a promo. The ending has Sabu give a HUGE legdrop onto Rhyno through a table in the ring for the win. 7/10 [Just for the time it was given.]

Rey Mysterio vs. Psicosis:

Not as good as their match on the RISE and FALL of ECW, but Psicosis gives a great leg drop onto Rey from the ring as Rey was on the barricade outside. Rey was injured so I give him props for coming out. Rey even jumps into the crowd onto Psicosis for another breathtaking manuever. 8/10 Rey wins with the 619.

Eddie Guerrero vs. Chris Benoit:

Another technical masterpeice between these two. Back and forth action, Eddie even bleeds a little from his nose it looked like. Two superplexes and a chair all give this match a 8.5/10 Eddie taps out to the crossface.

Mike Awsome vs. Masato Tanaka:

All I can say is that how can Tanaka have a head after those chairshots by Awsome? Good god, all those wasted brain cells.... This was tied for best matches of the night with the main event. About 4 tables were broken, and Awsome even throws Tanaka out of the ring through a table then dives off the ring right onto Tanaka for the win. 10/10 A brutal match

Paul Heyman comes down to the ring with a promo and attacks both Eric Bischoff, Edge, and JBL. Best lines in the promo were against Edge and JBL. ""Hey guys, hide your wives its EDGE!"" And the one on JBL, ""The only reason you were champ for a year was because Triple H didn't want to work tuesdays!"" A ""Thank you Paul"" chant started by the fans, a chant that Paul rightfully derserved.

The Sandman and Tommy Dreamer vs. The Dudley Boyz:

What can i say other than that this match was worth the money for the whole event by itself. The Sandman comes down into the ring from the crowd and the crowd starts singing with his entrance music.

The weapons included, Kendo sticks, trash cans, street signs, a ladder, two tables, a CHEESE GRATER, and, of course, a barb wire ball. Believe me you'll understand what I mean when you see the match.... The ending has the Dudleyz powerbombing Tommy Dreamor through a table SET ON FIRE. 10/10

[special appearances include: Beulah, Francine [Catfight!] Kid Kash, the BWO [Meanie has lost some weight] Axl Rotten and Balls Mahoney, and Spike Dudley] Kid Kash gives a great leap into the crowd of ECW wrestlers after a mini brawl happens.

Those were the matches, the only problems was that some of them were cut way too short. The Sabu/Rhyno match, and the Storm/Jericho match all could have been 20 minute classics, but they are reduced to less than 10 minute ""good"" matches. Oh well...

The reason they were cut short? The stupid invasion angles with Raw and Smackdown. I personally liked it better with ECW invading Raw, but I think it was Joey Styles who put it best, ""We have one night to shine on our own, and the WWE, who are already international stars, decide to come and not even give us one night of our own.""

Anyway, this is totally reccomended, and when you see the main event look for a guy smack his head repeatedly with Sandman's cane right after he appears in the crowd, its pretty funny.",1118707200,15,4259,4.470967741935484
