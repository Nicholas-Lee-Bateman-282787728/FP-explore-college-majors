8467814,3,B00125A5GG,The DVD is about the construction of the base. Don't expect to see much about the base after construction was complete. That is not what this DVD is about.,1424131200,,155,4.379310344827586
8467815,3,B00125A5GG,"I was stationed at Phu Cat from December 1967 - December 1968.  Video DID NOT SHOW any of the base in 1968.
Was disappointed.",1383696000,,125,4.208333333333333
8467816,1,B00125A5GG,"Shows very little of the base itself. A lot of staged Security Police action, most of which I have seen on other DVD's of Vietnam. I was stationed at Phu Cat 1968-69, some of the footage does not look like the Phu Cat area. Not worth the price in my opinion.",1322870400,4,258,4.078431372549019
