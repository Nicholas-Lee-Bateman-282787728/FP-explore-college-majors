However, I give it some slack since it was released during the time when DVD was still a pretty new format. The vast majority of the 4th series is very rare nowadays, so I highly recommend the DVD if you're either very interested in checking out the 4th series for the first time or want to relive childhood memories of watching it on NHK E-Tele.",1510617600,,523,4.458333333333333
