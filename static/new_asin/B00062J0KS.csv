8593334,5,B00062J0KS,"Upon the recomendation of my friend, I watched a screener he had the other day. I was reluctant due to the fact I've never seen a direct to video horror movie that had any redeeming qualities. This film suprised me, it's a unique film from the zomvies point of view. Also has a, strange love story if you can imagine that.... highly recomended.",1100217600,,344,4.476190476190476
