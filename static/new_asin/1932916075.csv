8427286,5,1932916075,"This fabulous nature documentary of the African savannah is ingeniously organized using interactive inserts. The educational narrative is enhanced with commentary by the biologtists Dr. Peter Apps and entomologist Prof. Eric Holm, making its use by classrooms excellent. Boys particularly liked the hunting sequences by lions,  leopards and hyenas, but it weaves a complicated story of life in Africa for birds, insects, cats, zebras, crocodiles, snakes, monkeys, and even fish. Beautiful scenery, haunting music. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1145836800,,533,6.0131578947368425

Overall I give it a generous 3 stars.",1144195200,,366,4.318840579710145

Let me invite you to enjoy an extraordinary documentary made by one of South Africa's top cinematographers and the added interactive experience - a first of its kind! Stunning images will show you the fight for survival in the African savannah. Never before has the dance of predation been captured with such clarity and painful beauty. In addition, you can interact with the DVD by calling up explanatory videos, which, narrated by biologist Erik Holm will provide you with a deeper insight into the Savage Secrets of African animals. Additional features include a `Making Of....' in which award-winning cinematographer Fanie Van der Merve invites you to join him on an expedition to film animals in the wild. Rounded out by a photo gallery, this DVD truly provides a stunning window on life in the African savannah. Enjoy!
