1806506,5,B00007D00L,"I got this a couple of weeks ago. I was looking for something that would stretch the major muscle groups and help with my posture (I have quite a pronounced ""swayback""), and it's exactly what I wanted. I've been doing the AM stretch most mornings and the PM stretch once or twice, and I've gained some flexibility and (perhaps more importantly) also find myself automatically correcting my posture throughout the day. The morning routine also includes some ""core"" exercises, so your muscles work to some extent too (good for getting warmed up in the morning).

 The routines are filmed in a nice setting (mountains), and the stretches flow nicely from one to the other. I would guess that there's a lot of yoga influence in there - however, it's definitely a stretching routine and not a yoga routine. The instructor is very good - she demonstrates the stretches nicely and provides constant reminders to check details of the stretches to get maximum benefit (but not in an irritating way). Each routine is 25 minutes, including a short warm up. There's a 20-minute bonus ""power stretch"" routine, but I've yet to try that - maybe after some weeks of the AM/PM routines.",1090540800,29,1169,4.810945273631841

1806534,5,B00007D00L,"I bought this DVD back in 2002 when I was 49...and I continue to use it 14 years later!  It's still excellent and has stood the test of time.  I have quite a collection of exercise DVD's and really respect Kathy Smith and her programs.  I'm still using them as well.  But AM-PM can help you get started being healthy.  When I first bought AM-PM, I was very impressed with its brilliant simplicity.  All three programs are fantastic and I really enjoyed the interview with Madeleine.  After using it for a few weeks, I went out and bought 10+ copies and gave them to family, friends and even my employees.  I really think pretty much everyone can do these stretches and will find them very thorough.  I've gone through difficult  times when I fell off the wagon but whenever I was ready to get back on track, this DVD was always ready and waiting to get me started.  Can't recommend it more highly.  Very professionally done and uses sound anatomy and exercise physiology too.",1478044800,,975,4.540229885057471
1806535,5,B00007D00L,"""AM & PM STRETCH"" has become a regular routine for this baby boomer who three years ago was diagnosed with end stage osteoarthritis in my shoulders and no cartilage in my knees.

Medical science could only offer me joint replacements and drugs. I choose to change my ways and began the practice of yoga and meditation.

The visual feast ""AM & PM STRETCH"" provides of mountain views and tranquil waters coupled with clear directions as Madeline Lewis  demonstrates delicious stretches rejuvenates, relaxes and refreshes body, mind and spirit.

This is one person doing the stretching  on the ground, on a mat-early 30s?-looking a few years younger than her picture on the back of the dvd box.  The picture on the front shows senior citizens type age.  Most of us senior citizens, while quite active and healthy, have a hard time being comfortable on the floor.

1806549,5,B00007D00L,"As a woman now in her 60's, I found myself not as limber as I used to be and wanted to improve my flexibility.  I tried quite a few other exercise/stretching videos and have found this one to work the best for me.  Not too difficult and I really notice an improvement when I do the routines.  My favorite is the PM stretch and I always sleep better on the nights that I do it and I wake up with less aches and pains in the morning.  The morning routine is good as well, but is a longer routine and I have early morning chores (feeding animals) and so rarely have time for it.

1/23/2017 Update:  I still love this video and I agree with another review that this is not something you do for 90 days and then quit, it works best if you can do it every day and continue.  I was seeing results and then because of life getting busy, I stopped doing it.  BIG mistake!  Now, I am back to doing it 4 - 5 times a week and I repeat what I posted earlier.  I always sleep better on the nights that I do the PM routine.  Instead of tossing and turning and trying to get comfortable, on the nights I do the routine, I lie down and to my delight - nothing hurts and I fall asleep.  So, I still recommend this video very much!",1472342400,8,1212,3.983402489626556

1806553,5,B00007D00L,"Have been looking for a ""stretching"" video for some time to help with flexibility.  I'm 63, and go to the gym regularly (2-3 times/week) with a primary focus on resistance/weight training.  In spite of this, I find that I just don't have the flexibility that I would like, and I've been feeling stiff and achy all-over most of the time.  I'm convinced that stiffness/lack of flexibility, as we age, leads to our becoming less and less active- then even more stiff- and less active as time goes by.  I had ordered the Tai Cheng video program, but it just didn't do it for me (and I wasn't interested in learning Tai Chi movements).  This program by Madeleine Lewis is a great stretching/flexibility video that would be appropriate for anyone at the beginner or intermediate level.  I'm feeling better after a weeks' use.",1465344000,13,819,4.732394366197183

1806555,5,B00007D00L,"I'm not sure why, but when I first got this DVD I didn't think it would be that effective.  Gosh, was I wrong.  This has been an enormous help: I'd lived with knee pain for decades until regularly using the A.M. section.  If for some reason I'm not able to do the program for a few days, I really notice the difference.",1463702400,5,319,4.112903225806452

1806579,4,B00007D00L,"Customers considering this DVD need to keep in mind that this is to help get your joints loosened and your blood flowing in the morning or to help you decompress after a long stressful day. For that it is an excellent choice. Madeline Lewis is a calm, competent and positive instructor.

I am a male in my mid-forties I cycle almost everyday I do sun salutations every morning (except Mondays when I do the AM Stretch) do resistance and calisthenics as well as kettlebells. I did P90X six or seven years ago and learned the importance of stretching. I have used this DVD once a week for the past 2 years. The stretches start out slowly and gradually work you from head to toe. You do have to be able to lie on the ground and get up, so keep that in mind. The instructions are good, the breathing reminders are also excellent, the only thing odd is the mirror cueing. It doesn't make sense when the video is shot from multiple camera angles. If it were from a static camera position then it might make more sense. Other than that, the music is fine and the scenery is good but most of the time you should be concentrating on the stretches and your breathing.

Stretching does not become obsolete, it is not a program you do for 90 days and then quit. If you want to live well into old age stretching is a good practice to make into a habit. And this video is good for beginners intermediate and advanced users.",1457568000,20,1409,4.35361216730038

1806624,3,B00007D00L,"While this is a good stretching workout, I think there are a couple of improvements that could have been made.  First--since not everyone is that flexible (which may be why they are buying this video), I think that there could have been modified stretches shown or ways one could do the stretches that would have eventually led to the range of motion Ms. Lewis has.  For example, in the leg stretches--could it be done with the help of a strap?  How would one do this correctly?  The second improvement would be to also give a shorter version.  Not everyone is going to wake up more than a half hour earlier to do these exercises every day.  It might be better to do 15 minutes daily than 30 minutes only on days off.",1437004800,,717,4.393939393939394

1806638,4,B00007D00L,I like this a lot but there are a few things that I cannot do (am 70) but I think overall it's a good one to intermingle with my other senior exercise DVDs. I especially like the a.m./p.m. versions so I can do a quick stretching when I'm too busy to do a whole 50/60 minute routine.,1431907200,,282,3.9649122807017543
1806639,5,B00007D00L,"3 programs about 20 minutes each. One lady does all 3, so the photo is misleading, there is no male doing the stretches. I ordered this for an elderly couple thinking it would be basic gentle static stretching. Having a man in the DVD would encourage them to both do it together.

This DVD is taught by a very fit young woman, and is mostly all Dynamix, movement stretches.  They are all great moderate, routines that target all the joints and major muscle groups. She uses traditional yoga stretches, swimmers moves, along with some balancing from ballet and tai chi. All English, no yoga type terminology, very easy to follow. No super fast movements, but she does flow at a good pace.

Great for anyone from new to expert in fitness, health, or stretching. The scenery is beautiful and relaxing.  The way the dvd menu is set up is kind of strange, but it's fine.  They split the routines into ""introduction..warm up"", so you can't just do the whole program at once, you have to select the program after the spear up, just a bit odd..  It fine though.",1431734400,4,1053,4.544973544973545

The time and co-pays for physical therapy are not necessary at all. I feel better.

Most of the stretches I had to modify or not due altogether because it hurt to do it. This is closer to a beginning yoga dvd than an every person stretching dvd. I want to explain what I mean by that. I've found most yoga poses to be complex and require a certain level of flexibility in order to even try it. Stretching requires no flexibility and completely depends on the individuals flexibility level. Putting you leg on a chair and leaning over it is a stretching move, anyone can put their leg on a chair and how far they lean over depends on that particular individual's level of flexibility. A downward dog stretch, believe it or not, requires a certain level of flexibility (and strength)  to get to the proper position and not risk hurting yourself.

1806703,5,B00007D00L,"Like most deskbound people entering middle age, I've been finding persistent aches and twinges creeping up on me.  This DVD has become an invaluable part of the regime to fend off these woes.

The regular AM stretching routine is gentle but thorough, and does help to build a stronger core.  As someone who has attended yoga and pilates classes on an intermittent basis, it's hard to comment on whether a complete novice would find this easy to follow, but I can vouch that it is a very adequate substitute for more ""hardcore"" workouts.  At a minimum, I've found that I am more likely to do this routine 5x a week than I am to attend a class at the gym even 1x or 2x a week.

The mountain scenery in the video is stunning, the music is a gentle way to get your morning started, and Madeline Lewis has a gentle teaching manner that is a pleasure to follow.  (Some cardio videos are too nauseatingly upbeat first thing in the morning.)  Her instructions are clear and well explained.

The bonus routine is excellent - a mild cardio workout that is just a bit more challenging.  I did nothing but this routine for a month prior to a 4 day ski trip this year and found it was good enough to prevent any major aches, perhaps because it improved my balance and core strength enough to help me ski better, preventing me having to use my quads too much.",1395273600,4,1345,4.391129032258065

1806705,4,B00007D00L,"I like that it includes a stretch over pretty much every major part of the body. She balances it out, if she stretches the thigh, she stretches the hamstring; if she stretches the back she stretches the pecs. she also includes a tiny bit of strengthening. like a 30 second plank. and holding a pelvic tilt with legs in table, then you touch your toes to the floor a couple of times holding your back to the floor. it's not hard. I had an injury when I first started so I had to skip a couple of things, but I've recovered and worked up to being able to do all of them now.
the music is nice too.
she does get left and right mixed up, but I don't mind. I have the thing memorized so I don't even watch the video anymore I just listen to it.
one complaint: she often takes more time on one side than on the other. for example when stretching the back of the leg, the right side has more time than the left.  I think it is so you can get used to it, or get your position right on the first one. but then when she switches to the other side there is not as much time. I'm used to it now so I try to even it out myself.
I don't care for the PM too much and mostly just want to stretch in the morning anyway so I only use the AM but it's still worth it.",1391731200,4,1247,3.8521400778210118

Madeleine Lewis does an excellent job with narration.  Her soothing voice guides you through each movement and breathing.  It's just one video which has an introduction, an A.M. workout and a P.M. workout option.  The DVD is not just for seniors.

As a former Group exercise and trainer, I am very particular about workout videos.  I'm a big fan of this one.  This is a great stretching program.

It's great for ALL levels of fitness as you can totally ""back off"" the movements/positions and do them easily if you have range of motion and/or strength problems, and if you're in shape, you can also take the movements and positions to the max.

What is pleasantly deceptive about the A.M. and P.M. stretches is that you gain a lot of strength and balance from them too, not just flexibility.

I would recommend however that if you're a beginner at stretching, to only use the P.M. Stretch section for a while, always using the warm-up section of the P.M. stretch too.

Then you can gradually go to the A.M. Stretch as requires a bit more strength and flexibility.  Always use the short warm-up section. I do.

My husband, who's 62, 5'10"" and 162 lbs., is an excellent skier but is not very flexible.

He started with the P.M. stretch section of the video and he's thrilled how his flexibility and yes, his balance have improved.  Great video!",1359417600,3,1116,4.507462686567164

This video includes stretches that require strengh and some balance. Although if you were a little lacking in this area, your continually use of the video would improve both. It is set outside with one female instructor doing the stretches. Each video segment uses a different nature background. The video is narrated by a woman with music in the background.

It's great that Madeleine keeps cuing you to breathe, because that a big part of my problem-holding my breathing and tensing up my shoulders. She also reminds you to relax your shoulders at the right times, too. In fact, her cuing is excellent. I find her voice and the background music soothing as well. There's a disc option to listen only to the music if you've memorized the routine. I still need her voice direction so I haven't done that.

I should explain that my muscles especially my leg/hips are very stiff and I'm not the most graceful creature on the planet. Even though I can't do many of the stretches to the degree they're demonstrated it does give me a goal to work toward. If you can't do the stretches, do as much of the movements as you can--you WILL see improvement. It's not supposed to hurt.

Most of the stretches are done on the floor, many of them on your back. If you do have a back problem that prevents you from lying down comfortably without a pillow, I'd advise not buying the DVD. If you CAN get away with lying on your back with a supporting pillow, I think you'd be able to do or adapt many of the stretches.

The DVD is well-produced in a beautiful setting and of course, music in the background that keeps your attention just enough while reinforcing the stretches being done. Madeline Lewis is an excellent teacher and gives cues just when you need them. I've used the DVD about five times so far.

And not nearly as much of a warm as it suggests. Also, the morning stretch while is thorough in leg and lower to mid back stretches, it  is not nearly enough for upper back or cervical neck especially for those that have any type of desk job.

1806810,5,B00007D00L,"I was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis and Fibromyalgia early 2011. I am in my 40's and could not get around as well as my own parents. The RA drugs were making me so sick I had to quit taking them. The loss of strength and range of motion in so many of my joints and limbs has severely limited what I could do. Lost my job. My home had to be modified with bars, and I have to use lighter weight dishes and pans and so many other changes. It's been quite depressing to say the least.

On my last visit to the RA Doctor he suggested yoga to help gain back some range of motion. In my search I came across this dvd and got it too. I love this one best!!!

What you'll see: a woman doing the stretch routine in an outdoor nature setting. What you'll hear: an instructor's voice describing the the series of stretches you see being performed by the woman. Also heard in the background is very pleasant instrumental music. What you'll feel: Smooth transition from one stretch to the next. The transitions from one stretch to the next are so fluid and logical. You'll feel aligned and ready for daily activity after the morning routine. You'll feel cleansed and relaxed, unwound from the days physical toll after the pm routine.

At present I am able to do 90% of both am and pm routines. My range of motion is drastically improving which will allow for more activity and improved quality of life. Strength will improve as well and I'll be able to move on to further challenges. Like the bonus routine included on this dvd: power stretch.

I believe that no matter what challenges I move on to from here, this dvd is a keeper and will remain one of my most frequently used dvds.

Another thing I'd like to add is that a good stretching routine can not be over emphasized. Even if you are a person having no physical limitations or challenges you'll benefit greatly from making this wonderful stretching routine a part of your life. It will enhance the quality of life you plan to live for a long time. I learned the hard way, but at least I've learned.",1325635200,18,2049,4.381578947368421

I have periods of time where I'm required to sit at a desk for 12 hours a day and struggle to handle the other activities of daily living.  When I can't do my regular workout, this video keeps you from going way downhill.  It's 25 minutes in the morning and again at night, to send you on your way and set your back to rights.  I think this would also be a great video for someone recovering from illness or injury.

Although this is certainly beginner level (a good thing), there is a bit of muscle endurance work in it. Not a lot but, trust me, if you really are a beginner, your legs will probably hurt a bit at the end of this. That can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on what you're looking for.

The second reason this one loses points is how annoyed I was about the PM workout. She spends a good ten minutes telling you to give yourself a foot massage. I don't really need a DVD for that - I need the DVD for stretching so that was a COMPLETE waste of time for me and makes that particular routine more or less useless for me (it's just  too short and there's not enough stretching).

Even though in pain, I decided to try the PM stretch.  I was amazed because, by the time I had completed the PM stretch, 85 percent of my pain was gone.  I was not expecting a cure for my severe backache.  The warmup for the PM stretch has some excellent exercises for opening up the hip/groin area which seemed to be exactly what I needed plus the rest of the stretches helped also.

Madeleine show the different exercises with a beautiful nature in the back ground. It is easy to follow her instruction. You can see all the exercises the instructor are doing, so you would not lose any of the details of the moves that are being done. I would recommend this video because I think it helps to build up strength and flexibility in the body.  I think if you have an arched down in the lower back, this video may help a little bit to strengthen this section.  I think also it can be nice just to do as an a.m. and p.m. stretch which the video are made for. Kind regards form Norway",1320192000,,777,4.201342281879195
1806832,5,B00007D00L,"I know about stretching, having danced until my 30s and doing yoga sporadically since then. I've taken just about every form of exercise class. A few years ago, however, I had to have a couple of cervical disks replaced because they were pressing on my spinal cord, leaving one pressing on a nerve root. I have had chronic pain ever since, particularly when I have a flare-up which is a positive feedback loop involving muscle spasms. I have done everything the PT told me to do.

I bought the stretch tape because I am not always diligent about doing the stretching I need to do. The tape keeps me at it. This stretch routine can be gentle but it also can challenge you. From the gentle warm-ups at the beginning of the routine to the final movement, it is great.

Only two quibbles: It would be nice if she had someone to demonstrate the movements for folks with less flexibility. I know how to adapt, but I'm not sure others would. Secondly, there is one point in the evening tape when I really NEEDED to do a ""child's pose"" to stretch out the lower back, but that wasn't included. So I would say to anyone buying this tape to adapt it to your own needs. Listen to your body, which will tell you what you can and can't do, and do what your body asks of you. Don't push yourself. Breathe into the stretch and LET the stretch happen, rather than make the stretch happen.

I did both the AM and PM workouts and OMG I love these!!!! My body felt so good when I was finished without hurting me in anyway. These workouts made me feel so much more agile as well. I did this for about a week - morning and night and was able to work my way up to more intense videos of the workout world.

You would think at this point I would no longer need this video...WRONG :) I still go back to these often for relaxing myself and soothing sore muscles from regular workouts. These are the best.

1806837,4,B00007D00L,"I got this DVD because I work out just about every day and I wanted to find a really good stretch video that I could do a few times a week to really stretch my muscles and relax my body. The reviews for this video were very good so I ended up getting this one. I will start by saying what I love about this video. It is really an entire body stretch in each segment (there are 2 35-minute stretch segments, one for AM and one for PM, I prefer the AM one), you really stretch each and every major muscle group and even small body parts you may normally forget about, like your wrists and ankles. I feel relaxed and refreshed by the end of each stretch. There is also a 20 minute power stretch included and that is a nice option to have on a day when you want a quick workout that won't kill you. The reason that I only gave it 4 stars is merely because of the coaching in the video. First of all she (Madeline Lewis) is confusing because on the tape she is always working the opposite side that she tells you to work, so once you get the moves down it is easier, since you don't have to look at her for direction anymore, but in the beginning it is VERY confusing. The other problem is that for much of the video she doesn't really explain proper breathing habits while stretching. I used to take a stretch class at my old gym once a week and breathing is crucial while stretching (fortunately I know to always begin to start to exhale right BEFORE you begin the contraction), so the fact that she doesn't really explain when and how to do it properly was disappointing to me, especially since it is such a relaxed video, there is plenty of time to explain the breathing. I do enjoy her calm, relaxing voice though and overall this video has been a wonderful addition to my routine and the way I feel afterwards is priceless.",1312934400,3,1824,4.214285714285714

Its very relaxing. The routines are about 25 minutes long and calming. The music is great and fits with the theme for the work out. I highly recommend this. There is alot of stretching but also some yoga poses through out the routines too. Over all its just a great DVD. Well worth the money and time. Good job Gaiam, and Madeleine Lewis! I like it.",1266019200,3,623,4.114754098360656
1806891,5,B00007D00L,"We *love* this dvd. It has three different stretch routines which are all choreographed so by the end of each, I feel a blissed out sense of relaxation and my body being straightened out, all without being too hard to understand or execute at my own level (after a few times through to get familiar). We've almost worn out this dvd, we've used it so much. I hope they never stop making it because we will need replacements!

The only thing I'd criticize is that there isn't more time spent on the neck; it seems geared more towards people who work on their feet than people who sit at desks all day. Having said that, there is not a morsel of time spent on anything I don't actually need. Every routine is packed with stuff that makes my body feel better and longer.

I love M. Lewis' style and demeanor and the solitude and peace of the way the scenes were shot outside with her doing a voiceover rather than using a mic during the routines. Even though I know the routines by heart now, being guided through them is a relaxing part of the process; I get to just follow along. Her voice and the music are soothing.

This DVD is worth its weight in platinum.",1265500800,3,1158,4.3271889400921655

1806893,4,B00007D00L,"I've used the DVD for about a month now.  I like the AM stretch, but somehow the PM doesn't do much for me.  The other reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that if you're inflexible (one of the reasons I bought the DVD!), some of the stretches are just impossible to do.  And, like some of the other reviewers have mentioned, there are a certain number of the ""stretches"" that are actually strength moves -- I use this after my Pilates or Core workout, so really just want a good stretch.  It's not a bad DVD, I'm not really sorry I bought it, but it's not perfect for my needs.",1260230400,,576,4.116071428571429
1806894,5,B00007D00L,"I had this as a VHS tape and loved it so much that I purchased it again as a DVD.  What I like about both the routines is their ease and effectiveness.  You don't rush from one position to another like some yoga routines.  Instead you have time to melt into the stretch which if you are as tight as I am is a major plus.  The morning routine is done initially on your back and you work toward the standing up position; thus, allowing your body a chance to really ""wake up.""  The evening one starts with more standing positions and you move toward prone on the floor; thus, allowing the body to relax and unwind.  Regardless of which routine I do, I always feel so much better afterwards for quite a while.  I would wholeheartedly advise someone to add this to their excercise DVD collection.",1259280000,5,791,4.340136054421769
1806895,5,B00007D00L,"I purchased Madeleine Lewis' am/pm yoga in video cassette format several years ago.  I've tried others but this is by far my favorite series!  I use both the am and pm routines equally and even mix them up........pm in the am hours and vice versa.  Though they have different routines of stretching I don't favor one over the other.  Fearing my video cassettes would wear out or break on me eventually I searched for it in DVD form and happily found this one.  The real bonus is the power stretching version which is terrific.

This may be too mild for heavy duty workout exercisers but would make an excellent warm up or cool down after vigorous exercise.  Madeleine does a terrific job of stretching the entire body.  I have very tight muscles, back spasms, bad shoulder and plantar fasciitis and have lost a lot of flexibility as I age.  At times I stray away from doing these and then wonder why I ever did as it feels so good when I do them.  When I'm on track they are a daily routine for me.  These yoga stretches have improved my entire body greatly.  If I wake with stiffness and/or back pain or over do strenuous tasks these yoga routines work out the muscle tension and stiffness and especially the pain.  Not only does it help these maladies of mine but my body is much more toned and my posture has improved a great deal.

Just a bit of a downside:  Madeleine does get her lefts and rights mixed up now and then and sometimes her easier alternative cues come later in the stretch but the quality of her routines cannot be faulted by this. I quickly overcame her miscues.",1257811200,3,1583,4.429065743944637
1806896,5,B00007D00L,"This DVD is a definite keeper. These workouts were the first that I've ever done that made me feel better afterwards, not worse. This is the first athletic-style stretch routine that I've done (I usually stick with yoga), but Madeleine Lewis has made me want to explore this genre some more. Also, the routines are not solely focused on flexibility. Many of the stretches require strength to control. The AM workout ends with establishing good posture while the PM one has a brief break for a foot massage. The scenery is as beautiful as you would expect from Gaiam, and the music is gentle and flows well with Madeleine's pleasant voice. Her cuing is very clear and straightforward, which is particularly useful because many of the stretches put you in a position where it is difficult to see the TV screen. I think that this DVD is really selling itself short; in addition to the two 30-minute AM and PM workouts, there is also a 20 minute ""Power Stretch"" segment. If you only own one stretching video, make it this one.",1252800000,6,1022,4.651933701657459

Madeleine does a good job of introducing the importance of stretching and very gracefully, yet effectively, demonstrates the ""how to's"" of it.  I appreciate her tender/nurturing tone of voice as well as her emphasis on adequate breathing thru out the session. The background scenery and music are definitely relaxing.  I've been stretching more now, along with proper posture and breathing, since incorporating this DVD.  It also includes a fast paced cardio stretch session for those who'd want the best of both!  I think a little more theory and/or research data on the topic of stretching from a medical perspective would definitely be a plus. One negative is that in the DVD narration whenever Madeleine refers to her right leg or hand or side, she actually uses her left hand, leg, etc. in the video!  Other than that, no significant negatives really stand out.  Overall it's a great value/DVD.",1252713600,2,998,4.975903614457831

The setting is outside and the music is very calming. No crazy workout girls with loud music! The two 30-minute routines flow really nicely from one stretch to the other and they are actually relaxing to do. You do get a nice all-body stretch and yes, the style is similar to yoga and pilates, but I wouldn't call these routines anything but stretching. This is nothing hard and you don't even break a sweat. I really have enjoyed the 20-minute power stretch. It goes by a little faster, with a little more intensity. I highly recommend this DVD for three wonderful body stretches. I also like 10-minute Stretch with Annette Fletcher, and the new Stretch and Joint Mobility Therapy also with Annette Fletcher. All three DVDs offer something different. The AM/PM stretch feels more like a flowing and relaxing stretch routine, 10-minute Stretch are quick routines that are just static stretches, and the Stretch/Joint Mobility Therapy is a more intense full body stretch workout routine. I enjoy all three!",1250640000,3,1164,4.9743589743589745

In my opinion, it's much more stretching than Yoga or Pilates, of which I also have several DVDs.  The instructor is easy to follow and the scenery is very relaxing. I use this after the 2-3 minutes stretch segments most workout DVDs come with these days. I find most workout DVDs don't offer enough stretching and this is a great compliment.

It has some similarities, in general, with yoga and pilates, or at least it seems that way to me, but is neither of those.

The AM portion is a gentle way to energize your day and get you limber.

My complaint, and its not really a complaint, I have another stretching dvd that breaks things into targeted stretches for places you need it and you can do 10 minute sessions or the full 30 minute sessions.

Stretching is really important, and so good for your body, as you get older you lose that elasticity and its really important to use or you will lose it.  And you want to be lacing up running shoes when your 80 right.  If you can stick to a 30 minute regiment and the is the most you do in a day, but it, if you need to longer stretching sessions that differ from regular routines buy it.  It is gentle, with stretching you only ever push your body as far as you are comfortable.  I do not have any technical problems or physical problems with this dvd, but I'm an option girl, so this is in my stretching video repertoire its not always first pick.

I should use the PM stretching more than I do though, its the only routine I have like it, and makes a bad day melt off your body. Gaiam videos are always top quality.",1231200000,6,1337,4.207843137254902

Then, I had a hysterectomy with complications. During the months of recuperation, I lost all my momentum. Over the next three years, I gained all my weight back plus 10 pounds and got so out of shape that I could not walk upstairs without effort. At my last visit to the doctor, my doctor informed me that I was border line diabetic and losing bone mass. I had to get back on an exercise program and lose weight.

It is hard to run after a baby when you can't move without pain and stiffness. I had been going to the gym for the last 7 months and had been doing the elliptical since it is easy on your joints. I have arthritis & bursitis in my hip and arthritis in my knees & elbows. These stretches are so wonderful for them. I was not able to do a couple of her stretches but worked it as best as I could. I was very careful on how I stretched since I had some painfull areas. I was able follow her instruction of stretching ever so slowly and easily and am now able to do most things I used to do when I was younger. I bought a Yoga matt to help with extra cushioning on top of my rug. I went to physical therapy as well. It was a breeze, my therapist was amazed how limber and my joints and muscles were so much better that most people even though I was and still am over weight I still looked good. Because of the CD I had strengthed the muscles and tendons around my ingered ones with the combination of all that I had been doing. I might not ever be 100% but I know that I have made myself more in shape than I have been in a long while. I am 40 now and I know that when I get to be in my 60-70's and older I have made my life much easier to function with everyday life. I am now able to run a little, play and crawl after my 14 month old that is a very high energy child. I religeously kept to a strict schedule of stretching and working out.

1806945,3,B00007D00L,"This DVD has 3 stretch routines.  Two are about 30 minutes and there's a shorter bonus workout included that's about 15 minutes.  The routines are easy enough that I believe a beginner could do them, although a few positions do require a lot of balance.  The routines are varied and don't get stale with repetition.

First, the good: the music on this DVD is amazing.  I love it and wish I could get the soundtrack.  It's relaxing without being boring, and it's mixed properly so it's never intrusive.  The settings and scenery are beautiful.  Almost all Gaiam DVDs have terrific music and scenery, but on this DVD, it was outstanding.

The not so good: Madeleine Lewis, the host, has a rather grating demeanor.  Her voice was very jolting and abrupt.  Any relaxation you might get from the music or settings disappears when she begins to speak.  Also, her instructions were curt to the point of being unhelpful.  It's difficult to do the stretches and watch the DVD at the same time, and you definitely need to watch the screen closely because you can't do the moves based simply on her vocal instructions.

I don't always have 30 minutes to spend on stretches, so I personally choose DVDs which have shorter routines that can be used in conjunction with aerobic exercise.  This DVD focuses on the stretch routine as the only exercise, unless you have a significant amount of time to spend on 30 minutes stretch and 30 minutes aerobic.",1188518400,16,1436,4.710843373493976

I have been using it for two months. I am at the point where my morning just isn't right until I follow the AM stretch. My stamina has increased and I am more flexible.  I still can't do everything as she does it. It is deceptively difficult to begin with. Don't overdo it but do persist.

The AM stretch only takes about 25 minutes. It emphasizes the hips, etc. for stretching. However, I was having the beginnings of wrist problems from compter use. There was enough stretching in the upper body and arms to make that go away.

I'm 32, and have been underweight and very flexible my entire life.  But even I needed improvement, and along with cardio and weight training, I've incorporated yoga and pilates into my recently revived exercise routine.

My feet hurt from high heels.  My quads are too weak, and I fear hurting my knees until my quads are stronger.  The stretches in the PM section for the quads and feet (love the massage!) were so good that for those reasons alone I'm committing to doing this every night to get the day's kinks out.

Lewis instructs you to start a stretch, contract a muscle, and then deepen the stretch.  I haven't seen this technique anywhere else, and I think it's a wonderful method for improving flexibility.

Unfortunately, it's only Noon right now and nowhere near bedtime.  I'm already looking forward to doing this one again.  One day I'll get up early enough to do the AM routine....",1173225600,14,1162,4.647058823529412

1806966,5,B00007D00L,"I am 34 and a chronic ""on again/off again"" exerciser. Lately I've been ""off"" and my flexibility has sunk to nothing. I would practically pull a muscle turning over in bed. So I decided before I started up exercising again I would have to stretch regularly and get my body prepared. I'm young but I'm not THAT young! I have issues with my hip flexors and sometimes my upper back and neck area, as well as my feet. And anytime I start exercising after a down period, I am extremely sore and stiff and it takes awhile for my muscles to stop rebelling so I can give it my all during the workout. I'd been told by my doctor to start a stretching routine and I never knew what to do on my own, so I did a search for a DVD and found this one.

A mini testimonial: I only started using this DVD a few days ago and have been faithful with doing both a.m. and p.m. routines. Yesterday I played flag football and was very nervous because the last time I played my hip flexors were so uncomfortable I could barely walk for several days. I'm happy to say that this morning I woke up not only pain free but able to walk! I can still ""feel"" that I worked my flexors from running during the game, but I honestly believe that if I had not used this DVD I would not be walking this morning! Madeline does great hip flexor stretches, which I  also used during the game in between plays.

Another reason I bought this is because I am going skiing over New Years and want to prepare my body for that as well. Based on how I feel this morning I'm confident that if I continue to use this, I will not only be more flexible in time for skiing, but also stronger when starting up a new regular exercise routine.

As far as the stretch routines themselves, they are very easy to follow and the scenery is extremely pleasant on the eyes. The music is soothing and soft, and Madeline's voice-over instructions are also calming and easy to listen to. I highly recommend this for anyone who wants to start up exercising again like me or anyone who wants to improve their flexibility. I wouldn't put a ""level"" label on this because you only stretch as far as your body allows you to go, and there aren't any complicated poses like in yoga. So it can be good for you regardless of your flexibility level.",1166313600,14,2272,4.252314814814815

Both of these DVDs were excellent and I still use them today, despite having purchased many other yoga DVD over the last year. Unlike many of the DVDs out there, these two will give anyone a good stretch, but are more geared to the beginner.

I like both the AM and PM workouts. They are each roughly 30-minutes in length. I'm not as fond of the additional 20-minute workout, but it's a free addition, so all is well. I'd gladly pay the asking price for just the two half-hour workouts.

The scenery in this DVD is phenomenal and the stretches are thorough. Very well done.

1806968,5,B00007D00L,I just finished the pm stretch and I feel so good!  I am relaxed and the stiffness is gone!!!  I like this DVD because there is no eastern religious feel to it.  It is pure stretch to soothing music.,1160611200,3,199,4.051282051282051
1806969,5,B00007D00L,"The scenery and the the stretches in the DVD are relaxing.  I  find that after doing the stretches a couple times a week over the course of a couple months my flexibility has increased.  I am a forty year old woman who enjoys playing tennis (and also suffer from arthritic stiffness every now and then) and I do these stretches to relax.  I appriciate the increased flexibility in my tennis game.  The PM is also fine at the end of the day to unwind.

update: eight years later from my first review  and I still use this video, which I can""t say about any other fitness video I have owned.  Mostly I use the AM stretch, and I usually do it every time before tennis.  The stretches in this video are fairly basic and not difficult (unlike some yoga poses I do from my yoga book).",1158019200,3,778,4.273972602739726
1806970,5,B00007D00L,"I have been feeling pretty crappy.

I got away from daily exercise and *sigh* I use to be in such great shape.  So, I have been walking 3-5 miles all summer trying to work into better shape so I can enjoy my vast library of workout videos.  My goal was to feel better and eventually get into shape again.

Walking 3-5 miles each and every day is pretty good, right.  I should be feeling pretty good again, right??  I didn't and I started to think that I had ruined my body and would never get to feel great again.

And then I started doing these stretch videos.  I think that is what was missing.  Before I did exercise videos every day that started with a short stretch and ended with a good stretch.  It never dawned on me that I needed to stretch.  I thought I had to work my cardio harder to start feeling good again.

I do these stretches every day (30 in the morning and 30 in the evening).  I feel taller.  My headaches have decreased.  I have more energy.

The instruction is great and the stretches work great.  With all of the dvd (and video tapes) that I have done there are still stretches in this dvd that I have never used that are quite effective.

I still walk every day and now I feel like I have a little more bounce in my step.  Before I could feel my calves ball up and now they are fluid.  It is a lot better than yoga.  I have done yoga and didn't feel as good as I do with this dvd.  It is a true stretch.  Although yoga gets a lot of hype it just doesn't make me feel as good as this stretch does.

The events that lead me to buying this DVD: I fell off of a cliff while playing paintball.  I dislocated my shoulder.  Months later I started having severe pains in my upper back.

Beautiful and peaceful scenery

Very professionally produced

Calm, soothing voice

Reminders to breathe correctly

Reminders for good body alignment and form

The former gives me a sense of centeredness and accomplishment to help start my day off right, and the latter leaves my body relaxed and tranquil, all the while increasing my flexibility. I really like the instructor, Madeline Lewis, and her narration is relaxing yet encouraging. (She narrates throughout each workout, over the music, and the video portion consists of her performing stretches according to her narration.) The stretches themselves encompass the whole body, and although emphasis is put onto the lower body, there are some upper body, and especially back stretches within each segment. Most stretches target a specific area rather than encompassing a larger, more general set of muscles, but attention is paid to many major muscles: hamstrings, quads, glutes, lower back, biceps and triceps, shoulders, and neck. Abs are not emphasized in the AM or PM workouts, although it seems logical that they would be in the Power Stretch workout, which I haven't looked at yet.

I would definitely recommend this video, which is calming and focuses one's attention on the body without being strenuous or difficult. You truly feel relaxed and refreshed afterward.",1094774400,16,1394,5.195555555555556

She is very clear in her instructions and is good for either beginners or intermediate students. The scenery is absolutely lovely in the practices. You have your choice of three different routines. One, the AM is a fairly gentle routine. I use it quite often in the morning to get me going. You do a short warm up and then get into the stretching. There are about 25 stretches and the practice lasts about 25 minutes. The second one is a PM stretching routine which again starts with a warm up, then about 15 stretches and then a relaxation/cool down, about 25 minutes. The third routine (extra) is a power stretch and very uplifting, lasts about 20 minutes. All of them are very good and useful for every time of day.",1091059200,342,823,4.5675675675675675
7975243,3,B00007D00L,"NOTE:  I have the older version of this DVD, with only Madeleine herself on the cover, but otherwise, the DVD is exactly the same as listed on the description here.

I recently came across this DVD at a used book sale.  As a yoga instructor and avid practitioner, I already get plenty of stretching movements as part of my exercise regimen, but I am always looking to do more.  This DVD had great reviews, so I thought I would give it a try.

This DVD is actually a compilation of two prior DVDs, AM Stretch and PM Stretch, both by Madeleine Lewis.  A bonus ""Power Stretch"" is also included on this DVD.  For all three routines, Madeleine is alone, teaching via voiceover in several different scenic outdoor settings.  The DVD insert helpfully lists all of the exercises in each routine; I have reproduced this below, along with additional comments.

***AM STRETCH***
The Main Menu for this routine lists Introduction--Warm-up--AM Workout--Postural Awareness.  It is supposed to be designed to help with morning stiffness and to improve circulation.  The Warm-up includes Shoulder Shrugs--Deep Breathing--Spine Stretch.  Here is the list of exercises for the workout:  Alternating Knee-to-Chest Stretch--Ankle Circles--Back Stretch--Hip Stretch--Arm Circles--Pelvic Tilts--Core Strengthening--Torso Twist--Hamstring Stretch--Buttocks Stretch--Quadriceps Stretch--Hip Rotator Stretch (right)--Butterfly--Neck Stretch--Hip Rotator Stretch (left)--Abdominal Stretch--Plank--Shoulder Stretch--Back Stretch--Hamstring Stretch--Triceps Stretch--Side Stretch--Deltoid Stretch--Chest Stretch--Wrist Extension--Postural Awareness.

I feel uncertain about the intended audience for this routine.  Personally, as a long-time daily exerciser, I found that some of the stretches were much too mild for me.  At the same time, this ""stretch"" workout also includes quite a bit of core-strengthening work...not only was this somewhat intense, but also it seemed out of place in a ""stretch"" routine.  Finally, this workout was a total of 33-minutes, almost 10 minutes longer than the claim on the DVD.  Since I like to add stretch onto my other workouts, the length of this routine was prohibitive.

***PM STRETCH***
This routine had a similar sub-menu, this time listing Standing Warm-up--PM Workout--Cool-down.  It was also supposed to be just 25 minutes but was even longer than the first routine, coming in at 34 minutes.  Again, I found this not at all suited to be an ""add on"" stretch workout.  The description said that this routine is designed to ""calm and soothe your mind and body.""  It was also supposed to consist of slower, deeper stretches, which I did NOT find to be the case, at least not until the very end.  Instead, Madeleine moves through mostly dynamic stretches, similar to AM Stretch.  The warm-up moves included Arm Raises--Chest Stretch--Shoulder Circles--Lower Back Stretch.  The moves from the remainder of the workout are listed as follows:  Knee Lifts--Ankle Rotation--Hip Flexor Stretch--Runner's Lunge--Wrist Stretch--Quadriceps Stretch--Back Extension--Side Stretch--Hip & Back Stretch--Seated Spinal Twist--Seated Buttocks Stretch--Ankle Stretch & Foot Massage--Prone Back Series--Inner Thigh Stretch--Prone Spinal Twist--Hamstring Stretches--Relaxation--Mermaid (Side) Stretch--Shoulder Circles--Triceps & Deltoid Stretch--Neck Stretch.

I thought that this routine could have ended with the relaxation (which is brief), as the final seated/standing moves did not seem to add much.  The foot massage was nice, and I liked the prone series on the back, but as noted above, the stretches are mostly dynamic, not held very long at all.  I definitely have yoga routines that I like much better than this, particularly for relaxing in the evening.

***BONUS POWER STRETCH***
""Power"" seems like a very odd name for any type of stretch segment!  The description on the menu states that this segment ""flows faster to build strength and improve flexibility,"" but I found the pace quite similar to the other two segments.  It is also billed as a blend of dynamic and static stretches, but that's basically how the entire DVD is performed, so nothing really new here.  That being said, I did think that this routine included some nice balance moves not seen in AM or PM Stretch.  The DVD insert does NOT list the exercises for this bonus, but Madeleine starts standing with some dynamic moves for the whole body, adding in a balance element.  She performs several versions of lunges, moving in and out of plank and adding an opposite side twist.  The floor exercises include spinal rolls, bridge, and hamstring stretches.  Madeleine concludes this routine standing for more balance work plus some brief wrist/hand stretches.  It does clock in almost exactly at 20 minutes.

Overall, I found these routines to be just okay.  I definitely didn't find the stretches here to have any special advantage over my usual yoga practice, and in fact I feel more thoroughly stretched out by the latter.  I also had some problems with Madeleine's instruction.  First, she attempts to offer mirrored cuing, but this is often out-of-sync due to both the camera angles and her errors.  Second, I found that her cues often came late--e.g., she would tell you that you were doing a balance move only after she was already IN the move.  Also, her cues were just not very helpful in general, offering little beyond ""go further.""  Finally, I was disappointed in Madeleine's form.  For the PM routine in particular, I noticed her knee collapsing inward while she was going lunges.  She also frequently thrust her ribs out in almost ALL movements, throwing her entire body out of alignment. :o

Even if you don't like yoga, I think there are much better stretch options available.  I'm not sure if I will keep this DVD and am not sure that I can recommend it.",1526256000,,5841,5.3858875413450935

There is also some bouncing, which is not good for those with flexibility issues. I much prefer ""Total Body Stretch For Beginners with Tamilee"".

7975251,4,B00007D00L,"If you are looking for a routine that first warms up the muscles before stretching you really might like this DVD. There are two main sections, one for morning stretches and one for night. I find I enjoy the night stretches more and can do them anytime of the day. Some ""other"" routines I've tried are too fast, the stretches are held for too short a time and you don't feel relaxed. This set of two stretch routines by Madeleine Lewis are different.

Stretches are held for enough time that you feel you are really getting the benefit from them. Also you don't have to twist yourself into a pretzel to do these stretches. Some movements are inspired by yoga but are not that difficult. I felt this was a slow easing into stretch that is appropriate for people like me who are approaching 50. I no longer enjoy fast stretching, I want to take my time.
