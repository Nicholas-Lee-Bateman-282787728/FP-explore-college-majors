8747872,5,B01AO4Y2YQ,"Excellent film.  A small indie budget with no name actors, but this movie stands up to anything mainstream Hollywood has to offer.  Exciting, unpredictable, and keeps you thinking about it long after.  A strong condemnation of the abuse of power that everybody should see.",1470700800,2,272,5.136363636363637
