1342192,3,B00004RE86,A light farce of a jungle goddess hunted for her inheritance and treasure. Not a bad movie for the this type of movie. Nudity included.,1259539200,5,135,4.44
1342193,3,B00004RE86,"This movie had to be a drivein special. The women were georgous but that's where it ended. Hamilton Hornee has
benn hired by the Wabash bank in Indianapolis to travel to Africa and find a missing Matthews heir named Prentiss. He is accompanied by his secretary Sultry Sommers,Tender Lee and two more heirs Max and Doris Matthews.
Also traveling with them on the trip is Dr. Stanley Livingston who wans to search for Nabucco the white gorilla.

1342194,4,B00004RE86,"Friedman's spoof of Hollywood 'jungle movies' is over 30 years old, but it still holds up as both comedy and 'adult' fare.
There's a fair measure of toplessness and multitudes of bare behinds, particularly among the jungle denizens, so this film is not for the kiddies (unless you're a rather progressive parent).  What makes the film memorable, however, is its outrageous treatment of that timeless Hollywood genre wherein Anglo-Americans venture into savage territory for treasure or to capture some legendary creature (e.g. King Kong).  Friedman (who wrote the screenplay) pulls out all the stops here, making TRADER HORNEE both a masterpiece of political incorrectness (stuffed with questionably racist & sexist jokes) and a harmless confection of tame eroticism.
Blond siren Deke Sills (""Algona"") never made another film, but she's a great amateur actress - greatly amateur, if you get my drift - and a balm to the soul.  If you're red-blooded, full of pep and ambition, and a fan of matinee-style jungle adventures, you don't want to miss TRADER HORNEE!
The DVD includes the 8-minute film trailer - a classic of pulchritudinous self-congratulatory rhetoric - and an informative though low-key audio commentary by Friedman & Something Weird's Mike Vraney.  You'll watch it more than once, and that's saying something!",1052092800,14,1322,5.311004784688995
1342195,4,B00004RE86,"This movie is incredibly ahead of it's time.  Considered porn in it's day due to nude females and ""adult"" language, it is no more shocking by todays standards than a Madonna video. It is the comedy that sets this one apart from the crowd.
This is ribald comedy in the classical sense, peppered with 1960s taboos and social commentary, but serving up the sight gags and asides when you least expect them.
A Dave Freidman classic.",978825600,15,428,4.631578947368421
7920842,4,B00004RE86,"Trader Cornee would be a better title. Trader Hornee (the Es are silent) & his loyal secretary head to Africa in search of a missing heiress. Hijinx, one-liners, & rimshots galore. Thankfully there's no canned laughter. Not sure why this movie was made other than for fun. It's billed some places as adult but aside from some boobs & non-explicit situations should barely be R rated. All said it's a fun way to waste about an hour & 20 minutes. Where's the crackers?",1514592000,,466,4.626506024096385

7920845,4,B00004RE86,Comedy of the 1970's type with some sexual exposure.  The women are attractive. I recommend this if that is what you are in to.,1472083200,,127,4.291666666666667

I would only recommend it to people who enjoy extremely low budget films.",1468540800,,153,4.275862068965517
7920847,1,B00004RE86,"Do not waste any money buying this. Worth a look for free, maybe. Rotten, bottom of the barrel, horrible ""jokes"" and script. Awful pacing. Looks worse than a super 8 movie directed by a 7th grader. Has some full frontal female nudity, and some of the women are worth a look. Some are not. One has a body that looks like some sort of alien, with weird pointy evil knockers and triple flesh folds around the middle. Face = human, body = mutant. David Friedman had our movie watching group disinterested in the first 5 minutes. Really really bad.",1454371200,,543,4.494949494949495

7920851,5,B00004RE86,"Not the type of comedy you bust out laughing at but one you find yourself chuckling a lot at. This is an sexploitation picture with a great sense of humor. The story is about a down on his luck detective and his mistress secretary who deeply in debt accept an assignment in Africa to find a missing heiress who turns out to be a jungle goddess of a flesh eating tribe. They take along a newswomen who is boffing the banker who hired them,a scientist who lives with 2 playmates and a leecherous cousin and his mistress who will inherit the fortune if the heiress isn't found. Their guide is a broken down drunken bum who was once a great hunter. On the way to find her they have various sexual liasons. No real down below nudity but plenty of topless good looking female nudity. The thing that sets this movie apart from most sexploitation is the good natured comedy throughout. One of my favorite movies ever.",1311984000,5,909,4.449101796407185
