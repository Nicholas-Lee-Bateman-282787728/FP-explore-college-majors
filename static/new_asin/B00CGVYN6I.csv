8581656,5,B00CGVYN6I,"My 2 1/2 year old daughter absolutely loves Bo on the Go she will watch and at least five shows in a row acting out with Bo every time. She asks for it all the time. She started watching it when she was 16 months and she actively recruited and still recruits anyone around when it is on to be Bo Buddies she even got her Dr to be a Bo Buddy at one of her check ups. I love it too because it gets her up and moving instead of just sitting there staring at the tv and being lazy. It's great for rainy and cold days where she can't go outside, but I have to hide it from her on sick days because she is an avid Bo Buddy and as she reminds me, ""Bo Buddies help Bo."" The only issue I have is I wish they had more episodes and movies for a little more variety. She is also getting into Tree Fu Tom for older kids and trying to do Tree Fu with Tom This is for like 2-4 while Tree Fu Tom is like 5-8.",1410652800,,892,3.7
