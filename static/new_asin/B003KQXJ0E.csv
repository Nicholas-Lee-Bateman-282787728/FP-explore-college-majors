I had read the manga this was based on and while there are some differences I think I prefer the more grownup treatment of this drama. And even knowing how it was going to end -- how it had to end, really -- I totally enjoyed the ride. Recommend to anyone who enjoys light romantic comedy.",1395446400,3,414,4.32051282051282
8533570,5,B003KQXJ0E,"Let me just say, in my opinion, the manga was better. Riko was so mean to Night in the drama! She took absolutely no interest in him at all and she didn't really start to warm up to him until the end. If he was broken, she wanted him fixed, but then she'd go right back to dogging him. At least in the manga, she liked him almost from the very beginning.
Night is really sweet throughout the whole series. He does this thing where he flexes and says, ""Am I sexy?""
It's too funny!!!
I LOVE Mizushima Hiro, so I fell in love with Soshi's character, but I have to admit, if it wasn't Hiro playing Soshi, I probably wouldn't like him. He's nothing like the Soshi in the manga, but he had some really good points...
Masaki is actually Soshi's older brother in the live-action. You almost want to hate him for being so hard on Soshi, but it's all good.
If you read the manga and you cried at the end, you'll definitely break down crying at the end of this too.",1335052800,3,954,4.162162162162162
