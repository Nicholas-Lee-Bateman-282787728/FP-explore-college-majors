It always cracks both of us up and provides me with a much-needed break from college and mom with a much-needed visit from daughter. I <3 this show!",1289088000,15,290,4.388888888888889
4138297,1,B003L77G06,"I purchased this DVD primarily because Ed O'Neill was in it and TV Guides ""the funniest show on TV"", expecting to at least crack an occasional smile.
The ""joke"" was on me. This season DVD will go to the friends of the library and has, in my opinion, been a complete waste of my time watching it together with the money spent to purchase it. Not recommended!
Mr. O'Neill was a natural on Married with Children. What a great character he was on that ""FUNNY"" sitcom.",1289088000,10,463,4.395348837209302
4138298,5,B003L77G06,The actor who plays the chubby gay guy and the actress who plays the Columbian wife just won best supporting actor Emmys and you can see why with this second season opener.  They are hilarious from the moment they first appear on screen again. She is a stymied Latin mother as her son discovers girlfriends and he fears for his life as his partner tries to build a child's castle with power tools despite no skills with same.  The rest of the gang is great too and I'm very happy this weekly hilarity is back.,1285372800,6,509,4.347368421052631

4138600,5,B003L77G06,"I love this show and all the gifted characters.  It has kept me laughing  For this reason, I want to make this a sharing moment and not a harsh scolding.  I was shocked and disgusted by Cam's efforts to use my peoples' name and culture to get an empty laugh during what should have been a very beautiful and heartwarming scene.  Too bad he wasn't wearing a team shirt of the Cleveland Indians or the Washington Redskins to make the moment truly biting.  I was proud of these characters for righting any perceived insults against gays, but now I am heartbroken.  I am asking the Great Spirit to forgive this unspeakable lapse in judgement.  We will get past this, and I will continue to enjoy a very wonderful program.  Your faithful viewer,

The kids have all grown out of their cute phases and just Come off as sarcastic spoiled brats by this point , so as obsessed as I am (or once WAS )with the show my family and I all agree it's ...*sigh* Jumped the shark.

Modern Family is one of those shows.  I tried watching an episode with my daughter and at first didn't like it.  It was almost two years before I happened across a rerun on TV.  It was the first episode of the first season - I have been hooked ever since  There is a scene where a parent reprimands their child for shooting one of their siblings with an airsoft gun - even though it doesn't sound like it would be hilarious - it was.  The characters are loveable and I find myself wishing I could be a part of their extended family.

4139825,5,B003L77G06,"This is a television miracle. First, look at the creators: Steve Levitan (Just Shoot Me) and Christopher Lloyd (Frasier, Soap, Back To The Future et al) who are the Coen Brothers of half hour comedy. So the script structure is flawless.
  By the middle of this season we are in love with these flawed, loving characters. Yup. The writing. (Staff writers and producers-saame thing-include Dan O'Shannon, CHEERS and FRASIER, Danny Zuker, Bill Wruble and others-only two are women) But it's elevated by an ensemble cast of brilliant actors ranging in age from 11 to 93. Ed O'neil's worth more than a mention because we thought of him only as the stereotype sexist role on ""Married With Children."" I only saw two episodes of that but the difference in the two characters is worthy of Meryl Streep. The children actors ACT. They're far more than cute.  The direction (single camera) is by Michael Spiller and on a par with Jimmy Burrows. The editing is on the same par. From the brilliant theme music to the revolving logo for Lloyd and Levitan every second of ""Modern Family is fun, funny, brilliant and captivation.
  It breaks new ground. In a mockumentary style alkin to Christopher Guest (This is Spinal Tapp, Waiting For Guffman and Best In Show) the actors shine in their ""interview (an aside ""whisper"" for us) segments whether full minute secquences or just an expression. We see three normal familes, all related (Ed plays the Patriarch married to his second wife and her 12 year old son; she a bassy, bright bombshell of hot with her heart on her sleeve; the boy, a metropolitan ladies man with metrosexual clthes, a penchent for Turkish coffee and ties and pocket squares for his many suits. Manny's a lover.) each family is about the characters. Dad's ex-wife is the remarkable (and still gorgeous Shelly Long) his son and daughter have their families, Claire, a beautiful if not anxious mother of three teens who's married to a mildly dorky fFather who likely keeps a box of keepsakes and son Mitch, an uptight if not anal retentive attorney in a new relationship with Cam, a once music teacher with no inhibitions and now stays at home dad to their cute, adopted daughter, Lily who has forced change and energy into their home.
  This is everyone's extended family, with the quirks, the mess ups (Phil accidentally advertises his wife and daughter on their minivan as escorts.
  Ahem.)
  So we now relate to them and, frankly, wish our families were as close and in love as this one.

That being said, this show is my go-to comic relief. I can watch the same episode ten times and still find something new to laugh about. The characters become like actual family to you. You can predict their responses to certain situations but it doesnt make the show predictable. It makes it comfortable  Like coming home to your favorite chair after being on a long business trip.

4141066,5,B003L77G06,"TV feels inundated with sitcoms, but Modern Family manages to rise about most of the crowd with its interesting characters and unique brand of humor.  From the opening episode I was hooked, with each of the three families being followed offering a different 'feel' but each being equally funny.  The show follows a format of three separate storylines in most episodes, which it usually manages to tie together in the end with some kind of unified theme.  It is an interesting format, and the writers have really made it work.

Season 2 is well worth checking out if you were a fan of the previous season.  The families manage to grow and adapt just enough to keep their characters interesting, but without hurting the original formula that makes the show work.",1397520000,,760,4.770992366412214

4141071,5,B003L77G06,"The characters are all pretty people with great comedic timing, but the secret to the hilarity on this show is the writing.  Watch these episodes more than once and listen carefully, oftentimes the writing reaches comedic genius.  Love all of the characters.  While this is nothing like real life as you watch it, when you think about it it is so real it is scary.  Watch a couple of episodes on TV and you have to have this, trust me",1395446400,,434,4.3875

4141162,5,B003L77G06,"This is IMO one of the very best sitcoms of all time.  the most striking thing to me is that from the very first episode, these characters are fully developed.  If you had never seen this show and you watched episode 1, season 1, you would think you were at least in the second season.  The characters continue to develop, but if you watch from the beginning, it is almost seamless.  there are so many great characters in this series, every single episode is a treasure of comedy.  And the recurring characters, in particular Nathan Lane's ""Pepper"" are priceless.  Even tho you can watch this pretty much 24 hours a day in syndication, it is well worth buying.  No commercials and no cutting the very funny endings that often get cut on tv reruns.  So worth it!",1393718400,,761,4.5036496350364965

4141320,5,B003L77G06,"I love this show. I not only love everyone and all the family dynamics, I am so impressed that each character from Jay to Lily is so fully developed. I couldn't imagine the show without a single one of them. If someone were to ask me who the star of the show is, I would be hard pressed to identify the 'one.' They are all leads. Every story is funny, sometimes laugh out loud funny, the relationships and the situations hit all too close to home. The stories are well written, with a surprising amount of depth in spite of the light-heartedness of the show. In my opinion, Modern Family delivers better than any typical sitcom. It is fun, intelligent, touching, and genuine, and always makes me eager for the next episode.",1389830400,,723,4.484848484848484

I had to watch from the beginning and am currently almost finished with season 3 after a couple of weekends of binge watching. This show is so funny. There is a bit of caricaturing of the characters but it works and the show manages to stay fresh. I've watched all the episodes of season 5 on Hulu and I think this has real staying power. This was exactly what I needed, which is why I have bought 4 seasons to stream. I can watch these episodes over and over.",1388793600,,548,4.278846153846154

4141686,5,B003L77G06,Modern Family is one of the best comedies airing on tv today. Hilarious and moving. Ty Burrell as Phil Dunphy steals the show in my opinion. Must see if you are one of the few who have yet to watch this modern classic.,1377820800,,218,4.093023255813954

4141691,5,B003L77G06,"In my opinion, Modern Family is one of the best written, acted and directed TV shows in a very long time.  It contains that rare combination of very smart, creative writers and talented actors (across the board) who mesh very well together.

With a few rare exceptions, I enjoy almost every episode and laugh out loud quite often.  That is the sign of a great show.  Season 2 is fantastic.",1375228800,,389,4.514285714285714

4141766,5,B003L77G06,"I really like that there is no laugh track. The pseudo/-doc style is like The Office - another show I enjoyed. Because I came so late to this series, I get to watch as many episodes as I like, one after the other, without having to wait for next week. The characters just grow on you. It is quite an endearing show.",1372636800,,315,4.096774193548387

But what I really love about this show is how instead of everyone working against one another like they do on other family based sitcoms, on this show they all pull together when needed and there is love between them. Also many of the predicaments they find themselves in are the types that real families face, though funnier.",1367107200,,491,4.466666666666667

4141796,5,B003L77G06,"Season 2 is even funnier than season 1. Maybe it's because I have gotten to know the characters, but the humor is sophisticated and constant. This show rivals Big Bang Theory in making me laugh.",1365465600,,194,4.571428571428571

4142647,5,B003L77G06,"This is a really funny show! My niece gave me the first season and I was really taken away by it. It is snortingly hilarious and I've learned NOT to eat popcorn while watching it as it usually ends up flying out of my nose as I double over in laughter.
If anyone out there wants a great TV show at their fingertips they should fork over their dough and buy this baby. Watching it live can be a real bummer with all the commercials so its worth it to buy it.
The show sounds simple enough as it is about a five person family and their relatives. The father is an adorable dork who loves his wife and kids more than he does himself. He thinks hes cool but hes really a lovable cad that I can't get enough of, while his wife is a hot control freak who micromanages everything. The oldest daughter is a queen with a dolt of a boyfriend, while her younger sister is a brainiac who can't figure out why everyone loves her older sister so much. The son is a dimwitted little prankster who is screamingly appealing. Throw them and their relatives in a pot and stir it up and you have the best comedy show that TV has seen in years. We watched this second season in like three days as it was even better than the first. This is truly ""feel good"" TV so buy it if you want some good vibes! :)",1344902400,,1281,4.087301587301587

4142649,2,B003L77G06,"After viewing other reviews. The product review has to do with a review of the quality of the DVD and the quality of the movie. The star ratings are assigned to the seller. A lot of the sellers have different star ratings. Otherwise sellers can get away with sending buyers low quality dvds.

The season itself was so far my favorite season.

As I indicated in my previous review:

The second disk of the second season that I order has a bad area on it. Unfortnately the episodes on the second DVD disk is the reason I order the second season. During a couple of the episodes, the picture moves really slow and afterwards freezes. It is very irritating. If you have a DVD set that has a bad disk you should not sell it to someone. I will never buy another used DVD set because of something like this happening. It's not worth the savings.",1342310400,,838,4.358974358974359
4142650,1,B003L77G06,"I was disappointed.

The plastic wrap was all stuck on the spine of the DVD case. The sticker (or seal) on top of the DVD player was REALLY hard to take off. Very, very stock and after I finally managed to take off the seal, it left tons of stickyness on the case.

The quality of the print on the disks are bad. The DVD case is really cheap, made cheap, very flimsy, smells like chemicals, and it doesn't even properly keep the disks in place (the disks keep falling off).

What's worse, the disk doesn't work properly. It stops every other minute and drives me nuts.

I love the show. I really do. I was so excited to receive the DVD... But the quality of the disk, its prints, its case... I mean, how wrong can you get with a DVD set... it looks like something they made illegally.

With no laugh track and quick, sharp jokes, you must pay attention. Buying the discs is great because I always pick up something new with each viewing and rewinding to hear lines I laughed through is easy. It's one of the smarter sitcoms in recent memory.  There's not a weak character and no tedious ongoing storyline that drags the show down. Overall great comedy. My personal opinion: Manny's the best.",1338768000,3,551,4.7894736842105265

Season 2 is just as hilarious as the first! The studio kept all of the characters true to who they were in the 1st and all are still just as great as they were, even though they should probably have big heads after being the highest honored comedy series at the 2010 Emmy Awards receiving 6 including Outstanding Comedy Series for Season 1 right? Even if you haven't seen season 1 (which you'll be dying to see if you start here with the 2nd season first) you'll be caught up with knowing what the show is about and already have a connection with the characters from the first episode you watch since its not a sequential TV show like some others. To fill you in a little bit there are 3 families (who are all part of each others families too). Jay is a wealthy guy in his 60s who married someone almost half his age, the Colombian beauty, Gloria who came into the relationship with her son, Manny, from her previous marriage. Jay's daughter is Claire (married to Phil and they have 3 kids together) and Jay's son, Mitchell whose partner is Cameron, they have adopted a daughter, Lily together.

Each episode is packed full of hilarious moments, running plots, and always ends with a positive message for the viewer to really think about.
 The acting is first class, the characters are easy to fall in love with, and lets be honest... who doesn't want the chance to see Gloria (Sofia Vergara) and Claire (Julie Bowen) in all their beauty for a full half hour?
 If you want a break from the monotonous lineup of reality shows and Jersey Shore-like characters TV currently offers, then I highly recommend getting into Modern Family. Start with the 1st Season, as it will help you build an understanding of each character, their personality, and their history.

Jay's daughter Claire has the traditional marriage with a husband three kids. Jay's son Mitchell is live the alternate lifestyle with his gay partner Cam and their adopted daughter from Vietnam.

I was severely unsatisfied with the product (Modern Family Season 2) that you sold me.  I love the show, and since it is not on Netflix and I am a poor college student, I decided to purchase it for less on Amazon.com.  I was extremely excited when I popped in the first disc, only to learn that it was ""unrecognized"" by the player. Not wanting my disappointments to get the best of me, I thought positively and inserted the second disc. It worked to my enjoyment and I watched all the episodes on that disc.  However, when I put in the final disc of the season, it also was unrecognizable. So in short, I am unhappy that I am unable to watch one of my favorite shows after paying for season 2.

Each episode is fresh and keeps you interested from beginning to end. You might have your favorite character in the show, but the entire cast ensemble is great. This show is simply well thought out and put together. It's definitely a good wind down to hectic day.",1324598400,,649,4.752212389380531

4143420,5,B003L77G06,"I purchased this series for $8.99 from amazon.com during the Black Friday deals week.  It includes the entire second season and a few extras (though not many).

The case is slim, and the discs all stay put pretty well.  I'm happy with the quality of packaging.  Now onto the show.

I watched the second season originally from the local library (yes my library has many copies of this season), though it took me a few weeks to get bumped up on the request list.  I had recently finished season one and was craving more of the delightful comedy of this series.

Though season one may have been a little more fun, there is plenty of hilarity during this season.  For those who don't know, this series was created by the team that brought Frasier to us.  Quality shows both.  The writing is excellent and the actors play well to their talents and stay true to their characters.

What this show is about is making odd family and lifestyle situations work in a crazy and fast paced world.  The show is actually set up as a Scandanavian reality show.  I don't know if this was ever mentioned on the actual show, but it is mentioned on the website and mentioned during the commentary in season one.  I think it was for Norwegian television.  They wanted a reality show showing a slice of American family life.  So that is why you have the periodic asides where family members talk to the camera, or the occasional sideways glance at the camera during normal scenes.

If you haven't seen the show, you should probably catch a few of the early episodes of season one, but it is not required.  There aren't really any spoilers and each episode pretty much stands alone with few story arcs carrying over to multiple episodes.

One actor who delighted me by appearing was Nathan Lane playing 'Pepper'.  Hilarious!

This is not your ordinary family life drama.  It features one somewhat normal appearing household that ends up being the most dysfunctional of the bunch, a gay couple with an adopted Asian daughter, and an older, rich guy with a much younger, hot Colombian wife and her son.

I will never be able to find a ""reality"" show as entertaining as good old-fashioned scripted performances, be they live-action or animated. Phil is easily the funniest on the show, with Cam a close second. I just can't look at Ed O'Neil and not think Al Bundy, and I'm sure that's the case for many people. That in no way takes away from this show but Married With Children is a classic, and I'm sure will have more seasons under its belt than this show will. The biggest problem(s) with this show IMO is Luke, the kid just can't act, or to put it more accurately he OVER acts. He tries to be this semi-retarded (sorry not PC) yet still innocently funny and it just doesn't work out for him. Maybe in future seasons he will have matured a bit more and this behavior will stop. Another aspect that has bothered me, for nearly every show in the last few decades, is why does everything have to take place in either LA or NY?

4143715,5,B003L77G06,"Like many second seasons of comedies, Modern Family fell short of the heights of its debut.  The nice thing is, the debut was so high, a short fall like this still results in really good comedy, with flashes of greatness.

The setting and characters of the show are the same as in Season One, nobody new is introduced and no one leaves.  That allows the characters to get comfortable with each other even more......too comfortable in some cases, though it's nothing too excessive.  The show's breakout character has clearly become Phil Dunphy (Ty Burrell), the dippy father/husband/son-in-law who badly wants to do the right thing and be cool at the same time.  That doesn't often work, but Phil is so earnest in what he does that you just smile and want to pat him on the head.  Not sure if I would want him as a father, but he'd be the best uncle alive.  His wife Claire (Julie Bowen), is still wound tight during this season, and some her explosions are very, very funny.  Again, wouldn't want her as a mother......or an aunt.  She's funny to watch on TV though, and she and Burrell both deserved the Emmy's they got  for this season.  Their kids got a bit more to do, as Hailey (Sarah Hyland)had boy problems, as well as concerns about her future.......Alex (Ariel Winter) has to decide between being smart and being popular.....and Luke (Nolan Gould) seems destined to be his dad, they're so much alike it's scary.

The three Dunphy kids' storylines came at the expense of Manny (Rico Rodriguez), who had less to do this season unfortunately, though he and Jay (Ed O'Neill) still play off each other brilliantly.  In many ways this is the most interesting relationship in the show, Jay's third attempt at fatherhood, and his failures and successes with Manny don't go unnoticed  by his adult children, not always a good thing.  It leads to some interesting subtext in the relationships between Jay and his children, I hope they do more with it.  Gloria (Sofia Vergara) is a bit over the top this season, and her yelling could be used to torture prisoners, but Vergara successfully continues to steer Gloria away from the antagonist role that one would have assumed she'd have when the series started.

Mitchell and Cameron (Jesse Tyler Ferguson and Eric Stonestreet) are where the series has it's first real issues.  Cameron is becoming a bit much to deal with, with his over the top antics and ""me, me, and more me"" diva personality.  The character seems to have the need to take over any scene he's in, and he's a bit clueless to boot.  I'm not saying that he has an emotionally abusive relationship with Mitchell, but I can see a few ways it could be going there.  I'm sure it's the performance that the show runners want, given that it's not changed through the first four episodes of the current season, but the less Cameron the better. Ferguson's Mitchell is notable in that he has some nice, quiet moments during the season that really say a lot about him.....and a couple of loud ones too, the subplot where Jay has dinner with Mitchell and Cameron and their friends is terrific, and you can see Mitchell looking at his father like he doesn't really know who he is.  Also notable with these two characters is their daughter Lily, played by twins who never once, to my recollection, change their facial expression, no matter what the hijinks going on around them.  I found it fascinating, in a good way, and was disappointed to see the role recast for the current season.

Overall this is a great season, as the family continues it's issues, fun, and growth.  Outside characters are kept to a minimum, most are merely MacGuffins anyway, though there was some nice stunt casting at times.  Modern Family continues to hold a slim, but noticeable lead over Big Bang Theory as my favorite comedy, and I look forward to more adventures of the next months.

4143801,5,B003L77G06,"When ""Modern Family"" premiered in the fall of 2009, it was a breath of fresh air. An incredibly brilliant, well written and acted series depicting family life of the Pritchett/Dunphy clan. It was one of the best things I had seen on network TV in years. From start to finish, the debut season was an instant classic, and the show deservedly got the attention from critics and award shows. But then came the obvious question. Can they do it again? Was the show a one season wonder? Would they suffer from the ever dreadful 'sophomore slump'? When season two premiered in the fall of 2010, it was apparent right away, especially with the first few episodes, that any fears or doubt were instantly washed away. Season 2 premiered as strong as ever, and rolled out 24 high quality episodes. But first....

A little catch up. The series features Pritchett family patriarch, Jay (the fantastic Ed'o'Neill), who is married to a much younger columbian woman named Gloria (Sofia Vergara), and step-father to Manny. His daughter Claire (Julie Bowen) is married to Phil (Ty Burrell), and they have three children, Haley, Luke, and Alex. Jay's son Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) lives with his partner, Cameron (the hilarious Eric Stonestreet) and their adopted daughter, Lily.

Season 2 got things off on the right foot. The season premiere, ""The Old Wagon"", was a strong welcome back that showcased everything that makes the show so great. Humor and heart. The episode dealt with Phil finally deciding to get rid of the old family car, but not without one last trip down memory lane. One of the season's best episodes for sure. Next up is ""The Kiss"". The show had had some controvery surrounding the gay characters of Mitchell and Cameron never kissing. This hilarious episode focuses on Mitchell's growing concern of Cameron's reluctance to show passion in public. It was such a well done episode that made the ballyhoo surrounding it into nothing, as the episode handled it in such a normal, natural way, and didn't make a big deal out of it. Brilliant! Episode 3, ""Earthquake"", was supposed to be the season premiere, but was pushed back to be the 3rd episode. It doesn't take much to figure out what the episode is about. ""Unplugged"" is a great episode that features Phil and Claire persuading the kids to all give up their electronical devices and learn to communicate better with each other. ""Halloween"" is another instant classic. Claire goes all out for the holiday and has everyone playing a part, but of course, it doesn't go too well. Elsewhere, ""Caught In The Act"" is an unflinchingly funny and honest episode where the 3 Dunphy kids catch their parents 'in the act '. Valentine's Day laughs return in the hilarious ""Bixby's Back"", and Nathan Lane shines as a Mitchell/Cam buddy who befriends Jay in ""Boys' Night"". ""See You Next Fall"" deals with Alex's middle school graduation, and the hilarity that ensues trying to get there. The season ends with Jay's birthday and him just wanting to go fishing, but his family has other plans in ""The One That Got Away"". There's so much more!

Some say season 2 DID in fact suffer from a sophomore slump, but I just don't see it. The second half of the season isn't as strong as the first, but that doesn't mean anything. It's still great. The overall season is yet another testament to the great writing, acting, and directing that was established in season one. Each character is still fully fleshed out and with their own unique personalities. The incredibly talented cast continue to make their charcaters full fledged, fully fleshed out characters we love, care about, and laugh with. It doesn't hurt that the writing is so sharp, so clever, so relatable, and the humor as top notch as ever, for the actors to once again display why they are the best ensemble cast on television. I love how the show never shys away from the sweet moments, how almost every episode ends with something nice. That's just not something you get a lot of on television these days. It's the show that not only makes me laugh, but can also move me and make me feel for these people. I can't remember the last time I said that about a network television show.

The season 2 set also comes pretty well packed with special features. Just like the season 1 set, it comes with Deleted Family Interviews, Deleted And Extended Scenes, and a Gag Reel. For the rest, we are treated to 6 featurettes (2 more than season 1) and a music video for ""Imagine Me Naked"", the song Dylan wrote for Haley. The new featurettes are ""At Home With Modern Family"", ""Modern Family Holidays"", ""Mitch's Flash Mob"", ""Strangers On A Treadmill - Table Read"", ""Waiting For Oprah"", and ""Chatting With Steve Levitan"".

Season 2 of ""Modern Family"" is worth every penny. Some special guests include Shelley Long, Matt Dillon, Natahn Lane, Elizabeth Banks, and more. In addition to it's cast, it can't help but have great guest stars too! Simply put, ""Modern Family"" is divine television. The rare show that deserves all the hype, all the praise, and gives me hope for network comedy. Season 2 is great. Pick it up now.",1316476800,26,5107,4.753100338218715
4143802,3,B003L77G06,"Modern Family's first season was pretty good, I'll say. It was sort of fresh, original, funny. Better than a lot of the shows on TV, to say the least.

But the second season wasn't quite as good. It went to the well of Cam-as-stereotypical-overzealous-diva once too many, and while Ed O'Neill and Rico Rodriguez gave very good performances, some parts of the season just fell flat. Certain storylines were cliched, and the show was somewhat overshadowed in my mind by better comedies ('Community', 'Parks and Recreation' and 'Louie' for example). Two episodes that perfectly encapsulate what I feel Modern Family hit a bit of a sophomore slump: ""Our Children, Ourselves"" and "" The Musical Man'.

(Possible spoilers?)
The first had a storyline involving an increasingly convoluted plot involving Mitchell mistaking a little person for a child (which could have been ripped straight from a '50s era sketch comedy) while the second is just really predictable. The jokes fall flat and you can tell exactly what's going to happen. As soon as I saw the ad that Phil was going to put on the side of the truck, I knew that the joke was that it looked like Phil was whoring out his wife, daughter, et al. And it's not that predictability is always bad, but the show didn't feel as fresh or interesting this season.

In short, Modern Family season 2 had a lot of good jokes and plenty of good episodes... but it felt more like a traditional sitcom and less, well, funny.

4143804,5,B003L77G06,"This show remains one of the big pleasures of sitcom television.  Wisely, its creators keep the focus on what worked on season one, that is the everyday hilarity of being family members to this extended nuclear family. Last year my favorite couple was Cam and Mitch, the gay guys.  This year I have to say that the daughter and Phil come into their own. Phil especially takes deadpan comedy to totally zany hilarity. He is especially funny whenever in the presence of his father-in-law Jay, who can turn him into jelly in less than five minutes. Jay's Colombian wife Gloria remains very funny as well along with her son Manny.  When Jay finally gives in on getting Manny a dog, it is a real high point. This show stays tightly focused on these characters inside the family, getting the comedy out of every interaction.  This is its genius: never straying off point or far afield from its premise of showing the comedy of modern family life.

4143805,5,B003L77G06,"For those who know t.v. serials, most would agree that the king of sit-coms in recent history was ""Arrested Development"".  But that King has died.  Long live the new King--Modern Family.  It is rather ironic that the casting includes an icon of possibly the worst sit-com of all times, Ed O'Neill, from ""Married With Children.""  As much as that show sucked, appealing to the lowest common denominator of newly-pubescent adolescents, Ed has redeemed himself with finally a mature role as the politically incorrect and curmudgeonly patriarch in Modern Family.  The casting is ideal.  The scripts are savvy.  The dialogue is crisp.  And the humor is effervescent.  The only slight criticism may be that they risk ""gaying-up"" the gay couple a bit too much.  Granted, it is funny, but it's a fine line between character and caricature.  The limp wrists, swishing and flamboyance is sometimes a little over the top and becoming too predictable.  The chemistry however, with all the character's is sublime.  I literally DVR every episode, watch it live, and then rewatch the DVR version twice.  It's like a shot of humor-cocaine injected directly into my funny bone.  If you like laugh out loud, tears down you cheeks, biting humor with a dose of even pathos on some occasions, this is the best sit-com on planet earth.",1304985600,23,1312,4.954128440366972
4143846,5,B003L77G06,"This show is one of the most entertaining to come along in quite a while.  It's clever, creative and the characters very endearing.  We have never seen one show that we didn't laugh out loud.  The humor is smart, not slap in the face stupid.  If it doesn't make you laugh out loud or at least smile you probably hate Christmas, puppies and babies  and "" grumpy cynic"" is your middle name.  (You know the type)  For the rest of you  ENJOY!!",1303603200,3,439,4.2682926829268295
4143847,5,B003L77G06,"This episode is yet another example of just how perfectly this half hour comedy has stepped into the void of funny sitcoms on tv today.  In this second season I have discovered more the hilarity of yet other cast members in this family ensemble.  Yes, one of my favorites, Cam, is terrific this time with his godawful school musical production.  He is determined to turn a grammar school musical into a Sondheim like production and is hilarious while doing so.  However, Phil, the son-in-law in the series, is just as funny with one of his usual blunders.  He made this ad for his real estate practice which shows his whole family.  The ad in print is fine but he has it painted onto his van as well and the painters have to wrap it around the van.  Now the ad looks like the ad for a prostitution ring with his wife and teen daughter as the two prime hookers.  They haven't noticed yet and Phil is desperate to keep them away from the van.  This show remains one of my top favorites for the year and I have enjoyed season two every bit as much as season one.",1302825600,,1059,4.308080808080808
4143848,5,B003L77G06,"This show is hilarious. Great timing on all the jokes. The gay couple is always funny as hell.  When Phil gets hit by the car and yells ""oh no!"", ha ha ha. I rewound it 10 times. My wife and I love the show, Looking forward to buying season 2",1302134400,7,242,3.84
4143849,5,B003L77G06,"We heard good things about this series but never watched it during its first season.  Amazon was running a Deal of the Day so I purchased it.  My wife and I watched the pilot and were hooked.  Great characters, superb writing, great fun!  We don't watch much television but wound up watching the entire first season in less than two weeks.  Gloria, Claire, Cameron, Matthew, Jay, Mannie, and Haley are all special, but Phil's the best (OK maybe they're all the best).  Enjoy yourself and watch these DVD's.",1301443200,5,506,4.693181818181818
4143850,5,B003L77G06,"I knew my wife loved Modern Family, but I also knew she didn't really start watching until near the end of the first season.  Amazon had the whole first season on DVD, and I thought, why not see if she likes this as a birthday gift?  Probably one of the best gift decisions I've ever made.  Except even though she watches the show religiously on TV, I also know she's going to EXPECT to get Season 2 on DVD as soon as it comes out.  Amazon, please keep me in mind when it does!",1300492800,15,477,4.042553191489362
4143851,5,B003L77G06,"I cannot get over how funny this show is. There has been times when I have laughed so hard at these guys. I love them! ABC has aired a wonderful show and season two has proven to be just as effective as season one. I look forward to this every week! And it does, in a way, remind me of my own family. Can't wait to keep laughing at these guys. Too funny!",1298505600,36,354,3.863013698630137
4143852,5,B003L77G06,"We are so in love with the TV series Modern Family. Honestly it's about the only TV show we religiously record and watch.
There are SO many good episodes but this one is probably the best ever. There are so many 1-liners you have to watch it twice to really get the full effect. This was the first time in a long time that I've been laughing so hard during a TV show that I had to pause it!  :)",1297296000,,394,3.925
4143853,5,B003L77G06,"This show is just the funniest ever.  I agree that if you can't laugh at this show, you should really up your medication.  We love watching it over again. Can't find more fun in front of the boob tube.",1291593600,22,201,4.128205128205129
