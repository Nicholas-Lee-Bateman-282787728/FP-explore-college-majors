The acting, is, exceptional, especially considering how most would be awkward 'performing' the dialogue and the sexual interactions, but they were so natural and convincing.  This movie is special on many levels.  The sex is real, and visually erotic.  Fantastic photography or whatever they call it, filming...

4885827,5,B005SN3UPQ,"There have been a few films in the past decade presented outside of the adult film industry that included graphic sexuality, almost all from Europe... though to my mind this is the first to show such honest and warmly sensual sexuality. If you've actually made genuine, heartfelt love to someone, you're not likely to be offended by anything you see or hear. Just the opposite.

But aside from the nudity and surprisingly graphic nature of what goes on, there's so much more here. There's a political message that needs to be told, and it's delivered with a calm and easy hand.

The heroine (Now) is a creature of intelligence, genuine love and simple, unquestioning compassion the likes of which one seldom finds in film, or for that matter in life. The leads in this small cast effort let loose and express real emotion in a way that almost convinces you that they're lovers in real life, though they only met after being cast.

Writer and director Phillipe Diaz has created a small masterpiece. The scenes are long and languid, the script is conversational - this is how people actually talk to each other. Above all else it's difficult to imagine another actress bringing this story to life as exquisitely as Shari Solanis, whose performance is worthy of an Academy Award, though this will never happen.

Very, very highly recommended to those with open minds and open hearts. I can honestly say that after watching film both as entertainment and as an essential art form for over four decades, I've never seen anything quite like it. Unforgettable. Perhaps even a turning point in contemporary cinema.",1312675200,193,1606,4.850364963503649

4885841,5,B005SN3UPQ,"No, this film will never join CITIZEN KANE or THE RULES OF THE GAME in the pantheon of Great Films. BUT - it is the first film I've ever seen that deals with sex as an absolutely natural part of a couple's relationship...specially as they begin to explore the possibility of being intimate with each other. The sexual scenes are not discreetly screened from view. We see them (more or less) as we would if we were in the scene with the characters. The scenes are not pornographic, they are simply natural and real. How refreshing (as a film-goer) to be treated like an adult! Of course, the two (actually three) actors who appear in this film are (to me, at least) relative unknowns. I doubt we will be seeing Brad Pitt or Nicole Kidman having actual intercourse in a mainstream Hollywood film any time soon. But in an ideal cinematic universe, there would be more films as candid and truthful about human sexuality as this one. But [in response to some of the negative critiques here] this is a film with a distinctly Liberal bias. I appreciate the film's Liberal bias; but I suspect most Conservative viewers would dislike the film as much for its political themes as for its graphic sexuality.",1454457600,5,1196,4.619718309859155
4885842,5,B005SN3UPQ,"An excellent film!  It was recently said by someone in the Adult Entertainment Industry that said Industry needs to make a great film this year.  ""Now & Later"" is exactly what the Adult Industry needs to produce and create to reverse its creative decline.  ""Now & Later"" is a film about adults, for adults, for couples, for thinking men and women.  If one happens to be reading about the early 20th Century and can see parallels and/or history repeating itself, one can see how America evolved to be the way it presently is.  This film gives excellent insight into how and why the rest of the world sees us as backwards, stifled, unenlightened, sexually immature, uneducated and illiterate about gender and culture.  We have called other countries a lot of names over the decades, but some of the worst apply right here at home to us.  One can see why other nations are resistant to American ""nation building"" and certainly reluctant to pursue an American form of republican (with a small ""r"") democracy.  We should be taking our own society and culture apart and completely re-building our own nation in this election year.  One can see why we have the largest number of citizens behind bars of any nation on the planet; it is very easy to become a criminal in this country whether one wants to or not.  It is in American heritage, blood, genes, cells and DNA.  We have and always will be fighters not lovers.",1454198400,14,1410,4.645161290322581

She agrees to keep him at her place until he can leave. She volunteers in multiple ""jobs"" helping poor and unlucky people in her community including as a nurse which she has some training for. As the two get to know each other, they develop a common love interest, but they also are in conflict over their ideologies - political and personal lifestyles.

This is not porn, but a very graphic engagement in the early stages of a deep love relationship. It is tender, realisticly loving as the conflicts come out, until by the end, they have developed deep feelings for each other.

This movie is so unique to American audiences that we are unlikely to see much like it in any other movie. The more I contemplated this after I watched it, the more I appreciated this as a fine adult work of art and soon decided to purchase my own Blu-Ray disc of it. Many reviewer make a big deal that it is pushing some political agenda or moral values, that the acting was poorly done, while other reviewers gave it 5 stars, and like myself, thought the acting was superb as the gal is supposed to be from Nicaragua when she was actually born in New Jersey. While her character has an accent, I found her quite understandable. There is a deleted scene on the DVD showing them having sex in all its uninhabited glory. I was delighted that this movie took the freedom to show full bodies in all their beautiful lovemaking parts without shame or unrealistic covers hiding the actor's sexual parts, while not exploiting them in some gratuitous display. One of the conflicts this movie explores is the huge gap in movie rating between graphic violence and graphic love making. How can we prohibit showing a penis, not to mention an erection, or a couple making love, while allowing young viewers to see blood and guts flying in violence? People need to see many more examples of making love then solving conflicts with continuous graphic violence.
""Make love, not war""

4885862,3,B005SN3UPQ,"First, Shari Solanis is gorgeous, no matter what she wears or doesn't, and conveys an authentic sensuality that fits the role perfectly.

The plot is straightforward enough, if a bit claustrophobic. A high-flying investment banker, like Icarus, flies too high and gets burned - fired, divorced, convicted of some white-collar crime. With little but the clothes on his back, he's one step away from a prison sentence. And, for reasons that don't much matter, ends up hiding for a few days with an undocumented and very uninhibited Honduran immigrant. A few scenes take place outside Angela's apartment (counting the roof as part of it), but it's mostly just the two play off and playing with each other.

The playing-with scenes are delightfully sensual, but take up only a small part of the movie's total time. The playing-off scenes turn almost into a debate between his Type A, competitive lifestyle and her relaxed, almost child-of-nature approach to the world. (Of course, her presentation of her case, spoken and tactile, seems much more convincing.) There's a political note too, that I found a bit jarring, but that separated it from other uptight-vs-natural stories you&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/might/dp/B00R3ZM792/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">might</a>&nbsp;already recognize.

For me, even Solanis's spark couldn't ignite the sodden debate. Nice enough, but the talk-talk ends up outweighing the exciting moments.

4885863,5,B005SN3UPQ,As promised.,1424563200,,12,5.5
4885864,5,B005SN3UPQ,"This film is an obscure gem and I love discovering obscure gems. If you were to ask the next 50 people you encounter if they know this movie, I'll bet that not a single one of them will answer in the affirmative. Few people know of it and it is a shame because this is hidden treasure. Ms. Solanis truly deserves an Academy Award for Best Actress, and I bet even Meryl Streep would agree.  Solanis plays an illegal alien who agrees to help a white-collar fugitive. He has absconded while out on bail on  allegations of unlawful market manipulation. He was supposed to surrender to do eight years in Federal prison. She is a beautiful Bohemian free-spirit. She lives on the top floor of a seemingly abandoned building in a downtown urban area (I think it was L.A.).  The mood throughout the film is dark and murky, and most of the scenes are in dark locales.

They spend a lot of time on the roof of her building at night, looking down at the festering city below. He comes from wealth and privilege, she comes from Nicaragua and extreme hardship.  She is radiant and gorgeous, and he is wounded and condemned.  She feels compassion for him, even though he represents much of what she despises about the US. Her kindness is unbounded, and she attempts to renew in him a sense of purpose and future.  Her sexual favors are just part of a series of efforts to make the fugitive feel whole again. The fugitive character is kind of repressed and vanillafied, but I think that was by design.  He's the standard investment-banker-sleaze stereotype from a Connecticut McMansion, and she's an authentic and robust jewel straight from heaven.  But she does not judge him  harshly or condescend.  She understands his path.  This is a movie which is ultimately most about compassion. Her compassion pays off--by the end of the movie the fugitive is a much better person. Her positive energy has upgraded his moral core.  He even looks better.

No--I don't admire this film because it has some borderline X-rated sex scenes, although some are indeed appealing.  I admire this film because Ms. Solanis has created an amazingly appealing character--a woman who is sexually liberated and creative, politically engaged, highly feminine, eternally loyal, open-minded, beautiful and authentic in every way. She is enigmatic to the point of being fully mystical. The fugitive she was helping will be enamored for the rest of his life as he thinks back on his time with her and realizes he no longer has her.  Prison would have been easier to deal with. This is a woman you fall in love with and NEVER recover from. Even though this film was obviously produced on a low budget, the efforts of Shari Solanis are so genuine and unique that this is one you will not forget.

I am truly surprised that Shari Solanis did not receive more accolades for this role.  Perhaps that will come in the future, and I believe this film's cult status will slowly morph into classic status despite its racy sexual scenes.  What distinguishes this movie from any other sexually provocative movie is the extensive extremely intelligent dialogue. It's far more of an European art house film than an adult erotic film, although some people may seek it out for the latter characteristics.  Solanis's character is very critical of the policies of the United States government, and she articulates her reasons why in a reasonably compelling manner. Ill-advised U.S. Reagan-era interventions in her native Nicaragua resulted in the murder of her parents.  I disagree with many of her political views, but I understand many of her perspectives, and one gets the impression she would still be accepting of anyone who views things differently. She thinks Americans are sexually repressed and overly materialistic. She encourages the fugitive to view life through a different prism.

Solanis's character believes in embracing the NOW--living in the moment. The fugitive she is helping affectionately refers to her as Professor Now.  The fugitive is someone who has always  focused on acquiring more wealth for the future. (Thus the  name for the film: Now and Later.)  They discuss this theme quit a bit, and it is a very satisfying philosophical exchange.  They each have a compelling point in their perspective, and they mutually respect one another.

I saw this movie a few years ago and it stuck with me.  I couldn't recall the film's name, and there are no major stars in this, and so I had a hard time figuring out what it was called.  I scrolled back through hundreds of films in my Netflix history and finally found it.  I immediately bought it and watched it again last night.  I am glad I did.

Spartacus (the TV series) had the same kind of disturbing/ graphic nudity, but it also had a really engaging story.  I actually wept when Spartacus died.

The pros: The character Angela speaks about her parents and country of origin in a proud and regal manner. She is actually at her best (acting wise) when engaged in political dialogue. The archetype of Bill comes out in the strongest manner when discussing the circumstances that led him to running from the law.
The cons: There was a scene filled with potential involving Bill and his wife. The wife is trying to gain a sense of closure over what is going on. My spouse glanced over to watch me viewing the film and expressed that it appears that both the man and women appeared to be reading from the cue cards instead of expressing stronger concern about what is to happen between them.  The scene could have been made even more powerful by having Bill express stronger empathy towards his wife's intensity.
At least two things could have made the film more electrifying; 1)Re-enactment of the story where Bill mentions a few of the missions that were connected to his job and 2) At least one to two scenes  briefly displaying events that directly impacted Angela's parents.  However, Now & Later may be fine for those who do not mind graphic films sparse in adventure plots.",1378512000,4,1411,4.658634538152611

It is what life is all about and NOT hiding the lovemaking and the sexual connection of the people involved makes it  all the more real.  SEX is not dirty.  It is a very enjoyable part of the relationship the characters share.  Somehow, Blood and Guts being spread all over the screen is more acceptable in this society.  What a shame the society celebrates Blood and Guts and hides the real world of sexual preference between adults in a relationship. The actors do a wonderful job of educating on all fronts and no one gets killed and bloodied!

4885886,1,B005SN3UPQ,"I rented this because I'm interested in both serious films that depict explicit sex and in sexually explicit films that aspire to some kind of artistic seriousness; unfortunately Now & Later is neither of these things, and in many ways combines the worst elements of each into a movie that borders on unwatchable.

As traditional film-making it's absolutely insipidly dull. Even if you broadly agree with the left-wing political points being made, which I do, watching the characters go back and forth in woodenly acted exchanges of dialogue that sounds like it was written by an earnest pre-teen is likely to make you want to jump into the picture and defend Ronald Reagan and the system of international finance, if only to have something vaguely resembling a conflict happen onscreen.

As a sex film it is, if anything, even weaker. The story is absolutely pornographic in its logic: a stiff, unlikeable man on the run encounters a vivacious, politically aware and articulate young woman who wants nothing more than to shelter him and perform a variety of sex acts with him for no explicable reason. While both leads are attractive enough the film's failure to evoke anything like dramatic tension between them and generally uninteresting photography (a recurring visual motif involving reflected images of the couple in mirrors which were probably intended to be arty but are just poorly composed is especially maddening) means there's neither erotic intensity nor pornographic directness to speak of.

If you're interested in talk-y art-house erotica there's much better out there, mostly by Europeans: I'd recommend the classic soft-core films of Radley Metzger and Tinto Brass, as well the recent films of Catherine Breillat, Jean Claude-Brisseau, and Brass again. All have their flaws but are far superior to Now & Later, both as depictions of sex and examples of cinematic story-telling.",1362787200,4,1896,5.189542483660131

4885892,5,B005SN3UPQ,"In principle, we have a chamber piece setting two world views up against each other. In one corner we have Bill, a disgraced banker, representing the people who think that their money and/or power will let them get away with anything - but, having been ejected from the system he supported, he is now ready to change his views and indeed his life philosophy.

In the other corner, Angela, champion of free love and social justice, the illegal immigrant offering  him shelter for a few days in her gorgeously hippie-styled penthouse flat on top of a derelict hotel, where both the toilet and the shower are completely open-plan and in plain view of everything else, and where part of the neon sign of the hotel serves as lighting for the single room. That room alone is reason enough to watch the movie.

Angela embarks on the re-education of banker Bill, trying to reconvert him into a useful member of society - although it will have to be the society of a different country, as the US authorities want him locked up. With her priorities firmly on her sensual desires, she goes in for the sex first, fitting in the political education later.

To me, as someone who has essentially grown up with the Nicaragua solidarity movement, her political lecturing was a tad over-familiar, although I appreciate that the vast majority of the US audience will not know (or in fact believe, if told) that the CIA sold arms to Iran to finance the removal of a democratically elected government in Nicaragua (it's called the Iran-Contra affair, look it up).  This scandal, which was exposed in November 1986, is kind of hard to reconcile with the prevailing US  ideology that ""we're the good guys"", but I can confirm that it is true, I was alive (and young and angry) when it happened. Bill's response ""you read too many novels"" was hilarious to me, but probably representative of what a vast number of people would say if confronted with these historical events.

People who don't like the gospel she preaches may resent the dialogue, but, as washed-up banker Bill proves, Angela's charm is irresistible, whether or not you share her political opinion. And her roof-top paradise from where she looks down on the social divisions on LA with eagle eyes, is equally seductive.",1359331200,16,2260,4.764705882352941

4885896,2,B005SN3UPQ,"[NOW and LATER - 2011 - directed by Philippe Diaz - 99 minutes] I read the first few reviews posted, it sounded interesting as an indie intellectual exploitation flick (that didn't have Beatrice Dalle in it, for those familiar w/ this genre), and purchased it for later viewing. Bad call on my part.

Here's my thing - if you wanna watch nudity and sex, that's fine; that's what porn's for, for those who can't lazily luxuriate in the cable/satellite trash that is Skinemax. If you want to ruminate on quasi-philosophical and/or pseudo-intellectual subject matter, surf the net or read a book. If you want a biased, inaccurate history lesson, turn on TLC, History or the Discovery Channel, or listen to the irritating spin of FOX News. But, for chrissakes, don't delude yourself into thinking for one second that this nonsense is anything but lethargic Latino sexploitation whose main selling point is pushing the margins of softcore by showing male and female full-frontal nudity. What is wrong with us?

Shari Solaris, as the illegal Nicaraguan Clara Barton of East L.A. with a heart of gold and a worldview vastly superior (yet still fairly shallow) to her American lover of late, is fairly believable and likable, but is clearly reading some of her more philosophical post-coital dialogue from cue cards - just watch her eyes. James Wortham is absolutely wretched as the emotionally challenged American banker who screwed up his life, now a wounded bird under the sexually-healing hands of his Latina mentor, who teaches him how to live in the 'now'. He has all the emotional range of a window mannequin, and far less likability.

Absolutely nothing happens throughout the film except the 'erotic' encounters which, truthfully, aren't all that erotic. We're stuck watching marginalized characters pushing margins of softcore by exposing male genitalia 'cause, as a technological society, we're that sexually repressed. We can kill, cannibalize, dismember and eviscerate each other all day and night on TV, but show full frontal nudity? Sorry, friends, let me remind you we're trying to have a civilization here...and that's just going too far.

Writer and director, Philippe Diaz, has absolutely no funds to work with, and not much by way of cinematic skill either. No budget, locations, additional actors, action, plot or character development, nada - couldn't he have sponsored cockfights at the local orphanage for additional financing? After all, this flick takes place in the squalor of East L.A. - would placing a few crackwhores on payroll as 'fundraisers' be too much to ask? Apparantly so, and I mean no racial bias in my admittedly distastful comments - the gringos are twice as unlikable as any of the Latinos here.

So gents, let's be truthful to ourselves as well as to those we recommend films to - this is no psychosexual, philosophical or arthouse erotic indie we're talkin' here - this is just plain old softcore celluloid that belongs on Cinemax at midnight, with an edited erection here and there. No more, no less. Jeez - was there EVER any truth in advertising?",1348012800,8,3086,5.031311154598826

On the negative....I'm an American who is proud of my country.  The film would have been interesting without the political piece, which for me took away.  I can accept many opinions (spoiler alert), but when the main character is admittedly in the USA illegally and at the same time bashes the country she is using, then why not go help the people in your own country?  OK, MY opinion aside, most of the sex scenes were actually appealing.  If only I could be as comfortable in my skin as the main character is in this film!  I applaud her.  There was only one scene that made me uncomfortable for a couple minutes (another spoiler alert)....two men and one woman, with the guys focusing on each other...well, not my taste, even though it only went so far.

4885902,4,B005SN3UPQ,"Now & Later is an interesting fantasy. The naive banker (""Later"") runs afoul of the law and jumps bail. He is helped out by a illegal alien friend of his former driver.

She (""Now"") has the disposition of Mother Teresa, the sexual abandon of a fantasy hippie (with no signs of any complications from a promiscous lifestyle), and the politics of a Gulag Commissar. She teaches the runaway banker to examine his life and live for the now instead of forever putting off what he would really want to do for the future. The hospitality is generous and the sex is great.

The invasive part of the film is her bizarre and preachy politics. So laid back on all other issues, ""Now"" becomes the hard core Leftist who (inexplicably) lives illegally in the hated United States instead of her beloved Sandanista-run-Nicaragua!?! She erroneously (although this is common) claims Congress banned all aid to Nicaragua's Freedom Fighters (she calls them ""Contras"") when the truth was such a broad Congressional ban was not passed. The Reagan Administration's White House and the NSA were not covered by the Democratic Congressional ban (it was proposed, but never passed). However, that is a minor point that contributes to the bigger misconception: in her world Che is a hero, not the murderer of Cubans who weren't yes men and children for the Committee for the Defense of the Revolution, and her other hero appears to be Ho Chi Minh who consigned hundreds of thousands to Communist re-education camps. She is the, unknowingly, naive character when it comes to Third World regimes.
