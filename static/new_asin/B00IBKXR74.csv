8640635,2,B00IBKXR74,Continually pouting young boy grows up into a continually pouting young man.  If you hang on for 1 hour and 55 minutes you get to see him suddenly acting like a contented functioning adult.  Just my overall perspective on a movie that otherwise had some good moments.,1527724800,,267,4.659574468085107
8640636,5,B00IBKXR74,Very good story.,1523836800,,16,4.666666666666667
8640637,5,B00IBKXR74,Beautiful movie. Well acted and thought provoking. Bill Skarsgrd is an incredible actor.,1512518400,,88,5.846153846153846
8640638,4,B00IBKXR74,"Yet another story of how lives were impacted and disrupted by the war.  Very well done. Originally, I wanted to see it because I know so little about Sweden  and their way of life but I was drawn into the story and the characters.  We watched it and then watched it again with friends, who also liked it.",1476316800,2,304,4.206896551724138
8640639,5,B00IBKXR74,One of the finest complexly interwoven plots and interesting stories that I have ever seen on the big screen.,1458086400,2,109,4.7894736842105265
8640640,3,B00IBKXR74,Too long. Overworked,1423094400,,20,6.0
8640641,2,B00IBKXR74,"Basically good, but DISAPPOINTED that the director chose to include X-rated sex scenes THAT WERE NOT PERTINENT TO THE STORY. - - - These left to our IMAGINATION would have made the movie better.

I seek good movies to send to friends, most of whom are older.  I could not send this one as a gift because of the unnecessary sex scenes.

As another commentor mentioned - it was a bit PLODDY and disjointed.",1414281600,,404,4.4324324324324325
8640642,5,B00IBKXR74,"From the opening scene, the cinematography is breathtakingly beautiful.  I rarely can take anything over 1.5 hours.  In this case, the story line warranted the time to unfold.  The acting was stellar, as were the writing and music.  Many themes contained in this film, and I enjoyed every moment of the two hours.  Didn't want it to end.",1413504000,6,337,4.741379310344827
8640643,3,B00IBKXR74,"Simon and the Oaks is a story about the lives, consequences, and suffering of a group of individuals and families, Jews and Gentiles, in Sweden and Germany,  touched by the Holocaust. Deep, non-violent, and well done.",1400803200,3,217,5.027777777777778
