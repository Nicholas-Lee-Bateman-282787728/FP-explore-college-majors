8614068,4,B00FBLYSUQ,"Amy Bento Ross is definitely my favorite when it comes to advanced cardio; I was excited to get this new kickbox routine. I'll admit, some of the moves are more technical than her earlier kick boxing workouts, but I appreciate the variety. This one has grown on me; I've completed it several times since I received it (purchased from Collage Video). I would have given it five stars, but I'm not a huge fan of some of the toning intervals; they seem more style over substance. I simply continue on with the previous cardio section, jump on my step bench for a few steps or lunges, or get in some kettlebell swings or getups... I also have ASC5, but I haven't taken the time to preview and learn it yet. I'll always be appreciative of any new arrivals from Amy.",1387238400,,760,4.435714285714286
