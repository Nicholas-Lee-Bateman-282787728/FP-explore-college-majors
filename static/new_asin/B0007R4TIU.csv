2235240,5,B0007R4TIU,"Take a Hallmark production and slate it for broadcast during the Christmas season, and most times you have a guaranteed recipe for schmaltz.  Fortunately, in the case of The Wool Cap, a 2004 movie now available on DVD, the result is an honest, human movie whose gritty edge and powerful performances keep it fresh, even if it is predictable.

A remake of Jackie Gleason's classic, Gigot, the story unfolds along initially familiar lines.  Hard luck, crusty, frequently intoxicated janitor ""Chico,"" played here by William H. Macy, finds himself the unwilling and decidedly unofficial guardian of a captivating, if troublesome, young girl named Lou.  But from the beginning Macy the screenwriter does Macy the actor an enormous favor by tossing out the Frank Capra conventions and setting Chico and Lou in the unvarnished (but equally unexaggerated) ghetto.  In the opening twenty minutes of this film, at the same time we are getting to know the main characters, we are also getting a feeling for their hardscrabble world of losers, drug addicts, violence, fear and general hopelessness.  If the perky, young hooker upstairs seems too pat and too Hollywood, Macy's screenplay shrewdly balances her with the shopworn, older hooker who reserves Wednesdays for Chico alone...apparently one of only two human relationships Fate and Chico himself have allowed him to maintain.  Where earlier efforts along these lines would have had Lou's parents die in a ""terrible accident,"" or in an anonymous and random act of war, Macy's screenplay firmly roots the story in the case files of today, by having Lou abandoned by a drug befogged mother who later dies of an OD.  Making the situation all the more grim, Chico is a mute, rendered speechless by a car accident almost thirty years ago.

Chico's other two central relationships are with Ira, his Jewish tenant, played with gusto and undisguised relish by Don Rickles (who else could pull off using the word schmutz?),  and ""Grace,"" his pet spider monkey, who, needless to say, just about steals any scene she is in.  But what truly makes this film an amazing feat is Macy's performance.  Without uttering a single syllable, Macy understatedly takes us through the full range of human emotions as Chico resents life, resents Lou, resents her mother, and throughout, resents himself, before finding a meaning and purpose and a dogged determination to rescue the future from the damning grips of the past.  It is, without a doubt, a stellar performance.

In addition to Don Rickles, Cathrine O'Hara appears in far too few scenes as Chico's pay-as-you-go love interest, a role she nails with dead on accuracy; and Ned Beatty appears briefly but powerfully as Chico's embittered father.

This isn't great theater; or maybe it is.  It is touching, without being cloying.  It is sweet without being saccharin, and it is reaffirming, without being schmaltzy.  It is quite simply a dammed good film.",1129852800,6,2931,5.070833333333334
2235241,5,B0007R4TIU,"Admittedly based on the Jackie Gleason classic ""Gigot,"" this film will have you reaching for the tissues as it pulls your heartstrings. William H Macy does an amazing silent performance. Family friendly, heartwarming, highly recommended!",1120435200,11,237,5.8
2235242,5,B0007R4TIU,"William Macy shows incredible talent and warmth in this story about transformation and reconciliation.  We see the depth of his talent here especially in that he plays the entire role as a mute, and must rely solely on his eyes, facial expressions and body language to communicate-- and he does so superbly.  You won't be sorry if you rent or buy this film",1117065600,8,356,4.634920634920635
2235243,5,B0007R4TIU,"Taped this back before Christmas because it got good reviews.  Finally got to watch it today and immediately checked Amazon to see if there was a DVD (won't be out til June).  Reviews commented on how it was like the Jackie Gleason film Gigot (another one of my all time favorites) - similar premise in the beginning, but that's where it ends. Funny and sad - will make you hug your child if you have one.",1111276800,9,405,4.315789473684211

2235276,5,B0007R4TIU,"Some have suggested that the Macy character finds redemption after he finds religion, at Christmas, in a Christian church.  Sorry.  In the church, he does indeed reflect upon the Christian icons of suffering and absolution, but this skeptic got out of that beautiful scene that Macy's character finds the worth of the eternal: forgiveness of self and acceptance of death.  Sorry to sound pompous and preachy; I'd bet a year's salary (in truth, not much) that the Dalai Lama would love this movie.  Christopher Hitchens?  I'd argue yes.  This agnostic sure did, on every level.",1415491200,,576,5.010526315789473

2235279,5,B0007R4TIU,"I remember watching this movie when it was first on television and thinking that it was a great movie. I guess my wife liked it a lot more than me, because she's been after me for years to find a copy of it somewhere so she could watch it again. Thank God for Amazon. I once again have a very happy wife. The movie is great . I'd recommend this movie to anyone that is into heartwarming, make you feel good type movies.",1404345600,,419,4.0602409638554215
2235280,4,B0007R4TIU,I enjoyed this film. It is about family and love. It is about the love that a man has for a young girl. When you are responsible for taking  care of a child everything changes. Guardians have to set the proper example. This film touched my heart. This is Keke Palmer's debut film and she is great. Recommended for all parents and fans of Keke Palmer.,1402617600,,350,4.303030303030303
2235281,5,B0007R4TIU,"My son introduced me to this movie, and immediately it became my all time favorite William H. Macy movies. His acting is stellar. We all remember ""Jerry Lundegaard"" from ""FARGO"", now ""Frank Gallagher"" from SHOWTIME'S ""SHAMELESS. The Wool Cap shows such a different side to Macy's acting skills,or should I say gift. Macy plays a mute, if you can believe that, who wides up caring for a left behind young girl in an apartment building he does maintenance work in. I can go on & on about this movie, everyone has their own opinion & taste in the movies they watch. But Anyone who watches this 5 star movie will either keep it for their own collection, or gift it to someone who enjoys this heartwarming movie.",1396051200,,707,4.574803149606299

2235283,5,B0007R4TIU,The twists and turns of this DVD kept me interested.  Being based on a true story always is a drawcard for me.. and this story seemed to illustrate the power of resilience and commitment (love) which overcomes some of the grief.  I will watch this movie more than once.  Good came out of the trial and there was some laughs too!  William Macy is a great actor.,1388534400,,360,4.3283582089552235

2235307,5,B0007R4TIU,"William H. Macy should rightly be considered a national treasure, he is such a fine actor! I would have given him an Oscar for his role in this heart-warming movie -- and he didn't even speak a single word in the whole film (he plays a mute building super)! There is a whole cast of quality actors in this choice film: Ned Beatty, Don Rickles, Catherine O'Hara, and Keke Palmer. Years ago, Jackie Gleason made a movie in 1962 called ""Gigot"", in which he played the mute male lead. It was an astoundingly good movie, which to my sorrow has never come out on DVD. ""The Wool Cap"" is an excellent remake of Jackie's old movie. I am so glad to have ""The Wool Cap"" in my movie collection now!",1354406400,,686,4.2846153846153845
2235308,4,B0007R4TIU,If you think that William H. Macy is one of the best character actors out there then this is one of those films worth watching,1343347200,,126,4.08
2235309,5,B0007R4TIU,"I remembered seeing it on TV many years ago. Could not think of name but William Macy came to mind, so looked for it. Odd but written by Jackie Gleason. It is old, it is timeless. How one can change another-and yes, for good or not good-by deeds. This is of good and if you don't feel as though another's life is worth effort in you, simply don't watch or buy this. It was wonderful to have it and a real treasure to me. Keeper for sure.",1340582400,,437,4.0344827586206895
2235310,5,B0007R4TIU,"Not a huge William H Macy fan.  But the guy can act.  This film is full of emotion.  I saw it come up on a number of sites top 20 Christmas movies of all time.  Thought I would give it a shot.  Like others say, just like Gigot.  But this is much updated version.  Sad movie, but also a great movie.  It goes great with Christmas Story, Christmas Vacation, 34th street, Its a Wonderful Life...",1331856000,,392,4.133333333333334
2235311,5,B0007R4TIU,"I had seen this on TV years ago and copied it to video -- poorly. I then transferred it to DVD, but couldn't skip the commercials.

2235328,4,B0007R4TIU,"I am a fan of the original film 'Gigot' this film is based on, but after seeing the original, it just seems a little inferior. Macy, Rickles and the rest of the cast are in good form in this sometimes sad, but sweet and inspiring story that was adapted by a story written by comic legend Jackie Gleason. If I had never seen the original, I would have bumped it up another 1/2 star. It's well worth seeing and will bring a tear to your eyes before it's over.",1238284800,2,457,4.146067415730337
2235329,5,B0007R4TIU,"I really enjoy movie, it seems that these days ever movie-show there has to have an air of homosexuality. You were knit in you mothers stomach by God all mighty and he hates that sin as others,  SO you choose to be homosexuality just like you choose to be fat or predigest. Hollywood makes it like it is like eyes hair.. it is not!  So the movie was refreshing.",1232841600,,361,4.217391304347826
2235330,4,B0007R4TIU,"(Note: This review was written by my wife, Laura...)

A spiritual domino effect is displayed in this provocative film as two unlikely souls come together to show each other what it means to love and heal. The movie immediately pulls you into the harsh reality of their world, which might be too harsh for some viewers. Drug use and despair are not uncommon in this film as it paints the picture of how disconnected the characters feel.

Everything happens for a reason and there is hope for brighter days even in the most desolate of circumstances is what you will find by this almost too realistic film. You will laugh, you will cry, but you may find that, although there is much wisdom and love in this movie, you may not enjoy being pulled through the mud to get there.",1222128000,,772,4.507142857142857

2235333,5,B0007R4TIU,"I first saw this movie when it originally aired on Television and have loved it since.  It gives me goose bumps, chills, and tears and all for the best reasons.  It is a story hope and tragedy; sacrifice and struggle; insecurity and trust.  This is an excellent movie.",1174521600,2,268,4.541666666666667
2235334,5,B0007R4TIU,"Everyone, at least by now, already knows that this is a remake of a previous movie, and therefore they should know the basic story. If not, then just read any of the other reviews posted here. Having said that, let's get right to my review. William H. Macy, who plays the main character of this film, is outstanding as usual. His character is a deaf-mute, and therefore never says a single word. Through his excellent performance, Mr. Macy manages to convey exactly what his character is thinking and feeling. In fact, you can almost sense exactly what he would say, if his character could speak. Mr. Macy is in excellent company, as well. There are many fine performances from the supporting actors....Don Rickles, Catherine O'Hara and Ned Beatty....to name a few. With all due respect to Mr. Macy (who I think is always good), I was most impressed with Keke Palmer's performance, as the abandoned girl who befriends William H. Macy's character. It would be so easy for a child actor to over-play this kind of role, or make it seem as though the performance was forced out of him/her. But I am here to tell you all, that this actress makes her performance seem so real and natural. And she is incredibly likeable as well. Based on this performance alone, I think Keke Palmer should have a bright future in acting. She is amazing, and deserves all the praise she receives. And despite the theme of this film, it never gets sappy, or too sweet. An interesting story, along with fine performances across the board, will make this worth your while.",1148428800,,1545,4.6838235294117645
2235335,5,B0007R4TIU,"Of our approximately 1200 DVDs, this is one of my top five favorites.  I cannot think of another movie where the lead actor never utters a word, yet expresses so much emotion.  This is really a story of tragedy and redemption.  Unlike so many so-called ""Christian movies,"" God, faith, prayer, etc. is never mentioned.  But it is shown by example.  The First Commandment is to love God; the Second is to love others.  Gigot shows this by loving little Lou even though her mom is a prostitute and junkie, and Lou is an undisciplined handful.  He does this selflessly in spite of his own limitations (being mute) and hidden tragedy.

When things get to their lowest, and all seems hopeless, Gigot returns to church, although he has apparently not gone in years.  After he reverently looks at the statues and plaques, in a state of prayer, he leaves the church renewed.  It is then that redemption and positive changes takes place in his and Lou's life.

For parents who would like to show their kids movies with positive Christian or Spiritual (i.e. Godly) values without ramming religion down their throats, ""The Wool Cap"" is a  wise choice.",1136073600,6,1139,4.725888324873097
