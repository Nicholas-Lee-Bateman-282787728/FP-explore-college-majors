8687442,1,B00PCSVMHU,"The trio of films contained are extremely low budget and terribly produced. one film was very grainy and it was done in short clips as story progressed another was like a poorly done home movie the third was poorly acted and done as a low budget horror story all in all it was a waste of money. the packaging was highly misleading, the cover has nothing to do with the stories contained herein. and the secondary title can barely be applied. So I would advise people to not buy this product. Unless you really, really like bad cheesy movies",1462320000,,540,4.4646464646464645

8687445,3,B00PCSVMHU,"This disk contains three movies and none of them make any sense. Movie one: 1-1 1/2 stars. Movie two: 3 1/2-4 stars. Third movie: NEGATIVE 5 stars. The first one has one women that is topless for most of the film. The second movies through most of the film has three women topless, but at the end you get a few more. You also get a couple different women giving flashes of full frontal. The third one has no nudity and is the worst of the three. The only good thing about it is at the end of it when people start getting killed so you don't have to watch them anymore.",1432944000,9,568,4.080357142857143
8687446,1,B00PCSVMHU,I do not recommend buying this movie. The cover and description of this movie make it sound like a classic horror movie. I thought it was a big waste of time & money. Low budget and amateur acting throughout.,1421971200,5,208,4.358974358974359
