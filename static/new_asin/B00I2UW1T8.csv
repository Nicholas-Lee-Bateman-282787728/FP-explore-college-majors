8638405,5,B00I2UW1T8,"Every decade or so there comes onto the musical scene a star that shines with uncommon brilliance amid the galaxy of competent young solo artists first making their way into the limelight. So it is with the young lady featured here on this wonderful new DVD recording of two staples of the violin repertory. Tianwa Yang is a violinist's violinist. She is possessed of a formidable technique: flawless intonation, an impeccable bow arm, left hand articulation second to none, and some of the cleanest octaves and harmonics I have encountered to date. I would be more than satisfied to stop here, but there is so much more. Ms. Yang plays with a musical conviction and maturity far beyond her tender age of 27. Her tone is sweet, but never syrupy. Her vibrato is fast, but well centered and always varied to suit the phrasing. Her interpretations are kept within tasteful bounds, stylistic, individual and passionate at times, but never to the point of gratuitousness. In short, this is some of the finest violin playing I have heard in recent years. The DVD also features a couple of bonus selections. The encore is the great Solo Sonata #3 (""Ballade"") by the Belgian violinist-composer Eugene Ysaye. And the second Bach Partita featuring the monumental Chaconne is beautifully played in period style, but never to the point of being pedantic. Of particular note is the wonderfully connected double stop and chordal playing, reminiscent to me of the late Henryk Szeryng. Listeners should take special note of the Ysaye, since Naxos will be releasing the entire set featuring Ms. Yang in May of this year. I personally plan to be at the head of the line to purchase that disc. Until then, this DVD will continue to occupy a prominent place in my collection. Highly recommended.",1396137600,2,1775,4.880794701986755
