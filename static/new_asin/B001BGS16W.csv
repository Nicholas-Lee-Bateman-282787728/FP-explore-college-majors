3491443,5,B001BGS16W,"I saw this when first came out but not since. I forgot how great it was. A classic. Love those 50 theme movies especially since I wasn't born
yet and use to listen to my Pop's old records and wear his old leather jacket. I still have it. The acting from all these guys when they were
young was incredible except for Cruise who still can't act. The writing and directing is excellent. It's one of the best movies ever made. It
is witty funny with action and suspense and sad at the same time. ""stay golden Pony Boy"" was one of the things me and my friends use
to say all the time. They still made great movies back then. Too bad they can't make anything even 1/2 as good today!",1522022400,,676,4.128787878787879

3491446,1,B001BGS16W,"The dramatic background sound/music from the original movie was replaced in this version by corny rockabilly music that ruins the dramatic scenes, like when Ponyboy gets hit by his brother & when Johnny kills the Soc and throughout the entire movie!
They polluted a classic film with a completely unnecessary soundtrack addition that can't be turned off in the features menu.
If someone watches this movie for the first time with the new music, they'll immediately see the film as a joke because it trivializes every scene. And for those like me that love the original, it's an ear sore and cinematic travesty. I'm writing this while watching it and I'm laughing during all the dramatic scenes because of this stupid music.
Definitely a studio/executive approved addition. I hate exec's that haven't got a clue about taste or artistic integrity. Probably a SJW made these additions so any young person watching it will look away and get on their phone. Unbelievable!!!",1521849600,,968,5.0186335403726705

The story of poor greasers. Johnny and Ponyboy get into trouble. The way it is filmed, the way the actors act, the story line, everything makes it seem real. It makes you want to be on scene, being Ponyboy.

3491519,1,B001BGS16W,I don't even want to give a one star. The package it came in looked perfect. Unfortunate the dvd of The Outsiders itself was BLANK! No movie on it at all.,1512172800,,154,4.0
3491520,5,B001BGS16W,Good copy and easy to navigate and read.,1511740800,,40,4.125
3491521,1,B001BGS16W,"Before I start let me just say I'm a big fan of The Outsiders I read the book in high school and saw the movie and loved both. I don't mind the extra scenes even though some were completely irrelevant and added nothing to the story or characters and I definitely think the different opening scene worked better than the theatrical version. That's okay though because this is supposed to be the complete novel and be more faithful to the source material.

 So why did I give this one star? Well, to put it simply for you they replaced the original score with Rumble music. The kind of music that plays during a fight scene but it sounds so cheesy and out of place especially during scenes that are intended to be emotional. And I'm talking EVERY scene. The scene where Ponyboy remembers visiting the country with his parents. The scene where Darry hits Ponyboy and he takes off running. The scene where Ponyboy and Johnny rescue the kids from the burning church, yep Rumble music instead of the intense original score. And to make matters worse they even changed the music during the big Rumble  between the greasers and the socs towards the end with the same stupid music you hear all throughout the movie.

What was wrong with the original score and why did they have to change it? That stupid Rumble music is just out of place and doesn't fit in with the movie at all. Thankfully I still have my DVD copy of the theatrical release and I encourage all of you to avoid this Blu-ray.

I realize it probably sounds like I'm making a big deal over replacing the film's original score but if you actually watch this you'll see what I mean and trust me you'll be shaking your head throughout the entire movie It's so laughable. If you want to see The Outsiders then watch the theatrical release. If you want the complete novel just read the book. This is a perfect example of something that's not broken and doesn't need to be fixed. They should have added in the extra scenes and left the score alone, only then it would be watchable.",1511568000,,2030,4.475675675675675

3491523,5,B001BGS16W,"This 1983 movie is a classic and must-have for the DVD library!!  It tells a story of boys growing to be ""real"" men, and the challenges they - the ""greasers"" face against the preppy ""socials"" of their time, and the struggle to survive in their world without traditional parents.  This movie was the launching pad for many of its heartthrob actors - Rob Lowe, Ralph Macchio, Matt Dillon, C.Thomas Howell, Tom Cruise, Patrick Swayze, Leif Garrett, Emilio Estevez- and also stars Diane Lane,  Seriously, you cannot get a much better cast then that.

3491569,3,B001BGS16W,"As the DVD states, this is the version that follows S.E. Hinton's novel of the same name. For those who have read the novel, you will appreciate this version. For those who have not read the book, but watched the movie, you will enjoy the additional scenes that include more, shared screen time with the characters that the original theatrical release appeared to have limited. Additional scenes include events that lead to that fateful night in the park and the aftermath of the rumble. The problem I do have with this version is that the original soundtrack from Carmine Coppola was completely replaced with songs from the era from Elvis Presley to The Marketts Out of Limits. Although playing music from the era works well for movies like American Graffiti and Stand by Me, it does not work well with The Outsiders. The original theatrical release did include two songs from the era, but it worked because it was not overdone. Because the new soundtrack plays music that does not go well with the scenes, the soundtrack is now a distraction. It takes away the intensity of events and the emotional aspect of the characters. The rumble scene is a perfect example. Those who have read the book and watched the movie know that the climatic confrontation between the rival groups was a lot more than just a gang fight. The original sound score captured the intensity and anticipation of this inevitable fight. Unfortunately, the new soundtrack turns this scene into a typical gang fight that moves so quickly that it loses its meaning. I had forgotten how much I love this movie and that is why I am giving it three stars. But the new soundtrack is distracting and makes it hard for me to enjoy some of the scenes in this movie. If it wasn't for the distracting new soundtrack, I would have given this DVD five stars.",1501372800,,1816,4.678125

Then I realized the soundtrack for this blu ray director's cut was changed. This was really edited from the original movie. The introduction was also changed. Adding new scenes didn't really help this movie either. But what really hurts is that they swapped the original soundtrack for rock music. It didn't have the same dramatic feel. It felt more like an action flick. Beware Outsiders Fans. Hold on to your original DVD version. I wish this blu ray was released with 2 versions. Theatrical and Director's Cut.

3491608,5,B001BGS16W,"The Outsiders is a 30+ year-old movie, there isn't a lot of value in reviewing the story, directing, acting, etc. these many years later. Some people will like it, some wont.  I saw it for the first time in early 2017 on one of those obscure old-movie channels on cable and got hooked. So much so that I researched the story and became involved with the restoration project of the Outsider house in Tulsa. And  I bought my own copy of the movie. So this review will focus primarily on my satisfaction (or not) of the physical Blu-Ray copy of the movie, not of the content of the movie itself.

To be fair, watching a movie on a classics movie channel is pretty brutal  filled every few minutes with commercials, mediocre video quality and barely intelligible audio quality. The poor audio quality on cable was one of the main reasons I wanted to see the movie again, I missed so much of the dialogue the first time around.

Lets be honest, a movie this old, and one that was made on such a low budget, isn't he best candidate for Blu-Ray distribution. Its not like buying a current digitally produced movie on Blu-Ray or even watching an old classic that has been digitally restored frame-by-frame.  My hope was that at least it would look better than what I saw on TV and I had high hopes that the audio track would be cleaner and easier to hear.  A secondary benefit (now that I have a more vested interest in the whole Outsiders mystique) is that the Blu-Ray version is supposed to contain more of what was in S.E. Hintons original book.

The movie was shot with a stereo soundtrack so despite the 5.1 designation on the packaging it's not going to be true multi-channel sound. But on my system it does have a satisfying surround effect and ambience. Some of the dialogue is still obscured but there are director's notes indicating that it was recorded that way with some audio purposely overlapping for effect. In any case it was much easier to understand the audio on the Blu-Ray than was the TV broadcast movie (played through the same audio system).

It's more challenging to discuss the visual quality, keeping in mind that this movie was shot some 35+ years ago. To add to that this movie was purposely shot with lighting, filtration, lenses and processing to evoke a 1950's era. I can report that watching the Blu-Ray disk was a marked improvement over the broadcast image and that the colors are deep and saturated with a dynamic range well-suited for typical modern TV screens.

Bottom line: the Blu-Ray copy doesnt disappoint. The audio is indeed a huge improvement over the cablecast and while still old, scratchy and dated it is definitely more intelligible.  The visual quality to my eyes doesnt look too much different, I suspect the source for the broadcast movie is the same as they used here.

The real treasure is in the added material on the Blu-Ray disk. It is certainly worth the price of buying the disk.",1496880000,,2929,4.600767754318618

I had such high expectations. I read a blurb in the back of the book about how Francis Ford Coppola brought the novel to the screen. Sadly, what I got was a splash -- a mishmash of scenes from the book thrown together to make a semi-coherent story that, as my daughter told me, left so much out that you didn't GET who the characters were or their relationships, which is the core of the story.

3491692,3,B001BGS16W,"I find the story sad, however inspirational. It points out the truths in Johnny Cade's eyes. I like how he wished we lived in a world somewhere where there are no labels of socials or greasers. He wanted it all to be gone. He was tired of being called greaser. He only wanted to be called Johnny. He had his reason and he was traumatized by those who ganged up on him. And he had enough problems at home, he should've been taken away from that. No wonder he struggles with severe anxiety and eyes filled with anger towards his folks. He defends himself and is a true friend, when he and a friend were in trouble he did what he thought was right and it's protect them both when they weren't looking for a fight. They wanted to be left alone in the park and the socials wouldn't leave them alone. It shows the true meanings of nothing gold can stay forever, like in Robert Frost's poems, which is one of my favorites to hear in creative writing when I was in high school.",1485302400,,969,4.243243243243243

This is a review on the outsiders.

My 6th grade son said this is the first book he ever really enjoyed reading, and it is required in his school.

S.E. Hinton wrote it when she was only 16, and her insight into teen angst may explain why adolescents identify with Ponyboy so strongly. Readers find plenty of action and an idyllic view of friendship, a major concern for teens. Teenagers love this book; it teaches them that they can enjoy reading, as Ponyboy already knows.",1480032000,,618,5.844444444444444

3491789,4,B001BGS16W,"Reading the reviews of this expanded version is interesting. As a middle school English teacher who teaches this great book each year, I have been somewhat unhappy screening the original theatrical version as a culminating activity. The casting is the real stand-out. The film itself is earnest, though I find Copolla's direction of actors to be lacking. As someone who works with high school actors on stage, there are cringe-worthy moments of melodrama or just wooden acting that I would not allow on my stage. It's hard to believe that a revered director didn't see these weak moments or have the ability to fix them. I've heard several references to the new score, and I agree with those who point out that the surf rock really fails during the heavy-hitting moments. The cheerfulness of that music just does not work. On the other hand, it works far better than the original in all but the most serious scenes. (Though it is arguably a little too obvious at times they're getting on the train, so let's do...a classic train song. Not terrible, but a little paint-by-numbers.) The complaints about the new score, though, seem not to acknowledge how mismatched (IMO) the original score was. A few reviewers have called it a ""gorgeous orchestral score"", but the syrupy strings are as mismatched as the surf rock during the rumble. (And for that matter, the triumphalism of the sweeping orchestral score at the end of the rumble completely misses the point that the victory is hollow, not triumphant.)  It feels like a score straight out of The Godfather. I've always disliked that score, so, while I would have made some different decisions with the new one, I think the change made sense and is an improvement.

On balance, The Complete Novel is a better choice to show my students.",1478044800,,1785,4.830065359477124

And the editing was bad.  I have a hard time Coppalla really directed this...no, wait, there's his daughter in the Dairy Queen scene.  Crap, he really did do this to movie goers.

It plays like this 90 minute movie was supposed to be 2 hrs but some executive saw it was a ""Teen"" film and screamed ""Those idiot children can't sit still that long!  Take out all the story and just leave the action bits!""

Why is Ponyboy writing?  Why is he writing about coming out of a theater during the day?  He's sitting alone at home at night.  Why is Johnny so afraid all the time?  What's the deal with the Socs?  Wait, who's Sodapop?  Is that him?  Wait, who is Cruise playing?  Are they all related somehow?  What in the WORLD is with that theme song?!  Why is Ponyboy talking about sunsets all of a sudden?  Uh, Ralph, that's not how to act dead.  Why is Dally so pissed?  He hated the kid, now he loves him?  Who did what now?  Why?  WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?!

3492022,5,B001BGS16W,"This is a sad story but I want to share.
My uncle was burned when he was young and had a rough life afterwards.
He recently passed away in early October of 2015 after a battle with substance abuse.
A couple of days before he passed I called him and caught up with him (he lived down the road but I never really saw him, busy life, blah blah blah), I could tell he was out of it and not doing well.
When we were getting off the phone he said ""Stay gold, ponyboy"" and I didn't get the reference and he hung up.
That was the last thing he ever said to me.
After he died, I googled that quote and saw it was from this movie and my grandma told me it was one of his favorites so I ordered it and watched it.
When Johnny said ""Stay Gold, Ponyboy"" to him right before he died from his burns I lost it.
I felt such a loss for my uncle I was never really close to. He was my Godfather and uncle but I never really, really knew him, but I did know that my uncle LOVED sunsets just like Ponyboy.

3492046,5,B001BGS16W,"The book The Outsiders written by S.E. Hinton was made into a movie and was directed by Francis Ford Coppola. I chose to do a review on the movie because it is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
The movie was shot in Tulsa, Oklahoma in the same areas that S.E. Hinton wrote about. The location couldn't have been more perfect because all though Tulsa isn't the most gorgeous place in the whole world but, they managed to make it look beautiful and interesting. If you have read the book the location is everything you would expect and more.
Francis Ford Coppola did an amazing job directing this movie. He really let the actors make the character theirs. For example in one scene a hat flew into the shot, it was some guy's hat that had accidently stepped in front of the fan that was making the wind. Francis didn't stop recording and two-bit (emilio estevez) just ran and grabbed it and kept going on with the scene. He just let everyone act and make the movie great. The movie isn't perfect but it's real.
There were a lot of stars in this movie. C. Thomas Howell played the young and innocent Ponyboy Curtis, and his brothers Sodapop Rob Lowe and Darry Patrick Swayze. Some other actors were Emilio Estevez, Tom Cruise, Ralph Macchio, and Matt Dillon. This cast is legend. The movie had amazing music. Most of the songs were Elvis Presley and they were edited and placed in the movie perfectly.
The movie is about the greasers (the lower class) and the socs (the high class) and the things teens went through living in Tulsa Oklahoma in the 1960s. Ponyboy and his friend get into trouble and have to find there way out of it without getting caught by the cops. After they get back in town it's war between the two classes and in all the madness two of Ponyboys good friends die. He goes back to school has to raise his grade and he wrote about his life. And The Outsiders was born.
 If i were to rate this movie it would be a five out of five. I definitely recommend watching it because it is a great movie with fantastic actors. The outsiders came out in 1983 but it's still relatable in a lot of ways.",1460592000,,2113,4.362944162436548

I recently ordered the DVD so my daughter could watch because she also read the book in school.  I was surprised, for a movie made in the 80's, she actually liked it quite a bit.  The story really hits home even to this day when kids are so quick to judge other kids just for the way they grew up or what they wear to school, add to that a group of boys full of testosterone just ready to prove how tough they are.  Really a great classic 80's teen movie with a story line that really hits home, and also a movie that helped launch the career of several actors including Tom Cruise, Patrick Swayze, Ralph Macchio, Rob Lowe, and C.Thomas Howell..

Movie just does not capture the same magic for me. Matt Dillon, Emilio Estevez, Swayze and especially whoever plays Johnny were definitely stand out performances. Didn't really like the performance from whoever played Ponyboy Curtis, felt like Soda Pop was left out of the story. Cherry Valance was also excellent. I mean really, all in all a pretty solid movie, just felt rushed and it has to compete against a legendary book and Francis Ford Coppola's other work. This film just doesn't have the breadth and sense of life that his other films have. I feel this story is still very relevant today, showing the kind of dilemmas young (typically minority) people are dealing with because of joblessness, an unfair distribution of wealth, lack of fairness in the justice system, and the cyclical nature of poverty and violence in general that's still playing out in a lot of Midwestern, rust belt, western and southern towns and cities",1449187200,,1091,4.808510638297872

3492193,5,B001BGS16W,"a classic movie with alot of great upcoming and rising actors in the likes of patrick swayze, rob lowe, tom cruise, emilio estevez, matt dillion and the beautiful diane lane. i remember reading the book and seeing the movie in english class in highschool decades ago and i thought it was alright back then but revisiting it now, it is clearly a great movie with great cinematography and visuals. . .nuisances and subtle things you don't catch or pick up as a young adolescent teen.

the movie itself is almost poetic in its visuals and delivery by francis coppola and besides a few bad words and some violence, it's a fairly innocent pure movie that kids and most families can watch. i think that's one thing that is refreshing about the movie itself, it's got plenty of action, drama and tuff guy mentality and it's rating is PG, in our current hollywood movie world of brutal violence, sex, cursing and perversion. .this is kinda refreshing and surprising. then again the movie was made in 1983 but still i applaud them for keeping the movie clean

even if you're not a ""greaser"" or ""soch"". .most people who relate or like this movie are probably more of the greaser type. i've always wanted to go as a greaser for halloween, i may do that next year",1446768000,,1251,4.580357142857143

The actors chosen for the roles are perfect and just do a great job bringing the characters to life. This movie is action filled there is always either something sad, violent, or happy going on. If you read the book and watch the movie, you will notice that a lot of things are different or some things are cut out. But there is an extended version that will make more sense and help you understand everything a lot better. especially if you haven't read the book yet.

Otherwise, everyone else became great stars of their own.

It's interesting to see all these mega-star actors at the birth of their careers, but other than that, really no redeeming value to me. The sound track is out of place, the story and dialog are campy, and really, I think the acting is not so great. Perhaps the scenes featuring Lowe which were cut from the film would have made a huge difference - I may watch ""The Complete Novel"" re-release to find out, but haven't yet.",1436140800,,614,4.54054054054054

There are not as many opportunities to connect with the characters in the film version as there are in the novel, but a classic non-the-less. A great movie to add to a classic collection. As a teacher, I like to show the film to my students and discuss their outrage when the film does not show some of their favorite scenes. Some characters from the novel are not justified in the film, or mentioned at all. Overall, with the help of S.E. Hinton, and the location the same as the book, it is one of the better book to movie renditions.",1433721600,,642,4.31404958677686

I felt like I couldn't hear what was going on in the movie cause the music was overpowering. That's a small complaint though, I still loved it. I work with a group of visually impaired and blind kids at a high school. I was reading this book to them as part of the curriculum. When we finished the book, we got to watch the movie.

He read it through to the finish on a warm summer day - the first time he'd read a book through to the ending!

This tale has helped to encourage youth, especially adolescent boys, to become willing readers. S.E. Hinton weaves an enthralling, adventuresome story of this group of boys and young men from the less-affluent side of town. She uses well-crafted dialogue and in-depth character development to draw the reluctant reader into as world of difficulties, challenges, and small hopes. The Outsiders has been recommended reading for school kiddos over the past thirty-plus years - and it should remain so! The Outsiders",1428710400,,913,4.852564102564102

The movie's list of actors (who would gain later popularity) is surprising.  They did a descent job, as did the director.  The editor, however, left too much of the character's souls on the editing floor.  In the end, it felt like a short glass of concentrated, brand-X orange juice.  It pushed the actor's careers but did little to familiarize you with the lives of characters in the book.",1428624000,,520,4.65934065934066

So the lines end up sounding sort of wooden and the action you do see isn't real deep. What motivates the characters, and why should we care about themmost of that is lost.

One thing almost killed the whole movie for me...THE MUSIC!!!  It turned the movie's scenes that were supposed to be filled with tension and drama into this cheesy 60's movie.  Scenes, like the park scene and the sunset scene, didn't need the loud, obnoxious music blaring in the background.  It was unnecessary and distracting.  I'm currently unsure about how I feel for the movie as a whole.  I keep thinking back to the original and the scenes that were added by themselves and I'm happy.  Then, I try to watch the complete novel version and I have to grit my teeth and wince during some of my favorite parts.",1418688000,,854,4.382165605095541

The picture and sound quality is perfect and the extras  are well worth a look at.. I love the Coppola commentary.

What I hadn't noticed then was how beautifully filmed it was and the music score was very good also. Probably the best thing about the re-watch was seeing some of the actors that went on to become quite famous and how bad they were in this film.

3492637,5,B001BGS16W,"In the film Johnny and Ponyboy are low class boys always getting picked on by the Socs, the higher class boys. Johnny and Ponyboy go to the drive-in theater and start talking to the Socs girlfriends. Johnny and Ponyboy get confronted by the Socs later that night. Johnny ends up killing Bob but he saves Ponyboy life. Johnny  and Ponyboy seek Dallas help and they run away to an abandon church. In the end Johnny and Ponyboy return home as heros for saving the kids from the fire. The Socs tell Ponyboy about the rumble being caused by Bob's death. Ponyboy and his brothers win the rumble but lose Johnny. Dallas becomes crazy and robs a convenient store and gets shot by the Police.

This film is a very educational and realistic it shows how life in the old times was all about low class and high class. How girls love being with bad boys and ignoring the good ones. It is educational by showing how each character solves their own problems.

I would recommend this movie for ages thirteen and eighteen. It would greatly benefit them to see how old time were lived and was a total different Era. Young adults will also see how gangs and alcohol affect their life and will be life threatening. This is why I rate give it a five star review.",1406937600,,1241,4.434210526315789

3492640,5,B001BGS16W,"As a kid I loved the original, but after reading the book as a teen the movie became lacking and silly in its melodramatic trappings that the big moments always felt forced and unearned, it just didn't have that depth Coppola is known for putting into his movies, so when this came out on DVD years ago as the complete novel, he wasn't kidding, this is the novel on film with the exception of one scene omitted from the book between Randy and PonyBoy. This version has to be included as one of the greats of 80's cinema and one of Coppola's masterpieces. It's a complete 180 from the original, newly added scenes, a new soundtrack replacing the overdone music score with Elvis songs which make it more cinematic in my opinion. For what was once an okay movie with 80's teen beat actors is now an instant classic. I have no qualms of putting this version up there with Coppola's renowned work as the Godfather parts 1&2, Apocalypse Now, the Conversation. This is a gem waiting to be rediscovered which is more relevant today than it was released. See it alone, see it with your kids, your family, it'll be time well spent.",1406505600,,1121,4.5

3492659,3,B001BGS16W,"This is a poorly acted, thinly plotted movie.  Yes, it has lots of big stars and it is worth watching for them (hence the 3 stars), but I fear that the five star reviewers are grossly over rating this based on nostalgia for the time when they first saw this.  Pony Boy and Johnny are both pathetic in their roles, which explains why neither of them ever went on to make an actual good movie.  Look up Howell on Wiki.  Of his zillions of movies, the vast majority don't even have a Wiki article on them.  That means the movie stinks and went nowhere.  Nobody cares about this guy because he can't act.  Also, Johnny looks 14, but the actor is actually 21 or 22.  Huh?

Little makes sense in this movie and I don't think many rich kids (or even poor kids) were interested in rumbling in 1965 and having their brains beat out.  That is all nonsense.  Me thinks I smell a whiff of West Side Story, another stupid movie (with a score stolen from Beethoven).",1404604800,,952,4.292134831460674

I've read the book a million times and have always said that this film is one of the closest adaptations of a book I have ever seen.  To find out the rest of the material would be included, all these years later, was exciting.  My husband ordered it for me as he knew I would want to see it.  He had never seen it and I couldn't wait for him to see this classic.  What a let down - the music ruined the entire movie.  The new music made it seem campy and moronic.  Before, you felt the pain of the characters' as they faced their situations.  It all felt genuine and you could understand why so many of them went on to the careers they did.  If this had been the original, I doubt any of them would have had a career or that we would be talking about the movie.  The music changes the feel of the movie and almost lampoons the material.  My husband couldn't believe this was one of my favorite movies.  I tried to explain this was NOTHING like the movie I knew, but he will never know as he now has zero interest in seeing the original version.

3492756,2,B001BGS16W,"The Outsiders was my favorite novel as a teenager and I loved the film. Sure the acting was hammy, sometimes dire (Leif Garrett) and some scenes felt shoe horned but so much was going for it in terms of the great (then fresh) cast, the wonderful Carmine Coppola score, cinematography that captures the 1950s, soft lens, gorgeous Tulsa sunsets, and a feeling of relevance to teenagers who felt irrelevant in 1950's Americana.

I was looking forward to seeing the extra scenes in the new directors cut.  I will admit that most books don't transfer well in their entirety (Lord of the Rings) and intelligent cuts have to be made for pace and viewing relevance.  Although I did enjoy the new scenes and it did flesh out some of the secondary characters more (Soda Pop) you can see why the scenes were cut to make it a 'better' and more 'concise film'.

However, what he did with the score was horrible. Francis Ford Coppola said his fathers score was (treacly) and so replaced 90% of it with rockerbilly music.  Now here is the problems with that.  They NEVER match the mood of the scene and so each scene looks and feels awkward.  Also the way it was mixed has the songs louder than the dialogue so you find yourself frowning trying to hear the dialogue.

A flawed classic in original form ruined by a director who forgot some basic elements of film making.  This feels like a plodding, emotionally incoherent and overly loose film now.

Stick to the original.",1394841600,,1457,4.612403100775194

3492786,3,B001BGS16W,"about the price of rebellious youth is notable chiefly for the stunning cast of young actors who went on to rich and varied careers. In supporting roles, the film features the likes of Tom Cruise, Patrick Swayze, Diane Lane, Rob Lowe, Emilio Estevez, and Tom Waits, among others.

The story centers on two rival gangs in the early 1960s Midwest, and the violent turf wars that escalate and tragically claim young lives. C. Thomas Howell plays the central character who yearns to prove himself and be accepted by his older brothers' gang, while at the same time finding his first love and dreaming of a life beyond his dead end existence.

Geared toward the teenage crowd, the film nonetheless features some fine direction from Coppola in a story that evokes memories of the classic coming-of-age films of the 1950s.

This drama flick takes me back to memory lane to when I was 10 years old in the 4th during its theatrical release in the Spring of 1983.",1392595200,,953,4.6946107784431135

Hinton .... but the one thing i didn't like is they replace the music with  the50's classic rock music. the movie was great but the music sort of threw me off a little bit. i don't know what Francis Ford Coppola was thinking on that.  other than that the special edition was definately worth watching because it gave me a better idea of the movie. in my opinion i think its better to have the original version to go with it, so that way u can decide which version u would rather watch",1391817600,,592,4.276785714285714

This is worth picking up for the new scenes, and the special features, but through intense scenes like the park, and ponyboy being hit, are glossed over with 50's music that completely take you out of the moment. It isn't horrible, but i would stick with the standard edition, unless you want higher quality, and extras.

It was awesome getting to see the parts that were it in the book and not in the original movie.  I do have to say the music ruined some of the scenes. I don't know what the director was thinking when he put the music in. some of the music does work for some of the scenes but not for all, at some parts it was hard to hear the cast because of the music.

This movie did not contain that extra footage. The movie is still a good adaptation of the book, but I feel those deleted scenes are important.

The Outsiders (1983) opens up to the west side story of the Greasers. The pretty boys of Hollywood, C. Thomas Howell, Matt Dillon, Ralph Macchio, Patrick Swayze, Rob Lowe, Emilio Estevez, and Tom Cruise are the cowboys of the North Zone gang. In this story of the have and have nots. The Outsiders are wolves, warriors, outcast, and heroes in the Francis Ford Coppola classic. Young men becoming men that embrace their youth. They triumph the battles. Redirect their fears to become dynamic heroes. At the end of the day love holds them together.

Mortality affects us all, reminding us to be the best we can be as often as we can because our decisions reflect our lives. The Outsiders brought us etched moments like when Ponyboy and Johnny are reflecting in to pond; they have embraced their decision to take charge of their chosen destiny. Ponyboy and Johnny emerge as the dynamic duo from the esteemed cast. Their courageous decisions further alters their destiny.

Textured with the sounds of Stevie Wonder, Stay Gold was the theme music that reminded us to never forget the kid inside that sees the world as new.

He meant you're gold when you're a kid, like green. When you're a kid, everythings new. Dawn. Like the way you dig sunsets, Pony. Thats gold. Keep it that way. Its a good way to be.  Johnny Cade

Embrace your youth every new day. Appreciate the simple truths in life like the sunset.

Its a good way to be.  Johnny Cade  Start watching The Outsiders (1983) now!

Yeah, that is the thinking of a high school girl. It was like the modern day teensy flicks, with characters you can't stand, that are supposed to be overly tough (as a girl sees it) then sensitive (wimps). Geez, Fonzie could wipe out this whole gang.

Maybe if I saw it with the original soundtrack. The one that have now is so out of place, so bad, that you just can't watch the movie because the music is killing it. Reading the early credits, it was by a Coppola. In other words, by putting in his daughter, he ruined Godfather III, and now he has trashed this movie with more nepotism.

After she read the book, she watched the movie and said that the book and the movie were pretty similar.  Pony Boy and Soda Pop looked so much like her dad as a child that it was amazing.  Her dad passed away 5 years ago and it brought up a lot of discussion about him as a child and what he was like as a teenager.  You never know how something is going to interact with you.

The acting was very good but without reading the book, I had a little trouble keeping the actors straight.  I was amazed to see Tom Cruise's name in the credits because I hadn't noticed him in the movie.

It was very interesting to see all the actors, who filled the rolls and realze that most of them grew up to be very big stars as they progressed through their careers.

And where's that part where they guy yells ""Avenge me! AVENNNNNNNNGE MEEEEEE!!!!""  I guess they cut out that part?

I also don't remember it being so homoerotic. Lots of unnecessary touching and leaning on shoulders between these friends, climaxed with a lot of wrestling in mud.

I read the book many times when I was young, when I heard it was going to be made into a movie I couldn't wait but prepared myself for disappointment, so seldom is a movie as great as the book.

Pony-Boy to Cherry - (paraphrased) Can you see the sunset from the South side of town? We can see it real good from the North side too.

3493121,5,B001BGS16W,"Based on an eponymous novel, The Outsiders film details a brewing animosity between rival groups - the Greasers and the Socs - divided by socioeconomic status.  Attacked by a group of drunk Socs, the two weakest members of the Greasers, Pony Boy Curtis (C. Thomas Howell) and Johnny Cade (Ralph Macchio), are forced to defend themselves with a knife.  The result is tragic, and sets the stage for a final rumble between the groups, as well as a modicum of understanding between enemies.

C. Thomas Howell, Matt Dillon, Ralph Macchio, Patrick Swayze, Rob Lowe, Emilio Estevez, Tom Cruise, Diane Lane.  That, right there, is the murderer's row of young actors.  Janet Hirshenson did the casting for this film, and she is, as far as I'm concerned, the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me of casting directors.  Despite the fact she's also responsible for really introducing Megan Fox to the world via Transformers, The Outsiders is undoubtedly her magnum opus.

There isn't much that can be said about the Outsiders that hasn't already been said.  It's a classic tale thick with the themes of class-warfare, honor, and revenge, grouped alongside potentially the best cast in movie history with a hint of nostalgia thrown in for good measure.

I must say I was really excited to find out an extended version had been released. From the opening scene I was stoked! Buuuuuuut, then, like knives piercing the brain through the ears, the music started playing. What the he** happened to the original score by Carmine Coppola?? Even as a kid i remembered the music, and understood how the music added to the dramatic effect. I hate to say, but the new soundtrack almost ruined it for me. It made serious and dramatic scenes seem light-hearted and even comical at times. A great score can catapult a movie to greatness, which this score did, and now it's gone.

But my husband and I wanted the opportunity to watch it with our kids first.  Just as I remembered it, although some of the ""special effects"" are now dated, of course. Doesn't take away from the charm of this movie.  Was the acting amazing?  No.  But, so much fun to see so many of today's top stars in their youth, and at the beginning of their careers.  I thought Patrick Swayze shone in this as Darry, a young man walking the fine line between greaser, and appointed parent to his kid brothers.  Too bad Robb Lowe didn't have more to do here, as Soda Pop was a bigger character in the book.  In fact, many times through the movie, my children pointed out differences between the film and the book.  Why in the movie was it North and South, instead of East and West, for example.  They were bummed that there was a lot of important details left out... in their opinions!  A movie adaptation can only be so lengthy, right?  Like so many other films of the time, I'm not so sure that this one should be remade, but that's in the works.  Please leave ""The Breakfast Club"" alone!

Plus, all those additional scenes the book fans always wanted to see add much more depth and understanding to the story (even for those who haven't read the book). This version also seems much less corny to me as well. In addition to the movie, you also get two audio commentaries, which are both really good (though I prefer the one with the actors), and a bunch of behind-the-scenes and after-the-movie extras and tid-bits that are all really enjoyable.

I was twelve when I picked that book up and I think I read it constantly throughout the next two years. By the time I was fifteen, I had seen enough film adaptations to know that they rarely live up to the magic of a book. I fully expected this of The Outsiders.  I was disappointed then and I still find it lacking in depth of character and story. I just don't think it was translated well from print to screen. I have a certain sentimentality for the movie, but I think it falls short of all it could have been. In comparison, I believe That Was Then, This Is Now was wonderfully adapted for the screen.

3493196,5,B001BGS16W,"I remember seeing the original release of The Outsiders at the theater. It was an underwhelming experience. The pacing was odd. The transitions were a bit jarring. The music seemed much too lush for the story presented. I didn't sense that I was really getting to know the characters. It wasn't horrible. It just wasn't great. Just another day at the movies.

So I was intrigued when I saw the ""Complete Novel"" version of the film, only because it's Coppola and it makes one wonder what he has done with it.

I have not read the novel so I don't have much interest in questions of how ""faithful"" the movie is to the novel. But it is clear this was the motive behind this restructuring of the film, a motive talked about over and over again in the special features and reflected in the new sub-title: ""The Complete Novel"".

The point is that this cut of the film is an amazing movie. Unlike, in my opinion, the original cut released to theaters. The overly dramatic score has been trimmed back and replaced with some period music. The story is paced better. The time is taken to build up characters you care about (without the foreknowledge of having read the book). It feels more genuinely ""epic"" with a more detailed story line. And it presents some stunning cinematography and carefully crafted shots that now feel like they are arrived at properly. It's often stunningly beautiful to look at, with hints of John Ford, blended with some Technicolor sensibilities from the 1940's and 50's, mixed with some teen angst movie attitudes from the fifties and early sixties (mostly reflected in the actor's performances, which were carefully crafted and encouraged by the director).

I highly recommend this cut of the film. Not because it's more faithful to the novel, but because it's just a great movie.",1348531200,,1801,4.744408945686901

3493200,4,B001BGS16W,"Last night's bargain-rack movie was ""The Outsiders."" I found the DVD on the five dollar rack at Wal-Mart. It seemed like an interesting and promising movie. Actually, I found it to be rather uninteresting movie that became increasingly difficult to watch. I'm surprised. It had a big-name director, a lot of the photography was excellent, the cast was certainly all star, the story was based on an acclaimed novel and the acting was good. Somehow I just couldn't get into the social groups as the ""Greasers"" and the ""Socs."" Such divisions exist among young people, to be sure, and I always felt like one of the outsiders but I was never anything like the ""greasers."" It just didn't ring true. Well, this was early 60s in Tulsa, OK, and my experience was mid 50s in Boulder, CO. Was that the difference? Or was this story largely a figment of an overactive imagination on the part of the author and the director?

In any case, it was a well-done movie. Enjoy it if you can. I'm sure everyone will see parts of their own miss-spent youth within it. What it really reminded me of is how glad I was to get out of all that juvenile stuff and into a much more interesting adult world.

It is filmed in Cinemascope and reminds you of Gone With the Wind. The whole story is there so you get to know the brothers as a family instead of Sodapop and Darryl just appearing all of a sudden. You get to know all of the characters and storyline better. This came with Francis' explanation of what happened to the original and how being embarassed in front of his grand-daughter made him redo the movie. A must see for anyone who loved the book, the author, Coppola or just remembers the time when Emilio Estevez,Tom Cruise, Patrick Swayze and Ralph Macchio were young.

3493202,5,B001BGS16W,"I read the Outsiders book in 6th grade and instantly was floored. It was the first time is sat down and actually read an entire book in one sitting. Having been born in 1988 though, I wasn't even aware there was a film adaptation at the time. Once I found out I had to get it on DVD. I luckily and randomly stumbled upon it in a 5$ bargain bin at Walmart and promptly LOST IT, which is where Amazon came in. So anyways now on to the movie: I have to say, it's one of my favorites. Who hasn't felt like they we're Pony Boy at some point? That character I'm convinced, is me if I was male. I felt connected to the entire greaser gang except maybe the very young Tom Cruise who I actually found a bit obnoxious. Really though Coppola must've been attempting to corner the girl market because one look at the cast listing in this movie is basically the who's who of 80s boy crushes. Matt Dillon as Dallas Winston has to be my favorite along with C. Thomas Howell as Pony Boy. You can't go wrong with the rest of the boys either: Rob Lowe, Patrick Swayze, Emilio Estavez, Ralph Macchio, Tom Cruise, and even Lief Garret as a Soc. I also enjoyed the very young Diane Lane as Cherry Vallance. Watch this movie, embrace the crashing of the social clashes and the angst of a greaser, and have a doomed crush on Dallas Winston. And whatever you do ""Stay Gold Pony Boy""",1343088000,,1358,4.226923076923077
3493203,2,B001BGS16W,"I have never read the novel or seen the movie when I purchased this DVD, so I had no pre-concieved notions of what it should be like either way in regards to book/versus film. I decided to buy it after reading Rob Lowe's autobiography when he gushed about how good it was and how the extended version was the only one to see. Perhaps because I am not from the USA I do not understand the dynamics behind this story and group of young men but I found the movie to be really bad. I could not believe that Francis Ford Coppola directed this. It is certainly well below par and one of his worst efforts as far as I can see.. I agree with other reviewers that the music is jarring and seems to be inappropriate at times. The acting is below par too. I know that most of them were not that seasoned when this movie was made but with the exception of Ralph Macchio they are not that good. It appears to me that most of them seemed to be trying to do a James Dean ""Rebel without a cause"" characterisation  without his charisma or ability. Looking at Tom Cruise in this movie makes me cringe and brings to mind his appearance on Oprah when he did the couch jumping thing. I had little sympathy and connection with the characters...As played they were just a lot of testosterone filled young hoods filled with there own self importance and arrogance who went round looking for trouble...I was astonished at the end of the film that this is so popular....Maybe the book is better but after viewing this I won't be rushing to read it.",1342137600,,1522,4.321678321678322

3493212,3,B001BGS16W,"The Outsiders (1983) from Francis Ford Coppola is pedantic, no
doubt, as it demonstrates how a certain number of youths lose
their way as they move out of childhood, especially being exposed
to this, as they are required to bear more responsibilities, more
work, more effort and talent on their shoulders as time passes,
while quite the opposite occurs, unfortunately. It also
underlines the consequences of such a conundrum faced by those
youths.

Next, from an entertainment point of view, the movie suceeds in
captivating the audience, above all by focusing on the turning
point from youth to adolescent, when minds, bodies and spirits
evolve into new territory. As such, well-established stars since
20 years or more, are introduced to the public, such as  Matt
Dillon, Emilio Estevez, Emilio Estevez,  Patrick Swayze and
others, for example.

From a script writing perspective, this is particularly well
done, as it underlines the spiritual struggle of youths, in
forging their own identities, establishing their place in their
peer group at school, and in their communities. It shows the near
impossibility of being impervious to outside influences, whether
it is socio-economical, educational, or other.

The sound-track is repetitive, for unclear reasons, such as the
number ""Gloria"" frequently repeated throughout the picture, when
at least 10 or 20 more songs could have been added for more
balance.

The filming, as often is the case with Coppola, is outstanding
and spotless, if a bit dark at times (drive-in movie theatre,
night scenes, etc.)

In sum, this movie shines a light on adolesence in America, back
in the 1950's or 60's and that it's often too easy to take for
granted what experience has learned each and every one of us.",1333497600,,1746,5.126760563380282

3493214,3,B001BGS16W,"It's like watching a different movie, due to the change in tone. The original movie is loved by many, partly because of the beautiful score by Carmine Coppola, which provides emotional impact to key scenes. You're moved by the story and think of the movie for days long after you ""step out into the bright sunlight."" This new edition, however, replaces the original score with lighthearted rock-and-roll songs that completely suck the emotion out of dramatic scenes. There's a detached feel to the movie, and it becomes less engaging and more lightweight. You forget about it after it's over, and don't grieve over Dally or Johnny's fate or ponder the fact that there's still good in the world amidst social injustices, like you would have had you just watched the original movie.

Coming of age, social issues and the prisms through which people view the world are all universal themes that transcend time, and for that, you need a soundtrack that's classic, not necessarily one that's cool and hip.  Yes, the original music may have been melodramatic at times, but it was effective and produced the needed response from viewers, who actually feel for the characters and are engaged in the story.  Plain and simple, the new soundtrack ruins the movie.

However, I loved, loved the new scenes that fleshes out the other characters (such as Sodapop) and includes more scenes from the novel. So my suggestion is this: watch the first movie first, so you can actually care about the story and characters and fall in love with the movie. Then, watch this extended edition to see the missing scenes. I think people who watch the extended edition first consider the movie forgettable and boring. Those who see the original movie first find it a memorable and moving film.",1328745600,,1765,4.873333333333333

Even though the extra footage is great and some was definately needed in the original, I would still recommend getting the original version.

The music often doesn't fit with what is going on in the movie and ruins the feel as to what is happening. More times than I could count there was music with words being played at the same time that dialogue was happening and it was very difficult to hear the dialogue and the music drowned out the scenes. So much new music was added that it seems like there is not much of the movie anymore without annoying music happening.

3493218,5,B001BGS16W,"*Because Amazon does not distinguish between reviews for the original cut and the revised cut of The Outsiders, this review discusses both cuts.

Many differences exist between the original cut of The Outsiders and the revised cut. However, the most profound difference is the dramatic change of tone in the revised. The original cut, through its classic music (used sporadically) creates a melancholic tone. For me, the classic music makes me think about class conflict and highlights the deep friendship between Ponyboy Curtis and Johnny Cade. The classic music score is always appropriate in setting this mood. Furthermore, the classic music score is more intelligent and emotional than the revised, which makes the film far more relatable to people like me, who are not very interested in 60s rock and roll music or most films very popular to 21st century teenagers of lower social classes. Call me old fashioned, but I prefer classic music.

In contrast, the revised cut, by employed 60s period music including songs like ""My Hair is a Mess"" when Ponyboy and Johnny are giving one another haircuts, alters the tone and creates a light mood, almost as though Ponyboy and Johnny are enjoying cutting one another's hair and causing the other pain, which is a stark contrast to the original. The original cut, by not playing music during the haircut scene, highlights the loss of identity that the haircuts produce. Remember: to these young Greasers, their long, greasy hair is a substantial part of their identity and should not be downplayed by crass 60s music.

Secondly, the original cut focuses largely on the characters of Ponyboy and Johnny, with some time given to Dally. However, the revised cut widens the scope of the film to include more scenes in which other characters in the novel play a role, which somewhat diminishes the power of the relationship between Ponyboy and Johnny, which is quite strongly communicated in the original. Some scenes included in the revised cut do make sense. For instance, the scene in which the three Curtis brothers (after Johnny's and Dally's deaths) discuss how they only have one another and need to stand by one another. However, at other times, the revised cuts seen to take away from the message of the film. For instance, the scene in which Ponyboy asks an older man for directions to the location at which the abandoned church exists, simply adds a bit of humor to a film that is better communicated as a tragedy rather than a comedy. Adding comic scenes to the film as the revised cut does downplays its tragic elements, as does the rarely appropriate comic music. If the viewer is supposed to laugh when Johnny cuts Ponyboy's hair, the rock and roll music score is effective. In contrast, if the viewer is supposed to mourn the cutting of the hair as a loss of identity, the rock and roll score falls flat - in fact, it has the opposite effect.

Thirdly, sometimes the rock and roll music starts at an inappropriate moment, such as in the scene in which Dally robs the store. The music begins when Dally demands money rather than, as in the original, when the cashier shoots at Dally. Thus, the music focuses on Dally's actions as its basis for existence rather than on the cashier's actions. In the original, with its dun-dun da-da da-da classic music, which begins when the cashier fires two shoots, we, as viewers, are supposed to see Dally as somewhat of a victim. After all, Dally just lost Johnny, the only person about whom he ever really cared. Also, sometimes the rock and roll music of the revised cut, begins or continues through some of Ponyboy's and Johnny's more intimate conversations, which, in addition to altering their serious interpersonal meaning, makes hearing the words of the conversation more difficult than in the original cut.

Lastly, how a film ends is very important. The end of the original cut conveys Ponyboy's speech with very good and very melancholic classic music in the background, as though it is up to us whether we, as viewers, will embrace greater economic equality and secular humanism. In contrast, the revised cut downplays the original film's (and Johnny's) humanist message by having the less-effective and a bit too upbeat classical music of ""Stay Gold"" playing in the background.",1323216000,,4284,4.895316804407713

3493247,5,B001BGS16W,"The Outsiders, based on the novel by H.E. Hinton, and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, is an awesome film. Though the novels of H.E. Hinton are targeted to a teen age demographic, they are somewhat deeper than the average teenster fodder. They are deep, with characters that are at once greasers, and sensitive enough to quote Robert Frost poems by heart. Then there are the socs (pronounced so-shuz), the rich kids who attend social gatherings at the country club, when they're not drunkenly water boarding much smaller greaser kids that they outnumber two-to-one. The socs are not all bad, though. For instance Cherry Vance (Diane Lane) is not only scorchingly hot, she has a soft spot for Ponyboy Curtis (C. Thomas Howell), and would almost fall for his friend, Dallas (Matt Dillon) if he wasn't such a jerk.

Ponyboy has the soul of a poet in the body of a greaser. See Thomas Howl. Howl, Thomas, howl. It is amazing how well he carries the film when you consider all the young talent this film is packed with: Tom Cruise, Matt Dillon, Diane Lane, Rob Lowe (as Ponyboy's brother, Soda Pop, in his film debut), Emilio Esteves, Patrick Swayze, Tom Waits, and Ralph Macchio. While Howell is the lead, Ralph, as Johnny, is a close second. He is just a kid, but he's a young kid with an old soul. Though you might say that the other actors I mentioned all went on to bigger and better things, this may have been the zenith of Howell and Macchio's career. It is like the Robert Frost Poem that Ponyboy quotes:

Nature's first green is gold,
Her hardest hue to hold.
Her early leaf's a flower;
But only so an hour.
Then leaf subsides to leaf.
So Eden sank to grief,
So dawn goes down to day.
Nothing gold can stay.

Or, in the last words of Johnny to Ponyboy, ""Stay Gold.""

That was also the title to a great song that Stevie Wonder wrote for the film. It is a great Wonder ballad, with orchestration that may have been provided by Francis' brother Carmine, who did the music. Carmine Coppola was the dean of the Art Department when I went to San Francisco State--quite a flamboyant character who affected purple velvet capes, like he was some kind of Art Vampire. He was also Nicolas Cage's father. Another Coppola factoid is that Sofia Coppola played the young street urchin who tried to spare change Dally, Ponyboy, and Johnny.

Bottom Line is that The Outsiders is an amazing film that combines lyrical moments with the dramatic intensity of a clash of cultures: Greasers Vs. Socs. Meet you at the rumble, but remember, stay gold.

3493249,5,B001BGS16W,"I wasn't sure what was going to occur when I plopped the 1st DVD containing the ""special edition"" of THE OUTSIDERS into my player and settled back to watch. I wasn't wild about APOCALYPSE REDUX, Francis Coppola's recutting of his classic APOCALYPSE NOW. On that one, I strongly felt that there were a LOT of good reasons why things were removed from the original version in the first place, and most if not all of them should never have been reinstated. Happily, this is not the case with THE OUTSIDERS. Here, Coppola has followed practically to the letter the plot threads of S.E. Hinton's original novel and, in so doing, given us a great movie in place of a good one.

First of all, there is more of an established build-up of the characters and their setting. When Ponyboy Curtis, the ""greaser"" who is the primary character in the story, gets harassed and attacked by the ""socs"" on his way home from the movies and subsequently rescued by his fellow ""greasers,"" you get the picture of how things stand between the ""haves"" (the socs) and the ""have-nots"" (the greasers), plus you meet and get to know all of Ponyboy's inner circle right away; his two brothers Darry and Sodapop, Johnny, Dallas, Two-Bit, Steve and the rest. This goes a long way to giving the viewer much more empathy for what Ponyboy and Johnny go through, and it furnishes some pleasant surprises as well. Rob Lowe is an actor often dismissed as a lightweight, but this version of THE OUTSIDERS shows how good he really could be. As Sodapop, one of Ponyboy's two older brothers, Lowe shows a sympathy and depth as the middle brother trying to be conciliator between Darry and Ponyboy when they fight with one another. In fact, every single actor here gets further flexing of their wings in this version, and it works terrifically.

However one feels about Coppola's father Carmine's original score, the replacing of most of it with 50s and 60s rock'n roll throughout the film dramatically changes the feel of it...to my mind, for the better. Coppola explains that his father's original score was there to give the film a ""Gone With The Wind"" texture, in keeping with the way the Margaret Mitchell novel surfaces throughout THE OUTSIDERS (movie AND book) as one thing that has an impact on Ponyboy and his friends and family. Fine as a theory, but that original score felt downright soupy at times, and it was a little like getting hit over the head with how SIGNIFICANT certain scenes were supposed to be rather than letting the audience figure that out. The rock 'n roll gives the movie more of a sensibility like BLACKBOARD JUNGLE and other ""misunderstood youth"" pictures of the 1950s and 1960s, and it works really, really well. It makes ""Stay Gold,"" the theme song by Carmine Coppola and Stevie Wonder, stand out just that much more at the start and end of the film.

The abundance of extras on the 2nd DVD are mind-boggling and a treat for cineastes everywhere, but the main jewel in the crown is this restored movie, one that gives ""director's cut"" a good name. Nicely done!",1280275200,,3050,4.686567164179104

3493260,5,B001BGS16W,"As much as I loved the original movie, this version is by far superior. I'm just amazed that it wasn't released this way originally. I find it hard to believe that Francis Ford Coppola would allow a movie studio to force him to cut out scenes to make the movie shorter which is what I understood happened. I don't blame Rob Lowe and the movie fans for being unhappy about the original scenes being cut out. The movie makes a lot more sense with the deleted scenes put back in. The music is also better.

I also really enjoyed hearing the commentaries from the actors. I was disappointed that Emilio Estevez and Tom Cruise (for whatever reasons) did not participate in the commentaries. I loved all the bonus features. It was cool to see the young actors, including the ones who didn't make it into the film, audition. I only wish all the actors had been together to do the commentary, as Rob Lowe and Matt Dillon are recorded separately.

This new version is amazing and should be re-released in the theatres. I did notice, though, that there were a couple of scenes that were added in that were not even in the book. That's the only flaw I guess I would point out is that Coppola should have stuck to the book instead of adding scenes such as the courtroom scene which is dragged out into more of a trial as if Ponyboy was on trial for murder. In the book it seemed to me that the courtroom scene was really just to decide if Ponyboy should be able to continue to live with his older brothers. Also the scene near the end where Cherry snubs Ponyboy at school totally contradicted what I thought they had overcome through the whole ordeal. And it wasn't even in the book.

All in all, this is definitely worth having. I just wanted to see more of the actors' auditions and learn who all did try out. They mentioned some such as Dennis Quaid, Mickey Rourke and Val Kilmer but I wanted to know EVERYONE who was there auditioning! Still, this is a great dvd with great bonus stuff and a must-have for any fan of The Outsiders...",1272672000,,2025,4.394666666666667

3493269,4,B001BGS16W,"I loved watching this new version because of the new footage (what is better than The Outsiders? MORE of The Outsiders!). It introduces us to the characters better and answers a few questions (what is that thing on Ponyboy's neck?). These scenes were obviously not cut for cinematic, storyline or dramatic reasons. The only thing that is bothersome is the removal of the beautiful, melodic music that is its own character in the original film. It exists (sort of) in a couple of scenes, but for the most part the rock & roll 50's music that is laid over most of the footage (and which drowns out some of the dialog) takes away from the emotional aspect of the scenes. It is too upbeat or corny, or both in many scenes. But it's worth owning to see the extras, from test screenings to meeting the class that requested the movie be made, not to mention seeing the 2005 cast reaction to the scenes that were cut 25 years ago. I'll just keep my original VHS tape when I want to watch the version with the original music, the one that made me cry when the Greasers won victory in the rumble - a moment of pride that shouldn't be ruined by mis-matched music.",1262476800,,1152,4.413145539906103

3493272,4,B001BGS16W,"Recently I reviewed another film adaptation by the director Francis Ford of one of S.E. Hinton's classic tales of American teenage working class alienation during the 1950s-1960s, ""Rumblefish"". There the plot centered on the seemingly inescapable nihilism following the footsteps of a leader, and his ex-leader brother, of a by then pass&eacute; white teenage gang. That film presented the anguish of youthful working class alienation in a very different and much less glamorous light than the teenage angst films of my youth, like Marlon Brando's ""The Wild Ones"" and James Dean's ""Rebel Without A Cause"". I also mentioned in that review that I had been momentarily attracted, very attracted, to that `lifestyle', coming as I did from that stratum of the working class that lived with few hopes and fewer dreams. It was a very near thing that shifted me away from that life, mainly the allure of books and less dangerous exploits.

I did not feel that same kind of identification here in this otherwise outstanding tale of youthful working class alienation out in the heartland in the hill of Oklahoma, ""The Outsiders"". That, notwithstanding the fact that the main character and narrator, ""Pony Boy"", is also very attracted to books (although ""Gone With The Wind"" and the poetry of Robert Frost seem odd choices to go ga-ga over). The difference. In ""Rumblefish"", seemingly a much more experimental film on Coppola's part and a more searing look at working class youth on Hinton's part, the plot is is filled with examples of that unspoken danger, that unspoken destructive pathology and dead end nihilism that meant doom for at least some of the characters, and not just the easy to foresee one of early and untimely death that stalks those down at the edges of society.

Superficially, the plot of ""The Outsiders"" would have assumed that same fate for its characters. A small town out in the hill of Oklahoma where the class divisions are obvious has the working class ""Greasers"" lined up in combat against the middle class ""Socs"" with every clich&eacute; of the class struggle, except the political, thrown in for good measure. (Obviously portrayed, as well, note the sideburns long hair on the Greaser side and the chino pants on the frat guys side. You don't need a scorecard on this one.) In summary: the two sides clash over nothing in particular except ""turf"": hold grudges; seek revenge taking causalities, one fatally; and ending with a rumble where the Greasers have their momentary Pyrrhic victory.

Along the way there is plenty of time for youthful reflection by the narrator and his fellows about the ways of the class-ridden world, a few bouts heroism and a little off-hand (very off-hand) romance. As much as we know about the nature of modern class society this thing rings false. The moral here-even the most alienated Greaser, played to a tee by Matt Dillon, is really only searching for meaning to his life and a little society, only to get waylaid by that life in the end. Thus, this thing turns into something more like a cautionary tale than a slice of live down at the bottom edges of society. The more circumspect and existential ""Rumblefish"" gets my vote any day.

Note: Part of the problem with this film cinematically is that the leading male actors here, the likes of Rob Lowe, the late Patrick Swayze, Tom Cruise and Matt Dillon are all too `pretty' to be Greasers. Although one can appreciate the talent pool that came out of this film I know from real life that, while the ""greasers"" of this world may have some raw sexually attractions they would hardly grace the pages of ""Gentleman's Quarterly"", or some such magazine. These guys could. That is what rings false here, as well as the assurances, hammered home to us throughout the story, that in democratic America even the down-trodden can lift themselves up and succeed.

With its homoerotic scenes of pretty boys bonding and fighting, West Side Story style gangs, and decidedly old-fashioned sense of storytelling The Outsiders certainly does not stack up to Coppola's enduring classics, but it's fun in a goofy sort of way and you could do worse if you just want 90 minutes (in the unextended edition) of campy entertainment.

Hinton herself has expressed a preference for THE COMPLETE NOVEL DVD's opening, which provides a more gradual introduction to each of the boys in the gang.  It's truer to the book and gives viewers a better sense of the Greasers' personalities.

In addition to the opening, THE COMPLETE NOVEL DVD adds in other previously-unseen scenes and provides a new soundtrack, including Stevie Wonder's ""Stay Gold"" during the opening credits.

We were very excited to see a newly edited version of it on DVD.  Yes, it was great to see all of the previously unseen footage, but the new soundtrack was a big mistake.

It seems that the director went overboard with the music selections to the point of distraction.  There is hardly a moment of dialogue without surf music blaring in the background.  Much of the music did not seem appropriate within the context of the scenes, changing or ruining the mood at times.  I kept waiting for Pee Wee Herman to appear and dance the Tequila.

3493334,3,B001BGS16W,"First the Good:

I am a teacher and my students complain every year that the ""Ponyboy gets jumped"" scene is not in the original.  I thought the extra footage in the beginning really helped a lot.  It stayed much closer to the book, but with anything the book is always better.  Read it.  I really liked the character development.  The original movie stands well enough on its own, but if you hadn't read the book there are definite gaps.

The Bad:

The new soundtrack is awful.  I am no Stevie Wonder fanatic, but this retro 60s music did NOT fit the mood in many places.  It was so distracting that I almost turned it off.  (hence my 3 stars and really thought about 2 stars)

With all the extras I would have liked to see a flash back of Johnny getting beat up and more ""bonding"" time between Cherry and Ponyboy while they were in line.  The book develops this so much better.

I also did not like Ponyboy and Cherry meeting up at the end and she ignores him.  The book leaves that much more open ended and in fact implies that Cherry and Ponyboy are the true ""Outsiders"" because they can see ""outside the box"" of their respective gangs.  Randy and Johnny also fit into that category.

I have never liked the Dally death scene in the movie.  In the book it was more suicidal and he was in control of his own death and the movie makes him out to be a victim.

All in all I wish they would have alternate sound tracks so I could play the original score, or they could have just hired someone to write a new score.  The movie and book have sold enough copies that they should have gotten in right.

I plan on showing the old version to my students or possibly show the first 20 min of this one and then pop in the old one.",1185494400,,1721,4.185975609756097

Almost every single kid I taught loved both. The bonus features prominently feature the author, Susie Hinton, and the students and I were fascinated by them. I highly recommend this set to any fans. If you have never read the book or seen the movie, I advise you to get the book, especially if you're an adolescent. I will always have fond memories of reading this book in one sitting with complete awe when I was twelve or so. I cried and pondered the meaning of life. The book and movie are a joy to share with the younger people in your life. Many of my students said it was the first book they'd ever read that they liked.",1182902400,,804,4.296052631578948

I remember watching it in school as well.  The original movie was playing on cable, starz or encore but I could never catch it from the begining. I found this version, so I bought it. I could not wait for it to arrive.

When I saw it, I was blown away, with the new style, because of the music of the day, the new begining and end, and other added scenes through out the middle of the movie.

It was more of a complete story then the original version, made more sense. Movies don't make sense because of scenes cut out, plot wise and story wise. LIke in ""Back to the Future,"" I saw a cut scene where Michael J. Fox, drugs his character's father when he tells him, he's darthvader from planet valcon. The next day fox asks ""you missed school.

3493345,4,B001BGS16W,"I decided to rent this before buying because of the negative reviews from others. I have to say I agree with the negative music reviews. I absolutely LOVED The Outsiders as a 13 year old girl. I know every word in the movie by heart. Now as a mom I am experiencing it again as my 13 year old son reads the book. I did not like the music that was added to this movie at all. I was getting very irritated with it a few different times. But I loved the added scenes. The beginning has Ponyboy getting jumped by the socs, the end has Soda running off, and there are many others. That part of the movie was great. The extra stuff is nice too, like a reunion with some of the cast, some more additional scenes, and the cast talking about making the movie. I have decided I will buy the movie because I want the extra scenes, but I am going to find the old VHS version as well, so I can see it without the music. A version with the scenes, but no music, would be great.

It's a few days later now and I have watched this version of the movie several more times. I have to say it is definitely worth buying. I am getting accustomed to the music after watching it about 4 times. Included on this edition is part of the cast watching it for the first time together. Patrick Swayze, C. Thomas Howell, Diane Lane, and Ralph Macchio. They also taped Matt Dillon and Rob Lowe watching it as well. They watch the whole movie and comment throughout it on things that were going on at that point or how things were done and how they felt. They really like the music as well so I was trying to give it a chance. But just listening to them as they watch it is really cool. The same goes for Francis Ford Coppola. He does the same thing, commments while watching the movie and it is really neat. I wanted to add this to my review so others can know that it's worth it. You may not like the music at first, but you will probably grow accustomed to it after a few viewings. And the extra stuff makes it very worth it as well.",1175385600,,2003,4.083756345177665

The special features I watched first for this movie.  I had intended to watch just that, as it was late and I had to get up early the next day for work.  But as I watched the behind-the-scenes and other features I got so excited at the extra footage added, that I threw the movie into the DVD player.  What followed was my witnessing a great travesty-a butchery- of a wonderful heartrending movie that I have loved and that has remained one of my top favorite movies of all time.

I was tortured and pained beyond words as I suffered through this ""new and improved"" soundtrack of The Outsiders. I writhed with disgust each time a dramatic scene was accompanied by the twilight zone/surfer music mix.  I kept thinking, ""Its going to get better"", but it never did.  I kept thinking, ""I know they're not going to play that in this scene"" but they did.  The flashback of the parents' death, the struggle at the water fountain, the church fire, the death of Dallas, wonderfully played by Matt Dillion...BUTCHERED.  I didn't even have the same feelings I've always had after watching this movie.  It wasn't touching because I was watching a beach movie comedy with a few Elvis songs thrown in for good measure.

I would have enjoyed the restored scenes to the movie if I wasn't so distracted by the music.  I probably would have even tolerated the last badly played out, over-the-top scene (SodaPop dashes from the house chased by his brothers...didn't Ponyboy do that already...and SodaPop reminds them what makes them special)if it wasn't for the strain of endurance I had to take on during the rest of the movie.

I would have never guessed that Francis Coppola was capable of something like this.  It pains me, but I have to give this ""Complete Novel"" Edition a 2.  If another Special Edition is put out with the original music score, then I can give it a 5.",1166486400,,1936,4.652941176470589

I then watched it numerous times when it came out on video.  I now teach The Outsiders in my 8th grade reading class.  We read the novel and watch the movie, so if you consider that I watch the movie six times a day, twice a year, multiplied by, well, a lot of years, I have seen the original version more than 200 times.

My biggest complaint about the movie (and my students' as well) has always been the gaps in the story from the scenes that were deleted.  Imagine my joy to find the newly restored edition!

Alas, I must agree with many of the other reviewers.  The new soundtrack completely RUINS the movie.  I literally get tense watching the new version.  The songs are so out of synch with the action of the movie, and the music distracts from the dialogue.  Having ""Blue Moon"" playing in the background while Johnny and Pony lament the fact that their lives seem hopeless is just pure torture.

3493363,4,B001BGS16W,"When the film version of The Outsiders was released, fans of the book were disappointed by how much had been cut from the original story. Still, it became a favorite among young people who could relate to the plight of the Greasers in their never-ending social war against the rich Socs. This version of the film includes much more of the film that was cut, helping to flesh out characters like Sodapop and Darry better and providing an insight into the genius of the book by S.E. Hinton.

This film is a curiosity not only for the great story but because it features so many actors who went on to make names for themselves whether it be 80s stars like Patrick Swayze and Emilio Estevez or those whose career took off later like Rob Lowe and Tom Cruise. It is nice to see them in their youth when their acting was not as polished by Hollywood.

This 2 disk DVD does not skimp on extra features. Besides the scenes that have been inserted in the film, there are other deleted scenes, a few from the original release that were replaced. There is a featurette about the making of the film which brings some of the old cast back together including C. Thomas Howell, Ralph Macchio, Patrick Swayze, and Diane Lane. There is also an interesting segment that shows audition footage of many of the cast captured by a very early tape recorder.

The one downfall of this version of the film is the music. Coppola wanted to make the film a little more realistic by inserting music the boys would have really listened to instead of an ominous movie score. However, the music alters the moods of some of the scenes, turning dramatics into comedy. The song choices were plain bad in some spots.

As greasers, they are put down by anyone who's not in the group, which is unfortunate, because each exhibits his own special ability to contribute something valuable to society. The sincere efforts of each greaser to belong, to function and to express love is remarkable. The Outsiders is a timeless film. A must-see.",1148083200,,631,4.745454545454545
3493365,4,B001BGS16W,"The Outsiders illustrates the classic class struggle between peers and the violence that is sometimes a result of this.

  The two main groups are the Greasers and the Socials (Socs). The Greasers are the kids with virtually no supervision who are growing up in poverty and bad family situations. Their rival group is the Socs: the rich kids from the ""right"" side of the tracks with the cars, the money, and the girls. The Socs aren't covered as well in this film, which I personally disliked because it made it easier to lay the blame on them.

  The film starts with a light-hearted look at the setting and the way things were in the 50s/early 60s. Soon though, things take a turn for the worst and two of the younger Greasers (Ponyboy and Johnny) who are the main characters run away to live on their own in an abandoned building. While living there they end up becoming heroes when they save some school kids from a burning building. In the process of this though, Johnny is fatally injured.

  The film then begins to focus on how society still views them as ""Greasers"" rather than heroes and how the kids don't really know how to deal with their feelings so they just lash out by fighting in the ""rumble"" and robbing a gas station. Towards the end of the film Johnny and Ponyboy have a moment of enlightenment when they realize that their violence is getting them nowhere and that it's wrong.

  This short film is like a small window into the complex lives of people involved in gangs and other violence in the world. While this lifestyle is very complex, it is highly simplified in this film, partially because of the time period and partially because S.E. Hinton did such a good job of personifying the archetypal ""bad guys"" behind the violence.",1145750400,,1754,4.586538461538462

A stab to Ponyboy's throat and a painful scar on Johnny's face increase the Greasers' hatred of the Socs, but no one is prepared for the wild ride that shows them a lot of things about themselves and their pals that they never knew.

3493369,2,B001BGS16W,"I'm in total agreement from the only other critical reviewer- the new music is a complete detraction and distraction from the new version.  I am, in a sense, watching an entirely different film. What was Coppola thinking?  Apparently, ""less is more"" is not in his vocabulary. The movie, The Outsiders, came out at a time when I had just read the book twice and was completely enamored with the whole story.  I was twelve at the time and I did enjoy the movie, even though it was missing alot from the book.  Later as an adult when I watched it I could appreciate that much more the cinematography (the golden hues offer so much beauty) and the magnificent score.  Now, with the latest edition, I was excited when my brother sent me the dvd as a gift and couldn't wait to watch it.  Coppola removed about 90% of the original score and replaced it with rockabilly 50s/60s music, playing it incessantly. Many of the original scenes, for example, were once absolutely free from music, where the viewer can enjoy the downtime and experience the actual surroundings.  I not only found the new music distracting when listening for the dialogue, but the entire mood of the movie changed. It no longer is this serene melancholy movie that has a timeless quality.

Can I quickly mention how infantile the songs are in regards to how they are placed in the movie?  Examples, when Ponyboy and Johnny are on the train there played a train song (I would have just preferred the sound of the train) or when Johnny was cutting Ponyboy's hair, how convenient- there plays a song about hair. There are other similar examples of how these songs were inserted into the scenes in such a literal and infantile manner.

There were a few paramount scenes that were left empty without music in this new version, where the original version used the original score.  Like the Dally scene 'let's do it for Johnny!' and the touching scene with Johnny confiding in Ponyboy about how he didn't want to die- both scenes were denied the original score (at least we weren't subjected to the rockabilly music in the background at those moments).

The music and mood is so radically different that I can not continue to revisit this new version.  If I want The Outsiders in my permanent collection then I will have to buy the original version- which is unfortunate as the added scenes show more of the close relationship between Ponyboy and Sodapop. Why couldn't Coppola add the new scenes and leave the existing ones alone?!  Don't fix what ain't broken, right?  But he fixed.... and he broke.",1142380800,,2558,4.678571428571429

However, I was extremely disappointed when I realized that, about 1/3 of the way through the movie, it was clear that the entire original score has been wiped out and replaced by mostly uptempo '50s/'60s rock n' roll tunes.  Now, let me point out that I love Elvis' music as well as some of the other stuff on there.  There's one problem, though - they don't come close to fitting with several of the scenes they're being played over.  It's very annoying when you're listening to some uptemp rock n' roll number while Johnny's trapped in the burning church or, when Pony Boy's being half-drowned by the Soc's!  What in the hell happened to the original score!?  There are so many parts in the original release where it played a key role in setting the mood, not only for particular scenes, but for the movie as a whole.

After reading the book in the 6th Grade, I watched the movie again and I was heavily disappointed. So much was left out in the movie, one of the things I remember hating about the movie was that we never saw all of the Greasers together.

In 'The Complete Novel' alot of my problems with the movie have been put to rest. Although we don't get to see the gang together alot, we do get to see it and explore their relationships. I enjoy how alot of the editing issues were taken care of, and things that didn't make alot of sense in the original release, now work alot better.

I think the only thing I would have done differently was to not make Ponyboy look like such a wimp, but I guess we can't have everything.

All in all this edition is a MUST see for anyone that is a fan of the movie, as well as the book. Also, check out the special features, they fix alot of the other little small things that could have been improved. Also hearing the cast read about their characters is also enjoyable.

On a side note, the only other bad thing...the music. They should have kept the original score. Luckily though we still have Stevie Wonder's heart warming ""Stay Gold"" which I think also made the movie.

Greasers and socs(socials)Greasers are poor and enjoy having rumbles,stealing and all of that other crap. Socials are the rich kids who enjoy crashing party's, getting drunk,and beating up greasers.

the jokester,Dallas Who's tough and hard,And Johnny the quiet one

The premise of the story was too contrived, to the point that it lost touch with reality, believeability, and most importantly, my ability to empathize with any of the characters.  The characters, who were supposed to be hardened youths from the wrong side of the tracks, cried every time they were confronted with even the most minor of difficulties in life.  The dialogue was simple, and at times plain stupid.  And there is nothing wrong with tenderness between brothers, but the scene with Soda and Ponyboy spooning in bed while talking softly to each other was creepy.

As the film went on it completely lost me.  Dal committing suicide in a blaze of glory because his friend Johnny died seemed just a bit over the top.  It seems to me that only an extremely emotionally disturbed person would resort to this, but nothing in the film even comes close to rationalizing why he would be such a nut case.

And the part at the end when Soda bolts from his house because his two brothers are having a spat was just laughable.  If every kid in the U.S. ran from their house every time there was an argument, there wouldn't be a screen door left in the entire country.  Give me a break.

About the only redeeming quality of the film is that it introduced me to an excellent poem by Robert Frost that I had never known about before.  Other than that this film was a waste of time.",1138492800,,1591,4.5174825174825175
3493379,5,B001BGS16W,"I saw the movie first before reading the book. I enjoyed it tremendously. The I read the book about a month later, and was surprised of how much was left out of the movie. Basically the movie skipped over Chapter 1 entirely and jumped from Dallas dying to Ponyboy reflecting on what had happened. Also I didn't know the benefits of the letterboxing format.

When it was on CBS the first time, they did insert the scenes in the courtroom plus the final conversation between Ponyboy, Sodapop and Darry. It seemed a little better.

When I finally heard that Francis Ford Coppola was going to revisit the film and release a new DVD I was extremely happy. When I purchased the DVD, it just blew me away.

It was really like watching a full completed film. The characters were more completely realized and all the deleted scenes filled the missing gaps from the original cut. The transfer was excellent and sound was rich and full. FINALLY, I got to see the film in the original widescreen presentation.

The extras on the film were fantastic as well. I've only listened to the audio commentary by the cast, but it was wonderfully done, blending Matt and Rob's solo commentary with the rest. I only wish Emilio and Tom were there. The retrospective was great and the auditions were a real eye opener: Anthony Michael Hall as Ponyboy?

My only small complaint is the change of music. I enjoyed the original Carmine Coppola score. It was powerful and emotional. But it's his sons' movie and he does have the final say.

Just a top notch recommendation all around. If you've think you've seen The Outsiders, buy this immediately. You won't be sorry.",1138492800,,1640,4.657439446366782

First off the video is very good considering this movie is over 20 yrs old. I didn't notice and artifacts or scrathes on the film, so i imagine they cleaned up the film quite well. The colors are nice especially during the sunset scene.

The audio is not bad either 5.1 Dolby sound clean and the dialouge is clear and sharp.

If you grew up like the chracters in this movie you'll enjoy it alot. The message of this movie is violence doesn't solve problems. But friendship is forever.",1138492800,,702,4.384615384615385

Great extras!!!!!!",1138320000,,290,4.333333333333333
3493382,5,B001BGS16W,"The Outsiders has been one of my favorite films since it first opened in the early 80's.  The main differences between this new version (which, really, is not new) are the reinstated scenes and the score of the film making it truer to the book.  If I had to choose which version I prefer, I think the new version would win - more for the addition of the cut scenes than for the music (although, the music in the new version is particular to the period and works well).  The Outsiders - The Complete Novel covers pretty much everything in S.E. Hinton's amazing novel - the additions, especially at the beginning of the film, make a big difference to the overall experience of it.  Other added scenes include some tender moments between the two brothers (Pony Boy and Soda Pop Curtis played by C. Thomas Howell and Rob Lowe) that Mr. Coppola cut because of how those situations might have been perceived at the time of the original release.  Rob Lowe really shines in this new version since he was central in a good portion of the reinstated material.  I own both versions of this and appreciate both for their own merits.  I think that the original score of the film (the orchestral score written by Mr. Coppola's father) gives that version a different feel altogether.  I like both, actually.  In a way, it's like they are two separate films.  The good thing about the new version is that is doesn't have the old version included but instead has some very good bonus material about the making of The Outsiders and some reunion footage that was filmed for the new version.

Visually, this film is exquisite - every frame is a beautiful portrait full of small details that complete a picture (like the scene of Dallas in the hospital declaring ""We'll do it for Johnny!""  We see Dallas's back to us but his necklace is hanging backwards down his back exactly how it really happens.  But, the most beautiful scenes are those of Pony Boy and Johnny in the sunset discussing Robert Frost (think Scarlet O'Hara in Gone With The Wind vowing never to be hungry again...as God as her witness...darnit!):

Nature's first green is gold
Her hardest hue to hold
Her early leaf's a flower
But only so an hour

Amazing for the time, this film proved that tenderness, love, loyalty, heroism, pain and loss existed (exists still) in young boys (contrary to societal views and gender programming norms).  How many directors would have tackled that in the early 80s?  Also worth noting is the limited to almost no use of profanity and no sex scenes (it's implied but not central). And it still works!  Who knew?  You don't see much of that in films today about teenaged boys.

One final note - I think the performances that Mr. Coppola extracted from these young men was astonishing.  I don't think I've ever seen any of them (except for Matt Dillon who seemed to be especially thoughtful about his future career choices - well maybe there were a couple of dogs along the way but definitely see The Saint of Ft. Washington) quite capture that magic in the same way in subsequent roles - Ralph Macchio and Matt Dillon in particular give very strong performances here.  If you only buy one DVD this year, this is the one.  It's a masterpiece.",1137628800,,3220,4.600700525394045

FFC replaced it with 60s Elvis and Surf music that barely even fits. The scene where Pony is talking to Cherry up on the hill with the ""future greasers"" playing in the background at sunset was so great with the original score. Now it is junk. What a joke of a movie. And there were reasons that FFC cut the orignial scenes - because they STUNK. The acting is laughable in the additional church and intro scenes. WHY WHY WHY!!!!?!?!?!

3493388,4,B001BGS16W,"I must agree with the music criticism- I remember this film for having a somewhat melodramatic feel - due to the cinematography but mostly thanks to the music.

Still ...instead of 'adjusting' his old films, how about trying to make a new one some time soon?",1135641600,,423,4.565789473684211

This has to be one of the worst movie-making decisions in history (right up there with Greedo shooting first). I will give one positive comment: the added scenes in beginning ARE really great and do add a lot to the movie. BUT, that doesn't offset the TERRIBLE replacement music they've added into the rest of the film. I agree with the person who said part of this movie's original charm was the melodramatic orchestra music. Now those tense moments of the film have lost their edge because of the music being changed, including the scene where Dally gets killed. Now those scenes are completely ruined in my book. I'm glad I still kept the first version of this film, because now I've resorted to watching the beginning of this one for the added scenes, and then I put the first version in for the rest of the movie. If I had the equipment to edit the two together, I would take the beginning of The Complete Novel and add it to the first version in order to keep the original musical score. That is truly the version of this film that should be on the shelf.

Shame on you, Francis Ford Coppola, for ruining a classic. What's next? Change the music in The Godfather? Two words: BAD IDEA.",1135641600,,1262,4.416309012875536
3493390,4,B001BGS16W,"I was 14 when a friend introduced me to S.E. Hinton's classic novel.  A year later, we were overjoyed to learn the book was being made into a film.  And we enjoyed the film, for the most part.  But, like so many others have said, we also knew that much of the book didn't make it to the screen.  So I am especially thrilled to find this new release with several restored scenes.  The major additions are at the beginning and end (a full 10 minutes of new material unfolds in the beginning, before the theatrical version even begins).  The other minor additions mostly occur during the middle section, while Ponyboy and Johnny are hiding out at the church.

The cast & director commentaries are quite enjoyable.  Coppola defends his decision to alter the film's soundtrack, but anyone who's seen the new version will likely disagree.  Replacing Carmine Coppola's orchestral score with surf music and about a half dozen Elvis songs (which are historically as well as dramatically out of place) is a jarring experience for anyone familiar with the film.

If you can overlook the soundtrack changes, this is certainly a marked improvement over the theatrical version of the film.  Now, if someone would just edit the original score back into this version, THE OUTSIDERS would be the film we've always wanted.",1135555200,,1304,4.802690582959642

Grease was light hearted and fluffy, about charectors who were all idiots who didn't feel real emotions.

  So in the 60's these tought guys named the greasers hate this prepy guys named the socs. And one night Johnny (greaser) kills a soc, and him and his friend Ponyboy (Seriesly thats his real name) have to leave town. I don't want to tell to much because I don't want to give it away.

  This movie has no fluff it deals with death, murder, and gang fights. Good acting helps this movie even more.

  I'm not trying to sound like a jerk or anything but Johnny and Ponyboy sound a little gay together. They talk about the clounds in a way that I kinda expect them to kiss. But when stuck in a house for a week and can't go outside for long at all because the whole town is looking for you to convict you of murder, I guess your going to creat a special bond with somone.

I am STUNNED at how many reviewers have said it is an improvement and how Coppola could have done this and thought it was good. The new music completely changes the tone of the entire film and removes all of the tension, drama and tragedy that are at the center of this movie. To replace the emotional soundtrack at key moments like the murder of the Soc, the rumble and Dally's run from the law with chipper surfer tunes is so confusing and jarring that I am no longer able to enjoy the film.

3493397,4,B001BGS16W,"S. E. Hinton's novel for teenagers about teenagers, ""The Outsiders,"" was made into a movie for teenagers and starring teenagers by no less a director than Francis Ford Coppola, whose father Carmine composed the score. It was edited to fit theatre screening times, yet upon release the film busted no blocks, although it has had a following. All the actors in it were unknown. They aren't anymore. C. Thomas Howell (in the leading role), Matt Dillon, Diane Lane, Ralph Macchio, Rob Lowe, Patrick Swayze, Emilio Estevez and Tom Cruise --- ""The Outsiders"" launched their careers. Were they grateful? All but Cruise showed up for the extras on the second disc of this new DVD edition.

For this ""Complete Novel"" version, Coppola replaced his father's score with period pop tunes (bad move) and restored key sequences. The story remains that of three brothers (Howell, Lowe, Swayze) and how they and their ""greaser"" friends deal with the taunts of roving rich kids. The new footage lengthens the film, raises the testosterone level, deepens the characters and explains their drive to survive on the wrong side of Tulsa's tracks. Before the inconclusive end, two will die but little will change in the others' lives.

Among the new sequences is one introducing each of the youths as he responds to an attack on Howell; an intimate one in which two brothers cuddle and converse in bed; and Lowe's outburst of feeling to his brothers, the actor's finest moment here. Although it is now a better movie, it is not yet a cohesive one. Only one of the tormentors seems human, and adults do not register at all. Some of the scenes are strong and maybe that's enough, but they do not hang together.

That being said, I would like to know why Coppola would go and change a movie of this caliber??? Well, then again I guess it's no different from how Lucas butchered Star Wars... I went and bought The Outsiders DVD for my 9 year old daughter, since I had just finished reading her the book and she had yet to see the movie. To my complete disgust, I'm hearing some Elvis Presley songs playing behind scenes in this movie that not only ruined the scene's emotion, but made NO sense!! It was painful to watch this. It was like some Tarantino wanna-be layed some campy Batman TV series music down as the soundtrack. Needless to say, I'm going out to buy the original version before it's not available anymore!!!

3493399,5,B001BGS16W,"I think the new music turns this into a MUCH better movie by all means!! I agree with Coppola when he says his dad's music made the movie a bit too over-dramatic. The new rock n' roll soundtrack goes better with the young gerasers background and sense of time. I was a huge fan of the book and movie when it came out in 1983...but I always cringed at the loud, dramatic orchestra playing when Dallas dies...or during the train ride to Windrixville... It works for the ""stay gold"" scene where Johnny & Pony are looking at the sunset...but that's it. I really think this is a better movie.

Also, those new opening scenes are much better as an intro. I was SO jazzed when I learned this was coming out. I watched the entire dvd plus bonus stuff in one night. Everyone still looks good..except poor C. Thomas Howell. Looks like life was rough to him after ""Soul Man"".",1132876800,,864,4.4

At the time some were upset; they thought that the beloved comic series should live on past him.

Charles Schulz knew better, though.  He was well aware of the human tendency to screw things up, to listen to marketing ""experts"" and other fools.  So he wisely ensured that his precious work would never be defiled or prostituted by the greedy or stupid.

The same precautions should have been taken in regards to the original version of The Outsiders.  The 1983 film is splendidly beautiful in so many ways, not the least of which is its moving soundtrack.  This is why my heart sank and my mind filled with despair when I flipped this ""improved"" version in the player.  All of that beautiful original score is gone!  Instead poorly chosen rock songs are thrown in, RUINING THE FILM!

How could Coppola be so bloody stupid?

Unless you've seen the original version you have no idea what I am talking about.  So I urge you to get an earlier copy of the DVD (or a VHS copy) to watch against this one.  You'll agree with me.

3493401,4,B001BGS16W,"In 8th grade we read the book in my english class. I was always able to connect with a story better when I read it, rather than if I watched it. This way I would paint the characters the way they appeared in my mind. Okay, so the book was the paperback version with the movie characters on the front, so I had a little help. But I have to say that when I watched the movie afterward, I was disappointed in what I saw. The acting was awful. Especially on the part of C. Thomas Howell. Before I saw the movie, I had no idea who C. Thomas Howell was. I only knew of the small picture of his face on the book. He being the main character in the story, I painted him as a totally different person. Howell is a goof. He has the warmth and charm of a cold toilet seat. Ralph Macchio wasn't as bad, but his acting skills were so much better in The Karate Kid, which came out only 1 year later. I liked him in KK pt. 1 (and only pt. 1) and nothing else. I think Matt Dillon gives the only true-to-the-book performance. Even though his character in the book is physically described different. Now for the new soundtrack... which is a soundtrack now and not a score. First of all, I have to say that I didn't like the original score to begin with. Maybe it was supposed to give the movie a 1960's feeling, but I found it too cheesy. The new soundtrack is okay at times, but uncalled for in many scenes. I don't think it was necessary to have it throughout the whole movie, American Graffitti-like. It was also WAY too loud. I could barely hear the dialogue. The extra footage was fun to see, and the second disk was entertaining as well. (Diane Lane is STILL GORGEOUS) I find myself not wanting to watch the new version as much as I did the old one though.

3493402,4,B001BGS16W,"It has become increasingly popular in recent years for directors to revisit their earlier films and make revisions.  This can range from the minor tinkering for the DVD editions of Star Trek: The Motion Picture or the first Superman movie, to radical rethinkings such as the directors edition of Dances With Wolves.  Francis Ford Coppola, following the latter course, has now released a dramatically different version of his 1983 film The Outsiders.

I missed the film in its original release, and first saw it on video.  I hadn't yet read the novel, so I had no preconceptions about the faithfullness of the adaptation.  Later, I  read the book and wondered why certain scenes were deleted, since the original cut of the film was rather short.  Yet even the theatrical version was a very moving experience.

In his commentery, Coppola states that he removed about 20 minutes of footage under pressure from studio execs who wanted to tighten the film.  He has gone back and restored pretty much every scene he shot.  Most of the restored footage, some of which has been seen on TV presentations, greatly adds to the characters and the story.  It should never have been excised.  This is especially true of about ten minutes of footage at the beginning of the film, which gives the background for the Curtis brothers.

Carmine Coppola, the director's father, wrote a symphonic score for the original version.  The score for the new version consists mostly of popular tunes, which serves to date the movie--which has timeless themes.  Worse, by deleting most of his father's score, Coppola dilutes the impact of numerous scenes, particularly the Socs' attempt to drown Ponyboy, the Sunrise scene, and the death of Dallas.  It would have been preferable if the director had made available an expanded version of the film with the original score.  Coppola, for a reason I can't fathom, has also changed the visuals for the opening credits--although thankfully he's kept Stay Gold as sung by Stevie Wonder.

The cast without exception give committed performances--there's not one moment of bad acting in the entire film.  The DVD transfer is immaculate, pefectly capturing Coppola's Gone With the Wind inspired cinematography.  The bonus features are outstanding, including audition and rehearsal tapes, a making of featurette, and author S. E. Hinton hosting a present-day tour of several of the locations used during filming.",1132012800,,2422,5.083544303797468

3493404,5,B001BGS16W,"Firstly, let me just state how glad I am to learn that ""The Outisders"" is finally available on a special edition dvd. I have been waiting forever for it, and the film is now on my Christmas list.

Secondly, let me state that this is one of the best films of the 1980s'. Most films from that decade haven't really aged well. But this one has not lost anything. Maybe it's because it's directed by cinematic legend Francis Ford Coppola, whose legacy is timeless, maybe it's because the novle it's based on his remained a classic, or maybe it's because most of the film's stars are still famous today (Tom Cruise, for example.

The film takes place in Tulsa in 1966. Back then, teenagers were devided into two groups. On one end of the spectrum, there's The Greasers. If you're a soc, you come from the poor side of town. You've been rejected by society. An outsider. On the other end, there's the Socs. If you're a soc, you're rich. You have money cars and women. You're both respected and feared. At a movie theater one night, Greasers Ponyboy (C. Thomas Howell) and Johnny (Ralph Maccio) hook up with Soc Cherry (Diane Lane). This doesn't sit well with Cherry's aggressive boyfriend Bob (Lief Garret, c'mon you remember him?)), who sees to it that these two will have nothing more to do with Cherry. When a walk in the park leaves Bob and a group of socs dead, Ponyboy and Johnny have to skip town to avoid the law. With the help of their resourceful friend Dallas (the always enjoyable Matt Dillon), Ponyboy and Johnny start a new life on the lamb, and the three become local heros when they resuce young children from a schoolfire, in which Johnny is seriously inujured. Old feuds are put to rest, and everything seems to be turning in the socs' direction. However, this is all shattered by two events: 1) the Socs are still looking for them and 2) Johnny is dying. This leads up to a startling, heartbreaking conclusion that will stay with you forever.

This film is excellent. The cast, for starters is superb, Ralph Maccio's performance as Johnny is definitley the most affecting, but the rest of the cast works wonders as well. Matt Dillon is convincing and often hilarious as Dallas, a troublemaker with a good heart. Diane Lane gives what is her best role to date as Cherry. And C. Thomas Howell is superb as ponyboy. Other notable faces, Patrick Swayze is tough yet sensitive as Ponyboy's brother Darrell, angry at the fact that he has to put his life on hold to raise Ponyboy. Rob Lowe is great as Sodapop, who I recall was Johnny's brother. Emilio Estevez's Two-Bit and Tom Cruise's Stev sort of float through the film, but they still turn in credible performances.

Some of the re-inserted deleted scenes are a nice addition, too.  But you know what?  All of that is overshadowed by the new soundtrack, which completely devistates the movie.

You want a lesson in how important music is to a movie, play this cut side-by-side with the original.

It is terrible what Coppola's done to the score.  He turned what used to be a dark, moody film into a light-hearted romp full of loud, boring surfer music and inappropriately-placed Elvis tunes.  The only reason I can see for doing this is if he wanted to create a ""kiddie cut"" that isn't scary for children.  The problem with that is that I saw ""The Outsiders"" as a child and it was powerful.  It was cool, sad, beautiful and really spoke to my teenie kid mind about classism and justice.

The extra features are also a 10/10 and I liked the 22 minutes of extra scenes , although only maybe 10 minutes of them added any value to the movie.  The audio is great (excluding the new soundtrack- see below). Great use of the surround channels.  The sweet transfer, bonus features and 22 minutes of addtional scenes added back into the film make this DVD a must have for fins of the Outsiders.

The bad: For some insane reason, Coppola decided to install a new soundtrack which included a bunch of obscure Elvis songs (didn't know it was the King until the credits) and a bunch of queer Surfer/guitar songs from the 60's.  WHAT THE?  Sometimes these songs work but for the most part they are way over the top and detract from what is happening on screen.

A quick example:

Original Release: Johnny and Pony Boy are in the park late at night.  You can here the crickets chirping, the wind blowing and off in the distance, you can barely hear the Soc's mustang.  The music is piano and strings, barely noticeable but sets the mood for what's to come.  Perfect.

New: Johnny and Pony Boy are in the park late at night. Surfer tune is playing loud and lively in the background.  Must be going to a party one must think.  you want to dance, Pony Boy?  Music KEEPS going through the whole next scene too (fight and stabbing of the Soc).  What is this Pulp Fiction?  The whole scene was ruined. RUINED. Thank God I have the original version on DVD.

3493414,4,B001BGS16W,"The DVD features are well worth seeing for fans of the film.  All the major cast members save Emilio Estevez and Tom Cruise, as well as Coppola and other members of the crew, participate in a short retrospective.

The cast contributes a breezy commentary; Rob Lowe in particular is endearingly self-depreciating.  There's also kind of a neat idea, having the actors read short passages from the novel about their characters.

Coppola's commentary, unfortunately, collapses under its own pretentious rationalization.  It spotlights the fact that this is the most ill-conceived ""special edition"" since Star Wars.

First of all, changing the music was a terrible idea.  Yeah, the original score was melodramatic, which is the reasoning given for changing it.  But you know what?  So is the story.  And more importantly, so are your emotions when you're a teenager.  By replacing it with rockabilly and surf tunes, Coppola drapes some of the most dramatic scenes in the film with a message that says:  ""Don't worry.  It's just a romp.""  Or worse, god help us, Tarantinoesque irony.

Coppola was right to cut the footage he did back in 1982.  Replacing it in the name of making the film more resemble ""the full novel"" does not convince.

Why?  Real simple.  A movie is not a novel.  In a novel, you can have epilogues and digressions from the main spine of the story.  In a movie, they just seem like anticlimaxes and padding.

Because of the age I was (11) when it first came out; The Outsiders is one of those movies that are just in my matrix.  I knew the novel like the back of my hand at the time too.  I'm glad to see Coppola's epic screen pictures in wide screen for the first time since its theatrical release (this is a movie that really suffers in pan-and-scan).  I'm giving it four stars for that, for the DVD features, and for old times sake.

But I know with the certainty that an 11-year-old knows, it was a better movie than this.",1128470400,,1940,4.665680473372781
3493415,2,B001BGS16W,"""The Outsiders: The Complete Novel"" is a travesty. The original 1983 cut was intended to be a modernization of those Technicolor-drenched, widescreen ""youth"" movies of the 1950s, complete with Matt Dillon channeling James Dean.

Now Coppola offers us a ""revisitation"" which does much to destroy the charm of the original. Gone is his father's lush, overripe but appropriate score. Instead, we get generic rockabilly, surf and Elvis tunes which don't even match the action. What's worse is that the new songs actually undercut the drama and make the out-of-time dialogue sound awkward and mawkish. The scenes between Cherry and Ponyboy are ruined, the rescue of the children from the burning church is ruined...etc., etc... And that's the strangest version of ""Blue Moon"" I've ever heard.

The additional footage? Well, now at least those of us who haven't read the book know why Ponyboy is walking around with that big red scab under his chin throughout the movie. But most of the ""restored"" scenes show the boys crying, hugging and spooning(!) I'd imagine back in 1983 the studio, upon viewing those scenes, asked Coppola: ""Don't you think the guys are a little...close?"" The added scenes are also redundant. Yes, we know the Socs hate the Greases. Yes, we know Dally died.

3493417,4,B001BGS16W,"S.E. Hinton's novel the Outsiders got me excited about reading and writing when I was in Jr. High almost twenty years ago.  I still love the book and I still love reading and writing.

  When I first saw the film as a thirteen year old, I was disappointed, having expected it to be as good as the book.  At the time, I found the most redeeming quality to be the packs of wild beautiful boys.  That point alone was enough to get and keep my interest despite it's flaws.  It is a point that is now lost on me, though, as I dive into my thirties and am no longer even remotely the characters' age.

  This new version has a lot of originally cut scenes--mostly character development and a new score.  In my opinion, the film is still a bit messy and could have been put together a lot better, but it is MUCH improved.

  A lot more is explained in this version.  I still think they should have done voice-over type things more often to explain Ponyboy's thoughts and to move the story along smoother, but it is still better.  There are a couple of weird scenes that should have been burned on the cutting room floor--like a scene where Ponyboy and Sodapop are in bed talking.  It is so uncomfortable that it is almost funny--I promise, you'll know just what I'm talking about when you see it.  They also bring in the ""Southern Gentleman"" thing that I was glad was left out of the first film, but it's not too bad.  There are several scenes like that.  Some of the scenes I'm really happy they added are a few at the beginning to introduce the characters and it ends and starts better now--just like the book.

  The thing I think makes it a genuinely better film is the music.  They took out the orchestrated stuff and used fifties and early sixties rock and roll.  The first time I watched this new version, the music was a little distracting because it gave a different mood to the movie than the other score.  The original music was so dramatic and it spelled out the feelings you should have--primal fear, victory, desperation  etc.  This music is so much lighter, it almost felt too light the first time around.  Some of it, I thought, was still a bit cheesy and overly obvious, but on the opposite end of the spectrum--for example, there is a haircutting song when they are getting their haircut and a train song when they are riding the train etc.  The new music, instead of giving such an emotional reaction, I feel gives an adrenaline reaction.  It seems like it portrays not so much what you should be feeling, but a sense of noise and chaos that I think is generally very effective.

  I found that the new music covers some of the film's ills--like the acting.  I used to think some of the acting was really bad, but in this new context, the acting seems to just flow better.  Maybe it just needed some musical congruence.

  I also liked the bonus features, although I haven't seen them all yet.  It was fun to see S.E. Hinton show us around her Tulsa and the places she used when she was writing the novel.  the interview was mostly about the film and I wished they talked more about the book, but seeing as how it was a bonus feature on the film-- not the book, I suppose it made sense.  It was also fun to see the actors interviewed twenty years later.  They are all such grown-ups it is shocking--fun shocking.

  Overall, I'd definitely recommend this movie over the original version, but I still think it remains a film for real S.E. Hinton fans.  I think the film is best watched after reading the book at least once (although, I had fun watching it with my ten year old son who hasn't read it yet, but loved the film).

  One thing about this film and the book that I feel, and I think others probably feel themselves, is a sense of ownership-- ""The Outsiders is mine, and I can share it with other people, but it belongs to me."" I think deep down in my subconscious, I've always thought of myself as the real author of The Outsiders.

  I feel greatful to S.E. Hinton for writing the book whenever I reread it or watch the film.  With the release of this new version, I feel that gratitude again.  So, Thanks, Copola for reworking this film and thanks Suzie for writing the book and sparking our imaginations and giving us something to sink our teeth into, think about and to completely enjoy.",1128038400,,4312,4.383059418457648
3493418,5,B001BGS16W,"""The Outsiders"" is one of my top 3 favorite movies of all-time.

5 stars for the film & extras, ZERO stars for the score change.

I was so excited for this set, but the new soundtrack absolutely DESTROYS any drama in the movie.  This is worth picking up for the amazing bonus features, but the new footage doesn't really add anything (its obvious why it was cut). and again, the new soundtrack (mostly surf music)is A-T-R-O-C-I-O-U-S!!! it guts the feel of the film in my opinion and is far too distracting.

3493419,4,B001BGS16W,"I was absolutely thrilled with this new edition of the movie.  I enjoyed watching the new scenes, and the features with the cast was fun to view.  However, the only thing I really didn't like was the new music score that was added.  I think it detracted from the movie in many ways.  I didn't like BLUE MOON playing when Johnny was talking to Ponyboy, for example, about having no place in the world and wanting to kill himself.  I think the music pulled us away from the emotion and power of the scene, almost making it comical when that was so poignent to the character and his actions later.  I found this to be true in other circumstances.  Even so, this movie is a classic and having the new scenes just adds to it forever being timeless.",1127952000,,743,4.340579710144928
3493420,5,B001BGS16W,"I should start off by sharing that The Outsiders has long been one of my favorite films ever.  The reasons are sentimental ones to be sure, but even in its original form it was a beautiful, almost romantic version of the Hinton book.  I also admit to being ever so slightly ticked upon hearing of this release, because I already own the original on DVD and I just *knew* they were going to release something like this one day.

Not that I hesitated to order this new version, mind you.  And now I'm going to urge you to do the same.  It's really that good - this minor masterpiece now seems somehow and finally ""complete"" and is so much more compelling than the film was when released.

Much has been said about the restored scenes, especially the entirely ""new"" first reel that really serves to communicate the depth of character and relationship that makes the book as popular and as enduring as it is.  Particularly notable is an extended, crushingly intimate scene between Pony Boy and his brother Soda Pop as they prepare to fall asleep in each others arms.  I'm sure this will cause homophobic titters in teenage viewers but it's entirely true to the novel and to these characters.  Indeed, the restoration of the Soda/Pony relationship is one of the most valuable elements of this ""complete"" version - if you had/have a brother, you'll find yourself wishing he could show the compassion and tenderness Lowe displayes toward Howe.

The most notable restoration is a gem of a scene between C. Thomas Howe and Ralph Macchio that pops up in the middle of the film.  The ""church sequence"" has always been my favorite portion of this film & seems almost to serve as the heart of the story, if you will.  This is an extended, ""actorly"" scene that really allows the pair to sink their teeth into the material.  Macchio has long been among my favorite actors and Johnny seems almost the role of his lifetime, and he really shines here - moving from fear to dispair to anger to apology ... it's quite an *amazing* scene, and I can't imagine why it was ever omitted from the original.  The downside is that this addition does serve to break up the dream-like, utterly poetic feel to this portion of the film [the now-deleted portion of this sequence is included on the second disc].

Finally, I must admit I was nervous about the new-version score after reading some of the comments here.  While there are times - particular moments & sequences - where I miss the epic, theatrical score of the original, I love what they've done here.  It just ""feels"" right and I think it also serves to lift a little ""heaviness"" from what is already an extremely heavy movie.  Two key examples might be found in the aforementioned ""church sequence"":

In a negative sense, we have the key scene of the entire film, one in which Pony and Johnny stand before a breath-taking sunset and the Robert Frost poem is introduced as the movie's central theme:  The ""old"" score featured here a sensitive and spare string ""comment"" on the conversation between the two [if you're at all aware of the strings behind the Dorothy/Professor Marvel scene in Oz you'll instantly know what I'm talking about];  now we get an instrumental of the contemporary-sounding ""Stay Gold"" theme that seems almost a loud and drunken intruder on this most tender and personal moment.  It very nearly destroyed the scene, at least for me.

In the altogether positive sense, the Church Sequence no longer suffers from the emotional weight the original score lent.  Instead, we get Elvis!  GLORIOUS early Elvis selections - tons of them - which are entirely appropriate for the time period and which at once seem to narrate and to participate in and amplify their scenes.  Throughout film, these song selections lend an objective and running conversation between director and viewer.  On the one hand I resent this, because it removes me slightly from the emotion and action on screen.  On the other hand, it feels correct for the age of the characters and it truly does lift the ""downer"" feel to the overall film.

It would have been nice to have the option of either score included on this disc - or to selectively pull in the orchestral score when appropriate - but that's a relatively minor complaint.  Personally, I prefer the new score, and I've the feeling it will grow on viewers after repeat viewings.

The only other quibble I have is that they've messed with the opening credits, which I always found quite incredible.  That *enormous* title doing that slow, uninterrupted crawl across a sunset-drenched screen - God, how I miss that!  Thankfully, though, they retained the warm and beautiful Stevie Wonder ""Stay Gold"" as the theme song.

Whether you buy it for yourself or for your kids, I'd highly recommend grabbing this disc [oh the extras are GREAT fun too!].  At forty, this film still has an effect on me I don't quite comprehend, and every kid I show it to ends up loving it, too.  Thank you, Coppola & Co.",1127865600,,4970,4.692041522491349

I was looking forward to seeing Sodapop's girlfriend, Sandy, added back in the movie, but those scenes were still unadded.  (If you go to the movie's official website, she discusses her small role being cut.)  Anyway, it was great seeing most of the cast now watching the film and reminiscing on their experiences.

The commentary with them is great, very entertaining. The extra 22 minutes put back into the movie are very good scenes, for the most part. The first 11 minutes of the movie are brand new, and sets up the relationship of the greasers much better. However, I have one problem with this new version, and it is a big one. The original orchestral score of the original has for the most part been replaced with 50's ""rock-n-roll"" songs. In some cases it works, but in others it doesn't. The biggest flaw is at the end when Matt Dillon's character is shot, there is now a ridiculous song being played instead of the powerful orchaestra crescendo in the original. It COMPLETELY removes all feeling and emotion from that scene, which in turn ruined the whole movie in my opinion.

Still, the basic problem with the film is that Coppola encouraged the cast to overact, especially Matt Dillon who is a fine actor but WAY over the top here. There was apparently a lot of rehearsal time, but it seems that the desire to make sure the EMOTION of the story really packed a punch clouded the director's judgment. He attempts to mitigate these moments by taking away his father's over-dramatic orchestral score, and it does help get rid of the ""sappy"" feelings certain scenes had. But I missed his father's music in the climax of the movie, where one of the characters is shot and killed. Carmine's music was deliriously over the top but appropriate at that point. Finally, let's face it, S. E. Hinton's book is nice and has its heart in the right place, but some of her dialogue isn't too good, and there are moments in the movie where the dialogue is similarly unbelievable or unnatural.

3493430,4,B001BGS16W,"I saw the Outsiders when I was in third grade, twice in one day in the theaters.  Over the years I've read the book at least 50 times and watched the VHS and then (minimal) DVD edition repeatedly.  I never grew tired of these characters and the story.  I read an interview with Ralph Macchio from 16 magazine when the movie was released that said he enjoyed the movie but it was filmed page by page from the book and would have been beetr if it had been ""adapted"", and I always agreed with this line of thinking.  Then last year I read a blurb in EW magazine that said Coppola was revisiting the Outsiders and putting the footage back, as well as replacing the score with more period 50's music.  I've watched the new Complete novel twice now and I agree that the cut of the film is FANTASTIC, much better flowing and more comprehensive than the original cut.  The music is great in some places but awkward in others.  I believed that a compromise of the score and original music could be reached, and with that line of thinking and my own home computer, I have recut the Outsiders using some of the original score (from the original DVD version) and some of the new.  Very simple to do actually as the film wasn't a restructuring or reediting.  I now have (what I consider to be) the best cut of the film.  The complete novel version with the old score put back where it belongs (who really feels it when you hear that new ridiculous Train song as Pony and Johnny jump the train to Windrixville?

I have both versions and the fanatic i am watched it back to back,and i have to tell you with the exception of the ""new and improved"" soundtrack the movie was more enjoyable. I liked the new beginning because you understand the brotherhood of the greasers being there for one of their own. Ienjoyed the extra scenes exploring the brothers relationship because that was how it was in the book. Yeah they are greasers,but while they took their circumstances and were proud you see that they really were not that different..not all anyway,but you understood why circumstance gave way to character. I can not tell you how important that you watch both versions and maybe go a step further and read the book..the movie is great with all the up an comers that appeared ,and the over all story is timeless just subsitute greaser for someone of a different ethinticity,religon or upbringing and you will have alot of the same complex issues. The soundtrack i must say is horrible in the new one and undermines all the dramatic moments in the movie with cheesy surfer movie music kinda down played the gravity of the situations these characters were in and i wish we could turn it off,i fortunatly have the 1st edition  so i will keep it for that reason as well as others..you will not be disappointed in this collectors set it is worth the extra purchase.",1127260800,,1571,4.551236749116608
3493435,5,B001BGS16W,"I've waited 22 years to see this vesion of 'The Outsiders'.  While I've always loved the film, I was quite aware that many scenes had been shot but not used in the film.  The new beginning introduces the characters and establishes their relationship with one another early on.  The new ending (sans the scene at the high school) actually did air on network television back in 1987 and that is the version I've watched ever since.  Having it all together on DVD is a true wonder.

The new soundtrack is going to take some getting used to it.  The Elvis songs work on every level, and the surfer music definitely works in certain scenes but not all of them.  The new music tends to make the film more comparable to the JD films of the 1950's and that is OK by me, because as far as I'm concerned this is the best of the genre.

Even more wonderful than the new footage in the film are the extras! The documentary, auditions, tour of Tulsa with S.E. Hinton, and ""additional scenes"" are true treasures to own.

A few things to take note of; There is approximately 2 minutes of footage of Johnny Cade and Ponyboy Curtis in the church that is no longer in the movie, but it does appear in the ""additional scenes"" section.  Also, I'm quite positive there was footage shot of Sodapop Curtis and his girlfriend Sandy as I remember seeing photos of him talking to her on a porch.  In the book she moves away and a letter Soda sent her returns unopened, which prompts his outburst at the dinner table near the end.  This probably should have been included in the ""additional scenes"" section too.  That storyline was later used in 'The Outsiders' TV series in 1990.

I have no intention of getting rid of my original version of THE OUTSIDERS, but I forsee that this new special edition will be the one I view most often! If you are a fan of this movie most definitely check it out.  Even if you are not won over by the new soundtrack and prefer the original, you have to admit it is a million times better than sitting around watching reality television!",1127260800,,2042,4.408
3493436,5,B001BGS16W,"As evidenced in the many versions of APOCALYPSE NOW and THE GODFATHER (I, II, and III), Francis Ford Coppola never stops fussing his movies. With the release of THE OUTSIDERS: THE COMPLETE NOVEL, Coppola has restored 22 minutes (mostly prologue) to his 1983 all-star teen hit. What do these extra minutes add to the film? Well, you could say the relationship of the three Curtis brothers (played by Swayze, Lowe, and Howell) is more sharply defined.  Interestingly, in the original version it was the middle child (Lowe's Sodapop Curtis) who got pushed to the margins. In the new version with restored footage, viewers get to see quite a bit of this Emmy award winning actor's earliest screen acting. One key scene, a bedtime conversation between Lowe and Howell was cut, according to Coppola's commentary, because it caused snickering in previews. While it is interesting to watch and although it certainly provided information helpful to understanding the brothers' relationship, even the original theatrical version of THE OUTSIDERS did not lack for scenes of fraternal tenderness. In fact, many of the cut scenes involved one or another of the male characters breaking down and having some kind of confessional confrontation with his feelings. These guys are supposed to be ""greasers"" after all. Having fewer emotional displays actually makes the few that remain all the more impactful.

The other big change was the virtual jettisoning of Coppola pere's lush, ""Hollywoody"" score, and its replacement with sizeable chunks of the early Elvis catalog. Coppola had originally conceived of THE OUTSIDERS as a sort of teen GONE WITH THE WIND, and it worked. The addition of long stretches of rockabilly music, to my ear, was distracting, and at times it even undermined key dialogue.

Do I prefer the original OUTSIDERS to THE COMPLETE NOVEL version? Yes. Do I regret buying THE COMPLETE NOVEL version? Absolutely not! There are so many delightful extras on this two-disk set. Almost all of the stars, most of whom have gone on to do great things, provided interview clips and/or commentary (notably missing were Emilio Estevez and Tom Cruz, who had smaller parts, anyway). One of my favorite extras was the tour of Tulsa given by S.E. Hinton, the author of the bestselling young adult novel the movie was based on. Also fun to watch were tapes from the original auditions, including footage of people who didn't make it into the movie. I've always been a fan of this movie and enjoyed learning from the creative participants themselves what went into the making of it. But if I want an emotional catharsis, it's the original theatrical version I'll pop into the DVD player. (By the way, I also prefer the three separate Godfather movies to the chronologically restored mini-series.)",1127260800,,2782,5.056644880174292
3493437,5,B001BGS16W,"I've loved this movie ever since it first came out and the book is my favorite. This new version of the film is so much better then the original. The new beginning and ending really make the movie more true to the book. I always felt it began to abrubtly and shortchanged the audience from getting introduced to the characters. It makes me upset that these scenes were deleted in the first place. They're so important to the story and the film's feel. The extras are excellent with the behind the scenes footage. I really like S.E. Hinton's tour of the original sites the movie was filmed at. It's good to see that the movie theater and the Curtis house still exist. I have to agree with the other reviewers though about the music. The ""beach"" movie type music is terrible and really does the film a complete injustice. It takes away from the feel of the movie. Alot of times I can't even hear what the actors are saying. I found it really distracting and irritating. All that aside, the movie is much better now and does feel more complete by far. Still worth owning in your DVD collection for all Outsiders fans.",1127260800,,1114,4.465686274509804
3493438,2,B001BGS16W,"Please don't let the 2 stars fool you - The Outsiders is both an excellent book and an excellent film.  The 2 stars is for this particular release of it.

The extra features and footage is great but the new soundtrack is terrible.  The entire score has been removed and replaced with Elvis songs and surfer music.  For the most part the Elvis tracks are ok, but the surfer music is absolutely jarring.  All of the most important dramatic scenes are underscored by...50s beach SURFER MUSIC.  It completely breaks the tone and any dramatic tension the film has.  Why Frances Ford Coppella thought this was better than the score is beyond me.  All it does is date the movie to a specific time period and make some very serious scenes, seem less serious.  The original score was timeless to go along with the timeless story that was being told.

So, for those of you who haven't seen this film yet or who don't care about special features - go for the original version of the film that was released on DVD a few years ago.  Yes, it's nice to have the extra 22 minutes of footage, but having the far superior score is much more important - it really does change the mood of the film entirely.

For those of you who are already big fans of the movie, get this for the special features alone.",1127260800,,1285,4.398305084745763

Well im watching it now, the Rumble scene is on, and what i see is an awesome scene with Surfing Music playing behind it.  Its horrendous.  Almost none of the original score is in this DVD.  Now it is awesome to see the extra footage and all, that part is great, but often times the new score practicly drowns out the Dialouge.  And what is with all of the Elvis?",1127174400,,487,4.25
3493440,3,B001BGS16W,This was one of my favorite movies - and Coppola changing his father's hauntingly beautiful soundtrack made me feel like I wasted my money.  Much preferred the original version.,1127174400,,177,5.103448275862069
3493441,5,B001BGS16W,"Coppola's original version was quite faithful to Hinton's book and this new edit is even more so. He has put back in 22 more minutes, most noticeably at the beginning and end of the movie. This new footage opens up the film more. We are introduced to the greasers much earlier on now that Coppola isn't reigned in by the dictates of test screenings. He is able to take the time to immerse the audience in this richly textured world shot in glorious widescreen by Stephen Burum who adopts a look that evokes another epic about troubled youth, Rebel Without A Cause (1955). The film is drenched in the golden hues of warm sunrises and sunsets like something right out of Gone with the Wind (1939).

Another significant change has Coppola replacing all of his father's beautiful, classical score in favour of period rock `n' roll music. In some cases, like the opening scene where Ponyboy is jumped by some Socs, it works and in others, like the whimsical surf music that plays over the scene where the Socs jump Johnny and Ponyboy, it feels awkward and out of place. Part of the film's original charm was its moments of `50s style melodrama, as epitomized by the film's orchestral soundtrack, and this diminished by the newly inserted period music that could be right out of an episode of Crime Story. Hinton's books are timeless with their universal themes and the original music reflected that. This new music, while accurate for its time period, contributes to a loss of some of the timeless feel.

On the first DVD is an audio commentary with director Francis Ford Coppola. He addresses the changes in the soundtrack by saying that after all these years he wanted to move away from a score that commented on what was happening to music that the characters would actually be listening to. The filmmaker delivers another top notch commentary full of smart observations and talks at length about why he prefers this cut.

There is an additional commentary featuring Diane Lane, Ralph Macchio, Patrick Swayze, C. Thomas Howell, Rob Lowe and Matt Dillon. Coppola invited all of them back to see this new cut of the film with Lowe and Dillon recorded separately. This is an entertaining track that fans will love. It's great to hear these actors talk about this movie after all these years.

The second disc kicks things off with a retrospective look at the movie, entitled, ""Stay Gold: A Look Back at The Outsiders."" In a nice touch, we see Lane, Macchio, Swayze and Howell being reunited with Coppola at his ranch where they recorded their commentary. This is an excellent look at the movie with all kinds of good, on set footage.

""S.E. Hinton on Location in Tulsa"" features the publicity-shy author revisiting the locations that Coppola used in the movie, including the drive-in which still exists. She talks about how Coppola worked closely with her on the set to make sure that the script was true to her book.

""The Casting of The Outsiders"" has casting director now producer Fred Roos take us through the casting process with audition footage from back in the day. People like Kate Capshaw and Adam Baldwin tried out for the film. Anthony Michael Hall even read for the role of Ponyboy!

A nice addition is ""Readings,"" with some of the cast who came back for these featurettes reading their character descriptions from Hinton's novel.

""NBC News Today Segment: The Outsiders Started by School Petition."" This is a new story done during the film's original release about how a class of California school kids wrote a letter to Coppola asking him to make Hinton's book into a movie.

There are six ""Additional Scenes"" with more footage from the opening that is even more faithful to the book but the rest of the scenes amount to extensions of existing ones.

Finally, there is a theatrical trailer.",1127174400,,3800,4.761398176291793

Wow. This was so freakin' awesome you guys. There is 22 extra minutes added to the movie and 10 additional deleted scenes as special features. For the people who were disappointed in the movie because it lacked scenes from the book you have got to buy this edition. All of the scenes are added to the movie like I previously said.

3493450,5,B001BGS16W,"""The Outsiders"", released in 1983, is a great film for all teenagers and adults to enjoy.  It stars upcoming stars Patrick Swayze, Matt Dillon, C. Thomas Howell, Tom Cruise, Emilio Estevez, and others.  This touching film tackles a variety of issues dealing with 1960's teen life.  It explores a group of friends called ""the greasers"" who search for belonging.  Many in their community misunderstand them, calling themselves delinquents.  Meanwhile, their rival group called the ""socialists"" try to erase their existance.  Instead, one of them is killed by one of the ""greasers"" in self-defense.  This begins a life journey not just between two boys but within the entire group.  They find their true sense of brotherhood and inner wellness.

Five-time Oscar winning director and writer Francis Ford Coppola (""The Godfather"" series) gives great homage to S.E. Hilton's book version of the same name.  Though some important details are changed or eliminated from the book version, this film keeps the momentum.  This portrays many truths of those times.  The brutal fights and actions in this film express the harshness of life as an outsider of those times.  Behind the ""greasers'"", misbehaving, it maintains their trueness as good people inside.  Within this journey, the emotional aspect lingers within the storyline.  Few other teenage films have such a strong impact as ""The Outsiders"" (""Stand By Me"" [1985], ""Mean Girls"" [2004]).

Some of the camera and visual effects add to the 1960's theme.  Various scenes digitally add the brighter colors that made this film appear as an actual 1960's classic melodrama.  One scene in particular vaguely resembles Scarlett O'Hara's ""I will never go hungry again"" scene in ""Gone With the Wind"".  These add a unique addition to this film.  Some may say that this explores a deeper sense of the characters' inner emotions and thoughts.  Regardless, this undoubtedly gives audiences unique surprises.  This effect is also seen on ""Far From Heaven"", released in 2002.

The performers express the emotional aspect to this film beautifully.  Through frustration, fear, irateness, sadness, and loss, they maintain their posture through their individual characters.  Particular intense scenes stretch their abilities as actors wonderfully, namely the fight and the murder.  Performances from Matt Dillon and Patrick Swayze stand out.  The combination of young talents is a rare and amazing find.  Such acting quality proves their worth as upcoming stars.

Those looking for a quality teen film should watch ""The Outsiders"".  This is sure to please many audiences as it has since its release.",1112313600,,2626,5.303398058252427

Francis Ford Coppola's big-screen adaptation of the S.E. Hinton novel had a lot to live up to upon it's release,and it tries. Unfortunately,all too hard. Coppola's heavy-handed direction and choice of GONE-WITH-THE-WIND cinematography serve only to highlight what a simple story this is. In the end,you are left with cliches delivered by charactatures against breathtaking sunsets and little else. In all fairness,it is by no means the worst we would see as the decade unfolded. In fact it deserves a fairly high ranking in the canon of eighties teen films on the strength of it's cast alone. Virtually everyone here would get their fifteen minutes on hollywood's A-List,and it's a gas to watch them cutting their collective teeth here as relative unknowns.

The movie follows the book pretty well but some parts were left out.
This book shows how lucky some people are compaired to others and makes a great point. It is like a less dramatic version of the movie ""Elephant"" which shows what people are going through. I am going to head down to my towns public library to borrow it and watch it again becuase it is one of the movies that you can just watch over and over again and still love it becuase it makes a great point and was directed really well.

3493458,5,B001BGS16W,"When I was in high school, I had the pleasure of reading a fantastic novel named, ""The Outsiders."" The author, Susan Eloise Hinton, only 15 years old, wrote her rendition of the conflicts between high society and the lower class citizen. Her novel was so well written that you couldn't stop reading it. Recently, I discovered the movie version of the novel and just had to view it.  Francis Ford Coppola, who's known for directing the films, ""Apocalypse Now"" and the first two ""Godfather's"" directed the film version of, ""The Outsiders.""  Although no awards were won for the movie, the cast was full of the top stars that we see today, which includes, C. Thomas Howell, Matt Dillon, Ralph Macchio, Patrick Swayze, Rob Lowe, Emilio Estves, Tom Cruise and Diane Lane. With a cast this good how could you go wrong?
  The story takes place in the early 1960's in Tulsa, Oklahoma where we see the classic rivalry between the rich, whom are call, ""socs"" (short for socials) and lower class citizen who were called ""greasers"" building tension toward each other until the final climax of the big rumble. The main themes of the story, are the struggles between two conflicting groups trying to bridge the gap between rich and poorer, honor among the lawless and treacherousness of male-female interaction through the narration of the main character ""Ponyboy"".
  Although I felt the movie was incredible I believe the music soundtrack needed a little help. This action pact drama is rated PG for violence but, I believe that any age group, accompanied by an adult, would love to see and understand how society sometime manipulates individual outcomes. When you get right down to it, the movie, with its great story line and cast, causes you to laugh, cry and get wrapped up in all the conflicting moments. Any movie that can take you from the couch and place you and the middle of the drama deserves a high rating.

3493459,3,B001BGS16W,"As with the book, the movie follows the expoits of fourteen year old Ponyboy Curtis, orphaned and living with his two older brothers on the wrong side of the tracks, in a town firmly divided down class lines. For our heros of the hood, the ""greasers"", life is no picnic, what with dead parents, absent parents and abusive parents to contend with, not to mention the hatred of the upper class. All this is made clear in the first few pages of the book, as Ponyboy wanders down the street thinking to himself (very convient for the reader that he does).
However the movies biggest problem is that there is no clear introduction, instead the assumption is made that everyone veiwing the movie has already read the book. The  characters are abruptly set down in front of us and start to go about what appears to be an average evening, while the veiwer is left to figure out who these kids are, why they are alone in the world, and why there is the big rivalry with the ""soc's"". Although by half way through the movie all has become clear, it does have you wondering what on earths going on for a while. However the strengths of the screenplay is that it is tight and simple, moving from one action scene to the next, and gets across well the tension building within Ponyboy, and between the rival groups. The acters are good, some of the dialogue they have to work with seems stiff and unconvincing, and they handle it well. Matt Dillon is most impressive as the tough and doomed Dally. While most scenes were realistic and showed the feeling of brotherhood between the greasers and their exlusion from the mainstream, some were overly sentimental. At other points it's the music thats off the mark, the reunion scene between the Curtis brothers could have been genuinly touching, instead it's notable for the cheesy music. The most moving scene is near the end with Dally fleeing for his life, camera work and music is spot on, evoking the charecters feelings of desperation perfectly. In conclusion, an enjoyable and sometimes thought provoking movie about the love between brothers and friends, and the sensless violence between gangs where no one can ever really be a winner.
Books generally do not adapt flawlessly to the screen, and this is no exception. Despite it's faults still well worth seeing, but read the book first!",1080259200,,2326,4.687041564792176

3493464,5,B001BGS16W,"This review is going to compare the book to the movie
The Outsiders, the book and the movie are about gangs and clichs. In The Outsiders your either a Soc or a Greaser. A Soc is a rich kid, Socs have fancy cars and nice homes. While Greasers have live in poor environments, beat up cars and don't make much money. The story about The Outsiders is mainly about Ponyboy and the previous events before a great big rumble that takes place between the Socs and the Greasers. The book and the movie both have the same plot, but some of the events are left out or have been changed.
Some points in the movie were shot very accurate to the book. Like the Robert Sheldon murder (or you could call it when they whacked off poor Bob) That part was almost exactly like I imagined it in the book. The actor that played Dally performed him very well. Dally was the same cocky, tough, young, handsome and reckless greaser that was described in the book. When Dally was running across the lot away from the police, I thought that Coppola did that part beautifully. Again it was as though I was reading the book. Same exact pictures, it was so close to what I imagined it was scary.
There are some things in the movie that I thought were different in the book. Like they left out Ponyboy being jumped in the beginning, the court hearing, Ponyboy and Johnny jumping off the train, they changed the part where Randy and Ponyboy talk and they also left out the teacher giving Ponyboy the school report. There was one more thing that really bothered me, all of the Greasers and Soc's looked like they were in their mid/ late twenties. I mean the book described everyone as high school aged kids and early twenties.
I thought that movie and the book were both well done, and of course the book is better than the movie. The movie could be edited so that it is more like the book, only by adding in parts. I would also change some of the actors so they don't look like old people I mean god. It would be better if they were young kids, and looked like young reckless kids. Other than that the movie was a good version of the story.",1070150400,,2108,4.312342569269521
3493465,5,B001BGS16W,"I haven't seen much of this movie, so I can't really say anything much about it, so just check ot out for yourself. I highly recemened that you should get The Outsiders though.",1069200000,,176,4.363636363636363
3493466,5,B001BGS16W,"What can I say about this movie?  For starters, it was sad.  Extremely.  I've seen it three times since renting it three days ago, and I haven't made it through the last scene without bawling yet.  Normally I don't like sad movies, but this one had a catch-it was powerful.  Pony and his friends, to me, aren't greasers.  They're simply wonderful, wonderful down-on-their-luck boys who haven't been given a chance to show how wonderful they are.  In fact, I don't think any of them, especially Johnny, even realize how wonderful they are.  If you don't like this movie, then you don't know a masterpiece when you see one.  I can't believe five stars is as high as you can go.  This movie deserves WAY, WAY, WAY more!
Another thing I liked about it?  It followed the book.  Pony didn't get jumped by the Socs in the beginning, and Soda didn't run out while Pony and Darry were fighting in the end, but other than that, it was no different from the book.  All the lines were almost word for word.
It couldn't have had a better cast.  Matt Dillon played Dally to perfection, Ralph Macchio was exactly how I pictured Johnny, Emilio Estevez had Two-Bit nailed down, Patrick Swayze was an awesome Darry, Rob Lowe was wonderful as Sodapop, Tom Cruise was great as Steve, and C. Thomas Howell-well, let's just say no one else could've pulled off Ponyboy.  Even the Socs had it down pat.  Matt, Ralph, Emilio, Patrick, Rob, Tom, Diane, C. Thomas, and everyone else, if you ever read this-THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS MOVIE!  NO ONE ELSE COULD'VE DONE IT LIKE Y'ALL.  YOU REALLY TOUCHED MY HEART!  AND S.E. HINTON, THANK YOU FOR CREATING THIS! :)
There's really no word in the English language that can describe how wonderful this movie-or book-is.  Even seeing it for the first time twenty years after it was released, all the magic was there.  STAY GOLD!",1067904000,,1842,4.588957055214724

I do reccommend first reading the novel, but if that's not your thing, than the movie is a great adaption.
As for the cast?  Can't go wrong with the line up.

3493472,4,B001BGS16W,"The Outsiders is a small slice of life as seen by Ponyboy Curtis (C. Thomas Howell), a ""greaser"" from the South Side of a Midwest town.  Raised by his older brother, Darrel (Patrick Swayze), since the death of their parents, Ponyboy lives in constant fear of being sent to a boys' home by the authorities.
The South Side of town is inhabited by the blue-collar/upper-lower class who constantly seem to be at odds with the inhabitants of the of North Side of town...inhabited by middle and upper class families.  Kids from the North Side are as accepting of their designation as ""socs"" as the South siders are of being ""greasers"".  These designations are made so often throughout the movie that it seems odd.  The ""lines"" between the classes of this Midwestern town are a reality in any real-world town.  The only difference is that we generally choose to observe those lines covertly.  It is not comfortable to consistently and openly acknowledge that we are from one side of the tracks or another, as the characters in this film do.
An overt, and somewhat uncomfortable, attempt to cross class boundaries comes when Ponyboy and Johnny (Ralph Machio) befriend two North Side girls at the drive-in.  The tragic result of that encounter is to provoke a late-night assault from five socs.  During the lop-sided scuffle, Johnny draws a knife and kills one boy.  Perhaps this encounter underscores the difficulty of less advantaged youth in escaping from the circumstances into which they're born.  There are forces, other than their immediate surroundings, that work against this story's greasers.
Despite the harsh attitudes and exteriors of the gang of greasers, Ponyboy seems just as naive and innocent as a typical fourteen-year-old boy.  But, at times, he demonstrates that perhaps he has a deeper understanding of himself and others than any other character.  Ponyboy is the most accepting character in  the film.  He sticks up for seemingly outcast greasers like Dallas (Matt Dillon) as well as some of the socs that he meets.  Ponyboy is most profound when he asks soc Cherry, ""Can you see the sunset from the North Side?....You can see it from the South side just fine, too.""
Many of the characters receive little or no development.  This fact works in favor of the movie, though, as the characters are not necessarily meant to be seen with a lot of depth.  Most are meant to be seen as society views them...primarily as socs and greasers, good and bad, privelaged and disadvantaged.  The viewer has to make character judgements based on little or no personal knowledge, rather by using characteristics that society commonly uses to judge character; dress, occupation, speech, material possesions, and neighborhood.",1056931200,,2720,5.006666666666667

3493478,4,B001BGS16W,"This little film of Francis Ford Coppola's creative hands helped launch the careers of practically everyone in it. As if anyone could have imagined the impact that these actors were going to have on the film industry, men such as Rob Lowe, Emilio Estevez, Matt Dillon. And there was some guy who called himself Tom Cruise in it too.(Who in the hell is he?!)
Based on the novel by S.E Hinton of the same title, it tells the story of three young boys by the names of Dally, Johnny and Ponyboy, and the nightmarish events of a hellish night. It all begins innocently enough with three friends going to a movie, Dally tries to impress a girl who happens to be a Soc (ie. rich girl) who in turn rejects his advances. She, and her own female friend in turn strike up a friendship with Ponyboy and Johnny after they stop Dally from harrassing her further, much to the anger and annoyance of her rich boyfriend.
After Ponyboy gets into trouble for coming home too late from the movie, he and Johnny sit and wait in the park. But therein more trouble awaits them, the boyfriends of the two girls that Pony and Johnny befriended have tracked them, now they are looking to teach them a lesson about greasers not being fit to speak to Soc girls. During a scuffle Johnny accidentally kills the ringleader of the Soc boys, in desperation he and Pony flee from town, with the help of Dally.
This was a story about trying to fit in, Pony is a smart and sensitive boy, who really doesn't deserve to be labelled as a no-good 'greaser'. But he is called that because his family don't have money, or prospects as far as society is concerned. It is also a story about the strength of friendship, and about brotherhood.
If you're looking just to see Rob Lowe or Tom Cruise, you will be disappointed, because they are not in this film that much. For those of you familiar with the novel, it will help you understand the book better, thought you may think the ending as rather abrupt (which it is).
The lack of special features is not really surprising, after all, this is known as Coppola's 'sleeper' film. But this is a good movie, and you should buy this DVD for that reason.",1049673600,,2154,4.441919191919192

3493480,2,B001BGS16W,"I have now read the short novel and seen the movie of S.E. Hinton's ""The Outsiders"" and admittedly, I'm not impressed. The story is dreadfully pretentious. It's the kind of thing that thinks it has a lot of subtext, but it just doesn't. The film tries to make up for that by putting overbearing, ""powerful"" music a the moments that should have been ""powerful"" on their own (like the climactic scene involving *spoiler warning* Dallas's nervous breakdown). The performances in this movie too leave a lot to be desired (especially Tom Cruise's brief moments as Steve). The future stars all seem to think that they're in the middle of a stage play, and act in that way. And frankly, this whole movie just isn't as inspirational as it thinks it is.
This DVD is a double-sided disc, with full frame (1.33:1) on one side and widescreen (2.35:1) on the other. The picture looks nice and glossy. There are no special features other than a pretty bad theatrical trailer (which just lists off the cast members and which role they played).

Interesting it is, too, how many now-famous actors were in this movie 'way back' in the 80's.  Even so, a majority of them are very bad in this movie (take the infamous lead in the ""Karate Kid"").

After saving kids at the chruch when it was on fire, Johnny and Dallas are driven to the hospital with Ponyboy reuniting with his brothers Darrel and Sodapop[played by Rob Lowe] And then comes the rumble... and Johnny and Dallas death, Johnny[before he dies] tells Pony to ""stay gold"" Dillon's famous ""you think my old man gives a hack if i'm dead or drunk"" makes this movie famous.",1025049600,,1101,4.709844559585492
3493493,4,B001BGS16W,"Overall, this movie is very good. The acting is supreme (I don't think it could get any better), and the movie is portrayed well. You're probably thinking, why 4 stars then? Well, I think that, in comparison to the book, the movie is not as good. It really leaves out some important things, and I think Francis Ford Coppola shouldn't have tried to make this an arts film, he should've just tried to make it real. But the movie, NOT in comparison to the book, is still positively excellent. I've seen it, like, 20 times, and I think that it's really too bad that C. Thomas Howell didn't go on to be as famous as Tom Cruise, because Howell had a big role and Cruise had a little one. But I think Howell and Matt Dillon's acting is the best in the movie (both soo cute, too! :) I think the only possible way this movie could've been better is if they had made it just 10 minutes longer with Curtis brothers scenes, but they didn't because Matt Dillon was becoming popular at the time. Don't get me wrong, I love Matt Dillon. But I think the movie would've been better, more powerful, and more true to the book if they had just put more Curtis brothers scenes in there.",1024617600,,1165,4.3
3493494,3,B001BGS16W,"I was assigned the book recently in school, and I loved it. My teacher showed us this film. The film was decent, but it was a poor adaptation; the climax was changed, and the entire middle section of the book was practically removed. What's interesting to me is that the author S.E. Hinton had a small role in the film, as a nurse, and if I were her, I'd be mad that the ending was completely different. Read the book, then see this.

It is just the best movie I ever seen.  It is now in my list of favorites.  The best part is that it has all great actors that so fit the part.  There's C. Thomas Howell (Ponyboy Curtis), Ralph Macchio( Johnny Cade), Matt Dillion (Dallas Winston), Emilio Esteevez (Two-Bit Matthews), Tom Cruise (Steve Randell), Patrick Swayze (Darrel Curtis), and Rob Lowe(Sodapop Curtis).  Including Diane Lane as Cherry Valance.  Well the rest I can say is GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!",1022803200,,616,4.5963302752293576
3493497,3,B001BGS16W,"Basically a comparison. First of all, I loved the book. It truly touched me, and wasn't nearly as sad as the movie. If anything, read the book first. You won't understand the point of the movie, or any of the characters if you don't read The Outsiders. Our class recently finished reading the book by SE Hinton, and finished the movie just today. The movie really isn't close to the plot of the book. It was written a lot better than the movie was directed. I will, however, say that it was a good movie, but if you haven't yet read the book, it will be a complete blur to you, and you will not understand half of what is going on. The movie skips a huge part of the book, the first few chapters. The beginning scene shows Ponyboy Curtis (the main character) writing his school composition, which you would not know had you not read the book first. So, from the beginning, you are completely lost with that. The beginning chapters are skipped, where you hear about the characters and start into to rivalry between the Greasers and Socs. I am dissapointed at how much of the book was cut from the movie. Very important characters, like Sodapop Curtis, were left hanging in the movie, with no explanation, and a devistatingly short role. He really should have been portrayed more, as he was in the book. Also, after the battle between Pony and Johnny against the Socs, and far after their running away, the movie completely trashes the reason why Pony is writing his composition. The comcept of the book written as a school paper is left out of the movie, and the ending is so dissapointing, it ruins the entire movie. I might have possibly given the movie 5 stars, had there been a better ending. As in lots of books, the main character tells the story. The book is written in Ponyboy's view. You know his thoughts, and feel his struggle and pain. You can't even tell half of what is going on with Ponyboy in the movie. You don't know anything of his relationship with his brothers, Soda and Darry, or with the other Greasers. If I had seen the movie before reading the book, I probably would have hated it. Aside of the poorly written script and deduction of important scenes, I think the acting was done very well, and the actual movie itself was good. The action scenes were very realistic, and the pain through the hospital scenes were felt very strongly. I nearly cried during two scenes in the movie. Everything is so sudden, and it hits you hard if you understand it. The movie itself is very touching, and it does keep you at the edge of your seat. The drama draws you into the movie, as it did me. Plus, the actors are total babes! This all-star cast basically made their debut with this movie. What hits me the hardest is that Dally (my favorite character, played by Matt Dillon - so fine, so fi-i-ine!) dies, and that one scene was so hard for me to stand. I have a thing for tough guys. And hott guys! I don't understand how the Greasers are 20 times as good looking as the Socs, but it's all the more reason to love the movie! Matt Dillon, C. Thomas Howell, Ralph Macchio, Tom Cruise, Patrick Swayze, Rob Lowe, and many more of today's big stars are featured in this movie, and most with a relatively big role. After reading the book, and watching the movie, The Outsiders has moved up in my favorite lists, both ways. Dispite all of the rants i give the movie for forgetting the total concept of the book, it IS very good. Not the best, but it is a wonderful movie, and if it had more of what it SHOULD have had, it would definately be near the top of my favorites list. It has a wide range of emotions for everyone alike. Rumble scenes, emotional and painful scenes, eye catching scenes, some boring, some amazing scenes... I could go on about its good and bad points. Read the book, see the movie, and decide for yourself!",1022630400,,3837,4.413258110014104

3493499,4,B001BGS16W,"It is easy to pick on this film for its technical failings. Good films, however, are not merely about technical excellence. This is a thought-provoking drama following the misfortunes of a teenage hood growing up in Tulsa in the early 1960s. The movie evokes (both thematically and stylistically) the memory of Terence Malick's Badlands, with its themes of childhood innocence interrupted by the reality of inhumanity, violence and injustice. Visually, the film has several original and interesting touches, making it uniquely filmic in its vision. The visual-stylistic nods to Gone with the Wind are a little pretentious and overdone ('nod' is an understatement), though the story has much in common with Margaret Mitchell's novel, to which the film makes reference: it is the tale of warring sides, and the efforts to find hope and meaning in the midst of conflict and loss.
In general, characters and plot are nicely developed, though the character of Dally might have been sketched out in a little more detail; he appears grossly unsympathetic and unlikeable, whilst we get the feeling that we are supposed to identify with him somewhat. The young cast (chiefly made up of then unknowns who later went on to become successful actors, even stars) are mainly commendable: only occasionally do the two juvenile leads fail to convince, but even then it does not overly hamper their generally excellent performances. The musical score, by the director's daughter, Carmine Coppola, contains some effective moments, but equally a few puzzling moments, which really miss the mark
What makes the picture a success is the gripping tale that will  strike a chord with thoughtful viewers, a couple of touching performances, and a vital, highly visual storytelling style that overcomes the film's technical deficiencies.",1020556800,,1811,5.26643598615917

Along the way there is action, suspense, moving drama and a strong romantic undercurrent between Ponyboy and Cherry, a gorgeous young lady played by Diane Lane.

For about a year I searched for this movie, and when I finally got it,I watched it right away. What a dissapointment. The whole first chapter was cut out (most important: it explained each of the carictors, why Johny was so scared, how Pony was beat up and the rivaly between the groups), as for the tension between Ponyboy and his oldest brother Darry and the love with his other brother, Sodapop. Also, the parts with Sodapop and Sandy were cut out,the court scene, and the fact that Soda dropped out of school wasn't mentioned, as long as other stuff that were important to the plot and could have made the story better.  I was surpirised by the cast, though. Matt Dillon was the best, as Dally, the tough hood. Dally and Sodapop (Rob Lowe) were just as I pictured them while reading the book. They were great, but Rob Lowe wasn't shown enough. The others were also good.
The opening credits also dragged. Watching it at night, it nearly put me to sleep. And the scene with the ""Stay Gold"" poem seemed as though they tried too hard to make it seem touching, what with all that sob-sob music and all.
If this was any other movie I'd have given it two stars. If the parts with Pony's family would have been put in I would have given five stars, or maybe four, depending how it would have turned out. Anyway, stick with the book.",984009600,,1438,4.365671641791045

The movie definitely has many positive points, such as Ralph Macchio's performance as Johnny, and the violence and desperation of the water fountain scene.  I was pleased to see the efforts of authentication (filming on location, the actors playing Pony & Johnny were wearing the clothes described in the book, the Socs were driving a blue Mustang as S.E. Hinton wrote, etc.). However, I think there was a misguided effort to romanticize the characters and the story (the good-yet-slow Stevie Wonder song and the scrolling credits at the beginning, the music & lush background when Pony recites the 'Stay Gold' poem).  I think there could have been a way to reveal the character's warmth and vulnerability while keeping it tough and gritty at the same time.  Most of the book was filmed, but yet the crucial first chapter establishing the characters and their vicious greaser-Soc rivalry, and pieces of the last chapter (the courtroom and Ponyboy trying to reconnect with his brothers and his life) were edited out (due to time constraints??).  At only 91 minutes, I think those scenes could have stayed in, and would have made it a better movie.

3493525,4,B001BGS16W,"I first watched this when I was around 12 years old.  The definition of a ""great film"" for me then was one with lots of fights / rumbles / fistcuffs, which probably explains why I thought that, while ""The  Outsiders"" was okay, ""The Warriors"" (Michael Beck,etc.) and  ""The Wanderers"" (Ken Wahl, etc.) were better.
Then as the years  went by and I saw all of ""The Outsiders"" cast becoming more  famous (geez, practically everyone!) I thought to myself, well, maybe there  is something worthwile about this film which I just didn't quite get  then.
Time passed, and a couple of weeks ago I noticed that the film was  finally coming out on DVD (and at a bargain basement price at that!) and so  I decided to order it.  Needless to say, it was a truly worthwile  rediscovery for me.  The film's overall theme of transcending barrers  imposed by society (both social and psychological) came out clearly through  the commendable performances of everyone, but C. Thomas Howell / Pony Boy  in particular.
I never did quite get it back then - how come there  weren't too many fight scenes?  Why did they have to dampen an otherwise  euphoric sensation of victory on the part of the Greasers (after the  climactic fight scene) by killing off Matt Dillon?  Now I understand that  that was exactly the whole point - showing that there is a better way, and  that, for Pony Boy, ""staying gold"" would undeniably be the best  decision he would be making in his life. Excellent, excellent film !
WHY  ONLY 4 STARS?  Simple: the film/story/quality is great, but I really expect  more from a DVD, especially new releases.  What, no featurette? No  commentary?  They couldn't even get one interview out of the numerous stars  in the film in?  Come on! Trailers and interactive menus shouldn't even be  classified as ""special features"" nowadays.

Johnny shouldv'e been this  really shy looking kid with really light skin, I would say he shouldv'e had  light hair, but that wouldv'e totally defeyed the whole book. Another part  that they really messed up, was how Dally was practically crying when he  got shot. That was just...wrong! And how they ended it there, it shouldv'e  gone on. But don't get me wrong, its such a great movie, but its a better  book. I think they should make a better version, cause I can name ten  actors I think would be perfect in the parts.",955152000,,917,4.366863905325443

I really love  this film and i'm sure any one else who watches it will feel the same way.

According to Ponyboy, who is the main character, the socs are the rich kids, the ones  who can do anything they want and get away with it.  They have snobby  attitudes and do not think too highly of the greasers.  The greasers are  the tough kids.  The kids who are trying to make it on their own and do not  have the money to buy their way out of life's troubles.  The conflict sets  in when Ponyboy's best friend kills a soc in a gang-fight and they are left  to face the consequences.  As a result of the murder, Ponyboy ends up  talking with a soc and realizes that they are just like him.  They have  feelings and their own set of problems to deal with.

3493541,5,B001BGS16W,"I recomend this and the other books and movies by S.E.hinton to averyone. There is some content not apropriete for children under 10. I advise the child read the book before,it just gives the story more meaning. The book is  for teens in 9th and 10th grade, and I think the movie should be the same.  This movie opened a window to a world which exists but I had not relised  untill now. This movie taches a lesson so important that everyone should  experience it. This video is sad, but it is a heroic story of teens from  the rong side of the tracks trying to find their place in society. A 14 and  a 16 year old boy who don't fit in at home,in school,just with each other.  Each find that they have been hideing their true feelings just to keep  their rep. When they both decide to change it is to late for one, but the  other will never give up. A uniqe story which truley deserved the Margret A.

The Outsiders is fantastic film, it's one of those movies I can watch every few years easily. I was looking forward to the new extended cut, but here I am half way through the film enjoying the extra scenes but just dumbtounded with the heavy handed over use of songs (mostly Elvis) in many key parts. I'm looking through the extra features to turn this music off, but there is no option. Such a shame because then transfer looks amazing.

8283139,5,B001BGS16W,"The beautiful sentiment behind The Outsiders will move any audience. Your heart will break when you hear the character Johnny utter ""Stay gold, Ponyboy."" That line alone has stayed with me my entire life. The Outsiders will change your life forever in a way only a truly great film can.

Francis Ford Coppola directs yet another masterpiece of cinema with his 1983 coming of age classic film The Outsiders. I have loved this movie ever since I first saw it as a kid. It not only holds up, but I appreciate it more each time I watch it. It is a realistic testimony to childhood, poverty, gang life, friendship, and family. Coppola crafts each scene with a tender care and understanding for these characters. The result is every single scene is iconic. Coppola can claim he elevated the novel The Outsiders by S.E. Hinton to new heights as this is likely the greatest adaptation of a book ever.

The Outsiders is a landmark movie for its star cast, clever cinematography, apt framing, exhilarating soundtrack, gorgeous score, emotional story, and emotive acting. Every teenager needs to watch The Outsiders. I guarantee they will relate to someone in the movie.

Now, the director Coppola must be commended for his inventive camera work in The Outsiders. Whether someone is running across a field and the camera pans along with them or gentle still shot lingers on an emotional moment, Coppola always frames every shot to perfection. Practically every second of The Outsiders can be taken out of context as immortalized as one of the most iconic pictures in cinema history. The whole movie is gorgeous. I absolutely love the scene with the sunset shining on Ponyboy and Johnny's faces while they appreciate nature. Their silhouettes and monologues are burned lovingly into my memory. Some of Coppola's finest directing is woven into the thoughtful blanket of empathy that is The Outsiders. You must see this film!

The Outsiders features perhaps the most well cast collection of actors ever assembled. The entire ensemble delivers acts their hearts out. C. Thomas Howell gives the greatest performance of his life as Ponyboy Curtis. He is the movie character I relate to the most out of anyone. He feels so real. Howell acts rather resolute to hide his pain while revealing his emotions through his expressive eyes and face. I wish Howell's acting career was longer.

Likewise, Ralph Macchio lays down the most emotive performance from a child actor in memory as the lovable Johnny. Matt Dillon is perfect as the rough mug Dallas that wishes life were different as you start out hating him, then you feel sympathy for his character by the end. I remember Dillon most fondly for this film.

The Outsiders contains my favorite Patrick Swayze role ever as well. Swayze nails Ponyboy's stern oldest brother Darrel. He is tough, but clearly wishes the best for his youngest brother. Swayze is astoundingly cool and sympathetic here. Rob Lowe is so sweet as Ponyboy's middle brother Sodapop. He is as likable as I recall and gives a brilliant monologue at the end.

Additionally, The Outsiders boasts a fun performance from Emilio Estevez as Two-Bit Matthews. He is a blast to watch as Estevez eats up the scenery every time he is on screen. The Outsiders is also notable as one of Tom Cruise's first roles on film. He is already charismatic here. Cruise's future was already in motion as you are drawn to him when he is present. Diane Lane similarly engages the viewer deeply in one of her earliest roles too.

Musically, the score is one of cinema's most beautiful. Carmine Coppola composed the most gorgeous theme for The Outsiders. The rest of the soundtrack is a series of old rockabilly tunes and surf rock selections that dazzle and thrill you. There is always something nice to listen to while you watch The Outsiders.

In all, The Outsiders remains one of my favorite films. It is a must see movie for all teenagers and adults. Francis Ford Coppola bestowed us with another amazing adaptation of a novel like his Godfather Trilogy. I highly recommend The Outsiders. You will never forget it.",1526601600,,4092,4.859397417503587
