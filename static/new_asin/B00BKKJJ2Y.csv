8569985,4,B00BKKJJ2Y,"Beautiful scenery, and I liked the ""coaching"" guy who gave a description of the location.  It made me feel like I was running the trails on my treadmill (somewhat).  But I really hated the accompanying music track (a sort of explicit club music).  It's supposed to be a scenic trail run, not a dance in a bar.  Fortunately I found you can turn off the music off in the options.  I would suggest in the future they put several different types of music tracks to choose from in their options, including just nature sounds.",1421452800,6,520,4.48936170212766
