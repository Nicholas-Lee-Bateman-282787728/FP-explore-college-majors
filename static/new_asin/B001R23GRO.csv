8337189,1,B001R23GRO,"Normally, I don't write negative reviews or give low stars to products. If I don't like something, I just don't buy it. This time although, I felt obliged to ward Amazon clients about a product that is way beyond the lowest possible quality for any type of product sold here.

I just received this material and I am sincerely disgusted by it. First, this is not a video. It is a slide show of low resolution pictures, probably stolen from the Internet, including the cover picture of the disc itself. The author doesn't have the rights to use the Panagyurishte Treasure picture, for which I wonder how amazon.com enforces copyrights.

The music of the slideshow is an endlessly looping Greek military march. The pictures, besides being low quality, don't prove in any shape of form the claim of the material title: Ancient Greek Culture of Thracian tribes: there is nothing even remotely Greek in the slideshow, except for the military march.

Don't waste this criminal amount of money on the disc - if you are interested in the Thracian Civilization, buy the A&E Disk: Treasure! The Gold of the Black Sea Warriors.",1237593600,2,1115,4.796875
