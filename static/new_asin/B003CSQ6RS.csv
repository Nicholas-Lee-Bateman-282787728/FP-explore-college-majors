8453901,4,B003CSQ6RS,"This set contains two discs and is identical to the individuals releases by Xenon. Shaolin & Wu Tang is fullscreen with an English dub, while Shaolin & Wu Tang 2 is widescreen with subtitles. The picture is decent (although a little bit better in S&WT1 than 2) and the audio is clear for the most part, though the subtitles can be a bit hard to read in S&WT2.

Shaolin & Wu Tang is a classic directed by Gordon Liu, starring Liu and Adam Cheng.
