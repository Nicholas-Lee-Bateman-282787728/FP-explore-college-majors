2104442,3,B0002MHDSI,"I have all of them.  I buy Baby Enstein for most new families, but this (Noah) and Newton are just over Disneyed!  Noah even has promotions, ads and previews.  Might as well sign them up for a Disney credit card.  The show isn't that bad, but I cannot accept what they have done to a once beautiful child's learning tool.",1099180800,24,321,4.3
2104443,5,B0002MHDSI,I thought Baby Noah was great!  It had cute pictures of the animals and it summarized each one at the end.  OK so it had some promos but hey my kid skipped right over that and was following along to the cute skits the puppets put on.,1098921600,4,233,3.9361702127659575
2104444,4,B0002MHDSI,"My son owns all the Einstein DVD's and this is one of the top 5.  I like the format, which looks like a board book, lift and flap style.  It also introduces different animals besides the usual farm animals or ""everyday"" animals like cats and dogs.  I would give this 5 stars but Disney has tied in some shameless plugs at the end of the DVD for their Animal Kingdom in WDW.  Keep the ads to the bonus features or previews.",1098835200,34,422,4.172839506172839

2104465,4,B0002MHDSI,"My 18 month old is big into animals right now and this is one of her favorite Baby Einstein movies to watch. Se does all of the animal signs and I like that some of the footage is of real animals in their natural habitats. She gets very excited over this footage. I like the combination of pictures, descriptions, music and vocabulary used in this movie. Unlike other Baby Einstein videos I like that there is less of the puppet scenes, which my little one loses interest in very quickly.

I recommend this movie if your little one has just gotten interested in animals. It is like a trip to the zoo in your living room. This is one of my favorite Baby Einstein videos. My nephew responds similarly to my daughter.",1393545600,,714,4.409090909090909

2104467,5,B0002MHDSI,"For anyone with children 5 and under, Baby Einstein is a must.  It is very educational and only 20 minutes in length so not too much tv time yet you can control what they are watching and know they are learning something from it.",1387411200,,229,4.204545454545454

2104478,5,B0002MHDSI,"""Baby Noah"" features the best of Baby Einstein's signature filmmaking. My daughter loved the Animals of the Savannah section of the film, and my son loved the entire movie. It's a very soothing movie to watch before bedtime, especially if you like a little quiet time before starting the bedtime routine. I'd give this movie ten stars if it were possible.",1306713600,,355,4.836065573770492
2104479,5,B0002MHDSI,"Ok, first of all I do not think babies should be placed in front of the TV to be used as a babysitter. Therefore, when our 11 month old son watches this DVD we are right there with him. We use the Baby Noah DVD as another form of story time and he LOVES IT! We talk about all the animals, the sounds they make, and how they move. He loves when the music plays and the puppets come on too. I agree with other reviewers that the live animal footage is great and my son oos and points when the animals come on. Love this DVD and would recommended it to anyone who's child loves to read books. This interactive board book ads a whole new level to story time. This DVD was also a real life saver when my son was sick as he would sit in my lap and listen to my husband and I talk about the animals with him.",1304553600,,801,3.8902439024390243
2104480,5,B0002MHDSI,"This is a great movie for younger children.  I wouldn't say there is alot educational value to it, but the classical music being played is good for little ears.  I wish Baby Einstein would have more word visuals and voices speaking.  I think there are maybe 10 words spoken throughout the whole thing.  But my son really enjoys the hand puppets in the movie and I play the Jane's story time for him in the bonus features.",1295654400,2,421,4.428571428571429

2104482,4,B0002MHDSI,"Definately not done well enough to train a 3 month's brain in the path of Einstein brain development. It is done well enough though, with parental help, to begin that young of a baby to become introduced to the identification of many animals, which would not likely be encountered through the majority of babies' daily life situations.

There definately is not enough in the DVD to motivate a 3 month old, if left alone with the video playing in front of them to patently watch and focus on the video long enough to reap much of any brain developmental help.

Still, I will be first introducing this DVD when baby gets 3 months old, but not without first playing for her the ""Baby Noah Two by Two.... a musical introduction to animals around the globe; at least during some times throughout her days, beginning in the time period of her 3rd or 4th week after birth.  Then hopefully, once her reaches her 3 month, the association she will have with the background music of the Baby Noah series will be enough to motivate her to stretch further and begin to accept what this 3+ month version of the DVD is attempting to contribute to her association building skills learning.",1275868800,,1173,4.6028708133971294
2104483,3,B0002MHDSI,"For whatever reason my daughter just wasn't interested in this dvd....I think it might be because alot of the dvd shows the animals on flash cards and opening the flash cards on the screen gets sort of expected throughout the dvd. I would have to say that I was expecting a little more scenic of a dvd after watching the Baby NEPTUNE...highly reccomended by the way. I would say that is the #1 keeper of the collection...my daughter also likes my first signs and baby's favorite places, other than that the others ones she eventually became disinterested. Every child is different so your child may or may not love this dvd !",1267315200,,625,4.589285714285714
2104484,4,B0002MHDSI,"My grandsons have loved growing up with Baby Einstein.  They watch them over and over and over.  I have had to replace several of them from being loved so much.  They have learned their animals, colors, counting, etc.  Yes, there are times when they sat alone watching them but most of the time I am right there with the watching them, commenting on them, going over what they are learning.  We dance with the music.  Kids learn well with music which keeps their interest.  These are well worth whatever you have to pay for them.",1264636800,3,529,4.505263157894737

2104486,5,B0002MHDSI,"From day one, he just loved this dvd, and still asks for it EVERY DAY! He's totally into animals and loves every aspect of this dvd. It has a nice slow pace so your child won't get hyper if watching before bedtime. He started watching it when he was around 14 months, which was a great age. This dvd has even helped his language skills, as he points out all the animals he sees and is able to pronounce them very well. Would definitely recommend.",1249862400,,446,4.258823529411765
2104487,5,B0002MHDSI,"The following review by isabella (6 yrs):
""baby noah animal expedition takes babies and toddlers on a playful voyage acoss the glob. little 1s will meet animals, 2 by 2 from the rainforest and tropics, the outback, the polar region and more! this round the world journey features delightful puppet shows and real images of wild animals, children and toys set to the beautiiful music of beethoven, bizet and mozart.""

Parental comment:Well she loved this series of 'Einstein videos' when she was just a pup.  Now they have been passed down to her sister.  Sure the  'Einstein' series stands strong in the market.  and rightfully so.  but there are two that are sub-par: 'Shapes' & 'meet the orchestra'",1246752000,,700,4.889830508474576
2104488,5,B0002MHDSI,I teach special education preschool and the kids are fascinated by this video.  I bought a copy for my granddaughter (21 months) and she also loves it.  Sort of boring for adults but it does capture the toddlers and pre-k kiddos.,1240704000,,229,4.560975609756097
2104489,5,B0002MHDSI,"This is my favorite Baby Einstein DVD hands-down!  I love the variety of animals (not all of them are commonly known), environments, and the photography footage is outstanding!  My daughter laughs out loud at the humor expressed by the puppets.  Baby McDonald and Baby Noah are her favorites as an older baby.  I have a great love for animals and I am happy to see my daughter already showing the same.  I believe that exposing children to animals early on (in-person and through other venues) creates a life long appreciation and respect.  You will not be disappointed with this video.
Finally, I know that some people criticize videos like this for young children, but this is a great teaching tool when used in moderation.  Not to mention the break that it gives mom and dad when we need to get stuff done!",1235174400,,809,4.654929577464789
2104490,4,B0002MHDSI,"My one year old is REALLY active. This is the ONLY video that keeps her attention. She now growls however, when she sees tigers and elephants in it.",1233878400,,148,4.321428571428571
2104491,5,B0002MHDSI,"This is my favorite of the Baby Einsteins. They group animals (some familiar and some more unusual) by region. At 2, my daughter can correctly identify animals of the rainforest, savannah, polar regions, etc. Unfortunately, Disney's thirst for self-promotion results in ads for ""Little Einsteins"" AND a new theme park. If you are a vigilant parent and can work around these, the content is great.",1231977600,,396,5.107692307692307
2104492,3,B0002MHDSI,"I bought the Baby Einstein for my son who is 5 months old. This particular DVD says it is recommended for babies 9 months and above. However, my son has always seemed advanced so I thought I'd start him early. The DVD seems a little complicated for a baby of any age. I watched the entire thing with him. It has too many different types of scenarios going on. At one point it shows live, real people then it switches to puppets, then to cartoons, then back to animals. There is no consistency to the video or the dialogue. It seems to just be a bunch of thoughts put together in no particular order.
I believe it does have some great footage of animals on the video. However, the entire video itself does not seem to flow together. My son was very interested in the puppets and cartoon animation but not so much of the other stuff.  I have heard this from other people as well.
Also, for the quality and content of the video it seems overpriced. We received the other videos in the collection for Christmas so hopefully the rest of the collection will be better than this one was.",1230249600,,1080,4.346534653465347
2104493,5,B0002MHDSI,My Grandchildren love this DVD. There are so many animals other than the usual ones kids know. My daughter says it is one of the best Baby Einstein DVD's out there.,1225238400,,164,4.32258064516129
2104494,5,B0002MHDSI,My 19 month old daughter just got into this DVD.  I'd reccomend it if you're looking for a baby einstein DVD for a toddler.  It's very relaxing for her and me!,1221004800,,159,4.096774193548387

2104496,5,B0002MHDSI,"My daughter loves this video.  She is almost 2 and we've had the video for 2 months and she asks to watch it every day.  She very quickly learned the names of all the animals, and she giggles at the puppets' antics.  We also have Baby Neptune and Baby Galileo, and she loves those as well.  She likes having me sit next to her to watch it with her, because then she can ask me what the animals are and what are they doing.  It makes for relaxing downtime for both of us.",1204156800,3,470,4.010752688172043
2104497,4,B0002MHDSI,"If you're going to buy a children's video, by all means buy this video for your two year old and older child.  I highly recommend it compared to other kids' videos because it is engaging, fun, educational and not cartoon animated or fast-paced.  Baby Noah was one of my kids' favorites.

Having said that, I have a beef with the title ""Baby Einstein"" and marketing this to BABIES.  It seems to imply that watching these videos is good for babies, which they are NOT!  These videos may be great for older kids, but definitely NOT for babies' brains!

After some research I found out that: 1) brain wave activity in babies is slower when watching television than when sleeping. 2) for every hour of television a baby watches a day, their chances of acquiring an attention deficit disorder increases by 10%,  3) for every hour of television viewed daily at 4 yrs old, there is a significant odds increase for being a bully later on, and 4)consistent, heavy television viewing (more than 2 hrs daily) throughout early childhood can cause behavior, sleep and attention problems.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no television for children under 2, and no more than two hours of media (tv, videos, video games & computers) daily after age 2!  I think it's important for parents and caregivers to be aware of this so they can make better informed choices. I hope it encourages some people to limit television usage for babies and look for other outlets when possible.

For those looking to calm babies and build better brains, I recommend baby carriers because studies show that infants who are carried an extra 3 hours per day cry 40% less, and this effect is lasting over time!  Frequently held babies pick up verbal skills faster and develop better core muscle strength and balance.  Also, learning to communicate in sign language can reduce frustration and tantrums, accelerate language development and promote parent-child bonding in infants and toddlers.",1200355200,,1967,4.909365558912387
2104498,5,B0002MHDSI,"My son love this DVD, at last we have found something that he will watch instead of ""Baby McDonald"". He gets very excited when he hears the opening music and when the puppets come on.  The DVD takes you all over the world to discover the animals that live there.

If she is fussy this is the best distraction, in addition to the other Einstein DVD's. It calms her down. It's also a nice distraction when I'm trying to make dinner. The Baby Noah CD is a nice addition to the DVD. It's a pleasure to listen to when we are in the car; even I like it.",1176163200,,500,4.154639175257732

but beyond disney's fear of a subject controversial only to the uneducated, this video is a big hit with my kids.  the two main pluses are the diversity of animals it shows, and the monologue seems sufficiently subdued to allow me to do the naming and explaining to them (although i have a hard time explaining why an elephant is refereeing an ice block race between two penguins).",1172793600,,684,5.2

I was a little concerned at first about the ""Noah"" reference, but there is nothing in-your-face religious about this dvd; it simply has some pictures and toys with Noah's Ark every now and then. My daughter's animal vocabulary has definately improved due to watching this dvd. Her favorite parts are the silly puppets. Great music, and good mix of actual animal footage, babies/kids and toys.

The other ones I have seen are slow paced, with little thought towards helping infants make logical connections between words and concepts, the baby Noah is fantastic. It follows a predictable format that repeats names of animals with multiple images of those animals set to upbeat music, as well as shots of interesting toys and cute puppet shorts. The dvd is fast paced with lots of repition, and the overall tone is humorous and exciting. My 8 month old son is fascinated by this one, while he has never given any of the others more than a passing glance.",1154649600,4,821,4.591836734693878

That evening, she sat in her daddy's lap & when the music with the elephants began, she started drumming on her dad's thighs to the rhythm of the music. I bought it the next day. She has now learned all these great animal sounds (she even mimics a penguin!) & now at 18 months tries to say the names of many of them. It makes zoo trips & reading books about animals (esp. Goodnight Gorilla) even more fun. When our radio plays classical music, she recognizes pieces from this DVD. She asks for this & Baby Wordsworth after dinner, when she's winding down before bed.

We bought Baby Noah for her 1-year birthday and she LOVES it, and when we watch Beethoven and Mozart I almost feel like she's already outgrown them.  This one is definitely a little more advanced - for a slightly older child.  The music is great because it's stuff that an adult would like to listen to also - it doesn't get on my nerves like the other 2 DVD's did after a while.  For example, when they play the music for the Tropics, it's steel drum and so catchy.  My daughter is fascinated by this one, and gives me a great time out for a few minutes if I need to run do something (baby is safely in her play yard, of course!)

Maybe they just sit their kids down in front of the TV and don't bother to skip the preview.  I don't know, but this is a FABULOUS DVD for kids.  The music is by far the best of any Baby Einstein, and the animal footage is symply entrancing.  I lost my 1st copy, and paid for another one, because I love it so much.  Don't miss out.

2104517,4,B0002MHDSI,"If you have bought several of the ""Baby Einstein"" videos you should basically know what to expect:  puppets, live video of animals, classical music.

This particular video focuses on animals from the Savannah, Rainforest and Tropics, the Ocean, the Outback, and the Polar Regions.

Music comes from:

o  the traditional Noah's Ark song

o  Mozart -- Marriage of Figaro

o  ""My Bonnie Lies Over The Ocean""

o  Beethoven - Piano Sonata #15

o  Smetana - the Moldau

o  ""Sailing, Sailing""

o  Beethoven - Contradance #5

o  ""Row, Row, Row Your Boat""

o  Smetana - The Moldau, Hunt and Nymphs Roundelay

o  Bizet - Carmen, Suite 2

o  ""Barnacle Bill the Sailor""

o  Beethoven - Contradance #12

o  Strauss - Die Fiedermaus

o  Strauss - Pleasure Train Polka, Op. #281

o  Mendelssohn - Six Children's Pieces #72

o  Mozart - overture from Figaro

People have complained about the Little Einsteins `advertisement' at the beginning of the video, and while it delays the action, at least it is an ad for something that is provided free on the Disney channel.

Four Stars.  In my opinion, this is a video that may appeal less to babies than some other of the Baby Einstein videos.  It  may very likely draw rave reviews from Toddlers and even Preschoolers as it uses pictures of real animals.",1139529600,,1284,4.659090909090909

I enjoy watching it, too... the music is wonderful, the live animal footage is beautiful, and the puppet sequences are charming.  This is our favorite to put on at the end of a hectic day when we need something to slow down the pace.  Dim the lights, cuddle on the couch, put on Baby Noah, and we all instantly unwind.  In addition to being entertaining and soothing, my son has learned the names of all the animals (it's too funny to hear a toddler say ""flamingo""!) and it really seems to help foster his love of animals.

It has held his interest with color and sound. The music is light and lovely. The animals dance and move to upbeat songs, moms cuddle their babies to sweet, soft music. The video of the animals is not only beautiful, but entertaining. The puppet skits are very cute and funny! This video has a lot of vocabulary so as he gets older, learning the names of animals and habitat locations will be great. Selecting the Spanish setting is an additional vocabulary booster!

There are some previews attached as another review mentions. This is annoying, but you can easily scan forward on a dvd to the menu. We have 8 different dvds in the series. I'd recommend Neptune and the Farm. We're not as crazy about Wordsworth.(Too slow to keep my 20 months old attention.)",1131494400,5,444,4.493827160493828

There's lots of live action shots of the animals in between puppet shows and art work (she loves!!! the goofy elephant).  The segways between locations of the different animals is like a pop-up board book.  This holds my daughter's attention, and she actually seemed to learn words from it, as she started saying a few things that aren't everyday words for us (like hippo and tiger).",1130544000,2,470,4.7073170731707314

The animals are grouped up in segments based on where they live.  They are named verbally several times throughout the show.  This DVD is a great babysitter as well as teacher for your kids.  The only drawback is: it's nice that my child is getting introduced to these worldly animals, but, boy, why can't I find any teaching material for her that addresses good old deer, wolves, butterflies, caterpilars, wild gees, bees, foxes, owls and bunny rabits?  Shouldn't these animals be among the first to learn?  Instead, she's learning about wombats and caribous.  She hasn't seen a deer yet but she's learning about caribou.  She hasn't seen a fox yet and she's learning about wombats. Perhaps forest animals is an idea for Baby Einstein's next DVD.",1129161600,3,899,4.900662251655629

2104529,1,B0002MHDSI,"I don't really like this dvd. I don't care for the narrators voice (Julie Clark). Each time she says the word ""animal"" (which she says alot) it sounds like she is saying ""ain-i-mal""...it's just very annoying to me. This video shows animals from the savannah, rain forest, ocean, the outback, and polar regions. I borrowed this from the library and each segment begins with a drawing of a habitat and then it zooms in and shows a drawing of an animal half hidden. Then a door opens and you see the animal. They don't say what the animal is. Then they show live action of the animal. Then they show the door again and this is where I think they say the name of the animal. I remember a lot of zooming in and out for the doors and it is very, very slow. There are much better videos about animals. Brainy Baby Animals is better, Your Tiny Jungle Tot is better (see my reviews for those). On the main menu of the dvd it has ""about Baby Einstein"" and these moms are saying things like, ""invaluable"", ""don't know what we would have done without it"". etc. I don't get it. Baby Einstein is way too over-rated, in my opinion. I've seen about 16 of them and have only liked Baby Neptune, Baby Galileo, Baby Newton & Numbers Nursery. I have written reviews for these also as well as many other children's videos. Please read my reviews.",1116288000,9,1325,4.368421052631579

This one is a lot different because there is actually moving footage of the animals with great music.  He is too young to get into the animal naming parts, so he gets bored then, but whenever the puppets or the music come on he is mesmerized.  The DVD says its for older children, so maybe naming the animals won't be as boring for him in a few months. I like watching it with him.  I'd give the DVD 5 stars, but Disney is completely shameless in placing ads at the beginning and end of the DVD during the first play.

This one he loved from the first minute - maybe because some of the animals are familiar from prior videos?  He only says a few words so far but the morning after I bought this he tugged at my pants and said ""Baby Noah!"" until I relented and let him watch it again.  I am also very happy with the special features on this one - a storybook, discovery cards and ""guess the animal"", all in three languages.",1110499200,6,520,4.128712871287129
2104532,2,B0002MHDSI,"This is definitely NOT on par with BE's best works (IMO:  Baby Neptune & Baby Galileo).

*  Biggest gripe (and one that could affect future purchases):  Before the video even started, we received a marketing plug for new series/other videos.  After the video, we received ANOTHER marketing plub for Disney (as if we're not aware of their overwhelming existance).  One of the reasons I liked this series was the ABSENCE of overt marketting to my son.

*  Although I thought the concept was good (lift-the-flap book) and the animation was outstanding, I thought it could have been executed better.  In the Baby Doolitle videos, the puppet segments offered more substance than just showing pictures of the animals (sounds, footprints, humor, etc.).

*  I thought the narration could have used work, too.  The animals are verbally connected to the pictures before & after the ""lift-the-flap"" segments, but there's no narration during film footage to differentiate the animals.  I may as well turn on Animal Planet with the sound off.....

*  The puppetry seems to have taken a step (giant leap?) backward, and I'm not just referring to the complexity of the puppets (which has suffered recently in both Baby Noah and Baby DaVinci).  The Neptune/Galileo puppet segments were inspired.  They were written well and executed even better...and they usually had a little story in them.  The puppet segments on this video were limited to showing animals getting off of the boat.

*  Another thing about the puppet segments:  most of the other videos use those segments to provide little bits of humor.  There was none of that here - not even one adorable green dragon saying ""Blah!"".

They've done so much better in the past.  The two most recent videos (Baby Noah and Baby DaVinci) almost look like they were thrown together solely for the X-mas rush.  I can only hope that the new one (Baby Monet - out in March '05) lives up to the BE series usual high standard.",1106784000,22,1954,4.848484848484849

The video is cute, it includes animals grouped into regions, rainforest, savannah, etc.  It presents the animals in various forms, puppets, toys, real video and pictures.  My son who is 15 months loves to watch it.

I'm so sick of seeing Baby Einstein advertising itself everywhere - even within their own videos once you've already purchased them.  It's the same old stuff you see recycled in almost all of their baby videos - once you have one, you pretty much own the entire set.  I do think there is some value in infant videos and they can do more than just babysit your children.  But there doesn't seem to be a good bridge between Baby Einstein and videos like Blue's Clues or Sesame Street.  Juno Baby is a very nice and cute transition with some characters and pretty music and offers a bit more stimulation.  Another nice idea might be the Sesame Street for babies videos which are supposed to come out pretty soon.  The bottom line is that I think Baby Einstein sells babies a little short and underestimates what they're capable of hearing and understanding.",1102982400,14,962,4.623529411764705

They even have dolphins on the ark -which I think is ridiculous- being that Dolphins would not have been on the ark in the first place-since they live in the water!
