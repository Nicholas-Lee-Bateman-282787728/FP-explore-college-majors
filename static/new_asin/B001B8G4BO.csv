8282223,5,B001B8G4BO,"This film is short and somewhat low budget but masterfully done. Everything in this movie looks genuine, the toys are creepy and the parts are acted well. They could have made this movie into a feature length film, but it is very short. The length is almost a draw back but you will want to watch it several times.",1220918400,3,314,4.338983050847458
