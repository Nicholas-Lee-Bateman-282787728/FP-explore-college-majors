7909260,4,B00000I1T3,"Another good film in the Zatoichi series. Action, drama and humor all rolled into one movie. I particularly liked the scene where he defeats the 4 ronin samurai in the dojo with the shinai. I own 9 of these films and have enjoyed every one of them. Zatoichi is a great character and you will want to see all of his adventures.",1007856000,,326,4.274193548387097
