115538,5,0790744236,"This is a World War II era movie about the U.S. Defense of the Philippines at the beginning of World War II, and the men who created PT Boats.  It was directed by John Ford who had a close professional releationshp with John Wayne.  The movie is loosely based on real U. S. Navy servicemen.  If one knows the history of the Japanese invasion of the Philipines, one knows where this movie is headed.  I have no desire to spoil this viewing experience...

Robert Montgomery, John Wayne, and Danna Reed all appear at in this movie and are excellent.  Robert Montgomery served in the U.S, Navy in World War II.  This movie was not made until the end of World War II.  As an aside, Robert Montgomery is the father of Elizabeth Montgomery who, I think, was most famous as starring in ""Bewitched"".

Donna Reed plays a female leading role in this movie.  This is one of my personal favorite roles that she played, along with ""It's A Wonderful Life"".  Her character attends a dinner in the Philippines during war time as the only female guest.  She is treated in a courtly manner, which includes being entertained by ballads by enlisted men.  This scene puts me in mind of another John Ford / John Wayne movie Rio Grande wherein the lady entertained is Maureen O'Hara.

John Wayne plays a compassionate Naval Officer who recites a poem for fallen warriors at a funeral.  He developes a friendship with Donna Reed's character, who is a nurse.  The movie accurately portrays the vicissitudes of war.  There is gallantry, accompanied by suffering, personal loss, and the fate of loved ones that remains unknown.

As a work of art, I enjoy this movie very much and have viewed it more than once.  Thank You...",1488672000,,1696,4.6120401337792645
115539,2,0790744236,"They Were Expendable, 1945 film

""The cooperation of the US Navy, Army, Coast Guard and Office of Strategic Services made this production possible."" The movie begins in Manila Bay 1941. Patrol Torpedo boats show their maneuverability to the Admiral. Officers relax in a bar. Rusty wants to return to a destroyer. One officer is retiring after 30 years. A soldier brings news to the top officers. All Army and Navy personnel must report to their posts on this Sunday. There is an alarm for Cavite, the Navy base. Boats are sent into the Bay for protections. They fire at the attacking enemy airplanes. There is damage to the base. An enemy invasion force is approaching. The Navy will move to Bataan. Their job is to do as much damage to the enemy as possible. Can they sink the Jap cruiser shelling Bataan? The shore batteries attack and hit one boat. The second boat fires it torpedoes and hits the target, a converted cruiser.

The sailors return to base. Rusty recovers in the hospital from a wound. ""Blood poisoning"" was a serious disease before modern antibiotics. [The film moves slowly here, padding to fill up time.] The top general and key personnel will be evacuated to Mindanao and then flown to Australia. They visit a man in sick bay, he has letters to post. The key personnel arrive with the top general for transport to Mindanao. Do they have aviation gasoline and torpedoes? One boat is damaged by the coral and its engines must be repaired. They hear about the approaching Japanese cruiser and destroyers that can attack the supply ships. Can the torpedo boats stop them? They try, and succeed. Enemy seaplanes attack them. One boat is disabled, then hit by a bomb. The survivors hear of the fall of Bataan from a San Francisco radio station. A remaining PT boat is turned over to the Army. [The story moves slowly here.]

The remaining sailors see the retreating soldiers. Brickley and Ryan will be returned to America so their experiences can be used for new PT boats. The transport airplane is loaded with thirty men. Their job is to get ready to back to the islands. The others will take their chances. And so the story ends. [The viewers of this 1945 movie know what happened afterwards.] This movie was produced when the war was about over. It does not have the action and drama found in earlier movies, or others from this era. It runs on too long. There were better films made during this time, and afterwards. Modern technology has done away with torpedo boats for most countries. Small countries may still use this low-cost method of defense at sea. Fighter-bombers and rockets are now the weapons of choice to attack or defend naval ships.",1488672000,,2667,4.706638115631692

115557,4,0790744236,"This is a great movie.  WWII PT boats and their crews, making it possible for General MacArthur to escape the Philippines when the Japanese were closing in. It makes the loyalty of these sailors to one another and the dedicated, quiet patriotism that this inspiring generation left to us come fully to life for a little while. The love story is completely unnecessary, the real story is about these sailors and the hard and horrible sacrifices that they were called on to make.

A very special Christmas gift for my family.  I purchased 5 copies, and provided each of my sons (and sons-in -law) with the documents and links to further information.  One of my relatives was one of the 'expendables', a Navy guy who had to be left behind.  He never made it home after the Bataan March.  I wanted a way to let him live on for the next generations, and this wonderful film was exactly perfect for the purpose.  There is a marker for him in the US Pacific War cemetery in the Philippines, but his body was never found to be returned, so other than a photograph I had no other way to make him real.  I'm so glad this movie was available on DVD.

 I used the gift as a moment to act like an old lady, doing the ""...back in my day"".  Not really, but I did tell each of them that the next time they think about saying how 'stressed' their lives are with their commute and their jobs and their families, think about what these guys, younger than they, faced in their short lives.  And to be grateful for the bravery of the 'expendables' and so many others.",1483488000,5,1546,4.3671328671328675

I had the DVD version and the quality was good. I really can'y say if the BR is a quality improvement. There are no extra features at all which is a real lack considering all the talent involved in making this film.
Not much battle action but details the frustrations of the PT boat crew as they are frequently delegated to a ferry service.
Good cast. The romance is realistically treated with an evacuation which cuts off communication.

The dont-s win and PT Boats are used for messenger service after the attack on Pearl Harbor.  Even though proven effective in combat, the powers that be refused to use them in the manner in which they were created.  At one point, the small squadron is used to evacuate General MacArthur and his family.  As the war continues and the number of boats dwindle, the final indignity happens when they are forced to turn over the last PT Boat to the Army....for messenger duty, leaving the remaining crew to walk.

This movie is kind of, sort of, almost, historical.....in a manner of speaking.  John Wayne costars as Lieutenant Rusty, who longs to be on a destroyer instead of assigned to the failed experiment of PT Boats.  Robert Montgomery stars as Lieutenant Brickley, who firmly believes in PT Boats and fights to establish them as a useful part of the navy.  Donna Reed pops in for a few minutes to flirt with Waynes character.  As war movies go this is one of the better ones.",1468713600,,1084,4.598958333333333

Many of the John Ford ""regulars"" are in this film and do a great job but Montgomery's performance anchors the story in realism.  The story tells of, Bataan, Corregidor, the running out of supplies - food, medicine, ammunition, the Navy men being re-assigned to the Army, MacArthur's leaving, the nurses (the main nurse in the story is played by Donna Reed).",1464652800,4,579,4.76

Excellent cast based upon a true story that pits the beleaguered small PT boats against the Japanese navy in early WWII during the fall of the Philippine Islands.  The overall quality of the DVD does not hold up to a 5 star rating in this viewer's opinion.  While the images and sound are clear and crisp, there is too much ""waviness"" in the land and sea images - almost as you were on a boat watching the movie.

115671,5,0790744236,"The movie They Were Expendable (1945) is based on the book of the same title by W. L. White.  The movie essentially follows the same sequence of events as the book.  Though viewers do not have to read the book to understand the movie, viewers of the film will get more out of the movie if they read the book first.  The story centers on motor torpedo boat operations in the Philippines in late 1941 and early 1942 as the American forces retreated from the advancing Japanese army and navy.  Despite great odds, and, knowing that there was not much hope for the expendable army and navy, Americans fought on to the very end until overwhelmed by enemy forces.  Both Robert Montgomery and John Wayne make great performances as the chief naval officers involved in the story.  Titles on the soundtrack include Eternal Father, Strong to Save; Battle Hymn of the Republic; Battle Cry of Freedom; and Anchors Aweigh.  Though the name Douglas MacArthur is not mentioned in the film, his brief presence in the movie is significant.  One can easily detect the sense of patriotic resolve from the cast in this great World War II film.",1444521600,,1123,4.66497461928934

115693,3,0790744236,"""They Were Expendable"" deals with the struggles of the U.S. Navy in the Philippines early in WW. That territory was in the process of falling to Japan. The Navy men try to survive as many military units retreat to Australia. There is a depiction of General MacArthur and family being evacuated. But it also becomes obvious that not all will makes it and some will have to stand and fight the Japanese. There is a foretaste of the dreaded Bataan Death March. Through it all, there is a constant theme of duty and honor in the face of desperate odds.

The two main characters are 2 PT boat commanders-John Wayne and Robert Montgomery. The crews were the ""expendables"". RM flatly outshines Wayne here. That could very well be due to the fact that RM was just back from real life active duty naval service while the Duke never enlisted and fought the War from Hollywood. That fact that always bothered him. There is an achingly awkward attempt at a wartime romance twixt Wayne and Army nurse Donna Reed. The Duke should be so lucky. Perhaps Director John Ford felt there had to be a girl role, though there was no need for one. We never learn what happened to the brave young ladies.

The final call here is that ""They Were Expendable"" is not the best work of any of the characters, the Director or The U.S. Navy in combat movies.  TWE was released late in the WW2 effort. The raw and admirable patriotism exhibited here might have been more appropriate earlier in the War years. Released when it was, TWE simply has too much competition from other movies to stand out.",1432425600,,1565,4.542553191489362

115714,5,0790744236,"Made near the end of WWII in 1945, They were Expendable, tells the story of how PT boats came to be used by the United States Navy.  At the beginning of the film some Navy Brass, after watching a demonstration of the boats, decide to pass on them.  Then the war begins and it turns out that they become useful.  Robert Montgomery, a  real PT boat Captain during the War stars in the film along with John Wayne.  This is a different role for John Wayne, he does not save the day or win the war, but finds he must obey orders and by obeying orders he does something we don't expect.  The movie is based on true events and deals with the invasion of Bataan by the Japanese. PT boats were made of wood instead of steel.  This made them light and maneuverable.  The men who run the boats are brave men and willing to sacrifice their lives for their country.  The action sequences were directed by Montgomery, who used his personal experiences from the war to make them realistic and exciting.  I enjoyed the movie and recommend it to those who enjoy war  movies.",1416528000,6,1057,4.341836734693878

115716,5,0790744236,"At the time this film was made, General Douglas MacArthur, the Allied Commander in the Pacific, was one of the Great Heroes in America. We all knew who that unnamed Army figure aboard the PT boat being taken to a Philippine island for a flight to Australia was and added a special flavor to one of the best  war films to be made during the war and in its immediate aftermath. Of course, PT boats became quite  prominent during the Presidential campaign of 1960 and the few years afterward when it became known that the candidate and then President, John Kennedy, had commanded such a vessel and, to top it off, that the boat had been sunk.
Robert Montgomery, one of the superior acting stars of the thirties and forties, did a first class job as the commander of the PT unit at the core of the film. He is laid back and businesslike. John Wayne is held in rein, pretty much, by the man to whom he owed his rise from the ordinary ranks of Western heroes to a Star, John Ford. Given the period when the film was released, a time when hundreds of thousands of dead were being mourned and many without an arm or leg, many with ailments and injuries that would bother them the rest of their lives, were returning to civilian life to make the best of it, Ford knew enough to maintain a degree of sentimentality and touches from his traditional films, to keep out the harsher realities which many in the audience would have found difficult to bear. As one of the reviewers points out, he included in his cast some of his old reliables, like Ward Bond, who also  provided a familiarizing touch for the audience.
I'll let others speak to how the film strikes the younger set who have never known a United States involved in a declared war. Older segments of the audience probably carry into viewing it through a mental screen of sentimentality, loss, pride and other emotions which are evoked from having been a sentient if not actual participant in the greatest war in human history.",1416268800,3,1975,4.495821727019498

115742,5,0790744236,"During WW II Hollywood produced countless dozens of patriotic ""flag-wavers"" and quite naturally most all those films were very bad. Some however, like ""Destination Tokyo"", ""Flying Tigers"", ""Lifeboat"", ""Sahara"", ""Thirty seconds over Tokyo"", ""The fighting Sullivans"", ""God is my co-pilot"" and ""Purple Heart"" were quite good and some others, like ""Guadalcanal Diary"", ""So proudly we hail"" and ""Action in the North Atlantic"" were actually VERY good. Only one however can be considered as a masterpiece - and it is this one.

This film tells the story of American officers and sailors serving on board of PT (Patrol Torpedo) Boats based during the campaign of Philippines in 1941-42. Together with submarines those small crafts were the only support US Navy was able to provide in those times to the defenders of Philippines. Although small, the PT Boats fought bravely and from that time on the Japanese, who never managed to deploy similar units, called them ""Devil Boats"".

The two main characters, John Brickley (played by Robert Montgomery) and Rusty Ryan (played by John Wayne), are based on two real US Navy officers: John Duncan Bulkeley and Robert Kelly, who indeed served in this campaign (the former earning the Medal of Honour for his deeds). To enjoy this movie more I would advise you to NOT research on internet what happened to the real characters... Donna Reed plays the secondary character of a nurse who serves in the military hospital, first on Corregidor, then closer to front lines, on Bataan. John Wayne is of course nowadays considered the main star of the film, but Robert Montgomery (father of Elizabeth Montgomery of ""Bewitched"" fame), who actually really served in US Navy during WWII and took part in real fighting, is actually even BETTER than the ""Duke"".

This film shows the greatest military defeat United States ever suffered in their whole history - therefore, even if it is obviously very patriotic, it is also VERY TRAGIC. Instead of being jingoistic the tone is dark, very dark indeed, as Americans fight with grim determination but without much illusion about the ultimate issue... The butcher bill is very heavy and few people we see in the beginning will make it all the way to the final credits. A good decision of the director was to make some characters actually disappear in the fog of war and keep their fate a total mystery until the end - that actually reinforced the feeling of tragedy and made this film more realistic...

John Ford, himself a US Navy Reserve officer, enjoyed a lot filming the PT Boats who, with their speed and aggressive lines, were indeed the ""sexiest"" warships of their times and the camera loved them. There is a lot of action scenes in this film and they were all very well done - even if virtually every major exploit attributed to those PT Boats in Philippines Campaign is entirely fictitious...

Sorry for a mini SPOILER here but in fact NO heavy cruiser of ""Mogami"" class was ever even damaged by a PT Boat. If all the four ships of this class were indeed sunk by Americans during World War II, it was due to air attacks (""Suzuya"", at battle of Samar), collision followed by air attacks (""Mikuma"" at battle of Midway), cruisers fire, air attacks and collision (""Mogami"" at battle of Surigao Strait) and a succession of destroyer torpedo attack, air attacks, submarine torpedo attack and more air attacks (""Kumano"", the only Japanese ship Admiral Halsey admitted feeling sorry for, during Philippines Campaign in 1944).

A very skilful thing used by John Ford in this film was to make the enemy visible only through his war machines. We cannot see even one Japanese during this film, even if we see plenty of the planes and warships - and also see the incoming bombs, shells and lines of tracers rounds... This absence of human face of the enemy reinforces again the feeling of heavy threat...

A very impressive thing in this film is the iron discipline amongst US servicemen - even if nobody really enforces it! I believe that it is a mostly accurate description of feelings which prevailed amongst American soldiers and sailors in their fights for Luzon, Bataan, Corregidor and Mindanao, as it was clear that they have to ""keep the line straight"" if they want to even have a chance to survive - and also considering that the enemy was cruel, dangerous and unanimously hated... The final scenes show in a purely magnificent way this display of strong, self-imposed discipline and also of a great, impressive dignity, in a situation in which people could be very much excused if they rebelled or despaired...

Ever since I saw it in my childhood in communist Poland I always liked this film a lot and it always moved me a lot - and I was delighted to discover that even today, in Year of Grace 2014, it didn't age. NOT A BIT! A magnificent masterpiece to buy, watch and keep! Enjoy!",1399507200,3,4855,4.819927971188475

115765,5,0790744236,"This movie is on cable TV periodically, often near Memorial Day or Veteran's Day. It is one I tend to watch at least once a year.

The movie idolizes the sailors of the PT boats as was once the way such movies were done, and that seems a little dated in today's world.

There is also the way past reality sense of duty that is shown throughout the movie by all of the characters that probably did not accurately reflect how these guys were. But that too was just the way these movies were done back then.

In some respects it is a typical John Wayne loner tough guy movie. Nothing wrong with that. He was great in that kind of role.

In some respects it is a typical wartime propaganda film. Also just the way things were done back then.

You will note throughout the movie that the wounds are very clean and explosions don't seem to have anywhere near the effect that they do in real life. These kinds of movies always sanitized that side of war. Can't have teenagers who are going to war thinking they might actually get injured.

There is one scene near the end of the movie where troops are walking by, presumably retreating from a battle, and they are all wearing clean uniforms.

It is one I try not to miss when it is available on cable. I guess I am a little bit of a sucker for this kind of movie. Things were a lot simpler back then, at least in the movies.

Its more or less based on the exploits of a couple of real Naval officers in the PT boat squadrons, IIRC, from a book by the same name.

However, having watched it twice recently, I have changed my opinion of this great movie.  It is actually one of the best WWII movies I have ever seen and ranks amoung the classics.

This movie portays an aspect of navy life and naval warfair that few if any other WWII movies ever approach. It also provides the viewer with a valuable history lesson pertaining to a very challenging chapter of our involvement in the Pacific Theater. The PT boats themselves were amazining weapons platforms that required a special breed of sailor to make them perform.

I highly recommend ""They Were Expendable"" to any war / history buff.  This is a very true recreation of the way it was -- and will never be again.",1362268800,,871,4.551282051282051
115774,5,0790744236,"Famed director John Ford's 1945 classic war movie ""They Were Expendable"" captures, in an enduring way, the fortitude of the American soldiers, sailors, airmen and civilians trapped in the Philippines in 1942, under siege by the Japanese military and out of reach of reinforcements.  From their point of view, the victory over Japan in 1945 must have seemed impossibly far away, yet in Ford's retelling, all willingly gave what they could, and some gave all.

Ford's slow-building, at times almost contemplative movie centers around actors Robert Montgomery and John Wayne, who play stalwart PT boat squadron commander John Brickley and his emotional deputy Rusty Ryan.  They wait somewhat impatiently to show what their PT boats can do to support the fight against the Japanese, while juggling young crews, crusty Petty Officers, dwindling supplies and their unproven PT boats.  There are some terrific David vs. Goliath action sequences as they take on the Japanese Navy, and some poignant moments as the reality of the war sets in.  Donna Reed has an outstanding supporting role as an Army nurse who falls for Rusty, and whose fate is left unresolved at movie's end.

""They Were Expendible"" was shot in crisp black and white, with excellent location shooting and the real McCoy for props.  Highly recommended to those looking for a vision of the Second World War that isn't all flash and bang.",1361404800,4,1395,5.065502183406114

115781,3,0790744236,"This film is fairly close to the reality of early Pacific war in 1942. A single squadron of very early design PT boats was in the Pacific theatre and was about all the US had to oppose the Japanese.  They fought quite valiantly, evacuating McArthur and eventually, after losing most of the PTs, evacuating themselves or remaining and fighting on the ground.  Like McArthur, they would return only with much better boats and in vastly greater numbers.  The film is somewhat fictionalized but not far off the mark.

It is a film of defeat against overwhelming odds but courage nevertheless.  This is unusual in an American war film and, at times, quite moving.  John Wayne does his best to ruin the film, his usual over testosterone male role.  It was especially ironic that, on the entire set, including the director John Ford, Wayne was the only one who had not served in the U.S. military in the Second World War.  He was ridden endlessly on the set by the others for this fact, and, in a real irony, he is the gungho captain in the film.  Donna Reed is magnificent in a tender and quite beautiful role; her work in the dinner party scene is very moving.  She is so good she almost pulls some decent acting out of Wayne in that scene, which would be a first for him.

For anyone who loves boats, and PT boats in particular, this is a great film.  The roar of the Packard engines and the beauty of these incredible boats (they are all real Elco PTs in the film) is something to hear and see.",1358208000,,1491,4.4212454212454215

115785,4,0790744236,"A rousing John Wayne war movie that mixes some fact with a great deal of fiction.  PT Squadron #3 was stationed in the Phillipines at the time of the Japanese invasion.  Four of the boats were involved in 'rescuing' MacArthur and other officers from Corregidor and all of the PT boat men involved in the rescue received the silver star for heroism.  Yes, the mission entailed a great deal of danger but the PT boat crewmen were operating under orders so 'all round' silver stars would seem to be unwarranted.  That the crews may have felt this way as well is depicted in this film.  The crewmen, on hearing of their awards, regard the occasion with complete indifference.  A parallel to this 'silver star' situation is the attempt to kill Sadam Hussein by means of a B2 bomber that flew non-stop from the U.S.  There was no aerial opposition and the assassination attempt failed.  Nevertheless, all the members of the air crew were awarded the silver star.  Generally speaking, the army and air force have been liberal about the awarding of medals.  The Marine Corps, on the other hand, has been far more conservative.

The combat scenes in 'Expendable' are unrealistic and Hollywood-Jazzed up.  At the time--early 1942--U.S. propagandists claimed that the 6 boats of PT Squadron #3 had destroyed several Japanese ships.  I am unable to find any mention of confirmed 'kills' on Google.  It is, of course, possible that some small Japanese boats were destroyed and that these successes were conflated into large warships.  To be certain no Japanese 'flat top' [as claimed in the film] or Japanese cruisers [as shown in the film] were destroyed.  The PT boats did hit one Japanese light cruiser--The Kuma--in the bow but the torpedo was a dud.  Torpedo failure was a common U.S. naval problem at this time of the war and wasn't corrected [I think] until 1943 when an undetonated German torpedo was found on a U.S. beach.  The torpedo was carefully examined.  U.S. torpedo warheads were modified and U.S. torpedoes--mostly fired by submarines--started to have real success.

In any event, Torpedo Boat Squadron #3 didn't sink the Kuma nor did it sink any other significant Japanese warship.  The Kuma was actually sunk in January 1944 by a British submarine.  Apparently all the of torpedo boats of Squadron #3 were sunk by enemy fire or scuttled to prevent capture by the enemy.  These facts in no way impugns the courage of the PT boat crewmen.  It takes a lot of guts to attack a large ship in a plywood motorboat.",1343865600,2,2514,4.793023255813954
115786,5,0790744236,"I have loved this movie since I was a child.  It is not you regular war type movie, and definitely not like todays action movies.  Instead it explores the individuals and relationships thay have.  Here were U.S. armed forces people in the Phillipines, hopelessly outnumbered and no chance of relief.  And they knew that.  Instead of just giving up, they fought forces that were superior in numbers and equipment.  I think one of the best lines ever in a movie is at the end when John Wayne wants to stay in the Phillipines and let someone else take his place on the last plane out.  His commanding officer, aska him the simple question, ""Who are you working for?""  It brings out the fact that these people are serving all Americans, and their loyalty is to the country andnot just themselves.  I have yet to see any movie that shows the dedication and unselfishness of our military that even comes close to ""They Were Expendable.""  You should also note that Robert Montgomery (father of Elizabeth Montgomery of Bewitched) was a PT boat commaner, and John Ford was a Captain in the U.S. navy Reserve.

115789,3,0790744236,"While I can agree to a point with some of the glowing reviews written about They Were Expendable, the movie, while not being a detailed account of PT boats in the very early opening phases of WWII, is rife with some noticable flaws, while also cataloging the MacArthur escape from Corregidor. The first thing that struck me was the number of the PT boat skippered by Montgomery: PT 41, the very boat that was skippered by Lt. John J. Bulkley, the earliest ""hero"" of the PT Boats (who went on to command PT boats in the Mediterrainian against the Germans after a stint as an instructor at the PT Boat school at Annapolis, MD) and the Character played by Montgomery being name ""Brickley"". Bulkley was the man that took MacArthur off Corregidor and delivered him to Mindinao. Obviously, Ford and the Studio preferred to rename Bulkley to Brickley; perhaps Bulkley wanted nothing to do with his name being used.

The second point that sticks out like a sore thumb in this movie: PT Boats sailing with seeming umpunity headlong at ""Converted Japanese Cruisers"" (what the h*ll is a ""Converted"" Cruiser??? Converted from WHAT!??) and launching Mark XVI torpedos-----and scoring consistant hits!!!-----something real PT boats had a hard time doing. In fact, it was often the case that the torpedo tubes would catch fire after the ""fish"" had departed. Also, all too often PT Boats suffered ""hot runners"", a torpedo that wouldn't leave the tube and sat there steaming in the tube. By gosh, if fired torpedos didn't work flawlessly every time in this movie. It would have nade Submarine Skippers envious!

The third point that sticks out: I will not claim to be an ""expert"" on PT Boats, but I am familiar with WWII Naval weaponry, and the movie---due to constraints I'm sure----untilizes a number of Electric Boat Company 80-foot (Think of PT 109) PT Boats, of which I'm certain there were none commissioned in the Phillipines at the time. In fact, the real PT 41, was a smaller ""Higgins""-built PT boat of a much different design. One or two boats converted by the studio to resemble Higgins boats appear in the movie.

These are my nits to pick; as I said, this picture was not meant to be a factually, detailed review of neither the period or the equipment. In fact, I'm not sure how many Japanese warships the real PT Boats actually sunk---I know of a number that were damaged by PT Boats, but I can't think of a single warship sunk by PT Boats (maybe some I-class Japanese submarines)-----but in this movie they REALLY do some impressive shooting! While some particular details are dead-on for the period, the main reason to watch this movie is the acting. While it is a bit of a propaganda machine, it has some fine moments. It also has some purely outlandish periods in it as well, which add to the overall scope. It isn't meant to be taken as a verbatum account of PT Boats at the beginning of the war, but, rather, the frustration felt by one and all in this PT Squadron as they feel they are a vital part of the US war Machine only to find out they are not. They still live and die, but their true worth is not really reailzed.",1314316800,3,3125,4.616906474820144
115790,5,0790744236,"If you like WW 2 films made during WW 2, ""They Were Expendable"" is for you. It stars John Wayne, Robert Montgomery, and Donna Reed, was directed by John Ford, and tells the story of a PT boat squadron in the Philippines in 1941-2. The film is based on a 1942 book by war correspondent William White. It was made while the war was still going on, but released in December 1945.

John Wayne (1907-1979) plays a PT boat skipper. He was a major box office star at the time, having made his breakout with ""Stagecoach"" (1939) and then a series of war films in 1942 including ""Flying Tigers"", ""Pittsburgh"", and ""Reap the Wild Wind."" He followed them with ""The Fighting Seabees"" (1944) and ""Back to Bataan"" (1945) - all of which did well at the box office. He was nominated for Best Actor for ""Sands of Iwo Jima"" (1949) and eventually won for ""True Grit"" (1969).

Robert Montgomery (1904-81) plays the CO. He was a well known actor and was twice nominated for an Oscar  - ""Night Must Fall"" (1937) and ""Here Comes Mr. Jordan"" (1941). He was also a film director and worked on several films (""Your Witness"" in 1950, ""The Gallant Hours"" in 1960) and also wore the hat of a producer and for several years worked on TV with his series ""Robert Montgomery Presents"" during the golden era of TV. His daughter, Elizabeth, is best known as the witch Samantha from ""Bewitched"". Montgomery had served as a Lieutenant Commander in WW 2, won a Bronze Star, and actually worked on PT boats and was well respected by director John Ford who gave Montgomery top billing over Wayne, who did not serve in the war.

FWIW - This was the first post war film for Montgomery and for Ford.

All American Donna Reed (1921-86) offers the mandatory love interest as a nurse involved with Wayne.  Reed won an Oscar for her role in ""From Here to Eternity"" (1952) and a Golden Globe for her TV performances in ""The Donna Reed Show"". I remember her best as Jimmy Stewart's wife in ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (1946).

FWIW - The real life nurse upon whom Reed's character was based sued and MGM settled out of court for a nominal sum.

A good supporting cast includes Wayne/Ford regulars Ward Bond and Jack Pennick as well as Cameron Mitchell and Jack Holt.

Ward Bond (1903-60) was a football player at USC with his life time friend, John Wayne, and together they appeared in nearly a dozen films including ""They Were Expendable"" (1945), ""Fort Apache"" (1948), ""The Searchers"" (1956), ""Wings of Eagles"" (1957), and ""Rio Bravo"" (1959). Without Wayne, Bond was also a staple in Ford's stock company and appeared in ""Young Mr. Lincoln"" (1939), ""Drums Along the Mohawk (1939)"", ""My Darling Clementine"" (1946), and ""The Grapes of Wrath (1940) among the 25 films they made together. He's probably best remembered for his role as Major Seth Adams on the TV series ""Wagon Train"" (1957 - 1961), based on the 1950 film ""Wagon Master"" in which he appeared. Bond was in more Top 100 AFI films (7) than any other actor, and appeared in 11 films that were nominated as Best Picture.

Jack Pennick (1895-1964) made more films with John Ford than any other actor (41), mostly as an extra. Among his credited roles he played Amos in ""Drums Along the Mohawk"" (1939), Sgt Schattuck in ""Fort Apache"" (1948), and the barman in ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" (1962).

Director John Ford (1894-1973) and Wayne worked together on 21 films, one of the most prodigious collaborations in film history. This was Ford's 107th film (including 61 silent films). He had already won 3 Oscars - ""How Green was My Valley"" (1941), ""The Grapes of Wrath"" (1940), and ""The Informer"" (1935) - and made such memorable films as ""Stagecoach"" (1939) and ""Young Mr. Lincoln""- both Oscar nominated (but not winners).

Ford's relationship with Wayne was complex. He would use him in a film and then go for years without using him again, often because Wayne had a successful film with another director. They last worked together in 1940 (""The Long Voyage Home"").

FWIW - Ford was injured during production and Montgomery took over for him, helping launch Montgomery on his career as a director. Wayne resented this as he expected Ford to ask him to take over.

Ford's good friend, Frank Wead (Comdr. USN Ret.) worked on the script. Wead (1895-1947) fought in WW 1 as an Ensign and got promoted to Lt. JG. After the war he worked at the Naval Air Station in Pensacola where he became an aviator, and he served in WW 2. In his spare time, Wead wrote screenplays, mostly military, and eventually saw 8 films made including ""Test Pilot"" (1938) and ""The Citadel"" (1938). John Wayne played him in ""Wings of Eagles"" (1957), directed by Ford.

The great Herbert Stothart (1885-1949) was the composer. Stothart won the Oscar for ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939) and was nominated 9 more times. He was often used in period pieces, and his films include ""Treasure Island"" (1934), Viva Villa"" (1934), ""David Copperfield"" (1935), Anna Karenina"" (1935), ""Tale of Two Cities"" (1935), and ""Romeo and Juliette"" (1936).

Arnold Gillepsie (1899-1978) was nominated for an Oscar for special effects. Gillepsie received 12 Oscar nominations and won 3 times (""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo"", ""Green Dolphin Street"" and ""Ben Hur"")

Douglas Shearer (1899-1971) was nominated for Sound. He was the brother of film star Norma Shearer who was the wife of MGM big wig Irving Thalberg, so one-time unemployed Shearer soon found himself as head of the Sound department. Over 20+ years he supervised sound production on nearly 1,000 films, earning 22 Oscar nominations and 10 wins, including ""The Big House"" (1930), ""San Francisco"" (1936), and ""The Great Caruso"" (1951).

War films were plentiful in 1945, but the top grossing films were ""Mon and Dad"", ""The Bells of St. Mary's"", ""Leave Her to Heaven"", ""Spellbound"", ""The Dolly Sisters"", ""Weekend at the Waldorf"", etc. The only war film to show up in the top 15 was ""A Bell for Adano"". The big Oscar winner was ""The Lost Weekend"" (Director, Picture, Actor).

Notable war films released that year included Jimmy Cagney's ""Blood on the Sun"",  Errol Flynn's ""Objective Burma"", John Garfield's ""Pride of the Marines"", Burgess Meredith's ""The Story of GI Joe"", Dana Andrew's ""A Walk in the Sun"", and John Wayne's ""Back to Bataan"".

Bataan was a popular film subject and in addition to this film we have ""Bataan"" (1943), ""So Proudly we Hail"" (1943), ""Cry Havoc"" (1943) and ""Back to Bataan"" (1945).

The film was nominated for two Oscars (Visual Effects and Sound). The NY Times' Bosley Crowther called it ""a stirring picture of a small but vital aspect of the war"" and ""a moving remembrance of things past."" He praised the ""thrilling and electrifying"" action scenes, called Montgomery ""a fine and laconic officer"", said ""Wayne is magnificently robust as his tenacious executive"" and ""Donna Reed is extraordinarily touching.""

Films that came out during the war did very well at the box office, but this film came out in December, and it seems people were no longer interested in war films, despite the quality of this one. In 1946 there was not a single war film released, and they began to appear again in 1947 (""13 Rue Madeline"") and 1948 (""Arch of Triumph"", ""Command Decision"", ""Fighter Squadron)

Fans of the Duke and World War 2 films will want to see this film.",1309132800,5,7280,4.764098490865766
115791,5,0790744236,"Having served in the Navy as a musician during the mid-sixties, I had the honor of being assigned to then an Admiral - John Bulkeley's band. While the movie named the character John Brinkley, the story was about John Bulkeley who won the Congressional Medal of Honor after he and his PT boat crew rescued MacArthur and his family from the Island of Corregidor. After I reported aboard the U.S.S. Columbus for duty, that evening I had a private viewing of the film which was the Admiral's policy for any and all who was assigned to his staff (his band was part of the staff). To this day, I frequently watch the film and I still find it to be a great movie. What makes the movie even more special is that director John Ford was an Admiral in the Navy Reserve where he served his annual two week active duty tour with his buddy Admiral Bulkeley. Talk about a bunch of swashbucklers! Since the band played for the Admiral's numerous receptions, we witnessed them in real time as well as hoasting a few side by side with them. While we exercised a certain amount of decorum, they treated us like we were part of the guys. This movie is a 'must' for any swabbie's video library.",1303862400,5,1173,4.410138248847926

115793,5,0790744236,"Wayne and Ford, what can you say? This film is a good as they come a classic film about one of the darkest days in American History. We'd been attacked without warning and/or provocation, a great portion of our Pacific Fleet lay in ruins and the enemy was advancing on all fronts. Into this desperate tableau throw in a group of young officers trained on a new type of weapon which must quickly find its place in a new type of naval war, carrier based war. While Wayne and Reed might have provided the names and the romantic sizzle in this film it was Robert Montgomery's subtle and nuanced performance that all but steals the show in this one.

The Scene where Montgomery has to leave men behind to get ""key Army and Navy Personnel"" out, is one of these most heart rending in movie history, perhaps only matched by Noel Coward at the end of ""In Which We Serve"", when overcome with emotion he turns and walks away from his Officers knowing they'll never serve together again. These subtle touches are what make Ford perhaps the greatest film director of all time. This is a must watch for me. I watch it everytime it's on and once or twice a year I dig out this DVD.  It's quite simply, great film and pretty good history.

115794,3,0790744236,"I'd have to say that I was a little disappointed in this movie.

While the performance of Robert Montgomery was quite good, I found John Wayne's role was less than expected. There were a number of scenes in which he was the central figure, but curiously he had very little to say,and when he made some remarks, they seemed awkward and stilted. The supposed ""romance"" between he and Donna Reed was largely ceremonial as well, and not convincing at all. One familiar face was present--Marshall Thompson, witha fairly substantial role for someone who was only about 18-19 at the time.

While this movie is decent enough, I'd much rather watch other WW2 movies, such as ""Battleground"" and ""Run Silent, Run Deep"".The characters were much better developed, and more interesting, than the ones presented here.",1286323200,3,802,4.977611940298507

115798,5,0790744236,"While I hesitate to say that this was Wayne's best war picture, it does stand in the first ranks.  The story (and Rockq there is a story) lies in the period when the American forces and the people of the Philippines were being kicked by everything the Japs had--which was plenty.  The story tells the story of the PT boats, their crews, and the work of making the top brass see that the little boats had a place as an offensive and defensive weapons--especially in places where larger ships could not go or were not available.  Everything is placed to the side to tell this--and thanks to the motion picture crew, you can see how frail and dealy they were.  As for romance, war is no place for romancing the ladies although, Lord knows, the guys tried.  This is a film to own, and to remember the real men and women who lived these perilous times.

Two notes, if you look at the picture in the back, I got a feeling that the picture is one of Dan Daily and the Duke--who were in ""The Wings of Eagles"".  Also, when the delivery service is bad--and sometimes even Amamzon has a bad mail day--don't blame the flubbin' picture!!!!

115799,4,0790744236,"MGM was the Rolls Royce of studios in Hollywood in the thirties and forties. The producers reigned supreme and there was usually not much chance for really creative film making especially after the death of Irving Thalberg in 1936. In the forties, Louis B Mayer dominated and his penchant for family schmaltz meant that much of the studio's product from that period is more dated than other films of the period.  When a really creative director like John Ford turned up at MGM and was not curtailed, then his ability combined with the first rate production values in all departments meant something special was assured.

""They were Expendable"" is a superb war film, a sober account of the role of the U boats in the fight against the Japanese. There are so many detailed reviews on Amazon so I will only add that, in a faultless film, the only possible complaint is the score is overwrought in a few spots, the print is excellent and the package contains no extras except the original trailer.  A commentary would have been welcome. The DVD is best value if purchased as part of one of the John Wayne Collections.",1267228800,2,1113,4.668367346938775
115800,5,0790744236,"This was John Wayne's third film with John Ford, and first since The Long Voyage Home, made before the U.S. entered World War II.  By the time They Were Expendable was made, the war was finishing up, and director Ford, first lead Robert Montgomery, and cinematographer Joseph H. August among others in the cast and crew had all served in the military during the conflict.  But not second lead Wayne, who plays Lt. (Junior Grade) Rusty Ryan as a man full of inner turmoil and doubts likely mirroring the star's own psychological issues at the time.  Ford picked on Wayne mercilessly on the set, and the fact that he and his star eventually came to terms with each other (through the intercession of Montgomery) certainly helped to heal the wounds, as they worked together regularly for the next 17 years.  But it also left it's mark on Wayne's performance, and perhaps on his acting style as a whole.

Though Montgomery is first-billed here, plays the senior officer and has roughly the same screen time as Wayne, the Duke is certainly the standout.  This is not to say anything negative about Montgomery's performance - he's quite good as Lt. John Brickley, the commander of a PT boat squadron who has to deal with the restlessness of his men, particularly Ryan, as they are fed up and without much to do just on the eve of war; the higher brass doesn't see the value in the small, quick boats.  Ryan wants to leave and move over to a destroyer, hoping to get his own command at some point, but he doesn't hesitate to follow Montgomery and staying with the PT boat group after war is declared and the men start running mostly support missions in the Phillipines.  Eventually, combat missions do come, and early on Ryan is injured and falls for lovely nurse Sandy (Donna Reed) as he recuperates.

With the impending fall of the last American outposts in the islands, Bataan and Corregidor, the boats are ordered to help evacuate the high brass, including General MacArthur, and as combat grows ever more dangerous Ryan becomes more and more frustrated, not being able to see Sandy and eventually not able to communicate with her at all.  His conflict between duty and his need to be with her forms much of the drama of the later part of the film, and Wayne conveys it all beautifully in what is the best performance I've seen from him up to this point.  Sure there's more than a bit of the typical Wayne bravado and bluster, but he also plays the weariness and fears of the man who has to keep living day to day, never knowing if he'll see this woman again with whom he could only have the briefest of moments.

Like all of the best of Ford that I've seen, this seems to somehow work simultaneously as a star-driven vehicle and an ensemble piece, with Montgomery and Wayne in command but occasionally being upstaged by various members of their crew, notablly Ward Bond, Donald Curtis and Cameron Mitchell.  The camaraderie feels very real, the jokes about food, and slacking off, and injuries come off as natural ways to ease tensions - this is one film from this director where the humor is perfectly integrated and never comes off as stupid or overdone.  The rah-rah patriotism, particularly in some of the musical choices near the end, seems just a wee much for me at times - after all we'd won the war by the time the film was finished and released - but this is a minor gripe.  It's also refreshingly less racist than a lot of American WWII films; apart from references to the enemy as ""Jap"" or ""Nip"" a few times there's really little sense of hatred or bigotry - this is a film about soldiering, a job that people had to do, and did it well.

Joseph August's black-and-white cinematography is just gorgeous, with all the shades and textures of great noir in the nighttime and indoor scenes, and the action sequences are amazingly realistic for a film of this period.  If the ending were just a little bit tighter, and if I didn't feel that Wayne's character should have been allowed to vent just a bit more on a couple of occasions - he seems close to bursting a few times - this would be perfect.  As it is, it's darn close and I wouldn't be surprised to like it more on a repeat viewing.  At the moment, probably my favorite WWII film made during the wartime period, and Wayne's performance belongs in the same company as his work in SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON and THE SEARCHERS.",1266105600,5,4384,4.540609137055838

American land forces in the Philippines were greatly outnumbered by Japanese forces. The Japanese had aerial supremacy, and had battleships and other large naval vessels. The US Navy, and the naval lieutenant played by John Wayne, had PT boats, which some called ""motorized canoes"". The Americans were told in no uncertain terms that they were to be sacrificed--in effect, bunting so that some successive American forces could score the home run.

The worth of the PT boats was proved by the sinking of a large Japanese military vessel by sustained torpedo fire. They were also used to evacuate General McArthur and other important military figures.

Bataan fell. The PT boat officers were evacuated by planes to the US to develop PT strategy. McArthur said: ""I shall return"".",1263168000,2,897,5.095238095238095

They interpret the song to refer to Filipinos in a racist insult. However, sailors have called ordinary seamen ""deck apes,"" ""powder monkeys"" and the like for centuries. One can find discussions of this in many online dictionaries. The lyrics in the film say ""the monkeys have no tails, they've been bitten off by whales,"" a rather whimsical view of maritime life. The verse, ""He won't go back to Subic anymore"" obviously is meant for the ""Doc"" who sheds a silent ""tear"" as one of the ""monkeys.""

It seems that anyone who dares to do so gets accused of not knowing history or not appreciating the sacrifice of those fighting the Japanese in those ""bleak war years."" Isn't it possible to judge this movie as a movie, without mixing it up with the actual war which it depicts? And by ""judge,"" I mean - since this is my personal review - I want to express my honest opinion. Will anyone tell me that I should write dishonest reviews on Amazon?

I feel nothing but admiration and gratitude for all those who have sacrificed for the defense of our country and other countries. But that has nothing to do with my opinion about this movie. I didn't enjoy it. I found it mostly boring. Of the four people watching it, two fell asleep and I almost did. And the only reason my uncle did not fall asleep is because he had just had a two-hour nap before we started watching.

It was my uncle's idea to watch the film. He remembered it as ""one of the best war movies ever made."" But for some reason he couldn't find it at any of the libraries or movie rental places. I searched around and finally found it on VHS. I now know why it is so hard to find: too few people want to watch it!

I suspect any critical review is going to come down to the entertainment factor. This movie tells an important but neglected story about the war, about the PT boats and the hopelessly outnumbered troops in the Philippines in the wake of Pearl Harbor. But dang it all, it's just not that entertaining to watch! Watching this movie is like eating canned spinach, which is good for you, sort of. As one reviewer who gave it five stars said, it can be a bit romantic and sentimental, but I didn't mind that - though I did mind the constant patriotic music track. But then, what would you expect for a war movie made in 1945? I felt like I was watching a story about something I wanted to learn more about, but I wasn't getting enough information. If anyone ever questioned why they were being abandoned and neglected by the US Navy, the standard reply was, ""That's what we've been trained to do."" What does that mean? They've been trained to fight and die without any hope of support? How much did their sacrifice help the US regroup after Pearl?

There is some hokey stuff in this film. John Wayne, as Lt. ""Rusty"" Ryan, skipper of a PT boat, complains about being ""bored to death"" running messages, before war has been declared and before Pearl Harbor. Apparently he'd rather be doing something more exciting than running messages, like sinking ships and killing people. Lucky for him he gets his excitement before too long. Good times! Then there's the scene in which the PT crew manages to get some torpedoes from a visiting commander when they blackmail him about playing the leading lady role in a Naval Academy production of Tess of the D'Urbervilles. Mind you, he wasn't going to give them any torpedoes at all except for that embarrassment. As an aside, I'd sure like to know why the Academy wanted to put on a production of Tess in the first place! Is it possible that even back then there were gay men in the armed forces? I won't ask, and please don't tell!

My uncle, who had such fond memories of this film, sadly decided that it wasn't nearly as good anymore. But there is one good result from watching this movie, as we've decided to watch more classic movies together. I'm sure that many of them will hold up.",1243209600,8,3461,4.418495297805642

115809,3,0790744236,"Shot during the closing weeks of WWII, They Were Expendable is the somewhat real life story of the American defeat in the Philippines as seen through the eyes of the men of a PT boat squadron commanded by Lt. John Bulkeley (called Brickley in the film and played by Robert Montgomery) and his second in command Lt. Robert Kelly (named Rusty Ryan played by John Wayne). The concept of PT boat warfare is a new idea to the navy and the men are given limited assignments. The movie was directed by Capt. John Ford USNR and based on a screenplay by Cmdr. Frank (Spig) Wead, USN who became the subject of another John Ford movie entitled The Wings of Eagles (1957).

There is no elaborate plot to the film, no Hollywood drama here, no special effects, no plot twisting events, just ordinary men doing an ordinary job under difficult times. It is simply the story of men trying to survive on a day to day basis in wartime. They are having to cope with the loss of their fellow crewmen and the defeat which they can sense is coming as the United States slowly retreats from the Philippine Islands. These men are meant to buy time, a delaying action, until the United States can gather its forces for all out war.

There is little or no real emphasis on combat scenes and the scenes are limited, almost as if they were unintended. The minor characters of the film (the men of the PT boat crews) are hard to follow in that their speaking parts are limited, making remembering them as individuals difficult. Donna Reed's character, Sandy an army nurse, really wasn't worth the extra scenes given to her but is more in tune with Ford's having to have a romantic character in the text of the film. The film is worth seeing, giving the viewer an incite into early days of WWII.

NOTE:  This film is available as a double feature alone with ""Flying Leathernecks.""  Recommend buying it this way instead of singularly.",1235174400,6,1902,4.533527696793003
115810,5,0790744236,"This happens to be one of my favorite John Wayne movies.  Too bad the colorized version released by TNT isn't available.  This movie made you feel like you were actually there.  The footage of the PT Boats, fighting against Japanese ships and aircraft, under attack and on the attack against superior naval forces, was all outstanding!  It doesnt get any better. It captured the spirit of what went on during the early days of World War II.  If you want to get a better feel for this movie, read the book put out by the Naval Institute titled, ""The Fleet the Gods forgot"".  Read that book, then watch this movie again, and you will understand how acurate this movie is.  American sailors were in a desparate situation, and called upon to sail out and fight against great odds, with no hope of victory.  The Japanese had an entire fleet at the Phillipines, and were in the process of a full Invasion.  All the Americans had were a few PT boats, and they accepted the challenge to the best of their ability.  I read another review on this page placed in 2008 by Greg Norgaad, who said the movie was boring and gave it, very undeservedly, 1 star.  Not liking a movie is one thing, but to actually take time to place such a negative comment on to Amazon's web page, well, I think this person has way too much time on his hands and needs to take up a hobby.

I had the honor of meeting Admiral Bulkeley before his death.  As a naval officer, it was an honor to follow in the footsteps of this unassuming hero; a holder of the Congressional Medal of Honor.

I sure like Mr. Montgomery in this role. Also, John Ford put such realism & detail into everything---the shadows of the characters in the tunnels of Bataan is quite effective.

This gives you a clue about the reason for the making of this film at the (victorious) end of the war in 1945.

Americans have short memories. Very short. The OSM judged there was adverse public reaction to the abandonment of the Philippines in 1942. The film counters, or blunts, the question, ""why did we pull out when we won the war anyway?""

Of course, the question is highly illogical but whoever said the general public is able to formulate logical questions?

It wasn't the actors (Ward Bond is one of my favorite all-time character actors), but rather how the film portrayed them. For me, it hit a massive low when the served the officers and the Nurse portrayed by Donna Reed dinner and how they moved around like adoring busboys. Then they serenaded them from below the thatched hut.
As a former enlisted man, I would never consent to anything like that. The officers have it better off anyway, so why would I make their lot better when mine is so miserable?
The other scene which annoyed me was at the end when we see the men trudging off, rifles over their shoulders looking up into the sky, seeing the last plane leaving, and they all smile.
Now, maybe I'm splitting hairs here, but frankly if I were any of them, I'd hope that the Japanese would have blown them out of the sky. After all, they're getting away and abandoning me and the other men to what would be a pretty terrible fate. Why the hell would I smile at that?

""But I must disagree with one reviewer who wrote that this movie was the least racist. The racism was right there at the beginning, in the bar, when the sailors sing about ""the monkeys have no tails in Zamboanga."" It is directed, not at the Japanese, but at the Filipinos. It is a view of Filipinos that sadly, is still shared by a lot, maybe millions of Americans. And irony of ironies, the Filipina singer in that scene bursts into ""Let Freedom Ring"" (to the tune of Britain's ""God Save the King"") even as her country is occupied by a foreign power.""

I viewed the singer as a deliberate contradiction to the sailors' actions, deliberately placed by Ford to remind us that ""we are all brothers now.""  In this respect, I think it was ahead of its time, and one of the many seemingly contradictory film presentations Ford made of racial toleration throughout his career.",1149897600,5,989,4.607954545454546

Director John Ford lets Robert Montgomery shine as the captain in charge of a rag-tag group of PT boats and their crews in the Phillipine islands that are struggling to survive their daily soirees against the Japanese fleet.  With the threat of a Japanese invasion looming, the daily runs become more intense and dangerous with heavy casulities from Montgomery's unit adding to the tension within the group.  This movie really gives the feel of what it must have been like - the boredom, the camaraderie, the little moments between people who are facing death.  Montgomery, a real-life war hero, adds authenticity to the film and John Wayne, in a supporting role, is fantastic as Montgomery's right-hand man.  His scenes with Donna Reed, as a nurse, are as touching as you'll ever see the Duke on film.  Since this movie was made during the war, the ending is open-ended - no happy endings for anyone really.

This movie never hits a wrong note - none of the overt corniness that some of Ford's later movies drifted into.  Everything works to tell the powerful story of men (and women) on Bataan awaiting the coming invasion of the Japanese and doing their best to keep fighting in the meantime.  This film extols war and the value (but also the wrenching heartache) of sacrifice for the cause, and it was made by people who had experienced war firsthand.

115838,5,0790744236,"John Ford's 1945 ""They Were Expendable"" is a somber account of the genesis of the PT boat as an effective tool in naval warfare.  The movie, based on a true story, follows the exploits of a PT boat squadron based in the Philippines in the early stages of the Pacific campaign.  The Japanese are gradually pushing the Allied forces out of this large island chain.

Robert Montgomery and John Wayne respectively play lieutenants Brickley and Ryan, two dedicated PT boat commanders.  Prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor they are endeavoring to prove the worthiness of these boats as fighting machines.  The admirality and naval brass prefer the more heavily armed destroyers and battleships in this kind of conflict.  At the onset of war, Montgomery, Wayne and their squadron of boats prove their mettle in many confrontations against the advancing foe.

Ford does a realistic job of authenticating his movie through the eyes of co-star, the alluring Donna Reed.  In her prequel to her Oscar winning role in the wartime epic ""From Her to Eternity"", she plays an Iowa born Navy nurse, Lt. Davyss.  She helps Wayne rehabilitate  from an injury suffered in battle and they become romantically involved.  Through her we see both the fear and hope felt by the men and women that served as the Japanese conquered more and more territory.

The movie chronicles the retreat from the Philippines by General Mac Arthur followed by his mantra ""we shall return"".  Ford, a former navy man ably aided by Montgomery uncharacteristically heralded in his flick a military defeat, which validated it more so than if it had been a typical propagandized piece.  Strong acting performances were turned in by Montgomery, Wayne and Reed.  The pugnacious character actor Ward Bond was excellent, as usual, as chief boatswain ""Boats"" Mulcahey",1115942400,5,1814,5.0
115839,5,0790744236,"John Ford's THEY WERE EXPENDABLE tells the story of the fledgling PT (patrol torpedo) boat branch of the US Navy and its valiant, and futile, defense of Manila immediately following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941.

  Few directors possess the passionate affection Ford has for his subjects.  Ford idolizes and idealizes his soldiers and sailors.  As a consequence, his movies usually aren't very plot driven.  Rather, they are tone poems, love letters to the warriors he so deeply admires.  Not that TWE doesn't hit a major note or two - the PT boat role as a fighting arm is established, battles are fought and boats are sunk.  Yet Ford never seems all that interested in serving plot points.  He wants to paint Heroes.  In any other director this romantic treatment would seem trite and contrived, but Ford practically built the clich&eacute;, so I suppose if anyone has the right to use it, it's Ford.

  Ford's heroes die talking.  Rare is the mortally wound Ford warrior who is not borne from the noisy cauldron of battle to a quiet corner and allowed a passing speech.  I don't mean to mock this, but I've never experienced the well of grief such scenes are meant to evoke.  It happens a brief time or two in TWE, but the moments are over quickly enough.

  If Ford's choice and treatment of material is romantic and sentimental, it's fortunate that his actors usually aren't.  Robert Montgomery and John Wayne star and both give restrained performances as PT boat commanders.  Ford surrounds them with his usual cast of highly competent character actors - Ward Bond, Jack Holt, et al - and seamlessly integrates shots of real combat in battle scenes.  There's a scene where two PT boats attack a Japanese cruiser that is one of the best action sequences I've ever seen.

  THEY WERE EXPENDABLE is a great war movie.",1106179200,50,1835,4.749206349206349
115840,5,0790744236,"If you're looking for mock Hollywood heroics or a bloated 'action movie', try The Flying Tigers or The Fighting Seabees.  This beautifully made, understated film is about the courage and dedication of the forsaken Phillipine defenders in 1941-42. In particular, the scene in which a radio announces the American surrender tells what those early days were really like. John Ford, who served in the Navy, casts Robert Montgomery as a PT squadron leader (in fact, Commander Montgomery served in the same PT squadron with John Kennedy).  The b&w photography is outstanding, often mesmerizing, quite unique for a war film, with locations that are dead ringers for the originals.  Adapted from the 1942 Pulitzer prize book by a reporter who was on the scene, it follows the true story fairly closely.  Every performance is right-on, as are the combat scenes.  Not a pumped-up excercise in flag waving; rather, it's a well executed tale of courage in desperate times.  Every scene fascinates with the ambiance of its time and place, and with chilling historical accuracy.  If the ending doesn't get a grip on you, you're a lost cause.  And, yes, Doug MacArthur is treated like a god -- which, in those days, he was.  No ostentatious preaching here; it's understated brilliance from start to finish, and an education in an earlier generation's attitude toward duty, integrity, and sacrifice.  Bruce Willis fans stay clear; this is a war movie for grown-ups.",1064016000,75,1449,5.050420168067227

115842,5,0790744236,"More than 60 years ago, Japanese forces attacked Pearl Harbor. During the months which followed, the United States struggled to recover as Japanese military victories continued throughout the Pacific. This film is based on William Lindsay White's interviews of four members of Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Three, published as They Were Expendable in 1942. John Ford and Robert Montgomery co-directed and Montgomery also stars as Lieutenant John Brickley. Throughout much of this film, Brickley's squadron only provides courier service between Bataan and Corregidor. When given the opportunity, however, Squadron Three does manage to sink several of the enemy's ships as the Japanese complete their conquest of the Philippines, eventually forcing the American forces to surrender.
With regard to the film's title, not all of those involved with resisting the Japanese were expendable. General Douglas Mac Arthur is ordered by President Roosevelt to relocate with his family and staff to Australia. Brickley's squadron makes their escape possible. As the film ends, he and Lieutenant J.G. ""Rusty"" Ryan (John Wayne) return to the United States on the last plane out. Their men will now be fighting on foot...at least for a while. In the final scene, as they trudge proudly down the beach and the plane carrying Brickley and Ryan rises above them, the soundtrack offers a muted choral rendition of ""The Battle Hymn of the Republic."" A distinctive Ford touch.
The greatness of this film is best explained in terms of (a) the generally non-verbal but nonetheless close relationships between Brickley and Ryan, and, between them and their crews; (b) the romantic feelings shared by Ryan and Lieutenant Sandy Davys (Donna Reed) which Ford never permits to deteriorate into sentimentality; (c) Montgomery's highly-effective portrayal of a soft-spoken leader; and (d) Wayne's (for me) surprisingly subtle and sensitive performance, perhaps equaled (in terms of nuance) only by his performances in The Searchers and The Shootist.
It is worth noting, also, that Ford as well as his cast and crew obviously had great respect for the men and women in the American military services. They avoid all of the pitfalls which ruin so many other war films. For example, character stereotyping (e.g. including a philosophical Jewish cab driver from Brooklyn) and using melodramatic music to manipulate a viewer's emotions during especially dramatic moments. This film has integrity in all respects, suggesting that although many of those whom it portrays may have been expendable, they are nonetheless admirable.",1059609600,104,2589,5.410891089108911
115843,5,0790744236,"It is easy to understand why ""They Were Expendable"" was not a popular film at the time of release. America had won the war, and the public was in no mood to view a film that told a story of defeat. Pity. This brilliant work told a simple story of how men, unprepared for war, dealt with the all too real weight of impending defeat at the hands of a superior enemy. The cast is outstanding, especially John Wayne, who actually plays a role with understated (for him)simplicity. The action sequences are astonishing - especially the initial sequence in Manilla Bay. Based on a true story, John Ford's respectful tribute is wonderful to behold. In my opinion, ""Battleground"" ""12'O Clock High"" and ""They Were Expendable"" are the best period WWII films ever made.",1042502400,3,758,4.706766917293233

Robert Montgomery is excellent with just the right blend of humor to off set John Wayne's characters hot headeness. The supporting cast is outstanding, with the great Ward Bond, a now forgotten character actor who made more classic movies than any other actor in history, from Gone with the Wind to the Maltese Falcon, The Searchers to The Grapes of Wrath......This picture should be shown to the younger people today along with an explination that this is some of what their Grandparents went through.

115846,5,0790744236,"A superior war film, shot just as WWII was winding down.  Tightly scripted, beautifully shot, with suspenseful, visceral action, this tells the story of how PT boats -- mobile torpedo ships -- made their mark in the Pacific war theatre.  John Wayne, playing second billing to Robert Montgomery, delivers one of his most understated and enjoyable performances.  Realistic but full of optimism, this film matter-of-factly captures the visceral sense of danger the war brought with it -- from the early Japanese raids following Pearl Harbor, to the sense of dread and helplessness soldiers felt under bombardment while convalescing in hospital bivouacs.  A fine cast of supporting actors project the same sort of pragmatic American amiability as seen in the ""Terry & The Pirates"" cartoon strip.  The film is particularly notable for the atypically bleak, inconclusive ending, which shows the disheartening midwar defeat of the American forces in the Pacific theatre -- we know, from the modern vantagepoint, that the Americans ultimately won, but director John Ford doesn't show it in his film.  Excellent film; highly recommended.",1036886400,10,1128,5.380681818181818
115847,5,0790744236,"An absolute must-see film for lovers of films about the WWII era: John Ford passionately directed this superior slice of what the REAL WWII was all about.  This picture not only shows the pain, loneliness and sacrifice of war - in this case, the Americans in the Phillipines doomed to Japanese conquest - but effectively captures the mystique of heroism.  Everything about this film is heroic, and movingly dipicted, right from the first scenes which show Montgomery, Wayne and others maneuvering their PT boats for admiral Trowbridge and other ranking Navy men, watching them skim the waters of Manila Bay in late 1941.  Because I'm such an avid fan of this brilliantly realistic and finely acted account of war, I don't want to ruin it for others by giving away more details of the plot: just know that many more ""modern"" films don't come close to capturing the period flavour of detail as done in this 1945 masterpiece.  Ford packs one poignant and  powerful scene after another into this tremendous film, and Montgomery gives an outstanding performance as the PT squadron leader: he's a man of quiet reserve who carries out orders which he doesn't always agree with, doing so with unflagging determination. Location filming of the film was done in Key Biscayne, Florida - which suitably doubled for the exotic Phillipines.  The film caused some post-production problems.  Donna Reed's part, supposedly based upon the life of military nurse Lt. Beulah Greenwalt, sued the studio (M-G-M) and ultimately won $290,000 - which was a lot of cabbage back then.  No matter, the film garnered huge financial profits for the studio.  Wayne later stated that director Ford  ""was awfully intense while directing the picture and showed more concentration than I have ever witnessed from a director - I think he was really out to achieve something"".  No fears. He did.",1032912000,11,1858,4.980582524271845
115848,5,0790744236,"It seems odd to refer to a war flick as a masterpiece. But after spending [$$]to watch the computerized, overhyped, dumbed-down disaster called ""Pearl Harbor"" recently, I had to rush home and drag out my copy of They Were Expendable to re-discover what a REAL war movie is!  The director, writer, tech crew, and many performers were WWII Vets: Ford was at Midway and Normandy, Montgomery was a PT commander in the Pacific (and he directed the action sequences and other scenes while Ford was laid up with an injury).  If you've seen pics of the original Subic Bay, etc., you'll see that the filmed locations (Florida) are a perfect match for the real scenes.  The first-rate script thankfully holds true to the original book most of the time, and the special effects don't fly in the face of belief the way most action films do.  Those who've never seen R. Montgomery in a flick will discover what a great actor Elizabeth Montgomery's dad was.  He also went on to become one of early tv's most creative live-drama producers.  The photography is strikingly moody, often gorgeous (photo buffs will have a field day!).  Above all, the film reveals the attitudes, the bravery, the social values, the tragedy of that era as no other war film before or since.  If you liked ""Pearl Harbor"" and its ilk, you'll hate this movie -- there's no hype, no fiction, no self-absorbed denial of reality -- just real grown-up men and women in a dark time in our country's history, facing duty and danger with courage and dignity.  Ford does have some comic relief now and then (note the slightly satiric edge in the sequence with Doug MacArthur).  This movie is about sacrifice and honor, something sorely missing nowadays, and how the characters of that time and place rose to the awesome challenge that was WWII.  Technically darn near perfect, with supurb performances from Montgomery, Wayne, and the rest.  Donna Reed in her first film is terrifically charming and oh, so real.  Best of all, it's a true story, authentically filmed.  Unless you're a totally insensitive louse, you won't be disappointed.  Terrific ending, too.",1029110400,8,2112,4.8277777777777775

115850,5,0790744236,"They were expendable is an excellent John Ford-directed story of the men who fought for recognition of the PT boat during WWII. This story takes place in the Phillipines prior to the fall of the islands to the Japanese Army. It explores the short-sightedness of the commanders who refused to see the boats for what they were, the sacrifices of the people captured by the Japanese armies, or, in some cases, sacrificed rather than being evacuated. It is a great story, featuring Robert Montgomery and John Wayne (in one of his most human roles,) paired with the
great Donna Reed.

Ford and his scriptwriter Frank Wead based this movie at least partly on the actual experiences of PT Commanders. Ford, who filmed many operations for the OSS, was well aware of the utility of the PTs. He was serving in the Navy, (filming battle footage and making movies) at the time of this filming, which was before the end of the war. In fact, Ford refused to leave his important duties and make the film until he was ordered to do so.

Robert Montgomery, like Ford a Naval man, directed some of the scenes for this movie when Ford got sick. His (and Ford's) naval experience helped make this film quite realistic in nature.",1014854400,20,1208,4.640186915887851

John Wayne is excellent as is the entire cast and Ward Bond does an outstanding job. The battle scenes are filmed by the master John Ford. Some of the scenes with the PT boats attacking the Japanese ships is fantastic, decks awash and guns blazing, the crew determined in the face of some horrendous shell bursts. Outstanding.

Based on the actual exploits of Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Three, this jewel of a film illuminates the daily lives of forgotten men whose sacrifices became the foundation of our eventual victory over Imperial Japan.  It tells a story shared by many thousands of ordinary American and Filipino men and women who stood fast, with no hope of victory, to oppose an overwhelming force.  It is a story about duty and honor . . . to country, to friends and to self.

115854,5,0790744236,"They Were Expendable is the story of a small number of Sailors who found themselves in the Phillipines as World War II started.  These men are operating small torpedo boats for the Navy which doesn't seem to have much of a use for them, if one listems to the admirals and captains viewing them in action.
The all star cast includes George Montgomery, Donna Reed, John Wayne and Ward Bond, amongst others.  All are excellent and make this story much more real than it might otherwise have been.  You get the feel for the Philippines and the climate.  Plus the deterioriation of the situation as the Army is forced down the Bataan Peninsula to the island of Corregidor and the ultimate siege and defeat.
Many people ""remember"" Pearl Harbor but don't quite recall that the Philippines was a starker defeat for the United States.  If you look at it objectively, Pearl Harbor was essentially avenged at the Battle of Midway.  The Philippines took over2 1/2 years to see the return of US forces and it then evolved into a slogging match with the Japanese Army that went on until the surrender of Japan in 1945.  Pearl Harbor sticks in the mind, the Philippines rapidly faded away.
This movie brings back the events that made up the US role in the Philippines in 1941 and early 42.  You see at the end that there is not a happy ending.  The romantic interest stays behind to become a POW.  The remaining members of the PT crews become rifle carrying Sailors as they march off into the bush.  Pay attention to Montgomerey's farewell talk to his men.  It should rank up there with Washington's farewell to the Army.
This is a film that should be seen by all with an interst in Naval and Military history as well as the events of 1941-42.  It is a movie about people that could be anyone of us.",990057600,39,1784,4.503105590062112

Many people thought John Wayne was just an allright type of actor, but he gives his best performance of his life in this movie. Robert Montgomery, who had just came back from active service, gives an outstanding performance as the skipper.
As all John Ford movie's are great, this is a masterpiece. The action scenes alone are worth the admission. The cast is very well known, but it seems that they are not acting, but actually fighting this war  with a great sense of dignity and valor.
I wish that Steven Spielberg would do another war movie like Saving Private Ryan, and do a remake of this film.  Most people today are not aware of the dark days for the United States that took place right after Pearl Harbor, and the fight that our men and women took to the Japanese is this lost cause.

A great performance by the Duke, who actually plays a  character instead of himself. I can't think of another Wayne performance  that equals the range of emotion he shows here. The live action sequences  are a rush, even now. Watching the squadron being inexorably eliminated  boat by boat, and how the early bravato fades to weary resignation by the  survivors is effectively handled by an excellent cast. Robert Montgomery  sets the tone from beginning to end. I especially liked the scene when the  old admiral ""told it like it us"" to Montgomery in his bombed-out  office.

115858,5,0790744236,"The PT Boats were not suppost to have that big of a role in WWII. Yet they did. They Were Expendable is based on a true story about a group of PT Boats that take place in the Battle Of The Philippines during the early months of WWII. They must transport officers and American's to Austrailia. Fight off the enemy and take supplies back and forth. It is a very tough job to do. And on several occasions some boats don't come back. The Navy finds that the boats are not of any real effectiveness. Or so they say. Lt. Ryan and Lt. Brickley finally show the Navy that the PT Boats are worth there money. So when the war gets into a faster pace, so do the crews. They hit, they fire, they run to fight another day. They do this so effectivley that they earn a reputation as being Expendable. The early days of WWII were dark and although they new that the odds were stacked greatly against them, they did the job as best as they could. Lt. Ryan finds a brief amount of time to have a little (but never enough) romance with Donna Reed. She tried to comfort him and he her, during the tough and uncertain times that lay ahead. But duty calls at the worst possible time when they are needed. Still it seems that since the PT Boats have proven to be worth while, they are just still used to transport officers around.
The films shows everything heart break, love, confusion, panic, combat, scared and being lonely. When it was released in 1945 it was not a big hit, since the war had been nearly won and people wanted to see a different movie than one about war, or not one that has Americans fighting to just hang on and get by with little or nothing. John Ford directed this wounderfull film, he himself saw action from Midway till the end of the war! He brought a different tone to the film, instead of someone that had never been in the war. Nominated for two Oscar's: Best Special Effects and Best Sound, They Were Expendable was and still is the best film released during the Second World War that has not lost a step since 1945!

My favorite scene is towards the end, when Robert  Montgomery and John Wayne have been called back to the safety of stateside  and they must leave their men behind, knowing that they will probably die  in the jungle fighting to follow.  Montgomery passes the command to Ward  Bond.  With almost any other director, this scene would be filled with  awkward salutes and standard farewell dialogue.

115861,5,0790744236,"My latest viewing of ""They Were Expendable,"" on the fine DVD transfer I just got, is now colored by the revelation that, contrary to myth, Douglas MacArthur was a demagogue, many of whose acts bordered on treason. In fact, it was partly through his incompetence that the lives of the heroes of this movie became ""Expendable"". However, at the time of the filming, MacArthur was a hero himself and deserving of the Lincoln-like treatment he's given by Ford.
If you know Joseph Campbell, you know that a myth is not a lie but a metaphor. John Ford has been unfairly criticized by many for his jingoistic, oversentimental grandiosity. But Ford was a myth-maker, not a documentarian. Myths, like religion, aren't supposed to be ""factual,"" and neither are Ford's. If his product is as the critics describe, then so is the time and place he depicts. The America of Manifest Destiny is indeed jingoistic, oversentimental (to our jaded sensibilities) and grandiose. That's the way it was. If you wish to quibble, do so with the period, not with Ford.
Unless you are bereft of human empathy, you'll see ""They Were Expendable"" for what it is: a masterful evocation of a time, not so long ago, when men and women rode their fear, despair and courage to Glory.
By the way, this review originally received only 2 out of 5 ""helpful"" votes.  I suspect, the ""unhelpful"" votes are from MacArthur acolytes, some of whom indicated to me their displeasure at my disrespect for the Great Man, who ended up being fired and who would have staged a coup d'etat if he thought he could get away with it.

The film is beautifully crafted and, as in other works by Ford, concentrates on the emotions and faces of the people involved especially in defeat. Donna Reed is lovely as a nurse, Sandy Davis, who has a brief romance with Wayne's character, Rusty. Neither know if they'll ever see each other again and, knowing what happened in Bataan, it's unlikely Davis made it out alive. I also felt sympathy for Rusty and Brickley when they were ordered to ship out and abandon their men. How they both must've felt like mud. I bet Brickley must've had a guilty conscience for the rest of his life. Most of those men left behind probably died.

In an interview with Lindsay Anderson, Ford claimed that he wanted the film to run an hour and 40 minutes. At two hours and 15 minutes, I'd have to agree with him.
