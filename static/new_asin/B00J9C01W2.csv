6342358,5,B00J9C01W2,"Episode 1 for TO2 was fantastic! If you weren't a fan in the beginning, it shouldn't be too difficult to catch up and keep up.

(EDIT)

Klaus (Joseph Morgan), plays the part of a troubled, selfish, somewhat redeemable immortal to a finish. He is evolving as a character and a vampire hybrid thanks in part to his new role as a father. Of course, he's still the ill-tempered, egotistical, snap-back vamp we all love! Elijah is a work in progress. He has changed since TVD (not quite the same) but he still offers a fantastic contrast to Klaus!

Unlike the first season, S2 focuses much more on the Original family and their history :)",1412985600,9,633,4.535087719298246
6342359,5,B00J9C01W2,"Just about most TV spinoffs are never as good as the original show. The Originals though is the exception to this. The characters are captivating and they made TVD all the better, more interesting and deliciously darker. So when that first episode aired for season I was hooked. TVD is addicting in the, I want to see what happens next kind of way. The Originals has plot twists, fights, drama, a little love here and there and all the blood and glory you want to see happening in New Orleans. I do hope that they keep this show going and while all TVD fans are dying to see some character cross-overs, I'm perfectly happy with whats going down in New Orleans. While it takes place in the same time period as TVD, its own show, its own characters and they keep it going just fine.",1412640000,19,780,4.386206896551724

The lead actors are fantastic (Elijah is my favorite), but I miss Rebecca.  The other female actresses are good, but she had an extra spark that was fun to watch.

6342500,5,B00J9C01W2,"Aaarg. I'm just so hooked on this show. I'm not really a fan of vampires or vampire like series (I never watched the Twilight movies) so I was first a bit hesitant to try this show. Read the reviews and decided to watch the first episode (of Season 1 of course) and that was that; I was hooked. The characters are amazing. Nikolaus, the werewolf/vampire hybrid who is the main character, surprises you constantly on how he reacts to different situations (most of the time it doesn't end very well for the other party if they piss him off) and how he developed and changed throughout the series. His  ""family is everything"" brother, the vampire Elijah, usually cleans up the ""mess"" Nikolaus causes with his temper. They both want their city, New Orleans, back which they built together, and run in a lot of trouble and danger threatening their lives and the ones of their family and close friends. If you are looking for something different than your usual vampire stuff stories take a good look at this series; you will love it.",1451001600,,1028,4.617486338797814

6342875,2,B00J9C01W2,"There were some clever twists I appreciated, but I thought some of the writing was bad. Characters were constantly doing really stupid things, and other things just didn't make sense. For instance, why is Rebekah absent for much of season 1 and 2? She was such a key character, and her absence made for an arbitrary void. Secondly, why did Elijah act noble until the end of season 1 and into season 2, when he became arrogant and rude? Lastly, why was Klaus trying to win his brothers (who are more powerful than him and who hate him) over to his side (and via torture), against their mother? And when Phin showed his firmness, why was he not killed? He was way too powerful to let live.",1439683200,,687,4.417322834645669

6343559,5,B00J9C01W2,"This series spin-off from The Vampire Diaries takes the story of werewolves, vampires and witches - regular people too - to New Orleans and stays there.  Not a bit creepy.  All the characters remain human.  There's a rich mixture of human traits infusing this fairytale of characters,  all of them with complex personalities.  Even when you are convinced someone is really bad, or really good,  that idea is turned on its head.  Everyone is both.  Just like people.  The main characters are brothers and sisters who were turned by magic into vampires by their mother to keep them safe from werewolves - about 1500 years ago.  And it is their story of growing up that dominates the plot.
The storyline is delightfully complex and suspenseful.  The second season just ended and I look forward to the third.",1431388800,,804,4.795620437956204

Each episode of the Originals suddenly jumps back to the beginning of the episode with the audio continuing where it's at in the episode. Very annoying.

Some of the later episodes don't show the plot line as moving forward or making sense with what the characters have previously stated/done in earlier episodes. I enjoy this series because it provides me with a chance to 'zone out' at the end of the day. Good entertainment.",1430352000,,430,4.671052631578948

Charles Michael Davis as Marcel is outstandingly charming and he deserves an award for his part as Marcel!  Danielle Gillies as the eccentric Elijah keeps the balance amongst the Mikaelson siblings and he is an integral member of the cast. I find the character Davina to be completely annoying however!

Spin off from The Vampire Diaries; Klaus and his brother Elijah head back to the City they helped build and create: New Orleans. Elijah quickly finds out why the Witches have brought Klaus there... Hayley, his werewolf one night fling, is pregnant. The Miracle Child? Possibly. Its all out supernatural war at it's best. The Mikaelson brothers then call upon their sister, Rebekah to return home and help ""The Original Famiy"" welcome Hayley, who just happens to be the next Queen of the Crescent Werewolf Pack, as one of their own, as well as await the birth of Hope Mikaelson. Born a Werewolf princess, also Witch, [(The first blood heir to The Original Witch)(Klaus,Elijah and Rebakah's Mother -Esther.)] Also some unknowns being inherited from Klaus; could he, being The Original Hybrid, actually pass down BOTH Vampire and Werewolf DNA to Hope; along with the Witch gene that comes from his mother. WOW this could really be a miracle child child, being ALL supernatural beings in one little girl?? ""Hope Mikaelson The Original Child."" I know one thing she will be powerful, also the most well-protected child you could imagine. Elijah and Klaus out to do anything and everything for Klaus' daughter, Elijah's niece, Nothing or No One should ""dare"" stand in their way. BUT there will be some. Some after Hope for their own gain. Most out to hurt The Originals, as Klaus has done to others many times, but Elijah's never ending battle for his brothers humanity is paying off.....Finally. Klaus does everything he can to keep his family together. The whole city of New Orleans goes crazy when hope is finally revealed. Hayley has unified the Wolf's and is their Queen. Old siblings rise from the dead, Esther returns, and even Mikael ""The Destroyer/  The Vampire who Kills Vampires""  is resurrected by the Witch Davina, she ""thinks she can control him."" A long lost Sibling is revealed and the Families ultimate enemy emerges as none other than their Aunt Dahlia. Great twists, mini stories within stories that make this a tremendous show.",1427068800,6,2106,4.929577464788732

6344517,5,B00J9C01W2,"Originally I was a bit skeptical about this show being that it only focuses on a small segment of the Vampire Diaries(TVD), namely the original family. I wondered how it could be any good without the main characters from TVD. I thought to myself, ""How is it even possible to write a captivating story with these characters which were cast as mostly static throughout TVD?"" Was there even enough acting talent present to carry a series?

Nevertheless, I gave the first few episodes a shot. ""Well done!"", I thought after watching the first episode and quickly forgetting about all of my previous concerns.

I must say that Joseph Morgan (Klaus) unleashes a level of outstanding acting that I had no idea he was capable of. I just had to see more, so I continued watching the series. Over time I came to realize that other characters I previously considered to be quite static in TVD were also actually cast as dynamic characters in this series.

The character development far outweighs TVD. If you think that after seeing the TVD you know everything there is to know about the original family, I assure you that you are wrong. I was wrong. One thing I've learned from this series is that no matter how cruel a person may be, there is usually a story behind how they came to be that way.

Prior to seeing the Originals, The Vampire Diaries was my favorite series. Now I am proud to say that TVD has been bumped to the #2 spot as the Originals is now my favorite series.

Watch the first few episodes, if you do not become hooked then I regret to inform you that you do not know a great show when you see one. ;)",1424995200,2,1608,4.437288135593221

6344519,5,B00J9C01W2,"It just gets better and better. It's funny though how it surpassed The Vampire Diaries in a lot of dimensions. First, TVD is more on love here and there and just about everywhere. Every time. It's great, I watch it too, but I sometimes get bored. I'm like, ""When does this cycle ever end?"" Whose parent is gonna die next? Whose going to turn into a vampire next? Whose parent is making a comeback next,,,etc. It's like Gossip Girl with a deliciously dark twist. No mattah, I still like it anyway.  The Originals, however is a big picture of twists and turns here and there. It's more of suspenseful and more looking forward to because of the fast-paced turnaround of events. I like the flashabcks and all the history here and there. It keeps me very interested and hooked. If you like The Originals as much as I do you will also feel annoyed at how every episode is cut short. It gives you a gist of what will happen next and you will feel the next 6 days as slow-moving as is it can be. I hope they never stop producing this, pretty, pretty please!",1424822400,,1049,4.3520408163265305

6345138,5,B00J9C01W2,"Season two of The Originals has been an absolute treat and fantastic television. Having reached the mid-season finale, the story of the original family, down to their beginnings over a thousand years ago, has been exactly what I was looking for when this Vampire Diaries spin-off was announced. Old characters, long dead, are back and in new bodies, which was a definite risk considering the loyalty to the actors who created the characters. But, it has worked just fine, especially when you throw in the numerous flashbacks, resulting in a very nice balance of new and old.

Add in the nice, but subtle, character development of the show's main characters, most especially Klaus and this definitely makes this must see TV!",1418256000,,723,4.975206611570248

6345376,5,B00J9C01W2,"The relationship of The Originals to The Vampire Diaries is similar to the relationship of Angel to the TV series Buffy The Vampire Slayer. In other words, it's a spinoff that's a bit more adult-oriented than the teen shows they were spun off from. Well-defined, interesting characters propel this interesting drama and each episode leaves you wanting to see more. As in the movie Angel Heart, New Orleans makes a wonderful setting for a creepy drama that features not just the vampire main characters, but their friend and enemies among the local witches and werewolves.",1416441600,,571,5.021052631578947

6345413,4,B00J9C01W2,"I like it. I don't care for the original series it spun off from. I really like Klaus, though. He's darker than Nick Knight (Forever Knight.) His demons are a lot stronger than Mick St. John (Moonlight.) The dialogue and the plots have definite teen-audience vibes. But the target market oddly offers more plot and less adult material then a lot of shows/movies out today. The main characters are adults, for the most part.

(SPOILER): Do to a loophole, in magic and creatures and whatnot, a werewolf is pregnant by a vampire. (That comes out within a few minutes. Its the major plot for the first season.) A thousand year old vampire, whose lost the last shred of his Humanity is faced with an impossible situation.

The past and the present collide, as is typical in vampire settings. Vampires are often faced, in various tv shows, with threats to a loved one. What would a vampire, capable of the unthinkable, do to save his child? And would be crazy enough to risk his wrath?",1416268800,,979,4.620689655172414

The acting and parts of the script can be overly dramatic with extended pauses to build tensionsometimes I can say the next line in the script before the actor doesbut overall the series is good and a nice way to alter your reality.

6345525,1,B00J9C01W2,"The first episode was a bit dry, at least a third or even halfway through. The plot moves so slowly, the actors move slowly, they speak slowly, even the fights are very slow. I am not sure what the director is trying to portray by creating this episode with such a sense of weariness about it. Are we to share in the weariness of Klaus and his brother as they endure their self-imposed exile? Maybe so, as the pace does begin to pick up once they decide to come out into the world again. It was an important episode in that it sets the stage for the rest of the season, but jeez, it is yawningly dull for a good chunk of the show.",1414886400,,630,4.088709677419355

6345565,4,B00J9C01W2,"The immortality of the vampire is a compelling component that has so many possibilities for a story line.
These characters have a hearty dash of Shakespearean sensibility. The twists and turns within the plots, the fine gray line between good and evil.. The concept of does the ends justify the means,  and the power struggles between factions for control of the city, along with an extraordinary sense of family drives the show.  Werewolves, Witches Vampires...
How can we love these evil blood thirsty demons? What compels us to keep watching.. We keep hoping that Klaus will reform, we see that spark of humanity seep through to the surface..his flaws are glaring, and his weaknesses for certain fair haired women make him a complex character who after a thousand years still has a lot to learn.
And what will happen next to the elegant and noble Elijah, will he find a heartbeat to share his depth of cool passion?
I hope Rebekah comes back.. There's lots more, keep it coming....season 2",1414368000,4,992,4.829411764705882

6345624,4,B00J9C01W2,"This first episode picked up at a good point in the story line.  It did not take us too far away from what happened in last season.  My only complaint would be the demise of one primary enemy from last season so quickly.  It would have been nice to see the affect the Guerra family had on the city.  Be that as it may, I was very happy to see the motherly side of Rebekah.  I always felt that she would be good at it.  Plus, it is always a thrill to see Elijah in action.  He does not play the radio!  I am now waiting to see a fully recharged Klaus make a return.  I like that the writers showed that even Klaus, someone old and seemingly invincible, can still have the wool pulled over his eyes.  But I do miss his swagger.

I have one question.  How is it that Kol is able to be here in this series?  I thought that he was destroyed when the ""other side"" collapsed in TVD.  If someone has an explanation, please explain it to me.",1413417600,2,932,3.994565217391304
