6516787,5,B00LYY75M2,"I grew up watching adam 12 & emergency. Loved both of them. Glad to see them released on DVD. I can't get channels on tv to watch it. It was a fore runner of the police shows we watch today ( NCIS.NYC 22, Blue Bloods, etc.)",1343606400,3,223,3.869565217391304
6516788,4,B00LYY75M2,"Adam 12 is a great TV Classic from my days of youth! Our kids love this show - it was the Father of CHiPs and SWAT and the Grandfather of today's NCIS shows! The one negative note is that I bought this thinking it was the complete Season 1 of the TV show - however to my great dissapointment it only had selected episodes from Season 1 and was not the entire season. That point could have been made more clear in the product description, Elsewise, it a great addition to your TV show library and a slice of history of the ""Good ole' Days"" when you could enjoy drama on TV without the unnecessary CSI blood, gore, sex and profanity!",1336348800,5,631,4.223140495867769
6516789,5,B00LYY75M2,"I love the show. It does make Dragnet seem like a lot of fun, tho'. Without the Harry Morgan character, it doesn't have the same comic element as that show. Great 60's time capsule and, like Dragnet, it has some important messages about life.",1312588800,,242,4.5227272727272725

6516805,5,B00LYY75M2,"THE WAY TV SHOULD BE!  Heroes of the highest caliber!  Friends as well as partners!  Life stands still for me for a little while as I watch my favorite guys solve crime!  TV is hardly worth watching except for just a handful like Blue Bloods. NCIS, and NCIS Los Angeles.  Thank God for Martin Milner and Kent McCord as they were my Guardian Angels growing up!  I would recommend these to everybody!",1404604800,3,398,4.458333333333333
6516806,5,B00LYY75M2,"Like Dragnet 1968 (which I also purchased), this DVD brings back memories of watching Adam-12 when I was a kid. It may not have all the special effects, blood and guts of current cop shows, but it does show the procedures and professionalism expected and performed by the Los Angeles P.D. in the time-frame it was made (late 1960s early 1970s). I also watch Adam-12 episodes on ME-TV, and think I've watched more of them recently than when I did as a kid. These episodes remind me of some of the police novels by Joseph Wambaugh (like the book ""the New Centurions""). Its a good DVD.",1395619200,4,582,4.5
6516807,4,B00LYY75M2,"We really enjoy the old Adam 12 shows.  We look for the old show that are decent compared to the trash that
they put in shows today.  We would recommend Adam 12 if you want to stay away from the filth of today.",1383350400,7,210,3.86046511627907
6516808,5,B00LYY75M2,"These are good episodes, good stories, all under the eyes of Jack Webb, who wrote or directed most the stories. Back to the
Dragnet days.  TOM",1371427200,3,142,4.461538461538462
6516809,5,B00LYY75M2,it was a great dvd to watch the price of this dvd was great I like the older tv show that out on dvd,1365379200,3,100,3.2083333333333335
6516810,1,B00LYY75M2,"This is yet another attempt at getting you to pay a fantastic price for what only LOOKS like an entire season of a great show (1968) when actually you're only getting TEN episodes. In my opinion this is even worse than the rip-off artists that sell great series (Perry Mason, Mod Squad etc.) at only half a season at a time (+ 3x shipping) expecting you to pay three or four times the normal priced complete season to get them.",1362873600,3,427,4.35

8669133,3,B00LYY75M2,"Season 1, ??? It did not have the pilot, where the two meet.  Other than that, the dvd is very clear.",1504224000,,101,3.8095238095238093
8669134,5,B00LYY75M2,"Grew up watching this show, this DVD which is what TV is missing today.  No special effects, no nudity, no guts or gore, no foul language.  It is just good ole' classic TV at its finest which is what is REALLY missing on television in the 21st century!  I miss ME-TV for it is not available in our area of the USA and since this television show came out in the 1960s it is perfect representation of what police officers who uphold the law should represent.  TV is hardly worth watching except for just a handful of shows on like NCIS, NCIS Los Angeles and Blue Bloods.  I would recommend this classic to those who want to watch TV without the prescription drug commercials interruptions, every 5 minutes on TV.",1490745600,2,710,4.430769230769231

8669137,3,B00LYY75M2,"I enjoyed 1st two episodes but after that, it was downright boring.  no chance to really develop a plot.  however, must keep in mind this is early crime episodes.",1484697600,,162,4.551724137931035

8669139,1,B00LYY75M2,It's not really for kids. The episodes that we watched talked about rape & serial killers. There may be some episodes that were more kid friendly but we didn't get that far. I turned it off. I'm giving the DVD away.,1475971200,,215,4.2682926829268295
8669140,5,B00LYY75M2,I love the episodes but I do not like the company that made the DVDs. I wish another company would make the Adam-12 DVDs. I have had trouble the not being able to get all of the episodes to play.,1471996800,,195,3.9
