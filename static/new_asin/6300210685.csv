257610,5,6300210685,"Years after I saw the ""Spy Smasher"" video, I found a reprint of one of the comic books that inspired it. To my surprise, the comic wasn't that good. Republic improved the character vastly, even giving us two  heroes for one (Kane Richmond, an earlier hero of one of the worst serials  ever made, ""The Lost City,"" redeems himself playing twins in what  is arguably the best serial of all time). Direction by that unsung titan of  action film, William Witney, and spectacular stunts by the likes of David  Sharpe and Tom Steele don't hurt, either.",958003200,28,545,4.635416666666667

In 1942 I saw the chapter that Spy Smasher is about to be torpedoed and guess what: the dictator of Brazil, my country, prohibited admission for children  in the movie theatres and I waited up to 1951 to review it. In 1966 I  rented it from MGM in 16 mm but shortly after they expired the licence and  destroyed the copy.  Kane  Richmond is the best good guy ever. As bad guy I elect Anthony Warde and as  bad girl Carol Forman, good girl is Kay Aldrich and the four best serials  are: 1-Spy Smasher, 2-The adventures of Captain Marvel, 3-Perils of  Nyoka,4- The Black Widow.

257612,5,6300210685,"I agree with the previous reviewer: the greatest serial ever made! I was 6 or 7 when I first saw it, in a small town outside Buenos Aires, in 1943 or 1944 while Europe was being demolished during WWII.
Every Tuesday my  ""gang"" made up of rascals of my age, ran back from school to the  small theater around the corner were we paid 10 cents to see the next  chapter. We were not afraid of going without our parents; no child molesters  in those times. The 'gang' itself was a very pacific bunch.
We roared  every time Spy Smasher won over the spies, and went home happy but anxious  to see the following week how the hero would escape the flames.
The  outfit the reviewer from South Bend found hillarious, we at 'the gang'  found AWESOME!!  This was for us ""the greatest movie ever"". I  kept it all these years in that fantasy corner that all we adults keep  hidden in our busy brains.
I am now 62, and I have seen most of the  great masterpieces, from ""Gold Rush"" and ""City Lights""  to ""La vita e bella""; but I never forgot Spy Smasher (in  Spanish:""El Terror de los Espias"").  I recently found it at  Amazon, bought it, and finally, after 57 years,saw it again.  Believe me:  it was a rejuvenating experience, a wonderful trip down memory lane, and  with all respect due to the genius of George Lucas, I would never trade  ""Spy Smasher"" for all the computerized ""Star Wars"" in  the world...",927504000,9,1391,4.376470588235295

7806320,5,6300210685,"The Fawcett Comics wartime hero comes alive in this landmark Republic serial. From a technical standpoint, ""Spy Smasher"" (1942) remains the greatest chapterplay of all time. Propelled by William Witney's vigorous direction, the 12-episode tour de force showcases impressive stunt work from Dave Sharpe, the Lydecker Brothers' masterful special effects, and Mort Glickman's rousing score. Kane Richmond delivers the performance of his career in the title role (he also plays the crime fighter's twin brother), with Tristram Coffin supplying traditional villainy. Decades later, the cliffhanging scenarios in ""Spy Smasher"" are a pleasure to behold. Republic's thrill-a-minute classic deserves a legitimate DVD release.",1258502400,2,716,6.029411764705882
7806321,5,6300210685,"The old-time movie serials should never be judged by the same criteria of other films, even those made at the same time period.  The serials were invariably outrageous, over-the-top, often ridiculous.  But unlike Adam West's `Batman' the serials were never self-conscious or deliberately campy. Although many serials featured a mildly humorous characters such as Jimmy Olsen or Whitey Whitney to provide occasional comic relief, on the whole, the actors and directors played everything straight and extremely earnest, no matter how absurd the situation or the scene.  They did their best at every test.

The old movie serials were made with practically zero budget and at a forced-march pace, shooting in two days what would take 6 months under modern conditions.  Those factors, combined with the primitive special effects then available and outdated cinematic conventions, give movie serials a look and feel unlike anything made in the last 52 years.

The final thing a modern person should know before watching an old serial is that 1940's movies had a more realistic vision of the male body than modern Hollywood.  The men of this era had survived the depression (and later, WWII).  When they were hungry, they ate meat and potatoes.  The tough guys of this period lifted barbells and did push-ups, but they didn't have Soloflex, Nautilus, implants or steroids.  Think about the last time you went to the beach: how many real world guys were built like Daniel Craig?

In summary, it is best to watch the old serials from the perspective that you are looking at some kind of alternate reality, so as to suspend some of the prejudices of the modern cinema.  Or perhaps as though one were a tourist in a foreign country: rather than seeing the differences as bizarre or deficient, but instead as being novel, interesting, and sometimes wondrous.

I have seen about 11 serials in my life, and `Spy Smasher' is hands-down the best.  Kane Richmond made an excellent hero and pulled off the double (or is it triple?) role very nicely.  The action is well-paced, the special effects and sets, are, by serial standards, excellent.  The fight scenes, cliff-hangers, and escapes are all the absolute best I have seen in any serial.  The creativity and ingenuity used to choreograph the fight scenes are truly wondrous.  If you are familiar with the `Indiana Jones' films, you can literally see numerous instances where Spielberg borrowed and extrapolated from Spy Smasher.

And although the fight scenes are masterfully choreographed and have great stunt-work, they are much more plausible (therefore more interesting) than the kind of CGI/steroid-assisted stuff you see in modern action movie, in which human beings no longer seem bound by any biological or physical limits, being instead endowed with the powers of a video game.

There are a number of dramatic surprises as well, including some understatedly somber moments.  Without spoiling too much, I will say that mortality is a factor.

The opening credits to each chapter, which feature the Morse Code signal for Victory, the opening notes of Beethoven's 5th, and an image of searchlights crossing the sky, accurately evoke the Churchill/Roosevelt mentality of the dark early days of WWII, the summoning up of righteous courage.  This undercurrent of the real war, the outcome of which could not yet be known, gives Spy Smasher a resonance not found in other serials.  But despite the influence of the historical moment, Spy Smasher is still predominately an escapist joy ride.  Which is a good thing.",1201219200,9,3553,5.084482758620689

7806323,5,6300210685,"This must have the most exciting first chapter of all time.  It doesn't waste time with exposition but gets right into the action with two or three jaw-droppers right off the bat.  And it never lets up in a single chapter.  William Witney, easily the all-time best serial director, really outdoes himself here, even without his long-time associate Jack English.  Maybe this was his going-away present to serial fans as he had enlisted in the Navy and was waiting to be called up, or maybe he was getting his licks in on the Germans before he left.  He lets it all hang out here, that's for sure.  As soon as we think we know where he's headed, we don't.  He eschews cliches and constantly surprises us.  When we think a cliffhanger is imminent, it isn't.  And the cliffhangers are just terrific.  The fire chasing Spy Smasher as he races through the tunnel on a hand-car at the end of Chapter One is a classic, as is the way he deals with it.  And Chapter Two.  And Chapter Three.  I could go on.  They're imaginative and clever, and they leave you truly wondering how in the world he's going to get out of this one.

""Spy Smasher"" was yet another comic book hero brought to life in the serials.  Republic didn't pay the big bucks necessary to obtain the rights to the most popular ones, so it didn't get the big names like ""Superman,"" ""Batman,"" et al; it just did a much better job with the ones it did bring to the screen than Universal or Columbia did.  This has great camera work by Witney's long-time cinematographer Reggie Lanning, and Mort Glickman's music is also terrific, including his lively treatment of Beethoven's Fifth (which was the musical symbol for Allied victory in WWII) at the beginning and end of each chapter.  Howard Lydecker is better than ever with his special effects miniaturization.  As usual Witney has Davy Sharpe doing the brunt of the stunt work, and Davy is elegant in the fight scenes with his flying leaps and efficient dispatching of the enemy.  His athleticism is amazing to watch.  The fight in the wine cellar at the Acme Cafe at the end of the first chapter is a wonderful portent of things to come, such as Chapter Eight where he takes on four opponents in a warehouse and bests them all through sheer cleverness.

Kane Richmond has the ironic distinction of having starred in the best (this one) and worst (""The Lost City,"" 1935) serials of all time.  He's just about perfect here in the dual role of Allen Armstrong, the dashing, cape-clad Spy Smasher, and his twin brother Jack (another irony, as ""Jack Armstrong"" was mediocre at best), and manages to give each brother a slightly different air.  Richmond starred in many B-movies in the 1930's and 40's, including several ""Green Hornet"" films (but not the serial).  He retired from acting in 1948, then went on to make a fortune in the fashion business.

Marguerite Chapman (1918-1999) was a discovery of Howard Hughes.  As a younger variation of the boozy broad character usually portrayed by Claire Trevor, she worked steadily at 20th Century Fox, Warner Brothers, and especially Columbia.  She popped up all over the place in the first decade of television, and for her TV work she is recognized in the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Sam Flint played lots of doctors and fatherly types in his career, and he's very good as the heroine's father, Admiral Corby.  Hans Schumann, born in Stuttgart, was in great demand during the War for his German accent and fierce looks, and he's a fine villain as The Mask.  Tristram Coffin as Drake, a TV broadcaster (yes, TV in 1942!) who's actually one of the spies, adds to his long career in which he appeared in hundreds of movies (including ""Nyoka and the Tigermen."")  All three were excellent character actors for many years, and are used to good advantage here.

A couple of other things to look for:  Notice how clevery Witney has a double fill in for one of the brothers when both are in the same scene, so that each one looks exactly like Kane Richmond, never more effectively than in Chapter 9 when they're riding on a motorcycle together.  Also in Chapter 9, look for the fake billboard that advertises another of Witney's serials, ""Dick Tracy vs. Crime, Inc.""!

If this isn't the best serial ever made, I don't know what is.  Everything comes together to make one terrific serial that even manages a message beyond simply good versus evil:  Self-sacrifice for a higher cause.",1136592000,19,4417,4.658914728682171
7806324,5,6300210685,"Okay, CITIZEN KANE this is not, but among serials, THE SPY SMASHER deserves its five3-star rating. It is arguably the very best of the serial adventures. Kane Richmond is very good in the role of twin brothers, and the Second World War backdrop is effective. I first saw this cut and re-patched as THE SPY SMASHER RETURNS on TV in New York when I was a kid. I loved it then, but this version is much better. It keeps the original serial format, and its production values (again, for a serial) are quite good. The Mask is a bit of an inconsistent villain, but Nazis make great bad guys. The fight scenes are terrific (not only for serials, but for all films of this era). Wonderful choreography and very exciting. It will definitely bring out the excited little kid in you.",1053561600,7,772,4.4822695035460995

7806327,5,6300210685,"As noted by others, it's the stunt action that really makes this one of the very best of all serials.  The fight scenes are incredibly choreographed.  I especially enjoyed the fight in the second chapter, where one of the good guys who has his hands tied behind him still gets into the fight and does quite well for himself even without the use of arms and hands.  An added touch that makes this serial special is the irony of the similarity of the ending of chapters 2 and 11, and subsequent resolvings in 3 and 12.  Oh yes, did you notice the clever plug for another Republic serial, DICK TRACY VS CRIME, INC., in Chapter 9?",993772800,2,626,4.370689655172414
