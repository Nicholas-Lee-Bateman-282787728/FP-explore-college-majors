The action makes it worth the low price, but their really was no there there. What was the deal with Mac ""the Maniac"" soldier? Why did they not show the completion of Hutch's fight with the railway goliath? One minute they are fighting and the next Hutch joins his compatriots on the empty train. If we have a nuclear menace, then it always helps if he enacts some major destruction in the beginning of the movie to enhance the threat. Too many times I was asking who was shooting at who? Decent action movie, but why? Loved the ending though-the tension build up and the sadness.",1237680000,,691,4.492063492063492
