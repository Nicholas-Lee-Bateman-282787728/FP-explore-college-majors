6425215,5,B00KGFGJGS,Buy it for the laughs at how bad it it...what a horrible DVD.,1409788800,2,61,3.769230769230769
6425216,1,B00KGFGJGS,"This DVD shouldn't be sold -- period.  What a boondoggle.  It's so laughingly terrible on every possible level, it has to be seen to be believed. Imagine the worst concert bootleg you've ever watched. This is worse.

In reality, it's not a documentary at all, but poor-quality snippets of concert footage, mostly of relatively recent vintage.  The two short interviews with Donald Fagan and Denny Dias (where's Walter Becker?) look as if they were shot on and iPhone by a jittery child.  More importantly, the interviews shed no light on the group or its history, much less tell, ""The Story of Steely Dan.""

Shame on both the ""documentarians"" and on Amazon for peddling this tripe.  Zero stars.",1409702400,14,694,4.880341880341881
6425217,1,B00KGFGJGS,"Looks as though this was edited by some elementary school kid.  Says in disclaimer ""unauthorized documentary"", no sh$@ Sherlock, if the ""Dan"" saw this crap, they would have a coronary. Don't waste your money. SHAME ON YOU AMAZON!",1409616000,6,229,5.026315789473684
6425218,1,B00KGFGJGS,"This is overrated at one star and calling it the worst DVD of all time is being kind.  The two ""interviews"" look like 6th grade projects, and the live clips seem to be 5th generation video tape, shot by a ten year old, with the sound quality of  a 50's portable AM radio speaker. AVOID!!!",1409529600,13,288,4.218181818181818
6425219,1,B00KGFGJGS,"I couldn't agree with Karen more. Whoever made this should be ashamed of themselves. Here's what you get: a small handful of live videos in the worst, blurriest, horrible quality possible. There are no real or professional people that put this piece of garbage together. It looks exactly as if some teenager copied a few very poor quality VHS taped songs, grabbed a couple of brief and almost inaudible interview snippets from youtube, and shoved it in a box. They're right...there is NO documentary, NO behind the scenes anything! Horrible editing by an amateur trying out some cheap movie-make program for the first time. The box says it's 45 minutes. I should have known right then and there that this couldn't be worth a dime, as no one could tell a true Steely Dan history, with proper interviews, etc... in less than 2 hours. It's actually just shy of 41 mins. I've seen 7 year old's make better home movies than these morons. It's worse than the worst bootleg videos I've ever seen. You name it, it stinks. Video, audio, content, length, even the menu is total crap. Trust me, I love music artist documentaries, and some are incredibly compiled, etc... this is by far THE WORST. DO NOT BUY THIS!! I'm going to try to see if Amazon will let me return it; given the tons of cash I've spent in here in the last few months. But if not, I would have been far better off to take a $20 bill and use it to wipe you know what!! In case you can't tell, I'm really angry. This DVD was put out by LASER MEDIA, licensed by MOONLIGHT AND PARTNERS. Check your DVD's before buying, and if you see these folks affiliated with it...Do Not Buy It!!!",1409356800,24,1637,4.478260869565218
6425220,1,B00KGFGJGS,"This was the biggest waste of money. This was no documentary worth purchasing. Whoever made this mess did a great job of it. Video quality...terrible, sound quality....terrible. The story of Steely Dan was no story at all other than a few bad clips of concerts. This was the worst purchase I have ever made. I'm just sorry I opened it. Terrible disappointment.",1409270400,18,360,4.82258064516129
6425221,1,B00KGFGJGS,"Worst piece of crap I've ever seen on any great band. If Steely Dan is associated with it in any way, they should be ashamed. And, Amazon should be ashamed for selling it. I wish I could give it zero stars, or even a negative number of stars. Don't buy this junk!",1413158400,,263,4.076923076923077

6425224,1,B00KGFGJGS,"Dreadful

This is snippets in poor quality of official releases (midnight special and Two Against Nature)
Terrible vocal sync. Excerpts from poor copies of several post 2000 live video bootlegs.
This is not official product, avoid at all cost",1411776000,,242,5.205128205128205
6425225,1,B00KGFGJGS,This is complete crap!!! Total waste of money. Junk. Garbage. The other reviewers are right. I agree 100%.,1411257600,,106,4.944444444444445
6425226,1,B00KGFGJGS,"This was not worth eighteen dollars, it was not worth eight dollars.  Walter and Donald should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this to be produced.  Amazon should take it off the market and give everyone a refund.",1410739200,,219,4.7368421052631575
6425227,1,B00KGFGJGS,"Abysmal in every way ! There is one very short interview with Fagen which I've seen on YouTube where he talks about his book 'Eminent Hipsters' ? An interview with one time Steely Dan guitarist Denny Dias which I've also seen on YouTube that doesn't even mention Steely Dan ? The rest is live footage captured straight from YouTube that is all astonishingly bad quality. No story, No behind the scene footage, as promised in the DVD notes ! It's a bootleg DVD of the worst kind ! No way did they license any of this footage, the fly by night company that put this out should be sued ! I'm reporting this to Amazon then to Warner Brothers, 'Laser Media' aren't gonna get away with this, I'm gonna make sure of that !",1410393600,10,715,4.343283582089552
6425228,1,B00KGFGJGS,"Agree with all previous observations and comments, this is simply awful.  I was really surprised on how bad this really was.  I was expecting it to be about the group, their lives as members of the band and their music and of course typical DVD quality.  It was none of that and even less.  Definitely no where close to being worth the price of a blank DVD.",1410393600,6,357,4.2835820895522385
6425229,1,B00KGFGJGS,Agree with all the other reviewers. Zero stars for this one. A truly shameful release. Donald and Walter should bring charges against the makers of this dreck.,1410048000,,159,4.925925925925926
6425230,1,B00KGFGJGS,"If you are expecting a professional documentary on the history of Steely Dan, this is not the DVD for you.  This is a loosely edited collection of clips.  It does include an interview with Donald Fagen that appears to have been taken with a phone (audio and video).  The concert clips are collected randomly over the history of the band.  This is not the Steely Dan equivalent of the Doobie Brother's ""Let the Music Play"" documentary.",1409875200,7,434,4.671052631578948

8658338,1,B00KGFGJGS,"Total rip off. Donnie's done it again - putting out crap like this and ""Eminent Hipsters"" - he should be ashamed of himself. But he's likely just smerking as he deposits his royalties check. Have some integrity Donnie and refund your fans of the music their money. And STOP putting out garbage.",1424736000,,294,4.673076923076923

8658340,1,B00KGFGJGS,"Its a crock of s***, a few videos and nothing of substance as a documentary, I bought it and it was a waste of time and money,  I was ripped off.",1423440000,,145,3.6774193548387095
8658341,2,B00KGFGJGS,Not so good video quality or scenes,1422144000,,35,4.142857142857143
8658342,1,B00KGFGJGS,"I received this dvd as a Christmas gift from my son. He's usually good about checking the reviews. I guess he either didn't check them or he ignored them because this material is totally a waste of money as every other review, save two, agrees. I feel bad giving this mess even one star! I wish I could give it no star at all. For a real documentary, where this dvd gets most of it's material, try looking for the Steely Dan ""Two Against Nature"" pbs show. It seems to be out of print any more, but there are still a few used ones floating around on Amazon.
As has been stated already, this is a bad attempt at a documentary. It looks like they pirated material off of YouTube. In fact you can find all of the material included in this dvd on YouTube and in better video quality.
DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT.",1421193600,,808,4.219354838709678

8658344,1,B00KGFGJGS,"I do not recommend this item. I bought it for my brother and it's really like a poorly done, homemade movie with bad edits, I think it's some kind of homemade bootleg thing with live footage, not great at all. Not sure how they got away with selling this junk.",1415923200,,260,4.22
8658345,1,B00KGFGJGS,"I was so embarrassed when my husband started laughing watching this DVD, it is so cheesy.  It's like someone's home movies of intervicews and concerts.  Hated it two thumbs down very disappointing..",1414108800,,198,5.15625
