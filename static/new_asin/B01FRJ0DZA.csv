hard on the joints with all the jumping, but so much fun!  I will just slow it down a little and not do it as much,
but, it's hard because it is so energizing and so fun!

Love it, try it!",1471392000,3,307,3.4558823529411766
7751637,5,B01FRJ0DZA,This is a fantastic workout.  Simone is a pleasant instructor and easy to follow.  She gets your heart pumping!  Includes 2 workouts.,1470787200,2,133,4.954545454545454
7751638,5,B01FRJ0DZA,"I have not done a BBS workout before. I usually don't spend this much money on a workout dvd either. But I know her book and her workouts from what I have seen on videos. (examples from her website).  She's a great trainer. This workout is really not for the beginner. It's not even for those who are at moderate level. The cardio dance sections are paced quite fast so  the cues she gives you are basically try to keep up, but don't stop, just keep moving. Meaning do what you can at the pace you can.  Your heart rate will be jacked up.
This one has both a cardio workout at 55 MINS!! (!!!)  and another sculpting + cardio at 55 Mins (!!!)  So this is almost 2 hours of serious work. I have had this dvd one week and it's kicking my butt...... but in a good way. I am challenged and I am sweating but I am loving it. Simone knows what she is doing. You will see results with this dvd. Just start slowly and work into it.",1469318400,15,922,4.043956043956044

Both classes are challenging, the Dance Cardio is a little harder than Full Body due to choreography, but you will be drenched in sweat when it's over. Simone is so energetic and fun to workout with.

Finally a workout dvd that is actually fun! Simone makes working out a fun experience instead of a chore. The routines are easy to follow,  the exercises are super challenging and  I love that it can still be done at home or on my computer when I'm traveling.

7751652,3,B01FRJ0DZA,"Just FYI and contrary to claims on the packaging, the choreography in this video is NOT easy.

This review is only for the cardio dance section of the video - I haven't done the total body workout yet. I received this video yesterday and popped it in this morning. I really hoped this would be a fun and challenging way to add some cardio to my workouts without using the treadmill. I have some dance background and have taken many many cardio classes over the years and own many workout DVD's and this is maybe the most aggravating workout I've ever come across.

There are, I think, 4 dance sequences in all. The video goes straight into a warm up with very little cueing and then you do one sequence of dance moves, then another sequence of dance moves. There's a break for some standing work, then back into two more dance sequences then you do all of them together followed by some ab work and a cool down.

Simone, the instructor, is perky and pleasant but she does almost no cueing. She often changes the moves she is doing with no warning.

There is no explanation or preview of any of the moves. She just goes right into them and you, sweating and cursing, try to follow along. These are moves with fairly complicated choreography and there is absolutely no effort to teach the move prior to the sets.

A couple of times she says ""again!"" and does something completely new.

Often the camera is trained on the faces of the people in the video so that you cannot see what moves they are actually doing.

She often wants you to improvise your own arm movements.

The sequences are very fast paced. Very fast. At one point Simone teaches you some arm choreography nice and slowly and I thought, ""Oh, good, I can probably learn these moves,"" and then she sped it up to where you are doing these complicated arm moves super fast and then she adds the foot moves without any explanation and you're off again, trying to keep up. By the time we got to the last sequence, where you put together all 4 dances you have ""learned"" I was actively angry.

The other thing to point out is that a big part of the dances are basically just jumping. You are jumping up and down constantly so if you have any injuries or are incapable of jumping, this video is not for you.

This is definitely a workout and if you want to sweat this will do it.  If you can manage to figure out all the steps and put it together smoothly I imagine this would be a fantastic cardio workout. But there is a steep learning curve and I really wish the cueing was there and that the moves were taught slowly before going at breakneck pace.

I did like her ab work quite a lot - standing abs and some planking with light weights.

I'll probably keep this video in my rotation for a while and hopefully it will get easier to do the moves.",1500336000,27,2804,4.338432122370937
7751653,5,B01FRJ0DZA,"In my 30 plus collection of various workout DVDs, this is by far the best! Challenging yet doable. No frustrating footwork or awkward positions so you can just concentrate on getting great cardio. Simone is also excellent at cueing.",1499817600,,232,4.9743589743589745
7751654,1,B01FRJ0DZA,I bought this video but received hips bun and thighs.,1498262400,,53,4.4
7751655,5,B01FRJ0DZA,"I have had this DVD for months but I just tried it today. Honestly, it was very very challenging and definitely an advanced workout however, I feel so great after doing it. I truly feel like I did work and burned calories. I recommend stretching on your own before and after because there are a lot of explosive moves. Also, if you have bad knees like I do just be aware of making soft landings with all the jumping and hopping. I plan on alternating this (4x a week) with Leslie Sansone's 4 Fast Miles (2x a weeks - low impact cardio for bad knees) in addition to some more weight training (6x a week).

I'm on a mission to lose 20 lbs by the end of summer so I will post an update after a couple months of doing this but I'm confident that I will shed inches and pounds on this regime. Great workout! I'm honestly impressed because when i watched the dvd the first time she made it look so easy I wasn't sure it would be worth it - boy, was I wrong haha! I hope she makes more DVDs.",1496188800,,984,4.072164948453608

7751657,4,B01FRJ0DZA,Good workout but really hard to get through it the first time. Definitely should watch it once before trying. If you can't pick up choreography easily this might be too tough. Lots of jumping which can be hard on the knees.,1494633600,2,223,4.463414634146342
7751658,5,B01FRJ0DZA,"I have been doing the first half of the DVD once a week for three months now and it is moderately difficult for an intermediate workout person.  There is a 20 minute lower body workout that hurts so good and is unlike anything else that I have in my DVD collection.  After three months it literally lifted my butt over an inch!  Is it hard, oh yeah!  But it is sooooo worth it!  When you see the price for this DVD, remember you get two one-hour workouts, so it is actually quite a good price.  Give Simone a try.  She is sweet and encouraging, and the music makes you want to bring it to your workout.",1492387200,2,602,4.137931034482759

7751664,5,B01FRJ0DZA,One of the first of two dvds by Simone I've owned. This is one of my favorite go tos. I'd do it more often if I had more time. It's a complete cardio and toning in one in the full body routine. Love her workouts and her attitude. She's not a yeller or scolder forcing you through workouts like a lot of other instructors.

7751666,5,B01FRJ0DZA,"At first I thought buying this was a mistake due to how quickly she gets into the routines.. but I really wanted to try it out.  I absolutely love it.  I switch between the full body and the cardio dance sections and after buying over 2 weeks ago still so excited to do it again tomorrow!  So worth it!  I am not a dancer at all and trust me I am slowly able to catch up and am sure I look silly  but my heart rate is up  and I am sweating!
 If you want something different, fun, and want to see time fly then BUY this DVD!

One note is to  have patience the first few times.. its worth it.  As you get into the routines Simone does explain things... ! I feel great and with proper healthy diet I hope to see some great results!  I lost 20 pounds the last year with Billy Blanks and proper healthy eating ( not crazy dieting) and will continue to do both but this new dvd is worth the changes and hope to see great results!
Next goal- head to LA or NYC someday and do one of her classes LIVE...then again may be too shy for that!!",1488412800,6,1030,3.927536231884058
7751667,4,B01FRJ0DZA,"If you want very fast past with little instruction on how to do the moves, then this is the DVD for you.  If you continue to workout with it, you will eventually be able to keep up.  I do like the fact that there are two different workouts you can choose from. Both are fun, and yes, it will work. I will continue to workout with this DVD.  Just keep in mind, if you haven't worked out in awhile, you may want to consider something that has a slower pace. I would have given this a 5 star if there would have been more instruction on how to do the moves before you actually start the workout.",1487462400,2,592,4.042735042735043

7751670,3,B01FRJ0DZA,"I'm not a professional dancer by any means, but am very coordinated and pickup quickly.  This was super easy to learn, what I didn't like, and others may disagree, it was really dance, it was more hopping around everywhere.  Not the dancing style I prefer anyways.  I love Jennifer Galardi because of the hip hop style she brings, I'm 38 so I am not a teenager but I've always loved my hip hop style dancing.  Another thing I didn't like is the background was somewhat dreary, it shows a big window next to them and it was night time, so it was dark not bright pretty sunlight.  It is a good workout and some moves were fun but for the most part I do a routine for about 3 weeks before switching and I got bored with this one.  I will keep and throw back in the DVD when I feel like change",1484179200,6,789,4.124183006535947

I'm a bit out of shape, so I just was able to go through 3/4's of her Dance Cardio routine. And boy did it made me a sweaty mess!!! haha! I'm not much of a runner, but I do know it's a great exercise... still, I very much prefer to do Simone's Dance Cardio over running ANY DAY! Have yet to try the other part of the dvd, but I'm sure it will still kick my butt!
I do this on mondays, wednesdays and fridays... and complement my training with workouts from the Tone It Up girls.

7751675,1,B01FRJ0DZA,Not fun at all.  Plus Simone and the girls were in such heavy makeup that I felt like I was watching an old Robert Palmer video.  I couldn't follow the fast paced dance moves and definitely couldn't handle all of the jumping and plyometrics.,1476921600,2,241,4.454545454545454
7751676,4,B01FRJ0DZA,"Simone has a great body. However, I was hoping that her workout would be more unique. She is using the style of having you periodically raise your heart rate high with aerobics/plyometrics, then work your musces with small weights/high reps.

She has you jog in place and jump several times to get your heart rate up using high intensity in 3 segments in between the toning segments.",1476576000,5,383,4.7164179104477615

7751683,5,B01FRJ0DZA,"I really like this DVD.  You get two great workouts, and they are both varied and interesting enough to work well on any body, for quite awhile.  A few thoughts and a few criticisms:

Simone's workouts are definitely in the same general genre as Tracy Anderson and Anna Kaiser (and to some extent, Ballet Beautiful). If you love those ladies, you will like this. Of those three people (and especially in comparison to TA), Simone is by far the most motivational, pleasant, and fun, and the pace and cuing of her workouts are the best. I find the AKT video to be by far the most athletic/physically challenging of these three options/people, and Tracy to be in some ways the most effective but by far the most exhausting, boring, and hard on your body (she gave me a stress fracture and doing her workouts ""right"" takes hours!). Simone is a great inbetween - her workouts are dance based, utilize low-weight/body-weight, and focus on fluid long muscles, like Tracy, but without as many reps/weird positions, and with way more fun.

As for this video, both workouts are very good.  The Dance Cardio will leave even an advanced exerciser a sweaty, exhausted, mess. The moves are pretty complicated, but super fun, and the cuing is excellent - far better than TA. For people looking for a challenging but really fun dance-based, aerobic workout, this is it - five stars.

The full body class is good, but it could be better. The dance segment are all fun, effective, very well-cued, and more ""doable"" than the Dance Cardio segments. The strength segments are where I have a few complaints. The first arms section is okay, but the moves are super basic and the fact that you stand still and don't incorporate any cardio seems like a wasted opportunity to blast more calories. The legs section is much better, but I don't think it's challenging enough to do this class every day with consistent results. The core work is hard - definitely some challenge there to build on.

Overall, I really love Simone as a teacher, and will use this DVD a lot - in rotation with my Tracy Anderson Meta DVDs, my AKT DVD, and running. Both workouts are hard and leave your body feeling worked - but I wish the Full Body had more bang for the buck - when I finished it, my body felt pleasantly tired, but like it could have gone harder and longer.

***Edit: I have used this DVD consistently for five months and am now editing this review to give it five stars instead of four.  Everything I said in the initial review still pretty much holds true, and I've tweaked the workouts a bit to make them more challenging here and there, but I've generally just done these workouts consistently, 4-6 times a week for the past five months, and my body has changed. My arms are more defined and tight, my core is flatter (and my pants looser), and I have shed inches off my hips and thighs (I'm down a jeans size).  I'm pretty surprised as I didn't even intend this much change - it just seemed to happen!  Very happy to see these results and still enjoying these workouts, mixed in with a few others (and with my own music!).  Highly recommend and hope Simone comes out with more!",1471996800,107,3149,4.553982300884956

8761368,4,B01FRJ0DZA,It is definitely a very tough work out for beginners. It is very fast paced. Even the modifiers are difficult. But Simone has such a wonderful attitude and continually reminds the viewer to modify as needed and to take it easy as a beginner. She's great for not getting too down on oneself. I'd recommend wearing supportive shoes for ankles and joints as there's a lot of jumping and lateral movement. I would definitely recommend these videos but I think I need to get more in shape to work my way up to these videos haha. Also having ample space to do this workout is ideal.,1526515200,,576,4.443396226415095

8761370,5,B01FRJ0DZA,"I have discovered her recently, and I have lots of other DVDs. I am a big fan of all barre/dance workouts. I have it all bar method, physique57, tracey anderson, barre amped, tracey mallet and so on..She is like barre mixed with Tracy Anderson. I loved it so much that i became member of BBSTV. One thing I really like about her, she does not use cheesy motivational cues, she just leads the movement. That keeps her DVD's more fresh and less distracting. When teachers talk about daily life on a DVD, like how ""i am going to fit into my skinny jeans or how i look like hot"" DVD becomes an obsolete thing and i really don't need a fitness teacher to tell me how should i feel or what should i target . I just need to workout. She is right to the point, very good and objective teaching style.
