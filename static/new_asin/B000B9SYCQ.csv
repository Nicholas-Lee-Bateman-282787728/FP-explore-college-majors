8118790,4,B000B9SYCQ,My youngest son grew up watching this video and my oldest daughter reminded me of it and wanted to find it for her children.  So thankful I found it!!!,1415232000,2,151,4.206896551724138
8118791,5,B000B9SYCQ,"I owned this video in my very early childhood, but it quit working within a couple years of having it. I never thought I'd find it again, but lo and behold, it was on Amazon. I ordered it, and it came in a reasonable amount of time, and it was in very good condition. I only wish I had begun my search years ago. If you are Christian and have children or love kids' songs, then this is the tape for you.",1378425600,3,403,3.926829268292683
8118792,5,B000B9SYCQ,"I didn't know anything about this when I bought it, but it is really good. My kids love it, and ask for it all the time. Mother goose type songs are rewritten with Christian themes, like ""God gave us a special book"" to the tune of ""B.I.N.G.O."" The singing and choreography are well done. I even enjoy watching these with my kids (a rare find in products aimed at children).",1131494400,5,373,4.3428571428571425
