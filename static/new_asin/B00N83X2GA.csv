6612821,5,B00N83X2GA,"Slip, Sach, and the other ""Boy"" are out in full force in the 4 volume collection of all 48 Bowery Boys films.  I was weaned on these films and watched them on Sundays at noon on New York's WNEW channel 5.  The good news is that the films are just as much fun now as they were then.  You'll see just how terrific Leo Gorcey and Huntz Hall were as a comedy team, how the films went from film noir-ish melodramas to outright Stooges style slapstick.  Whether you grew up watching these films, or if you just love good old fashioned wise cracking fun...these volumes are for you.",1442275200,5,575,4.296296296296297

6612823,5,B00N83X2GA,"A whole lot of laughs. Good clean TV unlike the garbage on today like sex, profanity, and all other kinds of trash. There hardly is any good decent programming on TV anymore.",1432512000,7,174,4.46875
6612824,5,B00N83X2GA,"These B comedies may have thin predictable plots and rather corny humor, but if you're like me and loved them as a child on TV, this final set is a must. As with the previous set, the quality is excellent. Pure nostalgic fun!",1429142400,2,225,4.255813953488372
6612825,5,B00N83X2GA,love these movies from the 40's and the 50's the running time is around 69 minutes or less. these movies are a good escape for a short time from the troubles of today's world,1426118400,3,174,4.147058823529412
6612826,5,B00N83X2GA,This is a great DVD box set. Every fan of the Bowery Boys must buy this. Thank you for the fast service.,1424304000,,104,3.772727272727273
6612827,5,B00N83X2GA,I am a big fan of classic comedies and the Bowery Boys are the best!  My parent showed me their movies on TV when I was younger. I became a huge fan. I have waited several years no for them to be released on DVD and now they are released! They are full of laughs and if you never want to stop laughing you would enjoy these movies! I would recommend this series to everyone!,1420070400,,374,3.986666666666667

6612829,4,B00N83X2GA,"I really enjoy The Bowery Boys movies, but these are some of the weakest ones, although it was great to complete the set. The movies went down hill quickly after Leo Gorcey left and a few of these have Stanley Clements in them instead. As good as Huntz Hall was as ""Sach"", he just couldn't carry the movies without ""Slip"" (Leo Gorcey). But, if you're a fan you need to get these too.",1416614400,3,383,4.260273972602739

6612844,5,B00N83X2GA,I like the Bowery Boys a lot  and this is the fourth in what is clearly the definitive collection of Bowery Boys films. The quality of the films is remarkable high. Perhaps they did some restoration on them. I wouldn't be surprised if they did. The Bowery Boys themselves are a lot of fun if you don't mind a fair chunk of stupidity in your humor. But I've enjoyed the whole set. It's worth the cost.,1461456000,2,400,4.2631578947368425
6612845,3,B00N83X2GA,"Warning!  Do not watch any Bowery Boys movies without Leo Gorcy and Huntz Hall; you will be very disappointed.  And don't forget Louis Dumbrowski (Bernard Gorcy), owner of  "":Louie's Sweet Shop,""  where the guys hang out.  Despite all the  jokes and wise cracks about Monogram Pictures (later renamed ""Allied Artists,"" presumably a classier name  for a studio), many of these films are quite entertaining.  The formula is usually the same.  The boys witness a murder or some other crime and wind up taking on the Mob, and amazingly, winning.  You've got to love the way Leo Gorcy mangles the English language, while his buddy Huntz Hall, playing the village idiot (he was actually quite intelligent), drives him crazy.  Then there's Louie, who has a love/hate relationship with the gang, sometimes calling them ""my boys,"" and at other times referring to them as ""those hoodlums.""  The quality of the films varies, and some I wouldn't  watch more than once, but overall you will be entertained.",1457568000,,993,4.9817073170731705

As I go through and watch the films, I'm reliving the fun that I had growing up and watching the Bowery Boys every Sunday morning on WCCO TV in the Twin Cities.  Also this set contains my personal favorite film: ""Mr. Hex"".  How could it get any better than that?",1530489600,,319,4.112903225806452
