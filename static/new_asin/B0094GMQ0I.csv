8535886,5,B0094GMQ0I,"Visually, this movie is stunning - the cinematography is excellent and really captures the mountains and glaciers in all their grandeur. But this documentary is first and foremost about its human subjects. The film follows mountaineer Ruedi Beglinger and his family in the wake of a catastrophic avalanche. The imposing and awe-inspiring scenery never detracts from the intimacy with which the family life of the Beglingers is portrayed. It is the unique life of the Beglinger family that makes this documentary such a memorable exploration of the often-tumultuous relationship between people and the environment.",1374451200,,613,5.531914893617022
