1390496,4,B000053V6H,"The first time I did this work-out I was barely sweating.  I was more focused on learning the routine than making it difficult.  I've found that the better I know the routine, the more intense I can make it by having tighter movements and getting into the routine more.  Also, someone looking for a harder, more intense work out should try the extended work out on the dvd.  The extended workout goes through the warm-up, teaching and cardio work-out twice, and then the cool down.  This is opposed to one segment of cardio.  Amy drives me nuts, she's definetly not a dancer.  The rest of the people in the video are good at what they do and help keep you pumped up.  It seems like Allan doesn't give enough directions at first, but you'll appreciate that when you know the routine by heart.",1031011200,,791,4.4825174825174825
1390497,2,B000053V6H,"This is a good tape to own if you are into contemporary music, and want some variety in your collection.  Although the sound quality is poor, the music is really fun and it is well choreographed.  Once you get the hang of the moves (trust me, if I can do it, ANYONE can) it is an easy and fun routine that I look forward to doing.  However, it isn't very challenging and wouldn't be suitable for all fitness levels.  And Amy Acuff, who is supposed to be the main attraction, is not that great.  She is so uncoordinated and confused me when she was on the screen.  Stick to the high-jump Amy!  She is the reason I gave this tape a 2.",1010448000,,632,4.131147540983607
1390498,2,B000053V6H,"Ok I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 because, if you can ignore everything else and put some effort into it, the actual workout does get your heartrate up and gets you a little sweaty. But (where do I begin??) this is a kickboxing workout, and if you haven't done anything martial-arts like before I am sure you could be very easily injured since the instructor gives no safety/form information. I HATE HATE HATE it when an instructor tells you to the opposite cueing (right is left and vice-versa). Amy Acuff is not motivating AT ALL! She is Calista-esque boney (scrawny doesn't equal fit to me) and totally lacks coordination (ok that can be a bit funny to watch), her only reason in the video is to make boring comments read from cue cards. And they talk about how great the music is but they only play a few good songs. I also found alot of the moves awkward to do and transitions between moves really poor. And I found it annoying when they would minimize a screen and put in a mini screen of one of the other participants faces. Definately go for a different video or DVD.",1000252800,15,1077,4.39
1390499,5,B000053V6H,"This video is so fun! The good thing is, it's entertaining to watch. Amy has no idea what she's doing so that'll make you laugh for the most part. I'm 14 and I wanted something to help me get a little more active after-school and such, so I bought this video because I like the music that is played in it. Believe me, music plays a big part in a workout. Music is very motivational, so I find it easy to get going with the routine. Sure, it's not the hardest thing in the world, but it gets you moving and puts your heartbeat right up there. Since the moves aren't too difficult, it's up to you to decide how much energy you want to put into it. If you tried your absolute best by kicking higher and punching harder, then of course you'd get more out of this video. I like the warm up and the cool down because it helps to mold the whole workout together. Another great thing about this video is the fact that it is not too long in length. I don't have very much time, but the video goes by so quickly with workin' it moves that I can still complete my other tasks while still feeling that I've done something. I've been doing this video for about 5 months and I have noticed results. If I didn't by now, then there's something wrong with me, eh? *lol* Seriously, I urge anyone to buy this who wants to get more fit and have fun with fun people and fun music.",996969600,3,1359,4.112781954887218
1390500,3,B000053V6H,"This is strictly a beginner kickboxing workout.  It is fun, and has great motivating music.  Especially when you put it through your stereo speakers using the DVD.  Amy Acuff looks a bit lost and uninspired here, and the instructor Allan is unpeasantly condescending to her.  He is a good instructor, and if I were to guess, I would say he is upset that she gets higher billing than him.  And, maybe rightly so, but unprofessional of him nonetheless.  The workout is easy to follow, and will get you sweating if you put some effort into it.  This really is a fun workout, but I have a hard time dealing with his attitude, and it detracts from the whole workout for me.  Probably, the workout itself deserves 5 stars for beginners, 4 stars for people who are a bit beyond that, but it lost a star or two for the reasons mentioned.",988761600,4,829,4.443708609271523
1390501,3,B000053V6H,"This is only the second workout video I've ever bought, and I was expecting it to be a lot more difficult than it was. This is really a beginner level video as far as fitness goes, but maybe intermediate as far as the difficulty of the moves. The instructor is low key and not annoying, and the music is great. The moves themselves aren't hard to learn and are demonstrated in an easy to follow fashion, aside from the reversed cueing - but once you learn the routine you just remember to switch sides and more or less ignore the instructor save for the counts.
It got me into my target heart rate zone for 15-20 minutes without boring me to pieces, and had a nice warmup and cooldown. I will likely go elsewhere when I get in better shape and this ceases to be any challenge at all.",986256000,4,783,4.261744966442953
1390502,4,B000053V6H,"I am a college student who has been working out at a gym on and off for the the past 5 years. I have tried everything from step to kick boxing, but find myself needed something on those days when I am too lazy to attend a class. I bought this video because it looked modern and had good music. After completing the work out, I thought that it was a fun and light work out that raised my heart rate, but didn't leave me fatigued. The moves were fairly basic and included boxing moves, typical aerobic moves, and a decent cool down. The music was great and the instructor was full of energy and enthusiastic. If you are looking for a light 30 minute work out, this is a good choice. It's good for those off days when you really can't go the extra mile, but still want to burn substanstial calories.",978652800,11,796,4.209150326797386
7930141,4,B000053V6H,"I like this workout video, it gets the heart rate up without being overly difficult & the soundtrack is really great. Amy Acuff is uncoordinated and her remarks are so obviously pre-rehearsed and annoying.  The main thing I don't like about the workout is that the instructor says ""left"" and if you want to mirror him, you have to go ""right"" but after a while I learned to adjust for that and it doesn't bother me any longer.",1404691200,,425,4.448717948717949
7930142,1,B000053V6H,"On the one hand this workout is very easy, and won't get your heartbeat up,.  On the other hand, the coreography is rather complicated and I found it annoying.  Amy Acuff sounds pathetic with her pre-rehearsed lines.  Definitely a DVD I will donate to Goodwill.",1403049600,,261,4.7555555555555555
7930143,4,B000053V6H,"As a moderately fit 55-year-old woman. I like this workout. While it is a kickboxing video, it also requires dance movements and style to provide a subtle challenge to the coordination (especially to Amy Acuff, who appears to have little to no coordination for this sort of thing). The instructor, Allan Aranzamendez does a nice job, even if his verbal instruction is a little ""off"" for the viewer. I don't find him difficult to follow, and I like the way he builds the routine so that it's easy to pull all of the combinatioens together into a polished routine by the end of the workout.",1274227200,,588,4.609523809523809
7930144,5,B000053V6H,"I have owned this DVD for a while.  I hate doing cardio because it means either boring treadmill or boring videos featuring middle aged women on steps in ugly outfits - or worse the loud obnoxious ""fit"" man shouting things. This video has none of those things.  The absolute best point is really the soundtrack. If you can't stand most workout video music, this one will likely fit your tastes (unless you like death metal, and to my knowledge there is no death metal workout).

It takes a good amount of trial and error to learn the routine - you will not get it the first and possibly even the second go-through. Once you learn it though, it is awesome.",1221868800,,655,4.441666666666666
7930145,4,B000053V6H,"Well, I don't think anyone would disagree that Amy Acuff is wasted time and space on the video. I personally like the music and love the workout. The good thing is no matter how much of an idiot as a beginner one is, there is no way in hell you can be worse than Amy. But the pump is a goody and well worth the $8.00 I am spending to get it.",1099008000,,341,3.75
7930146,5,B000053V6H,"This is my favorite video ever and I have been doing workout videos for a long time.  To get the bad stuff out of the way, yes Amy is a total spazz and the girl behind Alan apparantely thinks it's a cheerleading video instead of kickboxing.

Now to the good stuff.  Most of the dancers (male and female) are really hot and the music is fabulous. Even though it's a couple years old now, I started hearing the songs from it at the trendy stores in Atlanta -it makes me want to go home and work out.  Once you learn the moves, you cycle through them in a routine, so you're not stuck there doing the same thing for forever like a lot of videos.

You can work at your own level and keep track because they pause in the middle to check your pulse.  This is probably the best part because if you're dragging, it let's you know that it's time to pick it up.

It tones your whole body, including muscles I didn't even now I had.  If your body starts to get used to it, you can work a little harder, like by doing jump kicks instead of the regular ones or get deeper into your stances.

Fianlly there are some great stretchs at the end.

This is the only video I've been able to do week after week and still see results.  Over the year I've been using it, I've lost about 30lbs and I haven't really been trying that hard.

I'm still hoping MTV is going to make another workout video because I can't find another one that compares.",1096588800,2,1422,4.149635036496351
7930147,3,B000053V6H,"I didn't purchased the dvd on Amazon but at borders.  The cover looks nice, but the quality of the dvd isn't up to par. The editing is horrible, Amy whatever-her-last-name-is was extremely annoying.  Everytime the camera went to her and I tried to follow her moves I realized that my motion wasn't in sic with the main instructor.  She doesn't seem to know what she is doing. She is merely taking up space.  Her small talk was out of place.  I'm glad that she was not part of the background (she had her own little corner to the side).  If she was she would have been too distracting. Oh and she wasn't the only one who didn't seem to know what they were doing. Everyone seem to go off and did their own variations of what the moves were just to supplement.  I was extremely annoyed by the blonde woman in the corner.  Too much make-up on for working out, maybe?
I think the instructors queing made it difficult to follow him.  Keep in mind that there is no mirror image instructions.  When he says to go right and you go right, on the tv he's actually moving to your left.  So I couldn't really follow what he was doing. I had to adapt.
If you can get pass the above mentioned then it was an okay workout.  It did get your heart pumping but this is an easy workout.  Not fast pace at all, and my heart level never reached my cardio zone.  Good addition to working out, but don't use this soley to lose weight. Try ""Solid Gold"" instead.
And if you can try tae bo.",1066435200,2,1463,4.215827338129497
7930148,4,B000053V6H,"The worst part of this exercise video is Amy Cuff. The class is lead by another instructor who is not even on the cover of this dvd. She gets paid more money to look ridiculous on a video. I mean what was the point of having her there? She couldn't follow any of the steps and looked like some dum blonde that never worked out in her whole life so annyoing especially her comments.... On the other hand, if you could overlook her and concentrate on the routine, music, dramatic people in the back you will get an excellent workout! I have been doing this dvd for 3 months now and i have firmed up my abs, arms and lost a few inches on my thighs. You start the steps slowly, working on little bits of the routine first until you repeat them a few times and go tempo. All parts of your body are in movement. I don't get tired of it. But it took time for me to ignore Amy Cuff. The instructor seems very educated on exercise to be placed with an air head like Amy on an exercise video. Throughout the entire video you can tell that he feels 'this is a professional insult to be placed with this airhead' but i guess he took it as stepping stone to eventually get his own tapes without some 'olympic star name.' Amy Cuff, stick to high jumping. Allan, keep it going the dancers in the back all have great personalites and workout very nicely. I didn't like the girl with the short shorts and big thighs i think a different athletic outfit would have suited her.",1050105600,2,1457,4.225806451612903
7930149,4,B000053V6H,"Yes, Allan messes up the right and left cues. Yes, Amy doesn't teach the video, but that's actually a good thing. She can't concentrate and talk at the same time. I have knee problems, therefore making it hard for me to do step aerobics, so this is a good floor routine. And check this out girls, I got my husband to do this video with me every other day. We do weights 3 day's a week and walks on Saturdays, so this is just a video for us to get our heart rates up during the week. We love it. Good warm up, floor routing, cool down and the music fits in perfectly where it needs to. But if your library has a copy, it's always good to try it first. Have fun...and stay healthy!",1047513600,4,679,4.037037037037037
7930150,4,B000053V6H,"Well, I saw this video tape in the store and figured, what the heck, Amy Acuff is an Olympic high jumper so they've got to have something good here. Little did I know the workout was actually being led by another person, a guy with a very long name, and an attitude as well. Amy makes comments throughout the video and he always responds with an attitude. It doesn't make a difference, because the workout is fun and gets you motivated. I've used it for two weeks now, and I swear, I already have results. The workout is easy to learn after a few times and it gets you going. I'd go for it, and hey, you get a laugh at the uncoordinated Amy Acuff and the dramatic back up dancers!!",1042848000,2,681,4.206106870229007
