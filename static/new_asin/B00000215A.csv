SEE thieves try to rob an empty warehouse!  SEE the mama/son gangster team!  SEE a reporter killed live on the air!  SEE a gun-wielding housewife attack ruthless terrorists!

Expertly written with lots of wit and a wink to the audience, this film was conceived as a poor man's DIE HARD, but how poor can you get?  Cobbled together on a working man's wages, PROVOKED called in every favor it could.  The star is the director's wife.  Her on-screen husband is one of the investors.  The lead hostage co-wrote the script.  The blonde hostage is the weapons handler's girlfriend.  Two producers play prison guards.  Their accountant plays the psychiatrist.  The whole camera crew takes turns playing cops.  The street crowd - all 12 of them - features whatever friends could take the day off.  Half the cast worked under pseudonyms.  ""Daniel Kwong"" is Dennis Phung, sadly murdered in a notorious case much publicized in 1996.  ""Ona Simms"" is in reality Ona Zee, famous for making - how shall I say this? - a more exotic kind of film.

It's LETHAL WEAPON meets Edward D. Wood.  Ya gotta see this film!",1237248000,2,1255,4.609090909090909
