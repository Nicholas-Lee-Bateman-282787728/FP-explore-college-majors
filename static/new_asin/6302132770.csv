8591074,3,6302132770,"One of the dangers that a fugitive faces does not come from only the police.  It is reasonable to assume that any man who gets around as much as Richard Kimble does is bound to be recognized by one who knew him before the trial.  As a doctor Richard Kimble lost a few patients, one of whom was a young girl whose father unfairly has blamed him for her death.  Years later, the father, Victor Leonetti (Telly Savalas) recognizes Kimble and informs the police.  Leonetti calls Lt. Gerard, who at first does not accept the tip as genuine, thus giving Gerard a little more believability as a detective who will not run off to another state merely to check out what might prove a bum steer.  But Gerard does go and for the umpteenth time thus far in the series places Kimble in custody.  Meanwhile, Leonetti comes to regret his actions and helps Kimble to escape.
  MAY GOD HAVE MERCY is far from being one of the best ones, with the only point of interest is the indication that Gerard is getting a reality check about the validity of phone tips in the night.",1026086400,3,1055,4.402061855670103
