4890949,4,B005TK21WQ,"It would appear that in the 21st century, everything old is new again.  And perhaps nowhere is that more true than in Hollywood.  Whether it is in remakes or sequels, Hollywood has this way of repeating itself.  As a result, it seems most unsettling that one of the films from the past that should be remade for a 21st century audience would be a film that, when released near the end of 1971, caused extreme uproar because of its explicit violence and sexual material.  The film in question is director Sam Peckinpah's controversial shocker STRAW DOGS, which remains, alongside Stanley Kubrick's A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, among the most hotly debated films of its time or any time in history.  For whatever reason, though, Hollywood thought it needed an updating, and so former film critic turned director/screenwriter Rod Lurie stepped into the shoes of ""Bloody Sam"" to do it.

Following both the film's original source material (Gordon M. Williams' 1969 novel ""The Siege Of Trencher's Farm"") and the 1971 screenplay written by David Zelag Goodman and Peckinpah, this particular version was moved from the original's setting on the Cornwall coast of England to a backwater town somewhere along the Mississippi/Louisiana border.  James Marsden takes on the role of David Sumner (played by Dustin Hoffman in 1971), who has come to this small Southern town with his wife Amy (Kate Bosworth, taking over for Susan George) to work on a movie screenplay based on the 1943 battle of Stalingrad.  And as it so happens, his seeming demure nature puts the redneck boys down there in the position of superiority over him, first when Bosworth's pet cat is found strangled in the closet, then, to make matters even more sinister, when Bosworth is raped by her former boyfriend (Alexander Skarsgard) and another man (Rhys Coiro).

Marsden, however, comes to his senses when he takes in the local mental invalid (Dominic Purcell) who has unintentionally strangled the daughter (Willa Holland) of the town's ex-football coach (James Woods).  Woods, Coiro, and Skarsgard show up on Marsden's property and brutally demand that Purcell be handed over to them, but Marsden, knowing fully well what will happen to him, Purcell, and Bosworth, does no such thing.  The end result is ultra-violent mayhem in the film's last twenty minutes.

Lurie, who made two of the best films of the year 2000 (DETERRENCE; THE CONTENDER) likely set himself up for a fall in trying to tone down the most objectionable parts of the Peckinpah original that made it, in the eyes of some, a ""fascist"" work of art: the rape scene, which is a bit too quickly done and a bit too aimed to show Bosworth as a feminist, though she is every bit as traumatized as George was in the original; and unwisely discounting the idea posited by Peckinpah, and based on the works of noted anthropologist Robert Ardrey, that Man's penchant for brutality and violence, far from the common notion that they would go to any means to protect their ""property"", is ingrained in him from the start.  The other thing that is objectionable about this new version of STRAW DOGS is that, unlike the English village where Peckinpah sees the seemingly primitive villagers as every bit the match for Hoffman, the ones in this small Southern town are the unfortunate stereotypical inbred rednecks, especially Woods, who, normally a solid actor, is allowed by Lurie to overact outrageously.  And the siege, though fairly well staged, is nevertheless so hyper-violent that the audience becomes a tad bit detached, instead of really being forced to confront their inner demons, as Hoffman's character, and to a great extent Peckinpah himself, did in the original film.  Whereas Peckinpah was deliberately ambiguous and thought provoking, and not just a blood-and-guts expert, Lurie makes the mistake of trying to wrap everything up in a neat, albeit very bloody package.

Nevertheless, despite these flaws that keep Lurie's film from reaching the nightmarish heights of Peckinpah's, the 2011 STRAW DOGS features solid enough performances from Marsden and Bosworth, who are able to capture the psychological torment that their characters feel.  They are still in the shadow of what Hoffman and George did in 1971, but they are able to bring a certain kind of resolve and emotional gravitas to the situation that Lurie doesn't always provide in his direction or script.  Larry Groupe's score, though distractingly loud at times (this in contrast to the subtlety of the original film's excellent Jerry Fielding score), also works in those moments where it's supposed to.  The end result is, like many remakes, rather imperfect.  Still, there have been far worse remakes that Hollywood has done, and will yet do.",1316131200,2,4725,5.033333333333333

4890955,3,B005TK21WQ,"*** 3-Stars *** If it wasn't a remake of a famous (and much better) film, I might give it 3-1/2 stars ... I mean, it's not that this is a terrible flick, but it's just a generic thriller compared to Sam Peckinpah's over-the-top 1971 original.  Considered so violent in its time, the original ""Straw Dogs"" was banned in many states and created a firestorm of debate about censorship, etc.  It was one of the films that forced Hollywood to start rating films for sex and violence, to stop the government from doing so on its own.  And then ... we have the 2011 remake of 'Straw Dogs' - it will not upset anyone at all above the age of 12.  It's not just that we have become inured to even the most grotesque acts of movie violence (we have, of course), it's that this flick doesn't push hard on anything at all, not even the psychological themes, while Peckinpah pushed the-pedal-to-the-metal in 1971 in every way possible, and damn the consequences.  The 2011 remake is many, many miles away from that kind of attitude.  Thanks for reading.",1518998400,,1039,4.529411764705882

4890980,4,B005TK21WQ,"The movie has a grim plot. Some of the characters harbor uncontrollable desires that lead to violence. The people and situations sound very realistic. Unfortunately, it paints the deep South (or, in this movie, a small Mississippi town) as outwardly Christian but inwardly hypocritical; they show by their actions that they think sin is righteous; in reality, these ""believers"" are dangerous and are no better than criminals. I had to be blunt there, but some people only subscribe to the cultural beliefs of football, hunting, and dehumanizing others as their  ""faith"" in Jesus.  I enjoyed the movie. I think that the movie shows a good message of not being a hypocrite or a liar. It does contain violence in several scenes and an implied racial tone in one scene.

I noticed a lot of the lines, even unimportant ones were present in this movie that originated in the old one.  Why do remakes always have to do that?  I liked the ending in this movie more than in the old one.  Of course, why good ol boys feel they have to stick together, even when they gun down a police officer, to kill some more is strange.  Kate Bosworth was a better actress than Susan George, so that's a plus.  I liked Major Scott in the old one better than then new cop.

Alexander Skarsgard plays the ex-high school macho football star boyfriend who really leers extremely well at Kate's character.  James Wood is the standard ex football coach that still maintains alot of power with everybody in a small southern town where football is king of friday nights.  It lacks the power the original delivered but it still a good watch.  I find it a little hard to believe that southern boys all want a piece of Kate Bosworth's waif thin body.

4891053,4,B005TK21WQ,"For the 30th anniversary of Dustin Hoffman's classic film, Straw Dogs, the studio decided instead of re-releasing a special edition, that they would do a modern re-make of the film. For those unfamiliar with the story, it features a local girl, from a small Mississippi town, who has returned home with her new husband, after making it big in Hollywood. Once back in town, the new couple needs some work on the old farm that she inherited and hire an old friend of hers to do the job. The team is the most qualified in town, but right from the start you can see the tension starting to build. Straw Dogs is far from being a unique story, but what I really enjoyed about it was how methodical it was. The jealousy and tension are obvious from the start, but they build it slowly, through a serious of events, which lends credibility to both sides of the argument. Things continue to build right up until the end of the film when all hell breaks loose, thanks to an incident that really shouldn't involve either the workers or the couple. James Marsden and Kate Bosworth star and are both very good, but the star that shines the brightest is Alexander Skarsgard. I've never seen him in anything before and had no expectations about the kind of job he'd do and I was blown away. He really had to play two different roles in this film and it leads to some shocking and unexpected moments. Comparing the 2011 re-make to the original film, the stories are very similar, whoever I found in parts where the original was a little slow, the re-make turns up the intensity, and that's the way things should be. A lot of re-makes don't even compare to the original and are seldom better, but in this case it was. The producers looked back at the old film and enhanced the parts of the original that were too slow or didn't make a whole lot of sense, before modernizing the whole thing. There are some people who will never admit to liking a re-make, but I think with Straw Dogs, the producers took a good film and turned it into a great one.",1422144000,,2029,4.427807486631016

4891090,3,B005TK21WQ,"When you remake a great movie, I believe that the characters and story line should be improved.

In this movie they made it tamer and more bland.  They also eliminated many the important points
of the first movie.  Like for example, one of the workers in the original got into the house and stole
a pair of Amy's panties and were twirling them around his finger to his buddies.  These panties were
silky, sexy and lace trimmed. There were several scenes in which she ""flashed panties"" where modern
Amy did not. We did not get to see her panties until the rape scene and they were ""virginal"" white cotton
panties which completely contradicted her line to  her husband that ""she dressed for him"".

There were numerous other important scenes and details missing from the re-make.  The final scene was
completely re-written and was not nearly as powerful as the original.  The rape scene was not nearly as convincing
either.  There were some major details missing from the battling guys that also lessened the impact of the movie.

4891107,2,B005TK21WQ,"This movie suffers from the perfect storm of bad directing, weak screen writing and miscast stars. To start with - we are expected to believe that the hot, young, married couple who breezes into town (or back into town in the case of the wife),  in a 100K vintage Jaguar,  had some compelling reason to leave their cushy careers in LA to return to the isolated and rural ancestral home of the wife (woefully miscast Kate Bosworth).
Once in their new hick town, they immediately stand out like sore thumbs with the husband (decently played by James Marsden) using big words and his cell phone a lot and the wife running around in what appears to be her underwear most of the time.  In the local bar, we are introduced to the ""straw dogs"" -  a group of has been local football stars now relegated to eeking out a living doing odd jobs and poaching deer in the woods.  Throw in the apparently alchoholic,bi-polar and over-protective ex football coach (played with maximum over- the- topness including tons of spittle, yelling and crazed body movements by a clearly past his prime James Woods) -  that it seems he may be more inclined to hit the meth pipe than the whiskey bottle.
 Worlds collide in a series of ridiculous events and bad things start to happen.  Examples include - wife jogs in her underwear (and oddly her bare feet) and gets upset when the straw dogs who are roofing the barn oogle her.  She then berates her husband who rather wisely suggests she may want to put some clothes on and then goes upstairs and does a strip tease for the roofers?  The story line alludes to a past relationship between the wife and the leader of the straw dog pack (Alexander Skarsgard of True Blood and Generation Kill fame) - yet it is never fully explained and who cares anyway?  Viewers are left to surmise that Skarsgard is somehow threatened by the new husband and wants to reclaim the spoiled and annoying wife for his own again?
The director has to be seriously faulted for jumps in the story line and overuse of every possible horror trick in the book - murder, rape, explosions and fire everywhere!!  The most ridiculous scene is supposed to be the grand finale of ""the siege"" when the murderous straw dogs and meth tweaking coach attack the home of the wife and husband.  Apparently the straw dogs are too stupid to realize until after they have basically burned down the home, shot out every window and rammed a truck through the front door -  that they could have just entered via using a ladder through an upstairs window which of course the one straw dog with half a brain figured out.  Violence of every type ensures and I will leave you to guess what happens in the end but it won't be a surprise because the director makes it soooo obvious in a prior scene how one of them is going to die - you will laugh out loud!",1378512000,2,2827,4.483430799220273

4891162,3,B005TK21WQ,"That's the question explored in this 2011 remake of Sam Peckinpah's film of 40 years prior. The location has been changed from the English countryside to the deep south of coastal Mississippi (although shot in Louisiana), but the plot is the same: A well-to-do couple from L.A. move back to the wife's hometown and settle into the now vacant homestead. James Marsden plays the screen writing husband and Kate Bosworth his wife. They enlist some roofers whom she knows from her high school days, the leader being 6'4"" Alexander Skarsgrd, a former boyfriend of Kate's character. Rivalry is in the air as he subtly tries to emasculate Kate's brainy husband and she starts to question his manhood. Havoc ensues.

Although I'm well familiar with Peckinpah and his Westerns, I've never seen the original version of ""Straw Dogs"" so I'm basing this review solely on this version without comparisons to Peckinpah's original.

This is a psychological-thriller and so there's a lot of drama and subtle suspense build-up; things don't blow-up until the final act, so to speak. Consequently, anyone looking for mindless action should stay away. Those who enjoy films shot in the deep South, like ""Deliverance,"" ""Squirm,"" ""The General's Daughter,"" ""Undertow,"" ""The Man in the Moon,"" ""Ode to Billy Joe (1976)"" and the remake of ""Cat People"" will likely appreciate this new version of ""Straw Dogs"" (I wasn't joking about including ""Squirm,"" btw). There are also similarities to ""Of Mice and Men,"" like the mentally challenged guy who doesn't know his own strength.

The conflict here is basically brawn vs. brain or Lynyrd Skynyrd vs. Bach. Some have complained that Marsden was wrong for the role of the husband since it called for more of a wimpy nerd like Dustin Hoffman in the original, but I thought Marsden was excellent in the part. This is a totally civilized man of average stature (5'10"") with an intellectual occupation who is forced to shed all his civilized conditioning and revert back to the barbarism of his ancestors. The role didn't require some uber-dweeb.

Bosworth, however, doesn't fit the role of the sultry wife who wows all the guys around her simply because she's too thin and un-curvy. She's good-looking, she just needs to gain about 12-15 lbs. to pull off a hottie. Take, for instance, the flashing from the window scene: It just doesn't work with Bosworth.

After the film I felt dubious about some of the character's actions in the story: Why does a rape-victim keep silent? Why on earth is the popular high school cheerleader interested in the local mentally-challenged hunk? Why does the ex-coach hate this poor sob and why is he so rash? Etc. A little reflection will answer these and other questions. If you're having trouble figuring them out simply go to the IMDb message board for answers. In any event, I like it when films don't spell everything out and make you think.

FINAL WORD: It's nothing outstanding, but if you appreciate Southern Gothic or Rural Gothic, regardless of genre (drama, adventure, horror, thriller), this 2011 version of ""Straw Dogs"" is effective enough. It forces you to think and glean answers. I should add that there's a hard-to-watch rape scene and at least one other sexually suggestive scene (where you can't make anything out, but you know what's going on), not to mention the mayhem of the climax, but it's mostly an intelligent drama that slowly builds tension. Unfortunately, Bosworth is miscast and there's a feeling of unreality to some of the proceedings, indicating that kinks needed to be worked out in the script.

The film runs 110 minutes.

Tensions flare between David and several of the locals after a few unfortunate altercations, but how far will David go to defend himself when he is pushed over the edge? STRAW DOGS can be counted amongst several of the most unnecessary remakes in the 2000's. Rather than spend his time returning to the original novel in an attempt to present something new entirely, writer/director Rod Lurie has tried (and failed) to recreate Sam Peckinpah's controversial screen adaptation with minimal changes to the plot or characters. The cast, which includes James Marsden and Kate Bosworth in leading roles, is far less effective, and in trying to imitate the timely delivery of the first film, Lurie has forgotten that modern audiences only have a limited attention span. He also feels the need to repeatedly spell out the underlying themes in the film, presuming that the audience is too unintelligent to understand them. This leaves only the controversial rape scene and ultra-violent ending for fans to look forward to, which also serve to disappoint given the level of desensitization that now exists. The STRAW DOGS of 2011 isn't necessarily a poorly made film, it just pales in comparison to its predecessor like so many other remakes of its time.

4891165,3,B005TK21WQ,"This was a heavy, scary movie, as was the original, with the examination of the underlying violence in man -- in this case the enviousness and frustration of those stuck in a backwater town. The original featured a menacing group of rednecks in Cornwall, England. This remake features a menacing group of rednecks in Mississippi. I actually thought the choice of locations in the remake was a mistake -- the idea of drunk, trigger-happy yahoos in Mississippi doing what they do best -- killing things -- is a well-worn cliche. I'm sure people who live in Mississippi -- and don't act like this -- could be offended by the stereotypes.

In any case, there is some psychological complexity to the characters. Is the nice guy hero, played by James Marsden, really as nice as he seems? Is the wife, played by Kate Bosworth, repelled by -- or attracted to -- the menacing group repairing their roof -- particularly her ex-boyfriend?

This remake is nothing new at all. I am not speaking of this just being a remake but this movie is no different than a ton of movies out there. To be fair maybe the idea of this plot was new back in '71 with the original but there have been a million movies with this plot.

In a nutshell a Hollywood couple, David (James Marsden) and Amy (Kate Bosworth) leave Cali and go back to Amy's backwoods Southern town to rebuild Amy's family home after her father's passed away.

Of course stereotypes run rampant. I'm Southern myself and I get so tired of the same old stereotypes about Southerners. We have trashy women, drunk and rowdy locals, a mentally disabled forty-something year-old and a loud, racist ex-coach (James Woods) who still lives in the past.

Among these colorful folks is Charlie(Amy's ex) and his sex-craved hillbilly, redneck buddies who make the naive David feel like they are trying to be friendly when in actuality they are jealous of him because of his intellect and liberal outlook. In other words the characters are nothing new.

I didn't buy that Charlie would hang around with a bunch of numbskulls like his friends. He seemed more intelligent and on a higher plane than to hang out with such dumb hicks.

So of course the rednecks do a bunch of little things that alarm the couple which lead to one lame conclusion that I won't go into. If you wanna know, watch the film.

This movie was garbage. The acting was okay but the movie was boring, predictable and idiotic. David is too stupid for words and I am sorry but James and Kate have no chemistry so neither did David and Amy.

One thing I must point out is the rape scene. It might've fit in the original but it seemed so out-of-place here. Charlie really showed no emotion toward Amy. He flirted a little but other than that it wasn't like he had feelings for her anymore. So if the rape was to show us Charlie's love for Amy it didn't work. If it was because he wanted to show anger toward Amy, I could buy it but it still didn't fit. Just because a movie is a remake doesn't mean it has to include every single thing from the original. The rape scene made no sense and should've been left out.

If you haven't seen the original, don't make the same mistake I did and watch this mess first. Watch the original. For those who've seen the original I am sure you already know this is crap.

I am look forward to seeing the first Straw Dogs which is known as a controversial classic.

4891193,3,B005TK21WQ,"Spoilers Ahead!

I hadn't seen the original since I was very young but I remembered it well (probably because I was way too young to see something so traumatic).  This film is very different on some fundamental levels.

A. Original David - He is a war protester and pacifist which is unrelatable to the broader modern audience but was very relatable to an audience in the early 70's with the whole make love not war movement.  David is also fighting against the violence of an English village as a whole and not just one group of friends so it is David finally facing the fact that he can't escape violence as it is a very human condition.  He fights and he wins while he hates himself for doing so all the way.  Yet, in the end he becomes the very thing he hates when he gets so much enjoyment out of ""getting them all"" and that becomes the most disturbing thing about the film.  You walk away thinking that the animal side exists in us all just below the surface.

Remake David - He is an effete, privileged intellectual who clearly can't relate to his wife's home town and spends his time smirking at it and trying to be superior.  It's evident as soon as they drive into town and he hears the woman yell at her dogs barking.  The look on his face is shock.  Then in the bar he is clearly amused and appalled at the town folk.  Even his offering of the job to Charlie smacks of elitism (a kind of oh, I'll throw some work the way of your poor, uneducated high school friends).  He is shocked by the coach's behavior but he is too busy feeling superior to fully understand the danger.

Like the original David, this one treats his wife as an trophy but not a person.  He talks down to her on many occasions (chess is the best example) and does not seek her counsel about the very people she knows.  He hires Charlie without asking if she even trusts him.  You know from the start of this movie that their relationship is doomed.

On a side note, I didn't feel Marsden did much with the character.  I felt he was overplayed.  I would have like to have seen what James Franco would have done with this character.  I think we would have had a much more nuanced character.

B. Original Amy - She was very confusing but David's sexism and her response was more understandable in the early 70's when men were still, for the most part, considered the head of the house and women merely servants and bed warmers without opinions or thoughts.  Personally I never thought Amy enjoyed the rape as some did.  I felt she began to respond to Charlie to minimize the damage to herself from the rape.  She is not being raped by a stranger after all.  She knows Charlie and tries to call on their past relationship to tame the beast in him.  This is a world she knows and playing along is the only way she knows to survive with the least damage.  There is still a bit of passive aggressive rebel in Amy who flashes Charlie and his men, but it's very childish and impulsive and she pays dearly for it (and I think it's not wholly unexpected).  There is also a part of Amy that understands men like this and though she thinks David is a better ""catch"", there are parts of him she doesn't respect and parts of him she silently despises (his superiority over her).  I also believe she doesn't tell him because she doesn't think he is capable of doing anything to protect her.

Remake Amy -  I felt the Amy in this movie was more transparent and had more depth.  She is giddy coming into town but once she gets there the tension starts.  The look on her face when she sees the church tells you something bad went down in there.  She does it again in the barn and David asks if she is alright.  It happens again when Charlie says he used to take care of her and she says, ""But you didn't, did you.""  I felt my hair stand up when she said that and I wondered what had happened and from what Charlie didn't protect her.  I get the feeling that this is why she left Charlie.

With this Amy I have less understanding of why she stays in her marriage unless she is just star struck.  This man clearly thinks little of her, bosses her around and uses her.  The way she calls her father's house David's house is just bizarre in this day and age.  It isn't his house, it's her house.  This is her town.  The one place the film falls down for me is in making me believe in this relationship.  I don't see what David has that would make her go along with his behavior.  This Amy is spunky and rebellious so why does she passively let him hire men she isn't really comfortable around?  As the movie goes on it is clear something happened to her in the past.  The Zydeco music that makes her uncomfortable, her reactions to certain places and her certainty that they not only killed her cat but that this is the precursor to further and escalated violence.  She doesn't seem far enough under David's spell for her refusal to stand up to him to make sense.  She seems more like that type that would angrily say, ""Wake up you big idiot, I know this town and you don't!""  It also made no sense whatsoever that she would run without a sports bra.  That simply isn't comfortable and made no sense at all.  It seemed to be done for pure gratification purposes and so fell very short.

One thing that stays true is her reaction during the rape.  She also gets to the point where she responds to Charlie to try to tame the beast.  This Charlie is also more complicated so her actions there make more sense.  It also makes more sense that she calls for Charlie to protect her from his friend.  When he doesn't, you get the feeling they've been down this path before and that is probably the most disturbing of all.  I wondered if this wasn't what she meant when she said he didn't take care of her.  I felt like I was in Peyton Place where a town turns its back on the ugliness even at the expense of the victims.  This is further solidified by her reaction to David when he returns.  She indicates they both are out of their depth in this place.

I think Bosworth's handling of this character was good.  She is the right mix of spunk, rebellion and shaking fear.  Her eyes and trembling hands/voice tell a great deal about the character's thoughts, emotions and even memories.

C. Original Charlie - Charlie is another character that is very different than the original.  In the original, Charlie is one dimensional and entirely animalistic.  You have no sympathy or understanding for him at all.  He's just a thug and nothing more.  He's not developed in any way and the audience has no way to understand him.  Perhaps Peckinpah did this on purpose to equate Charlie to the enemy in a war which you would not know in depth either.  Personally I felt that the original David was such a jerk that the only way to see him as a protagonist was to make Charlie completely void of any character, but I think much of that was a generational thing (a young viewer versus an older viewer who would accept David's actions as normal).

Remake Charlie - I have to give considerable props here to Alexander Skarsgard.  No matter how Rudin directed this film or how it was written, it is Skarsgard's performance that changes Charlie to a more three dimensional character.  This is quite a feat given the dark material.  In Skarsgard's hands, Charlie comes off as man who plays the confident ex-jock, alpha male with some serious cracks in his persona.  On the one side there is the way Charlie is with David - soft spoken, smiling, confident but always getting the jab in.  He does it in such a way that David for the most part doesn't even see it.  This is the swaggering Charlie who is sure that Amy will leave the effete intellectual for a real man.  He is very sure of himself with David and he never falters there.  I found myself actually enjoying some of Charlie's jabs at David because David was such a jerk.  If Charlie hadn't gone as far as he did later, I would have wanted him to win.  As it is, Skarsgard's Charlie manages to ramp up the tension with David at every turn and you find yourself tense whenever they come into contact.  You are just waiting for Charlie to make an overt move to take Amy back and put David in his place.

Yet, it is with Amy that Skarsgard's Charlie is the most complex.  Rudin fell down on giving more backstory here, but despite that Skarsgard's performance, as well as Bosworth's, give you the sense that something big went on between those two in the past.  It starts as soon as Amy tells Charlie he didn't really take care of her.  You see that flicker in Charlie's big, blue eyes, that sudden drop in his confidence and swagger. Right away you know that it is true that he didn't protect her from something.  It happens again when she glares at him after his men make remarks to her and then she flashes them from the window.  A number of things cross Charlie's face - shock, betrayal, dread and desire.  The way he starts watching the house is like he's fighting back the urge to storm it right then and there.  The music is bothering him, his men's remarks are bothering him, his memories are bothering him and his desire to take what he thinks is his is barely restrained.

The rape scene is probably the most complex one I've ever seen on film.  This is when you know for sure that Charlie has some real issues beneath the surface.  He has obviously deluded himself that Amy still wants him because of her actions in the window.  He says as much to David at the church.  He acts as though she will realize this and come back to him if he just makes her see how much more of a man he is and this includes in a sexual way.  He is kissing her and touching her like they are still lovers and his forcible restraint of her is accompanied by looks of frustration that indicate he thinks she's simply playing hard to get.  His frustration turns to rage as she continues to say no and resist and he continues to insist she wants him.  Yet he also reassures her that he won't hurt her and tries to kiss her and hold her.  The look on his face when it's over and he tries to be tender but she rebuffs him is complete shock.  He really doesn't get it.  It's almost like Charlie has deluded himself into thinking he has to force her to be unfaithful and then she'll realize he's the better man and that she still loves him.  I honestly had to wonder if he would have protected her if she had responded at all at that point.

There's also a completely strange dynamic going on with Charlie and Norm.  Although Charlie seems to be in charge, Norm is always there in the background ominously looming.  In the bar and on the roof, he is given a lot of screen focus which makes his character seem more important.  He also seems to have a problem with Amy from the time he sees her in Blackie's.  He gives her a look like she disgusts him several times with the first being in the bar.  I can't decide if it's because of how he perceives she treats Charlie or the town in general.  But it is the hold he seems to have over Charlie that is the most strange and again, I wish they had shown more backstory.  There is no reason why Charlie, who obviously still cares so much about Amy, albeit in a very twisted way, would allow another man to rape her so brutally. I don't buy that Charlie did that because Amy exposed herself to his men.  If this were the case he would have been more brutal in the rape and not at all like a lover.  At the least he would have been a heck of a lot more conflicted.  Like the original, Charlie seems surprised at first by Norm's appearance.  It comes when we've seen the absolute stunned look on Charlie's face once he realizes how traumatized Amy is and how clearly she does not love him.  He's in complete shock and uncomfortable with Norm's intrusion even as he holds her down.  As he sits in the chair and watches the rape unfold, his face again shows many emotions, shock, hurt, disbelief, horror and finally resignation.  What's so interesting here is that he seems resigned to Amy's fate as if he can do nothing.  He is physically bigger and in better shape than Norm and he is also the boss.  Again, I wondered what hold Norm had over him.

In the final scenes Charlie is again like a man with serious fissures in his mental state.  He finally goes to the rescue of Amy when Norm attacks again.  He seems to think he can reason with Norm, but he definitely is trying to protect Amy at last.  It's almost like he's reached a point similar to David where he finally has to stand up to something he's avoided for so long.  Again I wondered what had happened when they were all young.  I had the feeling that it definitely involved Norm.  Charlie is shocked when Amy kills Norm.  His face says he doesn't think she had it in her and clearly he didn't think she had that viciousness in her that she displays when she kills Norm.  Yet he still clings to this twisted romantic notion that he can protect her from the consequences of all that has happened and that she will love him.  In the end he's still trying to win her.  He's so seriously twisted but you almost wonder what kind of upbringing could produce such a perverted perception of reality.

Skarsgard's Charlie is this wonderful mix of deadly machismo and deluded romantic.  As a viewer you hate Charlie, but you can't help feeling bad that whatever went wrong in his life was never fixed because you keep catching glimpses of something worthwhile in him.  That's a pretty big accomplishment for any actor with a character like that.  In the end, it is truly his movie.",1348358400,10,13543,4.337579617834395

4891195,5,B005TK21WQ,"Its almost a rare thing to find any original ideas coming out of Hollywood these days.  Its even rarer to find a remake that out shines it's source material.  This new retelling of Sam Peckinpah's Straw Dogs is one of those rare finds.  Though a lot has change in the forty years since Dustin Hoffman first picked up a gun and grew into a man, the story is as timeless as the Bible and the end result, though very bloody, is far less pessimistic than the 1970s' version.

The story remains faithful with a few changes here and there.  David Sumner (James Marsden; X-Men, Bachelorette) and his new wife Amy (Kate Bosworth; Blue Crush, Superman Returns) have come back to Amy's hometown to fix up her late father's home.  Almost immediately, the town isn't exactly rolling out the red carpet for her Hollywood writer husband.  In fact, they're downright rude (In one scene, David pulls out his credit card to pay for dinner and the waitress says ""Cash only; its what us common folk use."". Sorry, b*tch but I'm as common as they come and I rarely, if ever carry cash.).  But in strolls Charlie (Alexander Skarsgard; ""True Blood"", Battleship), Amy's ex boyfriend and the town's one time football legend.  He seems friendly enough but his calm and cool demeanor masks an ugly side that few people outside his band of redneck friends know about.

I'm a big fan of Peckinpah's original vision (I own the now OOP Criterion release bought from Amazon as well) but the man's pessimistic attitude to our kind as well as his mean streak towards women bleeds through and the movie suffered because of it.  And the biggest and best change in the update is with the Amy character.  While Susan George is a beautiful woman, she made Amy out to be like the Paris Hilton of her day.  She was also a completely unsympathetic character so when Charlie and his friend rapes her, you pretty much felt she got what was coming.  Kate, on the other hand, gives Amy a warmth and compassionate side so that when the rape occurs (though less graphic), the abuse she suffers makes it all more realistic that we're almost prompted to shut the movie off.  Plus, she is very much in love with her husband despite his flaws and it shows where, in the original, I was scratching my head trying to figure out how this nerdy mathematician was lucky enough to land such a bombshell of a wife.

I think the theaters are over flooded with remakes today so it's not surprising to know that this remake bombed out during its theatrical run.  But if you're willing to give it a shot, you will not be disappointed.  Just be warned that though the film isn't as bleak as its predecessor, its still very violent and not for the faint of heart.

4891218,2,B005TK21WQ,"With Sam Peckinpah's original film of STRAW DOGS, part of the tale (as with most Peckinpah films) is very allegorical. His version, with Dustin Hoffman, is an ugly and brutal film that, thematically, basically says that the true birth of a man is through violence. Rod Lurie's remake of this film moves locale from Britain's countryside to the Deep South of the USA, but thematically works on a similar theme, but it REALLY hits you over the head with it. Lurie also directed the sadly overrated THE CONTENDER (with Joan Allen as the veep with the sex-tape past), so I wasn't looking forward to it for his work. I wasn't looking forward to it for the work of Kate Bosworth either, since she just doesn't have much in the way of charm or genuine appeal. I love Alexander Skarsgard on TRUE BLOOD, but I didn't see much playing to his strengths here. I saw this primarily because I believe that James Marsden (The X-MEN trilogy, HOP, ENCHANTED, GOSSIP, THE 24TH HOUR) is one of the more underrated and under-utilized actors in Hollywood.

The tale here is simple; West Coast screenwriter and ""liberal elitist"" Marsden and his new bride Bosworth travel back to her home in Mississippi intend to stay at her ancestral home after her father's passing long enough to square away the estate and for Marsden to finish his screenplay about The Battle of Stalingrad. Skarsgard is her former high-school jock boyfriend who has a housing repair business, and naturally still carries a torch for her. Marsden heads into the town bar, who has the town drunk and former high school football coach James Woods inhabiting it. Marsden looks down his nose at his new neighbors and Woods makes fun of him for having no laces on his sneakers. Marsden also comes across brothers Walton Goggins (in a role that wastes his massive talent) and Dominic Purcell, who are the George and Lenny of the town. Purcell is apparently a special-needs adult who likes to expose himself to young girls, and Goggins tries his best to keep him out of trouble. Woods has a high-school age daughter that, for a TOTALLY INEXPLICABLE reason, keeps coming on to Purcell (I get that he's good-looking at all, but he's a convicted sex-offender), and of course, this angers Woods to no end. Skarsgard and his employees/cronies make crude comments about and do rude things to Marsden and Bosworth, but Skarsgard's steely gaze is so fixed on Bosworth and from a character standpoint, he's wondering to himself how a ""wimp"" like Marsden could have a woman like Bosworth. Through a series of increasingly bizarre and dramatically inorganic events, we eventually get a violent and blood-soaked stand-off between Skarsgard, Woods and Co. versus Marsden and Bosworth.

Really, there are so many more problems than solutions in this mess of a film. Firstly, Lurie apparently felt that keeping the original film's rape scene was essential to the storytelling. Now, it's pretty evident through Peckinpah's body of work (e.g. THE WILD BUNCH, THE GETAWAY and the original version of this film) that he was not a feminist pioneer. Violence against women ran rampant in his films and was no less excusable then than it is now, but for whatever reason, the 1970's had a pervasive psychoanalytical belief that rape was a secret fantasy of every woman and somehow was easier to show on screen. In 2011, this belief has been completely and totally invalidated. Therefore, there is NO REASON WHATSOEVER that A: this scene was necessary to the plot or to character development other than to stay true to the original text and B: that a wife would believably keep this a secret from her husband. Second is that Marsden is so handsome and well-built that A: Skarsgard wouldn't believably be quite as insanely jealous since it's someone who's not terribly dissimilar other than, of course, his intelligence and B: when he's flailing around in the final confrontation between himself and Skarsgard (I'm not giving anything away here if you didn't think this was coming from the description of the film), it looks incredibly unrealistic and silly despite the fact that Lurie is desperate to go for realism here. Third, the catalyst of the stand-off is just such a ridiculous contrivance that I honestly find it hard to believe that someone wrote that into a major motion picture.

Lurie tries to add more substance to this film than it deserves as Marsden recounts the events of the Battle of Stalingrad to another character and discusses how it was about a very small force that held a vastly superior force at bay and even if you didn't know the story of the film already, it's such a forced story that you know that sometime before the credits roll, the story of Marsden and Bosworth will somehow parallel the soldiers of Stalingrad. THAT'S the kind of film this is. Despite all of this, Marsden still manages to pull off a mostly-convincing and strong performance, but the film doesn't allow the rest of the cast to play to their strengths. Skarsgard has some very wicked blood in him as a performer, but he can also has an incredible sense of comic timing. All this performance requires of him, though, is to be a violent backwater cliche, as also with Woods, who deserves better than this film.

It's not a complete waste of time because there are a few moments that are interesting enough from a character standpoint, and a few moments that are laugh-out-loud unintentionally funny (namely the nail gun and the bear trap) that do make this remake of STRAW DOGS kind of worth watching.",1342396800,6,5518,4.823653643083421

4891220,3,B005TK21WQ,"Let me tell you what you already know: James Marsden and Rod Lurie are not Dustin Hoffman and Sam Peckinpah.  But if there wasn't an original ""Straw Dogs"" to compare this to, this new film would be a serviceable, multi-layered thriller with some interesting performances that never decides if it was a drama or a psychological thriller or a blood-soaked home invasion film reminiscent of the ""Last House on the Left"" remake.

Unfortunately, the original does exist and its capturing of the zeitgeist and culture clash between classes was much more pronounced.  Yes, Lurie provides a suitable stand-in with these small town proto-white trash caricatures, but Marsden never feels like ""the other.""  In the original, his accent will always betray him.  He'll be American forever.  In the new one, he's just the geeky kid from school getting picked on by the bullies.  What separates them isn't the same kind of impossible gulf.

What also hurts the new one is a surprise.  Kate Bosworth gives a much stronger performance than the original's Susan George.  What worked in the original was that Susan George wasn't that strong, a delicate flower that Hoffman's character felt he was protecting.  You could understand why her personality type found something in Hoffman's intellectual.  In the remake, Bosworth is very much her own woman and her attraction to Marsden is somewhat amorphous.  I don't know what she saw in him, really, which weakens what should be the character that the entire story turns on.

One last thing.  The entire plotline of the mentally handicapped man, David Warner in the original, Dominic Purcell here, feels tacked on as if it had to be there because it was in the original and Lurie was afraid of catching heat for excising it.  It serves no real purpose here.",1340236800,,1785,4.939597315436242
4891221,1,B005TK21WQ,"I don't know why they do but after watching this movie I am thoroughly convinced to the marrow of my bones that Hollywood absolutely, positively, hates the south. I don't know why... but they do. Hollywood portrays southerners as ignorant, stupid, racist, murderous, gang-rapists, no less. I wonder if Hollywood had tried to malign some other group particularly a minority group, with the same wanton maliciousness and vengeance it uses to malign southerners, if this movie would be tolerated and its creators not ostracized and pilloried?",1339200000,10,539,5.27906976744186
4891222,3,B005TK21WQ,"I toyed with whether I should write a review for this movie, because:

1. I only watched it to get my Alexander Skarsgrd fix (True Blood season 5 is still WEEKS away and Battleship looks terrible.  I mean come on...aliens were the appropriate choice of villain, for a movie based on a strategy board game from the 60s? Really? Really??), and

2. After watching it my first thought was ""meh.""  And what good is a review if you can't think of anything to say except ""meh""?!

Once I gave it some thought though, I figured out why I thought it was ""meh,"" and it wasn't because of the acting, or the cinematography, or the general concept of the movie...it was the script.  I know this is a remake, and that Dustin Hoffman was supposed to be incredible in the original movie (I can't offer up an opinion, as I've never seen the original), but I was expecting more ""oomph"" or a more ""edge of my seat"" type of thriller, especially if it's a remake.

I will give the actors serious props for doing everything they could with the script (although as a side note, I thought Kate Bosworth and James Marsden had more chemistry as a couple in Superman Returns (please no judging that I not only just admitted to watching that movie, but recall enough of it to remember they were a couple in that movie too!)), but it's hard to produce miracles when you only have so much to work with.  Kind of like that old adage, when life hands you lemons, find someone whose life gave them vodka, and...well...actually that probably would have made the movie more entertaining, but I digress.

James Woods was almost unrecognizable as the drunken, ranting, backwoods ""Coach,"" who is so easy to hate in this movie.  He really stole the show here.  Skarsgrd was fantastic (I swear I'm not biased), and did everything he could to build up his character so the last 30 minutes or so were somewhat believable. I would have liked to hear more of a Southern accent from him though, considering this was based in the deep South.  Bosworth had the toughest job, I think, including making her actions after the rape understandable.  I know some people in other reviews have said they didn't understand why she wouldn't tell her husband about what happened, but I don't think anyone knows how they'll react when something that traumatic happens to them, especially if you take into consideration that her husband made an off-hand comment earlier in the movie that she deserved the staring and ogling if she dressed in skimpy clothes when working out.  Marsden was solid as Bosworth's husband, not phenomenal, but solid.

The biggest issue I had was there was no way the situation at the end of the movie, where Coach is trying to find his daughter, should have escalated the way it did.  It's almost like the writer realized, ""Oh crap, we only have 30 minutes left to end this movie, it's time to start killing people.""  The motivations behind Coach and the good `ol boys trying to break into Bosworth and Marsden's house were unclear, other than Coach hating the mentally challenged man, Jeremy, who Bosworth and Marsden were hiding, and yelling ""we gotta get him.""

Further, it was strange that Coach kept screaming about how Jeremy had to stay away from all women, yet the Coach's daughter thought it was safe to treat Jeremy like he was her boyfriend.  If Jeremy had done something to hurt another girl, the anger would be more understandable, but we're not given any real indication that he's dangerous apart from a vague comment at the beginning of the movie, and Coach's extreme anger towards him, but even then it's difficult to tell as Coach comes across as an angry drunk in general.  That whole plot-point just didn't gel as well as it could, and certainly wasn't strong enough to be the driving motivation for the finale.

So, while it's not the greatest movie ever, it is fairly entertaining so long as your expectations aren't too high.  And the final scenes do have plenty of action, even if the motivation behind them is rather lukewarm!",1337644800,,4016,4.6506364922206505

Honestly though, I did enjoy both versions, but the re-make surpassed it on many levels. First off, the script was more believable by today's standards-Rod Lurie's script and direction reverted back to his first peace of art known as the Contender. Second: the acting-I like James Marsden as an actor anyway, plus seeing Alexander Skargard play a different role than True Blood doesn't hurt either. I maybe in the minority with these opinions, but oh well. Both versions work well for their own merits, and in their time frame. I like stories like this, but until then I'd never seen it depicted quite this well. Would I recommend this to die-hard fans of the original?

4891225,1,B005TK21WQ,"Rod Lurie's remake of Peckinpah's 1971 masterpiece Straw Dogs should be embarrassing for all involved, especially James Woods, who must need a paycheck bad.  The 1971 original was greatly misunderstood by critics and viewers at the time of its release, with many projecting their own Procrusten Beds of ideology on the film.  To compound and confound matters, Peckinpah himself tended to deal with various criticisms piecemeal while refusing to deliniate his own concept of the film.  Thus, we have Lurie viewing Peckinpah through the lens of Robert Ardrey or Peckinpah answering feminist critics by declaring David Sumner the villain.  Lurie's remake takes a great many of these criticisms and attempts a modern PC remake.  The primitive Cornwall countryside is replaced by the Mississippi Gulf Coast, so Lurie is able to plug into the Southern stereotype, though he denies it in his commentary.  Gone are the marital problems of the Sumners, David's fascination and provoking of the local violence, Amy's flaunting of her sexual freedom to the provincials she grew up with.  Heck, in true PC fashion, even the violent locals who murder a black sheriff and attempt to kill the Sumners are themselves victims, as they are the straw dogs venerated for their high school sports prowess and then discarded upon graduation.  Like a T-Ball game with no winners or losers, the remake has no good guys or bad guys, whereas the original had no totally good guy or woman, just real humans confronted by a situation partially of their own making which they must survive, even if their marriage relationship doesn't.  I would implore anyone who has seen this 2011 remake or is contemplating seeing it to Ebay a copy of the 1971 version by Criterion Collection and first simply watch the film, then watch it again with Stephen Prince's commentary.  While I don't endorse everything Prince says about the 1971 film, most of it is spot on and you will gain the perpective and appreciation of Peckinpah's shot selections as they impact what he is trying to connote with the film.  The interviews with Hoffman, George and Melnick are likewise revealing.  After digesting the various complexities of the 1971 original, watch the 2011 remake and listen to Lurie's commentary, drawing your own conclusions.  That's the Pepsi challenge.",1336176000,32,2316,5.079155672823219
4891226,3,B005TK21WQ,"The 2 main characters, Amy and David (Kate Bosworth and James Marsden) are mildly likeable. Personally, I found Amy (Bosworth) to be passive aggresive, and childish. Combine those traits with her ever growing roster of baffling choices, and perplexing behavior (sigh)... all I can say is, hope you can suppress your gag reflex!  ** SPOILER ALERT! ** Some SPOILERS in this review! **
David and Amy are so unconvincing as a couple! Seriously, these two do not communicate at all. And their condescending actions/behavior towards one another totally reflect this. No wonder the high school boyfriend thought he could waltz back, er, boot scoot boogie his way back in. Scene after scene, they both try to one up each other. Its like they are determined to prove to the other, I KNOW the best way to deal with the mounting tension, and conflict. And the other one inevitably reacts with, ""NO, I DO!"", and so on, and so on.... geez, better grab a one way, first class, flight back to LA and get some couples counseling.
If the villains, with all of their arrogant hypocrisies, and ""this is the way we do things 'round here"" bravado, weren't SO annoying, I doubt I would have had any sympathy for Amy and David at all.
And all the unanswered questions!
 What happened with the coach's daughter? Why did she constantly throw herself at Jeremy? At first it seems she is just trying to stir up trouble, but when her dad goes after him at the bbq/picnic/hoe down thing, she appears to be genuinely upset. And when she snuck off with him during the game? She was pursuing him and it didn't seem like an act. Was she really missing?
 What about Jeremy Niles?! Why was he running across the street like he was being chased? And how did he get there so fast? If the school is close enough to their house for someone to get there in a matter of minutes on foot, didn't anyone see the fire? Smell smoke? Hear the MANY gun shots? Did the Sherrif not call it in before he went to their home? What about the ambulance they called for? Way too many implausibilities!!
James Woods was the best thing about this movie. As James Woods is usually the best thing about any film he is in. So, so believable you can't take your eyes off of him.",1334534400,,2216,4.507462686567164

4891228,5,B005TK21WQ,"Straw Dogs is a dark, menacing, can't-look-away psychological thriller. The characters are what make this film shine. David, our hero, is a hip screenwriter from Los Angeles who just entered a world only explored on paper in his screenplays, and he doesn't even know it. He is full of flavor and in love with his actress wife, Amy, a former resident of this world who escaped for higher ground. David and Amy are opposites. David is cowardly yet industrious, in love with his wife yet in love with his vocabulary. Amy is strong yet submissive, in love with her husband, yet in love with her arrogance. When a crew of locals win the bid to nail on a new roof on Amy's old house, a bubble begins to grow. David has to stand up to his wife, to the locals, to his own weakness to survive in this film. There is great contrast between his world, an agnostic, realistic world, and that of the southern locals. The problem for these locals, these ""Straw Dogs,"" is that their community is finished with them when they stop holding a football and start holding a hammer.

This adaptation to the American South is just as convincing as the 1971 film set in rural England. The film-making is tight and uses some wonderful techniques to externalize the struggle plaguing these characters. Quick cuts of the chaotic high school football game drip with terror, showing us the pain that Amy is feeling.  I particularly like the cross-cutting between the hunting scene and the scene of Amy's despair.

Many films jump days, months, or even years in time. Straw Dogs does not, which is why I like it. Particularly, the last 30 minutes of the film play out in near real-time as the bubble bursts sending fire into the air. In this 30 minutes, you will experience the destruction of man. As David says ""if they get in here, we're dead."" One of my all-times favorite films (1971 version) remade into a modern classic. -Jonathan Sturak 04/04/2012",1333497600,,1925,4.639296187683285

Not only is the story unlogical (why would this woman want to return to this town, even if she inherited her father's house? why would she insist on going to see a football match after just being raped?), but some of the actors are simply too poor to watch. Kate Bosworth must be one of the worst actresses I've ever seen on screen, and apart from playing the character implausible, there is absolutely no chemistry between her and James Marsden, who doesn't really play any better. (not one moment did I believe those two could be a married couple). The only convincing parts are played by James Woods and Alexander Skarsgard (although I have to say I saw him in better roles before (""Om Sara"", or even in ""true blood"" he is way better), and I wonder if he accepts roles like this one or the one in the upcoming ""Battleship"" just for money's sake).The movie itself is far from any real logic, and the scenes seem randomly thrown together to end in a way over the top showdown.",1332979200,6,1044,4.414507772020725

4891231,1,B005TK21WQ,"Has a very dramatic rape scene, which leaves the viewer  devastasted as Kate Bosworth gives a great performance. I think she steals the movie.

Cool and educated screenwriter returns to his wife's Southern town where she was the Cheerleader and once one of ""those Southerners."" These townfolk exist in the minds of Hollywood, and nowhere else, but it helps all liberals feel superior if they can hang a red-herring on nearly every avenue of life. In fact, being Southern is only barely civilized (or human?). Yes, these people show their true colors: insensitivity, stupidity, raging hostility, a Christianity only Hollywood can imagine, bullying, raping and murdering.

The only ""lesson"" this film could serve to give is the leeway the ""new guy"" allows these unpleasant follows to have; for example, one is a worker on the barn, yet walks into the house where Bosworth and her husband live and takes a beer from the frig. The sensitive husband does not object altho u know he would like to. If the film had played along that difficult-to-define area where one is taken advantage of, there might have been an intelligence, rather than same-ol, same-ol Black/White political dogma: ""Leave Life to the Elistists."" Those 'ordinary' people cant run this country....

So the more intelligent but trusting husband has his hot girlfriend/wife raped by the boorish and the insensitive, with the naive heroic male betrayed. While the original showed ambivalence and complexity, there's barely any room for that ""creative"" stuff here. Ah, but what a comeupance for the bad guy at the end! Havent we all seen this before? I think the Nazis made the same movies about the downside of Jews that Hollywood now makes about the South, or any and all aspects of those who might vote against their Socialist Elitism.

I have lived all over this country, and find the same culture saturates all the schools and all the cable-TV networks, and all DO think the same except for a few independent-minded people, which this film exaggerates, victimizes, twists and mocks.",1331424000,11,2047,5.008823529411765

First off, exposing herself to the rednecks didn't make much sense.  Her not telling her husband about the rapes.  And immediately after being raped insisting on going to the ballgame..because ""that's what they do in this town""???  Absolutely made no sense to me.  She would have been completely traumatized and would have insisted on getting the hell out of there as soon as possible....AFTER reporting their crimes to authorities.  Just didn't ring true for me.

Then there was that side story of the retarded man.  It was unnecessary, thus for me, made the entire build up in the tension unplausible.  The problems leading to the climax didn't even involve the main characters.  And did I miss it or what happened to the retarded man?

4891249,2,B005TK21WQ,"I would suppose this was a fine movie if it hadn't been a remake. Having recently purchased and viewed the original Straw Dogs in blu-ray I found it to be very lacking in comparison; And, being a remake it invites the inevitable comparison. One thing lacking is the palpable tension throughout the original movie. This one has the same characters and many of the very same lines and is still without the certain foreboding, tension filled atmosphere. James Woods who is scary just to look at is not as scary as Peter Vaughan. The other characters casting is in doubt as well. Dustin Hoffman was certainly more book-wormish  and out of place than James Marston as David Sumner. Even Dominic Purcell as Jeremy Niles was a stretch that I couldn't see.
***(Spoiler Alert)***
 The modernization and move to the United States didn't help any. How come when someone shoots a car they blow up immediately? The changes didn't help the movie at all.  The death of Hedden without the attack at the end was taken out and lessens the film. Dustin Hoffman was much more convincing and frantic in the hold off at the ranch. The hunting scene was very out of place. The entire change of that to deer hunting was not helpful. The rape scene was weirder as well, lacking the subtle desire versus submission. The connection of Jeremy Niles to Hedden's Daughter(Willa Holland) was not built up either and mis-cast in my opinion.
 So due to so many little things that I found lacking in comparison to the original I found it very difficult to like anything about this movie. It was like they just took all that was ""good"" about the original and left it out of it. I would give it 2 1/2 stars if I could.

The movie, though it looks action packed or even like a horror film only has action mainly towards the end of the movie. If you've read other reviews you also know that this contains a rape scene which is a little odd and also pretty graphic but doesn't last too long (at least not enough to want to stop watching). The main part of this movie I didn't care for was the husband and his attitude towards his wife. I felt like he thought she was to do as he told her to - particularly the scene at the picnic when they get back in the care (I figured this had something to do with the year the original movie was made in though). If the movie had been a bit more fast paced with a husband who actually seemed to care, this would have received five stars - the ending definitely makes it worthy.

While Lurie doesn't have Peckinpah's artistry, at least he makes Amy into an intelligent woman and not some strange, helpless girl-child. Peckinpah's Amy can't decide if she's been raped until a second rapist shows up. The choice of setting the 2011 film in the Red State American South makes a whole lot more sense than putting it in rural Wales. Peckinpah probably chickened out on this most logical choice because he had too many cracker and cowboy drinking buddies. Too bad. Strother Martin(or Warren Oates) would have been ideal as the town drunk hellbent for revenge. Not knocking James Woods 2011 interpretation, but you can tell he's not a natural southerner or country boy of any stripe.",1326240000,2,1064,4.916666666666667

On the other hand she is completely naive as to what people she has known for years are capable of, and completely oblivious to her surroundings. Tough to pull off a marquise performance when you represent a package like that.
James Wood is fabulous as the most detestable of many sorry townsfolk. The rest of the redneck ensamble is not poorly cast and there are no over the top accents. The portrayals of Southern small town life are not off base. They're just one sided. The movie's alleged brutality is way over-rated. My wife had no difficulty making it to the end. One serious plot hang up without being a spoiler. She had to know it wasn't hunting season. It is never reconciled why she let certain events transpire anyway. Does she have a darker side not plainly revealed or does the screenplay just suffer from a brain-dead moment.

4891276,2,B005TK21WQ,"Add ""Straw Dogs"" to the list of films remade by Hollywood in an effort to -- well, make more money off a known commodity.

This film represents an earnest effort, I guess, and one can appreciate the idea of moving the class warfare from England to America's Bayou Country.

Unfortunately, James Marsden is no Dustin Hoffman, and director Rod Lurie is no Sam Peckinpah.  The only person who brings anything noteworthy to this new effort is the explosive and ever watchable James Woods, playing an angry and alcoholic Southern football coach whose daughter winds up being the victim of a developmentally challenged young man.

""Straw Dogs"" is a powerful drama, to be sure, an inflammatory mix of violence, sex, and conflict between a community and its ""others,"" but it was made in 1971 by Sam Peckinpah, and that is the version you should see.  Accept no substitutes!",1325462400,7,865,4.857142857142857

I knew the movie was going to be dreadful when the leading man was prettier than his wife. Both were equally unskilled as actors however.
James Woods, an incredible actor must be in dire financial straits to have taken on a role in this ""movie"".
The only good thing about the flick is that I only paid Amazon $1.99 to rent the thing. Dreadful waste of money. I guess it did serve to employ some people but angered a lot more who were victimized into purchasing tickets to see the thing in its brief theatrical run.

4891299,1,B005TK21WQ,"Director Sam Peckinpah was a noted Hollywood maverick for his tendency to court controversy with films punctuated by explicit violence, and his 1971 film Straw Dogs is arguably the most famous of the bunch. Earlier this year, Rod Lurie wrote, produced, and directed a remake of Straw Dogs with James Marsden and Kate Bosworth in the lead roles of the victimized couple, and I was none too impressed by his efforts. Marsden and Bosworth are David and Amy Sumner, a young married couple who decide to return to Amy's Southern hometown after her father's death to help prepare the family home for sale. In doing so, they enlist the help of Amy's ex-boyfriend in fixing up the home, and lingering tensions build until David and Amy find themselves in a deadly confrontation with the locals. For what it's worth, I did feel that the remake succeeded in streamlining the original script a bit, but without the deft hand of Peckinpah at the helm, the film makes the mistake of celebrating its violence, rather than examining it. As such, I give Straw Dogs 1 star, and only those with a hankering for a bit of the old ultraviolence will find this a pleasing affair.",1325116800,8,1157,4.704433497536946

What changes: How women are treated and how they react to that treatment from the earlier version of submission to the contemporary version of independence. What doesn't change:  Idolatry persists whether it's on the field or in the pews; hatred persists whether it's race, or mental/physical disabilities. The symbolism of hunting, whether it's deer or women, to prove manhood and superiority is iconic.
An implied, and controversial, characterization of regional institutionalized intolerance as a function of mistrust of educational attainment and religious zealotry is present in both versions. What are straw dogs? They are the scapegoats, the easily discarded, the outsiders on which to place blame and thus, perhaps, release inner guilt. Guilt creates tension and the characters, both the locals and the newly arrived couple, hide but cannot escape those tensions.
Kudos to the director, cast and crew for building that tension for the audience. The actors portraying the southern antagonists did an admirable job of setting up Marsden's character and Marsden did such an effective job of portraying a wussy wimp (e.g. clumsily bumping and tripping over the most trivial obstacles; sucking up to gain stature) that my normally humanistic compassionate self was looking for to his demise.",1324944000,4,1520,5.413502109704641
4891302,4,B005TK21WQ,"STRAW DOGS  is a terrifying tale of man's inhumanity to man, terrifying in that it recreates some situations that remain active in certain parts of this country - of this world - and because it is difficult to stand as an observer to such unmitigated abuse.  There are those who decry this updated version of the story and insist on comparing it to the 1971 Sam Peckinpah original, but putting aside the original film this piece of cinema is a finely constructed work that hopefully will leave the viewer disturbed, so grisly is its message. Director Rod Lurie adapted the screenplay from the original written by Sam Peckinpah and David Zelag Goodman who molded the screen version of Gordon Williams novel 'The Siege of Trencher's Farm'.  The story has been updated and certain aspects of the characters have been changed, but this new version of Williams' novel is searingly real and brutally frightening.

The title is significant and deserves definition: `Straw dogs were used as ceremonial objects in ancient China. Chapter 5 of the Tao Te Ching begins with the lines ""Heaven and Earth are heartless / treating creatures like straw dogs"". Su Ch'e comments ""Heaven and Earth are not partial. They do not kill living things out of cruelty or give them birth out of kindness. We do the same when we make straw dogs to use in sacrifices. We dress them up and put them on the altar, but not because we love them. And when the ceremony is over, we throw them into the street, but not because we hate them.'

Screenwriter David Sumner (James Marsden) and his now-actress wife Amy (Kate Bosworth) are moving from Hollywood to Blackwater, Mississippi - Amy's hometown - to live in Amy's old homestead.  Once there they meet the charming and handsomely macho Charlie (Alexander Skarsgrd) who apparently had dated Amy before she left her home for an acting career in Hollywood.  Charlie has an evil aura but offers to help David and Amy repair their new home that has been tattered by the recent hurricane.  Charlie brings his crew - Norman (Rhys Coiro), Chris (Billy Lush) and Bic (Drew Powell) - to begin work on the Sumner home, but they are a motley crew, barging into the house for beer, and leaving early each day for hunting deer. David, who simply wants a peaceful place to write his script about the 1944 Stalingrad battle is concerned about their brazen behavior but Amy reassures him that is the Southern way: it is obvious that the crew is eyeing the scantily dressed Amy.

Visits in town include time in the bar where David encounters the crazy, lethally behaving Coach Tom Heddon (James Woods) interacting with not only his crew but also with abusive behavior to the mentally challenged Jeremy Niles (Domenic Purcell) who is protected by his brother Daniel (Walton Goggins) in the Coach's accusations that Jeremy is too close to the Coach's 15 year old daughter Janice (Willa Holland).  David takes it all in and realizes that all is not as it seems.
David and Amy try to fit in to the town - attending parties and football games - but when Charlie and crew invite David to go hunting with them and David reluctantly accepts, the gruesome part of the film begins: David kills a deer against his better judgment only to discover that Charlie and crew have deserted him in the woods and are back at David's home attacking Amy.  The action then becomes  one of protracted violence as the crew and Coach attack the Sumner home (David and Amy are protecting Jeremy from the wrath of the Coach) and the normally peace living David must become a warrior against evil.

Though the story is repugnantly similar to some life situations (and this viewer had difficulty simply watching portions of the film), the acting by everyone in the film is unusually fine.  James Marsden, Kate Bosworth, and the brilliant rising star Alexander Skarsgrd make their characters totally credible and Rod Lurie's direction is keenly sensitive to every innuendo in the film.  This is one of the strongest works on the screen and deserves a much larger audience.  Grady Harp, December 11",1324857600,4,4065,4.769230769230769
4891303,3,B005TK21WQ,"Okay so I know a lot of people are comparing this to the original version saying it's no good in comparison.  I've never seen the original so this review is going to be specifically about this movie.  I liked it.

Seriously I liked it.  The characters are good, the motivation of each character is believable, and the situations are realistic enough that it could actually happen.

My only complaints about this movie are about the two female characters.  The cheerleader girl and the wife of the main character.

***SPOILERS***

The cheerleader flirts with the mentally retarded guy even though she knows it'll get him in trouble and he'll get the crap beaten outta him by her father and the other washed up football guys.  It's like she gets off on seeing him get his ass kicked.  Also it's kinda confusing as to if he kills her by accident when he puts his hands over her face to stop her from screaming.  I know her feet stop moving, but is that cuz she passed out or because she died?  It's just a minor point of confusion but still I'd like a little clarity.

Also the wife is just plain annoying.  In one scene she tells her husband that the former football heroes were drooling over her outside and that it was making her uncomfortable and asked him to do something about it.  Yet then she goes upstairs and flashes her breasts to the same people who were just making her feel so uncomfortable.  You can't have your cake and eat it too, either you're not comfortable with them starring at you, or you are.

Then later they rape her and she yells at her husband calling him a coward and that he's not a real man.  He wasn't even there when she was raped, and if she's mad at anyone, why isn't she mad at herself for flashing them, and mad at the people who actually raped her rather than be mad at someone who wasn't even there when it happened?  Also the football guys had taken the husband out ""hunting"" to get him away from his wife.  She grew up in the area and she should have said, ""Ummm, honey, it's not hunting season and you don't have a hunting license, plus I'm not comfortable with you being with them, please stay home with me.""

4891304,2,B005TK21WQ,The story line started off interesting but later turned into a story about lies and secrets. There was no real grounds for the start of the movie just the assumption that Kate Bosworth returned home with her new husband.  It was obvious that she left for some reason in the first place.

The acting here is phoned in.  There is absolutely no chemistry between Marsden and Bosworth.  Alexander Sarsgard tries his best to carry the movie, but he can't manage it all on his own.  And it's sad to see the great James Woods chewing up the scenery as a drunken, crazed, over-the-hill high-school football coach.

The whole point of Straw Dogs is supposed to be the gory climax, but even here, the film falls short.  If you want to see a really compelling revenge movie, rent ""I Spit on Your Grave"" instead.",1324684800,,750,4.8046875

4891307,4,B005TK21WQ,"I haven't seen the original STRAW DOGS with Dustin Hoffman, so I can only offer comments on this remake.  Writer/director Rod Lurie takes his time setting up the story, moving slowly but ominously toward its violent conclusion.  Other reviewers felt torn on whom to sympathize with, a problem I didn't share.  Admittedly David's character is egotistical, judgmental and a little snooty and wife Amy a little vapid and flirtatious, but that doesn't reach the level of decadence from the locals who torment a mentally challenged young man, kill the wife's cat, assault and rape the wife and ultimately destroy the couple's home.
James Marsden as the husband has a hard time channeling the nebbish writer and the aggressive hero, but his efforts are commendable.  Kate Bosworth fills her role well, going from the flighty ex-cheerleader to the frightened victim.  TRUE BLOOD's Alexander Skarsgard is effectively chilling as Amy's former lover whose striking good looks belie a dark interior.  Dominic Purcell is good as Jeremy, the mentally challenged man whose innocent act of violence propels the film's violent climax.  Oscar nominee James Woods chews up the scenery quite well as the drunken coach who incites the locals to lawless oblivion.
STRAW DOGS is a grim movie that shows how far one man goes to protect his family and is an efficient thriller.",1324598400,3,1353,5.095022624434389

4891309,4,B005TK21WQ,"Was it his Jaguar, or his initial refusal of a he-man drink at the bar, or his lukewarm response to an invitation to go hunting? Whatever it was about the writer that antagonized the local Mississippi good ol' boys - the tension between these characters is palpable and ominous from the start.

This re-make of the famous Peckinpah movie does a good job of showing how an undercurrent of disdain can build to a tidal wave of violence. The fact that the protagonist couple is transplanted from mainstream America to the American South rather than to England is actually an improvement on the original film. It peels back the bandage of civility that often patches over the differences between northern-urban and southern-rural lifestyles, and shows some of the bitterness that is still festering underneath.

However, the movie seems to lose its way as it progresses. Was there a strong, stereotypical steal from ""Of Mice and Men"" in the original film? I don't remember the town's readiness to persecute a mentally challenged man in Peckinpah's version of this material. Here James Wood flies improbably off the handle every time he loses sight of his nubile teen daughter for even an instant. Over and over again, he starts flailing through his suspicions that the town's ""mental defective"" might have waylaid the girl. Meanwhile, the mentally challenged man stands stoically as a complete innocent. While this subplot does establish the town's readiness for violence and its readiness to find a scapegoat for everyone's sexual insecurities and floating sense of failure and rejection - it generally just drags the movie off on a tangent.

Then the movie seems to borrow heavily from another film as it winds to its conclusion. The film becomes an adult version of ""Home Alone."" When the protagonist finds he can't keep the bloodthirsty locals from invading his house with either brute force or superior fire power, he tries to win the day with all sorts of inventive, Macaulay Culkin ploys. I wouldn't exactly say this injects misplaced humor into the plot, but again, it does tend to turn raw realism into something distractingly improbable.

4891311,1,B005TK21WQ,"I would not say that I am completely opposed to remakes, just unnecessary and bad ones.  Lurie's film succeeds in being just that, bad and utterly unnecessary.  Lurie managed to not bring a single new idea to the table, instead he merely neuters the story, erasing all ambiguities and shades of gray in favor of a conventional black and white morality tale.  On record Lurie has said that he wanted to make the film from a left wing ideology in contrast to Peckinpah's right.  Well he succeeded in this endeavor.  He manages to reduce the characters and ideals to pure stereotype(the scenes in Church and the comments on God almost made me giggle out loud, not because of any alliance to religion or atheism but because Lurie's screenplay is so riddled with cliches and stereotypes).  I am neither sympathetic to the left or right, but I will say that even though Peckinpah may have been a staunch right winger, he was first and foremost an artist.  Peckinpah's ""Straw Dogs"" was a meditation on human nature and violence.  It was full of thought provoking scenes and ideas. Peckinpah at his best polarized audiences with his ideas, his films always had something to say weather you agreed or not.  Lurie's in comparison seems to be a story about a liberal yuppie moving to the South and overcoming the Republican rednecks that occupy it.  Every Southern redneck cliche you can think of you can be sure you will see in this movie.  I would take a pass on this movie.  However if you do take the plunge, watch this and pay attention to James Marsden, a fine actor really.  Then watch or re-watch the original and pay special attention to Dustin Hoffman.  I don't mean to rag on Marsden, like I said he is a fine actor, but watching Hoffman is a revelation.",1324425600,11,1754,4.616129032258065

They then hire the wife's ex-boyfriend & group of redneck friends to repair storm damage done to the barn roof. The town is small, southern, loves their high school football, everyone knows everyone & there seems to be only one cop in town. Most of the movie spends its time building towards the ending & allowing you to get to know the characters which is important. If you don't understand the dynamic between the characters, the end will make little sense. Finally we come to the ending, this is where the suspense, horror & action begins. It doesn't last very long but it does end the movie with a bang. I have not seen the original version of this movie so I can't compare it. Overall, it was an interesting psychological thriller.

4891314,3,B005TK21WQ,"Rod Lurie does change the location and time period of ""Straw Dogs,"" but the psychological aspects of the original film are almost completely lost.  Sam Peckinpah's ""Straw Dogs"" really went deep into the mentalities of the characters. David was a totally non-violent mild mannered mathematician.  Dustin Hoffman plays David as a likable guy who just wants to get his grant work done, and he is very intelligent.  The idea here is what it takes to make a pacifist turn to violence.  What is that turning point?  Hoffman's David is a layered character with real dimension and depth.  James Marsden as a somewhat egotistical Hollywood writer is really not a very likeable character.  Thus the overall impact of the new film is reduced.

Amy wanted David to be more of a man and had a stronger connection to her town, and its people, in the Peckinpah film.  She did not like, or try to protect, Henry Niles.  Her mental torment, after the crime committed against her, is fully realized in the original film.  Peckinpah envisioned her character as a confused immature individual who was unsure of what choices she should make.  She had been arguing with David for sometime before she finally started flashing her panties while stepping out of her car and removing her clothing at the window to flash the townie carpenters.  In Lurie's version, there seems to be no reason for Amy to doff her top.  Thus, she becomes very two dimensional.  There is very little depth to Kate Bosworth's characterization of Amy.

James Woods does his ""redneck thing"" effectively, but does not really seem like someone who would have the respect of his peers to make them dance to his brutal tune.  The same character in the Peckinpah film was the Cornish town's patriarch, and the viewer could understand why the younger members of the town would follow and obey him.

Anyone who has seen Sam Peckinpah's ""Straw Dogs"" would understand why the remake does not stand up the original.  The intensity of the story is greatly reduced. The irony of the story is surgically removed. One shock scene was totally removed from the remake.  Overall, the remake of ""Straw Dogs"" becomes a standard action film.",1324339200,2,2172,4.8346883468834685
4891315,4,B005TK21WQ,"Director and writer Rod Lurie resurrects the old Sam Peckinpah film from 1971 by moving it from the pretty English countryside to the backwoods of Mississippi.  James Marsden takes on the role of David, a Hollywood screenwriter for mostly TV shows.  While he's no macho man, he's not quite the nebbish mathematician played by Dustin Hoffman.  Amy this time around is played by Kate Bosworth as opposed to Susan George.  Amy is a minor league TV actress who met David on the job.  They return to her Mississippi home where popular pastimes are high school football, drinking and killing stuff.

The plot pretty much plays out like the original, so comparisons seem relevant.  Both David and Amy are much more likeable here.  Bosworth's Amy isn't quite the flirt the character was in the original.  Still, she doesn't hide her sexiness.  And while this might not be a problem in some worlds, she should know better than to flaunt it in Blackwater, especially when one of the voyeurs is a hulking 6'6"" former boyfriend (Alexander Skarsgard).  One of my observations of the controversial rape scene in the original was that Susan George seemed to still have feelings for the Charlie character and didn't fight him off with much vigor and in fact began kissing him back.  Not here, as Bosworth fights harder but eventually is overwhelmed.  The second rape by Norman is less focused  as the camera centers on Amy's suffering.  The climatic attack on the house is updated with more explosions, louder guns and the killings are a bit more explicit.

I suspect the novel's author was providing a couple moral implications to chew on.  At what point does a man crack to protect his family and home?  Do ultimately violent acts diminish man's peaceful intents?  This version doesn't seem to care about the later.  This is pretty much a revenge movie.  This isn't a great film but is the equal of the original and that in of itself is rare.",1324166400,14,1928,4.764350453172206

It's not a bad film.  It's just not one of the director's best.  I think he was more comfortable working with stories set in the American West than in rural England.

 For the most part, I don't like remakes.  But, since the original STRAW DOGS is no classic, I don't have a problem with it being remade.  On the other hand, was a remake really necessary?

 That said, I do believe that the basic story works better in this new 2011 version than in Peckinpah's picture.  Most of the changes are cosmetic, but they are improvements.

 Now set in backwoods Mississippi, the story centers on Daivd and Amy Sumner (James Marsden, Kate Bosworth), a Hollywood couple who move to Amy's family home to prepare the house for sale and so that David can have a quiet place to write his screenplay.  Once there, tensions build in their marriage and also with the locals, particularly Amy's old boy friend (Alexander Skarsgard), who resents David and wants to win her back.  Violence erupts, the Sumner home comes under siege and the quiet peace-loving David finds that he must now kill or be killed.

 Aside from the locale and the fact that the David Sumner character is now a screenwriter, rather than a mathematician, perhaps the most significant change in the this remake from writer/director Rod Lurie is that the wife, Amy, is much more sympathetic.  In the original, the character was very unlikable.

 James Woods, Dominic Purcell and Willa Holland co-star in this well-acted, suspenseful drama, now available on DVD from Sony Home Entertainment.

 DVD extras include audio commentary by Lurie, plus four ""Making of"" featurettes.""

4891317,3,B005TK21WQ,"""That boys got some man in him after all."" Screen writer David (Marsden) and his wife Amy (Bosworth) move from LA to Amy's hometown in the south. They run into one of Amy's ex's named Charlie (Skarsgard) and the tension between them starts. While David and Amy are trying to work through their problems Charlie and his friends begin to mess with David. The only way to review this to me is to think of it as two movies. The first hour and a half is pretty slow and a lot of build up to the climax. The last half hour is tense and makes you glad you kept watching. The big problem to me in this is that the person you are supposed to root for and feel bad for is David, and after ten minutes you realize he is not a likable guy and don't really feel bad at all that he is being messed with. The only person that I felt any sympathy for is a secondary character who is barely in the movie. Having only seen part of the original it's hard to compare the two, but based on the last few re-makes I would have to think the original is better. This one did have it's moments though and the last half hour makes it a decent watch. Overall, a very OK movie with an ending that saves it. The kind movie where you aren't sure who to root for though. I give it a B-.",1323388800,3,1254,4.0

However this movie is excellent in it's own way without being compared to the original.  I thought Kate Bosworth and James Marsden were perfect as David and Amy Sumner. Also Alexander Skarsgard did an excellent portrayl as Charle.  The movie was tense and a bit shocking,I wouldn't recommend it to everyone, however if you enjoy this sort of thing, get it.  The movie is extremely well done with an excellent cast!!!",1322438400,2,546,4.43

I suppose if your idea of red neck culture is to combine football, religion, sex, and hunting, this may be your film, but it just doesn't have anything new to say and the impact of the sex and violence in the original far exceeds anything in this.

4891331,5,B005TK21WQ,"James Marsden plays David Sumner, a screenwriter from California, who makes the move to Mississippi with his girlfriend Amy(Kate Bosworth). This is her hometown, but its all too foreign to David. The secluded property and beautiful background seem an ideal place for him to finish work on his Stalingrad project. It doesn't take long for this thought to diminish from his mind.

As much as David tries to mix with the locals and feel a part of the community, theres always something that doesn't work. Theres several times in the film where he goes out of his way to be courteous, but the locals don't seem to like an outsider in their town. A rich, clean cut outsider to be precise. This film builds an ominous tone very well through the course of the story. While the film feeds off the differences between David and the locals, it also shows David changing in his own way later in the film. Amy's(Bosworth) ex-boyfriend Charlie (Skarsgard)enters the picture early and often in the young couple's life. Skarsgard really does a nice job with his character. You never have a good feeling about Charlie from the first frame, when he starts in on Amy, as David gets a beer at the bar. The situation worsens when he is hired to repair the roof to David and Amy's home. That puts Charlie and his hunting/roofing buddies too close to the couples everyday life. James Woods is very good as well in portraying ""coach"" a beer drinking, raucous legend in the small town. It seems everyone in the town played for coach in the past and he has the respect of most. The coach has his own issues with his daughter and a mentally challenged man. This adds another level of brooding to the story. Another factor is the difference in ideals and beliefs between David and Amy. The couple clearly love each other, but its not a rock solid foundation. The movie continues with a good pace, without any moments of dullness. These storylines set up a brutal, climatic ending.

There are several uncomfortable scenes and shocking ones as well. This is not for everyone. That includes a rape scene. The film overall is well done. I think Marsden/Bosworth/Woods/Skarsgard are excellent in the film. There are some well filmed scenes in this one. Including a few with a deer. Although many will compare this to the 1971 classic, this movie has a different setting and an updated story. I like both movies. For me, they're both good in their own way. I would give it 4 1/2 stars, so I picked 5- because it entertained throughout.",1320192000,49,2502,4.658371040723982
4891332,1,B005TK21WQ,"I went to see this movie on opening night, I was expecting a really good horror movie, but that's not what I got!  First of all, the movie is incredibly slow and it just kept getting dragged out.  The previews for this movie made it look intense and action filled, but in reality most of that action occurs in the last 10-15 minutes of the movie.  Second of all, I didn't really find any of the characters to be likable....not even the main characters they seemed idiotic and somewhat pompous.  The ending was also terrible!  Everyone in the theater with me was incredibly disappointed with the film; I never heard one positive thing about the movie from anyone in the audience.

4891334,4,B005TK21WQ,"This is a remake of Sam Peckenpahs 1971's Straw Dogs, a classic film about a pacifist mathematician, David Summner, who flees riot and protest ridden America to live in rural England. He seeks to repair his strained marriage, by moving back to Amy's, his wife, home town. Instead, he is bullied by local villagers who eventually rape his wife and storm his house. He kills all of them using hot acid, a fireplace poker, and a bear trap.

Ron Lurie's remake of the film keeps the plot elements, but makes several character and thematic changes. Here, the wife is from the deep south, and David is a screenwriter. Obviously the campus turmoil of the 1971 version was not a reason for David's moving to the south in 2011, so the implication of him ""hiding"" is not here.

But how the rape is handled is to me the key shift. In the 1971 version, Amy had more of a history, and sexual energy. with Charlie, one of the men who rapes her. Sexist as it today sounds, the first rape-which Amy eventually submits to, kissing and caressing Charlie-- was filmed show Amy had mixed feelings about Charlie, and her loyalty to David. David slaps Amy in the first film when she is about to dart to the other side, and this makes her role, and David's actions, that much more ambiguous and disturbing.

I understand Lurie's impulse to resist making rape erotic and emotionally ambivalent--this is what made Peckenpah's film so controversial in its era- but real world right and wrong does not make for compelling film. Lurie has sacrificed artistically rewarding gray areas for politically safe black and white. Amy's rape here is strictly a violation, and pits the men against Amy and David. Good verses evil. When the final confrontation comes, Amy's loyalties are clearly to David. She is not used as a pawn in the battle as the character was in 1971. Instead is delivered the mentally lazy, heroes and villains action fare that is such lower a target then Straw Dogs aims for.

It's production values lift it above a simple revenge flick, but Straw Dogs 2011 gives you dime-a-dozen cinematic vindication, where 1971's version leaves you with nothing but disturbing questions. The two films are as different as the times. You don't come away from this thinking about what it means and what the cost is when violence is needed--after 9/11? Iraq? There is no bigger context here, and that makes this an entertaining under-reach: frustrating when a film about the role of violence, made in the ""age of terror"" could have been as thought provoking about our times as Peckenpah's was about Vietnam and Watts and Kent State. Lurie has frustratingly chosen high entertainment over what could have been searing high art.",1317081600,3,2697,4.7687366167023555
4891335,3,B005TK21WQ,"""Straw Dogs"" (2011) is full of disturbing themes and images. There is  symbolism and juxtaposition everywhere; with visual connections being made between hunting, rape, football, and several other ""violent"" situations. I'm told that Sam Peckinpah's 1971 original film is far more disturbing and violent. I never saw it, but my brother, who did see it, informed me it was about Dustin Hoffman as David, a nerdy mathmatician with a beautiful wife who is pushed to violent extremes in the English countryside. After seeing this 2011 re-make, I have zero desire to see Peckinpah's ""more disturbing/violent"" original. Director Rod Lurie may not be Peckinpah, but his version is disturbing enough for me.
  Lurie's remake moves the action from the English countryside to some Southern hick town. Hoffman's nerdy mathmetician David is now nerdy Hollywood screenwriter David, played by James Marsden. David returns with his hot actress wife Amy (Kate Bosworth) to the Southern town she grew up in. They plan to live in a delapidated old country house Amy's father left her. From the moment David steps foot into the local bar, Amy's ex-boyfriend Charlie (Alexander Skargard) and his redneck pals hate him. The first part of the movie is long, brooding, simmering tension between David/Amy, Amy/Charlie and David/Charlie ;  before the final battle between David's passive, Hollywood nerd and the local rednecks. The initial set-up is simple: David and Amy's country house needs fixing. Charlie and his redneck pals are hired to fix it, of course.
  Amy tells David that the workers are leering at her. He causually remarks, ""Well... maybe if you wore a bra."" What kind of a husband says that to his wife? Amy's replies  , ""I dress for you, David""  and then goes  upstairs and partially undresses  with her window open; in full view of Charlie and the leering workers,  who leer at her some more. I assume Amy did this strip tease because she is angry at David for his remark about her not wearing a bra? Oh, Amy's cat is killed for no good reason. The cat is discovered hanging dead in the bedroom closet!!
  David is lured away on a phoney hunting expedition; so Charlie and another redneck can rape Amy. Amy's rape is disturbingly intercut with scenes of David out hunting. David kills a deer for no good reason. This seems to suggest that David is no better than Charlie and the redneck locals who hate him; so you might think the movie is going somewhere, thematically, here.
  You would think that Amy's rape would be the thing that causes David to finally go berserk on the locals. But Amy never mentions her rape to him. The final violent act is motivated by a subplot involving a mentally disabled guy, who accidentally kills the daughter of the football coach (James Woods). David and Amy literally run into the disoriented, disabled guy, who seems to have some unspecified form of autism, and take him to their country house. Woods and Skarsgard get a lynch mob and head out to the house. Logic flies out the window as the final act is just all-out violence. The movie actually begins to lose its logic when Amy starts to undress by the open window, long before the final violent act.  Marsden is physically outmatched by the more strapping and threatening Skarsgard, but that's part of what makes their final showdown interesting.
  Yes, here's the catch: ""Straw Dogs"" is disturbing, but it is never boring. The movie manages to be ""just interesting enough"" to keep you watching, even if you don't want to.  That's why I'm giving ""Straw Dogs"" three stars.  Kate Bosworth's Amy is all ambiguity. But you can practically see the inner conflict whirling around inside James Marsden's head; that is, until it all comes bursting out. And Alexander Skarsgard projects just the right amount of sinister menace.",1316995200,,3805,4.888024883359254

4891337,3,B005TK21WQ,"I decided to watch the original Straw Dogs about a month ago since I knew I would be seeing this remake in theaters. I didn't love the 1971 version starring Dustin Hoffman, but for the time it was released it was very brutal and I got the point the director was trying to make. This telling of Straw Dogs is basically a copy, other than the fact that it's a town full of stereo typical rednecks. You know, a screenwriter and his hot actress wife move into her dad's house after his death. She grew up in this isolated town and her old boyfriend and his buddies spend more time drooling over her than working on the barn roof they were hired for. Things get pushed too far and wimpy screenwriter unleashes Home Alone trap style hell on them.

The acting is one of the better aspects of the movie. James Marsden and Kate Bosworth (beautiful, but it wouldn't hurt for her to gain 15 pounds) do the best work of their careers here. Both are very believable, as is the leader of the bad guy gang, Alexander Skarsgard, of True Blood fame. James Woods even shows up to play the town drunk and unofficial town leader with a mean streak.

The first 3/4 of the movie is just a slow build up to the final 1/4 bloodbath. The rape scene isn't graphic as say The Last House on the Left, I Spit on Your Grave or even the original Straw Dogs, but that doesn't make it any easier to watch. The violence at the end is gory, though it smartly doesn't stray from realism.

I would compare this to The Last House on the Left remake. At least both didn't try to water things down in order to get a PG-13 rating, but there is really no need to rush out and see something that is an 85% copy of 40-year-old film.",1316217600,,1688,4.219814241486068
