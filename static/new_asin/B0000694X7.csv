1731434,5,B0000694X7,"I think that perhaps the people who reviewed this film negatively simply don't see it the way I do. I don't claim to know what the director had in mind, but I know what I take from this movie. I am NOT a golfer, but this film leaves me with an appreciation for golf which I have never before felt. Bagger Vance was okay, but more an entertaining film than a study of golf. Nor is A Gentleman's Game all about golf. There's a lot going on here, some of it is about golfing, some of it deals with the inside, or other side of the game, the ""loopers."" Ultimately this movie is not about golfing, even though it chiefly centers on golfing and around a golf course. The overall story comes together with meaning greater than its several individual parts. Gary Sinise never dissapoints & the entire cast delivers wonderfully in this film, but Mason Gamble is the one to watch. A very talented young actor. I am reminded of Kevin Spacey in Shipping News, wherein Spacey virtually tells the entire movie with his facial expressions. Gamble does not quite have as demanding a role here as Spacey had in Shipping News, but he does remarkably well with what he's given---& considering his age that's all the more impressive. We easily know what his character, Timmy, is feeling at all times without having to hear any dialog. Mason Gamble has been around a while, & I'm sure will have no trouble remaining in the industry as long as he chooses to keep making movies. Look for him in the quirky Rushmore, or in the hook-setting opening scene of Arlington Road, & periodically thereafter throughout. I believe he was also Dennis the Mennace, & I'm sure he's done a few other films.  I like gentleman's Game because it tells a story that centers around something I previously cared nothing about; now I at least have some appreciation for, and a much greater understanding of, golf. It's a good movie, and it's deffinately telling a worth while story. Plus it had the added bonus for me of coming as an unexpected surprise treat when I first saw it. (I had a cheap rental coupon & never hearing of it before, happened upon it while browsing in Hollywood Video) I reccomend this movie as a great one to watch and a good one to own.",1067731200,23,2216,4.4987593052109185
1731435,4,B0000694X7,"There is much in this golf based movie.  The much is its asset and liability.  There are too many plots which don't tie together well, and confuse the viewer.  Father/son, poor/rich, etc.
What does come out shining is a young boy's love for the game pure and simple.  Wealth covering up problems and a morally sound burnt out golf champion.  If the director would have just revolved it around this, it would have been more attractive.
As is, a memorable view.  The profanity is dominate.  Maybe it has to be.  Do we need so much to make a point?",1041292800,10,545,4.434343434343434
1731436,3,B0000694X7,"This is not really a film about golf, but a film about life with golf as the backdrop.  Therein lies the problem.  First time director J. Mills Goodloe can't seem to choose where he wants to go with the story and it meanders aimlessly from storyline to storyline in an attempt to give it a coming-of-age flavor.
He would have been better to concentrate on Timmy (Mason Gamble) and his relationship with Foster (Gary Sinise) in his quest to improve his golf game.  This is clearly the best and most interesting element of the story.  Instead he flits about following Timmy's relationship with the other loopers, his infatuation with the beverage girl and the happenings at various club events.  The relationship between Timmy and Foster never really gets much traction until the final scene and even then the validation is delivered via a letter rather than a face to face encounter, which would have made it poignant and satisfying.
The acting by Mason Gamble and Gary Sinise is excellent.  They have good chemistry and it is clear they connect.  Gamble gives a very steady performance throughout and gives the character a naive charm and steely resolve that are extremely engaging.  Sinise plays a stolid and standoffish character harboring a terrible secret and bitter disappointment.  His understated performance is a perfect fit for this complex character whose cavalier nature hides deeper turmoil.  The rest of the cast is simply terrible.  Dylan Baker is horrible as Timmy's dad.  Phillip Baker Hall is awful as the two faced Charlie Logan.
This film had great potential that was never realized.  I rated it 5/10.  It should have stayed with the golf story rather than dissipate itself on the other less interesting elements.",1032307200,6,1732,4.96875

The viciousness of racial prejudice,and the exploitation of a young boy is shocking in such a pristine environment!

1731458,1,B0000694X7,"I am a bit perplexed reading some of the positive reviews of this film.  I spent an agonizing hour and fifty eight minutes wondering where the film was going, what it had to do with golf, and how many sappy clich-ridden storylines could you throw together.  Spoiler alert...just because Gary Sinese is in a film, does not meaning the film is a gem.

Spoiler alerts abound to follow...see if you can follow.

""A Gentleman's Game"" is a convoluted story of a young man who grows up to enjoy the game of golf...for the purity of it all.  He learns his natural swing by whacking balls into the ocean while former golfer, turned Yoda, Gary Sinese sits by and tells the kid that he won't help him.

Cut away from that storyline, which may be the real storyline, and you have the father who teachers his son the morals of golf, yet walks away from his son on the driving range when he can't show him what he learned at a lesson.  His father later goes against his son, for reasons unknown, in a tournament where a father commits a penalty by pointing out the line for his son by grounding the flag on the putting service.  This is a penalty in golf.  But the ignorant father bullies little Timmy and accuses Timmy of calling him a liar.  Timmy's father shrinks and basically tells Timmy to back off.  Silly.

Next, there is the little love/romance deal where Timmy is enamored with a 15 year old gal from the club.  He likes her a lot and tells her so by telling her she ""smells good"".  The girl goes skinny dipping without him and comes to respect Timmy because he doesn't jump in with her.  Quite a romantic story  She put her hand on his shoulder.

Next there is Phillip Baker Hall, who plays a sage old member of the golf club.  He is enamored with Timmy's beautiful, pure golf swing.  But later he plays in a member guest tournament...supposedly vying for the title, despite a putrid swing... where he completely ignores Timmy and then goes onto a drinking binge which ultimately culminates in him ripping into his black caddy with a series of racial slurs.  Timmy's dad steps forward and tells him to shut up...AFTER the caddy walks off the course in shame.  Is this the ""gentleman's game""?

Oh yeah... a caddy whose thumbs were blown off when his parents gave him a firecracker doesn't show up for work for a while and we come to find out that the head of the country club had him out back in the swimming pool and took pictures of him and touched him and he was upset and his dad was upset.  Dramatic gunshots ring out....AND....the father of the boy with no thumbs shot into the Rolls Royce of the pedophile.  Timmy states that the caddy won't be coming back and he's not his friend.  Cut to: club where the voiceover tells us no charges were filed and no one arrested.

I am an avid golfer.  This film has zero to do about golf.  Perhaps on really superficial, kindergarten levels, the story has something to do with the lessons of golf.  But to get to those lessons, you must first come up with the lesson to be learned and then try to work backwards and imply how the film speaks to these issues...varied and wide-ranging and lacking any kind of continuity.

1731466,2,B0000694X7,"A previous review back in 2002,(it is now 2011), by ""flickjunkie"",
 was most accurate! This movie left me totally frustrated for ALL
 the same reasons that he listed:
 poorly-developed plots, unconnected relationships, POOR depiction
 of dad, terrible racist commentary, absolutely un-realized
 potential in script...etc.

I, personally, LOVE golf....but I HATED this film's filthy language
 and insinuations which were portrayed as a seemingly necessary part
 of the playing of the game and of its participants.
My favorite uncle was a (PGA) professional golfer my entire life
 (I'm now 71), and he is in the Arkansas Hall of Fame, yet he NEVER
  had such an unsavory environment in which to perform his trade
  as was depicted in this movie.

In addition, in all my years of golfing, I have never been partnered
  with golfers nor had to endure such attitudes and dispositions as
  shown in this movie.
Certainly, there are times of great frustration in the process of
 golfing... but for this film's directors, producers, etc, to presume
 upon a viewer of this movie that those individuals experiencing
 these frustrations would allow them to lead to such reprehensible
 behavior before or toward others is unforgiveable.

They violated the very PREMISE of the title of the movie...
  that, ""Golf Is A Gentleman's Game""!!!
Such a disappointment!
  No REAL man, no true 'gentleman'
  would EVER behave in such a manner...
  especially before, much less toward, his own son!
nor allow others in their group to do so.

Therefore, I would never be able to recommend that this movie be
  viewed by anyone who might be vulnerable as to its overall impact
  on them deciding to take up the game.",1298937600,,1691,5.0218181818181815
1731467,4,B0000694X7,"This is really a great movie about how a kid learns through his life about the game of golf and how hard it is to become a winner in not just golf, but in life. The storyline is typical of how hard it was for the middleclass to afford the dues at a country club years ago.

I will watch the movie again and know that I don't rewatch anything that is not good... The rules of the game and just being honest comes out in this movie...
It is well worth the price I paid!!! It shows that cheating in the game of golf is not worth the headache. Doing so will stay as a bad memory with you for a lifetime... (that is if you are human and have somewhat of a brain).",1272240000,,658,3.8740740740740742
1731468,4,B0000694X7,"What I take from this movie is the message that it IS possible for the dazzle of success and fame to cloud your judgment.  The lasting message is not about golf.  It is about seeking what you want to achieve for yourself, and not for the enhancement of other people's egos.  I don't want to spoil the plot line for those who have not seen it yet.  But if you have seen this film, hopefully you know what I mean.
The story is done with a light hand, not relying on overly dramatic posturing for the camera.  Mason Gamble does an excellent job of showing the pure joy of a personal success (perfecting the golf swing), to the disappointment he feels from his father, to the sadness of what happens to his fellow caddy buddy, to the blushes of first lust.  Gary Sinise is as understated as usual, a lot of what he has to say at the end of the movie coming from his body language and facial expressions rather than from dialogue.
I found it to be a feel good movie, and I recommend it for a rainy or snowy afternoon.",1258502400,2,1012,4.217616580310881
1731469,4,B0000694X7,"""A Gentleman's Game"" is a great movie, with great acting from the principle cast, especially Gary Sinise. The only two flaws I can point out are:-
1) The character of Molly is miscast.
2) A little too much swearing that conceals the sweet nature of the film.
I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good film, even if you aren't a big golf fan, which, by the way, I wasn't, yet I still found it enjoyable!!!!",1251417600,,420,4.329113924050633
1731470,1,B0000694X7,"I'm both a golfer and a movie buff.  Caddyshack, Happy Gilmore, and Stroke of Genius are the exceptions.  Most golf movies are pretty bad.  Until I saw ""A Gentleman's Game"", I thought Caddyshack 2 took the cake--no more.  Is this movie about an aspiring young golfer, a comback story, an overbearing father story, a drunk racist story, a depressed mother story, a teen love affair story, or a sexual abuse story?  I don't know.  This movie tries to be all of these at random times.  In my opinion, this isn't just the worst golf movie ever, it's one of the worst movies I ever sat through.

Timmy Price, and only child listens as his father teaches him ""A Gentleman's Game"" How relevant it is to take care of your things.  This is hard to stomach seeing that it appears Dad, is a pushover.  Price is an accountant, who has invested a nice sum to join a prestigious country club.  He decides that maybe Timmy could learn how to play golf.  Before seeing if he had a niche for it, decides maybe being a caddy would be more fruitful.

Unbeknownst to dad, Timmy Price (Mason Gamble) seems to have a promising future in golf and it's not long before he's considered ""a trophy."" Foster considered one of the elite golfer's in his day is a golf teacher.  As Timmy seeks him out he learns small trades from him, and they grow as friends with the other helping the other to make transitions in the others life.

Timmy and his father have somewhat of a strained relationship, and it seems that as his golf improves it helps the two connect.  Dad is also given the opportunity to reestablish himself in his son's eyes as he finally stands up instead of being intimidated by the ""HAVE'S!""

7965401,2,B0000694X7,"Really good character actors, but the very flawed screenplay constantly distracts you with incongruities. Throughout I wondered. ""Where are we going with this?""  Each scene seems strange and adds to a hodgepodge of scenes with puzzling relationship.  When you find out how the threads connect, you feel cheated by overly contrived subplots.  All to justify the theme - the (boy) boy's ""swing is pure""; everyone else is unusually, bizarrely flawed.  It feels surreal in an unintended way like some wacky over-the-top, neighborhood legend that doesn't make any sense -- You wish you hadn't wasted your time listening.

""The Greatest Game Ever Played"" was much better with many similar sub-conflicts ( coming of age/growth, competition, father-son conflict, prejudice/resisting stations in life, standing up to power, teamwork/friendship, integrity, golf).  Had the GG screenplay focused on golf's self-regulated ethical behavior and integrity in a simpler way it would have had a chance.
