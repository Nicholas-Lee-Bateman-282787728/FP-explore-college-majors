His 'fiancee' dumps him for a guy with money.  He goes on a downward spiral.  His old college friend finds him 20 years later and rehabilitates him.  They go to their college reunion where he meets a lovely girl that he first mistook for his old fiance.  They fall in love.  He discovers that she is his old fiance's daughter only this girls has all of the lovely qualities that her mother did not have.  Her mother tries to bully JMB's character into taking her away from her boring husband, but he refuses.  Then he makes the ultimate sacrifice to save their whole family from destruction.  I will have to let a little time pass before I can watch it again.",1372723200,,792,4.3493150684931505
