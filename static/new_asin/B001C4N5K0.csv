3505488,5,B001C4N5K0,"Contrary to popular belief.  War is not pretty.  War does not create heros.  War leaves no one untouched.  For any parent thinking their sons or daughters can go to war and come back relatively unscathed, think again.

War does two things very well...it creates orphans and it creates children.  Tomas is one of those children.  Tomas came back from Iraq and now depends on this mother and others to take care of him.  No scene says this more than mom helping Tomas insert a cath in the back of their van.

Tomas has no choice anymore.  He is a child in his mother's care just as much as any new born would be.

To watch Tomas struggle so much after proudly serving his country is beyond sad.  To watch Tomas struggle just to get the medical and attention he deserves from the US is also beyond sad.

UPDATE:  upon learning of the death of Tomas Young, i decided to revisit this film.  Still just as impactful after the intensity of anti-war efforts have died down.  What I had totally forgotten were the efforts of Sen. Robert Byrd  to talk some sense into his fellow senators.

RIP Tomas.  You are a hero in my eyes, not for going to war and taking a bullet, but for returning home and not shying away from showing everyone the horrific aftermath of war.",1241136000,15,1256,4.406113537117904
3505489,4,B001C4N5K0,"""Body Of War"" is a tough, heartfelt documentary that focuses on those who are directly hit by a government's war policies: The soldiers. Yes, it is true that George W. Bush has left the White House, but Barack Obama is preparing to expand the war in Afghanistan and is reportedly planning to keep up to 50,000 troops in Iraq even after a proposed 19 month pullout. So Americans can expect to continue debating our current status as a country at war. However Tomas Young's story might make a viewer think twice about supporting the continuation of the current war policies.

Young was a young American naturally enraged by the September 11 terrorist attacks, watching Dubya rally the troops from the top of the World Trade Center wreckage, Young's patriotism was awakened and he enlisted in the army. Barely seven days into his service in Iraq, Young was shot and paralyzed. ""Body Of War"" captures Young's physical and mental struggles, and shows us a veteran returning home to discover that his government basically swindled the country into war, using lies and propaganda to invade Iraq. Like Ron Kovic of ""Born On The Fourth Of July,"" Young joins the antiwar movement and uses his story to spread truth.

Directors Phil Donahue and Ellen Spiro have crafted here an interesting document of a dark, divisive time in American history. Without having to resort to the more detailed, grand scale of films like ""Why We Fight"" or ""Fahrenheit 9/11,"" they capture the human side of the suffering and raging debate the Iraq war has caused. We see the differences in public opinion even in Young's family: His mother has become an intense antiwar protester while his father remains a staunch right-wing Republican, a fan of Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity. Even Young's younger brother signs up and ships out to Iraq. This is fascinating material and even a source of one of the film's weaknesses, that we don't explore these themes more, that they are kept more in the background.

What is kept in focus however, is harrowing. We see Young struggle just to live a daily life, punctuated by pain, fear, anger and sometimes humiliation. The film doesn't just show us Young in a wheelchair, it gives us an in-depth look at how a man in his condition lives, the daily battles he faces even when it comes to sex or something we all take for granted like being able to simply go to the bathroom. There are some powerful moments where Young goes on tour to protest the war, but struggles to speak in public because he has little control over his body temprature.

In a brilliant editing choice, the directors intercut Young's story with the historic Senate vote that gave Bush full authority to invade Iraq. We see a roll call of all the politicians who supported the war, Republican and Democrat (two, Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton, currently hold major positions of power in the new administration). Here we see how what is approved by those in the corridors of power can have catastrophic consequences for the average citizen. There is also some intercutting of footage showing Bush's massive propaganda about Saddam Hussein and how those in Congress recycled accusations that today would sound hilarious or ridiculous if they hadn't lead to such tragedy.

Is ""Body Of War"" biased? Absolutely. It is a film full of outrage, the outrage of a young man who decided to serve his country and discovered he was maimed for lies. Pearl Jam vocalist Eddie Vedder provides some excellent songs with a beautiful, classic folk bent. ""Body Of War"" may anger some for its opinions, but they are opinions that not so long ago, were almost dangerous to utter in the United States. In a time of war, who better to listen to than to those who actually fought? Yes, I know, there are other soldiers with a difference of opinion, without a doubt, but this is a film about a soldier who lost a great deal and is angry over what he lost it for. ""Body Of War"" is a film that truly carries an American spirit.",1235606400,14,3973,4.7272727272727275
3505490,5,B001C4N5K0,"""We're gonna find the evildoers, and smoke 'em outta their hole!""

Just after the tragic events of 9/11, President Bush tries to rally the troops and prepare the country for war. Fueled by patriotism, Tomas Young calls his recruiter, anxious to do his part for America.
After being trained, he becomes startled as he soon learns he's getting shipped to Iraq instead of Afghanistan. And once there, his life quickly gets shattered. An Iraqi bullet left him paralyzed from the chest down.
He's eventually shipped back home to Kansas City, MO, given a medal, and quickly forgotten about by the people that sent him overseas.  It's a terrible shame.

This documentary concentrates on his life after the injury. It's a shocking, eye-opening experience. Tomas speaks out against the war, while struggling severely with his injury and the mental burden he's forced to carry.  He joins VATW(Veterans Against The War) and beckons our political leaders for answers.

Body of War is directed by Phil Donahue. It includes a powerful soundtrack by Eddie Vedder.
Plus, it shows real footage of Senators, such as McCain and Mrs. Clinton, speaking for the war cause just after 9/11.
One very interesting note, several Black leaders spoke out against the war in Iraq, warning us of the financial crisis and unfounded reasons behind such actions. Their voices went unheard.

3505497,5,B001C4N5K0,"As I write this in August 2008, the documentary BODY OF WAR has yet to find wide release in movie theaters.  I saw the film at an independent screening that included an appearance by director Phil Donahue.  According to Mr. Donahue, because of previously unsuccessful films dealing with the current Iraq war/occupation distributors passed on this story of Tomas Young, an American soldier a bullet paralyzes.

The fate of BODY OF WAR reflects the reason the failed Iraq conflict continues.  Most Americans know there is no good explanation for invading and occupying Iraq.  Yet too few protest and even fewer appear willing to even see a movie about it.  Tens of thousands die and millions suffer but it does not seem to affect Americans enough for the tragedy to end.

America invaded Iraq because many in Congress and other positions of power turned blind eyes and deaf ears to the Bush administration's lies.  Today almost everyone wants it to stop, yet those same men and women in authority let the violence carry on.  As long as too many Americans seemingly do little more than wish the Iraq disaster would go away, it won't.

Thus it is no surprise to see BODY OF WAR passages depicting the poor health care Tomas Young and other Iraq veterans receive from the government.  Just as George W. Bush doesn't want the public to see coffins with a return address ""Iraq,"" Congress and he give the wounded soldiers as little attention as possible.  Bush and Congress continue spending billions on death and destruction but Mr. Young receives such insufficient help from the country he served, it falls on his wife and mother to get him through the day.  And while no force is stronger than a woman's love, BODY OF WAR shows us even that can't pick up the slack for an American government that won't take care of the individuals it sends to war.

At the June 25, 2008, BODY OF WAR screening I attended, Phil Donahue said Tomas Young was struggling with his health.  Here's wishing Mr. Young the best and hoping it will not take one more death for BODY OF WAR to find the audience it deserves - and for American soldiers to finally come home.

3505498,4,B001C4N5K0,"On Monday, May 30th 2011 Americans will commemorate  Memorial Day, an annual observation of Americans who have died in war. But how best to observe Memorial Day (which, incidentally, doubles as the unofficial start of summer)?

First, lets consider how not to commemorate it. I suggest you avoid going to city park, getting sloshed on a case of beer, and then driving into your neighbors mail box on the way home. (I take it there will not be much controversy that this scenario is best avoided. Alas, despite this fact, surprising numbers of Americans will end up doing something much like that.)

So how should you commemorate Memorial Day? I suggest you do so by telling (or listening to) stories of great soldiers. But I don't mean listening to propagandistic narratives of victory and valor that blur national sins and cover up the personal cost. Rather, I suggest you tell or listen to real stories, true stories that count the cost of war.

Like what, you ask? Well you might start with a public showing of the 2007 documentary Body of War directed by Ellen Spiro and Phil Donahue (yes, that Donahue). The film tells the story of Tomas Young, a veteran of the Iraq War who returns from Iraq paralyzed and must now learn to survive in a crippled body even as he begins to question the war in which he served.

Typically wounded veterans like Young are rolled onto stage at Memorial Day and 4th of July events just long enough to receive a round of applause. It is a shameful game of exploitation that masks people from the true impact of war. Body of War is unflinching in communicating what happens after the gimps are rolled off stage. Over and over the viewer is forced to realize the full impact of war, and it aint pretty. It is quite surprising to realize how a body is impacted in countless unforeseen ways by a major injury like paralysis. For example, given his paralysis Young is now unable to empty his bladder completely and thus needs the help of volunteers  including his own mother  to insert a catheter into his penis several times a day so the urine can be drained out. And he can no longer regulate his body temperature and is subject to dizziness and fainting spells. And never mind the long list of pills he must take on a daily basis. This is now his life.

We have heard much over the last few years about the cost of the Iraq War. In monetary terms economist Joe Stiglitz famously estimated the total cumulative cost at being three trillion dollars. But thats just a dollar value ascribed to things that can be counted. Whats the cost to the life of Tomas Young? Youd never guess if you just saw him wheeled for two minutes onto stage to wave and smile. After watching Body of War you're still not sure how much the war cost Tomas Young. But you do know one thing: it is more than you can count.

The over-simplification of issues was troubling.  The editing was misleading.  In that regard, I believe that this film suffers from some of the same problems as Michael Moore's movies.

I have learned that Tomas wishes to end his life due to his ongoing medical problems.  If he decides to go through with this, I hope his experience is as peaceful and pain-free as possible.",1365811200,,635,4.666666666666667

3505503,5,B001C4N5K0,"Army private Tomas Young was shot in the spine and paralyzed in 2004 -- 5 days after starting his tour of Iraq. This documentary tells the story of his day-to-day life, his loves and frustrations, and his opposition to the Iraq War. The film is a paean to Young, but also to the minority of Senators and Congress people who opposed giving George W. Bush a blank check to prosecute the war on any terms he desired. The late Senator Robert Byrd, that great defender of the Constitution, comes in for special accolades. Watching his impassioned speeches from the Senate Floor (while others, including Hillary Clinton and John Kerry) merely parroted the lies of the Bush administration, made me realize how few impassioned, articulate patriots there are in leadership. Watching our congressional representatives struggle valiantly to prevent the war, as the ""aye"" count racks up, is demoralizing and sad.

The film's weakness is in its arguments about the war, which it presumes is pointless, wrong-headed and wasteful. The arguments are mostly emotional, not political or policy-driven: parents and wives should not have to sacrifice their children;  people shouldn't die in war; it's terrible that soldiers suffer lifetime injuries. But this is not a film to discuss the whys and wherefore of the Iraq War. Its purpose is to show us the difficulty of a life in a wheelchair, and of the courage of people like Young to speak out against the war in spite of those difficulties

If you accept the premise, and I do, that the war in Iraq was ill-conceived, poorly planned and badly executed, then the film's air of tragedy makes sense and doesn't need to be explained. But if you want to know why Iraq--with its $2 trillion price tag and its legacy of death and injury--was a bad idea, you'll have to look elsewhere. Still, ""Body of War"" is a great film for what it is, and more poignant given recent reports that Young plans to deliberately end his pain-wracked existence in a few weeks.",1363737600,4,1982,4.823529411764706
3505504,5,B001C4N5K0,"Body of War is a powerful, must see video. It tells the story of Tomas Young from Kansas City, Missouri who enlisted to fight in the Iraq War after President Bush stood on the wreckage of 9/11 and said ""Bring 'em on.""

After just five days of deployment in Iraq, Tomas was shot by a sniper while riding in an open-top truck. ""We were sitting ducks,"" Tomas said. He is wounded and permanently paralyzed from the waist down.

The film follows Tomas after his return home as he deals with harsh realities and becomes a vocal antiwar activist. Many scenes are riveting and unforgettable:

- A Vietnam war vet with a similar injury compares his medical treatment with Tomas, revealing how neglectful and inadequate the medical care has been for soldiers returning from Iraq.

- Tomas has to resort to having his mother insert a catheter in him.

- Gold Star mothers who lost their sons and daughters in the War are moved just to touch Tomas.

The movie is set against a startling backdrop of the senate roll call vote that allowed President Bush the autonomy to enter our country into the Iraq War. The ""weapons of mass destruction"" he claimed were a threat to us, were never found. He even enjoyed joking about them at a correspondents' dinner.

NOTE: After the United States presidential election in 2008, and the election of Barack Obama, President Bush stated ""[my] biggest regret of all the presidency has to have been the intelligence failure in Iraq.""

Yes, well maybe that's why we shouldn't rush into war.

On Friday, Feb 1, 2013, there was a screening of Body of War at the Ridgefield Playhouse in Connecticut, hosted by talk show pioneer and legend Phil Donahue -- the film's producer and co-director. In the past eight years since the film was made, he said Tomas' medical condition has significantly deteriorated.

Tomas has spent most of his time in and out of hospitals. Several months ago, he went to the hospital because his arm was swollen and was given medication. As a result,he suffered a brain embolism and slipped into a coma. He then experienced intense pain in his bowels and was advised to have a colostomy to have them removed. After the colostomy, the pain where his bowels used to be has intensified and been much worse.

Tomas Young and his wife Claudia appeared at the Ridgefield Playhouse screening via Skype. Tomas announced that in April 2013, after his one year wedding anniversary, he plans to stop taking all medications and nourishment in order to permanently alleviate his pain and suffering. ""It's time,"" he said. ""When I go, I want to be alert and aware.""

Tomas Young is the very real face of what can happen when a nation is scared, pressured, and bullied into entering an unjust war. See. This. Film.",1359763200,6,2739,4.707112970711297
3505505,5,B001C4N5K0,"Body of War - The True Story of an Anti-War Hero captivated and infuriated me at once. This is a heartfelt film that gives a particularly thoughtful and poignant view of the human cost of war and the need to truly support our troops by remembering to take *proper* care of them when inevitably some of them return home injured, maimed or paralyzed by a sniper's bullet.

The focus of the film is on one young man, Tomas Young, who wanted so badly to right a wrong that he enlisted just 2 days after the infamous September 11th terrorist attacks. We see how Tomas was cheated by our government that chooses to forget about permanently injured and disabled soldiers when they become veterans. Why does the government want to forget about these veterans? Because then- President Bush didn't want Americans to think very much about the human cost of the Iraqi War; thus disabled veterans were shunted to one side. The film proceeds at a very good pace, never going through Tomas' story too fast or too slow. The cinematography reflects great forethought and the candid interviews with Tomas, his family and others make this a very powerful film. The musical score enhances the film as well.

We see Tomas struggling to do what we take for granted--just going to the bathroom is difficult; and it's a real physical effort for Tomas just to put on his pants and sneakers every morning. We learn that Tomas was hit by a bullet only 7 days into his service in Iraq (he thought he was enlisting for duty in Afghanistan), and as a result of his injuries he is now paralyzed from the chest down. It's incredibly painful just to watch Tomas get through the day; he must take many prescription medications including morphine which he slowly needs more and more of in order to ease his physical pain. At the same time, Tomas' wife Brie stands by his side and Tomas' mother supports him with empathy although Tomas' father just doesn't seem quite as bitter about his son's loss of mobility.

Of course there is more. We see how Congress rushed to vote in favor of invading Iraq and how then-President George W. Bush was practically desperate to enter Iraq to confiscate and destroy Weapons of Mass Destruction which were never found. Tomas is angry about Bush administration lies and in retrospect he realizes the Iraqi conflict (aka, War) was a huge mistake that cost the lives of many good human beings and left others like him with a body that was practically broken for life.

The rest of the film tells us even more about Tomas' daily health problems; his meeting with Senator Byrd, one of the most vocal opponents of the war; the effect of Tomas' disability on his marriage to Brie and whether or not one of Tomas' brothers decides to go overseas to fight. I won't add much more to avoid giving you too many spoilers, but one thing that did have quite an impact on me was how people at The Annual White House Correspondents' Dinner laughed hysterically at then-President Bush's jokes about how he couldn't find Weapons of Mass Destruction. Talk about insensitivity to the human price of war!
