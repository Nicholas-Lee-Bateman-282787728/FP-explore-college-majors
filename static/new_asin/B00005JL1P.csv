1444023,1,B00005JL1P,"Don't waste your time or your money.  I was in the original version on Broadway years back and one of the revivals. The tranfer from stage to film is HORRIBLE. In true Babs fashion she had to be in control of this production as she is in her everyday life...  All the songs she sings are altered to her satisfaction and takes away from the rest of the cast. Speaking of the rest of the cast,they are all GREAT and have WONDERFUL stage presents...
Somewhere in the world you will still see stage productions of ""Hello, Dolly"". Go see the stage version, after all if it wasn't good it wouldn't have lasted 40 some odd years.",1014076800,8,622,4.353448275862069

1444173,3,B00005JL1P,"Wonderful cinematography and two great songs don't deliver an artistic success because
Matthau is a combination of oscar Madison and EC fields and Streisand is a combination of fanny Brice and Mae West .
And although we get the great depth of field and color of broadway meets Hollywood we get the stilted , uninspired acting not lifting the lively but rapid fire lines which work better on stage.
2 hrs 28 minutes ?
Wow.
Director Gene Kelly directs in 1969 like its 1949. Some of the sequences look plain silly !
Anyway, enjoy the scenery and the two terrific tunes , you know their names . Look for Louis Armstrong , too!",1510963200,,623,4.522123893805309

1444451,5,B00005JL1P,"It certainly is a masterpiece. There are just so many terrific aspects to it. Barbra is at her peak (one of them anyway!) - she has the whole kaleidoscope covered from vocal virtuosity, and comedy, to dance, to witty verbal patter (in that regard, I LOVE the dinner table scene next to the dance floor near the end where she is ""advising"" Cornelius . .. Yonker's famous half-a-millionaire . . . serving his chicken, does he want his wings clipped? That little skit is a masterpiece in itself)
Matthau is top notch too - very funny, laconic, and even his body movements are hilarious
The costumes and period settings are surely equal to the best ever . .. and an amazing cast with Michael whatsaname and Tommy Tune and those two girls - you know who I mean.
The Hello Dolly number near the end when Barbara appears at the top of the stairs and there is a hushed silence - and then my god - one of the best blow-you-away vocal and production numbers ever seen in a musical .  . . up there with Shall We Dance from K & I, and The Hills are Alive from The S of M, and Don't Rain on My Parade from Funny Girl.
There are so many good songs, good scenes, good comedy and good dancing numbers in Hello Dolly - it's packed - very rich
I never tire of this movie - round about 30 times I've seen it - a bit longer than most musicals - great for a cold rainy night in front of the fire",1468540800,4,1374,4.126865671641791

1444563,4,B00005JL1P,"This is the movie of the musical 1964 musical ""Hello Dolly"". Famously it stars Barbra Streisand and Walther Matthau as Dolly Levi and Horace Vandergelder. It also features Michael Crawford before hsi rolae as Frank Spencer. It's hard to know which role made him more famous... The film maintains the musical's pace and contains the vast majority of the musical pieces. The production values are high and the musical set-pieces are marvellously choreographed and sung. Seen on modern TVs the image quality isn't great but the energy of the movie is still present. The sound quality is OK. Remember that this is a film made in 1969! To modern eyes this could be considered to be a bit camp but I find it charming and wonderful reminder of the great days of Hollywood Musicals.",1455408000,6,774,4.7835820895522385

1444567,5,B00005JL1P,"Hello, Dolly was originally written for Ethel Merman who turned it down (six years later she decided to play the part).  Instead, Carol Channing was hired for the role of Dolly Levi.  When they decided to make a film version, it was assumed (some would say presumed) that Carol Channing would play the role that she made famous and earned her a Tony in 1964.  But, the prevailing wisdom decided to give the part of this elderly widow to a much younger woman.  Enter Barbra Streisand and the rest is history.

Ive always held a particularly fondness for this musical, primarily because it stars Barbra Streisand.  She imbues the role with a sly delivery that is always hilarious (my favorite song is So Long, Dearie).  Its a pity she hasn't done more acting, musicals or otherwise.",1454198400,,780,4.6911764705882355

1444629,5,B00005JL1P,"Yes, Barbra was too young, but her comedic timing, singing, and (the appearance) of light-hearted, good fun, are more on display in this movie, than anything else she has starred in since. And it's a joy to watch.  The problem was the ""0"" amount of chemistry between the two leads.  Too bad.  The production with all the top MGM musical production people is another reason this movie is to be treasured.  Was Gene Kelly the right choice for director?  I don't know.  But Barbra was the best choice.  Earnest Lehman recognized Carol Channing's sandpaper voice wouldn't work on a big screen.  For that time in history, Judy Garland could have been the best Dolly for the movie.  But, she had been commiting a slow suicide with pills and liquor for several years up to when this movie was made.

1444874,3,B00005JL1P,"I did not grow up with the Musical.....I am 52, but my partner is 64 and he has beautiful memories of going to Broadway in the mid-60's and early 70's UNTIL Mr. Stephen Sondheim appears on the scene, RE-CREATES, contradicts, re-invents, and some say DESTROYS the musical. My partner does not have fond feelings for him. For Rodgers and Hart, oh my! For Cole Porter, wow!-------and then there's Jerry Herman, perhaps the last gasp of the old wonderful, tender, silly musical that runs from, say, the 1920's to the 60's......
That ""last gasp"" would more or less be this.........
You have very probably heard a teenager see any of these DINOSAURS and cluelessly say: ""How ridiculous! People breaking into song in the middle of a conversation?!"". Perhaps we should blame so-called ""modernism"" for its death-------among many other things that modernism has left us with---- like.......architecture?.......Well, I am NOT in any way against modernism---certainly not of ""REALISM""-----neo-realism, or else---------those that taught us that ""suspension-of-disbelief"" was to be given in very minimal dosages.....
Ad so we come to Ms. Streisand with those last gasps, indeed: ""Funny Girl"", a beautiful achievement, ""Funny Lady"" (not yet seen by me, but generally considered a mediocre product) and this......

I have never liked Streisand, never cared for that ""Brooklynese"" chatter that she displays here in all its glory, which we must assume that she simply decided never to ""clean up"" and be what she was. BRAVO for her! Bravo for that nose! (By the way, do you know the amount of talent that Brooklyn produced in the 20th century? It is staggering----all magnificently talented jews).
But I think that rare is the person who will not warm up to this woman's tender voice. It is a voice where, interestingly, all that ""vulgar"" chatter and accent disappears, and she delivers her songs in a wonderful diction to begin with, extending all her SSSSS's to the infinite, and every word carefully enunciated. Her voice is beautiful, unique, humane, needful, sober, honest, heartbreaking...you can go on and on.....The arrangements are too sentimental a lot of the time, but even then she pierces you with that magnetism, that slow manner that sings truth.

Here, the subject which I tried to present to you is in full display. It is exquisitely SILLY, a ""turn-of-the-century"" story in NYCity that is simply an excuse for Streisand to show us what a wonderful poseur she was in the sixties at a time when Rock and Roll was changing the culture, the very essence of music, coarse and revealing, vulgar and profound, and I don't know who went to these movies but I can safely assume that the audiences were mostly post-30's in their age?, certainly not teenagers and certainly not people listening to the Stones or Hendrix, or the Beatles' late work.

The illusions were dead, the ""suspension-of-disbelief"" was no longer possible, broadly speaking, and again, the ridiculousness of dancing in the middle of a conversation, of a thin plot that demands very little attention defy your temper-----I left the room a number of times, coming back to the words of ""don't worry, you did not miss anything""....Ha!
And yet, it is moving in its own ""passe"" way----for us getting older it is almost more of a testament to the fact that everything will change and not even our own genres will subsist and time is pushing us away.....Don't talk to me about J-lo and Beyonce and even PATHETIC Madonna (who I grew up with!) at the age of 56 unable to transition into middle-age and showing us a sad human being trapped in a hollow image that insists on being sexual and ""depraved"" and all anew, ready to devour....
But...the movie. Again, depending on who you are, you may or may not have a good time. It is NOT the musical as an example of greatness, certainly not an example of the embodiment of the musical genre.
There's a tiredness to it, an absurdity that wants you to say----""all right, enough!"". It is, I believe, 2+ hours and yet as I write that I realize that it rarely lags.
Walter Matthau is not my idea of a great leading man, unlike Rex Harrison accompanying Audrey Hepburn in ""My Fair Lady"", but it will have to do, no?
There are almost no exceptional numbers, EXCEPT....yes, ""Hello Dolly"", but it is my confusion on whether ""Hello Dolly"" the song was a huge hit for Streisand, because for two decades I have heard it sung (not to mention ""trumpeted""?) by Louis Armstrong in a marvellous way, an unforgettable way, yet here he is, thrown in awkwardly in the middle of a long musical scene and an audience who wouldn't have known him would be perplexed (not to mention that he is not playing) of the two of them together, he the ONLY BLACK person in the entire movie to be given anything of a role (historically correct, but also making you wonder whether this was done so that the segment could be excised in the south? In 1969?----I have no idea).
Again, listen to Armstrong's version and the pure, sheer JOY of his delivery shake you to the core. I believe this was Armstrong's LAST hit (and a super-hit that topped the charts---in the middle of all that Rock and roll revolution)  before his death.

Watch the movie. But you will not be missing much, to be brutally honest, if you don't. A fan of Streisand? By all means. She delivers. For a ""girl"" in her late 20's to show so much poise, so great an amount of sophistication, class, acting skills, singing, of course----it makes you realize what a great talent we had here and how much we have descended to forty years later.

Or is it old age slowly creeping up on me, and the pull of the past?................",1429142400,,5648,4.787692307692308

Walter Matheu was SO bad IMO, he's no singer and this certainly was painfully evident here, in addition to the lip-syncing being WAY off, detracting even more. He seemed miscast in this role.

The fact that I saw this as a kid and still remembered this film says much about the power it has over me. Although I don't get the same feeling from this film that I get from other musicals, such as the Sound of Music, Singin' in the Rain, The Red Shoes, or Funny girl, its musical scenes and Barbra Streisand's incredible persona are worth watching. Barbra is incredibly talented as a singer and an actress. My favorite scene is Dolly Levi's return to the fancy restaurant. The choreography, Streisand's vocal delivery, and the magic touch of Louis Armstrong singing along with her are reasons enough to want to watch this film over and over. The rest of the story, the matchmaking business and the social class issue presented in a comic way is OK, but I didn't care much for it. I felt that the magic came from Barbra's charismatic personality, enthralling voice, and histrionic prowess, which makes any film worth watching; and makes you wonder why didn't she appear in many more musicals.",1379808000,,1081,4.724867724867725

Louis Armstrong was only on the set for one half a day and did his memorable performance in one take.  Every syllable and expression from Barbra Streisand is a gem. The sound quality is unbelievable.

1445462,4,B00005JL1P,"The time has come again for TCM Oscar month and thus begins my annual agony of trying to love Hello Dolly, though everything in me screams, no, life is too short to watch it for a fourteenth or fifteenth time.  But, it is an interesting movie in that I never watch it the same way twice and every time I see it, things jump out at me that I missed before.  I have discovered that such a thing isn't necessarily a sign that it's a good movie.  Anyhow here it begins again, that widescale view of the New York set on the old Fox lot, totally still, frozen in time, black and wide seeping to sepia, and then a whistle blows and the tiny car starts puttering along the elevated railway in the top right of the screen, and a circle appears around it, an iris sweep, and as it sweeps and covers more and more of the screen, the frozen 1 color people attain full color and start walking and skipping and in one cases rolling a hoop down the huge Manhattan thoroughfare and the movie begins.  Soon Barbara Streisand will perform her first number, in the terminal, establishing that she is Dolly Levi and that everyone knows and adores her and that she can solve anybody's problems.

I've decided this time around that it's not really Barbra's fault, but the role doesn't fit her as well as some of her others, that's all.  In some viewings I'm on her side, but last year after watching the amazing Preminger Skidoo I decided the hell with Ernest Lehman, Carol Channing would have been great playing Hello Dolly and not too old or plain for the part.  So that set me against Barbara momentarily.  But now I've regained my balance.  If the movie belongs to anyone, I've decided, it's to the undersung and unrecognized goddess Marianne McAndrew (who plays Irene Molloy--perfectly, without a single flaw).  She must have been under contract to Fox: I remember her about a year later, playing the heroine in Russ Meyer's The Seven Minutes (and perfectly, without a single flaw), but what happened to her?  On the strength of her work in this and the Meyer movie, she should be getting Lifetime Achievement Awards, but she's more or less forgotten today and even in her prime, fans scratched their heads wondering if she was the one who played Princess on Father Knows Best, or if she was the plain girl on Petticoat Junction.  I hate even to look her up on the IMDB for fear that she has passed on without receiving her due as the linchpin of Hello, Dolly!

As Irene Molloy her entrance is built up by Streisand trumpeting her as the perfect solution to Horace Vandergelder's problems, and Horace himself (stout, blowsy Walter Matthau) apparently sees her the same way.  She is gorgeous, with the manners of a countess and yet the blithe, warm heart of a democrat.  She can even make you believe that Michael Crawford attracts her, and that's the ultimate test of any actress, and that it's worthwhile spending her entire savings on a meal that will take her out of a rut.  No actress can listen as well as she can; a wry twist of her lips gives her that Mona Lisa ambiguity that men have pondered for centuries.  And yet she is here, a precious cameo holding up the entire vast structure of Gene Kelly's Hello, Dolly, which would otherwise come tumbling down into ruined casements and the dust of mere players.",1360540800,2,3298,4.525252525252525

1445614,1,B00005JL1P,"Too bad there's no such thing as zero stars. Where to begin with this stinkeroo of a movie?

1) The correct title for this movie should have been ""Hello Barbra"". Of course Streisand was too young to be Dolly to Matthau's Vandergelder, everyone knows that. But worse, this is not Barbra Streisand playing Dolly Levi, this is Barbra Streisand playing Barbra Streisand singing ""Hello Dolly"" lyrics. Streisand has her own, well-known style, which works for songs, but not for role-playing, which is what she's supposed to be doing in this production.

2) Faux lyrics. Two songs that were never in the show, added to further show off Streisand. And Louis Armstrong? Unashamedly there solely to reprise his [outstanding!] rendition of ""Hello Dolly"".

3) Choreography: Huge!, Stupendous!, Enormous!, Colossal! Cast of Thousands! Unendurably long. With feathery costumes, the dance scenes could have come straight out of Las Vegas.

4) Faux plot. Any resemblance between Act II of the movie and Act II of the show was purely coincidental. Artistic license, you say? Well, of course. Much rather than the purse switch in the show, which accounts for Cornelius and Barnaby being able to afford the swanky restaurant, let's have Cornelius tell the truth and have wise, all-knowing Irene not only love him, but be prepared to pay as well. Night court scene? Gone. The famous red dress when Dolly comes down the stairs? Gone. Ernestina Money? Nope, Ernestina Simple.

I watched a local amateur production of ""Hello Dolly"" in our little rural theater. It was true to the Broadway show and the lead sang rings around Streisand, mainly because she was portraying Dolly Levi, not ""look at wonderful me"". The choreography was crisp; the Waiters Gallop brought the audience to their feet and was not interminable, as was the movie. I'm donating this DVD to our local library (if they'll take it).",1341187200,10,1877,5.022508038585209
1445615,4,B00005JL1P,"Well, folks, I've always thought musicals are a little silly. Fun, entertaining, but silly. I mean, people don't start dancing and singing in the middle of the streets the way they do in musicals. Waiters do not, really do not, dance around and do cartwheels carrying trays with fake food glued to them.

Silly, but entertaining. Lavish sets and costumes, some wonderful music, a very silly plot, and the magnificent voice of Barbra Streisand.

In 1890, Dolly Levi (Streisand) goes out to Yonkers to see Horace Vandergelder (Walter Matthau) and take his niece Ermengarde off to New York to get her away from the suitor who Vandergelder feels is inappropriate because he's an artist, which is impractical. Vendergelder is himself off to New York to ask a young milliner to marry him. But Dolly has other plans. Through a series of sneaky moves, Dolly manages to get all the potential couples matched up properly: including herself and Vandergelder. In the process, all those songs and dances and lovely costumes and settings.",1336953600,,1024,4.982456140350878
1445616,4,B00005JL1P,"Jerry Herman's ""Hello, Dolly!"" is the last of the big, splashy,  old-fashioned, escapist musicals. Plenty of eyebrows were raised when twenty-six year old Barbra Streisand was signed to play ""middle-aged"" matchmaker Dolly Levi. The role had been played, in various versions, by  the likes of Shirley Booth, Carol Channing, Mary Martin, and Pearl Bailey. Screenwriter Ernest Lehman took one look at Channing in the movie ""Thoroughly Modern Millie"" (a role for which she was inexplicably Oscar nominated) and decided audiences would never accept her in a leading role in a film. He was right. Channing said she was ""suicidal"" that she did not play Dolly on film, but does anybody else really care that she did not get the role? Who, in their right mind, would want to see circus-freak from another planet Channing play anything? Which brings us back to Barbra.
  The powers that be realized the plot of ""Dolly!"" was trivial  to the point of being nonsensical. It was hoped that a more youthful Dolly might revitalize the entire enterprise, and that is exactly what happened. Yes, Barbra is too young here and she knows it. And yes, Walter Matthau, as crabby, cantankerous millionaire Horace Vandegelder (that Dolly marries herself), is old enough to be Barbra's father. But, who cares? Musicals are full of older man-younger woman scenarios.  Fred Astaire, for example, romanced the much younger Judy Garland (in 1948's ""Easter Parade"") and Audrey Hepburn  (in 1957's ""Funny Face""). And  1969's ""Dolly!"" is a blithe little fairy tale that never seems to take place in the real world, anyway.  Somehow, Barbra manages to make the role of Dolly work within her own performance  persona. She delivers all of her lines with rapid-fire speed; most likely to distract us from the fact that not much of anything-- if anything at all-- is going on in the plot.
 In many ways, ""Dolly!"" Is a victim of excess-- but it is an entertaining and glorious excess, nevertheless. . You can tell this ""all-singing, all-dancing"" spectacle was directed by the multi-talented Gene Kelly. He begins the film by focusing on several pairs of feet, as they are dancing or hopping. Finally, a hose is seen washing down the hot sidewalk on a serene summer day. We see Dolly's feet, and the camera eventually goes to Barbra as Dolly, who descrbes herself as ""a woman who arranges things."" Herman's bouncy score is a great asset. Try watching ""The Matchmaker"" (the same plot without songs) starring Shirley Booth. Anthony Perkins, and Shirley MacLaine, and you will be asleep in five minutes. Herman's score overflows with an infectious feeling of joy, and Barbra, literally, makes this musical sing! ""Put On Your Sunday Clothes"", featuring Barbra and co-stars Michael Crawford (years before his future ""Phantom Of The Opera"" fame), Danny Lockin (who was tragically murdered in 1977-- thank God this film preserves his youthful, amazing energy, freshness, and zest), and Tommy Tune cavorting joyously, is as exuberant as any number in any musical film. And, when Dolly decides to return to the human race, Barbra sings a thrilling rendition of ""Before The Parade Passes By"" with exactly the right mixture of poignancy, passion, and power. Elsewhere, however, all the exuberance is a bit too much. The frenzied ballet , choreographed by the brilliant Michael Kidd and performed by the waiters in  excited anticipation of Dolly's return to the Harmonia Gardens Restaurant, left me feeling exhausted and giddy. Barbra seems to be having fun when she performs the title song with Louis Armstrong and the Waiters' Ensemble. When the musical does slow down for the occasional ballad like Crawford's ""It Only Takes A Moment"", everything drags and it only takes a moment to lose interest.
  They don't make musicals like this anymore; simply because nobody could possible afford to! It is easy to get lost in John De Cuir's stunning production design and Irene Shariff's beautiful costumes. Everything in ""Dolly!"" is BIG. Even Irene Malloy's (Marianne McAndrews) little hat shop seemed BIG to me. A wounded Carol Channing would have the whole world believe that the film ""Dolly!"" was a BIG flop that didn't make any money at all. The fact is that ""Dolly!"" did make money, but was SO expensive, it never recovered its total production cost. And, at least, all the expense is visable in the movie. No, ""Dolly!"" is not a movie that will change your view of the world. But it is very diverting, and it might make you feel happy for a few hours. And Carol Channing can weep until her dying day, but Barbra Streisand is the reason that ""Dolly!"" remains so beloved and has a devoted, cult following. Barbra Streisand is the real reason why ""Dolly will never go away... again.""",1331856000,2,4729,4.962073324905183

Looking back it's just like the wonderful fluffy musicals that MGM made in the 40's and 50's, right? Just a bit silly with great sets and music. The problem is that it was made in the late 60's. A cultural revolution had taken place and this seemed quite hokey at the time. I was a kid at the time and thought it myself when I saw it in the theater. It's really a musical a decade too late. Rogers and Hammerstein, Leonard Bernstein and Steven Sondheim had made musicals on very serious topics since then and totally changed the landscape. Streisand was wonderful and played the role the only way it could have been played, broadly with whimsy and a bit of tongue in cheek. Some people hated her because Carol Channing didn't get the role. THANK GOD SHE DIDN'T!!! I've seen Carol Channing on Broadway and she is an unashamed HAM, as subtitle as a volcano, and no singing voice. The only really unfortunate thing about this movie is Walter Matthaus casting, just a very bad match for Streisand. She was a bit young for the role and he seems ancient compared to her. Even so, with the passage of time it's now just another good MGM musical with great music, sets and talent.

1445679,5,B00005JL1P,"Despite its generally limited recognition, ""Hello, Dolly"" stands as one of the most spirited musical creations of our century, and certainly one of the most sparkling movies of all time. Barbra Streisand shines as the indomitable Dolly Levi, the young, sassy, street-wise widow whose plan to wed herself to Horace Vandergelder (played with great alcrity by Walter Matthau), a curmudgeonly half-a-millionaire who owns a profitable hay and feed business in Yonkers, New York, and adds her own special charm to the richly detailed and brightly bubbling confection that glows just as bright today as it did back in 1969.

It was because of the Disney*Pixar movie ""WALL-E"" that I first became aquainted with this film. Of course, I had to go out and buy the DVD and see for myself what it was all about. I fell in love with it immediately, and it quickly became my favorite film, if not my favorite musical, of all time. There is something indescribably special about it, something that makes it stand out from everything else I've seen, which I just can't get enough of. Perhaps in a time where people dress down, have little or no interest in history, don't take time to slow down and enjoy the little things, or even observe common values of courtesy and good manners, ""Dolly"" provides an escape into the glorious and opulent of Victoriana America, not to mention giving its viewer a lavish throwback to the last great musical Hollywood ever produced.

I once heard Michael Crawford describe this as a beautiful, romantic, ""old-fashioned valentine"" of a musical. That is exactly what it is. It is a sweet and charming story with beautiful songs and a stellar cast that simply refuses to be lost into the passage of history. Truly, there are no bad moments. Every second has something interesting to look at or listen to or feel, and the performances from the actors are just priceless. The whole thing is a joyous spectacle from start to finish, and I am always laughing and crying and applauding the sheer brilliance of it throughout the entire experience.

Unlike most musicals, the acting is uncharacteristically good. The performers are entirely believable in their roles and play them with truthfulness and reverence. Of course, there are some moments where a little zaniness is required, but it never comes over the top. Gene Kelly's stellar direction took the show to places the original creators never dreamed of going. His choice between merely making a musical and making a good movie is never questioned: he made a great movie, hands down, and it shows. The way he handled everything, from the cinematography to the choreography sequences to the musical numbers themselves just proves that he's a talented director who knows what he wants and knows just how to do it. Every choice he made was perfect, to say nothing of the brillant job he did of casting. I also applaud Ernest Lehmann for his marvelous script. He really went to town in taking a show with good songs but a somewhat boring and predictable storyline to something Oscar-worthy.

As to the lady herself, I can't think of a time when Barbra Streisand ever looked prettier. She has a huge smile on her face throughout the whole film, and gives Dolly an energy and enthusiasm Carol Channing never had. She sings with vim and verve and uses every last bit of her vocal range and power to toss a little extra ""oomph"" into Jerry Herman's peppy songs. Even though she was criticized at the time for being too young, her performance is no doubt one of the best in her career. You need a dynamic personality like Barbra's to carry the role of Dolly Levi believably, and she carries to perfection. What really strikes me as interesting about her is the fact that although she was only in her mid-twenties when this was filmed, she manages to appear as a woman who is much older, maybe in her thirties or forties. Not that she looks old and matronly (anything but!); but rather her wisdom and persona project the air of a woman much more mature than twenty-five. Take the dancing scene, for instance. She's marvelous at giving Michael Crawford a lesson on how to waltz, and is very patient and understanding of his overly-exuberant youth. In real life she was actually three months younger than him. That type of acting is rare to be found an anyone today--someone with skills enough to make you forget how young or old the person is themselves, and just see the character alone.

I simply love the characters of Cornelius Hackle and Barnaby Tucker, Mr. Vandergelder's niave young clerks, who want to spend a day in New York, spend all their money, and kiss a girl; both played expertly by Michael Crawford and Danny Lockin, respectively. Crawford, only twenty-six at the time, has a sweet, gentle voice, and uses an American accent very well in one of his earliest film roles. Despite being cast by Mr. Kelly as the ""attractive idiot"", Crawford puts over an equally great comic as well as heartfelt performance. The astonishing moments of excellent physical comedy are well worth watching, and it's amazing to think that he'd be playing the part of the Phantom only a few years later! I especially liked him in the ""It Only Takes a Moment"" sequence; just look at his expression and gestures. He plays the role with such honesty, I almost always get teary-eyed!

The two supporting women, Barnaby and Cornelius's love interests, are also very talented: E.J. Peaker as Minnie Faye, and Marianne McAndrew as Irene Malloy. Although she didn't do her own singing, Ms. McAndrew is very nice looking and a fine actress, just the sort of person you can picture Cornelius falling in love with in just one day. Or in ""a moment"", as the song goes.

The visual look and feel of the film is gorgeous, with sumptuous sets and marvelous costumes. The widescreen, TODD-AO film captures the colors and patterns vibrantly, and still looks bright and new after forty years. I especially liked a very obvious Gene Kelly trademark in the opening scene of the film, showing nothing but people's feet strolling the sidewalk in downtown New York. Genius.

With the 2003 restoration came a clean-up of the soundtrack as well, which leaves you with nice crisp, clean sound to match the great picture. The harmony between audio and visual is virtually seamless, and there were only one or two brief moments where one was unsynchronized with the other. One can only hope that in the next few years (2014), Fox will release a 45th Anniversary DVD of this film, having missed out on the 40th last year.

To close, ""Dolly"" is great fun, a terrific movie for the whole family that is truly timeless, and one that only gets better with each viewing.",1283385600,5,6679,4.780762564991335

Alongside those gems, the ""plot songs"" will also stay with you as catchy and fun tunes - especially Dolly's introduction songs ""Just Leave Everything to Me"" and the titular ""Hello, Dolly"" - a climax that will stay with you for days.

1445841,5,B00005JL1P,"Barbra Streisand stars as the memorable ""woman who arranges everything,"" Dolly Levi, in Gene Kelly's Oscar-winning 1969 film version of the Jerry Herman musical classic HELLO, DOLLY! Originally produced on Broadway in 1964, Hello, Dolly! is based on Thornton Wilder's 1954 play The Matchmaker. In her musical incarnation, Dolly! thrilled and delighted audiences in New York for over 6 years, featuring such legendary ""Dollys"" as Carol Channing, Ethel Merman and Pearl Bailey.

The setting is New York, just before the turn of the century. Matchmaker Dolly Levi, that seemingly ageless widow, sets out for Yonkers to deliver her hand-picked match for Mr. Horace Vandergelder (Walter Matthau), the ""well-known half a millionaire."" Vandergelder has his eyes on Miss Irene Malloy (Marianne McAndrew) but, before he leaves for New York City to propose marriage, Dolly has some ideas of her own. With her eye on the unsuspecting Horace, Dolly sets in motion a dizzying plan of ""love happily ever after"" involving everyone in Vandergelder's circle.

It's easier to view Dolly! years later and enjoy it now for what it really is. After you've been removed from the media hype, after the publicity and reviews blend into one another, the film stands not only as a humorous and nostalgic peek at a bygone era in New York City, but a tribute to the bygone era of movie musicals. Reuniting director Kelly with many of the creative people from his days as an actor/director at MGM, the film, with it's grand artifice, eager cast and exuberant dancing, could easily have been a product of that old golden studio system.

Hello, Dolly! was released in 1969 at the tail end of a trend of big-budget musicals precipitated by the tremendous success of The Sound of Music in 1965. None of these films came close to duplicating its success and, subsequently, were blamed for the ruination of many studio balance sheets. Suddenly, the merits of these films were beside the point. While some deserve their fate of late-night cable obscurity, others, like Hello, Dolly!, do not.

Like most of the other road show musicals of the late sixties, Hello, Dolly! was considered overproduced and out-of-sync with the times. By the time Dolly! reached the movie screen, she had already been played by many larger-than-life ladies of the theatre. Her score, including the title song immortalized on pop charts by Louis Armstrong, was filled with brassy Broadway cheer, An intimate version of Dolly! would have worked against both the material and its leading lady.

Though criticized at the time for being too young, Streisand brought rapid-fire humor, sex appeal and, of course, an inimitable voice to the role of Dolly Levi. Her performance gives Dolly, and the film, an unexpected urgency previously hidden in all the familiar material. As film critic Pauline Kael wrote when the film opened, ""she [Streisand] opens up such an abundance of emotion that it dissolves the coarseness of the role. Almost unbelievably she turns this star role back into a woman..."" Director Kelly recognizes this as he balances her ""big"" scenes with those of quiet introspection. Streisand's delicate reading of ""Love is Only Love"" (dropped from Jerry Herman's Mame and re-written especially for this film) reveals a vulnerability and warmth in Dolly Levi that grounds the character and prevents her brash antics from turning to caricature. While she does at times seem to be possessed by the spirit of Mae West, Streisand uses this as a humorous facade for something much deeper and no doubt sensitive.

Until the success of recent films like Chicago, Hairspray, Mamma Mia and Les Miserables, the traditional movie musical as a commercially viable genre seemed all but lost. The sporadic attempts at reviving the form (A Chorus Line, The Wiz) were close to disastrous. The lack of a unified team of musical talent (such as at the old MGM or 20th Century-Fox studios) made an actress such as Barbra Streisand all the more rare. Thankfully, Streisand emerged in films at a time when there was still opportunity to feature her musical talents. While still in her twenties, she blazed her way onto the screen like a seasoned pro, but, like her films, she seemed to belong to a different era.

Among Hello, Dolly!'s competitors for the Best Picture Oscar in 1969 were Midnight Cowboy and Z, signaling the beginning of a new wave of more socially relevant films that would bury the likes of such ""dated"" properties as Dolly!. Now looking back on these films, whatever their merits, they ironically all seem to be part of another world as equally ""dated"" as Dolly! But now, preserved on Bluray in its original aspect ratio, Hello Dolly! sheds its ""dated"" reputation and becomes as timeless as its star and the era of moviemaking it recalls.

It's so nice to have her back where she belongs!",1242432000,3,4834,4.988833746898263

1445912,3,B00005JL1P,"""Hello, Dolly!"" is one of those huge-budgeted musicals made after the incredible success of ""The Sound of Music.""  Lightning was reluctant to strike twice, however, and subsequent, bloated musicals like ""Paint Your Wagon,"" ""Dr. Dolittle,"" ""Star"" and ""Darling Lili"" tanked at the box office.  ""Hello, Dolly!"" seemed a safe bet.  It was based on a hit Broadway show, starred Barbra Streisand -- fresh from her Oscar-winning role in ""Funny Girl"" -- in the title role, had a score by Jerry Herman and a script by Ernest Lehman (""North By Northwest""), and was directed by Gene Kelly, a guy who knew his way around musical movies.  Yet the result was an overly long dud with Streisand monumentally miscast.  Dolly should have been played by an older actress.  Streisand mugs unrestrainedly and her performance never convinces.

The film does have its good moments.  Louis Armstrong brightens the screen when he joins in the title number.  Michael Crawford as Cornelius Hackl and long-limbed Tommy Tune as Ambrose Kemper are both excellent, and the dance sequences are nicely staged by Michael Kidd (""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers"").

Viewed today, ""Hello, Dolly!"" inspires awe at the magnitude of the production, the many locations, the huge number of extras used to fill the screen, and the sumptuous 1900's-style costumes and sets.  This bare-bones edition has no bonus extras.",1226707200,,1375,5.148648648648648

1445977,5,B00005JL1P,"Hello, Dolly! was the first Barbra Streisand movie I ever saw. I was only 14 years old, and I was completely captivated and under the spell of the movie's magic. I had occasionally heard Barbra sing on television specials, but Dolly was the first time I'd seen her on the big screen. For some reason I missed seeing Funny Girl when it was first released.

The absolute best parts of the movie to me are Barbra's singing and the incredible score. Being a musician, I can fully appreciate the music. Every song is a masterpiece, and oh, so singable.  To this day I still hum tunes from the show, and they never grow old.

While watching the movie again recently, I fell in love with the music all over again, but this time I really paid attention to the dancing. Wow! I  forgot how fabulous the dance numbers are. And of course there are the costumes and sets. I just love every aspect of this movie, and since I have worn out my VHS version, I'm ordering the DVD. I can't wait to see it in widescreen, the way I remember it in the theater.

Barbra's voice is top-notch throughout the film, and it was from watching Hello, Dolly! that I first became a Barbra Streisand fan. I love anything she does musically. Her voice is her gift to the world, and we are so fortunate be the recipients of her rare and precious talent. I wish there were more singers like her.

1445982,4,B00005JL1P,"I watched ""Hello Dolly"" on television when I was a teenager.  My father, a musician, thought it was a fantastic production.  That may have been the first time I watched Barbra Streisand perform. To me, then, it was just a good musical, one of many.  In high school, we performed a different muscial every year.

However, I recently watched ""Hello Dolly"" again after Barbra's comment on the Actor's Studio that she was too young for the role, etc.  She also remarked that she had a good memory for negative reviews but not such a good one for positive reviews.  I have watched several of Barbra's films over the years.

I have to say that her performance in ""Hello Dolly"" demonstrated her versatility as an actress, even early in her career (age 27).  I loved her machinations and her lines with Walter Matthau.

She had red hair and was a little heavier than she was in ""Funny Girl.""  Her hairstyle reminded me of Rose Morgan at her wedding in ""The Mirror Has Two Faces.""  Barbra has a certain facial expression on camera when she is quietly happy; that expression really hasn't changed over the years.

During the scene in which Dolly (Barbra) was preparing for dinner with Horace and singing about how a second love would be different from her first, Barbra's appearance reminded me of the night that Rose Morgan tried to seduce her husband  in the Mirror Has Two Faces.

At the end of Hello Dolly, Horace has become convinced by Dolly and the various events she orchestrated, that a life without love is no life at all. It was great to watch Dolly walk the long pathway to the church where the wedding would occur.  In The Mirror Has Two Faces, Rose Morgan similarly convinced her platonic philosophical husband that love between a man and a woman had great value.

Perhaps Hello Dolly started out with controversial reviews but it has gained popularity.  And even if Barbra Streisand considers it one of her stepchildren, it still belongs to her.",1210464000,,1950,4.671554252199414
1445983,5,B00005JL1P,"Hello Dolly is truly one of the last great musicals from the golden age of Hollywood. It seems like no expense was spared--it took one month just to film the ""Hello, Dolly!"" sequence in which Dolly returns to the Harmonia Gardens. This scene lasts about ten minutes in the film--but still, one month to get ten minutes footage is a lot of time to get so little footage! Barbra Streisand works well, actually, as Dolly Levi--her husband could have died early in life and that's all it would take to explain a younger woman in the role of Dolly Levi. Moreover, the other cast members turn in fine performances, too.

When the action begins, Dolly Levi from Manhattan takes a trip to Yonkers ostensibly to arrange a marriage for Horace Vandergelder's (Walter Matthau) niece Ermengarde Vandergelder (Joyce Ames). However, Ermengarde doesn't want any part of it--she's in love with a young artist named Ambrose Kemper (Tommy Tune); and Ambrose feels the same way about Ermengarde. What's more, Dolly eventually has plans for helping Horace's two clerks, Cornelius Hackl (Michael Crawford) and Barnaby Tucker (Danny Lockin).

A few days later, they all wind up in Manhattan and fate--with Dolly's help--begins to weave its magic spell. Cornelius and Barnaby become smitten with Irene Molloy (Marianne McAndrew) and her hat shop assistant Minnie Fay (E. J. Peaker). They all spend time together having fun; but Dolly has her hands full trying to manipulate Horace into marrying her instead of Irene Molloy--or the not terribly appealing Ernestina Simple (Judy Knaiz).

Of course, from here the plot can go in so many different directions. You may know the plot but there are no plot spoilers in my reviews! Will Dolly manage to get these two young couple together--along with Ambrose and Ermengarde--so that they can find a happy life romantically? What about Dolly's feelings for her late husband--to what extent will they get in the way of Dolly pursuing Horace? Will Horace, who is a very cranky and somewhat negative man, ever come around to marrying Dolly? Watch the movie and find out!

The song and dance numbers are fantastic. The ""Hello Dolly"" number alone was fantastic. Look for a wonderful cameo by the great Louis Armstrong who just happens to work in the Harmonia Gardens restaurant! It's great to see Armstrong on film with Streisand. The cinematography and choreography impressed me greatly during the scenes from the parade down 14th Street in Manhattan as well as in the Harmonia Gardens restaurant.

The DVD has an optional commentary and there's a 1969 featurette that shows how they organized and coordinated the parade down 14th Street in Manhattan. It's excellent! You can also choose languages but there's not much more. Oh, well. The film is very good and it still can stand mostly on its own.

Overall, Hello Dolly is a fine classic musical from the very tail end of the golden era of Hollywood musicals. The actors give extremely good performances; their acting is very convincing.

Since Hello Dolly! was filmed in Todd-AO, it should not have a 2:35:1 aspect ratio (unless --horrors -- they made the DVD from a 35 mm print).  Todd-AO, probably the best 70 mm format at the time of Dolly!, had an aspect ratio of 2.2:1, and when projected on a curved screen viewed from pretty much directly in front, more like 2:1, either of which would be more comfortable to look at, and more involving, than the too ribbon-like 2.35:1.  So, either both the DVD box and the Amazon website are wrong, and the DVD image is really 2.2:1, or the disk was made from a 35 mm reduction print, which would be too bad.

But as directed by the legendary Gene Kelly, this tuneful Jerry Herman musical is a delight from beginning to end, with amusing performances (Walter Matthau, Michael Crawford), and the dynamic presence of Barbra Streisand. The lead casting of La Streisand was understandably criticized at the time, not only because she was approximately half the age of the character she portrayed, but because of sympathy for Carol Channing in not being allowed to recreate her signature role for the big screen.

1446124,4,B00005JL1P,"This elephantine 1969 musical comedy is always referred to as the movie that brought 20th Century-Fox to the brink of financial ruin in the early 1970's, but now that 37 years have elapsed since its original release, one can appreciate it for the old-fashioned, ingratiating piece of entertainment that it was intended to be. As one of the biggest successes on Broadway, Jerry Herman's musical adaptation of Thornton Wilder's turn-of-the-last-century comedy, ""The Matchmaker"", was given an opulent production, and Gene Kelly was handed the reins to translate a relatively intimate story onto the big screen. His MGM-trained sensibilities come in handy with the elaborate production numbers (aided by his former colleague Michael Kidd's energetic, athletic choreography) and motor-mouthed dialogue scenes given refreshed life by veteran screenwriter Ernest Lehman.

All of 25 when filming started and in just her second film, Barbra Streisand would seem like an odd choice for a character conceived as a fiftyish widow. However, she brings youthful sass and a Mae West-style delivery to her comedy lines as Dolly Levi. More importantly, she doesn't condescend to the cardboard dimensions of the role and instead heightens the comedic possibilities. But let's face it...Streisand was hired for her singing, and the memorable score provides the ideal vehicle for her vocal talents, whether it is the galloping drama of ""Before the Parade Passes By"", the anticipation she creates with ""Put on Your Sunday Clothes"", the forlorn memories she evokes with ""Love Is Only Love"", or my personal favorite, her comically rat-a-tat tongue-lash to Horace, ""So Long, Dearie"".

The featherweight plot has Dolly coming to Yonkers to visit prominent, penny-pinching shopkeeper Horace Vandergelder, who has requested she find him a wife and prevent her niece from marrying a local artist. In the meantime, Vandergelder's chief clerk Cornelius Hackl and assistant Barnaby Tucker are looking to liberate themselves by visiting the big city where Dolly has conveniently set them up with milliner Irene Molloy and her assistant Minnie Fay. As it turns out, Irene is Horace's intended, so complications ensue. The proper couplings take place by the finale but not before Dolly comes down the steps of the Harmonia Gardens restaurant to greet her old friends in an extended production of the title tune. Louis Armstrong even makes a brief appearance as the bandleader just to duet with Streisand on the song more associated with him than the movie.

Walter Matthau is perfectly cast as the curmudgeonly Vandergelder, and the age difference between Streisand and him does not seem so readily apparent given how vested both are in their roles. Michael Crawford, well before his Phantom days, is appropriately callow and loose-limbed as Cornelius, although Marianne McAndrew comes across far too sedate and mature as Irene. John DeCuir's production design and Irene Sharaff's costumes add considerably to the period feel. The movie does feel overlong and rather exhausting at 146 minutes, especially since Kelly feels a need to pull all the stops in almost every scene. The 2003 DVD has a pristine print transfer that brings out all the colors anew, but there are only two other extras - a seven-minute vintage short about the production and the original widescreen trailer.",1156550400,3,3345,5.319470699432892

1446173,5,B00005JL1P,"As other reviews state, bad press for this film continues. My question is ""Why""?? I was never a fan of musicals until I saw ""Hello Dolly"". Barbara Streisand is incredible as Dolly Levi and very believable as a widow thanks to the make-up and costume departments. Her costumes and hair where definitely more mature (or should I say matronly)than those of other youthful characters...even the gown she wore in the Harmonia Gardens sequence has a certain maturity to it.  Barbara brings the character to life with her touching interpretation of the character. I recently purchased ""The Matchmaker"", starring Shirley Booth, Paul Ford, Shirley MacLaine, and Anthony Perkins. It is the nonmusical version of the Thornton Wilder play of the same name and is the play upon which ""Hello Dolly"" is based. While enjoyable, it simply did not have the vitality of this musical interpretation. Walter Matthau is a wonderful Horace Vandergelder. While vocally inferior to some of the other performers, he transform his character into an easy-to-love, although gruff fellow. This is in contrast to Paul Ford's Horace Vandergelder who is quite unlikeable. While Tommy Tune and Michael Crawford went on to have successful careers, I always wondered what happened to Danny Lockin (Barnaby). I recently found out he was murdered back in 1977. That is unfortunate because, in my opinion, he was an incredible talent.

Friends have teased me for years that they will give it to me as a present...  Yesterday, I purchased it - secretly mind u - and saw in for the first time in widescreen...

I had to send a message to my friend Dennis(a major teaser)and acknowledge the fact - that - YES - in widescreen it is just GREAAAAAAAAAAT!!!! Never mind the choreography during the title- song... The rest is MAGIC:-)))

I don`t think the big studios realised, that  when they released their films in full frame in the 80s and 90s on vcr - they let the film and its structure down. Other cases are the veeeeeeeeeeeery CinemaScoped film ""There`s No Business Like ShowBusiness"" and ""Valley of the Dolls""....

As for Barbra, I always loved he rin that film. Many a critic has stated she was too young... Who says u can`t be a widow of 27???  She really is a take-off on Mae West, especially her ""GOOODBYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYE"" adieu to Horace towards the end... Funny indeed....

1446177,5,B00005JL1P,"I remember seeing ""Hello,Dolly!"" for the first time when it came to television on CBS in the early 1970s. I loved it then

and still do now! Clive Hirschhorn wrote of this film in ""The

Hollywood Musicals"" that ""like the old MGM musicals,it simply

required nothing more of the audience than to sit back and enjoy it"".That's not surprising,since director Gene Kelly,

conductor Lennie Hayton,choreographer Michael Kidd,photgrapher Harry Stradling,art director Jack Martin Smith,and associate producer Roger Edens were all veterans of MGM's legendary Arthur Freed filmmaking unit. Their complete mastery of the genre shows in every frame. The sets,costumes,and photography are lovely. Under Kelly's zesty direction,the film moves briskly

and is consistently entertaining. The score is beautifully played by the Twentieth Century-Fox Studio Orchestra under the

superb direction of Hayton,Lionel Newman,and their crew(Jerry Herman's music never sounded so good!).Writer/producer Ernest

Lehman repeats his sparkling ""Sound Of Music"" work here. Michael Kidd stages some impressive dances. And the cast is delightful.

Michael Crawford,Marianne McAndrew,Danny Lockin and E.J.Peaker are charming. Walter Matthau is wonderfully gruff and appealing.

But there is no doubt that this is Barbra Streisand's show,and she

is simply magnificent! Yes,she hams it up at times,but that's

perfectly in keeping with the character of Dolly Levi. And she

balances it out perfectly in some quiet and tender moments(watch her in the scene just before intermission where she asks

the dead Ephraim to set her free,and the one near the end where

she asks his permission to marry Horace).This is one of Barbra's best performances!

""Hello,Dolly!"" was Fox's best musical since ""The Sound Of Music"".It provides an evening of wonderful family entertainment.

Pure joy from start to finish!",1151107200,3,1867,5.6859205776173285
1446178,1,B00005JL1P,"Obsequiousness to authority.  The worship of wealth.  The film centers around Horace Van Der Gelder (Walter Matthau), a rich boss, who treats his employees and his niece like possessions, like garbage.  They, in turn, are obsequious to him, offensively so.  So many old movies use this formula.  The males, although adult in years, behave like obedient children, yes sir no sir.  Obnoxious garbage.

Almost all of the musical numbers are terrible.  I had to fast forward through them to avoid a lot of pain and suffering on my part.  The only one I really wanted to see was the one that featured Louis Armstrong.  It didn't belong in this terrible movie.  Louis Armstrong and Barbra Streisand are two huge talents, and their performance together was the only classy thing about this crappy movie.  It took Barbra right out of character.  She was no longer Dolly Levi.  She was suddenly Barbra Streisand singing with the great Louis Armstrong.  I noticed that at the part in the song when the two singers would normally give each other a hug, these two just waved to each other.  It was startling.  Obviously they didn't touch each other because he was black and they were afraid to offend white racists.  It was a pathetic and cowardly decision.

The script took odd turns because it was very poorly written.  Horace decides at the end to propose to Dolly.  Why?  Why do a 180 degree turn?  Because the script says to.  That is the foolish level that this writing is on.

We also get the opportunity to re-enter Nazi Germany.  There is a restaurant run by an obsequious but dictatorial Nazi head waiter.  He commands his staff like a Prussian but he and the rest of the staff are unfailingly obsequious to anyone with money or connections to money.  He practically has a sexual experience when he hears the Rockefellers mentioned.

There is also a surreal quality to the movie.  The Nazi and his staff adore Dolly Levi.  That is unexplained.  It is just part of the surrealism.  She represents Heaven to them, or Mother, or Wealth, I really don't know what she represents to them.

At the end, the talentless writer decides to turn Matthau into a philanthropist because, perhaps, Barbra is embarrassed at how the entire movie worships money as God.

There are only two things about this awful film that save it from being 100% awful.  Barbra is good, and Louis Armstrong is always good.  Aside from that, this trash belongs in the sewer.  Who enjoys seeing young men being obsequious to power and wealth?  I don't get it.  What character traits do the fans of this garbage have?  Are they delusional?  Do they wish the world was like this?  This is Hell, not Heaven.  You've got to be a severely deranged authoritarian to like this nonsense.",1150588800,6,2741,4.704016913319239

1446251,3,B00005JL1P,"It's a world where horses clip clop in rhythm and children  hop-scotch to a chorus of unseen voices that introduce a title character who skips down a busy street that looks less like turn-of-the-century, immigrant-laden New York than it does Main Street at Disneyland. Welcome to the cartoon-like New York of ""Hello Dolly"" where Walter Matthau plays a gruff Foghorn Leghorn to Barbra Streisand's wisecracking, street-smart Bugs Bunny.  Plot logic?  Character consistency?  Fuhgeddabodit.  Still, all in all, ""Dolly"" is entertaining.

No, I don't know how a widow living hand-to-mouth can afford to drive to a swanky restaurant in a horse-drawn carriage and make an entrance in a gold and topaz beaded gown that would be over-the-top even if her name was Vanderbilt.  Yes, I agree that Irene, Minnie, Barnaby, Cornelius, Ambrose and Ermingard have about as much character depth as the dancing cutlery in ""Beauty and the Beast"".  And if you're going to sit there and ask why this young, sexy, vibrant, self-sufficient Manhattan woman has decided to marry a grumpy old hay and feed proprietor and set up housekeeping in sleepy suburban Yonkers - well, you're just missing the point.  Sit back and loose yourself in the cinematic equivalent of cotton candy.

Streisand's Dolly is so much smarter than the other ""fools"" (to use Horace Vandergelder's term) in the picture, that she is a joy to watch.  There's almost a ""Groundhog Day"" aura to the character, as if she's been through this all before, knows what's going to happen, and is just effortlessly playing along, humoring the other characters fumbling through this reality for the first time.  In the hat shop she spins the yarn about Cornelius being one of ""THE Hackel's"" with great animation and conviction until the end as Horace demand's ""How does he do it?""  ""Well, I'll tell you.."" she starts as she sits at the table, bored, checking her makeup knowing full well that she is not going to have to come up with any more to the story.  She can tie the plot in knots and not break a sweat because she knows she'll get what she came for.

Along the way she tosses off asides letting us know she realizes how hokey this all is.  As Barnaby, who we know full well is a professional dancer, leaps across the room after ten seconds of dance lessons, she quips ""I think he was holding out on us!""  Guiding Horace to his seat at the restaurant, ""Don't stand there, you'll get run over by a waiter.""

As a piece of entertainment, the film's main flaw is that Streisand disappears for large sections of the movie. Which brings up the question, why isn't ""Hello Dolly"" better than it is?  Earnest Lehmen (West Side Story, Sound of Music) wrote it.  Gene Kelly, who once pushed the musical film into new directions with ""American in Paris"" and ""Singing in the Rain"" isn't breaking any new ground here.  He's at the end of his directing career and he's being extraordinarily conservative.  He seems to be punching the time clock, almost going back to the way musicals were done before he started directing; turning in another ""Harvey Girls"" or ""Me and My Gal"".

In addition, this is a cartoon that takes itself too seriously.  All the marching bands, parade extras, and gut-busting dances look like so much WORK, that I wonder if Kelly was the right man for the job. A little craziness or irreverence would have helped.  Someone like Richard Lester (""Hard Days Night"", ""Oh What a Lovely War"") or Bob Fosse.

Back stage note #1:  In late 1963 both ""Funny Girl"" and ""Hello Dolly"" were in rehearsals on Broadway.  After a run through, ""Funny Girl"" director Bob Fosse (later replaced by Jerome Robbins) loudly and passionately lectured Barbra and the cast that what the actors had to bring to the show was ""elegance"".  It became their slogan, and something of a joke both among the cast and the other dancers working on Broadway.  Bob Merrill even wrote an ""Elegance"" number.  ""Funny Girl"" didn't use it.  But when he played it for his friend Jerry Herman who was trying to put the finishing touches on Dolly, Jerry realized it was just what he needed to open his second act!  So, ""Funny Girl"" and ""Hello Dolly"" share both a star and a Bob Merrill lyric.

Back stage note #2:  Contrary to what you might think from watching the movie, the shoot was a pretty unpleasant experience for all concerned.  Matthau and Streisand hated each other.  He thought she was an untalented newcomer who was always making suggestions and prematurely acting like a star.  She hated his crass jokes, often made at her expense.  The day after Robert Kennedy was shot, tensions were high on the set.  During the filming of the scene with Dolly and Horace talking in the buggy outside the hay and feed store, Barbra and Walter finally exploded at each other.  A huge verbal fight ensued with Barbra walking off the set in tears.  It took hours for Kelly to get them both back together and to try to hide the damage to her makeup.  (Look carefully and you'll see bags under her eyes in several shots.)  Matthau complained to the producers, who replied ""Look, the movie's not called `Hello, Walter!'""",1125100800,21,5114,4.736425339366516

TOO MANY SONGS AND DANCE NUMBERS?

Duh....what is a musical supposed to be?

WORST DANCE PRODUCTIONS?

I think this movie has some wonderful dancing, particularly by the waiters at the Harmonia Gardens.  I guess some reviewers think the stuff done in FLASHDANCE or DIRTY DANCING is good dancing?  Not in the same league folks.

BARBRA OVERCONTROLS?

She's the star, isn't she?  And she does share some of the musical moments in the background---PUT ON YOUR SUNDAY CLOTHES, DANCING...etc.

Critics and reviewers have often criticized Babs as being ""too young"" for the role.  Why should Dolly have been an old bat???

This movie was nominated for Best Picture in 1969, and over the years, many movie authorities have said it never should have been.

The music is wonderful...simply wonderful.  And the choreography is not only notable, but frequently inspired.  The casting in some instances is outstanding (Tommy Tune, Michael Crawford), and in others just totally wrong (the younger female supporting character).

And it has to be said....as much as I like Streisand (and I do), this was completely wrong for her.  She was WAAAAY too young, and I just didn't feel her interpretation of the character was at all believable.  It's apparent from the start that she was given the role only because she was the biggest star of the day.

Walter Matthau is one of my favorite actors, but in this film he just didn't seem to have the character fleshed out.  It's probably the only film he made where I *never* liked his character.

And while Louis Armstrong is one of my favorite performers of all time, I will never know what he was doing in this movie.  When he sings with Dolly Levi, and she actually refers to him as ""Louis"", my jaw dropped.  Excuse me?  ""Louis"" wasn't performing in the 19th century.

But the dancing, the music, and the great talents of Michael Crawford and Tommy Tune still make this a movie I like to catch on television once in awhile.  Will it ever be on my own list of all-time favorite musicals?  Not a chance.",1095984000,3,1353,4.579166666666667

While Dolly is truly a memorable character and needs someone strong, the rest of the cast deserves their moment because they are all truly wonderful.  I adore Horace: Walter Mathau is superb.  Louis Armstrong is a perfect adition, and Barnabas and his buddy are comically appealing.  I just would've loved to have seen this with someone willing to share the spotlight.

The transfer to DVD is superb and crystal clear in picture and sound. The widescreen is anamorphic and color corrected. The only drawback is Walter Matteau's typical characterization which often detracts from the scenes he appears in, and his song ""It takes a woman"" is only saved by the beautiful setting and the male singers and dancers that accompany him.

1446320,4,B00005JL1P,"This mega-expensive film adaptation of the enormously popular Broadway musical never quite became the mammoth blockbuster that 20th Century Fox obviously intended it to be.  Although HELLO DOLLY was generally popular with audiences and even became the fifth-highest grossing film of 1969, it was still unable to recover it's tremendous budget (over $25 million in 1969, more than $140 million when adjusted for inflation), and it is unfortunately viewed as a flop by the majority of the public.  Elaborate and old-fashioned, DOLLY must have appeared terribly outdated to the EASY RIDER generation at the time of it's premier, and film has never been able to complete shake it's archaic reputation ever since.  Contrary to such criticism, when removed from the high expectations that surrounded it at the time of it's release, HELLO DOLLY is actually thoroughly enjoyable musical comedy, featuring strong performances from it's cast and some truly stunning production numbers.

Of course, many people criticize the casting of the then-27-year-old Barbra Streisand as the widowed Dolly Levi, but Streisand amazingly manages to overcome such physical miscasting with the sheer force or her tremendously engaging performance.  Streisand literally ignites the screen with her raid-fire wit and unsentimental vulnerability, delivering a multi-layered portrayal of the fabled matchmaker.  As usual, Streisand is in phenomenal voice, belting out Jerry Herman's score as no one else ever could.  She also looks quite ravishing in Irene Sharaff's sumptuous costumes, managing to appear quite sexy in addition to being funny, feisty, and touching.

Walter Mathau is great romantic foil; he and Streisand develop a combative comedic chemistry that rivals even the best of the classic 1940's screwball comedies.  The incredibly young Michael Crawford and Danny Loklin, both already accomplished stage actors, are thoroughly likable and create a memorable ""Laurel and Hardy""-like comedy pairing - it's a shame they never appeared together in film again.  The appropriately prim Melanie McAndrew makes a very sweet and pretty ingenue, but it is sort of jarring that her ""young woman"" actually looks older and more matronly than Streisand's supposedly middle-aged Dolly

Legendary actor/dancer Gene Kelly manages to keep the various story threads running smoothly, and the picture's momentum builds nicely as the various plot elements reach a simultaneous climax at the Harmonia Gardens restaurant.  Michael Kidd's trademark choreography is typically complex and challenging, and the entire cast appears to be giving their all in each and every number.  Herman's score is neither complex or challenging, but his songs contain both strong hooks and instantly memorable melodies, with Streisand's incomparable renditions of ""Before the Parade Passes By,"" ""So Long, Dearie,"" and the immortal title song remaining some of the most astonishing moments in musical movie history.  Although unfairly savaged upon it's original release, HELLO DOLLY is truly delightful film that seems to only improve with age.

About the DVD: Considering the age of the film stock, the DVD transfer is phenomenal - vivid colors, razor-sharp details, and virtually no edge enhancement.  The sound is also excellent, and although there aren't any newly-produced features, the trailer and vintage featurette are solid additions.",1081123200,3,3384,5.605882352941176
1446321,3,B00005JL1P,"I can't describe exactly why 'Hello, Dolly' doesn't work properly as a Musical, all I can tell you is that somewhere in the middle it falls badly flat, and doesn't really regain its momentum at all.
Starring the magnificent voice of Ms. Barbra Streisand (as well as the rest of her, a fine comedic actress), 'Dolly' tells the story of widow Dolly Levi, a notorious busybody and general matchmaker who attempts to snare a client, Yonkers Grouch Horace Vandergelder (Walter Matthau) for herself. She is aided in her quest by lady milliner Irene Molloy and Horace's apprentice Cornelius Hackle (a VERY young, totally tuneless Michael Crawford), and a host of minor-yet-memorable characters.
Directed by Gene Kelly (yes, THAT Gene Kelly), 'Dolly' starts very well, with some gloriously-shot numbers like 'Just Leave Everything To Me' and 'Put On Your Sunday Clothes'. Streisand's voice sounds beautiful, and she does these excellent, witty songs great favours by imbuing them with her tried-and-trusted Yiddish schtick. Choreography is excellent throughout, not too complicated so as to become boring, but detailed enough to suggest opulence. Streisand and Matthau have decent chemistry, too (although the same cannot be said of Crawford and Marianne MacAndrew (Irene), and give believable, endearing performances. The Harmonia Gardens scene is spectacular, with a cameo from Satchmo himself and more gay waiters than you can shake a Barbra at.
So far, so good.
But when 'Dolly' fails, it fails hard and often. Firstly, the movie's colour palette seems to be restricted to dull shades of orange, purple and olive drab. There's not enough visual contrast in here to keep the attention focused on Spectacle, and in a musical of this nature, that's a big problem.
Secondly, the titular role of Dolly isn't actually that big a part, and the slightly irritating and very unbelievable relationships between Irene and Cornelius and their associates have too much screen time. With such epic players as Streisand and Matthau to work with, why would we need to see so much of the others? Particularly when the others just aren't as interesting?
And finally (as is endemic of nearly all stage-to-screen musicals), 'Dolly' is about three numbers too long. During Barbra's reprise of 'Before The Parade Passes By' we feel our attention waning, and even the spectacular 'Hello Dolly' routine can't bring our focus back to the level it used to be. The latter half of the movie is pretty much one big OTT number segueing into another, and the human-interest angle is somewhat lost in a mire of musical histrionics and dull colours.
One for the fans, I can only recommend it for rental, or instead, catch the Broadway version. It's far more entertaining.",1077667200,,2734,5.118568232662192

Barbra Streisand is riveting as the eccentric and determined matchmaker; Walter Matthau is hilarious as the curmudgeonly old employer who is determined not to change a bit, but wants to get married anyway; Michael Crawford and Danny Lockin are charming as young men from a small town set loose in the city for the first time and Marianne McAndrew and E.J. Peaker are their perfect counterparts; and Louis Armstrong very nearly steals the whole show in his cameo in the restaurant.  The dancing sequences are also stunning - there are intimate, one on one dance sets and huge, all cast numbers that are simply fabulous.  I know that this musical was not very popular when it came out, but if you enjoy musicals, you would be a fool to miss this classic!",1075680000,5,1936,4.792792792792793

Someone else reviewed it that she was not middle-aged, and therefore did not play it middle-aged, but the fact of the Matter is that Dolly is middle-aged, and Barbra was not.

The other thing in the cutting and hacking of the score. Jerry Herman himself complained about how and where his songs were placed in this movie. He even wrote a new song (""Just Leave Everything to Me"") in for Barbra in replacement of ""I Put My Hand In,"" and says in his autobiography that it was moved from where he originally intended it, to a spot that did not work as well.

1446386,4,B00005JL1P,"It has been written that Ms. Streisand retrospectively termed the film version of ""Hello Dolly!"" the ""worst mistake I ever made.""  If she did, she should re-evaluate her work and consider upgrading her opinion a bit.  ""Hello, Dolly!"" isn't bad.
Granted, it's not the perfect fit of her Fanny Brice vehicles or ""The Way We Were.""  Barbra is at her best in material tailored to her unique talents, and ""Dolly"" was a show that could never be a ""Streisand vehicle.""  By the time she tackled the movie, the role had been played by just about every musical actress worth her salt.  Each gave the part her own individual stamp, winning praise for shedding new and different light on a beloved character.  So why did Hollywood eviscerate Streisand when she tried to do the very same thing?
It would be pointless to try to speculate on just what politics were in play back in 1969, when the film premiered.  Better to examine the most common criticisms one by one, and see if they hold water.
First and foremost:  Streisand's age.  She was blasted as far too young for the role, making her attempted portrayal of a middle-aged widow ludicrous.  What seems to have escaped many people's attention is that Streisand did not attempt to play a middle-aged Dolly.  That had already been done quite adequately on the Broadway stage and in countless touring companies.  Twenty-six at the time of filming, Barbra was mildly overweight -- which added years -- and wore period costumes.  The combination made her look about thirty-five in the finished film.  This is a perfectly plausible age for Dolly.  At the time of the story (just before the turn of the century), women married young -- usually while still in their teens -- lest they become old maids.  It was not unusual for a young girl to be married off to a much older (perhaps previously married) gentleman.  (Remember, a lot of marriages were arranged for reasons other than love.)  This common practice could result in a 25-year age spread between husband and wife, and left many a thirty-ish widow in that time period.  Some re-married, some did not.
As portrayed by Streisand, Dolly Gallager Levi likely enjoyed an idyllic ten-year or so marriage to the much older Ephrom Levi, then found herself a widow while still quite young.  Considering the conventions of the day, Barbra's portrayal of Dolly Levi as a still-young woman wasn't bad or inappropriate; it was just different from what we were accustomed to seeing.
Second:  Streisand's interpretation of the role.  If one can, for a moment, accept that Streisand was not attempting a middle-aged Dolly, then it makes perfect sense that she obviously  could not rely on the dramatic devices that make such a middle-aged character endearing -- warmth, wisdom and eccentricity.  A more youthful Dolly would have to be a bit more cunning in her approach, not above using the power of seduction and her still vibrantly sexy presence to manipulate people and situations to her advantage.  Barbra at times seemed to be impersonating Mae West, waiving her merry widow hips and adding an insinuating double entendre to many of her lines.  While she might have lacked some originality, she was dead on target for believability.  Let's face it:  women and men alike have been using sex to get what they want since the beginning of time.  Streisand's Dolly Levi was simply doing what worked.
At other points in the film, Barbra's performance borders on slapstick.  This is also entirely appropriate, given the sometimes farcical nature of the storyline (grown men hiding in closets, mistaken identity, and the hilariously destructive chase through a posh restaurant).  This was no time for Streisand to start flexing her dramatic chops.
Almost no one has tried to find fault with Streisand's singing.  Nearly at her vocal prime, Barbra gave splendid readings of the Jerry Herman score.  Her voice showed the richness and velvet shudder that became the stuff of legend.  Barbra's vocal work in ""Dolly"" was only bested by her singing in ""Funny Lady"" six years later.
The DVD presentation of ""Hello Dolly"" restores the subtle though vibrant color palate, and allows the film to shed the dated image it had acquired in the eyes of many -- who had probably only experienced horrendously faded television prints.  The widescreen transfer is absolutely necessary to allow the viewer to fully appreciate the largely horizontal composition of the action, the dance sequences, and the sets (in this regard, a very stage-like presentation).  Much of the comedy is lost in the pan-and-scan editing done for television prints -- Streisand and Walter Matthau bantering from separate sides of the Harmonia Gardens dinner table is a notable example.
While some may carp about the lack of extras offered on this DVD, it's not too much of a detriment.  Behind-the-scenes documentaries have a way of spoiling the aura that surrounds a period piece such as ""Dolly.""  Like a whimsical greeting card that suddenly loses its charm when one starts to analyze the paper stock, ""Hello Dolly!"" is best enjoyed as a somewhat insubstantial but deliciously spun cotton candy concoction that serves as a lovely tribute to a time -- and an art form -- long gone.",1062892800,9,5217,4.926773455377575
1446387,4,B00005JL1P,"The debates over this film have been raging for years, and now that HELLO, DOLLY! has been released on DVD, they're likely to continue for years to come.  Opinions are certain to vary, but let's clear up a few misconceptions right from the start -
After 20th Century-Fox purchased the screen rights to HELLO, DOLLY!, producer/screenwriter Ernest Lehman was fairly certain he'd be asking Carol Channing to recreate her stage performance for the film - that is, until he saw her in the 1967 movie THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE; to put it as delicately as possible, her features didn't translate well to the big screen.  Fox executives were equally doubtful about Channing, so the search began for a new Dolly.  After flirting with (and subsequently dropping) the idea of Elizabeth Taylor, the leading candidate became Barbra Streisand.  The powers-that-be suspected (correctly) she was headed for major film stardom, and they hoped a fresh, younger Dolly would give the multi-million dollar project greater appeal.  Lehman immediately revised his script, eliminating all references to Dolly losing her husband fourteen years earlier, and - after concluding that audiences wouldn't accept Streisand as an Irishwoman - changing the character's name from Dolly Gallagher Levi to simply Dolly Levi.  The studio made the offer, Streisand signed on the dotted line, and Lehman surrounded her with the creme de la creme of the MGM/Arthur Freed movie musical unit - Gene Kelly (director), Roger Edens (associate producer), Michael Kidd (choreographer), Lennie Hayton (musical scoring), and Irene Sharaff (costumes).
Skeptics, however, dug in their heels, and a period of bad press followed; there was outrage a film novice like Streisand had taken a role they considered her ill-suited for.  A wave of sympathy engulfed Channing, who received a consolation Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination for THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE (even though Beatrice Lillie received the film's best reviews when it was released).
The bad press began to wane when Streisand's first film, FUNNY GIRL, was released to critical acclaim, box office success, and a Best Actress Oscar; suddenly there was great anticipation for HELLO, DOLLY!  And when the film finally opened in December of 1969, it played to packed (and enthusiastic) houses from New York City to Hollywood.  Even critics who questioned Streisand's appropriateness for the role agreed she put on a hell of a show.
After a solid start, however, the film's success was mixed; HELLO, DOLLY! received seven Oscar nominations (including one for Best Picture), but Streisand was overlooked.  And though it ranked as one of the top ten box office attractions of the year, it hadn't recouped its production costs by the end of 1970; it was neither the runaway success the studio was hoping for, nor the disastrous flop its critics made it out to be.  But to the dismay of naysayers who wanted the film to die an ignoble death, DOLLY kept attracting new fans - first on television, then on video, and later on laser disc.  Obviously, somebody had done something right.
Watching the movie now on DVD, it's hard to believe such a good-natured, visually spectacular film could have provoked the feelings of animosity it did (and apparently still does).  As for Streisand, I think Lehman was absolutely right to cast her; there may be times when she seems too hip for this wholesome slice of Americana, but her funky irreverence is what makes HELLO, DOLLY! so much fun.  Not only is she in excellent voice throughout - if anything, she sounds better here than she did in FUNNY GIRL - but it's hard to imagine anyone else bringing the poignance she does to Dolly's monologue in the park (""Ephraim, let me go""), or being as raucously funny in the dinner sequence at Harmonia Gardens (""You salt your beets, and I'll salt mine"").  In fact, her energy and charisma are so dynamic that the film's pace falters whenever she's not around - no disrespect to either Michael Crawford or Marianne McAndrew, but the subplots involving Cornelius Hackl and Irene Molloy, while pleasant enough, are hardly enthralling.  Walter Matthau, however, makes a surprisingly effective Horace Vandergelder, and his scenes with Streisand have some genuine comic vitality.  If there were offscreen tensions between the two, they weren't apparent when the cameras were rolling.
But more than anything else, DOLLY on DVD offers great opportunities for those of us who just want to concentrate on musical numbers (we know who we are).  There are moments worth savoring again and again in ""Just Leave Everything To Me,"" ""Put On Your Sunday Clothes,"" ""Dancing"" (Danny Lockin and E.J. Peaker are particularly impressive here), ""Before The Parade Passes By,"" ""The Waiter's Gallop,"" and, of course, the title number with Louis Armstrong, but Streisand's best number is probably her simplest - ""So Long, Dearie.""  It isn't hard to understand why her character gets a marriage proposal after that one.
As for the age issue - yeah, it's a little strange to see a woman in her late twenties being referred to as an ""old girl.""  So why didn't Ernest Lehman ask Jerry Herman to alter the lyrics?  Hard to say - maybe he didn't think anyone interested in realism would be watching HELLO, DOLLY! in the first place.  And ultimately, that's what this movie is all about - pure escapism on a grand scale.  The quality is apparent in every frame, so just kick back and enjoy the show.",1062547200,279,5452,5.040044493882092

The beautifully restored picture is heads above the previous VHS releases.  The crystal clear stereo soundtrack is equally as impressive.  Additionally, the Intermission/Entr'acte music and the Exit Music, which I believe were not on the VHS versions, are here as well.

1446391,5,B00005JL1P,"""Hello Dolly!"" is the elphantine musical film based on the long running stage play that in 1969 failed miserably to find its audience at the the box office.  Directed by legendary song and dance man, Gene Kelly and featuring the meticulous choreography of Gower Champion, this is a big, brassy, spectacular production, the likes of which we aren't likely to ever see again.  Barbra Streisand plays Dolly Levi, a matchmaker whose heart is set on landing stuffy hay and feed owner, Horace Vandergelder (Walter Matthau).  The off camera bickering between the two co-stars may have been legendary, but none of it shows up on the screen.  Streisand and Matthau are ably assisted by Marianne McAndrews, Michael Crawford, Tommy Tune and the incomparable, Louis Armstrong. Removed from all the angst, hype and negative publicity that branded musicals box office poison from about 1959 onward, ""Hello Dolly!"" emerges as one of the best of the genre, an outstanding, tune filled epic production that never fails to entertain!
FOX VIDEO has given us a handsome looking DVD.  Colors are rich, bold, vibrant and extremely well balanced.  Black and contrast levels are only slightly on the weak side but adjusting one's television contrast and brightness fixes this right up.  There is NO EDGE ENHANCEMENT, ALIASING or PIXELIZATION or FILM GRAIN or AGE RELATED ARTIFACTS for a visual presentation that is as smooth as the plot.  The soundtrack has been remixed to 5.1 surround but suffers slightly from a muffled characteristic, perhaps because of noise reduction equipment used in the remastering effort. Still, most of the film has a crisp, clean and not overly bright sound to it that, while dated, nevertheless is easy on the ears.
EXTRAS: A Theatrical Trailer.  That's it.
BOTTOM LINE: I should fault Fox for given us no extras but with the film looking as though it were shot last week I have to stop myself and just proclaim, ""Well done!"" An absolute must for your DVD library!",1061251200,22,1970,4.9817073170731705
1446392,5,B00005JL1P,"I got my advance review copy for the region 1 release of Hello Dolly and had to write a review here. This is one of my favorite films, and I will concentrate on the tech specs for the disc. It is enhanced for widescreen 16:9 and says Dolby Surround on the packaging but is actually Dolby Digital 4.0.  This is one of the best sound transfers I have yet seen for a classic film. There's no doubt that original master tapes were used for the sound transfer. The seperation is so good, the voices of the singers move from left to right with extreme clarity, and when the entire cast is singing, it reminds me of the best of the RCA VICTOR recordings, the ensemble comes at you from all around including the surround. I give the sound a 5 out of 5.
The video quality is another story and a good one. This is flawless, it is like watching a new movie. It is so clear it almost seems like 3d on my Sony front projector. The colors have been restored and I believe the transfer was from 70mm negatives because this is one of the clearest conversions of a classic Fox has done. Extras are several trailers, a featurette, which isn't alot (I was hoping to see the 20 minutes that were cut and maybe a commentary and extras like the SOUND OF MUSIC disc had).

1446393,5,B00005JL1P,"Only Streisand's second movie, filmed during the politically and meteorlogically hot summer of 1968, Ms. Streisand turns in a performance that could have won her first best actress Oscar, instead of the much better ""Funny Girl,"" filmed in 1967. Why an Oscar?  Streisand knew from the start that she was terribly miscast as the middle-aged widow, Dolly Levi.  Opposite Walter Matthau, twice her age at the time, it's not a believable story.  The Oscar comes from Barbra's totally tongue-in-cheek performance.  She is not Dolly Levi, she's really Mae West, Fanny Brice, Brooklyn Barbra, even a twinge of pre-star Dolly Parton.  Listen as Barbra throws in a little southern accent here and there.  But mostly watch an incredible actress do what she can with a story so silly that by the end of the film, 26 year-old Streisand changes the supposed-to-be 50+ widow into one of the sexiest screen performances in film history.  Even Matthau can't hold back his disbelief when watching Barbra do her numbers.  When there's no Barbra on screen, there's no film. You watch in anticipation until Barbra's next scene, wondering who she'll be.  The film looks like Gene Kelly directed it in three days with many technical flaws in the continuity of blocking scenes and dialogue.  Just watch Barbra.  Forget that she's the best female singer of the 20th century (no pun intended). Think of her as a young, sexy actress who has such energy, fearless ambition to get her movie career going.  Of course, the sets are incredible and her duet with Louis Armstrong (his last film performance) is classic, albeit about two minutes long.  Watch Barbra whisper under her breath while filming the dance numbers in The Harmonia Gardens with seasoned dancers.  She looks like she's saying, ""What the hell am I doing here?""  Actually, she's making pure movie magic happen, almost impromptu.  Movie:  three stars, Barbra:  Five plus stars.  Nice to see Michael (Phantom of the Opera) Crawford pretend he can't dance.  Barbra doesn't talk about this movie, but being the most costly musical in history up to that time, 20th Century Fox got their money's worth a million times over by convincing the apprehensive Barbra Streisand to star.

1446451,5,B00005JL1P,"HELLO DOLLY has received a bum rap over the years.  Its oversized budget and colossal New York-circa-1890 back lot set is said to have sunk 20th Century Fox.  This is far from the truth.
Now, almost 35 years later, DOLLY can be seen in proper perspective:  it's a well-done, old-fashioned movie musical.  Its only sin is that is dresses up a flimsy Broadway musical in the form of a big-time movie musical.  Let's face it, HELLO DOLLY's book features situation-comedy type scenes of hiding in closets and mistaken identities.  It doesn't have the weight of the Nazis (i.e. SOUND OF MUSIC) or the Americana of OKLAHOMA.  It is, nevertheless, frothy fun -- with a great, hummable score!
Barbra Streisand is also blamed for accepting the role of Dolly Levi, too.  Dolly should be middle-aged; Streisand was 27.  Also, Carol Channing was famous for the part (she won a Tony for it) and Streisand is considered to have ""stolen"" the movie from Channing.  (I personally could not fathom watching Carol Channing for 2-1/2 hours.)  Streisand was too young.  But does it really matter?  She's absolutely hilarious in DOLLY, and sings the score wonderfully.  It was Streisand's second film, and one of her too few musical films.
The DVD features a wonderful featurette from 1969.  The featurette contains great behind-the-scenes footage of filming the ""Before the Parade Passes By"" scene, as well as the ""Sunday Clothes"" scene.  Gene Kelly, Michael Kidd, and Irene Sharaff are all included.
Fox has restored HELLO DOLLY and this DVD features the restored print.  DOLLY has never looked better!  From the multi-colored feathers on the back of her hat in the opening scene, to the canary-yellow ""Hello Dolly"" dress in the Harmonia Gardens, Streisand looks fabulous and colorful and bold.  Throughout the film you will notice various shades of purples pop out.  The paint-speckled trees in the ""Parade""park scene are an interesting detail!  The only scene that misses is the dimly lit ""Love is Only Love"" song.  The colors look faded and the picture quality drops a notch or two.
I must also sing the praises of this WIDESCREEN release!  I've watched DOLLY for years on a pan-and-scan VHS tape.  The movie looks excellent in widescreen - the way it was originally filmed - and it's great to see some of the action in the extremes of the frame.  For instance, this is probably the first time I've ever seen what Streisand was doing in the right part of the frame while dueting with Louis Armstrong!

There are a handful of musicals I truly love and this is in the top three. Most Streisand movies are enjoyable, but I think this was her best. She makes the perfect matchmaker in this musical comedy that is fun to watch over and over again. This story was made into movies at least three times but I enjoy this version the most. It has been said the two stars didn't like each other, in my opinion they do a fine job of acting, since that didn't come across to me. In fact it may have proved beneficial. Since this is after all a period piece I saw Mathau's reluctance and badgery as something that may have been quite common in men at that time when it came to marriage. If my grandfathers are any indication, I would say women had to have a great deal of patience and perserverence to endure what they did during this period in history. The matchmaker Miss Levy (Barbra Streisand) certainly shows those traits. She not only refuses to be beaten when it comes to matching up others, she will do a knock down drag out with Mathau if that is what it takes to convince him she is the right woman for him. It reminded me of some of the great John Wayne films with Maureen O'Hara. I am ordering the DVD right now!",1052006400,2,1367,4.34375

For anyone familar with this past lanmark, you can relate to how the ambiance added to the enjoyment of seeing this big, splashy and highly produced musical. The theater was packed with Christmas revelars. The audience applauded when Barbra's close-up appeared. This spontaneous erruption continued after each number was performed. And when Louis Armstrong sang his cameo version of ""Hello, Dolly"", the enthralled audience sent waves of love with sighs and applause.
I melted that afternoon. I revisted the film six more occassions through summer's end.
Is it the best? Not at all. But was it the most entertaining film during its time? Indeed, it was!!! For all its shortcomings, the joy the film expelled was a gift to those who viewed this valentine to the ""good old days"" of motion picture musicals.",1041033600,6,981,5.024539877300613
1446456,4,B00005JL1P,"I saw a play version of Hello Dolly, and warmed right up to the light story and catchy tunes. The movie version is much more elaborate and blown-up (haha), however it is hilarious. Barbara Streisand makes a good Dolly Levi, a spritely, joyous matchmaker. But underneath her happiness she yearns to move on from her widowhood, despite her fond memories of her husband. She targets Horace Vandergelder (Walter Matthau), a single, half-millionare and owner of a Seed and Feed Store (okay, really not sure of that one), to be her second husband. Dolly goes about this by being his matchmaker and first matching him up with the pretty Irene Molloy, a hat-maker in ""the city"".
Irene, played by Marianne McAndrew, is a sweet but lonely woman, who sings the lovely son ""Ribbons Down My Back"". The other plotline has Cornelius Hackl and Barnaby Tucker, Vandergelder's employees, escaping small town life and wooing Miss Molloy and her helper.
All in all, quite corny and old fashioned, not for everyone, but some fantastic dance scenes and great instances. Streisand is wonderful. And I must mention that I was laughing all the way through at the thought that Michael Crawford, who played Cornelius, eventually played the sensuous, horrific Phantom of the Opera. In Hello Dolly, he is a gawky youth with a funny little voice, while in other instances (mostly later) Crawford has a beautiful, sweet singing voice. Nevertheless, I thought he was real cute and comical in Hello Dolly.
Hello Dolly is not a deep or fantastic movie, but is definitely entertaining and nice.",1028419200,10,1559,4.9541984732824424
1446457,5,B00005JL1P,"It was years before I really was able to get into this musical. But what impressed me about ""Hello, Dolly!"" when I was a child was that it was a popular musical that came out the year I was born. I remember enjoying the number, ""Elegance"", and in hindsight, am not altogether surprised that then stick-figured Michael Crawford managed to make at least a little of an impression on me even then. The point he makes in response to the reminder that he doesn't know any girls(""I'm twenty-eight and three quarters, I've got to begin sometime."") is rather touching, and only someone with his soft, emotional, faltering voice could make the delivery of such a line so memorable.
 But of course, this is Barbra Striesand's show, and she is graceful, impish, and hysterically funny as the upbeat matchmaker of 1890 Yonkers. With her hair dyed red, her stylish outfits and the nuances in her rapidfire way of speaking, she makes Dolly Gallagher Levi one of the funniest and most positive characters on film, and while I am aware of the strong disappointment there was when Carol Channing was not chosen to recreate her Broadway role on film, Striesand does the part great justice.
 Walter Matthau is crusty and comically grouchy as Horace Vandegelder. The most hysterical moments in the movie are the ones where Dolly pretty much dogs the staid, mostly unemotional grain merchant, during their tumultous evening at the Harmonia Gardens Restaurant, and hires a friend, Gussie Granger(played with perfect comic timing by Judy Knaiz) to pose as an heiress to keep things interesting.
 Louis Armstrong has a spectacular cameo during the performance of the title song. Danny Lockin, Marianne McAndrew, and E.J. Peaker had obvious fun with their roles as Barnaby, Irene, and Minnie. A towering Tommy Tune and petite Joyce Ames make a humorously interesting pair as Vandegelder's niece and her artist suitor.
 It all ends quite happily for everyone involved, and we are treated to splendid costumes, splashy numbers,including, of course, Barbra Striesand's beautiful and powerful singing, and and an overall optimistic atmosphere along the way. This is definitely one movie I would highly recommend for getting in a good mood!",1024617600,4,2210,5.046575342465753
1446458,5,B00005JL1P,"(based on the movie I don't yet own on DVD, because it's not yet released!)  This is a movie the critics did not like, but for millions of Barbra Streisand fans, it remains a great disappoitnment that this has not yet been released on DVD.  I hope someone is in the wings working on this.  I'll be first in line to buy this one!  (And, what about ""On A Clear Day You Can See Forever""?)  Who's holding up the other, in my humble opinion, great musicals that Barbra has done?  That is ""Hello, Dolly"" and OACDYCSF.  Where else you gonna see Barbara doing a duet with Louis Armstrong?  Maybe she was miscast, but didn't she do wonderfully well on the music.  And, bless his heart, didn't Gene Kelly pull out all the stops on those production numbers?  And, what about that unparalleled rendition of ""So Long Dearie""?  Come on fellas, it's time Dolly came back again!!!",1022544000,3,864,4.4743589743589745
1446459,5,B00005JL1P,"It's true!  Hello Dolly has joined the ranks of Willy Wonka as one of Jenn's favorite ""clean the house"" movies.  It plays in the background and sometimes into dinner time and never seems to get old.  I must confess that even I am entertained time and again by the exploits of Cornelius and Barnaby looking for a good time outside of Yonkers.  So where's the DVD?!",1018224000,2,363,4.454545454545454
