2073493,3,B0002AKDZA,"This is a complete uncut version of a great Roy Rogers film, in which all of the REPUBLIC FILMS cowboy stars join Roy to help Dale and Gabby save Dale's ranch for orphaned boys. They're all here: Sunset Carson, Wild Bill Elliot, Alan Rocky Lane, Bob Livingston, and Don Red Barry. And the songs are all here too! Lots of footage had been cut to fill tv time slots in the 1950's, and the first stuff to go was always the songs in order to keep the plot as intact as possible.
However...although the good news is that this is possibly the best version available, it's still in need of some serious restoration. The print, while free of awful splice cuts, is dark and murky and could use a good digital cleaning. The night scenes are so bad you can hardly make out who the characters are. Some scenes appear to shift from washed out to somewhat clearer. The audio could be spruced up too.
But still, if you want an uncut print with all of the songs intact, then I can still recommend the purchase of this dvd from ALPHA. I just hope that some company out there (ROAN? They've put out excellent Roy Rogers restorations in the past) can clean this film up and release it properly. After all, this was one of REPUBLIC's premier features, and one that all fans of Roy, Gabby and Dale would love to add to their collections.

P.S.....Just to see what I was missing I pulled out my Platinum/Echo Bridge ROY ROGERS VOL.1 which has 5 movies on one single sided disc. BELLS OF ROSARITA is listed here as the 54 min. cut for tv version. Boy was I surprised!!! It's the complete 68 min. version and unlike ALPHA's dark and murky copy this one is super clear, sharp image with great background depth!!! This is the one to get, PERIOD!!!
However, on the same dvd, HANDS ACROSS THE BORDER is listed at it's full running time of 72 min. and is a badly cut 52 min. version. Go figure.",1261008000,8,1865,4.359195402298851

2073495,3,B0002AKDZA,"Here is a pacy work that employs standard elements to be found in Republic Pictures' contemporary Western films starring Roy Rogers, including the familiar plot artifice of shooting a movie within another, cowboys on horseback chasing motor vehicles bearing villains, musical interludes that interrupt the action at random, et alia, with an additional device utilized herein: ""cameos"" from cowpoke stars under contract with Republic: Wild Bill Elliott, Robert Livingston, Allan Lane, Don ""Red"" Barry, and Sunset Carson.  Sue Farnum (Dale Evans) has been willed her father's traveling circus but his erstwhile partner Bill Ripley (Grant Withers) intends to take it from her as she cannot locate a receipt confirming that her sire had repaid a loan enabling him to gain title to the big top company, and when she and her employee and friend Gabby Whittaker (Gabby Hayes) accept aid from her dad's pal Slim Phillips (Addison Richards), the three, along with Slim's daughter and troupe entertainer Patty (Adele Mara), entrain to the southern California fictional town of Cabrillo wherein Slim believes he will locate the missing receipt, thereby ending Sue's plight.  The Forces of Evil soon kidnap Slim but subsequent events are but ill-explained by a slapdash screenplay that accords space for eight musical numbers (not counting repeats) and while Rogers plainly is tasked, as is his wont, with rescuing a city-bred damsel in distress, he is equally motivated by a primal need to burst into song, a predilection shared with, among others, Evans, Mara, Janis Martin, and the baritone Bob Nolan led Sons of the Pioneers.  This lowercase effort benefits from a panoply of Republic casting roster supporting players from whom, despite the film's following the accepted trend of Rogers ""B"" Westerns, a number of telling performances will be enjoyed from uncredited actors (including dancing girls!); Hayes reprises his wearisome schtick that he displays in each of his movies, even to the phrases, but Evans has a clamp on the acting laurels with a vivacious turn, while able editing supervised by Arthur Roberts makes for a snappily moving although somewhat goofy picture.",1169942400,,2167,5.2936046511627906

8025228,1,B0002AKDZA,"This DVD excluded 2 major scenes ...
[1] When Gabby Hayes, rescued from the closet after the kidnappers locked him up, steals an entire scene by attempting to wash strawberry jam (which he thought was blood) from his hands and face.
[2] When Roy Rogers issues a ""call to arms"", and solicits each of several Republic Pictures' featured cowboy heroes (Lash Laroe, Wild Bill Elliot, Rock Lane, etc.) to come to the circus' rescue.  This omission from the DVD is enough to return it, and get your money back.
For me, one of the poorest transfers I have ever seen.  Image quality is extremely poor (not enough contrast), and the lost segments disrupt the flow of the movie.
My recommendation:  LOOK SOMEWHERE ELSE!",1300665600,6,709,4.747967479674797
