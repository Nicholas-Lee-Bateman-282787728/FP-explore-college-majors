5168460,5,B008KWHKL2,"This movie is so much fun! There's a scene early on with a married couple driving in a car that suddenly does a twist that catches you off-guard and makes you laugh, and it sets the mood for the whole film. I was so entertained the entire time. The comedy comes out of these quasi-absurd yet brilliantly honest moments, and although I kept thinking I knew where things were going, I kept getting surprised. This movie is great and I highly recommend it!",1354233600,,453,4.469879518072289

8528721,1,B008KWHKL2,"My wife and I rented this by mistake... she wanted the movie ""10 Years."" This movie was very noticeably a ""B movie"" as my wife commented right away... bad writing, terrible acting from no-name actors, just really poor production qualities. Not off to a funny start.

Thankfully, I was able to call Amazon after about 10 minutes and they gave us a refund so we could get the correct movie:
