8352211,1,B001QTVPL2,"For [...] I was expecting a good quality DVD production with tons of info.  What I received was a very short and redundant Power Point presentation.  Nowhere on the information for this product does it mention this DVD is supposed to be an instructional course.  It doesn't matter anyway, because it fell way short of being that.  Each slide was read verbatim in a monotonous tone -- boring!  To get through the DVD, I had to shut my eyes and just listen.  Some of the info was interesting, which is the only reason this product got a single star.  I don't recommend this product at all.  The bang is definitely not worth the buck.",1262736000,,631,4.473684210526316
