7921329,4,B00004REWR,"Hate cliches, but ""back in the day"", Professional Wrestling was fun...and interesting. Whether or not you believed the matches were for the most part scripted, the combatants looked like normal people, and so when Bruno Sammartino lifted in the air, then threw over the ropes (at the Teaneck Armory in 1964 - I was there) 357 pound Gorilla Monsoon, it was something beyond crazy acrobatics.
Well, Bruno and Monsoon are not included here, but the archival footage of their predecessors is what is highlighted here. We have Georgeous George versus Jesse James; Antonino Rocca vs. Johnny Valentine; Rocco, Miquel Perez and Rick Starr vs. The Fabulous Kangaroos and Dr. Jerry Graham; 'Killer' Kowalski vs. Edward Carpentier; Hystacks Calhoun vs. 'Killer' Brooks; and Buddy 'Nature Boy' Rogers vs. Pat O'Connor.
For a fan under, say, 30, the Black & White matches are a little hard to adjust to: the pace is slow, the audience not well-miked. The Rogers vs. O'Connor match from 1958 is a Classic, though comparatively slow and quiet, as forestated.
Georgeous George is in a sense the Original, well ahead of his time, with a uniformed attendant, who acts as Valet and Environmental Advisor: he applies a sweet-smelling atomizer so as to purge the air of the noxious fumes left by the prior battlers, obviously much less refined than George. As George removes his outer garment, with help from the kneeling attendant, the mocking screams could kill. The Georgeous one turns and says ""Oh, shut up"". This has to be appreciated as a element of The Little Richard Show, from perhaps a decade later. Interesting that another Georgia show business exponent James Brown, apparently borrowed the cape idea from G.G.
Yes, George was the man; he figured heavily in the evolution of early TV. There was no ""The View"". Just kidding.
It's tough to critize a package of such historical and entertainment value, but clips of The Fabulous Moolah or Mildred Burke would ensured immortality for this offer.
A great time was and is had by all, thanks to a very inexpensive, double-cassette package. Go back to when 13 year old boys would idolize and their 40 year old Moms would get the shivers over Hans Mortier; and Dad would say ""C'mon, it's fake!""...then sneak a peek at the Women's Tag Team  match.",1190419200,7,2278,4.916883116883117
7921330,3,B00004REWR,"This video include great classic wrestling from the 60s and 70s. It focuses mainly on the midwestern territories. If you're a fan of the newer, high flying brawling style, this tape isn't for you. However, if you like  classic mat wrestling, this is a cheap great buy. I reccomend it.",960681600,4,284,4.68
