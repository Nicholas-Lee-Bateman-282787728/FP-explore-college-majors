931625,5,630481089X,"Terence Hill, as Lucky Luke, is at it again in the movie where he is the fastest gun in the west - maybe everywhere. He draws faster than his own shadow - now that's fast. He is the sheriff of Daisy Town and with his talking horse (Jolly Jumper) he runs a tight ship. The Dalton Brothers show up, stir up the Indians and the townsfolk's and then Luke has his hands full.
The movie is full of puns and I think Jolly Jumper has some of the best one-liners. Roger Miller sings the title song and is the voice of Jolly Jumper. Jolly Jumper talks more than Lucky Luke does.
I would recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys Western Comedies or Western Spoofs. The quality of the DVD is excellent, the music is good and acting is decent.",1010102400,17,732,4.235714285714286

931732,1,630481089X,"Having read most of the Lucky Luke comics in french, I expected a similar tone and story line.  I was very disappointed.  They took a light-hearted kids story and tried to make the grittiest spaghetti western.  And they failed....",1475539200,3,230,4.846153846153846

931791,5,630481089X,"This film is great for lovers of the Lucky Luke comic book series,fans of Terence Hill,or just plain lovers of the western parodies. It has what you expect from Terence Hill and is a good companion for the comic book series. The stunts are great,the directing done by Terence Hill is great,though very similar to Sergio Leone's directing,and the acting is decent for a comedy. It is deffinitly a great western spoof.",1336089600,,416,4.791666666666667
