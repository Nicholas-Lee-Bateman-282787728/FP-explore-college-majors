6891950,3,B00R041BVQ,"Dark,intriguing. Drama, a bit slow moving,quite a few repeat scenes between. Ep. 1 and 2,which did not show increasing to do so",1423267200,,127,4.818181818181818
6891951,5,B00R041BVQ,I love the show so far. The scenery is beautiful and something sinister is lurking beneath  the permafrost. I can't  wait to find out. What happened  to Fortitude on Amazon though? I can' t find the first 2 episodes I bought and they don't  have the 3rd yet either.,1423267200,26,265,4.346938775510204
6891952,5,B00R041BVQ,"Although it starts slow, the second episode makes the show a lot interesting. With the cast, setting, and eeriness, it doesn't seem to matter much how slow it is. It may be that I love watching slow-paced shows, but I think I will enjoy the rest of this series as well just by the two first episodes.",1423094400,,300,4.280701754385965
6891953,5,B00R041BVQ,"Having watched the first episode I am completely hooked! Several strong character lines are crossed while even more hidden lines wink at you from the deep, dark Arctic night sky.  Does anyone in this town tell the truth? Are any of them capable of it?

Actions that seem at first to be benevolent, twist for unknown reasons. Is it possible to trust anyone in this town? Even the children are liars.

Casting is marvelous, the setting and imagery compelling.  Give your self a nice warm drink, sit in the dark and watch this first episode and give over to FORTITUDE, I think you'll feel the hook's edge.",1423008000,30,602,4.598130841121495
6891954,5,B00R041BVQ,"A worthwhile watch. Dark, strange and entertaining. Great atmosphere.",1422835200,,69,6.777777777777778
6891955,5,B00R041BVQ,"""Fortitude"" is a dark mystery thriller similar to shows such as the brilliant ""Top of the Lake"" (but more fast paced) and even ""Broadchurch"" or ""The Killing."" The scenery is absolutely stunning (much of it was filmed on location in Iceland similar in many regards to ""Top of the Lake"" which was filmed on location in New Zealand) and the acting is perfection. It almost feels like it's going to be a slow burn show--but it's really not. The inciting incident is on screen and instead of being followed by lots of talking--there are several minor and not so minor action points that keep pushing the story forward.

A discovery by two kids of a potentially real woolly mammoth could derail careful plans for the glacier that it was found on to be developed for a hotel (that would give a much needed boost to the local economy). There's also something funny happening with the local polar bears. And people also happen to be getting brutally killed. An affair, less than ethical law enforcement, an infectious disease are also all in the mix. There is a touch too much gore for my taste (I have a very low tolerance though), and this is really the only downside for me.

This is entertainment for adults who are partial to gorgeous cinematography, a real script and story, actors who can act and like to be kept in suspense.

Parental warning: not for kids. Sex, nudity, violence, gore etc..(and all within the first episode).",1422748800,309,1425,4.669322709163347
6891956,5,B00R041BVQ,"Dark, sexy, mysterious, unique story told in episodes that feel more like mini-films thanks to the gorgeous scenery, excellent cast--Stanely Tucci, Michael Gambon, Richard Dormer--and a tight, original script. This is going to be a hit, and if you like that hybrid genre of thriller-mystery-fantasy film, you may like this. Some light gore is part of the story and so far has not been gratuitous; the soundtrack and attention to dialect and accents both foreign and local are exquisite.",1422576000,74,486,5.1645569620253164
6892037,1,B00R041BVQ,Dark wicked evil crap. I guess amazon is trying to compete with netflix and their mostly dark wicked evil productions. No wonder hearts have grown cold and people are desensitized to blood and gore and sexual sin. One star is too many for crap. Id give zero if I could.,1532563200,,269,4.4
6892038,2,B00R041BVQ,Hollywood continues to impose it's low moral standards on the public. In this case interracial sex is put right in your face from the first episode. No thanks!,1532476800,,159,4.714285714285714

6892041,1,B00R041BVQ,"Decided it wasn't worth continuing when they decided out of nowhere that now was the time to show full male and female nudity in a scene that took far too long (apparently men and women share the town's only sauna - what that has to do with the story, I don't know and don't care). It was barely holding my interest up to that point and lost it completely during that scene. I have far better things to do with my time.",1531958400,,419,4.121951219512195

6892043,4,B00R041BVQ,"Season 1 is great! Season was also good, just a little all over the place but def still worth watching! Great show, can't wait for season 3!!",1531267200,,141,4.2592592592592595
6892044,5,B00R041BVQ,"I love Horror, Mysteries and Thrillers and this is a great  marriage of all those genres, with just enough drama to keep the show human and emotional. I was so impressed by the writing, the cast and story telling of this show.  You've got characters you'll love, characters you'll hate, characters that you can't decide if you love or hate. The story built nicely at a great pace. Every episode was a full production, felt like a movie. Although the story ended in the first season, it was capped off and not hanging, I'm not a fan of cliffhangers, That makes me lose interest. This had a start and a finish. but you'll still want more, and rightly so.",1530921600,,652,4.470588235294118
6892045,5,B00R041BVQ,"Good thriller/horror/mystery series. I love that Amazon, Hulu, Netflix, and others are making available shows from other countries.",1530835200,,131,6.333333333333333
6892046,1,B00R041BVQ,"What the heck is this. Bad story, slow,not likable characters. Why is the most northern town populated by so many English people? I watched it because of horror, sci-fi. Blah.
Amazon claims these are originals but only some are made by amazon studios. There is very little in the way of good sci-fi, horror. Get with it amazon!",1530748800,,327,4.655172413793103
6892057,3,B00R041BVQ,"A little baffling that this popped for me under sci-fi, and the fact that those elements are maybe 5% of the story threw me off for awhile. But viewed as simply a noir-ish mystery it's a well done story,  well paced and well acted.",1530662400,,231,4.25
6892058,2,B00R041BVQ,I guess the acting is good. The filming is good. The story is interesting enough. There is an incredible amount of gore and murder. I suppose that makes it not much different from so many series these days. It's really kind of stupid that either people aren't interested in anything else or the writers can't think of anything else. There are so many other things in the world but TV is just grizzly death. I don't expect I'll ever see someone's intestines in real life but it's in practically every other show. Ug.,1530230400,,515,4.548387096774194

6892065,1,B00R041BVQ,This movie is evil and sadistic and should be banned. Anyone who enjoyed it in my opinion need psychological help.  I'm appalled that...I won't waste the words and time.,1529193600,,169,4.827586206896552
6892066,1,B00R041BVQ,Production values were very good.  However the plot was silly.,1529193600,,62,5.2
6892127,4,B00R041BVQ,Omg love this show very weird and wacky but really worth a watch,1529193600,,64,4.0
6892128,2,B00R041BVQ,"You need fortitude to stick with this film. Started out so promising. Good actors, intersting starting plot, lovely scenery. And then gore, gore and more gore. Lose ends and endless nonsense. Oh and it is Sci-Fi not a mystery at all. Bait and switch. Very disappointed.",1529193600,,269,4.869565217391305
6892129,4,B00R041BVQ,Great series. It's fun to watch how Dan the sheriffs personality changes. Hopefully Amazon will pick up the third and final series for this show.,1528934400,,145,4.84
6892130,5,B00R041BVQ,Fantastic!! Reminded of the movie The Thaw. It goes along the same storyline as global warming. And some things should be left as-is.,1528675200,,133,4.826086956521739
6892131,5,B00R041BVQ,"Since a series/movie is all about the characters for me Fortitude gets a 5 star for it's visceral acting in season 1. There were a lot of plot lines but they were woven together well enough to be comprehensible and interesting, The scientific element had me the most since such an occurence is very possible, and therefore gave belivability a high boost.. It also made me NEVER want to go anywhere near any arctic area anywhere like ever. I hate the cold, and I give high kudos to the actors who had to endure being out in the elements. I would have bitched out in the first hour of filming and gone to southern Arizona for a month just to warm up.

6892135,5,B00R041BVQ,"Love this series, especially the first season which I've watched several times. Isolated location and people getting murdered, what more could you ask for.

6892167,1,B00R041BVQ,"The premise seems good from in the beginning. The production values are good. There are some recognizable actors from other shows you liked. But this show becomes increasingly absurd (dumb) as the season progresses. I would give the absurdity a pass if it was funny. It isn't. Pretty much every character is terrible. There is no humor in Fortitude, only misery.

It has Stanley Tucci in it. He wouldn't be in anything too bad would he? I assure you, he is  along with many other actors who are better than this show.

The completist in me got Stockholm syndrome. Don't let it happen to you.",1526428800,,591,4.609523809523809

Answers aren't forthcoming but Worth the watch...but if you've a tendency toward depression you might want to skip on the basis that there are no bright spots in this show.

6892170,5,B00R041BVQ,"Such a great show! We enjoyed it a lot. It is unlike any other show we've watched (maybe Twin Peaks is the closest). The characters are great, and the storyline pulls you in. We also enjoy the scenery and the unusual surroundings.",1525478400,,230,4.5
6892171,1,B00R041BVQ,"This started off good, but degraded quickly. It's a B-grade horror movie with some good actors and money. You don't even get the satisfaction of seeing the stupid characters (this means everybody) die some gruesome death.",1524787200,,221,5.166666666666667

6892175,5,B00R041BVQ,"Excellently written series, very good acting, fantastic cinematography.  This is a well-written murder mystery with an unexpected twist.  Minor technical issues like seeing part of a boom mike and a shadow that shouldn't be there are not enough to knock this series down to a 4.",1523404800,,278,5.021739130434782
6892176,4,B00R041BVQ,"I actually watched S2 first and S1 ( not on purpose) but it didn't really make a difference. It's a good ""page turner"".  The story has been told before (kind of like ""The Thing"") but the entire cast of both seasons do a superb job acting it all out amongst the bleak but beautiful background. Lots of side stories but they all gel together to make sense in the end. The one thing I didn't appreciate is the gratuitous gore. It really wasn't necessary to drive the story and was actually a huge turn off. I think they must have thought the story wasn't engaging enough so they threw that in.",1523404800,,590,4.315315315315315
6892217,5,B00R041BVQ,"Very entertaining and I loved the scenery.  If you have a weak stomach you might have to look away a few times, not much though.  Totally binge worthy!",1523232000,,151,4.357142857142857
6892218,1,B00R041BVQ,I found it very annoying that they had to start out season 1 episode 1 with soft pornography. I watched the trailer for this production and it was certainly not accurate. I was very disappointed.,1523059200,2,195,4.6
6892219,4,B00R041BVQ,"So much craziness. I like that everything is kept mysterious until the storytelling plays out. I think it's nice to see some original plot. I like the casting. I also like how flawed every character is! My only complaint is how terrible the scientists are, in terms of how unrealistically they handle lab practices. Like, put on some PPE, please! And, is this a realistic depiction of how the police behave in Norway? So much civil rights violating!",1523059200,,449,4.769230769230769

6892224,1,B00R041BVQ,"absolutely the stupidest series I have ever watched.  I stubbornly stuck it out to the end and wish I hadn't.  What a waste of time.  Great cast, undecipherable plot.  Too many story lines, and they were nonsensical.  A murder mystery, then a pre historic contagion in the form of parasitic wasps emerging from Wooly Mammoths that were discovered in the melting permafrost, a dying old man, voodoo dolls, murders, suicides, explosions, gore and more gore.  Too many tangential plots.  Horribly convoluted, impossible to follow the plot, and I could care less about any of the characters  It just didn't work.  I found myself fast forwarding through the last episode.  Did I say this was HORRIBLE?",1522454400,3,696,4.973913043478261

6892271,4,B00R041BVQ,"Great acting by all!! Loved the multiple story lines. Suspenseful and believable...until the last episode. The main story line was intriguing until it was sci-fied - but hey!, that is still 11 out of 12 good episodes. The other only other glaring downside was the annoyingly, emotionally driven police department that suspected, arrested and tortured people based on what they ""believed"", all the while ignoring all rules of law and evidence (omg!, detaining people without probable cause AND contaminating a crime scene). SPOILER ALERT: One unanswered question was, why was the the chief in Charlie's house before he was DISCOVERED murdered? And why did he shoot Charlie's dog when he showed no aggression until ""someone"" other than the chief showed up at Charlie's house after he'd been murdered?

6892275,2,B00R041BVQ,"Lovely cinematography and very well acted, but in the end this was really a horror movie in the guise of a murder mystery.  It is also gory in the extreme and quite unnecessarily so - lingering shots of disembowelled people and knife attacks on and by children. It's hard to understand why the creators had to go down this  extreme  route. The premise is decent when it is finally revealed, but this was one of the goriest shows I've ever seen - far worse than almost any tv series I've seen. Tucci  is great and so are many of the other actors - and the setting is stark and beautiful.",1520899200,2,586,4.3

6892370,2,B00R041BVQ,"I kept watching, tricked by the veteran members of cast, gorgeous cinematography, competent acting, and intriguing atmosphere. Sadly, it never progressed beyond absurd dialogue spoken by unconvincing characters and a plot that is even more absurd than the dialogue and goes absolutely nowhere. And either the producers require far more suspension of disbelief from intelligent viewers than the show deserves or they think Fortitude viewers are dimwitted imbeciles. I should have turned it off once I learned that the show's setting is a Svalbard town inexplicably populated almost entirely by non-Norwegians, or when the Northern Lights are repeatedly shown at the wrong time of year, or at the mention of carving an ice hotel into a glacier, or at the other million or so other items of idiocy in the first episode alone, but I'm ashamed to say I plodded on, waiting for a big payoff that wouldn't come. Don't make my mistake. If you are a fan of thoughtful, dark, and moody cop dramas like I am, save yourself and give this one a pass.",1518912000,,1037,4.8977272727272725

There was a mix between action and intrigue, although ultimately the story had a few too many holes if you thought about it at all (the setting is beautiful though, and most of the acting was pretty good).  Season 2 was fairly terrible.  There was barely any intrigue, mostly just horror show gore and a lot of killings.  Storyline didn't make much sense.  A couple of random observations: 1) The poorest portrayal ever of ALS.  I was pretty shocked about that.  2)  Across both seasons, the portrayal of actors of African descent was appalling.  I doubt this was done on purpose, but please...this isn't the 20th century any more.

Started to watch it because Stanley Tucci was in it, and kept watching because of the fascinating setting and some intriguing plotting.  But around episode 6 it all falls apart--overacting, absurd developments, ridiculous and gratuitous gruesomeness, etc.  It felt like it was being made up as they went along, and that the writers and directors said--""We don't know what else to do.  Let's turn it over to the special effects people and let them run with it.""  I guess I gave it 2 stars because I was pissed off that it was good enough to suck me in and then left me feeling like I had wasted some good hours of my life.",1518566400,,664,4.409836065573771

Why? They tried to cram way too much into it, and in order to make it fit, had to have every character behave in totally crazy and illogical ways. They also make a big to-do about Fortitude's isolation and self-reliance. To wit, there is supposedly one doctor and one ""medic"" in Fortitude. Yet I counted at least three characters getting ICU or ICU step down care. How does that happen?",1518393600,,560,4.6

A utopia/dystopia feel, but irritating for reasons I can't fully explain...thus I stopped watch because it felt like a waste and I could not connect with any of the characters.

What I liked was that the dialogue was well done, the acting was great, and the overall ambiance was eerie and dark (which I like). What turned me off of it was that the script went from an interesting mystery arc to totally horror/sci-fi. If the writers had kept things eerie and mysterious on the periphery I would have stayed to finish the season, but because they decided to go completely outside of plausibility, my disbelief was unsuspended.

I will say there is some good story development and an outstanding general theme and ""ambience"" to the nature of this thriller.  The patient development and the excellent cinema-photography / videography are really what make this movie happen along with some decent acting.

Alternatively, what is VERY concerning, or disconcerting (troubling) is the EXTREME nature of violence, graphic murder, torture, and near pornographic sex in this show.

AMAZON, this is unacceptable.  What is really alarming is the increasing number of people who are becoming ""tolerant"" of this form of negative graphic content.  I wish those who were behind the production of such garbage would realize they could have a larger audience without the extreme violence and sex and keep ALL the viewers attention and draw a larger viewing public by focusing more on a story rich plot with good details as opposed to inhumane acts of violence being exploited.

6892434,4,B00R041BVQ,"Fortitude is advertised as a murder mystery, sci-fi, horror, drama.  Well, it definitely begins as a gruesome and gory murder mystery.  If you are bothered by blood, don't watch this series.  Fortitude was filmed in Iceland, but it fictionally takes place on an island in the Arctic Sea.  Fortitude is a small town/village surrounded by glaciers and ice mountains where everyone carries rifles to protect themselves from being eaten by polar bears.  There is snow, snow, and more snow.  There are many plots and themes that surface in the first 3-6 episodes: murder, adultery, mistrust, betrayal, greed, belief in evil spirits (similar to voodoo).  This isn't a horror movie like Friday the 13th.  In fact, you'll wonder why anyone said this is a horror or sci-fi series until about episode 10 when it becomes more apparent.  There are occasional hints of sci-fi only given through music or a weird camera shot in early episodes.  You will be wondering who committed the murders and why.  I read several reviews that stated the script and acting was boring and poor.  Being a big British mystery fan, I thought the script was well written, and I enjoyed the acting particularly by Richard Dormer, Michael Gambon, and American actor, Stanley Tucci.  I don't like sci-fi or horror, but those 2 genres really didn't heavily appear until episode 11, so, I had to see how the writers were going to end the story.  Also, without stating it, I think the writers were addressing the potential hazards of global warming.  I'm going to begin watching Season 2 to see how they address Season 1.  If it's too much sci-fi/horror, I will not continue watching.",1515888000,,1646,4.866906474820144

The writers and director leave one in a constant state of second guessing throughout the season.  There are several points where one believe they have an understanding of what has occurred, but then the series flashbacks to the true events that will leave you feeling stunned.  The true cause of events are not revealed until toward the last few episodes.  I can honestly say that I did not see the ending coming.

What I found annoying and had nothing to do with the show was the pricing. Only one season on Blu-ray was reasonably priced yet the other was outrageously priced.

The location is never exactly stated, so we are to believe its an island within the arctic circle, likely north or northwest of Norway. I found the plot about the isolated town with people 'running away' from something to be a  novel idea with potential for all kinds of interesting characters and story arcs. The series disappoints in this sense, as most of the characters are very mediocre and forgettable. There is one character who apparently sleeps with everyone, and romances develop between main characters that are never revealed until the very end...something that we are given no clues about along the way. And btw, at the risk of sounding bigoted, what is with all of the black characters? I spent time in Iceland and never saw one there. There are at least three different AA cast members, something peculiar for an arctic setting. I expected more Natives, but there is only one, a cool character who works as a taxidermist. I think many praise Tucci's role simply because he speaks American-accented English and stands out as such. He does stand out as the voice of common sense among an insular community which appears to resent his presence, but he doesn't steal the show. Most of the other actors are Brits, with a mix of Scandinavians. As another reviewer noted, it may have turned out better if the writers were Scandi and not English.

6892520,4,B00R041BVQ,"It would get 5 stars if it weren't for glaring production errors which really hurt any sense of realism. It's more like a stage play where you have to suspend disbelief - like, why at supposedly -30 can you not see people's breath or car exhaust. There are also script absurdities like nobody is ""allowed"" to die on the island because they can't be buried. Obviously, they've never heard of cremation. A boy is placed into a hyperbaric chamber for days without food. The chamber itself appears to have been designed exactly for the boy's measurements, and as such this ""research experiment"" is of questionable value for adults. Why would they spend so much money on something like that ? Windows and doors are constantly being broken and nobody seems to worry about pipes - or people - freezing in the harsh subzero climate. And, despite -30, the water does not ice over.

It's definitely cinema of the absurd, with hawkish dialogue and.... don't the kids ever go to school ? But the unnecessary drama is kept at a minimum, which is reflective more of European programs than American ones where marital infidelity is fodder for a whole season's worth of episodes, for example. Character development is nil, another factor that will turn off many American viewers who expect to be served motivation from the get go. That only adds to the surreal feel. There is little exposition of the island's history or government. One is left to guess or shrug it off.

The cast is strong and it's the acting which drives the series, not the plot or the production value. It's easy and fun to watch as you get drawn in just enough to keep you engaged.",1510358400,,1637,4.660899653979238

Theres no shortage of violence, blood, sex and disengage your brain before viewing but we were pleasantly surprised. Some of the language was hard to follow so the Closed Captions came in handy once in a while. There is character development if you stay with it but theres at least one in every series that is really hard to watch and seems to do everything they shouldnt be doing. At times, it was hard to feel the cold when most folks except the police were dressed in thin clothing with open necks. I wear sweats in the summer here because the nights are cold. The sci-fi twist plays out nicely but comes a little later than expected and we did lose track of the body count.

In any art form it's a triumph if you can stretch the limits of a genre in ways that make the audience take a closer look and overcome the sense that they've seen it all before. But it's very hard to do, and failure will render the whole project absurd. Unfortunately, that was the case with Fortitude.

The sci-fi component is more of an attempt at horror, but really it's just disgusting, and they repeatedly incorporate children into the gore--both as victims and as perpetrators.  And that just doesn't appeal to me: to see children in graphic violence scenes.  It's perverse.  Plus, there are some dark subplots that are just gross.  Some of the main themes are cannibalism, extra-marital affairs, alcoholism, and graphic murder.  Season 1 was a cliffhanger, but even that couldn't induce me to watch Season 2....which is unusual:  I'm a sucker for finding out the ending.

6892559,4,B00R041BVQ,"Fortitude is a mystery/suspense show about a small mostly peaceful mining/research settlement on a frozen island in the artic circle that is suddenly gripped by a inexplicable murder. The show follows multiple characters but mainly the police chief as he tries to unravel the mystery of wth is going on. The writer's do a pretty good job of keeping you guessing as they slowly unravel the reality of the situation, although if your clever you can probably work it out a few episodes before the reveal. 4 stars from me, only loosing one because the incessant need by the director to include this ridiculous shady tracks in every scene in an attempt to make every single action by every character to be some sort of sinister plot when they really aren't. And it can get a bit tiresome after a while.

WARNING: Season 2 is nothing like the first and I don't recommend it. I would give it 2 stars if I could separate the reviews. Season two takes the show in an entirely new direction, becoming a Thriller/Slasher and completely removing any mystery elements and showing you nearly everything that is happening, and killing off characters so fast only a handful remain for a possible season 3. Not sure if they didn't think the show was edgy enough, or if they where trying to get some of that GoT vibe that every show now days has to chase but it is certainly less for it. Also there are some serious logical fallacies, plot holes, and dropped plot threads here. I almost feel like it was written by someone else, and someone not as good as the writer of the first season.

I was intrigued by the premise, the most northern town in the world, but then I'm greeted with just another town that happens to be cold.  I mean, come on, there are people driving BMWs and apparently there are more than one hotel.  A few minutes worth of research would have informed the writers just how far off this show is.

the safest place on earth - the Governor

Four and a half SPOOKY Stars. Fortitude is the first season of the glacially-paced, highly-addictive drama that is set on the far away, unique, snow-bound Arctic island of Fortitude which has a glacier. The island and town are run by a Norwegian governor, who is also police chief, and by a sheriff. There is also a Fortitude Arctic Research Center.

The plot is complex and tries to thread many possible outcomes into a web of mystery, but it's the acting that just had me hooked.  Stanley Tucci, whom I never paid much attention to, absolutely won over a fan as did Richard Dormer.  Great characters and can't wait to get into Season 2.",1504396800,,373,4.455882352941177

6892661,5,B00R041BVQ,"Fortitude is the most northern town town in the world and looks mighty cold.  It is a law that you can't die, or if you do, you can't be buried there.  But, that doesn't stop the bodies from piling up.  Also, when you walk the streets you need to carry your rifle in case you meet a polar bear out for a stroll.  The polar bears outnumber the humans.  The mystery of the why of the horrible mutilated murders is well played out.  Although, a major clue is right up front in episode 1 as what might be happening and the cause.  The characters are interesting and intriguing.  Very well acted.  I enjoyed the international cast.  I hardly binge watch, but I did Fortitude.

The vibe feels like a cross between Fargo and The Shining.  It's not for the squeamish.  There's some creepy stuff in it but i kept watching.  It flowed, had good characters, a good plot, and like i mentioned........sustained tension; and the scenery added a cool aesthetic,

Stunning vistas, complex characters, and a compelling mystery made my return certain. I tend to savor excellent television. Rather than binge watching I normally save and treat myself to the next episode. Thus having time to digest and ponder the ramifications of each particular episode. Despite that inclination season 1 did not last long. I couldn't help it. The show was simply too irresistible.  Every part of the production was top notch. Excellent writing, impressive acting, and beautiful camera work (inside and outside) make the journey through Fortitude one you will not easily forget.

And while this season has some good moments and really great actors, the story seems to fall like a handful of jacks onto the floor, each scattering off in a different direction. And late in the series, we learn that one of the ""creative' aspects of this show will be, killing off the great characters one by one. I'm not really sure why the makers thought that would entice viewers to keep coming back, but it just didn't work for me.

6892706,4,B00R041BVQ,"This is a good attempt at a modern morality tale. The troubles experienced by the characters are the result of lust, greed, and gluttony. The central mystery is an excellent metaphor for the pool of evil that grows and claims innocent victims when people are tempted by their darker impulses. There are a few problems with plot holes, but overall this is well worth watching.",1502755200,,375,4.7846153846153845
6892707,4,B00R041BVQ,"Almost completed the first season after binge watching. Loved the dark setting and storyline, and the creepy Northern Exposure meets Twin Peaks atmosphere. To me, the series was smooth and sultry, dark and icy, but had to knock off a star for a few things that took away that awesomeness... like wasn't thrilled at having to watch vomit come out of so many peoples mouths. (We get it, you're sick. But why make us watch you heaving over the toilet?)  Plus nude scenes were just thrown in haphazardly, not shown in a sexy, steamy scene, but just random nudity which had nothing to do with the story or character development. Even the swearing got to be too much sometimes. To me at least could have done without those bumpy distractions in an otherwise smooth series. So while a good watch, keep the kiddies away due to the nudity, language and the scenes of bloodied bodies and distressed tummies.",1502582400,,897,4.677215189873418

I found myself binge watching this series when I only casually popped on the first episode thinking I wast going to like it. Hours later I had to stop myself so I could sleep.

I am always looking for shows that intrigued me as much as the X Files and after watching the first season I can definitely say Fortitude has succeeded.  I will not go into details other than to say it takes places in a unique desolate glacial setting with an array of interesting characters.  The thick accents make some of them hard to understand at times but that just adds to reality of the setting.  The mystery in Fortitude runs deep with an otherworldly flare.  The character development, writing, acting are all amazing and for horror fans there are plenty of scenes to make your skin crawl.",1502236800,,720,4.59375

6892734,2,B00R041BVQ,"This is a low budget horror show set in the Norwegian arctic.  It obviously was not shot in the arctic and relies on excessive use of obviously fake snow, but that's forgivable because doing so would have been much too expensive for their budget.  Some of the characters are fairly interesting, enough so that we watched the entire first season and started the second.

However there are so many, utterly ridiculous scenes, occurrences, etc. that it was impossible to keep forgiving the blatantly obviously stupid film.  These were like a slow drip, obnoxious from the start and getting increasingly irritating and accumulating until we felt ridiculous watching it.  And I'm not just talking about the horror show premise, which one hast to accept to watch such a series in the first place, but basic stupidity that would have been caught if this had been a junior high project.",1501372800,3,878,4.905405405405405

The slow pace began to get to me and caused me to lose interest in many side stories (to many conversations to develop characters I didn't care about,  gory death and sex scenes but that's just me). I also felt betrayed how it ended in a scientific conclusion as opposed to a human one (e.i.

Like ""Broadchurch in the Arctic."" I really loved it. Then the final three episodes totally jumped the shark and took a deep dive into Stupidville. I couldn't believe what I was seeing, and couldn't believe it was the same show. It turned into a cheesey B movie nightmare. Still, there were lots of great things about the first 2/3.

It has just enough thrill that it's not too scary and enough suspense to keep me guessing.  So glad I found this!  I haven't found anything like it on Sci Fy channel.

It was suspenseful all the way through and the end of each episode kept you anxious to see the next. Stanley Tucci was great in the first season as far as the more well known actors go. The rest of the cast was equally as impressive and really made you interested and invested in them as characters. The storyline was intriguing and totally engaging. I loved season one!

I'm 4-5 episodes into season 2 currently and why did they bring Dennis Quaid into series? He just doesn't fit....at all! I'll save my review of season 2 for that thread when I'm finished but so far it hasn't lived up to how awesome season 1 was.

In any case, watch this series, it's great!",1500076800,,768,4.439716312056738

However, it devolves into a nature/slasher/horror movie with lots of loose threads at the end.  It was filmed in Iceland, so the background and snow scenes were pretty cool.  On a regular TV, the people were hard to understand as well.  We could hear them better on our surround sound TV.",1499990400,,404,4.882352941176471

This is pretty good stuff.  I can't help but be reminded of Twin Peaks.  In fact, it has some details plucked right from that series.  An expert detective/specialist from out of town.  Quirky small town personalities and many disconnected secrets to hide..  Even fingernails.

The characters are fantastic.  I love where it's filmed - gives it an artistic flare.  The plot is solid.  The writing is excellent.  I've never been bored during one second of this show.  It's probably one of the best shows I've come across in a couple years.  I can't get enough of it.  Season 2 is just as good if not better than Season 1.

This season was much better than the next in every sense of the word. The acting, the story line, all of it is much better this season. They ended this one as if they intended not be picking it up the next season and that made it difficult to do the next season.

With science discovering more bodies that are coming to earth's surface with climate change - plenty of mysterious diseases to be seen that we have not addressed before.

But the problem is absolutely everything about the science and medicine is breathtakingly wrong. I have seen other laughably ridiculous science fiction but it did not take itself seriously. As a contrasting example The Walking Dead has a major flaw but is otherwise consistent as a portrayal of people reacting to a disaster. Fortitude is simply world class stupidity. Some examples follow. Central retinal vein occlusion in a young man who recovers normal vision? 30,000 year old larvae that come to life and compel the host to kill? Thirty degrees below zero and there is slush on the ground?  Build an ice hotel with a driller for telephone poles? And on and on.  I finally stopped watching.",1497571200,11,855,4.889655172413793
6892930,4,B00R041BVQ,"I am not a fan of amazon originals, so this is high praise from a cynical viewer. I am only halfway through the first season, so I can't say for sure it's going to keep being great, but so far it really is.
  I can't put it into a genre, and I love that. Murder mystery, science fiction, horror? I'm curious to see what elements they can squeeze in further down the line. I'll admit I was confused for the first few episodes, but I think that may be entirely intentional. They make you lose track, and forget about the tiniest glimpses they give you. Then wham! Shock and awe! It makes the little glimpses that much more fun. Knowing the ability of the script to bring it back around to something big.
  The performances are not spectacular, but I think that is intentional as well. Combined with the very slow flushing out of each character, makes it so you never can be truly sure of who is up to what. You will be so sure about some of them, only to have it turn completely around in a two minute scene. The way they do it is amazing too. The direction, script, and performances are so well done that when they do reveal someone's intentions towards a scenario it's without changing anything about the outward character. You just realize you misinterpreted that character's actions. It's something else.
  Definitely a recommendation from me. I hope it keeps being this good.",1497484800,5,1378,4.492

Show can be slow starting out and throughout certain parts of episodes at the beggining; but it has a very interesting concept that is actually very scientifically sound which makes me, A scientist, throughly enjoyed by it. A scenario that has not been brought up very much but is plausible, is that a virus from millions of years ago say trapped in a mammoth could be 'awoken' if you will. It is very much plausible, as a scientist who works with infectious diseases and viruses everyday we freeze said contagions sometimes in negative 70 to even below that and the virus or bacteria  is very much still there. We can unfreeze it at anytime and usually just by plating it and putting it in an incubator it can 'wake' up if you will, good as new and procreate. It is very fascinating. So to say that certain viruses we have never encountered or been aware of could be frozen within a dead animal from millions of years ago in a permafrost in the north or South Pole and suddenly become unfrozen could potentially effect an animal or human in the vicinity of where the defrost took place is very plausible and scary. Very interesting concept they came up with but they way they played it into a murder mystery is incredibly impressive. This show is great, whether or not you appreciate shows that include science.

The beautiful thing about this series (and other series coming out of Scandinavia) is they feel real even when dealing with subject matter that's supernatural or borders on it. Yes, it's gruesome. I'm pretty nonplused by gore, but there are times I have to look away. That's one of the things that makes it so watchable and addictive. It establishes the atmosphere and--to a point--the reality it's going to present and never looks away, even if we have to.

6892960,2,B00R041BVQ,"I wanted to like this show. Ok, I did like some of it. I'll start with that:
Casting, wardrobe, cinematography and editing for each episode were great. The locations are stunning and really illustrate the feel of remoteness and isolation. I really enjoyed most of the soundtrack as well.
Here's the parts I didn't like: SPOILERS (I am being intentionally vague in order to avoid too much spoilage)

So, let's start with the tropes and stereotypes.
Rogue cop with anger management issues and a case of misogynist in the form of ""male protector role"" trope
Bad girl running from her troubles trying to start a new life trope
Fat girl with low self esteem and oppressive parent and boyfriend trope
Hot scientist with young grad student assistant trope (granted, the gender swap is refreshing)
War veteran with violent PTSD trope
Emotionally distant female leader trope

Then there's the whole carving a resort into the glacier concept... and I can't even suspend disbelief for the sake of entertainment in this because in one episode, one of the characters EVEN EXPLAINS THAT THE GLACIER MOVES CONSTANTLY... no investor or scientist in their right mind would sign off on a project like that.
I could have overlooked all the stereotypes being thrown around. I was even ready to forgive the stupid lack of scientific research on the motivating subplot of the resort by telling myself they don't really mean IN the glacier...

but someone in post production decided we were too dumb to handle discovering slowly with the characters that the (intentionally vague for this post) thing was the problem. We had to be notified it was a bad thing every! single! time! by ominous music playing. It's like the thing had it's own damned theme song. It would have been a compelling series if we were kept guessing, even just a little bit. Instead, there's a big neon sign from the very beginning saying ""THIS IS GONNA BE THE BIG PROBLEM"".

The actors are great. We only knew one of the main actors so having never seen most of the main actors before and saying they do an excellent job is a recommendation in and of itself.

Beyond the acting, the scenery is fantastic - great place to visit but way too cold to live there.  Overall, another excellent series produced for Amazon and one we hope they will continue.",1496534400,,828,4.357142857142857

I stuck it out to episode 8, wherein the obese character disembowels her mother with a fork, and then vomits into the bloody cavity. This scene is a close up, first-person view of a sickening murder. What fun! Along with the gratuitous and constant use of the F word--in every grammatical form from noun, adjective, gerund, adverb and verb, one can enjoy lascivious depictions of various sex acts, which not long ago were considered pornographic.

6892989,5,B00R041BVQ,"If you like The Thing and Twin Peaks, but you could do without some of Twin Peaks' quirkiness, you'll like season one of Fortitude. An investigator from far away visits a remote town that's beset with mysterious deaths and tends to be hostile to outsiders. The people of said town variously hurt or hinder his efforts while fornicating way more than you'd expect. The violence is realistic but not unnecessarily gory. Most of the characters are deep and convincingly portrayed. There's a bit of questionable science thrown in, but it doesn't add much and sometimes seriously damages the sense of realism that permeates the rest of the show (if the viewer knows much about the science). The value is in the believable characters, the wonderful cinematography, the mystery, and the powerful feeling of dread. The acting will impress you, given the obscurity of the show. It creeps up on you and gets into your head. I genuinely felt for the characters involved.

There's a second season. I watched it with some interest, but that's because I was already invested in it. I'm not sure I could recommend that anyone else watch it, despite its decent opening episode. It's as though an entirely different set of people wrote it. Yes, it's that different. Gore and depravity abound. A completely silly supernatural element is mixed in, leading to too many unanswered questions. By the middle of the second season the reader is no longer sure the writers are going to be able to justify all of this, to provide a satisfactory end to this twisted tale. They should have kept to that original recipe. When your first season is that strong, turning the entire thing on its head is a bad call.

Anyway, the first season, despite having a couple of hard to swallow plot twists, is a joy for fans of horror, mystery, and suspense.

6892993,2,B00R041BVQ,"Oh, man. Spoiler Alert!

I enjoyed this show, naiive Scandinavian writing aside (really, the plot development is pretty linear with a lot of unnecessary fluff). But! Episode six of season one saw one of the most bizaare plot twist/manipulations I've ever seen. It was so ham-fisted and insulting to the intelligence of the viewer that I found myself gasping: ""wtf?"". So, sorry for the spoiler alert, but this scene totally determines my review of the whole show. Yup. It's that defining and damning of a scene:

The little boy, Liam, who is cast with a kid upon whom zero requirements are made, had mumps. He was so sick, they sat watch on him all day and all night. His dad, a studly search-and-rescue guy, leaves his son's bedside to have sex with the sexy Spanish waitress who seems to have sex with everyone, which isn't so hard to do in this town of a few hundred. While dad is out gallivanting, Liam walks, half-naked, through the ice and snow to the professor's house. The professor is shocked to discover him on his porch, frozen and in a daze. He brings him in. Warms him up up. While he's inspecting the young lad's feet, the kid bashes his brains out with a cutting board. As if that isn't wtf enough, there follows the scene where they show us HOW they learned this tidbit about the sick young Liam: You see, Liam, the ten year old with the written dialogue of a five year old, had frostbite on his toesies after his midnight murder stroll. Though no toes were lost, they opted to put Liam into an induced coma. In an iron lung. From which he had to be awakened in order to be questioned. ""But,"" argued the doctor to the amazing-as-always Steven Tucci, ""if I wake him up the pain in his toesies will be unbearable. You are a monster for daring to awaken this ten year old boy from his INDUCED COMA. If you wake him up (I swear, I lost it. This review is proof!), he will not recover from his second-degree frostbite AS QUICKLY.""

If that isn't dumb enough for you to avoid this show altogether, then you're a glutton for punishment. I have warned you. The feeling of bewilderment I, as the viewer, felt as they sunk Liam back into his induced coma FOR FROSTBITE, as he lay writhing and screaming inside his iron lung, screaming from the ""unimaginable pain"" (yes. This was said), was akin to my having witnessed a questionable act. I felt sort of guilty for having watched it. Like I'd scene a beheading, or watched a snuff film. It was so unimaginably badly and tastelessly portrayed. The convenience for the writers of having nothing what-so-ever to do with developing Liam. The murderer. Who committed the murder the whole show twists on. I felt sickened at the stupidly written abuse contained within this whole scene. The viewer's intelligence is abused. So is the child-character in the show. How is this not some sadistic Nazi-era method of torture? What culture uses this tech to treat a child? Three or four days in a coma. For frostbite. He did not lose any toesies.

So, I urge you not to watch this. Don't subject Tucci to any more embarrassment by seeing this. Let's just forget this, yet another Scandinavian offering of extremely questionable writing that can only stem from a cultural pattern of TV shows (far worse than the Brits for silly linear, convenient plot developments). I mean who didn't catch this as being sickening. Then on with the show? I don't think so.",1495756800,,3396,4.589785831960461

One annoying point-both black male characters, one in each season, are attacked while naked in the shower where they cannot defend themselves.  WTF is up with that?  The nudity was gratuitous and the attacks dehumanizing.  I don't know if that was the intent, but no one else was attacked that way.  It sucked.

The two lead actors (if one can say there are leads at all in this mostly ensemble-style series) are electric; Sofie Grbl plays Hildie (the Guv), and Richard Dormer is Dan (the Sheriff) - they slowly become the dominant figures over season 1, and then dominate season 2.  And both deliver performances I will remember for a long time.  FYI: Grbl played the female lead in the original Swedish series known in the U.S. as ""The Killing,"" and Dormer is a star in ""Game of Thrones.""

6893083,5,B00R041BVQ,"I found myself being really drawn into Fortitude in a way that I haven't been by a televison program in long while, not since Mr. Robot at least. It's a very stark and atmospheric show, where the beautiful but brutal arctic landscape that the show is set in is a character all of its own. The characters are all rather interesting and endearing in their own way, and well portrayed for the most part, each one bringing their own unique flavor to this odd melting pot of a town where Norwegians, Russians, Brits, Americans, Canadians, and Spaniards, scientists, miners, and fishermen all mix and mingle at the frigid top of the globe with rather interesting dynamics.
The story is paced well, with it all unfolding in a sublime yet menacing pace. It actually manages to tell a story about people rather than just the horrors they end up facing. You come to relate and care about these folks, or at least see them as something more than cookie-cutter stereotypes and archetypes that are commonly found in scripted suspense/horror stories. Much of the cast is really superb, and they inhabit their characters in very genuine ways. It helps too that they're largely unknown here in the U.S., with the exception of the superb Stanly Tucci in the first season and Dennis Quaid in the second.

The second season goes a little off into far left feild with its ultimate plot line, but the characters and actors are still really well fleshed out and portrayed, still with the largely endearing quirks, eccentricities, and genuine sense of humanity to them that made the first season so gripping.

All in all, it's a really well crafted show. If you're a fan of shows like Luther, you'll like the gritty BBC crime drama aspect of it. If you're a fan of movies like Contagion and Andromeda Strain, you'll like the menacing medical horror aspect of it that doesn't try to go overboard like Walking Dead or Residential Evil.

6893101,3,B00R041BVQ,"Let me start out by saying that while I'm rating this 3 stars, Fortitude was an engaging psychological thriller that was enjoyable to watch. The acting was good overall and the setting was unique. So if you like your mysteries with a bit of an X-Files feel, you'll like this. It kind of reminded me of ""Top of the Lake"" in that it's eerie, more than a bit odd, with a cast of unlikable characters. The premise is actually plausible which ups the eerie factor. (And how it plays out---GROSS!) Caution: don't eat while watching.

Having said that, a few elements bothered me and I must warn you that my explanation contains spoilers.
*SPOILER ALERT*

First, you have a Scotland Yard DCI who is portrayed by an American actor (Tucci). This is never sufficiently explained, IMO. Had they wanted to cast Tucci, why not make the Professor an American citizen (instead of a Brit) and make Tucci an FBI agent? Otherwise, cast a British actor to play the DCI. There's no shortage of talented Brits out there so I'm not sure why they did this.

Second, Scotland Yard sends in a DCI to investigate a UK citizens's murder and yet it seems impossible to get a Pathologist/Medical Examiner or a forensics team to this location. So you have constables who have never investigated a murder performing autopsies and forensics being done by the research scientists (the latter is at least somewhat plausible). I couldn't get past this and I should note that I'm a big fan of the UK murder mysteries. For me this oversight stretched reality a bit, especially when you have a young constable viewing a body and making comments about the type of weapon used. Later, this same constable suddenly ""notices"" and pulls a fingernail out of a rib bone that's pristine--no blood, no bodily fluids It looked like it came out of a sterile lab and not a corpse where it was allegedly embedded in a rib bone. if you've seen Fortitude, you know the body in question was gutted so the abdominal and chest cavity was a big bloody mess. Yet she (very conveniently when the plot needed it) spots this tiny little perfectly clean white fingernail chip in all that gore and it's somehow clean as a bell. Attention to detail, people!

The characters are all rather unlikable. I couldn't get behind any of them so I didn't give a toss what happened to them. (You have a lot of adulterers in the mix. I guess that's due to the boredom more than anything else but I'm surprised more people didn't freeze to death or lose delicate body parts to frostbite considering how often these people leave their doors wide open in -17 and lower temps.) My favorite character by far was the big white rabbit or one of the two dogs we see briefly. Rafferty is quite likable but we don't really see much of him until the final episode. I also didn't mind Tucci's character but again, the fact he was an American playing a DCI didn't sit right with me.",1494201600,2,2894,4.570327552986512

Now I am thoroughly enjoying (if such a word can be used about a show with so many murders) the second season which is even better so far. Give it a chance. Probably not for everybody.

6893137,2,B00R041BVQ,"Stanley Tucci and Richard Dormer are wonderful actors and didn't disappoint in this series. The setting was fabulous. However, Fortitude Season One was a messy failure. Suffering from an identity crisis, it didn't know whether it was a crime drama, Scandinavian noir, a graphic horror story, or a twisted soap opera. Maybe the writers watched The Shining and Fargo too many times and then tried to put too much of everything into one TV series. Dropped plot lines, implausible situations, and wooden acting didn't help matters. I kept watching because of Stanley Tucci's acting, hoping the story would get better. I disliked the stereotypes - the uncivilized Russian with the stringy hair, the hotheaded Irishman, the odd Norwegian, the ambitious government official, the ex-soldier with PTSD, etc. A TV series can be intelligent, complex, psychologically thrilling and edgy  without veering off into the ""been done before"" horror reveals and soap opera plot points. This was just another series that could have been great, but failed miserably on many levels. What a disappointment. I'll skip season two.",1493683200,2,1105,5.278409090909091

It seems as though they tried to make everything strange to build suspense, but I just found it tedious to try to figure out how each strange element fit into the big picture.

It is rare that I am this enamored by a story line and the multiple angles from each of the cast brings a new wonder each episode.

6893156,3,B00R041BVQ,"This show started out perfect, with a who-done-it  mystery vibe, and got so much better when Stanley Tucci's character was introduced. The directing was ok, but some parts seemed unrealistic, like when the boy first became sick and the mother was trudging about, late to react. I think in real life a parent would have reacted to the urgency of the situation much differently. The Elena character was a little soap operaish and one dimensional, a poor casting call perhaps. All the other characters were excellent. I lost interest during the last 3 episodes when the direction of the show changed from intriguing to the fantastical. I was surprised there was a second season, which I won't be watching.
Oh, and if you don't have the stomach for gore, be forewarned, there is lots of it in quite graphic closeups.",1493596800,,812,4.8

6893158,3,B00R041BVQ,I was liking this series but during episode 1 there is such an egregious scientific failure of literally epic proportions that it just drug the entire series down for me.  WHY can't the production team just do the tiniest bit of research before putting forth a situation?  Let me spell it out for you: FROSTBITE DOES NOT HAPPEN IN THE COURSE OF A 20 MINUTE TRIST.  Sure damage can be done in 20 minutes but it takes DAYS for the tissue to blacked.  The absurdity here is beyond measure.  Please.  Please.  Don't ruin a show with idiocy.

Atmosphere, characters, mood...I am not sure but I was hooked from the first eerie moment of the opening music. Season one was fabulous, if a bit icky at times. The gore was a little much, but I was so sucked in completely to the experience, I was able to ignore it. Season 2 was much stranger, going into darker places, and some of the characters, particularly Dan, were just too much for me. The gore was well over the top, and there were an awful lot of places I skipped because of that. The language got worse too. If there is a season three, and Dan doesn't get back to his steady, redeeming qualities, I won't be interested. There was something about the cozy togetherness of the first season that was really appealing, and was lost in the grossness of the second. But I still watched it....which says something for the atmosphere that yanked me in from the beginning.

I enjoyed season one, however season two relied too much on gratuitous gore, and the characters seemed to go off the rails, along with the writing and plot.

I would have enjoyed this over four decades ago when I was 15, when I had already read my share of Creepy and Eerie and Heavy Metal graphic novel magazines, as well as many sci-fi horror by the likes of Robert E Howard, Eando BInder and many more lesser knowns that I have already forgotten.

I guess for those brought up on Marvel comics, Disney, TV dramas and who are easily addicted to any series with gore, a little sex and lots of conflict showing the rotten side of human rats put into a cage with no elbow room left, then this will fit the bill.

We are introduced to the story through the eyes of Vincent, the research assistant.  The story unfolds for the newcomer to this Arctic Wonderland.  The setting is savagely beautiful.  The landscape is stark, it's deadly, and there is a sense of dread with living in a place that can kill you within minutes.  The sound editing in the show is absolutely brilliant!!  The soundtrack thoughout the show sets up a feeling of creeping doom and of escalating terror.  The cast is terrific.  They are all spot on, and utterly believable.

It attempts to create a spooky atmosphere in an exotic foreign locale, compare it to ""The Returned"" let's say, but consistently fails because of it's heavy-handed treatment of the police activity.

6893299,5,B00R041BVQ,"It's Twin Peaks meets the X-Files in this exceptionally well-written and produced nail-biter from Sky TV. Set in the tiny, insanely remote town of the title, an island somewhere in the Arctic Sea near Norway, a mercy killing, and a chance discovery by a pair of local kids sets in motion a series of increasingly devastating events. And that's all that you're going to get out of me plot-wise. This is one you have to experience to understand and I hate spoilers anyway.
The acting is top-notch with Richard Dormer as the sherriff being one the most compelling. With the exception of Michael Gambon and Stanley Tucci, both at the top of their game, the cast is international and probably largely unknown to US viewers. Like another reviewer said, that kind of helps, because you're looking at the characters, not the actors. And they're great! Also, a tip of the hat to Christopher Eccleston for his brief, but very important, role as an arctic researcher.
As for the production side, this was filmed in Iceland and the scenery is both incredibly beautiful and incredibly threatening. The first shot of episode one is shot on a beach strewn with ice the size of trailer houses. Glaciers, the Northern Lights, the endless, driving snow, One of the best shot TV shows I've seen in a long time.
But it's the writing that's the real star here. You come to know and like these people very quickly. You almost want to belly up to the bar with most of the main characters. Yes, you may see a few plot points coming, especially if you're a Michael Chricton fan, but the rich interior lives of the characters make them seem like real people living a tough life on the edge of the world. Only, they don't seem to notice it's tough. For them, it's just every day life. A favorite visual cue is that just about everyone walking about outdoors is carrying high powered rifles.
High, highly reccomended!

An excellent program, but what I really want to talk about is how accurate it is about life in Svalbard (even though it was filmed in Iceland): no one allowed to go outside of the settlements without a rifle because of the ubiquitous polar bears, how everyone is supposed to remove their boots when they go indoors, and how no one can die in Svalbard because no one's body decays if they are buried in permafrost.

I ended up skipping E10 just so I could see how they wrapped it up.  The identity of the ""killer"" was obvious to anyone with a modicum of science and the overly graphic disemboweling and puking -- sheesh.  I had to cover my eyes.

Stanley Tucci is in charge and he is formidable as he finds murders, not so rare it seems in this wired place. He has come from London to investigate the killings, and his presence is not wanted. Sophie Gabrol plays the mayor. She is a strange twist of something or other. As the murders continue, the townspeople come undone.

A child becomes very ill and is placed in their ICU. Everyone wonders if the new hotel that is being planned can really go forth. Yet, this town has a lively night scene, young people and older with drugs, drink and rock and roll. Until bear the end of Series one we find the 'something' that is causing some of the deaths. We certainly hope Season 2 can help us forge through the mysteries.

It was more than a day's worth of episodes but as soon as I got up on the second day, I finished binge watching it. It did have a few odd scenes. The consistency of whether it was 35 below zero in one scene and then actors out without any headgear made it appear the scenes were shot a different times without any thought to the continuity of the script.

Characters often do strange  things that are not logical, that seem solely intended to shock through strangeness, while contributing little to the overall story, unless you like strangeness in which case you should be satisfied with it all..

I've only noted one inconsistency in the story line. The coke sniffing scientist apparently did not gestate larvae Into living wasp's, or perhaps the forensic pathologist missed the infestation. I suppose it is possible that because of the boy's age, his gutteral ejaculates were not sufficiently developed to manifest a transmutable larvae species.

For example, why does the head cop stand right in front of the windows in the lab as they're about to set off an explosion in the room to kill the wasps, and of course he gets blown backwards. And then to make it worse, he arises without a scratch on him. Ridiculous.
Then, the young girl in a subsequent scene immediately knows, somehow, to look on the floor by the bed to find the key to the handcuffs to free the infected woman on the bed.
There were too many other examples to list over the 12 episodes.

It was so horrific I shut the show off the first 4 or 5 times I tried to watch it and was forbidden from trying again by everyone I live with. (One guy I live with asked why I was listening to someone dying.)

And that, is the only thing wrong with the show. Other than the awful score, the show is pretty brilliant. The Arctic town of Fortitude is actually the main character. It's isolated, with frozen ancient secrets, and townspeople from elsewhere. It's all very interesting, as an old murder, and a new murder sort of collide, but you don't really know what's going on until the end of the season. And that's not the end of the killing, none of which is obvious or simple. These aren't spoilers by the way, they're teasers. It's a great combination of science, personalities, human emotion and a bit of folklore.

The two things that surprised me the most are - the lack of likable characters and the lack of enchantment.

There are few characters that are good guys, that you get behind and root for. And, there are few characters that have no redeeming qualities, that you root against. Most of the characters are a mix, and that's a difficult balance. They are decent, but human, and eventually cross a line, or they are human, and selfish, but eventually come through. Each character is a journey that unfolds over the course of the first season, because the writing and the acting are so well crafted together.

There are only some small smatterings of folklore, and some gorgeous views. Instead of an ancient icy land of unique enchantments, the town is bleak and scientific. The northern lights are barely glimpsed, no one is ""from"" there, and no mystical draw is created. The only traditional character does something a little creepy, and it is no where near explored enough, it just remains on the fringe while science and greed take center stage.

Fortitude isn't romanticized in any way. The emotional aversion the score causes is how you feel about this place itself. I said the town is a character, and as much as I wanted to love it, the character wouldn't allow it. Fortitude is the bad guy, written so bleak as to constantly disappoint you. You are not permitted to fall in love with the place. It's nails on a chalkboard.

Don't go into it thinking Fortitude will feel spiritual and special like a Lapland fantasy. Instead it feels like the set of John Carpenter's ""The Thing"". I admit that disappointed me because in reality I wanted to see and feel the beauty. Or, since this is a horror, I'd have liked to have felt scared or horrified. Instead, it just feels... wrong. Off. Sickly. It feels like its missing something.

Really, this is a show like no other I've ever seen. I've watched season 1 four times all the way through now although I admit I have to hit mute a lot when that droning ear-eroding female vocal starts in. I am really looking forward to season 2.",1491264000,5,3405,4.627483443708609

It had a great cast, the location was fascinating and the premise really had me intrigued. The first 3/4 of season one had me begging for more and binge watching into the wee hours of the morning .....and then they jumped the shark ( spoilers from here out) ...or maggot in this case. They were leading the viewer into a psychological roller coaster, could it be a prehistoric virus/fungus, or maybe one of the residents flipped ... ......but no they went with a insect.
It felt like they writers quit midway, or the producers felt the they had to dumb down the show for the viewer and decided the ""bad guy"" had to be something tangible because the viewer was not going to understand viral infections. By doing that they completely ignored the plot twist with the Sheriff  being in the house when the PHD student found Dr. S. Also How did Shirley get sick then? She never touched the Mammoth. Also why keep showing the viewer the runoff of the mammoth defrosting, just further proof that the story was not well planned out or was changed at the last moment.
This story just left me sad. Sad that they didn't go with the virus or fungus route. It would have been harder route to write up but I would not have felt insulted that they thought I would not have noticed the plot holes they left behind.",1491177600,4,1386,4.368217054263566

The first couple of episodes work because of the scenery, small bits of plot disclosure, and subdued but good acting.  The middle to the end work because the plot unfolds across several view points.  Lots of 'aha' moments.  I binged watched 2-3 episodes at a time and it was common for me not to understand the story for 30 minutes at a time.

As usual, Stanley Tucci was great to watch.  The sheriff, Richard Dormer, was also quite good as a mix of positive and negative humanity.  Life ain't easy.",1491177600,5,665,4.385245901639344

With sharply written scripts, each character is distinctive and driven by different motives, the narrative is completely compelling; nothing is wasted. We live in a land of snow and ice, and thus appreciate all the more Fortitude's visual and creative suspense. This is Climate Change Horror at its best! In a cold land where nothing decays, all disease is preserved in graveyards and glaciers alike. The risky warmth of human contact is contrasted against a white canvas of relentless snow.

Raised my rating from 2-star to 4-star.

Science fiction? Horror? And the explanation for it all, was totally out there, which did not bother me. I don't usually watch this kind of stuff but the acting was so good and the plot was quite mysterious and enigmatic.

Hitchcock knew the tension & mystery that was created by slowly advancing the camera towards a locked door. But You know - he didn't do this every 15 minutes - Over & over & Over & ... This is all you got ?
This is worse than any M.Knight Shyamalan emptiness - . Or Lost's (& the hoards that followed it) empty promises. Oooo there is ""mystery"" here. Unsaid things. Unspeakable things. Things that can only be whispered in a darkened room in the dead of night. There is something OUT there ...  Oh My.
 Ooops -sorry. There is actually nothing here. Some decent emoting, yes. (Tucci - always good).  And very beautiful scenery. I guess I gave it 2 stars for the scenery and atmosphere.

It's not the cast's fault, they did a good job.  Stanley Tucci is excellent, as usual.  The writers blew it on the pacing.  It reminded me of something like Lost, which invented the technique, of dragging viewers along a storyline that ultimately goes nowhere.  Only this wasn't as well done as Lost, and less happened.

I don't miss the weather, but I do still miss the people I worked with; from contractors, to Air Force personnel, to the Danes that lived and worked year round at the Base, and the Detachments.  I hate that some of the prominent actors in season 1 will not return to season 2.  I don't want to spoil the show for those who may yet want to see season one, so I'll just say:  The land is alien to most.  There are many nationalities represented in Fortitude, which makes the story richer.  If you like a good mystery, give this show at least 4 episodes and you'll be hooked.

The violence turns unexpectedly & crazy over the top violent (and that goes through the last episode).  The plot becomes absurd. Characters change personalities.

But in my opinion, they ended it in a muddle during the last four episodes. When you build up something extremely well, viewers naturally want to see a wow finish. Dont expect this here. (Stanley Tucci did his usual excellent job. Probably the most underrated actor working today.)

There seem to be many writers and directors involved in this very long (500+ minutes) season. This writing/directing-by-committee sometimes produces a lot of choppiness into the finished product. In Fortitudes case, it was definitely the last quarter. If there is a Season 2, possibly the ending will match the buildup. Fewer than 12 episodes might help.",1486857600,,792,5.387096774193548

When you start watching episode 1 you wonder if maybe you have missed an hour of the show or perhaps you clicked on episode 2 instead of 1 because the show proceeds as if you know what is going on in the town of Fortitude and with its citizens.

Flashbacks, in the form of character memories, get you up-to-date in an eye opening ah-ha way, in each episode.

It's almost as if they started making an 8 episode series but then they were told they had to stretch it to 10 episodes. The setting is great, the actors are good. The ending is not satisfying.

6893819,3,B00R041BVQ,This series is interesting. It was difficult to follow the first season until about the 7th episode. There are a lot of characters to keep up with. Cinematography is really good. Beautiful setting. The story line is good not great. They incorporated some twists and turns in the story which were surprising. Because there are so many characters it feels like you never really connect with any of them and therefore there is not a lot of emotional attachment to them. You spend your time looking for a villain and a hero and so when there is neither it left me feeling a bit hollow or unfulfilled. I would prefer more character development with a strong emotional tie to a few of them. Some of the violence is unnecessary and actually detracts  from the show and I thinks its graphic nature in this case is not helpful.,1485820800,2,818,4.5646258503401365

I'm a ""Walking Dead"" fan so I'm not grossed out by special effects, not even a pile of sausage links spread across a table pretending to be intestines while two actors pretended to be believing that the sausages were intestines. That scene was so sophomoric that my wife and I just laughed, and after that we laughed at everything right to the end: I don't think that was the goal of the show. We felt sorry for Stanley Tuccihe's a pretty good actor but he phoned this one in and the connection was bad. Fortitude (if you haven't seen it) is the name of a town in Iceland, but it could just as easily have been the name of an asylum in any country.

6893885,4,B00R041BVQ,"This is a fascinating show - in a setting so bleak as to be completely artful in its uniqueness. The story line is very complex, and it took me several episodes to finally figure out whos who and what all the convoluted relationship are. But once I got to that point, I was compelled to stay with it and see where it went. As of this writing, Ive seen 7 of the 12 episodes, so Im not sure how Ill feel when I get to the end, but I will see it through.
The acting is decent, but the real star of this show are the external shots of possibly the coldest place on Earth where literally everything is cast in white snow and ice. Its not a five star show by any means, and theres some gore along the way, but I found it interesting enough to stay with it. In reality, I would give it 3.5 stars, but this system only allows for whole numbers, and I did think it was better than a 3.",1485561600,,876,3.9548022598870056

It reminds me of a high school year end play written and produced by the students. Despite the presumed cold - there is snow after all - the actors wander around without gloves and open parkas while ensuring maximal product coverage for parka logos - Marmot, Lowe Alpine and Canada Goose. The use of the expletive ""f#$%"" is totally excessive - was there a stipulated minimum of 83.33 times per episode?  If there was a good story here that wasn't plagiarized from any number of other internet movies and comprised of numerous loose ends - it could've been done in half the number of episodes. While Michael Gambon has been increasingly less picky in the parts he will play (as evidenced by his presence here and in Dad's Army), I'm surprised that the gifted Stanley Tucci is in this disaster.

6893995,4,B00R041BVQ,Well played. Loved the dark stark isolated setting. Plot development and characters wound deliciously around murder and a deeper older mystery that wants to consume them all. It had an odd noir feel to it.,1485216000,,205,4.885714285714286

6894067,4,B00R041BVQ,It was a strange one but kept me watching . I was going to quit it but had to finish the whole thing to find out what the heck was causing all the strange behavior. Almost sci fi ish but could actually happen ( I think).,1484870400,,220,3.8043478260869565

6894111,3,B00R041BVQ,"I agree with another reviewer that this show is a waste of time, and unfortunately, you don't realize this until you've invested several hours into the series. The conclusion is a ridiculous and farfetched sci-fi storyline. The first half of the series leads you to expect a mystery thriller plot. However, as the season whines down you realize the storyline is taking a sci-fi turn. Don't waste your time. While there are wonderful actors and good acting throughout, the ending is so absurd it's not worth investing the viewing hours.",1484784000,2,535,4.955555555555556
6894112,5,B00R041BVQ,Great story and acting!,1484784000,,23,5.0
6894113,1,B00R041BVQ,This was a total waste of time. What you think is a mystery series turns into a really bad sci-fi. This is not well written and pieces of the puzzle are slammed into the story. The description of the series need to be reworded so people don't waste time with 10 episodes only to be dragged into bad sci-fi in the last two.,1484784000,7,322,4.126984126984127

6894124,2,B00R041BVQ,"This drama starts out very intriguing, and it benefits from the atmospheric direction of Sam Miller (and others) but quickly devolves into bad script hell.  The story could have been told in five tight episodes.  Instead the scripts are padded out with wildly incomprehensible melodrama and tedious emoting by an otherwise stellar cast.  I find myself unwilling to watch season 2.  Only recommended if you are snowed in above the arctic circle.",1484697600,,444,5.125
6894125,5,B00R041BVQ,"I would classify this show as crime/thriller, but it's really more than that. It's like someone watched Fargo, Xfiles & The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo & used elements from all of them. I was pleasantly surprised how good this show was. I find that British shows are much better than most US shows these days. Great actors, great plot... can't wait for season 2!",1484697600,,362,4.584615384615384

So many threads create this story, and I loved it! Everyone has their own desired end game or motivation which creates a lot of suspense. I just finished the first season and I am looking forward to the next - very curious to see where they will take the story. The characters played by Stanley Tucci, Richard Dormer, and Michael Gambon are my favorite.",1484697600,,514,4.255102040816326
6894129,3,B00R041BVQ,Slow to start and a little disjointed at times. Kind of borderline science fiction-like.....very dark content and some scenes you will want to turn away from.,1484697600,,158,5.115384615384615

6894165,2,B00R041BVQ,"The first few episodes are mostly interesting and quite suspenseful, although you will - starting early - gradually face more and more oddball scenarios where characters act either predictably - as in, you will know exactly what happens next, or irrationally - as in, perfectly normal and intelligent characters will act like imbeciles. Eventually, you realize that the whole thing is a bit uneventful and simply stretching out for too long; and to compensate for this, the producers are using treatments typical of B-rated and C-dated movies. For an example, during multiple episodes the whole city is completely oblivious about a looming health threat and mostly ignores all warnings and dangers, but then suddenly, when a man discovers a weird insect infestation (I won't say where or how because I don't want to be a spoiler) with absolutely no immediate cause to think that the insects are truly dangerous, the man's closest colleague and a local cop single-handedly (with no advisement from local authorities or even as much as a call to a qualified epidemiologist) decide to blow up the half the building in order to kill the insects. Not surprisingly, I stopped watching after this episode, and most of you will too, unless you have this on a DVD and this is the only DVD in your house and you have no internet.",1484524800,,1319,4.892857142857143

6894173,5,B00R041BVQ,A very twisting drama series that will leave you going to the next episode. This is one that you will want to watch back to back. It will be hard to see how the second season continues as this one ends with what appears to be closure of the season. Great psychological drama.,1484438400,,275,4.2075471698113205

Although I don't like when shows have a different leading man or woman with every new season they have, but since I loved Season1 very much, I will watch Season2 just to see if it captures my attention and interest as Season1.

It was kind of extraordinary because I felt like my mind was floating through the whole movie.  It was mesmerizing.

6894368,2,B00R041BVQ,"Things get messy in this Nordic set murder mystery; 12 eps is way too many, allowing the show to meander through pointless romantic make ups and breakups and vague schemes.  There is a ""suspect o' the week"" theme identical to Broadchurch only without any suspense since the suspects are so wildly improbable.  Every and anyone is a suspect liable to be tossed in the cool Ikea jail (you'll find ""Juuli"" furnishings are in aisle 27-C).  The mystery hinges on happenstance rather than motive, leaving the production scrambling to cover the glaring anachronisms of having Nordic and Russian characters speaking English and reporting to British and American superiors.  Someone really, really wanted to create a Nordic murder mystery but without the subtitles, so hence we get an American FBI agent working for Scotland Yard (!?) and an Irish Sherriff manning a Nordic outpost.  It's an unpleasant mess that seeks to gross out viewers to distract from the many flaws.",1483833600,,963,5.069620253164557

Stanley Tucci is superb, but the true gem is Richard Dormer as the conflicted sheriff Dan Anderssen. You might know him from Game of Thrones where he plays Beric the Lightning Lord.

My only complaint is that season 2 is about to air in the U.K., and there's no word on if or when it will show stateside.",1483747200,,560,4.081818181818182

6894426,2,B00R041BVQ,"This was a very surprising train wreck  started incredibly strong with a terrific cast, script, and direction.  And then?  Abou 6 episodes in it was if someone burned the script and the director disappeared.  Ridiculous plot turns - for example a boy who slaughtered an adult - is placed alone in a room with a young girl.  Or Stanley Tucci's character chooses to counsel another character on ""making peace with his son"" rather than fighting to save his own life.  Just a terrible betrayal of the early work on the series.  Perhaps Stanley begged to be killed off rather than spend a second longer in this once promising show",1483574400,3,625,4.678899082568807
6894427,1,B00R041BVQ,Great atmosphere. A waste of Stanley Tucci. Weak plot. Weird for the sake of being weird. I watched till the second to the last episode then gave up. I couldn't last one more episode to even see how it ended.,1483574400,,208,4.225

I agree with the poster who said it started out well, was engrossing then went off the tracks and turned into a bad sci-fi movie.  The sheriff was unbelievable in his adolescent crush on Elena the ex-convict and kind of creepy the way he smiled at her.  All these people in this place are getting murdered, yet we never see the townspeople getting upset, calling in to the sheriff's office or coming and demonstrating outside of the office, demanding protection.  There is one old guy in the entire town and we only see 3 children even though one of the characters is a teacher.  All that snow and no one built a snow fort or snowman.  The doctor died, yet the injured scientist got 5-star medical treatment  - from whom?  I won't be back for season 2.",1483574400,4,818,4.442953020134228

6894443,2,B00R041BVQ,"This had such great potential as a nordic noir thriller.  Then it was like Eli Roth hijacked the series at Episode 6 and it became just a gruesome, poorly acted show with huge amounts of gratuitous blood and violence.  The plot stopped making sense.  The so-called great police officers ceased performing even basic police tasks.  Everyone slept with everyone else in the cast. A disappointment and waste of time.",1483488000,2,413,4.942028985507246
6894444,5,B00R041BVQ,"This was an unexpected gem. The characters were amazingly developed, the acting was fantastic and the story line was quite original and engrossing. Some may think this a bit slow paced, but my opinion is that it built up the requisite tension and anticipation at a proper rate. The cinematography is breathtaking!",1483488000,,313,5.038461538461538
6894445,5,B00R041BVQ,"Wow! Initially attracted to this series by the gorgeous scenery and provocative premise in the trailer, I was unprepared for how gripping, complex, and multi-layered it is. Other reviews describe the set up, so I'll not go into that. Every aspect of the production is first-rate. This is a gorgeous, magnificently photographed series, on a par with The Kettering Incident. The directors make brilliant use of the jaw-dropping scenery: the landscape becomes not only a character in the story but a looming, forbidding presence: its pitiless, sublime majesty reinforcing and deepening the crucial role of nature in the story. (A standard trope in the filming is to cut, at a critical dramatic point in a scene, to an extreme long shot that shows the characters dwarfed by endless snowscapes or massive mountains.) Multiple character arcs intertwine and enrich the main narrative, which I found as unpredictable as it is compelling, and having 12 episodes gives the series time to delve into characters and to let their stories develop naturally. (This is the only series I've ever been so caught up in that I streamed multiple episodes at one sitting.) The acting, even by minor characters, is so uniformly excellent that it would be pointless to single out any one actor. That said, Stanley Tucci gives the most persuasive performance I've seen him give: his role, that of an outsider come from London to investigate a death, absolutely grounds the increasingly inexplicable developments and the paranoia that grips the town. It's a subtle performance, anything but showy, but is so rich and  believable that it gives us a vantage point as events spiral out of control. Fortitude is easy to follow but rarely predictable, filled with plot turns that caught me by surprise but that retrospectively make sense within the story's premise. One caveat: episodes late in the series contain a few brief but very graphic sequences of violence and gore that may be too much for some viewers. They're not gratuitous, but they're tough to watch. If you decide to give this a try, read as little about it as possible: spoilers could ruin this one.",1483488000,23,2134,4.99438202247191

Unfortunately, the writers? director? seem to have changed their minds about half way through and added graphic prolonged scenes of gore and torture (sometimes interspersed with normal plot-advancing scenes, so you can't just fast-forward past the awful stuff.)

I have been looking for an engaging series after ""The Killing"" and ""Bosch"" and some others over the last year, but all of them fell flat until this one. Nicely nuanced and superbly acted.

6894836,5,B00R041BVQ,"""Fortitude"" brings the best of the best together in a fun, dark, intriguing thriller. The landscape is gorgeous, stunning, and is the most inhospitable and unforgiving landscape behind a community that starts out thinking it cannot only survive, but thrive against all natures odds. Such juxtapositions create a dark humor from the scale of a landscape that seems as big as Jupiter and as hostile as Pluto. Kudos to the casting of disparate characters that make cinematic magic together. The editing is fast and reveals in a way that keeps the viewer on the edge of his/her seat. Bravo to the director for making ensemble acting work brilliantly. Each of the cast does a remarkable job, but the perfect 10 goes to Stanley Tucci. Every line is delivered without giving away a script - his body language is behind every word in the terrific character he portrays. Even an police interview is delivered with perfection, humor, and matchless timing. After watching the first time, I immediately watched all 12 episodes all over again.",1481760000,3,1030,4.959537572254336

 I jumped to the ninth or tenth episodes, then when

***** SPOILER*****

when we get to see the Chief Superintendent, or whatever he is , in London, calling Morton. I couldn't help but laugh. Oh a very ironic laugh I must say. There are millions of Mammoths, MILLIONS, in Siberia, hunted every year to feed the demand of tusks. It is a very old tradition, which was resumed after the collapse of the Soviet Union. And if there would have been a village like Fortitude somewhere in the Arctic, with the same kind of remains, it wouldn't be such a discovery, apart on a scientific level as for the location. Then, it takes ten episodes for somebody from a tech lab to actually analyse this?! This is as thin as air.
On another point, what is this habit in turning a story into a twelve episodes series when it could easily be in a four episodes one? Too bad, really, really bad.",1481328000,,1152,4.4245283018867925

However...  without spoiling anything, those of you who have seen it will know to what I am referring...  what's with the solution to the illness/virus puzzle?  If there had been even one hint of what was coming with that I'd be OK, but I think that was totally out of the blue.  Very cool, but out of the blue.

6895166,3,B00R041BVQ,Let me first clarify that IMO anything with Stanley Tucci in it would normally get an A+++++++ rating from me. He is an outstanding talent. Getting back to Fortitude. Initially  ( the first nine episodes) were very compelling. The cinematography of beautiful wild Iceland alone is worth watching. SO gorgeous! In the first nine episodes the series was very interesting. There was enough complexity in all of the characters and the relationships mixed with a lot of mystery and cultural information. I was engaged. However for me the whole *Ronnie takes Carrie out into the wilds* storyline was like some insipid little after thought thrown in there for annoyance.  I loved it right up to the point where they killed Henry and Eugene (Michael Gambon and Stanley Tucci).They killed the two most interesting compelling characters on the show! So I lost interest and found the entire  series ending ridiculous and disgusting. The other thing is that rageaholic Dan guy? He is not pleasant to witness. In fact SO many of the characters on that show were such creepy violent a-holes that it was a bit sick: Frank....Dan...Pettigrew.....Jason.  Overall this show is very worth watching ...because the cast is so diverse and talented. But the star here is the Icelandic landscape. It is beyond belief in raw beauty.,1480118400,,1307,5.009216589861751

Starts with an interesting premise but then as the far too many episodes rolled on all I wanted to do was see it end
but of course wanting to know how it ends, once I found out I felt like watching this was a waste of time.

6895559,4,B00R041BVQ,"The bitter cold location of this series combined with the stark ice-like appearance of the buildings and glass police holding cell are worth watching it alone.

The beauty of the setting is juxtaposed with the horror that awaits the townspeople. Stanley Tucci plays the interloping detective from the outside sent to Fortitude to investigate a crime. This crime story revolves around a toxin, a polar bear, greed, a glacier, a town's secret, and the many townspeople who play a part in the complex cover up.  The surprising plot twists make this season edge-of-the-seat entertainment!",1478390400,,597,5.091836734693878

However, it does not have much life left in it after season one.  Of course the subtext, or public service announcement, on global warming was loud and clear.  I personally would want to scrap the whole pre-historic thing, and focused on the Russians, the mines, some murders with the postmortems (postmortems were awesome, love the science side), and multiple triangles created a wonderful context for something else, not prehistoric stuff.  Perhaps WWII experiments that had gone so bad it had to be frozen, would have been cool.  Multiple submarines that had been missing being brought there under the ice due to the influence of the magnetic poles, or some other project like cloning would have been much cooler (no pun intended).",1478390400,,870,4.9655172413793105

Last episode were real up of the aerie but went fast gone which like directors and all others were looking ecxusted of that place! Hope is second episode not makes cold emission for audiences to mandatory finish story of places. In the last episode of episode one I didn't find strong reason to follow it for next episode!!!

I literally covered my eyes several times in the last several episodes, and I am not terribly squeamish.  It's like the writers couldn't figure out how to wrap it up, so they just threw in more gore and a completely implausible conclusion.  There also was just too much bad stuff going on for such a small community:  multiple murders not related to each other, rape, psychosis, infidelity, a domineering and disturbing feeder, theft, suicide, you name it.

Iceland is a beautiful setting, and a good stand in for Svalbard. Of course the characters in such a cut off community live in each other's back pockets, so there is a lot of hanky to go with the panky. There is as much as there needs to be and more. It's not especially explicit, but it takes too much of our time. They could have cut the time outs for torchered love down to the amount needed for the plot, and made the whole season one episode shorter. Oh well, it's still worth the time.

Also, the chemistry between some of the characters that were supposed to be in love or attracted to each other was not there.

6896069,3,B00R041BVQ,"This story begins with quite a few questions most of them unanswered for quite some time, while several people die in gruesome ways and the viewer is left to decipher the relationships among the characters.  As someone else said, it's a mixture of two separate stories. I expected a mystery, but this is actually more of a sci-fi/horror tale with a premise that--once you've finished watching and have had a moment to think about it--makes absolutely no sense (some people become zombie-like while the person infecting them. . . oh, never mind).  I liked the brooding isolation of the tiny town, the cinematography is amazing, the acting is good. . . but the script needed someone to take a step back and give it a good hard look.  I feel like someone missed the chance to make one good series and made two mediocre ones instead.",1477180800,,829,4.664383561643835

Not enough character development in anyone person, which could have pulled it into more of a story. The towns people were an extreme example of an isolated group gone bad and nuts. So far I've not been able to bring myself to watch the final episode. It turned out to be more sci-fi but a long time coming.",1477008000,,582,4.4485981308411215

6896163,3,B00R041BVQ,"A decent script and good acting for the most part, but it should almost be classified as Sci-Fi as opposed to a crime thriller.  Some of the acting is too over the top which might be due to the characters being inside too much and having too much contact time with each other.  Probably could have been wrapped up in six to eight episodes max if a few of the minor story lines/characters were dropped.

Characters that were shown to be highly intelligent earlier in the series inexplicably become stupid in order to set up some extra drama. Baffling and lazy writing after what had been such a tremendous start.

It's a dream cast and such a fascinating premise, location, etc. Really loved it in so many ways. Sad that it ended so weakly.

I'd still recommend watching it, but set your expectations very low for the ending few episodes.",1476662400,,586,4.571428571428571
6896188,4,B00R041BVQ,"I had a hard time getting into this series. In fact I gave up after the third or fourth episode. But recently I decided to give it another try as I was fascinated by the Arctic environment the show is set in. I finished the first season and now I'm willing to watch the second season just to see where the story is going. Michael Gambon and Stanley Tucchi were excellent but I won't give anything away by discussing their roles any further. I understand Dennis Quaid, who I like as an actor, has signed on for season two so I hope he can keep the ball rolling.

All the characters were intriguing and compelling, I was anxious to see what each character was going to do next.  This is the kind of show that you will binge watch even if you have to put toothpicks in your eyes to stay awake (JK about the toothpicks).

6896272,5,B00R041BVQ,"Unalike many drama/horror/mystery shows, the lack of flash-bang or shock & awe filming in this show was one of the most appealing aspects to me. Rather than gushing blood and guts with bullets flying all over the place, the show creates a truly voyeuristic atmosphere.  By this I mean one genuinely feels as thought they're removed from but watching a small community in a desolate, icy-scape land cope with a horrific tragedy.

A beloved local is found murdered and as everyone rushes to sort out the truth, lies, secrets, and outsiders are drawn into the turmoil.  The cast was fantastic!

""Fortitude"" has twists and turns, death (it wouldn't be a respectable drama or mystery show without at least some of that! ;), good choices, poor decisions,  The first few episodes show the initial catalyst that sets the rest of the season in motion. The characters are real, flawed, and imperfect. There's a sheriff who's never had real crime, a governor who's the perfect image of a ""big fish in a very small pond,"" and everything and everyone you would expect to see in any small, rural town. Actions and choices seem rational and logical rather than over the top or unintelligible.

And if my somewhat vague review doesn't pique your interest (I hate accidental spoilers!) at least give the first few episodes a go for the absolutely stunning cinematography of the glaciers and mountains in Iceland! Please excuse me while I go pack warm sweaters and book my trip! I have a sudden urge to make snow angels upon the ice.",1476230400,,1515,4.78544061302682

Then a few days oater I thought to read some reviews before removing it from my watch list and good thing that I did. I took another run at it after the good reviews I read and sure enough it only took a little more viewing to get hooked and then I binged on it.

Is there a coverup? 12 episodes move us along as various characters show us the all too human side of life in the Arctic. After a while it all comes together in a fascinating way with the characters.

Stanley Tucci and Michael Gambon are always amazing and it's always good to have a couple familiar faces but the rest of the cast just feels so real and perfect for the show's secluded location.

This was so well acted I even forgave them for killing off the American cop, which was my favorite character.  But he probably had another movie he wanted to do in real life.  I  console myself that the writers didn't kill him off on a mere whim of scripting.  I could have done without the theme song after the first time hearing it.

6896624,4,B00R041BVQ,"This show held my attention for several reasons: Stanley Tucci, of course, the cinematography and locale, the twisty plot line trying to defy genre, Michael Gambon and a slew of decent actors.  This is an adult show with sexual themes, nudity, and some frankly disgusting scenes involving vomiting, guts, decay. What doesn't work: some of the characters are well written, and some are plot devices with actions and behaviors that make no sense. Ideas are introduced and not explained or followed up.  Big, gaping, plot holes.  Dialogue seems ad-libbed sometimes, and the writing is the weak link. Tucci often seems to ad-lib, and Michael Gambon just seems to be having fun. Plot a 4 plus, but dialogue and characterization:  1.5.  However, I still enjoyed the series and finished it in two days.  The setting is fascinating and beautiful and is important to plot development.  Still: Interesting show, filmed in Iceland. Fascinating.",1474675200,,933,5.139072847682119

6896901,3,B00R041BVQ,"It started as a decent small arctic town murder mystery, but Fortitude evolved into a sci-fi wannabe with a hurried, disappointing final episode. Even Stanley Tucci couldn't thaw it out.",1473465600,,186,5.233333333333333
6896902,4,B00R041BVQ,Fortitude is a great show if you love a good mystery.  In the first episode it features FANTASTIC performances from Ninth Doctor (Dr. Who) Christopher Eccleston.  All star cast excites and thrills us with their many gifts.  Definitely worth watching.,1473465600,,250,5.2
6896903,5,B00R041BVQ,"Fortitude is a series that I was interested in watching because of the setting. I've always been fascinated with the Arctic, and there is no shortage of beautiful shots of snowy landscapes. Beyond that, as a fan of long form murder mysteries, I was intrigued how the setting would change what is a fairly common type of story. In fact, the setting makes all the difference. The peculiarities of living in the Arctic inform both how these characters have developed as people, and how they have to conduct their daily lives (for example, bringing a rifle on a normal visit to the supermarket in case of polar bear attacks). Isolation and extreme climates change people, which is one of the more interesting themes of this series.

That said, Fortitude is not without its flaws. For the back half of the season, the story shifts to something much stranger than a murder story. It worked for me (just), but I am sure many viewers would be put off by such a radical shift in tone and visuals (it gets gory in a hurry). Also, the plot wrapped up in a way that wasn't entirely satisfying. A few episodes were carried by contrivances - characters doing things that make no sense, in order to advance the plot. The plot itself was much less interesting than the characters, and what motivated them.

The main mystery introduced at the beginning of the show is one that has several different layers, and it is the most affecting of all the different threads. Although the series veers away from this (usually to its detriment) it still wound up being one of the most compelling shows I've watched in the thriller genre. I gave it five stars, because despite some missteps and flaws in the writing, I was rapt throughout.

The second half is not for the faint of heart. Bring a strong stomach.",1473465600,,1782,4.615141955835962

6896927,4,B00R041BVQ,"Fortitude is a very suspenseful show with a dark, moody Nordic atmosphere. The scenery is absolutely gripping, the whole thing having been shot in Iceland. It has elements of police procedural, horror, and science fiction. At least I thought it was science fiction, until while we were watching the show, we read a newspaper article in the Guardian that reported a virtually identical bio disaster. This is not for those with weak stomachs, or those who enjoy deep character development. The acting is perfectly tuned to the pace and action of the story, but I At least felt as if I wanted to know more about the inner workings of the characters, not their guts, of which I saw plenty, but their minds. Stanley Tucci deserves special mention for his low-key portrayal of a detective brought in to investigate a suspicious death.",1473292800,2,828,4.838028169014085

Set in an Arctic outpost community, the locale and weather really help to create a backdrop of isolated wilderness.  This is very well acted, and it's worth the time to watch the 12 episodes.  I think it took me just a few days to get through it. The ending was somewhat of a surprise, which I really liked.

6897084,4,B00R041BVQ,"I liked a lot. Tucci was the best. So what follows explains what I do not like.

Weaknesses common to many promising shows:
1. Killing Tucci! Never ever ever kill off the number one character.
2. No resolution of the nut case Dad other than his death.
3. No wrath of The Met swooping in in force and hammering the bad guys.
4. If there is going to be a 2nd Season you had better dig up Morse or send Lewis and Fox over with real power and real guns Ana sufficient force of forensics etc. and a mandate that shuts down the local authority all the way and up to incarcerating anyone they wish.
4. More resolution of the feeder and more punishment for him.
5. Dig up the rest of the Mammoth or enclose it in super glass and disinfect it so the threat is truly contained.

Bottom line. The head woman, the sheriff and the feeder all just walked away.
For a second season to work, and I hope there is one, Tucci's killer the sheriff, the feeder and the head woman have to be exposed in detailed and nailed to the wall by an established English Met group.",1472774400,,1049,4.188118811881188

This one is definitely different. The terrain and climate are forbidding, and the tone is dark.....reminding me somewhat of Fargo, the tv series. One problem I have is keeping all the male character straight as they all were heavy coats and hats! And I always like Stanley Tucci...he does not disappoint.

6897125,2,B00R041BVQ,"This show is like an episode of Dr Who somehow stretched out across 12 episodes, with some hot sex thrown in. Except without the humor. And without the Doctor (he dies in the first episode).

The characters are all kind of one-dimensional, which is a pity because there are some good actors, and they don't seem to develop much as the story (very slowly) unfolds. There's the sexually repressed, seething sheriff ready to explode into violence at any moment, the Spanish hottie running away from a criminal past but unable to slip into anonymity, the dying drunken old fart (Michael Gambon) who Knows Something, the island's Governor who just wants to save the local economy and cover up anything going on (think Mayor Vaughn in Jaws), the heroic city-slicker Scotland Yard/FBI man who has to deal with the resentment of local law enforcement as well as solve the case. Off-the-shelf characters for an off-the-shelf story.

And there's lots and lots of gore.

Anyway, I made it as far episode 8 and then I thought to myself, ""I don't actually have to watch this. I can go scrub the kitchen floor instead - far more fun"". So that's what I did.

To summarize: If you have anything in your life that you enjoy doing, you're probably much better off doing that than watching this show.",1472428800,3,1281,4.705357142857143

6897128,3,B00R041BVQ,I'm guessing that no reviewer of this video saw John Carpenters 1982 cult classic staring Kurt Russell called The Thing. It's about an arctic expedition slowly consumed by parasitic creatures from an excavated alien space craft.  Change space craft to mammoths and you have a fairly similar plot line.  They even threw in the nearby Russian encampment and for kickers the disease carrying dog.  I suppose one difference is that it doesn't necessarily have to be classified as SiFi.,1472428800,,481,5.063291139240507

I really enjoyed this series. The location is stunning and the international cast brings such an interesting dynamic. Other than some obvious accents which were well planned and well placed, you would never know that they hadn't worked together for years. All of the characters were interesting, and you didn't know their fates until it was time. Parts of the final episode were predictable, but I don't consider that a turn off. In this case it tells me they led me down a winding road with lots of twists and turns and complexities. It was one of those shows I had to watch when I still had brain power left because I wanted to be able to pay attention to everything.

6897206,4,B00R041BVQ,"A very tight, gripping detective story.  An added plus, the story takes place in a very unfamiliar locale.  Gripping, that is, for 7 episodes.  Then the detective mystery veers almost completely into the sci-fi realm.

True, there were hints throughout that the old bugaboo ""nature behaving bizarrely"" might be in the background.  Now this might not be so unsettling except I just spent seven hours working out who the killer(s) may be.  The abrupt switch serves to absolve all potential suspects (Yoda made me do it!).

Nonetheless, the acting and direction are so tight throughout that it certainly is worth your time.  Acting standouts are Sophie Grabel and Jessica Raine.  I would have included Stanley Tucci and Michael Gambon but they're always terrific - what else is new.

Be warned, not for the squeamish.

There is an announced Season 2.  I believe if you watch this in its entirety you be left wondering as I now do - where could they possible go?  What's left?",1471132800,,972,4.818181818181818

6897211,3,B00R041BVQ,"Fortitude Season I was so-so. It seems like a some Brits sat down after watching many of the excellent Scandinavian drama series and said let's a do a Scandinavian series and sort of set it in Norway.  It would have been better if  Norwegians or other Scandinavians  had written, produced and acted this series.  The smart guy big city cop could have come out from Oslo to show the locals a thing or two.  Fortitude Season I just had a lot of clunkers that were not authentic. And by the way, lutefisk is not cooked.

Whoever did the weapons for the series knew their stuff with the 168 grain 30-06 rounds requested by Stanley Tucci and the .375 caliber used by the police.  Now if the series' Glock pistols used 10mm ammunition it would be batting a thousand on that front.

I will probably watch season II now that I know what it is, a British crime drama set somewhere up north in a place that is not Norway.

I may watch the second season to see if the series has cleaned up its Scandinavian elements.",1471046400,3,1005,4.360215053763441
6897212,3,B00R041BVQ,"The reason I held  on with this show was Stanley Tucci. He always does impressive acting work. In this series he is sent to Iceland to help in a brutal murder investigation. Who is the killer? Does the killing have anything to do with the new hotel being planned for the glacier? Does the killing have anything to do with the weird way the Polar bears are acting?

Despite Tucci, this series has some serious problems. First, it needed an enormous editing job. There were so many convolutions in the plot and so many characters that I could have used a scorecard. When there is this much excess, a steady editing hand is needed to finish putting the work together coherently. This was not done.

Second, the affairs people were having with various other spouses also started mounting. Entirely too much time is spent on their soap opera like love lifes for a mystery series. It diluted the murder plot issues considerably.

Third, the police chief comes across as a smiling psycho through most of the series. This is largely because he is openly besotted by a young woman who rebuffs him and he reacts violently to anything which is tangential to her. He became very wearying within half an hour.

So this series is all over the map. It badly needed a writer and director who pulled the whole thing together early on by following a coherently plotted script. Tucci manages to rise above the material but he shouldn't have to do so.

I just watched another Iceland series which had similar problems. It was called LAVA. It was in the original language though whereas this one is in English. It too had a barely coherent script. However, third time was the charm. I saw TRAPPED from Iceland and it was terrific. It is also in the original language. The police chief in that one was charismatic and powerful.

My recommendation is to watch TRAPPED.",1471046400,,1845,4.641104294478527

6897215,5,B00R041BVQ,"I love it: the characters are quirky, the atmosphere icy, dark and magical.  Supposed to be Longyearbyen, Svalbard, but actually filmed in Iceland.  Makes me want to visit the great white north. Definitely not for kids. Some extreme violence and gore, and some male full frontal, and graphic sex scenes. Terrific acting and wonderful characterization by an A-list cast.",1470873600,,369,5.237288135593221

6897217,3,B00R041BVQ,"The first half of the season was great, good characterization and interesting detective story. About halfway through, things began to go awry. Steadily more plot elements were introduced than they had time to resolve. More gratuitous murders, rapes, and extramarital affairs appeared than were welcome. Compelling detective narrative was supplanted by cliched sci-fi thriller. Interesting plot elements which wasted away to nothing included both financial motives, the glacier hotel and the sale of mammoth ivory, the aborted reindeer fetuses, the chupulak, the ambitions of Henry Tyson, the disaffection of Eric Odegard, and both the love interests of Elena Ledesma, one of which sinks with the abrupt sadism of Frank Sutter, and the other with her own transformation into zombie parasite host. All of this confusion was already enough when I was affronted by the pointless accidental death of our detective Morton himself, and then the farce of a chase scene involving the greedy Russian. I love the life cycle of the parasitic wasp as a plot element, but it has to be tied more cogently into the actual occurrences in the show for this to make a complete detective story instead of a jumbled mess.  Show us clearly how the parasite moves from host to host. Link the plot elements into a chain of causation. Resolve the mysteries. Retain a hero who solves the puzzle and rights the injustices that can be helped. Its not a hard formula. You blew it.",1470873600,9,1451,5.020746887966805

This one had potential for a 6 episode series, but could they stop there? Of course not. Baby needs new shoes, so we gotta keep it going.

The highlight of this series was the stunning characters slightly under played by Tucci and Gambon.
Arid, icy, dark satire brought sharp focus to the reality of the murders that began to happen in this tiny mining town. Not even the most innocent are allowed to retain their innocence for long in this story.
Watch it for the stark frigid scenery; pristine acting and vivid writing/direction.  ( Warning: lots of sex & violence)",1470700800,,533,4.9222222222222225
6897256,5,B00R041BVQ,"British murder/mystery series with great character development. Interesting premise for the storyline and heaps of suspense (which gets unraveled at a good pace) make this very watchable. The twists and turns in the relationships between the characters of this bleak, remote Norwegian island-town are as mysterious and intriguing as the scenery. Easy to relate to people with these traits, but their isolation on this desolate, dark island leads them to believe they can act without the usual recourse.

The endless snow was depressing to me but it set the scene for the movie.  I almost stopped viewing the movie after the first episode as it moved too slowly for me.

6897335,4,B00R041BVQ,Classic European crime thriller. The desolation of the geography coupled with the isolation of the community creates the perfect back drop for these dark and enigmatic characters to unfold the plot.,1469318400,,198,5.419354838709677
6897336,3,B00R041BVQ,"Spoiler alert.
Interesting concept, and top-notch acting.  But unnecessarily graphic and gross, in my opinion, and with some major plot inconsistencies.  Where was any evidence of the wasps up until the last couple of episodes, i.e no buzzing, and no sting marks on any of the previous victims?  And how come the boy seemed to have completely recovered, whereas all of the other victims showed residual affects from the wasps?",1469318400,,426,5.057142857142857

6897340,3,B00R041BVQ,"Overall a very entertaining series! I deducted a star because of the over-the-top violence and gore which, unfortunately, seems to be requisite fare for all these original shows. Also because they killed off their most enjoyable character at the end of the series. The best series Amazon has to offer, Mozart in the Jungle, seems to be the only blood and gore-less offering on Amazon. . . I would give it 6 stars if possible.",1469318400,,425,4.68

6897344,4,B00R041BVQ,I enjoyed the series. Good casting. However it dragged a bit. The audience knew what the problem was early on and the semi-corrupt locals were stereotypical. However the local and Stanley Tucci made it quite good.,1469318400,,213,4.944444444444445

6897370,5,B00R041BVQ,Don't give up after the first episode if you feel a little lost.  It takes a couple of episodes to get going.  By episode 3 or 4 you will be hooked.  Can't wait for seas 2.,1468800000,,172,3.7222222222222223

6897382,2,B00R041BVQ,"It started off well enough. I liked the characters and how the mystery starts to unfold, but then it just goes nowhere. There are too many strands to keep up with and the story seems to get bogged down in extraneous story lines. It got really bizarre and not in a quirky interesting way, but in a way that indicates the writers/director lost control of the narrative and just throw every weird thing they can come up with into the series.",1468713600,,438,4.419753086419753

6897386,3,B00R041BVQ,It was a good series but overdone in places and missing in others. Kind of a cross between True Detective and a regular police drama. Should have been one or the other,1468713600,,167,4.25

I wasn't really told the nature of what the series was all about and because of it, I had no notion of where it has gone - which I like because it's a mystery!  It's a slow start so if you're into lots of action and gore it's not the series for you because the series spending time developing character depth and paints an interesting background that gets built on with ending season 1 with some interesting and unexpected developments.

6897397,4,B00R041BVQ,"I watched the first episode on a whim, just to see what it was about and ended up watching all 12 episodes in three days. I could not stop watching it. It starts out a little slow, but once the horror aspect kicks in it I found it hard to turn off. I have never heard of this show before and I don't think it was previously shown in the U.S. It is a British show. Stanley Tucci and Michael Gabon were the only actors I recognized. If you like horror and are looking for something a little different to watch, give this a try.",1468627200,,525,4.0095238095238095
6897398,3,B00R041BVQ,Not what we thought it would be.  More science fiction than murder mystery.  A little too gory and graphic for my tastes.  Wife and I decided we don't want to watch season 2.,1468627200,,174,4.212121212121212

But sometime maybe late this year Season 2 is coming out on Pilot TV with Dennis Quaid.

6897409,5,B00R041BVQ,This was a very enjoyable series that made me want to continue watching in order to piece together the various pieces of the story line into something that connected together. The acting was good and I particularly enjoyed Stanley Tucci's performance despite his resemblance to the very annoying Matt Lauer. There were times I thought this film was turning toward  a science fiction piece but fortunately it didn't go to far in that direction and returned to the mystery/suspense track that made it enjoyable. Some really nice scenery and camera work as well. Will watch season 2 if there is one.,1468540800,,596,4.900990099009901

6897436,3,B00R041BVQ,"Eh, I wasn't too impressed. Didn't care for or get invested in any of the characters except maybe DCI Morton (actors did a fine job, but characters were uninteresting and one dimensional) and general premise was flawed. It had promise, but lacked execution (and this coming from someone who watches a lot of shows on SyFy so my standards aren't very high...)",1468540800,,358,4.790322580645161
6897437,3,B00R041BVQ,"I've been a fan of Stanley Tucci's since he was Murder One's Satan/Richard Cross, as well as love most Britcops, so I was predisposed to love this show--and was a bit underwhelmed. Stanley Tucci is so great at any job he takes that he can even impress me just standing around in a parka staring at snow and ice, which is what he does in many scenes, and he makes the most out of the opportunities he is given to do more. That includes a big scene where he has a montage about his character, DCI Morton, working the aftermath of the Lockerbie plane attack, but really what makes Tucci so good at what he does is his ability to inhabit a character so completely that the genius often shines brightest in smaller moments. Upon arrival, he immediately begins a swing around Fortitude's circle, handing out his contact info to pretty much everyone, but through that banal act, you can see Tucci/Morton working, sorting out relationships and weaknesses, and slowly making those he encounters in Fortitude his creatures in the hunt. The ensemble cast gives him high-caliber talent to play off, and I loved that the writers used that lower-key approach to the moment when Morton and Richard Dormer's Sheriff Dan, both clearly apex predators used to hunting alone, shift from rivals and adversaries into partner mode, not with speeches about working together or coming to agreement or anything of the usual sort. The change is palpable on the screen, nonetheless, and you buy it when they then sit down across from a suspect and are in sync. So far that all sounds good, and the show does start out winning, with well-acted characters in wonderful scenes against a backdrop that stuns with its striking visuals and cinematography. The problem is that it never really quite goes anywhere. Neither of the murder nor science fiction plots in the show are inventive, and even the extreme environment element is been-there-done-that. So, if it is the coming together of these various smaller threads into a high-quality tapestry that is supposed to be engaging, the weave has to be tight, and it isn't. The writers let Tucci have his moment waxing lyrical about Lockerbie, but they didn't afford Morton or any other character even 2 lines to explain how this American cop wolf from London ended up in the Met, much less drew the straw for dispatch to Fortitude. I could watch Tucci read the phone book and be impressed with how he carried it off, but I'd rather see him play a fully-realized and utilized character through an interesting arc to a conclusion/resolution that is satisfying--which is definitely not the case! I saw in another review that this was being characterized as ""Broadchurch on Ice,"" but that implies a much stronger central vision than Fortitude actually has. In the extreme environment, a Twin Peaks-style surrealism also could have worked, but this was more like putting Seinfeld-style oddballs meant for 20-minute sitcom episodes into the straight, long-playing drama format. The The Thing meets Jurassic Park horror plot is also derivative, but it fits better with the setting and format. Still, the slow build to take advantage of the psychological imaginings never has any real on-screen payoff. Maybe they should have cut a few pointless characters/story threads and spent more on the effects budget, instead of (small, vague spoiler alert) hinging man's clash with the prehistoric past not on the big, cool dinos, but the annoying mosquitoes! Ok, so this go-around it's wasps, but even that horror is undercut with underwhelming effects, not to mention underscoring just how important even the role of the unifying, hypnotic background score is to the overall drama and movement in Britcop shows like Broadchurch and Line of Duty. Fortitude uses the kind of approach David Chase did with the Sopranos, working music in mainly where it was organic to the situations of the characters, resisting the artificiality of a unifying score. This is no Chase-style masterpiece, though, and the lack is felt, although the deft use of some 80s music in bar scenes is a highlight. Tucci's Morton squaring off with a suspect over whether or not OMD's ""Enola Gay"" is the way to teach elementary schoolers about Hiroshima is one of the treasures that comes from the show, which I'm glad I watched. If you're not a Tucci fan, well, clearly there's something wrong with you, but if you're just unfamiliar with a lot of his work, there are better shows of his to watch. If you prefer your character dramas be well-crafted, your mysteries actually mysterious, and your horror actually horrific, or even if you just have lots of 4- and 5-star shows in your watchlists already, you might want to give Fortitude a miss. If allowed by Amazon's parameters, I'd make this a 3.5, pegging it at the lower end of ""it's good"" rather than just ""it's okay,"" but there is also a lot better in Amazon's streaming options.",1468540800,,4905,4.882494004796163

6897589,4,B00R041BVQ,"I knew Fortitude was not going to be a light hearted show, however, as the episodes progressed it became very dark.  I don't know any other way to describe it.  I found it to be suspenseful and it held my interest throughout the series.  It did become quite graphic in some scenes which was not really something I wanted to see.  I would class Fortititude as somewhat of a horror genre because of the theme of the storyline.  The scenery was exceptionally beautiful which helped somewhat to lighten the mood.  It was well written and well acted for the most part.  It is a story about a remote town in Iceland and how an entire town struggles to survive and solve the terrible curse which befalls it.  I am not sure if it is ever solved however, but every effort is made to do so.  I think horror fans would enjoy watching so my recommendation goes to them..",1465948800,,858,4.379746835443038

I will end up watching this again as I believe I missed critical information in very dark scenes. Truly a dystopian film with realistic implications of a closed society discovering toxins in the permafrost. Nothing is free in this season, nothing is as it seems and too much evolves between the characters as the virus replicates. Worth watching again and assessing again later.",1465948800,,465,4.825

Tucci and Gambon are excellent of course but I was impressed by the whole cast.  If this were a movie the rating would be worse but I enjoyed this show for hours, stayed up late too binge, etc. and missing the end can't take that away where sometimes an inappropriate end to a two hour show casts a shadow on the whole event.

The violence was less gratuitous than pointless, as if perhaps the ""writers"" imagined that people would channel surf unless spellbound by blood.

Another season?  Not sure how good it can be without Stanley Tucci & ""Dumbledore"".  Why didn't Stanley Tucci have an English accent?  His character was supposed to have been from London so it didn't seem quite right to me.  The plot of soap opera & science fiction just didn't seem to jive.",1465257600,2,468,4.435294117647059

6897710,5,B00R041BVQ,"Great setting, characters, acting, and story.  And some first-rate genre bending.  I seriously didn't get what kind of show it was until the last couple of episodes.  I am not a fan of graphic, gruesome violence, and I almost quit watching a couple of times.  But it wasn't random, or angry or mindless violence -- it was very calculated and methodical.  That, and the fact that the rest of the show had so much going for it, kept me going.  In the end it all made sense, and I was glad I had stuck it out.",1464998400,,506,4.21875

6897735,3,B00R041BVQ,"It started out great with beautiful cinematography and quirky characters and solid acting, but around episode 7 it starts to fall apart. Characters do things that are illogical and seem written in to just move the plot along, sometimes in illogical directions. It started trying too hard to be creatively odd and instead starting being just silly. Too many subplots going on and too many unexplained issues. Unnecessarily graphic with blood and guts; characters' reactions over the top. By the end of the last episode I was upset at having invested so much time into the series only to be disappointed by the resolution (or lack of resolution on several issues). If there is an season 2, I probably will not invest my time again.",1464825600,3,729,4.84

I had hope for season 2 especially with Dennis Quaid, but I was sorely disappointed and left wondering why I wasted my time watching such garbage...over the top unnecessary gore and just a terrible weird storyline...the writers for season 2 especially are were not skilled.

8693541,1,B00R041BVQ,"This is a terrible, terrible series. The first season was somewhat bearable but it goes completely off the rails. After two seasons it still doesnt know whether it wants to be mystery, horror, psychological thriller, sci fi, or ... what? I have no idea. Nothing but gratuitous violence for shock value, jumping forward, backward, unexplained scenes and premises, and completely unbelievable plot lines. The writers have no idea what they're doing. Watch Person of Interest, Broadchurch, Collateral, or buy Fringe, if you want to see great tv. Because this is just BAD BAD BAD.",1533945600,,576,5.138297872340425
8693542,2,B00R041BVQ,"With superb actors, great scenery and an interesting first episode, this shoulda been a slam dunk.  Alas, with each episode it degenerates more and more, with no common threads to hold it together. Side plots and rabbit holes spawn and then spawn again; sometimes they lead places, sometimes, they don't.  Characters behave in certain ways, and then for no discernible reason start behaving in opposite ways (I'm looking at you, Elena, in particular). Horrific acts of violence sometimes result in death, but sometimes for weak plot purposes, people live when they shouldn't (being blown up, being shot in the chest, etc.).

Is this a murder mystery?  A supernatural story?  A horror film?  An environmental film?  A character study of people, or of the town itself?  Ultimately, it fails on all fronts.  Tighter writing, better research and more focus would have saved it.  I won't be watching any more now that I'm done with Season One.",1533772800,3,938,4.993548387096774

8693545,5,B00R041BVQ,"I had little to go on about the content of this series.  I read one review online that criticized it, but watched it anyway.  Glad I did.  It's a slow starter in terms of understanding what's the cause of the trouble.  But once you start piecing things together, it's unstoppable.  You'll just have to binge.",1532822400,,308,4.527272727272727
8693546,5,B00R041BVQ,"POSSIBLE SPOILER:  Season 1 was fantastic.  Stanley Tucci was outstanding, His character was brilliant and I don't understand why he was killed off.  I almost lost interest in the show after that, but I finished it and was glad I did.  It was creepy enough to keep you wondering what was really going on; reminiscent of ""The Thing"" ....or was it really a serial killer?  Suspenseful until the end.",1532736000,,397,4.695652173913044
8693547,4,B00R041BVQ,"Really enjoyed the drama and suspense. Acting was great as well. Also enjoy the soundtrack. Personally, I'd prefer less violence and gore. It's just over the top and cringy in a bad way. If it weren't for the gore, I'd give it 5 stars.",1532649600,,235,4.363636363636363
