8734861,4,B015XC8JQ6,"Ray Milland is always great in flicks, even if they aren't that good.  Here he plays a Yegg, Box man, or ""Safecracker"".  He gets suckered into a job by Barry Jones as a two-bit crook.

I noticed Jackie Collins as a secretary, and Ferdy Mayne (Conan the Destroyer (1984), Our Man in Havana (1959) in here as well.
