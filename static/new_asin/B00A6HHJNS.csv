5382322,5,B00A6HHJNS,"Whether you're Jewish or not, this movie beautifully addresses the immigrant background in almost all of our origins. As Americans, we embrace a great diversity of ethnic, cultural, and religious histories so consequently, we also share in our challenge of preserving these cultural heritages while assimilating into a diverse American society.

Sholem Aleichem reminds us of the incredible hardships, discrimination and violence that was such a prominent element of daily European life for Jews -- so much of it resulting from religious and ethnic identity. But he also reminds us how important humor is in managing and surviving difficulties. There's a poignant universality to this film and its theme.

Most definitely well worth seeing and seeing again regardless of your ethnic, racial, cultural or religious identity!",1372982400,6,823,5.523809523809524
5382323,5,B00A6HHJNS,Excellent use of vintage film clips and photographs. The documentary clearly shows the life and times of Sholem Aleichem in well-edited detail.,1371772800,5,143,5.545454545454546
5382324,4,B00A6HHJNS,"I'm jewish and grew up in an ""yidish"" enviroment  so the tales by Sholem Aleichem were a part of my upbringing, now I understand much more about this extraordinary human beind.",1366156800,2,176,4.67741935483871

5382326,5,B00A6HHJNS,"1916, New York City. When he died, there were 200,000 Jews lined up everywhere, even on lamp posts, to commemorate him.  America took notice that the Jewish community was large and could even be organized. It was now a political force to be reckoned with.  There would not be a similar outpouring of grief in the city for a Jewish person until Leonard Bernstein passed away.

What makes this documentary so excellent is that it examines not only the personal life of Sholem Aleichem, but his impact on the world.  It explains that he was the individual who ""gave birth"" to Yiddish literature. Of course, it was the language of the street Jew, known throughout Europe, but no one thought of using that vivid language as a literary form.  (Israel chose Hebrew over Yiddish). Sholem Aleichem supported the new generation of Yiddish writers, and probably a million books were written in the language after him.  He communicated uncommon enthusiasm for the common man....so both democracies and communist  regimes celebrated his writing. One of the most fascinating aspects of his biography is that he did not teach his daughters Yiddish, considering that he was Yiddish people's leading light.  He taught them German and Russian to make it easier for them to assimilate. Real treats in this documentary are the memories of Sholem Aleichem by his grandaughter.

He was a man whose fortunes truly fluctuated all the time...starting rich, then poor, then rich, then poor, then sick, then middle class. He failed in America, he succeeded in America.  His humor, best known through his character ""Tevye the Dairyman -  is tinged with tragedy.  This DVD states it best - that he was that kind of Jew who questioned his place in a changing society and like Job and Abraham (and yes in the form of Tevye) questioned God himself.

All Jewish families with European roots should see this...but the story is truly universal. The Rotten Tomatoes website lists it as on its top 100 films of all time and while that is too high a score, nevertheless, it is the best documentary I have seen in years. The music is well thought out - and so are the 200 archival photos of Yiddish shtetl life that are necessary to illustrate the kinds of personalities that appear in Sholem Aleichem's forty books.  The commentators give opinions on why his stories touched so many souls, why he saved Yiddish, and how he used parts of his life experience to create unforgettable characters.  He saw the roots of the Holocaust in the pograms in Russia and described their horror. But he also could communicate infectious enthusiasm for the real dignity of the average man trying to make a living and raise a good family.  That is why Sholom Aleichem was popular when he was alive...he became an international success in the 1960's and 1970's...and he will always be popular in the future.",1365984000,17,2851,4.823408624229979

5382329,4,B00A6HHJNS,"A very nice documentary about the man who first wrote the stories of ""Tevye the Milkman"" which became the basis for the musical ""Fiddler on the Roof."" The documentary can also serve as an invitation to better appreciate the Romantic movement of the time, which helped produce most of the modern nation states of Europe as well as the modern state of Israel.",1363046400,2,357,4.682539682539683

8546961,5,B00A6HHJNS,"Everything about this movie is great. It not only gives you the subject's biography, it also gives you samples of the author's writing so you have some idea of why he was great and why he was called the Jewish Mark Twain. It also puts his life and work into a social and literary context both then and now. (One of the experts interviewed, with a touch of irony worthy of the author, points out that Aleichem has done remarkably well since his death.) The documentary even captures Aleichem's remarkable ability to go outside of himself and see the world as other's see it. For example, his own experience of America was unsatisfactory and he found it unfortunate that he had to end his days there, but this did not stop him from understanding and appreciating the fact that a great many of his fellow Jews loved America and thrived there. You will especially enjoy this movie if you don't need to watch the closed captions, which were obviously composed by persons who have no knowledge of the Yiddish language, Jewish culture and religion-everything that this movie is about. Other than that, the people responsible for the captioning (I tried but could not find their ""credit"") do a terrific job.",1436054400,,1199,4.714285714285714

8546966,4,B00A6HHJNS,"A beguiling and informative documentary about a seminal artist that pulls the viewer into a now-vanished world with a plethora of photos and effective use of audial elements. Co-existent tragic and comic elements of Aleichem and his people are communicated via indelible images underscored by the writer's own words. There are a few too many intercut interviews, but overall, ""Laughing in the Darkness"" was well-worth the few dollars I spent on the rental. It served as both a useful research tool and an enriching emotional experience.",1405468800,,536,5.244186046511628
