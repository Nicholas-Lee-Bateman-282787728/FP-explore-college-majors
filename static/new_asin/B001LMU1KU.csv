3687131,4,B001LMU1KU,"Okay, it's based on a true story. Hollywood thinks true stories are BORING, so they add some b.s. To make it more thrilling, throw the script in a blender, add salt, and cheese, set to puree for 90 minutes and strain through a yellow light filter and sprinkled with whiffle powder. There! A fluffy souffl!
Jeff Bridges does a fantastic job and makes this Hollywood character seem real. There's a lot to nitpick about this film but the entertainment value is strong enough to forgive the inaccuracies and outright lies in the narrative. In the end it doesn't matter. Tucker made his car, failed, and moved on to his next invention, just like he did before the Tucker Torpedo. It was just one invention of many from a man who was a bit of a genius.",1494460800,,746,4.492647058823529

3687205,2,B001LMU1KU,"For those who have seen the movie Steve Jobs, you will have a feel for what Tucker could have been.  Instead, Tucker, thanks in great part to Jeff Bridges, turned what should have been an excellent movie into a Roger Rabbit part real, part cartoon type movie and ruined it.  Furthermore, the movie spent so much efffort trying to prove conspiracy by the Big Three against Tucker and the complicity of the Government that instead of defining Tucker the man, made him at bit of a naive buffoon.  Which I'm confident he wasn't.  All told, it was stupid.",1471651200,,550,4.581632653061225
3687206,5,B001LMU1KU,"This is a fascinating story rendered by the Academy Award winning director, Francis Ford Coppola. Jeff Bridges plays Preston Tucker and Lloyd Bridges actually has a cameo as Tucker's antagonist Michigan Senator Ferguson. He was a stooge for the big three who wanted to thwart this upstart auto company. Litigation that exonerated Tucker still prevented his auto company's success.",1470441600,,380,5.4576271186440675

3687274,4,B001LMU1KU,The movie is based on a true story and shows the creative efforts of an American entrepreneur. It starts out a bit slow but builds to the end when you are rooting for the underdog to win. Loyalty of family and friends is emphasized throughout the story. The movie was recommended to me by a someone who knew the story of the Tucker car and had seen the movie when it first came out.,1458604800,,382,4.175675675675675

3687277,5,B001LMU1KU,"While this movie has been around since the late 1980s, the story is compelling.  Preston Tucker was a larger-than-life car guy, a dreamer, a promoter and an idealist.  At the end of World War II, he was the car-guy equivalent of Senator Ted Cruz to his fellow Senate Republicans.  This movie romanticizes the Tucker story.  While many of the parts of the movie story-line are correct, many serious automobile historians today conclude that the largest contributor to the Tucker 48's demise was Preston Tucker himself and the lack of money.  (At this same time, wealthy industrialist Henry J. Kaiser and veteran automobile sales manager Joseph Frazer launched Kaiser-Frazer..).  Francis Ford Coppolla has made a visually-compelling story that even those whom are not gearheads can enjoy.  Well worth the time to watch",1458086400,,816,5.183206106870229

3687334,5,B001LMU1KU,"On one hand, a terribly inspiring film....on another hand, a terribly realistic film about someone that dared to 'butt heads' with the country's true owners.  The power brokers that spend their entire lives building a fifedom, they don't need to raise their voices, they speak in rhymes, tv talk and soliloquy.  And raw engineering, real passion, is something that honestly, this country isn't cut out for, its not something any decade of leadership wished to encounter, of any political party.  The owners of the country fear innovation.  It has nothing to do with doing the right thing.  Coppola espouses these values of corporate and governmental protectionism, in the face of the 24 hour, work to the bone Preston Tucker and his small band.  A favorite film.  The DVD widescreen presents quite well, colours all mixed and chosen thoughtfully, well directed by Mr. Coppola who brings his own car stories, and indeed, his own Tucker stories into pre-production.  A must see for anyone that wonders why more doesn't 'get done' in America.",1448582400,,1039,5.035087719298246

3687339,5,B001LMU1KU,"I had seen this movie a long time ago and wanted to see it again. I finally found it here on Amazon.. Jeff Bridges masterfully portrays an out of the box imaginative automaker. His inventions for automobiles in the late 1940s are now standard almost universally on all cars,. but how can one man stand up to big business? This is a picture hope and the American spirit that says ""We can do it if we try and if we care.""",1445904000,,419,4.185185185185185
3687340,4,B001LMU1KU,"Great story, if a little changed from reality for this film. I did find it a bit ""uneven"" in the first half - frankly I expected better from Coppola. However, all that is more than made up for with the second half of the film which is mostly true to reality, and above all - quite educational in terms of showing the dangers of big business destroying innovative geniuses like Tucker. As one Detroit CEO said it: it is cheaper to destroy the competition than to have to innovate yourself. I guess he was right, and the proof is in the pudding: look at Detroit today and quality of American cars - they are a joke in the automotive world (with very few notable exceptions).",1445904000,,672,4.384

3687431,5,B001LMU1KU,"If you are fortunate, you will take away from this movie the knowledge as to how America, who at one time manufactured 85 out of every 100 cars produced on the face of the planet,  has dropped to a mere 25,  costing America trillions of dollars and millions of jobs - an industry that once represented 20% of our national gross products and 1 in every 5 jobs.

This movie was a harbinger of my own life (amectranelectriccars.com), so I took great interest in it. Reading and researching everything I could find. What I found was that while the characters and in particular Preston himself seem eccentric, there is no question that persons such as ourselves are very eccentric - a requirement to developing a great dream and bringing it to fruition. His movements appearing larger than life leaves the viewer with an insight into what might make him tick, if one is fortunate enough to believe the character as portrayed  - Spielberg did an excellent job of portraying Tucker as I see him and myself in his trials and tribulations. Events still in place today, and that more importantly it is about a dastardly process that has hurt all Americans - some of Hollywood sprinkled in, but step by step the true story. Seeing for oneself, the same government corruption to help the auto industry deny the public better technology, 50 years later, there has been no change. Tucker needed financing to produce a better product, but the auto industry did not need more competition. Tucker makes his family part and parcel of the process of birthing a new automobile, which was a saving grace, and certainly, a wonderful aspect of this film, His first venture with the machinegun turret for the military provided entertainment and excitement for his family as they drive pell mell down the road.  But enthusiasm quickly arrives upon reality.

Machinations must become the deal by which this dream can be accomplished but the war of ego rears its ugly head. Espionage and intrigue, Tucker and his family are suckered (manipulated is such a tame word) into thinking they have moved from that ominous, foreboding specter of failure into the joys of seemingly successful fruition of the car's introduction to the world - short lived by those miscreants who, for the sake of the auto industry, so deftly destroyed a great product. An incredible effort to make the essential number of cars to qualify is ignored as accomplishment means nothing, contract, dispelled, honor and integrity no where in sight. The final court scene shows what we have all become accustomed too, the government destroys at will - but always with the power of a smug knowing rational - the proverbial rotten excuse to protect power at the expense of the American people. Tucker's car worked then, and now 50 years later, some are still working. I'm only giving you a glimpse or two, because if you don't like big guys picking on little guys, or government and industry corruption that could happen to you - you definitely want to witness this denouement.",1431216000,,3014,4.820116054158607

The rich seem to always want all the money and this shows, no mater how hard you, or how good your product is, you will always be dealing with the status quo and the pitfalls of having something better than is being produced now.
The story is a bit protracted, for my views, but the story gets through. The car was better than anything out there and would still be a top winner today. Designs change, but there is no substitution for quality and integrity.

3687583,4,B001LMU1KU,"I'm in the distinct minority here, but I thought that Tucker was very good, just short of excellent.  Francis Ford Coppola presents a vignette on the American dream, the American inventor, in this case concerning car magnate Preston Tucker.  Jeff Bridges does a great job showing the enthusiasm and relative naivete of Tucker, a 'babe in the woods' comparatively when confronting 'big business' that controlled, and still control, the auto industry.  Of course, this is because auto production requires enormous capital and not due to any conspiracy as the film tries to show.
The plot, which very (very!) loosely follows the true story in re Tucker, shows him as an industrialist supplying armaments to the war department for World War II.  After the war ends, he wants to put out a really good car to meet the huge new demand for cars now that the war restrictions were lifted.  So, he designs a rear engined car that is (presumably) much safer than the Detroit offerings.  Thereafter, we see him attempt to succeed, but fail, due to subterfuge and sabotage by agents of the Big Three.
Truth be told, this is a cute, and innocent, interpretation of the 'true story'.  Realistically, Tucker just tried to do an immensely difficult thing(entering the car business) and fell short.  No conspiracies were necessary to stop him.  In fact, evidence shows that any conspiracies might've been his, or his assistant(brilliantly played by Martin Landau) in overselling the car and franchises to sell it.",1412899200,,1495,4.995967741935484

It is kind of like, who killed the electric car, or why there had not been a bigger push for solar power back in the 50's, as opposed to nuclear, which if you were expecting the planet to end before the 21st century, may not have been the worst idea, but when the sun stops providing energy, we will already be dead.

3687654,4,B001LMU1KU,"From what I've been able to find out, ultimately this movie is a true story. Some of the details may have been massaged for the movie, but the story is true.

I first saw this one in theaters when it was released, and have since owned a copy on both VHS and DVD. It is thoroughly entertaining and thought provoking.

For cinephiles, seeing son and dad not only act in the same movie, but having scenes together where ultimately they each represent the two sides of the conflict, is something that doesn't happen often!

it is an easy story to watch, and treat on the eyes. From the settings to the color tones to the overall mood, it is an easy movie to fall into.

Jeff Bridges' portrayal of 'a good man you just can't keep down' is inspired. A story of someone unafraid to give an idea a try, back in the glory days when just about anyone could do that!

I had never heard of the Tucker automobile before this movie. After I saw it I told my Dad about it...and he knew exactly what it was. That's because HIS dad ran a garage, and he was trying to get his Dad to get into selling Tuckers!",1399766400,,1090,4.196172248803828

What a shame that Preston Tucker is not a person who is as well known as Ford or Edison. He was truly ahead of his time.

I'm surprised it didn't make it to the silver screen before this film (1988).  Jeff Bridges did a fine job of imparting Tucker's spirit of never letting problems and failure discourage him from following his dream.  The fact his, he did build 50 cars and many of them still survive today, and the actual cars were brought together at the end of this film.  You'll never get to see that many genuine Tuckers all at one time again.  Even though Tucker's venture failed, you don't feel sad for him, because you know he gave it his all.

The supporting cast was good, especially Martin Landau. I particularly enjoyed seeing most of the existing Tucker cars in the movie. Most of the non-Tucker cars were period-correct, adding to the credibility of the film.

The downside was the constant display of cigarette smoking. I thought at times I was watching a commercial for a tobacco company. I understand a lot of people in the 30s smoked; I just thought the depiction of smoking in the movie was over the top.

3687747,5,B001LMU1KU,"Tucker's early auto experience  came from working on a Ford assembly line, developing and making Indy race cars, and creating the 'Tucker Tiger' armored combat car

The Tucker car was conceived by Preston Tucker and briefly produced (only 51 made) in 1948 Chicago before the company folded in early March 1949 due to negative publicity, and an SEC investigation and heavily publicized stock fraud trail reportedly motivated by sensitivity to a prior fraud by Kaiser-Frazer (Tucker was acquitted of all charges). At the time of the investigation, Tucker had hired over 1,900 employees. The car's original proposed price was about $2,500, but ended up closer to $4,000. Current value is about $1.5 million.

Tucker's design called for a water-cooled aluminum rear engine, disc brakes, all-around independent suspension, fuel injection, windows that would pop out in the event of a crash, and padding for safety. It also had a directional third headlight that would light  the path around corners. Engine and transmission were mounted on a separate sub-frame secured with only six bolts, enabling it to be removed and replaced with a loaner engine in 30 minutes. The disc brakes, fuel injection, self-sealing tubeless tires, hydraulic-operated valves, and direct-drive torque converter transmission were all dropped because of cost and lack of time to develop.

My only question - I'm really not certain why the firm closed.",1385424000,,1421,5.297777777777778

3687781,4,B001LMU1KU,"Color me surprised, but I really liked this movie.  On the outset, I just thought it was going to be a bore, but Francis Ford Coppola and the film's star, Jeff Bridges, bring so much flash and life and overall presence to this film that I couldn't help but get sucked into every frame.

The film centers on Preston Tucker.  I was unaware that this was a biopic, but thought that it was a fictional story until the very end of the film where I was told that it was a true story.  I love that.  Tucker's story is a simple one.  He had a dream, to make the car of the future, and through his own determination and inhibition, he almost brought that dream to life.  He got the funds and started his long journey towards fulfilling that dream, only to have it shot down by hotshots in fear of the competition and wound up having to defend his own work before a jury.

With great style that never takes the place of substance, Coppola crafts an expert film that lives and breathes an era and jumps to life scene after scene.  With a rich score and impressive technical aspects (those costumes and sets are lavish and beautiful) and an ensemble that embody the emotional tones of the film, `Tucker: The Man and His Dream' makes the most of its title and gives us a dreamy retelling of an inspiring story.  While Landau walked away with the only acting nomination here, it is the film's core, Jeff Bridges, who deserves to be singled out.  With equal parts comedic brilliance and dramatic underscoring, Bridges creates a real man with ambitions that overtake his simple existence.  I particularly loved his closing speech because it puts all the other courtroom actors to shame.  He knows how to sell a monologue, and he did so with grace, style and presence.

This is a fun film that has something to say and it says it well.  I was blindsided here, and that doesn't happen all too often!",1376870400,,1881,4.443148688046647

I watched this with my girlfriend, who knew nothing of the Tucker car. To my surpise, she enjoyed the movie almost as much as I did. Now she can recognize a Tucker, though now they are a rarity indeed.

The Tucker fiasco retarded automobile development more than a decade.  Subsequent  government interference in the auto industry through safety, CAFE, and other regulations has established insurmountable barriers to entry while eliminating experimentation, creativity, and innovation.  We no longer choose cars we want; we are compelled to buy products of which the government approves.

3687860,3,B001LMU1KU,"Tucker: The Man And His Dream is a good solid film, but, as Coppola himself seems to realize (in his commentary), it's nothing special. Its stylized realism is appealing, but ultimately an empty appeal to nothing of substance. That's too bad, because throughout the film I was thinking that there is gold to be mined in the old adage that not all who think that others are out to get them are crazy. Trust me, I know. But this theme is not really even touched on in the film, and only glancingly so in the commentary by Coppola, when the filmmaker muses that newer Internet technology likely makes it easier to succeed against the powers that be (no quite so, Francis!). Nonetheless, the cumulative positives slightly outweigh the negatives, and even if they did not, the film's historical focus deserves viewing.

The essence of Tucker is captured in its sub- title: The Man and His Dream. In one of the last scenes, when Tucker thinks he is about to lose his case in court, his attorney is trying to explain the consequences he is about to face. ""Forget about the car and all of that,"" says Tucker, ""It's the idea, and the dream, that count! That is the story and the great meaning of this inspiring movie, It's the idea, and the dream, that count.

Although only about 50 cars were made (Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, MI has one) Preston Tucker never mass produced the car, in part, because of corrupt politicians and the competition that fought hard to keep Tucker out of their market.

The acting is excellent, and the story is inspirational, even with the education that being an innovator can be a full of obsticles in a country controlled by plutocrats and organized criminals.  My guess is that the movie hits home even more today and that is why this movie is hard to find, while movies about puppets, idiots, and sheep working to protect the status quo and corporate rights are promoted.

More truthful movies like this and about men like Gen. MacArthur, JFK/RFK, and Andrew Jackson would be appreciated.  Men that worked hard to prevent America from becoming the second rate nation of mercenaries and criminals it has become, might be what we need.  Or a least a new look at why we supported murderers like Stalin, let the banker traitors like Prescott Bush who financially supported the Nazis continue to live in the USA, why Eisenhower fire bombed civilians in WWII, and why Truman bombed Japan and supported the communists among many other crimes.",1332115200,,1211,4.77511961722488
3687907,5,B001LMU1KU,"I'm a fan of George Lucas, and somewhat of Francis Ford Coppola (but not for the same reasons as most). Way back before George Lucas and FFC were famous, they were friends and film students full of youthful idealism. And when that idealism shines through, you get great movies. Movies like Finian's Rainbow and American Graffiti. While people still remember Steven Spielberg's early films like Jaws, E.T., and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and side movies between blockbusters like The Terminal and Catch Me If You Can (Oscar nominations help) people tend to forget anything that FFC and George Lucas worked on other than Star Wars and The Godfather. That's a crying shame...because in among the other projects are films like this...one of the most delightful, well-made, well-acted, and overall SUPERB films ever made.

The Cinema of George Lucas

The film may have been directed by FFC but it has George Lucas written all over it (Executive Producer and his production company LucasFilm was used for this film). He loved classic cars and the feel of the United States before it became all about big corporations and all of the heart and soul was squashed out of the little men with big dreams who built the country (Lucas always viewed himself as the little guy fighting the big bad corporations).

Some might immediately think George Lucas would ruin a movie like this, but when teamed up with FFC, it comes across as the very best of both film makers. True, there's a slight...coolness to the film style (as opposed to warmth) that's reminiscent of Indiana Jones, Star Wars, ect. But here it's far more stylish than aloof (as opposed to say...the Phantom Menace). You CLEARLY see Lucas' style of film-making influencing the film throughout from the film composition to the overall indefinable FEEL of the film (almost as if he was standing behind FFC the whole time making suggestions for how to make the film).

Francis Ford Copola

To be sure, Francis Ford Coppola deserves full credit for a textbook perfect job directing this film. When I watched the film and listened to the excellent commentary his idealism and child-like love of film-making and the subject of the film can't help but shine through, and you can see how that spirit that pervades the film saved it from being a downer film about a failed man and instead turned it into a great story about the great automotive company that almost was a great American enterprise (and instead was just a great attempt).

On to the film....

To be sure, this movie is just about perfect. It's got drama (from a car nearly falling on one of the engineers while building the prototype to the courtroom defense of the auto company's behavior), comedy (serving rare beef to government officials while showing a slideshow of auto fatalities that resulted from not wearing seatbelts), family togetherness (the son telling the father he wants to be like him), and tear-jerker moments (when their investor tells Tucker with tears in his eyes for the first time in his life he is ashamed because Tucker's kids will know he served prison time). The film is a breezy 110 minutes that passes like an hour and half, and never stops entertaining you until the credits finish rolling.

The Actors

We have Jeff Bridges as the title character Tucker, Christian Slater as his son (this movie started my Christian Slater obsession), the legendary Mako as one of his engineers (Uncle Iroh from Avatar:The Last Air Bender), Lloyd Bridges as a corrupt politician out to destroy Tucker, and Martin Landau as his investor/business partner in a role that SHOULD have won him a Best Supporting Actor nomination. Everyone in this film is great but those are the stand-outs. Perfect, perfect, perfect.

The sound

The sound for this film has the awesome rock solid sound of a high budget film that Lucas' Skywalker Sound worked on (despite being a more low-key film) and hence has flawless sound production and a fun soundtrack (that had me start yelling ""Hold that Tiger!!!"" for weeks).

The Picture

This is a BEAUTIFUL film that's expertly shot and uses every film trick for slick visual effect (split walls for phone calls ect) but never over-uses said tricks. It's a good DVD but this film deserves better. It really needs s digital restoration and a special edition Blu Ray (I'd pay good money for that).

The History

Even more amazing than everything else is the fact that this is a true story. As I was watching it I will never forget the scene where Tucker visits Howard Hughes in person for help with a problem (caused by the Big Three auto makers and corrupt politicians). After seeing The Aviator it felt amazing to have a gap in my knowledge of American History filled in, and see how multiple independent business men had to fight and claw for justice in a corrupt system that favored the rich and powerful. Strong stuff.

Overall

I was told about this movie when I was in my early teens by a friend who introduced me to Kurosawa, John Ford, Orson Wells, and great film-making in general. I rented it on Netflix one day years later when it caught my eye. It's one of the most under-rated films of all time (in my humble opinion). If you love Americana, history, Jeff Bridges, the 80's, George Lucas, or even just good movies, you deserve to see this movie. If you're anything like me it will become one of your all-time favorite movies. It's fun, engaging, superbly made, and just plain enjoyable classic film-making at its best. HIGHLY recommended.

3687909,3,B001LMU1KU,"There are some historical inaccuracies in this film, but, overall, it has a compelling story and a nice late-40s period atmosphere. Like various other movies of this kind, it seems very nostalgic but perhaps a bit lacking in vitality, kind of like a Norman Rockwell painting.

The extra features are nice, too.

Why is this DVD out of print? A few years ago, Wal-Marts had bins full of this for about $5. Now you have to go searching on marketplace to find one for around $30 or more! Hopefully they will release a bigger, better extra-special edition soon.

3687910,5,B001LMU1KU,"I owned Tucker #19.  My father purchased the auto in 1959 for 1250.00.  He gave it to me right before the movie premier in 1988 due to his failing health, along with many other of his classic autos.  I was the sole female owner of a Tucker for many years.  It brought me much fame and attention. I drove it to many different events in No California and had a blast. My dad always got a kick out of seeing our videos of the places we drove the car.  She never let me down and  besides paint, and ulpolstery, tires and battery... she was just as she came out of the plant back in 1948. I let the San Diego Auto Museum show the car for the past 8 years.

#19 was in our family for over 50 years before I recently sold it for an offer I could not refuse, well over the million dollar mark.  My dad told me , kinda tongue in cheek, "" if anyone ever offers you a million dollars for that car ... take it!! and I got even more.. and it went to a good home because it was not sold at auction... I got to pick who I sold it to.....and there were many offers and interested buyers!!!.. I can  hear my dad snickering.

Some of the best memories I have is the time I spent with my dad during the filming of the movie in San Francisco and Oakland.  He was late showing up to the set so when they asked who was driving Tucker #19 I had to raise my hand.  Needless to say their first comment was ""you cant drive a Tucker ""your a woman"". And in 1948 that was almost true... but if they wanted  #19 in the movie that day... I was their only driver! The got 26 of the original 51 cars on the set for the movie, many with thier owners as drivers.  I did not want to tell anyone at that point I had NEVER driven the car yet? So off to make up I went... only to come out looking like ""mommie dearest"" with my red lipstick and hair done up.  I was so pleased to to see my dad arrive upon my return from make-up !  He was rushed off to be suited up in proper attire and so when ""drivers"" were called to the cars ... I just jumped in the passenger seat and no one told me to get out... it would be a waste of a lot of red lipstick and nice floppy hat. So I got to spend the day with my Dad drivng in his Tucker in a great movie.  So in the scene that the Tuckers are driving outside the courthouse.... you will see the rim of my hat...in the blue Tucker.  Thats me and my dad!!!

To review the movie... I think it was a very good and truthful account of the Tucker history.  Anyone who enjoyed the film should go to the Tucker
Automobile Club of America and join... you will learn so much about the car and thier hisory.  The movie did not get the attention it deserved... but Jeff was a great Preston Tucker and Francis Ford Coppola has owned a Tucker since the 70's and without his drive to make the movie with Lucus Films... our Tuckers would not be selling in the millions now! He made the movie entertaining.... even to people who were not ""car people"".  Great movie!!!",1327968000,,2950,3.972835314091681

3687912,5,B001LMU1KU,"After seeing an abominable new film Atlas Shrugged and wanting the foul stench to clear, I grabbed this out of my collection and screened it again. Most importantly it is a well crafted and engaging entertainment. It has a seasoned cast, is well written, is superbly directed, and has a perfectly pitched score that does not intrude. Set design and period locations and sets are wonderfully done, and it even features the wonderful car itself.
  This is a true story about a visionary who came up against the greed and profit machine in his quest to build a better automobile WHEN it SHOULD have become revolutionary. It proves that we have the inspiration within ourselves to see a better way. The system we're stuck with somehow is controlled by HACKS who are too cowardly to be revolutionary. Especially in the automotive world. The Rand devotees who made their lousy propaganda piece represent a half baked version of the Tuckers of the world. They want to be free of the controlling hacks and be unfettered in the pursuit of wealth and egotistical self fulfillment. They ARE the hacks now, as exemplified by the Republican political field in this country. The difference? The Tuckers of the world are the true entrepreneurs who want uncompromised visions fulfilled....But not only for themselves to prosper and be fulfilled and confident....they work to better the world, for all humans and the planet, and this is truly American and Progressive. It strengthens the nation and the individual citizen. Nikola Tesla and Steve Jobs are other such persons. Rarely does the proper respect go to the one who deserves the most recognition. A novel by a shriveled selfish and ultimately unimportant philosopher made into an unwatchable movie by hacks who don't get it?

3687914,5,B001LMU1KU,"Some have labeled this the ""David vs Goliath"" story, and they are right.  The ""Powers That Be"" saw that they were about to have their heads handed to them by a true dreamer and innovator, and so they used their clout and muscle to shut him up.
Not that you could blame them, looking at it from their point of view.
Another reviewer compared it to what Howard Hughes had to go through.  But if you think about him, all he had to do was create a solution for a problem that no one thought had a solution; somehow, get supplies to Europe, when Hitler's U-Boats were sinking every cargo ship that put out to sea.  And so he thought of a giant cargo plane, which could take off and land on water, which really wasn't a new concept; after all, there were already ships (huge ships) and seaplanes, so the idea was just one of stretching the two concepts somewhat.
But they threw a few monkey wrenches and sand into Howard Hughes' gears - namely, by telling him that he couldn't use any war-scarce materials, like steel, aluminum, or copper.
Try that one on for size!  And so he deemed to make it out of wood.  But not just any wood - he devised a very unique concept of using a waterproof super-glue to bond and coat thin layers of hardwood together, for strength and lightness of weight, and built his airplane.
But hardwood is just naturally very heavy anyway.  Most wood is, except balsa wood, but you could hardly build a huge cargo plane out of balsa wood.
The bottom line was that the war was long since over before Howard Hughes' plane ever flew. They didn't need it for the war effort anymore - but he had the money and the pride to finish it, and see it flown, even if only once, for just a few feet, and by himself.
He almost had to fly it at least once, just to prove to one and all that he hadn't been scamming the government out of the millions of dollars it had cost to build it, just to clear his own name and silence his critics.
But the money was the key.  Howard Hughes had enough money to do exactly whatever he wanted to do, whereas Mr. Tucker was a lone eagle, not only broke but in debt, and butting heads with the most deeply entrenched fortress of big money, power, and smug greed in the world.
The automobile industry was right up there with big oil and the railroads as the top industries of the day, back then.
And so, he was actually beaten before he started, and once they realized that he had something that could seriously challenge their whole world, he was pretty much dead meat.
Of course, as time went by, they appropriated his ideas, and why not?  Detroit has never been shy about stealing other people's ideas.  Just read the story, sometime, about the guy who invented the delayed windshield wiper, and how Detroit proceeded to put the screws to him, before he succeeded in getting a favorable judgement against them, to the tune of millions of dollars.
And so, sometimes the little guy does win, but much more often, the Goliaths of this world just grind the Davids into the dirt.",1318723200,,3012,4.364285714285714

3687946,5,B001LMU1KU,"Well done documentary/big production movie that exposes how far colossal corporations are willing to go to destroy competition and establish monopolies using the strong arm of the government to do their bidding under the guise of consumer protections. This movie is the perfect example of what Adam Smith (Author of: The Wealth Of Nations, 1776) warned his readers of: when companies become too big they inevitably dominate public policies for their own self interest while disregarding the cost to technological and productive progress.

The movie tells the story of determined dreamer and self made entrepreneur, Preston Tucker. After world war II Tucker conceptualized a futuristic car built for safety, class, and longevity. He envisioned a car with all-wheel disc brakes for better stopping power, fuel injection for more horse power and better fuel efficiency, as well as: seat belts, safety glass, and a roll bar for passenger protection. He wanted to revolutionize the auto industry and put the focus back squarely on the consumer while driving technology forward. He thought outside the box and tested tradition with novel ideas: engine in the rear, independent spring-less suspension, and a third headlight that follows the steering wheel. Almost all these innovations are common (if not standard) features found on vehicles today.

The film shows how Tucker basically made the Big Three look like fools by practically utilizing ordinary and present day technology, circa 1946, to build an extraordinary and superior automobile. In all actuality, all Preston did was efficiently use what was already commercially available and built a car that was as strong and as safe as any could and should be. All concepts that the Big Three either failed to notice or intentionally ignored.

Some people still question whether or not Mr. Tucker was really going to build the car. Well, if raising $17 million in capital to secure leasing the largest production facility ever created, rescuing the engine supplier from certain bankruptcy with his own finances, and hiring over 1900 employees to engineer, assemble, and deliver his product still leaves you wondering if this Preston Tucker was a crook bent on bamboozling the public for a quick buck, maybe you should re-evaluate your own motives in life. With a little research and mental capacity, anyone can figure out this guy had a dream he wanted to make a reality and his only intention was to profit off his idea while offering the consumer something of quality and benefit.

In conclusion I highly recommend this movie to any dreamer, businessman, historian, independent spirit, or free thinking individual. I can't imagine why anyone would regret watching this film. The acting, directing, production, and cinematography are top notch.",1271030400,,2792,5.2674157303370785

3687957,5,B001LMU1KU,"If there is still any question about how GM and Chrysler wound up on the rocks in 2008, the story of Preston Tucker and his dream car offers a very good answer.  It gives me great satisfaction, not only that history has given the Big Three its final kick in the pants but also that it seems to have spared a good number of these gorgeous cars.  Too bad the auto bosses who brought him down didn't live to see the end of the story.

Nobody I know has ever heard of this film, and that's too bad.  Preston Tucker is an important figure in the history of American entrepreneurship, and his story is certainly timely, even if this film were only marginally accurate.  The pedestrian title may turn off potential viewers who think it's one of those educational documentaries shown in high school classrooms.  Re-release it under a jazzier title, such as ""The Car of the Century"", and it might make a comeback.  It's relevant for anyone who drives or rides in a car.  Folks, this is why the Japanese automakers got the drop on us, and it serves us right!",1239840000,,1048,4.421875

3687959,5,B001LMU1KU,"Detroit native Francis Ford Coppola's bright, shiny and optimistic film, dedicated to his late son, Gio,who loved cars, and honoring a revolutionary auto maker, captures the spirit of postwar America.
 In the 20 years since I, and many others were introduced to Preston Thomas Tucker, so blithely and enthusiatically played by Jeff Bridges, he has become a public figure I've come to admire simply because the vindication of his judgement about the future of the auto industry, the technological advances that needed to be made, and the consequences of the suppression of individual innovativeness was long in coming. Basically, society had to learn the hard way that he was right.
 We are introduced to the innovative visionary at his home in 1945 Ypsilanti, Michigan where he builds cars in his barn, and astounds his loving family and maid Millie (Patti Austin) with a bevy of trained Dalmatians he purchased in exchange for his Packard.
 His wife, Vera (a pretty, assertive, and charismatic Joan Allen) shares his enthusiasm about his projects and lends herself beautifully to the task of aiding him in his business dealings, and his delightful children, including Junior (a devoted Christian Slater), lovely daughter Marilyn Lee (a lively and pert Nina Siemaszko), and younger sons, Noble and Johnny(Corin Nemec and Anders Johnson) round out the picture of a geniunely happy family, and  Abe Karatz( Oscar nominee, Martin Landau), Eddie Dean (Frederic Forrest), Jimmy Sakuyama(Mako), and auto designer Alex Tremulis (Elias Koteas) constitute Tucker's coterie of loyal employees.
 Influenced by Gallup polls expressing American's desire to have new cars after World War II ended, Tucker begins to design a newer model with modernized safety features, and when he advertises the prototype in a magazine, he meets resistance but he also attracts young Tremulis, a young engineering student about to be discharged from the Army, to seek employment with him, illustrating the eagerness of people to help bring about a good idea, and Tucker's willingness to give new talent a try.
 Regarding those who work with him, in hiring the Japanese Sakuyama, whose relatives were in a relocation camp, and the convicted felon Karatz, we see Tucker's willingness to trust people and give them a second chance irrespective of social or political boundaries.
 Tucker concocts a brilliant strategy to convince Washington D.C. bigwigs to finance his car by showing them graphic photos of auto accident victims who might have been spared if their cars had the safety features he advocated, while presiding over a luncheon: What they saw onscreen sent many to the men's room, but it was considered that these repulsed diners had some power to remedy the problem with which Tucker presented them.
 One Oscar Beasely(Roland Scrivner) a Special Assistant to the Administrator is impressed enough to meet with Tucker but expressed misgivings about Tucker's meeting with Michigan Senator Homer Ferguson (Jeff Bridge's illustrious father, Lloyd.--My more recent viewings of this film really made me focus on Jeff's strong physical resemblance to his Dad) a powerful but disreputable man with connections to the auto industry who maliciously schemes against Tucker.
 The pressure to get the car made within a brief time creates tension. But Frank(Marshall Bell) the Press Agent hired by Abe makes a promotional film, and on the day of the big presentation, the crew of engineers work up until the last minute. While subversive elements work behind the showroom curtain, the car is joyously received by the public.
 Tucker goes on a publicity tour as the family move to Chicago to be near the factory, and the acts of sabotage against the car begin to escalate. Mrs. Tucker endures a bit of condescention from Bennington as he reluctantly explains the inability to get materials for the car, and ultimately rejects all of Tucker's intended safety features as he tries to take over the company.
  Tucker and his oldest son fly West to meet Howard Hughes(Dean Stockwell). As they stand in the shadow of the Spruce Goose, Hughes explains that Ferguson is after him as well, but also informs Tucker about an aluminum plant with no government connections that will provide him with some material for his cars.
 A successful test run on the speed track leads to the resumption of manufacturing the car as it was originally designed.
 But Bennington ultimately shuts town the Tucker plant, and despite Tucker's ability to prove the roadworthiness of the cars, he is dragged into court on charges of fraud.
 At the film's climax Tucker speaks in his own defense, expounding a warning about sabotaging individual innovativeness that a 1988 audience knew all too well to be true.
  While Tucker is vindicated, and soon enough on to his next idea, perhaps the ultimate losers in the case were those who might have been saved had the auto industry adopted the use of Tucker's safety features sooner.
 However, one is never left with a sense of melancholy by this film. It is the story of one man's ultimate triumph over corporate-induced adversity,and while he may have intially succeeded only on a small scale, an inspiring tale of a true American hero.",1219017600,,5217,5.117647058823529
3687960,5,B001LMU1KU,"This movie is about the life of Preston Tucker, an entrepreneur, a dreamer and a visionary who wanted to manufacture a safe car for the American people. He introduced a design that was innovative, taking some features from aircrafts, with a style that was aerodynamic and with specifications that called for a rear engine, disc brakes and fuel injections.

To finance his dream, Tucker sells dealerships before the auto is even in production and the major car manufacturers don't want a new player making trouble, so they set out to make life difficult for him. Tucker is accused of fraud and attempting to sell stock on a venture that has yet to bear fruit. So, the Securities and Exchange Commission files suit against Tucker, and finally... the process puts an end to his venture.

The acting is superb; Jeff Bridges plays the optimist Tucker with great style. Martin Landau is excellent as the man who joins to make money in a business deal and ends up sharing the dreams of a visionary.  It was wonderful to see Joan Allen playing the role of the supportive wife, who puts up with much because she believes and shares her husband's dreams.

The clothing designs are beautiful and stylish. While brief, the performance of father and son, Lloyd and Jeff Bridges are a welcome bonus.

The movie is enjoyable and teaches how corporate greed and power hungry executives can eliminate competition and destroy the dreams of an entrepreneur, but in time... many of the design features Tucker wanted to offer in an automobile were adopted by the big auto makers and safety became not only a dream, but a mandate for manufacturers. Highly suggest seeing this film.",1217203200,,1659,4.827464788732394

I wanted to get a bit more of the story than I ever heard about. My mother had nothing good to say about Preston Tucker. While I am sure the movie whitewashed certain aspects of the story, I did come away with a different outlook. Mom gave to me the stock, and other priceless ( to me anyway)items associated with the dealership my father and his friend were going to start. All this was going on the summer before I was born. I have looked at it and had tears thinking how excited he must have been and how sad to see it all go for nothing.
The movie is wonderful and I laughed and cried right along with all of them. Preston Tucker was human and bigger than life and Bridges brings him to life in a forceful way. Was he always right? NO, was he a crook?
I don't think so..but time has a way of changing our preceptions and Tucker was way ahead of his time and would be amazed at the auto industry today. Bottom line.. good movie for anyone who loves cars and the nostalga for the time when men could and did dream big.",1212796800,,1177,4.0995670995671

It's done in a very period-esque style, indulging in many styles of the 1940s, from the big band sounds from that era, to the flaky movie style. It's a great movie, and doesn't institute any sex or violence. On top of all those qualities, you will inadvertently learn something.

Tucker created a car that would have brought the rest of the automotive industry to it's knees. The Torpedo was a durable good, free of planned obsolescence. This would have killed the industry because it was based on the ideals and morals of the original Model T. The story that unfolds is one of corruption, greed, and back-stabbing tactics that often surround big industry. All the while, the movie entertains and is a fund joy ride through automotive history.

Anyway, this was an interesting supposedly- true-life story of how Preston Tucker got a raw deal form the Big Three car-makers of the day, and by the government after he built a much better automobile in 1948. The film details how the big boys made sure Tucker's company never sold any of those cars.

Jeff Bridges does a solid job of portraying Tucker, an upbeat, positive-thinking inventor. It also was refreshing to see a nice, supportive family, too. I enjoyed all the main actors in this film: Bridges, Joan Alen, Martin Landau, Frederic Forest, Elias Koteas and Christian Slater

It's too bad that Coppola chose to beat the sterotypical ""small guy with a big heart gets ground down by the big guy"" horse. But good drama needs a protagonist and an antagonist, and that conspiratorical angle to be expected from Hollywood, USA. I learned a long time ago not to go to the movie theatre for a history lesson.

Fact is that Tucker tried too quickly to bring an underdeveloped product to market with an undercapitalized company. In only a few short years, much bigger companies with established product lines (Nash, Packard, Hudson, Kaiser, Studebaker, etc.) would all suffer the same fate his did.

3687970,5,B001LMU1KU,"The story of Preston Tucker is directed by Francis Ford Coppola, produced by Gerge Lucas and features an outstanding performance by Jeff Bridges as the inventor who dreamed too large in this wonderful American Dream.

After World War II, the automobile industry - in the guise of The Big Three - were poised to convert its manufacturing plants back to the soon-to-be burgeoning domestic market. Enter into the picture Preston Tucker, a successful inventor who had ideas to create an affordable, reliable and safe family automobile (yes, a revolutionary concept, even in the 1940s).

His ""Tucker 48"" auto included a rear-mounted, fuel-injected engine, disk brakes, seat belts and a padded dash, a front windshield that popped out during a severe crash, push-button controls and a third front headlight that turned while the driver was steering.

Seen as a threat to the marketing plans of the auto industry, Tucker's dream is destroyed in the hallowed halls of the federal government that winds it way through the senate chambers and stops at the desk of the president. Only 51 cars were produced.

Initially shot like the slick corporate promotional films of the 1950s to creatively present an overview of this buried history, Tucker: The Man and His Dream is a reminder how the power of influence & greed manipulates the marionette of business & government.",1166227200,,1358,5.076233183856503

I like his father, Lloyd Bridges(who isn't corny in this movie) as the nasty Senator who has a big hand in destroying Tucker's dream.  Joan Allen is good as is that kid who sounds like Jack Nicholson, Christian Slater.  The cars are nice looking too and slick like the film.  The film utilized real, honest to goodness Tucker automobiles.  The flick has a zippy, jazzy score by Joe Jackson, and that song, ""Hold That Tiger,"" which is corny but fun.  Don't get me wrong; it's a well made film by Francis Ford Coppola whose best creative days, unfortunately, came way too early in his career.  Hey, life can really suck sometimes, especially when the evil forces of big business and Washington, D.C. are against you and your upstart, innovative, fledgling automobile company; and you just happen to be a loud mouthed, arrogant, self-proclaimed genius whose aim is to single handedly revolutionize the automobile business.  If nothing else the film tells the story of an ambitious, enthusiastic guy who bit off more than he could chew by challenging some capitalist giants who gave him a capitalist bloody nose.  P.S. The best scene is that creepy one in the airplane hangar with that creepy music and that creepy portrayal of Howard Hughes by some actor whose name I can't recall.

3687973,4,B001LMU1KU,"The tragedy of Preston Tucker is that of a visionary who saw all the way back in the late 1940s what really needed to be done with the automobile--e.g., seat belts, fuel injection, disk brakes--and then did it and then got completely destroyed by the powers that be because of it. In this context, ""powers that be"" means not only the big 3 automakers (GM, Ford, and Chrysler at the time) but the Feds as well.

It's the same old story. Watch the  documentary ""The Corporation"" for an updated version of how US big business continues to destroy what's good and true and real, just like it did to Tucker.

The film is somewhat glossed over, but the production is absolutely smashing. It's a period piece and the period is evoked so well that the viewer is completely caught up in the events. Tucker envisioned a car so far ahead of its time that the stodgy, rod-up-their-butts, too stupid for their own good politicos and corporate blowhards couldn't handle it and subsequently used every means at their  disposal to bring Tucker down.

Jeff Bridges gives a wide-eyed interpretation of Preston Tucker, which is not a bad thing, and Joan Allen--as usual--turns in an excellent performance as his supportive wife. The supporting cast is fine, with Frederic Forrest, Mako, Elias Koteas, and Christian Slater as the standouts.

This is more than anything else a political film and it's no secret where the director's (Francis Ford Coppola) sympathies lie, as do mine. It's a real shame the Tucker could not be mass produced. But we do have this fine film and, as well, an interesting  article in the August 2006 issue of Life Extension magazine on Preston Tucker.

I have read numerous biographies and one of the interesting things about Tuckers story is that he followed most if not all of the keys to success that numerous great men had done before to become very successful. If you watch this movie and pay attention you will gain some insight about how to build a large company without any money.

The sad thing about this is that the government put the squash on Tucker. Interesting enough the Senator who went after Tucker was also one who was involved in going after Howard Hughes.

And being an undercapitalized entrepreneur in a capital intensive industry, he was rather easy prey for those who already had vast amounts of money, political connections, and a great many wartime favors to call in.

The viewer knows from the opening chase scene in the non-existent mountains of Ypsilanti, Michigan that certain facts are going to be sacrificed in favor of telling a certain kind of story.  The website tuckerclub dot org details the differences between this movie (which the club loves) and reality. There are some especially fine performances in this film.  Of course, Jeff Bridges is terrific as the never say die and flamboyant Tucker, and Joan Allen as his wife.  Martin Landau was rightly acclaimed for his terrific performance as Abe Karatz - an early Tucker supporter.

Of course, one of the big stars in the film is the car.  There are many of the surviving actual Tucker vehicles shown in this film (as well as some cosmetic props).  It is a terrific design for its time that owners still treasure today.

Preston Tucker can still be evaluated in a variety of ways.  When does the showman become a charlatan or when does an entrepreneur struggling for survival become a con man?  Different people judge these things a bit differently.

 The film is about how Preston Tucker went through struggles with corporations to create his dream car, The Tucker. Despite his lack of steel and other supplies Preston uses scrap cars to develop these incredible vehicles. But when the industry tries to take Preston's dreams and mold them for their own purposes Preston rebels against the industry.  His rebel acts end him up in court where he accused of not having any intent on even making the cars and stealing government money. Fortunately he was found not guilty.
 Now I personally did not care much for this film, and let me tell you why. Coppola was taking part in Lucas and Spielberg's clich feel good film era. Now I know this a true story, but I personally do not care much for the producer Lucas when it comes to cinema politics. Look at other films from this little fad that Steven and he started; Land Before Time (Producer), Willow (Producer), The Young Indiana Jones series (Producer). Now as a filmmaker, I feel these feel good adventures are just in there for the extra buck and a good credit towards him. Tucker was just another brick in the wall in this franchise that Lucas was racking up. He was better off with the Star Wars series.
 Coppola did a good job from the filming aspect, I like the God shots when your viewing the factory. I also like the fifties feel he pulled off quite smoothly, if the film quality wasn't as good I'd actually think this was made in the fifties. But via DVD makes the quality unbelievable.
 I like the father son acting rivalry between Jeff Bridges and Lloyd Bridges is wonderful. Both great actors that have great credentials; Jeff is in thriller classic Arlington Road and Lloyd is in comedy cult classic Airplane.
 I suggest maybe some of Coppola's earlier and better works. Like the classic and nominated as the greatest film of all time The Godfather. A Vietnam classic and another Top Fifty of all time film is Apocalypse Now.

If you love the style of the 1940's and the incurable optimism of post-War America, then this flik is for you.  Preston Tucker was true visionary who demonstrated the power and opportunities that each American has at their fingertips beginning with only a dream or two and Jeff Bridges captures the essence of this incredibly well.",1077753600,,411,4.466666666666667
3687985,5,B001LMU1KU,"I agree with the others about the film, and I just have to add this... Almost all DVDs these days force you to sit through minutes on end of animated logos and warnings of copyright laws and smallpox. This DVD, literally two seconds after you pop it in, you have the DVD menu!
Please, DVD engineers, I implore you, follow this example. We know you are very good and fancy, but we *really* don't want all your fancy animations slowing us down every time we start or stop something, or select a different option.

3687986,5,B001LMU1KU,"For some strange reason Tucker didn't do well at the boxoffice. I know it can't hold up to cinema masterpieces like ""Dude Where's My Car"" (grin), but I just watched this movie again and I really love the film. It oozes with style. The clothes, set dressing and props look great. There is a wide variety of early 50's clothes represented. Take a look at the jury. The womens clothes and hats are excellent. Even the extras look amazing. I seem to recall that Coppola had a few Life magazines and if you couldn't see it on those pages, it wasn't going to be in his movie.

Also the cinematography is top notch. Joe Jackson's sound track is very cool.(I think it was the only one he ever did.) Coppola's transitions are so cool and unusual that I have to keep rewinding to watch them a few times. They work perfect for this film.

If you haven't seen Tucker or you haven't seen it in a long time, I highly recommend you watch it.......tonight.",1058054400,,940,4.396551724137931
3687987,5,B001LMU1KU,"One of Jeff Bridges best performances! What a great script with many great lines to savor. The story is based on Preston Tucker's life and struggles to design his own car based upon his own great innovative ideas and that of his team. His ideas were so great that it caught the attention of the big 3 when he proved that his ideas had tremendous value. Then the big 3 got nervous and did everything in their power to squash him like a little bug, but nobody could ever squash Preston's dreams! This movie will inspire anyone whose ever had a dream to make it in America! A must for any collection.",1050192000,,597,4.339285714285714

3687989,5,B001LMU1KU,"Wonderful movie and its stature is bound to increase over time. The movie captures the optimism of the immediate post-war era through its rapid pace, colour and music. At times threatening to succumb to a sense of gloom and foreboding, the movie, like the man, Tucker, never does.  It moves from the story of a ""man and his dream"" to the larger issues of innovation and creativity against the protective mechanisms necessary within society. Anyone who works in computer technology today is bound to see parallels.",1014422400,,513,4.965116279069767
3687990,3,B001LMU1KU,"There are indeed a number of emotional high-notes in this film. After-all, who doesn't root for the underdog? It plays to me as a skewed historical dramatization of post-war exuburance. The film often wanders into the glee of capitalism and deluxeness that would define US Cold War posture. Despite its occasional power, this film moves in too many directions to keep the viewer focused. It doesn't seem to now what it wants to be. I recommend it as worth a look because it seems to capture something very well; but what that something is remains elusive and incomplete.",992649600,,570,4.826530612244898
3687991,4,B001LMU1KU,"Yes folks, America was then, and is now, as corrupt as we all think it is.  Preston Tucker, as portrayed by the film, courageously tries (and fails) to defy big business and big politics to follow his dream of building a gorgeous, brilliantly engineered, truly revolutionary car.  He's a modern Howard Roark, not bothered by what others think, attacking any obstacle put in his way, pursuing his own ideas at any cost.  There's a great deal of truth to the auto industry colluding with politicians to squash him rather than fairly compete with him.  I'm suspicious though, that the true motives of he and his business partner, a convicted bank defrauder (deftly played by Martin Landau) to sell stock and dealerships, was underplayed by the film to maintain Preston as hero.  The film manages to move along briskly throughout, with great imagery and a tightly-integrated, 40's-ish score, and doesn't sell out to any unnecessary romantic stories to get ladies into the theatre.  All in all a very good film, worthy of several viewings.",990921600,,1034,4.9479768786127165
3687992,4,B001LMU1KU,"Being a car enthusiast and having read about the Tucker automobile and its inventor, I saw this picture at the theater and rushed out to buy it when it became available to purchase.
""Tucker-The Man And His Dream"" is the story of auto maker/inventor/visionary Preston Tucker, who bucked incredible odds to see his dream of a revolutionary car come to life.  Jeff Bridges plays the title role with such energy and enthusiasm that you end up thinking this guy could conquer the world.  Joan Allen is her usual excellent self as Preston's devoted wife, and Martin Landau is brilliant in his Oscar-nominated role as Tucker's somewhat skeptical business partner.  Christian Slater, in one of his earliest screen appearances, plays Tucker's oldest son.  Although they are on screen together for only a brief period of time in the picture, it is wonderful to see Jeff Bridges with his father, the late great Lloyd Bridges.  The elder Bridges plays Homer Ferguson, a U.S. Senator from Michigan who instigated a probe and subsequent prosecution of Tucker by the Securities and Exchange Commission for allegedly defrauding investors (Tucker was eventually exonerated after his company folded due to the negative publicity).
All of the acting performances in this picture are superb, and the pacing is almost frenetic.  These factors, along with a rather ingenious use of transitions by Director Francis Ford Coppola (who coincidentally owns one of the few Tuckers left in existence), create a busy feeling that conveys to the audience that Tucker has got the world by the tail and is pulling hard...hold that tiger!  Combine all of this with an excellent soundtrack by Joe Jackson (unfortunately very hard to find these days), and you have what one reviewer accurately describes as one of the greatest movies that hardly anyone ever watched.  If you haven't seen ""Tucker-The Man And His Dream"", check it out...you won't be disappointed.",985651200,,1925,5.10828025477707
3687993,4,B001LMU1KU,TUCKER was a much under-rated film at the time of its release.  Jeff Bridges was excellent and the story was compelling.  The costuming was great too - quite stylish.,977270400,,166,4.689655172413793
3687994,5,B001LMU1KU,"Tucker is one of the most beautiful films that was made during the eighties. It has a boundless optimisim streaking through the entire film Some very interesting scene transitions also occur and many of them are extremely memorable. But beneath this surface Optimistic streak there is something darker and the film is almost Capraesque in the fact that it shows the depths that man can sink whilst linking it simultaneously with the heights that he can reach. Jeff Bridges is excellent in the title role and his renditions of Hold That Tiger almost seem to have tinge of madness as they get increasingly frenzied. Martin Landau is also fine in a role that he was Oscar nominated for. The film has a very interesting feel to it. You will either love it or hate it,I must put myself in the love it column, It gave me a buzz just to be near this sort of optimism and I wish that more films left me with this feeling. It gives you hope that even though the big boys will always try and eliminate the little man justice will nearly always be served. I hope that this film makes you feel the same way that I did.",976233600,,1106,4.4
3687995,5,B001LMU1KU,"One of his finest performances since ""Starman"" ... Here, Jeff gets to play a little bit of the good-natured kidder we've come to love ...  as Tucker, the eternal optimist and dreamer, we experience the reality that  all dreams are met with obstacles sometimes ...
The flashy style of the  director has the look and feel of a Life magazine or Saturday Evening Post  piece ... it's hype, sure, but it attempts to capture the entreprenurial  spirit of post-war America with the swing music and stylish clothing ...  Excellent performances by Bridges (both of them!), Martin Landau and even  Christian Slater plays with much more subtlety than usual.  Dean Stockwell  does a pretty good Howard Hughes.
Get this movie and be prepared to  simply sit back and enjoy it.  Before the Big Three had serious competition  from Germany and Japan they ruled with an iron fist.  The cars we drive  today are infinitely better because of competition.  Should any criticize  me for that statement I simply say these words: Pinto, Vega and Pacer.  BTW, my new Ford Explorer is an excellent, well-designed and engineered  vehicle.
Unfortunately the father-son team of Bridges didn't have nearly  as much material to work with in ""Blown Away"", their only other  movie pairing ... Lloyd Bridges plays the corrupt U.S. Senator so well that  you'd like to see a full Congressional investigation on him ... Excellent  sound track as well.",964915200,,1414,4.927659574468085
3687999,2,B001LMU1KU,"Coppola's autobiography of Preston Tucker is a truly colorful experince. I enjoyed the first 45 minutes to an hour of this film. Within that time we meet Preston Tucker(Jeff Bridges)his wife Vera(Joan Allen)and the rest of  his family. Also,and this is really a high point of the film,we are  introduced to Abe Karatz(Martin Landau). Landau's performance is simply  wonderful to watch. It's one of the many reason he remains one of my  favorite actors. But besides the acting in this movie there's more to catch  your eye. I personally love stories about the 40's. I just love the style  of it all. The way people dressed,the cars,and the music. So I thought that  the production designs by Dean Tavoularis and the costume designs by Milena  Canonero were exquisite. Vittorio Stararo camerawork is always masterfully  done. Plus if all of this were not enough,Coppola directing is very  good,not perfect,but good. But,it's after all of these outstanding moments  that the film shifts gears. We go from the wonderful start this film had,of  a man wanting to build the ""car of the future"",to a melodrama! I  really started to lose interest when the ""court room"" drama  started. It was all so,well...hollywood! It lost the ""innocence""  it has attained in the beginning. The wonderful warmth of a man wanting to  build his dream car,and turned into a boring movie. Look out for father  Lloyd Bridges in a brief cameo.",963532800,,1413,4.94468085106383

But  beware...this is not a documentary and there is much more to the actual  story than is shown in Coppola's fable.
