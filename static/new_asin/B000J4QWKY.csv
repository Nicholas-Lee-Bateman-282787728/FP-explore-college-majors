8149238,5,B000J4QWKY,"Adorable and funny...for infants to kindergarteners.  Lots of infantile cooing.  Really cute, with sweet music.  Same goes for the entire stump village series!",1419033600,,159,5.826086956521739

8149240,1,B000J4QWKY,"My toddlers and I made it through about 10 minutes of this movie before I turned it off in disgust. Between sticking heads in stinky toilets and putting boogers on artwork, not only could I not make sense of the story line but the content literally made me nauseous. There is no moral lesson to the stories, which seem to end haphazardly and in the middle of a thought.
Completely unsuitable for young children and for adults with any taste, for that matter.",1372550400,3,458,4.530120481927711
8149241,1,B000J4QWKY,I picked this DVD up from my library and I figured if my daughter liked it I would buy it for her.  She loves Hello Kitty and this was her first DVD watching Hello Kitty.  I wish I would never have showed it to her.  It was horrible.  Hello Kitty gets into a fight and her friends treat her like crap.  Hello Kitty cried and that is when my daughter cried.  My daughter cried for almost a half hour off an on.  I was so upset about it.  I would not recommend this for any child.  I have no idea what they were thinking about when they made this.,1272240000,3,545,3.926605504587156
8149242,5,B000J4QWKY,ADORABLE.  JUST WHAT I WANTED AND THE PRICE WAS FAIR.  SERVICE GREAT TOO.,1207094400,,73,4.538461538461538
8149243,2,B000J4QWKY,"We rented this from our local library for our three and five year olds.  Don't get me wrong, I love Hello Kitty, but really, this DVD is beyond strange.  Maybe it's just a cultural thing, but what the other reviewer said is true.  College kids with a keg might have some fun with it.  One character puts a black booger on another character's drawing, and when they're angry, Hello Kitty's friends line up at her front door and in unison, turn around, point their butts at Hello Kitty and let loose a display of flatulance reminiscent of something from Ren and Stimpy, prompting the narrator in a sing-song preschool teacher voice to announce ""Oh what an awful smell!""  At one point, the characters see a lizard on a tree and the camera cuts to two of the characters puking white foam from their mouths in a rabid display!  Another time, three ""friends"" break into Cinnamaroll's home and graffiti on the walls some pretty graphic stuff!  Truly, my older kids (9 and 11) thought this DVD was hilarious and in my opinion it's much more suited to Mad TV than preschool viewing!

This is truly very, very bizarre.  If you're looking for Hello Kitty, I would suggest the animated series.  It's much gentler and clean than this.
I did give it two stars because I still think the characters are cute, and the claymation type animation is entertaining, but not great for preschool viewing (we're trying to break our younger kids of talking about f*rts in public, etc -- certainly don't need them seeing Hello Kitty characters reinforcing bad behavior and manners without consequences).  Interesting, definintely entertaining, but be forewarned!",1199664000,13,1635,4.82437275985663
8149244,2,B000J4QWKY,"I might have enjoyed this DVD if I had been drunk while watching it.  The ""claymation"" type characters were cute, as can be expected from Sanrio, and Badtz Maru building his house was adorable.  Unfortunately I was taken aback by the downright rude and crude antics.  Booger jokes (including sticking one on a drawing), toilet jokes (including POV from the toilet), a flatulence line-up reminiscent of frat boys, thievery without apologies or remorse, and just general bad behavior with little repentance abound in the ridiculously short episodes.  The credits make up for the blink-and-miss-it runtime by rolling for what feels like ages.  Sure, the DVD has its place, but I wouldn't recommend it for kids.  College students on a Saturday night with leftover pizza and a partial case of beer, on the other hand, would probably find this DVD hilarious in a warped kind of way.",1175472000,9,876,4.965753424657534
8149245,5,B000J4QWKY,"I had high hopes for Hello Kitty and her magical ""Stump Village"". I was not dissapointed! This is the best dvd you will ever hope to purchase! It has it all: Cinnamoroll getting mad and baking bread, Hello Kitty getting furious, and Pom Pom Purin picking strawberries and being extremely hearty! THE BEST DVD OF ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1174694400,4,331,4.928571428571429
