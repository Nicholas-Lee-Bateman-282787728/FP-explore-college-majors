8758604,2,B01EGQ6A48,"Heinrich Himmler (David B. Stewart III, producer, directer, script writer, costume designer, beer boy) is in hell being interrogated by Erebus (John Martineau) with a rubber mask and voice enhancer. (I hate those fake demonic voice pretenders.) The film swaps back and forth to an event where Himmler had to kill a woman (Angelina Leigh) as directed by Hitler (Richard Adams) who has a tiny office with one portrait I am told is Frederic the Great, but damn if it doesn't look like a classic George Washington. They really didn't attempt to recreate his huge office. They did manage to recreate some period pieces and uniforms, bummer about that orange extension cord.

While Stewart looked like Himmler, the acting overall was bad. The film started out with the Germans not having an accent and the Russian having an accent. Okay, I get that, until that one German showed up with an accent. That made the film a bit bizarre with one guy talking with a German accent while the other Germans did not. The torture scenes looked fake. I didn't know the Germans said F...-sake. The day/night scene sequencing looked a bit out of whack too. Has some unintended camp/cult value. Ed Wood would be proud.

2 stars for the nudity. Slightly better than his stinker films ""Operation: Nazi Zombies"" and ""Maplewoods""
