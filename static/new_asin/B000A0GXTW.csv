REALLY THINK THAT I HAVE WASTED MY TIME AND MONEY FOR
THIS DVD MOVIE.

THE ACTING IS SOooo POOR!, AND THE STORY IS SOooo SLOW,
COMBINE THEM 2 THINGS ...  MAKES THIS STORY, AND MOVIE
LOOK LIKE A LOW BUDGET SHOW. THIS MOVIE WAS MADE BACK
DURING THE 1970'S SO THAT MIGHT BE IT THE REASON WHY THIS
MOVIE IS BORING.",1370822400,,366,4.069444444444445
