5080521,5,B007F8ZDEI,"We are so glad we bought this series.  it was being shown for awhile on a local channel and then they stopped  abruptly and replaced by an old show we had already seen a hundred times over the years.  We had not seen  ALF since it was on in the 80s so were disappointed and decided to go ahead and buy the entire series.  We had never seen the first couple of shows, and of course after so many years we had forgotten most of the details of all episodes.  While some might think it's too silly, we not only laugh but also find a kind of sweet spirituality and love of family that is engaging.  With a couple of exceptions we think shows today are either too violent or are just pure trash.  ALF is a refreshing change.  Nothing wrong with a silly alien coming to live at my house, just don't let him near the cat!",1517875200,,813,4.094936708860759

5080528,4,B007F8ZDEI,"I love this series but the episodes are out of order on the disks. This wasn't a huge issue for me, however, I also noticed that a couple episodes seem to repeat themselves between seasons 3 and 4 including Fever and Mind Games.  To my knowledge there are no episodes left out because of this, so this isn't a huge issue.",1515024000,,321,4.262295081967213

5080534,5,B007F8ZDEI,"Gordon Shumway was absolutely brilliant in his portrayal of Alf.  He was so good, he is forever typecast as the little, lovable alien with the big appetite.  (Cats beware!)  Alf's appearances in the opening menus are hilarious.  Unlike the Tanner family he lived with, Alf doesn't look like he's aged a day.  Melmac doesn't crack!  He's hawking merchandise on the Alf Shopping Network, or broadcasting from the satellite Funny Radio Network, (the opposite of Sirius radio).  As other reviewers have pointed out, the episodes are the syndicated versions, not the original broadcast versions.  Occasionally, when highlights of an episode are shown over the closing credits, I noticed clips from scenes that were not shown in the DVD's syndicated versions.

Season two episodes ""Alf's Special Christmas: Part 1"" and ""Alf's Special Christmas: Part 2"" are among the most poignant and saddest Christmas episodes of all time, especially for a sitcom.  For some unknown reason, season three episodes ""Mind Games"" and ""Fever"" reappeared among season four episodes, with no discernible differences.  For fans of family friendly fun, ""ALF: The Complete Series"" is an absolute must have.  The 1996 made-for-TV movie, ""Project: ALF,"" follows the further adventures of Alf after he parted company with the Tanner family, and ended up on a military base.  Alf was hilarious as always, although the movie lacked the light-hearted whimsy of the TV series.  In 2012, the Sony Pictures Animation studio purchased the rights to ALF.  A theatrical feature-film starring Alf has not been released to date.",1511481600,,1583,5.276
5080535,5,B007F8ZDEI,"Love these dvd's, very good quality",1509235200,,35,5.0
5080536,2,B007F8ZDEI,"I'm so tired of buying complete seasons and finding the episode order completely jumbled across the DVDs.  I know it sounds like a little thing, but when you like to watch episodes in sequential order, it gets frustrating swapping DVDs every episode to find the next one.  This complete set has all 4 seasons.  In fairness, Season 4 has all the episodes in sequential order, but the first 3 seasons (1-3) have the episodes jumbled up across all the 4 DVDs in a season, you almost can't watch two episodes in a row without swapping DVDs, and there is nothing in the packaging to show where they are--I had to load them up and compare to IMDB to create my own list.  I know it sounds petty, but seems like more and more this is happening, and I'm guessing it's simply to utilize maximum space on the DVDs to reduce the number of DVDs used.

Other than that, the video and sound quality seem really good, and it includes the original unaired pilot episode, and 2 bonus Alf cartoon episodes.  So I gave it 2 stars instead of 1.",1508716800,4,1023,4.386243386243386

5080542,5,B007F8ZDEI,I enjoyed this show when I was young but never was able to see all of the episodes (being that was way before DVR technology). It is interesting to see the difference between the quality of production and actors from the 80's compared to current shows. These dvd's play great and the shows have no technical issues. In case you do not know anything about this show. Alf is an alien whose spaceship crashes into a families garage. The family befriend him and take him into their home so the government won't get a hold of him and do experiments on him. Each episode portrays a comical story of every one trying to learn each others way of life.,1505001600,,643,4.411764705882353

5080558,1,B007F8ZDEI,"This complete series of ALF is the same cut up versions that was released from Lions Gate back in the 2000s.  This complete series set of ALF being released by Lions Gate is a whole waste of time because they are the cut up episodes.  I can't believe Lions Gate would even waste their time releasing this because the sales are not going to do well.  Lions Gate had years to get the original uncut episodes cleaned up and re-stored in their original format but no they had to release the same exact thing they have already released in the 2000s.  It's a shame Lions Gate didn't take the time to get us the original uncut episodes that all of us ALF fans have been waiting for all these years!  Lions Gate should have listened to all the complaints and concerns from their consumers  about the previous releases of ALF being released, but it seems like Lions Gate ignored it's consumers and paid no attention!  I hope someday Lions Gate will get the original uncut episodes released on DVD or let some other studio buy the rights from Lions Gate.  Video Service Corp released 3 episodes of ALF on DVD back in 2002 and they were the original uncut episodes.  Maybe Lions Gate should sell the rights to Video Service Corp or Shout! Factory who can buy the rights and release ALF on DVD with the original uncut episodes, unless Lions Gate decides to do so.",1491264000,5,1351,4.459349593495935

5080565,3,B007F8ZDEI,"This is a review of the 2016 version of the Alf: The Complete Series Box Set as released by Alliance Video.  First off Im going to talk mostly about the package here, not about the relative merit of Alf as a comedy.  I loved Alf when I was younger. Taped them all - in fact, I still have my original VHS recordings from the 80s (that comes into play later here).  So Im not downplaying the episodes themselves, which are still funny.  But nobody else who has reviewed this has dealt with the packaging, so I wanted to say something about that.

This is a repackage of the existing DVD releases that came out around 2005 from Lions Gate. This is borne out in the fact that this is a totally barebones release.  The content on the discs matches what was on the 2005 release, so there is *NOTHING NEW HERE* and *NO REASON TO UPGRADE* if you had the release from 10-11 years ago.  Having said that the menus are some of the better ones out there.  Theres original material in the menus, and you can click a question mark icon for each episode to get a short recording from Alf describing that particular episode. So there is merit ON the discs, but they're the same versions.

In addition, there is no booklet of any kind on the inside.  When you open the package from Amazon there are two cases that hold the 16 discs total that make up the whole package. At least they're not just stacked on top of each other, they all have their own individual slot, so thats good.  But nothing on here indicating what episode is on what disc.  Thats annoying because if theres a particular episode you want to get at, you have to guess if you didn't bother to catalogue the episodes yourself.

One other thing about the repackaging of the discs, and this is again not the fault of this release, but a fault of the 2005 release.  **THESE ARE NOT THE FULL ORIGINAL EPISODES AS AIRED IN THE 80S ON NBC - THESE ARE SYNDICATED EDITS**.  Yeah, that annoyed the heck out of me a decade ago, and I was *HOPING* that this release would correct that problem, but it didnt.  They just repeated the error.  At the time, Lionsgate said that the condition of the original episode masters were in a state that it would cost them more to repair them and get them ready for DVD release then they would conceivably make as profit releasing them, so they went with the syndicated versions, which were in better shape.  I can understand it from the making money standpoint. In this decade, Alf on DVD isn't going to make the kind of money that say a Doctor Who or Game of Thrones release would.  I get that.  Still, I wanted the original cuts, so Im glad I still have my 30 year old VHS tapes (which still work). I know this well, because theres a handful of episodes Ive memorized, and cut lines are very noticeable.  Like a sequence with Alf, Willie, & Kate talking about flavors of donut from the Episode La Cucharacha. That whole sequence is in the original version I have on VHS, but not the DVD version in this package.  I just wish these original versions would be released on DVD in the United States.  It is even more galling when I mention that the original uncut versions *WERE* released on DVD elsewhere in the world, just not the US.  GAHHHHHHH!

Anyway, thats a summary of the packaging and the content.  As I said, I did like they took the trouble a decade ago to create original content for the menus.  You don't usually see that in a DVD, they're just menus after all.  But theres new Alf material in the menus on all the discs of this set, so thats a nice touch.

I included a few pictures of the packaging and DVDs - will attach them to this review.  Im giving this three stars out of five due to the usage of the syndicated edits, and not the originally broadcast versions.  If they had the original versions, I would have given this a 5 out of 5.  As a real old school Alf fan, the edited episodes are annoying.

To help out those who might buy this package, I decided to take the trouble to type in all the episodes as they are on the various DVDs.  I did notice that when typing them in, the episode titles that are on the DVD don't always match whats on Wikipedia as being the Episode titles. In addition, the Season 3 discs appear to have episodes out of order.  I cant explain that, so make sure to check Wikipedia if you want to get the same running order as originally aired.  Its possible they're in production order on the DVDs, but thats pure guesswork.  I don't know that for sure.

Alf Episodes as they appear on this DVD set are below.  I encourage you to go to Wikipedia and look up the listing of Alf episodes as they were originally broadcast.

Yes, you DO have to watch each episode, well choose which episode you want to watch next that is, but that is hardly worthy of losing stars, or receiving complaints. It takes no work on your part to click a button and choose the next episode, lol.",1480550400,5,585,4.095652173913043
