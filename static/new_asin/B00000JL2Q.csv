8216207,5,B00000JL2Q,This is very informative about the trucking industry from the begining to now and in between. It is very interesting and well done and has footage of some old and rare footage of trucks. As a driver of more than 22 years I can see how tuff the drivers had it when this industry was just starting out.,1280707200,,300,4.189655172413793
8216208,5,B00000JL2Q,This is the best and most informitive documentary I have ever seen on the history of trucking. I have been in the trucking industry for over 41 years now and found this video very interesting and well done. I only wish this was offered on DVD.If it ever becomes avalable on DVD I would buy at least 5 to 10 copies right away and gift them to friends.,1238803200,,350,4.161764705882353
