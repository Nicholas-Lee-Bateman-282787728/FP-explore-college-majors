5048899,5,B0071PT9JU,"I love this story. I used to watch it every July 4 on the Disney Channel. It is well made. It is good feeling when my kids want this, a  non violent, non sarcastic and no innuendo animation film over what they show on TV today. Good wholesome program. I wish they would show it again on the Disney channel or any channel.",1378339200,,321,4.095238095238095

5048904,5,B0071PT9JU,"I first saw Ben and Me when I was a child and I have loved it ever since. Sterling Holloway, the Disney stalwart (Cheshire Cat, Winnie the Pooh) does a great job of voicing Amos the mouse and we see his close relationship with Ben Franklin. It is Amos who is really behind all of Franklin's successes from the Franklin stove to bi-focals to the Pennsylvania Gazette; all attributed to Amos but he generously let Franklin take all the credit. As great today as it was so many years ago, this is a must for your DVD collection. Enjoy!",1363737600,,532,4.383838383838384

5048906,5,B0071PT9JU,"This wonderful Disney classic hearkens back to a time when Disney movies were clean, wholesome, without gas and other bodily function jokes, and when movie reviewers used words like ""hearken"".

""Ben & Me"" is a fairly accurate cartoonification of the 1939 novel of the same name by Robert Lawson. Disney did a nice job summarizing in short form this whimsical novel. The only unfortunate part of the story is that it makes Benjamin Franklin, one of the greatest minds, inventors, statesmen and patriots, out to be a buffoon at best, and a pompous idiot at worst. This is the novel's fault, not Disney's- in fact, Disney toned this down in making the film. But the novel's Amos claims responsibility for almost everything Ben Franklin ever did- another item Disney (making this during a particularly patriotic era) wisely edited.

Kids will enjoy it, even if they can't determine why Winnie the Pooh is doing the voice of Amos Mouse. (Sterling Holloway, the beloved original voice of Pooh, also voiced ""Roquefort Mouse"" in ""The Aristocats""...somewhat boxing himself into a bit of a mousy corner until ""Jungle Book"", where he voiced Kaa the snake.)",1346716800,13,1145,4.989528795811518
5048907,5,B0071PT9JU,This was at one time a very popular and famous story and film. Apparently the cheapskates at Disney don't give a damn unless it has some princess character it can shill to little girls. This is a wonderful classic.,1334448000,2,214,4.512820512820513

5048928,4,B0071PT9JU,"I do love this Disney cartoon, I watch it every summer when it gets closer to Independents Day. The only problem is that it skips parts. It skipped the part where Amios tells the story about his family right before he tells his side of the story. It doesn't bother me that it skips that part, but I already had that exact same version on another DVD, and I could've saved money. Why do they even skip parts on old shows? Maybe the younger generation won't notice, but the older generation, like myself might! Oh well.",1435017600,9,517,4.395833333333333

8508556,1,B0071PT9JU,"I give this one star not because of the cartoon. The cartoon is spectacular, but this DVD release is incomplete. An important part of Amoss (the mouse) history is cut out. I cant imagine why? It helps the character development and understanding of his desire to have a life of significance. I own the original VHS copy and it shows a run time of 25 minutes, not 21 minutes. I bought this is 2012 and Ive hoped for years that a new copy would come out that would be complete, but I guess its not going to happen :(",1516406400,,513,4.191919191919192

8508560,5,B0071PT9JU,One of those timeless Disney Movies that never gets old.,1487289600,,56,4.7
8508561,4,B0071PT9JU,"In 1745 colonial America, Amos Mouse leaves home to try and find work, but gets stuck in frozen weather with nothing to eat and very little money to spend. He takes shelter in a printing shop owned by soon-to-be American Revolutionary Benjamin Franklin, who has only twenty-four hours to pay his rent at the threat of being evicted. Amos earns Bens trust by helping him invent bifocal glasses, the Franklin Stove, and the Pennsylvania Gazette. Their friendship becomes strained when Bens electrical experiments endanger Amoss wellbeing, which is especially damning considering war between the colonies and England is on the horizon. Can they mend fences long enough to bring peace to what will eventually become the United States of America?

While Disney movies tend to stretch the truth when it comes to history, its still fascinating to see Ben Franklins various achievements throughout the cartoon. The scene where he and Amos are printing copies of the Pennsylvania Gazette is interesting just to see how printing presses worked in those days with individual letter blocks, a tube of ink, and a giant stamp. In Pennsylvania weather, its also refreshing to see just how effective the Franklin Stove is at bringing heat to the shop (after they run the smoke up the chimney, of course). Ive never worn glasses before, but in 1745 when technology was in its infancy, its good to know that Ben has his bifocal glasses for getting work done and going outside. These inventions were enough to pay Bens bills and strengthen the bond between himself and Amos. I like seeing those kinds of stories.

I know about this movie because I watched it all the time as a small child with my mother. Because I was that little, I found certain aspects of the movie funny that may have been overlooked by others. The first comedic moment happened when Ben Franklin sneezed on Amos and broke his reading glasses. The way he sounded always tickled my brain. The same thing is true when Ben ran into a street post and knocked his three-cornered hat over: the sound of his scream had me rolling on the floor. Amos had a strange moment of comedy as well. When hes helping Ben print copies of the Gazette, he ends up with a giant Y on his shirt after being stamped onto the letter blocks. The music they played near the end of that scene with the dramatic violins helped get the giggles out of me too. You know youve had a happy childhood when you can laugh at silly things like that and never question them until you're all grown up.

Then there was a moment of the movie that scared me as a kid. It was the scene where Ben was flying his kite in stormy weather and Amos gets electrocuted by lightning. The screams of Ben! coming from the little mousy pie were disturbing to me, especially since Amos was voiced by the same guy who did Winnie the Pooh twenty-four years later. Imagine if that had been innocent little Pooh fixated to the kite with a metal tip near the top. It would break the sweetie bears little heart. Amos, on the other hand, was madder than hell and rightfully so. As an adult, I question Bens judgment as to why he needed Amos on the kite in the first place. Zapping the mouse in the tail with a printing press is one thing, but this is a lightning storm were talking about. He could have killed the little guy, though he didn't because this is a G-rated movie. What if Amos/Pooh didn't have the G-rating to protect him? Then what?

While this movie didn't bring me good grades in high school history classes, it was a great deal of entertainment for me as a little guy growing up in the late 80s and early 90s. Small children aren't expected to take history seriously, not until they're old enough to go to school. They don't care if a mouse helped Ben Franklin through times of war. Theyre just happy to see the little guy and hear his Winnie the Pooh voice. Thank you, Ben and Me, for being my little piece of childhood heaven. I still appreciate it as an adult, especially since Im not particularly age-conscious. The fact that I even looked this movie up on You Tube shows that I don't care about age expectations. How does a passing grade sound?",1484352000,,4152,4.561662198391421
8508562,5,B0071PT9JU,"Ben and Me is based on the Robert Lawson book of the same title.  This Disney cartoon portrays key events in the life of Benjamin Franklin from the perspective of Amos Mouse who is a friend of Ben Franklin.  We learn about Franklin's printing business, how he invented the Franklin stove, the invention of bifocals, experiments with electricity, flying a kite during an electrical storm, and the writing of the Declaration of Independence.  I use this video as a supplement to my lessons when I teach the Constitution; Franklin signed both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.  At twenty-five minutes in length this video is ideal for classroom use and is an effective yet entertaining teaching tool.",1484352000,,717,5.0508474576271185
8508563,3,B0071PT9JU,Only giving this 3 stars bc they cut out the beginning part of original and the price! And for what reason? It certainly was not to save space on the DVD. This thing is only 20 minutes long and cost $15 the price is ridiculous. They should've put some short cartoons or bonus features on it or something!  Lovely cartoon but too short for price I paid.,1483574400,,352,4.253731343283582
