899427,4,6304561776,"A surprisingly moving treatment from the Turner Network movie factory.  The Hunchback features commanding performances from Harris, Patinkin, and Hayek along with superb sets and literate direction.  Neither sentimental overkill nor dry exercise, the film is content to tell the allegorical tale of the ""partly made""  Quasimodo with sincerity and assurance.  If not strictly faithful to the original book, it makes up for it with the engaging performances and the production values.  I will note that it can br grim going in places; the viewer is not spared the brutality inherent in the story, but this adds to the film's poignancy.  If you missed this on its original TV broadcast, treat yourself to this video (and how about a DVD release?).",995932800,6,744,5.107438016528926
899428,1,6304561776,"The giants of Turner Home Video have scored yet another victory.  This time they defeated Victor Hugo and proved that the American entertainment industry is still capable of keeping the world literature at bay.  The  producers had no thought for themselves.  Without any hunches and avoiding  to look back, they elevated the Notre Dame de Paris to the level of an  amusement park.  Instead of choosing the easy way of creating their own  story and setting it in Columbus, OH or Dallas, TX, they joined Quasimodo  in his fight for free press.  Now we are finally free of prejudice to  respect the author and the originality of his creation.  Productions like  this one will liberate the future generations from classics once and  forever!",959040000,3,737,4.8861788617886175
899429,1,6304561776,"AVOID THIS PICTURE LIKE THE PLAGUE!
God, I thought I'd seen the worst Quasimodo movie ever, but this one makes the Disney version Cannes material! In fact, it's nothing but a ripoff of the former (the bellringer looks identical), only cornier: there's a superfluous politically-correct subplot about the printing press and the dangerous freedom it entrails that will make yours revolt!
Granted: no Hunchback movie has ever been faithful to the novel (not one!), but the liberties this flop takes with the story are beyond poor Victor Hugo's worst nightmares: Quasimodo is actually a learned intellectual who discusses St. Augustine with his master; the illiterate people of Paris know how to read manifestos all of a sudden; the king of France himself pardons Esmeralda; Dom Frollo murders an added ""prime minister"" and the Church opposes ...the Renaissance! [....]
And talk about production values! Props, sets and costumes look so fake they seem to have been rented from one of those 'Medieval Knights' dinner shows from Las Vegas! As for the actors, Mandy Patinkin does an average Quasimodo and Richard Harris mistakes Frollo for Nosferatu, BUT ...Salma Hayek steals whatever is left from this mess as the bewitching gipsy girl. She outbeautes Maureen O'Hara, Gina Lollobrigida, Lesley-Ann Down, Demi Moore (live or animated) and every other Esmeralda that may stand in her way. Salmita, that single star is for you!",955756800,6,1419,5.200873362445415
899430,5,6304561776,"Mandy Patinkin, is one of the most under rated actors in America today.  He was brillinat as the Hunchback, bringing new insight into the tortured life of Quasimodo.",954720000,5,165,4.892857142857143
899431,2,6304561776,"One of Richard Harris' greatest performances. It takes a great actor to overcome shoddy writing and Harris (Patinkin too) pulls it off where the very best would fail. Harris takes a two dimensional villain and infuses  him with such pity, longing, and fear of the world that you end up feeling  very sorry for him. Patinkin is heartbreaking as well. This  ""film"" is an obvious attempt to co-opt the success of the Disney  Film with similar costumes, staging and plot outlining. There is a lot in  Hugo's novel that needs interpretation for the screen and that Disney and  TNT were this close in their creative process is a silly thing to believe.  The production value, the major capital most likely used to secure the  three top name actors, leaves a lot to be desired. The population of France  (in the crowd scenes) seems to be about twenty people, the king of France  lives in a little hut right next to Notre Dame and a very rediculous book  burning theme is pushed down our throats (We cannot keep the knowledge from  the people!!!). Give me a break. Still, a real lesson in powerful and  ""smart"" acting is provided by Harris and Patinkin. Get  ""Hunchback"" for that reason. Otherwise don't waste your time.",939340800,,1212,4.682464454976303
7874268,5,6304561776,I watched this movie many times and think it is a good adaption of the book but like all the movies they leave out her death and the death of the hunchback,1525737600,,155,3.875
7874269,3,6304561776,This movie is well done and the acting is decent but it does not compare with the earlier version in 1939 with Charles Laughton as the hunchback. It is worth a view though for those who love this story and medieval movies.,1463184000,,222,4.309523809523809

7874272,5,6304561776,"Having seen the Disney, Lon Chaney & Charles Laughton versions of Victor Hugo's classic novel ""Notre Dame De Paris,"" I was more than eager to give this version a shot. Mandy Patinkin (aka Inigo Montoya in ""The Princess Bride"" & Jason Gideon on CBS' ""Criminal Minds"") literally grips your soul with his impassioned portrayal of Quasimodo. Salma Hayek is perfectly cast as Esmeralda, initially repulsed by Quasimodo, but then growing to love him (sound familiar?). Richard Harris gives a dimension to Frollo that up to now was only in the novel: pain and indecision over his lust for Esmeralda. You actually feel sympathy for him even when he's perpetrating evil. Edward Atterton (a soldier in ""The Man In The Iron Mask"") is also well cast as Pierre Gringoire. This version is excellent, and stands alongside the Disney & Lon Chaney versions as true cinematic achievements, though I must give credit to the Charles Laughton version for inspiring a key scene or two in the Disney version. See this ""Hunchback.""",1267747200,,1007,4.964497041420119
7874273,3,6304561776,"The famous Victor Hugo story has been filmed so many times since the silent film era (like the 1923 version ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" starring Lon Chaney as Quasimodo, deformed bell ringer of Notre Dame Cathedral). Now you are looking at the 1997 made-for-TV version which I find fairly entertaining even though you can hardly call it a faithful adaptation. But anyway, I didn't like the original story's ending very much.

Mandy Patinkin is Quasimodo with special make-up. Salma Hayek is Esmeralda (with several dancing scenes that are downplayed for TV) while Richard Harris is Frollo, archdeacon obsessed with his love, or lust, for Esmeralda. Three major actors are all very good, especially late Richard Harris showing a completely different turn from that of benign Professor Dumbledore, but you may regret the lack of character development in them.

Some characters of the book are missing to make room for the story of the major ones and some incidents are drastically changed. A murder is committed, but in an entirely differently way, making the murderer's motive much less convincing. But they managed to put in a goat.

The Emmy-nominated production designs are decent, but the streets of Paris sometimes look more like some village in Eastern Europe (where it was actually shot). But maybe that was intentional. Perhaps you may prefer Charles Laughton's Quasimodo, but this version has its moments.",1199404800,,1415,5.143478260869565
7874274,1,6304561776,"Not THE worst- but one of the worst- it ranks up there with Dami Moore's The Scarlet Letter, and The Queen of the Damned (which gets top prize for not just ruining ONE but TWO decent books-

While Disney did take a few liberties with their take on this classic novel, they still managed to keep many of the cruicial points, as well as the overall feeling - sure it had a happy ending- every, except of course Frollo, lives to laugh and play in the sequal-

In this version, Quasimodo almost plays a supporting character to Frollo, who instead of consuming his time trying to root out and destroy the Gypsies and Outcasts, is on a quest to stop the printing press- and to save me some writing- he feels it's evil- yadda yadda yadda- from there it just gets weirder and weirder- and you start to wish you had just rented ANY other version-

Instead of this I reccommend either the Disney Version, the Lon Chaney Version, or the most recent stage version - Notre Dame de Paris (which is about as close to the original story as you can get without reading the story)- or just read the book-

The only thing that makes this version even watchable is Salma Hayek's Esmeralda- who is, by far, the most beautiful Esmeralda to date (and from all the versions I've seen- the only one who is actually from Spain)- her dancing, her acting, her costumes- are completely amazing- I put my vote in for a total re-edit of this movie leaving just Esmaeralda

If you are a fan of the story, or a fan of Literature at all- avoid this one at all costs- actually- unless you're a Salma Heayek fan - this isn't even worth a rent-",1128211200,4,1607,4.361204013377926
7874275,4,6304561776,"Yes, this version of The Hunchback takes liberties with the original story, but put that aside and you find incredibly deep and moving performances.  Die-hard Hunchback fans will gripe about the changes to the story line, but those who just like a good film will love it.  I think I'll watch it again tonight.",1104105600,3,309,4.703703703703703

7874277,2,6304561776,"My goodness was this a bad version of The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Everything about this production reeks. Not even sexy Salma Hayek could save this classic piece of trash. What is with the persute of printing presses, and since when has the hunchback printed books? I had hoped with all its short commings it might include the original ending, but, alas, Esmerelda lived. The only verson that has the original ending where Esmerelda dies is the 1957 version. THAT version is better than this one. This version also deletes the character of Pheobus and now Esmerelda is accused of killing the king's minister or whatever. Take my advice and try and find the 1982 version ( it is very difficult to locate sometimes.) with Anthony Hopkins and Leslie Anne Down. It is far better.",1062892800,5,776,4.7555555555555555
