5089094,4,B007IJKQG4,"One of our youth film critics reviewed this and here is what she had to say:

Gone is the new PG-13 thriller/horror starring Amanda Seyfried. It's about a woman named Jill who was snatched out of her bed by a serial killer and had to fight for survival and escape. A few years later Jill's sister goes missing and she is convinced it is the same man who took her years before. Jill will stop at nothing to save her sister from a gruesome fate and catch the serial killer behind multiple kidnappings.

I really enjoyed this film and although it was technically in the thriller/horror genre I didn't find it all that frightening. I thought the cinematography and soundtrack was good in the sense that it enhanced the suspense of the movie. I don't think I have a favorite scene because the whole film was very captivating and clever.

My favorite character is Jill played by Amanda Seyfried because she is very good at out smarting the ones around her and she is very clever. Plus she really handles the situation that she is in with a level head and she never gives up even though everyone around her doubts her and tells her she is crazy. Overall I give Gone 4 out of 5 stars and recommend this film for ages 13 and up due to suspense, intense situations and mild violence.

5089095,2,B007IJKQG4,"In ""Gone,"" Amanda Seyfried stars as Jill Parrish, a kidnapping survivor who was forcefully taken from her home and imprisoned in a deep hole in a heavily wooded area, where she found the remains of other victims.  She managed to escape, but a year later, her sister Molly (Emily Wickersham) goes missing and Jill is convinced that the same man had come back looking for her.  She goes to the police but her suspicions are tough to prove, since there was never any evidence found concerning her own kidnapping.

Over the last year, Jill has been seeing a psychotherapist to help her overcome lingering fears. Still, she keeps files of local missing persons and dogs the police whenever she believes she has leads.  The police now think of her as a nuisance and a paranoid nut case.

The plot of this film is shamelessly cribbed from any number of Hitchcock classics about a victim who cannot go to the authorities and must enter into dangerous situations alone to discover the identity of the bad guy(s).  The dramatic point in the Hitchcock pictures was placing an average Joe or Jill in extraordinary situations.  Director Heitor Dahlia does the same with her Jill, but makes her more avenging warrior than frightened girl.  She packs a .38, concocts on-the-spot lies to gather information, and has detective skills and instincts that would make Sherlock Holmes seem an amateur.  We never buy her as a real character, merely Hollywood's mannequin substitute for one.

Ms. Seyfried is an actress (and I use the term lightly) with one expression -- wide-eyed, deer-in-the-headlights terror.  This ceases to be effective since, after a couple of scenes, she comes off more as a saucer-eyed cartoon than a woman determined to find her missing sister.  We should be rooting for her, but she becomes more and more irritating as the film progresses.

This routine thriller lacks a key ingredient -- suspense.  The narrative is essentially a police procedural, minus the police.  We see Jill travel throughout Portland, Oregon, attempting to piece together clues that might lead her to Molly.  Assorted unsavory or suspicious characters are introduced, any one of whom might be the serial killer, but when the tension should increase and suspense should be at its peak, the movie coasts along into familiar, cliched territory.

Another significant flaw is the identity of the serial killer.  In ""Silence of the Lambs,"" the film it aspires to, Buffalo Bill was a real character -- vile and horrifying, but a solid character nonetheless.  In ""Gone,"" we learn little about the killer, see him even less, and so aren't horrified by him at all.  Call him the generic serial killer.  Though it would be unsettling, it might be interesting to find out why this guy goes to such efforts to kidnap and imprison young women.

""Gone"" has a couple of good supporting performances, by Jennifer Carpenter as a friend of Jill and Daniel Sunjata as a detective who investigated Jill's original claims of being abducted.  They are talented actors who deserve much better material.

A thriller customarily builds to a climax -- a peak of dramatic action.  The ""big"" sequence in ""Gone"" is a terrible disappointment and makes the viewer wonder why he invested time and money to see the movie.  This undistinguished PG-13 rated picture is a collection of obvious red herrings, contrived situations, unlikely encounters, and overly zealous vigilantism.",1333324800,8,3423,4.99294532627866
5089096,4,B007IJKQG4,"Amanda Seyfried is waitress Jill who has nightmares of a past abduction. She lives with her sister Molly (Emily Wickersham) who is the smart sane sensible one of the two. When Molly goes missing, Jill goes into a frenzy thinking she too has been abducted by the same guy, even though the MO appears to be  different.

Amanda is a bit flighty when she goes to the police with her 1 hour missing sister story. Because there was no evidence from her last abduction...if fact it was contrary to her story, the police show reluctance to help Amanda, telling her to come back Monday if her sister is still missing. She also has a history of ""Crying Wolf."" Amanda is convinced it is the same guy who abducted her, and her sister is going to be killed tonight if she doesn't find her and the killer. Officer McKay seems willing to help, but his interest in Amanda comes across as less than professional and is suspect to anyone who watches these films. Molly's boyfriend (Sebastian Stan) has his doubts too and appears less than concerned as suspects mount. To add to that list of suspects there is the creepy neighbor as well as the creepy locksmiths.

Armed with information from the creepy neighbor and a .38 Amanda won't sleep until the abductor is found.

The ending was fine, but it needed a final Hitchcock twist. Seyfried looked stellar in a sea of prop actors.

5089097,3,B007IJKQG4,"I went to see this movie thinking it was going to be fantastic.  However, after sitting through it I was disappointed with the ending.

There are lots of great scenes and twists but for some reason the ending was a let down.  I think after seeing what the protagonist goes through without anyone believing her, the ending would be bigger.  Instead it seems to be downplayed by the stoyline.

I didn't hate the movie but was let down by the plot.

I don't want to give any spoilers but how can people talk on cell phones only to discover there's no service in that area?  It didn't make sense but somehow the audience was supposed to sense impending danger. The guy's voice was scary enough to imply danger.  I guess we were supposed to understand that she was all alone and no one could hear her if she screams, except the man she was talking to on the phone.

The acting, however, is great and very believable.  Amanda Seyfield is always great and very believable.  She's the same here.

But for me, if the plot is lacking, then the whole movie can be lacking as well.",1332806400,7,1069,4.3979591836734695

5089120,5,B007IJKQG4,"Not since I saw the Halle Berry movie The Call have I been so shocked by a movie's ending! Pleasantly shocked, but shocked nonetheless! This is a movie about a woman who endured a horrible kidnapping and was able to dupe the kidnapper and barely escape with her life. Years later after her parents were killed in an accident Jill has a nervous breakdown and was committed to a psychiatric ward.

SPOILER ALERT!!  SPOILER ALERT!!

After she was released from the psychiatric ward, Jill goes to live with her kid sister, Molly. But upon returning home from work after the graveyard shifts he notices Molly gone. Her clothes and books are untouched and Jill realizes that her sister has been taken. Going to the police is no help as they do not believe her story. Left to her own devices, she tracks down leads and gets her clues through fast talk, deception, brute force and using her feminine wiles on many an unsuspecting male. She's intelligent, too. When attempting to procure information she's able to change her stories to match whichever individual she is conversing with (Her Bike Was Stolen, Someone Clipped Her Car, Her Grandfather Has Dementia And is Missing) and this allows her pleas to be believed and people willingly assist her. The scene with the fellow who lends her his truck is hilarious! Yet it's believable because as males we are all susceptible to a beautiful woman's feminine wiles--and cash! I liked the comic relief: ""What does it mean if you don't return it?"" he asks. ""It means I'm dead,"" she says, driving away.

Jill eventually has to ditch the truck but goes to her girlfriend for assistance in borrowing her car. She also gets the telephone number of the killer. She calls him and he lures her to his bolt hole deep in the Oregon Forest. There she finds a campsite with evidence of the man's dastardly doings. Seeing a lantern burning up ahead, Jill is lured to the edge of a pit and then thrown down. The killer climbs down to skewer Jill with the leg bone she once used to stab him but is outwitted by Jill as she shoots him twice and then climbs out of the pit, this time pulling up the rope ladder. Demanding to know what happened to her sister, Jill shoots him again, this time through the leg and threatens to shoot him a fourth time. The man relents and tells Jill what she wants to know. Begging for his life, Jill returns to the lip of the pit and pours kerosene down upon the helpless man, still pleading for his life. ""You said you'd let me live!"" he weeps. ""I lied!"" Jill says with unequivocal triumph. Wow!

I was so shocked when I saw what she did! Burning the poor guy alive was so cruel! Granted, if anyone deserved this fate it would be him. Yet to see a man begging for his life that had been shot thrice with a .38 special it makes me shudder to think of his agony as he died in flames.

The cover of the DVD says: ""Nothing can stop her."" They are right. Jill is tenacious, clever, agile, conniving and adaptable to her situation(s). This was necessary for her to get to the bottom of what happened to her sister. Yet, ironically she was only playing into the psychopath's hands as he sought only to recapture Jill.

The mistakes the man made. First of all, after duping and dumping her into the pit, he should have assumed she would have had some sort of weapon with her--either a knife or a gun. This leads me to the second mistake the fellow made. He should never have gone back down into the pit--at least not immediately. The darkness made it all but impossible to tell if she was armed and by the time he reached to bottom of the pit it was he who was trapped and at Jill's mercy! Having that gun is what saved Jill's life. Every woman in America should carry a .38 for protection. It would all but guarantee their safety from being abducted by strangers or even raped. I loved this movie and I'm proud to be the 118th person to give this a Five Star review and the 315th person overall to review this film. Buy it and you won't be disappointed.

One last thing. I didn't even recognize one of my favorite actors from back in the day. Michael Pare, who played Lieutenant Bozeman! He's come a long way from Houston Knights. But I enjoyed his supporting role and loved all of the characters in the film.

Sadly I found it really hard to sympathise with her character because the threat appears to be in her head for much of the film.

I kind of wish that I was able to scream INTO the film that she needs to be more adamant about what happened to her, and WHY ISN'T ANYONE LISTENING TO HER!?!??!??

The other characters are props for her world, which alters as she sees the necessity. The subject matter is of course immediate and pertinent to life in society, a society that can be dangerous unexpectedly. I can identify with her precautions for self-defense, and mistrust in placing one's safety in the faith of others. The story had holes in it but Amanda's stolid insistence in pushing through despite the failings of others was played with grim determination.",1429056000,,604,4.8173076923076925

Amanda Seyfried is Jill, a woman who claims to have been abducted and almost killed by her captor when she manages to escape.  Six months later her sister disappears under similar circumstances from Jill's house, and Jill has every reason to believe it is the same killer!  The police didn't believe her the first time because they could never find the killer's camp site and deep hole he dug to keep his victims in.  She is on her own looking for her sister before her time is up.  The casting is excellent, as is the writing and directing.  I highly recommend this movie.  ...but not forgotten.",1380931200,,765,4.573529411764706

5089261,5,B007IJKQG4,"I found this movie refreshing;  instead of slashing its way into moments of suspense, it dealt with it in a subtle and effective manner.  The filming locations in Oregon have a hint of melancholy beauty that in itself adds to the drama. Amanda S. maintains an aura of luminous innocence throughout the movie, despite the fact she carries a gun and is a competent and courageous amateur detective. How refreshing to see a heroine who is assertive and deductive in the face of extreme pressure and stress, and not waiting for a man to rescue her.",1377388800,,544,4.65625

5089267,5,B007IJKQG4,"Don't mess with this chick! Jill was abducted and had a harrowing experience. She managed to escape but people don't really believe her story. When her sister disappears, she goes straight to the police, but they act nonchalant and want to wait longer before pursuing it as a missing person case. Jill knows she doesn't have time to wait to save her sister, so she finds clues and tracks down the perpetrator on her own. This young actress, Amanda Seyfried, gives an impressive dramatic performance that is convincing and without hysterical overkill, and the suspenseful plot moves along with the right amount of adrenaline to hold your attention. I liked watching her face while she talks to the perp on the phone. The way her eyes fill with tears but don't spill over reveals both her emotional pain and steel resolve.",1372982400,,820,4.822695035460993

5089269,3,B007IJKQG4,"Like a 2005 Jodie Foster thriller ""Flightplan,"" Amanda Seyfried's ""Gone"" starts out well, with a heroine desperately looking for a missing person. Her struggle to find out the truth is made doubly difficult because no one around her believes what she says. This is an intriguing, Hitchcock-like premise, and Brazilian director Heitor Dhalia manages to keep the ball rolling until the final act where the story, so far pretty good, suddenly fizzles.

Amanda Seyfried plays Jill Parrish, a Portland girl who was abducted and imprisoned in a hole somewhere in Forest Park. She escapes, but the terrible event still haunts her. Well, that's what she says. The local police, however, do not believe that. They could not locate the hole in the forest. Besides that, Jill was once in a psychiatric institution.

It is only natural that the police officer Sgt. Powers (Daniel Sunjata) is skeptical when Jill claims her college student sister Molly (Emily Wickersham) is kidnapped. She is not at home. She has missed the test. The police think she will eventually come back. Jill does not think so and starts her own investigation alone.

Despite the countless plot holes, pointless car chase and some incredible incompetence on the part of the police, ""Gone"" remains entertaining, except the last chapter where our heroine is finally given a chance to do what she wants to do, she does it in the blandest and most forgettable way imaginable. Well, that's it? Is that all?

I liked ""Gone"" for what it is, a B-thriller with Amanda Seyfried. This is a great way to kill time on a rainy day afternoon.",1372032000,,1589,4.895910780669145
5089270,4,B007IJKQG4,"Ah, it's one of those just-because-you're-paranoid-doesn't-mean-that-someone's-not-out-to-get-you flicks.  And it's bad enough when you've got a serial killer chasing you, but it's really bad when you have embarrassed and under qualified cops chasing you as well.  Now, how're you going to outsmart them both?

Well, easy.  All you've got to do is have a dumb serial killer and some dumb cops.  And we've got some of both going on here; after all, we're in Portland.  But you also need a smart chick, at least a street smart one.  And we've got one of those as well.

And that smart chick would be Amanda Seyfried, who really showed off her assets in ""Chloe"" -- a film that didn't necessarily give her career a boost, something that can't be said for the male audience of that thriller, however -- gives a kick-tail-and-take-names performance here as a gal who has to fight off a serial killer.  Twice.  You'd think that her killer wannabe would have thunk twice about taking her on twice.  But remember, he wasn't all that sharp.  Or perhaps he just wanted to see her again.  Can't say I blame him.

It's interesting that they filmed this in Portland.  After all, there haven't been that many serial killers from there, have there?  Let's see. . . .  1.  I-5 Killer, aka Randall Woodfield.  2.  Happy Face Killer, aka Keith Hunter Jesperson.  3.  Green River Killer, aka Gary Ridgway (to be fair, I think that he just dumped one body in that area to confuse the police.)  Looks like there have been quite a few more than that, peeking around the web.  So I guess that Portland is as good a place as any to set this film.  And it's rainy to boot, so the people there must be depressed.

And the setup involves Ms. Seyfried being at least depressed, perhaps even crazy.  But we know better.  And I wouldn't say that you'd be crazy to not put this on your Wish List, but I will recommend it is kind of fun.  Fun, if you like revenge flicks, I suppose.  And watching Ms. Seyfried show off her many assets.",1372032000,,2002,4.542134831460674
5089271,5,B007IJKQG4,This movie was pretty good. I thought that Amanda Seyfried did a pretty good job in this movie. It was a little intense until you got to the ending. I thought they did a good job on making you think if she was crazy or not. All in all I enjoyed this film. If you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do,1371513600,,311,3.8
5089272,5,B007IJKQG4,"Why some movies make it in the box office and others don't is a conundrum. GONE is a beautifully conceived and acted and directed suspense thriller that has many levels of meaning. Much of the success of the film is due to the brilliant writing of Allison Burnett, one of our finest writers of novels (I've read them all) - the brilliant  `Christopher', `The House Beautiful', `Death by Sunshine',  and `Undiscovered Gyrl' - and screenplays for `Fame', `Untraceable', `Feast of Love', 'Resurrecting the Champ' and others. His name deserves to be in the top credits for this stunning little thriller. It appears that one of his novels, `Undiscovered Gyrl' is in production as a film. He is a major talent.

During the opening credits we meet Jill Conway (Amanda Seyfried) walking through a dense forest, map in hand, searching for something. Jill is a young Portland woman who lives with her sister, recovering alcoholic Molly (Emily Wickersham). The year before, Jill was kidnapped by a serial killer who abandoned her in a hole in the forest, where she found human remains. When her abductor descended into the hole to kill her, Jill was able to stab him with a bone and climb his rope and return to civilization. However, the police didn't find the hole and discovered that Jill had been committed to a psychiatric institution for several years after her parents' death. Believing that the abduction only happened in Jill's head, they closed the case. Yet one day, after returning home from work at a local diner, where she and her friend Sharon Ames(Jennifer Carpenter) are generously tipped by a regular customer about to move out of town, Jill finds Molly gone and is unable to reach her boyfriend, Billy (Sebastian Stan). Knowing that Molly wouldn't leave the house with Jill absent and that she had an important test the following day, Jill becomes convinced that the man who took her has now captured Molly and heads to the police station to ask for help, but Sargent Powers (Daniel Sunjata) and Detective Erica Lonsdale (Katherine Moennig) dismiss her claims and promise to look into the case after a few days: Jill claims it will be too late by then. Before she leaves, newcomer Detective Peter Hood (Wes Bentley) pulls her aside and tells her he believes her, giving Jill his card in case she needs help.

Jill is convinced that the man who abducted her has also abducted Molly, believing he was finally getting Jill to kill her. Despite the lack of support and help from the police who insist she is insane, Jill sets out on a thorough investigation and life threatening chase (both from the police who feels she is dangerous when they discover Jill is carrying a gun) and from people she meets along the way. How the story ends is brilliant writing, but to reveal more would ruin the suspense. Director Heitor Dhalia paces his excellent cast well and there are many conflicting clues in addition to Jill's uncanny ability to create false scenarios to gain information. This is a first class film on every level, especially making the point that the police too often view victims as hysterical and dismiss their interest in unsolved cases. Highly Recommended.

As the movie progresses, you actually feel her frustration and terror as she tries to get help to rescue her sister.  I will stop here before I spoil the plot.

While it's nothing really special, GONE is a tense, compelling crime thriller with its share of surprises and a lot of good chase scenes. Hard to predict--it probably won't end exactly as you think it will. It does have its share of unlikelihoods --e.g., the police won't even take a ""Missing Person"" report?--and general dumbnesses, but how many films in this genre do not have a few of those? Good script, however, the acting (sometimes over-acting) and directions are rather flat, obviously rehearsed, and TVland-perfect.

Worth 94 minutes if you like this sort of thing.",1366675200,,587,5.041237113402062

5089287,5,B007IJKQG4,"Seyfried's acting is brilliant in this film. Yes the film is mostly dark and gloomy but it is supposed to be, it's a psychological thriller. Like most films there are many improbable acts that occur but they actually fit a desperate persons MO.

 I didn't fully understand why the ""new' detective (forgot his name)was highlighted when he made some odd remarks but I guess it was to throw the viewers off. Here is a film that knows how to stir up true suspense and fear. I love the imaginative lies Seyfried's character told strangers while acting as a quasi detective trying to find her sister. They were elaborately realistic. This is fun movie making that was shot with much expertise. So much so that I decided to buy the blu ray after renting it, which says a lot. The only disappointment was that the disc contained no extras. I'm hoping for a re-release special edition that gets into the nitty- gritty of the film (unlikely though).

I was left confused as to Detective Hood, though - I mean, why would the producers (or whomever) draw attention to his character, only to have him fade away?  If they wanted us to think that he was the kidnapper, it worked, because I did.  But when I found out that he had nothing to do with anything, he became a whole lot of irrelevant. It was just weird and without closure.

Speaking of no closure, I felt sure the kidnapper was hiding in the back of her friend's SUV, seeing that they both lost signal at the same time and producers made it a point for him to tell her there's no signal out here and for her in a baffled state to say ""but we've been talking...""

I am a survivor of violence and torture as a child. I am attracted to thrillers and horror films as a means to work through the experiences that I have endured.

""Gone"" gave me exactly what I needed. It featured a Cassandra figure, a woman horribly abused who had the forethought to fight her abuser, but who no one believed.

When she lit the abuser up in flames in the pit in the woods I yelled for joy.

That's what these sick predators need.

They burned our lives.

This one had no handsome young man who gets roped in to help her and provide a love interest.  Jill (Amanda Seyfried) is alone in her quest to find her kidnapped sister, and any help she does receive is refreshingly believable.  My one major complaint is that I felt the police don't believe her a little too much, with the exception of the Lieutenant (Michael Pare) who walks the line nicely in asking enough questions to initially be taking her seriously, and only dismisses her when he finds the evidence lacking (he should get more roles than just the B-movie shlock he usually does).  The rest of the cops seem to have been pulled from central casting file for ignorant close minded block heads.  I liked the progression of Jill's investigation, liked her intelligence in knowing when not to sound crazy, and her manic determination - very well written and acted.

5089365,3,B007IJKQG4,"This film is primarily a format for leftists to showcase contemporary thought about a supposed moral and, in this case, intellectual and physical superiority of women over men. Amanda Seyfried's (playing Jill) beauty is supposed to enthrall us (and undermine our sound judgment - the film opens with outline of her naked body in shower).

In this film Jill is ostensibly (it is not explained) living upon the life insurance benefit provided through the death or her parents, since she lives in a nice home in upscale Portland, Oregon but works red-eye shift as waitress at a coffee shop/restaurant. As introduced to us, her accomplishments include easily beating up a fit-and-trim man in her self-defense class, and outsmarting every single person she encounters throughout this film (usually by lying cleverly), including a bevy of mostly male Portand police detectives. Not explained is why, if she is so smart, she works, while not enjoying it, graveyard shift night after night as a waitress.

Men who get a rise out of watching Amanda Seyfried's beauty bounce through this flick, and women who prefer to believe most men are creeps, and who fantasize their own beauty and imagined overwhelming intelligence will slay all life's challenges will enjoy this film. Everyone else, grounded in some measure of reality, will consider time spent watching this production a thorough waste of time.

I gave the film three stars because the serial killer suspense is not the worst I've seen (but it is far from high grade).",1348099200,,1517,5.06
5089366,5,B007IJKQG4,This movie came to me in very good condition. It was a great movie and a clean movie that all could watch. I am sure things like this does happen.,1347235200,2,146,3.9
5089367,4,B007IJKQG4,"I like Amanda Seyfried. I think she is very talented and if she picks her works more carefully than she has so far, she will eventually take her place next to the great talented women of our time. That's where the HOWEVER comes in. So far, I have not been impressed by the movies she chooses. Mama Mia? Really? She can't sing, and she had one of the biggest singing parts. She should have passed on that one. Don't get me started about Dear John. I would have to say the only other work she has chosen that is even close to her calibre of talent is Letters to Juliette.

I did not expect to like Gone as much as I did. Although I gave it a four, I'd say it's more like a 3 and a half. I really liked the story. The excitement begins almost as soon as the movie opens. She plays a waitress named Jill, who has a history with the police that isn't good. She had evidently been abducted some time ago and escaped. When she went to the police, they could find no evidence that anything bad had happened to her. On top of that, she was an emotional mess, so bad, she has to be put into a psychiatric hospital and has been on medication ever since. Because of her experience, she understandably does not trust the police. When she comes home from her night shift at the diner she works at and discovers her sister is not in bed as she should be, she immediately does the right thing, heading for the police station to let them know and try to get a file started and to start looking for her. To say more would probably spoil it for the rest of you, so let me just say that the police (for some reason that I could not quite understand) not only do not believe her sister was abducted, but they do everything they can to thwart Jill's efforts to try to find her sister. This part made little sense to me, whether or not Jill is a raving lunatic, if she comes in saying her sister has been abducted, it seems to me it is the duty of those who serve and protect us to at least make a limited pass at it. But that's not what happens, sending Jill off to find clues about her sister's disappearance on her own.

I really did enjoy this movie, despite having to suspend a few major issues. The story isn't new - it's been done quite a few times and honestly, there wasn't much new in this one. However, Amanda Seyfried, IMHO, did one of the best jobs I've seen from her in her career. The suspense continued to grow, the story, despite the unbelievable reaction of the police, was riveting. The one other problem with this movie was that it was too short. Seriously, it was way too short a one hour and 35 minutes. On the bright side, it was over before I knew it.

Despite the fact that this story has been done a bit too often, that the police were uninterested to the point of it being unbelievable, and that occasionally, the story was a bit choppy, I have to say that I really liked it. It's not in my top 10 favorite movies by any means. But for just simple, popcorn eating, soda drinking pleasure, it was within my realm of likability. These days where movies aren't considered worthy if they don't have some deep, edgy meaning, or some political pokes at common folks, or some family epiphanies happening, etc., it was nice to just sit back and watch a simple, old fashioned ""who-done-it."" Having a decent strong cast involved was a plus, even if they weren't used as much as they should have been.

5089387,3,B007IJKQG4,"""Gone"" is one of those classic flicks that you had no idea existed but rent because you see a few familiar names in the cast.  It was actually Wes Bentley's name that caught my eye, though he has an awkward and brief appearance here.  The film is held completely on the shoulders of Amanda Seyfried and I think she nails it.  She commands your attention here -- frazzled, distraught, and then cold-bloodedly bold and almost dangerously zealous to find her sister.  I remember Seyfried from back in her ""Veronica Mars"" days and I was impressed with her.  A lot of credit has to go to director Heitor Dhalia.  This movie DRIPS with atmosphere.  The man knows how to make the little hairs on the back of your neck stand up.  Every scene has a creepy, voyeuristic, something-bad-is-going-to-happen-at-any-moment feel.
The movie boils down to Seyfried's desperate attempt to find her sister, and the actress makes it all worth watching, even when it's preposterous.  I won't give it away, but there's a really cool thing that happens in the end, where the film quiets down and the frenzy stops.  There's something so scary and odd about the scenes, but I only wish they would have lasted longer.  They are soon dashed for a much more conventional -- and quite frankly disappointing -- finale.
My biggest issue with the film is some of the basic weirdness when dealing with the police.  The cops seem solely focused on Amanda's character but ignore the obvious: her sister is clearly missing and a mountain of evidence points to something sinister having happened to her.
But it's actually a pretty good little popcorn flick thanks to its lead actress and its director, who elevate the material above its script.",1342224000,,1706,4.804794520547945

The story follows Jill (Amanda Seyfried), who was kidnapped in the past but police could never find any evidence of the crime or kidnapper.  She was involuntarily committed in a psych ward after the police don't believe her.  Now, Jill's sister is missing and she believes that the kidnapper has returned.  Unfortunately for her, the police again don't believe her.  Jill frantically searches for her sister without police help and follows the clues find the kidnapper before it's too late.

Here's the good news: the story keeps you guessing and you'll never guess how it ends.

5089397,1,B007IJKQG4,"Amanda Seyfried has been an actress on the rise for years, going back to 2004's ""Mean Girls"" and the 2008 film musical rendition of ""Mamma Mia"", but for me one of her breakthrough rolls was 2009's ""Jennifer's Body"", a horror/comedy mix where she easily outshined Megan Fox. Since then Amanda has done a mixture of good and bad films (with Red Riding Hood falling into the later category), but she's always done well in most films despite the lean material provided.

In ""Gone"" she plays Jill, a girl with a history mental problems living in Oregon looking for clues to the whereabouts of her younger sister who she believes was kidnapped by a killer. There's not much more to the story than that, though there are some flashbacks she keeps having to being pinned down and subdued in her bed by the killer. Once she comes back to her house from her night job and finds the sister gone she goes searching for her sister and the same killer she says attacked her.

There's the expected cliches like most of the police not believing her when she says this guy is back, the red herring suspects like the sister's boyfriend (Sebastian Stan ""Captain America""), a new cop to the force (Wes Bentley ""American Beauty"" & ""The Hunger Games"") or perhaps even Jill herself (insert not so shocking gasp here). Also the pure insanity that goes along with Jill's desperate searching for her sister before its too late.

The main problem with ""Gone"" is the lack of punch and scares provided throughout the movie, it plays out like a really bad TV cop drama. Its quite predictable but at least the acting while basic is good thanks mainly to Seyfried and Bentley. The ending is also a bit of a joke as a lot of loose ends got tied up in a fairly silly manner. * out of 4 stars.",1339891200,11,1758,4.504702194357367

A year later and returning home after work, she finds her sister is missing from bed and she knew that she was supposed to be there.  She goes to the police who simply blow her off as a crackpot who is still wasting their time.  Jill realizes that she has less than a day to find and save her sister or she will become the next victim of the serial killer....

My wife and I just watched this DVD and we enjoyed it.  We found if to be a dramatic and suspenseful movie that is well written and acted out. It is a story of a young woman who cannot get the immediate support she needs from the police and as a result she is forced to do her own detective work and find the serial killer in order to save her sister. She has a short deadline to find her sister and the police would rather arrest her than believe that her sister is missing.  The story line is good and Amanda did a reasonable job portraying the protagonist in the story.

Sure the storyline has flaws, but every movie has them.  We liked the action and the aggressiveness of Jill to save her sister Molly from a horrible death.  You may not rate it a five star movie but we think you will like it!",1339891200,,1721,4.129129129129129
5089399,5,B007IJKQG4,Acting was awesome; one of Amanda Seyfried's best performances yet. Keeps your attention all the way through the movie. I reccomend this to people just getting into thrillers and horror.,1339632000,4,186,5.233333333333333
5089400,2,B007IJKQG4,"I give this movie 2.5 stars.. not deserving of a 3, but a little better than a 2..

This movie had lot's of potential.  The plot line was interesting.. BUT.. it definitely fell short.  It seems to me like the script writers got bored towards the end.  There was no heart put into it.  The ending was atrocious.  It was simply that.. it just ended..  No struggle, nothing.  Just shot the bad guy and it was over.  Come on, this a movie, we would have liked to see some kind of a struggle at least.  All the unrealistic escapes and alludes made by Jill could have been forgiven if the ending was right, but it just wasn't.

The movie kept me entertained.. up until the end, when I knew it was going to be a terrible ending.  Boring.  Made watching the whole movie seem like a waste of time.

If there is one thing I can't stand, it is a movie with a horrible, just end like that ending.  And this movie was one of those.

For entertainment, I would watch it.. but if your expecting a good movie, I would skip it..",1339632000,5,1011,4.160621761658031
5089401,4,B007IJKQG4,"This one's almost a throwback. Remember the 90's when you couldn't walk into a movie theater without tripping over a serial killer thriller? They always had the damaged hero who was the only one still looking for the killer after everyone else gave up. Well, this one's kind of like that. Except, this time instead of one stubborn cop still looking for the bogeyman, it's an escaped victim. Amanda Seyfried devours the scenery as the one who got away, and now thinks the killer's back and has nabbed her sister. Except, nobody believed her back then and they still don't believe her now. Is she crazy, or is she right, and which possibility is the more terrifying? There's an interesting dichotomy about Seyfried, with a face like a fairy princess but a presence like the big bad wolf. She really sells it as a girl who has had enough and is ready to fight. The script piles on one ridiculous unlikelihood after another, right up to the end, but her performance makes this worth watching.",1339372800,2,988,4.651428571428571

5089403,5,B007IJKQG4,"This movie was surprisingly great!  I really haven't had great expectations for Amanda Seyfried being that the first thing I saw her in was ""Mean Girls"" with Lindsay Lohan and I wasn't very impressed with her work in that, but she seems to have improved since then.

***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***

So I have always liked movies about crime, and lately Hollywood has given us a lot of abduction movies to help with my interests.  The main character acted the way I would expect someone who had been abducted to act.  She had half a dozen dead-bolts on her front door and she owned a gun.  (Even though technically it's illegal for her to own a gun since she spent time in a mental institution, but hey, if you had been abducted and were scared for your life, I'm sure you'd get a gun too!).

The main thing about this movie that I didn't like, was something that I also really liked about the movie.  It's that the main character, this girl who is in her early 20's who is a waitress, did more police work to find this killer than the actual police did.  Seriously, she gets out, asks people if they saw anything, gets a description of the vehicle that was seen at the scene of the crime, googles it, finds where the van came from and does an actual investigation.  She basically does the police's job for them and kills the killer in the end.

5089404,4,B007IJKQG4,"How can you not like this movie?  The whole time I was watching I couldn't guess what was going to happen next!  I couldn't guess who the killer was either!

The ending was a little bit of a let down but the whole movie I was on the edge of my seat.  This is definitely worth watching and a lot better than other movies coming out these days.  Ignore the critic's bad reviews, they're just butthurt because they couldn't predict what was going to happen.",1339200000,,454,4.294117647058823
5089405,3,B007IJKQG4,"I thought this movie was very well done except for one teeny, tiny, little critical flaw:  the ending.  It's just so hard to believe that it really ended the way it did that it was a total let down for me.  It absolutely could have had a more plausible ending.

Not bad for $1 through RedBox though.",1339027200,5,299,4.192982456140351
5089406,4,B007IJKQG4,"Nothing about the overall plotline of this movie is particularly innovative, but this film will probably hold your interest, and even keep you on the edge of your seat anyway. The main character's determination to find her sister, in the face of all official indifference and doubt, will have you rooting for her.

She ad libs any number of clever cover stories to extract information from people along the way, rivaling the glibness of Rockford in James Garner's hit TV detective series. So there is some catchy novelty here, even if it's not necessarily in the film's concept or resolution.

Amanda Seyfried does a great acting job, projecting intelligence and fortitude. Her character provides a good role model. She's a strong, capable young woman who is so much more than just a pretty face.",1339027200,3,796,4.932835820895522
5089407,2,B007IJKQG4,"GONE is a by the numbers thriller that offers an interesting premise but unfortunately left me disappointed.
No matter how cute Amanda Seyfried may be, I've never felt she had the maturity to carry a movie (MAMMA MIA, IN TIME, LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD), and of course she has most of the screen time in GONE.  The real problem is the script makes her do reckless and often stupid things that are pretty unbelievable.  A good supporting cast is basically wasted in roles that serve only as people for Seyfried to ""bounce off of.""  This includes Daniel Sunjata, DEXTER's Jennifer Carpenter, Wes Bentley, Nick Searcy, Joel David Moore and Michael Pare.
The film also has no twist ending, concluding rather flat.
A more imaginative script may have distinguished the movie but GONE is easily forgotten.",1339027200,2,795,4.874074074074074
5089408,1,B007IJKQG4,"Crime thrillers need some degree of believability. So how the police seem to be portrayed as dumb (as usual by Hollywood writers), in not believing a woman who says she escaped from a killer who placed her in a large hole dug in a forested area adjacent to a large city and where several other women were killed and the police perform no forensics such as examining dirt and other organic material; use search dogs or look for a pattern of missing women. They continue to be portrayed as dumb as she escapes multiple times from them pursuing her. It's not as if she's some ""Kick-Ass"" super person! So what gives? Really fragmented writing with little or no background on anyone from the killer, to the prey, to the newly hired detective who not coincidentally is portrayed as a jerk. Nothing creative in the story - same old victim escapes; is not credible to others; killer wants to finish the job; she finishes him. Acting was very good at being acting like - robotic and bland.",1339027200,5,980,4.573863636363637
5089409,3,B007IJKQG4,"Poor Amanda Seyfried can't seem to catch a break. After being cast in a couple of box office hits like Mean Girls and Mamma Mia as well as a series regular on HBO's critical darling Big Love, this girl seemed destined for stardom. But somewhere along the way, she hit a few bumps that has really taken the glow off of her roster; namely a few big bombs like Jennifer's Body, In Time, Chloe, Red Riding Hood (though I found that movie to be much better than Dear John but the box office receipts say otherwise) and now Gone.  And its a real shame to because she really is a good actress Perhaps it's time for her to find a better agent before what's left of her career becomes unsalvageable.

  In Gone, she plays small town waitress Jill who returns home one morning to find her sister Molly has vanished. All of her things are in place and all the doors and windows are locked but as soon as she finds an earring on the floor, Jill immediately goes into distress mode and reports Molly as missing. You see, Jill has a very good reason to be afraid. A year ago she was found wandering aimlessly through the woods claiming to have been abducted from her bed and taken to a hole by an unknown man. According to her, she wasn't the first person to meet up with this guy. Too bad the police couldn't find the so called hole or any remains to any previous victim and, after a year of Jill running around crying wolf in her obsession in finding this serial killer, they are less inclined to believe in anything she has to say. And who can blame them?  After awhile, we do see that Jill can really cook up a story as she goes on a one-woman search to try and find Molly before time runs out.  Does this guy really exist and has he really come back to exact his revenge for her escaping by taking Molly in her place? Or is this just another one of Jill's wild goose chases that will only wind up costing the tax payers' hard earned money and the police department's time and worn thin patience?  No one believes her; not the cops, not her best friend, not even Molly's fianc. But, armed with her wits and a loaded .44, Jill's determined to save her sister and proved once and for all that what she knows to be the truth.

  For what it is, Gone is not a bad movie. It just wasn't handled very well. It's a thriller and there are tons of plot holes big enough to drive a Greyhound bus through but that is usually pretty typical for this kind of movie. At least Jill isn't jumping a bus over a 200' hole in the road and still having it land and be perfectly drivable with no damage to its suspension system or frame.  The acting was good to ok with the only real sour note being in another victim to a poor agent Wes Bently. My only gripe is that the whole Mystery Man is never really developed fully so there is no menace to him at all.  And the whole ending does come off as anticlimactic. But, in the end, it isn't the worst way to waste an hour and a half. Just try and not over think it and nit pick at all the minor inconsistencies.  It is what it is. B+.

I've never seen so much ridiculousness out of a movie. I thought the plot was interesting and I think it could've been well-done, however the whole thing was too unrealistic for my taste. As much as I would like to imagine our heroine as a butt-kicking desperado, I feel like if this was real life she would've been stopped immediately. Also found it to be very anti-climatic and was left with a ""Was that it?"" feeling after it was over. Don't waste the money or the time.",1338508800,5,607,4.428571428571429

Are you debating watching this? Let me help... This was entertaining to say the least and Amanda Seyfried did a fantastic job in her slightly 'crazy' role. It is however, a one time watch imo, so I would not own it. I would recommend watching it for fun, with no expectations, and you will enjoy it.

I won't give any spoilers but this movie keeps you guessing the whole time. Questions will float through your mind while you're entertained in the process. Prepare for a bit of violence, one F-bomb at the end and a couple other swears, and one fairly nude scene at the beginning- She is behind a shower curtain but there is a VERY clear sillouhette. No sex. Fairly clean, well... for todays PG-13 standards. Just a good mystery/action film.

The only reason I would say 3.75 stars instead of 4 is- I liked the entire movie but I didn't love the end. I felt it needed more. I expected more twists and I also hoped for more story at the end... Maybe a love interest? Or not. Just something more... But if you are bored and have nowhere to be gone? (: Watch Gone!",1338249600,7,1144,4.336448598130841
5089415,5,B007IJKQG4,"Jill still has terrifying nightmares about her past, claiming that she was abducted, managing to escape the horror. However, her nightmares persist and she becomes frantic when her sister is missing. Jill files a Missing report with the Police, but no evidence was ever found on her own abduction. Therefore, the police do not find it as serious as Jill does. Furthermore, the suspects that were investigated also take it lightly. Amanda Seyfried plays the hysterical-frightened to death woman who suffers the anticipation of not knowing whether or not Molly is still alive, while reliving her past abduction. Her acting performance is excellent as the viewer endures chilling moments that become intense. Highly recommended for mystery and thriller lovers, who enjoy suspenseful stories. Regardless of how the viewer expects the movie to end, the story is captivating and the main character is not only clever, but has you biting your nails through some scenes.",1337644800,38,962,5.253246753246753

When they don't believe her she decides to track him down herself. This is another movie I had high expectations for based on the preview. This is not really an original idea but still seemed interesting. Amanda Seyfried was believable in this movie as a paranoid victim trying to prove she is right. The movie is tense in parts and frustrating in others and keeps you guessing all the way to the end. There was just something missing in this to make it really good. The plot is simple, almost too simple for a main stream movie like this one. This would have been a really good ""Without A Trace"" show or a ""48 Hours Mystery"" hour show though. It's still worth a watch. Overall, a good movie that could have been better if it added an extra element. Maybe a better ending would have also helped.

Here are the highlights:

PROS:
- Amanda Seyfried does a splendid job with her character/Jill.
- Nice to see the girl from TV Show Dexter in this movie.
- Suspenseful moments.
- Good pace.

CONS:
- The ending is lackluster.  It could've been more of a production in the end.  Not so easily tied up considering the beginning/middle of the story were more complex and interesting.
- The casting seemed a little strange to me.
- Irrelevant and undeveloped characters.  Is it just me but did anyone understand the purpose of the detective Peter Hood?  Also, the serial killer character is seriously underdeveloped.

All in all, I think this movie is worth renting/watching, and I would it recommend to others.  Is it worth buying for 19.99? No.",1334361600,68,967,4.8
