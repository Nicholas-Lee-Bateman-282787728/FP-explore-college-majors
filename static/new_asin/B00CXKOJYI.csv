The Stuttgart production is in every way far superior (for instance, the prelude is riveting in Stuttgart and dull in this one and the class distinctions, which are an essential part of the story, are clear in Stuttgart but obscure here) but it's only available on VHS.

8587237,5,B00CXKOJYI,"In reality, this production  probably deserves 4.5 stars because there are a few problematic points in the stage directing. However, a certain ignorant reviewer decided to give this DVD a ridiculously low rating. This skewed the star-rating that this work really deserves, so I rounded up to 5 stars instead of rounding down to 4 so that the average star rating would better reflect the quality of this production.

This cast is just incredible, and they wholeheartedly embrace the ""dirty"" aspects of this story that this production emphasizes. There is both literal and figurative ""rolling in the hay,"" masturbating soldiers, a striptease, and giant projections of turn-of-the-century pornography (don't watch this DVD with your kids around!) While this kind of over-the-top sexuality is often injected into other Eurotrash productions only for shock value (especially in Mozart opera, for some reason), I found it entirely appropriate for ""Die Soldaten.""

As another reviewer noted, the principles who play Marie (Laura Aikin), Stolzius (Tomacz Konieczny) and Desportes (Daniel Brenna) are superb in their portrayals. But even the singers in small supporting roles stand out (this is, of course, an ensemble piece).

One interesting bit of info--Zimmermann called for a film in his libretto for the fourth act (a  la Berg's ""Lulu."") However, this production gets rid of the film and, instead, has all of the singers come out on stage and sing their parts seated or standing still and staring out at the audience. While a film wouldn't have made sense in the context of this production (linear narrative action is replaced with abstraction), I found this scene to be a bit awkward.

One note: the soprano who plays Marie DOES NOT, I repeat, DOES NOT tightrope over the stage as one particular reviewer has suggested. This is a stunt double. I'll allow the reader to make up their mind as to how this mistake colors that reviewer's assessment of the DVD...",1380844800,14,1956,5.115987460815047

Recorded live at the Salzburger Festspiele, August 2012
Wiener Philharmoniker, Ingo Metzmacher conductor
Alvis Hermanis, stage director and set designer
Marie -- Laura Aikin
Stolzius -- Tomasz Konieczny
Desportes -- Daniel Brenna

This is a fantastic video of the recent live performance of Zimmerman's ""Die Soldaten"" in Salzburg.  I've been listening to it for years, and now I have finally seen it as well!  Incredibly, the music is performed by the Wiener Philharmoniker (Vienna Philharmonic), led by Ingo Metzmacher.  The singing and acting are excellent.  The principals are all compelling -- Laura Aikin is vulnerable and sympathetic as Marie, Tomacz Konieczny is convincing as the hapless Stolzius, and Daniel Brenna is thoroughly despicable as Baron Desportes, who ruins Marie.  The huge cast of soldiers is appropriately and realistically menacing.

Alvis Hermanis's staging is quite dramatic and certainly not strictly realistic.  The 40-meter stage is used to the fullest, with three scenes side-by-side, and the actors sometimes watching, talking, and moving between them.  Behind is a glass wall, and behind it there is more action, including mainly the soldiers in their barracks leering at Marie, but also later horses being led back and forth carrying prostitutes, eventually including Marie.

The story is R-rated, and the viewer should be prepared to feel uncomfortable at times.  This is a story of male brutality against women.  Actually the sex is depicted somewhat symbolically, with the use of large amounts of straw-like material and a rotating glass box to simultaneously focus attention on and hide most of the acts of sex involving soldiers and prostitutes.  At one point a trapeze artist (dressed like Marie, but clearly not Laura Aikin) walks the entire length of the stage to symbolize Marie's knife-edge situation, heightening the tension.

Bernd Alois Zimmerman (1918-1970) was a troubled soul, raised Rhenish Catholic, who fought in the German army in World War II -- he served in Poland, France and Russia -- and committed suicide at the age of 52.  His reputation and influence are greater in Germany than in the rest of the world, where he is mainly known for this superb opera.

THE OPERA
It is not clear that ""Die Soldaten"" (The Soldiers) is autobiographical.  The story, very faithfully adapted from Jakob Michael Reinhold Lenz's theater piece of 1775, is about the moral destruction of a young woman by military officers.  It is about sexism more than it is about militarism or war, a story based on ""the degeneration of the officers' caste"" witnessed by Lenz, the ""unscrupulous behavior of young aristocratic males,"" who at that time were not allowed to marry.  Though the plot does not include any battles or wars, Zimmerman does include sound effects and film projections of war in his instructions for the work's production.

""Die Soldaten"" premiered in 1965, and has since been staged many times in many countries. It has entered the Canon of opera, one of the few operas written since WWII to enjoy such success.  It is often compared to Berg's ""Wozzeck,"" which is also about the military, and this is no accident.  Georg Buchner, who wrote ""Woyzeck,"" was influenced by the earlier Lenz and ""Die Soldaten.""  Zimmerman deliberately named his female lead Marie, as in ""Wozzeck,"" and wrote the opera in 15 scenes, as with ""Wozzeck.""  While ""Wozzeck"" was written from 1914-1922 in the atonal language used by Schoenberg, Berg, and Webern beginning in 1909, ""Die Soldaten"" is written in rigorously serialist style, using the method of 12-tone rows pioneered by Schoenberg in the 1920s.  There are up to 13 instrumental groups playing at different tempos.  Zimmerman also makes extensive use of polystylistic quotes, though, including jazz and Bach, which combined with the vivid characters and vocal writing have played an important role in making the opera popular with opera audiences, not known for their adventurousness.

The plot is simple and easy to follow.  Zimmerman's vision is another matter.  He had a terrible time getting the work produced, and had to compromise his intentions in order to make it feasible in the minds of the producers.  It was commissioned by the city of Cologne in 1958 after its initial conception in 1957.  The 1960 premiere was scuttled, and it was declared unperformable.  In 1963 the WDR Sinfonieorchester performed extracts, proving this to be incorrect, and it only finally premiered in 1965.  Along the way Zimmerman simplified the music score.

Zimmerman's audacious vision involved using opera to express the simultaneity of past, present, and future, what he called ""the spherical construction of time.""  This complexity of time is to be conveyed through the simultaneous presentation of multiple dramatic scenes, as well as through complex multi-media projections.  It is also conveyed by the polystylistic musical elements, jumping back and forward to various periods.  Zimmerman's vision has never been fully realized, and certainly can't be realized on an audio-CD with a linear presentation of scenes and lacking the multi-media dimensions.  Zimmerman envisioned a future ""Omni-mobil"" performance space in which the traditional divide between stage and audience would be broken down in a fully multi-media environment.

Of course the opera's popularity is no doubt mainly despite rather than because of its radical formalistic ambitions.  Moving the stage on railroad tracks with three separate scenes passing before the audience in succession, as in the NYC production at the Park Avenue Armory in 2008, moves toward realizing the vision.

The 38-year-old Michael Gielen leads the Gurzenich-Orchester Koln to a fantastic performance, after an amazing number of rehearsals, documented in the Wergo booklet.  The recording is not live on stage, but rather a February/March 1965 WDR radio recording which was broadcast in April.  Unfortunately it is in mono sound, and while it has dark menace and power, the sound quality leaves much to be desired -- too much is lost.  One place the 1965 recording is superior is in the role of Marie.  Edith Gabry is electric, still the best Marie.  The essay for the original release is included, as well as a new essay on the history of the production.

In 1991, Teldec released a recording from 1988/1989 of the Stuttgart Opera production with Bernhard Kontarsky leading the Staatsorchester Stuttgart and the Chor des Staatstheaters Stuttgart.  It is out of print, but was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/reissued-in-2012/dp/B005MIQG9O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">reissued in 2012</a>.  While the reissue only includes a 24-page booklet with a synopsis and no libretto, and Nancy Shade is not as powerful as Edith Gabry in the role of Marie, the orchestral performance and recording quality make the Teldec recording overall superior to Wergo's mono original.  While not as dark, the texture is nothing short of creamy -- just magnificent.

Personally, I am quite happy to have both, given their complementary strengths and weaknesses.

This new ""Die Soldaten"" is enthusiastically recommended to anyone who enjoys modern and contemporary opera.  It is great to have a video recording, though I will still listen to the audio recordings -- Zimmerman's music is stunning.",1377129600,12,8125,5.6630883567299755
8587239,1,B00CXKOJYI,"After I have seen a DVD I write my reaction to the DVD and place it in the box with the DVD.  Here's this one:
Jim's comments on 'Die Soldaten.  I got notice about a newly written and performed opera. It was the rave of the 2010 Salzburg Music Festival  Zimmermann's 'Die Soldaten'. I bought it. If the literature had mentioned that it was 'Twelve tone technique' music, I would have saved myself some money, and anger over the performance and message of the opera. If you are not familiar with 12 tone stuff, the composer must play each note in the 12 tone register before he can repeat that note again. I think it's a kind of Sudoku for composers. The results does not result in a composition in any key, and has ABSOLUTELY NO melody or harmony, just noise. The 'opera' is presented on a stage that is 40 m across, and there are seven columns and eight huge windows at the back of the stage. The stated message of the opera is 'Women are not born whores, they are made that way'. Throughout the opera there is action on the fore part of the stage, and also behind those big windows. The windows show prostitutes parading back and forth on real horses, men watching the happenings on stage, or giant projected images of naked prostitutes, stripped for action. There is actually a scene with the stage full of clothed men masturbating. When two or three people are singing at the same time it is absolutely impossible to determine if one of them hit a clunker rather than the correct note.  The soprano did demonstrate her balance by walking the length of the stage on a high wire without falling off, and, the drummers did actually hit their drums in unison so as to produce a drum beat that could pass as military tempo.  Is that last feat a sacrilege in a twelve tone technique performance?  I don't know what to do with the DVD. Can that be called 'art' or 'cultural'?",1376956800,4,1872,4.4273255813953485
