6859517,5,B00Q7LS3C8,"Having dove the Galapagos Islands, and at Darwin's Arch in particular.  I loved the video and the documentary done on the whale sharks and other sea life that one encounters at this remote dive site.  Sharing this video with my other dive buddies.",1425859200,,247,4.72093023255814
6859518,4,B00Q7LS3C8,Learned more about whale sharks from this presentation than I ever knew before watching it.,1424476800,,91,5.133333333333334

6859520,5,B00Q7LS3C8,Great movie with lots of sharks and lots of pretty fish and even some of the animals/evolution on the galapagos islands. Learned a lot about whale sharks which was tons of fun.,1424390400,,176,4.53125
6859521,5,B00Q7LS3C8,"Very good show about what is being done to study the whale sharks and the Galapagos islands.  Still more research needs to be done, but that's usually the case when it comes to something like this.",1422316800,,197,4.472222222222222

6859524,2,B00Q7LS3C8,"The forced sensationalism; dramatic music, cut fades, and overly produced narration. This is why the BBC and Nature and PBS dominate you. An American produced Documentary is allowed to be calming and inspiring. Let the viewer gage nature and wonder, spew some facts, be thought-provoking, Honestly, this is some of the best footage ever captured but, it is ruined by the overproduction. The art of being subtle is more valuable than appealing to the lowest-common-denominator.",1516233600,,476,5.36
6859525,4,B00Q7LS3C8,"Being a diver myself this is the type of documentary that reignites my love for the open water.  The only thing is I don't believe in the whole world being millions of years old theory and like most documentaries about the earth etc that's what they push.  That aside, the footage was incredible, the study was fascinating.",1516147200,,323,4.649122807017544

6859528,3,B00Q7LS3C8,We were looking for an interesting shark video for Shark Week and our Ocean Unit Study for homeschooling. Information was repeated throughout the video. The narrator does have a very low monotone type of voice which can make you a bit sleepy. I feel like the video left us wanting with very little informational questions that they posed answered. Where do the whale sharks give birth!? It does give bits of information about other animals in the sea pretty randomly through the video. Gives much information about how researchers were going about their work of tracking the animals. It was only okay.,1501200000,,601,4.901960784313726
6859529,2,B00Q7LS3C8,"It was just very low budget.  Of course the subject is fascinating, the narrator was uninspiring, the graphics could be made by anyone using GoogleEarth (which is not to say that inherently makes them bad, but they were relatively uninformative and not aesthetically pleasing), and there could have been much more material covered than this single research team (not that they were uninteresting, but documentaries should present a greater breadth in their material)/",1500076800,,467,5.397260273972603
6859530,4,B00Q7LS3C8,"Beautiful footage of divers chasing after elusive whale sharks to tag and study them. I was fascinated by how much we still need to understand of the migratory, mating, and birthing habits of whale sharks. Up to 300 young...just mind-blowing.",1499558400,,242,5.075

On a side note, happened to watch this late on one of those sleepless nights and it did the trick, what a way to relax and unwind. Who would ever guess watching giant sharks at 2:00am would help you sleep.",1485216000,,282,4.4423076923076925
6859549,3,B00Q7LS3C8,"Whale sharks are awesome.  The video is good and informative.  For some reason, the background music is so loud in places that it was hard to really hear the words that were being spoken.  So, I guess I'm rating it lower because of the production, not the material.  If you like whale sharks, watch the video!!",1485129600,,310,4.482142857142857

The team of divers were working to install radio identification floats on the sharks so that scientists could follow them on their migrations.  The huge sharks did not seem to be interested in attacking the men, but allowed them to swim alongside and harpoon monitors into their backs or fins (ouch!). They never flinched and never seemed to be in any hurry but swam slowly and steadily on their way.",1485129600,,570,4.69

6859640,5,B00Q7LS3C8,"It may be just that I'm a sucker for undersea adventures, but this film held my fascination throughout. I'm sure the divers were disappointed even as I was that we couldn't witness a live birth of  giant shark. Still, the footage was splendid and I learned much about how scientists go about their exploration of the deep sea. One thing that held my attention was the narrator's wonderment about the reason behind the shark's behavior. I feel more familiar about the subject of food fish and the varieties of them and their place in the food chain. It amazes me how nature keeps these things in balance. One curiosity that remains is how the divers determined the age of the shark and what gave each one it's particular identifying marks. I have a profound respect for the mysteries of the deep and am so pleased to view the beauty of it.",1476576000,5,838,4.549668874172186

This film is beautifully captured and flows at a pace that allows the viewer to absorb the information about these gentle giants. Wonderfully filmed and produced.  I totally recommend it.",1466726400,,509,5.417721518987341
