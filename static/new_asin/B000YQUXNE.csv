3035117,4,B000YQUXNE,Very good telling of the events the night War of the Worlds was broadcast and sent America into panic. The idea that by the late '50s the world was too modern for this to happen again is disproved by more recent broadcasts of the story.,1428019200,,236,4.266666666666667
3035118,5,B000YQUXNE,"I was able to view this thanks to my Amazon Prime membership and it was excellent!  So much better than the 1975 made-for-television movie ""The Night That Panicked America,"" which I saw in my teens back in the 70's. This Studio One presentation depicts the night of October 30th, 1938, in a much better perspective, where we get to see how a person would react if they thought we were being invaded by aliens from another planet.  I actually felt sorry for these poor souls.  After all, they really did believe it was the end of life on earth.

If this is a subject that interests you I would then highly recommend seeing it.",1422144000,2,625,4.456140350877193

This is a depiction of a true event. -- Keep in mind this was made in 1957, is in black and white and don't expect picture/sound quality of something made today.

Growing up, I'd heard stories of how America panicked one October night in 1938 all because of a radio broadcasting an adaptation of HG Wells' ""War of the Worlds"" - and how many Americans actually believed we had been invaded by Martians.  And I'd laugh and find it impossible to believe so many people could be hoaxed like that.

Well, now that I've watched this, it's MUCH easier to see how people might really have bought into it.  And with an estimated 32 million people listening in nationwide, you can imagine that if only a small percentage of them bought into this how much panic that would still cause.

Don't laugh too hard at them - even now in 2012, we believe tons of lies we hear on TV, radio, the internet etc.

I totally recommend this movie for anyone interested in seeing how things went down then. It's a valuable lesson given in an entertaining way.

Enjoy!",1345766400,9,1047,4.478947368421053
3035122,2,B000YQUXNE,"The most relevant part of the title is 1957.  This program tells us more about life in the mid fifties than the late thirties.  The attitudes and reactions of the actors are classic starched shirt - up-tight - cold war America.  Ed Asner, the actor pictured on the cover, has a very minor roll and almost no dialogue.  The running time listed on the package says 90 minutes, but it actually only runs for 45. To me, the most striking thing about the presentation was that the fact that the actors in this version were better than the ones in the original radio plays.  The other is that they did not give us the whole program, only bits and pieces interspersed with vignettes of the hapless public running around acting very 1950-ish.  Watch this one for a slice of life, but not for a good look at the radio play or its actual effects.",1210723200,5,836,4.396103896103896

8233890,5,B000YQUXNE,Excellent production. A nolgistic look back in history.,1485475200,,55,6.0
8233891,1,B000YQUXNE,"Poor video quality; this is mostly a kinescopic replay of an old Edward R. Murrow report on the Orson Welles ""War of the Worlds"" broadcast.  Warren Beatty has a MINIMAL appearance (I was doing a search of his movies which is how I came across this item).",1483747200,,254,4.404255319148936
8233892,5,B000YQUXNE,"It was interesting to see the ""old-time"" live radio broadcast production. Of course it is an adaption - but a good one - of the famous Orson Welles broadcast adaption of H.G. Wells ""War of the Worlds."" I did not see a cameo by Orson but may watch it again. Refreshing to Edward R. Murrow being able to smoke. (I know he died from lung cancer.) Warren Beatty as a snotty frat boy, and so on. I can see where Rod Serling got his influences. Oh, at first I thought the movie was about the ""Hurricane of 1938""!
My wife is trying to use it for her school children in classes to teach them why they should not believe everything they see and hear on social media and so on. Who at Amazon would they contact to stream this?",1475625600,,716,4.158273381294964

8233894,5,B000YQUXNE,"This was a surprisingly good program. We've all heard of the Orson Wells War of the Worlds 1938 Halloween scare. This is a play based on the play and people's reactions. It cool seeing unknown actors who later became famous. Edward R. Murrow does a terrific job of narrating the story, and the acting and reenacting is well done. It's an attention holder and well told.",1448323200,,369,4.606060606060606
