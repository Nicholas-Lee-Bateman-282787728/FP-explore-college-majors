When it's good, it's terrific, including an amazing performance by a very young Elle Fanning as a mentally troubled 8 year old, and good work by Felicity Huffman, and the always wonderful Patricia Clarkson.

On the other hand, the very talented Campbell Scott is stuck playing a character that's one note joke, and the tone of the film is all over the place; odd quirky comedy one moment, a child contemplating suicide the next.

But the real problems are when the film's Lifetime network roots show through, and suddenly there's that warm, fuzzy, phony feeling that being a kid with severe emotional problems isn't all that bad, and everything will be just fine. It undermines the film's valiant attempts to really get inside a
struggling kid's head.

None-the-less, in a world of cookie-cutter filmmaking, the film gets real points for trying, and about 80% of the time, this is a very good, and very original film.",1447804800,,950,4.881987577639752
