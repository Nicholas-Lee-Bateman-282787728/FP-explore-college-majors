8146359,3,B000IMVE6E,"10 minutes into the film the plot is explained. A US experimental facility accidentally created a huge rat using a plague virus. They abandoned the facility and the virus infected the locals in a subplot. A small group of army  people enter the building to kill the rat, a mission which is explained to them after they get there.

The army personnel all seem to have different orders which conflict with each other as the doors become sealed and an explosive timer is set.

This is a version of Japanese cheese. The rat creature was a rubber suit that lacked any hope of realism. In one scene they decide to hold some double doors shut against said rat. Their bodies block the doors on one side...doors that swing open the opposite direction.

In a heroic moment the doctor decides to treat the patients and how does one describe the taste of coke?

For fans of Japanese horror only.

8146362,4,B000IMVE6E,"there was going to be a movie called NEZULLA: THE RAT MONSTERS in 1965 by DAIEI PICTURES. it was about giant rats invading Japan. however filming the rats on a miniature landscape proved to be a disaster, they could not be ''trained'' to behave in a certain manner, were biting stagehands, multiplying, etc. a neighbor of the studio called in the health dept & the rats were all killed. they made GAMERA: THE INVINCIBLE instead.",1347494400,2,428,4.72
8146363,5,B000IMVE6E,"This movie does INDEED prove that it doesn't take millions and millions of dollars just to make a TRULY AWESOME FILM!And with me being a huge
fan of the Japanese KAIJU EIGA genre and everything else TOKUSATSU,I was
extremely impressed at how well this film was made considering it cost
less than $300,000.00 to make it,and both the latest trend of GODZILLA
and GAMERA films have been way on up there in at least the millions!
Everything in NEZULLA: THE RAT MONSTER is top notch! The script,the
acting,the monster suit and suitmation effects,and the great music
score for the film will COMPLETELY BLOW YOU AWAY!It is quite obvious
that the other reviewer just isn't a fan of this particular genre,and
if you're not a fan,then more than likely you probably wouldn't enjoy it!
But if you are a fan,than by all means try to get this one as soon as you
can! I hope my review was helpful.",1231113600,5,882,4.5886075949367084

the cake is the giant rubber Rat costume..... i had to foward it to the end to

end this movie.",1168214400,2,243,3.6346153846153846
