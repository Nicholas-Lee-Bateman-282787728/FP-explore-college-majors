3736402,5,B001OTZOS4,"The 'Law of Attraction' is important in the lives of those who know and believe, while with many others, they'll always struggle to continue the rest of their days! The 'Science of Getting Rich' is an important step for everyone else out there who really wants what only the many conglomerates, fundamentalist sectarian religions, entertainers, and more have! Sure, one may  have been born into wealth, but they have to keep working hard or taking from other people in order to continue having it and living 'high on the hog'! With this movie you really learn how to attract and envision yourself with money, while learning how to make it happen in your life! A definite must have in my book!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Charity-The-Rodeo/dp/1440498466/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Charity: The Rodeo</a>",1233360000,22,849,5.738095238095238
3736403,5,B001OTZOS4,"The Science of Getting Rich is a great DVD about the philosophy it takes to become rich. It is about the correct attitude of attraction. Really, the law of attraction. Wattles had it nailed down and this DVD explains it and gets the message to those who don't like to read.",1233100800,14,273,4.372549019607843
3736404,5,B001OTZOS4,"The world is full of get rich schemes, which most are schemes. In these poor economic times anything that can promise more green in the pocket will catch anyone's eyes. This DVD, ""The Science of Getting Rich: The Movie"" was one of those eye catching tittles that compelled me to watch it. In my opinion, this is not a scheme but of method of acquiring and maintaining wealth. This DVD presents Wattle's 1910 classic into a movie format which, like me, the public can catch the imagination and determination of a proven method of being wealthy. In 1910 the book changed thousands of lives and brought prosperity to a nation. Now in this century, adopted for our use and addiction to technology, this DVD presents the same method in a format that we can understand and enjoy. This is a must have for any movie collection or for the person truly desiring a pathway to wealth.",1232841600,14,872,4.596153846153846
3736405,5,B001OTZOS4,"I have been a student of  metaphysics for nearly 30 years, so I've seen a lot of great books, audios, and DVDs. This is one of the best - its core. Modern authors like Mark Victor Hanson, Tony Robbins and Harv Eker can be motivating and exciting, (and fun to listen to!), but if you desire to find the heart of the true laws of abundance and success, go to those who first brought them to the world. Where do you think the modern 'gurus' get their info? Watch this DVD, it will make a difference.  (I bought it before it was even out on Amazon - glad to see it here!)",1230854400,8,567,4.053571428571429
3736416,5,B001OTZOS4,This work is power-packed--- the most definitive DVD ever produced on getting rich. A proven strategy for a century. Well done.,1242864000,17,127,5.095238095238095
3736417,5,B001OTZOS4,"I learned about The Science Of Getting Rich from listening to 'The Secret' by Rhona Byrne...
Don't be fooled, Wattles 'Sience Of Getting Rich' is comprehensive and it's no ""easy to follow"" stuff.

However, for those willing to tread the waters of the early 1900s, the message of this DVD is wonderful and can potentially change your life.

I have really enjoyed watching this DVD edition! Well worth the look, one of my favorites. I re-watch it every month! A must look for all fans of 'The Secret'.",1242864000,19,499,4.659090909090909
3736418,5,B001OTZOS4,"This is a superb presentation of the Wattles philosophy that opens up the whole ""science"" of cosmic reality. As a regular viewer of The Secret I have been looking for something to add to my library for regular and continual self-improvement and this is it. What I really love about it is the explanation of how the universe works without being preachy, a message put across with all of Wattles' humility and assuredness. Excellent.",1242604800,16,431,4.837837837837838
3736419,5,B001OTZOS4,"This was what I needed to fully understand Wattles work.  There is nothing 'new' added - nor would I want someone else to do 'their' version, but, by seeing everything that is stated by Wattles, it really, really works.

Highly recommended!  10 out of 10!!!",1240444800,6,257,4.666666666666667
3736420,5,B001OTZOS4,"I watched the Secret, and I have read Wallace Wattles book, and I think I understood them - but the Secret was very 'light' and Wattles book was good but I was missing something.  This DVD was what was missing, its still the book, but it SHOWS me what I needed to understand.  Simple, eh?  Well, now I know how to manifest.

Well worth the cost of a two DVD set, since you can manifest the cost of it right back!",1239753600,5,412,4.049382716049383
3736421,5,B001OTZOS4,"I just LOVED this Wattles Classic brought to life on my TV!  Wow!

Think and Grow Rich, and the Science of Getting Rich were two of the major books that changed my life.  I read them both over and over yearly.

And to find the Science of Getting Rich as a faithful DVD adaption, I have been blessed by the Universe.

Powerful, simply Powerful.....perhaps not for those who just sit and cry, but for those of us who desire change in our lives: A Must Watch!

Truly, a blessing, watch this set over and over - and watch the change in your life.",1237680000,8,542,4.213592233009709
3736422,2,B001OTZOS4,"I bought this program based on the consistent 5 star reviews.  I'm an audio and visual learner.  I was excited to sit down and watch this with my husband, but we couldn't get past Chapter 1.  The narrator's voice was unbearable.  It sounded like he was reading straight from the book, with absolutely no connection to the material.  The pacing was too fast, without necessary pauses or appropriate inflection.  It was so weird.  I feel pretty neutral about the video component, and wouldn't have even cared if the audio reached me, but it was so irritating and disappointing that we just had to turn it off.  I'm all about focusing on the positive.  I'm a metaphysical life coach.  And so, writing a less than positive review on amazon, is not something I do regularly or take lightly.  But I felt a responsibility to share my experience.  For anyone else who might be seeking an alternative to reading, I honestly don't feel this is it.",1237248000,11,937,4.646341463414634
3736423,5,B001OTZOS4,"Its nice to order something over the internet and get more then you expected.  This SOGR DVD was not some interviews ABOUT the origional work, but it was a MOVIE version of the origional work!!!!  I loved it!  It was what I wished I had when I first read Wattles book, this DVD makes it so much more powerful and easier to manifest - just follow the DVD and get the results you want.

You don't need 'new guru's' when the origional material is presented so well.",1236124800,7,462,4.275862068965517
3736424,5,B001OTZOS4,"I had read the SOGR before, a few times, but this DVD really made it clear - there is something about 'Seeing' a process - over just reading it - perhaps it's just visual people like me (70% of us are), but I can tell you - if you have not 'got it' yet, then WATCH and practice the Science in this movie - esp. now when times appear bad - this is when you need to invest in yourself!

Prosperity Thinking!!!",1235520000,7,407,3.9634146341463414
3736425,5,B001OTZOS4,"Too often there are 'updated' or someone trying to cash in on an old title with all the original material gone.  not so here, this DVD set is the original made into a movie - what a great idea!  I had read the book before, but could not get as much wondering about some ideas or concepts, but this movie makes it very clear!  Great job!",1235260800,7,336,4.0606060606060606
8331544,4,B001OTZOS4,"This is one of the most powerful tools I have used - simple, effective, direct, close to the original, yet with up to date examples.

If you follow the directions in the film, watch and DO what it states, you will learn how to get rich, or get what you desire.  If you are looking for some sort of Di Vinci code or something silly like that, or something from hollywood, just to to blockbuster and spend you money there.

This is for serious students ready to follow the steps.

It works!",1266710400,8,488,4.271739130434782
8331545,5,B001OTZOS4,"I read the SOGR as an ebook, (free on the net), and its good, but the challenge for me was this whole ebook thing, it just does not work for me.

So I borrowed this DVD (and now will buy it), and found the experience totally different and so valuable.

First, the DVD will provided me with the book, in a audio and visual way that I could keep my focus on, it actually helped me to relax and follow the manifestation training much better - because reading it on the computer as an ebook did nothing for me.

Second, by enjoying the visuals and the movie, it allowed me to watch it repeatedly (and I actually was looking forward to watching it over again many times), which made the entire process very simple.

In my opinion, Wattles is the key pin on learning how to manifest, if you want to follow it, read the hard copy book, and or watch this DVD, the DVD will speed up you ability to learn manifesting, and in that case it has an unlimited value.

10 Stars!",1255305600,7,962,4.206521739130435
8331546,5,B001OTZOS4,"This two DVD set hits the mark square on the head.  It delivers the entire book, nothing missing, all Wattles.

You will find, if you are like me, that you will watch this over and over, and use it as if Wattles was there, over your shoulder, teaching and training you, like part of your mastermind group.

The way I used it was to watch each chapter, until I was very sure I was able to carry out what Wattles taught, each time I would watch a chapter, I found it clearer, and clearer.

The SOGR is much more deep and - I hate to say it - difficult to carry out or to learn to manifest then many of today's McDonald culture people like, its not going to work after watching or reading the book and dreaming up a lotto win.

However, most of those like me who know that Wattles and the SOGR really works, know that they must also work at manifesting.  Now, the good thing is that it is all in the this movie.  Forget anything you know in the past, or read about the SOGR in a good or bad way, just read/watch it and put it to us.

It works!  This movie version is will make it come faster - only because it will propel into your subconscious faster.",1255219200,8,1149,4.071111111111111
8331547,5,B001OTZOS4,"This is a major piece of work!  The book (which I own) is transformed to live, with a series of visual explanations of the actual science of getting rich.

Most people, like me are visual, and this program will work for people who are, as the movie has all 17 chapters of Wattles classic work, with all the visualizations you need to understand AND ACT on them!

Its as if you were having a conversation with Wattles, and he was sending you the images or movies of what he meant.

This will speed up the process of manifestation.  I actually got much more from this 2 DVD set then I expected.

If you are serious about your future, you will be watching one chapter per day and working on yourself.

I am very pleased and I am on my 3rd viewing.",1255046400,8,744,4.23404255319149
8331548,3,B001OTZOS4,"I was very dissapointed in this ""Movie""? after having it compared to ""The Secret"". It is nothing of the kind. This is simply an audio book being read verbatim. The ""Movie"" consists of a powerpoint style slide show with weak moving graphics that seem canned, repeated, and often unrelated to the subject material. It is in no way, form, or fashion, a movie. I could have made this myself. I have 2 normal audio books of ""The Science of Getting Rich"" that are both superior to this one. The reading is in monotone, and feels hurried and rushed. Many of the graphics serve only as a distraction. If you can stand to watch it over and over, you will probably succeed in memorizing the book, but the presentation is too annoying for me to want to watch again. I might leave it on in the background and just listen to it like a regular audio book, but then again, my other 2 versions are much better.",1254355200,8,894,4.391566265060241
8331549,5,B001OTZOS4,"I've read the book, and I found the book very good, I have also listen to an audio version of the book, but I think that what really made the Science of Getting Rich become meaningful to me, and useful and instructive, was this movie version.

Each of the ideas, the methods, the ways that Wattles says we must think and act are well presented here.  There are good captions, that reinforce Wattles' words, as well as live action and images of exactly what Wattles is suggesting in his book.

I am not kidding when I say that I watched each of the 17 chapters over 6 times each, and some much more.

Bottom line, if you are looking for a Hollywood version of the book, like some sort of plot, this is not it.  This is Wattles work on film!  That is what I wanted, I don't want someone else giving me what THEY think is the Science of Getting Rich, I want the author to do so!

And that's why I bought this DVD and I fully and 100% recommend it to you too!",1253318400,12,955,4.102150537634409
8331550,1,B001OTZOS4,This product was presented as being a movie.  This is nothing but a bunch of slides with the book narrative as voice over.  The entire text of the book is available for free at many websites.  This is by far the worst product that I have ever purchased from Amazon.  don't waste your time or money on this.,1253145600,7,306,4.224137931034483
8331551,5,B001OTZOS4,"Don't we all want to be rich? The answer would be.... Of course! Well look at this DVD and find out how to get rich! With all the new fangled technology and communications tools there is today then thats what can happen! Becoming rich! What wonderful ways to become rich! I am glad someone came out with this. Very informative!

  If you need a visual help to understand everything then here you go. The Science of Getting Rich: The Movie - 2
Disk Set. If you want to discover a wonderful way of making it easier in life just go to this DVD!

Highly recomended!

8331552,5,B001OTZOS4,"I ordered this DVD and was very happy by the end of the first chapter.  The Movie follows the book and demonstrates in a comprehensive and creative way the no-nonsense approach Wattles takes to explaining and teaching how to manifest ANYTHING in the Universe.

I found the visuals stimulating, the production very professional, the techniques easy to understand, and a very high level of mastery with this production.  The DVD is very impactful and intelligent.  This unlocking of the Science of Getting Rich is what I and many people are looking for and its presented here fully, professionally, and powerfully.

By the end of the 2nd DVD I was ready to watch it again, and practice many of the key and intensive methods Wattles explains via this presentation.

Well done, and great job.",1248393600,8,788,4.887218045112782
8331553,2,B001OTZOS4,Got the movie 'cause I loved the book. Very disapointed. Unprofessional at best. Seems like the producer has no clue as to the priciples being taught. The words say do NOT look at poverty or think of poverty and at the same time show extreem poverty conditions. Sometimes the visuals have no relevence to the words at all. Some of the visuals are absurd. Some of the visuals don't even make sense. Save your money on this one and buy the CD instead.,1247616000,3,449,4.421686746987952
