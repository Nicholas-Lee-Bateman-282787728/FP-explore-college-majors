8497042,2,B00005U13C,A really bad Hong Kong kung fun movie probably made for kids. So awful that it's a lot of fun. It's a comedy anyway.,1241308800,,116,3.875
8497043,1,B00005U13C,"I doubt the reviewer previous to me actually saw this movie, but let me assure any potential purchasers that this movie is garbage. The plot moves like an old man on a bad acid trip. What there is of decent martial arts action is overshadowed by the ridiculous hopping of the ghost-children.
Unless you want to laugh your way through the plot and action, just look elsewhere for an old-school kung-fu flick, this is just garbage :P",1070236800,,431,4.6103896103896105
