Matt is a 39 year old Don Juan obsessed with cleanliness and perfection searching for the perfect woman. Unable to find her, he settles for being with five girls simultaneously for the last three years. Each of his girlfriends has one aspect of their personality that Matt finds completely magnificent, but in each of them there's also one negative aspect that he finds utterly repulsive: Cherry is a great listener but becomes a masochist during the act; Glenda is wonderful to be seen with in public but all she knows how to talk about is French fashion; Katie is exciting in conversation but, because of her age (50-something!) is boring in the bedroom; Sunburst is an incredible young lover but adamantly refuses to use condoms; Tracy only drinks wine, like Matt, but never takes off her work sneakers. What do each of these lovely ladies have in common: they were all devirginized by Matt! So Matt, fatigued by this three-year fiasco and somewhat discontent with his own obsessive-compulsive lifestyle, decides to break up with each of his unique girlfriends and goes to his favorite wine bar to try and forget them. Then he meets Nellie, dressed like Glenda with a philosophical mind far beyond Katie. She only drinks wine, like Tracy, is not religious like Sunburst, and proves just as good a listener as Cherry. Nellie seems to be Matt's perfect match, his soul companion, even. But with perfection there comes a cost that could tear Matt's world apart.",1253923200,,1477,4.884462151394422
