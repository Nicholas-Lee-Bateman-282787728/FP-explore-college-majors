2991829,5,B000WTZ6SK,"Well.......it's about time, good on ya, Universal,I wanted the rest before I faded out, at least now I'm a series closer, I can only hope the last half series will follow. All jokes aside,this is a really great series, saddened by the passing of Johnothan Brandis, and bolstered by superlative acting performances from Roy Scheider, Michael Ironside,Don Franklyn, and a great array of series guest stars (let's face it, if you can get Charlton Heston, anything is possible) the special effects are, again, high above the mark, and the John Debney theme is the best fantasy TV theme since Goldsmith""s ""Star Trek"".

2991875,5,B000WTZ6SK,"I was a big SQDSV fan, when it came out on TV. It was different enough to be interesting and at that time, the EFX were state of the Art. The ship was a high tech wonder, and probably the star of the show. Roy Scheider was pretty good as the Captain Bridger.
I enjoyed Season 1 and had videotaped all the off air shows, but missed a lot of Season 2 due to a location change, so I ordered this set.
Sadly I didn't enjoy Season 2 as much, because it looked like (and turned out to be I was right) the writers were all different, and the producers
shifted the focus to add more sensational (aka Stupid) plot lines. It looked like some of the shows were lifted right out of the old TV show,
Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, by Irwin Allen. And now, of course, its then state of art Effects look dated, and video gamish.
If I ever find it in a bargain bin, I might pick up Season 3 just to complete my set.",1441238400,,901,3.956043956043956

2991959,1,B000WTZ6SK,"I've been revisiting Seaquest lately.  I just watched all the first season shows and I really enjoyed them, even 20 years later.  Great crew, decent stories, good show.  But once you get into second season, it is SO SO SO painfully bad.  I miss the crew that was taken off.  The new set tries a little too hard to look slick (like the new bridge-it's obviously just a bunch of flashing lights just for the purpose of having flashing lights).  But most of all the stories in this season were terrible. The only good thing I can say about this season is that, even though the stories are bad, it did get a little more into character development.  For example, Ortiz was like a whole new character in this season. He had much more screen time and personality in this season.  Same with Ford.  We got to meet Ford's family in this season.  Don Franklin is very good.  Of course, his family was then chased by a giant alligator. This is also the season that Lucas started getting second billing, right after the captain.  Seaquest is almost like 3 different series--first season is like Star Trek Next Generation.  Second season is like-well, TV hell.  Third season was good, but also very different from the other two seasons, more like a Deep Space Nine or Enterprise kind of seriousness.  Anyway, skip season 2 of seaquest.  They blew it.",1417910400,,1336,4.5738396624472575
2991960,5,B000WTZ6SK,"With one foot in the future and a little bit of sci-fi, Seaquest had some unusual stories. With good special effects, you were taken on a journey of discovery. I liked the variety of characters with their varying personalities. I was sorry to see Capt. Bridger replaced and the stories become darker. My favorite characters were the Daggers, especially Michael DeLuise.",1417824000,,369,5.065573770491803

It is a satisfying series, apart from the third season which ends abruptly because the show was cancelled.

2992037,2,B000WTZ6SK,"If you look at the names involved, you have to wonder why the season so often flops around like a fish out of water. Rockne O'Bannon (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Farscape-Complete-Series-Blu-ray/dp/B00E688720/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Farscape: Complete Series [Blu-ray</a>]), Peter DeLuise (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stargate-SG-1-The-Complete-Series-Collection/dp/B000TJBNHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stargate SG-1: The Complete Series Collection</a>), and Steven Spielberg ($$) are credited with contributing to this season. Not even the charisma and talent of Roy Scheider could balance out the erratic, sometimes awful scripts handed to the other actors. Bad lines and questionable plots certainly contributed to the mediocrity of this season, but there is plenty of blame to go around.

The show couldn't decide what it was, and when pushing boundaries it often just went off a cliff.

The aliens in the episode ""The Fear That Follows"" shuffle around like distressed mimes, less convincing even than the spacemen from the film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Teenagers-from-Outer-Space/dp/B00004W1A5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Teenagers from Outer Space</a>&nbsp;(1959). This is followed by a prescient yet pedestrian episode that preaches about how computers (especially computer games) will become so important that people will stop relating to one another in the flesh.

Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker!) guest stars as a professor / alien hybrid (because that makes sense) in ""Dream Weaver,"" but the episode was so bad that I didn't even care about the fate of my once-favorite actor's character.

Oh, and while I have nothing against sea mammals, there is a talking dolphin onscreen far too often, which shatters any pretense of serious drama that SeaQuest might have been trying to pull off. Maybe this actually was a good show in 1994, but it certainly didn't age well.

Yet despite all this, there was usually something charming in each episode that kept me wanting to take a chance that the next episode would be worth my time. The acting is generally fine (aside from Dagwood's ""gentle giant"" persona being overplayed to the point of a 4-yr-old), and there is almost enough ""sci-fi"" in the season to keep aficionados engaged. The short little bits during the closing credits where SeaQuest actors take turns throwing some facts at you about sea animals is still a nice way to end each episode. Final verdict: Be willing to travel back to 1994 television, and Proceed at your own risk.",1374969600,,2627,6.051075268817204
2992038,3,B000WTZ6SK,"I wanted to like this series more.  while it is not ""lowbrow"" science fiction like Lost in Space, for example, Seaquest was dumbed down for low average intelligent viewers.  The result is a relatively slow moving show with simple plots.  The actors are solid and Roy Schieder particularly shines as Captain Bridger.  I wish the producers had believed more in the intelligence of their audience.  At the price charged by Amazon, it is worth purchasing and viewing if you are a die-hard science fiction fan.  The disks I received are single-sided, by the way.  One irony is that the newly introduced mentally-challenged character played by Peter DeLuise is more perceptive and better at solving problems than the officers of the crew!  It appears that the DeLuise brothers had a lot of fun acting this series.",1367107200,,807,4.925925925925926

2992068,5,B000WTZ6SK,"I must admit I first experienced Seaquest DSV on Netlix (am I allowed to say that here on Amazon?), but very quickly after just a couple of episodes realized that I wanted to buy this on DVD and add it to my collection. This is one of those series that is a hidden gem that somehow I missed when it was on back in the early 90's. If you are a fan of science fiction or even just a fan of Roy Schieder then you will enjoy this series.

I think I saw another reviewer say something like this is Star Trek under water and I have to say that's a really accurate description. There is a great deal of the human element involved in these episodes and there is a ecological undertone to many episodes as well expressed with an attitude of innocence that is rather charming.

Perhaps one other part of this series that struck a chord with me is what I would call the ""Galaxy Quest"" intro. I thought Galaxy Quest was a very good parody and now having seen the introduction to Seaqust DSV I know that they weren't just parodying Star Trek, but this series as well.

There is much to watch here and the efforts of many good people to watch as well. Stephen Speilberg, Roy Scheider and a great supporting case are a few that should be mentioned. It was even a pleasant surprise to see Dom DeLuise in one episode(and his sons in many others). Good fun, good stories, good value for the price - highly recommended.",1348358400,,1400,4.275471698113208

2992103,2,B000WTZ6SK,"I own both season 1 and 2 on dvd. Still waiting for Seaquest 2032 to be released.

Season 2.. I prefer season one over two for several reasons. First of all the characters that are in season one were better than season 2. There is no Hitchcock and her amazing eyes. This season were treated with psychic smith with big boobs, who walks around in the opener showing off her goods, but then as the season progresses it some how vanishes and she becomes almost uncomfortable in her role. The only eye candy in this season is LT. Henderson, and maybe a few shower scenes with smith. Henderson has a few good moments in several episodes where she's walkng around in tube tops, or tight jeans. I'm a guy and sex appeal is a must..

My biggest prob with season 2 is most of the characters are annoying and douchey. Wasn't a fan of brody, the general, or Ted Raimi(can't think of his seaquest name). Piccolo was annoying, but was the only cool smartass one on seaquest. Also didn't care for the daggers or some of the very strange missions this season went on over season one.

I would have preferred some on screen relationships. I mean they are on tour and on a sub and there isn't anything going on? They touched very lightly with raimi and henderson, and even bridger and smith, and lucas with his 24hr love interest. I mean come on, have something going on, instead of an hr long borefest about the mission at hand.

Lucas is cool but at times is over dramatic, but I noticed that in a few of his other roles in his other movies, he's always over dramatic. Cpt Bridger is ok too. Not much diff than the 1st season.

I was happy they did away with the DR ballard clip facts at the end of every episode. In this season each of the case give facts about sea life. Way better than ballard.

Most of the episodes were ok. There were some that were down right lame. Killer plants, killer aliens, the episode with brody's mom, the dagger episodes even with one where everybody things dagwood is a killer and the most irritating one is the one they get into a time travel thing underwater and they find out 2 kids are controlling robots in an empty town and their mother is a computer. Sincerest form of flattery where bridger faces bridger was my fav out of season 2.

With that said, season 2 wasn't as good as 1, but there were things in 2 that were better than one.

If you own season 1, pick up this one, its worth checking out. Hopefully some day they release the final season.",1293667200,,2472,4.3354978354978355
2992104,4,B000WTZ6SK,From Spielberg's heyday and yet he couldn't quite get any of his TV projects to gel like his movies did.  Someone should do a thesis on why these movie giants fail in the transition to the small screen so often...but I digress...the second season of Seaquest is just as entertaining as the first and still found no audience beyond the teeny-boppers (is that still a viable term?) who flocked around Jonathan Brandis and kept the whole sub afloat for a couple of seasons.  But all that aside I liked it then...I like it now.  Well produced (how could it not be) and family oriented it should have had smooth sailing but by the end of this second season was floundering on the rocks with well publicized 'creative' differences surfacing between Roy and the producers (including Mr. S.).  By the final season (which I would like to see released on DVD before I die) the whole direction and focus had changed and Scheider was gone and along with it the direction the whole series had begun with. The focus was more on action in the third.  This review is almost as convoluted as the series had become but reviewing the series almost forces that result.  Bottom line.  It's a classy show that should have done better and didn't but is still entertaining and worth watching.  This season lets Brandis move forward a bit and Scheider is a great moral center.  It also lets the crew begin to shine as we've become accustomed to their individual personalities by now and several stories focus on them to good effect.  If you're a Seaquest fan you won't be disappointed with Season Two.,1285200000,,1576,4.636690647482014

For example, on one episode in the final season, Lucas the teen genius actually announces that he's looking for a girlfriend, at the same time a certain cute young female crew member (I can't remember her name) seems to be practically begging for his attention! I mean, how ridiculous is that?

Come to think of it, the whole show was chock-full of hot females with very little to do other than say a few bad lines now and then -- if some of them would have had a few flings with the men or even just gotten naked occasionally, the show might have been much more successful!  ;-)",1269561600,,693,4.364341085271318

The first season was a bit more realistic but this season was fun.  I've always been a fan of Roy Scheider.  As well as a fan of Jonathan Brandis ever since I saw NESII.

I can not wait for the release of season three because I haven't seen any of those episodes at all.  I just hope it doesn't take Universal another two years to release it.

Some of the only amusing characters are dumped and the entire Seaquest universe is changed from one of a semi-realistic future to complete fantasy.  It is like the series was pillaged for every scrap of originality and likability it had and was replaced with a sorry copy-of-a-copy template into which the characters and story were forcibly inserted.  Roy Scheider was correct to call the stories of season 2 ""childish trash"" and it's no wonder he abandoned this debacle of a series ""evolution"" after this season.  I never write reviews, but I was stunned that no one had given this only 1 star so I had to stand up.  The fact that the season starts the series in the ocean and ends it with Seaquest on some other planet fighting aliens that look like rejected dummies from a bad 1980's horror movie should be enough to convince you to steer clear if you still have any doubts.

2992132,4,B000WTZ6SK,"As an avid sci-fi fan, I very much liked this season. As a rabid seaQuest fan, I didn't.

Hard to explain to someone who has never seen the series. But I'll try.

I really loved the characters in season one, and their relationships with one another. But many didn't come back for a second season.

So instead of the in-your-face, powerful-when-needed screen presence of Dr. Kristin Westphalen, a believable love interest for the Captain, believable surrogate mother for Lucas, we get some mind-reading, less than steller character called Dr. Wendy Smith. I didn't like that the writers tried to involve her with Bridger - thankfully, it didn't work. And I didn't like that Westphalen's departure wasn't mentioned at all. (and neither were any of the other characters who departed) With the season one finale, and the character's growing releationship with Bridger, I expected to hear at least a small mention of her.

Also departing were Engineer Katie Hitchcock, Ben Krieg, and Chief Crocker. The studio wanted younger actors . . . . These characters and their histories were so well developed, I think this was a bad move on the studio's part.

They were replaced by talented actors, but, after caring about what happened to the characters from season 1, I was less interested in caring about a new set who may very well disappear in season 3. (which did happen . . . )

This season had far more of a sci-fi feel to it, which I would have loved (being a fan of ST:TNG, Star Wars, Earth 2 and so many others) had the first season not so fully hooked me into the believability of what could actually happen if man colonized the sea.

A fully telepathic doctor, a character with gills (not so believable, though I did like the character), a genetically engineered character, took the series in a complete other direction from the first season. It was so dramatic, I, like so many others, were turned off it during its first run.

The acting was still very good, but the direction of the stories to complete science fiction, did put me off a lot since I so very much enjoyed the first season.

And there were no extra features on season 2. At least season 1 had deleted scenes!

Now, I want it to round out my collection, same with season 3 if its ever released. Not my favorite, but still enjoyable to watch, nonetheless.",1208822400,2,2320,4.65036674816626
2992133,5,B000WTZ6SK,"This series is every bit as good as the rest of the reviewees say, but it had one very disappointing omission. The season two finale, where Seaquest takes a very, very long trip, is missing.  I do not know if this is because they wanted to combine it with season three, to give the final season more meat, or if they just decided not to include it for other reasons.  Regardless, it is a significant loss.

One other thought, and I encourage others to speculate on it.  Marco Sanchez returns in this season.  In the first season he played a squared-away, regulation haircut Navy rating always in a pressed uniform, and looking sharp.  This season, he has a bit more of a ruffian look, with long curly locks and a face that looks more unshaven that not. Which is okay since this is all fiction, anyway.  But the thing that made me blink is that I remember from watching the show on TV that Sanchez had the most outrageous and impractical 'do, especially for a military vessel, rather than the free-flowing locks sported in these disks.  So, did the producers change the footage to something much more believable, or is my tired mind remembering something that never was?  Comments appreciated.",1208131200,,1192,4.6380952380952385

Mostly environmental but there was alot of heart and commentary in the series, which is what sci-fi was supposed to be about.  And even more so the first season was indeed, fiction about science, hence the term Science Fiction!  Not the mindless eye candy we get now.  Yes there is some mindless eye candy episodes in this second season but they are still a joy to watch.  Only downbeat thing is that Roy and Brandis are no longer with us.  Steven Spielberg certainly did try and pour his best resources into it and really how often do we get a tv show spawned by Spielberg!

The show was obviously inspired by Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, and following that trend Spielberg put a top notch Hollywood actor Roy Scheider in the role, here the great one is in a TV show of all things!  Really unique television indeed.  This obstensibly ended the era of great producers, great leading cast, guest roles(Charleton Heston!) and very thought provoking stories.

2992153,3,B000WTZ6SK,"Seaquest is a great show, and I'm not debating that. Other reviewers have pointed out the good points of the show and I heartily agree with them.  My three star rating has less to do with the show and more to do with the actual production of the DVD.  First of all, it took FOREVER to be released.  That fact, while annoying, was not a factor in the lower star rating.  Some good things take a while.

My complaint is that there are absolutely no extras in this set.  The first season definitely had deleted scenes and it might have had some other stuff as well, but I don't remember exactly.  I enjoyed those deleted scenes in the first season and was looking forward to seeing them in the second season, but there are none.  This set has only the episodes and nothing else.  Every movie or TV show that I have bought in the past has had at least SOMETHING extra on it.  The price of this set needs something more than just the episodes.

My second complaint is the cheap packaging.  The set I bought (not from Amazon) had prongs broken off in all the cases.  In one case, all the prongs were broken off on both sides so the DVDs weren't held in place.  I plan to take it back and exchange it, but I'm not optimistic about getting one with all of them in place.  The ones that are still on are very small and just look like they want to pop off.  One positive thing about the packaging is that each case opens up with one DVD on the left and one DVD on the right.  Some sets of other shows/movies which I have purchased try to save space and put two DVDs on each side, on top of each other.  This is irritating because you have to remove the 2nd disk to get to the first one.  This set is not like this, thankfully.

My final complaint is this:  Advertising on the packaging is one thing, but they put the [...] on the title menu of the DVD!  That is totally unnecessary and ruins the menu, in my opinion.

So, great TV show, horrible packaging and content.  For a set that took two years to be released and costs this much, I would have expected more.",1199577600,23,2053,4.178571428571429

2992156,5,B000WTZ6SK,"It's about time!  seaQuest fans have been anxiously awaiting this release for over TWO YEARS!  Why Universal took so long to get this season out is a mystery to me. I've been ready to buy it since before season 1 came out.

As you may recall, the first season of seaQuest ended with the destruction of the supersubmarine, to save the world from what can arguably be called catastrophic global warming.  As the season begins, Captain Bridger is taking command of the new seaQuest. The bridge has been redesigned, as have several other parts of the boat, but the biggest difference in season 2 is the new crewmembers. Sadly, we lose the comical Krieg, the uptight Hitchcock, the country boy Crocker, and the cerebral but attractive Dr. Westphalen.  However, their loss is not so badly felt with the arrival of new crewmen - Lt. Brody, combat veteran. Dagwood, a failed prototype for a naturally camouflaged supersoldier. Henderson the attractive and young new techie with no experience. Dr. Wendy Smith, a telepathic (this was hinted at in season 1's ""Treasure of the Mind"") medical doctor and scientist (though not quite in Westphalen's league). And rounding out the Rogue's Gallery is Tony Piccolo, a wise-cracking ex-con on work-release aboard seaQuest, with the gills of a fish in his torso (""I'm a surfer. I thought they might come in handy."").

The second season has a somewhat different feel to it than the first, which was fairly science-only. This season, the show takes on a bit more of a sci-fi feel to it, but this is not a bad thing.

After the 2-hour season premiere of the Dagger (others like Dagwood) Revolt, the aliens seen in season 1's ""Such Great Patience"" arrive to a mixed reception. Later episodes in the season depict the possible discovery of the location of long-lost Atlantis, a renegade robot submarine programmed with Capt. Bridger's personality, and Star Wars fans are treated to two guest appearances by Luke Skywalker himself, Mark Hamill!  Kent McCord also returns 3 times this season, reprising his role as Space Commander Scott Keller.

The ending of this season, I don't want to give away in case newer fans haven't seen it, but I will say that Universal BETTER release season 3!

seaQuest was a great sci-fi series, far ahead of its time in the early 1990's. I have no doubt that these days, it would be going popular. I plan to spend many hours enjoying this season! :)",1192752000,44,2405,4.801452784503632

All jokes aside,this is a really great series, saddened by the passing of Johnothan Brandis, and bolstered by superlative acting performances from Roy Scheider, Michael Ironside,Don Franklyn, and a great array of series guest stars (let's face it, if you can get Charlton Heston, anything is possible) the special effects are, again, high above the mark, and the John Debney theme is the best fantasy TV theme since Goldsmith""s ""Star Trek"".

3226372,5,B000WTZ6SK,"I was a big SQDSV fan, when it came out on TV. It was different enough to be interesting and at that time, the EFX were state of the Art. The ship was a high tech wonder, and probably the star of the show. Roy Scheider was pretty good as the Captain Bridger.
I enjoyed Season 1 and had videotaped all the off air shows, but missed a lot of Season 2 due to a location change, so I ordered this set.
Sadly I didn't enjoy Season 2 as much, because it looked like (and turned out to be I was right) the writers were all different, and the producers
shifted the focus to add more sensational (aka Stupid) plot lines. It looked like some of the shows were lifted right out of the old TV show,
Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, by Irwin Allen. And now, of course, its then state of art Effects look dated, and video gamish.

3226456,1,B000WTZ6SK,"I've been revisiting Seaquest lately.  I just watched all the first season shows and I really enjoyed them, even 20 years later.  Great crew, decent stories, good show.  But once you get into second season, it is SO SO SO painfully bad.  I miss the crew that was taken off.  The new set tries a little too hard to look slick (like the new bridge-it's obviously just a bunch of flashing lights just for the purpose of having flashing lights).  But most of all the stories in this season were terrible. The only good thing I can say about this season is that, even though the stories are bad, it did get a little more into character development.  For example, Ortiz was like a whole new character in this season. He had much more screen time and personality in this season.  Same with Ford.  We got to meet Ford's family in this season.  Don Franklin is very good.  Of course, his family was then chased by a giant alligator. This is also the season that Lucas started getting second billing, right after the captain.  Seaquest is almost like 3 different series--first season is like Star Trek Next Generation.  Second season is like-well, TV hell.  Third season was good, but also very different from the other two seasons, more like a Deep Space Nine or Enterprise kind of seriousness.  Anyway, skip season 2 of seaquest.  They blew it.",1417910400,,1336,4.5738396624472575
3226457,5,B000WTZ6SK,"With one foot in the future and a little bit of sci-fi, Seaquest had some unusual stories. With good special effects, you were taken on a journey of discovery.

3226534,2,B000WTZ6SK,"If you look at the names involved, you have to wonder why the season so often flops around like a fish out of water. Rockne O'Bannon (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Farscape-Complete-Series-Blu-ray/dp/B00E688720/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Farscape: Complete Series [Blu-ray</a>]), Peter DeLuise (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stargate-SG-1-The-Complete-Series-Collection/dp/B000TJBNHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stargate SG-1: The Complete Series Collection</a>), and Steven Spielberg ($$) are credited with contributing to this season. Not even the charisma and talent of Roy Scheider could balance out the erratic, sometimes awful scripts handed to the other actors. Bad lines and questionable plots certainly contributed to the mediocrity of this season, but there is plenty of blame to go around.

The show couldn't decide what it was, and when pushing boundaries it often just went off a cliff.

The aliens in the episode ""The Fear That Follows"" shuffle around like distressed mimes, less convincing even than the spacemen from the film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Teenagers-from-Outer-Space/dp/B00004W1A5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Teenagers from Outer Space</a>&nbsp;(1959). This is followed by a prescient yet pedestrian episode that preaches about how computers (especially computer games) will become so important that people will stop relating to one another in the flesh.

Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker!) guest stars as a professor / alien hybrid (because that makes sense) in ""Dream Weaver,"" but the episode was so bad that I didn't even care about the fate of my once-favorite actor's character.

Oh, and while I have nothing against sea mammals, there is a talking dolphin onscreen far too often, which shatters any pretense of serious drama that SeaQuest might have been trying to pull off. Maybe this actually was a good show in 1994, but it certainly didn't age well.

Yet despite all this, there was usually something charming in each episode that kept me wanting to take a chance that the next episode would be worth my time. The acting is generally fine (aside from Dagwood's ""gentle giant"" persona being overplayed to the point of a 4-yr-old), and there is almost enough ""sci-fi"" in the season to keep aficionados engaged. The short little bits during the closing credits where SeaQuest actors take turns throwing some facts at you about sea animals is still a nice way to end each episode. Final verdict: Be willing to travel back to 1994 television, and Proceed at your own risk.",1374969600,,2627,6.051075268817204
3226535,3,B000WTZ6SK,"I wanted to like this series more.  while it is not ""lowbrow"" science fiction like Lost in Space, for example, Seaquest was dumbed down for low average intelligent viewers.  The result is a relatively slow moving show with simple plots.  The actors are solid and Roy Schieder particularly shines as Captain Bridger.  I wish the producers had believed more in the intelligence of their audience.  At the price charged by Amazon, it is worth purchasing and viewing if you are a die-hard science fiction fan.  The disks I received are single-sided, by the way.  One irony is that the newly introduced mentally-challenged character played by Peter DeLuise is more perceptive and better at solving problems than the officers of the crew!  It appears that the DeLuise brothers had a lot of fun acting this series.",1367107200,,807,4.925925925925926

3226565,5,B000WTZ6SK,"I must admit I first experienced Seaquest DSV on Netlix (am I allowed to say that here on Amazon?), but very quickly after just a couple of episodes realized that I wanted to buy this on DVD and add it to my collection. This is one of those series that is a hidden gem that somehow I missed when it was on back in the early 90's. If you are a fan of science fiction or even just a fan of Roy Schieder then you will enjoy this series.

I think I saw another reviewer say something like this is Star Trek under water and I have to say that's a really accurate description. There is a great deal of the human element involved in these episodes and there is a ecological undertone to many episodes as well expressed with an attitude of innocence that is rather charming.

Perhaps one other part of this series that struck a chord with me is what I would call the ""Galaxy Quest"" intro. I thought Galaxy Quest was a very good parody and now having seen the introduction to Seaqust DSV I know that they weren't just parodying Star Trek, but this series as well.

There is much to watch here and the efforts of many good people to watch as well. Stephen Speilberg, Roy Scheider and a great supporting case are a few that should be mentioned. It was even a pleasant surprise to see Dom DeLuise in one episode(and his sons in many others).

3226600,2,B000WTZ6SK,"I own both season 1 and 2 on dvd. Still waiting for Seaquest 2032 to be released.

Season 2.. I prefer season one over two for several reasons. First of all the characters that are in season one were better than season 2. There is no Hitchcock and her amazing eyes. This season were treated with psychic smith with big boobs, who walks around in the opener showing off her goods, but then as the season progresses it some how vanishes and she becomes almost uncomfortable in her role. The only eye candy in this season is LT. Henderson, and maybe a few shower scenes with smith. Henderson has a few good moments in several episodes where she's walkng around in tube tops, or tight jeans. I'm a guy and sex appeal is a must..

My biggest prob with season 2 is most of the characters are annoying and douchey. Wasn't a fan of brody, the general, or Ted Raimi(can't think of his seaquest name). Piccolo was annoying, but was the only cool smartass one on seaquest. Also didn't care for the daggers or some of the very strange missions this season went on over season one.

I would have preferred some on screen relationships. I mean they are on tour and on a sub and there isn't anything going on? They touched very lightly with raimi and henderson, and even bridger and smith, and lucas with his 24hr love interest. I mean come on, have something going on, instead of an hr long borefest about the mission at hand.

Lucas is cool but at times is over dramatic, but I noticed that in a few of his other roles in his other movies, he's always over dramatic. Cpt Bridger is ok too. Not much diff than the 1st season.

I was happy they did away with the DR ballard clip facts at the end of every episode. In this season each of the case give facts about sea life. Way better than ballard.

Most of the episodes were ok. There were some that were down right lame. Killer plants, killer aliens, the episode with brody's mom, the dagger episodes even with one where everybody things dagwood is a killer and the most irritating one is the one they get into a time travel thing underwater and they find out 2 kids are controlling robots in an empty town and their mother is a computer. Sincerest form of flattery where bridger faces bridger was my fav out of season 2.

With that said, season 2 wasn't as good as 1, but there were things in 2 that were better than one.

If you own season 1, pick up this one, its worth checking out. Hopefully some day they release the final season.",1293667200,,2472,4.3354978354978355
3226601,4,B000WTZ6SK,From Spielberg's heyday and yet he couldn't quite get any of his TV projects to gel like his movies did.  Someone should do a thesis on why these movie giants fail in the transition to the small screen so often...but I digress...the second season of Seaquest is just as entertaining as the first and still found no audience beyond the teeny-boppers (is that still a viable term?) who flocked around Jonathan Brandis and kept the whole sub afloat for a couple of seasons.  But all that aside I liked it then...I like it now.  Well produced (how could it not be) and family oriented it should have had smooth sailing but by the end of this second season was floundering on the rocks with well publicized 'creative' differences surfacing between Roy and the producers (including Mr. S.).  By the final season (which I would like to see released on DVD before I die) the whole direction and focus had changed and Scheider was gone and along with it the direction the whole series had begun with. The focus was more on action in the third.  This review is almost as convoluted as the series had become but reviewing the series almost forces that result.  Bottom line.  It's a classy show that should have done better and didn't but is still entertaining and worth watching.  This season lets Brandis move forward a bit and Scheider is a great moral center.  It also lets the crew begin to shine as we've become accustomed to their individual personalities by now and several stories focus on them to good effect.  If you're a Seaquest fan you won't be disappointed with Season Two.,1285200000,,1576,4.636690647482014

For example, on one episode in the final season, Lucas the teen genius actually announces that he's looking for a girlfriend, at the same time a certain cute young female crew member (I can't remember her name) seems to be practically begging for his attention! I mean, how ridiculous is that?

Come to think of it, the whole show was chock-full of hot females with very little to do other than say a few bad lines now and then -- if some of them would have had a few flings with the men or even just gotten naked occasionally, the show might have been much more successful!  ;-)",1269561600,,693,4.364341085271318

The first season was a bit more realistic but this season was fun.  I've always been a fan of Roy Scheider.  As well as a fan of Jonathan Brandis ever since I saw NESII.

Some of the only amusing characters are dumped and the entire Seaquest universe is changed from one of a semi-realistic future to complete fantasy.  It is like the series was pillaged for every scrap of originality and likability it had and was replaced with a sorry copy-of-a-copy template into which the characters and story were forcibly inserted.  Roy Scheider was correct to call the stories of season 2 ""childish trash"" and it's no wonder he abandoned this debacle of a series ""evolution"" after this season.  I never write reviews, but I was stunned that no one had given this only 1 star so I had to stand up.  The fact that the season starts the series in the ocean and ends it with Seaquest on some other planet fighting aliens that look like rejected dummies from a bad 1980's horror movie should be enough to convince you to steer clear if you still have any doubts.

3226629,4,B000WTZ6SK,"As an avid sci-fi fan, I very much liked this season. As a rabid seaQuest fan, I didn't.

Hard to explain to someone who has never seen the series. But I'll try.

I really loved the characters in season one, and their relationships with one another. But many didn't come back for a second season.

So instead of the in-your-face, powerful-when-needed screen presence of Dr. Kristin Westphalen, a believable love interest for the Captain, believable surrogate mother for Lucas, we get some mind-reading, less than steller character called Dr. Wendy Smith. I didn't like that the writers tried to involve her with Bridger - thankfully, it didn't work. And I didn't like that Westphalen's departure wasn't mentioned at all. (and neither were any of the other characters who departed) With the season one finale, and the character's growing releationship with Bridger, I expected to hear at least a small mention of her.

Also departing were Engineer Katie Hitchcock, Ben Krieg, and Chief Crocker. The studio wanted younger actors . . . . These characters and their histories were so well developed, I think this was a bad move on the studio's part.

They were replaced by talented actors, but, after caring about what happened to the characters from season 1, I was less interested in caring about a new set who may very well disappear in season 3. (which did happen . . . )

This season had far more of a sci-fi feel to it, which I would have loved (being a fan of ST:TNG, Star Wars, Earth 2 and so many others) had the first season not so fully hooked me into the believability of what could actually happen if man colonized the sea.

A fully telepathic doctor, a character with gills (not so believable, though I did like the character), a genetically engineered character, took the series in a complete other direction from the first season. It was so dramatic, I, like so many others, were turned off it during its first run.

The acting was still very good, but the direction of the stories to complete science fiction, did put me off a lot since I so very much enjoyed the first season.

And there were no extra features on season 2. At least season 1 had deleted scenes!

Now, I want it to round out my collection, same with season 3 if its ever released. Not my favorite, but still enjoyable to watch, nonetheless.",1208822400,2,2320,4.65036674816626
3226630,5,B000WTZ6SK,"This series is every bit as good as the rest of the reviewees say, but it had one very disappointing omission. The season two finale, where Seaquest takes a very, very long trip, is missing.  I do not know if this is because they wanted to combine it with season three, to give the final season more meat, or if they just decided not to include it for other reasons.  Regardless, it is a significant loss.

One other thought, and I encourage others to speculate on it.  Marco Sanchez returns in this season.  In the first season he played a squared-away, regulation haircut Navy rating always in a pressed uniform, and looking sharp.  This season, he has a bit more of a ruffian look, with long curly locks and a face that looks more unshaven that not. Which is okay since this is all fiction, anyway.  But the thing that made me blink is that I remember from watching the show on TV that Sanchez had the most outrageous and impractical 'do, especially for a military vessel, rather than the free-flowing locks sported in these disks.  So, did the producers change the footage to something much more believable, or is my tired mind remembering something that never was?  Comments appreciated.",1208131200,,1192,4.6380952380952385

Mostly environmental but there was alot of heart and commentary in the series, which is what sci-fi was supposed to be about.  And even more so the first season was indeed, fiction about science, hence the term Science Fiction!  Not the mindless eye candy we get now.  Yes there is some mindless eye candy episodes in this second season but they are still a joy to watch.  Only downbeat thing is that Roy and Brandis are no longer with us.  Steven Spielberg certainly did try and pour his best resources into it and really how often do we get a tv show spawned by Spielberg!

The show was obviously inspired by Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, and following that trend Spielberg put a top notch Hollywood actor Roy Scheider in the role, here the great one is in a TV show of all things!  Really unique television indeed.  This obstensibly ended the era of great producers, great leading cast, guest roles(Charleton Heston!) and very thought provoking stories.

3226650,3,B000WTZ6SK,"Seaquest is a great show, and I'm not debating that. Other reviewers have pointed out the good points of the show and I heartily agree with them.  My three star rating has less to do with the show and more to do with the actual production of the DVD.  First of all, it took FOREVER to be released.  That fact, while annoying, was not a factor in the lower star rating.  Some good things take a while.

My complaint is that there are absolutely no extras in this set.  The first season definitely had deleted scenes and it might have had some other stuff as well, but I don't remember exactly.  I enjoyed those deleted scenes in the first season and was looking forward to seeing them in the second season, but there are none.  This set has only the episodes and nothing else.  Every movie or TV show that I have bought in the past has had at least SOMETHING extra on it.  The price of this set needs something more than just the episodes.

My second complaint is the cheap packaging.  The set I bought (not from Amazon) had prongs broken off in all the cases.  In one case, all the prongs were broken off on both sides so the DVDs weren't held in place.  I plan to take it back and exchange it, but I'm not optimistic about getting one with all of them in place.  The ones that are still on are very small and just look like they want to pop off.  One positive thing about the packaging is that each case opens up with one DVD on the left and one DVD on the right.  Some sets of other shows/movies which I have purchased try to save space and put two DVDs on each side, on top of each other.  This is irritating because you have to remove the 2nd disk to get to the first one.  This set is not like this, thankfully.

My final complaint is this:  Advertising on the packaging is one thing, but they put the [...] on the title menu of the DVD!  That is totally unnecessary and ruins the menu, in my opinion.

So, great TV show, horrible packaging and content.  For a set that took two years to be released and costs this much, I would have expected more.",1199577600,23,2053,4.178571428571429

3226653,5,B000WTZ6SK,"It's about time!  seaQuest fans have been anxiously awaiting this release for over TWO YEARS!  Why Universal took so long to get this season out is a mystery to me. I've been ready to buy it since before season 1 came out.

As you may recall, the first season of seaQuest ended with the destruction of the supersubmarine, to save the world from what can arguably be called catastrophic global warming.  As the season begins, Captain Bridger is taking command of the new seaQuest. The bridge has been redesigned, as have several other parts of the boat, but the biggest difference in season 2 is the new crewmembers. Sadly, we lose the comical Krieg, the uptight Hitchcock, the country boy Crocker, and the cerebral but attractive Dr. Westphalen.  However, their loss is not so badly felt with the arrival of new crewmen - Lt. Brody, combat veteran. Dagwood, a failed prototype for a naturally camouflaged supersoldier. Henderson the attractive and young new techie with no experience. Dr. Wendy Smith, a telepathic (this was hinted at in season 1's ""Treasure of the Mind"") medical doctor and scientist (though not quite in Westphalen's league). And rounding out the Rogue's Gallery is Tony Piccolo, a wise-cracking ex-con on work-release aboard seaQuest, with the gills of a fish in his torso (""I'm a surfer. I thought they might come in handy."").

The second season has a somewhat different feel to it than the first, which was fairly science-only. This season, the show takes on a bit more of a sci-fi feel to it, but this is not a bad thing.

After the 2-hour season premiere of the Dagger (others like Dagwood) Revolt, the aliens seen in season 1's ""Such Great Patience"" arrive to a mixed reception. Later episodes in the season depict the possible discovery of the location of long-lost Atlantis, a renegade robot submarine programmed with Capt. Bridger's personality, and Star Wars fans are treated to two guest appearances by Luke Skywalker himself, Mark Hamill!  Kent McCord also returns 3 times this season, reprising his role as Space Commander Scott Keller.

The ending of this season, I don't want to give away in case newer fans haven't seen it, but I will say that Universal BETTER release season 3!

seaQuest was a great sci-fi series, far ahead of its time in the early 1990's. I have no doubt that these days, it would be going popular. I plan to spend many hours enjoying this season! :)",1192752000,44,2405,4.801452784503632
