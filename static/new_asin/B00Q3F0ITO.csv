6853689,5,B00Q3F0ITO,The movie has lost none of its poignancy after all these years.  Still a winner.,1455148800,3,80,4.333333333333333

6853691,5,B00Q3F0ITO,i bought this for a friend and watched it just one more time before i gave it to him. After the tenth time of watching this since i saw it in the theater i am still in tears over the drama and the panoramic beauty of the Western Prairie. This movie spurred my interest at reenacting frontier history and after learning the real facts i still enjoy this movie. When watching this movie i think this actually happened but there is no documented evidence it really did happen in this way. That is still another reason this story is so good.,1446508800,4,537,4.326732673267327

6853697,2,B00Q3F0ITO,"Why would they re-cut a movie that won seven Oscars, including Best Film Editing?  Seriously, the pacing of this nearly 4-hour re-cut version is almost unwatchable.  The pacing feels dead, with the added scenes, while well-acted or well-shot, slow down the movie to a crawl.  The theatrical version was three hours long anyway.  This is the extended version, not the original theatrical version that so many fell in love with.  The only bonus to getting this particular copy on bluray is that the cinematography looks amazing!  What a shame.",1481500800,4,541,5.022471910112359

6853702,1,B00Q3F0ITO,"Don't be fooled people, this is the awful 25th Anniversary version of the movie that destroys the story. The ad is misleading, I purchased this version and threw it away twice, looking for the theatrical version on Blu-ray. Need any additional proof that the 25th anniversary version is garbage? look at the price, they are giving this awful version away for $5 where the ad admits it is this same awful version.

I am still looking for the theatrical version on Blu-ray.",1463529600,4,471,4.7439024390243905

8690157,1,B00Q3F0ITO,I am giving a 1 star not becuase of the movie but because this version has none of the special features the 20th annaversry does. Not only that but amazon is charging 5 doallrs more for this edition then that one. Please do yourself a favor and get the 2 disc 20th its cheaper and has alot more then this lackluster one disc version has.,1531612800,,337,4.2
8690158,1,B00Q3F0ITO,Blue ray o dances with wolves does not work on my blu ray due to something about different bands mines b movies are a band so stuck with two movies of the same movie I can't watch but I.ve paid for,1531180800,,197,3.8292682926829267
