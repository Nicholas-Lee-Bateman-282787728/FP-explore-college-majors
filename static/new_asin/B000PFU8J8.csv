I have viewed it and consider it to be the next best thing to seeing her in a seminar.  I show dogs and breed occasionally, this is a valuable tool for any breeder who wants to breed better dogs! I believe every conscientious breeder should have this and other of her products for their learning. Her book, Dogsteps, as well as the videos of her seminars are very valuable to help us understand guod dogs' build and movement.  Thank you,  Ree",1337385600,,546,4.323529411764706
