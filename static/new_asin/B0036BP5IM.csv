4075798,5,B0036BP5IM,"In this wonderfully directed, written and acted drama, we learn that justice for the accused of crimes was a ""hit or miss"" thing in England in the 1700s.  Depending on the ""Station in life"" that one was born in or held could determine the outcome of a trial whether you were guilty or not. Darrow (played greatly by Andrew Buchan) and his advisor/barrister, John Southouse (played wonderfully by Alun Armstrong of the 1980's Broadway stage play ""Nicholas Nickleby"") were determined to see ""that justice was done"" taking on some nasty cases and defending some rather looked ""down upon"" by the English judicial system of the day individuals  and  some who were not very likely to receive justice from the court.

In this two-disc set with four episodes running about an hour each episode, the audience gets to see the makings of a the very determined ""justice for all"" Barrister  Darrow  with, of course, his frustrations, battles, love and failures.  This ""period drama"" gives the audience a splendid idea of the English ""court system""  in the 1700s and the workings thereof so very well.  (One really had a very slim chance of receiving any justice until Darrow sought to change ""things"") This series is so very great--as I said before the direction and acting are wonderful. Plus the recreations of the era along with its costumes are marvelous.  I do hope this is the first of many seasons; I certainly plan on purchasing any future seasons as they become available.",1299456000,5,1468,4.859437751004016
4075799,5,B0036BP5IM,"I will disagree with a previous reviewer - Garrow is no Rumpole.  I think what made the ""Rumpole of the Bailey"" series so interesting is the subtle humor and imperfections of the Barrister.  Leo McKern took a literary personality and played it to such perfection that he made his characterization ""definitive.""  Yes...I love the Rumpole series.

So for those interested in British law - this is my second choice for a mini-series.  Don't get me wrong - it is very well done - although Garrow comes off a little too flawless.  He is smart, young, roguishly attractive...and a bit too arrogant and superior at times.  His desire for justice in a court of law - fundamental fairness, if you will - is palpable.

In terms of acting, I actually preferred his solicitor - John Southouse - played superbly by Alun Armstrung who tries to restrain his young charge from becoming a raving revolutionary. I also enjoyed Magistrate Buller played in a sinister tone by Michael Culkin.

The costumes, sets, and historical detail are outstanding...and the stories excellent. I understand these are real cases tried in the Old Bailey - the original Criminal Courts of London.  I rather liked the first episode best when Garrow tries his first case, and makes the kind of mistake most lawyers do in the beginning - get so wrapped up in their own brilliance they forget that their single duty is to persuade the jury or judge of the rightness of their client.

What makes the series most compelling for me is that it shows the extremely difficult job of defending an accused in criminal court during the eighteenth century when the defense attorney was so handicapped.  The defense lawyer was not allowed to call his own witnesses...he was not allowed to look directly at the jury...he was not allowed to make a ""closing argument"" in the case. No, it is the Judge who makes the closing argument and he can and will emphasize the facts which he wants the jury to consider most. Basically, Sir William Garrow has to do the whole show by cross-examining the prosecution's witnesses and showing the flaws in their testimony. How this exceptionally good lawyer overcomes these handicaps stirs the passions and the mind.

So taken as a whole, I have no difficulty giving ""Garrow's Law"" 5 stars. Series II has a valuable ""extra"" which is a 20 minute biography of the real William Garrow - the lawyer who first introduced the idea that a man is presumed innocent until proven guilty.  We take that principle for granted.  But this uncommonly principled man fought enemies in court to make this law.  He also introduced new ideas about proper evidence, such as the unreliability of ""hearsay"" - second hand gossip.  This BBC series  will attract law students, professors, and all those interested in an intelligent treat.",1299283200,19,2793,4.831932773109243
4075800,5,B0036BP5IM,"This is one of the best series I have seen.  For me it rates in my top 6. Downton Abby, Pride and Prejudice, Berkeley Square, Cranford and Candleford to Larkrise. The acting is superb, costumes beautifully done and the plot is taken from real life (actual cases).  It captures life in the courts of England with the rich and the poor. Absolutely splendid!  Why can't Hollywood make something half as good????",1298764800,6,408,4.71830985915493
4075801,5,B0036BP5IM,"Garrow's Law (Series One) introduces us to young William Garrow, an inexperienced barrister who gets his first chance to practice his profession at the Old Bailey Law Court in London.  He makes many mistakes and as a result his first client is hanged for a crime he did not commit.  Garrow quickly determines that justice and the English law as practiced at the Old Bailey often may not be on speaking terms.  After the first disastrous case Garrow learns quickly and we watch with satisfaction as he defends clients who would probably have been convicted and hanged if it were not for his skilled defense.  In the last case, and one of best in the four televised programs, Garrow defends a man falsely accused of treason; his punishment, if convicted, would be to be hanged, taken down from the gallows while still alive, and eviscerated before his very eyes - hanged, drawn, and quartered. We watch with rapt attention as Garrow makes his summation and appeal to the jury and then hold our breaths as we wait for the verdict.

Much time and effort has gone into the production of this series.  The sets and constumes are meticulously created to take the viewer back to the late 18th Century in London.  The stories are genuinely entertaining and the writing is crisp and realistic.  Lastly, the acting of all the players, particularly Garrow, is first rate.  It was only by fortunate accident that I learned of this series and then checked the two glowing reviews on Amazon.  I add this short review to the list and highly recommend this series to any interested viewers who want to step back in time and watch as William Garrow brings a measure of fairness and justice into the English legal system.",1297900800,32,1702,4.700336700336701
4075802,5,B0036BP5IM,"this wonderful and moving testament to the struggle of human rights and the importance of the individual is bringing the historical into the present time. we are so thankful that so many gifted people were able to produce this drama. I would recommend very highly. we need to understand the past better so that we do appreciate the long, long road that so many have traveled. Justice is the concern of each person and not to be taken lightly or for granted.",1297209600,20,457,4.585365853658536
4075803,5,B0036BP5IM,"I can't really add any more to the quality of this series, but I can add that it is the UK version of the First Series in the hope that it is helpful to others.",1292976000,2,160,3.6
4075804,5,B0036BP5IM,"Historical drama done to the excellence level of ""Foyle's War."" British courtroom drama from 1792. The date given away by dialogue about Pres. Washington's new 2nd term. This series has already won a ""Best History"" award. It should win more award in the future. It is absolute perfection in late-18th century historical reproduction in sets, costumes, dialogue, and the plots, cases, and people are from real British history of criminal court--""The Old Bailey."" Rumpole of the Bailey made this court popular on TV, but this series now documents the true historical beginning of criminal justice for the accused. It was Sir William Garrow (1760-1840) who lead the way and coined: ""Innocent until proven guilty."" He was accepted to the bar in 1783. In real life, and the TV series, he is idealistic, a Robin Hood for the poor and unfairly arrested. He is young, eager, wayward, belligerent, rash, arrogant, inexperienced, loud, but often a winner. This set resembles the poor depicted in Catherine Cookson TV adaptations--a must own series as well.

Excellent cast:
Andrew Buchan (Cranford) is Garrow, in looks and attitude. He could be played no better.
Lyndsey Marshall (Being Human) plays Lady Sarah Hill, exquisite in acting as well as filling her delightful period aristocracy costumes.
Alun Armstrong (Little Dorrit, New Tricks) plays the true-to-history character, John Southouse, Garrow's mentor, a solicitor (attorney).
Michael Culkin (The Hours, Lolita) is Judge Buller, mostly ruthless.
Rupert Graves (Forsyte Sage, Death at a Funeral-see the UK version) plays MP Sir Arthur, Sarah's spouse.
Aidan McArdle (The Duchess, Ella Enchanted) is another REAL historical figure, John Silvester, a proud, rich, barrister who constantly opposes Garrow.

Costumes (1200+) are astounding, sumptuous, and accurate. Edinburgh, Dumbarton, and Glasgow were filming sites. Music is as fine as the interior sets. The writing is the masterpiece behind the plots and stories taken from historical research of The Bailey cases of the time. The dynamic dialogue even offers periodic comedy. This is more like a historical documentary than TV drama, but the presentation is suspenseful, dramatic, and as finely done as anything on today's TV schedule. Not just 5 stars, but PLATNUM STARS.

4 episodes each an hour, so when a feature-length typically costs $20, this near 3-feature-length set is a value.
1: Garrow struggles in his 1st case but attracts the eye of lady Sarah. Next a life or death defense of a servant girl accused of murder of her new born.
2. Garrow reluctantly defends `The Monster', a female assulter. Resultantly he looses popularity--but not with Lady Sarah. Will new evidence be allowed in time?
3. Garrow's defense of a man charged with raping his maid puts him in Sarah's disfavor. Even his mentor questions some of Garrow's other personal & court reckless behavior. What can Garrow do for a lace thief pair?
4. Garrow takes a murdering prostitute case followed by one of treason. Lady Sarah gets involved & pregnant. There are implications related to her husband, MP Sir Arthur.

I'm running out of superlatives for this series. Glad there was a BBC 2010 series that aired after this 2009 set. We'll have to pray for more in 2011 and beyond. While you wait for ""Garrow's Law: Series 2"" try ""Rumpole of the Bailey""-see my review.",1292371200,72,3433,5.178378378378379

4075816,5,B0036BP5IM,"Superbly done historic series about the great British lawyer, William Garrow, at the Old Bailey, and his role in the developing of criminal trial law.  Just loved it.  As so often with these British series, the actors and actresses were perfect, and I fell in love with Alun Armstrong as John Southouse before the third season finished. Also fell in love with Michael Culkin as Judge Buller. Rupert Graves made for a pathetically human yet somehow charming  villain. Lyndsey Marshal gave a very credible performance as an intelligent woman wrestling with matters of honesty, honor and the love of her child.  Aiden McArdle was just marvelous as the prosecuting attorney so often pitted against Garrow.  And Andrew Buchan was very sympathetic and convincing as the lead.  The writing was superb.  I only discovered this series a week or two ago, and I am so sad that it was not continued.  If only it could be revived...  I thought it captured the spirit and ambience of the 18th century (and potentially the early 19th century) beautifully.  Highly recommended, not only for those who adore British historical drama but for all those with a special interest in the law.  ---- It inspired me to order a biography of William Garrow immediately.",1439683200,4,1242,4.894736842105263

The United Kingdom seems to have in reality, a company of traveling actors that are used again and again in movies and television drama.  And that's not a bad thing.  They are a versatile lot and their competency in the art of acting is very impressive.  (i was able to recognize several actors from previous well-known movie roles.)  The late 18th century London setting is interesting as you would expect coming from England.

This is a series that I am watching for a third time and am still captivated by this wonderfully portrayed production.

4075832,5,B0036BP5IM,"This is a series that is very interesting, especially from a legal history point of view.  It is based on actual court cases that took place at the Old Bailey and featured William Garrow, a barrister who reformed the legal system in England from within.  His improvements have had lasting impacts on the legal systems of all the countries that are based on the Common Law.  Garrow is very well portrayed and so are all the cast members in this series.  There are four episodes in this first season and they show the development of Garrow, who wished to aid the poor criminal defendants, who were often framed, or simply not guilty but had no recourse under the law.  He developed the notion of cross-examination, interviewing the defendants personally, and knowing how to appeal to the jury's sensibilities.  In short, he really promoted the adversarial legal system that we have today.  In the beginning, his motives are pure, but as his fame increases, it does go to his head some and he develops some ruthless tactics.  Some of which are reminiscent of the famous defense lawyers of today.  The love story in this series, while historically accurate, isn't the one that most draws in the viewer.  As he falls for a married Lady, and while her husband isn't as glamorous as Garrow, he doesn't appear to treat her badly.  So it is hard to sympathize with them.  However, the cases are very interesting.  And the banter back and forth between Garrow and the Prosecutor is comical at times.",1411257600,,1489,4.724806201550388

4075842,5,B0036BP5IM,"A most compelling historical drama based on the work of William Garrow who was instrumental in the development of the adversarial system found in Common Law.

 In Georgian England following the advent of the American Revolution, the aristocracy seeks to preserve its rights, primarily by enforcing property laws. Caught up in litigation are those who are poor, indigent, in service or from the 'lower' social orders. At the same time the system of enclosure was taking place, in which peasants were forced off common arable land by the upper classes thus creating a landless working class which was fodder for the industrial revolution.

Enter our hero and his mentor, who disturbed by the moral injustices they are witnessing fight the good fight in the courts of law. Garrow himself, the son of a much despised school master, is outside the system himself--well educated [though he lost his opportunity to be at Oxford] and brilliant but as one of his adversaries says, no gentleman. They are joined by the most ethical Lady Sarah, who will find her high mindedness brings her a great deal of trouble with her corrupt husband.

As other reviewers have pointed out, the episodes are based on actual cases and are fascinating in themselves as we see the development of the system of law most of us take for granted, though we should not. The socioeconomic/ class aspects and the tragedies of the individuals caught up in the times  are just as moving and make for high drama. Not to be missed. If you enjoyed this series, I recommend London Hospital, another wonderful British program about the development of modern medicine.",1395014400,,1626,4.91970802919708

He was largely responsible for establishing the adversarial court system we use today, and for the development of a useful defense advocate when one was accused of a crime. Previous to him the accused was severely hampered in how the were allowed to present their defense. If you were accused you were pretty much found guilty unless the evidence of your innocence was overwhelming, such as a high placed nobleman provided you with an alibi. He coined the term innocent until proven guilty. The cases in the series are taken from actual court cases heard at London's old Bailey during the latter part of the 18th century.

The creators have chosen important examples of actual cases that reflect the social challenges of the time including the plight of the women and disregard for the value of human life.

4075888,5,B0036BP5IM,"It is so sad that we have only 12 episodes spread across the three seasons of Garrows Law. Whilst this box set is to be welcomed it is also a matter of regret that the perverse decision was made to axe this very successful programme. What is particularly fascinating is that Sir William Garrow was a real historical figure. The writers of these programmes have clearly made a real effort to ensure that the episodes accord with what is known of his personal life. Additionally every episode is based on a true case from the annals of the Old Bailey in London, although not necessarily one with which Garrow was involved. Hence they provide an insight into the workings of the law a little over two hundred years ago.

Garrow is not as widely known as he deserves. Whilst this series covers the earlier part of his career when he was a barrister, he was also a Kings Counsel prosecuting cases, although he appears here as the defending counsel. Latterly he became an English politician, rising to the post of Solicitor General and confirmed his forward thinking by, amongst other credentials, supporting animal rights which was quite a departure in the first part of the 19th century. This was a time when human rights were fairly generally ignored! The cases which are included in this series are interesting and varied and if you google the details of any of them, you will be able to verify that they were actual cases at the Old Bailey. Here Garrow is the champion of the accused and it is an interesting fact that he originated the phrase 'innocent until proved guilty'. He is also credited with originating the adversarial system of justice, in use in most Western countries with forthright cross examination of witnesses.

Garrow's rather complicated personal life is also based on what happened in real life. He had a long term relationship and later married Sarah, who had previously had a relationship with a Viscount. The script writer has had to fill in the gaps, however, the significant facts which can be checked out are correct. Hence this series portrays both the working life and personal life of a highly significant historical figure in an authentic manner. Andrew Buchan puts in an impressive performance in the leading role, but mention should also be made of Alun Armstrong who is very convincing as John Southouse.

It was always a valid criticism of Garrows Law that the seasons were so short, comprising just four episodes in each. Therefore this DVD set contains just 12 episodes, four from each of the three series. Brief though it is, it provides a fascinating insight into the workings of the justice system in the UK in the early 19th Century, with the added interest that it is largely based on fact.",1352592000,,2731,4.757383966244726

It is absolutely amazing to see the impact one man can have on history. Garrow was divinely inspired and immensely bold. What better topic around which to weave a series? The cases are interesting.

4075893,5,B0036BP5IM,"This is based on a true story and it is very realistic to the period of history it depicts. the late 1700's.  They hung you for just about most crimes. most people were poor and disease was rampant. Sex was not hidden among most of the people; just in the upper class. Torture at least was not being used anymore. And compared to just a century before; the law system was much impooved. But not by later standards. Life then was so brutal and cheap that the hangman was alway busy. This is a fine show about this previctorian period and it's a looser time than later in the uk for sure. Garrow helped to change the way law was done and this show is a great example of that. IT's not cleaned up though , although when a mob stones a man you don't see the rocks hit him.  The prudes never complain about violence just a few boobs so what does that tell  you?  Watch this excellent show the acting is very good too. The picture quality is perfect but a blu ray would have been better. there is a few extras on this one. The true story of Garrow in words and filmographies.",1339804800,,1069,4.174757281553398

4075912,5,B0036BP5IM,"Historical drama done to the excellence level of ""Foyle's War."" British courtroom drama from 1792. The date given away by dialogue about Pres. Washington's new 2nd term. This series has already won a ""Best History"" award. It should win more award in the future. It is absolute perfection in late-18th century historical reproduction in sets, costumes, dialogue, and the plots, cases, and people are from real British history of criminal court--""The Old Bailey."" Rumpole of the Bailey made this court popular on TV, but this series now documents the true historical beginning of criminal justice for the accused. It was Sir William Garrow (1760-1840) who lead the way and coined: ""Innocent until proven guilty."" He was accepted to the bar in 1783. In real life, and the TV series, he is idealistic, a Robin Hood for the poor and unfairly arrested. He is young, eager, wayward, belligerent, rash, arrogant, inexperienced, loud, but often a winner. This set resembles the poor depicted in Catherine Cookson TV adaptations--a must own series as well.

Excellent cast:
Andrew Buchan (Cranford) is Garrow, in looks and attitude. He could be played no better.
Lyndsey Marshall (Being Human) plays Lady Sarah Hill, exquisite in acting as well as filling her delightful period aristocracy costumes.
Alun Armstrong (Little Dorrit, New Tricks) plays the true-to-history character, John Southouse, Garrow's mentor, a solicitor (attorney).
Michael Culkin (The Hours, Lolita) is Judge Buller, mostly ruthless.
Rupert Graves (Forsyte Sage, Death at a Funeral-see the UK version) plays MP Sir Arthur, Sarah's spouse.
Aidan McArdle (The Duchess, Ella Enchanted) is another REAL historical figure, John Silvester, a proud, rich, barrister who constantly opposes Garrow.

Costumes (1200+) are astounding, sumptuous, and accurate. Edinburgh, Dumbarton, and Glasgow were filming sites. Music is as fine as the interior sets. The writing is the masterpiece behind the plots and stories taken from historical research of The Bailey cases of the time. The dynamic dialogue even offers periodic comedy. This is more like a historical documentary than TV drama, but the presentation is suspenseful, dramatic, and as finely done as anything on today's TV schedule. Not just 5 stars, but PLATNUM STARS.

4 episodes each an hour, so when a feature-length typically costs $20, this near 3-feature-length set is a value.
1: Garrow struggles in his 1st case but attracts the eye of lady Sarah. Next a life or death defense of a servant girl accused of murder of her new born.
2. Garrow reluctantly defends `The Monster', a female assulter. Resultantly he looses popularity--but not with Lady Sarah. Will new evidence be allowed in time?
3. Garrow's defense of a man charged with raping his maid puts him in Sarah's disfavor. Even his mentor questions some of Garrow's other personal & court reckless behavior. What can Garrow do for a lace thief pair?
4. Garrow takes a murdering prostitute case followed by one of treason. Lady Sarah gets involved & pregnant. There are implications related to her husband, MP Sir Arthur.

Although it seems a little 'over the top' to our modern standards, it is still a rich review of how much conflict was caused in an effort to balance Prosecuting and Defense attorney perspectives. Whether judges had such heavy handed places in court is most likely true, as is the role/function that the Parliament played in persuading the outcome of topical issues/events that politically swayed in their personal favor. The romance portion of the story seemed to have been created to show how feminism has its place as far back as the 19th century court system.
