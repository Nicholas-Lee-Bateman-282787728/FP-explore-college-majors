6754825,5,B00OK3ZXZ0,Very interesting show. It's in between decent and okay. I would recommend it for guys who are into older animation and quality. And monsters/rape lovers.,1437264000,4,153,5.16

6754828,1,B00OK3ZXZ0,"I had hopes for this one, but again the devolving into beautiful girls being raped by a troll, slimy creature of the black lagoon types and of course don't leave out the tentacles attempting to probe all holes. This could have been a really fun romp if done without beautiful little magic woman M being done in time and time again by creatures. It's too bad the writers and animators are so screwed up and perverted that they think this kind of action is fun to watch.",1423958400,10,468,4.390804597701149
6754829,3,B00OK3ZXZ0,"Some monster hentai are like cough syrup: despite the fact you use it for a clear and explainable reason, you can't help but wonder why anyone would want to indulge in such an object of terrible taste. Magic Woman M is such a hentai: while it serves its purpose in being unique and even a little kinky in some parts, you can't help but wonder why anyone would want to drink-in its tastelessness. Okay, maybe watching monster/tentacle hentai and crippling each one with my critical thinking has finally worn off on me, but I'm not kidding when I say that MWM is one of the most repugnant hentai anime I've seen and this is coming from someone who survived `The Head-Scene' in Battle Can-Can (simply by laughing my butt off at its badly drawn improbability).

Magic Woman M (short for Mereru) is a sort of anime version of the manga Spunky Knight where a blonde adventurer runs around a generic Western fantasy world as seen from severely tormented Eastern eyes. She encounters dangerously dirty minded monsters, getting her life haunted by empty threats of death that never ever happen and then slaughtering any inhuman male that has his way with her. The biggest differences between the two are the title character, who is an asexual sorceress with reasonably sized cleavage and unlike Spunky Knight, Magic Woman M doesn't have a sole, likable, charming, female character that dies in the end for no excusable reason. Now that I mention it though, MWM barely has any likable or significant characters as everyone is either a one dimensional extra with a name (who inevitably survive death simply because they have a name), a downright evil murderer or a hero who proves competent until they decide to gleefully R-O in front of a rape they intended to stop. Yes, I'm serious.

Worse yet is the obnoxious sidekick character placed for comic relief. Someone once said that comic relief characters reflect what their creator finds funny and if that's true in MWM's case (and Spunky Knight's for that matter), then the author of this OAV needs to be sectioned. NOW. Honestly, three-fingered dwarf ninjas I can tolerate. A fat talking cat I can tolerate. Even a floating, cheerful little bald gray man who lets his dinky junk hang out I can tolerate. But a Super Deformed old man observing his student the entire movie who pops in during dire times to throw snarky, witty comments and sarcastic encouragement past the fourth wall?? I think the hero and heroine of every anime bishojou I've watched have finally been erased from my long list of anime character's I'd love to murder. SLOWLY. I think this guy and Onimaro from Twin Dolls/Angels are perfect reasons why the clichs of tentacle/monster hentai should never EVER continue.

I am getting ahead of myself, though. The sexual activities in this title really aren't bad, especially not in the second part where tentacles and mermen get involved for appropriately long scenes, but no matter what, each scene is derived from the common tasteless drudgery of monster/tentacle hentai. The sex is always fueled by the presumptuously uncomfortable threat of hurting or killing the female partner; I swear, Japanese authors have something against impregnation because the moment something tries to plant manseed, all of a sudden it means someone's going to die. Why??

To be perfectly fair, most of the scenes usually stay within the boundaries of the empty threats where the male monster has his way then ends up dying instead of the female human, but the cop-out discomfort of the hentai clich strikes early on when a blood-play/cherry-popping scene gets downright repulsive. Ordinarily, I'd just brush the scene off thinking, ""Eh, I guess they had to throw something bad in and if that's as far as it goes, fine. Not like it's a factual error or anything."" However, it was actually harder for me to ignore this time because the event was so in-your-face it was almost like the animators didn't even want this to be a hentai, making the episode feel a bit inconsistent.

I actually thought it was amusing that the title magician Mereru Sheckle resembled video game magician Etla both in costume and in the fact that she's absolutely terrible at what she does; worse in fact because Mereru wields magic that takes hours to work. There was a scene in episode One where she summoned a spell using her magic wand, but it never worked until someone else was in danger. In the next episode, she casts a spell knowing she lost her wand and the spell still didn't work, yet she quickly blamed the lack of her wand and ignored the the fact that the spell immediately backfired on her. Almost every bearded male character in the two episodes say her body has something to do with it and if that's the case, I think Mereru's mentor gave her defective magic on purpose just to watch her get tormented. One aspect about the flick I don't get is in the second episode's end we finally see the character's goal... what the Hell?! Did we suddenly step into the Lady Hawke set?! What is this, an alternate Earth all of a sudden??

I think the only character I could sympathize with was Freni, the blue haired spell caster in the second episode. After hearing the stupidest/derivative monster conception summary since Humanoids from the Deep, she and I immediately said ""You've gotta be kidding!"" Freni, baby, I don't buy it either.
As for you dear reader, I don't know if you should buy this title or not. The animation is certainly passable, though you'll run into continuity errors and blatant, lazily re-used shots so often it becomes an eye-sore at times. You might like the pornographic animated fantasy theme aspect about this title; I know I did at first and I still like the concept, but you might be better off coming up with your own fantasy-theme sexual-fantasy. That way you could save your money, add in whatever you want and wouldn't have to worry about clichs, B.S. or annoying comic relief characters.",1244937600,7,5944,4.7998046875
