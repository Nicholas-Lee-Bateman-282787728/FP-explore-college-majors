8058526,4,B00099YD46,"Though filmmaker Irwin Allen will forever be remembered as the ""master of disaster"" because of his production of ""The Poseidon Adventure"" and ""The Towering Inferno,"" respectively, he was also responsible for four sci-fi adventures from the 60's that have long had cult followings.  With the success of the ""Lost in Space"" box sets, Fox is preparing to release ""Voyage,"" along with Allen's other fantasy, ""The Time Tunnel"".

""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"" started out as a serious drama, laced with political intrigue and occasional forays into the absurd.

The two episodes on this tape are related in that both are stories that have doomsday scenarios.  The first installment, ""The Price of Doom,"" features one of the few times that the first season of the show dealt with a ""monster-of-the-week"" format, something that, unfortunately, would repeatedly pop up in the series' third and fourth seasons.  Although the monster plankton is good for a smirk or two, the episode is helped by good performances from the Richard Basehart (""Admiral Nelson"") and David Hedison (""Captain Crane""), along with guest stars David Opatoshu and Jill Ireland.  In fact, this was one of the few times when all the main characters, along with secondary ones, like ""Chip Morton"" (Bob Dowdell),""Kowalski"" (Del Monroe), ""Patterson"" (Paul Trinka), ""Chief Curley Jones"" (Henry Kulky), and even communications chief ""Sparks"" (Arch Whiting) have significant screen time.

Also, the episode has a ""Trek"" connection in that Opatoshu, Ireland (the future Mrs. Charles Bronson), and Steve Ihnat would each guest star on an episode of Roddenberry's classic.

And, thirdly, the episode was penned by sci-fi legend Harlan Ellison, under the pen name of ""Cordwainer Bird"".

The second episode, ""The Peacemaker,"" features future movie auteur John Cassavetes as a man with his finger on the button of a explosive that could bring about the end of mankind.  Cassevetes is outstanding and the tension is high in this one from the show's second, and the first filmed in color, season.

Whit Bissell, a stalwart performer in many genre films, appears as ""Admiral Conners"".  He would later be among the cast of ""The Time Tunnel.""",1136764800,,2190,5.190340909090909
