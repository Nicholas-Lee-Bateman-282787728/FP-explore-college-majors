8002769,5,B0000TG4AQ,"Typical anime, but good enough for a first time anime watcher, or a seasoned weeaboo. The story is simple and, at times, heart wrenching. The voice actors did very well for the English dub and kept the humor alive through the translation. It does benefit from knowledge of Japanese culture, but does not require it. I was this series from start to finish every year or so.",1266624000,,372,4.567164179104478
8002770,2,B0000TG4AQ,"Though having a few good bits in it for the girls, this series was terrible. Don't bother buying it. It doesn't go anywhere.",1116720000,2,124,4.434782608695652
8002771,4,B0000TG4AQ,"...then you'll like the second one.  It's pretty much that simple.
The second volume of ""Someday's Dreamers"" doesn't really mess with the show's formula, and that should be just fine with fans of the series.  The cuteness is still out in force, as are the relatively episodic plot lines.  However, in the last episode or two here we meet a young man named Inoue, who sees himself as unable to do anything right, including magic.  It is he who plants the first seeds of true self-doubt in Yume's heart, and that line of the story will power the last several episodes of the series.
Although I feel like I ought to post something longer, the review here can be summed up as:  If you enjoyed the first disc, you'll find more of the same here.  If you didn't, well...you'll find more of the same here.
