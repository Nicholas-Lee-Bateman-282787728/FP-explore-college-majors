7986120,3,B00008OM8L,"I'm so to say not the best pack of movies each has there own kind of story there are one our two that are good,but it's just A toss up.",1380326400,,135,3.533333333333333
7986121,3,B00008OM8L,"Maybe 3 stars is a bit generous; however, from a film history standpoint, this is an interesting compilation, especially since 2 of the films are re-makes of 'B' sci-fi cult 'classics'.

""In the Year 2889"": Re-make/rip-off of Roger Corman's ""Day the World Ended"" in color. A waste of color film (and the time it took to process it!). Paul Peterson (anyone remember ""The Donna Reed Show"" on TV??) is the 'hero' in a woodenly acted version of Corman's moodier, creepier and much, much better cheapie from the 50's that was filmed in glorious black and white.

""Idaho Transfer"": Probably the best of this bunch. Directed by Peter Fonda, it's the tale of a government secret research project that's a secret kept from the government(!). Give this one some time...it's not an Acadamy Award winner by any stretch of the imagination, but it's worthy of your attention, especially for cinematography. Beautifully photographed, many awesome shots. A bleak, troubling journey into the near future. On another level, a great hiking/camping/outdoors movie.

""Journey to the Center of Time"": Shameless rip-off of Ib Melchoir's ""The Time Travelers"" without the acting, humor,  continuity or values of the original. It does take several 'special effects' scenes from the original movie. Terrible casting of and acting by Scott Brady, who plays a 40 year old man going on 17. The film is hampered by a low budget and inept directing. Look for Lyle Waggoner as the alien leader! If you've seen ""The Time Travelers"", it is clear that this film is from the Alternative Universe of B Movies! From that perspective, it's still fun to watch.

""The Day Time Ended"": The always beautiful/sexy Dorothy Malone plays opposite former TV cowboy star Jim Davis in this ho-hum saga of a family put upon by time-warping aliens, or something. The film's premise is classic sci-fi, but the script, directing, and acting get in the way. Sort of a ""Close Encounters"" meets animated clay figures (and wooden actors).",1143072000,10,1979,5.021341463414634
7986122,1,B00008OM8L,"This is not the Ib Melchior 1964 version of The Time Travelers. It is instead a 2-disc set that contains four films. ""In the Year 2889"" ""Journey To The Center of Time"" ""Idaho Transfer"" and ""The Day Time Ended"". All four films are presented in terrible condition with heavy scratches on both disks. Hopefully I can return this horrible purchase without spending more than $8.99 for the return shipping. Save your money and buy something else!",1142380800,26,441,4.815789473684211
7986123,3,B00008OM8L,"The movie the previous reviewer refers to is ""Time Bandits"", a Terry Gilliam film from 1981.",1138406400,4,92,4.8125
7986124,5,B00008OM8L,"If this is the English movie with the littel boy in his bedroom that finds the map of all the holes in time along with a  strange band of travelers, it's a fabulous kids movie that I would like to see again.  I'm not sure I have the right movie in mind.  Can anyone confirm this?",1128902400,,279,3.9464285714285716
7986125,2,B00008OM8L,"In 1964, Ib Melchior (Robinson Crusoe on Mars) made The Time Travelers.  3 years later David Hewitt made Journey To The Center of Time - a very disappointing, obvious ripoff of The Time Travelers.

If I wanted to purchase a box set of Time Travel films, I would not buy this one with Journey To The Center of Time.

Ultra Cheap, Disjointed, Confusing, Mess!

This is one of my favorites,  camp, lots of inside jokes, a good plot, and if you used to read Famous Monsters of Filmland like I did,  is a special guest shot of Forest j Akerman in it also. This film was also shown in the Air and Space Museum during their sci fi film series. The cast does a good job and some pretty good special effects. For a low budget sci fi flick it covers a lot of ground, post nuclear war, mutants, space travel, love affairs, some wild futuristic music, and of course time travel.  I think the ending will leave you thinking, and wanting to see this movie again and again.",1125705600,,1203,4.516129032258065
