2614483,3,B000GIXCCY,"It is not a sequel to My Name Is Nobody,but Terence Hill's character is similar to Nobody. The dubbing is pretty bad. You can see why Sergio Leone chose to hide his name. The end chase and explosion pretty much make this movie",1330905600,5,226,4.27906976744186
2614484,5,B000GIXCCY,"This movie didn't appear to be a sequel to any other. I was just a tad disappointed in the movie in terms of quality and story line, however, this doesn't mean I don't recommend it for trinity fans. It isn't humerous and slastick as are his My Name Is Trinity movies. There are some interesting variations in this movie as far as plot and story line which make this a very different kind of western for Trinity fans.",1224460800,2,416,4.346153846153846
2614485,3,B000GIXCCY,"This movie is fun to watch (and definitly listen to thanks to Ennio Morricone) but is not near the quality of it's reported and loosely suggested pre-quel ""Nobody..."".  I have read that the original film was stolen and a ransom was demanded for it's return. The movie ended up being pieced together from remaining film. That might explain how some people find it scattered plot wise. Other than that, Terence, as always, is a joy to watch...<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Genius-Two-Partners-and-a-Dupe/dp/B000GIXCCY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Genius, Two Partners and a Dupe</a>",1223164800,3,622,6.232558139534884
2614486,2,B000GIXCCY,"I bought this DVD with the understanding that it was a sequel of sorts to ""My Name is Nobody,"" which is one of my all-time favorite films.  Sadly, this movie is no sequel, except for the fact that in both movies Terence Hill plays a larger-than-life character from the Old West with outlandish gun-handling skills.  The humor that worked so well in ""Nobody"" is sorely lacking here -- the film is so bad that one cannot even find it funny as a satire on the spaghetti Western genre.  The supporting cast is dreadful, the film quality is horrible, the plot is miserable, and the dialogue is laughable (when is the last time, for example, you heard a gunman call his opponent a ""booby"" during a gunfight?).  The only merit to the film is that Terence Hill is fun to watch -- yet even he seems to trudging through this film -- Hill's half-hearted charm is the only thing that rescued this dud from a single star.",1185235200,19,908,4.451807228915663
2614487,5,B000GIXCCY,"I liked this as much as My Name is Nobody even though its way less arty.  Especially funny was the part near the beginning when Hill gets to town and is dumped out of the coach into the dust with his saddle, but he just lays there in the street with the carts and horses going by until he finishes his nap.",1179964800,7,306,3.935483870967742

8133025,1,B000GIXCCY,"I'm a big fan of Sergio Leone so when I read a review on Lovefilm that said this movie was the 'missing link' in his career I had to get a copy.

Turns out I was the one who was duped.

This is appalling!

After watching the film I did some more research on it which revealed that Leone's only connection to it was as 'supervising producer'. He had no hands on involvement - probably the reason why his name isn't credited on the titles. Many of the aspects of his film making are there - the religious iconoclasm, Almeria setting, characters double crossing each other, even a musical watch - but in the hands of a lesser director (Damiano Damiani) they fail to work.

The film is plotless and characterless. Little things like motivation or coherence have been totally overlooked. You'll get to the end and have no idea what has happened or why (but then you probably won't care!). Despite the Almeria setting (and Monument Valley) and the usually excellent Carlo Simi's art direction the film also lacks any atmosphere.

My biggest criticism, however, is the tone. Leone's westerns always had an element of the grotesque and pantomime; combined violence and pathos with moments of genuine humour. This film, however, plays most of the scenes for low slapstick - and failed to generate even a smile in me. This is echoed in Morricone's trite score.

I could go on (... and on - like the movie itself) but won't. In conclusion one of the worst films I have ever seen and a million miles away from the genius of Leone. Best avoid!",1339372800,2,1530,4.565693430656935
