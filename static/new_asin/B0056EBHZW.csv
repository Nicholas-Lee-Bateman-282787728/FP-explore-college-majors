Each DVD contains 2 discs worth of episodes plus easter eggs, and the episodes are uncensored! I love Dethklok and with this DVD set I can experience the brutality forever!",1316736000,13,316,4.763636363636364

4588045,5,B0056EBHZW,"Dethklok:
They are the world's greatest death-metal band.

They are the greatest metal band the world has ever seen, a pop-culture colossus unmatched ...and their popularity is so overwhelmingly enormous, with their vast legions of savagely loyal fans, ...that they compose an economy whose GNP surpasses that of Belgium or similar small nations.

Presiding in their ultra-Gothic castle, Mordhaus, Dethklok commands a personal army of their most devoted followers, the Klokateers. Not just roadies, the Klokateers are Dethklok's personal military and security force, with specific police-powers granted by the United Nations. Anyone, no matter how obscure, can expect a quick and brutal visit for any copyright infringement on the Dethklok name, merchandise, or ""intellectual"" property!

...But underneath it all, despite their billionaire status, ...the members of Dethklok are just a bunch of chronically drunken, stoned-out, adult-adolescent, irresponsible, dopey metal-heads, ...who are completely oblivious to the fact that they are the focal point of an ancient apocolyptic prophecy that is about to reign doom, chaos, and destruction upon the entire world! What role will Dethklok play in the ever encroaching METALOCOLYPSE?

Attend Dethklok concerts with caution:
Every performance of Dethklok results in massive catastrophic accidents with unspeakably grusome maiming and death for vast numbers of fans, Klokateers, and innocent by-standers. In fact, much of the chaos and carnage is supernaturally induced, ...such as when Dethklok accidentally (or negligently) summoned a giant demonic lake-troll that destroyed Finland. Casualty rates are astronomical. However, the survivors bear the scars and stumps of their brutal wounds with HONOR! DETHKLOK RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Surreptitiously watching Dethklok is The Tribunal, an ultra top-secret government entity precided over by the mysterious and diabolical Mr. Salatsia. Consulting all manner of academics, statesmen, intelligence officers, and miscelleneous experts, The Tribunal is constantly gathering information on Dethklok. They make their moves, emplace their armies, operatives, and agents, ...and wait.

So who ARE these members of Dethklok?
Notable characters:

-Nathan Explosion:
The burly, snarling, brooding frontman and voice of Dethklok. Not known of his intellect or sobriety (are any of them?), Nathan Explosion is not entirely stupid. In moments of crisis, he is the ""captain of the football team"", taking bare-knuckled decisive action when called upon, ...usually punching someone out in the process.

-Pickles the Drummer:
Dethklok's second in command, the life-of-the-party, ...and by far the most thoroughly (and frequently) inebriated member, ...which is saying a lot in terms of the epic quantities of booze and drugs consumed by Dethklok as a whole.

-Skwisgaar Skwigelf:
The greatest guitar-god the world has ever seen, ...and will ever see. Possibly fathered by a Norse god (Frey most likely), Skwisgaar is the most prolific womanizer of the group, usually found gratuitously indulging himself under great heaps of naked fashion-models, actresses, and fans. Not that the rest of the band is very far behind in consuming the ever-flowing hoarde of willing woman-flesh that follows Dethklok!

_William Murderface:
The bumbling, buffoonish, base-player of Dethklok, ...whose public statements and actions frequently result in the most intense disasters left in Dethklok's wake. Despite his billionaire rock-star status, ...Murderface still has as much trouble finding women (for reasons that are self-evident)as he did before becoming the world's most famous base-player.

-Toke Wartooth:
The second guitarist of Dethklok. Held back ONLY by his own considerable lack of confidence, lesser experience, and Skwisgaar's overwhelming shadow, ...Toke is ALMOST as much of a guitar-god as Skwisgaar. The sensitive and introverted member of Dethklok, who would probably rather be playing killer monster ballads, ...Toke is just as brutal and just as metal as the rest of the gang when he has to be.

-Charles F. Ofdensen:
The long-suffering manager, baby-sitter, and business-genius behind Dethklok's gigantic success. Ofdensen's background is enigmatic, possibly Military Intelligence, or some manner of Top Secret government agency. Ofdensen, aside from his highly profitable mastery of all things business, is also exceptionally skilled in martial-arts, is a master swordsmen, and possesses an astounding intuition for Dethklok's safety.

-Doctor Rockzo (The Rock and Roll Clown):
The washed-up, degenerate, drug-addicted, former lead-singer of glam-metal band Zazz Blammy Matazz. HE DOES C-C-C-COCAINE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Quite possibly the most revolting cartoon character ever, ...Doctor Rockzo is hilariously disgusting beyond words. Universally hated by most of Dethklok, Doctor Rockzo has ONE friend: Toke, ...the only person who STILL believes in him, despite Rockzo's chronic and prolific epic failures.

The BEST program on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim, ...Metalocolypse is destined to be a classic of black humor for all time, as well as the MOST METAL cartoon EVER!",1415664000,,5154,5.882195448460509

4588051,5,B0056EBHZW,"Amazing show i love it. Brendan Smalls can take my money anytime. I was sad that Seasons 1 and 2 are censored but 3 isn't i think that's just the way it goes cause season 4 (newest as of now) came uncensored and it has the same container type as season 3 which changed from the fold out version that is used with seasons 1 and 2 (if you buy it youll understand what i mean). i haven't been able to find uncensored versions of season 1 and 2 episodes on line but still its nice just having the seasons on hand. Like i said before Brendan Smalls is a genius that creates awesome music and TV shows. I spent the extra bit to get the new set instead of the used just because i respect him as a creator and im all about paying for something i believe in.
SIDE NOTE!!!!
If you like the show you should check out the actual albums Dethalbum I, II and III And if you get the chance to go see Dethklok live, you should, it is definitely worth the money its just a great experience. that is enough of me talking about how much i love This band and show.",1353715200,4,1043,4.019230769230769
4588052,1,B0056EBHZW,"Yes, the discs contain all of the episodes I was looking for. But NO,they are NOT uncensored. I'm not sure if its a miscommunication, but any and all profanity is bleeped out. The discs say 5.1, which they are not. They are 2.0 stereo. Add the fact that my season 2 box was ripped with center disc holder broken. Im not sure if they packed the wrong discs, or if its just advertised incorrectly, but I am left puzzled as to why I paid so much money when I could have bought them individually and saved $$  seeing how they were going for about $15 a piece. The easter eggs are there, but they are on the $15 version as well..I fully feel like I got screwed..STAY AWAY!",1339459200,11,667,4.2109375

8459532,2,B0056EBHZW,"Maybe I missed it somewhere, but I was trying to buy these new. I get them in and notice they're not factory sealed. Back of one season was covered in scratches and another was covered in greasy fingerprints. Both of these came in broken cases. I think season two was the only one that looked virtually brand new.

Because I received used copies I feel like I should have paid less than I did. I paid a bundle price that was only slightly cheaper than they were individually. If I knew these were used, I would have gladly purchased brand new ones individually. The upside is the disks seem to work okay, which is the only reason for the two stars. Still working through them.",1430265600,2,676,4.408
