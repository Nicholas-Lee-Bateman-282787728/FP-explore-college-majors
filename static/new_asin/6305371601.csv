8176765,1,6305371601,"I have read the other reviews for this nauseating waste of time and I can only think that the previous writers are the kindest audience any production could hope for.  Iron Monkey 2 is so bad that it actually devalues the excellent Iron Monkey just by sharing the name.  Yes, it is chaotic and full of action.  But so is a blender that has been overfilled and put on high with the top off. The editing is from Frankenstein's lab, none of the plot elements connect.  The costumes are from the '70's. That's right the 1770's the 1870's and the 1970's because this movie can't decide when it is set.  There are cowboys and monks and depression era urchins and disco gangsters.  It looks like the final scene of ""Blazing Saddles"".
But let's cut to the chase.  You watch a movie like this for the fights. They stink.  They don't approach the technical precision of Jet li.  The merciless intensity of Bruce Lee. The balletic grace of VanDamme.  The charm and acrobatic comedy of Jackie Chan. The buffoonery of Sammo Hung.  Or even the over the top wizard like abilties of the 60's and 70' as in ""Five Deadly Venoms"".  It's just scene after horrible scene of lame kicking and poorly choreagraphed throws with highly visible wires. It isn't even entertaining in an Ed Wood meets chopsocky sort of way.
Everyone involved with this abomination should be embarassed.",1002672000,4,1356,4.651260504201681
