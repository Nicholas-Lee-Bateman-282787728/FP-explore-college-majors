5737931,4,B00CSW06L6,"This is a very timely movie.  It is funny and sweet at the same time while touching on the issues of aging gracefully and still keeping in the game, so to speak.  Brook Shields is great as is the rest of the cast.",1374278400,,213,3.9302325581395348
5737932,3,B00CSW06L6,"Actually more of a 2.5. Cute rather than funny. Wanda Sykes, Daryl Hannah, Brooke Sheilds and Camryn Manheim round out a great cast, but most of the humor comes from exploiting cliche menopausal issues. That gets old. To make matters worse, the film starts out with what appears to be a parody of a well known doctor who in real life, champions the positive aspects of women at mid-life. If you respect the contributions that doctor has made to women's health, you might find that offensive. Then there is the plot. A group of middle aged women attempt to beat the state high school girl's basketball champions. They elect a midget as their coach and are plagued by more than a few long standing issue with each other and society. Daryl Hannah plays a ""closeted"" though very obvious lesbian who sells cars and wears a cowboy outfit. The reason they are doing this is to continue funding for a mobile mammography unit started by a friend who died. There are a few laughs along the way but it is very predictable. And it would have been much better without the preachy breast cancer stuff, which appears to be the reason the movie was made.

I rented this because I ADORE Wanda Sykes. I think she is the funniest woman alive, but in this film she misses the mark and has a tendency to over act. She also doesn't have much of a script to work with and then there is the breast cancer stuff. If you aren't aware, Wanda decided to remove both breasts rather than do a less radical procedure out of fear of cancer. I won't get into the rightness or wrongness of her choice but everyone in the movie talks about knowing someone who has died of breast cancer and the film is even dedicated to someone who died of the disease. Sorry, but fear and comedy don't mix. Maybe there is something to be said for being too close to a subject??? And how about promoting HEALTH for a change.

Over the last ten years much has come out about the causes of cancer, including its relationship to inflammation and the huge number of hormone disputers in our food supply which many other countries now ban. These women have star power and could do much to bring awareness to these hazards. They could champion things like Thermography that can spot inflammation before it becomes cancer. We don't need another advertisement for mammography.",1374192000,3,2316,4.564903846153846
5737933,4,B00CSW06L6,"I would recommend this.  While the characters are fairly one-dimensional, it is worth watching.  The male characters are obviously and unfairly demonized by the script, but it is still good.  It was nice to see a little person given the chance for a lead role, and he steals the show.. Darryl Hannah was miscast as the lesbian, but Brooke Shields really shines even without makeup.  The music is really great. I love the song ""Girls & Airplanes.""",1373846400,,446,4.753246753246753
5737934,5,B00CSW06L6,"Loved this movie about small town life, growing older, changing, family, friends...Loved all the performances. Funny. Saw it twice. Recommend it.",1372291200,6,145,5.9523809523809526

5737941,4,B00CSW06L6,"I admit it, I'm more a fan of independent movies, or movies that don't get wide exposure, than I am of blockbusters.  I enjoyed this movie for these reasons: the cast looked like they had a ball making it.  It was empowering to women.  And it was inclusive.  It also reminded me of the small town I grew up in.  Which is also in the south.  Wanda Sykes' character exemplified the African American who had an entirely different viewpoint than her teammates about growing up in a 90% white town.  It was also realistic as to the problems all women of a certain age go through: Like being ignored by their husbands and raising teens to grow up to be positive human beings.  It might have been even better if Roberts' character hadn't proven to be an extension of his recent typecasting as 'the bad guy'.  It would have been refreshing if his character had turned out to be good for a change.",1469664000,3,888,4.398773006134969

5737947,4,B00CSW06L6,"A fun and well-written and directed movie about an aging team of women basketball players raising funds by playing a series of exhibition games against local high school girls.  The jokes and pratfalls are natural, and the screenplay allows Brooke Shields and friends to alternately strut and appear vulnerable almost concurrently.  The breast cancer awareness adds to the movie's surprising depth and the ending is very believable.

Unlike many movies of this genre that flame out after the first half (the in-training part), The Hot Flashes is consistently entertaining and pretty darn funny.",1424649600,,594,5.365591397849462

5737962,2,B00CSW06L6,"Burning Bush (both a biblical and sexual meaning- I get it) is an ideal Hollywood small Texan town with no visual Hispanics and apparently one token African-American family. The town's mobile mammogram has run out of funds, so Beth (Brooke Shields) has devised an unconventional way to raise money to save it by having some 50 somethings challenge the girl's basketball team.

In addition to Beth the team has:

Ginger (Daryl Hannah) who is still in the closet in the small Texas town.
Florine (Wanda Sykes) who is running for mayor.
Roxie (Camryn Manheim) a pot head.
Clementine (Virginia Madsen) the town floozie. Her ex-husband in the opposing team coach.

Beth's husband (Eric Roberts) is the town's postmaster who has been making special deliveries...and not to her.

The film is not very funny. It briefly touches on hot flashes in one comedy scene, but that was it. At times it was old vs. young, men vs. women, and church vs. everyone, but none of these themes were developed to make a point or be funny.

The film was tritely written. Most of the actresses couldn't spell basketball, let alone play it (especially Camryn Manheim). The basketball segments consisted of lots of cut away scenes. A borderline rental for those for like female comedies, that follow formula and aren't really funny.

Parental Guide: No nudity. 1 sex scene. No f-bombs that I recall, but there is plenty of sex talk.",1378857600,2,1402,4.845188284518828

5737966,3,B00CSW06L6,"I guess I expected more since my sister had recommended this movie to me. It was just okay. More of a Lifetime channel movie, not a rental.

She is trying to figure out what to do with her life when she finds out that the local free breast cancer screening truck is in danger of closing. She decides to get a team of women together to take on the state champs in a basketball game to raise money. I will open by saying that I am not the target audience for this movie. I am mid-thirties male but I will say that I didn't think this was that bad. I did find some of it funny but again the jokes weren't really for me. The message of this movie is inspiring and does leave you feeling good even though the movie is very predictable. The one thing I can say about this is that it would have been very good as a Lifetime movie instead of a direct-to-DVD movie. Overall, better then I expected but I think if you are the audience this is going for you will really like it. I give it a B-.",1376092800,,1034,4.073529411764706

Madsen, Mannheim, Shields & Sykes were hilarious.  Although the storyline in and of itself was lame, the acting (with the exception of Hannah's role) was top notch and you even found yourself rooting for the underdog at the end.  Seeing as the movie was solely created for entertainment and it served it's purpose, I had to give it 5 stars.  I'm not one who likes to watch a serious drama over again, but with no heavy emotional investment to make, I'd watch this again, just for the laughs.",1375833600,,657,4.487394957983193

I first found it on Netflix, then when they took it away, I immediately bought it, because I watch this movie that much. Even my husband loves it, and has sat and laughed through it multiple times! It's definitely a women's movie in that it revolves around woman things -breast cancer, menopause, dissolving marriage, mothering, aging, finding your path, fighting for what you believe in even when ""The Man"" tells you to back down- but it's also enjoyable to the opposite sex, as my husband will tell you (I think he's just happy it doesn't have any talking animals, my usual genre). The movie can be laugh-out-loud hilarious, but also has serious moments when the characters confront important issues and emotions, and they do it well (the movie was superbly cast. Everyone is terrific!)  The movie also breaks down a few walls, quietly, but with class, and leaves you in an uplifted and happy mood.
