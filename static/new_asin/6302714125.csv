495501,5,6302714125,"This is a great sounding recording.  Top notch musicians, in a nearly flawless performance.
It is recorded in Sting's private recording studio.  I believe these are the same cuts he uses on the album.  The ablum had some editing done but this is pure before editing live performance.
I love all the 7/8 and odd meter that Sting uses and he pulls them off flawlessly and smoothly.  Kudos to a great band, great songs great performance and great documentation.",1064534400,5,458,4.7594936708860756
495502,5,6302714125,super video i am trying to get a vcd or vhs copy.... by the way i hosted the band when they played here in PI and got to know them personally. Still call Vinnie and Dominic occasionally. I could just ask them for a copy but they r usually all over the place. Please contact me if it is available anywhere. Thanks,980121600,,312,4.048387096774194
7829531,2,6302714125,The VHS has a fuzzy buzzy back sound that distracts from the film.  I love the album on CD but I can't take this tape because of the VHS quality sound.,1454803200,,151,3.870967741935484
7829532,4,6302714125,"This is a great product for Sting fans.... It is very disappointing that it is not officially out on DVD or Blu-ray.

For now... I watch  a DVD copy that I transferred over from my VHS version....",1414281600,,196,4.27027027027027
7829533,3,6302714125,"I LOVE classic Sting - especially back in these days when he and Vinnie still worked together (Mercury Falling was the last good album).  Anyway, the songs are, or course well written, well performed, well recorded, well mixed and well mastered.  The video editing is loathsome, disgusting, and frustrating at best.  Especially if one has ANY interest in seeing the musicians PLAYING THEIR INSTRUMENTS!!!  Mostly you see Sting's face.  The seconds you can catch are worth the price.",1308528000,,482,5.128205128205129
7829534,5,6302714125,"This is Sting and studio musicians at his home doing the live version of one of his best albums.  And since this VHS is no longer being produced, I felt lucky to have found it.  To my knowledge, there is no DVD of this music video album.  The tape was shipped promptly, arrived in short order and was in excellent shape.  I would purchase from this seller again.",1261526400,,362,4.279411764705882
7829535,5,6302714125,This video puts another whole dimension to the album when watching it performed.  The audio and video production qualities are excellent and for years now I have been waiting and watching for it to be re-released in DVD format.  I am still waiting!!!!!!!!,1249084800,6,255,4.906976744186046
7829536,5,6302714125,"I love this album - one of my favorites by Sting.  It was his best selling ""album"" - I had seen glimpses on YouTube and was pleased to find the video.  Very Good!  Great Music.  It is presented as if they are recording the music in his studio at his home in England.  The title is a ""play on Words"" of his last name.",1195862400,,316,3.875
7829537,4,6302714125,"This is a beautiful representation of one of Sting's best albums. Filmed in a lush rich style at Sting's English Lakehouse over a 24hour period. Apparently there is a lot of lip sync work in this presentation but I can't tell where. Some of the vocals are a different or extended version to the original album which gives the project a true live feel. Also, as a drummer myself I love to watch closely the brilliant work of Vinnie C as he plays. Again it looks like a live performance to me. If it's mimed then it's very well done...... and it's definitely not all mimed because they've done the new versions.
Also, filming the project over 24hours gives it a real sense of weight and purpose. It's not just a collection of music videos but an event. At 3 or 4 in the morning working through the last few songs there is such a great sense of atmosphere. Then finally it's dawn and time for the final track ""nothing about me"".

My only complaint is that there is still no DVD or Blu Ray of this piece of musical history. I so wish the people behind the scenes who have control of such matters had some understanding of the importance of preserving stuff like this. Great literature/movies/music should be timeless. Summoners Tales should not be simply left to deteriorate in some film vault. It deserves a full DVD and Blu Ray restoration.",1190160000,12,1338,4.506172839506172
7829538,5,6302714125,"I was hoping to see this released in DVD, as I used to have it in Laser Disc. This is one of my very favorite Sting recordings.....",1167696000,4,131,3.888888888888889
7829539,5,6302714125,"One of Stings best albums put on video. Great music but not much

going on except 24hrs of taping and recording this album at Stings home near Wiltshire {Lakehouse} in England.  The musicians are some of the best in the business, Dominic Miller,

who is a wizard on the guitar shows some lightheartedness.

Maybe  a little subdued for Rockers but all in all a must see

for die hard Sting fans and the music is some of the best songs

Sting has written, including Fields Of Gold, Shape of My Heart,

and Probably Me.",1120694400,3,516,4.414893617021277
7829540,4,6302714125,"This video is great and I watch it at least once every few weeks but you should know that it is NOT a live performance. I unknowingly purchased this video thinking it would be of live footage of them recording Ten Tales. Rather it is the band lip-synching to the album. But three of the tracks were recorded live as a 4 piece and either cut directly to tape or recorded live and then the band lip-synched to those new ""live"" performances. The three re-recorded songs are Seven Days (a phenomenal performance worth the price of the video itself), shape of my heart, and fields of gold.
 As a musician and a Sting fan I recommend this highly as it is very inspiring to see how such an accomplished musician and brilliant songwriter records a whole album in an old castle. But I still wish I would have gotten an entire albums worth of live material...or at least some interviews. Cheery-oh Guvnah!!",1083110400,3,896,4.530864197530864
