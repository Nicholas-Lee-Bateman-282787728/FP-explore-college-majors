8175016,5,B000EDP5YO,"As a child, this adaptation of Corduroy was one of my favorites - the fact that real people act in it makes it all the more realistic and magical to a child.  It follows the book closely, and adds the perfect amount of suspense for a young child.  Panama and Blueberries for Sal are more simplistic presentations (shows still pictures from the books' illustrations), but still enjoyable. Definitely worth getting!",1278460800,,413,4.885714285714286
