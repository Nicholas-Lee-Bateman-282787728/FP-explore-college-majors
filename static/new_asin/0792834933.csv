138562,1,0792834933,"Way back before DVD's made deleted scenes and outtakes must-see experiences for many, Blake Edwards patched together a ""new"" Panther film from scenes left over from previous films. These scenes would have been great extras on DVDs for other Panther movies. Some of them are quite funny in an outtake kind of way. However, there's no way that this patchwork constitutes a real movie. And the half-hearted attempt at making this a ""tribute"" to Sellers in the credits comes across as exceptionally false when one considers that Edwards continued to make two dreadful Panther films without Sellers.",1074470400,22,594,5.134020618556701
138563,5,0792834933,"Trail of the Pink Panther is a very misunderstood movie. It has been slashed by both critics and viewers as one of the worst comedies of all time, being nothing but a collection of previously unseen footage of old Panther movies, and regular characters talking about Inspector Clouseau,from Commissioner Dreyfuss,the faithful Cato,to even the ex Mrs Clouseau! Surely if this film is watched on its own, without being a fan of the Panther series then it will not only be a disappointing but empty,weak and plotless. But first and foremost this film is an ode to one of the greatest giants of comedy, Peter Sellers, done after his untimely death, even though it might look like the film makers were also cashing in on the Clouseau name, to try to milk every dollar of this franchise after its hero's demise. But nonetheless, there is no doubt that it is a tribute as well..a thank you note on celluloid, you can feel it when Herbet Lom or Burt Kwouk remember Clouseau in the film, it is also a personal remembrance from them to Sellers. Trail of Pink Panther should be seen more as maybe an extra bonus material/deleted scenes or special features(using DVD language), and it will be looked at and judged differently. Watching all the Panther series and all the joy that Sellers and Edwards have provided us over the years is similar to a delicious complete meal with dessert, but then the temptation to have a small piece of chocolate afterwards will not go amiss. Trail of Pink Panther is exactly like this piece of chocolate, you've  had your fill but there remains a very small place still for it.
If you have not seen any or some of Panther series, then by all means do not watch Trail of Pink Panther, but if you are a fan of Sellers and Clouseau then this film should complete your collection, a personal tribute from you to that genuis of an actor.",1063929600,14,1853,4.598187311178248
138564,1,0792834933,"This is Blake Edward's own 'Plan 9 From Outer Space'...only Ed Wood did a better job.
The film is just an excuse to wring a few extra bucks out of Sellers as Inspector Clouseau by using previously unused footage of the late actor and linking it together with new material. The problem is that the early Clouseau scenes are linked by an obvious stand-in and a terrible impersonator dubbing a few lines over Sellers original dialogue. One attempt is so bad that a sound effect of a passing motorcycle is dubbed over the looped dialogue.
Once Edwards has run out of old Sellers footage (from The Pink Panther Strikes Again) we see Joanna Lumley as a reporter visiting old cast members from previous Panther films as an excuse to show superior scenes from earlier films like The Pink Panther and A Shot In The Dark. And if using excised Sellers footage wasn't bad enough, we are also witness to an ailing David Niven having his voice dubbed by Rich Little. This is very obvious as clips of Nivens performance in The Pink Panther are included during his new scenes.
What of the plot itself? There is no plot. The PP diamond is stolen again in the pre-credits sequence and it's forgotten about once Clouseau disappears and Lumley begins her interviews. We see clumsy inserts of newpaper headlines and messages from Dreyfuss incorporated into Sellers scenes in an effort to fit his unrelated sequences into the PP plot, but there's no point as the storyline leads nowhere. Watch out for a bit of looped dialogue of another character mentioning the PP diamond in a scene with Sellers (The Pink Panther Strikes Again had nothing to do with the diamond). The same actor appears in the linking sequences but it becomes obvious that his scene with Sellers was years before as he has less hair in the linking scenes.
The only parts of this film that contains any laughs are the scenes from The Pink Panther and A Shot In The Dark, and the 'best of Clouseau' compilation during the end credits. Apart from that, we see nonsensical new scenes of Dreyfuss dreaming of Clouseau filling his swimming pool with Jello, and a latter sequence with another actor playing the young Jacques Clouseau who bears no physical or vocal resemblance to Sellers at all. To add insult to injury, the film proper finishes with a Sellers stand-in being defecated on by a seagull with the aforementioned impersonator dubbing in some dialogue.
Was this film Blake Edwards revenge on Sellers for the actor choosing to replace Edwards with Clive Donner as director on the proposed The Romance Of The Pink Panther (it's also well documented that Sellers and Edwards cared very little for each other during Sellers final years))? Or was it made purely for contractual obligation reasons? Whatever the reason, what we have here is an insult to the memory of Peter Sellers and his great comic character of Clouseau, and a travesty of a motion picture from a usually terrific director. However, Edwards sunk to new depths as he also directed The Curse Of The Pink Panther (filmed at the same time), replacing Sellers with Ted Wass as a new lead character...and featuring a big name star as Clouseau who has undergone plastic surgery.
Edwards had a chance to redeem himself and the franchise with The Son Of The Pink Panther starring the wonderful Roberto Benigni as Clouseau's son...but it was too late by then to save the ailing series. Benigni was the films only saving grace as the rest of the movie stunk just as bad as Edwards previous two PP efforts.",1057449600,7,3511,4.738562091503268
138565,4,0792834933,"""Trail"" is a whole mish-mosh of things. Including outtakes which are pretty hysterical. Peter Sellers was a master. Quite disapointing that this was the first Pink Panther film I saw. The first half of the film was all right, but the second half it's kind of bland. David Niven's role has been reduced to almost a cameo part. He's so old, and Rich Little is dubbing his voice. A little on the bland side at some points, but I can get a few laughs out of it.

138567,4,0792834933,"I wouldn't nessecarily say this is a BAD film. Just a rushed one. Some of the dialouge is either extremly badly acted (mostly from the mafia bosses wife) or just badly written, as if the writer wrote it when he was sleep  walking. A\On the other hand, the Peter Sellers footage, both the unused  stuff and the flashbacks, light up the entire film. One scene that is not  with Sellers is majorly note worthy:
Dreyfus dreams that Cleuseau put  3,000 pounds of Jello in his swimming pool, then wakes up and dives into  the pool cover!
this is not a bad film. It is just not for people who  expect it to be the same as the other Panther movies.

138568,3,0792834933,"The Trail of the Pink Panther is, yes, a bit of a jumbled mess.  However, the one substantial redeeming quality about the film (which gives it a rating of ""3"") is the oppurtunity for the viewer to catch a  glimpse of what ""The Pink Panther Strikes Again"" produced six  years prior, might have really looked like before the film editors or  possibly Blake Edwards himself, got to it.  80% of the scenes with Peter  Sellers in this movie were originally intended for ""Strikes"", or  so I've been told, and if the audience member does a little ""cut and  paste"" footwork, s/he can determine the exact location in  ""Strikes"" where MOST (but not all) of the Sellers sequences in  ""Trail"" occur.  Some of them are hilarious - the long scene with  Harvey Korman for example (""...and I want THAT nose"") - or the  bit about the ""mess-aaage"".  Others are long and tedious to sit  through.
  I suppose that if someone were really interested and possessed  two video taping machines, one could make a copy of the REAL ""Strikes  Again"" by lifting scenes from ""Trail"" and placing them where  they were meant to belong in ""Strikes""!!!  Someone recently  informed me that the original plot for ""The PP Strikes Again""  included the theft of the diamond, which would account for the other  Sellers scenes in this one which make reference to the famous  Diamond.
The second half is rather boring, but there are some humorous  comments made by the aging characters.
The end sequence during the  closing credits is the best collection of Clouseau scenes probably ever  assembled in one place.",938131200,13,1569,4.753731343283582

Unfortunately, director Blake Edwards thought otherwise and tried to fashion a new ""Panther"" movie with Sellers' outtakes. It doesn't work. The outtakes are OK, but they would have succeeded better in a Sellers anthology or documentary. By the halfway mark, Edwards runs out of Sellers material and the film's contrived narrative comes to an abrupt halt.

138582,3,0792834933,"Trail of the Pink Panther (1982) is somewhat of a comedy within a comedy, as Blake Edwards took unused footage of Peter Sellers' character and injected several sequences into this very mediocre movie. I give Edwards credit for paying tribute to Sellers with this movie, as I think it was done with good intentions. If anything, Edwards' decision to keep Clouseau 'alive' is admirable, and only perpetuates his enthusiasm for the Panther franchise. However, this movie is not without its shortcomings. First, it's sort of ridiculous that so much previously USED footage from the other movies was used, especially for only a 93 minute movie. Second, there's lethargy in this movie, as the supporting actors really lack the energy from previous Panther films. I noticed that the energy was draining in Revenge of the Pink Panther, but this movie has it bottoming out. Even the normally peppy Herbert Lom seems out of sync in this offering; perhaps he was a victim of the script?

138593,1,0792834933,"Too bad there is no zero star rating selection-this abomination deserves it more than any other movie I've reviewed here.

Why am I so harsh?  Because Peter Sellers had died two years before this movie was released, and it is composed almost entirely of scenes culled from prior Pink Panther movies or scenes which had never been used in the actual movies.  Everything else consists of a thin story about Inspector Clouseau disappearing, and a female television interviewer who talks to various people in Clouseau's life-his parents, Kato, Dreyfus, and others.  The scene where Dreyfus makes a Herculean effort to hide his pleasure at Clouseau's disappearance is the movie's only hilarious moment.

Sounds bad?  It's even worse than I can describe.  It was only an hour and a half long, but felt like several hours.  The previously unused clips clearly should never have been used in the first place.  Other than the Dreyfus scene, everything was wholly unfunny and boring.  Frankenstein's monster was nowhere near as horrible.

Blake Edwards called this movie a tribute to the late Peter Sellers.  Edwards may have despised Sellers in life, but I wouldn't wish this ""tribute"" upon my worst enemy.",1403308800,,1197,5.051020408163265

138613,2,0792834933,"The problem with many long-running series is that after a few entries everything seems like old material.  In ""Trail of the Pink Panther"", it literally is.

Director Blake Edwards attempts to make one more Peter Sellers Inspector Clouseau movie, despite the fact that Peter Sellers died before the movie began filming.  To accomplish his goal, Edwards weaves deleted scenes from previous Pink Panther films with newly filmed ""plot"" scenes to try to create a coherent story about Clouseau picking up the trail of the Pink Panther diamond one more time.

Halfway through the movie, Clouseau is conveniently declared missing, and a nosy reporter investigates Clouseau's life.  She tracks down characters from the series and gets them to tell their stories about Clouseau, providing a clothesline to hang highlight clips from previous films on.

It's easy for anyone who's seen the other films to tell where the archive footage, even the deleted scenes, come from.  All of this adds together to create an uneasy feeling of dj vu for the viewer.

There are some original scenes in which the reporter interviews Clouseau's father, leading into some interesting (and funny) flashbacks to Clouseau's childhood.  Even this, however, fails to take away from the feeling of watching the kind of ""clip show"" common in long-running TV shows.  And when a TV show does a ""clip show"" episode, it's either a finale or the show's jumped the shark.  (Think of the final episode of ""Seinfeld.""  This entire movie is the Pink Panther equivalent.)

While the movie could be a good overview or introduction to the series, it's simply not as enjoyable as watching the individual movies themselves and seeing the jokes in their proper context.  Even the new or previously unreleased material pales in comparison to that of the earlier movies.  And while a ""Best of"" disc is something of an enjoyable novelty, it's understandable that this movie flopped.  I can't fathom why anyone would pay money to see it in theaters.

Not to say that this movie doesn't have its place.  For Pink Panther completists, this movie is like a bonus DVD.  But like most DVD bonus features, this movie isn't one that will be watched often.  For anyone other than completists, this movie is definitely skippable.",1150243200,3,2265,5.005347593582887
138614,4,0792834933,"Despite the fact that the first 30 minutes of this film were made up from unused footage and the like of Peter Sellers as Clouseau, these sequences are some of the funniest and most outrageously humorous from the PINK PANTHER series.

The remainder of the film follows reporter Marie Jouvet (Joanna Lumley) as she sets a trail to find the whereabouts of the missing Inspector Clouseau. In doing so she ultimately interviews most of Clouseau's acquaintances from both sides of the law. During these scenes we are treated to highlights from the previous films in the PINK PANTHER series and the feeling is one of endearing nostalgia.

David Niven as Sir Charles Litton, Burt Kwouk as Cato, Capucine as Lady Simone Litton, Robert Loggia as Bruno Langois, Graham Stark as Hercule Lajoy and Andr? Maranne as Sergeant Francois Duval are all present. Eventually Joanna Lumley meets Clouseau's father innovatively played by Richard Mulligan in a very memorable comic setting at the Clouseau estate.

Perhaps this film was assembled to keep the PINK PANTHER series alive and rake in a few quick dollars at the box office. It is sort of a guilty pleasure for me.

In the final analysis and most importantly, the driving force in the entire film is Herbert Lom as Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus. His brilliantly perfected performance with neurotic moments of strife and glee in reaction to the inept Clouseau, present or not, is the singular cohesive element that keeps this film afloat and perhaps a reason to keep PINK PANTHER series alive as long as it did. A guilty pleasure? Yes, but a happy one.

In some ways, TRAIL OF THE PINK PANTHER is one of the best.",1141084800,,1652,4.823321554770318
138615,2,0792834933,"I'm not sure if anybody will ever determine the real motives behind Trail of the Pink Panther (is it a cash cow or a tribute to Peter Sellers?) but there's definitely no denying that this is a weird, daft mess of a movie.

As is well-known, Blake Edwards managed to fake the appearance of his late star by taking a batch of Sellers/Clouseau footage that was left on the cutting room floor and matching these together with new scenes. This is obviously a bad idea and it shows; the first 45 mintues is a jumbled hash but I did like some of the indivdual Clouseau bits during this time. If you don't mind the mess, the first half should be enjoyable. However at some point, Edwards ran out of useful deleted material so he has Clouseau ""vanish"" and the rest of the movie acts as a Sellers tribute. Marie Jouvet, a reporter trying to figure out where Clouseau might be, interviews characters from earlier movies and these interviews bits are used to spolight Clouseau scenes from these movies. The tribute half is not that interesting to be honest and leads nowhere. Joanna Lumley isn't a very good leading actress and this doesn't help matters. In a real bizzare twist, David Niven, playing Sir Charles Litton again, was terminally ill when he did his scenes and couldn't speak well. His voice is dubbed but the voiceover sounds nothing like Niven at all.

I wouldn't recommend Trail unless you're a die-hard Sellers fan. If that's you, just watch the first half for the Clouseau bits and then shut off the tape when Clouseau vanishes.

138617,2,0792834933,"Some people have entertained this as a tribute to Peter Sellers, and I don't want to judge the motives of Blake Edwards and crew, but for the record I am highly suspect when it is asserted that this wasn't a quick money grab.
The first part of the film is a rehash of some scenes from earlier ""Panther"" movies and outtakes cleverly edited to try to resemble a story. The truth be told, there are some individually hilarious clips in the first half, which is why I gave the film two stars.
Hands down the best scene in the movie involves a nightmare that Herbert Lom has regarding a birthday present from Clouseau, and his attempts to swim in it. In fact, the only truly great moments in the film all star Lom, the most gifted of any of the ""Panther"" co-stars. I was also amused that the name of Hercule's (Seller's friend and regular of the series, Graham Stark) boat was ""The Moth"", of course pronounced ""Muuuth"" as homage to Sellers.
The second half (after Clouseau's plane disappears...) is devoted to annoyingly self-important reporter Marie Jouvet, played by the pretty but untalented Joanna Lumley, looking for clues about Clouseau's disappearance. She takes the opportunity to interview Dreyfus and Cato, and as well as Sir Charles and Lady Litton (David Niven and the late Capucine, who, the back story reveals are now married), and most embarrassingly of all Clouseau's ""father"" and nanny. The scene with Clouseau, Senior and ""Nanna"" is utterly painful to watch and is nothing but a bad caricature of Sellers. The childhood flashbacks which follow are even more wretched, particularly the dismal ""Good, Bad, and the Ugly"" parody of Clint Eastwood with a cap gun. Finally, to add insult to injury, the friendly reporter tangles with the mafia in a pointless plot cul-de-sac and fights with Cato, in what may have been the worst single idea in an otherwise artistically bankrupt movie.
