7306909,4,B0108N99I2,"I became aware of the French version of this show, due to it being recommended by my brother.  I started watching  the French version, and really liked the concept and story.  However, I love getting sucked into a story when I watch it, and it's hard for me to do that while reading subtitles.  I also didn't know that I was watching the show he had recommended since he didn't say it was in French.  As a result, I only watched about half of the pilot.

Once I realized it was the show he recommended, I went back to watch it, only to find that Netflix was streaming an English version of the show.  So I chose to watch the English version.  Every scene that I watched was exactly the same as the French version.  So I figured their adaptation was a strict scene-by-scene remake of the French version.  It wasn't until after watching the entire season that I realized this couldn't be the case because the English version has 10 episodes, while the French version has 8.

Overall, I liked the show.  I'm glad I watched it, and was entertained by it.  It didn't feel like the ""Twilight"" movies, as some are saying.  But because I didn't watch all of the French version, I don't know whether or not this version pales in comparison.  I just know that I enjoyed the show, and am sorry to hear that it's not exactly as the French version, and that it's been canceled.

Because they won't be making a second season, I'm on the fence as to whether or not I'll go back and watch the French version.  I won't pick up with the second season, in French, because I know the story deviates.  All I know is that if you like thought-provoking shows like ""The Leftovers"", and you haven't seen the French version of this show, you're unlikely to be disappointed.  Just know that this isn't a scene-by-scene representation of the French version, and that they won't be making a second season.

I normally stay away from remakes.  If the original had been in English, then I wouldn't have bothered to watch this version.  I certainly would have watched the original.",1464998400,,2049,4.481081081081081

7306912,2,B0108N99I2,"Despite what supporters of this show may say, it IS fair to compare this to the original French version because it is a remake after all, not an original idea. So its reasonable to see how this American version handles an already amazing, original, acclaimed series.

It fails.

It starts off great, but that's mainly becuase they stick, scene for scene, to the original. And many of the actors are awesome, delivering some great drama. But it holds true that the greatest actor cannot fix a bad script, and they are contractually, and financially, obligated to perform those eye rolling lines or melodramatic scenes.

The Americanized stereotype is perpetuated here, after episode 5 or so, and the writers atray from the original story and cater to a soap opera/reality television audience. By the end, everything is simplified and/or people are made to act unbelievably for the sake of an audience *gasp*.

Don't believe me, watch the original to see what the hype was all about, why American producers wanted to cash in on an original great series, but inevitably fail because they still think us 'dumb' Americans can't handle anything above the usual ""Twilight""-ized nonsense.

It got an extra star (up from 1-hated it) only because the great actors/acting in it...I wish it all wasn't in vein.",1449619200,4,1298,4.9631336405529956

8721623,2,B0108N99I2,"It's the Hollywood version and not as compelling as the French version.

I remember the ending of ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure"". Hollywood wanted to make Pee-Wee's story and fluffed the story up to where it was almost unrecognizable. It was hilarious. Well, that's what happened here and it isn't as good as the French original version.

The American producers missed the foreboding atmosphere of the French version. They also missed the tension the French version builds.

If you can stand subtitles, watch the French version instead.",1508025600,2,531,5.223529411764706

8721627,3,B0108N99I2,"This show starts out as an almost scene for scene remake of the sensational French television series from 2012. The story is switched from an isolated mountain town in France to an isolated mountain town in northwestern United States. The town is planning memorials for a dam break that killed a bunch of people 30 years ago and for a busload of children who crashed on a mountain road four years ago. One of the girls from the bus accident, Camille, walks out of the woods not a day older and with no memory of the accident. She goes back home to her sister and now-separated parents. A wife of one of the dam workers, Helen, returns to her husband after nearly 30 years of absence; he's too ill to understand or accept her. A fiance who died six years ago, Simon, revisits his former-wife-to-be who has a six-year old daughter and is about to marry a local cop, another awkward situation. A spooky young boy shows up with no apparent family; he's taken in by a young doctor who is moved by his seeming innocence and quiet. And a serial killer returns from seven years ago. Situations are virtually identical to the French version at the beginning; even many of the names are exactly the same with occasional substitutions of English for French version (e.g. Peter was originally Pierre, Jack was Jerome).

Unfortunately, the actors aren't quite as good as the French actors. And the music is not as evocative or distinctive as in the French version. And some story points are made with a lot less subtlety. If you've seen the original version, it's hard to watch through to the more original and more divergent material in the last third of the season.

Some of the character's story arcs are changed from the French series. And an out-of-town reporter shows up asking questions about the dead who have come back. Intriguing new questions and dramatic possibilities open up, similar to the way the television show Lost went along (Carlton Cuse was executive producer for Lost as well as this show). I had that nagging feeling that answers would always bring more questions, like it continued to do for Lost. That became a little disappointing in that show's final season. Sadly, this American version of the Returned has been canceled by its network, so I guess no answers will ever come.

My advice is to watch the original French series and skip this version.",1474243200,4,2363,4.6891566265060245
8721628,5,B0108N99I2,"I lost my mind just watching the first few minutes.  The entire premise was exciting and the pacing was so perfect. The acting is top notch and the writing is so careful and fine.  The first few minutes alone hooked me.  I couldn't stop watching episode after episode on Netflix.  I am so incredibly disappointed to hear it's not coming back for season 2.  So many unanswered mysteries!!!

The only thing is, the series sort of lost its steam around episode 5.  It just sort of came to a screeching halt with action and pacing.  I thought the pacing was great in the beginning few episodes, but the action really needed to move itself ahead at some point and really draw us in.  By the last episode of the season, it felt like episode 6.  The pacing was my problem.  Had the series really got questions answered and the dam breaking and people running, and we got some real answers about the dead people coming back to life, it would have played out so much better for a possible season 2.

That being said, it was still really excellent and I do recommend it if you love science fiction and thrillers!",1470873600,3,1102,4.4278606965174125

8721631,2,B0108N99I2,"I hate to judge an entire series based on just the first episode, but...damn, this just sucked. Slight spoilers ahead. The premise is that some students and teachers on a school bus trip have an accident and are killed. Four years later, they return from the dead. Here's the problem: The reactions of the people, when they see their returned loved ones, are so unbelievably lackluster and subdued. No one screams or reacts realistically. Now throw in the appearance of a creepy, mysterious little boy who doesn't speak (and he is not one of the returned), plus an out of left field murder which makes no sense, and you end up with a series that tries to pull you in with mystery, but only ends up confusing. Again, I would hope that the mystery gets solved by the end of the series, but I have little interest in finding out.",1465603200,,826,4.513333333333334
