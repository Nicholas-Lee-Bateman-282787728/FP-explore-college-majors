I'm not gonna harp over the details of how awesome it is, there are some clips of it on YouTube you can check out. It's beautifully shot and the lack of audience applause and lack of actually seeing the crowd makes for a more intimate experience. Its a great DVD to throw in while you and some friends are chillin and smokin, always grabs their attention. I highly recommend it and at the price, there's really no excuse to not have it.",1298764800,4,580,4.481132075471698

The manic, mad-scientist-looking violinist steals the show at the beginning, but the lead guitarist is able to show off his jazz soloing skills on many occassions. The drummer plays everything, hanging back with a jazz rhythm most of the time but using double-kick beats and even blastbeats sparingly. Every player has a huge range and can go from jazz to metal within seconds, then back to a gypsy-influenced or country melody.

The real treat for me was the encore version of ""Hunger Strike."" Although the piece didn't do much for me when I listened to the album version, the live version is just incredible. Lengthy solos flesh out the piece for 40 minutes, and this is a great thing. The drum solos make me wet.",1206921600,5,920,4.502994011976048

They play with such excellent musicanship that you constantly pull a Wayne/Garth:  ""I'm not worthy!!!! in your mind.  I mean seriously these guys are spectacular.  I can play this music to anyone in my family.  Throw a little chopin (they do a a cover) for my mom, jazz for my dad, metal for my young brother.  These guys can do it all.  I think they appeal to me because they play all my moods and I love that they play for a long time!!! They are fresh all the time it seems like.  You even get Hunger Strike with new twists that makes you hungry for more.  This will SATISFY you beyond music heaven, believe me.",1194307200,6,791,4.241610738255034
