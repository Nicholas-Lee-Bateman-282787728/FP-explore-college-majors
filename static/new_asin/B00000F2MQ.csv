It is rivetting from beginning to end.  Beautiful scenery, and video of several true masters of the martial arts in Japan.",1162512000,9,360,4.507692307692308

Aikido, Judo, Karate, Kendo, Sumo Wrestling and the ways of the great Samuri Warrior are the topics here. I would have liked to see something on the art Ninjitsu. However, the movie has a very clear picture for being filmed in 1982. I gave it five stars. This is one of the best martial arts documentaries out there. I enjoyed this DVD very much.",1152403200,4,444,4.426829268292683

1202375,5,B00000F2MQ,"THE TITLE FOR THIS TAPE IN ENGLISH IS MISLEADING.  BUDO HAD LITTLE TO DO WITH KILLING.  FOR A SAMURAI ONE TRAVELED WITH THE MOTTO:""PEN AND SWORD IN ACCORD!"" DEATH WAS ACCEPTED AND EXPECTED. THE ONLY REAL CONCERN WAS TO LIVE HONORABLY IN THIS MANNER. TO THE SAMURAI, DEATH SHARPENED LIFE.

YET THE MARTIAL ARTS [TO THE JAPANESE ""JUTSU""] WERE CONVERTED TO DO'S [PRONOUNCED DOUGH] WHICH WERE ABOUT IMPROVING ONE'S LIFE THROUGH TRAINING AND PRACTICE.

I HAD THE HONOR OF EARNING MY THIRD DAN [DEGREE]IN FOUR OF THESE MARTIAL ARTS FROM ONE OF THE MASTERS IN THIS FILM, SHOGO KUNIBA.

IF YOU WATCH THIS FILM KEEP IN MIND THAT ALL OF THESE MASTERS ARE CALLED MEIJIN, MASTER OF MASTERS.  IN ADDITION, MOST OF THESE MARTIAL ARTISTS HAVE ALSO BEEN MADE NATIONAL TREASURES BY THE GOVERNMENT OF JAPAN.

IT IS MY HOPE THAT ONCE YOU HAVE SEEN THIS TAPE YOU WILL COME AWAY WITH MUCH MORE THAT AN IDEA OF THE WAYS TO KILL...BUT RATHER WAYS TO LIVE WELL!",1134345600,10,937,4.574850299401198

1202377,5,B00000F2MQ,"The filming is very very good. High production values. Sound is excellent. It shows the beauty of martial arts at its very highest pursuit. You will be totally inspired to train hard.

It covers: Kenjitsu, Karate, Kabudo,The art of breaking, Judo, Naginata, Sumo, Aikido, a short shinto ritual, even a white crane kata which is artfully beautiful and sanchin kata demonstration.

My only criticism is it didn't go too much into the philosophy of budo or any of the martial arts. However it did mention them briefly.

It is definitely worth owning, I have watched it about 5 times in one week and am still not bored with it.",1116115200,,623,4.697247706422019

Karate, Judo, Kendo, Naginata, Aikido, Sumo as well as the traditional weapons are featured such as the sword, the nunchaku, the staff, the three section staff and the sai.  The sound track and filmography are excellent.  I was particularly impressed at how the slow motion footage showed some of the most dynamic throws of Judo.

You can punch and kick and roll all day. But conditioning was and still is key. If you are a slacker with a glass jaw, go watch cartoons and avoid this film.",1421020800,2,459,4.2272727272727275

1202388,4,B00000F2MQ,"This DVD, Budo: The Art of Killing, is not as bloodthirsty as it sounds. There is definitely an emphasis on ""art"" rather than ""killing"" and it serves as a quite good demonstration of Japanese martial arts.

The DVD is quite dated - probably from the late sixties or seventies - but it has a certain charm to it. The demonstrations take place, for the most part, in the beautiful natural settings of Japan. Those demonstrations that take place indoors are usually in the surroundings of picturesque dojos. It has a certain charm and it brings out the art of the martial arts practiced in Japan.

The martial arts presented are: the sword, traditional martial arts weapons like tonfa, nunchaku, sai, kama, bo, and the naginata glaive. Unarmed arts included Aikido, Karate, Judo and Sumo. Each of these had a master-level practitioner who demonstrated the techniques of that art. This video has a very formal feel to it and there are none of the more flamboyant demonstrations we often see today. Frankly, it thought it was a welcome change and there was a certain purity of form in the demonstrations of techniques.

It is a bit dated and the soundtrack definitely has a '70's feel to it but, on the whole, it's a good video. I recommend this DVD with four stars.",1398038400,,1261,4.6968325791855206
1202389,5,B00000F2MQ,This is a concise and beautiful insight into the mind-set of Budo.  Any student wanting to grow in any of the Japanese martial arts would be well-served to spend an evening with this before going too far in their studies.,1397347200,,221,4.525
1202390,5,B00000F2MQ,I saw this movie long ago on VHS and wanted another copy because it shows some great workouts of different disciplines and great demonstrations of sword use and especially at the end a sword being made.  Wow.  Very nice work.,1382140800,,225,4.6

1202393,5,B00000F2MQ,"For those of us who are practitioners of the classical martial arts traditions, it is a great film to see.  Shot in the 1970's, it has retained its appeal over time due to its beautiful cinematography and wonderfully delivered narrative. ""Budo"" is an in-depth look at the various Japanese martial arts, including Kyudo, Aikido, Kendo, Karate-Do, Judo, Sumo and others.  To this day, I think it demonstrates some of the finest technical, mental and spiritual aspects of practice.

1202396,5,B00000F2MQ,"Budo - The Art of Killing (Need to Purchase)

This video is not about murder, assassination techniques, nor is it about becoming an elite saboteur. The content of this video are well worth the purchase. One thing it does is it exposes a variety of approaches to the idea of budo. It provides some historical content while stimulating curiosity. It is a great video for new students in budo to see samples of martial disciplines practiced as they stemmed from Japan, or even how they may be practiced now. There is some good swordsmanship in this video. It does a good job setting the tone of commitment and fortitude as being necessary attributes if one is to embrace or pursue budo as a lifestyle. This video is not meant to be a ""How To..."" instructional video. It is purely informative.
I highly recommend this for anyone wanting to enlarge their exposure to Budo on a larger scale.

1202403,5,B00000F2MQ,"I really enjoyed ""Budo: The Art of Killing.""  I usually watch and review instructional videos, and it was a nice change to watch this documentary on the martial arts of Japan.  One thing that really stands out is the beauty of Japan that is shown throughout the film.  Seeing some of the scenic settings reminded me of places I visited while living in Japan, and how there are so many beautiful and peaceful places in the land of the rising sun.  It's not a fast paced DVD, with some scenes in slow motion with slower music, but that added to the beauty of the film.

Peace and beauty in a film about the art of killing?  Yes, and I found the relationship between the two to be calming and reflected on some of my own training.  Seeing some of the masters train with Mt. Fuji in the background, on beaches, or in other aesthetically pleasing places (most dojos are simple elegance) or the scenes in fields or forests, made me think of how often it is my training in martial arts that calms me and becomes the most serene time of the day.  Meditation and physical training go together.

The training scenes in the film are not instructional.  You are not going to learn how to do the things you see from this film.  Nor does the film elaborate on the training that got the people in the film to that point other than saying it takes a long time and much dedication.  However, watching this can motivate one to pursue their training to reach the higher levels.

For those interested in the various martial arts of Japan, this DVD serves as a nice introduction.  You get to see people training in Judo, Karate, Sumo, Aikido, and more.  The section with women training with the naginata will be interesting for females to see the samurai art practiced by women of all ages.  There was also a lot of time spent on the sword, which the Japanese samurai are known for.  Besides seeing some masters of the sword, the film shows a blade being made as well.  I was surprised that the Ninja and Ninjitsu were not covered.

Overall, I enjoyed this DVD, just as I enjoy reading the older Samurai writings that have been translated to English, and books about the samurai, ancient Japan, Korea, China, and related works.  If you are interested in an artful film about the martial arts and beauty of Japan, you will enjoy this film.

1202407,4,B00000F2MQ,"This video is a surprise. The subtitle is completely misleading. The video is an interesting mix of martial arts techniques, the Japanese culture and the relationship to nature. More than any video that I have ever seen, this one capture how much that nature and culture inspired the implementation of Japanese martial arts.

The video gives a broad stroke coverage of most of the best known Japanese martial arts such as Kendo, Karate, Kobudo, Judo, Aikido and Sumo, however it also endeavors to explain how apparently different styles do find a level of integration. This video is definately not a ""how to"" type of presentation. Instead, it opts to broaden the viewer's understanding of how tightly integrated the Japanese martial arts are to the Japanese cultural mindset. This includes men, women and even children.

I showed this video to my martial arts class, and I asked them to study it, take notes and we then discussed it at the end of the showing. My students, also men, women and children, got it right away. They all saw the connection between mental training and physical discpline. They were both awed and inspired by the physical skills demonstrated. Finally, they immediately understood what it means to be committed to the training.

I should mention that the one sequence that got to everyone, including me when I first saw the video, was the one that includes the locomotive. To explain further would rob the viewer of an amazing visual experience.

All in all, I highly recommend this video to anyone interested in a deeper understanding of not only Japanese martial arts, but of all martial arts. The only weak area that I saw was in some of the flow. It seems a bit jumbled at times. Nevertheless, we can probably consider the video as moving on the road to perfection, but not yet achieving it--just like the subject matter.",1195603200,3,1849,4.841772151898734
