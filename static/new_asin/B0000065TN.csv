 Points how kids get into trouble so easily and many of them can be straightened out if the right people come along especially when they move to new schools and have no friends.

Even cripples can help others.

Therapy horses are great creatures even when it is accidental.

Ending was a bit over the top.",1461369600,,381,4.463768115942029

1192309,4,B0000065TN,I saw this movie when I was a teen which was about 15 years ago.  I loved it then and I love it now. This is a family drama. It shows the hardships of life from both parent and teen point of views. It has a lot of sad moments but it also has romance and some amazing horse stunts.

1192387,1,B0000065TN,"Dark Horse (David Hemmings, 1992)

Poor David Hemmings and Tab Hunter. It seemed that at one point, both of these previously-formidable actors were in desperate need of money, which led to them collaborating on this mess of a movie (Hunter wrote the script). I can't be certain this was a Lifetime Original Movie--if so, it was one of the very first--but if it wasn't, this has to be one of the movies from which Lifetime grabbed their formula.

The movie starts off promisingly enough. Dad (St. Elsewhere's Ed Begley Jr.) and daughter Allison (Dutch's Ari Meyers) move from Los Angeles to the middle of nowhere. Allison hates it, falls in with the wrong crowd, and ends up getting arrested and having to do community service at a horse farm for the underprivileged run by Susan Hadley (Ginger Snaps' Mimi Rogers). Of course, dad and Susan are attracted to one another, and Allison bonds with Jet, a racehorse who won't let anyone else ride him. But oh, it doesn't stop there. You can't just leave it at that, you have to throw all sorts of other stupidities in the way, but then we'd be getting into spoiler territory.

It just gets dumber, dumber, dumber, with no hope whatever of redemption. You know it's going to keep getting dumber; the only question is how far Hunter is willing to go to try and pull the viewer's strings. All the way, it turns out; I can't imagine the stupid getting worse than this. *",1375574400,2,1410,4.609561752988048
1192388,5,B0000065TN,"I bought this movie for my daughter because it was one of her favorite childhood movies.  Unfortunately, it is not out on DVD yet - however, this was - according to my daughter ""an excellent movie, just like she remembered.""",1283212800,,224,4.6
1192389,3,B0000065TN,"This movie went a bit too slow for me, but overall, it was a good film.  Made me cry a couple times when soem horrific things happened to the horse.  But it was genuinely a well written story and Begley, Jr. is always a solid actor.  The man is one of the greats of his era, as his Oscar winning father was a great in his.  Tab Hunter did a great job with a small part.  But his greatest film is:  Track of the Cat.",1179014400,,415,3.823529411764706
