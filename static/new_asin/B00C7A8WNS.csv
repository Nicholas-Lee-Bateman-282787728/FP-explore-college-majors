When it comes to diagnosing the death of those unfortunate enough to end up in the morgue, Dr. Quincy gets to the bottom if the death is suspicious.

5692440,5,B00C7A8WNS,"Season Six, overlooked on my original order competes the set.  Ah, Qrusader Quincy, the Everyman of medical moral turpitude and investigations of those fatal incidents which provide evidence of social and cultural abnormalities and the probable necessity of strident public activism.  All to the greater good, of course.  The recurrent theme of the series is to highlight issues of the day by illustrative dramatization, first, show the result, then define the problem, and finally offer effective solutions.  Jack Klugman was as fine a Quincey  as could have been found, a bit strident, sometimes prone to over-acting (perhaps a result of his stage training?), but very believable in his role as a senior medical examiner in one of the largest cities in the nation.  Over time, especially when steady exposure to a string of episodes dulls one's tolerance for the repetitious introductory musical performance, one gets annoyed by the just plain noise caused by the too-loud music which heralds the onset of the play.  Thank goodness for the ""mute"" button.  Damn these producers, their musical relatives, and the sound engineers who blast away when no one is watching them.  Robert Ito, as Sam, Quincy's very capable lab assistant, delivered a stable character base and foundation for Quincey's competent, but sometimes more emotionally fractured persona.  A delightful combination. John Astin was a good fit in the early episodes, but soon was dropped in favor of John Ragin, who played Dr. Asten, the almost curmudgeonly department head who routinely harassed his staff about such things as minding the budget, sticking to procedures and holding timely press sessions.  Of all the serious series television produced in the sixties, seventies, eighties and nineties,  this one is the best.  Belongs in every appreciative person's library of film and television work, even if it seems more than half of the actors, producers, directors, writers, and
production crew personnel residing in the left half of L.A. were hired at various times to contribute to this work.  Good job.",1461369600,2,2076,5.251515151515152

5692452,3,B00C7A8WNS,"as a stand alone, this season of Quincy is just fine as are all the seasons. I haven't seen Quincy in years. However, I got hooked on Murdoch Mysteries and have the entire set.

I thought that Quincy would focus more on the crime SCENE forensics, filling in science to what Murdoch does in his ""Sherlock-ian"" role.

Unfortunately, Quincy (although he certainly knows his stuff) does not perform the way I wanted---i.e., viewing the scene to fill in the blanks of the typical police investigation.

8577937,4,B00C7A8WNS,"Welcome to QUINCY, M.E., one of the most enjoyable and influential television shows in the history of television. This is the story of Dr. Quincy  (no first name ever given, though we are once told it begins with an ""R"") a crusty, hot-tempered, do-gooding Los Angeles County medical examiner (Jack Klugman) who uses forensic science to unravel mysteries which leave his cop friends Lieutenant Monohan (Garry Walberg) and Sergeant Brill (Joe Roman), and his paper-pushing fop of a boss, Dr. Asten (John S. Ragin) scratching their respective heads. Of course when Quincy is not solving murder mysteries he is taking up a lance for every public-spirited cause you can possibly think of, from child abuse to teenage drug use to illegal immigration to punk rock music and beyond. Can't fight City Hall? Quincy treats City Hall like a rock-'em-sock-'em robot!

Of course, in so doing, he aggravates absolutely everyone, from murderers, who try to kill him, to big corporations, who try to muzzle him, to his girlfriends (he has thousands), who try to leave him, to his long-suffering assistant Sam Fujiyama (Robert Ito) and best friend Danny Tovo (Val Bisoglio) who just try to put up with him. Half the fun of QUINCY is seeing the enraged or baffled expressions of everyone who crosses his path. Imagine a fiery liberal muckraker with a medical degree and a nose (a BIG nose) for mysteries and a taste for the ladies, and you've got this show in a nutshell.

QUINCY is, of course, very dated at this point, but that simply lends it extra charm -- the charm of nostalgia for the 70s and early 80s. As for the characters, there is so much chemistry between them -- Quincy's relationships with Monohan and Asten are priceless -- that it scarcely matters that most of them are one, or at best, two dimensional. The feel-good endings that mark most of the early seasons, the heavy-handedness of the social commentary and the ""after school special"" cheesiness may be cause for scorn from some, but you have to remember that QUINCY was considered quite groundbreaking at the time. It tackled many taboo subjects -- from incest to racism to elder abuse -- and it introduced the world to the idea of a ""forensic detective,"" which is now probably the most overdone genre of television and film that there is, yet at the time didn't even have a name. Long before CSI, there was Quincy!

Season Six continues the long tradition of excellence fans expected from this series, and while there are a few clunkers -- the awful ""Dear Mummy,"" for one -- by and large it delivers. Some of my favorites:

Last Day, First Day - A dovetail of a story has Quincy (supposedly on vacation, but we know how those go for him) working out his male chauvinism on a female pathologist, while defending an aging, veteran pathologist from her charges that he botched an autopsy. Blackmail, murder and obstruction of justice are all elements in this rare example of ""Quincy as suspense"" (as opposed to mystery).

The Hope of Elkwood - When an athlete dies while being harshly trained by his coach, Quincy investigates to see if a pre-existing condition could have caused the boy's death...despite Quincy's intense dislike of the man alleged to have ""run him to death.""

Headhunter - An unusually gritty and brutal episode which features a grisly murder, an out-of-control Narcotics cop, and a whole lot of cocaine. Some great work here by Joseph Sirola as the nasty but righteous Internal Affairs cop Drasso, and by Eddie Fontaine as the likeable yet on-the-brink Det. Joe Marsala. Garry Walberg also shines when given something more to do than yell at Quincy (he gets to yell at Drasso!)

Scream to the Skies - One of QUINCY's finest storylines begins with a horrible plane crash in Santa Monica Bay. Quincy, devastated by the carnage, discovers that the airlines are to blame for the large number of fatalities and goes to war on them in Quincy-like fashion. John S. Ragin did exceptionally fine work in this episode, once again making three-dimensions out of a one-dimensional character.

Jury Duty - Hilarity ensues when Quincy, serving in a jury on a murder case, begins to find fault with every aspect of the police investigation, leading him into conflict with the short-tempered judge.

To Kill in Plain Sight - One of those most nuanced and layered scripts the show ever shot has Quincy and Monohan racing to stop a professional assassin from killing someone at a political convention. Unfortunately they know neither the intended target nor the identity of the assassin!

Sugar and Spice - A favorite of mine has Quincy erupting like Vesuvius on the quackish purveyor of a fad diet, one Quincy blames for the death of a fashion model, and which he believes may kill the model's overweight kid sister.

Of All Sad Words - Quincy falls hard for a gorgeous widow who may have murdered her husband. Although this episode has Q. acting rather out of character, it's a great combination of mystery and suspense.

Vigil of Fear - When a well-meaning vigilante group gets embroiled in what may be a murder, Quincy gets embroiled, too.

All in all, this season was very good and did a fine job of balancing ""causes"" with the mystery and suspense stories. Normally, five seasons is generally the point at which a television show starts to show signs of fatigue and indifference, but I'm happy to say QUINCY was still going strong. What else would you expect from a man with no first name?",1511740800,,5449,4.795309168443497
