7888178,5,6305382255,"No doubt about; the feeling is back; Chuck Mangione shares his brazilian`s music
love (Jobin, Dorival Caymi) as well as standards and (!!!) La Vie en Rose with
his listeners, in clean, melodical and passion mood; in my head, three names came
immediatly: J.J. Jonhson, Chet Baker (eventually) and Herp Alpert; in my heart just
one record (from Concord Jazz), regarding to instrumental musical, had left so deep
pleasure: an album recorded by J.J. Jonhson as a tribute to his recently passed
away wife(at the time)and presents her name as title; I'm so sorry, I don't remember it's title; I hope Amazon is able to fulfill this gap; remember, this album or dvd (chuck mangione) belongs to Chesky label and it's audio is 96/24; hope bring some
usefull information,
Silvio Helio.

7888179,1,6305382255,"Very Poorly done. The sound and picture does not line up together. The video has a delay over the sound.
Not good. Would not recommend.",1285372800,,135,4.44
7888180,1,6305382255,"The most annoying thing is the editing, the fingerings Chuck plays don't line up with the sound.  On the rare occation that it does it looks weird cuase you've gotten use to seeing it out of sync.  I buy live DVD's for the live experience and this doesn't give it.  I also found most of the songs to be slow and laid back more than I'd like, liven it up a bit.  Overall not my favorite show.  Not a bad review of Chuck himself, he did fine, but the production value was lacking, thus the low rate.",1234137600,2,497,4.082474226804123
7888181,5,6305382255,"I have a Hitachi 16X9 Widescreen HDTV Monitor w/6 speaker, 600watt sound system and the only words to describe this DVD experience are UNBELIEVABLE, INCREDIBLE, WOW, AWESOME! You just don't get a better experience than this. The picture is crystal clear.. sharp.. you think you're sitting in front of them. If you love Chuck like I do, buy this DVD today and put it on for a nice romantic night with your better half or alone to relax..

7888183,4,6305382255,"Since my first attendance to a show with Mangione in Wolfs Trap, Va., I get a special feeling, related to his latin roots. It's not italian? Later I Saw him in New York with my wife and together we experienced tha same  feeling. Later we lost the route with Chuck. Here is again with a lot of  spectacular musician form Brazil and USA, and the quality of songs and  quality of video permit me to suggest this Album. Please hear Aldovio.",947548800,5,436,4.3580246913580245
