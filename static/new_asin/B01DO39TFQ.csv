8756487,5,B01DO39TFQ,"After all these years this group is as strong as ever. All the new songs performed were excellent. One of the main highlights of the show was a duet of the song ""Sugar"" by Sunny and Yoona. They begin the song high in the aisles among the crowd and touch and shake hands with so many people in the audience. I've never seen members of snsd interact with the audience like that in any of the numerous concerts I've seen of them. The audience seemed stunned and excited and it was a joy to watch. The girls performed so well that i didn't notice Jessica's absence as much as i thought i would. If you liked the third concert in Japan, you should get this one as well.",1478390400,2,664,4.1953125
