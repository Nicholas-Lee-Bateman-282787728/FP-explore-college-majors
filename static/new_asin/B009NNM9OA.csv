5353623,4,B009NNM9OA,"Appropriately timed for the anniversary of Jackie Robinson's first appearance in a Major League baseball game, the long-in-development movie about the years leading up to it are finally presented.  Robinson is nicely portrayed by Chadwick Boseman who is a dead ringer for the young Jack.  Very convincing as the tough baseball player who must hold back against insults and more, as the first black man to play in the Majors.

With equal parts moral justice and economic enhancement, Branch Rickey (superb Harrison Ford), the owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers decides it's time to make changes to the roster.  Director and writer Brian Helgeland gives us a couple memorable scenes which do a great job showing the courage of Robinson and others as the idea of blacks playing on the same teams as whites begins to materialize.

In a hard to watch scene, the manager of the Phillies (Alan Tudyk) berates Robinson at bat by calling him the full scope of racial epithets.  Jack comes close to losing it, especially when his wife (Nicole Beharie) is included in the insults.  It is also the time when several of Robinson's still biased teammates begin to support him.  The owner of the Phillies also begins to get bad press for being so openly prejudiced.

In another scene, the Dodgers are heading to Cincinnati to play.  Kentucky fans are flocking to see their Louisville native, Pee Wee Reese (Lucas Black), play.  Earlier Reese had been sent a letter, the writer upset that Reese would play baseball on the same team with Robinson.  When he shows the mildly offensive letter to Rickey, he chuckles and pulls out a file cabinet drawer full of death threats to Robinson and his family.  The scene shows a father and his young son, both espousing the greatness of Reese.  When Robinson is introduced the boy joins his father in boos and racial slurs.  Then Reese walks over to Robinson and puts his arm around Jack and the boy stops and his facial expression changes from anger to acceptance.  Things are beginning to change.

The acting is solid by everyone, but Ford's Rickey is truly memorable.  The film does a fine job creating an honest depiction of one of the great heroes in American history.  It does it in a way that will seem familiar with many biopics, however.  Several scenes use swelling orchestral offerings and slow motion trots around the bases, often seen before.  Still ""42"" hits all the right notes and will leave you cheering at the end.",1366070400,5,2450,4.785714285714286
5353624,5,B009NNM9OA,"This is one of the few movies made recently which I thought worthwhile enough to see in the theater.  I liked it a lot and am glad I saw it, and will await the DVD.  The movie tells the story of Jackie Robinson breaking the color barrier in baseball because of the conviction of his manager Branch Rickey, who is played by Harrison Ford.  Rickey felt called by the Bible to hire a black baseball player to the Brooklyn Dodgers to battle segregation.  I agree with some professional movie critics that Harrison Ford does the most risk-taking in the movie (that is, steps outside of a safe formula).  He plays a character with even a different voice than he normally has, as well as a different kind of personality.  Branch Rickey is a tough guy with outspoken moral conviction, what people would call a ""Bible-thumper"".  I like it that when his religious conviction becomes part of the humor of the movie, the humor doesn't disrespect religion, but just contrasts his conviction with the lackadaisical attitude of others.  I also like it that unlike a lot of movies, crude language wasn't just thrown into this movie in a carefree way.  For the most part, the language occurred when racial tensions were high, instead of just as a part of normal conversation.

The relationship between Jackie and his wife is an enjoyable one, and the movie shows a rewarding change in the attitude of the Dodgers team toward Jackie.  In storytelling, the only thing which I felt was missing in this movie was a sense of direction at the end.  The storyline ends with Jackie gaining acceptance by his team and a set of images depicting successive games with a fanfare soundtrack, and I think it could have had a little more closure.  My overall two impressions of the movie are:  1. Inspires you to fight for your convictions and 2. Harrison Ford is a really versatile actor.",1366070400,3,1857,4.656441717791411
5353625,4,B009NNM9OA,"When debating the greatest baseball players to ever step foot on the field, the same names usually enter the discussion.  More often than not, the number one slot will belong to Babe Ruth or possibly even Willie Mays, but after that - it's all wide open.  What does this have to do with film?  You can usually tell a baseball player is amongst the greatest of all-time if his lifelong tale is depicted on the big screen.  Shoeless Joe Jackson is a favorite amongst filmmakers, since he's one of the most controversial players in the history of the game - being portrayed in Field of Dreams, Eight Men Out, and was one of the inspirations behind the main character in The Natural.  Babe Ruth (The Babe), Roger Maris & Mickey Mantle (61*), and Ty Cobb (Cobb) are just a few of the baseball legends that have also been chronicled on film - along with Jackie Robinson in the film, 42.

Directed by Brian Helgeland (The Order), 42 stars Chadwick Boseman as Jackie Robinson, a Negro league baseball player that becomes the first African American to play in Major League Baseball.  Signed by Brooklyn Dodger owner, Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford), Robinson works against the racial segregation of the late 1940s and early 1950s in the United States.  Not only does Robinson have to work to overcome the racism of the baseball crowds, he must learn to co-exist with his teammates, coupe with the endless death threats, and prove to doubters that can work his way up from the minors to become an everyday starter in the Major League.  Nicole Beharie, Andre Holland, and Christopher Meloni also star in supporting roles.

From start to finish, Chadwick Boseman carries the film on his back as the legendary baseball great, Jackie Robinson.  Boseman manages to leave an everlasting and emotional impression about the difficulties Robinson had to contend with when he entered the major leagues.  In all honesty, it's nearly impossible to imagine having to walk into the fire of Major League Baseball at a time when the idea of an African American playing on the same field as a white man was appalling to the masses.  After time and for the most part, Robinson's teammates grew accustomed to him and eventually accepted him, including his first major league manager, Leo Durocher.  Portrayed by Christopher Meloni, Durocher gives a very moving speech to his players about how their negative (racist) behavior towards Robinson would not be tolerated.  However, the only outstanding inaccuracy from the film also revolves around Durocher and his suspension from baseball - with the film depicting the suspension due to a marital affair, when it really had to do with gambling (sensitive subject, apparently?).

Speaking of memorable portrayals, Harrison Ford also brings his A-game to the field in 42.  At this point, it's hard to call anything Ford does a disappointment (even though he's had some easily forgettable roles), but Ford's portrayal of Brooklyn Dodger owner Branch Rickey is flat out enjoyable and entertaining.  Ford brings a light-hearted charisma, not to mention a great deal of laughter, as the over-the-top owner, who was looking to make waves in baseball.  While Jackie Robinson did become the first African American to play in the majors, it wouldn't have been possible without owner, Branch Rickey.  Determined to desegregate the game of baseball, Rickey ignored the ""unwritten rule"" of not allowing Negro players in the major leagues, and kick the door open for equal rights in baseball - which is honorably displayed in the film.

Falling in love with a film is difficult, but being pulled into a wonderful plot with enjoyable actors is always a treat - especially when biographical films potentially try to re-write history to make it more exciting for the big screen.  With that being said, this film gets history right and honors the acts of both Robinson and Rickey in the process.  42 is a film less about baseball, and more about one man having the desire to prove that he has the right to play baseball.  The baseball diamond is nothing more than a backdrop for this film, with the real emotions coming out in the dugout hallway, locker room interactions, and Rickey's office.  Although, one major scene from the film does take place on the field, which involves the verbal abuse being dished out by Philadelphia Phillies manager, Ben Chapman (Alan Tudyk), while Robinson is at bat.

Overall, 42 pays homage to the memory of Jackie Robinson - a man that was not only a great baseball player, but was also a role model for everyone.  He displayed tolerance and patience in an unimaginably difficult environment, thus paving the way for the diversity and equality we have in today's world.  This is an absolutely enjoyable film, but it also sends a thematic message about the importance of equality (especially during a time when bullying has become such a hot button issue).

5353626,5,B009NNM9OA,"When I was a kid Jackie Robinson and Branch Rickey were history, I read about them in books. But my baseball heroes were Billy Williams and Fergie Jenkins, to me they were always just baseball players, their being black wasn't a factor in either my liking or disliking of them, and ""42"" brings home the truly heroic effort and forces Jackie Robinson had to overcome.

""Sports movies"" are best when they're a metaphor for other areas of our lives. ""Field of Dreams"" isn't really about baseball, ""Rocky"" isn't really about boxing, and ""Hoosiers"" really isn't about basketball. What those movies speak to are other forces in our lives that hopefully bring out the best in us, and while ""42"" isn't metaphorical it speaks directly to our views of race and racism.

""42"" takes place between 1946 and 1948 when Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford) brought Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) to the Brooklyn Dodgers and integrated baseball. The plot is as simple as that, the story isn't. Robinson was virtually alone, Martin Luther King Jr was still a high school student, Rosa Parks hadn't yet refused to sit at the back of the bus (although Robinson had and was court-martialed for it in the military), those who believed in him were his wife Rachael (Nicole Beharie) and Rickey. Robinson didn't even have the backing of his teammates who started a petition refusing to play with Robinson, slowly Robinson won over their respect. The way Robinson won over their respect, besides being a great ballplayer was to smile while epithets and threats were hurled at him, to get back up after players on opposing teams purposefully injured him. Robinson is a man with a temper but he knows history is watching and whether the integration of baseball happens or not rests on how he acts, and in public he was a tower of strength and ""42"" is brave enough to show Robinson's private moment of doubt and wanting to strike back at his attackers.

The cast and acting of ""42"" is superb, Chadwick Boseman resembles Robinson so much the only thing better would have been Robinson playing himself. Boseman exudes Robinson's strength smiling in the face of those who don't want him in baseball while showing the pain that lies just under Robinson's surface. Ford's Branch Rickey is a hero apart from the characters of overt action Ford has played in the past and Ford summon's Rickey's unshakeable faith in the integration of baseball because of his sense of what is right and his religious views make Rickey a pillar against which the waves of racism wash against and try to erode but ultimately fail. It may be to early in the year but this may be a Oscar worthy performance for Ford. Nicole Beharie as Rachel Robinson is Jackie's pillar of strength, it's a clichd role but it is no way clichd or rote acting, Beharie conveys the tender support Rachel Robinson did for Jackie and as she still does carrying on his legacy. Christopher Meloni is great as Dodgers manager Leo Durocher and he brings the menace and ultimate authority that Durocher had as a manager, it's a shame history took Durocher out of the game so early in Robinson's story Meloni steals the screen in his scenes. As Durocher's replacement Max Gail plays Burt Shooten, the position and character are place holders in history and the movie, but it's kind of cool to see Max Gail in a film.

Today all sports and teams are integrated, all races participate in all sports, we don't even think of it as integration any more, it's just the fact that if you rise to a certain level of achievment you can play professional sports no matter your ethnic background or heritage. There are also reminders for us that ""42"" isn't dead history, throughout the movie we hear the rejoinder of ""this isn't the America I know"" echoes of which we've heard in our recent past. ""42"" even offers a choice, when the Dodgers play in Cincinnati we see a father and son in the stands, the father relating seeing his baseball hero Honus Wagner as a kid, a touching moment that has probably been repeated millions of times in the 100 year plus history of professional baseball. But when Jackie Robinson takes the field the father starts calling him ""n-----"" the son at first looks stunned at the change in his father, then following his father's example starts using the same epithets until his hero Pee-Wee Reese comes up to Robinson and puts his arm around him for all to see and the camera cuts back to the confused look on the kids face, he has a choice to make in life. That is why ""42"" is a special movie that reminds of us a time that wasn't so long ago (well within the confines of a life time) and how we got to where we are, it's a history to remember and not let the forces of ignorance and hate take us backwards.",1365897600,66,4737,4.629013079667063
5353627,4,B009NNM9OA,"""42"" tells an important story about America and race relations, but the quality of the film itself doesn't live up to the importance of the message. In many ways this is an ordinary by-the-numbers biopic, of which there are many, including ""Cobb"" (1994), ""61*"" (2001), ""Pride of the Yankees"" (1942), ""Eight Men Out"" (1988), and even ""The Jackie Robinson Story"" (1950). Where this film deviates from those other films is that it provides a glimpse of the behind the scenes struggle that took place at the owner/management level, and for this fact alone we can be thankful because it gives us the very best performance by Harrison Ford. We all know Ford from his very successful career. He is certainly an A list movie star, but I never considered him a fine actor until now. His performance alone is reason enough to see this film.",1365897600,3,830,4.731034482758621
5353628,5,B009NNM9OA,"Wow, this is even better than The Blind Side!  Watching this movie, one can really get the feel of what it was like in 1947, with bigotry and prejudice in both the North and South.  The most touching moment was when Pee Wee Reese put his arm around Jackie in Cincinnati, just accross the river from Kentucky, a Southern state, to send the crowd a message!  As for Jackie, WHAT A MAN!!!  And Branch Rickey made it clear that he wasn't out to win a popularity contest by signing a black man, which just a year earlier wouldn't have been possible with Judge Landis as commioner, who hated blacks.

The only drawback to this movie, and it really wasn't the movie, was that the Dodgers lost the world series, then we could've seen Jackie in action against the Yanks!",1365811200,2,761,4.446043165467626
5353629,3,B009NNM9OA,"What is it about baseball that touches our emotions and runs so synonymous with our American culture? In the new movie ""42"", about the early career of Jackie Robinson, the first African-American professional baseball player, the culture of the mid-1940's is explored. At a time when racism was rampant, a man named Branch Rickey, an executive with the Brooklyn Dodgers, changed baseball forever. He wanted to win and he saw a flood of untapped talent in the Negro Leagues.

Much of what Jackie Robinson became as a man and as a baseball player can be attributed to Rickey, but nobody had to face the fire like Robinson. Chadwick Boseman plays the legendary Jackie Robinson and for lack of better words, he hit it out of the park. Harrison Ford plays Branch Rickey. For a long while, it is sort of strange to see Ford as a older, puffy, weathered and worn old baseball executive. Yet, he also delivers a top-notch performance as the guy behind the scenes, pulling the string, knowingly orchestrating the future.

""42"" is beautifully filmed and accurately filmed. In fact, it may be one of the most authentically filmed baseball films ever. The ballparks are recreated beautifully. Everything is authentically detailed from the gloves, to the practice fields and even the lack of lights at the Negro League games. To list all the things that the movie creators did to authenticate their film, would take up my entire review.

While the movie is beautifully film and authentically filmed, I felt that it played out too much like a historical timeline document. The film covers the first two years of his time in the Dodgers organization and it is essentially a by the numbers sort of story arch. He did this and then this happened and then this did, etc. There were some powerful scenes where we see Robinson's steel faade crack a bit, but as a whole the movie never came close to effecting my emotions like other baseball or sports movies have. The bad thing is, this one should have because it is real and the story deserved that emotional impact.

Jackie Robinson's story is an amazing one and an important one. In many ways, Robinson changed the culture of America more than Martin Luther King or Rosa Parks. He carried himself with honor and he was part of something that America loved and those that didn't like it, could do nothing about; baseball. For that, ""42"" is an essential film and a good one. Unfortunately for ""42"" though, Roy Hobbs batting despite a knife wound and Ray Kinsella playing catch with his father are still the benchmark for baseball movie moments. ""42"" never comes close to touching those kind of emotions.",1365811200,2,2633,4.767543859649122
5353630,5,B009NNM9OA,"""Plaaaay Ballllll!"" Yes, the Boys of Summer are at it again and this time, I learned a LOT about where American baseball has been and the fundamental changes that have happened in my lifetime. Even though we already know how it ends, thanks to a terrific PG-13 script by Brian Helgeland (Oscar for ""L.A. Confidential"") this insight into the Great American Pastime is an excellent reminder of how far we have come, thanks to courageous trail blazers like Jackie Robinson, who integrated professional baseball in 1945 at the instigation of Branch Rickey, a baseball executive who loved the game.

We cringe at the language used to attack our hero, we are saddened by the refusal of hotels and restaurants to serve a team that includes a black man, we are enraged by the racist heckling that takes place and we cheer when we see a man quietly rise above the rancor and ""just play ball.""

Here is a sample of the (huge) wonderful cast:
  * Chatwick Boseman (""The Express"" and lots of TV) is heroic as the legendary Jackie Robinson, whose Brooklyn Dodgers uniform boasts a ""42"" on the back. Despite Jim Crow laws, blatant racism and a potential lynch mob, he staunchly maintains, ""I'm just here to play baseball.""
  * Nicole Beharie (""Shame"") is Robinson's gentle wife, Rachel, who is the calm at the center of his storm. The Robinsons are from Pasadena, so neither of them had ever encountered segregation; they had only read about it.
  * Harrison Ford (""Ender's Game"" SOON!) is marvelous as Branch Rickey, the man who first brings a black man (Robinson) into Big League Baseball. He pulls no punches when he lays out what is in store for Robinson; he gives excellent advice. He explains that ""God is a Methodist.""
  * Christopher Meloni (""True Blood"") as Dodger coach Leo Durocher, Jackie Robinson's first defender on the team. He blasts the rebellious Dodger teammates who threaten to boycott until Robinson is fired: ""If Robinson can help us win, then he's gonna play on this ball club.""
  * Alan Tudek (""Firefly"" and LOTS of TV) as Ben Chapman, the racist Philadelphia coach whose vile heckling of Robinson finally turns the tide. The crowd can't help but sympathize with his victim.
  * Lucas Black (""Seven Days in Utopia"") playing Southerner Pee Wee Reese, another legend who had to come to grips with his own prejudice. Eventually he tells Robinson, ""Maybe tomorrow we'll all wear a 42 on our uniforms, that way nobody will be able to tell us apart."" (This has become an annual event.)
  * Hamish Linklater (""Lola Versus"") is Ralph Branca, the teammate who tries to invite Robinson to shower with the team. The more awkward he becomes, the funnier the scene becomes.

The screening audience was entertained, thrilled and inspired, our applause was richly deserved, and we all went home much smarter than when we came in. Be sure to stay for the final credits because there are some interesting (and satisfying) postscripts.

Please take children to see what our tawdry past looked like not too long ago, or show them the DVD from Amazon when it becomes available. They will be shocked!",1365465600,87,3089,4.796226415094339

5353934,5,B009NNM9OA,"It's mind-boggling to think that within living memory someone had to be the first black player in the big leagues, and this movie does a terrific job of telling that astonishing story.  Inspirational is a good description of this film, as brave people put their careers and even their lives on the line to strike a blow at the institutionalized evil of racism in America.  Harrison Ford is terrific as Dodgers GM Branch Rickey, a man whose many baseball innovations included breaking the color battier by signing Jackie Robinson.  Chadwick Boseman is also good as Robinson, although perhaps because of the screenplay he comes across as slightly more sainted than Robinson really was.  As played by Boseman, Robinson suffers in silence more than he really did, as the real Robinson apparently could be shrill and was known to talk his own share of trash from the dugout.  It's also a bit disappointing that the film doesn't show that Rickey was not the only baseball executive trying to integrate baseball, as there were some like National League president Ford Frick who told white players threatening a boycott that they would never play in the league again--in the movie it seems like it's Rickey and Robinson against the world.  But overall this is an uplifting film, and you don't need to be a baseball fan to enjoy it, as it deals with the point where America finally began to deal with the ugly reality of racism.  This is one of those movies that every kid in school should see.",1480982400,2,1485,4.754863813229572

5354003,3,B009NNM9OA,"Pretty much just what you would expect from a movie about Jackie Robinson, minus pretty much everything that happened after 'breaking the color barrier'. It isn't a film about his career. It isn't a particularly creative film. It isn't anything special in any real way. But, it's fine in almost every way. The acting is solid, as a period piece it's fun to look at and believable, and the story moves along in a nicely paced, linear fashion.

I didn't exactly have high hopes for it as some kind of masterpiece, so it met my expectations. It didn't fall short, it didn't exceed. It was entertaining and a nice tribute to one of the most important in sports history and beyond that, American history. It just seemed a little Disney. Aside from the racial epithets, I guess. There isn't any way to rate it poorly, but I can't bring myself to rate it objectively as above average. Wonderful topic, decent film. In many ways, the fact that it doesn't try to be more is probably one of the things that makes it capable of reaching a wider audience, a benefit that otherwise might not be a plus at all, but in this case it probably is. The Disney-esque factor probably gets it out beyond the casual sports fan and young-adult as the minimum requisites for viewing and translates to a non-sports fan and even children who should get to know this great man.",1474848000,,1349,4.551440329218107

This is an entertaining, engaging movie that is good for older kids, not just for the theme but also because of the language, especially use of the ""n"" word.  There is one scene that shows an opposing team member stomp on Jackie Robinson's ankle as he crosses first base and a scary scene as a friend drives Jackie Robinson out of town because of white supremacists making threats. You see people development in Jackie Robinson's character as his team-mates begin to stand up for him on and off the field and you see a special friendship between Jackie Robinson and the Dodger's owner, Branch Rickey as Ricky encourages Jackie to remain strong and disciplined and stands beside him through every nay-sayer and racist comment and action. I would also encourage teachers/homeschooling moms to see our current situations through the eyes of Jackie Robinson, who experienced racism as much in the North as in the South.",1464566400,2,1024,4.879310344827586

5354391,3,B009NNM9OA,"Too sappy and predictable.  Maybe it should be 3.5 because the acting was excellent.  The facile writing and directing could have been much more thoughtful, sophisticated, and subtle.  It utterly failed to explore the factors that made him the man he was.  The journalist and Rickey himself were also remarkably little developed.  Perhaps the movie was so overrated because we loved and still love Jackie so much.",1456012800,,413,5.104477611940299
5354392,3,B009NNM9OA,"Everyone knows the story of Jackie Robinson it is a 5 star story no doubt about it.  But the way this film is directed only covers a short section of his playing career.  Too much of the film shows Jackie slowly making his way around the bases with the sun gleaming on his back.  As an audience we get it, he has triumphed and succeeded but the movie could have been so much more.  I love baseball movies but it was really hard to get into this one.

The movie does not really convene the real excitement of watching him play.  Many of those slow scenes would have been better off being reshot at a real time speed, thereby allowing more of the film to showcase his talent and true abilities on the ball field despite constant racial abuse from fans.  He helped turn the Brooklyn Dodgers team around from a laughing stock to a contender within a very short period of time.

The negro leagues played a much different style of baseball with more mind games and intimidation.  When a runner got on base they were a threat to steal at any moments notice.  The movie does not really show how much he aggravated pitchers and threw them off their game plans letting the hitters behind Robinson improve their batting.  Everyone I ever talked to who saw him play on TV said he was extremely exciting to watch play.

I get that the film is trying to showcase his early career making it in the major leagues and his special relationship with Branch Rickey that paved the way for all the other negro league players to follow.  And the film succeeds in that respect.  Harrison Ford does a really decent job as Branch Rickey.  Therein lies the heart of the movie it is just too bad the baseball scenes seemed so average.  Chadwick does a good job as Robinson as a filmgoer I was expecting more substance.

Overall I would rate this film 3 stars.  It is definitely a story that needs to be told and parts of the film are very good but overall it is just not as exciting as it should be.  Jackie changed peoples minds about racism by his play on the baseball field, he truly was something to behold and the film just does not quite capture that magic.  It does not really show what a great ballplayer he was on and off the field to his teammates. Maybe the film needed more action I don't know but something seems missing.

I mean if the film would have gone a little bit deeper in his career and featured some of those heartbreaking loses like the 1951 season with the Giants beating the Dodgers or all the years where the Dodgers were gluten for punishment in the World Series against those great Yankee teams.  The film could have had much more depth and emotional drama to it.  Then the final triumph of the 1955 World Series could bring the movie full circle.

I am hoping Hollywood will one day make a movie about the 1968 Detroit Tigers team or the 1967 St. Louis Cardinals.  The Cardinals with Bob Gibson, Curt Flood and Lou Brock would be an amazing subject to do a feature length film on.  The art of the steal and the intimidating pitcher mowing people down, Jackie influenced everyone.",1455753600,,3081,4.3992932862190814
5354393,5,B009NNM9OA,Did a great job overall.  My understanding is Jackie Robinson was a strong Christian and was able to withstand all he had to by way of God's strength in his life.  The movie didn't mention that.,1455580800,,194,4.361111111111111

In 1946, Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford), legendary manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, defies major league baseball's notorious color barrier by signing Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) to the team. The heroic act puts both Rickey and Robinson in the firing line of the public, the press and other players.

This movie shows the humor, and heartbreak of one of America's greatest heroes. Boseman's raw energy oozes out of every pore and with one electric stare seems to convey a lifetime of frustration from a man sick of the status quo.

The downright stubbornness to succeed with the task at hand is really something worth remembering. I am not sure how much of this is ""based on the truth"" vs. the actual truth, but it is a totally engaging movie from start to finish.  Harrison Ford is excellent, as always, as is the entire cast -- each player is quite well suited to their role.

One of the great things about this movie for me was that it really takes the viewer back in time and allows us to see as a society how far we have come in terms of our prejudices. We still have many miles to go before we sleep as far as our prejudices go, but this did make me think for a little while about the progress we HAVE made -- I tend to focus on how far we still need to go.",1438300800,,893,4.03954802259887

5354689,4,B009NNM9OA,"As a baseball fan who isn't quite old enough to have seen Robinson play, I'm still waiting to see a Robinson biopic that looks unflinchingly at the outrageous task the Dodgers' GM, Branch Rickey, asked Robinson to perform for his team and for major league baseball.  Sure, Branch Rickey/Harrison Ford tells his prospective player he's looking for someone who has the courage *not* to fight back when he's taunted unmercifully by racists -- and, as I understand it, that's pretty much what Rickey really said to Robinson.  But as a middle-aged white guy with a lick of common sense I've long suspected Rickey's ironclad job requirement is one virtually no one could have had the mettle to meet.  Robinson did his best, of course, and what he achieved in 10 seasons can honestly be called heroic.  But he also died at 53, and it's hard to avoid feeling the terrible gauntlet he ran  in the majors shortened his life.

Still, if you love baseball you'll likely get a kick out of this movie.  The only thing in it I found genuinely puzzling was John C. McGinley's performance as Dodgers radio announcer Red Barber.  As a southerner Barber likely had issues of his own working for a Dodgers team that had suddenly embarked on integrating baseball.  But McGinley unaccountably gives Barber a New England accent, which in retrospect seems somehow a way of minimizing any idle speculation the audience may have had about what this Mississippi boy may have felt about Robinson joining the team.

BTW: The real Jackie Robinson actually starred in the very first ""42"" -- a low-budget 1950 biopic called ""The Jackie Robinson Story.""  A great movie it ain't -- Robinson was never in danger of Oscar consideration -- but as a baseball curio with the man himself front and center (and a young Ruby Dee as his wife) it's absolutely worth seeing.  And yeah, it's available on Amazon instant video.",1431302400,,1880,4.786377708978328

5354709,5,B009NNM9OA,"Smack at the intersection of U.S. history and baseball lore, 42 is meaningful on both counts.  The movie shows much -- though by no means all -- of what an athletic pioneer had to go through in a country that had yet to confront the extent of its own bigotry.  From segregated water fountains and restrooms, to managers (on the field, back then, as were photographers) who were not shy about giving vent to their hatred.  The relationship between Robinson and Branch Rickey (played terrifically by Harrison Ford, who should have been nominated for an Oscar) is the fulcrum of this great story.  Nice turn, also, by Christopher Meloni as Leo (""nice guys finish last"") Durocher.  Chadwick Boseman reflects Robinson's enduring passion and dignity, and the transformation in many -- not all -- of his teammates is believable and endearing.

While the acting is superb and the film does a great job of conveying just how hostile Jackie's environment was, I was left unsatisfied with the final product. Although the scenes are great on an individual basis, they didn't flow together very well in a cohesive manner. I was also hoping to see more of the interaction between Jackie and his teammates. Overall the film is a great testament to the enormous obstacles that Jackie had to overcome to become the legend that he is today, but in terms of sheer entertainment value, I'll stick to revisiting Jackie & Me.",1427414400,,789,4.563380281690141

Review:
42 is about Jackie Robinson, the first African-American to play in MLB. The movie focuses on the struggles of Jackie Robinson who is discriminated because of his color. The movie explains what Jackie had to go through to become a professional baseball players for the Dodgers. Overall I did like the movie and its purpose.

There were a lot of things I enjoyed about the movie. I enjoyed how the movie had realistic setting and props. The props like old cars and buses really gave the feeling that the movie was actually shot at the time of the events. I also enjoyed the way the movie was shot and how cinematic it was.

Some other things I enjoyed about the movie was that there was an element of learning and morality to it. At that time most people thought of African-Americans and that is why everyone wanted to get a reaction by Jackie so that they have a reason to kick him out. But Jackie remained calm and peaceful which really came a long way for him.

In the movie there were some parts that I did not like. I did not particularly like the language of the movie. I think that the language being portrayed was not correct because I think the language and the use of words was much more terrible than advertised in the movie.

Another thing I did not enjoy about the movie was that the baseball language used in the movie was too advanced. I am not a follower of baseball so I do not know the rules that well so the movie did get confusing at times. I definitely would have preferred if the movie had less baseball references.

The acting for the most part was fantastic. Chadwick Boseman (Jackie Robinson) did a fantastic job of acting and I felt that Jackie himself was talking because the emotion felt so real. I think that all the actors also did very and really encompassed their characters.

I think that people who love a good story that really touches their heart and one that they can relate with dearly would love this movie. While some people might not enjoy this movie because it is really boring and there is not a lot of action.

My final thoughts on the movie are definitely positive. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good story line and a heart warming story. I believe this movie was amazing and it at least touched my heart while telling me the some history along with it. I would give this movie a 4.5 stars out of 5.0.",1426809600,,2402,4.3941441441441444

5354885,5,B009NNM9OA,"First I would like to say I rather play baseball than to watch baseball So, when a movie about baseball came on the scene, I automatically categorized it as something to pass up. But a friend of mine told me there was a good Christian theme presented. Really? Hollywood allowed Christians to be portrayed favorably? Has anyone checked the temperature of hell lately? Well, I was intrigued. I had to see it, and I'm thoroughly glad I did.
Jackie is urged by the Dodgers' General Manager, Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford), to not retaliate and return evil for evil but to ""turn the other cheek."" It is obvious Rickey is a Christian, a Methodist in fact, who was a good man. A good Christian man?
I still can't get over how Hollywood didn't make Rickey out to be a bigoted hatemonger who scares children and is somehow involved in a plot to persecute homosexuals and take away womens' rights to kill their unborn children. Now, where is that thermometer again?
Anyway, Jackie faces an onslaught of prejudice. The worst of it was from Ben Chapman (Alan Tudyk), the Philadelphia Phillies manager who throws out the N-word so many times and with such disdain that we are drawn into feeling the anger that Jackie must have felt. I found myself wanting to get out of my seat, walk up to the theater screen, and beat the living daylights out of Ben Chapman for his caulous, racist bigotry.
So, when the ultimate victory of Jackie's perseverance comes shining through, you're left with an uplifting feeling of satisfaction at the vindication of a man who is measured by his talent, not his race, and who did not let the worst of his accusers get the best of him.
Should you go see this movie? Absolutely.",1421798400,,1691,4.621262458471761

5354948,5,B009NNM9OA,"This was an early part of Jackie Robinson's life that  concentrated on his difficulties trying to get into the Major League when it was segregated.  It is an uplifting story that showed how one black man could do the impossible if he had the talent and the backing of one good owner who believed in him.  Even though he had a difficult time, he did not give up. He  reached his goals and became a great baseball player, overcoming the trials and tribulations that a black man had at that time in a white man's league.

This was a true story, told in a very proper and interesting way.  The film kept your interest from beginning to end. With the superb acting of entire cast and especially Chadwick Boseman and Harrison Ford, the film went further than being just another baseball story.  It showed us how we lived back then and that we could better our lives by integrating all people into our sports if they have the talent.",1420243200,,926,4.443786982248521

5354974,5,B009NNM9OA,"i started this movie knowing that number 42 was the first black man in the big leagues and met a bit, ha-ha, of resistance from a lot of sides. i don't know what age group should view this but it is a great lesson for teenagers, if not the older crowds.

Robinson starts off with a potential for anger but Branch Rickey tells him to hold it or he will confirm white people's view of blacks. he does it showing the stuff he's made of. the movie shows the slow coming around of his teammates. one fan heckles him all the time and when it doesn't stop a teammate comes out of the dugout and verbally takes on the fan.

at the end a teammate asks him why he waits until the team is done to shower alone. he tells him he doesn't want to make them feel uncomfortable, the guy grabs his hand and brings him in.

branch rickey has always been a hero to me but i had a crisis of faith at one point. rickey tells his staff that the reason he drafted a black man was to get black people to buy tickets. but maybe he told his staff that to make the pick more palatable because at the end he has a talk with robinson and you know after that he didn't give a damn about ticket sales, he wanted to integrate the league because what they were doing was unfair. great movie.",1419120000,,1257,4.060483870967742

Rated PG-13.
The only number to be retired from Major League Baseball, this once adorned Jackie Robinsons jersey when he played for the Brooklyn Dodgers. Unlike the 1950 The Jackie Robinson Story (in which he played himself), this film covers just the last portion of his play for the old Negro League and then his first year with the Dodgers farm team the Montreal Royals and his first season in Brooklyn. Branch Rickeys famous first meeting with the athlete when he challenged him to have the guts not to fight back against the torrent of racial abuse thrown at him is well dramatized, as well as short stop Pee Wee Reese's famous standing with his arm draped over Jackies shoulder when the white Cincinnati fans screamed their hatred at him. For people of faith it is good to see Branch Rickeys faith on display. Do not miss this gem!",1419120000,,840,4.6066666666666665

5355004,5,B009NNM9OA,"42 is a biographical sports film about the life of baseball player Jackie Robinson, who wore jersey number 42. It tells the story of two men - the great Jackie Robinson and legendary Brooklyn Dodgers GM Branch Rickey,whose brave stand against prejudice forever changed the world by changing the game of baseball. In 1946, Branch Rickey put himself at the forefront of history when he signed Jackie Robinson,who became the first African-American player to break the baseball color barrier to the team and also breaking Major League Baseball's infamous color line. But the deal also put both Robinson and Rickey in the firing line of the public, the press and even other players. Facing unabashed racism from every side, Robinson was forced to demonstrate tremendous courage and restraint by not reacting in kind, knowing that any incident could destroy his and Rickey's hopes. Instead, Robinson let his talent on the field do the talking-ultimately winning over fans and his teammates, silencing his critics, and paving the way for others to follow.

This story inspires and entertains with a vital chapter in this nation's history. It is a compelling, uplifting story about two men who deserve to be remembered. In addition to that,it is a compelling, uplifting story about two men who deserve to be remembered. This isn't a film filled with lights-shattering home runs like The Natural and the awkward dramatic devices are kept to a minimum. There's plenty of period action for the baseball fan, from a recreation of Ebbets Field to John C. McGinley's sterling Red Barber impersonation. Jackie is seen on the diamond, tormenting pitchers by dangling off the bases, forever threatening to steal the next bag. Also,it is really about the sport. This is a movie about a man who put on his uniform each day, stepped up to the plate and did his job at significant physical risk, in the face of hateful taunts, vicious threats and profound isolation. It's the stuff that history is made of. Definitely,an inspirational film that everyone should see.",1417132800,,2044,5.0294985250737465

This may be the reason why no Jackie Robinson film has completely satisfied me. Perhaps hes too much of a hero to be captured adequately. That being said, 42 is now my second favorite film treatment of the Robinson saga. Ken Burns documentary treatment is still my number one. 42 is sincere, solid, straightforward, stirring and sometimes soaring, even if not totally satisfying, in its attempt to tell this important story. One of my favorite things about it is the way it highlights Wendell Smiths role in what happened. Sam Lacy and Smith were like the Jackie Robinsons of sportswriting. It looks great and is well cast.

And while this was a great movie, I wish it had been longer. Harrison Ford is a trip as well, hamming it up as Branch Rickey in a role he really seemed to enjoy. While I believe that athletes (and everyone else) should be evaluated on their skill, not skin color, Mr. Robinson excelled through natural talent while encountering severe personal and private attacks simply for being one of the first black major league baseball players.",1408492800,,574,4.75

5355265,3,B009NNM9OA,"This movie, in a nutshell is about Jackie Robinson, the first black man to play pro Baseball. I don't know too much about baseball history, but it looks like he was amazing at the sport and especially base stealing. He played for the LA Dodgers and his number was 42, henceforth the name. This seems like a pretty straight forward bio-pic, with some intense scenes of racism. I actually thought there would be more racism. It seemed like it may have been toned down a bit for ratings. Still, some scenes were pretty uncomfortable to watch. I know its important to know this history, but its difficult to watch. Seeing people being treated inhumanly brings out a lot of emotions. Chadwick Boseman was excellent it and Im looking forward to seeing him in The James Brown movie. Im also not a big fan of sports movies. I would rather be watching a real game where you really don't know whats going to happen, but the game scenes were actually pretty exciting. Harrison Fords performance was interesting. I couldn't tell if the acting seemed calculated because his character was aware of the history he was making or if the actor was going for an Oscar. All in all, I enjoyed it, better than I thought I would actually.",1405296000,,1215,4.6036866359447

5355313,5,B009NNM9OA,"I seem of late to be on a baseball story spree having just reviewed director Billy Crystals homage to Roger Maris (and Mickey Mantle) in the film 61* (the silly asterisk denoting until much later that Roger had done his record- breaking deed in a 162 game season and the immortal Babe Ruths 60 in 154. Such are the number powers, statistical numbers powers, and inanities that drive sports, particularly baseball). There I noted as I do here since the time period of the film under review, 42, the story of Jackie Robisons heroic efforts to integrate major league baseball in 1947, a time before television drew crowds away, baseball was indeed something like the national pastime for sports aficionados. I also noted there that was a time before 24/7/365 ESPN all-sports-all-the-time when there were distinct seasons to sport and not so much overlapping. A time when, for example, the World Series in baseball was over before the chilly winds of November snow-delayed games in northern climes. A time when the national pastime was indeed the national pastime and life was, or seemed to be, slower, slow enough to listen or watch a game for a couple of hours or occasionally go out to the ballpark and not put a big dent in your monthly discretionary budget. Hey, if you don't believe me just as your fathers, or ouch, grandfathers they will tell you true. All this can serve as backdrop to give an idea of how controversial, how shocking in some quarters, Jackie Robinsons deed was since all previous premises in baseball were based on its displaying the white mans athletic prowess. Blacks (and Latinos, at least open Latinos unlike Ted Williams) were okay to watch the game (and in the South in the colored sections) but not to be on the same ball field as whites.

All this sports talk, baseball talk is a somewhat unusual subject for this writer to discuss since unlike almost every other kid in my growing working-class neighborhood of North Adamsville I did not play the game when I was tall enough to wave a bat or don a glove. Reason: no skill, no athletic skills (although that has not stopped generations of no skill kindred from being critical sportswriters, play-by-play broadcasters and barroom experts). Oh sure, as a kid I would  collect the baseball cards that came with the bubblegum we would cadge money for in order to go to the local mom and pop variety store and chance our luck to see if we could get Ted/Mickey/Willie/Jackie and all in our packet, and to trade our duplicates. And sure, as well, I used to flip cards against the school house wall to try to win some coveted card and also use any loose duplicates to stick with clothespins on my bicycle to make it sound like a junior motorcycle. But I did not play, did not go to professional games at Fenway (home of the 1950s lowly Red Sox) or pay attention to the game much in the newspapers (except to see how far the Sox were out of first place occasionally). I also knew, 1950s knew, that there were black baseball players around which seemed a natural thing. So it was somewhat disconcerting years later, a fact which got confirmed by viewing this fine film, when I found out that major league baseball had only been integrated in 1947. And that integration was a close thing dependent on the spunk of Brooklyn Dodgers owner Branch Rickey (played by old codger, now old codger, Harrison Ford) and one super black baseball player Jackie Robinson (played by Chadwick Boseman).

Unlike the story line in 61* where the subject entailed pursuit of a legendary record, the home run record, which captured the nations attention, or at least baseball nations attention this integration question cut to the core. Almost every aspect of national pastime baseball came into play in this integration process starting in the Mister Jim Crow South where most major leagues teams had their spring training and where, as one graphic scene showed, black ballplayers could not legally be on the same filed as whites, ditto drinking fountains, restrooms, hotels, restaurants, hell, even airline flights. And it did not get much better heading north, including in Brooklyn and, of course within the Dodger organization. Damn, no, double damn.

I mentioned in the 61* review that I would have been much more sympathetic to Maris struggle if I had known some of the details presented in the film about how the fans, hell, even Yankee fans, trashed him because they did not want to see Babes record fall or would rather have seen the Mick get it. That was kids stuff compared to what Jackie faced. This film shows Robinsons perseverance in the face of all those pressures from fans, from the parasitic sportswriters following the saga (except the lone black reporter/friend/chauffer present), and the effect it had on him personally and on his family. Funny baseball has changed a lot in the past fifty years since Jackies feat brought slews of black, Latinos and Asian players to the majors.

Unfortunately a lot of what happens in this movie when 42 takes the field almost parallels when a certain President took office.

If this is truly accurate, I'm shocked at the overt resistance Robinson received as he headed toward the majors. Harrison Ford does a great job as Branch Rickey, and Chadwick Boseman makes a convincing Robinson. Lesser parts - Chris Meloni as Leo Durocher and John McGinley as Red Barber were rather whitebread.

I was born and raised in the South, at least for awhile, and was pretty surprised to see so much nasty racism up here where I live now - in the North. Wow. It seemed to be an honest effort to show both the good, the bad and middle ground that people go through and Grow from.

42 is the Jackie Robinson Story plain and simple.  It's the story of a man who not only changed the game of baseball but the attitudes of Americans across this land.

Watching the movie was as though you'd been whisked back to the 40s to face the same grievances as Mr. Robinson.  As a viewer you were helpless.  You felt as though you couldn't convince anyone else to give the man a chance.

We've learned so much and at times, remember so little.  Thank you, Jackie Robinson for helping America find the right path.",1397433600,,586,4.576923076923077

5355387,5,B009NNM9OA,"FORTY-TWO is a ""bio-pic"" about baseball legend, Jackie Robinson. The movie is fast-paced, and there are no sequences near the middle of the picture, where not much happens (as is the case with many other movies). Despite the fact that sports movies are a popular film genre, this movie manages to avoid cliches. Every so often, one encounters a movie that has a moment, perhaps occurring at the half-way point, or perhaps near the end, that is compelling in the way it discloses a lesson in morality. TWELVE ANGRY MEN, with Henry Fonda and Telly Savalas, and MEN OF HONOR, with Cuba Gooding, are two such movies. In contrast, it is the case in FORTY-TWO that a compelling moment that discloses a gripping lesson in morality occurs at a frequency of every ten minutes or so.

This film will be of attractive to folks with the following interests:

(1) Baseball. I think that if I had a knowledge of some of the more technical aspects of baseball, that I would have appreciated this film a tad more.

(2) American history. This film would make an excellent teaching aid for disclosing events in history in the post-WWII era, that is, in the era when the baby-boomers were busily being conceived.

(3) Retro from the 1950s. This film provides excellent visuals of retro trivia, for example, colorful billboards of Schaefer Beer, Mobilgas, Esquire Shoe Polish, Texaco wings logo, Ballantine Beer, Gem Esquire Razor Blades, Buluva watches, and period automobiles. Some of these products were once icons of the American landscape, but have largely disappeared. Period urban neighborhoods were reconstructed, and these were also interesting to watch in this film.

(4) Profiles in Courage. I never read Mr. John F. Kennedy's book of this title, but Forty-Two provides an uncompromising lesson in courage. In fact, courage under fire is the most prominent theme in this movie. The following are a few quotations, which demonstrate courage, and which demonstrate thoughts of racist aggression. ""I want a player who's got the guts not to fight back"" (said by Rickey); ""If a man's got the goods, he deserves a fair chance. Ma'am."" (said by municipal worker who, at first seems to be another redneck interested in a confrontation, but surprisingly is one of the enlightened); ""He does not have the ice water in his veins to play big league baseball"" (said by redneck baseball player). ""I don't quit sir"" ""Only on yourself, apparently"" (exchange between two ball players); ""Physiologically they have a longer heel bone, gives them an unfair speed advantage"" (then Robinson bats a home run) ""Was that because of his heel bone was longer?"" (exchange between two journalists); ""leave your hat on the ground, maybe somebody will put some money in it"" (racist baiting against Mr. Robinson); ""Maybe tomorrow we'll all wear 42, that way they won't tell us apart"" (triumphant remark made near end of film); ""you . . . you let me love baseball again"" (Mr. Rickey says this to Mr. Robinson). This last comment is similar to that in AS GOOD AS IT GETS, where Mr. Nicholson says, ""You make me want to be a better man.""

(5) Cinematography. As is the case with many movies, this film can be used for teaching interesting techniques in cinematography. For example, in a scene when Mr. Durocher (a married man) is on the telephone, he is busy in bed with his girlfriend. Branch Rickey is on the other end, and Mr. Rickey quotes from the Bible, relating to all people creating equal. The phone call is about the issue of Mr. Robinson being allowed on an all-white team. At the very end of the call, Mr. Rickey quotes another part of the Bible, that teaches against adultery. This particular technique is repeated again, when Leo Durocher is again on the telephone, and when the call is ended, we hear the sound of a mosquito, and Mr. Durocher quickly slaps his hand in the air and squashes it. I am not sure what this technique is called, but it could be called, ""The technique of ending a phone call with an amusing non sequitur."" Another interesting technique in cinematography occurs where Mr. Robinson picks up a newspaper, where the headline declares a victor of the Brooklyn Dodgers. The camera points upwards, and above Mr. Robinson is an elevated urban train, and in the few seconds of this particular scene, we see a train whizzing by on the overhead tracks. I am not sure what this technique is called, but it could be called, ""The technique of adding a moving object that is customary for that particular scene.""

Conclusion. This is one of the finest movies that I have ever seen, e.g., because of its portrayal of moral lessons. But a word of warning -- the ""n word"" occurs at least 50 times in this movie. Thus, it is possible that this movie might give some people a headache. On the plus side, a rewarding aspect of the movie is the turnaround in attitude of one or two of the racist characters. This sort of turnaround is also brilliantly portrayed in two films starring Cuba Gooding,TUSKEGEE AIRMEN (the film also starring Laurence Fishburne) and MEN OF HONOR. All of these movies, that is, MEN OF HONOR, TUSKEGEE AIRMEN, and FORTY-TWO, also disclose characters who are life-long devoted racists who become even more racist as the film progresses.",1396656000,,5236,4.798226164079822

5355391,5,B009NNM9OA,"Prejudice and segregation have no place in American culture. Thank goodness for what our 16th president, Abraham Lincoln, along with the Civil War, did to set in motion a new American culture.
In the movie 42, Branch Rickey, played by Harrison Ford, team executive for the Brooklyn Dodgers, allowed his stubborn personality driven for money, to hire the first black man, Jackie Robinson, played by Chadwick Boseman who did an excellent job portraying the character, into the Major Leagues. And the turn around changed the course of history forever, that gave many minorities an opportunity to play baseball in the Major League, and cheered baseball fans ever since.
Jackie Robinson was a talented, skilled baseball player and not to be ignored. Even though it was an uphill battle for him, like going against the grain in a traditional culture, Jackie won out in the end, was successful, and cheered baseball fans. The circumstances around him did not stand in his way to play baseball.
Jackie Robinson had to be tough skinned. He refused to allow circumstances to determine his future to play baseball. His strong willed determination and character opened the door for other worthy minority baseball players to enter the Major Leagues and enjoy participating in a sport that so many other baseball players have enjoyed for many years.
42 is an edifying movie. It teaches a lot about life to all of us. Failure is never an option if a person wants to be successful. Marvin P. Ferguson, author of THE UNKNOWN BASEBALL PLAYER.",1396396800,,1524,4.95703125

5355395,4,B009NNM9OA,"I liked the story for the motive behind it.  Branch Rickey took a great chance in breaking the color barrier, but credit, too, must be given to Baseball Commissioner Happy Chandler for supporting it.  Previous attempts (including one by the Phillies) had been thwarted by previous Commissioner Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis.
No one can downplay Robinson's role in the racial integration of our society, but my purpose is not to comment on Jackie Robinson, but upon the research that was done in making this movie as historical as possible.

Not that it makes much difference, but Fritz Ostermueller, the pitcher who beans Jackie, was not a right-hander.  He was a southpaw and one of the better ones of his time.  Similarly, Gene Hermanski is introduced as a batter in the game.  He was not a right-handed batter either.  Robinson considered Leo Durocher one of his most-hated rivals after he became manager of the Giants.  Did he support playing Robinson in the lineup because 1) Rickey ordered him to do it, 2) the Dodgers had no other suitable first baseman, or 3) he believed race had nothing to do with a player's ability?  In any historical film, facts should be documented, especially if a historical figure's name is used.  Every film has errors.

It should be noted that, though Rickey did, in fact, ask Jackie to ""turn the other cheek"", the actual agreement was for Jackie to do so only for two years once he became a Dodger. The only disappointment I had in the film was at the end where Roy Campanella (1948) and Don Newcombe (1949) were mentioned as being the next Dodgers to break the color barrier, when it should have also been mentioned that just three months after Jackie signed his Brooklyn contract, Larry Doby signed with the Cleveland Indians, becoming the first African-American to play in the American League. When the Indians won the World Series in 1948 against Boston, Larry and now team-mate Satchel Paige became the first African-Americans to win a World Series. Larry was also the first player to go to the majors directly from the Negro leagues, bypassing the minor league interim that Jackie and others had to do, so I think mentioning all the pioneers of the transition would put it in a better perspective.",1393977600,,1018,4.724719101123595

5355470,5,B009NNM9OA,"We're all familiar with Jackie Robinson's story, how he was the first African-American to break the ""color barrier"" of major league baseball, making history in 1947 as first baseman for the Brooklyn Dodgers.  Yet the highly inspiring film 42 takes away the nuance of such a statement and gives the viewer the stark, brutal, ugly racism that Robinson endured--not only from a skeptical public, but from his very own teammates.  There are several scenes that are downright jarring, and through all the hostility it was Robinson himself who had to exercise herculean self-control.  (Easily the most jarring scene takes place while Robinson is at bat and simultaneously being viciously taunted by Philadelphia Phillies manager Ben Chapman, played by Alan Tudyk.)  Yet it's Robinson's playmaking abilities on the field that begin to win hearts and minds, as the Dodgers come together as a team and make their historic pennant run in the summer of 1947.  So in addition to the historical ramifications 42 is also a compelling, highly entertaining sports movie.

Chadwick Boseman gives a commanding performance in the lead role, depicting Jackie Robinson as a determined, gritty professional focused on not only making the team, but succeeding at the highest level of baseball.  Nicole Beharie is solid as Rachel, Jackie's always-supportive, constantly-worrying wife.  Yet the cast excels by veteran actor Harrison Ford's portrayal of Dodgers GM Branch Rickey, a compassionate, yet tough-as-nails pioneer determined to bring the first black ballplayer to major league baseball.  Sporting shaggy eyebrows and constantly holding a half-smoked cigar, Ford's Rickey sets the National League on its proverbial ear, and is it fun to watch.  Finally, I also enjoyed Christopher Meloni as my-way-or-the-highway Dodgers manager Leo Durocher.  Meloni gives his white players a spring training dress-down that had me grinning ear to ear.  42 has everything, from compelling drama to outstanding baseball action to absolute inspiration.  This is a film that will have you cheering from your chair.

5355478,3,B009NNM9OA,"Jackie Robinson as a superhuman archetype, standing up to fierce racism and intentional beanballs with the same level of quiet resolve and solemn dignity. It's the sort of movie that writes itself, for better and (more commonly) for worse: one dramatic figure stands against the perils of an acidic hive mind and slowly turns the tide. On the very few occasions where we see cracks in Robinson's veneer, the film is intensely interesting. That's the real draw, to me, how a fiery man struggled to tame his very loud emotions in the pursuit of an insurmountably lofty, important ideal. 42 only gives us a brief taste, sadly, choosing instead to invest its time in tired, overplayed vignettes (hey, it turns out southerners were resistant to integration) and a thin, after-school-special grade performance from its cast. Harrison Ford is a lot of fun as the brash, cocksure executive Branch Rickey, who chose to integrate MLB on his own volition, but he's so makeup caked and under-inspected that it's tough to see the role as more than just a particularly eccentric joyride. Mildly effective, with a few dashes of quality spice, it whiffed on the potential to be so much more.",1392076800,5,1175,4.909547738693467

It's about time Hollyweird made this movie.",1391817600,,343,5.218181818181818
5355483,5,B009NNM9OA,"If you're a baseball fan, this is a can't miss movie.  It accurately shows the difficulties of Jackie Robinson breaking the color barrier to be accepted in what was then a sport only whites participated in, that being baseball in the mid to late 40's.  42 is an extraordinary film on an emotional level.  Then many struggles Jackie had to overcome isn't fully shown in all its distasteful display until almost halfway through the film.  Everything up to this point is typical stuff you probably already knew.

I had NO idea a guy named Ben Chapman, manager of the Phillies at the time was such a disrespectful moron.  This actually bothers me on a personal level since the Phillies are my hometeam and I have to support them no matter what.  However, I can't possibly support this guys racist attitude and inability to stop shouting insults at a defenseless Jackie whenever he stepped up to the plate to bat.  Talk about inappropriate and obnoxious.  If a manager or player ever did such a thing nowadays he'd be fired on the spot and rightfully so.

Ben Chapman stinks!  Maybe there's a reason I didn't know about this individual despite being a huge baseball fan all these years- it's better to ignore and never acknowledge such terrible people.  I do have to warn viewers, especially African Americans- this part of the movie with Ben insulting Jackie is *extremely* hard to watch because he relentlessly and shamelessly insults Jackie by calling him every name in the book, and I mean *every* name.  I recommend ignoring the part of the movie when the Brooklyn Dodgers face the Phillies.  This is hurtful to me as a Phillies fan.  I can't support someone like Ben Chapman and hopefully nobody else would either.  Living near Philadelphia all my life, and despite the hundreds of Phillies games I've watched over the years, it is amazing Ben's name hasn't been brought up even once.  He must have been as awful as he's portrayed in 42.

Other than this, the movie shows other white players occasionally voicing their frustration concerning Jackie being a part of their team, or having to pitch against him on the opposing teams, but nothing and I mean NOTHING was as bad as Ben Chapman's involvement in that one segment.  The part with the Pittsburgh Pirates player hitting Jackie with a fastball is hard to watch too.

It's absolutely honorable that Jackie Robinson, despite being treated unfairly on numerous occasions, would get back into the game time and time again and sometimes even smile.  He was mentally a very strong person, stronger than me and perhaps most people out there.  Though he almost broke down in one segment where he walked down the stairs of the dugout and went ballistic breaking his baseball bat into pieces, he held it together with some much needed encouragement just enough to make a name for himself and become the first African American player in the history of baseball.  That's why players wear number 42 once a season every April.  Baseball players nowadays have it made in comparison to what Jackie Robinson had to persevere.  What a moving movie.

It does honestly take a while to get going and has its share of dry periods (such as Jackie's relationship with his wife which was nothing particularly interesting) but the second half completely changes all that and makes this a must-watch recommendation for baseball fans.",1391817600,2,3362,4.813588850174216

Harrison Ford gave the performance of his career. Period.

This movie had me from the opening scene, it moved me to tears of joy, it punched me in the gut with it's meat grinder raw portrayal of what really happened when the country was still in the openly acceptable throws of racial segregation and hatred and it's triumphant ending left me wanting more.

Over the years I've heard a lot of anecdotes about the troubles he had in baseball, but the movie only touches on a few of these.

5355689,5,B009NNM9OA,"It would be easy to be cynical about a movie like 42, but the best thing about this biopic of Jackie Robinson is that its not ashamed to embrace its own squareness. Indeed, it celebrates it, rendering cynicism a not very viable reaction to it or the people who made it.

The movie fits comfortably in the tradition of consciousness-raising social dramas that are often derided by critics as Oscar-bait. Garnering awards may have been the intention of those who made 42 and it may not have been, but it really doesnt matter because the movie knows exactly what its doing - and does it beautifully.

Robinson was, of course, the Negro League shortstop (later first baseman) handpicked by Brooklyn Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey to be the first African-American to play in the major leagues. Though he broke the color barrier, Robinson never saw himself as a hero or a historical figure, just a man who wanted to play ball. Like many before him and many since, Robinson never set out to change the world, but he was willing to rise to the challenge when history called upon him to do so.

But it was far from a smooth road to victory for the young man. Robinson had to weather stiff opposition from fans, fellow teammates, Jim Crow laws and the sport itself, and all this is captured effectively in the screenplay by director Brian Helgeland, which neither romanticizes the do-goodism of the action nor overstates the struggle just for dramatic effect (we are shown that there were plenty of people - both intimates and strangers, blacks and whites - who were rooting for Robinson to succeed).

In a star-making turn, Chadwick Boseman delivers the goods as the young Robinson, a man, we are told, with a sizable temper but who manages to rein in his emotions to an almost super-human degree in order to deny his goading detractors just the opportunity they're looking for to bring him down. But amidst a hail of almost nonstop verbal and racist abuse, Robinson retains his dignity by making the bigots look like fools and small-minded bullies in the long run. And it indeed was a long game he was playing, a fact that Rickey consistently reminds Robinson of when things get really bad both on the field and off. And speaking of Rickey, the real scene-stealer of the movie is Harrison Ford playing the gravel-voiced, deeply religious man whose blazing sense of justice and love of baseball converged to alter not only the sport but the world as we would forever after know it.

Helgeland has directed the film with solid conviction, often going for the small, intimate moment over the more obvious dramatic confrontation to impressive effect. Helgeland clearly trusts his material and doesnt feel the need to shout when a whisper will do. Yet even with all this restraint, whats amazing is how shocked we are to realize that all this happened a mere 66 years ago. And to see how far weve come.

And special note should be made of the scenes on the diamond, which beautifully capture the look and feel of the era and the pulse of the game.

To call this movie inspirational is not to denigrate it. On the contrary, 42 honestly earns every single tear, goose-bump and throat lump it elicits from its audience. It is truly a movie worthy of its subject.",1387411200,,3253,4.696491228070175

5355729,4,B009NNM9OA,"Brian Helgeland, known as a writer for such acclaimed works as L.A. Confidential and Mystic River, writes and directs a biographical film about Jackie Robinson, one of the most important figures in the history of the United States. Having watched most of his works, I thought Helgelands forte was in writing  especially writing noir-type thrillers  not in directing. His latest movie has changed my mind, well, almost.

Written and directed by Brian Helgeland, 42 only covers three years of Jackie Robinsons life. And what a three years! The film describes how under the enormous pressure from all directions, Jackie Robinson becomes the first African-American MBL player.

Chadwick Boseman plays Jackie Robinson, and he is credible as a legendary Brooklyn Dodgers player. Almost equally good is Harrison Ford (with a special makeup) as Branch Rickey, teams idealistic and shrewd executive signing Robinson.

Admittedly the narrative feels old-fashioned, with a series of episodes told in a conventional fashion, but it is told respectfully, about the player who stood up with the guts not to fight back. Even if you are not a baseball fan, 42 would be a moving and inspirational experience.",1386633600,,1191,5.247368421052632

The movie felt a little stiff, like everyone was afraid of messing up THE JACKIE ROBINSON STORY, the drama was lacking. Which could be a good or a bad thing, at least they didn't OVERdramatize it and Hollywood it up. But the end result is a little boring.  Harrison Ford did a tremendous acting job, disappearing into the role of Branch Rickey. Alan Tudyk did a phenomenally brave acting job playing the dyed in the wool racist manager. Chadwick Boseman looks enough like the real thing, you can very easily see him as Jackie.

But Boseman portrays Robinson extremely well and the movie's production values do a masterful job of placing the audience back in the 40s and 50s.

Moral lessons abound in the piece but the essence of the movie is to shed a bright light on the issues surrounding an African American breaking the unwritten code of entering all-white major league baseball. This is a story worthy of the best of moviemaking and every American youngster should see the movie with their parents.",1386115200,,627,4.805555555555555

5355765,5,B009NNM9OA,"We often associate the Civil Rights Movement in the United States with events such as the Montgomery, Alabama, Bus Boycott of the 1950's, and the marches on Washington D.C. of Dr. Martin Luther King in the 1960's. However, ten years before Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a bus in the segregated south, Jackie Robinson of the Brooklyn Dodgers had to endure the kind of abuse and cruelty most of us today regard as vicious, unconscionable, and even unforgivable. The heroism of Robinson is summed up by the film ""42"" which is also credits the man who decided to allow the first African-American baseball player to don a uniform of a team in the White Major Leagues, Branch Ricky. (The so-called Negro Leagues were as professional and quite profitable prior to Robinson's crossing the racial barrier.)

In the words of George Will as stated in Ken Burns' documentary ""Baseball"" Jackie Robinson, played by Chadwick Boseman in an academy-award caliber performance, was the first heroic figure of what will become the Civil Rights Movement in the United States. Robinson, according to Will, was nearly as important to the movement as Dr. King. This outstanding biopic chronicles the man who challenged current status quo while playing highly competitive athletic competitions amidst jibes, curses, and epithets. To understand what Robinson endured and still be able to compete in professional baseball at the highest levels, is no less than an extraordinary achievement in the human drama of any age of history, according to Wills.

The story is presented from three perspectives: mostly from Jackie Robinson's eyes, occasionally from his wife's (played by Nicole Beharie), and from the perspective of the man who made the controversial move, Branch Rickie, played by Harrison Ford in possibly the finest performance of his career. (My hope is both Boseman and Ford will be nominated for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor Oscars, respectively.) According to the film, Robinson had two gifts, his ability as an outstanding athlete by any standard, and his ability to take the blows of hatred without retaliation. In Ricky's words, Robinson had to be man enough and big enough to turn the other cheek, as Gandhi did in South Africa and India, and as Martin Luther King Jr and the civil rights protesters did shortly thereafter.

On one level the film is a triumph of the human spirit but also a sobering indictment of what America had been prior to the Civil Rights Movement: a racially intolerant nation. Some of the most heroic moments are when Robinson is the target of such vitriolic abuse that he nearly breaks down but finds the courage to rise and take the field again amidst the mockery of opponents and spectators. Nearly as compelling are when his teammates begin to stand up for him and point out the cowardice of his abusers. Even Branch Ricky in one memorable scene, acknowledges that he doesn't know the pain of the abuse thrown at Robinson, and he supports Robinson as if they are both enduring these tests of character together to some degree. In a poignant moment, Ricky reveals why he made the first step towards integrating White Major League Baseball. ""42"" is without question the best offering in film thus far in 2013. Hopefully, the Academy of Motion Pictures will bring deserved nominations to all the leads, and hopefully the film will garner a few wins. Robinson deserves another home run because he made American Baseball truly the ""national"" pastime rather than the segregated sport it had been.",1385942400,5,3529,4.967851099830796

This is a terrific snapshot of just one aspect of the racial divide in the late 1940's and early 50's. I showed it to my 11 and 14 year old grandchildren, and it completely captured their attention.

5355794,2,B009NNM9OA,"Unlike, other low raters who give poorly worded and abbreviated reviews, I am a Jackie Robinson historian and admirer of his life. Nevertheless, I was very disappointed in this movie.
For the simple fact, that the story represented in the movie has been told numerous times before.
And, egregiously, it only covered the the small 2 year window of years in his life and abruptly ends at the end of that 1947 rookie season he played with Brooklyn. The time that only represented when he was the abused and took his horrible treatment in silence.
It's similar to how when the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday comes around in January, his life and image is almost always represented in that ""I have a dream"" speech, when he lived for 4 1/2 more years after the March on Washington. Nothing is mentioned about his stance on Vietnam or other matters. But, I digress.
In the case of this movie ""42"", not only weren't ANY of the 25 years of Robinson's remaining life covered at all, none of the rest of his relatively short 10 year major league career was covered, either.
The REAL Jackie Robinson was a fighter. He was not a meek individual.
BEFORE Branch Rickey signed him to that contract and AFTER from late 1948 until the day he died.
It took an INCREDIBLE amount of self-control and discipline for him to ignore, survive (and thrive) from the abuse he was subjected to in those 3 or so years because it was totally out of character for him to do so.
He tolerated it because he didn't want Rickey's plan to be a failure as Robinson, literally, had the scrutiny and pressures of an ENTIRE race of peoples' hopes weighing on his shoulders.
Even, Robinson's own biography ""I Never Had It Made"", never concentrated on solely the year 1947, or even baseball, for that matter. He had many political and business involvements after his baseball career was over in 1956, as well as, wrenching family heartbreak with the death of his oldest child and namesake Jackie Jr. a year before Robinson own death of a heart attack at the, relatively, youthful age of only 53.
ALL of these heavy and burdensome factors of his life, no doubt, leading to his premature, nearly debilitating health and early death.
And, this movie did not address ANY of this (that I would have loved to see, by the way).

This movie was a primer into Robinson's life for those who, somehow, don't have any knowledge of who he was and what he went through for two years of his VERY important life. Nothing more.
The two stars is for the acting and little else because I didn't much care for what little was shown on the screen of the man's life.",1384905600,6,2601,4.545842217484009

5355830,5,B009NNM9OA,"Great movie.  Brings a limited view of history to life ""however, better than it actually was for blacks then"". It does show that life and ideas of race relations have change from the brutal and de-humanizing treatment of blacks not many years ago.",1384041600,,247,4.744186046511628
5355831,5,B009NNM9OA,"I received the movie in a timely manner at a reasonable price from Amazon. The movie is excellent. It is more than a baseball movie since it shows the racial problems in the U.S. as well as Major League Baseball immediately after World War 2. As a baseball fan, I recognized many of the names depicted in the movie. So, if you are a baseball fan, this movie is an instant classic. It has to be noted that profane racial language is in the movie to punctuate the story. At the end of the movie they mention other baseball players by name. It would have been appropriate if they mentioned Larry Doby who is the second black American to play in the major leagues. Unfortunately, his name is not mentioned.",1384041600,,702,4.407692307692308

5355845,5,B009NNM9OA,"Given it's a movie not some fact-by-fact recreation of Jackie Robinson's breaking of the color barrier, I thought the entire movie captured what it must have been like back in 1947. Kudos to the ballpark CGI recreations of Ebbets Field, Crosley Field, Forbes Field and the Polo Grounds. It really felt as if you were there right down to the outfield signage.

The scenes in the Deep South during spring training were also a little too scarily real and just as frightening seeing them on the screen close to 70 years after the fact.

The performances are terrific especially Chadwick Boseman as Jackie (he nailed down his baserunning style in the game scenes), Nicole Beharie as his wife Rachel and Harrison Ford as the Brooklyn Dodgers' general manager Branch Rickey.

There's only a Making Of extra which although decent, I'd have preferred maybe some MLB action footage of the era to fill in the gaps.",1383523200,,903,4.812903225806451

I don't understand the director's dislike toward Pittsburgh. In the movie director not only dissed the Pittsburgh Pirates over & over again, he/she even made up fictional story where the main character is witnessing race discrimination from the Pittsburgh Pirates player who wasn't known for this kind of incident.

Now with this movie and seeing the script detail some of the events that made the player, made the man you have to sit back and ask, Why do it?  The answer is he wanted to play professional ball for he truly loved the game.

The movie is one of the standouts of 2013, a clear choice in my mind for a Peoples Choice award. Further, the writing captured the essence of the times whether it was in the Deep South, north or east of the United States.

5355981,5,B009NNM9OA,"I have been a passionate fan of baseball virtually my whole life.  As a child I used to devour tales of the great baseball players of the past and the history of the game.  It goes without saying that I'm well versed in the story of Jackie Robinson's integration of major league baseball in 1947.  The significance of this event is so apparent to me that in 1997 I went to the game where my beloved Phillies retired his number with his widow Rachel in attendance.  Those who view this film won't miss the irony because the Phillies may have been Robinson's worst tormentors when he first started playing for the Brooklyn Dodgers.  Writer-director Brian Helgeland, who won an Oscar for co-scripting ""L.A. Confidential"" with Curtis Hansen, is fully aware that hardcore baseball fans and students of history know the intricacies of Robinson's ordeal and is at pains to give an accurate portrait.  The film follows Robinson from his time in the Negro Leagues until the end of the Dodgers 1947 season when they won the National League pennant.  Helgeland gets all the arcana correct but he's careful not to give us a dry history lesson.  Chadwick Boseman is fine as Robinson and he is supported magnificently by Harrison Ford as Branch Rickey, general manager of the Dodgers.  Ford's turn as the curmudgeonly Rickey is so good it would be an injustice if he weren't nominated for an Oscar.  A testament as to what a good film this is that you want more.  The running time is 128 minutes and you probably could add 20 more minutes to flesh out Robinson's story to better know this incredible man.  As a sidebar I'd like to digress and relate my reminisces when Hank Aaron was challenging Babe Ruth's homerun record in 1974.  It was an exciting time for me as a young baseball fan.  It wasn't until years later that I found out that Aaron was receiving death threats for being an African American challenging the Great Bambino's record.  This was a little less than thirty years after Robinson broke the color barrier but it demonstrated how little progress was made in a relatively lengthy stretch of time.",1381449600,,2100,4.699453551912568
5355982,4,B009NNM9OA,Branch Rickey is well played by Harrison Ford.  It is hard to believe how cruel racism was in the 1940's.  Watching Robinson run bases is exciting.  Jackie Robinson had an very strong character.,1381449600,,194,4.818181818181818

This is a good movie about an amazing man and baseball player who never gave up hope of his dream because of his love for the game, and his pride for who he was and where he came from. My family had some great discussions triggered by this movie. I recommend your whole family watch this movie together, too!

And how special he was a person, to be able to stand the hard times he had in playing  the game, and clearing the way for all players.",1381190400,,416,4.048780487804878

5356038,4,B009NNM9OA,We thoroughly enjoyed this film.  It was a wonderful story about over coming obstacles and finding one's place in the world. I think its a fine lesson in acceptance and putting aside prejudices. There are ignorant people in this world that will never accept others no matter the color of their skin.

5356098,5,B009NNM9OA,"I was born in 1944.  One of my earliest memories as a child was that of my Mom listening to Dodger games on the radio--while they were still the Brooklyn Dodgers or the ""Brooklyn Bums."".  So, it was kind of in my ""DNA"" for me to become a long-time follower & fan of the Dodgers--& a fan of Jackie Robinson & other Dodger greats.  So, any movie that was about my Dodgers was pretty high on my ""to see list.""  But there was another big reason I wanted to see ""42"":  I had some of my own pretty intense experiences with racism.  I attended an all boys high school where there was about a 60/40 racial split between whites & blacks.  Racial slurs were quite common.  Not only that, but there were racially motivated fights almost every day!  In addition, one summer, during my high school years, I had the unique experience of being the only white player playing on an all black ""Babe Ruth"" baseball team.  I saw first hand how racial prejudice can cut both ways!!  So, when the film ""42"" came out in the theaters, it was a ""must see"" film for me--both because I am a Dodger fan & because of my own life experiences with racial prejudice!  I took my adult sons to see it & we all enjoyed it & benefitted from it immensely. I decided then & there that, when the film came out on DVD, I would purchase a copy for my library..  I think that this film captures the shocking racial prejudices of the time better than anything that I have ever seen!  Personally, I also think that this was Harrison Ford's best performance of all time!  He did a masterful job portraying the owner of the Dodgers!  When discussing the problems & difficulties of bringing the first black player into major league baseball, Ford's quip about Methodists made me laugh out loud:  ""Jackie Robinson is a Methodist; I am a Methodist; and God is a Methodist!  What could possibly go wrong!!""  If you would like to see a film that exposes racism in all of its ugliness, then buy a copy of the DVD.  And, if you would like to see a film that just might expose some vestiges of racism in your own heart, then get a copy & watch ""42"" with a humble & teachable heart!

I can't believe he didn't have it much worse than that - a mouthy team manager and some unruly fans really seems pretty tame for such a high-profile figure.

Glad to know that our world today, is a little better when it comes to race relations.  We have made improvements, but there is still a lot of work to be done.  Our world is becoming multiracial.  We need to be more tolerant and accepting of others.",1379289600,,393,4.2
5356162,4,B009NNM9OA,"I like this movie! It has the same feel as Remember the Titans. The prejudice that African Americans faced just to play baseball. The courage & foresight of the coach to enlist a negro player, when it wasn't the done thing at the time, is inspiring! The courage & strength of the negro player to accept the challenge & Play!

5356167,2,B009NNM9OA,"This film, unlike the original B& W film starring Jackie Robinson had an extremely large amount of dialogue and very little about playing baseball.  This made for a very boring film.  The person playing Robinson didn't look like him and didn't have a body like him either, so it made it very difficult associating him with the baseball player.  Even the dialogue was very boring.",1379203200,,379,4.8

I know we all were not there and can never know what it took for Mr Robinson and his wife, to survive all they had to go through.

As it is, it feels like an old 80's made for TV movie. The screen writing is mundane, and soiled by excessive exposition. The actors are all capable, but their performances feel misdirected at times. And, when the screen writing is as trivial, how can the actors really break through anyhow?

The story is so epic, it's hard not to watch anyhow.",1379116800,,541,4.510204081632653

It seems that when a true character is portrayed in a movie, there is often a struggle to fully develop the character without too much conjecture about when the person experienced in private.  I found that here.  Don't get me wrong -- there were some truly powerful scenes -- notably when the Phillies coach yells that horrible, racist, hateful stuff at Jackie -- my family and I felt absolutely sick, and we could see our feelings reflected in the faces of Jackie's teammates.

5356373,2,B009NNM9OA,"So much of this story is wasted on a pointless dramatization of a season that doesn't even end with a World Series victory.  So much of the grit and stubbornness and competitiveness you know it must have taken to outlast all of the friction is glossed over with an easy smile and one little cut--the real gash was 7 inches long--out of a season that history clearly shows was one physical punishment after another.  Not a single glimpse is allowed of Johnny Wright, who also played for the Dodgers' farm system in Florida that year, or of Larry Doby, who came up with the Indians later that season, or the encouragement offered by Hank Greenberg.  Nothing of Jackie's future being the highest paid player on the Dodgers, and starring in his own movie, (better than this one for sure), and then being so competitive that even after Bobby Thomson's ""Shot Heard Round the World"" he kept watching to catch any possible slip and miss of a base so that his Dodgers might still be able to win.  And instead of the '55 World Series and being able to see everything Jackie had changed, all we get to see is a home run, not even in the clinching game of that season, as if that might stand for everything Robinson could do.",1378166400,,1213,4.475113122171946

5356387,3,B009NNM9OA,"Everything good is Methodists (""God is a Methodist""), acceptance and Jackie. To eschew any of these and you brand yourself as a ignorant, mean-spirited, ranting racist. 42 employed a double-helping of inspirational violins to swell the musical score to grandiose and inspiring heights. Each vignette, and this movie seems to have a multitude of such scenes, is played as more inspiring as the last.

There are wonderful moments throughout the film. But many of moments seem as stand alone set pieces, neither adding to nor detracting from the film as a whole. Andre Holland does an admirable job as Wendell Smith, although his position as a fairly well-off man (and very well-off black man) does detract from his hardship. And, I have to give a nod to Alan Tudyk as the Phillies manager. Although, he looked about as uncomfortable spewing that vitriol as I was listening to it.

Mr. Robinson was a great man. We should be in awe of him, his character, and his long-suffering. I truly wish the movie had stepped out its own way to let the man be inspiring. Instead, the viewers are frequently and obviously cued on when they should find awe in the story unfolding. Better movie making wouldn't have made those violins so necessary.",1378166400,,1230,4.8246445497630335

5356392,5,B009NNM9OA,"""42: The Jackie Robinson Story"" is a film anyone and everyone needs to see at least once. It is a film that will touch the heart while it brings out in the viewer every emotion there is to have. Yes the movie is about baseball and if you don't like the game please don't let that stop you from watching ""42"" because it is so much more then about that. It is about one man, Jackie Robinson, who had the chance to make a change for the good not only for the game of baseball but for the country as well and for mankind. It would be a terrible burden he would have to take in order to overcome the prejudice and stereotypes that many Americans had about blacks. Not an easy task. But for the benefit of us all Jackie Robinson was up to that task.

Of course Jackie couldn't take this on or even start this task without help to get events underway. That help would come from Branch Rickey the owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers who had made up his mind he was going to do whatever he had to break the unwritten rule that existed in major league baseball that prevented blacks from playing the game. The unwritten rule first went into effect back in 1887. Until then there had actually been some blacks who played professional baseball in the U.S. until the baseball owners got together and decided to put into place the infamous unwritten rule. What Jackie Robinson and Branch Rickey did in 1947 was to help finally break that unwritten rule and open the door for other great black baseball players to come into the major leagues.

It would not be an easy door to open as ""42"" shows. Jackie Robinson faced all kinds of discrimination, taunting and ridicule not only from the other teams in the National League but at first from his own teammates as well. It would be brutal what he went through made all the harder by an agreement he made with Branch Rickey that no matter what was done to him Jackie Robinson could not fight back. Rickey knew that there would be many people not only routing to see his idea of intergrading baseball fail but would do what they could to see it fail. That is why he needed the right person to be able to accomplish bringing an end to the unwritten rule. He would find that person in Jackie. Knowing however that those against any black man playing in the major leagues would do all they could to stop that from happening Rickey had to place the stipulation to Jackie that no matter what they said or did to him he could not fight back because to do so would give the opponents the argument they needed to stop the intergradation of baseball.

The movie ""42"" not only shows however what Jackie faced on the baseball field but what he faced outside the game as well. Especially what he would face coming to the south for the first time for spring training compared to the more open mindedness towards race he and his wife Rachel knew in California. It also showed what it did to him inside as he faced those taunts and ridicule from people who opposed him simply for the color of his skin. It would effect him greatly but with Branch Rickey's help he would overcome those who opposed him and he would go on to change the game of baseball forever.

Jackie Robinson in the movie is played by Chadwick Boseman and gives a brilliant performance. He is totally believable as Jackie Robinson and makes you understand perfectly just what Jackie went through that rookie year of 1947. Harrison Ford plays Branch Rickey and I rate this one of his stellar performances as an actor. While nowhere near the same as what Jackie Robinson went through Rickey had his own problems to encounter in bringing down the unwritten rule but nothing or no one would stop him. Just as Boseman is believable as Robinson Ford is just as believable as Rickey.

The movie itself is wonderfully directed and written to play on all your emotions as you watch it. There are certainly moment that will bring anger forth as you see events that are happening to Robinson as well as pride as he overcomes those same events to some light hearted moments on the screen which are certainly added to help the viewer have some relief from the ugliness being portrayed in the film. Being a fan of the history of baseball as well as a fan of the game itself I was aware of the story behind what took place in bringing Jackie Robinson into baseball before seeing the film and I can say this movie does a good job of showing the events how they happened to be pretty accurate. There were some minor changes here and there for story line purposes I am sure but what you see take place in ""42"" is a good account of just what Jackie Robinson went through including some of the most distasteful things that will make you cringe. From the racial taunting from the Philadelphia Phillies manager towards Jackie to the intentional injury done to Jackie in St Louis by Enos Slaughter these events really happened. Yet through it all Robinson may have bended a bit from all that occurred he never broke and kept his promise he made to Rickey.

This is a truly inspirational movie that everyone should see at least once. As I mentioned earlier it doesn't matter if you are a baseball fan or not. In the end this is not about baseball. It is about the courage one man had to face the oppression that existed to bring a change for the better for the country and for all of us regardless of what the color of our skin may happen to be.",1378166400,,5398,4.403807615230461

5356446,4,B009NNM9OA,It is sad to see how we treat each other but then again it is great to see how we can treat each other. Great movie but does have some curse words. I really enjoyed it and was touched by the strength of the real people behind the story.,1377820800,,236,3.836734693877551
5356447,5,B009NNM9OA,This is definitely a great movie. It shows a side of history that can be easily forgotten.

5356451,5,B009NNM9OA,"I really enjoyed watching this film. It portrayed Jackie Robinson as a real man with real feelings. It didn't go for the hero worship, but still cast him in a very positive light.  I also really enjoyed the fact that the Jackie Robinson story was not just about Jackie Robinson. It showed how Branch Rickey, played by Harrison Ford, and Rachel Robinson, played by Nicole Beharie, were instrumental in helping Jackie to stand through some very difficult situations.  I love baseball and I love this movie.",1377820800,,504,4.848837209302325

5356453,5,B009NNM9OA,"Loved this factually based film. All performances were excellent, Harrison Ford deserves a nomination for his portrayal of Branch Rickey, and both Chadwick Boseman and Nicole Beharie as Jackie and Rachel Robinson were fantastic!!

5356465,5,B009NNM9OA,"I saw this movie in the theaters and really loved it.  Then, when I was staying with my 10-year old granddaughter, she decided she wanted to see the movie again ( she had seen it in the theaters with her family).  Now, she's not a baseball fan nor is she a sports enthusiast but she seems to have really strong feeling about justice and equality and she wanted to see this movie about Jackie Robinson again.  I was thrilled to see I could get it on Amazon Prime.  I enjoyed it just as much the second time as the first and it was wonderful discussing the issues with a very eager 10-year old girl. (Yes, there is occasional bad language in the movie but, hey, she's 10 and she's aware that some people talk like that. )",1377734400,,719,4.226277372262774

5356468,3,B009NNM9OA,"Well as usual, if the movie is hyped up the movie is usually ok or real bad. This movie is ok. What is really surprising there have been so very good baseball movies over the years. For what reason the makers only wanted to touch on the very beginning of 42's lift in pro-baseball. Jackie Roberson was a great man and a great baseball player.",1377734400,,342,4.276923076923077
5356469,4,B009NNM9OA,"Better than I expected.  I am not a big fan of sports movies but this one was one of the better ones I've seen.

5356470,5,B009NNM9OA,An excellent and vital portrayal of history in baseball that young people are missing. This discrimination needs to be shown to be understood. Actors are outstanding too. My young nephews (11 and 15) are still talking about its impact upon them weeks after they saw the movie.,1377734400,,276,4.8936170212765955
5356471,4,B009NNM9OA,Excellent historical story of bravery and good moral character. Some of the language was rather strong though. Good acting throughout.,1377734400,,134,5.75

5356488,5,B009NNM9OA,We really enjoyed this movie. It is such a great story of what Jackie Robinson had to go through to be able to play ball. I would recommend all to see this.,1377734400,,156,3.90625
5356489,4,B009NNM9OA,"This a compelling story of the triumph over racism. The film portrayed the story accurately. It was very well produced. The baseball scenes were convincingly acted. Harrison Ford played the role of Branch Rickey exceptionally well.
It was great family entertainment; it certainly raised the appropriate questions from our grand children, who are 16, 14 and 11.
We all thoroughly enjoyed this movie.",1377648000,,398,5.333333333333333

5356492,4,B009NNM9OA,"I was so impressed, first, by the love of his wife, and second how he lived up to his word by not reacting to the racial slurs and threats and the actions of ignorant and frightened raciest. What a baseball player. My Dad played with a Yankee farm team before moving to Texas where we first listened to the games on the radio and then  watched them on TV and I certainly remember seeing him play along with PeeWee Reese and the rest of the ledgends. This was just one of the many stories to emerge from our National Passtime. What a well scripted and well acted movie.",1377561600,,568,4.2592592592592595

5356496,4,B009NNM9OA,"This was a lot of fun to watch, and pretty solid. It isn't Oscar material or anything, but it's a great family watcher. There are moments where the movie seemed to sensationalize quite a bit, and draw on things that may or may not have happened, just to express the status of the times. It works in some areas, and in others not so much. So it could have been better, but that does NOT mean it is a bad movie. Definitely worth your time.",1377561600,,437,4.152941176470589
5356497,5,B009NNM9OA,"Should be seen by everyone, particularly the youth in our country.  This film will give them a first hand experience of what racism is all about and how it can be conquered.  Not to mention that the story is great in and of itself.",1377561600,,231,4.2272727272727275

5356507,5,B009NNM9OA,"Jackie Robinson has always been a hero of mine for his integrity, incredible character in the face of hatred and inner strength.  This wonderful movie plays like a dramatic documentary of Jack Roosevelt Robinson's path to the major leagues and into the annals of social/civil rights history. The film, 42: The Jackie Robinson Story features Chadwick Boseman in the title role.  Boseman brings tenderness, strength, enthusiasm and hope to the historical man and presents him as a man who pursued his dream and was willing to play a role in a drama orchestrated by Branch Rickey.  Harrison Ford is amazing as Branch Rickey down to his gravel voice.  The two men bring the love-able losing Brooklyn Dodgers to the forefront by having a previously untried plan to integrate the national game of baseball.  Along the way, they find inner strength, fight society, deal with hate and seek to see this experiment to its end.  This is an amazing drama set against the baseball world of the 1940s.  Watch this with your children and family.  It is an amazing film.

I expect this film to garner several oscar nods next year.  Look for Chadwick Boseman, harrison Ford, the director, the screenplay and the film all get Oscar nods",1377475200,,1218,4.840579710144928

5356510,2,B009NNM9OA,"This is the 3rd movie on historical baseball I've seen in the past few months and the lowest on the list. This one was the most Hollywood in terms of photographic quality, etc. and the most difficult to follow and understand the story line. The scenes were disjointed and for someone who did not already know the story, difficult to follow. This is a story worth knowing; however, it did not hold the interest of myself and the others who were watching it with me - we were bored and confused through most of it. A ciouple of times we thought about just turning it off - and ultimately didn't because we had paid to rent it.  Too long.",1377475200,,635,4.336134453781512

The acting in the film is above and beyond each character is portrayed with a depth and humanity that brings forth such emotion to the viewer that you are wrapped in the film from the beginning to the end.  Harrison Ford is one of my favorite actors, and in this role he overwhelmed me with his portrayal of Branch Rickie.  Jackie Robinson is a true civil rights hero, and one that should be recognized as such.  this movie tells the story in a manner that is befitting to his life lived and the struggle that he endured to bring forth equality.",1377216000,,588,4.36697247706422
5356573,4,B009NNM9OA,"Love this movie, and happy to find it in a combo pack for a great price.  The only let down was the digital version.  It's a UltraViolet Digital Copy, which I didn't previously know means that it's pretty much a copy in the cloud.  That's nice if you want to watch it at home, and not take up space on your device.  But when traveling, I'd like to be able to access it without an internet connection.  Apparently there's a way to do that, but I'm tech savvy, and I haven't yet found an easy way to do it.  The instructions on the site were convoluted, and involved downloading a program that immediately installed itself plus some bloatware;  a new search bar, it changed my home page, etc.  Completely annoying, so I uninstalled and haven't addressed the downloading issue again.  We'll see if I take the effort to figure it out again, or if I chalk it up to lesson earned.  The annoyance of the UV copy dings this a star.",1377129600,,923,4.345029239766082
5356584,5,B009NNM9OA,"The casting, acting, and script writing were all outstanding. Despite at times being quite disturbing during its true to life depictions of racism, this movie is enriching for the entire family. This is a movie to learn from, not only the history of what it was like to face such racism and hatred, but what it means to sacrifice comfort and ease to achieve monumental things.",1377129600,,376,4.712121212121212

5356586,5,B009NNM9OA,I love this movie.  However Amazon instant streaming cut out on 10 separate times for 13 to 30 seconds.  This is not acceptable.  I have a very high speed broadband connection.,1377129600,,176,4.612903225806452
5356587,5,B009NNM9OA,This was an interesting movie that deals with what has happened during my lifetime.  At 84 I realize that Jackie led the way and faced a lot of trials.  I wish that we were farther along at accepting African-Americans as equals; although we are farther than I ever would have predicted but there is still far too much discriminatiion.  This movie makes no attempt to sugar coat Jackie's challenges.  As a teen-ager I used to listen to Red Barber broadcast the Dodgers--long before he went to the Yankees.,1377129600,,504,4.693181818181818

5356593,5,B009NNM9OA,A wonderful reminder of a great baseball player and an important reminder of segregation and what it did to our country. Harrison Ford was unrecognizable and terrific. Its a good film for families with children over the age of 12.,1377129600,,230,4.775

Love it!",1377043200,,300,4.189655172413793
5356609,4,B009NNM9OA,Wish they had touched deeper on the civil rights and less on some of the fluff.  They could have shown how truly ugly the U.S. was back then. Where a man who fought for his country was held in shackles by it.,1377043200,,208,3.9523809523809526

Celebrate the courage and foresight of these brave men.",1377043200,,137,5.85
5356625,5,B009NNM9OA,What a great baseball movie. It really makes you aware of what the civil rights movement was marching for. Baseball is the focus and during that time ordinary people with certain intentions changed and rose to the occasion achieving a higher level of thinking as human beings. From a historical perspective my kids now understand why I find a certain word offensives no matter who sings it and how melodic. You can smell the dust and feel the thrill of the game throughout this movie. I rented first then bought it to share.,1377043200,,524,4.645161290322581
5356626,5,B009NNM9OA,"I love this movie!  To see what he went through (and others as well) is so touching!  How he set the mark is remarkable.

5356628,5,B009NNM9OA,"I'm not a big sports fan, but I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  The acting was terrific and the story was well written.  At first I thought it was a little too Hollywood.  That is not really portraying how very difficult it must have been for Jackie to be the first black man in the major league.

Bravo !!!!!",1376956800,,177,4.46875
5356654,5,B009NNM9OA,"I loved that the story revealed how, despite hardships, black people succeeded, and without the help of quotas and set asides. My favorite scene was when Mr. Robinson met his newborn son and vowed to be the father to him, that he never had.  What an example for boys of all color who need to know that real men marry the mother of their children and taccept the responsibility to raise and provide for their own children instead of letting the government do it.",1376956800,,461,4.488095238095238

5356656,4,B009NNM9OA,"The Jackie Robinson story is a legend in American history, as the first African american major league baseball player faces almost insurmountable prejudice and racism as he proves his character with his actions on the baseball diamond.  The story earns five stars.
The overall direction and screenplay earn a very good four stars, as a real story that might have been gripping and heart pounding, comes up short in the emotional connection to those that may not know the full story of this heroic American hero.",1376956800,,511,4.941860465116279

The movie isn't over or under the top, it's just right in showing the issues faced by a black man in the major league in the last half of the 40s.  You know pre-70s/80s when blacks had to use separate bathrooms, water fountains, hotels/motels, cities.

It's incredible to me that these things happen, but it's even more incredible to see how two great men turned it all into a positive!

Just as incredible as the story of Jackie Robinson, is the story behind the story of Branch Rickey.  A man who instinctively knew how to handle and manage the situations of racist behavior that Robinson encountered.  Rickey told Robinson that he can't get mad, he can't fight back.  This way the reporters won't be talking about how Robinson lost it. Instead, the reporters would be talking about the foolish behavior of the racists!

Jackie Robinson, and Branch Rickey are national heroes, and this movie portrays them brilliantly!",1376697600,,1097,4.9021739130434785

What is not explained is almost better than the veneer; I'm not believing for a minute that money was the sole motivation for placing Jackie Robinson in major league.

5356825,4,B009NNM9OA,"42 is a movie about the life story of Jackie Robinson and his history-making signing with the Brooklyn Dodgers under the guidance of team executive Branch Rickey.

This movie does a great job at telling the story of integrating baseball back in the late 40's with story acting and a powerful storyline.  Growing up many decades after this, I had always known about Robinson but never knew the whole story and all the things he went through during the time he joined the majors.  Growing up in a different era, I cringed at the frequent use of the ""N"" word that was used throughout the movie but it was effective at presenting the racial hatred and ignorance that existed back then.

Both Boseman and Ford do commendable roles as Robinson and and Rickey.

The story is honest, respectable and inspirational in its storytelling and shows how a hero should react to ignorance because then it proves them all wrong.",1376524800,3,911,4.70440251572327

The casting was brilliant, and I'm so glad that they cast a lead that wasn't real famous. I think it made it more believable that he really was Mr. Robinson.

5356944,4,B009NNM9OA,"Though I'm not even a baseball person, I found ""42"" an utterly compelling and vividly realistic film. The level of empathy the audience attains with Robinson in all the adversity he faces is quite acute. Really fine acting by virtually all of the cast, but most particularly Chadwick Boseman as Robinson, Harrison Ford as the team owner with a most revolutionary idea, and Alan Tudyk as racist Phillies manager Ben Chapman. A fine and convincing script also helps to make this film the success that it is.

Still, the scope of the film has its limitations. ""42"" would have been enhanced by a more all-inclusive biography of Robinson in regard to his earlier life and service in WWII. While in high school and junior college, Robinson excelled at four different sports: Baseball, basketball, football, and track. Some revelation of why he sought to play in the then highly racist--even for that time--Major Leagues would have been a plus. Instead of simply having one of the characters tell us that, while serving as an army officer, he had been court-martialed for refusing to move to the back of a military bus, it would have been nice to see that happen via flashback. The directors let it be known that Robinson had a fiery temper. More illustration of this quality--and how/why he was forced to restrain it under circumstances that would have tried the most saintly patience--would have made ""42"" even better.",1376438400,,1413,4.8875

5356946,4,B009NNM9OA,"42 carries a few key messages for the human race: it's a true story of one man overcoming incredible odds and adversity to blaze a trail for common dignity and equal rights. It also depicts how love and friendship can prevail over hate and bigotry. Most of us know the Jackie Robinson story, and how his courage and poise helped him successfully break the color line in baseball, thus paving the way for the civil rights movement. This film focuses on the period of 1945-47, in which Jackie is sought after by Branch Rickey and eventually gets to play for the Brooklyn Dodgers. At no time is Jackie's journey a pleasant one, and this film emphasizes it. Harrison Ford does a stellar job of playing Rickey, who's religious and philosophical, and provides Jackie with a calming presence and guidance. Jackie's wife (Rachel) is played magnificently, as she was always the graceful and strong woman, and keeps his spirits up throughout his turbulent times. This movie isn't top-notch, but still good. It would've been more interesting to have a more comprehensive movie about Jackie, rather than just a two year period, but I understand why it was told that way.",1376352000,,1158,4.824120603015075
5356947,3,B009NNM9OA,"While I'm glad someone made a movie about this important time, the acting comes up a bit short.  Harrison Ford was excellent, other lead characters were better than average, but few of the ancillary actors offer additional dept to the story.

This movie shows even more what a truly strong, brave, stalwart pioneer he was in breaking the race barrier in Baseball.  This movie does a good job in showing racism among both the blacks and whites, as well as those who wanted racism to stop.  The evolution of the team members was wonderful to watch.  The strength of Jackie and his wife in facing the public was inspiring.  The owners of the Dodgers was truly a wonderful man; blunt, sympathetic, hard-working, spiritually strong, supportive, not putting up with racism within the team.  I watched this the other day and told my daughter-in-law it would be a great movie for my 13-year-old Grandson to watch.

Now, I know that he was very brave and courageous.......as was his wife...his heart!  But Branch Rickey was part of this driving force, too.  I have no doubt that Mr. Robinson would have made his mark but the encouragement that Mr. Rickey gave him helped to spur him on.  This is a story in some ways of both men.

5356982,5,B009NNM9OA,Great depiction of a great story. This made us all look back on an ugly side of the good ole days. Harrison Ford was terrific as Branche Rickey. The scene with the Phillies manager was chilling.,1376352000,,194,4.416666666666667

Not being an African American adult I really love these movies and books about how the special people that brought us to where we are today in 2013 as Americans is such an enjoyment and moving emotion can't say everything about how I felt about this movie cause it wouldn't all fit in the comments box. So the bottom line is WOW GREAT MOVIE WHAT A HERO IN HIS LIFE NOT JUST BASEBALL!!!!!!!,1376352000,,469,4.340909090909091

This one dealt with the undeniable fact that, there were a lot of good-hearted White, as well as Black guys involved. It also showed Jackie Robinson as a guy who just wanted to play baseball; not as a crusader against the ""evils"" of America.
Basically, to me, it was a good, American story of a man who just wanted his fair chance, and who, although facing idiots along the way, didn't quit.
Isn't that an All-American story? It was to me.

It's hard to imagine the stress and hardship JR had to endure, but he did. An incredibly tough person with a heart of gold, he changed the world of sports and the country forever. He was a pioneer that founded new paths for others to follow. JR and the owner were ahead of their time and they change the world. Thank you.",1376092800,,552,4.216981132075472
5357025,4,B009NNM9OA,"Everyone knows that Jackie Robinson was the man who broke Major League Baseball's color barrier in 1947, but few know why he was the one that was chosen. Robinson wasn't the best black player out there, he wasn't even a superstar, what he was, was well educated and understood that people attacked him out of fear and ignorance. He never took it personally and knew fighting back would accomplish nothing, and against all odds, no matter what was thrown at him, Robinson was able to brush it off. In 42, he's portrayed by newcomer Chadwick Boseman, who wasn't just fantastic, but also gracious for the opportunity to portray a true American hero. I am a big Jackie Robinson fan and through everything I've seen, Boseman has given the most clear and accurate portrayal of the man to date. His co-star is Harrison Ford, playing the legendary Branch Ricky. Throughout his life, Ricky was outspoken against segregation and didn't just help in breaking baseball's color barrier, eight years later, he broke the Latino barrier as well. What I love about Harrison Ford is that he's so predictable, you know you will always get a tremendous performance out of him and that he will go to extreme lengths to be as real to the story as possible. This film was outstanding, from top to bottom, but my one knock on 42 is that it didn't go beyond the 1947 season. Robinson played for nine years after that and was a key member of the civil rights movement after baseball. I would have liked to have seen how in 1955, at age 36, he led the Dodgers to their only championship in Brooklyn, with an improbably steal of home against the Yankees. I also would have liked to have seen how he became the first black broadcaster, or how he marched with Dr. King in Washington. 42 is one of the clearest, most accurate depiction of two years in the life of Jackie Robinson, and while it was terrific, I would have like to have seen them take it a step further.",1376092800,2,1936,4.5501432664756445
5357026,5,B009NNM9OA,"The compelling story of Jackie Robinson's rise to a star at the Brooklyn Dodgers was historically accurate, with of course a director and screen writer's license to keep it interesting.

Harrison Ford's part was totally out of the ballpark - a home run.",1376092800,,357,4.868852459016393

5357067,5,B009NNM9OA,"With a smedgeling of inaccuracies (such as ""I-24"" in Missouri, or multiple individual in the Dodgers contract signing) that are included in most biographical films, ""42"" is an inspiring movie for baseball fans, and for players, managers and coaches of all ages and all the way from tee ball to MLB! It definitely provides many accuracies of what obstacles that Mr. Robinson had to face on his way to the Major Leagues. Veteran actor Harrison Ford does a terrific portrayal of general manager Branch Rickey, the man whose foresight had previously be instrumental in establishing the Minor Leagues during his tenure in St. Louis. For time and attention sake, his initial meeting with Robinson @ Ebbett Field is miniscule to the actual three hours of racial slurs and epithets he barraged Jackie with, per the info of the late legendary broadcaster Red Barber. Both men are to be greatly admired for their courage, going against the notion of ""baseball being a white man's game"" up to 1947. The Ben Chapman incident is spot on regarding the verbal abuse hurled at Robinson. Chadwick Boseman does an excellent portrayal of Robinson, and the computer animated images of stadiums long gone in Brooklyn, Pittsburgh and Cincinnati are excellent!

I did learn more about Branch Rickey and Harrison Ford did a wonderful job, if accurate.  I appreciated that the writers didn't really take sides.  People of all colors can be jerks and wonderful.  We still have a ways to go as a society, but we are probably better than most countries.  My wife does not enjoy baseball games, but she liked this movie.  As with most baseball movies, the play is hard to make realistic, but that is not the main story here either.  The man deserves all the accolades he is afforded.",1376006400,3,726,4.488549618320611

5357113,4,B009NNM9OA,Good Acting but if you know the story it's 100% predictable.  I think this move is more for people that don't watch baseball and would like to learn a little bit about who Mr. 42 was.,1376006400,,183,4.083333333333333

5357117,1,B009NNM9OA,"Was Jackie Robinson an admirable human being with a good story to tell? Of course. Does this movie tell that story? Nope.

You can see every scene coming from a mile away. There was racism in the 40's??? Noo!!!! You learn NOTHING about Jackie as a person. It's just a series of soap opera anecdotes cut and pasted together, drenched in schlock and sappiness. ""You go out there and show them, Jackie Robinson!"" kind of deal. And if there's ONE lesson that this movie does pound to death, it's that Jacki would be a nobody if it weren't for all the generous white people who graciously helped him. Mediocre shrivel, blandly shot, insipid from start to finish. I'm a huge fan of Brian Helgeland, but this is just a Hallmark movie having a baby with a lifetime movie via BET and then multiply that horror by 1000. Sap, sap, sap, corny sap all the way through. Completely unnecessary, boring and corny.",1376006400,7,897,4.571428571428571

After watching it I'm very disappointed.  The movie was good and everyone should watch it, but I felt like they tried to turn it into a feel good story.  What he had to go through was bad and I don't think they did a good enough job of portraying that.  Most of what happened was just name calling and barely even referenced any death threats.  Good move overall but I wanted more.",1375920000,,529,4.137254901960785

It is a true story. You will cry, laugh out loud, be sad and be glad.  Inspirational in that Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Bozeman) and the team owner (Branch Rickey) - played by Harrison Ford - Robinson's wife (Nicole Beharie) gives you a higher plane of existence and the rewards that comes with this approach to life; each for his own reason, and in the same vein as well. Racism is a big part of this movie.... it very truly and realistically explains the truth of the times and the sadness of its existence. But that is only a part of the plot... also are the cultural ways of the times, how love and devotion can inspire one to become 'better', how friendship can scale heights not common to man, with an altruistic reason, due to problem that had plagued the owner of the team for years.
Now for the actors and their parts: Chadwick Bozeman, Harrison Ford and Nicole Beharie are excellent in their portrayals!!!  Most of the crew are well suited for their respective roles.  You get the cast's parts broad scope of mankind and the type of attitude their individual lives has brought them to.  Existing alongside each other, with differing takes on how life 'should' be,  is another deep seeded part of this movie.

The script was good, the casting spot on, the acting very good and the historical significance excellent.  It was about Jackie Robinson, who, it goes without saying, earned tremendous respect as the first African-American baseball player to break through the color barrier of the major leagues, but it was also about racism in this nation and about the men and women who were determined to do the right thing.  And it was about baseball, America's favorite pastime, some of it's proudest moments and some that were not-so-proud.  I am enamored of this movie and will certainly watch it again.

5357272,4,B009NNM9OA,I like real life movies and it was sad that the people 70 years ago were the way they were. people now can see how far we have come and that we don't have that far to go to get things right.,1375401600,2,190,3.5476190476190474
5357273,5,B009NNM9OA,I love baseball and this movie reminded me of some of my favorite movies about Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth.,1375401600,,104,4.25
5357274,4,B009NNM9OA,"now this movie i did watch all the way and
it really shows the way things used to be
back in the day but if it was not for jackie robinson
there would of never been a willie  mays or
barry bonds he really showed sportsmanship
in the game of base ball and changed the way people
would think about the game",1375401600,,304,3.903225806451613
5357275,3,B009NNM9OA,"Interesting with regard to the history, but the movie itself was just okay.  I'd recommend waiting for it to be played on cable over paying anything to watch this.",1375401600,,163,4.620689655172414
5357276,4,B009NNM9OA,Amazing one of a kind true to life story!! Truly a very inspiring and motivational sports movie! A must see!!!,1375401600,,110,4.55

5357278,5,B009NNM9OA,"I really enjoyed watching '42'. It was well acted and didn't have foul language, violence, sexual scenes that seem to have become the common Hollywood filth that we see so much these days. I highly recommend this movie.",1375401600,,219,4.7894736842105265
5357279,3,B009NNM9OA,"The movie was put together nicely. It just never had much of a punch to it that I was looking for. I never felt that J. Robinson did amazing things in his career other than break through racial barriers. Which is historic, don't get me wrong. The movie never made us forget how his struggle continued with that. I don't know much about the man to be honest, I'm sure he did some outstanding things on the field and in life, but, it never came across to me in the movie. I think they could've shot other scenes that weren't so repetitive. I hate to compare it to The Natural, but I felt more inspired by that film by far and on a baseball level, and I don't even care for the sport all that much.",1375401600,,695,4.117647058823529

5357292,5,B009NNM9OA,This movie was so good. Way better than I expected it to be. I suggest you watch this if you enjoy true stories and Harrison Ford. This was such a motivational movie. I would see it again.,1375401600,,188,4.108108108108108

5357294,5,B009NNM9OA,I truly enjoyed this film. It was accurate historically and the acting was awesome. Harrison Ford should get an Academy Award nomination.,1375401600,,137,5.2727272727272725
5357295,5,B009NNM9OA,"42 moves ahead of The Natural as my favorite baseball movie of all time.  Will always have a special place in my heart for Roy Hobbs, but this well-told story about the real-life natural, Jack Roosevelt Robinson, is a cut above all the rest.",1375401600,,241,4.4772727272727275
5357296,5,B009NNM9OA,This was a very inspirational and thought-provoking film that I would highly recommend for anyone interested in issues of social justice  or baseball lovers that want to learn more about the history of their sport.,1375401600,,214,5.114285714285714
5357297,5,B009NNM9OA,I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Robison when I was just 8 years old.  He and the other team members were autographing a new Rawlings glove I'd been given - well . .  the memories of those days and that day came back in Technicolor. I and my family loved this movie and the many happy days around Ebbits Field.  Baseball and players like Jackie made the game a wonderful experience.  Thanks,1375315200,,391,4.315068493150685
5357298,4,B009NNM9OA,"Really enjoyed this story.  The actors did an outstanding job of bringing  the characters to life.  The baseball scenes were fantastic, in that they beautifully recreated old ballparks like Ebbets Field and Crosley Field.  It looked as if these scenes were actually shot in the old ballparks----amazing.

I dropped the movie a star because the ending just sort of went thud.

Highly recommended.",1375315200,,395,5.190476190476191
5357299,5,B009NNM9OA,Beautifully written and portrayed. It was good to see the human struggle of Jackie Robinson. He is typically portrayed as just this jovial guy but anytime you are the one breaking new ground there is struggle. I appreciated the reality of the movie and the depiction of the change of attitude when his team mates got to know him as a person and player. I also thoroughly enjoyed Harrison Ford's portrayal of the owner who had the courage to make a bold move. Great movie showing how great courage means not fighting back but being who you are and doing what you were created to do with your life.,1375315200,,596,4.477064220183486
5357310,5,B009NNM9OA,"42 is not only a great sports movie but it is also a well-executed look at racism in this country. The actors did an amazing job of telling Jackie Robinson's story - the good, the ugly, and the uglier.",1375315200,,201,4.17948717948718

5357313,5,B009NNM9OA,"The movie was great, but missed the discussion of how the establishment baseball press -- the Sporting News and Baseball Magazine were hostile to Robinson.  It also failed to mention the effort by 15 of the 16 clubs to get Commissioner Chandler to void the contract with Robinson.  Chandler refused to do so and it cost him reelection as Commissioner.  He was succeeded by Ford Fricke, who was the author of the petition by the 15 owners,",1375315200,,438,4.662337662337662

5357315,5,B009NNM9OA,"This is a movie each of us should see .. I've always so admired Jackie and his career . . 42 treated the story with dignity and truth . Shocking and deeply moving .. Was moved to tears often ., the casting was pitch perfect ( couldn't resist the pun!) . As I adore baseball the viewing experience was amazing !!'",1375315200,,312,4.131147540983607

5357317,5,B009NNM9OA,This is a great movie depicting Jackie robinson's entry into professional baseball.  Covered his minor league history as well as his first year in the majors.,1375315200,,158,5.076923076923077
5357318,5,B009NNM9OA,WIsh that people would stop and take a look at the well dressed and respected people that this movie so well exemplifies! Great movie for young people to watch!,1375315200,,160,4.551724137931035
5357319,5,B009NNM9OA,What a great movie. I grew up on the ballfields and this movie will reignite the flame for your love of the game. Even if you don't like baseball it's a legendary story of human courage and a testament to how far this world truly has come at a time when many people seem to doubt it. Give it a watch. You won't regret it. Ps. Go Braves!!!!,1375228800,,339,4.0
5357330,5,B009NNM9OA,"This is a true story about Jackie Robinson, the first Black baseball player in the national league,in 1947.  The abuse he endured was horrendous. At first, his team mates signed a petition that they would not play if there was a Black player. Other teams refused to play against a team with a Black player, but gave in, they had to play.

Eventually, his team accepted him and appreciated his great talent.  Very few people in this country accepted him.  The whole team was not allowed in hotels, etc. because they had a Black player.

A runner knocked him off first base, that happens, but the runner stomped on his leg with the sharp spikes on his shoe,doing enough injury to require stitches. His team mates ran to him.  One teammate told the pitcher to hit that runner in the head his next at bat.  Jackie said no, make an out,the game's too important for that.

A baseball player needs his legs, but Jackie played through the pain.

There were threats on his life, threats on his baby's life.  He was called every name in the book, and kept his cool. He was a tremendously gifted athlete who broke or set records on a regular basis.  He was often the player who made his team win, his runs and home runs. In 1997, Major League Baseball ""universally"" retired his uniform number, 42, across all major league teams; he was the first pro athlete in any sport to be so honored. It only took 40 years.

I so admire the people with the courage to make a difference in the civil rights horrors of the '60's.  I know I do not have that courage.",1375228800,,1540,4.3992932862190814
5357331,4,B009NNM9OA,"I like this movie and liked the actors that played in it.  Glad most of the actors were not superstars, most are not so well known actors, it lent to allowing the story to be top billing as oppose to the actors taking top billing.  It helped that Chadwick Boseman is a nice looking Jackie Robinson with some similarities.  Though Harrison Ford is a box office star, he played his part well and modestly. I Enjoyed this movie.",1375228800,,425,4.423076923076923
5357332,4,B009NNM9OA,Excellent portrayal of a shameful time in American and baseball history. Tugs at all the heartstrings and builds on the feelings of outrage generated by the injustice shown towards Robinson. Harrison Ford is great as Branch Rickey. I did not think of Star Wars once.,1375228800,,266,4.933333333333334
5357333,3,B009NNM9OA,"Great history lesson. Seemed watered down. I""m sure things were much rougher than depicted. Overall a great movie but a little too long, especially for the young audience it was edited for.",1375228800,,189,4.9375

5357337,5,B009NNM9OA,"Great story wonderful actors! Wishing I wouldve bought it instead of renting it! A movie that you can sit and enjoy with your family without worrying about language,violence or demons theres definitely a challenge in creating solid stories these days.",1375228800,,251,5.3
5357338,5,B009NNM9OA,"Being of the age and from that portion of the country were racism was both rampant and accepted I could easily relate to this movie.

Being in that position taught me some of the greatest lessons of my life.",1375228800,8,340,4.557377049180328
5357339,5,B009NNM9OA,"Love the subject matter as i have been a consumer of baseball history from this era for a while. Acting is excellent. Harrison Ford plays a very good Branch Rickey. Wished they would have gone further into his decision, where he made it, and waht went into it. Also, wish the movie didn't make it seem like the racism Jackie faced was only for one year or with one particular opponent. It was a long time before these things changed. But, for what it did show, it was an excellent movie. Hopefully, it will inspire more people to study the period, how much baseball was part of the fabric of society then, and the integration of baseball on a broader basis.",1375228800,,657,4.43801652892562

We all enjoyed it, although son and husband thought it was a little slow (what a surprise, guys wanting more action in the movie).  I was a surprised that I liked it, because I hate baseball, and am wary of ""inspirational"" stories, but Jacki Robinson is a great story.",1375228800,,332,4.253968253968254

5357385,5,B009NNM9OA,A script that does justice to the important moment in baseball when the first black player was brought into a major league team. A carefully chosen cast led by the talented Chadwick Boseman. The best role to date in Harrison Ford's career - an Academy Award for him perhaps?,1375228800,,274,4.612244897959184

5357388,3,B009NNM9OA,"Enjoyable, moving from scene to scene. Very well acted by the main lead and the actress who plays his wife. Ford's performance is pretty convincing, but the part is simplistically written. Photography, production values, support a very convincing recreation of the period. But overall, too understated. The big moments lack dramatic punch. The music is overdone. The writer-director, who co-authored the screenplay for the great L.A. Confidential, and who wrote and directed Payback, a very amusing criminal revenge tale, seems worried about going too far. You end up not really getting a sense of the civic meaning of what Robinson did. The filmmaker, for example, could have drawn a parallel with Gandhi, a contemporary  who also used non-violent resistance to change history.  Nor do you really understand Robinson's simultaneous achievement as a super all-around athlete of the mid-twentieth century. This movie doesn't capture baseball as a team sport and cultural phenomenon, as well as, say, Major League. So: good effort, laudable intentions, but kind of ho-hum.",1375228800,,1070,5.4397590361445785

5357390,5,B009NNM9OA,My husband and I enjoyed this movie and the issues it dealt with that could be used in today's situations.

Harrison Ford is terrific!",1375142400,,347,5.160714285714286

It might be a fun drinking game -- to see if you can guess what a character is going to do or say to express the emotions of the scene.  Will he break a bat to show his frustration? Oh yeah! Chug chug.  With so much rich history and complex characters in this story, this movie didn't even get to first base.",1375142400,2,453,4.183908045977011

5357411,3,B009NNM9OA,I enjoyed the movie especially the historical elements. It lacked drama and left the movie a little flat. Harrison Ford is one of my favorite actors. Playing Mr. Rickey was not his best role. Someone else should have played that,1375142400,,228,4.725
5357412,5,B009NNM9OA,Great movie.  Very inspiring and humbling when you can see/feel what others have had to go through just to be treated equal.

5357416,4,B009NNM9OA,"The story of integration into baseball is well worth the time to watch. It is painful at times as the actor and in real life Mr. Robinson, had to listen to the racial slurs thrown at them just because of race. The only question I have would be the underlying reason why the owner of the Dodgers sought to integrate. I perceived he was a visionary and Harrison Ford gives a great performance as the Dodger owner. I suspect that the film downplayed the real harassment and hostility subjected Mr. Robinson. Excellent acting by all and should be a contender for numerous awards.",1375142400,,575,4.592233009708738

I see this as a ""comeback"" performance by Ford, and I hope to see him in many more dramatic roles. Alan Tudyk deserves mention for his portrayal of a viciously racist manager. It's a tough and sickening role, but Tudyk gave a convincing performance, bringing to life the very real, very open, and very painful racism that existed in this country just a few decades ago.",1375142400,,478,4.91358024691358

The acting was very good, for the most part, and it gives you a real visceral sense of what it might have been like to try and break social taboos on race.

The actors were absolutely believable in their roles and the film told a great story without adding gratuitous sex, violence or bad language.  The rougher elements that contributed to the PG-13 rating were so seamlessly appropriate that the story would have been incomplete without them.  This is a wonderful story about the triumph of an individual as well as the power of example in effecting change in society--a movie that families should watch together and then discuss.",1375056000,,628,5.198019801980198

To me it seemed like the director could not decide if it should be a love story, sport story, inspirational story...and the list continues.  While the little details made me go research a little more on my own, I felt the movie had absolutely no chemistry or intensity between the characters or the plot (with one exception with the breaking of a bat - no more details so I do not create a spoiler).  Individually each character was well-acted, they just did not seem liked they were all pulling for the same goal.  I am sorry to say that movies like this make me appreciate the chemistry, effort, script, editing, and directing of other movies and stop taking them for granted.  I will watch an inspirational movie a 1000 times but this will not go in the FAVs bin or the even watch when I am bored bin....more like the ""give to a co-worker bin"" and not care if they return it.  I would not recommend this as a purchase.",1375056000,2,1004,4.347593582887701

5357476,4,B009NNM9OA,"Let me start by saying Chadwick Boseman can't help it if his mother named him after a air freshener, his performance was really spot on. I think what put people off of this movie is the trailer, you see a bunch of TV actors and a aging Harrison Ford and you think your going to get a sub par B movie. Not so, the story of Jackie Robinson stands on it's own. The racism is hard to watch but you have to remember it was a different time and to down play the incidents would have been untrue to the facts.

Kudo's to Mr. Robinson for being one of the best baseball players ever but also for being such a good husband and father. The movie while being about the sport of baseball is also a love story.

I watched it twice so that I would get over the fact ""there is the guy from Friday Night Lights, the dude from Barney Miller.. and so on"" BTW Harrison Fords make up was pitiful... his acting not so bad this time around.",1375056000,,918,4.066298342541437

Jackie Robinson is portrayed as a hero, and I can only agree!  What I also remember as a boy growing up is that he was beloved as much in the end as he was hated in the beginning!  I am glad that men like him had the guts to stand up to the unmerited hate, ridicule, and prejudice that had to be overcome in order that I might have friends of all colors in my community.  Without them, we would continue our father's prejudice, a reflection of our grandfather's prejudice, and the world would be worse off today!  Thank you for reminding us again of the obstacles we often are to those little ones in our lives and our communities!  Thank you Jackie Robinson for being a Methodist, and for Branch Ricky for being a Methodist, and for God being a Methodist!

Branch Rickey character was very predictable. In real life he brought Jackie Robinson mostly to open up a new revenue stream. Obviously any reason was great to get negro league players into the majors. But I doubt he had all the pep talks with him. One minute the fans and teamates hated him. The next they love him.",1374710400,,462,4.32183908045977

5357585,3,B009NNM9OA,"Please excuse my abbreviated review-.
Very slow paced which covered only the first few months of Jackie's career. I did not like the actor that played Jackie, he was not very fast nor did he seem athletic. I thought it was pretty alarming how open people were with all the racial slurs. I knew how it is but to actually see it recreated is quite sad. Jackie did go through alot and I am not taking that away from him. I think he is a model and a hero for not just baseball players but anybody put in a situtation where they are tested.
My favorite baseball movies-

Sandlot
the first Major League
Bull Durham

It brings the late 40's to life as it chronicles the struggle of Jackie Robinson to be accepted into MLB by the fans, other clubs and his own Brooklyn Dodger teammates during the 1947 season.

5357644,5,B009NNM9OA,"This man showed such grace under attack.  Jackie displayed such restraint when walking onto the baseball field to brutal verbal attacks by such ignorant people.  It doesn't matter that the year was 1945.  I've heard people say that that was the time in which he lived (Behavior that is still happening in in 2013.), no one should have to withstand the verbal beating that he took.  The support and love of the African American community was wonderful.  When the other side were yelling their insults, these people also stood their ground with dignity.  Not only did this film focus on his burning desire to play MLB but how he loved his wife...Oh, Rachael was a lucky woman.  He not only respected her, but listened to her as well.  She was as spunky as he was and I believed that's how they survived with grace and dignity.  Although a lot was left out (The film could have been longer.) the performances of the two lead characters were wonderful.  The chemistry between them came across the screen and gave us a glimpse of what their relationship must have been like.  Great movie!",1374537600,,1083,4.647368421052631

Boseman played the part with huge emotion and tick.  It's easily one of the best baseball movies and it adds a rich picture of history for our national past time.

If you need my recommendation, it makes sense to get the UV+Blu Ray version package.  It sets easily to my vudu collection which is accessible anywhere you can stream video.  This is a nice feature when you are at a friends house and want to watch something you own.",1374451200,,566,4.194444444444445

For those of us who did not live during those dark days of racial prejudice it is almost hard to believe that things like separate toilets, bus seats, even eating establishments and churches were so strongly racially segregated.  This movie depicts that excellently.  The character of Jackie Robinson was strong and well done.  I appreciated his self-control in taking abuse and not giving it back.  Quite amazing.  There is a bit of rough language in this movie.  Although I don't condone talking in those terms, I believe it was purposeful for the situations presented.  I recommend this movie whole heartedly.

5357665,5,B009NNM9OA,"But I thought this movie was so well done and chronicled an important movement in sports and national history.  Loved the casting, especially Harrison Ford as Branch Richie.

5357666,4,B009NNM9OA,"""42"" is the story of Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) who, in 1947, became the first African-American baseball player in the major leagues. The movie focuses mostly on Robinson's rookie season with the Brooklyn Dodgers, a year after being signed by team executive Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford).

The partnership between Rickey and Robinson is the most interesting aspect of this otherwise standard sports biopic. Rickey knew that there was a wealth of untapped talent in the Negro Leagues and needed the right man to break the color barrier.  Robinson would be a pioneer, having to endure insults, indignities, and racial slurs without losing his cool -- in other words, a model of calm and reserve whose prowess on the field would eventually earn him the respect of fellow players, fans, and the general public.

Boseman resembles the young Robinson but lacks the fire and resolve that drove Robinson to persevere.  Ford is terrific as Rickey and really sinks his teeth into a meaty role.

It had the perfect blend of life, faith, and preserverence to be inspiring without being cheesy.  The actors were all outstanding. I noticed one review on here that blasted this movie for inaccuracies and being based more on Wikipedia then real life, but I would say that it is a movie based on the life of Jackie Robinson, not a biography. I am not a baseball fan by any means but the story line of this movie is such that being a baseball fan is not required to thoroughly appreciate this movie. I wish there were more films like this.",1374364800,,672,4.25
5357668,4,B009NNM9OA,Definitely gives a realistic picture of what things were like and what Mr. Robinson had to go through. Both the actor who played Jackie and Harrison Ford were excellent.

5357669,5,B009NNM9OA,"Excellent movie. I love the history of baseball and this gives us a really good idea of what Jackie Robinson went through and what an impact that Branch Rickey had our nation thru baseball. This story is great, it shows us true Christian and American values. It makes me proud to be a Christian and an American. If you'd like to learn more about Branch Rickey, Jackie Robinson, and history of segregation in baseball, then a great documentary to watch is Ken Burns: Baseball. Another good film to watch is, The Jackie Robinson Story, where Jackie plays himself. this came out in 1950.",1374364800,,584,4.679611650485437

However, this is not just a film about overcoming racism, it is mainly a story about baseball, when players cared only about playing the game and supporting their fans.  It also holds a message for people not to accept the status quo, or to let self doubts hold you back.  The courage of many of these characters, true people, shine through and motivate all to never let us slide backwards as a society.  Harrison Ford is amazing as a crusty team owner and the film slips into expected sentimentality only briefly, mainly focusing on the strengths and struggles of the characters.  Amazing story!

5357705,5,B009NNM9OA,"The time, 1947, is just beyond the memory of most Americans. But the movie seems to capture Brooklyn & Ebbets Field of that time. Baseball movies are not really about baseball. We know the broad generalities of Jackie Robinson's story & this movie, viewed by many kids across the country in special showings brings his story to a new audience. Racism in baseball was simply a reflection of the larger America. The ignorant players, managers & players were not extremists, many of them not really thinking about racism. They were content to cater to & please white baseball fans.
  It took Branch Rickey, owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers, & well done by Harrison Ford, to bring MLB, kicking & screaming into a new era. Rickey was no civil rights leader. He was a hard headed capitalist with a instinct for profit. His target: millions of black baseball fans convinced that players in the black Negro leagues were as good, or better than white players. He signed Robinson to a major league contract for the start of the 1947 season. It could have easily blown up in his face. He faced overwhelming resistance from fellow owners, managers, & players who threatened boycott. But he had chosen his man well. In a key scene, Jackie asks Rickey, ""You want someone with the courage to fight?"" Rickey counters with: ""I want someone with the courage not to fight."" Jackie Robinson was a World War II vet, a star athlete at UCLA & was once arrested for refusing to move to the back of the bus. The amazing thing is he did not fight back while being provoked in every major league park he played. I'm an old salt & I flinched at the most arresting scene I've seen in a family movie. During an at bat, Robinson was subjected to the most withering string of racial taunts from Phillies manager, Ben Chapman. It was not a short scene, it continued for some time. I imagined the impression it made on the young kids viewing it from the safety of a darkened movie theater.
  Production values were excellent & I can see an AA nomination for Harrison Ford. I am sure profit was uppermost in Rickey's mind. yet I can't help thinking that he knew success would change the face of baseball forever. It did as well as that of America.",1374278400,2,2209,4.5566750629722925

5357721,3,B009NNM9OA,"At what point does a film biography become a hagiography? Yes of course we know that it took tremendous courage to do what Jackie Robinson did. But no matter how hard writer/director Brian Helgeland tries, he ultimately falls into the pit of placing the legendary Mr. Robinson, on a pedestal that he can't get off.

Helgeland does well in introducing us to Jackie the legend but we never get a sense of who Robinson the man, really was. I'm not sure if it could really be done, but perhaps in the hands of a better writer, a lot more interesting facts about Jackie Robinson could have been revealed. I leave the digging up of those facts to those who are privy to the real behind-the-scenes look of Robinson's career and the interactions amongst the players and management of the Brooklyn Dodgers.

Still, Helgeland does touch upon the basic history of what Robinson had to put up with when he entered major league baseball. I found it particularly interesting the whole affair with Ben Chapman, who was perhaps one of the most virulent racists in baseball at that time. It was bad publicity from the press that actually got the front office of the Philadelphia Phillies to force Chapman to publicly act nice toward Robinson. Note that Robinson came up with the idea of taking a picture with Chapman while holding a bat (Robinson justifiably doesn't want to shake his hand because he knows Chapman doesn't really mean what he says--he's just doing it upon orders of his bosses).

Helgeland also has a number of other good scenes, particularly the one in which Robinson must suppress his rage after being taunted by Chapman, and is counseled by Branch Rickey not to let the racist manager, provoke him.

Historically, Robinson's struggle against racism is an epic battle, but dramatically it's difficult to illustrate, since there isn't one antagonist which Robinson must fight until an exciting climax at film's end. Instead, in documentary style, we're treated to a series of end credits, which are designed to explain why we should feel elevated by Robinson's achievement.

Chadwick Boseman does a fine job as Robinson but he's limited by a script that mainly focuses on Robinson's internal struggle to keep a lid on his own justified anger and raw emotions as well as illustrating some of his celebrated moves on the base paths. Robinson's relationship with Branch Rickey is perhaps the most fleshed out of Robinson's relationships with the people who he interacted with, during his life. Helgeland gives Nicole Behaire little to do as Rachel Robinson, Robinson's devoted wife, and one keeps wondering whether Helgeland could have done more with the part.

Bill Madden, the NY Daily News sports columnist, points out that the film is full of factual errors. For example, he argues that Leo Durocher was not suspended for his marital infidelities, but for gambling. He also asks how Robinson could have had a walk-off home run, in the opponent's home park? And the daughter of Pittsburgh Pirate pitcher, Fritz Ostermueller, maintains that her father never hit Robinson in the head with a pitch and that he merely was throwing a 'brush back' pitch. What's more she insisted that, ""My dad, to my knowledge, was not a racist,"" she told TMZ. ""I was not raised in that type of home."" How much research did Helgeland actually do for this film? He has Ralph Branca asking Robinson to join him in the shower and Branca insists that never happened. Sure, a writer can take dramatic license, but at least write something that seems mildly plausible.

If you want a basic history lesson about how Jackie Robinson became major league's baseball's first black ballplayer and if you're also interested in seeing a good performance by Harrison Ford as Branch Rickey, '42' is for you. But 'touching all the bases' does not make a great work of art. This is the film that needed to be a lot more subtle and it's nowhere near that.

Jackie Robinson's early demise must be seen as tragic since he was only 53 when diabetes and heart disease took his life. Maybe that fact also should have been mentioned in the film, a fact equally as important as all of Jackie Robinson's great achievements on and off the baseball",1374192000,6,4198,4.820833333333334

5357728,4,B009NNM9OA,"This was a strange week to watch `42' for the first time - the week of the demonstrations and riots after the Zimmerman/Martin verdict. Just when we think we have a handle on racism, complete with a Black President etc, the ghosts of the past deny being forgotten. This film hopefully, now on television, will put things back into perspective if just enough people watch. Brian Helgeland wrote and directed a solid hit with a fine cast, but this is a painful film to watch on the one hand, and a celebration of one of the first cracks in the racism veneer of this country.

Briefly the story can be summarized as follows: `In 1946, Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) is a Negro League baseball player who never takes racism lying down. Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford) is a Major League team executive with a bold idea. To that end, Rickey recruits Robinson to break the unspoken color line as the first modern African American Major League player. As both anticipate, this proves a major challenge for Robinson and his family as they endure unrelenting racist hostility on and off the field, from player and fan alike. As Jackie struggles against his nature to endure such abuse without complaint, he finds allies and hope where he least expects it.'

The supporting cast is strong: the beautiful Nicole Beharie as Rachel Robinson, Christopher Meloni as Leo Durocher, Andre Holland as Wendall Smith, and Ryan Merriman, Lucas Black , Alan Tudyk, Hamish Linklater, Brad Beyer, James Pickens Jr. and on and on. At times the direction is lax and the story seems to be sidetracked, but it is the powerful performance of Chadwick Boseman that keeps the spirit of the story vital.

5357770,5,B009NNM9OA,"It is always interesting to me when a movie like this gets made, trying to tell a story that is obviously way too big for the scope of a mere two hours on film.  There are always going to be people who think more needed to be added and that certain things that were of vast importance were left out.  With ""42"" I think the right mix was hit upon to convey the basics of the Jackie Robinson story in the time frame that they had.

The movie looked beautiful, portraying the time period in a way that movies of that era might have looked which I think helped capture the moment well.  The ballpark scenes were vivid and alive and looked like something out of a Norman Rockwell painting.  Of course, the illusion of that is shattered when you have the fans in the stands yelling racially charged statements at a player.  Whether intentional or not, it struck a chord with me to have something so ugly going on in such an idyllic setting.

I've read reviews that say the movie is full of inaccuracies, and if you're looking for a hard-core research movie this certainly isn't for you, but it even states at the beginning that the movie is based upon real events, it doesn't pretend that word for word and scene for scene is actually how Jackie Robinson's life actually happened.  I have read other reviews that complain that Robinson is put on too much of a pedestal in this movie.  So what?  This is the story of a very brave man who knowingly walked into a tempest of hate and prejudice because it was the right thing to do.  I'm sure Robisonson wasn't a perfect man, none of us are, but I don't see any problem portraying him as a hero in ""42.""

If you're a baseball fan, this is a must see.  If you're not a baseball fan, I still believe you'll find this to be an interesting story of a man who overcame a lot of obstacles to play in baseball's major leagues.

5357779,4,B009NNM9OA,"I'm not baseball expert. My deepest knowledge of the sport comes from attending a couple of games in-person and watching Ken Burns' awesome documentary. Based on what I learned from that documentary, I wanted to learn more about this chapter of history. And while I don't really have much of an idea about how historically accurate it may be, I do know that it seems to get some of the details and emotion of the story very right indeed.

This film chronicles Jackie Robinson's journey as the first person of his background to play Professional Baseball, and if you know ANYTHING about him, baseball, or the prejudices of the era, you know it's not going to be a pretty picture. That's pretty much the story from the get-go. We KNOW from the start, just as Jackie knows from the start, that he is going to have to take more abuse than any reasonable person should possibly undergo in one lifetime. And the picture is not painted rose-colored, in real life or in this picture. According to the documentary Baseball, Jackie became very bitter late in life from the effects of what he endured. I can believe it. My wife said the movie wasn't too rough to watch, but I personally felt a bit traumatized by the end (maybe I led too much of a sheltered life, or maybe i just take these things too personally).

The film itself isn't a stand-out for direction, cinematography, music, or anything like that. The film is carried by the strength of the acting all-around. But in particular Harrison Ford gives what is in my opinion his finest performance. He will makes you laugh with his comic timing, but on several occasions during the film my mind's eye imagined a scene I was watching playing before his Academy Award Nomination. When he gives Jackie a speech on the field likening him to a Messiah, telling him that he HAS to do what no one else could, you can feel how deeply he wishes he could take his place on the field and spare him the humiliations and fire of people's hatred. Grand stuff. But everyone else is no slouch either. You may find certain characters to be stand-outs, but I in general found everyone else in the film to be SOLID, giving realistic performances.

5357786,4,B009NNM9OA,"""42 deals with the story of Jackie Robinson, the first black baseball player in the major leagues. The story itself follows much in the conventions of a TV drama where moments of surprise, shock, sadness, and enlightenment kick into gear in every one of the five acts with some creative licenses from the truth.

42, however, manages to make you feel that there is something more to talk about than just the basic story and much of the narrative deals with his conflict to the rest of the world and the trust that his wife and Branch Rickey, a fellow financier of the Dodgers themselves, built to him during the course of this tough journey. Not surprisingly, much of the film also examines the struggle he dealt through being a black sportsman and the continual hurls of racial abuse (stronger language than the f-word, to some) and hate will surely disturb and upset more sensitive viewers. Nonetheless, it is contextual to the plotline and the history of the predicament.

Thankfully, 42 doesn't dwell on the negatives but moreover a positive message about resilience and triumphing through adversity in the face of negligence. Christian audiences may also find the film approving with its Methodist characters and discussion about him from above rejecting those who show their hate and ignorance upon others. Its portrayals of famous baseball characters feels genuine and homely and the film does not take too much of a sentimental direction even if it is hinted toward the end and the cinematography is as solid as any film of in the genre should be.

A much better sports film than Moneyball, 42 strikes and scores a homerun for this round. Jackie Robinson would be proud but would know the inner struggle even more than many would now. If more people and sports-players were like Robinson, then there would not be need for fixed scores, violence, and shifty behaviour on the field and during the ballgame.""",1373241600,2,1913,4.861963190184049

5357793,3,B009NNM9OA,"I saw this film last night and it was a good film.  For the reasons written below, I cannot call it a great film.

They have this loser Ben Chapman in the film.  He was one of the worst trash talkers in the game.  Till the day he died, he never thought his actions were wrong.  You can go online and read the interviews.  What's funny is that I have read in reviews around the net that the Chapman trash talking scene was over the top.  It actually is not.  He was that way. Kudos to the film for not watering him down and showing him for the person he was.

What I think the filmmakers should have added is what the stars at the time thought of playing with a black ballplayer.  Ted Williams is portrayed by many in history to support Jackie, however that is not the truth.  In Jackie's book, ""The Way we Were"", he is highly critical of Ted and how he spoke out against him.  To only focus on the Dodgers and his teammates is not enough in my opinion.  It would have been interesting to see what Italian ballplayers thought of him as well as the great Hank Greenberg, who faced antisemitism while he was playing.

The film also leaves out a very important topic.  How did Negro League players feel about Jackie being the first? Josh Gibson, the greatest Negro League player of all time, felt slighted that he was not first along with the great Satchel Paige. They felt they were superior to Robinson and that he did not have a spotless record while he was in the military.  The greatest film I have ever scene on this topic is ""Soul of the Game"".  By the way, that film is superior to this one in almost every way.  I highly urge people to watch that film.  It is one of the greatest baseball films I have ever seen.

There is one other thing that could have been added to this film.  Yes, he was a guy who had to take the racial insults for a while, however that was not for his entire career.  He actually went on to become a very outspoken person.  It just was not in baseball.  He spoke out in many political venues for the Republican party.  To just portray him as a silent guy really does a disservice to Jackie.  He was an extremely well-spoken ballplayer and was very educated unlike most of his white peers who did not have past a high school education.

Overall, I give the film 3 stars.  An average film that could have been better.",1371772800,6,2344,4.230248306997742
5357794,3,B009NNM9OA,"""42"", the story of Jackie Robinson's historic journey to become the first black man to play Major League Baseball in the modern era, is a solid, but strictly by-the-numbers, biopic.  There are definitely some inspired casting choices, such as Harrison Ford as the visionary Brooklyn Dodgers GM, Branch Rickey; Christopher Meloni as the irascible Leo Durocher; and Alan Tudyk has racist Phillies manager, Ben Chapman.  Chadwick Boseman and Nicole Beharie turn in strong performances as Jackie and Rachel Robinson, respectively.

  Unfortunately, the rest of the film plays like a series of anecdotal snapshots from the Jackie Robinson history that we have all learned throughout the years.  We already know about how Rickey tested Robinson's ability to remain calm in face of the abuse he would face by subjecting him to a racial epithet-laced tirade (though it is portrayed much more tamely in the film); we also know about the racial incidents such as Chapman's vicious racial taunts and Dixie Walker's attempt to rebel against integration; we even know about Pee Wee Reese public showing his support (in the midst of backlash from his own southern hometown) by putting his arm around Jackie Robinson while in the infield before a game.

  No new ground is broken in this look at Robinson's life and times.  For those who are not very familiar with the story (and baseball's long, troubled history with race), this is a good place to start.",1371427200,9,1441,5.042194092827004

As Branch Rickey, the man who brought Robinson to the Majors, Harrison Ford hits a home run in his best performance yet. There is no nuance here, as the racist white guys are really bad, and Jackie Robinson and his supporters are really good, but the message of this film doesn't really require any nuance.

5357797,5,B009NNM9OA,"I saw ""42"" last night and walked away informed and inspired.

I think this movie has two significant strengths.  First, it did a good job of depicting the attitudes and opinions of people in and about baseball and segregation in the post WWII-years.  Second, it contains, IOM, the best acting I have ever seen by Harrison Ford.  Again, IMO, it is Oscar-worthy.

Don't get me wrong, Harrison Ford is larger than life as Han Solo and Indiana Jones, but in ""42"" he hit his full stride as an actor, showing that he's much, much more than an action-adventure icon.

This film does a great modeling the battle between civil rights/decency and bigotry/""JIm Crow"" America using Jackie Robinson and MLB.  I was deeply impressed by the treatment of the subject and the quality of people it took to take it on.  They all had their own reasons for doing so, but in the end, they collectively did this country a great service.  Plus, Robinson and others previously banned from MLB due to race, made significant contributions that improved the game and increased its stature in American culture - and I'm not even a baseball fan.

If you thought this was ""just a baseball movie"" you'd be mistaken.  It's a movie about America and Americans.  We don't always do it right, but so far we've eventually gotten it right.

I look forward to adding ""42"" to my personal library.

5 solid stars, and I hope Harrison Ford's name shows up on the 2013 Oscar Ballot because of it.",1370563200,13,1453,4.625

The movie did an excellent job of accurately portraying the prejudices of the time and the pressure that Jackie had to endure to break the color barrier.  It was interesting to see the role of the Brooklyn Dodgers owner and his own reasons for implementing this controversial decision.  It was, at the same time, tortuous to witness the discrimination that defined our country at that time and the personal sacrifices that a few were willing to make to expose the wrongness of that discrimination.

5357799,4,B009NNM9OA,"With a very slow pace, but a build up to a very big heart, director Brian Helgeland (A Knights Tale, The Order) took his own original script and made this nice little biopic film in honor of the legendary baseball player Jackie Robinson.

Jackie is played quite impressively by Chadwick Boseman (Castle, Fringe), does a real honest job of playing a man who has his natural abilities noticed, and because of his color in a time when being of a different race was hurtful and often dangerous, was able to play professional baseball, and be damn good at it for a long time.

His wife, with continued support despite her persecution of being a black woman with a husband joining a professional white baseball team, was amazingly played well by Nicole Beharie (American Violet, The Express). The chemistry of the two of them on screen will tug at your heartstrings if not for their talent, but for the abuse and persecution they received in a very dark era of equality in the United States.

Now the best performance, although, rough, timid and yet extremely quick witted came from baseball team owner, Branch Ricky, incredible personified by the marvelous talents of Harrison Ford (Indiana Jones, Star Wars). Harrison was amazing to watch and full of conviction with his support of standing out above everyone else and being a leader in integrating colored and white players in the professional leagues.  The camera loves Harrison and as usual, he creates a character with layers and compassion.

Many real and memorable performances came from actors like; Christopher Meloni (Oz, Law & Order) as the original coach Leo Durocher. John C. MgcGinley (Scrubs, Platoon) as color radio announcer Red Barber and Alan Tudyk (I, Robot, Firefly) as Ben Chapman and opposing teams manager who nothing but how to slur the colored race in an effort to get under Robinsons skin.

It was a heartwarming and very educational film with an impressive musical score by Mark Isham (Crash, Point Break). I loved the way it ended and stay for the credits where you'll learn what happened to each of the major characters, A small good film, great for the family, if a little bit slow, but still worth the attention!",1369180800,2,2189,4.839572192513369
5357800,5,B009NNM9OA,"What a great movie!! This is one time the movie critics and I actually agree on something. 42 is incredible. Chadwick Boseman proves that any newcomer to acting can bring life and a balanced tone to any character and my friends, he does just that with his portrayal as Jackie Robinson. Harrison Ford is my pick for Best Supporting Actor already; he did a supremely fine job playing Branch Rickey. His character wanted things to change for the better, and i admired and appreciated that aspect in the movie. It has been a long time since I last saw Lucas Black in a movie, but he did a great job as Pee Wee Reese. Christopher Meloni(the guy from Law and Order Svu) has a supporting role. The other remaining cast all gave terrific performances. After watching 42, I can say that: Jackie Robinson is one of my heroes. Not just because he was the first African American to play Major League Baseball, but because through all the adversity, name calling, etc. he never gave up. He WAS destined for greatness. Thank god that this movie was made.
To close out my review, 42 is the much-needed uplifting, inspiring film that I absolutely can not wait to buy on dvd. I would give this movie 100 stars (if that were possible) so 42 gets:

5357801,4,B009NNM9OA,"""42"" about Jackie Robinson, the first African American major league baseball player, is a beautiful, inspirational, must-see movie. ""42"" has been accused of being corny. For heaven's sake, it IS corny. Jackie Robinson was a true hero, as was Branch Rickey, the white man who decided to break the color line in baseball. This is an old-fashioned, all-American, even Christian story that makes you tear up and get goosebumps. ""42"" is about good v evil. The bad guys in this movie are repellant scum. The good guys are true heroes of historic proportions. I wish more people would see this film.

It's the late 1940s. America has defeated Nazism. It's time for the Civil Rights movement to defeat white supremacy in the US. Baseball executive Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford) selects Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) to be the first African American player on a major league team. This choice puts Robinson's life at risk.

Pitchers attempt to hit Robinson in the head with their balls. Base-runners drive their spiked heels into his legs. Philadelphia Phillies' Ben Chapman hectors Robinson when he is at bat. Chapman repeats ugly, disgusting insults. Robinson is powerless to silence Chapman. Hotel owners won't allow any members of the same team as Robinson to rent rooms. Robinson's own teammates shun him and sign a petition protesting his inclusion. Robinson must wait until his teammates are done in the shower room before he can shower. While his teammates are given lockers, he is given only a peg with a hanger. Toughs arrive at his house and threaten him so badly he must be driven out of town. Letter writers threaten to harm his wife and child.

Robinson's heroism in facing all this is the inspiration. Branch Rickey is also a hero. He was a devout Christian. He chides an interlocutor, ""Love they neighbor as thyself. That is repeated eight times in the Bible, more than any other commandment.""

""42"" isn't an especially deep film. It does not probe deeply into any of its characters. It presents the history of baseball's integration in a fairly straightforward, easy to follow way. Production values are high. The 1940s era is captured in vintage clothes, cars, ballpark ads and architecture.

Chadwick Boseman is handsome, heroic, and stoic as Jackie Robinson. Nicole Beharie is incredibly beautiful as his wife Rachel. Harrison Ford is a bit hammy as Branch Rickey, but he's Harrison Ford, so he can get away with it.

I loved this movie and I wish everyone would see it. We need more such ""corny"" films.",1368230400,2,2519,4.929245283018868
5357802,5,B009NNM9OA,"""Break an unwritten law and you will be an out cast.""

Facing an uphill battle Branch Ricky (Harrison Ford) finds the right African-American ballplayer to break the color barrier in baseball. Rickey's reasons are diverse being both altruistic, having a sense of justice, old guilty feelings, and the desire to win and make money. Chadwick Boseman portrays the Jackie Robinson of legend, an overly talented, silent, and classy individual. While the film is about him, it shows things that go on behind the scenes.

The film starts with a quick background and goes into Jackie's minor league trials and tribulations on and off the field. Ricky supported Robinson off the field anyway he could, but on the field Jackie was alone. It shows the break through of his teammates to overcome the prejudicial urges they grew up with. Minds winning over emotions to do what was right.

Don't get me wrong, it shows whites behaving badly and makes Philadelphia look bad. It gives us a glimpse of the ugly side of baseball, one we really don't want to see. In spite of the heavy and historical use of the N-word, it is a film that makes audiences stand up and applaud.

What the film doesn't tell you about is all the children that were named Jack or Jackie because of this man.

Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0

 At what point does a film biography become a hagiography? Yes of course we know that it took tremendous courage to do what Jackie Robinson did. But no matter how hard writer/director Brian Helgeland tries, he ultimately falls into the pit of placing the legendary Mr. Robinson, on a pedestal, that he can't get off.

Helgeland does well in introducing us to Jackie the legend but we never get a sense of who Robinson the man, really was. I'm not sure if it could really be done, but perhaps in the hands of a better writer, a lot more interesting facts about Jackie Robinson could have been revealed. I leave the digging up of those facts to those who are privy to the real behind-the-scenes look of Robinson's career and the interactions amongst the players and management of the Brooklyn Dodgers.

Still, Helgeland does touch upon the basic history of what Robinson had to put up with when he entered major league baseball. I found it particularly interesting the whole affair with Ben Chapman, who was perhaps one of the most virulent racists in baseball at that time. It was bad publicity from the press that actually got the front office of the Philadelphia Phillies to force Chapman to publicly act nice toward Robinson. Note that Robinson came up with the idea of taking a picture with Chapman while holding a bat (Robinson justifiably doesn't want to shake his hand because he knows Chapman doesn't really mean what he says--he's just doing it upon orders of his bosses).

Helgeland also has a number of other good scenes, particularly the one in which Robinson must suppress his rage after being taunted by Chapman, and is counseled by Branch Rickey not to let the racist manager, provoke him.

Historically, Robinson's struggle against racism is an epic battle, but dramatically it's difficult to illustrate, since there isn't one antagonist which Robinson must fight until an exciting climax at film's end. Instead, in documentary style, we're treated to a series of end credits, which are designed to explain why we should feel elevated by Robinson's achievement.

Chadwick Boseman does a fine job as Robinson but he's limited by a script that mainly focuses on Robinson's internal struggle to keep a lid on his own justified anger and raw emotions as well as illustrating some of his celebrated moves on the base paths. Robinson's relationship with Branch Rickey is perhaps the most fleshed out of Robinson's relationships with the people who he interacted with, during his life. Helgeland gives Nicole Behaire little to do as Rachel Robinson, Robinson's devoted wife, and one keeps wondering whether Helgeland could have done more with the part.

Bill Madden, the NY Daily News sports columnist, points out that the film is full of factual errors. For example, he argues that Leo Durocher was not suspended for his marital infidelities, but for gambling. He also asks how Robinson could have had a walk-off home run, in the opponent's home park? And the daughter of Pittsburgh Pirate pitcher, Fritz Ostermueller, maintains that her father never hit Robinson in the head with a pitch and that he merely was throwing a 'brush back' pitch. What's more she insisted that, ""My dad, to my knowledge, was not a racist,"" she told TMZ. ""I was not raised in that type of home."" How much research did Helgeland actually do for this film? He has Ralph Branca asking Robinson to join him in the shower and Branca insists that never happened. Sure, a writer can take dramatic license, but at least write something that seems mildly plausible.

If you want a basic history lesson about how Jackie Robinson became major league's baseball's first black ballplayer in the modern baseball era, and if you're also interested in seeing a good performance by Harrison Ford as Branch Rickey, '42' is for you. But 'touching all the bases' does not make a great work of art. This is the film that needed to be a lot more subtle and it's nowhere near that.

Jackie Robinson's early demise must be seen as tragic since he was only 53 when diabetes and heart disease took his life. Maybe that fact also should have been mentioned in the film, a fact equally as important as all of Jackie Robinson's great achievements on and off the baseball field.",1367625600,13,4301,4.814363143631437
5357804,5,B009NNM9OA,"""You give me a uniform, you give me a number on my back, I'll give you the guts."" For over 50 years baseball (like the rest of the country) was a white man's game.

For Jackie Robinson (Boseman) it just wasn't as easy as putting on a uniform and playing. As many of you know I am a huge baseball fan and I love true stories so I was very much looking forward to seeing this. Even with my high expectations the movie was still better then I was hoping. Besides the movie being one of the best I have seen in a long time Harrison Ford turns in what I think is the best performance of his career and I don't think an Oscar win for him finally is a stretch. The racism shown in this movie is bad but I'm sure it's not even a quarter of what it actually was. That fact alone makes your respect for Robinson leap up from its already high mark. Even if you aren't a huge baseball fan this is a movie you should see. It's more a movie about the human condition and the limits you can reach if you believe in something. Overall, best movie of 2013 so far and best movie I have seen in awhile. I easily give it an A+.",1366934400,9,1322,4.068965517241379
5357805,5,B009NNM9OA,"""42"" won't garner any buzz for innovative filmmaking technique, but it shows, in dramatic and entertaining fashion, how Jackie Robinson and Brooklyn Dodgers General Manager Branch Rickey broke the color line in major league baseball. Pretty much any baseball fan knows that Robinson was the first African-American major league player and sees 42, the jersey number Robinson wore with the Brooklyn Dodgers, hanging among the retired numbers at the baseball stadium. Far too few know the details of how this came about or how much fortitude and forbearance both Robinson and Rickey needed to break something far stronger than a written law--an unwritten social code--and survive 1947.

Christian idealism (Rickey opposed racism on religious and moral grounds, even more so after blacks had fought side by side with whites in World War II), good business sense (there were African-American baseball fans to whom the Dodgers could sell tickets, and opportunities to recruit top talent at affordable salaries from Negro League teams) and the desire to make the Dodgers champions motivated Rickey. He selected Robinson from among a number of possible Negro League players based on his combination of baseball talent, relative youth and character. Robinson, a solid family man not prone to vices of drink, gambling or womanizing, had the guts, as Rickey put it, to stand up and stay focused on the game rather than fighting back in the face of the taunting and abuse he would have to endure, not only on the field but in the media and the communities where the Dodgers traveled. ""42"" provides important insight into the tremendous courage it takes to change a culture, especially for today's children who have grown up taking for granted that an African-American can be president.

Write-director Brian Helgeland serves up a fast-paced, intense tale of heroism, with many vivid depictions of the virulent prejudice Robinson and his wife Rachel endured, both in the deep south during spring training and in still-tribal cities north of the Mason-Dixon line like Philadelphia. It's not easy to play a saint, but Chadwick Boseman manages to bring warmth, humor, charm, and human vulnerability to his portrayal of the stoic Robinson. Harrison Ford offers a DeNiro-esque immersion performance as Branch Rickey and may net himself his first Academy Award nomination since ""Witness."" Nicole Beharie manages to sparkle in the relatively thankless role of Robinson's supportive wife. Add an enjoyable soundtrack of pop hits from the 40s and 50s and beautiful photography, and ""42"" offers an inspiring, educational, wholly enjoyable night at the movies for the entire family.",1366588800,,2658,5.2665094339622645
5357806,5,B009NNM9OA,"There's been no shortage of sports dramas in Hollywood, which typically releases a feel-good sports flick every year or so, and we as movie-goers love to see an uplifting and inspirational story that pertains to the world of sports. However, over the course of history, there may be no story of greater importance than that of Jackie Robinson, the lone man who broke through Major League Baseball's color barrier and changed the sport, as well as our nation, forever.

42 tells the story of these amazing figures and the trials they endured to make Jackie Robinson the first African-American player in the game. In the film, the legendary athlete is played by newcomer Chadwick Boseman who does a terrific job given the weight and importance of the man he's portraying, and whose performance is earnest and inspirational. Of course, Robinson's journey couldn't have happened without Branch Rickey, the GM of the Brooklyn Dodgers who risked everything to take a stand against prejudice. That man is played by Harrison Ford, who plays the part fantastically. The pair have some great on-screen moments and really add to the film's authenticity. All-in-all it's a very well-rounded cast with some strong supporting roles, including John C. McGinley as Red Barber and Lucas Black as Pee Wee Reese.

This film is a fantastic biopic of one of sports's most important figures. The performances are great and there's some really good baseball action as well. The film also contains more humor than I would have expected, most of which comes from Robinson's Dodger teammates. Do yourself a favor and see 42.

5357807,5,B009NNM9OA,"ilms about sports are as old as the modern screen narrative gets.  It seems most movie fans have a favorite sports movie, even people who hate sports.  The reason for this is that a great sports movie is often not really about the game.  A great sports movie is about life, passion, talent, and determination.  These films strive to inspire, and the great ones usually do.  42 brings the epic story of Jackie Robinson to the big screen, and if you don't tear up at this one, there's something wrong with you.

Robinson's story is fairly well-known, especially to baseball fans.  What may be a slightly lesser-known facet of Robinson's story is the role Brooklyn Dodgers GM Branch Rickey plays in it.  Together Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) and Rickey (Harrison Ford) attack the prejudice inherent in post-WW II America by using America's pastime as a weapon for unity.  This is not unlike the strategic move Nelson Mandela took in terms of using a nation's love for Rugby as an equalizer in post-apartheid South Africa.  The film opens with Robinson already a star of the Negro League.  He is summoned by Rickey to join the Brooklyn Dodgers' farm organization with the expectation that he would be brought up to the majors, breaking the color barrier and becoming the first African-American ever to play major league baseball.  Rickey senses that Robinson is the potential game-changer that he needs because he has both the talent for the game as well as the personal strength to withstand the firestorm that his presence in the majors will inevitably cause.  Rickey represents a dogmatic, purist love for something that has seemingly been soiled.  His motivation is fueled by love and respect  in a time when both of these qualities are in short supply (in terms of race relations).

Robinson's story is treated with great respect in 42.  Director Brian Helgeland does not sugar-coat America's racist past, but it could be said that he stereotypes it a bit.  Nonetheless, he uses the game of baseball as a way to survey the various racial perspectives shared throughout different regions and classes in mid-20th century America.  This helps 42 rise slightly above a standard bio-pic into something of an American culture expose.  Robinson is not simply pitted against ""racism.""  He is doubted by timid hypocrites like Rickey's associate Harold Parrott (T.R. Knight).  He is hated by southern simple-folk who are frightened by change like Phillie's manager Ben Chapman (Alan Tudyk).  He is isolated by skeptical teammates who feel under-valued like Dixie Walker (Ryan Merriman).  He is also anxious about what his presence means to other struggling African-Americans like journalist, Wendell Smith (Andre Holland) and idolizing child-fan Ed Charles (Dusan Brown).  Robinson's wife Rachel (Nicole Beharie) effectively reveals the source of much of Robinson's strength against many of these different and difficult stresses.

Consequently,42 is one of the best films of a young 2013, and it is certainly an excellent addition to a long line of great sports movies.  It does rely on stereotype and simplification from time to time, and Robinson is also depicted as a virtually flawless individual.  However, these choices are clearly deliberate, and when an audience analyzes the intentions of the film, these choices make sense.  At the end of 42, we are left feeling a strong sense of history as well as the emotional dynamic between the strength of a team and the even greater power of an individual.

5357809,4,B009NNM9OA,"42, written and directed by Brian Helgeland, is based on the real-life story of Jack Roosevelt ""Jackie"" Robinson, the first African-American baseball player to play in the major leagues.  Robinson's story is well known to many, but to anyone who isn't, 42 (Robinson's number when he played for the Brooklyn Dodgers) will serve to acquaint them with the man and his achievements against the backdrop of the times he lived through.  The cast is excellent and give outstanding performances, particularly when recreating the feel of the times and the way it felt to watch Robinson play.

The story begins in 1945, when Brooklyn Dodgers owner Branch Rickey (a deftly turned performance by Harrison Ford) makes the decision that his team is going to be the first major league baseball team to recruit and field a black player. He takes his time, going over the various prospects with his staff, and finally settles on a short-stop currently playing for a black league team, the Kansas City Monarchs, Jackie Robinson (terrifically played by Chadwick Boseman). The film then follows Robinson's career, starting with his being signed to Rickey's minor-league Montreal Royals for the 1946 season, and then his move up to the big league Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947.

One of the best things about 42 is that it does show just how racially divided American was in the years following WWII and how openly hostile - and acted upon - the racism was in those days. This is absolutely vital to the film in order to show just how daring - and risky - Rickey's decision was, and how daunting the challenge was for Robinson to was to step up to the plate and face the hostility of not only the crowds but also that of his own teammates as well.

As I said, the cast is excellent and there are too many fine performances to list them all. Harrison Ford is visibly having a ball in his best role in years as the garrulous, cigar-chomping but never wavering in determination Branch Rickey. Christopher Meloni (best known from TV's Law & Order: Special Victims Unit) delivers in spades as the larger-than-life Dodgers manager, Leo Durocher. And Lucas Black turns in a deft performance as Robinson's Dodgers teammate, baseball legend Pee Wee Reese. Alan Tudyk gets the thankless - but important - job of playing Ben Chapman, the Philadelphia Phillies' manager who openly race-baits Robinson during a game. And to his credit, Tudyk carries it off brilliantly, filling the screen with everything that so desperately needing changing in America at that time. On the other side, Andre Holland's African-American sportswriter Wendell Smith, who has to sit with his typewriter balanced on his knees in the bleachers because they don't allow blacks in the news booth, is there to remind Robinson in his soft-spoken but clear-eyed way that ""This isn't just about you."" And Nicole Beharie as Rachel Robinson is supportive grace personified as she gives Jackie a calm center to turn to amid the storm swirling all about him.

But it is above all Chadwick Boseman's masterful portrayal of Robinson himself that carries the film, from the way in which he brings out the man behind the legend to the way in which he vividly recreates the way Robinson played the game. The scenes where Robinson repeatedly gets the best of one pitcher after another with his visually taunting, hands-twitching stealing of bases are almost worth the price of admission just by themselves.

My only complaint is in regard to Helgeland's direction and script.  While there are many scenes and moments in 42 that are beautifully rendered, as a film it feels somewhat choppy, moving in a paint-by-numbers fashion to fill in one episode after the other but with no real smoothness or flow to it.  And too often Helgeland seems to lack confidence in the story, choosing to gild the lily with scenes that are decidedly ham-handed in contrast to the moments of sheer grace that Robinson's story has in abundance. (I swear, some scenes are so heavy-handed one almost expects Keenan Ivory Wayans to suddenly appear on-screen shouting ""Message!"" the way he did in the over-the-top spoof Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood). That said however, please take all this with a grain of salt.  42 _is_ a good film.  It might even be a very good film.  But given the truly history-making nature of the story, and the remarkable performances by the highly talented cast, it could have been a _great_ film. I know that Helgeland has done excellent work as a screenwriter in the past, from 1998's L.A. Confidential for which he won an Academy Award to 2003's Mystic River for which he was nominated, with A Knight's Tale and Payback, which he also directed, in between.  But his record since then has been decidedly spotty, with his only directing credit being the 2003 box-office bomb The Order and writing credits for less than stellar films like Man On Fire, the 2009 remake of The Taking of Pelham One-Two-Three, Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant, 2010's Robin Hood and Green Zone.  While 42 will hopefully do better than any of those, it unfortunately only seems to continue Helgeland's slump as a writer and/or director.
