Needless to say the surfing action was thrilling to say the least. This is a must have for any person passionate about the water, the ocean, surfing and life. Music used is also great.",1300665600,,345,4.242424242424242

8303234,5,B001G0DW3A,"I think because I nearly drowned as a child and because my Dad who pulled me out of the churning surf reminds me of Laird. I love this man. Waterman, Hellman, Big Wave Surfer, God. He is all that and more to me. Growing up in Boston, I didn't know a lot about surfers, although I did skip school in 11th grade to go 'surfing' with a couple of guys near Hampton Beach, New Hampshire. The water was SOOO cold but it was worth every minute of that thrill of being on a board, even if only for a few minutes. I've always loved passion and Laird exudes it. I think I remember reading somewhere that his mother gave birth to him in some sort of New Age water chamber, so I can see why he is so drawn to the water. If like me, you are drawn toward passion, the surf, the energy of a man who continues to challenge himself, you will love Water Man...Mary Kennedy Eastham, Author, 'The Shadow of a Dog I Can't Forget' and the upcoming novel, 'Night Surfing - A Story of Love & Wonder in the Waves of Malibu'",1243209600,5,998,4.096938775510204
