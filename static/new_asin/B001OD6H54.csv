3729908,3,B001OD6H54,"I really love sebastian maniscalco, his comedy has even brought me to tears I laughed so hard!  But pains me to say that I was dissapointed in this DVD.  It doesn't feature his best work, I'm not sure how this specific venue and the material used was selected to be his debut DVD- but it did not showcase his best work by any means.  I'm dissapointed to give this a 3-star rating, but I'm crossing my fingers he'll push out another DVD sometime in the future.",1288656000,,459,4.313953488372093

3729912,5,B001OD6H54,"Sebastian is an extremely funny guy.  His humor is a different slant and very funny.  Included are a cartoon of one of his bits and his very 1st show, which includes a member of the audience when his phone rings.  Sebastian handles it very masterfully.  His trip to the water slide park is keenly described with such hilarity you'll have to rewind to catch what you missed when laughing.  Get this DVD it's way underpriced.",1255737600,6,423,4.586666666666667

3729914,5,B001OD6H54,"Sebastian Maniscalca is completely hysterical! I first came across his comedy act while flipping through the Comedy Channel, and was completely mesmerized by not only his incredible humor, but also his facial expression and presentation. He is one of the funniest guys I've seen in a long time, and is right up there with the best of comedians. I definitely look forward to more of his comedy.

3729917,5,B001OD6H54,"I saw this guy last Saturday night 05/23/09 in San Jose and I can't begin to say how funny Sebastian was. I went to the show to see a friend perform and I nearly pissed myself hearing his stand-up act. Absolutely hilarious, there may be a few ""F-bombs"" but it's not as crude as most comedians I've heard (Ron White, Dave Chappelle, etc.) Must buy, great deal...you won't regret it.",1243296000,,381,4.457142857142857

3729919,5,B001OD6H54,"Sebastian's humor has a Don Rickles-like edge without the personal attacks. In fact his favorite target of humor is himself. He does observational humor, and my only complaint is that I wish there were more of his videos available. I'm a big fan, and a long-time admirer.  , I think he's hilarious and I can watch his videos over and over and they still make me laugh, hard.",1486080000,,374,4.5

I love Sebastian and until now I haven't had a problem with a digital order.  How do I get my money back for this.  Its not Sebastian's fault so I didn't wait to give it 1 star.

3729943,5,B001OD6H54,"Sebastian Maniscalco - A Genius Conductor of orchestrating LOL!

In 2016, the World of Comedy is filled with Ethnic humor, Improv, Open mike, Lewd, Roasts, Stand-up, LGBT, Urban, Racial Insult, and other genres.

Whereas, Sebastian has created his own genre with a perfect G-Rated formula that Stands Up on its own and does not rely on artificial sweeteners.

A huge fan of Sebastian since 2009, it became obvious that this is a well-orchestrated comedy event from someone who is a master and surgical observer of the Human Condition, as it relates to our interesting home and public behavior patterns.
While at the same time reminding us of his immigrant family, which most Americans hail from but have lost sight of their own immigrant family at the entry port of call NYC location, named Ellis island.

Maniscalco is a master Story Teller, who has a brilliant ability to turn on and off his facial, eye animations and body movements in a subtle manner that not only amplifies his character, but, elevates his comedy to a Shakespearean level.

Yes, he is a pure Genius, because this ACT demands real Brain Power!
Sebastian creates, writes and produces his own comedy material.
His keen observations of every-day typical human behavior and interactions, are so superbly-crafted that it leaves you hungry for more.
His Real Comedy material is so profound that you find yourself identifying and drawn into his genius Story lines, and watching it again.
Ive watched all three videos over and over again ... Yes they are all that 5-Star good, and cant wait for the next one.

In one of my favorite movies, Gladiator, played by Spaniard (Russell Crowe), would stand in the center of the Colosseum, before the cheers and accolades from the Public and shout back ... Am I Not Entertaining? ... it is what Sebastian does but within a more refined, subtle delivery of impeccable note. Ciao!

He is smart and uses wit plus a lot of body language to get his point across and deliver his bits. He is so much better then MOST so called comedians today who just stand still on stage and hurl a ton of profanity at the crowd. Sebastian is very tasteful and pretty much never curses. Which could be a turn off to some but i think comedians who feel they need to curse all the time really just end up using it as a crutch and for a lack of good material.

He seems like (at least in his act) that is a decent guy with a good upbringing and that comes out in how he looks at the world around him.  Just a normal guy, not shocking, not rude.

3730016,4,B001OD6H54,"I first saw Sebastian on""Comics without Borders"" and then on a few of the late night talk shows, which all had me in stitches.

3730019,5,B001OD6H54,"Sebastian Maniscalco is a clean comic with legitimate gripes, hilarious facial expressions, and impeccable timing.  After catching Sebastian's Showtime special of ""What's Wrong with People"" I bought this DVD and enjoyed it immensely.  I've seen Sebastian do his bit live in San Diego from the front row at the Mad House Comedy Club - and now I am an even bigger fan.  Can't wait to see him in Las Vegas at the end of May 2012!  It's been a long time since we had someone this funny!  Thank you Sebastian!",1332374400,,504,4.555555555555555
3730020,5,B001OD6H54,Once again this DVD came in quick and hassle free in mint shape.  He is not a well known comedian but I'm telling you it is worth getting.  He has a new one (his second) coming out in March that I sure will be just as funny.  Thanks.,1330560000,,233,3.8125
3730021,4,B001OD6H54,"Sebastian Maniscalco may state 'I just don't understand people' throughout this live comedy routine, but stay with this very funny man and you'll discover that he knows through observation more than most people can claim.  His observations of human behavior at the present time (as opposed to when he was a young fellow growing up in what he terms a typical Italian household) are right on target and so funny that it is hard to catch a breath during his very active onstage delivery.  He manages to snare male/female interaction s in clubs ('Is it noisy in here?'), sex addiction clinics ('no single man would ever be in their meetings'), tattoos, the history of mall changes, shopping in grocery stores, discount stores, current dress, marriage, long term engagements - the list of items he 'doesn't understand in people' is long and takes over an hour of time.

Maniscalco is a very funny comedian who does not find it necessary to make every running joke line off color or to sprinkle his dialog with overused expletives: his humor is grounded in those things that make us all laugh - ourselves and our behavior and reactions.  He has a strong future.  Grady Harp, January 12",1326153600,2,1179,4.788177339901478
3730022,5,B001OD6H54,Bought this DVD to entertain guests at Thanksgiving - everyone enjoyed it and laughed alot!  We saw Sebastion in person and thought his standup comedy show a little better than the DVD but the DVD is rather old and the in person show was many years later so I think he has perfected his routine a little bit.  Would recommend this to anyone who likes standup comedy.,1323129600,,366,4.447761194029851
3730023,4,B001OD6H54,I would definitely recommend this! My husband and myself laughed out loud at this real life scenario type comedy. This is a talented comedian and is even better in his live act. This is a must have for all comedy fans!,1320710400,,218,4.341463414634147
