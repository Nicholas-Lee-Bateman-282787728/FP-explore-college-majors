5840138,1,B00DP6OTEE,"Guys, I viewed this on Youtube.  One very observant viewer left the comment that the new owner had the exact same things in the pantry as the old owner who supposedly moved out because of the haunting.  They didn't even have the foresight to change the things in the pantry.  So fake.",1390176000,7,284,4.423076923076923

5840141,2,B00DP6OTEE,Was not impressed with this movie. I love movies about the supernatural but this is at the bottom of my list.,1387670400,,109,4.238095238095238
5840142,4,B00DP6OTEE,"I don't  know if it's true or not, it's presented as a documentary. It was so creepy and scary that in the end it didn't matter to me if it wasn't. There are endless minutiae in the filming and story that are highly questionable all over the place.
  I watched this alone in total darkness at 11:50 pm never knowing, or having heard anything of the YouTube videos. It scared me silly. I absolutely believed it. Then I showed it to my husband the next day in the harsh light of day and felt like a total gullable idiot. That's when I saw all of the flaws.
  If you're going to watch it, the price is worth it if you watch it in the dark. I think you'll feel you wasted your money if you watch it in daytime. All horror films are like that though. I give it 4 stars because it scared the bejesus out of me like I wanted it to, and  took off one star because I say shame on them if they're billing it as a documentary and it's not.",1387065600,15,928,3.9891891891891893

5840144,4,B00DP6OTEE,"I watched this without taking it too seriously. I enjoy these kinds of stories. This is told from a documentary standpoint, with various video clips presenting the arch of a haunting from beginning to end. It is supposedly true and it may well be. I went into it looking for 40 minutes of lounge time. If you like reading ""true"" ghost stories on the internet, you will probably enjoy this.",1386028800,15,389,4.571428571428571

this is 40 minutes of the camera man talking and the echo of his ex-wife simply repeating almost word for word the same exact thing.  I now feel as if this is not a real paranormal event- but simply a hoax.

5840147,3,B00DP6OTEE,"I'm just glad this documentary didn't turn out like many low-budget films that I've seen on Prime. Seems like they actually tried, which I'm going to give them the credit for. It's always a bit satisfying to see a story put to the Pantry Ghost video which I watched way back when it was fire. Definitely, if you haven't seen the original video and didn't have prior knowledge it'll be boring and a waste of time, but I watched the Pantry Ghost video countless times before this so it was nice to watch this documentary. Now whether I believe if it's real or fake? that's a subject of debate. If it's a hoax, man Hollywood needs to hire the man behind the camera and effects. They were better than some Hollywood movies that ""claimed"" to be scary...",1437868800,,748,4.467153284671533
5840148,1,B00DP6OTEE,Not something that you should have to pay for.,1437091200,,46,4.222222222222222
5840149,2,B00DP6OTEE,"I debated between 2 or 3 stars. While this story is clearly BS, they did a good job of creating a very spooky BS story. For the creep factor, I almost gave it 3 stars. BUT there were just one too many issues that annoyed me, so I settled on 2 stars.

My issues with this ""documentary""
*The lame backstory. They set up this lame backstory, I suppose to give credibility to guy who this all happened to. But come on! They couldn't do better than ""I wanted to see hummingbirds and this led to me meditating which led to me noticing small stuff."" ?? First of all he says he would fill a hummingbird feeder in the morning and it would be empty when he got home from school and he'd never get to see hummingbirds. Uh...it doesn't empty that quickly and even if it did, why wouldn't you just refill in the afternoon after school and see if hummingbirds came around. No, he had to skip school to witness a hummingbird and this led to some spiritual experience that led him to seeking out meditation. All of this was set up to explain why he noticed that every morning the pantry door was open. As if it takes meditation and a mind trained to noticed small stuff to realize the pantry had been closed the night before but now it is open in the morning. Lame.

*Then the narrator explains that they have to hide the dude's identity and disguise his voice. He doesn't want to be recognized. There are shots of London flashing on the screen as this is being explained. I suppose we are to assume he now lives in London?? They never explain this. But if he is all about being incognito why give hints as to where he might be living now? Also, they disguise his voice as he is telling his story but then they flashback to home video footage he shot and you can clearly hear his actual voice in these videos. AND it seems odd to me that a man would go so far to hide who he is but then let his daughter appear in the documentary without trying to hide who she is.

*Having picked all that apart, I was still willing to suspend disbelief. I was still willing to go along with this BS story because it was totally creepy. While the set up totally made me think this was completely fake, the guy telling the story and his ex-wife seemed convincing. They didn't sound like they were reading from a script. Their storytelling came across as natural. So, I was happily going along with the story until they introduced the daughter. Bad move because she completely ruined any chance they had of selling this as real. TERRIBLE acting.  In the video footage, the little girl he is talking to is so unnatural. Her dialogue is so forced. Then the interview with daughter as a teen....wow...just wow. I'm trying to remember if/when I've seen worse acting. But she totally killed the entire thing.

*Also, the whole gimmick of starting it as 11:55 so it will end at 12:34 is stupid. If you decide to watch this, do not feel like you have to watch it at 11:55.",1435449600,,2931,4.331511839708561

5840158,2,B00DP6OTEE,"I give it 5 stars for entertainment, but deduct 3 of those because it's purposely misleading. It's been outted as a fake long ago, thus is not a true ""documentary"", but a ""mockumentary"". Even worse than the title is the description ""real life ghost"". Blatant deception. If you want quick & cheap scares, it will do that for you. That's exactly the reason I rented it, already knowing the story. But I'm sure that some, probably many, have rented and/or bought this ""production"" with the idea that it contained actual evidence .... it does, of decent trickery on camera.

If not for the purposeful misleading in an attempt to gain more buyers (which unfortunately works), then it would have gotten at least 4, perhaps 5 stars because it's decent entertainment for a half-hour or so. But I can't condone advertising it as something it is not, solely to sell more copies. If that weren't the case, then it would specify BEFORE purchase that this was produced for entertainment purposes only, not as portraying reality.",1422835200,8,1015,4.833333333333333

5840192,5,B00DP6OTEE,"I found this film doc very enlightening.  I've seen in other doc's proving with evidence that ghosts/spirits/demons are real and do live on this earth.  Its the seeing with one's own eyes that makes it hard to disbelieve in their manifestation and presence here on earth.  Make no mistake, they, like GOD, is real.  I say this because there is balance in nature.  If there is evil then there must be good to balance it.  This is not to say that all ghosts/spirits are evil but again, make no mistake, demons especially, are real and we should be aware of this fact so as not to be influenced by their presence in our lives.  They do endeavor to influence our behavior and lives.  I only bring this up to show that films like this one, brings their existence to light and thus making us aware that they are indeed real and have an agenda that is not of benefit to our souls and being.
Just my thoughts on this film and its subject matter.
GOD bless.

5840193,4,B00DP6OTEE,"Not sure if this is a drama or docudrama or what, but it was entertaining and not long so it was worth watching",1398124800,,111,3.869565217391304
5840194,2,B00DP6OTEE,"Horror movies almost always disappoint me, but a few years ago I discovered some genuinely creepy shorts on YouTube that briefly satisfied my supernatural horror cravings.  The pantry ghost films were my favorites, hands down, so this mockumentary piqued my interest, but it was ultimately disappointing and, frankly, a waste of money.

The concept is interesting.  In a documentary style, the videos are contextualized by a story arc that runs from the ghost's serendipitous discovery to a lackluster conclusion.  What I had hoped for was some unseen footage of the ghost, or at least some higher quality video, but neither is included.  Instead, we get repetitive, boring and poorly acted documentary scenes that fill the space between each video, but do little  else.  Even at a very short 40 minutes, the movie lagged.

There are two major annoyances.  First, the video's creator has his identity concealed by blurring his image and modulating his voice - this, despite the fact that you can hear his voice in the YouTube videos!  Second, there's a message at the beginning of the movie recommending that you start the film at 11:55.  I suppose the reason for it is so the movie ends at about the same time the pantry ghost would open her door, but this assumes you don't pause the film and that you pay attention to the time.

The movie's only real strengths are the original YouTube videos, but you can already watch all of those for free online.  I hope the videos' creator comes out with an original movie, because he seems to have a good sense of atmosphere and creep.  As far as this movie goes, you can skip it.",1397865600,,1622,4.746428571428571
5840195,5,B00DP6OTEE,"One thing my Nephew and I enjoy doing together is watching paranormal programs and old fashioned ghost stories.  Every time he comes to stay with us we enjoy watching something scary and have fun scaring each other. I was looking for something good and different for my Nephew's holiday visit.  He's a big fan of the paranormal reality shows that are so popular right now.  I hadn't heard of this film but it sounded interesting and it wasn't expensive so that I could afford to buy more than one item for his entertainment, and mine.  I decided to preview the film and was only planning to watch a couple of minutes but I ended up watching all of it.  He really loved it and we enjoyed watching it together.  Is it real?  I have no idea.  But,it was so much better than my expectations that I'm a satisfied customer and would recommend it.

I wouldn't have noticed at all if I didn't watch the scene pass 12:34 then, as the movie is buffering, I see 12:33. Went back to 15:30 to make sure, and this time, without any hiccups, it just changes back to 12:33. They even had a ""digital video tech"" review the footage to prove it's not fake, and he says there is no indication of editing.

5840208,4,B00DP6OTEE,"Whether you believe in ghosts or not, this movie has some great imagery.  Told in ""reality style"", this movie gives just enough to the viewer to make them stop, rewind and play several times throughout the movie while saying ""did I just see that?""",1392940800,,247,4.613636363636363
5840209,4,B00DP6OTEE,"I watch a lot of these type off things. I have to say that The Pantry Ghost Documentary is really scary! If you have a pantry in your kitchen after seeing this movie, you might want to put a curtain over the pantry for a bit.",1392681600,,225,3.9130434782608696
5840210,5,B00DP6OTEE,Very scary stuff.  Makes you believe! Very convincing. Watched the movie and then all the stuff on You Tube about it.  Wow.,1391817600,,123,4.545454545454546
5840211,4,B00DP6OTEE,"I was a little disappointed in myself when I started watching this one. A few minutes into it, I realized that I had seen the clips before on youtube, and I really wasn't that interested in it then. But, hey, I paid a couple bucks, I'm gonna watch this thing. It wasn't terrible. Is it real? Probably not. A lot of folks thought the Blair Witch Project was real. They went and watched it, enjoyed it, found out it wasn't real, and threw a fit. The fact that they got duped shouldn't factor in as to whether or not it was an enjoyable film to watch. Regardless of whether or not the validity of this video can be ascertained, it was entertaining to watch. I find myself hoping that one day it will be found out to be fake, and these clever folks will be long gone with heaping piles of cash. I hereby deem this film worthy of four stars, if for no other reason than it got 60 billion hits on youtube.",1391644800,2,899,4.172413793103448
5840212,1,B00DP6OTEE,This was so lame. People believe this really happened??It was so fake. It was worse than the amityville hoax.it was funny to watch though.,1391299200,2,138,4.791666666666667
5840213,3,B00DP6OTEE,"A very short ""home movie"" type film supposedly showing a ghost that (duh) lives in the pantry of a home.  The man whose family lives in the home begins filming the activities of the apparition which causes the spirit to become bolder.  Some of the video is actually pretty creepy but there's just not much of a film here.  If you're into found footage or home movie horror films, this is definitely up your alley.  If you're looking for a film that will give you a really good scare, this probably isn't for you.",1391040000,2,512,4.414893617021277
5840214,5,B00DP6OTEE,This was pretty cool.  I really enjoyed it. It was a lot scarier than I expected it would be. Cool stuff.,1390953600,,105,4.0
5840215,5,B00DP6OTEE,"...Except for the end with the little girl, they could have left that out. I had my two sisters watch it because I thought it was a good, creepy story and we like that kind of thing.",1390608000,3,182,3.945945945945946

8595763,1,B00DP6OTEE,"What a crock. Note the time stamp jump from 12:34 back to 12:33 in the John video. The ""ghost"" is clearly the daughter. Terrible scripted acting.",1505347200,,145,4.615384615384615
8595764,2,B00DP6OTEE,Utter crap.  Waste of money.  But good for a laugh - especially the daughter and the medium.  It was like watching some terrible community theater outfit putting on a play.,1479513600,,172,4.666666666666667

8595767,4,B00DP6OTEE,"I was intrigued from the beginning. I found it to be compelling and believable, though I had one person watching who said he did not believe it to be believable.

8595769,3,B00DP6OTEE,Wasn't convinced completely if it was real or fake.  They used very old camera equipment because the father refused to work a 9 to 5 job.  He would rather sit in the park and tickle pigeons in their stinky parts.,1442188800,,212,4.275
8595770,5,B00DP6OTEE,"A great story, whether true or not, I still can't figure it out, that creeped me out and had my full attention the entire time. I only wish it had been a couple hours longer! I'd love to know more about the houses history and background. Def worth seeing. I'll Prob watch again at some point. I love ghost stories.. .
