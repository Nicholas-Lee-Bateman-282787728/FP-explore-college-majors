8665591,3,B00LFKIQPU,"I responded yesterday.  I am not satisfied with ALL of the product.  LOTSW 25 & 26 and others that I have purchased contain DUPLICATE episodes.  The ads do not always list the episodes, the result being I am spending money for some new episodes and SOME REPEATS.  The producers of the DVDs should include the titles of the episodes.",1458950400,2,332,4.576271186440678

8665597,5,B00LFKIQPU,"Still pure gold- the very best of English comedy. I have a family connection with Summer Wine Country.  My Great Great Grandfather, John Blackburn, on my Mother's side, married Sarah Anne Battye of Upperthong.  Armed with this information, having seen Last of The Summer Wine,. I booked seven days in the Norah Battye Cottage.  I discovered that I had several connections in that area, Roberttown, Mirfield, Huddesfield etc.  Having first hand knowledge of the area, the streets, the railways, the countryside, it has given me a greater appreciation of the characters and their escapades in the show.  Please hound the BBC to release the remaining series so that I can complete my collection and enjoy same, well and truly, before I "" shuffle off this mortal coil ''.  Thanks, from a very satisfied octogenarian,  Doug Corbett.",1428796800,5,827,5.036764705882353
