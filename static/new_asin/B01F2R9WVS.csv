7741672,4,B01F2R9WVS,"""Green Room"" (2015 release; 94 min.) brings the (mis)adventures of four musicians in a punk band called the Ain't Rights As the movie opens, we see the four of them waking up in their van, after the van slid off the road the night before. It's not long before they meet up with a local radio show host, who is able to book them onto a nearby concert the next day. When the band gets there, they realize that this is a show for Nazi skinheads. When they open their set with a cover of a Dead Kennedys' anti-Nazi tune, the audience gets very restless. Things only get worse from there... At this point we're about 10 minutes into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from writer-director Jeremy Saulnier, who most recently brought us the excellent ""Blue Ruin"". Here, he brings a very different story, namely what happens to a punk band when they accidentally end up performing for Nazi skinheads, and things turn sour (in a very unexpected way--sorry, I cannot reveal more). As soon as the band starts their gig, the movie's tension rackets up and simply never lets go from there until the very end. The cast is an ensemble of no-names, at least for me, with of course the exception of Patrick Stewart. Stewart plays the role of the leader of the Nazi skinheads, and he brings it with ice-cold detachment and ruthlessness. Beware: there are a couple of pretty gruesome scenes, so if that is not your thing, by all means stay away from it. if on the other hand you like a true original horror-thriller story, you are in for quite a treat. Last but not least, there is an excellent soundtrack, both from the original score (composed by Brooke Blair and Will Blair), and also the various songs interwoven into the music. When CCR's ""Sinister Purpose"" starts playing over the movie's end credits, it brings a sense of relief, as in: you made it alive through the end! Which is more than can be said for a number of the characters in the movie...

""Green Room"" premiered at Cannes 2015, exactly a year ago, to critical acclaim. No idea why it's taken this long to get a theatrical release but better late than never I suppose. ""Green Room"" opened on 3 or 4 screens in Greater Cincinnati this past weekend. The early evening screening where I saw this at the other day was attended okay but not great, somewhat to my surprise. In you are in the mood for a top-notch horror-thriller, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Green Room"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1462233600,38,2578,4.530042918454936
7741673,5,B01F2R9WVS,"So intense and well-made in every department. Horrific, funny, disturbing, engaging, scary...it's been in my mind since I saw it four days ago. I can't wait to see it again. I loved Blue Ruin but felt the ending wasn't as strong as the rest of the film. Green Room on the other hand is more consistently excellent from beginning to end. The cast is great, the cinematography is beautiful, the writing and directing are brilliant, the editing is fast-paced, the use of sound and music are effective, the art direction/set design is claustrophobic, the violence is realistic and shocking. The more I think about it, the more I realize how smart and subversive it is.",1462233600,16,664,4.782608695652174

7741689,4,B01F2R9WVS,I enjoyed seeing patrick Stewart in a darker role. He wasn't scary but a cold bad guy. It was a pretty good movie even though most of the actors were mediocre.also the band didn't really look like a hardened,1528761600,,207,4.333333333333333

However, this one wasn't quite as predictable for me and is probably the best horror movie I've seen this year. Definitely worth watching! I love Anton Yelchin and am quite sad that I won't see such a brilliant actor in movies to come. RIP Anton.",1528329600,,413,4.3076923076923075

As someone who is involved in the local punk and metal scene, this one hit home with me. The suspense was unending, and you grow attached to each character, the farther you get into the film. The twists and turns are not easily predictable, and it will definitely have to on the edge of your seat until the credits roll. Highly recommend.",1526256000,,450,4.369047619047619
7741694,3,B01F2R9WVS,I was a big fan of Bluer Ruin so wanted to check this out based on the merit of the director. Not nearly as engaging a film as Blue Ruin but still worth a watch. The premise is strong and the performances are solid across the board.,1525910400,,232,3.9574468085106385
7741695,5,B01F2R9WVS,"Amazing! The best movie I have seen in some time. Although it is a thriller, it is so much more as well. I do not usually do thrillers (just bc they are normally flat), but i loved this, because it was hard-hitting, well-wrought, authentic, sharp, smart, awesome, and personally inspiring. I also do not give many things 5/5 rankings, because something's got to be reserved for the truly great gems out there, but this deserved a 5/5. I'm so sad that Anton Yelchin is not around to keep making movies like this. (The whole cast and director/writer are really great also. They were obvi a good team.)",1525478400,,599,4.607476635514018
7741696,4,B01F2R9WVS,Slow start and a bit drawn out of a movie. But it was intense and I could watch it again...,1525132800,,91,3.6
7741697,4,B01F2R9WVS,"I am a punk and I like movies, especially horror. So it seemed natural this film, that combines both, would be a no-brainer, but that's not necessarily the case with things. I'm from New Jersey but I didn't like Garden State. Green Room is a punk horror film, and it delivers. From early on in the movie, the suspense begins and is quickly relieved, which shows just how masterful this film is and how in control the filmmakers are. You're in for a treat and a ride.

A punk band low on money and just about desperate agree to take a gig that pays a guaranteed amount at a remote venue, which as they find out has a definite neo-Nazi skinhead hardcore bent. They play ""Nazi Punks F--- Off!"" by Dead Kennedys as their first song, and if you aren't familiar with this song, check out the lyrics. This sets the stage for antagonism & tension, but things really go off the deep end when a bandmember stumbles upon something heavy that happens. That's all I'll say. The rest is purely masterful in the way great horror is.

The tension and suspense is so heavy and the violence so brutal that at one point I got a stomach ache, which was a good sign to remind me I'm alive and that something important is happening onscreen.

I was a little skeptical at first of the film for how accurate it would get punk culture -- or would it caricature it? -- but it knows about what it wrote about. I have to say, tho, that for a movie to hold interest, something has to happen, something pretty heavy (which does); most punk shows I've been to have been completely safe, fun, anarchistic events full of mutual support and joyfulness. Don't go into this film not knowing about punk culture and think it's really like this. It's a movie. Something engaging has to happen. The closest I came to the scenario in this film is a lone skinhead at an Agent Orange show. Punks are generally really good people, like the protagonist band.

There is, however, a dark side (like with anything) in the punk world -- the neo-Nazi element in hardcore music -- and it's this dark side that the film delves into so well. For a movie mostly taking place in one location, it has zero trappings of low budget-ness or anemia: it's gripping & meaty from the opening scene to the last, and there are some very powerful images in this movie, such as a pit bull wandering around dragging its own chain leash. The color green, often thought of as relaxing/natural, is used to counterpoint the hellacious events that unfold.

I also think the treatment of good guys/bad guys is nuanced and intelligent -- the neo-Nazis have dimension and even almost pathos (especially Imogen Poots' character), while the good guys aren't exactly squeaky clean. In a time where the so-called alt-right has come out of the woodwork politically and culturally, this is actually a really important film and not just an effective horror film that *happens* to be set at a punk club.

Patrick Stewart does a great job, the equivalent of the neo-Nazi mastermind in American History X, and both films show the hierarchy (and even bureaucracy!) of white supremacist groups. One minor flaw is that a free happy hour lasting two hours would never happen, because punks would drink a ridiculous amount in that time and even crazier shit would happen.

Some people like their horror to be set in contemporary times and be plausible: this is both. Nothing supernatural, just the horror of human politics and people in desperate situations. But for a relatively simple plot, this movie is meaty, tastefully gory, and engaging. This is horror as it should be: visceral yet cerebral, violent without being OTT, realistic, and showing how the wrong decision in life can open up a can of worms like opening Hell itself. Highly, highly recommended.",1524873600,,3770,4.643178410794603

If you don't mind those elements then you'll most likely love this film.

7741714,4,B01F2R9WVS,"Couple takeaways from this movie . First off , its pretty good for what it is . Basically a thriller/horror . It has some pretty gnarly gory scenes in it and its very tense . Have a beer or two before you get into it . One thing that stuck out is how accurate the characters of the "" punk "" scene were.  They weren't underdone like they were pop punk characters or overdone like they were trying too hard .  They were greasy smelly looking ...gritty . Belive it or not , the situation ( without the murder ) is pretty accurate . These "" kind "" of people usually always have some sort of chaos swarming around in their lives even if they weren't nazis . It brought back an old memory and life lesson . Back in the late 80s i was a rocker kid. But even as a mainstream rocker kid, you are connected to the wider community of hard music including hard metal and punk . I also dabbled in the substances back then .

On my adventures of skipping school and partying on the weekends, it was inevitable from time to time that i would wind up at a place like the one in the movie . At times i was so out of it, i would wind up in a car  with people i don't know , going to a "" killer party dude "" . Most of the time nothing went down . But one time i was at one of these sketcher people parties - the hardcore punker types into DRI, Black flag ,SOD and all that , You could tell these people were a little extra "" off "". Anyway , i just chilled back in this old bean bag on the floor . The chick owner of the place ( not really owned, it was squatted ) let out her pet ferret . It starts slinking around the room . Finally it starts crawling on me . I wasn't cool with that at all so i started saying, "" get it off . get it off "". They kept telling me it wouldn't hurt me yadayada .. I was saying in a strained voice "" get it off ! "" The people started laughing including this big ogre dude . Now i was getting pissed . The people i came with told them "" come on man, get it off him "" . Finally when it was crawling up my arm for the 100th time i flicked it off. It made a squeek but i didn't hurt it at all . The chick flipped out , the big dude was wanting to kill me . Literally . At one point he pulled a knife . There was a stalemate with me and the people i came with and this ogre and his girl . It lasted about a half hour before he was talked down . Over a dumb ferret . That's how these people roll and this movie nailed those kind of characters. As we were driving out , there was another argument in the car because i said i was calling the cops on them ( for threatening with a deadly weapon ) . One guy in the car who knew them was threatening to turn back ( even though he wasn't driving ) . I threatened to deal with him and all of them ...saying ill grab the wheel and crash us, ill turn you all in etc.  I finally got one guy in the car to corroborate my story and go to the police with me . We got back , and we turned them in . We rode with the cops to the place, we identified the guy when they took him out . The whole thing turned into a drug bust .It was on the news the next night.

It was not good for me for a couple of months . I had schoolwork sent home etc . Was in fear for my safety . I learned a very valuable lesson.

So these "" kind "" of people are no good and this movie perfectly illustrates that.  So much so that it made me flash back to that time . There is a difference between odd weird people and flat out psychos . Be careful with who you hang with.",1521158400,,3485,3.7191316146540028

Once it kicked of the start of the conflict i was anticipating every moment. The cast was small so it kept things from getting bloated, the isolation made the setting feel very claustrophobic.

Im not going to spill the whole story like others love to do, writing their walk through novels of the movie, which I feel ruins a review. People can get an idea of what its about with the option of playing the trailer.

It had a good amount of twists and unexpected turns. I honestly did not know what to expect around every corner. It escalates rapid in some moments and others not so much but it flows nicely enough to keep your attention. There were moments that had me yelling at the character. Its kind of like Goldilocks and the three bears, it was done just right. It wasn't full of back alley tripping with a killer right behind, and what the characters did and tried to do seemed a little more realistic compared to most horrors where people are stumbling idiots and damsels in distress. It does have gore and plenty of blood but its not overly done where stuff is squirting out and shooting across the room. I was skeptical and honestly didn't want to give this movie a shot, but decided after a long days work to give this one a try and very happy that I did. The trailer leaves out a lot and skims most of the stuff which is how it should be, which honestly had me waiting to be disappointed after watching the movie but it was nothing like what i was expecting it to be.

7741780,1,B01F2R9WVS,"I really liked Blue Ruin and felt that it had some purpose and character to it, unlike Green Room which was pretty disappointing. This was little more than a gore fest. And I don't mind violence when it has it's place but this trades thrills and scares in for gore.

*There will be minor spoilers.* The plot is a straight up mess. It starts out fine, but this whole idea that Anton Yelchin's character would immediately start freaking out and call the police in front of a bunch of people who obviously don't want him to call the police is absurd. They know they're in a bad place, it's no secret that it's a place full of questionable people and yet he's losing his cool so quickly when all he has to do is remain calm and tell them he didn't see anything. All he has to do is stop and think for a minute and explain himself but instead he listens to the girl who he doesn't know and she asks him to call 911. Why? After all he was the only one who went in the room and he could've persuaded them to let him walk and then if he really wanted to he could've later phoned the police. Instead he loses his cool in front of the bad people who are now very upset and angry that he just called the police. The whole thing is absurd and doesn't make sense.

And the fact that there's dozens of skinheads around but they can't take on five people locked in a room is ridiculous. There's no way any of them would've survived long enough to arm themselves and make themselves look like Johnny freaking Rambo and kill all the bad guys. You're telling me dozens of these psychos who are clearly not opposed to violence can't take on five people who are way in over their heads. They barely know how to use a weapon and yet these skinheads who are no strangers to killing are unable to easily defeat them? Plus they're on the skinheads' turf. All of them should be eaten by dogs, diced up, and shot full of holes in minutes, maybe an hour tops. And that does happen to some of them but the fact that any of them would survive is absurd. And we're supposed to believe that a guy who's arm is so mangled (he should be in so much pain and not even be walking after awhile), and a woman are able to overpower multiple fully armed and strong neo Nazis. Wouldn't happen. Its almost as if the neo Nazis let them win because they make stupid decisions and don't appear to know what they're doing. So it's one of those movies where if dumb things don't happen then there's no movie, so I guess you just have to accept that. I had a very hard time buying it though.

I'm not sure what people are talking about when they say this movie has a lot of twists and turns, this was fairly standard and predictable. I also wasn't impressed with the performance of most of the leads. Patrick Stewart was completely wasted and Anton Yelchin was just mumbly and unconvincing. I don't know, didn't enjoy this like I thought I would. The plot didn't make a whole lot of sense but I would be able to forgive that if it was at least exciting, this was seriously lacking in tension. Usually a movie like this doesn't need a strong plot or characters, but this was even lacking in basic things that make a good thriller or horror movie. I wouldn't recommend it, watch Blue Ruin instead if you want a more original and interesting movie.",1499040000,,3297,4.272

7741790,1,B01F2R9WVS,"Horror is a genre I often steer away from. Yet I'm always intrigued when a horror movie comes out that receives critical acclaim. See, I love horror. It is the most visceral and natural form of film making. This is why it's such a tragedy that the genre has been neglected by talent, and is often a cheap thrill cooked up as a quick cash grab. Like pornography. In fact horror is often a lot like pornography in the way that characters act in ways, not that advance their own agenda or reveal something meaningful about their character, but to allow further scenes of senseless pain and anguish to befall characters that, often, we are meant to hate.

So naturally, when people I respect highly are attached to a project that sounds very different for a horror film, I can get pretty excited.

Green room is about a band (spoilers ahead) on tour in their van. The movie starts out with some slice of life bits, that set up the characters and world nicely. They are not necessarily care free, but they are free. And the scenes are at least competently shot, directed and scored. They are broke. So broke they can't afford gas. They meet a mohawk touting punk rocker about a gig they drove here to play. It's canceled. They are screwed. So they end up getting scheduled for a gig at some place in the middle of nowhere with some far left and far right people.

Well when they get there, it's a bunch of Nazi's. Scary freaking Nazis. Not a ""he was wearing a make America great again hat"" kind of Nazi. No, the actual kind of Nazi. So what do they do? They play their extremely original song ""Nazi Punch"" (I think that's what they said).

I hate these kids. And as we've already discussed, that's a very bad sign.

Anyways, they play their set and go back to the green room. A girl has been stabbed, they're all witnesses now. They're all told to wait. Patrick Stewart finally shows up, and he is a lot like Jean Luc Picard as a Nazi. The kids overpower and kidnap the guy watching them and take his gun, and they lock the door. Things are looking bleak, but Patrick Stewart will let the kids go if they just let him have the gun.

Dumb.

So they give up the gun (of course) and Anton Yelchin gets his hand mangled, and we get to listen to his very authentic and painful sounding cries throughout the entire scene. Now I knew this was not going to be an easy film to watch. And I was prepared for just this sort of thing. But to have it be from something so stupid, it undercut any emotional underpinning or deeper feeling I could have, other than visceral empathy. Horrible, wicked empathy. And I will congratulate everyone involved in this movie for helping highlight Anton's amazing work. But frankly, although it may have been difficult to watch, there was absolutely no payoff for doing so. Immediately, any tension the movie may have had was deflated. I understand that films sometimes require us to endure tragic things vicariously, but understand that tapping only the centers of pain in a film is like creating a dish that is all salt and no other flavor or substance. It's just gross, and unpalatable. Maybe it's unfair to this film, but losing Anton so recently has left a fresh wound, and I suppose hearing him cry like that may have rubbed where it was still raw. Full disclosure. But I will try not to let it affect my scoring of the film.

I did sit through the entire movie, just to confirm it was bad from beginning to end. It was. Now a lot of people worked on the movie, and I don't see any flaws with how the movie is made. Maybe the actors could have been directed more strongly. I don't know, honestly I think it all just comes down to bad writing. Why Patrick Stewart and Anton Yelchin signed on to this script is a mystery to me.",1497571200,,3749,4.39193083573487

It's very scary, fairly original, and a strange balance calm tension. I won't give any of the plot away, but it plays off a fairly believable premise with some very unfortunately timing. I found the character development fairly strong (for a horror movie). The sense of fear was ambient and claustrophobic. The plot progressed with believable turns; no one ran upstairs to get away from the killer (etc.). The roles were strong, yet subtle. It has some gore, but it's not over-the-top gross out stuff.

Their dilemma results in a solid claustrophobic thriller that proves that being a dilettante about something - in this case, playing music about rebelling against the status quo - is a world apart from living the lifestyle. I especially enjoyed Anton Yelchin's (R.I.P.) performance as the bass player who best realizes how much trouble the band is in and Patrick Stewart as the white supremacists' all business, all the time leader. Still, despite the unusual premise and strong cast, it ranks somewhere in the middle of the pack when compared to recent claustrophobic thrillers like 10 Cloverfield Lane and The Invitation.",1490659200,,753,5.07258064516129

It would have been more interesting to focus on the psychological terror that exists when you realize there are such subversive people in our society that are racist, uneducated loose cannons that are prone to extreme violence...and you are stuck in their twisted world and cannot escape.  That's more than enough terror.

I had to end it at the ridiculously gory scenes that turned this from exhibiting a semblane of intelligence to just pandering to some people's sick need to see people graphically mutilated.

Another wasted opportunity: For those that love the low-brow gore, the script waited too long for it.  Who needs much of a story line for that.  Just start ripping people apart in the first 10 minutes, go non-stop and throw in some gratuitous sex to add even more twisted excitement to this junk genre of films.

The movie starts out with a punk band looking for a solid gig. The plot takes a bit of time to setup, but the company of the genuine characters makes the build bearable.

What started as a productive venture for the band takes a drastic turn when a dumb-luck occurrence thrusts them into gruesome scenario that leaves them trapped in the titular room.

The calm demeanor of Patrick Stewart's character masks the cold-blooded calculations of a thorough and evil man, which contrasts the moments when things really take a turn for the worse in the service of surprise. The suspense only builds from these early moments as the situation becomes more dire.

This movie is gory, but not unreasonably so: all of the violence plays out realistically and never over the top.

While the story seems grounded in reality, there are a handful of circumstances that feel questionable, some of which may make more sense upon subsequent views as some of the subplots get swept up in the overall story.

Well worth popcorn. To start  I was blown away Patrick Stewart, and Imogen Poot!  Not bad for a low budget movie. The beginning is hard to follow. Storyline plot ok. Characters and action sequences awkward. Patrick Stewart if anyone knows much of the movies he plays in, this is one of his best ive seen in sometime. Imogen, we remember her from V For Vendetta, not what I was expecting of her acting. But last 30 minutes, the film loses steam and slides into a somewhat weak climax unworthy of the first hour.  I wish the ending would have wowed more.  Not so much a horror a thriller/ suspense/Action. Gory some call it. well acted than some low budget movies I recommend it",1484956800,,844,4.549668874172186

I always feel everyone is entitled to their opinion and I often dislike movies that others have loved however I was surprised by the amount of negative or average reviews so thought I would leave my views. I don't do spoilers so all I will say is I found this movie to be extremely tense, I enjoyed the kill scenes and the overall story, although not being particularly original was probably done better than any similar movies i can remember. It;s refreshing to see this type of movie with real people rather than a bunch of everyday cowering apparently normal people who when we are all honest are nothing like most of us.

If you watch something like this then you are saying that you agree with it. I could not watch more than the first few minutes before i had to turn it off. How about a movie involving a safe and hopeful place or subject instead of all this murder, sex and killing! We have ISIS and MK ULTRA Manchurian Candidates killing us in the real world already! Why do we need to watch more of it on TV. I'm done with this type of subject matter and Amazon/ Netflix practically in totality.

The violence is extremely fast and there is always a lot of build up. The cast is great, and this is definitely a good movie to remember Anton Yelchin; as this was clearly one of the defining roles by which he was coming into his own as an actor. Patrick Stewart is great as always; playing as the owner/leader of the Nazi encampment as this whole movie chases the real world version of Neo-Naziism and keeps everything within the high realm of possibility. Though I would strongly recommend that nobody watches any sort of trailer or anything for this film. Going into it blind is definitely the ideal way to watch this film. Also, it is not for those weak of heart and/or stomach. There are multiple extremely gory scenes depicting very realistic violence. Also, if you don't really like dogs or have a fear of them...

Plays the bands singer and it's a brutally violent film. He is known for playing the beloved  Russian in Star Trek.

I had just finished watching the excellent thriller ""Don't Breathe"" and went there to get more info on the movie (as I generally do for movies that I really like) and this one came up as something I'd enjoy watching.  Green Room starts off kinda slow as we get an intro to the main characters (the band) and their struggles to make it on the punk rock club scene, but it quickly picks up some serious steam as the band seemingly find themselves in an impossible situation.

Don't let the beginning lull you into a false sense of normalcy. This is a violent survival film. You WILL feel sympathy for the characters, and the violence hits like a fist in the gut. The synopsis does a fair job of telling the plot, but I in no way expected the horrifying violence depicted up close. Be prepared that the antagonists are ""neo nazi - white supremacists"", and while brutality for the sake of such seems to be part of their daily life - it is the money operation (heroin sales) the club owner is worried about protecting. Great dialogue, great acting - Patrick Stewart is incidental. Everyone in this film is a capable actor.

Not for the faint of heart, definitely has a sudden ending, but is well worth the 90 minutes of your time.",1482105600,,456,4.734177215189874

7742335,4,B01F2R9WVS,"Unexpected goodness!  I didn't think this was going to be worth renting, so I waited til it went PRIME. I felt that with Patrick Stewart on board, surely it would have some merit. I didn't watch the preview, as I generally believe doing so will spoil it me. For the first 15 minutes, I was slightly intrigued as the movie has something to do with a punk rock band. Having played in such a band, I was willing to give it more than my usual ""15 and I am OUT!"" for movies that don't keep my attention. At 15 minutes, I was ready to bail. But the band (the ""stars"" of the tale) had just played, and their set scene was VERY surreal...so...I hung on a bit longer. BAM! 17:17 in and the whole thing changed! Now we have a real story. I could see that the First 15 were a cute theatrical ploy to lure the viewer into a somber, unsuspecting mindset. Wow! From 17:17, I was wide awake and paying full attention.

If you plan to watch the movie, don't read any further as it may reduce the overall power of that 17:17 moment!

Well-executed in most aspects, this is a very dark and sinister movie that will keep you glued to the edge of your seat!

Semi-Spoiler Alert: If you like suspense, drama, uncertainty, mayhem, and a little gore and violence....okay....more than a little....you will like this movie.",1482019200,10,1298,4.373443983402489

7742338,4,B01F2R9WVS,"Unexpected twists and engaging story.  I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. I went in, unsure what to expect even after reading the description. There will be spoilers in this review.  First and foremost, if you are hoping to see a lot of Patrick Stewart you will probably be a little disappointed as it takes awhile for him to show up and he isn't as actively involved in the situation as some other characters; good performance when he is onscreen.

The first fifteen minutes or so of the movie are a little slow as you're just mostly getting to know the band and see what they do and how they get gigs and what kind of money they are making off them.  The movie doesn't really pick up to they get to the rather bizarre (and I hope not too common) Nazi divebar/club.  A band member leaves her phone in the room and someone goes back to retrieve it, stumbling onto a crime scene.  The other band members quickly wind up in the room with him.  They are also, apparently, above a secret heroin clinic which never gets widely explored but seems to be causing a lot of issue for the club owner (Stewart's character).

Once all in the room together with one of the Nazi club members and a partygoer that you remember seeing during the band's performance, things turn rather bleak for the band pretty quickly.  The de-facto leader of the band does take things into his own hands initially and you are given some hope and for a little bit things start looking better--- but turn bleak again real fast.  However, this guy does do some of the things you would think to do and it's interesting to hear the band members and the party goer all argue amongst themselves and with other about what actions they should take. The de-facto band leader who has experience wrestling and the female party goer seem to be the ones willing to make the most ruthless decisions.  It's unfortunate that they are on opposite sides as the band tends to bicker with her seeing her only as another Nazi member.

The movie does have a lot of gore as the Nazi members are ruthless even bringing out Rotweilers (I think, maybe Pitbulls? I'm not really a dog breed person) that literally eat flesh and bone; the fate of a couple people.  There are a lot of guns and you do see one person get their face blown off.  There are knives, too.  There is a lot of blood and gore.  You don't quite expect the ending.  Overall, a good movie that keeps you engaged and interested to see who, if anyone, will make it out alive.",1482019200,,2488,4.421052631578948

Some of the dialogue was hard for me to understand because the characters were using a lot of slang which was not familiar to me. But the dry humor between the band members was a plus. There was much action, suspense and thrills to keep the audience interested throughout and the writers had a decent plot where the characters had to devise ways to outsmart their captors. I had never seen Patrick Stewart portray this type of character. He was surprisingly good. The female characters were not just there as window dressing.

7742501,5,B01F2R9WVS,"Saulnier carves out a workable middle ground between the intellectual nihilism of indie fare like Eden Lake and the more commercially minded torture porn of Saw and its ilk. Its not quite as surprisingly humane as Blue Ruin, but the same impulse to dig into the moral fabric of exploitive genre conventions is certainly alive and well. The films weakness is that in order to adhere to a well-regulated dispensation and occasional subversion of genre conventions, the action is artificially hindered by the meticulous scheming of Patrick Stewarts central villain, a man who seems to plan murder and body disposal based on its potential for dramatic time-dialation. In these moments where it becomes obvious that Saulnier needs to address such questions as why don't they just rush in and shoot everyone?, the films shaggy but firm sense of control loosens, and the spell lifts to expose the thinly veiled bones of the not-quite-precision plot mechanics. But these are minor distractions, and mostly Saulnier manages to provide the genre goods with a generous dollop of intelligence and surprise. If Blue Ruin proved to be thrilling in its understatement, here the young auteur gets bloodier and nastier without losing his soul  an admirable accomplishment in any time but practically a singular triumph in modern Hollywood.",1481241600,,1322,5.206572769953052

7742576,5,B01F2R9WVS,"I have to admit that I'm biased.  Watching Green Room is pretty thrilling, it has an unexpected twist or two or three or four.  It is a subject and genre that I don't typically seek out.  So why did I find this movie?  I knew about it because most of the outdoor scenes were filmed at my property.  I got to be a part of the filming of the movie in many ways.  I got to see how sets are built.  I got to watch the filming itself.  I got to know and understand the people, materials and equipment behind the making of movies.  I got to meet the director and stars of the movie.  And I got to have Sir Patrick Steward as a house guest in my home for five days.  When they wrapped up the filming at my property, I was then able to go to the industrial park where they had set up the stages for all the interior shooting.  That was a whole new experience.  In the end I was able to help with the catering crew to serve the cast and crew at the wrap party after shooting the final scene.  It was great.  The cherry on top was to be able to attend the premier of the movie in Portland with everyone and anyone that had something to do with the movie.  Probably the greatest benefit is that I will never watch a movie again without sitting through the credits at the end of the movie.  I have an entirely new appreciation for what it takes to make a great movie.

So, yes, I'm biased AND it is a very good movie.  You really should watch it.  Jeremy Saulnier is a writer/director that you want to keep an eye on.  I also highly recommend Jeremie's previous movie, Blue Ruin.  It is equally good, a very well written script as well and received many prestigious awards for a first time award winner.",1480982400,,1691,4.091463414634147

The star studded cast an enormous treat so the fact the acting was superb goes without saying. I loved it so much I watched it again as soon as the credits rolled from watching it the first time. A completely Awesome movie you won't regret watching.

ON A PERSONAL NOTE: It was a saddening to watch the extremely talented Anton Yelchin performing his role, knowing that in the real world, he wouldn't be making any more movies. It's always a shame when we lose such a talented actor so young. My dream for a sequel to Odd Thomas forever dashed, being able to watch the birth of new characters in other roles (that he would perform), forever lost.",1479772800,4,777,4.51063829787234

At this one grimmey hole in the wall frequented by white supremecists they happen to witness a murder.  This murder will expose some bigger secrets for the owner and his crew, so they want the witnesses extinguished.  Many have complained about Patrick Stewart's performance.  He has always carried air of authority as he has in Star Trek, although he's on the wrong side here.

A punk band is on the last legs of a faltering ""tour"", having just played at a Mexican Food restaurant, they manage to land a gig at an out of the way club in Oregon. When they arrive at the club, they find that it's a bar for Skinheads. They decide to play the gig, grab the dough and get out, but once inside, one of the band members witnesses a murder.

I don't care about the wimpy do-nothing kids and the pointless dialogue, it could've come out all right if it weren't such an outsiders interpretation of the punk rock scene and the white power movement.  I grew up going to punk shows and then spent quite a bit of time in prison so I've been around a lot of punks and a lot of white supremacists and this struck me as horribly fake.  Not movie-fake or unreal, just a lame attempt to create characters after watching some behind-the-scenes footage of a Green Day tour and a few episodes of Lockup Raw.  Just dumb and polarizing in general.",1479427200,,725,4.5038167938931295
7742719,5,B01F2R9WVS,"The Green Room is what would have happened if Alfred Hitchcock directed ""the Raid"".I mean that as high praise. If you haven't seen the Raid or any Alfred Hitchcock movie, go watch them first because you're missing out.

If you're not quite sure what this movie is all about, like I was, - no, sadly it's not the NextGen/J.J.Abrahams crossover we've all been waiting for. This is an intense film full of swift brutality and a set of sympathetic characters in the wrong place at the wrong time.

I was really engaged throughout the film. I never found myself being able to guess what would happen next. Each of the characters were distinct and interesting or likable to where I was really rooting for them to make it out. The violence is fairly gruesome and is shocking in its speed and surprise.
Anton Yelchin from the new start trek films was in it, at first I wasn't that impressed by his performance but in retrospect each actor is fairly understated to where you're not quite sure who the ""star"" is, so you're never sure who might die next. When the movie suddenly rips into full throttle everyone does a great job, the performances, the pacing, and the plots little twists and turns all make film an intense experience.
By the end of the movie you'll see how talented Anton Yelchin was, I found myself feeling somewhat sad after the film ended as I reflected on this talented person who was taken far too soon.

Another under appreciated talent is the guy who plays the bouncer, this actor was in Blue Ruin which has a lot of similarities in that it was almost a ""realistic"" version of a typical action movie. What it it wasn't some ex-marine played byArnold Schwarzenegger, what if it was just a regular guy. He's definitely not the typical henchmen.

Just to illustrate some of the unexpected twists and turns I'll give a mild spoiler. One of the villains uses a trained attack dog as a weapon with gruesome effect, the dog gets loose and while separated from the dog its master is killed. When the dog returns to the scene, rather than attacking the once ferocious monster melts into a sadness and rests his head on the chest of its fallen master. The movie made me feel sympathy for this animal that was a just presented as a monster.

Take note of every detail in the film - every prop, every piece of set design, every character no-matter how minor or major, has an intricately woven backstory that creates a world far more realized than any other contemporary filmmaker.

That said, this film is not suited for everyone's taste. It's an ultra-violent, wildly harsh story, located in the ecocentrism of punk-rock ideology. The story's message is also incredibly opaque, most likely leaving some viewers scratching their heads.

*Plot and ending analyzed*

Green Room is a pathetic attempt at making a credible ""self-defense film"" whereby a bunch of inept, badly injured morons, get their way out of a heavily armed neo-fascist punk club.  The premise wouldn't be bad if the director, who is also the writer, takes so many turns into the realm of complete idiocy.

With such an absurd premise, he should have at least made the attempt at a bit of realism.  I mean, one hairy goon with a shotgun could have done away with all the annoying punk musicians easily.",1476316800,3,573,4.578431372549019

7742782,4,B01F2R9WVS,"A down-on-their-luck punk rock band gets possibly the worst gig ever--they play an afternoon set at a white supremacist bar. They don't know what their getting into, of course. The guy who arranges the gig just tells them not to talk politics. The band is more interested in drinking and goofing around, which they do until one of them witnesses a killing. They wind up locked in the green room of the bar and have to try to negotiate their way out. Things do not go well. The bar is owned by Darcy (Patrick Stewart) who is the sort of cool, collected, and ruthless man no one should try to outsmart.

The movie is very tense. The initial ten or fifteen minutes seems like a road movie for the band but the road ends pretty quickly at the bar. By that point they are established enough as characters that viewers care for their plight. The band struggles to figure out the situation and find some way out, either by talking or sneaking away. The situation doesn't go well for anyone. Enough little twists pop up to keep things engaging and more believable and more horrifying. The violence is very intense when it happens and is very gory.

I wouldn't call this a fun movie but it is engaging and a great example of a ""siege thriller."" With the graphic injuries, it's not for the feint of heart, either. It's probably more like 3.5 stars, so round up or down depending on your stamina.",1475798400,,1385,4.470355731225297

But wait...someone left Unfortunately,  the green room (where talent hangs out before a show) just happens to have a new guest--a murdered young woman.  Yes, do the moral thing and call 911 for help - right in front of the probably murderers! quirky premise and wait to see how the police are conned when they show up.

No surprise that our band members realize they are now in danger as they are held hostage in the green room as they realize the police won't be coming. Is there a way out?  The club owner (Patrick Stewart) wants no witnesses so our heroes are doomed or are they? Soon it all hits the fan with knifes, guns and killer attack dogs. This is one wild ride full of suspense and thrills. It's dark and disturbing but if you like a good thriller, you'll be glued to your TV.  The band members put up a fight to the death to escape the green room. This one will keep you in suspense.

There is a sad note to add here as others have mentioned.  I was really impressed with the actor playing Pat--the sort of meek and mousey member of the band who eventually becomes the brave and strong one. His performance was stunning and I wanted to point out his exceptional performance as an actor to keep an eye on. He is an actor I want to see in other films. Sadly, I realized the actor is Anton Yelchin- who died in a  very tragic accident a few months ago in 2016. A truly remarkable actor gone way too soon.

7742788,4,B01F2R9WVS,"More of a survival thriller than a horror film, Green Room sees an amateur young punk bank playing a gig in a skinhead pub. When their show is over they find their stuff in the hallway, are told the headline act is in the green room, paid and shown the door.  However one of them has left his mobile phone charging in the room so instead of knocking on the door like you'd think you would for a dressing room since you know people could be getting dressed and all and asking for it back, he just barges in to get it.  It's there, but so is a dead girl with a box cutter in the side of her head. The rest of the band is escorted back into the room where one of them dials 911 before her phone is taken off her.  The band is left with a bouncer and are told they aren't leaving.  Basically the premise of Green Room is will any of them make it out alive?

The movie is pretty slow to begin with, it takes 17 minutes for the start of what you know the film is about to begin.  The band aren't the most likable people in the world either, they fall asleep at the wheel, steal petrol out of cars, but they are obviously a lot better people than the skinheads so you still root for them.  It isn't as heavy on the gore as most will probably have hoped for, it isn't up there with the classic Straw Dogs or other leading films of this genre, but it's still a decent film.  If you're into Punk music perhaps you'll get a little more out of it.  Being one of Anton Yelchin's last films also increases the you should check it out factor.",1475280000,,1527,4.029801324503311

Then they stumble into a room where a crime has been committed. Now they are the only non locals to have seen it and all of a sudden they go from being guests to being in deep trouble.

Now I thought this was going to be a slasher horror type and so was a bit non plussed at the thought. However, it is a rollicking and very tense thriller. There are some superb performances here too.

Down on their luck punk rockers The Aint Rights are finishing up a long and unsuccessful tour, and are about to call it quits when they get an unexpected booking at an isolated, run-down club deep in the backwoods of Oregon. What seems merely to be a third-rate gig escalates into something much more sinister when they witness an act of violence backstage that they weren't meant to see. Now trapped backstage, they must face off against the clubs depraved owner, Darcy Banker (Stewart), a man who will do anything to protect the secrets of his nefarious enterprise. But while Darcy and his henchmen think the band will be easy to get rid of, The Aint Rights prove themselves much more cunning and capable than anyone expected, turning the tables on their unsuspecting captors and setting the stage for the ultimate life-or-death showdown.

This is a brilliant and brutal thriller, certainly one of the best movie releases of the year, a tense, edge of your seat movie with a dark fast paced story that has a grisly unfolding, who knows what will happen to these characters as they have to fight for their lives! The cast is strong all round, Anton Yelchin is great, its just a shame this was one of his last moves, Patrick Stewart plays a darker, shadier character than usual, the movie has a large amount of bloody violence all done very well, the movie has a great claustrophobic feeling of dread and being trapped and the music score helps carry it all out too. Highly recommend this to anyone who has not seen it, a gem of a movie.

7742807,5,B01F2R9WVS,"This will probably be the best horror film of 2016. A punk-rock band on the skids and desperate for cash agrees to play a gig at a neo-Nazi skinhead compound in the Pacific Northwest. All seems to go okay until they witness a murder. They're held captive along with a female friend of the deceased, until it becomes clear that the supremacists' only option is to leave no witnesses and frame the band for everything. Cue the relentless bloodbath as our protagonists must fight for their lives. I been waiting to see this ever since I heard about it, so I hit the theater right away upon it's release; I was not disappointed. Writer/director Jeremy Salunier brought us the superb thriller Blue Ruin, which I loved, but he's outdone himself here. Instead of the atmospheric, slow-burn approach, Saulnier goes for all-out Grand Guignol and delivers the goods with one intensely gruesome gore set-piece after another. Even better, the script is quite intelligent; the dialogue is very smart and don't think you know what's going to happen next because you don't, I assure you, as Saulnier subverts the slasher-movie cliches. The cast are all superb, led by Anton Yelchin and Imogen Poots (she is especially good) and Patrick Stewart (of all people!) is chilling as the leader of the neo-Nazis; he wisely goes for the more low-key, understated, coldly rational, ""banality of evil"" approach instead chewing up the scenery. Even good old Macon Blair, the lead from Blue Ruin, has a nice supporting role as one of Stewart's minions who turns out to have a conscience. I'm telling you, once this got going, I was on the edge of my seat or nearly leaping out of it the rest of the way. WARNING: only for those with strong stomachs.

7742811,4,B01F2R9WVS,"This movie is a showcase for the talents of director Jeremy Saulnier. Green Room has a conventional confined-space premise. What makes it unusual is that Saulnier slows the pace of the movie to generate suspense and gauge character response to on-screen events. He also avoids the cliche of short takes and rapid cuts. It's a gamble that pays off.

Patrick Stewart's performance complements Saulnier's style. Stewart avoids histrionics in favor of playing a tough character who is ruthless but never sadistic. It's not a great performance, but it is very careful and well judged.

The movie's final moments are its finest. Saulnier contrasts his two survivors with shots of Nature and quick clips of other characters doing routine things. The impact is to remind us that the terrible struggle and violence we've witnessed will go unrecognized and unredressed. I don't think this movie has a nonviolence message, but I do think that is underlines the futility of violence.",1473552000,,971,5.139240506329114

7742849,4,B01F2R9WVS,"Green Room is an invitation to discover a new level of violence. It deals with the clash between the cries and riffs of a punk band whose incendiary theme triggers the ferocity of a bunch of skin-heads.

What it seems to me original from the audacious perspective resides in the fact we are confronting the verbal violence of the musical imagery against the real world. I mean: Who are the good guys or the bad guys? Everything's a mess. And the process of shooting depicts this state of things. The green room is a powerful allegory around the violence. Seen from the wild side of the skin heads, the violence is systematic, cold and merciless; everything works out according the expected rules. But when the members of the band are forced to act, the human condition shows us the unbelieveable can spring.

In this sense, the film made me evoke ""Straw dogs"" and ""Deliverance"". The cathartic experience will emerge and hover the stage while the film runs out. Effective project.

Nice try with the ending song: ""Sinister purpose"" of Credence Clearwater Revival.",1472256000,,1062,4.824175824175824

7742851,4,B01F2R9WVS,"It's a story you're familiar with, many film fans will likely recognize it best from Deliverance, but what writer/director Jeremy Saulnier has done with this story is fill it up with gasoline and light it up. What you do or don't know going in, really doesn't matter, it's what the film does to you after the first 20 minutes that does.

It is VERY rare that you will see a modern day thriller that has the intensity of anything close to this. Because this is not a ""Hollywood"" film and doesn't have many big name actors, the threats feel very real and that makes them genuinely terrifying. The acting is excellent but specifically it's the cinematography and color grading (a dark green hue) that stand out and add to that unnerving feeling throughout the film.

Of course, in watching this movie you realize what a great talent we have lost in such a tragic way, far too soon. This may definitively be the best performance of Anton Yelchin's career, and unfortunately it looks like he was really just getting started. Green Room is mostly a thriller, but it also can feel like a horror movie. If you can handle that I highly recommend watching this fierce thriller.",1472169600,2,1167,4.632850241545894

7742867,5,B01F2R9WVS,"""Green Room"" is a homage of any number of siege flicks coming to mind would be ""Rio Bravo"", ""Assault on Precinct 13"", ""Zulu"" and ""Aliens"".  Director Jeremy Saulnier invests a lot of his own inspiration into the film notably the punk rock setting and the parallels between the Third Reich and latter day white supremacy.  One can also not overlook the stunning portrayal of Darcy by Patrick Stewart, a latter day skinhead commandant.  Stewart's turn is one of cold deliberateness his every horrific order to his unquestioning minions bone chilling.  Set in an isolated roadhouse in the Oregon woodlands Saulnier ratchets all the requisite tension, horror and claustrophobia from this locale.  ""Green Room"" is definitely one of this year's unexpected successes.",1471564800,,759,5.239669421487603

Movie follows a punk/thrash band and that's the only rough spot, the music.  Not my style and it made the beginning of the movie a little tough to watch.  However, the punk element was needed for the story and I think it worked out great.

There were several things I liked about this movie. First of all, the atmosphere was perfect. I've been to a few punk shows in my day, but nothing as gritty as the setting used for this movie. I was honestly nervous for the characters when they first arrived. It was really set the tone for the movie. Secondly, the acting was fantastic. All of the characters did a wonderful job of conveying how scary the situation was. I truly felt a sense of dread and worry while watching this. Finally, I loved how realistic the story line was. Although I hope I would never find myself in this kind of situation, there's no denying that it could happen. That made the Green Room so much scarier.

Overall, I highly recommend. There were a some gory parts, so be warned of that. But truly, I have no complaints. One of the better movies I've seen in a while!",1471046400,,1094,4.410891089108911

7742896,2,B01F2R9WVS,"Thats 5-bucks down the drain and it required the sub-titles to understand the mumbling dialog of the cast. This may be a spoiler but its about one band member that kills a woman and is sent on their way and another band that say the body and all must die. The summary I read stated A band straying into a secluded part of the Pacific Northwest stumbles onto a horrific act of violence. Because they are the only witnesses, they become the targets of a terrifying gang of skinheads who want to make sure all the evidence is eliminated. That part about destroying all the evidence is where it all falls apart because everyone was a witness, or at least knew of what happened, so why would the members of one band the only ones that need to be eliminated because we can trust all those others not to say a word? Its not a horror movie and though its got a few clever moments its awfully disappointing and mumbling makes it even harder until you realize that most of whats being said is not all that important. The fact that this band can kill so many of the big bad boys is also a leap. I usually trust IMDb but now that its owned by this company I seriously doubt that 7.2 rating is not without a little fine tuning. We didn't like it but since opinions vary good luck but we watched this right after The Great Hypnotist and that got 5-stars from us and it had sub-titles because it was Chinese and not because everyone was mumbling.",1470528000,3,1431,4.303703703703704

It was a little tense at right after they walked in on the dead body, but once Patrick Stewart got there (although his acting was good), it just got boring, and I didn't really care if any of the punk band got out alive.

Spoilers, so stop reading if you don't want to know more.

There was just too many, Are You Really That Stupid and There is No Way moments, that happened for me to get into the movie. Now if it was supposed to be a campy B-Movie that would be one thing, but this movie was taking itself seriously.

I knew nothing about it going in, besides that the music in it was punk rock. I didn't read any reviews, watch any previews, or even read the back of the DVD. I had seen lots of people saying they liked it, so I was really hoping I would too.

First the whole, Ill trade a gun for a phone. Then the way Antons arm was broken, and they just patched him up with duct tape. (Nope, he would be in so much pain and unable to move at all, even with adrenaline pumping through him. He may have been able to do a bit at first, but he would not have lasted as long as he did).

And the way the killings went, they were really fast, so there was not much of a cat and mouse effect happening. I kept thinking it would turn into a werewolf movie, with the meat grinder note, and the way the Nazis seemed like a pack. Maybe it would have redeemed itself a bit.

The best part of the movie for me, was when they told the real music they would take to a desert island. I would say skip this one unless you really like one of the actors, and want to watch it just to see how they do.",1470355200,,1648,3.9487951807228914
7742902,4,B01F2R9WVS,"I knew really nothing about this movie going in. I read a few reviews just to get the gist of it but that's about it. And after watching Green Room I'm happy to say that it was definitely worth watching. In a nutshell the film is about a band named the Ain't Rights, who are struggling for money and end up getting a gig at a neo-nazi hangout. Things start to take a nasty turn just when the gig is over and the band tries to leave. I can't tell you much more without giving anything else away.

 I would classify this film as a thriller laced with a tiny bit of gore. I myself can't stand gory scenes, but the violence wasn't so bad that I had to turn it off. Green Room can be slow paced at times but has enough action throughout the film to hold your attention. Anton Yelchin puts on a superb acting performance as Pat and Imogen Poots, Alia Shawkat, and Patrick Stewart do a excellent job with their characters as well.

Overall Green Room is a nice refresher in a movie industry filled with super hero films and non stop action flicks. This film really has a unique story line and I can see myself watching it again in the future. I wouldn't say I would ever buy this film (unless I find it super cheap) but it's definitely worth a rental! Bonus points for anyone that figured out Pat's (Yelchin) favorite desert island band.",1470355200,,1330,4.26984126984127
7742903,4,B01F2R9WVS,"""Green Room,"" the immensely enjoyable 2015 thriller, is at worst a three-star film with ""cult"" written all over it. I loved it for so many reasons, one of them being it was so well made by writer/director Jeremy Saulnier. There is great craft on display here, not to mention terrific acting. This film is John Carpenter's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Assault-On-Precinct-13-Collector-s-Edition-Blu-ray/dp/B00EALTWJ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Assault On Precinct 13 (Collector's Edition) [Blu-ray</a>] that just happens to take place at a punk rock show.

I was a regular attendee of the punk scene in Austin in the early 1980's, with vivid memories of The Misfits (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MisFits-Collection/dp/B000000I3O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MisFits- Collection</a>) arriving by van in full regalia prior to their show, the crowd parting as they stomped through with great menace. I remember the creepy skinheads hanging on a street corner in Dallas' Deep Ellum, the near riot they started one night, and how most of the leaders of that klan ended up in prison for various reasons.

Here's where I am going with this. All of these memories are from the early to mid-1980's. While I have no doubt surviving shreds of punk rock scenes exist today, and certainly remote compounds of neo-Nazis have possibly taken root in Oregon (loved the locale filmed outside of Portland, Oregon), not sure how such an incongruous band can make a living in this day and age. And as the film details, they're really not. When you open your show with ""Nazi Punks F*** Off,"" a song from 1981 all of 35 years ago (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Plastic-Surgery-Disasters-In-God-We-Trust-Inc/dp/B00005NT4G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Plastic Surgery Disasters / In God We Trust Inc.</a>), you might as well be performing ""Johnny B. Goode.""

Anyway, with all that said, I was not bothered in the least by the accuracy and found it to be rather ingenious and creative. Besides, I was at a Korn/Rob Zombie show just the other day, relaxing on a huge lawn surrounded by an army of tattooed, black-clad, face-pierced minions and said to myself, ""Where do these people come from?!""

Intense, clever, and a complete gut-punch of a journey. The violence is raw and shocking; the atmosphere is one of absolute dread.

This is a backwoods horror thriller of the highest order that doesn't stick to convention. It's not an action film (which I think a lot of people were expecting), but one of pure survival that remains a very human narrative up until its moving (yet bleak) finale. Everyone involved nails it (especially Anton as the band's reluctant leader) and the intensity only escalates the more dire the situation becomes (a certain scene with a box cutter definitely surprised).

7742918,5,B01F2R9WVS,"'Blue Ruin', the second film by writer-director Jeremy Saulnier, was a brutal and emotionally exhausting cinematic excavation of Bronze Age archetypes, starring Saulnier's childhood friend, Macon Blair. It was an absolutely brilliant tale of grief and vengeance, and has already become a minor modern classic. It has a Metacritic score of 77/100, and a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 96%, meaning 96% of the 134 critics surveyed gave it a positive review; with an average critical rating of 8 out of 10, it matches the average audience rating -- a rare and difficult thing. 'Blue Ruin' had left the hooks in, so I was looking forward to 'Green Room' as much as any film from the last year and a half, with the exception of 'Only God Forgives', Nicholas Winding Rifn's follow-up to his modern crime masterpiece, 'Drive'. Like Rifn, Saulnier excels at crafting atmospheric and profoundly unsettling depictions of high-fidelity violence. As intense and emotionally engaging as 'Blue Ruin' was -- thanks in large part to Macon Blair's unforgettable performance as the troubled protagonist, Dwight Evans -- I think 'Green Room' is even better. Blair plays an important supporting role in 'Green Room', which might be the second part of a thematically linked trilogy. If his next film has a title with a color followed by a 4-letter-word beginning with 'R', I won't be surprised: Blue Ruin, Green Room... Crimson Road? Black Rage? BR and GR share a lot of similarities -- Saulnier's cinematic style and his preoccupation with the nastier regions of our psychic geography -- but 'Green Room' is a much more action driven, with an ensemble cast that doesn't allow for the kind of in-depth character development of 'Blue Ruin'. It's a horror film that ignores genre tropes, because in the final analysis, the real world is scarier than anything Hollywood's imagined in the last century. Hell is other people, as they say. We don't need to make up monsters. Amongst the list of best films of 2015 and 2016, with 'Green Room', 'Only God Forgives' and 'The Hateful Eight', is writer S. Craig Zahler's directorial debut, 'Bone Tomahawk'. It's a horror film that's convincingly dressed up as a Western... or an authentic neo-Western that's taking us into the kind of hellish horror-show that Cormac McCarthy introduced in 'Blood Meridian' -- American history, with an evolutionary twist. The realism of Zahler's story makes the brutality of the final act more disturbing than anything I've seen from any horror film, and the same can be said for 'Green Room'.

It's a simple enough plot, but the story manages a nearly excruciating level of tension early on, sustaining it to the last grisly minutes, thanks to the natural dialogue and matter-of-fact treatment of violence. It follows a hardcore band called 'The Ain't Rights', with Anton Yelchin playing Pat, their bassist and vocalist. Yelchin had his own punk rock band when a freak accident took his life, making him the latest member to join 'The 27 Club', made up of famous performers who died at the age of 27 (Amy Winehouse, Kurt Cobain, Jim Morrison, Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix, to name just a few). 'The Ain't Rights' are on the road and broke, scraping up barely enough money from one show for the gas it takes to get them to the next. When they arrive in the town of Seaside, local punk-rock impresario Tad sheepishly informs them that municipal politicians cancelled their show. He arranges a last second change in venue, but the gate is next to nothing. Tad feels guilty, so he arranges a decent paying spot for them at a club outside Portland. Before they leave, he tells them to find his cousin, and gives them a warning that the club is 'boots and braces' territory -- Doc Martens and suspenders -- meaning white-power and Neo-Nazi skinheads. They dismiss the warning and ominous subtext, since skins always turn up at hardcore shows... and also they're punk rockers, who don't give a f@#$ and whatnot.

This particular club, however, is owned and operated by the deadly serious Neo-Nazi militia commander Darcy, played with absolute brilliance by Patrick Stewart. He oscillates between a reassuring, grandfatherly charisma and utterly cold-blooded ruthlessness, a very human, very convincing character... which makes him all the more frightening. Like 'Blue Ruin', Saulnier again makes sure to avoid the clichs; these are violent teenaged and twenty-something Nazi thugs, but they're real people, not cartoonish killing machines or random bad guys.

When they get onstage and realize the entire audience is made up of racist skinheads, they get the bright idea to start their set by covering a 1980's hardcore classic by 'The Dead Kennedy's', ""Nazi Punks F@#$ Off'. They're punk rockers. They STILL don't give a f@#$ and whatnot. Amazingly, they make it through the two minute song without anyone taking a beer bottle to the head, and the set goes fine after that. They collect their cash from the skinhead bouncer Gabe -- Macon Blair's character -- and gather up their equipment, almost out the door, when Pat remembers the cellphone he left charging in the titular 'Green Room', a term referring to a backstage room where performers wait for their turn to go on. Pat walks in, grabs his phone, then turns to apologize for barging in. That's when he processes the f#$%^d up frozen tableau: big, scary skinheads are staring at him, while a female skin (Amber, who becomes their unlikely ally, an excellent performance by Imogen Poots) with the standard 'chelsea' cut and green bomber jacket is weeping, fixated on another girl who's laying on the floor... with a knife protruding from her temple. After that... s@#t gets real.

That's all I can say without spoiling the blood-splattered events that follow, but it's some of the most suspenseful film-making I've seen in ages, and deserves to be a cross-genre classic. It's a crime-drama, a thriller, and a horror movie, but none of that sums it up adequately. Saulnier even throws in subtle moments of meta-humor, totally dead-pan and obviously deliberate; i.e., the band members are trying to escape the club, and there's no sign of the skinheads, but they know they're trapped, and one of them suggests, for no apparent reason: 'Let's split up.' They give him a look of wonder and move on. This isn't going to be up for an Oscar, but it should be. It's a simple film, but like 'Bone Tomahawk' and 'Only God Forgives', it had me reflecting back on it for days. Reading some of the other reviews here, not everyone felt the same. One criticism I heard elsewhere took exception to the bad decisions the characters made; I find that funny, considering we're talking about a punk-rock band and Nazi skinheads. Of course they're making bad decisions. And in crazy, adrenalized situations, fight-or-flight instincts make logical choices incredibly difficult. So I'll have to take the exact opposite POV, and say that the actions and reactions, sometimes completely baffling, represent the reality of something this intense beautifully. But critical disagreements happen, and I'm used to loving films that other people hate... 'Under the Skin' and 'Enemy' being prime examples. But while 'Under the Skin' and 'Enemy' both had huge discrepancies between the very high average rating from critics and the very low average rating from audiences, 'Green Room' had scores very similar to 'Blue Ruin': Rotten Tomatoes said 91% of the 179 reviews surveyed gave it a positive review, with a 7.7 out of 10 average amongst critics, and an audience rating of 79%; Metacritic reported an average critical rating of 79%. All of those numbers are within 2% of the numbers 'Blue Ruin' received, and as close to a consensus agreement on the outstanding quality of a film as you're likely to see. That said, it's not for everyone. If you can't stand fictional violence... why are you still reading?",1469923200,2,7877,4.9832826747720365

7742923,4,B01F2R9WVS,"Possible spoilers.  In 2013, director, writer, cinematographer and jack of all trades, Jeremy Saulnier released a movie called Blue Ruin.  It was about homeless man searching for the killer of his parents.  It was eye-opening for what it wasnt.  From that perspective, this film has the same qualities of surprise.

A punk-rock-headbanger band called The Aint Rights has just gotten stiffed at their latest gig and doesnt even have enough gas money to get back home.  For the record, they always seem to have enough money to buy beer and cigarettes however.  The owner of the last bar (David W. Thompson) says he has a cousin up in rural Oregon and he needs a band for one night.  It pays $350 so after syphoning some gas for the van, off they go.

I suspect this film will get some additional interest as the late Anton Yelchin (Star Trek reboots) stars as Pat, the guitarist.  Reece (Joe Cole), Sam (Alia Shawkat) and Tiger (Callum Turner) complete the band.  They know up front that the bar is in rural white supremacy territory.  They arrive and are greeted by the manager, Gabe (Malcon Blair who was the lead in the aforementioned Blue Ruin).  He actually seems on the normal side given the bar is filled with neo-Nazis, KKK types and skin-heads of various persuasions.

The band is shown to the Green Room which is kind of a staging area or dressing room for guests to wait for their turn on stage.  They play their set, get paid and are about to leave when Pat forgets his phone and goes back to the Green Room to retrieve it.  Opening the door he finds something he wasn't supposed toand the fun begins.  At first I thought this was going to be one of those torture-porn films, but thankfully it isnt.  That doesnt mean there isn't plenty of violence, slashing, hacking, shooting, brutal dog attacks and head bashing.  There is, but it isn't meant to be punishment.  Its just good old cover-up tactics conceived by the head of this particular clan, known as Darcy (Patrick Stewart, Star Trek: Nemisis).  You see, the head skin-head is involved in narco-traffiking and other questionable deeds.  And of course, he wants to keep a low profile for now, so that Obama doesnt come after his guns.

So what Saulnier has given us is a taut thriller where the band and one of the female customers played by Emogen Poots are holed up in their small staging room knowing that Darcys goons will soon be knocking at their door.  While this would seem like an easy extraction for Darcy, he has legitimate reasons not to kill them right away, especially with guns.  This makes the bands stand (pun intended) more realistic.  As it is, this is a surprisingly good film with plenty of thrills and chills.  And alas, one of young Anton Yelchins final performances.  Highly recommended.

The Blu ray transfer comes in 1080p video resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  Like nearly all modern Blu ray discs, this one looks very good.  Yes, much of the look is a dreary grey or even sepia in coloring but I think that is more a choice of the director for the film itself.  The film doesnt have the sharpness and detail usually seen in Blu ray.  I don't want to make a big deal of this just don't be surprised if the movie looks a little soft.  Overall the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track is excellent.  There is plenty of loud music provided by the band (who actually learned the songs they performed) and it is well-dispersed throughout the room.  In some cases the music overwhelms the dialog, which seems especially noticeable when you cant see the actors faces.  Subtitles come in Spanish and English SDH.  Extras include a commentary track with Saulnier and a 10 minute featurette called Into the Pit: Making Green Room.",1469836800,,3711,4.626339969372129

7742934,4,B01F2R9WVS,"Anton Yelchin, in one of his final roles, stars as a member of a punk rock band who has to fight for their lives against a group of Neo-Nazi skinheads in the horror/thriller Green Room. Yelchin plays Pat who along with Sam, Reece, and Tiger, form the punk rock band the Aint Rights. The fledgling band takes a gig in Oregon at a club frequented by skinheads. After finishing their set, they're preparing to load their equipment to leave. Sam leaves her cellphone in the clubs green room where acts wait their turn to take the stage. When Pat goes to retrieve the phone he walks in on a murder scene as club regular is found dead with a knife in her head.green blu

The clubs bouncers quickly force the band back into the room along with Amber, a friend of the murdered girl. One of the bouncers remains inside to keep an eye on the group while the manager claims that he is contacting the police to straighten everything out. In reality he calls for the clubs owner Darcy (Patrick Stewart) the leader of a local Neo-Nazi group. The band manages to overpower the bouncer and get his gun. Darcy tries to negotiate with them to get the gun back but the bad soon realizes that Darcy and his men have no intention of letting the group out alive.

The group desperately searches for a way to escape the room but even if they do they face a group of a dozen or so armed skinheads and trained attack pit-bulls. Darcy, however, is trying to keep their deaths controlled so he can provide a plausible excuse for the police.

Green Rooms strength is in its simplicity of plot and its disparity of factions. It is a simple us vs. them in the most savage way and for the highest stakes imaginable. And make no mistake about it; this film is savage in its sheer brutality and violent kills. Characters are hacked to death, mauled by pit-bulls, disemboweled by box cutters, and have their faces blown off with shotguns. It is not a film for the squeamish. Director/Writer Jeremy Saulnier threatens to upend things by adding needless plot twists but quickly manages to get things back on track.

A brutal horror film isn't a genre you would normally associate with either Yelchin or Patrick Stewart, ironically both alums of the Star Trek franchise. Yet both bring their unique talents to their characters. Yelchin brings his calm, quiet, understated disposition to Pat, the defacto leader of the band once the crap its the fan. And Stewart is commanding yet calculating as the skinhead boss whose motto is Its not a party its a movement. Hes devoted to his cause so much that he goes to astounding efforts to make sure the bands deaths are staged so as not to have any blowback on him or the group. Also a joy to watch was Imogen Poots as the punk fan who overcomes the shock and terror of her friends murder to help the band fight off her former associates.

The film also features a frenetic and thunderous punk rock soundtrack that enhances the films amped up pace and action. Bloody and brash, Green Room is 95 minutes of angst and blood!

7742943,5,B01F2R9WVS,"'Blue Ruin', the second film by writer-director Jeremy Saulnier, was a brutal and emotionally exhausting cinematic excavation of Bronze Age archetypes, starring Saulnier's childhood friend, Macon Blair. It was an absolutely brilliant tale of grief and vengeance, and has already become a minor modern classic. It has a Metacritic score of 77/100, and a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 96%, meaning 96% of the 134 critics surveyed gave it a positive review; with an average critical rating of 8 out of 10, it matches the average audience rating -- a rare and difficult thing. 'Blue Ruin' had left the hooks in, so I was looking forward to 'Green Room' as much as any film from the last year and a half, with the exception of 'Only God Forgives', Nicholas Winding Rifn's follow-up to his modern crime masterpiece, 'Drive'. Like Rifn, Saulnier excels at crafting atmospheric and profoundly unsettling depictions of high-fidelity violence. As intense and emotionally engaging as 'Blue Ruin' was -- thanks in large part to Macon Blair's unforgettable performance as the troubled protagonist, Dwight Evans -- I think 'Green Room' is even better. Blair plays an important supporting role in 'Green Room', which might be the second part of a thematically linked trilogy. If his next film has a title with a color followed by a 4-letter-word beginning with 'R', I won't be surprised: Blue Ruin, Green Room... Crimson Road? Black Rage? BR and GR share a lot of similarities -- Saulnier's cinematic style and his preoccupation with the nastier regions of our psychic geography -- but 'Green Room' is a much more action driven, with an ensemble cast that doesn't allow for the kind of in-depth character development of 'Blue Ruin'. It's a horror film that ignores genre tropes, because in the final analysis, the real world is scarier than anything Hollywood's imagined in the last century. Hell is other people, as they say. We don't need to make up monsters. Amongst the list of best films of 2015 and 2016, with 'Green Room', 'Only God Forgives' and 'The Hateful Eight', is writer S. Craig Zahler's directorial debut, 'Bone Tomahawk'. It's a horror film that's convincingly dressed up as a Western... or an authentic neo-Western that's taking us into the kind of hellish horror-show that Cormac McCarthy introduced in 'Blood Meridian' -- American history, with an evolutionary twist. The realism of Zahler's story makes the brutality of the final act more disturbing than anything I've seen from any horror film, and the same can be said for 'Green Room'.

It's a simple enough plot, but the story manages a nearly excruciating level of tension early on, sustaining it to the last grisly minutes, thanks to the natural dialogue and matter-of-fact treatment of violence. It follows a hardcore band called 'The Ain't Rights', with Anton Yelchin playing Pat, their bassist and vocalist. Yelchin had his own punk rock band when a freak accident took his life, making him the latest member to join 'The 27 Club', made up of famous performers who died at the age of 27 (Amy Winehouse, Kurt Cobain, Jim Morrison, Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix, to name just a few). 'The Ain't Rights' are on the road and broke, scraping up barely enough money from one show for the gas it takes to get them to the next. When they arrive in the town of Seaside, local punk-rock impresario Tad sheepishly informs them that municipal politicians cancelled their show. He arranges a last second change in venue, but the gate is next to nothing. Tad feels guilty, so he arranges a decent paying spot for them at a club outside Portland. Before they leave, he tells them to find his cousin, and gives them a warning that the club is 'boots and braces' territory -- Doc Martens and suspenders -- meaning white-power and Neo-Nazi skinheads. They dismiss the warning and ominous subtext, since skins always turn up at hardcore shows... and also they're punk rockers, who don't give a f@#k and whatnot.

This particular club, however, is owned and operated by the deadly serious Neo-Nazi militia commander Darcy, played with absolute brilliance by Patrick Stewart. He oscillates between a reassuring, grandfatherly charisma and utterly cold-blooded ruthlessness, a very human, very convincing character... which makes him all the more frightening. Like 'Blue Ruin', Saulnier again makes sure to avoid the clichs; these are violent teenaged and twenty-something Nazi thugs, but they're real people, not cartoonish killing machines or random bad guys.

When they get onstage and realize the entire audience is made up of racist skinheads, they get the bright idea to start their set by covering a 1980's hardcore classic by 'The Dead Kennedy's', ""Nazi Punks F@#k Off'. They're punk rockers. They don't give a f@#k and whatnot. Amazingly, they make it through the two minute song without anyone taking a beer bottle to the head, and the set goes fine after that. They collect their cash from the skinhead bouncer Gabe -- Macon Blair's character -- and gather up their equipment, almost out the door, when Pat remembers the cellphone he left charging in the titular 'Green Room', a term referring to a backstage room where performers wait for their turn to go on. Pat walks in, grabs his phone, then turns to apologize for barging in. That's when he processes the f#$%^d up frozen tableau: big, scary skinheads are staring at him, while a female skin (Amber, who becomes their unlikely ally, an excellent performance by Imogen Poots) with the standard 'chelsea' cut and green bomber jacket is weeping, fixated on another girl who's laying on the floor... with a knife protruding from her temple. After that... s@#t gets real.

That's all I can say without spoiling the blood-splattered events that follow, but it's some of the most suspenseful film-making I've seen in ages, and deserves to be a cross-genre classic. It's a crime-drama, a thriller, and a horror movie, but none of that sums it up adequately. Saulnier even throws in subtle moments of meta-humor, totally dead-pan and obviously deliberate; i.e., the band members are trying to escape the club, and there's no sign of the skinheads, but they know they're trapped, and one of them suggests, for no apparent reason: 'Let's split up.' They give him a look of wonder and move on. This isn't going to be up for an Oscar, but it should be. It's a simple film, but like 'Bone Tomahawk' and 'Only God Forgives', it had me reflecting back on it for days. Reading some of the other reviews here, not everyone felt the same. One criticism I heard elsewhere took exception to the bad decisions the characters made; I find that funny, considering we're talking about a punk-rock band and Nazi skinheads. Of course they're making bad decisions. And in crazy, adrenalized situations, fight-or-flight instincts make logical choices incredibly difficult. So I'll have to take the exact opposite POV, and say that the actions and reactions, sometimes completely baffling, represent the reality of something this intense beautifully. But critical disagreements happen, and I'm used to loving films that other people hate... 'Under the Skin' and 'Enemy' being prime examples. But while 'Under the Skin' and 'Enemy' both had huge discrepancies between the very high average rating from critics and the very low average rating from audiences, 'Green Room' had scores very similar to 'Blue Ruin': Rotten Tomatoes said 91% of the 179 reviews surveyed gave it a positive review, with a 7.7 out of 10 average amongst critics, and an audience rating of 79%; Metacritic reported an average critical rating of 79%. All of those numbers are within 2% of the numbers 'Blue Ruin' received, and as close to a consensus agreement on the outstanding quality of a film as you're likely to see. That said, it's not for everyone. If you can't stand fictional violence... why are you still reading?",1469404800,2,7871,4.983269961977187
7742944,3,B01F2R9WVS,"A decent thriller with some very good performances and memorable imagery. The world they build around the antagonists, a group of evil white supremacists, is very well-crafted and lets you pick up on a lot of the subtleties without spelling them out for you like a lesser movie would do. Patrick Stewart plays against type as the big bad and is truly menacing at times. Anton Yelchin is fantastic in what will end up being one of his final roles. Imogen Poots is also surprisingly great as the heroine of the film. As the horror/thriller plays out though, it becomes a fairly basic genre movie with a select few characters making smart decisions and most characters being dumb and dying needlessly. The aura built around the white supremacists at the beginning of the film is that they do this type of thing often and have all kinds of rules for how it's to be done right, yet they're completely incompetent at carrying out their mission.",1469404800,,938,4.6909090909090905

7742968,4,B01F2R9WVS,"Green Room, directed by Jeremy Saulnier, is an indie thriller released in 2016 and starring Anton Yelchin in one of his final films before his tragic and untimely death as well as the great Patrick Stewart in a very unsettling film.

The film follows a young rock band (including Anton Yelchin) who take a gig at a bar out in the middle of the Pacific Northwest. The bar turns out to be a pretty rough place, frequented and run by a gang of skinhead, Neo-Nazis led by Patrick Stewart. After the performance one of them returns to the Green Room to get a forgotten cell phone only to stumble onto the body of a girl the gang has killed. The band then barricade themselves in the Green Room taking a hostage and refuse to come out until the police arrive as they fear for their own lives. Things progress from bad to worse as Patrick Stewart arrives and treacherously tries to trick them into leaving the safety of the Green Room with his false promises. The film is very nerve wracking and legitimately terrifying at times and features some rather graphic sequences. A great performance from Patrick Stewart makes it worth seeing.

A well-made, small thriller that is sure to keep you on your seat as you hold your breath waiting to see if the young band mates can find a way out of this terrifying nightmare.",1469232000,,1308,4.514767932489452

The movie tells the story of a punk rock group, which if the music really does sound like what was in the movie then I have no business listening to it, who are trying to find a big gig and end up finding one at a roadhouse full of white supremacists.  Who these characters' names are, I can't tell you, because they were not interesting in the slightest.  Even bad horror movies are at least fun to watch.  In fact, the only interesting one thorughout the whole movie is Patrick Stewart, who plays as the ""most supreme"" of the supremacists, and that's it.  I could tell you about how the rest of the story is, but not much happens, except for some people getting killed through very gory means (what else do you expect?  Flying bunnies?), and I can hardly remember anything about it.  The storytelling is just lackluster at best, and again, it's boring.  Even most of the actors seem like they're only ACTING to do their jobs as ACTORS, despite the fact that they just sound as tired as all heck, not to mention that I have no reason to care about these characters at all.  The best actor in the whole movie was the DOG, the dang pitbull who kills two people throughout the whole movie, and for the rest of the movie he's in, just walks down a road.

Now, about the gore, and maybe it's because I play games like Mortal Kombat, Grand Theft Auto, etc., but other then a hand nearly being cut off and a dog eating peoples throats, I've seen worse in a whole lot less graphic movies.  Yeah, it looks real, but if all I wanted to see a bunch of bullet holes, I'd play Grand Theft Auto.  If you have problems sleeping a night (and if a small amount of blood and gore doesn't bother you), then by all means, get this movie.  If you want a good movie, then nothing to see here.",1468540800,3,1975,4.24331550802139

7743023,4,B01F2R9WVS,"Marketed as a horror movie, ""Green Room"" plays more as a violent suspense thriller in my opinion. Featuring a number of stellar performances including an unexpected villainous turn in this tense film from director/writer Jeremy Saulnier. Shot on a small budget in Oregon, the film, unlike a lot of low budget movies, has atmosphere to spare as well as strong professional performances from the entire cast.

SPOILERS:

The late Anton Yelchin, Alia Shawkat, Callum Turner and Joe Cole star as a punk band at the end of an exhausting, money losing tour. They are booked as last minute replacements at a club owned by Darcy (Patrick Stewart) where a murder occurs. The band who called themselves The Ain't Rights see the body and are trapped backstage with no way out as Darcy plans on killing them to protect a secret.

END OF SPOILERS:

The Blu-ray transfer looks terrific with a detailed, sharp presentation featuring plenty of detail. The audio is also stellar but with dialog front, clear and center throughout. Subtitles are provided in English.

The special features are limited but quite informative--the director provides an interesting commentary track and we get a featurette on the production of the film.

It's always exciting to see a major talent break through and ""Green Room"" provides that moment. Let's hope we see more from this director (he's done two previous strong films with ""Blue Ruin"" equally as good) as his development has been exciting to watch.

7743025,4,B01F2R9WVS,"""Green Room"" (2015 release; 94 min.) brings the (mis)adventures of four musicians in a punk band called the Ain't Rights As the movie opens, we see the four of them waking up in their van, after the van slid off the road the night before. It's not long before they meet up with a local radio show host, who is able to book them onto a nearby concert the next day. When the band gets there, they realize that this is a show for Nazi skinheads. When they open their set with a cover of a Dead Kennedys' anti-Nazi tune, the audience gets very restless. Things only get worse from there... At this point we're about 10 minutes into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from writer-director Jeremy Saulnier, who most recently brought us the excellent ""Blue Ruin"". Here, he brings a very different story, namely what happens to a punk band when they accidentally end up performing for Nazi skinheads, and things turn sour (in a very unexpected way--sorry, I cannot reveal more). As soon as the band starts their gig, the movie's tension rackets up and simply never lets go from there until the very end. The cast is an ensemble of no-names, at least for me, with of course the exception of Patrick Stewart. Stewart plays the role of the leader of the Nazi skinheads, and he brings it with ice-cold detachment and ruthlessness. Beware: there are a couple of pretty gruesome scenes, so if that is not your thing, by all means stay away from it. if on the other hand you like a true original horror-thriller story, you are in for quite a treat. Last but not least, there is an excellent soundtrack, both from the original score (composed by Brooke Blair and Will Blair), and also the various songs interwoven into the music. When CCR's ""Sinister Purpose"" starts playing over the movie's end credits, it brings a sense of relief, as in: you made it alive through the end! Which is more than can be said for a number of the characters in the movie...

""Green Room"" premiered at Cannes 2015, to critical acclaim. No idea why it's taken this long to get a US release but better late than never I suppose. ""Green Room"" opened on 3 or 4 screens in Greater Cincinnati in early May. The early evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great, somewhat to my surprise. In you are in the mood for a top-notch horror-thriller that simply never lets up, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Green Room"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1468281600,,2557,4.508620689655173

As one of the members returns to the dressing room...or green room for a forgotten cell phone, he espies a stabbed young lady on the floor. Rather than play it cool.... and the next thing you know the band is locked inside with one of the guys talking about his paint ball experiences.

Once the real action started, the film got boring as a been there done that type of thing. In spite of being skinheads, they were clearly Hollywood skinheads, a bit too civilized to create chills. Rental at best.

The story is simple and it's essential a survival flick with a punk band squared off against a bunch of skin heads.  The dialogue and action are fantastic, and the female lead is amazing!  I prefer to leave the spoilers to other reviewers, but I will say that there was one scene where a character describes to his friend, how he once got his clock cleaned when playing paint ball against a bunch of ex marines from Iraq.  As he put it, 'They were outmatched.  The marines were using battlefield tactics and he was cowering behind a tree until he got splattered.  Once his team realized the situation was hopeless, one of them went balls to the wall crazy and just blasted his way to victory.  By being unpredictable, the more experienced marines couldn't use their tactics anymore and defend themselves.  That story encapsulates this movie.

Our opinion: Not so much.

We are diehard horror movie buffs and have been since the 80s. While there were certainly elements about this movie that caused it to rise above most of the recent new releases, the plot wasn't completely on track and the pacing seemed off. Of course having Patrick Stewart elevated this movie; however, he acted too slow and his character didn't seem to act in a manner that would be entirely consistent with someone running this type of business or making the types of decisions he did.",1467676800,,618,4.609090909090909

7743037,3,B01F2R9WVS,"Blair was pretty fantastic; for some reason I pull him out in front of the others, as the calm, almost dignified manager of the neo-nazi hangout. However, despite his role, despite gripping sound editing, despite the pace being fairly strong and a good score at key moments, once Stewart arrives, it seems contrite, flabbergastingly miscast, scattergorized attempt at Michael Clayton done with a seemingly irritating, incongruous approach that from a viewers perspective gives the obvious impression that he (Stewart) and his red laces have done this several times before. Yet its meandered around, without any clear take on the exact purpose these people play, yet are ordered to go do such vague tasks and its a mess; all the while merely pawns and puppets to the demonic nature of Stewart and his god complex of a character. Mission and movement over the now and party atmosphere ---- but done so with Panic Room bravado and overt revenge, rebelling and loyalty run amok. Anton always looked and acted constipated, and yet despite an ouch or awww as the film progresses, its amazing with no sedation and/or pain killers, how fast his hand that is nearly severed is treated like a puncture wound. The acting was, at times, well done, but during the last 30 minutes was like The Walking Dead with a more cerebral mentality, as if the actors, were all going through their personal fix of Patrick's own devils powder.

7743040,3,B01F2R9WVS,"This film had been on my radar for quite some time as I was a fan of director Jeremy Saulnier's previous movie, ""Blue Ruin,"" also starring Macon Blair who plays a skinhead in this movie  The premise of Green Room is simple.  You have a struggling punk band called the Ain't Rights who are barely making ends meet.  They travel from small town to small town playing near-empty gigs in hole in the wall venues for anyone that will allow them into the building in return for either free food or beer and occasionally enough money for gas.  As a favor, they are booked to perform at a skinhead bar in Portland for a nice chunk of money.  After the show, guitarist Pat, played by the late Anton Yelchin inadvertently walks into a crime in progress in the venue's green room.  This is when the proverbial doo doo hits the fan as the rest of the band barricade themselves inside the room as the skinheads and club owner, Darcy, played by delightfully menacing Patrick Stewart try to ""negotiate"" they're way in.

This is when the film lost it's way with me a little bit.  Everything up to this point had been spectacular visceral film making.  The problem I had were the completely moronic decisions some of the characters made that sometimes had me slapping my head and yelling, ""Why would you do that?!?"" at my television screen.  I later read that Saulnier intended this film to be a part of his ""inept protagonist trilogy"" in which characters were put in situations that were way over their heads and acted accordingly.  However, this does not always equate to good writing especially when at one point one of the characters stuck in the room suggests that they should all split up.  Have these characters not seen horror movies before?

Regardless, there is still a lot to praise to be said for Green Room.  The performances are very good, especially with the inspired casting of Patrick Stewart who brings a certain gravitas in his scenes.  The tension in this movie is thick and despite it's faults, I was mostly on the edge of my seat the entire time.  The gore in this movie is nausea-inducing and probably the most realistic that I've ever seen in a film, but I never felt it was unnecessary.  The movie paints a brutal world and characters die accordingly.  Overall, it's still a good recommend, if not to see a rising director's next body of work and two actors from the Star Trek franchise in one movie.",1467158400,,2408,4.573426573426573

7743043,5,B01F2R9WVS,"When Anton Yelchin died a week or so ago, I was very disappointed that the half dozen online obits I perused failed to mention this excellent,  bloody genre showcase - a movie which has gotten almost universal praise and a movie where he is the Star (despite Patrick Stewart's showy Top-Billing). Of course he was good in Alpha Dog and he stood out for his small role in Only Lovers Left Alive, but it's incredibly disheartening that so far the Star Trek reboots have offered his Chekov very little to do. So despite numerous taglines that declared, ""Star Trek Actor Dead,""  for my money it should have said, ""Green Room"" actor dead.

Mark my words, this will be the film Yelchin is remembered for.

If you are a crime movie fan, horror fan or action fan, there is no reason you shouldn't enjoy this visceral, punchy survival flick. The young class does great work and the famously good-natured Patrick Stewart, cast against type, gives good, scowling menace as the rural, backwoods gangster.

The simple plot is of a punk band trapped at a seedy, rural dive bar/club owned and run by white supremacists after they accidentally witness the results of a murder in a room backstage. Trapped by the denizens of the club, the band tries to bargain, then force their way out. Structurally the movie is set up like a taut thriller for the first half, with lots of verbal back and forth between the protagonists and the villains, but then the movie amps up and becomes increasingly more action oriented (excellently staged gun play and fight sequences) as well as very gory (hard-R levels of blood letting). This movie has one of the highest body counts you will see this year.  If you look into the script, there is more political commentary and subtext under all the action than one might realize.

A big touchstone for this movie is Assault on Precinct 13, but I also saw influences of Cohen brother's movies like Blood Simple and No Country For Old Men with their amoral plots.

If you haven't seen this directors other film, Blue Ruin - check it out. The two films are of a piece stylistically, with Blue Ruin being much more emotionally complex and nuanced.

I think Yelchin was cast as the lead for this movie because he's got that scrappy, ""someone give this poor kid a sandwich"" slightness to his physique that we think of for snotty, bean-pole guys in countless punk and emo bands. But it is his effeminate and kind appearance and complete lack of ruggedness that we usually associate with movie heros, that subverts the formula of the standard action film which always features the buff star, handsome boyfriend or jock-guy survivor.  His fragility makes the stakes higher. He IS the underdog and his acting skills allow him to convey a wide range of emotions - panic, terror, fright and anguish that run on and off his face thru the whole picture.  Imogen Poots does equally well as a despondent drug addict.

It's really a shame Yelchin is gone. He would have brought us tons of great characters for years to come.",1467072000,4,3020,4.6773584905660375

Although Patrick Stewart character is a little too withdrawn throughout, Anton Yelchin really shines in this - one of his final films. It is a movie that uses real world logic, in that when the characters elect to do something you typically think ""That is what I would do too.""

7743048,5,B01F2R9WVS,"Really cool and bizarre premise for a movie but it works.  To me, I felt nervous throughout a good portion of the film and I love that.  Quick plot for the film is that a band gets F'd over for a job but gets a gig at a Skinhead bar at the last minute to make some quick cash.  They hate Nazis and decide to do the smart thing and piss them off by playing an anti-Nazi song.  After the concert, Anton's character sees something and the skinheads won't let the band leave until Patrick Stewart gets to the bar.  Give it a try if you like very tense films.

The car was still running and was in neutral when he was discovered by friends and police.  I guess he got out to close his gate and the car backed into him up against the wall and the gate.  The Jeep had been recalled a month earlier because the e-shift created a dangerous situation where drivers put the vehicle in neutral, thinking it was in park.  They said he had a steep driveway.  He was 27.  He will be missed.  I really loved his films: Star Treks, Odd Thomas, Fright Night remake, Alpha Dog, Charlie Bartlett, Burying the Ex and now Green Room.

7743050,5,B01F2R9WVS,"A punk band called the Ain't Rights comprised of Tiger, Pat, Sam, and Reece travel a long way for a radio interview and a show that doesn't earn them much money. As an apology, the radio host gives them the location for another show, but the area is very conservative. They arrive to a crowd of Neo-Nazis and their set actually goes over pretty well. The bar owners try to hustle them out, but Sam forgets her phone in the green room and witnesses the aftermath of a murder. The band isn't being allowed to leave and have their phones taken away at gunpoint. It becomes clear after the police have gone that they will never be allowed to leave and have to fight for their lives.

The Ain't Rights are a pretentious punk band on the verge of quitting. The director captures the world of punk well with this band as they siphon gas, couch surf, and drink their way to each gig. They refuse to have their music recorded digitally or videotaped for online use. They also refuse to have any online presence at all. I appreciate their old school sensibilities, but they also seem to want to actually make money and become relatively famous. With their ideals, it's just not going to happen. At heart, they're all kind of posers that want the best of both worlds. This is also shown in their choice of desert island band in their radio interview. Many of them chose hardcore punk bands, but later reveal their true, much softer choice of band when all of their facades are stripped away as the film goes on. The only band member exempt from all this is Tiger who was honest about who he was and what he liked the entire film. Reece is an angry guy who tried hard to project how tough he was. Pat seems confused about just about everything and Sam just seems along for the ride. Their facades and their eventual breakdown humanize these characters and allow us to root for them.

When the band arrives at the skinhead bar, it's uncomfortable but in a safe way. The band plays for the skinhead crowd, starting the set with Dead Kennedys' Nazi Punks song (title censored due to Amazon), driving the crowd to shout and throw beer bottles, and then winning over the crowd with their original songs. Everything seems fine until the band witnesses the horrific scene that puts the siege situation in motion. The tension is so masterfully kept up throughout the film that I felt physically uncomfortable and tense myself. This band has to decide what they would do to survive in the face of these experienced Neo-Nazi killers. The band puts up an impressive fight in the face of great odds, but when things go south, the violence is immediate and brutal. There's no time to mourn or even react and it made me jump every time. The unexpectedly gory practical effects are impressive. I could hear the crowd squirming and vocalizing their disgust during the film.

The Neo-Nazis have many resources and men on their side. Men are willing to lay down their lives and kill for Darcy Banker, the head of their gang masterfully portrayed by Patrick Stewart. Although he's reserved in the role, he maintains authority and a sinister air in any situation. They employ pit bulls as effective weapons, but Saulnier takes pains to show that the dogs on their own are not violent. I found it refreshing to show that the dog just wants to please its master rather than being an inherently savage animal. Some defectors that try to help the band with varying degrees of success. Amber, the shattered friend of the girl who was murdered, has little hope of success, but tries her damnedest to beat them. She's the most realistic of the group because she's seen them in action before and knows what they are capable of. Others defecting shows how Darcy's empire and followers aren't perfect.

Green Room is one of my favorite horror films of the year. The tension is masterfully built up and held for the majority of the film. It's what horror is to me: building the atmosphere, creating realistic characters, and making the audience squirm. I had never heard of Jeremy Saulnier before, but I need to watch Blue Ruin and see whatever else he creates in the future. The acting is top notch all around and I can't find a flaw in any aspect of this film.",1465603200,7,4219,4.569352708058124
7743051,4,B01F2R9WVS,"A couple of years ago Jeremy Saulnier and his buddy Macon Blair set the genre world on fire with ""Blue Ruin"", a tough little revenge thriller that showed a ton of promise. While the brutality and realism of it stood out, what made that film so great was its humanity. The lead character was a regular guy, someone we could relate to as he fumbled his way through one heinous act after another. With the equally vicious ""Green Room"" Saulnier sets his sights on the invasion flick, an ""Assault on Precinct 13""-style barnburner that retains the personal character moments that are quickly becoming the filmmaker's trademark.

The premise is simple: failing punk rock band The Ain't Rights, featuring Tiger (Callum Turner), guitarist Sam (Alia Shawkat), bassist Pat (Anton Yelchin), and drummer Reece (Joe Cole), get stiffed on a gig but are clued in to another one down in Portland. Once arriving they quickly come to realize that much of the rowdy, bald-headed clientele are neo-Nazi skinheads. The club's manager, David (Blair), seems like an alright guy but some others seem ready for a fight. With tensions already high and the band ready to just collect their cash and jet, they accidentally stumble on a girl's murder in the green room. Obviously, they can't be allowed to just leave, and they're hold up in the room with the victim's best friend, Amber (Imogen Poots), their hostage Big Justin (Eric Edelstein), and a loaded gun with only a handful of bullets.

Like ""Blue Ruin"", Saulnier's script slowly dials up the tension to an almost unbearable level. When Patrick Stewart arrives as the skinheads' leader, Darcy, his soothing we normally associate with authority only makes the situation more intense. It isn't long before the blood starts to flow and people start dying, and the violence has real impact. The band members aren't trained killers or action heroes, they're normal people in a terrifying situation. While there isn't a ton of time for deep characterization, Saulnier's tight, muscular script affords just enough opportunities. A mostly unspoken debate lingers throughout about the band's true punk rock credentials, with each member offering their favorite ""deserted island"" bands. Yelchin stands out as the de facto leader as Pat, but he's hardly what one would call a brave warrior. Poots has always been good at playing tough women and she's great here, as well, although Amber's motivations remain somewhat unclear.

Bullets, teeth, blades, blood gets spilled in ways that are incredibly tough to watch, and DP Sean Porter captures it in grisly fashion. Visually and thematically Saulnier is treading on familiar ground, but he's one of the best at it right now. He keeps finding new, fresh ways to explore violence, and ""Green Room"" is easily one of the best genre films in a long time.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Green-Room-Blu-ray-Digital-HD/dp/B01F2R9WV8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Green Room [Blu-ray + Digital HD</a>]",1463788800,27,2999,5.296218487394958
7743052,4,B01F2R9WVS,"When a down-on-their-luck band called The Aint Rights are struggling on a tour for a good gig. One finally comes to them at a run-down bar inhabited by Skinheads. Uneasy about the setting, the group give it their all and call it a day. Just when they think they are done, they stumble across a murder and soon find themselves mixed up in the deadly gang and must fight to survive the night.

Green Room is the latest indie horror film from A24 who brought the surprise hit The Witch earlier this year. This film isn't as subtle as the horror The Witch depicted, this one is totally and completely in your face. At the start, the film may seem like its gonna be slow moving as it introduces the characters and setting everything up. However, once things get set in motion, it is complete intensity throughout the rest of the film. I would go as far to say it moved at an intense speed. Not in a way where it rushed itself but in a way where things just keep on happening and happening so there is never a dull moment. I wouldnt call this film scary, but it is definitely intense in the sense that you have no idea what is going to happen or just who and when someone will die, and when they do, the deaths are pretty damn brutal. One scene in particular involves the characters running off in different directions and you find yourself on edge and not knowing how each characters fate will end. I will say that at the end of the film I was slightly let down in the sense that I wanted it to have more of a climactic ending. Instead it was kinda dull and lifeless compared to everything else that had just happened.

The story is fairly basic but it takes its material and amps it up to keep you engaged, though there were several times where I found myself constantly questioning actions and motives, more so on the end of the villains. That is definitely something that could have been handled better. But the one thing that really infuriated me the most happens near the end when a character essentially makes a decision that makes you literally hate them because of the fate it causes for another character. As far as the characters, most of them are likable and you get genuinely worried whether theyll die or not. The band as a whole are likable in that they have great chemistry together. Though Im not sure if their music is something that was supposed to come off bad or not. The one character however that did not leave much of an impression on me was the character Amber, her character had no real personality or redeemable traits, she was essentially just there to be the love interest for the character Pat. A very unnecessary character. Had it just been the band as the focus, it would have made it a lot better.

The acting was solid all around. Each actor really brings a sense of personality and charisma to their characters. Alia Shawkat plays the lone female in the band with sass and wit, but also shows she does have a soft side. Joe Cole and Callum Turner play their characters as tough, caring, and often humorous. Anton Yelchin, is the semi-weak one of the group. His performance isn't bad, but its very one-note and no different than any other role hes ever done. Imogen Poots turns in yet another unbearable performance as Amber. The character herself was downright boring as I mentioned, but Poots could have at least tried to spice her up, instead she just brings in a dull and lifeless performance, she genuinely seems bored throughout the whole thing. Finally there is Patrick Stewart as the head honcho Skinhead, Darcy. If there was one thing I was looking forward to about this, it was to see Professor X himself play a twisted villain. Sadly, I was disappointed. Not with Patricks performance, but with little they did with him. They could have made him much more villainous than they did.

Green Room is an intense ride overall with pretty solid performances, but despite a couple of questionable moments with the writing and the characters, and just an under-use of the actors, its a film I definitely recommend.",1462665600,8,4045,4.521857923497268

8760000,4,B01F2R9WVS,"Overview: A simple premise of a literal grunge band trapped in a backstage greenroom is explored to its fullest potential.

Plot: 4/5
Spoiler Free! While the premise of a bunch of near-vagabond twenty-somethings trapped somewhere has been done quite literally to death, never before has it been done so disturbingly. This is partly thanks to the fantastic acting from everyone involved and partly to the 'realistic' feel of the movie. The director proves that simple doesn't always equal bad.

Visuals: 5/5
Simply put, the visuals are what steal the show. While GR does fall into the 'gritty' trope that many horror movies explored in the mid 2000's (Saw, Hostel), it does so expertly. Wounds look hyper-realistic, duct-tape is used as the world's biggest band-aid and a lit cigarette becomes a motion detector. Everything about the visuals of the film sell the grime and filth. It's as if the director knows the only thing worse than a gaping machete wound is when you get one in what looks like a gas-station bathroom.

Sound: 3/5
While not particularly remarkable, the sound is conspicuous by its absence. In an age where big budget horror movies like you to hear every arterial spurt and knife stab, GR again goes for relative realism, where the sounds you hear are not sound effects, but practical sounds that the characters themselves would experience. This turning away from sound effects lends credence again to the realism of the film.

Pacing: 5/5
Another area where the film shines is pacing. Set nearly entirely inside the most derelict and decrepit green room in history, you'd be forgiven for thinking the movie may be slow. You would be mistaken, as once the action kicks in at about 30 minutes, it bites down and does not let go right up til the end. This is thanks to a complete upending of many genre stereotypes and asymmetrical information on the part of the audience. We are anxiously experiencing the captivity with our protagonists, knowing little of ""why"".

Fear Factor: 4/5
Green Room borrows and executes (!) one of the most effective horror devices. The subversion of expectations and withholding of information. These two things are what keep the terror button firmly pressed. Part of the terror comes from the realistic way the movie plays out. Final girls and saviors be damned, this movie has no heroes, only survivors. Couple this with an intentionally head-scratching plot and you feel right there with the band of misfits. Terrified, confused, and pushed to the limit. To quote another movie, ""Everyone reaches a point where they will do the unthinkable"". The guerrilla-style improvised weapons and 'better safe than sorry' savagery of the band explores the nature of what the human will to survive is capable of. Just don't get too attached to anyone, because I guarantee this won't play out the way you think!

Final Score: 4/5

Verdict: Not for the feint of heart, Green Room combines hyper-realistic (yet appropriate) gore with a gritty, grimy atmosphere and genre-upending savagery to provide a non-stop fight for survival. A deadly game of cat and mouse awaits!",1533686400,,3101,4.986460348162476
