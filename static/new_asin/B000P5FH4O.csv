2810501,5,B000P5FH4O,"Yeah, this might be the set to get.  What a well-done series.

What if the studio included an audio track that had all the dialogue, music, and sound effects, but left out the laugh track?  That would be a nice option.

Has that been done on any comedy series DVDs?",1193875200,,265,4.24
2810502,5,B000P5FH4O,It's a good series from the 60's that fairly clear and humorous!  Good item!,1190678400,3,76,4.428571428571429
2810503,5,B000P5FH4O,"I have seasons 1 - 5 on DVD.  THIS HAS GOT TO BE MY FAVORITE COMEDY EVER!  Great family entertainment!  Something you can watch with your kids, without being afraid of what they will be exposed to.

I made a point of letting my kids see this show over and over, because I wanted to have a family ""tradition"" or connection.  My dad and I both really enjoyed Hogan's Heroes, and so have my kids.

The acting in Hogan's Heroes is tremendous.  What I found very interesting was that many of the prominent actors were Jewish, such as Schultz, Lebeau, Gen. Burkhalter, and, believe it or not, Major Hochstetter.  It is interesting because of the hatred that the Nazis had toward the Jewish people.

More trivia:  Werner Klemperer (Col. Klink) said that if the Nazis ever looked good on the show, he would immediately walk off the set.  Also, Col. Hogan and Fraulein Hilda (the second one) were husband and wife in real life.

Wikipedia has a great write up about it: [...]%27s_heroes

I'll soon be buying season 6.",1190505600,2,1008,4.564245810055866
2810504,5,B000P5FH4O,Excellent - the fans in our home are 'hooked'.  It is super to have the programs in chronological order too - it makes much more sense than the ad hoc way the TV stations play them.  A few of the early shows are not quite perfect quality but still very good viewing.  All together a great package.,1189382400,,297,4.175438596491228
2810505,5,B000P5FH4O,"I loved this series, and the shipping was prompt and quick and the series is as funny as it has always been.",1188864000,,108,3.9545454545454546
2810506,5,B000P5FH4O,"My husband and I are enjoying watching Hogan's Heroes every night.  It is funny, relaxing, and brings back memories!  I also saved money by buying the complete set and don't have to buy numerous times to get all the seasons.",1183680000,,224,4.575
2810507,5,B000P5FH4O,"The complete set of six seasons was well worth the wait. I saw Season Six at Walmart and almost bought it there but when I found the complete set on Amazon, it was one of those, ""now's the time"" purchases (wincing as I clicked the purchase button...)  ;^D

You will fine all the episodes very entertaining with lots of healthy laughs. It is really neat watching my kids enjoy the program as much as I have and still do.

The problem is tearing them away from small installments (they wanted to watch four in one sitting). 168 episodes is alot but most of us who saw the originals and re-runs had to wait a week at a time - the wonders of technology today.

Anyhow, the quality of this set is excellent, remastered DVDs, there are a few bonuses on some of the season sets, if there was a negative more bonus material would have been a plus.

Opinion statement: Some say M*A*S*H was the all time hit, Actually I liked Hogan's Heros more and it was more family friendly, very minimal adult-type humor, Hogan's Heros has the type of humor the kids can enjoy, even at their level. Hogan's Heros successful six seasons paved the way for M*A*S*H to become a reality and a success.

It is a good family friendly set and I'll not hesitate to recommend it. It is an investment in some fun moments with you spouse and kids! (...that's 65 cents per episode...)",1183334400,49,1348,4.415322580645161
2810508,5,B000P5FH4O,I watched heroes when it was first shown in the 60's. I loved it then and I love it now. I have just ordered my 2nd complete set because I have worn out my first. there is nothing more annoying than to have your video break up in the  middle of viewing.. I anxiously await receipt of my new heroes. I will be settling in my chair and enjoying.,1182297600,3,343,3.971014492753623
2810509,5,B000P5FH4O,"The comedian Gilbert Gottfried (AF-lac!) has a bit about the least likely idea to make a sitcom about. Picture this: A Nazi-era German prisoner-of-war camp; allied inmates behind barbed-wire. It's a Comedy! Yeah, right. But somehow it made it into production & now it's out on DVD, finally. I'm not saying it's the greatest sitcom or anything, but it's a vaudevillian incarnation; a treat of the first order, and can be watched again and again---the test of a genuinely whimsical show. (""Family Ties"" & ""Barney Miller,"" amongst others, were funny when they were running, but are not at all interesting to me anymore, for instance.) Quite possibly, the thing that saves ""Hogan's Heroes"" is that it wasn't contemporary when it came out. The plots of this WW2-set show run the gamut of the allied inmates trying to swipe or disable anything of a military nature that passes through the camp, to kidnapping German scientists, blowing up bridges miles from camp, and impersonating German officers in town...as they utilize escape tunnels to leave and return to camp, as well as employing hidden radio transmitters to send and receive coded messages from London, and most importantly play on Camp Kommandant Colonel Klink's gullibility to make him an unwitting partner in some measure, in their exploits. TV programs set in specific historical periods are simply not as easily ""dated"" as other shows are (think of ""Sanford & Son,"" ""Growing Pains; even dramas the likes of ""Hill St. Blues""). ""M*A*S*H,"" for instance, is still a great show and, like Hogan's Heroes,"" is holding up well. Exaggerated characters helps too---think of Hawkeye Pierce's Groucho Marx-inspired one-liners in ""M*A*S*H."" Colonel Klink likewise is a standout, and is thus (in my opinion at least) the real star of ""Hogan's Heroes;"" in the same sense that Gracie Allen was more essential than George Burns in making the great Burns & Allen combination successful. Klink's flamboyantly delicious delivery of his oft-repeated (of course, ridiculously untrue) lines, admonishing anyone and everyone that ""There has Nev-er been an escape from Stalag 13!"" or ""This is the toughest P-O-W camp in all of Germany,"" never get old. Even funnier is when he cannot even finish such lines before being told to shut up by General Burkhalter or other visiting superior officers. While you're at it too, there's another show very much like this one. It was made in the the UK and is called ""Allo, Allo."" It's also set in WW2 Europe, but this time in a German-occupied French town. Akin to ""Hogan's Heroes"" the Germans are likewise obtuse while the French resistance attempts to persuade the same unfortunate cafe owner each episode to facilitate their wacky schemes along the lines of Hogan's men. Check out some reviews of it. If you're a fan of ""Hogan's Heroes"" you'll probably think it a riot; I do. Cheers!",1181088000,42,2858,5.031645569620253
2810510,4,B000P5FH4O,"It took me years to assemble something close to a complete collection of Hogan's Heroes episodes from the edited television re-runs back in the 1990's. It was a labor of love that paid off well in the years before the glut of DVD re-releases. Of all the wonderful television classics now available, none excites me more than Hogan's Heroes: one of the most unique, entertaining, and magical creations in television history. I have been patiently awaiting the day when the complete series would become available and I am thrilled that that day is finally here.

Having said that I think greater care and attention to detail should have been devoted to the presentation and packaging of this one-of-a-kind television classic. I would have liked to have seen more DVD extras including more commentary, interviews, subtitle options, maybe a half-hour documentary, and definately a specially designed box to house all the DVDs. This product is simply the individual season packages bundled together in shrink wrap. But alas one can't expect too much from the major studios and their preoccupation with the bottom line (for a prime example of this check out the hack job they did with TV classics like WKRP In Cincinnati and Happy Days... thankfully music copyright royalties are not an issue with the DVD release of Hogan's Heroes).

Fans everywhere can now enjoy, complete and without interruption, any and every episode of the heroics of Hogan and his men in the comfort of their own home. If this isn't modern living I don't know what is.",1179100800,77,1536,4.949612403100775

Some narrowminded dimwits may scoff that you shouldn't laugh about WW II related stuff. So what? I'm from Germany and I love this series and have no problems at all with the way German soldiers are portrayed. I would just like to let you fans know that Hogan's Heroes (German title: Ein Kfig voller Helden) will receive an exlusive Amazon.de (Amazon Deutschland) blu ray release. It's the complete box. The release date is May 3. I can't tell for sure, but it's likely the blu ray set will have regional coding. The pre order price is 89,99  which is about 105-110 $.

It always gets the kids wanting to play ""war"" after they watch an episode with Dad! ;)

There are 6 seasons, totalling 168 episodes! (At about 26 min/episode = over 72 hours of Hogan 's Heroes fun!!!

2810987,5,B000P5FH4O,"I guess if  you are buying this show you know how fabulous and hilarious and witty it is so I am going to skip
as in case you need to reassure yourself then so many others beautifully covered the show itself.

I am going to review the product as in - the DVD set.

WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT IT:
- AMAZING PICTURE QUALITY! Color version all episodes! (except for the first pilot episode in black and white).
- HIGH QUALITY BOXING!
- Fantastic packaging all around.
- It comes beautifully boxed as in picture. It has the exact graphic design and it is beautifully printed and made.
- Inside the box you will find what seems to be two plastic books if you will. Each of those plastic books is really nothing less then a very high quality mulit DVD disc holder. Just like a book it has sort of pages, Eeach of those plastic pages holds two DVD's. When you open the book box,  you can flip pages to get to your specific disc number tha are clearly marked. To take Disc out you just do as you would with any DVD, push to unhinge it and take out. Easy peasy and so neat!
- As I said, there are two DVD containing books boxes. As you can figure out, one per each episode. One is larger then the other since there is more episodes in one year but I don't remember which one and it does not matter.
- The boxed set presents itself fanatastic on the shelf as it can sit and look as one box. It also is very easy to use as you turn it around and take the year that you need to take disc out and then just find your dvd.

PICTURE QUALITY:
- Crystal clear! amazing sharp image. I was very concerned about the image quality as I never bought any remastered DVD's so I di dnot know what to expect. Absolutely mind blowing quality. I am watching on 40"" TV set and it is fabulous. It is so clear that you have amazing sense of depth, detail on the people and object is stunning and the sense of depth is such that you think it is 3D almost.
- Plays fantastic!!!! No problem whatsoever with any of the DVD's so far, and I watched 10. No skipping, no freezing .. nothing. Plays beautifully!!!!
- Each DVD has a menu of all episodes on the DVD, with so far average amount of about 7 or so episodes per DVD. Menu is still picture with names of the episodes.

WHAT COULD BE BETTER:

It does not have Close Captionning option as in Subtitles for hearing impired or any subtitles at all in English nor any other lanugages.
No other spoken languages are available either on this version so in case if you are wondering.
I wish they added those as many more people could enjoy this amazingly hilarious show.

BOTTOM LINE:
Absolutely fantastic show and purchase. Show is so wonderful that our entire family can not wait for another episode to come out when one finishes. Kids as young as 8 enjoy it immensely because it is so funny and it shows many hilarious situations and creative crafty tricks.
People of every age enjoy it. It also helps that despite the age of the show, it feels fresh, it is very fast paced and has fab cast
and also helps that it is such a good quality picture wise and in color. I was debating between this edition and two separate season edition and I think that unless they are different in other way, this is easier for me to store and find when needed as everything is together however if you want each season on separate DVD just find if this is the same thing only boxed separately which I assume should be.

I love the set and I know we will enjoy for many years to come. Definitely something that one can watch over and over again
and this boxed set makes it so easy.",1470009600,51,3565,4.207906295754026

I was told that only by buying the individual series can you get the real deal but that is also not true as only the VHS tapes were the last to be uneditted.  Watching METV won't help as those are very badly edited and missing even more.

Some people have commented on Widipedia about an error in the pilot where Shultz loses his helmet but the next scene he has it again.  These are not errors but the results of scenes being deleted.",1463961600,8,736,4.53030303030303

2811036,5,B000P5FH4O,"Just received the set and watched the first three episodes with my kids and we loved it!  Only one episode is black and white and that is the first one. The rest are in glorious color and I suspect they have been remastered as the quality is very, very good. Also, a big plus for me (and I suspect you, too) is that they are in widescreen. I want to dispel the myth of packaging.  As I read some negative reviews about packaging the disks. They were all packaged neatly and securely and I can see absolutely no way that they could become loose in their packaging.  Maybe the design has been improved. I don't know.  The set of Hogan's heroes is on sale in Amazon right now for approximately $50.00.  That is an incredible deal. Now is the time to think of Christmas shopping.  I could rave on about this program but lastly I want to mention, if you were like me when you saw this program on t.v. you were probably a child.  When you watch the series now as an adult you will appreciate even more, the quality of the acting, the production, the story lines, the quality of the uniforms and props.  I suspect this show was quite expensive to produce at the time.  Buy this set now before it goes up in price. it usually sells or $100.00 on Amazon. You won't be disappointed and I am sure other members of your family will also like it. You don't have to be a war buff to enjoy the show but if you are, you'll really enjoy it.  Seller ships fast.

2811039,4,B000P5FH4O,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

It seems odd to post the title FOND MEMORIES when discussing a show that takes place in a concentration camp. It also shows how times have changed. When HOGANS HEROES first aired on CBS in 1965 I was just 8 years old. I don't remember any outrage over a series that took place in that location not to mention that it was a comedy as well. And this was at a time when those who were viewing it were more likely than not to have either served during WWII or had family who did so. I don't think there was any outrage concerning this show until years later when it came out on DVD and people claimed it was disrespectful. It seems out skin has thinned over the years rather than toughen.

But for those of us who watched the show each week it was a hilarious series that brought forth not just memorable characters but some great catch phrases that are still used to this day, even if those using them have no clue where they came from. I know nuh-think! was heard each week from Sgt. Schultz. I can hear him saying it in my head while typing these words. Thats the lasting impression of this series.

HOGANS HEROES, for those who don't know, took place in a POW (Prisoner of War) camp during WWII and followed the exploits of a group of prisoners who used the camp as a location for their covert missions in Germany. Under the nose of camp Commandant Klink (the great Werner Klemperer), Col. Hogan (Bob Crane) and his men had an entire business beneath the camp in a series of tunnels that had to be seen to be believed. Everything from tailors to mapmaking took place there. Each week Hogan and his men would sneak out of camp via their tunnels, wreak havoc on the Germans and return in time for roll call.

Klink, monocle firmly planted, would chastise Hogan and his men for thinking they could get away with some minor infraction in the camp while all the while they were doing things like blowing up bridges at night. Sgt. Schultz (John Banner), the main guard in the prison, would try to tell the men not to do anything to get him in trouble but at the same time was more friend than foe to them all.

There were standouts among the men who were in the prison as well. Richard Dawson played Cpl. Newkirk before the show ended and he took over as the host of FAMILY FEUD for years. Cpl. LeBeau (Robert Clary) was the Frenchman on the team and later had parts on various soap operas. Sgt. James Kinch Kinchloe (Ivan Dixon) went on to become a notable director of numerous TV series. And Sgt. Andrew Carter (Larry Hovis) stayed with comedy starring on TVs LAUGH-IN. Each of these actors nailed their parts perfectly and when combined in this series made it what it was. As a youngster this was my first exposure to a show that featured a team as opposed to a single star.

The series has been available in DVD for several years now with each season getting its own box. Now CBS/Paramount has released the entire series in one mega-set for a low price. Ive seen some say they could do better with each season but in checking Ive found those priced around $18 so for all six seasons you're talking $108. Right now amazon list this mega-set at just $53. Not only that youll have the entire series in one box rather than 6, something that somehow always results in my being unable to find one or another when I go looking.

Im glad to see CBS/Paramount doing this with a number of their series. I wrote about MISSION IMPOSSIBLE earlier and loved the fact that I could now have all of the series in one place at an affordable price for my collection. As for fitting on my shelf it makes it so much easier this way than several boxes. Is there a lack of extras? I don't doubt it but not enough to make it a problem. As for myself Ive gotten tired of movies/series that offer more time on extras than the original product itself. With so much to watch who has time?

Not only will you save money in buying this set youll also find yourself laughing at many of the antics that made you howl years ago. Some might not be near as funny as when you were 10 but others will make more sense now and give you a different reason to laugh. And at the end try not to find a reason to be insulted by this. There is no doubt that concentration camps were nothing to laugh at. But with shows like this it was the absurdity of the situation that played part and parcel with the laughs that took place. It was showing a former enemy as incompetent rather than a threat. It was about making people laugh. And this show was good at doing just that.",1462752000,5,4580,4.298957126303592

Honestly, I can't figure out how they could have cheapened the packaging unless they put each disc into a paper sleeve. If they did that, it would have certainly protected the discs far better than what is presently done. This is why I offered two stars.

2811053,3,B000P5FH4O,I had the Komplete Collection and this new CBS package is making me wish I still had the other collection. The packaging...who keeps designing this stuff?  It is designed with the idea that you expect everything in it to be scratched right out of the package.  Considering a return on this and a return to the Komplete Collection that had more bonus material as well.  The only advantage to this vs. that one is that this one doesn't take forever to load up with the ridiculous siren opening and mandatory screens before you can choose an episode.  Picture quality is similar to the other collection...sound....the verdict is out.,1458864000,16,630,4.805555555555555

The lack of one star is regarding the packaging. I am pretty sure that watching these DVDs will eventually entail me to find new, sturdier, individual holders for the disks, but that's a really small price to pay for the complete 6 seasons. I recommend, if you're concerned, watching this video: [...] (I started at the opening of the actual discs) -- this will show you how the first four seasons are rather precariously hanging onto a bunch of swinging holders, some missing the tiny plastic required to hold the DVD in. I recently purchased a full set of Get Smart for a similar amount. Each season had its own packaging and it will hold up better. Anyone who has ever owned DVDs or CDs will tell you that once they don't hang on to their holders, they are likely to be scratched, especially if one plans on actually watching them more than once. Nonetheless, they've been trying to rip people off forever on this series, and I, for one, will be more than happy to do what it takes to protect the discs, even if the company has not.",1458086400,8,1189,4.36036036036036

2811097,5,B000P5FH4O,"Based is loosely on the movie Stalag 17 (1953), Hogan's Heroes (1965 TV series) [1965-1971]

The general overall scenario is that they prisoner of war camp 1942, Germany.  Our cast of characters includes but is not limited to:
Col. Robert E. Hogan played by Bob Crane.
Col. Wilhelm Klink played by Werner Klemperer (Known for: Judgment at Nuremberg) also the son of conductor Otto Klemperer. I have a few of Otto Klemperer's recordings.
Sgt. Hans Georg Schultz played by John Banner also played a German sergeant in This Land Is Mine (1943).
Helga / Eva / Girl at Party with the Baron (24 episodes, 1965-1971) played by Cynthia Lynn, originally named Zinta Valda Zimilis
Hilda / Gretchen played by Sigrid Valdis. Sigrid and Crane were married on the set of the show.

This program series starts out and with campy over-the-top skits. Each episode has just enough time to set up a ridiculous task, executing it in a uniquely outlandish way, in the process; something always goes wrong and is adjusted for the last minute.

from columbia house. I've been watching them all week. I use to watch
this as a 8 year old! I can't believe it now. Kids today would never
watch this kind of show. I watched this in reruns but in the 90's
I joined video club just to get these. I had them in closet for years
and watched one every few weeks. this week I started from the beginning
and just couldn't stop watching. Bob Cane was perfect in the role of
Hogan. Klink and Shultz were also perfect. The entire cast is perfect.
The writing is better than Mash! and most shows! It's funnier than almost
anything ever written on tv but is overlooked by critics and other shows
that didn't even come close to it's incredible writing and comedy and
acting. It's ashame this isn't in reruns so kids today can see what's
real comedy is even though it's about one of the worst periods in history.
maybe they wouldn't be so easy to believe in all the socialism and other
ideas that they are being taught in school today! Freedom is worth fighting
under any circumstances and once you let the goverment tell you what to do
or think or eat or drive or whatever freedom is over and the period of history
seems to be forgotten by the youth of today. This show is perfect example of
the difference between America and other countries. This was a comedy but it
could be an example of the difference in attitude of America today and now!",1303516800,2,1448,4.3076923076923075

2811108,4,B000P5FH4O,"I loved Hogan's Heroes as a kid. I used to use Schultz's favorite line whenever I got in trouble. ""I know nuth-ing!"" Now the complete six seasons are available in one set with all 168 episodes.

The series stars Bob Crane as the leader of a group of POWs in a German prison camp during World War II. However, unbeknownst to the Germans, the prisoners are part of the resistance movement and have an extensive operation that is literally underground--as in under the camp in tunnels. The movie seems to me to be a comedic take on Stalag 17, which starred William Holden.

The cast was great, but the German characters were more fun than the Allies. Werner Klemperer won two Emmys in 1968 and 1969 for his role as Col. Wilhelm Klink the commander of the camp. John Banner as the guard Sgt. Schultz was lots of fun. He played a guy who just wanted to get through the war without getting in trouble or killed.

Besides Crane who played Col. Hogan, the good guys included Richard Dawson who played British soldier Peter Newkirk, Robert Clary played French soldier Louis LeBeau, Larry Hovis played American soldier Andrew Carter and Ivan Dixon played American soldier James Kinchloe.

The set includes some extras, but the nice thing is that it uses the original music including the great theme song.

If you liked M*A*S*H, you love Hogan's Heroes. This show doesn't try and get preachy or too adult. It remains an enjoyable family comedy that has held up well in comparison to some of the other classic TV series. I'm surprised Hollywood hasn't turned it into a movie yet as they have done with so many of the classic series.

2811111,3,B000P5FH4O,"I got the complete-series set as a birthday treat and eagerly waited to watch what I believed would be all the full-length episodes as originally aired.  Since I had spent several years taping every episode I could find on TV in the 1990's, I knew I was then getting only edited shows from syndication re-runs.  I also found that, depending on the channel, many episodes shown on one channel contained scenes that were not in the same episode on another channel.  Imagine my GREAT disappointment when I started watching the new DVD's and discovered that they also deleted scenes from the majority of episodes.

While DVD's can offer extras (deleted scenes not shown in original airing, cast and director insider comments), that were rarely available on commercially-made tapes, I would rather have had NONE of the extras in exchange for getting ALL the episodes UN-edited!  The quality of the DVD's is naturally better than my off-TV home-made tapes, and I'm sure the DVD's will last longer, but I still enjoy watching my OLD tapes to see the scenes that are blatantly missing from the NEW DVD's.  I sure do wish they would bring out the unedited episodes in a new DVD set.",1250035200,13,1173,4.782178217821782
2811112,4,B000P5FH4O,"Hogan's Heroes is not the best television comedy ever made.  But it may very well be the most under-rated.  For nearly forty-five years, it has been either pooh-poohed as nothing more than juvenile farce, or it castigated as insensitive and insulting to the victims of Nazi crimes against humanity.  But, reruns of this show have been on tv as long as I am old enough to remember, and I even have seen the program on German tv networks when I was in Europe.  With staying power like that, there must be more to the show than the critics see.

And there is.  First, Hogan's Heroes is one of a handful of contemporaneous sit-coms that debuted in the 1965 television season that became staples in American pop-culture.  The 1965 season was something of a vintage year, as it seems to have launched more than its fair share of the most succesfully syndicated series in tv history -- the sit-coms Hogan's Heroes, I Dream of Jeannie, Get Smart, Green Acres and to a lesser degree, Gidget and F-Troop all debuted in 1965 and went on to have long, long careers on afternoon syndication throughout the 70's and 80's and well into the 90's.  Anyone who grew up in America during the 1970's and 80's can probably remember at least occasionally watching these programs on local television stations in the after-school hours -- along with 1964's Gilligan's Island and Bewitched, and earlier 60's sitcoms like Andy Griffith and McHales Navy.  These programs have become part of the national consciousness of a generation through their on-air omnipresence in syndication.

And the best of the ""Class of '65"", and indeed the best sitcom of the entire late-60's, was Hogan's Heroes.

Heavily indebted to earlier movies like Stalag 17 and The Great Escape, and even a little to Von Ryan's Express, Hogan's Heroes came out in an era when nostalgic programs saluting the war years were all over network television -- Combat, Twelve O'Clock High and The Rat Patrol come immediately to mind as contemporary WWII programs.  Hogan's Heroes combined the already popular ""Service Comedy"" genre to the mid-60's James Bond inspired ""spy craze"", and then set it in a German POW camp in 1943-44.

Hogan's Heroes has more forms of humor to offer beyond farce.  The character Hogan himself has very witty lines, and uses dark gallows humor in the face of danger.  There is very little in the way of slapstick, much of the humor comes at the expense of Colonel Klink and his self-serving pomposity and incredible incompetence, but there are very few pratfalls or other ""pie-in-the-face"" type of humor.  It is largely a verbal comedy, or a comedy based on personalities and personal foibles.

Every major German character - Klink, Schultz, Burkhalter and Hochstetter, were played by Jewish actors - three of whom escaped from Nazi Europe in the 1930's.

The ""Heroes"", are a likable group of colleagues:  Carter, the pyrotechnical genius but otherwise with the naive mentality of an 11 year old boy; Newkirk, the cockney con-man and safecracker; LeBeau, the diminutive French ladies man; and Kinchloe, the steady and and reliable African American radio operator who is also Hogan's right hand man, and for the most part, the program's straight man.  They make a good team, and there is a real sense of comeraderie among them.

The show combined comedy with action.  When Hogan and his men are actually on a mission, the humor is largely absent, except for the occasional one-liner.  Even with 168 episodes, the capers seldom seem repetitive, and usually they manage to build up some suspense.  You know Hogan is going to come out on top, the fun is, seeing how he snatches victory from the jaws of defeat time after time.  There are no firefights, noone dies on screen - but there is cloak and dagger suspense, like an episode of Mission:Impossible with a laugh track.

The Hogan character is a pleasure to watch, and Bob Crane was extremely talented in playing both the level headed, calm in a crisis, well respected leader of men that Hogan actually is, and the naive, childlike inccocent facade that Hogan puts on when conning Klink and the other German officers.

The best dynamic in the show, however, is the relationship between German Guard SGT Schultz, and the POW's, especially Hogan.  The POW's obviously like Schultz, and he likes them, and the whole message get across that all men could be friends if it weren't for the war.

There was also a subtle message at the height of the Civil Rights era that black Americans can be a key member of a social group, too.  Very little is made of Kinchloe's race, he is just naturally and fully accepted by the others without comment on it.

Of course there are huge historical inaccuracies -- there would never have been a POW camp where a Colonel would be housed with sergeants and corporals.  There were separate camps for officers, separate campls for NCO's and separate camps for the rank and file.  While it was common for a POW camp to house prisoners from different allied nations, the different nationals were always housed together - one section of the camp for American, one for UK and Commonwealth prisoner's, etc, etc.  But if you can accept the basic premise of the Nazi's being too stupid to catch on to Hogan's team, you can overlook the historical gaffes too.

2811115,4,B000P5FH4O,"I enjoyed watching Hogan's Heroes when it was originally shown on network television. I was glad to see it is now available. The set I received must be the culmination of each season released separately. I say that because each season is packaged differently and has different pre-show things shown. And, these pre-show things, including the listing of episodes on the disk, are very, very, very loud. I learned to turn off the sound until an episode has actually started.

Each episode is funny, as expected. The Big Three, Klink, Shultz and Hogan, played their parts so well (hard to believe all three are now gone). Their characters never got old for me. It is still fun to watch the cautious friendship both Shultz and Klink form with Hogan.

What did surprise me is, when watching an entire season in a short amount of time, how each episode seems to be pretty much the same as prior episodes. It is also interesting to note all of the guest stars throughout the series, knowing what eventually became of the actor/actress.

I am glad I ordered this set.",1245715200,3,1059,4.682795698924731

2811117,5,B000P5FH4O,"""HOGAN'S HEROES"" is one of those rare sit-coms that could and did combine humor and drama into something that turned into, right from the start, a true classic that everyone from 6 to 90 and beyond of every generation can enjoy.

The premise of making a comedy about a POW camp was impossible - yet they did it! The idea of bringing enough variety to the story of a POW camp week in and week out was not feasible - yet they did it! The combination of both humor and drama in a POW camp could not be put together without being too 'jarring' to the fans - yet they did it! And as interesting as all these combinations could be, it was still a long shot to pull this off in just the right way - yet they did it! And whomever 'they' are and were - directors, producers, actors, writers, etc. - THEY DID IT!

This is a classic that combines truth (there are still POWs that will hint at the little tricks they pulled and sometimes got by with against their POW guards), humor (even against brutal odds in real life, many POWS probably have had to develop a sense of humor to survive their surroundings) and the diligence of the human spirit (POWs have escaped and risked it all to help others as well) - and turns that combination into a CLASSIC FOR ALL TIME!",1244764800,,1254,4.2426778242677825

2811119,1,B000P5FH4O,"Like me, you'd probably be happy to spend the money they're asking for this complete set of all six seasons of Hogan's Heroes. If it were only the show being reviewed here, 5 stars wouldn't have been enough! But like me, you'll probably also be disappointed when you receive your package only to find that there is nothing here that you couldn't have gotten for around $23 less by just ordering the individual seasons at (current Amazon price) $15.99.

It's a sucker deal! There's absolutely no advantage to paying the extra dough because you get nothing extra for the money! Not even a nice box to contain and/or display the set, nothing at all other than the same six seasons, in the same untidy packaging that you'd get for the lower price of $95.94 if buying the seasons separately! And with Amazon's free shipping on orders over $25 or free 2-day shipping with an Amazon prime membership, shipping costs don't play into it at all.

The set doesn't display nicely on a shelf because the spines aren't uniform, nor are the seasons identically packaged.

Season 1: 5 discs, each in its own slimcase.

Seasons 2 and 3: 5 discs in only 3 slimcases (per season), meaning that two of the three cases contain 2 discs each.

Seasons 4, 5 and 6: 4 discs in two slimcases (per season).

That's 6 sets in boxes of three different sizes with unidentical print design on the spines. There is no ""good side"" to display!

What the...? Add it all up and you have an untidy, not so great looking set for purposes of presentation on a shelf or media rack. Still, it's Hogan's Heroes! Buy it, but be smart and buy the separate seasons!",1239062400,155,1620,4.546391752577319

I spend 3 years in Germany near where the show was to take place.  the Clarity is pretty good.  the format is still in the old 4:3 format, or close to it.

I compared the two and the DVD set is missing a couple inches of the edge.  I know this because I kept some of the episodes on my DVR and kept going back and forth to compare.  it's still a great series and it's really not that important that some of the edge is missing.  At least none of the show is cut out, like they did on one channel, they cut out 5 minutes of each episode for commercials, and I hate that.  so the bottom line is that you will probably be very pleased with the product, I just wish they would have sold the series in HD format or blue Ray.

2811141,5,B000P5FH4O,"I love this show (so much I even named my dog a white English Bulldog Col. Hogan after the star) I watch all of them over and over ask my brother and parents thay tell me that ""all thay here from my TV is the theme song"",I became a fan when my Dad got the first season for his birthday and we watched them together that night and once he had fallen asleep (as he always dose when we watch something at night)I took them in my room and I still keep them there he always says ""you stole them"" wich I guess I did, and from then on I got all of the other seasons one by one (wich means the onley one I realy stole was the first season).One thing you will notice is that Col. Hogan (Bob Crane) and froiline Helga (Col. Klinks secratary) kiss alot LUKALY! This stops in the second season (when a new actris comes and plays as Klinks new secratary froiline Hilda) oh and don't expect them to act like shes eneybody diferant,and after that its all the same acters/acrises ontil the last season when Staff Sergant Kinch (Ivan Dixon) leaves and a new guy comes (who is not as good an acter) Sergant Backer (Keneth Washington) oh and just like the secratary no one acts as if eneybodys diferant. I became a WW2 Expert after I watched these not because thay were acurate but because it got me interested in WW2 I started watched documentereys on the History channel I even bought some surrpluss from a web site called VisionForum.com woa woa woa!

2811144,5,B000P5FH4O,"While this show was airing long before I was around, I remember watching the re-runs with my father.  I always enjoyed Hogan's Heroes far more than the other WWII films that we often watched together, although now that I am older I have a new appreciation for films like Midway.

For those of you who are unfamiliar with the show, it's about a group of allied pilots from England, the U.S., and France who are in a German P.O.W. camp during WWII, guarded by Commandant Klink and the illustrious Sergeant Shultz.  If you are wondering how on Earth this constitutes as a comedy, you are not alone--even Werner Klemperer, the actor who portrays Commandant Klink and whose Jewish father had to flee Germany in the 1930s to escape Hitler, thought the producers were crazy.  The beauty of the show is the satirical premise that within a P.O.W. camp could be the greatest sabotage ring operating in Germany during the war.  Throughout the show's run, Colonel Hogan (Bob Crane) and his men (although they are often assisted by others) blow up bridges, destroy factories, leak troop movements and diagrams of new weapons to the British, discredit the Gestapo, and perhaps most importantly, smuggle countless prisoners and defectors to England, usually via a secret submarine but other times via plane, train, and even a hot air balloon constructed in camp!  Then there are the girls, or ""birds"" as resident Englander Corporal Newkirk (Richard Dawson--pre-Family Fued) calls them, who are slender, buxom, and usually fall head-over-heels for ladies' man Colonel Hogan.  The show isn't free of cliche or sexism (come on, this was the 60s!), but it's still immensely enjoyable.

Making this series was a smart move to make on the producers' part, despite the oddball outline.  There was enough distance from the bulk of the fallout from the war that audiences would appreciate such humor, especially as this was taking place during the rumbles of the Vietnam War.  Unlike M*A*S*H, which portrayed the realities of the war (although centered around the Korean conflict, the show could easily be applied to Vietnam), Hogan's Heroes portrayed a farsical bent to the horror that was often applied to such camps in WWII.  Generals are easily fooled into thinking that a prisoner doing a fairly decent impersonation of Hitler is the real McCoy, Sergeant Shultz and Colonel Klink are constantly manipulated into Hogan's hands with the mere mention of the Russian front, the Gestapo barely notice that a premier general has somehow developed a strong Russian accent (because he was being impersonated by a klutzy Russian actor), and even the German Shepherd guard dogs are sweet-as-pie to the prisioners while maintaining a gruff exterior around the guards.  It's hardly the reality of the situation (although there was considerable sabotage inflicted by the various underground forces during the war, something the show often relies heavily upon for assistance for the Allied prisoners), but there's enough patriotism, incredible gags, and a great acting ensemble to keep audiences entertained for years.

As far as this packaging goes, now that it's been out for a while, the cost is comparable to buying the seasons individually.  Season two has the most (and the best) special features, including Bob Crane's wedding, home movies taken on the set, CBS promos that are absolutely hilarious, a blooper reel, a Jell-o/Dream Whip commercial with the cast, and a few other tv spots.  Most of the other seasons contain photo galleries and the occasional extra (like Werner Klemperer on The Pat Sajak Show).  I found the quality to be very good, especially for a show of this age.

If you are a fan and haven't collected the individual seasons yet, this is definitely for you.  If you have some of the first seasons already, there aren't any extra features in this package (that I know of).  If you are wanting to check out the show first before you commit, I'd suggest renting the first or fourth season first (my favorites - although if you watch the original pilot episode you get a mixed message on one of the characters...he ends up staying as part of the ""gang"" when in the pilot he is just another soldier being sent to England).  Most rental places will have it, especially on-line ones like Blockbuster and Netflix.  It hasn't been shown on any cable/satellite channels for years that I know of (TV Land used to), so unfortunately this is as good as we are going to get at the moment.",1210636800,17,4470,4.933333333333334
