6108046,5,B00GST8O8W,This is a wonderful family movie. It presents a positive message to children and adults alike and helps to show that even though there are things happening in their life that they cannot control there is a way to deal with those problems and find love and understanding. Really do want to see more movies like this one.,1403913600,2,319,4.517241379310345

6108049,4,B00GST8O8W,"Overall I believe this was a good movie, what I liked is how they mentioned there is only one way and that is through (JESUS) the importance of having a relationship with HIM, but what is needed to share is obedience,holiness. I would like to share the true Hebrew sacred names YAHUVEH(GOD),YAHUSHUA (JESUS). I liked how they shared how JESUS(YAHUSHUA )can change lives -it is only through HIM we can be set free,healed and delivered. HE can make you new through HIS holy shed blood, repent of your sins strive for holiness , develop an obedient relationship with HIM.another thing I would like to share is you do not have to be apart of a church building , what JESUS really wants and desires is that you would seek HIM one on one and you can do this right in your home. Seek HIM with all of your heart, being willing to turn away from your sins and walk in obedience too HIM.lastly, the baptism at the end should not be dressed in black , white should be worn to symbolizied Holiness, purity. Please learn the Jewishness of our Messiah JESUS is a greek name),both the Father YAHUVEH(GOD),and YAHUSHUA(JESUS ) have YAH in it, it means YAH saves. One last thing know that you can be healed of anything , you can be delivered and I pray this helps someone",1402185600,6,1254,4.456521739130435

6108061,4,B00GST8O8W,Predictable character archetypes; my children loved it; humor/angst/redemption; not too mushy,1428364800,,93,7.545454545454546
6108062,4,B00GST8O8W,"This is a great family movie, my girls and I enjoyed watching it together. They got excited for summer camp and we registered them for Camp Harlow this summer!",1427068800,,159,4.517241379310345
6108063,4,B00GST8O8W,Good movie to show a group of young teens or at home with family,1426464000,,64,3.642857142857143
6108064,4,B00GST8O8W,"Becomes a sweet film as it progresses.  Shows a camp counselor reaching out and befriending a hurting teen.
Doesn't hesitate to say Jesus' name in a caring way.
Has some excellent Christian lines, full of wisdom.
There's a song near the end that the hurting teen writes--it's beautiful in words and melody.
This is a film worth seeing, with a happy ending.",1426464000,2,356,4.741935483870968
6108105,1,B00GST8O8W,"This movie could have been so much more!!!  It had a great story line but they failed to bring out the best in the acting.  The low budget films do have challenges with the use and number of cameras so they did a good job with what they had technologically.  The reason why I rated this so low was that the lack of energy, emotion, and overall acting in many of the characters.  It was as if a church youth group wanted to make a film.  Some could act, but too many didn't bring the emotional connection to draw in the audience.",1424476800,3,528,4.137254901960785

6108107,5,B00GST8O8W,"A very well performed, heart warming, all ages, family movie.",1421280000,,61,5.2
6108108,4,B00GST8O8W,"First of all no one gets saved just by saving a prayer. There must be true conviction from sin and faith in what Christ alone has merited on the behalf of sinners, But I like how the movie portrayed a change in behaviour after the main character got saved. Especially how she cried out to God in tears about how difficult it was to continue going after things were different around resulting from the change inside of her. I especially like how she stated how God's love just surrounds her. It highlights in a sense the change that Christ makes in our hearts when we come to Him. Which I think the movie did pretty well in showing, which is why I really like it.",1419984000,3,662,4.304
6108109,4,B00GST8O8W,slow and questionable start; enjoyed this over all once my interest was caught. positive ending leaves several what ifs and what happens to the old crowd.,1419897600,,154,4.961538461538462

6108113,5,B00GST8O8W,This was a great movie.  We used it for a movie night for tweens and Moms at our church.  The acting and cinematography were both quite good and the messages were very well done without being awkwardly heavy-handed.  It was great for the younger girls but also enjoyable for the Moms too.  It touches on quite a few subjects that are important for our girls without trying to do so much that the messages get lost.  Would definitely recommend for teen and tween girls.,1410134400,,468,4.523809523809524

6108146,5,B00GST8O8W,A great movie that show well both sides of the coin dealing with life. Highly recommended if you are not against Christian based film. If you are its still a great film.,1408233600,,169,4.3125

6108148,5,B00GST8O8W,"Here's what I'm putting on Amazon in a few minutes: I just got through watching Camp Harlow: The Movie, and though I'm not really into the ""Christian movie"" scene, I've got to tell you, films like this are why I got into filmmaking. Keep your spectacular stunts, your gunplay, your F-bombs every other word and your million-dollar explosions. They're for other movies and other settings. This is beautifully shot, beautifully acted, beautifully directed and written in a way that will demonstrate how much heart, soul, blood, sweat and tears the cast and crew put into the project. That alone is enough to make the unsuspecting fully appreciate this little movie.",1406332800,9,663,5.036363636363636
