2260800,5,B00092RHEQ,I love this movie! Gordon Liu is my all time favorite kung fu actor/performer. I love how expressive his face is in particular. These fight scenes are intricate and very well choreographed. The person who rated this only 4 stars is not very knowledgeable!,1401408000,,255,4.818181818181818
2260801,5,B00092RHEQ,"I'm not going to sit here and tell you I'm some kind of Kung Fu film connoisseur, far from it. In my childhood ""Chop'socky"" movies
were just something to click to while channel surfing between commercials. But somewhere along the line I caught the Kung Fu bug.

Shaolin & Wu Tang is an odd film. describing what has made it so Iconic in the USA is difficult. You could say that its popularity among the Hip Hop world is actually based on it's now iconic ""English Dubbed"" voice track. After all this is what appears in sampled form on The RZA's albums. But their is more to it than that. I don't think we knew much about Wudang before this film was ""rediscovered"" and its rivalry between Shaolin while FANTASY is pretty cool, since all ""cool"" movie versions of things need rivals.

Then there is its IMMACULATE choreography, no seriously the kung fu in this movie is clean and everyone seemed to be in top form. The Shaolin techniques look cool and complicated, while the Wudang 8 techniques sword style looks smooth and effortless.
Also there is that incredibly clever way the movie progresses its plot, a simple little trick that I just find brilliant and love.
All these things come together to form this classic iconic film.

Funny considering the film is actually average at best...
The plot while cool, is set up in such a idiotically illogical way...
Characters come to conclusions that leave you scratching your head in disbelief at how they came to them...
And believe it or not the film has few SATISFYING fights, most are short skirmishes that are constantly interrupted and even the final fight leaves you wanting for more what with the techniques being used looking so friggin cool.
Also the film feels like it was originally too short, so an UNRELATED 5 minute wushu type performance is added to the beginning for no reason than to add to its length.

Yet none of these things stop the film from being the classic it has become. Weird huh?
By the way this film not being a true ""SB release"" has yet to receive a proper modern release, and may never will.
The 2 dvd versions available each have their issues. The UNCUT Xenon version is pan&scan (full screen) and has some rather large burned it subtitles even thought it's in English. The Red Sun version is WIDESCREEN in English and Cantonese  with working subtitles BUT is CUT and has a very dark image.

I chose the Red Sun version which oddly enough has the CUT scenes added to the end after the credits...",1394928000,5,2472,4.594104308390023
2260802,5,B00092RHEQ,Good DVD. I was very pleased and couldn't be more happy. Thank you for a classic. I was very impressed.,1369180800,,103,4.2
2260803,5,B00092RHEQ,This movie is awesome.  Great Action and fast moving.  I am a big Gordon Lu fan and he stared and directed this one.  I really love the ending as it has a nice surprise.  You won't be disappointed if you get this film.,1327536000,,218,4.0
2260804,5,B00092RHEQ,"great film. same as shaolin AND wutang, just a different box. it arrived on time and without any issues. a must have for collectors",1327017600,,131,4.5
2260805,4,B00092RHEQ,"This is an excellent Gordon Liu movie. One of his best. At least one of my favorites. There are some amazing scenes thorough the film. One of my favorites is at the end. I don't know how they did some of this stuff. I have trained Martial arts since age 3 so I know a little bit about it and I have to say that some of this stuff is excellent.

Here is the setting: A Manchu Prince (Lung Wei Wang) uses trickery to coax the secret fighting skills out of the Shaolin and Wu Tang masters. He the creates a rift between two young students (Gordon Liu and Adam Cheng) who were once the best of friends despite their respective backgrounds. Forcing the two disciples to return to their temples and seek advice from their superiors. When they later reunite, their differences forgotten. Shaolin and Wu Tang team up to fight the Manchu Menace.

As I said some very good stuff in this one a must for all Gordon fans. And some new faces. The open of the film has some pretty flashy Shaolin and Wu Tang Martial Skills going on. Its a nice film it does have some humor in it.",1172188800,7,1064,4.236453201970443

2260808,5,B00092RHEQ,"This movie is a bit silly, but still enjoyable. The constant nut grabbing had me on the floor laughing like a small child. A pretty decent transfer of this movie. 16:9 for widescreen TV. Worth the price.",1468022400,,203,4.513513513513513

8056788,3,B00092RHEQ,"If this had a remotely decent visual quality, the movie would rate at least 4 stars.  The story is, as usual, exactly the same as any other revenge story.  It bogs down even more because the main characters are all morons.  They are as easily manipulated and are impulsive and clueless as 5 year olds.
But at least the ending is a bit of a deviation from the standard.
Skip all of the plot and just watch the fight scenes.",1525219200,,422,4.25

8056790,5,B00092RHEQ,"Classic film, two rival schools are wooed by a corrupt diplomat, who is trying to learn the best fighting style. A tale of friendship, betrayal, honor, and redemption. Highly recommend for martial arts film fans, especially Kung Fu film fans.",1520294400,,242,5.075
8056791,4,B00092RHEQ,"Some complain about the visual quality but as for me it gives a nostalgic appeal.  I get more amp when hearing the portions of the movie that the Hip Hop super group Wu-Tang Clan sampled on their debut album.  Being that it is a Gordon Liu flick, I give it 4 stars when compared to The 36th Chamber of Shaolin and Return To The 36th Chamber which are both in my opinion 5 star classics.",1515369600,,386,4.133333333333334
