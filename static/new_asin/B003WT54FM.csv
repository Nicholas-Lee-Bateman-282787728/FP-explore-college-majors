8407521,4,B003WT54FM,"I did like it, it was a very simple workout, but there are a few things I didn't like so that is why the 4 stars. You need a adjustable bench, dumbbells different weights, and a yoga mat for the abs. First and foremost the form. Knees behind toes is very important in doing squats, send the behind back like your sitting in a chair. Lunges knees over ankle on the leg that is going forward. The concept of everything is great, super setting with little rest in between sets. When doing side raises and front raises there is no need to lift higher then shoulder. The other thing I noticed on stiffed legged dead lift is that he didn't have a straight back. He is very knowledgeable and I do like that about him. I rented this so I could try it before buying it, well I actually viewed it before doing it, so I knew what to expect. Well I'm not going to be buying this one because I'm past beginner level. I hope that his newer ones are with better form.",1416441600,,952,4.179347826086956
