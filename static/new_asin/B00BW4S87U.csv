5678786,5,B00BW4S87U,"This is a technical quality review of the new disc, not a review of the film itself.

Stephen King's THE LANGOLIERS has been on DVD since the early days of the medium. Artisan Entertainment/Republic Pictures issued that old DVD back around 1999-2000. It's one I purchased way back when, but about a year ago, when I went to watch it, the disc suddenly would not play. It wouldn't read in any player or computer. It was simply dead. I rationalized that the Langoliers must have eaten the data off the disc.

Knowing that the disc wasn't ever very expensive, I thought I'd grab a working copy from the Internet, which is what I did. It seemed to be out of print last year, so I had to resort to finding it in the marketplace as a used copy. The new copy played fine, but I noticed a tiny hairline crack near the central hub of the disc, so I figured that even this new disc would someday possibly fail.

Recently, while shopping in a store, I saw THE LANGOLIERS on the shelf with new front artwork. At the time, I assumed it was simply a re-issue with new artwork as so often happens. Making note of it, I checked it out here in the Amazon.com listings and was unable to determine just what this new disc was. It said it was from Spelling Entertainment, whereas my old copy said Artisan/Republic.

Nevertheless, curiosity got a hold on me and I obtained the newer package of THE LANGOLIERS. Now that I had it in my hands, I could see that the new disc was issued by CBS/Paramount, giving me a pretty good clue that perhaps a remaster had taken place. Checking it out, I find that the picture quality is an improvement over the old Artisan disc. The blacks are blacker, and the color palette is warmer while the image is a bit brighter. At the very least, the fact that this was a CBS/Paramount issue told me that it probably would be a disc that wouldn't go bad over time. Their quality control is usually pretty good on the manufacturing side. I've placed a few screenshot samples over at the Home Theater Forum where you can see the difference in brightness and color palette.

There are also some additional audio languages included on this one - English, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese. The original was English-only I believe.

Make no mistake, this is still a DVD of a '90s program that was finished in the video realm, meaning that it'll never be anything resembling high definition. The picture is still soft, and there's still a bit of grittiness in some scenes, particularly when any special effects processing took place.

So, if you're a fan of the film and want to spend a little to upgrade a little, this disc will do the job. It'll look a little better on today's bigger TVs. Just don't expect a miraculous improvement and you'll be satisfied.",1379462400,39,2755,4.509018036072145

There are no special features and commentary and I really didn't care, at least I can watch this great film. Watching the dvd is totally clear (not as much on Blu-Ray) but it works. The cover is okay but what can you do. Best actors like Bronson Pinchot (Perfect Strangers) has a great role as a bad guy, he is a nice guy on Perfect Strangers (One of my best t.v. shows) he play it well. David Morse (The Green Mile, The Negotiator) he played well as a role as the pilot. If there was no pilot in this film they would crash and burn end of story. And the others did well too. I thought the story did very well. I thought those Langoliers were creepy looking, not scary but the effects did very well. I love the relationship between the Mystery Writer and Albert (Nerdy Guy) they did great well together.

Laughable special effects, script and overall progression of the story.
A King clichfest if ever there was one, complete with unexplained psychic links, budding romances, human badguy, and some of the luckiest wild hunches ever.
Im currently concerned about the state of mind of the reviewers like maybe they were in an oxygen deprived air cabin before writing their reviews.
Please if you were alive when movie was made and watched it then, doesnt mean it was good then and it still isnt.
Just don't watch it through the nostalgia goggles and you will most likely be wondering what you were thinking back when you thought this was a good movie.
For the newer generation, they will see this for what it ishilariously terrible, easily one of the worst King movies everbut hey don't take my word for it, I believe it is available to watch on youtube.

the plot

During a typical red eye flight from LAX to Boston, there was a strange occurrence.  At some point during the flight, all of the passengers and crew have disappeared.  There was no trace of the people who have vanished, except if you count their clothes, jewelry, watches, even pace makers that were left on their assigned seats.  There were nine people left on the plane including a pilot who was on his way to Boston to bury his ex wife.

As the shrunken passenger list are trying to piece together what had happened, the pilot who has assumed the abandoned controls and finds that either the radio is broken or no one is down on the ground to accept or hear his calls.  He makes a decision to land the plane in the Bangor, Maine airport as it's known to have less traffic. They hypothesize that when they passed through the aurora borealis over the Mojave Desert, that they accidentally went back in time only by a few minutes. When they land, they are surprised again to find the airport deserted as well.

A little blind girl named Dinah was on the plane, and now in Maine, she hears off in the distance a horrific crunching noise, and it's coming closer towards them.  Meanwhile, there is another passenger named Craig Toomey, he is a mentally unstable businessman who is both dangerous and paranoid of all the others.  Will the other nine passengers be able to steer clear of Toomey and his revengeful ways?  Will they be able to figure out a way to get back to their own time before that crunching sound catches us to them?  Find out when you buy The Langoliers on DVD.

the breakdown

When everybody has disappeared from the plane, you may begin to wonder if this is actually Left Behind you're watching.  Fear not, your soul is safe from that lame Chri-Fi (christian-fiction) film, although this scene is nearly identical.  The Langoliers is actually a pretty cool sci-fi story from the king of horror Stephen King.  Remember the days when we could look forward to ABC-TV airing it's annual Stephen King film every May?  Practically year after year we would either be delighted or terribly let down by the adaptation of one of King's magical stories.  Well we haven't had that pleasure in a number of years.  I believe his Nightmares and Dreamscapes' short stories was the last one made into a TV miniseries, from back in 2006, but I could be wrong.  The Langoliers was originally shown over two nights in two-hour (with commercials) segments.

Despite the shoddy (at times) acting by a couple of the actors, I really enjoy this made for TV movie.  Stephen King, although he writes Horror stories for the most part, he is good at the sci-fi genre as well.  His stories like Lawnmower Man, The Running Man, The Long Walk, The Jaunt, It and even the Gunslinger series are all fine examples of his sci-fi tales of horror.  As far as acting goes, Dean Stockwell (Bob Jenkins), David Morse (pilot), Mark Lindsay Chapman (Nick, hired assassin) and Bronson Pinchot (Craig, madman) all gave solid performances.  Yet as far as Kimber Riddle (Bethany) and Baxter Harris (Rudy, nerd) were concerned, their faade was transparent.  I didn't believe their fear or panic for one instant.  The fact that Baxter Harris jumps up, practically clicking his heels together and shouting Yeah' at the end of the movie in order to get a good freeze frame shot makes me laugh every time.  Yet, somehow it doesn't take away from the movie's plot, but it does make it resemble a made-for-TV movie (which it was) very much.

The acting and the set kind of cheapens it.  Most of this film was actually shot in Bangor, Maine - home to Stephen King himself.  It was so convenient to his house, that he actually decided to make a cameo appearance in the movie.  The Langoliers themselves turned out to be as frightening as Craig Toomey warned the rest of the passengers during the whole movie.  I guess most of the budget was reserved for the computer graphics, which made up what was The Langoliers.

Aside from all the few downfalls of this film, it will still keep you on the edge of your seat for almost the whole three hours.  Unfortunately, the DVD is out of print and the few copies you can find online for sale are pretty expensive, nearing $40 usually.  If you can catch it on the sci-fi channel or some other cable channel, it would definitely be more feasible to watch this way.  Yet, it may actually be worth the money if you decide to take the plunge.

5678895,4,B00BW4S87U,"If I had my druthers, if ABC had to do a teleplay off a story from Four Past Midnight - which was Stephen King's Bram Stoker Award-winning anthology - my first choice would be ""The Library Policeman."" That was my favorite of the four novellas. Then again, ""The Langoliers"" was my second favorite story off that collection. It's surprising they went that route, though, because ""The Langoliers"" was a leisurely-paced read that I thought would've translated poorly to television. But it worked for me. I liked the movie... with a caveat or three.

You should know, minor spoilers throughout from now on.

It's essentially an extended Twilight Zone episode, even though the first half of the two-parter comes off like a John Dickson Carr locked room mystery - and that was a neat selling point for me since I cut my teeth on Carr. Plot: During a red-eye flight from Los Angeles to Boston, ten passengers awaken to find themselves the only ones left on the jumbo jet. The mystery only deepens as the survivors eyeball stuff scattered on empty seats, stuff normally found in people - bridgework, surgical pins, pacemakers... Further investigation reveals that no one is flying the plane. Worse, all attempts to contact nearby control towers only produce dead air over the radio frequencies.

It begs the question: ""Where did everybody go and why didn't we go with them?"" Luckily, among the ten is veteran mystery writer, Bob Jenkins (Dean Stockwell), who begins piecing the cryptic clues together. And since Stephen King and excess go together like a mime and a slap, we're also thrown in the presence of a psychic blind girl, a wetwork operative, and, most conveniently, a pilot. And the rest of the ten? There's a stoner chick, a nerd teen violinist, a timid 5th grade schoolteacher, a Hughes Aircraft mechanic, a businessman, and a banker. Now, that last one, banker Craig Toomy (Bronson Pinchot), you can tell right away he's a problem. Toomy is one of those cats who doesn't handle stress too well. He is a bully, the sort of creep who manages his insecurities thru displays of aggression. First inkling we get that the blind little girl may be tapped into the occult is when she says of Toomy as he passes by: ""There's something in that man's head.""

Was it because American Pride Flight 29 passed thru the Aurora Borealis over the Mojave Desert? Did that f--- sh-- up? The subsequent stopover at the Bangor, Maine airport only escalates that sense of dread, provides more disquieting clues. In the deserted airport terminal - yes, even on the ground, these ten are still the only people around - why is the beer flat and the sodas won't carbonate? Sandwiches have no taste. Matches won't ignite. And sounds are muffled. That condescending mystery writer, Bob - who for some reason pretentiously calls people ""Dear boy"" or ""Dear girl"" - he's real busy forming peculiar deductions.

Stephen King presents a different and very unique take on time travel. He posits that, in this sort of time travel, there is no preventing Lincoln's assassination. There is no butterfly effect. No meeting yourself in the past. All there is, is flat beer and crap sandwiches and, soon, the Langoliers. Of this latter, a horrified Bob would say in a hushed tone: ""Now we know, don't we? We know what happens to today when it becomes yesterday. It waits for them.""

It's too bad that the CG can't do the Langoliers justice. These are the monsters that have been preying on the banker's mind, driving him insane, and when we at last eyeball the suckers, the visuals disappoint. They look like menacing meatballs or Pacman with cellulitis, these skittering spherical objects with nasty, gnashing, chomping teeth that devour everything, I mean, everything. The mystery writer labels them ""purpose personified,"" and, bub, he ain't wrong.

There are three acts to the story. First act is what happens when the survivors first wake up. Second act is what happens at the Bangor airport terminal. Third act is when they're back onboard the plane, and one final, fiendish twist is unveiled. The acting was okay, I guess. The script seemed to call for Stockwell to play his role as a caricature of a mystery writer, and it was a bit aggravating that he took forever to get to his points. And it's up to you whether to buy what Bronson Pinchot is selling. His crazed banker could either be effectively chilling or ridiculously hammy. My favorite character was probably the mysterious Brit, Nick Hopewell (Mark Lindsay Chapman), the, uh, ""junior attache to the British embassy,"" although moments later he confesses he's more like ""Her Majesty's mechanic."" Either way, he's awesome with the painful nose lock. The rest of the cast seem to swim by in a haze. No one else really stands out that sharply. Certainly the most blah character is that businessman whose defining characteristics are that he is either napping or hungry. Patricia Wettig, whom I'd seen in better roles, can't do much with her thankless part of the banal schoolteacher AND she gets saddled with the movie's most vapid line: ""Daisies. I'm talking about daisies."" Stephen King himself makes a very quick cameo, playing a figment of Toomy's feverish imagination.

For the most part, I like the human drama that plays out, but maybe it's because I'd read the novella which had gone more in-depth with the characters so, diving into the movie, I felt like I already knew them. The down side is that if you hadn't read the story, these folks don't have much in the way of rich character work. I liked the element of mystery, never mind that I knew what was coming. The jangly piano riffs certainly help to set an unnerving atmosphere. This is one of those horror stories in which the monster is something so uncaring and so beyond us - the Langoliers' threat level is actually even beyond extinction level - that there's nothing we can do except run away really fast and really far.

3.5 out of 5 stars for this one. I would've loved it if there'd been a fourth act in which we track what happens to the survivor(s) afterwards. Again, SPOILER ALERT: Not everyone in the group make it, but those who do end up in their rightful time. But, in the wake of what they'd gone thru, back in normalworld, you still have this Lockheed L-1011 jumbo jet that suddenly appears on the tarmac at LAX and is alarmingly absent of a crap ton of passengers.

5678896,5,B00BW4S87U,"I've loved this story ever since I first read it and then saw it as a two-part series on TV. As usual, Stephen King takes a relatively simple idea for a story and turns it into something that scrambles your mind.

Cons:
4;3 aspect ratio because it was was made for TV back in 1995. Still, it's an excellent DVD quality version of the original VHS tape.
It gets a little slow at times, but that's just Stephen King's style

Pros:
Bronson Pinchot is just AMAZING! Really creepy!
An excellent story if you enjoy Stephen King
They crammed the entire 3 hours (Two 2 hour episodes with commercial breaks in the original) onto one DVD.

5678975,4,B00BW4S87U,"On one level, Stephen King's THE LANGOLIERS (TV-1995) really worked for me as I'm not the most relaxed airline traveler. Not a perfect film by any means (CGI effects are cartoonish), but it does follow Roger Corman's #1 rule of monster movies: build up anticipation as long as possible before showing the creature(s).

The plot's intriguing: ten passengers on a jam-packed jet flying non-stop from L.A. to Boston awake in the middle of the night to discover that all the other passengers and the flight crew have vanished, leaving behind personal possessions like jewelry, pocket change, false teeth, Walkmen, watches (all stopped at 7 after 4), reading material, etc. Fortunately for those still on the plane, among them is an off-duty airline pilot (David Morse). After the cockpit door's forced open, he takes the captain's seat.

When there's no answer on any radio frequency it soon becomes apparent that everyone on the ground has also disappeared. Stress from this dilemma is worsened by one self-important loudmouth (Bronson Pinchot) who won't stop screaming about the necessity of making a 9 am meeting in Boston. Only the threat of violence from other passengers shuts him up, but this cold sweating paranoiac is sure to cause more trouble.

Also on the plane: a burly tool & die maker (Frankie Faison), a teen girl (Kimber Riddle) sent East to a rehab, a young man (Christopher Collet) who's off to college on a violin scholarship, a blind girl of about 12 (Kate Maberly) hoping that an operation will restore her eyesight, a fifth grade schoolteacher (Patricia Wettig) who becomes the child's guardian, a chubby guy (Baxter Harris) who's first and last thought is of food, a mystery writer (Dean Stockwell) that's obviously King's surrogate (his surmises advance the story) and a secretive, take-charge kind of felllow with a British accent (Mark Lindsay Chapman) who assists the pilot and also helps maintain order. As the story progresses we learn details of each person's life, and there's some pairing off, romantic or otherwise.

As they fly cross-country above an unending cloud cover, questions remain. Where did everybody else go? Why were these few left behind? What will be found once they reach their destination and will they even be able to land safely?

If you're a fan of Stephen King screen adaptations or of good mystery stories, THE LANGOLIERS is really worth seeing.",1448236800,2,2397,5.042929292929293

5678987,4,B00BW4S87U,"I enjoyed this movie. It did keep me wondering what exactly was going to happen to the passengers on the airline throughout the story. It was not what I would ever call 'horror' but it is more suspenseful. It actually reminded me of an old Twilight Zone episode called ""The Odyssey of Flight 33"" where an airline full of passengers somehow get warped through time. However, I will just let you know in advance that when you finally see the Langoliers, they are so completely fake for today's audience, it could completely ruin the credibility of the story. But just take it with a grain of salt knowing that it was not made with the kind of computer effects we have today. It is also a long movie, about 3 1/2 hours in length so be prepared to settle down for a while if you watch it in one sitting. But it's a fun story to watch.",1441411200,,830,4.292993630573249

The cheap effects of the Langoliers only endears it to me, the way those early Godzilla movies still draw me in to watch them time after time.

The quality of the cast is mixed, but David Morse is the understated standout and Bronson Pinchot is on the mark as the unhinged passenger with daddy issues. Having said that, the other cast members perform ably and have their moments. My one lingering gripe with the movie is why doesn't someone wipe that obviously fake blood off Dinah's mouth? It's there throughout her most dramatic scenes! It's sooo distracting! But, despite it all, I continue to enjoy this little gem of a movie over and over.",1436313600,,808,4.690140845070423

Both Amazon, and the DVD case list the movie as having a 4:3 aspect ratio. When I first started the movie, it looked too ""square"", like
about a 4 to 3.8 ratio. That seemed wrong, so I set my player for 16:9 and it then looked correct. Watched on my computer, it fully filled
my monitors 1920 by 1080 field. To squeeze three hours of video onto a single-sided disc, takes serious compression. As a result, the
colors are a little muted, and the detail is soft. It's watchable but don't expect sharp crisp video.

The gifted British-born actor easily delivers her lines in a flawless American dialect, and comes through as always with a fine performance all around.  Because of Kates excellent acting ability, more screen time to further develop her character in this role would have significantly improved the film.

5679057,4,B00BW4S87U,"We like this movie. It's not fantastic, but it's a little longer and the quality is pretty good. Not a low budget movie, but not a multi-million dollar budget either. Having said this, it was engaging, fun to watch and kept on moving.

The story is very cool. Not King's usual horror scare, but rather a neat idea, with terrifying implications. It's a successful story told well. Acted well enough. You'll enjoy it.

5679060,5,B00BW4S87U,"A terrifying, edge of your seat thriller from the Master storyteller Stephen King, presents a red-eye flight from L.A. to Boston, that turns into your worst Nightmare. The beginning of the horror grabs your attention immediately, and keeps you there until the end, with nail-biting tension. Passengers have vanished, and the flight to no-where leaves the survivors confused, and frightened to death. Once they land the plane, the dread they feel as the clocks stop, is only the beginning of the horror. Stephen King prepares the viewers to witness the terrifying flight, like no other we have seen, and he does it to perfection. This scary, intense movie will make you think, long after you see the movie, and before you hop aboard your next airplane. Acting performance of the entire cast is Superb, and visual effects are mesmerizing. Chilling, thrilling, and entertaining from start to finish! Highly recommended.",1407888000,14,916,5.154362416107382

5679081,5,B00BW4S87U,"Despite its obvious minuses, such as the fact that this was made for TV and the effects show it. this is an interesting premise on the usual time traveling flicks. In fact, it reminds me of an old Twilight Zone episode of a missing flight that found it was time traveling and couldn't get back. This is different in the fact that the portal literally disintegrates anyone who is awake, leaving only those who are asleep alive to figure out the puzzle of what happened and why. On board are a pilot who is deadheading back to Boston to attend the funeral of his wife, a truly dysfunctional business man, a blind girl on her way to get an operation, a book-writer, a special forces agent on his way to assassinate someone, a school teacher, a factory worker to see his family, a young music student and a girl being sent to her aunt's house to live as she is to straighten up her messed life. It is the blind girl's screams that awaken the survivors to their odd situation, only to discover, as time goes by, that their situation is even odder by the fact that there seems to be no one around, other than themselves as everyone has disappeared, leaving behind a plethora of items behind. It is when they land the plane that everyone puts the clues together and realize they have somehow traveled into the past. The businessman is the one that puts a name to the danger that is creeping toward them as he goes into full blown paranoia about creatures that come from dark places to eat children who slack off in life, thanks to his abusive father who still haunts him and he believes that the passengers are somehow related to them as he runs off and tries to attack them with a gun he found then later, with a knife. It is later they discover time is indeed growing short as the soft chewing sounds they hear get close enough to reveal what actually happens to time when it has finished, and they must somehow escape before they too are eaten along with everything else.",1396483200,,1967,4.421487603305785

5679083,5,B00BW4S87U,"This movie is so funny and yet, very sad. The character that i enjoyed is Mr. Tomey, who is Bronson Pinchot. they couldn't have picked a better person for the part. He is so funny. I wonder what he is doing now? I hope his father isn't interrupting his career. (lol)",1394236800,,266,4.235294117647059

5679085,5,B00BW4S87U,"Stephen King does not let you down in this film - This movie is well written and well acted. The only downside is that it is low budget and very much a ""made for tv"" movie.

5679088,1,B00BW4S87U,"The worst acted, most poorly directed thing I've seen in a long time.  Nearly three hours of footage that will make you scream for a proper editor and weep for a few of the known actors who were not challenged to even care about their performances.

""Hey, there are these poorly animated things with circulating metal teeth coming to eat us.  Let us take a relaxed pose and spend about ten minutes gawking at them"".  Seriously, just watch the captain gawk...then assume a relaxed JC Penny catalog Dockers pose while he ponders this alleged ""horror"".

Or how about the ending sequence, when all but one survivor is frozen in their ""holding hands and jumping for joy pose"" despite the fact there is a blind kid dying on the plane they came in on?!?!  Hello?

Most of all, I feel sorry for Bronson Pinchot.  Seriously.  When he came out of the makeup trailer every day, I hope he consoled himself not by tearing paper but because he could bank some kind of paycheck.",1389657600,6,963,4.5523255813953485
