8213215,3,B000UGIJT8,"this hustle part I dance instructional video is not at par with the other ""dance vision"" videos. primarily, it runs only about 35 to 40 minutes compared with the other videos they usually release which is a minimum of 1 hour.  the first part of the instruction is mostly for the female dancer.  a lot of time was concentrated on the ""shadow"" giving different variations to it. i wish rolando pagan could have included other steps of the hustle rather than occupying the time for the ""shadow"" step.  i was expecting fancier steps especially coming from a company such as ""dance vision"" but i guess this is not one of them.  probably they included them in part 2 which is more expensive.  but i would still recommend this video to those who want to add a bit to their repertoire but don't expect too much, it will just whet your appetite.",1254873600,,836,4.509933774834437
8213216,4,B000UGIJT8,"This is a very good advanced level (silver) instructional tape on how to dance the American-style Bolero (a.k.a. bolero-rumba). This is a slow, romantic dance, and one of my favorites. While American-style dance is geared for social dancing, this tape, taught by a seven-time undefeated US Latin American dance champion, also provides instruction in styling, technique, etc. for those wishing to compete. As with any silver-level dance tape, you should have a sound grasp of the beginning-intermediate (Bronze level) Bolero before using this tape. Otherwise, you will probably wind up more frustrated than educated, as the instructor refers to some steps you won't know and he won't explain!

The producer of this Tape, DanceVision, is to my experience, the best producer ""out there"" of this type of video. They are the creators of the DVIDA Syllabus, used by instructors, etc., and this tape is part of a series that teaches the steps in that syllabus. HOWEVER, this tape is an older one, and IIRC, the steps it teaches does not reflect the steps that currently comprise the DVIDA silver-level Bolero. Brand-new, the tape cost $49.00; if it's not a typo, the listed price (at this writing, $129.00) is ludicrous, especially ""used."" One can get a VHS or DVD of the CURRENT syllabus for -- you guessed it -- $49.00, plus S&H.",1226880000,,1324,4.990950226244344
