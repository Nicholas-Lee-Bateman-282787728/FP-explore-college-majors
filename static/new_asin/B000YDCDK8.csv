  I agree with the general ideas of the film.  Education is good.  Crime is bad.  Family is good.",1288915200,,227,5.171428571428572
8231958,2,B000YDCDK8,The description was wrong when comparing this movie to Shottas.  It was not good.,1265932800,,81,4.785714285714286
8231959,5,B000YDCDK8,"I heard my father talk about this movie for quite some time and when I went home to NYC for a visit I went to Tony Ryan's record shop in the Bronx and purchased a copy. The amazing thing was while talking to the owner of the record shop Mykal Fax the young man who made the film was there. Mykal is a very humble young man with a tremendous amount of creativity.

Bashment is a story about the lives of Jamaican people living in Brooklyn, New York. This is an independent film so the quality will not be as professional as a regular movie,but it is good. The story is about four friends and the choices they make in life, some make good choices and others fall by the wayside. Filled with action, comedy & plenty dancehall tunes it is a great movie and I recommend it highly!!!!!",1199318400,,779,4.228187919463087
