8000067,3,B0000D91IK,"Ozu's film portrayals of Japanese families are often intimate, warm, and entertaining. The elders fight to keep traditions going strong while the youngsters are determined to fight for their rights as individuals. Here, in Late Autumn, a widow wants her adult daughter to marry and be happy, but the daughter is reluctant to leave her, fearing that her mother will become lonely. While she'd like to have her daughter marry, the daughter makes it very clear that she has no desire to be a wife. Unfortunately, the odds seem to be against her when her late father's friends take up the matchmaking cause and begin meddling in the lives of both mother and daughter.

Late Autumn suffers from a thickly overwrought plot. Two hours of dull and invasive meddling stagnates the story, making the film too much to bear. There's more depth and more compelling storylines to be found in Ozu's Tokyo Twilight, Early Summer, and Equinox Flower.",1448150400,,933,4.905063291139241
8000068,3,B0000D91IK,A very attractive 24 year old Japanese woman in 1960 is reluctant to get married because her very sweet widowed mother would be alone.  The scenes of the two women alone work best.  Three older male friends of the family meddle in the love lives of both women in ways that reveal these somewhat pompous Japanese men as buffoons and amateurs at matchmaking.  That's about all there is to it.,1360540800,2,390,4.542857142857143
8000069,4,B0000D91IK,"Late Ozu is like a late flowering of recurrent themes: the relation between the generations, parents and children, modernity versus tradition. Late Autumn is a traditional drama with people filmed head-on in conversation speaking straight to camera, as if the camera is one of the speakers. Many of the scenes are straight-ahead set-ups with well-framed static shots filmed at waist-high level. The colours are well chosen for balance between pale and rich palettes: earthy browns,turquoises, greens, shades of bluesy-grey and objects like pots and fire-extinguishers in red. It brought to mind Tati's techniques with the music. At the heart of the film is a mother-daughter relationship, a daughter ignoring marriage prospects to stay with her widowed mother.

Miwa's old-fashioned trio of friends want their late friend's widow (Akiko) and daughter(Ayoko) both to get married, as the daughter will not if it means leaving her mother alone. They have a secret crush on the mother who is still beautiful, and want to indulge their fancies. However two of them are married and one is widowed. The relationship between Ayoko and Akiko is tested,Ayoko is appalled by their plotting the remarriage of her mother. We get an idealised picture of the family,each person is harmonised with their surroundings. Instead we get little ripples of tension between mother and daughter and daughter and best friend (Yuriko). Yuriko sends shock waves of energy into the autumnal embers of the bumbling trio, speaking her mind, flashing her eyes, engaging directly with the camera, getting them to pay for the food and drinks.

Akiko is willing to sacrifice her own desires to see her daughter achieve happiness. Despite the element of fun, there is an underlying sadness and a resignation to the way things are. Someone says ""Life is simple"", but people are not and a prevailing lightness of touch utilises humour to open up underlying emotions. A late scene gives hope to Akiko when she is visited by Yuriko, asking if she can come and stay with her sometimes( perhaps as an alternative to her step-mother).A must for the Ozu collectors.",1303603200,3,2122,5.130057803468208
8000070,4,B0000D91IK,"Even though the comparison is obviously intentional, Yasujiro Ozu's 1960 film is really a variation on his classic 1949 father-daughter drama,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Late-Spring/dp/B000EOTWIS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Late Spring</a>. He goes further with this parallel by having the wondrous Setsuko Hara, who played the daughter in the original film, play the mother in this one, even though only eleven years have elapsed. Gone is the alternately feisty, flirtatious and petulant manner that marked her earlier performance as Noriko, and in its place is that remarkable stillness and quiet warmth in her portrayal of Akiko that marked the best of Hara's later performances. She was barely forty during filming, yet she carries the gravitas of her role with uncommon ease. What remains consistent between her two performances is the unearthly devotion which ties the characters intractably to the world in which they have grown accustomed.

Ozu wrote the quietly perceptive script with longtime collaborator Kogo Noda, and the filmmaker's trademark touches - the narrative ellipses, the lack of melodrama, the low camera angles - are all here in their emotionally resonant glory. This time, the character of Akiko has such an easy sisterly bond with her daughter Ayako that neither has an interest in dating or marriage. While Akiko's situation is more or less accepted by society, Ayako's single status is a point of consternation, especially for three friends of Akiko's late husband, all of whom express feelings of unrequited love for the unavailable Akiko. They are jointly intent on finding Ayako a suitable husband and find one in Goto, a young, well-mannered bachelor with a suitable career.  Akiko, however, demurs at the possibility of matrimony which leads the story through its inevitable paces.

Yko Tsukasa is pretty and affecting as Ayako, though honestly no match for the younger Hara in the earlier film. More of that uninhibited spirit is present in Mariko Okada, who plays Ayako's friend and colleague Yuriko. She has a terrifically abrasive and amusing confrontation with the trio of embarrassed matchmakers, and the result comes across as a bit of an imbalance to the viewer now since Yuriko's Westernized independence is more compelling than Ayako's more innate diffidence. Adding more to the comedic aspects of the story, Shin Saburi, Nabuo Nakamura and Ryuji Kita play the matchmaking trio almost like a Shakespearean comedy troupe. Interestingly, Ozu uses a decidedly Italianate-sounding score to underscore the action, a nice unpredictable touch. This well-preserved film is not as essential as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Late-Spring/dp/B000EOTWIS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Late Spring</a>, but it is a worthy addition to Ozu's filmography.",1183680000,6,2870,5.844868735083533
