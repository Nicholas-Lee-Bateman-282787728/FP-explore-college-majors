This is AWFUL and ludicrous. I watched it to the end because I had paid for it.  Alas, woe is me. It honestly doesn't even rate one star and it runs long for the little substance they had. It is like the whole town just got together and said we are gonna make a movie, so there!  And they did and they shouldn't have. I do have to say that the caves the mining operation was in looked interesting. *yawn*",1366156800,,552,4.247619047619048

Overall, it looked like a group of friends were sitting around one day and decided to make a monster movie by covering one of them with some moss and vines and calling it a creature.

Do yourself a big favor and pass on this.",1350604800,,357,4.3283582089552235
