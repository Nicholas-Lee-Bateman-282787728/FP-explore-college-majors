8252424,5,B0013NAMWY,"One of the best collections of Douglas Fairbanks movies out there, maybe not the best disc quality, but good enough for me.
My sister picked one of these collections up for 2 bucks at a dollar general and I paid 70 dollars for a copy- does that tell you enough?
Douglas Fairbanks is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1320883200,,314,4.833333333333333
8252425,5,B0013NAMWY,"One gets quite a few Fairbanks movies in this collection, all for a very low price. For me I am seeing films I never would have been able to watch except here. The film quality and music varies but over all it's pretty good. The version of Robin Hood is one of the best I've ever seen. Lots of action packed adventure here, I plan to find more of these collections of other performers if I can. As a silent film buff who can't afford remastered versions (if available), this sort of deal is just what I like. Great bargain.",1268438400,2,523,4.24
8252426,5,B0013NAMWY,this set is wonderful in that it has the Highlights of a great career and time.  The restoration is great (expect the music for the three musketeers.  A great wacth for action buffs or those studying film.,1259539200,2,205,4.513513513513513
8252427,3,B0013NAMWY,"This 3 Disc set includes 8 movies: Disc 1: Thief of Baghdad & Robin Hood; Disc 2: Mark of Zorro, The Iron Mask, Don Q-Son of Zorro; Disc 3: The Black Pirate, The Americano, and the Three Musketeers.  It is designed for all regions (not just region 1). All are silent and in black & white --the color gels from the originals, such as the sepia and blue in the Black Pirate are missing. The bonus features are still picture gallerys (movie posters and advertisements) and one radio broadcast of Zorro. The remasterings are pretty good, although it is important to keep in mind that these are all from the 1920s. -- Douglas Fairbanks set the mark for athleticism in adventure movies, establishing a high energy tone, humour, and penchant for doing his own stunts that guided the first talkie adventure films of the 1930s/1940s and created the context for adventure today from Indiana Jones to James Bond. The original films would have been shown with an organist or pianist providing the music in each theatre; the creators of this set do a fair to middling job of selecting appropriate mood music to go with the films. The Iron Mask and Mark of Zorro are right on; I finally muted it on Three Musketeers to keep the film from being ruined. The Robin Hood music is livable, but certainly not the glory that is Korngold's soundtrack for the Errol Flynn Robin Hood.",1233964800,15,1360,4.619834710743802
