3027758,5,B000YDMPBA,"I had heard nothing about this movie and only picked it up because the Great Debaters was out and the jacket read good. I'm sOOOO glad I decided to go ahead and get it. I HIGHLY recommend this movie. Im usually pretty good a predicting or figuring out who ""do it"" but this one threw me WAYYYY in the left field. When she walked in the room I totally expected to see Monica boy was I wrong. I rented it tonight but I will be purchasing it for my collection of black cinema.",1210896000,8,472,4.086021505376344
3027759,1,B000YDMPBA,"will someone please give the talented actress vivica fox a good role so she won't have to yawn her way through this tiresome, wannabe provocative message movie? leon, you're worth more. bill duke, you too. and how they got lou gossett, jr., a fabulous actor by any estimation, to sign on for this project is beyond me. cover was the most boring, uninvolving movie i've seen in a long time -- ever since eyes closed tight, sorry, eyes wide shut. a woman is happily married with a child. they move to another city. she has a friend in town who takes her to a great church (an excuse to put patti labelle in the movie, but she's always welcome). discovers that her husband is interested in more than just her. i guess the way wifey discovers her husband's extracurricular activities is supposed to be a plot twist, but it was just a straight line, and a stupid straight line at that. if all bill duke wanted to do was make a movie about how we should all ""be careful"" with our sexual partners, he could have done a public service announcement with more pizzazz. if you liked the movie ""trois"" (ugh!), you'll like this. if you rose above ""trois"", you'll give this flick the bum's rush -- as i wish i had.",1210723200,4,1200,4.40990990990991
3027760,5,B000YDMPBA,"This is an excellent movie and I strongly advise all women who are in relationships to see it.  I took a group of my friends to see it and we all walked out of the theater with our mouths wide open.  I live in Baltimore, MD where the HIV rate is exceptionally high amongst Africa Americans and the figures for heterosexual women are astounding.  Kudos to Bill Duke for bringing this to the screen.",1210723200,,397,4.337837837837838
3027761,5,B000YDMPBA,"I loved this movie.  There was drama, suspense, comedy and ""A Point!""  I will pass it on. Good Job!",1210550400,,99,4.157894736842105
3027762,4,B000YDMPBA,"I saw a little advertising in the paper about this movie. I saw Bill Duke directed it, and so I was willing to give it a chance. It was well worth the trip to the theater. I had no idea about the subject matter, and it's very provocative. It's very in your face once it all unravels, but I think it's well worth seeing and buying the DVD and passing it around to your female friends.",1209168000,4,383,4.052631578947368
3027763,5,B000YDMPBA,"I had the opportunity to attend a private screening for ""Cover"", along with a question and answer session at the end of the veiwing with director/producer Bill Duke, and actors Raz Adoti and Clayton Prince. It was an awesome experience meeting them, having one on one conversation with them and taking pictures with them. The movie was very well scripted and of course excellently directed. The suspense had a build-up that caused my heart to pound and my mind constantly working trying to figure out who did it and what was going to happen next. I enjoyed this movie so much that I saw it again a week later with friends and planned to go back again with another group of friends but was disappointed to find that it was no longer in the theaters. Needless to say, I am ordering my copy of the DVD now and recommend that everyone who has not seen it to get a copy. This is a must-see.",1206662400,,885,4.402439024390244
3027764,5,B000YDMPBA,"I got a chance to see this movie over a month ago at the AMC 25 on 42nd street in Times Square here in New York City.  All I will say is this movie was mind-blowing and EXTREMELY timely.  This movie is a perfect starting point for a much needed dialogue regarding a brooding DL issue. If you want to know more then buy the DVD in May; I promise it's worth it. This movie is definitely well acted, suspenseful, intense, filled with recognizable and acclaimed actors and poignant.  Bill Duke (the director) did a great job.  There were some editing clumsiness that got on my nerves at times, but the story and the acting made up for it.  Check it out!",1206230400,33,649,4.286885245901639

3027846,3,B000YDMPBA,"Even though I give this film three stars it is a little better than OK. The concept is on point. The acting is OK. The script needs more work.  It's worth a viewing, maybe not so much owning if it costs more than $8.00 to own.

I like the concept of the film. The title has a double meaning. It is an issue that all races deal with. However, this is from the African-American perspective thus being geared towards this audience. I don't want to give any spoilers or plot details in case whoever reads this has not heard of the film. At heart it deals with not accepting who you are, not loving yourself as you are and thus lying to others to hide your true self. Any relationship built on a foundation of lies is going to crumble or implode eventually. When that happens all of those who are pulled into that lie will be devastated.

The main problem I have with this movie is that it deals with such a sensitive subject, especially within the black community, that the time allotted for the film was not sufficient to tell the story. I am not saying the movie needed to be a single three-hour session but maybe it would have been better served as a miniseries. It gives a little more time for the story to develop. Allow for better character development which probably would have resulted in better acting overall.

Living so close to the Philly area, the main plot of the movie has elements in it that I've heard rumors of over the years. One of the phrases I've heard people talking about before the movie even came so it kind of jarred me a little. This phrase may ring a bell with some or you can google it and see what pops up but it is a big clue, ""You have a little dust in your eye. I can blow it out for you.""

One last thing I will mention. The lead male character, the husband, made a major punk move near the end of the movie. It is something a lot of people try and end up doing once they are caught. It made me not like him at all. I had some compassion for him because he did struggle even through his selfishness but he at least seemed redeeming. When he tried to put others on blast because he'd been caught that was really weak of him. Not that these other people shouldn't be telling the truth but he wanted to tell their secrets so he would not go down alone. Proving that he was plain selfish in my opinion.",1424563200,,2329,4.201342281879195

3027968,1,B000YDMPBA,"No disrespect to anyone, but I was fooled by the high ratings.  This movie is awful - The editing, the cast, the acting, the writing, and pretty much everything else that is involved when making a movie.

The editing is extremely poor and will distract you from the scenes.  I thought Vivica Fox's character was not needed at all in this movie, and they didn't do her any favors with the writing - I wouldn't have been able to do a good job acting with this material, either.

The ending is predictable, I found myself not caring about anyone in the movie, and I didn't appreciate the tone (my opinion) that I was somehow supposed to feel sympathy for the main character's husband.  If you are extremely bored, fast forward to every scene with Leon's character - those scenes are only entertaining due to the unintentional comedy.

With that said, I thought the main character (the wife) could possibly have been a good actress, in another movie.  I actually enjoy ""good, bad movies"" - Movies so bad that they end up being good, or at least a guilty pleasure.

3027976,5,B000YDMPBA,"Amazing movie.  Best approached with low, or better yet, no, expectations.
I saw it not knowing what it was about and not expecting much (cheesy 80s intro inkblot helped that...)
The sexual tension and mystery drew me in and I was hooked from there.
It really blew my mind and got me to thinking about a lot of important things.

This is an issues film, it treats a very modern and real epidemic.
It's not meant to be, nor does it ever feel like, an escapist piece of entertainment.

Not surprisingly, many critics bash the film.
But, that's easy to understand in proper context: America is only ~13% african-american and this movie is heavily entrenched in african-american culture.
Most movie critis would not be able to realate to the characters or context very well, many critics I've read felt lots of the moments felt fake or contrived.
I'll say that most characters expose many views, and they are totally realistic and human.
And in a way, that's why it's understandable the critics smashed this one - its not your standard movie script, its much more real, an qute a bit less predictable.

No movie is perfect, and this one does have a few very short weak points, like Vivica's rather fake/corny-souding ""chill it out, I'm still down for hookin my sista up"", but there are many many very powerful and strong points as well, notably when the preacher visits Mrs Maas or when Grandpa Maas bails out his son.

This movie is one the most well done I have ever seen in terms of the director being able to get you to think about underlying issues.  Even though the characters and plot are pretty down-to-earth, I think the psycological/sociological/moral issues at play are on such a high level that many viewers won't get it fully.  I don't know the director, but I can tell he is a very intellegent, well-rounded, insightful artist and did an incredible job of conveying his intended meaning.",1248825600,,1897,4.695783132530121

3027980,2,B000YDMPBA,"Sadly, truthfully, this film deserves no four star reviews; I recommend you ignore them all if seriously considering seeing this project. It's indeed packed with familiar faces: Vivica Foxx, Leon, Lou Gossett, Jr, Roger G. Smith (the film's brightest shining star), Aunjanue Ellis, Paula Jai Parker, Clifton Davis, even Pattie Labelle. However, the direction - by Bill Duke - leaves much to be desired. Duke knows better; he should be ashamed of himself. He slums his way through this thing, knowing it would never hit the mainstream, knowing it was destined to lazily go straight to DVD, knowing its intended audience is the not-too-selective church crowd. Overall, the acting was really bad: the male lead simply can't act and his utter absence of charisma makes him interesting to watch simply for that reason (I pray I never see him in anything else ever again). Roger G. Smith and Leon best bring their roles to life, saving themselves (along with Ellis, I guess) from being lumped-in with all the other actors who are either over-the-top (Parker and Foxx), underplayed and forgettable (Gossett) or simply too bad to mention (the kid who plays the couple's daughter - sorry - and the disturbed wife of Leon's character). And it's all too bad, because the subject matter is an important and timely one, but it's handled so recklessly.

My family and I found ourselves routinely rewinding and laughing at spots that clearly weren't intended to be humorous. And the edits were atrocious - sloppily thrown together in the most heavy-handed manner. The poor edits, lazy lighting, sorry sound and myopic cinematography would all be forgivable if the film, in the end, somehow came together as whole - but no. In the end, Cover comes off as an insult to gay men (by the way, didn't the whole ""three-finger-snaps"" thing die-out after the In Living Color ""Men of Film"" sketches aired on TV almost two decades ago?), the church, Christians in general, wives, the city of Philly, Bill Duke, and most of the actors involved.

This movie essentially suffers from what I term ""Tyler Perry Syndrome"" - which describes an intrinsic hunger in Christians and people of color so desperate to see their stories, their lives and experiences, nuanced, and with a verisimilitude to which they can relate, celebrate and call their own -- that they are willing to lower their cinematic standards - or downright dismiss them altogether -- and settle for and embrace films that are in many regards inferior, and thus offensive.",1242777600,13,2505,4.961904761904762

3027983,5,B000YDMPBA,"I guarantee once you see this movie you will have a lot to talk about.  It dealt with a topic that although it is sensitive it needs to be addressed.
It has a all star cast, which makes me surprised it didn't make it to more cinemas, but I guess there are two reasons.  First it is a all African American cast and secondly the subject matter.

It let's you know that the DL is alive and thriving in every city in this country.  We can no longer be afraid to discuss men on the down low, because by not discussing it we are setting ourselves up for a death sentence.  The DL doesn't have a particular look, class or mannerism.  You can't assume because a brotha is married that he's not tipping on the other side and if you suspect he's cheating don't assume its with a woman.

The sad thing is the African American community still refuses to deal with it, which is why African American women are diagnosed as HIV positive at an alarming rate.  I highly recommend this movie, if for no other reason than to open the dialog and hopefully open the eyes of those who still believe it can't happen to them.  This is a very good movie and a definite wake up call.  The boogieman is out there and he's not easy to recognize.

3027994,3,B000YDMPBA,"I won't go overboard with the praises, but I would have to say that this movie was way better than I thought it would be. It deals with a lot of subjects that the black community is afraid or unwilling to discuss. Bill Duke (The Director) brings these subjects to the light and puts it right in your face. I do agree that the murder plot within this story was kind of distracting at times, but it all came together eventually, and it ultimately makes you re-think about the life you've led and who your sexual partners are. It sheds light on HIV and being tested, and it also exposes the ""DL"" lifestyle with black men who are secretly homosexual men who lead perfectly ""normal"" married hetrosexual lives in public, but they also secretly sleep with men. This movie also reveals that the reason for this behavior is that they are really afraid to be exposed because of the ridicule and persecution that they face from not only the community, but the church itself as well. This is definitely a topic that nobody wanted to touch, so I applaude Bill Duke for having the courage to go there. Let me just say that this movie is told in flashback fashion, so you must be paying close attention. Plus, this movie has an all star cast basically and you'll know what I mean if you watch a lot of black Cinema. There's Vivica A. Fox, Louis Gossest Jr., Clifton Davis (from Amen), Aunjanue Ellis, Paula Jai Parker and Leon (who I forgot was actually capable of real acting instead of just doing more biographies of singers and singing groups). This movie starts off with a woman named Valerie Maas being interrogated in the police station about a murder. The thing is, I think they mislead you intentionally into thinking the murder is her own husband, but in reality it's one of her husband's lover who's actually been murdered. I do have to get one gripe off my chest though, I do find it misleading that Dutch had been secretly sleeping with Ryan Chambers and his friend Kevin obviously (from my understanding of the movie anyway) but after he's caught by his wife Valerie she asks him if he used protection, and he admits not all the time or something to that effect. O.K! We find out that Ryan is HIV positive by his own admission, but somehow, after Dutch and Valerie both get tested the test come back negative. I don't see that was possible if he was messing around with Ryan too, and he obviously was by what they showed us. I had to get that out because it really bothered me that he was caught messing with an HIV positive man, but neither him or his wife was infected...I DON'T BUY THAT! However, with that said, it was a good movie. I wish I knew what happend to Monica (Kevin's wife) after her breakdown because they don't show her again.",1231200000,,2741,4.473053892215569

3028003,4,B000YDMPBA,"Cover starts with Valerie Maas (Aujanue Ellis) being held for the murder of popular R&B singer Ryan Chambers (Leon).  She contests that she is innocent in the murder but an over-zealous D.A (Clifton Davis) is trying to seek her conviction to help boost his credibility in an upcoming election. She begins to tell her story through a series of flashbacks during the interregation to Detective Hick (Lou Gossett Jr.).

Valerie is a 'happily' married woman from ATL who gives up her career as a photographer and moves to Philly with her daughter when her psychiatrist husband Dutch (Raz Adoti) takes a higher paying job there thanks to college friends Kevin and Monica Wilson (Roger Smith and Paula Jai Parker).  Hard times abound when Dutch is denied the salary that was initially promised to him by Monica due to funding issues at the hospital, and it seems that he is struggling with this as head of the family through pillow talk and his reluctancy to join a local church suggested to them by Valerie's good friend Zahara (Vivica Fox).  Valerie is more interested in Dutch's relationship with Monica, who is very seductive and charismatic with Dutch with every encounter.  She is only side-tracked by Ryan Chambers, who is equally seductive and charismatic with her during the Wilson's anniversary party, but questions Dutch and Monica's involvement even more once she finds a condom in Dutch's wallet one afternoon.  Zahara, who vows to stand by her friend, does some detective work and presents Valerie with photos that suggest Dutch is having an affair with Monica.  Valerie, who is livid, confronts Dutch, who comes up with every logical explanation in the book to calm her suspicions in a heated argument.  Valerie however is still not convinced.  Dutch shows up unexpectantly at Ryan's home where Valerie is doing a photo shoot for him and catches the two in compromising positions, accusing her of trying to get back at him.  It isn't until the pariah of Valerie and Zahara's womens church group Charlotte gives Valerie a key to a hotel room and insists that she needs to know the truth that Valerie discovers Dutch is having an affair, and it's not with Monica, but with another man.  Suddenly, many secrets are revealed and Valerie must make a powerful decision concerning her marriage.

PROS: The script was believable because of the top-notch notable African American cast who brought these characters to life.  We all have or know of a friend like Zahara, for example--crazy as all get out and down-to-Earth, willing to have your back when need be.  Or the older woman at church like Sister Honeycomb who means well, but still comes off ignorant and out of touch.  I was impressed with Raz Adoti, someone who I'm only used to seeing in action flicks such as Resident Evil and Doom.  There were no raunchy sex scenes between men and you got the point during the big reveal scene, which I respected.  Valerie's reactions that followed upon finding out her husband's infidelity were so human you might forget that Aujanue Ellis was only acting.

CONS:

1. The movie was very predictable and foolish at times despite the twists and turns that were presented to throw the viewer off.  It's so obvious who Dutch is not having an affair with as obvious as they try to make it.  The confrontation scene between Valerie and Monica was foolish, even if it was used to show how her prints got on the gun.  Dutch's father bailing him out of jail and then beating him up on the way out was another idiotic scene.  Valerie telling everyone at the womens group meeting in the church about her husband's infidelity with another man--of all people to tell--is poor, and I just couldn't see a woman scorned in such a way confiding something like that with so many people not close to her.  The babysitter always standing at the front door during Valerie's arrival home everytime was laughable; at first, you might suspect that she is a housekeeper or something.  The spectacle of a rant Kevin makes on the streets of Philly to Dutch once the word is out about the extent of his infidelity was more comedy.

2. I think the movie would've been just as good without the cheesy murder plot.  It should've definitely been left out because it wasn't needed.  There was such a gap in between after Valerie found out about Dutch's double life and the murder that I just felt this was something thrown in to spice up the script and not much thought was really given to it.  You didn't get to see how she got caught, how her family was affected...and how is it that the murder investigation focuses on her when she was one of three people who had access to the gun in the movie?

3. While I appreciate the intellectual and ignorant conversation that was brought up involving homosexuality, the 'DL' phenomena, HIV/AIDS, and the Black church, there were still many stereotypes presented in the film.  Zahara's friend Greg was the stereotypical flamboyant and emotionally sensitive gay man.  There was also this crazy scene in the film that is repeated at the end to bring a realization/conclusion to the viewer where a married man hits on Greg and Dutch by offering to blow an eyelash out of their eye.  I died of laughter--is this supposed to be the tell-tell sign that a man is on the 'DL'?

I heard so many people talking about this movie over the Summer and refused to take a chance and pay the 20-something dollars it was initially on sale for, and could never seem to rent it because it was never available, but finally broke when I saw it went on sale for only $7.99 a week ago.  It is definitely a decent made-for-DVD Black movie I must admit, entertaining with a few flaws, but touches on a very strong subject within the African American community.

3028011,2,B000YDMPBA,"**1/2

Bill Duke`s ""Cover"" is like an urbanized, African-American version of ""Brokeback Mountain"" - only this time told from the viewpoint of the initially clueless spouse rather than the two male lovers.  Aunjanue Ellis plays a deeply religious woman whose life and marriage fall apart when she discovers that her husband (Razaaq Adoti) is actually a closeted homosexual.  This leads to a great deal of emotional trauma for both the wife and the husband - as well  as to a patently absurd and wholly unnecessary murder subplot that's used to frame the story.

There's no question that this is a well-meaning and well-intentioned film, but its attempt to deal honestly with a serious social issue all too often falls victim to slickery and overwrought melodramatics.  Many a scene will have you rolling your eyes in incredulity and disbelief, even while conceding that some of the points the movie is making are indeed insightful and valid.  And, commendably, the movie does give a fair hearing to each of its genuinely torn and conflicted characters.  But an overall air of amateurishness - both in the performances (even from such acting stalwarts as Louis Gossett Jr.  and ""Amen""'s Clifton Davis) and in the direction - keeps it from having the impact it clearly wishes to have.

It really threw me for a loop Vivica fox doesn't have a big role in the movie, but the other names do an excellent job. This movie addresses issues in our community and I hope this opens discussions and dialogue on this topic",1211846400,,314,4.338983050847458

3028023,3,B000YDMPBA,"A few years ago, when the original teaser clip named INVISIBLE was posted on the internet, I assumed that it was going to be yet another poke at gay men (pun intended) to scare Black Women to believe that their men were secretly bisexual and sprending HIV to their female partners. Even though I wish that the overall topic/theme had more balance, I have to admit that the final version of COVER was better than I anticipated.  Since the film was written by a straight man FOR straight women, I didn't expect them to be sensitive to issues within the bisexual community. I do think that the DVD should have included a few bonus clips with HIV/AIDS Prevention Education information as well as some standard verbage around HIV testing. It is one thing to entertain audiences, but another to educate them along the way. Lastly, linking murder, and HIV infection to cheating, regardless of what sex the other person, is something that I hope future film makers think about in a different way.",1211587200,6,988,4.710982658959537

It was an awesome experience meeting them, having one on one conversation with them and taking pictures with them. The movie was very well scripted and of course excellently directed. The suspense had a build-up that caused my heart to pound and my mind constantly working trying to figure out who did it and what was going to happen next. I enjoyed this movie so much that I saw it again a week later with friends and planned to go back again with another group of friends but was disappointed to find that it was no longer in the theaters. Needless to say, I am ordering my copy of the DVD now and recommend that everyone who has not seen it to get a copy. This is a must-see.",1206662400,,885,4.402439024390244

All I will say is this movie was mind-blowing and EXTREMELY timely.  This movie is a perfect starting point for a much needed dialogue regarding a brooding DL issue. If you want to know more then buy the DVD in May; I promise it's worth it. This movie is definitely well acted, suspenseful, intense, filled with recognizable and acclaimed actors and poignant.  Bill Duke (the director) did a great job.  There were some editing clumsiness that got on my nerves at times, but the story and the acting made up for it.

3262343,3,B000YDMPBA,"Even though I give this film three stars it is a little better than OK. The concept is on point. The acting is OK. The script needs more work.  It's worth a viewing, maybe not so much owning if it costs more than $8.00 to own.

I like the concept of the film. The title has a double meaning. It is an issue that all races deal with. However, this is from the African-American perspective thus being geared towards this audience. I don't want to give any spoilers or plot details in case whoever reads this has not heard of the film. At heart it deals with not accepting who you are, not loving yourself as you are and thus lying to others to hide your true self. Any relationship built on a foundation of lies is going to crumble or implode eventually. When that happens all of those who are pulled into that lie will be devastated.

The main problem I have with this movie is that it deals with such a sensitive subject, especially within the black community, that the time allotted for the film was not sufficient to tell the story. I am not saying the movie needed to be a single three-hour session but maybe it would have been better served as a miniseries. It gives a little more time for the story to develop. Allow for better character development which probably would have resulted in better acting overall.

Living so close to the Philly area, the main plot of the movie has elements in it that I've heard rumors of over the years. One of the phrases I've heard people talking about before the movie even came so it kind of jarred me a little. This phrase may ring a bell with some or you can google it and see what pops up but it is a big clue, ""You have a little dust in your eye. I can blow it out for you.""

One last thing I will mention. The lead male character, the husband, made a major punk move near the end of the movie. It is something a lot of people try and end up doing once they are caught. It made me not like him at all. I had some compassion for him because he did struggle even through his selfishness but he at least seemed redeeming. When he tried to put others on blast because he'd been caught that was really weak of him. Not that these other people shouldn't be telling the truth but he wanted to tell their secrets so he would not go down alone. Proving that he was plain selfish in my opinion.",1424563200,,2329,4.201342281879195

3262465,1,B000YDMPBA,"No disrespect to anyone, but I was fooled by the high ratings.  This movie is awful - The editing, the cast, the acting, the writing, and pretty much everything else that is involved when making a movie.

The editing is extremely poor and will distract you from the scenes.  I thought Vivica Fox's character was not needed at all in this movie, and they didn't do her any favors with the writing - I wouldn't have been able to do a good job acting with this material, either.

The ending is predictable, I found myself not caring about anyone in the movie, and I didn't appreciate the tone (my opinion) that I was somehow supposed to feel sympathy for the main character's husband.  If you are extremely bored, fast forward to every scene with Leon's character - those scenes are only entertaining due to the unintentional comedy.

With that said, I thought the main character (the wife) could possibly have been a good actress, in another movie.  I actually enjoy ""good, bad movies"" - Movies so bad that they end up being good, or at least a guilty pleasure.

3262473,5,B000YDMPBA,"Amazing movie.  Best approached with low, or better yet, no, expectations.
I saw it not knowing what it was about and not expecting much (cheesy 80s intro inkblot helped that...)
The sexual tension and mystery drew me in and I was hooked from there.
It really blew my mind and got me to thinking about a lot of important things.

This is an issues film, it treats a very modern and real epidemic.
It's not meant to be, nor does it ever feel like, an escapist piece of entertainment.

Not surprisingly, many critics bash the film.
But, that's easy to understand in proper context: America is only ~13% african-american and this movie is heavily entrenched in african-american culture.
Most movie critis would not be able to realate to the characters or context very well, many critics I've read felt lots of the moments felt fake or contrived.
I'll say that most characters expose many views, and they are totally realistic and human.
And in a way, that's why it's understandable the critics smashed this one - its not your standard movie script, its much more real, an qute a bit less predictable.

No movie is perfect, and this one does have a few very short weak points, like Vivica's rather fake/corny-souding ""chill it out, I'm still down for hookin my sista up"", but there are many many very powerful and strong points as well, notably when the preacher visits Mrs Maas or when Grandpa Maas bails out his son.

This movie is one the most well done I have ever seen in terms of the director being able to get you to think about underlying issues.  Even though the characters and plot are pretty down-to-earth, I think the psycological/sociological/moral issues at play are on such a high level that many viewers won't get it fully.  I don't know the director, but I can tell he is a very intellegent, well-rounded, insightful artist and did an incredible job of conveying his intended meaning.",1248825600,,1897,4.695783132530121

3262477,2,B000YDMPBA,"Sadly, truthfully, this film deserves no four star reviews; I recommend you ignore them all if seriously considering seeing this project. It's indeed packed with familiar faces: Vivica Foxx, Leon, Lou Gossett, Jr, Roger G. Smith (the film's brightest shining star), Aunjanue Ellis, Paula Jai Parker, Clifton Davis, even Pattie Labelle. However, the direction - by Bill Duke - leaves much to be desired. Duke knows better; he should be ashamed of himself. He slums his way through this thing, knowing it would never hit the mainstream, knowing it was destined to lazily go straight to DVD, knowing its intended audience is the not-too-selective church crowd. Overall, the acting was really bad: the male lead simply can't act and his utter absence of charisma makes him interesting to watch simply for that reason (I pray I never see him in anything else ever again). Roger G. Smith and Leon best bring their roles to life, saving themselves (along with Ellis, I guess) from being lumped-in with all the other actors who are either over-the-top (Parker and Foxx), underplayed and forgettable (Gossett) or simply too bad to mention (the kid who plays the couple's daughter - sorry - and the disturbed wife of Leon's character). And it's all too bad, because the subject matter is an important and timely one, but it's handled so recklessly.

My family and I found ourselves routinely rewinding and laughing at spots that clearly weren't intended to be humorous. And the edits were atrocious - sloppily thrown together in the most heavy-handed manner. The poor edits, lazy lighting, sorry sound and myopic cinematography would all be forgivable if the film, in the end, somehow came together as whole - but no. In the end, Cover comes off as an insult to gay men (by the way, didn't the whole ""three-finger-snaps"" thing die-out after the In Living Color ""Men of Film"" sketches aired on TV almost two decades ago?), the church, Christians in general, wives, the city of Philly, Bill Duke, and most of the actors involved.

This movie essentially suffers from what I term ""Tyler Perry Syndrome"" - which describes an intrinsic hunger in Christians and people of color so desperate to see their stories, their lives and experiences, nuanced, and with a verisimilitude to which they can relate, celebrate and call their own -- that they are willing to lower their cinematic standards - or downright dismiss them altogether -- and settle for and embrace films that are in many regards inferior, and thus offensive.",1242777600,13,2505,4.961904761904762

3262480,5,B000YDMPBA,"I guarantee once you see this movie you will have a lot to talk about.  It dealt with a topic that although it is sensitive it needs to be addressed.
It has a all star cast, which makes me surprised it didn't make it to more cinemas, but I guess there are two reasons.  First it is a all African American cast and secondly the subject matter.

It let's you know that the DL is alive and thriving in every city in this country.  We can no longer be afraid to discuss men on the down low, because by not discussing it we are setting ourselves up for a death sentence.  The DL doesn't have a particular look, class or mannerism.  You can't assume because a brotha is married that he's not tipping on the other side and if you suspect he's cheating don't assume its with a woman.

The sad thing is the African American community still refuses to deal with it, which is why African American women are diagnosed as HIV positive at an alarming rate.  I highly recommend this movie, if for no other reason than to open the dialog and hopefully open the eyes of those who still believe it can't happen to them.  This is a very good movie and a definite wake up call.  The boogieman is out there and he's not easy to recognize.

3262491,3,B000YDMPBA,"I won't go overboard with the praises, but I would have to say that this movie was way better than I thought it would be. It deals with a lot of subjects that the black community is afraid or unwilling to discuss. Bill Duke (The Director) brings these subjects to the light and puts it right in your face. I do agree that the murder plot within this story was kind of distracting at times, but it all came together eventually, and it ultimately makes you re-think about the life you've led and who your sexual partners are. It sheds light on HIV and being tested, and it also exposes the ""DL"" lifestyle with black men who are secretly homosexual men who lead perfectly ""normal"" married hetrosexual lives in public, but they also secretly sleep with men. This movie also reveals that the reason for this behavior is that they are really afraid to be exposed because of the ridicule and persecution that they face from not only the community, but the church itself as well. This is definitely a topic that nobody wanted to touch, so I applaude Bill Duke for having the courage to go there. Let me just say that this movie is told in flashback fashion, so you must be paying close attention. Plus, this movie has an all star cast basically and you'll know what I mean if you watch a lot of black Cinema. There's Vivica A. Fox, Louis Gossest Jr., Clifton Davis (from Amen), Aunjanue Ellis, Paula Jai Parker and Leon (who I forgot was actually capable of real acting instead of just doing more biographies of singers and singing groups). This movie starts off with a woman named Valerie Maas being interrogated in the police station about a murder. The thing is, I think they mislead you intentionally into thinking the murder is her own husband, but in reality it's one of her husband's lover who's actually been murdered. I do have to get one gripe off my chest though, I do find it misleading that Dutch had been secretly sleeping with Ryan Chambers and his friend Kevin obviously (from my understanding of the movie anyway) but after he's caught by his wife Valerie she asks him if he used protection, and he admits not all the time or something to that effect. O.K! We find out that Ryan is HIV positive by his own admission, but somehow, after Dutch and Valerie both get tested the test come back negative. I don't see that was possible if he was messing around with Ryan too, and he obviously was by what they showed us. I had to get that out because it really bothered me that he was caught messing with an HIV positive man, but neither him or his wife was infected...I DON'T BUY THAT! However, with that said, it was a good movie. I wish I knew what happend to Monica (Kevin's wife) after her breakdown because they don't show her again.",1231200000,,2741,4.473053892215569

3262500,4,B000YDMPBA,"Cover starts with Valerie Maas (Aujanue Ellis) being held for the murder of popular R&B singer Ryan Chambers (Leon).  She contests that she is innocent in the murder but an over-zealous D.A (Clifton Davis) is trying to seek her conviction to help boost his credibility in an upcoming election. She begins to tell her story through a series of flashbacks during the interregation to Detective Hick (Lou Gossett Jr.).

Valerie is a 'happily' married woman from ATL who gives up her career as a photographer and moves to Philly with her daughter when her psychiatrist husband Dutch (Raz Adoti) takes a higher paying job there thanks to college friends Kevin and Monica Wilson (Roger Smith and Paula Jai Parker).  Hard times abound when Dutch is denied the salary that was initially promised to him by Monica due to funding issues at the hospital, and it seems that he is struggling with this as head of the family through pillow talk and his reluctancy to join a local church suggested to them by Valerie's good friend Zahara (Vivica Fox).  Valerie is more interested in Dutch's relationship with Monica, who is very seductive and charismatic with Dutch with every encounter.  She is only side-tracked by Ryan Chambers, who is equally seductive and charismatic with her during the Wilson's anniversary party, but questions Dutch and Monica's involvement even more once she finds a condom in Dutch's wallet one afternoon.  Zahara, who vows to stand by her friend, does some detective work and presents Valerie with photos that suggest Dutch is having an affair with Monica.  Valerie, who is livid, confronts Dutch, who comes up with every logical explanation in the book to calm her suspicions in a heated argument.  Valerie however is still not convinced.  Dutch shows up unexpectantly at Ryan's home where Valerie is doing a photo shoot for him and catches the two in compromising positions, accusing her of trying to get back at him.  It isn't until the pariah of Valerie and Zahara's womens church group Charlotte gives Valerie a key to a hotel room and insists that she needs to know the truth that Valerie discovers Dutch is having an affair, and it's not with Monica, but with another man.  Suddenly, many secrets are revealed and Valerie must make a powerful decision concerning her marriage.

PROS: The script was believable because of the top-notch notable African American cast who brought these characters to life.  We all have or know of a friend like Zahara, for example--crazy as all get out and down-to-Earth, willing to have your back when need be.  Or the older woman at church like Sister Honeycomb who means well, but still comes off ignorant and out of touch.  I was impressed with Raz Adoti, someone who I'm only used to seeing in action flicks such as Resident Evil and Doom.  There were no raunchy sex scenes between men and you got the point during the big reveal scene, which I respected.  Valerie's reactions that followed upon finding out her husband's infidelity were so human you might forget that Aujanue Ellis was only acting.

CONS:

1. The movie was very predictable and foolish at times despite the twists and turns that were presented to throw the viewer off.  It's so obvious who Dutch is not having an affair with as obvious as they try to make it.  The confrontation scene between Valerie and Monica was foolish, even if it was used to show how her prints got on the gun.  Dutch's father bailing him out of jail and then beating him up on the way out was another idiotic scene.  Valerie telling everyone at the womens group meeting in the church about her husband's infidelity with another man--of all people to tell--is poor, and I just couldn't see a woman scorned in such a way confiding something like that with so many people not close to her.  The babysitter always standing at the front door during Valerie's arrival home everytime was laughable; at first, you might suspect that she is a housekeeper or something.  The spectacle of a rant Kevin makes on the streets of Philly to Dutch once the word is out about the extent of his infidelity was more comedy.

2. I think the movie would've been just as good without the cheesy murder plot.  It should've definitely been left out because it wasn't needed.  There was such a gap in between after Valerie found out about Dutch's double life and the murder that I just felt this was something thrown in to spice up the script and not much thought was really given to it.  You didn't get to see how she got caught, how her family was affected...and how is it that the murder investigation focuses on her when she was one of three people who had access to the gun in the movie?

3. While I appreciate the intellectual and ignorant conversation that was brought up involving homosexuality, the 'DL' phenomena, HIV/AIDS, and the Black church, there were still many stereotypes presented in the film.  Zahara's friend Greg was the stereotypical flamboyant and emotionally sensitive gay man.  There was also this crazy scene in the film that is repeated at the end to bring a realization/conclusion to the viewer where a married man hits on Greg and Dutch by offering to blow an eyelash out of their eye.  I died of laughter--is this supposed to be the tell-tell sign that a man is on the 'DL'?

I heard so many people talking about this movie over the Summer and refused to take a chance and pay the 20-something dollars it was initially on sale for, and could never seem to rent it because it was never available, but finally broke when I saw it went on sale for only $7.99 a week ago.  It is definitely a decent made-for-DVD Black movie I must admit, entertaining with a few flaws, but touches on a very strong subject within the African American community.

Bill Duke`s ""Cover"" is like an urbanized, African-American version of ""Brokeback Mountain"" - only this time told from the viewpoint of the initially clueless spouse rather than the two male lovers.  Aunjanue Ellis plays a deeply religious woman whose life and marriage fall apart when she discovers that her husband (Razaaq Adoti) is actually a closeted homosexual.  This leads to a great deal of emotional trauma for both the wife and the husband - as well  as to a patently absurd and wholly unnecessary murder subplot that's used to frame the story.

There's no question that this is a well-meaning and well-intentioned film, but its attempt to deal honestly with a serious social issue all too often falls victim to slickery and overwrought melodramatics.  Many a scene will have you rolling your eyes in incredulity and disbelief, even while conceding that some of the points the movie is making are indeed insightful and valid.  And, commendably, the movie does give a fair hearing to each of its genuinely torn and conflicted characters.  But an overall air of amateurishness - both in the performances (even from such acting stalwarts as Louis Gossett Jr.  and ""Amen""'s Clifton Davis) and in the direction - keeps it from having the impact it clearly wishes to have.

3262513,5,B000YDMPBA,"This was a very good movie, excellent storyline. It is a shame this movie didn't make it to the theater, if it did I had never heard about it. I would say well worth the buy.",1214265600,,174,3.861111111111111
3262514,4,B000YDMPBA,"This was a great movie! The subject matter is definitely one that needs to be addressed. I emailed all my close friends/email buddies after finding the movies site and told them to check it out. So many times we look past the issues that affect us the most. Women, be careful! Men, be honest! Times have changed and we have come to far. If we don't love ourselves, no one else will.

Ms. Ellis was great in this movie. I wish she'd get more offers as she has talent. Lou Gossett was good as usual. Mr. Duke did a good job in my opinion. This is definitely a movie to watch.",1213920000,,573,4.162162162162162

3262516,5,B000YDMPBA,Movie has a sleeper of what women who do not know what there spouses or significant others are doing behind there back but at the same time want their cake and eat it too. A must see film for young people and people who are in a committed relationship.,1212969600,,252,4.163265306122449
3262517,5,B000YDMPBA,"I figured anything with Bill Duke's name on it had to be good and I was correct. Still, I didn't know what to expect when I rented 'Cover'. But now I do-- absolutely superb! Kudo's to Bill and the rest of the cast. You've made a high quality film that informs, enlightens and breaks your heart...really a great piece of work...I'm looking forward to more.",1212883200,16,355,4.476923076923077
3262518,5,B000YDMPBA,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Surprising twists throughout the movie. It really threw me for a loop Vivica fox doesn't have a big role in the movie, but the other names do an excellent job. This movie addresses issues in our community and I hope this opens discussions and dialogue on this topic",1211846400,,314,4.338983050847458
3262519,5,B000YDMPBA,I am surprise that not to many are aware of this movie. Very informative and surprise twist.  Very good movie.,1211846400,2,110,4.5
3262520,3,B000YDMPBA,"A few years ago, when the original teaser clip named INVISIBLE was posted on the internet, I assumed that it was going to be yet another poke at gay men (pun intended) to scare Black Women to believe that their men were secretly bisexual and sprending HIV to their female partners. Even though I wish that the overall topic/theme had more balance, I have to admit that the final version of COVER was better than I anticipated.  Since the film was written by a straight man FOR straight women, I didn't expect them to be sensitive to issues within the bisexual community. I do think that the DVD should have included a few bonus clips with HIV/AIDS Prevention Education information as well as some standard verbage around HIV testing. It is one thing to entertain audiences, but another to educate them along the way. Lastly, linking murder, and HIV infection to cheating, regardless of what sex the other person, is something that I hope future film makers think about in a different way.",1211587200,6,988,4.710982658959537
3262521,5,B000YDMPBA,This is a must see movie for all the African American ladies.  This movie is off the hookup.  See for yourself how deceitful our brothers are in admitting their sexuality.  It's sad but a lot of our macho brothers are on the DL.,1211155200,,228,4.255813953488372
8232354,4,B000YDMPBA,"When I bought this movie I expected a run of the mill thriller--something like Fatal Attraction or Body of Evidence. Instead I got a murder mystery that metastasized into the topic of homosexuality which in turn force-fed me through a sort of surprise shock ala Crying Game. No, I did not like the subject matter nor did I like how I was tricked into confronting the lead actor's duplicity towards his wife. Yuck!

Despite my disgust of the topic I give the film's originality a marginal thumbs up. The direction and pacing are unique and the African American church scenes are solid. It reminded me of my First Baptist Church in Williamsburg. Nevertheless, this is not a film for children nor for squeamish adults. I grudgingly give it Four Stars because it kept you guessing. I'm the 258th person to review this film. Buy it and you may or may not like it.
