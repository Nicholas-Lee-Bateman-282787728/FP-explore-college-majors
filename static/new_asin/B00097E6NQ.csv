2269192,5,B00097E6NQ,"I'm a huge fan of movies, and as a Christian I'm a huge fan of christian movies and ""the end of the harvest"" is right up there among my very favourites.
This film stars David White (from the excellent Mercy Streets) as a student on campus who knows and studies his bible furiously but is shy about sharing his faith (a common problem) and his friend who as a sort of revenge organises a speech in front of the philosophy class that specialises in humiliating christians. They have stumbled upon a paper written some 50 years before that claims to know when the world will end.
Featuring excellent acting and very well put together screenplay, End of the harvest will provoke thought in both christians and non-christians alike on how long this world is going to continue and when it will end. Very well done.
Thanks for reading.",1085356800,67,828,4.601351351351352
2269193,5,B00097E6NQ,My Husband and I originally saw this program on television.  We are both involved in Evangelism Explosion at our Church.  This movie encourages us to all we can to bring in the Harvest before it is too late.  It really hit home to us how important is to be prepared to give an account of what we believe and when the time comes to have the boldness to do so.  Time is short and there is a lot to do.,1053993600,32,399,3.95
2269194,5,B00097E6NQ,"I first saw this movie late one night on Christian TV.  What an impact the opening scenes had on me!  I won't spoil it for you here, but it really gets the movie off to a great start.  A Christian reluctant to share his Faith with non-Christians is motivated to ""join the harvest"".
I can tell you the basic story is set at a modern-day university (shot on location at Arkansas State University).  A group of evangelical college students attend a secular philosophy club meeting where one of their own is defending the existence of God.  Unfortunately, this young man, while sincere, did not prepare properly for such an encounter and winds up being ridiculed mercilessly.  One verse comes to mind. It is often misused to support secular scholastical study as ""Study to show thyself approved"".  However in proper Biblical context it is ""Study to show thyself approved, rightly presenting the Word of Truth accurately"" (paraphrased).  This student simply didn't do his homework.
After the defeat, another of the students decides to present a controversial topic based upon an archived paper from a former student of the same university.  He studies hard to attempt to present the material properly.  But he repeatedly challenges the philosophy group's organizers, telling them of their approaching comeuppance.  The leaders of the philosophy group decide to perform a pre-emptive strike against the student by discrediting his personal character.  This sets the stage for the reluctant evangelical to step up to the plate.
He's not allowed to escape.  A seemingly kind lady proceeds to chide him relentlessly for his reluctance and demands that he present the advertised material.  What are her true intentions?  She doesn't seem friendly at all and the philosophy group is amused at her seemingly hostile statements.  There are surprises in store for everyone.
Regarding the presentation, the material is Biblically accurate and proper in context.  There is no date-setting in the film as the overall theme is ""signs of the times"".  Beyond that, there is a potentially plausible theory, rooted in the regathering of Israel, (Isaiah 66:8, Ezekiel 36:24, Amos 9:15 et al), and their eventual awakening of Hosea 6:2.  Given that the rebirth of national Israel is now an historical fact, the prophetical accuracy of Isaiah 66:8 and Hosea 6:2 (etc) cannot be denied.
I would have preferred to own this video in DVD format as most of my library is now DVD.  A wide-screen version would have been nice but I don't know if the movie was shot in that format.  Hopefully, a DVD version with trailers, commentaries, and other bonus materials will be made available in the near future.  I recommend this movie for all ages, and especially for youth groups and college-aged students.  Enjoy!",1031443200,52,2777,5.041666666666667
2269195,5,B00097E6NQ,"This is an excellent movie for those you love studying biblical end time theories.  This movie will give you many things to think about and a new perspective on the Bible.  This movie is good at not being extreme.  It doesn't present theories as true, but rather as possibilities.  The information deals a lot with numbers in the Bible.",1000080000,14,336,4.6440677966101696

2269202,3,B00097E6NQ,Had a good experience with the seller but it was a mediocre at best movie. The theme seemed predictable. Acting was a bit corny. Message about Rapture was biblical but brief and I didn't learn anything.,1436659200,,202,4.638888888888889

2269220,5,B00097E6NQ,This movie is a great blessing. It speaks of the end of time from what the bible speaks about. It catches your. Interest that you have to look at it more than once.,1403481600,,164,4.0
2269221,5,B00097E6NQ,This film makes you want to go evangelize the world for JESUS! I recommend this movie for everyone. It also is very informative for those who doubt the Holy Bible is real.,1400025600,,171,4.375
2269222,5,B00097E6NQ,A Unique Look At The End Times; however one thing the movie failed to add was the actual years Jesus was on Earth 33 1/2 years so don't forget to add that number of years to the movie along with bible verse days to the Lord are like one thousand years.,1388016000,,252,3.9607843137254903

2269234,4,B00097E6NQ,"Originally, I had this video on VHS, but my VCR is not well. I also wanted to rip it for a computer backup, so I bought the C.D.  Something is wrong with the CD though.  There is a strange jittery black and white line at the top.  It doesn't seem to interfere with the video, though.  There is so much depth to this video, even the title. It truly saddens me that many do not see the depth of this film.",1375142400,,403,3.9382716049382718
2269235,3,B00097E6NQ,Not a good movie for anyone susceptible to religious delusional thinking.  Due to the nature of the allegorical interpretation of the text.,1375142400,,139,5.318181818181818
2269236,5,B00097E6NQ,"I really like the David AR White, Brad Heller and Kevin Downes films.  I've seen their ""grown up"" movies (The Moment After, Six The Mark Unleashed, Blink of An Eye, Mercy Streets, Late One Night) and now I'm going farther back into their careers to when they were much younger (The Crossing and End of the Harvest.)

I liked ""End of the Harvest"" very much and I would definitely recommend this movie for Christians.  It might also be a great witnessing tool for someone who thinks they know all the answers or for someone who is smug with a ""pat answer"" or ""put-down"" for Christianity.

In regard to what the movie is about, I wouldn't say much more than what is written on the back of the DVD case, because to say more would give too much away.  It had a great, although not completely unexpected, ending.  The theory introduced about the time theory in the Bible is interesting and worth considering.

I am very happy with my purchase.  Oh, one last thing.  Don't miss the interview with David AR White in the Special Features.",1374710400,,1029,4.518918918918919

This video, if nothing else, gives the viewer lots to think about and consider. Whatever your thoughts on end-time prophecy this video presents theory that I had never heard and I found it valuable if only for that reason. The storyline is good but I didn't come away with a feeling of ""WOW!"" - rather with a feeling of ""Hmmm...interesting. VERY interesting!""",1299110400,3,512,6.434782608695652
2269260,5,B00097E6NQ,"This was one of the most wonderful films i have seen yet! I liked this because it carried alot of Bible in it. Not just God this or God that, But a serious reference to Christ and his principals. It showed the power of the word of God and how it can penetrate  the skeptical heart. This is a bible based film where you will get a refreshing splash of the Word while listening and learning. Not sure about the theory that it talks about or  its proofs, but, either way you look at it, if you are not a believer before you see this, you will be afterward. Thats the beauty of any christian movie, and thats what i  look for, the witness. remarkable and memorable! Yay!!!! thumbs up.. way up :)",1298764800,7,691,4.180451127819549
2269261,1,B00097E6NQ,"What they tried to say in this movie they could have said in 5 minutes - not spend 1 hour and try to entertain viewers. The actors clearly have no idea who Biblical Israel is and make plain stupid conclusions about Israel in the end time. I am no beginner in ""End Time"" studies and can appreciate something of value on the subject.

I would like to advise anyone who are into end-time studies to buy the book ""Who is Esau-Edom ?"". This book is a must read with very well research done by the writer, Charles Weisman. You can buy this book at Amazon.",1294012800,5,549,4.228571428571429

There is no hard hitting truth, and the outcome is unrealistic. Look else where for truth to build on. This is not a resource for the watch of Him who comes like a thief in the night.

and YES, i absolutely am a christian.

fear is not a tool that should ever be used to love folks into the kingdom.

the idea of the rapture is less than 200 years old, it was a vision made by a young british woman->
