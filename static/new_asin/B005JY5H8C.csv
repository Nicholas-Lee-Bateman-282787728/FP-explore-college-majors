4713320,5,B005JY5H8C,"Dr. King is a very brave, sensitive, and intelligent woman to publish this under her name! Especially now that this social plight is even more debated after 75 million abortions in the USA alone since 1973.  So she and many others wonder what greater good has been achieved for not having a whole generation of new 'souls'?",1354147200,,323,4.666666666666667

4713322,5,B005JY5H8C,"Dear Amazon,
This video compiled by Dr King (Martin Luther King's Grandaughter)and team reveals a truth that most of us try to not see.
Particularly revealing is the fact that abortion is the most insidious crime against humanity that the world has ever know.(Particularly the poor.) In some poor areas in U.S. pregnancy termination reaches 70% and throughout the world abortion has made the womb the most dangerous place (with 25% mortality rate) for any human anywhere.
Generations of people destroyed without hardly a blink of an eye.
Shows how inhuman humanism is when we leave God out.
Dare Leaders either political ,Legal ,medical,secular and/or church to see this one.
Great DVD.

4713324,5,B005JY5H8C,"WOW !  ALTHOUGH THIS MOVIE IS RATHER SAD CONCERNING THE ABORTION IN AMERICA FACTS ~ THESE ARE SOMETHING EVERY AMERICAN NEEDS TO KNOW AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT !  I HIGHLY RECCOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO OPEN THE EYES OF OUR HEARTS AND ACCEPT THE FACTS ABOUT AN ISSUE THAT MANY ARE DECEIVED ABOUT .  AS MY CATHOLIC PRIEST FROM ST.

4713325,5,B005JY5H8C,"I enjoyed this years earlier, remembered it, and bought it for my grandsons, age 7 - 8. Lots of fun and action. This movie illustrates the power of kindness to overcome fear and how courageous children can be in protecting a friend.",1388188800,,232,4.5476190476190474
4713326,5,B005JY5H8C,This video shows that women are victims here. The doctor in this video is really brave to put herself in danger and expose this creepy stuff. It's all about the money.,1383782400,,167,4.419354838709677
4713327,5,B005JY5H8C,"I bought this movie because I pass it along to young girls and boys who are not educated about abortions. Our culture today bombards so much sex for the young to see, but does not show the consequences of thier actions in regard to sex. This movie tells it like it really is and the heartfelt testimonies of the people who were formally active in the abortion business. I suggest anyone who wants to know the truth about abortion should see this movie. There is also another movie called, ""The silent Scream"", by Dr. Bernard N. Nathanson, which is equally informative on the truth of abortion. If you believe in the sanctity of life of the unborn, I recommend both these movies.",1366502400,4,678,4.565573770491803
4713328,5,B005JY5H8C,"This video describes a very great evil occurring in our nation and the world. Worldwide there are 30 to 60 million abortions every year. Not only are babies being murdered but mothers lives are being destroyed including great risks to their bodies. God gives each human being a special plan to fulfill in this life such as the cure to cancer, aids, etc. If we destroy that life, God does not give that plan to cure cancer, aids, etc. to someone else. That plan is lost permanently.",1366502400,2,481,4.540229885057471
4713329,5,B005JY5H8C,"Required viewing for anyone who worships at the altar of Planned Parenthood. It is a business, the business of murder and the devaluing of human life.",1362268800,,150,4.8076923076923075
4713330,5,B005JY5H8C,Lots if insight into the abortion industry from those who worked in it for years. You will learn things that will shock you! There is no gross pictures or anything like that. It is more testimonials from those directly involved.,1360195200,2,228,4.725
4713331,5,B005JY5H8C,This heartbreaking film on the abortion industry is very enlightening. It should NOT be watched with younger kids in the room but gives an insider look into a harsh industry. I used it as a discussion starter with my bible study ladies.,1357430400,,236,4.642857142857143
4713332,5,B005JY5H8C,"I first viewed this DVD over a year ago and bought several copies.  I have now run out and will be purchasing several more.

This movie is compelling for several reasons.

The firsthand testimony of Carol Everett will leave you speachless.  As the former owner of abortion clinics, Ms. Everett spills the beans about how abortion providers collaborate on finding ways to insure young women come in as repeat customers.  She talks almost casually about how abortion providers train their intake staff on scripts that are aimed at keeping that woman abortion-minded...about how they get into the schools at an early age, handing out business cards so that if a young woman wants birth control later, they will know who to go to. And, most shockingly, how abortion providers stock low-quality birth-control pills and condoms because they have a high failure rate, thus ensuring that these youngsters will be back later for help with an abortion.  Some really shocking stuff in there -- and Carol Everett is a hero for coming out into the spotlight with candid admissions of her own part in the abortion debacle.

Almost as compelling, though, is the heart-wrenching stories of women who have had abortions.  I counsel women who have had abortions and this is the first documentary I've seen where the true agony of their decision is portrayed realistically.  This is the one death that people aren't allowed to grieve.  Society says it's no big deal, so women are afraid to admit their abortion didn't bring them the relief that it was supposed to.  Instead it brought them horror-filled nightmares and near suicidal despondency. People on the Pro-Life side actually get to see the anguish these women face and realize they aren't the monsters they had believed them to be, thus opening their own mind to the vulnerability that women often face when hit with an unplanned pregnancy.

This DVD goes a long way to dispel some of the myths that are prevalent in both the pro-choice and pro-life communities.

I can't recommend it highly enough.",1355356800,12,2038,4.923976608187134

8476098,5,B005JY5H8C,Compelling documentary about the horrors of the abortion industry. Hearing from the women who have been destroyed by their choice to abort is heart-breaking.,1440460800,,157,5.583333333333333
8476099,5,B005JY5H8C,"This production was well done. The people being interviewed aren't just spouting off ideology, most have had direct experience with abortion, either by working for years at an abortion clinic, or having had abortions themselves.  Everyone should see this!",1428710400,,255,5.538461538461538
8476100,5,B005JY5H8C,This is the most profound story of the Abortion movement ever told. Historically significant and verifiable data are compelling and heart breaking. The abortion industry was established with RACISM in mind and is perpetrated to this day by the hundreds of people still voting for politicians that are for aborting babies. The irony is the African American population is literally voting for their own annhilation.,1428537600,,413,5.369230769230769

8476103,5,B005JY5H8C,"Dr. King has devoted her later life to fight abortion along with Priests for Life and other organizations.  I  purchased this for my parish library and haven't watched it yet.  I am looking forward to the facts it will present to show how abortion providers get federal funding to kill innocent unborn babies.  Alll those who believe that Choice means that it is ok to murder human life to support one's personal desires/needs should watch this video which will, I'm sure, point out how such murders are promoted for the increasing profit to go to the abortion provider and a lifetime of regret to the mother who has participated in this murder.",1409270400,,645,4.732142857142857

8476105,5,B005JY5H8C,"Abortion is prettied up with terms that skip over its reality like fetus or labor and delivery for a late term abortion. This film cuts through that and provides the facts about it. It is not pretty and it is a quite lucrative business for those willing to engage in it for a living.

Considering the fact that Planned Parenthood along performed 324,5008 abortions in 2008 alone according to their 2010 fact sheet, this is more of a business than one may think. The earliest abortions run $1,000 and proceed upwards to $30,000 as the weeks go by.

If one wants to see both sides of the issue, considering the reality that most of media rhetoric is Pro-Choice (pro-death actually), this film would be a quick way to get the other side of the issue that is never reported in the media and recommended.",1401580800,2,799,4.541666666666667
8476106,5,B005JY5H8C,"Every person in the world should watch this documentary. It is so clarifying. It answers so many questions!!! Even if you are pro choice, you should watch this.
Highly recommended!!!! Received the DVD on time.",1399248000,,209,5.0
