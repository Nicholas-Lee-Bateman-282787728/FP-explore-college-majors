8387723,5,B0032ZY34O,"Each dancer in ""Belly Dance Power and Passion"" has spectacularly showcased their unique talents in this magnificently produced DVD. I was so impressed by the music, the lights, and of course, the dancing in this production. Many of these dancers are close to my heart, but every single one of them made an impact on me when I watched them on screen. The dances take you through a range of emotions - sadness, longing, joy, even humor! That is what makes this DVD stand out. What a wonderful medley. I can't wait for the next one!",1295481600,2,529,4.520833333333333
8387724,5,B0032ZY34O,"I was reccomended to purchase this video after expressing my interest in Middle Eastern arts to a friend. I am not even a belly dancer, nor have I ever tried it, but was captivated from start to finish. The dancers in this performance are clearly top-notch professionals and deliver 5-star performances. I don't know all the nuances of the art form, but I was still highly engaged, and now am even eager to learn much more about the art!! I have to pat the producers on the back...there are a LOT of performance dvds out there on the market, but few achieve Power and Passion's quality. Reccomended for dancers, and those interested in the field, or simply those looking for a new experience in entertainment and art!",1295222400,3,717,4.653543307086614
8387725,5,B0032ZY34O,"In a cyber world flooded with a growing with ensemble bellydance seminars, recitals and theatrical presentations on the DVD commercial market, this DVD's effort seems to get it right by keeping it simple and letting the bellydance (and musical selections) take central focus. It also allows folks who are not used to seeing the immerse talents of bellydancing out of the Pacific Northwest shine, with a nice blend of special guests who have performed worldwide as well.

The girls of BELLYDANCE SOULFIRE, who has had a nice banner back-to-back yearly success in 2009 & 2010, are as equally tempting and sensational as soloists (as you'll see in this DVD) as they are known for their award-winning choreographical genius. In rare form, a group of women sharing the same passions of an art form comes together and performs in synchronization of each other to make something magical happen, each bringing something extra-special to the mix (including their newest member Shara, originally from the DC area, who is a master of fusing samba fusion with sensual bellydance skills).

No DVD can go wrong with the inclusions of the unconsciously fluid RACHEL GEORGE (who has dazzled out of the Portland and San Diego areas for more than a decade now) and the legendary DELILAH of Seattle (who performs flawlessly with the band HOUSE OF TARAB). As an added bonus, the powerful and heart-driven drumming of KARIM NAGI (aka, ''Turbo Tabla'') allows his diversity to show, once as a solo dance of folk Middle Eastern artistry and at the end with a drum solo knockout sequence with the ladies of Bellydance Soulfire.

Everything, from the lighting to the spacious stage space allows each performing dancer and musician the room to maneuver and dazzle. You will be taken on a journey not just through traditional bellydance, but a showcase that other forms of dance art has a place where when bellydance touches it (and does it properly and tastefully), a whole new perspective of evolutionary art shines through (with assistance from NYC's Darshan).

In the now 20th anniversary year that I have been collecting bellydance tapes and DVD's, this one is a Top 5 standout, to say the least, and is a staple blueprint on how an ensemble bellydance show should be performed and visualized on a DVD, a homage to the technical and engineering staffs who also did a great job in their own right. Future ''Power & Passion'' DVDs are a must, for now, you'll have to settle on getting this one, a DVD you're guaranteed to play many times over after you initially see it and be as equally amazed as I am. Big props to the Pacific Northwest, a bellydance strong bed that shows it has continued staying power, young and veteran, for many more performances and years to come.

That was a magical night when they filmed this and it is just as magical to watch it over and over again. I would pay twice the amount to own this DVD!! The price is great; the costumes are fabulous, the dancers are some of the best in the country. You have what, 3 plus Belly dance USA champs on one DVD.
