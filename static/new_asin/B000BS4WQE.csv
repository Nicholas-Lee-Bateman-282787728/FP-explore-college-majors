8091728,4,B000BS4WQE,"On this DVD, Inkwell Images has brought together two films which are often mistaken for each other in film histories.

1933's The March of the Movies was compiled and narrated by American film pioneer J. Stuart Blackton, who was one of the first directors for Edison's Vitagraph studio and one of the earliest experimenters with film animation.  The first half of Blackton's film covers the pre-history of moving pictures, going back to the ancient Egyptians, and eventually advancing to Edison and George Eastman, which is where Blackton comes in, with clips and reminiscences (although I could've used more of the latter).  Even then, some of his early films were already lost or otherwise unavailable, so Blackton and ex-Vitagraph director William P.S. Earle recreated a number of early milestones.

The March of the Movies was re-cut several times in Blackton's lifetime, and apparently was significantly expanded for a 1957 re-release.  This Inkwell Images release presents is a reconstruction of the original version.

The British-produced The Film Parade (1947), written and directed by Howard Gaye, with narration by Kent Stevenson, covers much of the same ground with (at least at first) an Anglo-Eurocentric slant.  Unfortunately, Stevenson narrates its silent clips in rhyming couplets, which wears on the patience after awhile, even if the extended selections of the early films are fascinating.  A few ""dramatic recreations"" are found in this film, too; for instance, director Gaye obviously couldn't get the snippet of The Jazz Singer he wanted, so Jolson's blackface act was (badly) recreated.

These films must have been very nostalgic at the time, and gives the viewer an idea of how the motion picture industry presented its own history back when the primary documents weren't as available as they are now.  It's definitely worth a look, especially for Blackton's take.",1294790400,,1887,5.302013422818792
