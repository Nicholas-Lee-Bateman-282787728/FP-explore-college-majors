Let me tell you the perfect ingredients that produces totally crappy kung fu flicks: 1) Black magic drugs that makes fighters lose their sense of self (that is, they can't speak anymore after taking the drugs but understand hand gestures), will lose their fighting abilities in 30 days and become totally under the spell of an idiot playing a flute; 2) bad - or shall I say totally horrible choreographing; 3) a non-existent plot; 4) bad acting; and 5) lousy overdubs.  There's more, but I'll only state my top five.

In this flick, you're suppose to see rival clans battle to the duel, but you will be completely clueless as to the cause of some of the fighting in the first place.  They tried to insert a plot, but the idea totally sucked and is at best totally unbelievable.  A real plot to a movie would be something that is believable and at the same time holds your attention throughout.  You will be totally disappointed in this flick if you are used to being able to understand kung fu movies after you watch them.

If you want to watch a movie that totally leaves you in the dark, has a non-existent plot, contains crappy acting, choreography, and not too great overdubs then by all means - buy this one.  A ""1"" rating is too much for this one!",1128211200,,1404,4.3486590038314175

dvd's! YOU WILL NOT FIND THESE ANYWHERE ELSE! Most of these

movies are lost and will never be found! You will have to put up

with the fact that these films can't be saved to perfection!

Perhaps a shot in a dark you will find even a few of these in

widescreen! Like Crash Cinema's My 12 Kung Fu Kicks! You should

be thankful that these films are still around and you should be

brown-nosing Tai Seng for keeping them alive as of today! Want

someone to blame for fullscreen crap, blame Ocean Shores! And

the hell with that stupid moron from dvdcult.com says about

these MAT films! He has no knowledge of the history of kung fu

cinema! My knowledge of this is limited too, but at least I know

some stuff, and this fruit don't know anything! This movie would

be a descent kung fu film, despite the very confusing story, if

the picture was better! And this is not vhs or tape quality

we're talking about, it's the movie itself! There are some

scenes in the movie where you can't see crap, but overall it is

somewhat watchable! DVD works of course!",1117411200,3,1118,4.375609756097561
