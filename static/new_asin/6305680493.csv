""A Professional gentleman of leisure"" as he states on his answering machine message, the story of a white pimp making it in a brothers' world is simply too great to be ignored. Other characters of note include Don the Magic Juan, Snooky (who keeps his hoes walking with they heads down---nice touch), Ice-T, Pimpin' Ken, and a female pimp Big Lex.

1059233,5,6305680493,"Living in Glasgow Scotland we don't have the same exposure to ""the game"" as the folks in the US do.

The Ho's here in the U.K. by and large are heroin addicts and to be honest i wouldn't touch them with your's (if you know what i'm saying). They are skanky, sleazy and messed up. Their pimps are what we call scum (or trailer park trash to folk in the USA) and have NONE of the style, pizazz or character of the guys in this video.

Even the ho's in this film come across as at least able to form a coherent sentence and don't sound (like the ones over here) like they've just injected themselves with a gram of smack.

This is the crux of this film, the Mac's are so cheezy yet they've got character by the bucket load. Sure they epitomise every sterotype about how a pimp looks but as Pimpin Ken said ""a ho chooses a pimp"". The Bishop says ""women love colour"" and he's right these guys have a style of their own which garish or not is still style.

Some of the quotes in this film are great especially Mr Whitefolks ""Let's see Bill and Hilary Clinton when we have the 1 million Mac march and come on down to Washington. Then what they gonna do?. Who the gonna call? Ghostbusters?!!""

Absolutely hilarious.

One frightening thing though is when The Bishop talks about dedication just after he talks about pimp arrest. The story about the Ho in Hospital with bullet wounds looking up and saying she wanted to get out of her bed and go an get his money. What sort of control do these guys have over these women that they would take a bullet and still wanna see that man getting paid. It's scary to think about.

That said there was the right blend of what pimps used to do (beatings etc) and how it is now to make it reasonably balanced.

Oh and there are some FFIIIIINNNEEEE women in this film. Especially the georgous dancer wearing the black bikini style outfit with the green tassles during the Player's ball. She is so hot.

Really this is a must see for the colourfull outfits and commentaries especially from Whitefolks, Don Juan and Pimp Snooky ""you know what i'm saying there's some real pimpin goin on, know what i'm saying"". Even if some of the Mac's i didn't understand a word they were saying",1133049600,8,2204,4.343065693430657
1059234,4,6305680493,"I gave this 4 stars not because I believe in this mess but because I believe girls/woman who are leaning toward this life style would benefit from watching this first. The pimps look for women who have already suffered abuse from her own family. This makes it easier for them to physically, emotionally and mentally not to mention sexually abuse their prostitutes. They need an already ""damaged"" woman to exploit her. They specifically say they need women with low self-esteem and those that have been molested as children. They then build their business by furthering the cycle of abuse of these woman. The men who pimp women also lack respect for women. Although they say they don't. It's obvious they don't know the definition of respect. They are parasites who have sold their souls. They control every aspect of a woman's life. They do mention several times that a ""Ho"" picks them. Which justifies the abuse. They could not deal or relate to women with their self-esteem in tack. They are predators, and abused women are their prey. This movie could help women from refusing the business and seeking counseling in dealing with her issues. If she could see the life she is headed to in advance by seeing and understanding this movie. The men who pimp women also have issues  of being inferior so they take that aggression out on someone less inferior which  happens to be a woman with pre-existing psychological issues of abuse and neglect. So with that said, these wanna be ""men"" are no more than ""Bitches"" themselves. I almost forgot, they have female pimps. They are lesbians. Enough said. However, they are not as ruthless as the men. Many have their girls are dancers/strippers and not selling their bodies. What I can't understand is how we, as a people could ever justify ""owning"" another human being. Selling them to the highest bidder, then having the audacity to have issues with slavery. These uneducated fools are modern day slave masters. The oppressed have become the oppressor.",1122076800,26,1996,4.867647058823529

1059236,5,6305680493,"This is a first hand perspective into the world of pimpin. If you have no respect or interest for pimping, pimp game or just an open minded curiousity in wanting to learn more about just what pimpin in the modern age is then you have no business writing a review or anything else about this movie. I don't like hockey, Nelly and alot of other things, that being said your not going to see me writing reviews for something I have no knowledge about or any interest in. So for all of those who have watched this and didn't think it was all that or just not a just account of what pimpin is so be it ....at least you tried. But for those who have never seen it and are writing this out of word of mouth shut up and get over it. Stick to what you like and those of us who like this movie will keep on keeping on. People make movies of whatever they want nowadays. If you actually watch the movie you might learn something and you can see just how bizarre and sometimes sad this private underworld is.

Hey critics, are you sure you never made any movies. I bet you have.",1107907200,5,1066,4.125
1059237,1,6305680493,"This ""documentary"" on the game wasn't well done at all. Most of the macks don't even seem credible. (See the lesbian pimp who gets engaged to one of her girls; Mr. Whitefolks - 'nuf said) If you want to see a documentary with some historical context and some legitimate pimps, I would recommend ""American Pimp"" by the Hughes Bros. rather than this home video/film. The only bright spot of this film was the scene where Don ""Magic"" Juan spots a teenanged reader of his autobiography, and frankly tells the young man ""Don't do this to yourself... be a doctor or a lawyer..."". Overall this film gets a D-.",1107734400,12,602,4.583333333333333
1059238,1,6305680493,"If you would like some factual information underlying the glitz and glamour portayed in this video, please contact an organization on comercial sexual exploitation. We can tell you about the whipping with coat hangers combined with salt water baths, or curling iron burns all over the body followed by hot curling irons (...). Sound glamorous? All because you didn't finish up your whole box of condoms. If you believe these con-artists (gamers), you are very naive. Dont be ignorant, get the facts. But be prepared to deal with changing your views about the women involved in this lifestyle when you do. The only good thing artistically these films do is to evoke dynamic discussion on the issue of commercial sexual exploitation.

1059239,5,6305680493,"This is a documentary on the world of pimps and prostitutes. Two of the pimps featured in here, Don ""Magic"" Juan(A FORMER pimp) and ""Snooky""('98 Pimp of the Year) to me stand out. Don Magic Juan is so unbelievably hilarious! He was in a store talking to a young man who was reading  a book all about pimping, and Don Juan sais to him, ""Hey man, go to school, study hard and get yourself a good job, don't do what i'm doin'. 'Cause when you start pimpin' man, WHEW!! Hey man, it'll be more work usin' your mind than it would be liftin' this whole building! I mean, Pimpin' ain't easy but I know somebody's gotta do it!"" I don't know, me personally, that one kept me laughing for about a week straight. The pimps in this documentary speak very blatantly. Sometimes, it can come across as very harsh and cold hearted to someone who's not familiar with pimp lingo. But what attracts me to this documentary is the flashiness of the way the pimps dress, the way they talk, and how they come right out and tell you, ""Yeah, I do that, yeah I do this!!"" And come on, what guy doesn't fantasize about having five female celebrities all to themselves the way these pimps have women for them? The other pimp in this movie to look for if you want to be royally entertained aside from Snooky and Don Juan is Mr. Whitefolks.",1057104000,3,1309,4.3428571428571425
1059240,5,6305680493,"There are only a few films that come around that keeps you thinking long after it is over, ""Pimps Up, Hoes Down"" is such a film. From start to end it keeps you mesmerized, from crazy clothes to the silly hoes, it grabs your attention and doesn't let go. Probably the most amazing character in the film is Bishop, the ex-pimp. This guy is probably the most dramatic piece of work ever put on film. He needs his own television show, all he needs is a camera and some lights to show off the colorful duds. His vocabulary is extrordinary. All the pimps and hoes are interesting, they pull you into their world and what a glimpse. If you get this film for anything it should be for the Player's Ball. This is one that ranks up there with O.J Simpson's Bronco chase, the ball shows the pimps and hoes in all their glory. In short it is ""Tight"", you will be viewing this segment for years to come.
Do yourself a favor and get this film, it is nothing short of a masterpiece. Seriously!",975888000,8,978,4.291891891891892

Anyone who feels the need to glamorize pimps, who are ALL women hating, lying losers, needs to take a belt off and beat themselves with it. I saw this once on cable and it left a bad taste in my mouth. There is NOTHING glamorous or attractive about a group of ugly, unintelligent males parading around bragging about how they abuse these women. This movie stars the biggest assortment of losers ever to be assembled onscreen. These pimps are ridiculous. If these morons can be pimps, then it MUST be easy. They couldn't get me to sell a pack of gum for them, let alone my body. I actually give this crud zero stars.",1182556800,8,662,4.390243902439025
7892924,4,6305680493,"This film makes a good combination to own with the American Pimp DVD.

AP is more polished bling-bling presentation and more educational interviews with Pimps, whereas PUHD is lower budget and seems to catch the Pimps just showing off to the camera, spouting cliches and not go as in depth in knowledge with interviewing them. So what does PUHD offer?

But PUHD has plenty of footage of the men and women in action and is a MUST HAVE along with American Pimp DVD, Pimp and Naked Soul by Iceberg, Space Age Pimping by Paradise, Gentleman Pimp by Stonewall.",1161648000,2,555,4.653061224489796
7892925,4,6305680493,"I've actually seen both the HBO series directed by Brent Owens and the move ""American Pimp"" and I'd say that they compliment each other quite well.  But, the Owens' documentaries go further in showing in great detail what the lives of the women who work for these pimps are like.

The pimps are allowed to just speak.  There's no leading no constant interjection from ""journalists"" moralizing, just the pimps.  And whether they know it or not, we see past all of the outrageous talk and gaudy clothes.  We see men who might have been something worthwhile, men who are cruel, men who are outright sociopaths, all using women in the most cold and de-humanizing ways possible, and we see that they are very real.  And that is very scary.

For those who've actually seen this documentary I'd suggest seeing ""Hookers at the Point"" as well.  The same un-flinching look given to the pimps is turned towards the prostitutes, and believe me after seeing it one thing will be clear.  With the prostitutes descriptions of the violence that they've suffered through and the frank portrayal of the crude and quite ugly sex that they must perform, there is one thing that you can never say again.  You can never say that there is anything remotely glamorous or ""Pretty-Woman-Like"" about prostitution.",1145059200,9,1286,4.831050228310502
