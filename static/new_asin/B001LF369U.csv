8317959,2,B001LF369U,"I thought from the title that this would be an instructional dvd on learning Hebrew.  There was no real information that could be used to learn Hebrew.  The DVD should be called a review of biblical Hebrew.  The information should be more extensive.  Plus if your recording audio, get your self away from the kids talking in the back ground.  This was not what I was looking for and the title is a bit deceptive.",1378166400,4,412,4.44
8317960,4,B001LF369U,This was very helpful.  It was good at reviewing letter names.  I would have liked more work on the sounds.,1361750400,,107,4.3
8317961,3,B001LF369U,"I found about twenty minutes of this video very helpful - the reading practices - particularly with learning vowels.  I will definitely revisit these segments a few times.  Unfortunately since I already knew the letters the Hebrew Aleph-bet, the first fifteen minutes of the video was just a refresher course and easily the equivalent of something you can find on YouTube.  WAY too much time spent illustrating how to write the letters.  I would have preferred a quick instructional and suggestion to pause the video to practice. I ended up fast forwarding through the whole section. I feel like I got my money's worth for the rental at $1.99, but I would have been very disappointed if I had paid to purchase it at $9.00.",1338595200,3,722,4.752
8317962,5,B001LF369U,This DVD study of Biblical Hebrew is very basic and to the point. The author goes thru each letter and steps for writing and putting the letters together and it is easy to understand.,1315872000,5,183,4.411764705882353
