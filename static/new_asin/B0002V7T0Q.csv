this pack of 7 movies is the best price and quality i could hope for these films are excelent but some of the dubbing sounds kind of  stupid in english but a true godzilla fan like me won't care so i suggest this to increase a collection or just to have when freinds come over with there kids. so all in all these movies come in extremely good quality on dvd and i would suggest them for a gift or for fanndome.",1131840000,7,475,3.9375

2121889,4,B0002V7T0Q,"The set as it is allows you to catch up on all the newer godzillas from the mid 90's to after 2000 ( except the horrible american disaster version). Sure there are no special features on any of the discs but the japanese aren't big on that stuff anyway. The biggest flaw in the set is the absence of Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla II which could have been in the set instead of the American version. I would have given it a full 5 star rating with raving review if they took all the movies and repackaged each DVD case to be a uniformed set. The earlier ones like the two double featured could have  been remastered and have had the japanese language audio added as did the later DVD's in the set.

Over all it helped me gather up all the newer Godzilla movie, some awesome,(which is why I give it a 4 instead of 3 )at a lower price then buying them separately.",1100131200,,856,4.213414634146342

2121973,2,B0002V7T0Q,"First off, these are all good to excellent Godzilla
flicks - lots of fun and worth owning. I give 2 stars
because if you don't happen to already own any of these,
you can at least get an instant collection for a fairly
good deal (low price).

The bad news is for those who are not new to Godzilla and
who have a collection already:  all Sony did, from the looks
of it, is bundle up the back stock of previously released dvds.
There are no decent extras to speak of.  This collection
features 9 movies on 7 disks as follows (two disks are double
features).

The Good:

Yes, there is some good here! The following are how ALL the
movies should have been handled and would have made this a more
solid effort on Sony's part:

Godzilla x Megaguirus, GMK and Godzilla x Mechagodzilla are
all in High Definition, offer English and Japanese soundtracks
and english subtiltles, which is the way ALL Godzilla flicks
should be presented in this day and age of DVDs.

The Bad:

Godzilla x Mothra Battle for Earth and Godzilla x Ghidorah.
A travesty because these are STILL not presented in their
original aspect ration; they have NO JAPANESE soundtrack and don't
even have close captioning/English Subs.  These are the exact
same Full Screen-No Frills copies that have been floating around
for years - whats up with Columbia Tristar!?

Godzilla x Space Godzilla and Godzilla x Destroyah.  Great
flicks which are at least in widescreen.  Columbia Tristar
still held off from including a Japanese soundtrack!

Godzilla 2000 - still just an English dub here folks, sorry.
At least its in widescreen; there is also a comentary track and
a few other nice extras which lift this disk up a bit.

The Ugly:

Godzilla 1998 - including this movie was weak. It isn't
all that bad if you can forget it bears the title of a
Godzilla movie because that's where any similarities end. It
doesn't need further comment except to say its a dinosaur
movie with lots of CGI effects and no heart.  Its worth
seeing for the general viewer of hollywood style flicks.

In conclusion, Sony didn't do anything to make this a more
interesting collection for the long-time, long-term fan. I'm
not as sour on Sony/Columbia Tristar as I may sound here, but
this release just doesn't have anything extra.
Sony will have little to say to those who seek out bootlegs
or versions released from other countries in order to view
the movies as they were originally released.

50th Anniversary Editions:
Better news is that the other earlier 70s Godzilla flicks
(GxMegalon, GxGigan, GxMechaGodzilla etc.) were released
with English and Japanese dubs. Hoo-Ray for Columbia Tristar!",1167523200,40,2629,4.753303964757709
2121974,1,B0002V7T0Q,"This is probablythe worst set of movies to be put together. Even ""Godzilla vs Megalon"" had MORE HEART and Fun than these rejects. Watch the classics if you can-they are all much better and more family friendly. People used to MTV quality and trash movies though will probably go Ga-GA over these efforts though.

2121976,5,B0002V7T0Q,"If any of you are familiar with The Curmudgeon's other reviews, you may well be scratching your heads at this one. A FIVE star review?! That can't be right. And usually, YOU would be right. The Curmudgeon has dedicated 95 of his 100 reviews to bringing you the very worst things out there. To celebrate the 50 review milestone I reviewed 5 GREAT things that are available on Amazon, and so, now I've reached 100, I thought I'd do the same again. So, from reviews 100 - 105, it's going to be nothing but good, great and awesome stuff.

Sometimes there's no justice. The term ""Giant Monster Movies"" immediately throws up two names: Godzilla and King Kong. The two kings of the genre have never really been fairly matched, however. Whilst Godzilla has a far greater quantity of movies, the big monkey certainly wins out in the quality stakes. Godawful 70's remake and sequel aside, Kong has fared better in the original movie (easily one of the greatest movies ever made) and the new glossy big budget remake certainly fared better than the abysmal 90's US attempt at Godzilla.

Speaking of THAT film, it's included on this boxset. Now let us never speak of it again. There's far better films to consider, all of which embrace the sense of adventure, inventiveness and fun that make this genre such a joy to watch. This boxset collects some of the more recent efforts, miles away from the more kiddie-friendly fare of the 70's movies. These are far more, um, realistic(?) in approach, a nod to the more serious side of the Big G. It's a superb collection that, crappy American attempt aside, will please anyone who don't salivate over the latest 100 million dollar CGI-fest. A guy in a suit it may be, but the genius of these movies is their ability to make you believe that it's a bad ass radioactive dinosaur trashing Tokyo for the millionth time.

This review isn't just about this boxset in particular, but Godzilla movies in general. If you can accept the often ropey effects, the absurd plots and wonky dialogue, they offer a sense of escapism that is unmatched. These movies have a passion and genuine love for their monsters that is so infectious, it isn't long before you know all of the monsters and are cheering on your favourites (""Go Mecha-Godzilla! Wooooh!"")

King Kong and Godzilla, then. Kong may have the better movies, but Godzilla remains the better - and best - monster. Regardless of all the ""final movie"" comments (pah, I'll believe it when I see it) - long may his reign continue.

And that's part four of five taken care of. Just one more thing that The Curmudgeon actually likes. But what on earth could it be? Only one way to find out...

8032446,1,B0002V7T0Q,"Actually, the Godzilla face on the cover is my all-time favorite suit build!  And for the most part the included movies (Godzilla In Name Only aka 1998 aside) are very good, but...okay, first off, why isn't Final Wars included?  Or the wonderfully fun sequel to Against Mechagodzilla, which is subtitled Tokyo S.O.S.?  They could easily have swapped ""GINO"" out for something much more actually Godzilla, like Vs. Biollante, Godzilla 1985 (The Legend Is Reborn), or by now maybe the 2014 American-made Godzilla.

My biggest ""What were they thinking?"", however, is the price tag!  I actually looked up all 9 movies here on Amazon before writing this review, and without including shipping my math for all new copies of all 9 movies is $51.88.  With no special features added, at least one pair of movies sharing a disc, and no promotional or other special materials, I fail entirely to understand the pricing logic.  I own all the included movies and bought most of them on Amazon.  There are several I would gladly buy again to introduce friends and family to what delights me best about Goji, but there's no way I'd buy this 9-title set for the asking price.",1475625600,,1158,4.813131313131313

8032453,3,B0002V7T0Q,"The 7-pack Godzilla DVD set has a total of 9 Godzilla movies within this set.  Overall you are getting quite a few Godzilla flicks for around $10 per movie (as of 7/2/2011), but not everything is as golden as it may seem with this boxset of movies.

WHY THIS BOXSET IS GOOD!
It is Godzilla. If you love Godzilla then this boxset is going to be awesome!  You get 9 action packed flicks.  Godzilla vs King Ghidora / Godzilla and Mothra: Battle for Earth / Godzilla vs Space Godzilla / Godzilla vs Destroyah / Godzilla(1998) / Godzilla 2000 / Godzilla: Giant Monsters all out attack / Godzilla vs Megaguirus and Godzilla against Mechagodzilla.

This selection is a nice compilation of Godzilla movies from around 1991 - 2002.  The movies are mainly the modern era of Godzilla and take advantage of improved special effects.  The Packaging of the DVD's is fairly simple.  Each movie has its own box except for the double feature movies (Godzilla vs Ghidora/Battle for Earth  and Godzilla vs SpaceGodzilla/Destroyah).  These double features come on a two sided DVD.  If you do not own any Godzilla movies on DVD then this set is perhaps the best one to start with.

All Out Monsters Attack, Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla and Godzilla vs Megaguirus have all been fully remastered in High-Definition.  They also can be watched in Japanese w/ English Subtitles

WHY THIS BOXSET IS BAD!
For all the simple good there is about this boxset (I mean come on... this is Godzilla we are talking about here) there is some bad.  While you are getting 9 movies on DVD the quality of the DVD's leaves something to be desired.  The first double feature ( King Ghidora and Battle for Earth ) is not in true widescreen but standard 4:3 copy as seen on TV/VHS.  To make matters worse the only two movies to contain any sort of Bonus Features / Additional Content are Godzilla(1998) and Godzilla(2000).  The two double feature disks are simply standard DVD releases with no remastering and English Dub only.

While all these problems are not major issues, more like disappointments; the biggest train wreck here is the inclusion of Godzilla(1998).  This movie just flat out doesn't belong with this set.  Godzilla(1998) has nothing to do with Godzilla as it just shares the same name.  It would of been better to drop Godzilla(1998) and include bonus features for the rest of the movies, or perhaps just a bonus disk containing all sorts of interviews and behind the scenes looks at the various Godzilla movies.  Or better yet, another actual Godzilla movie.

OVERALL
This boxset is not terrible in anyway.  You are getting 9 movies here at a decent enough price.  The set makes for a great gift for a Godzilla fan to add to the collection.  The movies themselves are anywhere from Fair to AWESOME!! with Godzilla(1998) the only bad movie of the bunch.  Despite lots of good with this boxset; The lack of special features on many of the movies, total lack of transfer on 2 of the movies, and inclusion of Godzilla(1998) over another Godzilla movie or bonus features hurts the score in the end.

What was a 4 star quality boxset I feel is more like a 3 star set in the end.  While not perfect, the set still brings you 8 awesome authentic Godzilla movies and 1 Americanized Godzilla movie.  Just understand there is going to be a lack of special/bonus features as well as 4 of the movies having no remastering at all done to them so they will look a little dated.",1309564800,2,3439,4.672212978369385
