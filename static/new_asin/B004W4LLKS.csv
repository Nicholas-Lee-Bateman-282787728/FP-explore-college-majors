Everyone in my groups have stated that this has been the most meaningful and helpful part of the entire program because it helps them see the perspective of both the person who has BPD and their loved ones. It is excellent, with great professional information as well as the family perspectives. in rating it, I think it is more fair to rate the caliber and quality of the DVDs as opposed to the cost.

Was it necessary to charge this price in order to recoup what it took to make it and make a reasonable profit?  Yeah, that's what I thought.  Ditto for the other 4.",1340150400,3,270,3.9444444444444446
