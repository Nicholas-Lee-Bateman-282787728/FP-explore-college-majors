1993916,5,B0001EFTN8,Just thought I would mention for the sake of the other reviewer that the Baked Potato live stuff on this DVD IS available on CD.  It is called Last Nite and it is excellent.  The ballad is called 'Emotions Wound Us So' and is stunning.,1151193600,,235,4.2
1993917,5,B0001EFTN8,"I saw this video years ago and had to buy my own copy.  I recently bought it for a friend after trying to figure out the best present I could possibly get him.... and this video came to mind.  This is Larry at his greatest.  He conveys his way of relating to the guitar conscisely, mostly through the blues which is the format he mostly uses in this video.  But don't let the 'blues' fool you into thinking that this is a simple blues video.  It's got more to it than that.  Larry plays plenty of examples with Terry Trotter on Rhodes.  Larry's tone is something to write an essay on but it'd be a waste of time... just buy the video or DVD and hear it for yourself.  He is able to musically control his feedback freakishly.  There are some live tracks with him playing with his band at the Baked Potato.  I wish Larry or whoever owns the rights would release that performance as it's own CD and DVD as it's some of the best stuff he's ever played (at least that I've heard and I've got a lot of his stuff).  The closing track will make you want to cry. I've never heard anyone pour so much emotion into a song and intuitively use feedback, his trademark volume ... well it goes beyond explanation... it's really something else.  Even though it's recorded in the 80's it's not dated by the period if you can get past his matching yellow guitar and sports coat.  Just go get it anyway, you can't regret it.  Gotta love 'The Kid'!",1146700800,2,1428,4.260223048327138
1993918,4,B0001EFTN8,This is a great dvd for someone looking to pickup on the progressive jazz-rock fusion style of Larry Carlton.  His unique guitar style and sound have helped to shape this genre of music.  This is very accessible to any guitar player.,1142899200,,233,4.658536585365853
8011276,5,B0001EFTN8,Great DVd with accompanying booklet. Recommend it to other guitar students.,1428624000,,75,5.909090909090909
8011277,3,B0001EFTN8,"It was ok , not as good as pt. 1.",1424736000,,33,2.4
8011278,5,B0001EFTN8,Item was just as described. Fast service.,1406419200,,41,5.0
8011279,5,B0001EFTN8,"I loved it. If you are into jazz and blues, this DVD is very informative with creative ideas for soloing.",1347235200,,105,4.3
8011280,1,B0001EFTN8,An excellant guitarists. The vidio is for entertaiment purposes. You are not going to learn nothing Carlton goes way to fast. Gilbert Campagna,1283558400,,142,5.217391304347826
8011281,5,B0001EFTN8,"If you are a mid level to advanced player and love jazz/blues guitar, then this is good video. Larry takes his years of expertise and advises on technique and his approach to music. Undoubtably he is one of the great masters of the instrument, and I find myself referring to the dvd time and time again.",1244160000,,303,4.428571428571429
8011282,5,B0001EFTN8,"I'm a professional touring guitarist as well as a clinician, and while this video is somewhat basic for a guitarist that has years of studying under his belt, it is also one of the most useful ones I have seen.  Larry's teaching approach is excellent and clear, and of course his playing is stellar.  But it is the simple tips that he offers that expands one's vocabulary in areas such as creating a more ""jazz"" like sound while sticking close to the pentatonic scales, licks, and simple triad arpeggios that we have played from the beginning (as opposed to completely transforming one's mental approach to the instrument--which one can do with Frank Gambale's more modal approach).  As I find with most videos, if you learn only one useful thing from it, it is an incredible value.  This didn't have a lot of useful things for me, but the few things that it does have make it one of the most valuable DVDs in my collection.  A little can go a long way if the information is good, and here it is great.",1197417600,3,1002,4.483516483516484
8011283,5,B0001EFTN8,"For those of us who wondered how he came up with his sound this is an ""aha!"" experience. This is not just one of those videos that shows flashy playing and then moves on. The explanations make sense and though they are not always simple to follow, they are within reach. It's nice to see that it is explained much more in terms of arpeggios and chords rather than scales since most of us guitar players are much more familiar with chord spelling than we are with mixolydian mode in the key of D or similar jazzspeak. Everything he does is tabbed out in the book that accompanies the DVD and for that someone deserves major props.",1169424000,3,629,4.384615384615385
8011284,5,B0001EFTN8,"Although this is 20 years old and for more advanced players, this is an important video for any guitarist.  Larry's approach to playing and ""flirting with disaster"" is what makes his solos and parts so interesting to hear.  He describes this and gives examples of it with his accompanied playing.  There is a booklet with tab/notation of his parts.  I highly recommend this video.",1169078400,4,380,4.890625
8011285,4,B0001EFTN8,"There's one thing about LARRY CARLTON worth mentioning. Donald Fagen of Steely Dan has called him the quickest study of any of the great guitar players that have graced the Dan's catalogue. He came into the studio and recorded two takes on 'Kid Charlamagne' that were both used. He also did the main solo on 'Don't Take Me Alive'. That's high praise indeed coming from someone who outta know. On this session Larry comes across as personable, yet intense. Wolf Marshall has tabbed out alot of the session but not everything. He shows you super arpeggios and a bit of his triadic approach to jazz/blues soloing. Larry is an immensely gifted guitarist. I personally believe he hears every nuance of every note he plays before he plays it and has an uncanny ability to compose on the spot. These things can not be taught but you could get very inspired by this gentle man genius guitarist.",1151366400,14,886,4.685897435897436
