8540950,5,B009FEED7I,Such a cute movie.  Now as many people wait until later in life to settle down it becomes harder to relate to the Hindi movies where the Hero and Heroine are 18 and 16 years old respectively.  This movie deals with the foibles of dating later in life.,1442966400,,251,4.208333333333333

8540952,4,B009FEED7I,"It was refreshing to see an entertaining movie about real people.  I think sometimes we forget that romance is also possible for those who are 'regular' people over 25.  Also, love does not always present itself in the typical filmy way.  They were really cute together and remembering the movie makes me smile.",1369699200,3,311,4.830188679245283
8540953,5,B009FEED7I,"This movie is too cute and different. The film is different because it is about to middle-aged individuals instead of young people. It shows how real people can meet and fall in love with each other. I am not going to say anymore. If you want to find out what the movie is about, you have to buy it, watch and really see it for what it is. So cute...and funny!",1365984000,,360,4.084507042253521
8540954,5,B009FEED7I,This movie is very well done and the acting is superb. You don't need to be a Bollywood fan to enjoy this movie and it's inherent meaning. It's not the first time this story was told but the Hindi/Parsi angle is works!,1363478400,,218,4.214285714285714
8540955,4,B009FEED7I,Was really pleasantly surprised.. I enjoyed it very much. Had really no expectations prior but it was fun.  Will see it again.,1362614400,,126,4.7272727272727275
8540956,5,B009FEED7I,This is a simply funny movie. It is reality of life and you don't see skimpy dressed skin thin actresses . But infact it shows the reality of life. Very entertaining ... different from any Bollywood production.,1351728000,,210,4.702702702702703
