8218305,5,B000VDOPBG,"I'm extremely conservative, but this is an interesting movie and gives a very different perspective. Also, in all honesty, just a good action movie over all. We purchased it simply because we thought it might be eventually banned in the US.",1364601600,3,240,4.878048780487805
8218306,4,B000VDOPBG,"Contrary to the other review of this movie, I found it to be a compelling presentation of a very different view of US behavior in the Middle East. It lays out a number of themes embraced by many Turks, Arabs and others convinced of US iniquity, Washington's overwhelming power, and America's technological superiority. What emerges is just about every cliche of US and Israeli perfidiousness: the US villain is a master of his craft and consistently outsmarts the hero; Jews are engaged in numerous despicable acts, and there is the token American naif, who dies in trying to live up to his ideals. In short, although the Turkish producers filmed it as a serious movie, the viewer should appreciate its campy story, its hilarious mistakes, but also its frustration over Turkish and Arab failure to play a greater regional role. And the technical quality of the movie is not bad.
The story is based on a true event, but the Turkish role was far more sinister and corrupt than the movie depicts. The humiliation did not lead to suicide, nor did a Turkish special forces team extract revenge. The movie's favorable depiction of Turcomans ignores the interests of the other ethnic groups in the region. These qualifications aside, if you're in for two hours of America-bashing (exemplified by Billy Zane at his worst (or best)), this is your movie. I understand it is one of several Turkish productions feasting on US actions, but this is the only one I have seen.",1309392000,10,1460,4.820717131474104
