3055991,5,B0010YSD68,My daughter hasn't really learned the ABC's from this dvd yet--but she loves the animals and it starting to understand the connection between the animals and the letters!!!! I got some flash cards with ABC's and animals and we use those after she watches the dvd..its very educational and full of cute songs!,1279584000,,308,4.830188679245283
3055992,5,B0010YSD68,"I got this DVD out of the library for my 26 month old.  He loves it and his grandmother (who watches him 3 days a week) keeps insisting I need to buy it for him because it is so wonderful.  We had it for 2 weeks before I had to return it, after about one week my son started walking around the house reciting the alphabet.  He still misses a few letters, but I was still blown away that he had picked up most of the alphabet from this video.",1274659200,,441,3.8777777777777778
3055993,5,B0010YSD68,This is the best Barney video I have seen. My daughter watched this everyday and learned her ABC's before she was 2 using this video. I would recommend this. Your child will definitely benefit from this video.,1268006400,,209,4.675675675675675
3055994,5,B0010YSD68,My 3 year old daughter absolutely love this Barney.  I love it because she learning her ABC's and having fun with all the animals.  She loves this video more than the Barney at the Zoo.  I highly recommend for any one who has a child that loves Barney.  Great songs.,1244246400,,266,4.26
3055995,5,B0010YSD68,I never really liked Barney when my children were growing up. Now that I am a grandmother things do change.  This DVD has a new approach to learning.  Young children could easily learn without even know it.  It also has a special feature of FiFi & the Flowertots.  Dalyla just loves.  So we got 2 for the price of 1.,1243123200,,316,4.2
3055996,5,B0010YSD68,"I am pretty new to Barney, but this is my favorite Barney video of the 5 that I own.  I am kinda confused by the other comment stating there are mostly make-believe animals, since there is only one imaginary animal for all the letters of the alphabet. There are 25 other real animals on the video and a songs for almost every animal.  My son loves this DVD.",1228003200,6,357,4.235294117647059
3055997,2,B0010YSD68,Despite the name and cover there were disappointingly few real animals in this video. Mostly this is just recycled song clips about make-believe animals from the PBS Barney & Friends TV show. As such it's no better and no worse than any of the free episodes on TV.,1209513600,3,264,4.520833333333333
3056023,1,B0010YSD68,This was like a software sale. I thought I was ordering a DVD and this is of no use to me. I CANT GET REFUNDED FOR SOFTWARE B/C.,1401062400,,128,3.607142857142857
3056024,5,B0010YSD68,"This movie teaches both animals and the alphabet.  My 20 month old is hooked and requests this one over and over.  We have tried other Barney movies, but this is always the favorite .  Songs are classic and easy for her to follow along.",1393891200,,236,4.318181818181818
3056025,5,B0010YSD68,"Not a huge fan of the purple dinosaur sensation, but I must say it's a big hit with my 3 year old girl and 18 month old boy.  They sing the ABC's and run around the room pretending to be all of the animals.  Definitely one of the better Barney's!",1392249600,,246,3.9
3056026,5,B0010YSD68,My two year old son likes to watch this over and over and over and over again...he loves animals and is currently trying to learn his abc's so this is a good one for him.,1383091200,,170,3.8857142857142857
3056027,5,B0010YSD68,"My boy can sing with them...it's a good show, nice and basic. I play when I want my boy stop runing",1380672000,2,99,3.761904761904762

3056029,5,B0010YSD68,Excellent for learning ABC's for the little ones that love animals.  Really keep them entertained with the music.  Great show.,1376352000,,126,5.25

3056031,5,B0010YSD68,"Bought this dvd for my 20 month old Granddaughter and it is one of her favorites! She loves so many of the songs and of course, Barney, Baby Bop, BJ and Riff. Especially, likes the doctor song (Vet), ittle lamb (Mary Had a Little Lamb), elephnt (Elephant song) and the bird song. Have to play, play, play first for she would sit and watch this over and over. If your little one appreciates music, I think they would really like this dvd. Good way to learn their abc's too!",1366329600,,472,4.314606741573034
