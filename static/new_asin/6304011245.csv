7858333,5,6304011245,"My 4 year old son loves this video.  We have been checking it out and renewing it from our local library for months, and I'll likely buy it for him as a Christmas gift.  It's just the right length for a child his age (30 min), and he wants to watch it nearly everyday.  It also has some catchy little songs in it, which he likes to sing along to.  I recommend it for the youngest(3-7 yrs) NASCAR/ Stock Car Racing fans.",1099008000,,419,4.073170731707317
7858334,1,6304011245,"Too bad you can't rate a movie with ""zero"" stars...I bought this video for my son who really likes race cars. I thought it would show race cars up close, but I was wrong. During the first 15 or 20 minutes the video follows some old dude (retired racer - I""m not a Nascar expert so maybe this guy is someone famous?) as he takes his granddaughter to a race track to look at racer's trailers, buy a tee-shirt, dance on some tires, etc. You also get to look at some rims and tires and there are some goofy songs about tires, too. Eventually they go into a driver's trailer, who apparantly is the father of one of the kids in the movie, but he's asleep and they have to wake him up. At this point you really haven't seen any good car scenes. By now my patience was exhausted so we put in a movie about trains, and watched that. Overall, a disappointing movie and not recommended. In case you're wondering I threw it out - how do I get my money back?",1096156800,2,945,4.141304347826087
7858335,5,6304011245,"It's hard to kind NASCAR-related videos that are appropriate for kids.  This little gem fills that niche nicely.  Benny Parsons, a former Winston Cup champion, takes his niece to the races, where she interacts with other children (of drivers and crew members), shops for souvenirs, sees the garage area, gets a tour of the inside of a hauler, and watches the race.  The kids in this video are clearly not professional actors, but they are very appealing and easy to watch.  Jessica Waltrip (Darrell's daughter) turns in an especially able performance.  Parsons is affable and he interacts comfortably with the other drivers in a way that is really fun to watch.
This tape was made in the mid-1990's, and for parents who are NASCAR fans, it can be fun to see many familiar drivers (DW, Ken Schrader, Jeff Gordon) looking 10 years younger.  Also, as a note to parents of younger children - although he is not featured in the film, the late Dale Earnhardt's car (and at one point his face) appears frequently throughout the video.  If you have a child who is too young to understand what happened to Big E, but is sharp-eyed and wants to know who drives every car number, be sure you have an explanation at hand that you are comfortable with before you start watching this video.",1079654400,,1276,4.669642857142857
7858336,5,6304011245,"My 3 year-old son has become a huge Nascar fan.  It is great.  It helps him learn number recognition, ordinal numbers and parts of a car.  We found this video and he insists on watching it every day.  The video explores the day of a race car driver.  It explores the many different jobs to get the car ready for a race. The video uses fun songs and is very kid friendly. It discusses safety precautions that drivers use to maintain their safety.  It is overall a fun filled , informative video for even the youngest children.  My son has learned more things then I could have ever imagined.  I myself am not a race car fan",988761600,,622,4.256410256410256
