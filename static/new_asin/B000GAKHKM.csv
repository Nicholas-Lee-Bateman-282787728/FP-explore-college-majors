8129755,5,B000GAKHKM,"This film takes me back, the plot is actually quite good reminding me of ""Lock Up"" which came a few years after this film, and which along with this one and ""Carne de Presidio"" are my three favorite prison movies. This movie is worth the view if you can understand spanish or if you can get a copy with subtitles. Although some people complain about the hastely done 1957 with some anachronic dialogue and the quick transition to the present (somewhere between 1982 and 1984) it is still a good movie, for an independent mexican film, from the 80s no less, when mexican cinema had already entered into the dark ages.",1311379200,,616,4.558558558558558
