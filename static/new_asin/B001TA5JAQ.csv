8340873,5,B001TA5JAQ,"When I first saw this dvd I inicialy didn't like the dated and old fashioned animated graphics but the more I watched it the more I appreciated it as it was made exactly as the scriptures give these stories, of course in simpler language since it is for kids. I bought some very well made animated Bible dvds and were disappointed to see they changed the way the story was given in the Bible so I will give those away and stick to these. The accurate word of God is more important to us when showing Biblical dvds to our child than the type of animation they used.",1248307200,,564,4.231481481481482
8340874,2,B001TA5JAQ,The cartoons in this video are outdated.  Don't buy it.  The voices and the images are made for the 40s and 50s.,1239494400,,112,4.045454545454546
