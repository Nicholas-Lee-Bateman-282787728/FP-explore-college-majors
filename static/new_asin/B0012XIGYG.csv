3099581,5,B0012XIGYG,"Many of the major engineering disasters of the past century are covered.  Each episode provides about 5 disasters and during the 8-10 minutes is provided the effect (disaster), the cause and the solution.  The dvd menu lists each disaster, so one can go quickly to the disasters of their interest.

The episodes included are #4 through #20, plus Hurricane Katrina is provided as a bonus single disaster episode.  Which begs the question, what happened to episodes #1, #2, and #3, as they are not in this set?  These early three episodes were generally an overview containing a wide number of disasters in brief detail.  I suspect, since these episodes were so good, A&E expanded the series to provide much greater detail and limit each succeeding episode to just 5 disasters.

This set also needs an index of every disaster, either on the dvds, or with a paper insert.  I loved the menus as they are so simple and easy to follow, without dumb pictures cluttering the screen.",1240272000,20,974,4.790419161676646
3099582,5,B0012XIGYG,"This has been one of my best DVD purchases; I highly recommend it.

I bought this for my boyfriend who is an engineer and he loves it, and so do I.  I was very surprised and intrigued with the variety of engineering disasters that were presented along with the footage. Some of the best ones I've seen so far were the salt mines (the footage of the barges being sucked towards the whirlpool was unbelievable), the Love Canal, and many of the oil rig disasters.  I also learned that underground salt deposits make great natural propane storage tanks.

In each episode there are multiple stories not just one or two; it is definitely worth the money.",1232409600,12,648,4.560344827586207

3099584,5,B0012XIGYG,"Finally, what I was waiting for: a large collection of case studies (18 episodes in total; at least two disasters in every episode - sometimes as many as six) taken from a large variety of engineering areas. As a chemical engineer and as an instructor, I found this collection very interesting, full of different ""case studies"" and lessons to learn in a very amusing way.

The episodes includes:
- New Orleans: Hurricane Katrina.
- The fire at Las Vegas MGM Hotel.
- The collapse of Seattle's Lacey V. Murrow Floating Bridge.
- The flaw that grounded the first commercial jet.
- An entire lake and the surrounding land are sucked into a Louisiana salt mine.
- Exxon Valdez incident.
- The Ford Explorer/Firestone rollovers.
- The fire on the Piper Alpha offshore oirlig.
- Computer errors that brought the world to the brink of accidental nuclear war.
- The explosion of a jet-fuel plant in Nevada.
- The Union Carbide explosion in India.
- A devastating flood in China that killed 145,000 people.
- Denver baggage system nightmare.
- Patrior missile failure
- etc.

The only drawbacks are that the DVDs come with no closed captions and no subtitles. Thanks HC.",1217376000,58,1161,4.7711442786069655

3099588,5,B0012XIGYG,"I'm an engineer who's involved in failure investigations, and I found this series of video presentations to be outstanding, frankly far exceeding my expectations and hopes, given that it comes from the History Channel rather than a technical organization.

A diverse range of types of systems and failures is included, the graphics and historical footage are very useful, experts are routinely consulted to explain each failure, and appropriate lessons are drawn from the failures in terms of both technical and human factors.

No, the presentations aren't perfect.  Sometimes the explanations are oversimplified, important details are omitted, and terminology is incorrect.  But overall, the strengths of this series still dwarf these weaknesses.

I know of no comparable resource, and the best endorsement I can make is to note that I've started incorporating these videos into the continuing education program in my engineering firm.  They're good enough that professionals can benefit from them.  Yet, at the same time, they're also accessible for interested laypeople, which is no small accomplishment.

8248204,5,B0012XIGYG,Movies were in great condition and there is a ton of content. We use them as safety topics for our company,1430611200,,106,4.095238095238095
8248205,5,B0012XIGYG,"I am an airline pilot and have taught safety courses in a professional aviation environment; I have also been a production manager at a chemical processing facility. In both of these professional venues I have striven to understand safety implications of systems, procedures, human factors, and process design and implementation (as an aside, for anyone serious about chemical processing or industrial safety, I recommend the collected works of Trevor Kletz.) ""Modern Marvels: Engineering Disasters"" is a very good series dealing with technical and engineering failures (and the hubris and overconfidence often associated with them) in a variety of industries and historical settings.

The five DVD set oddly starts with episode four (I don't know where one through three went) and presents a number of fascinating failures, some of which have fairly obvious causes, and many of which were difficult to completely understand and required months or even years of intense investigation (e.g. the Boeing 737 rudder hardover crashes.) Most episodes contain multiple incidents (though the Hurricane Katrina special is an exception.) I am most familiar with the accidents in the aviation and process industries, although I have a passing familiarity with maritime accidents as well. As such it's natural that I notice the detail errors and generalizations in aviation analyses more than in other fields, but am sure those in the construction or architectural fields would be more familiar with other accidents (e.g. the Kansas City Hyatt Walkway collapse.) As for the flaws, the series definitely has them, though most are small visual errors induced by inappropriate use of stock footage (e.g. showing a Mercury-Redstone and calling it a Soviet rocket, discussing a Boeing 727 crash and showing an L-1011, discussing a Boeing 727 takeoff warning malfunction and showing the fire warning test on a Boeing 737, etc.) or generalizations designed to make the discussion more accessible to the layman. The THY DC-10 and 737 rudder hardover episodes (16 and 19, respectively,) are especially loaded with inappropriate stock footage. While professionals might notice these errors, they don't actually distract from the theme of the analysis and make no real difference as to the conclusions reached. My only point would be that attention to detail is intrinsic to safety, but there's no excuse for sloppy editing and research either when correct footage is easily located. Sometimes I did question the choice of an interview subject, e.g. why is Peter Garrison, a noted General Aviation writer, chosen to comment on airliner accidents? I have nothing against Mr. Garrison and have read many of his columns, but there are more authoritative airliner experts readily available. Likewise it's hard to believe that a Greenpeace representative is totally unbiased in presenting information on the ""Torrey Canyon"" oil spill. I am not taking issue with any particular statement made, but it is important to present unbiased viewpoints in accident investigations. Despite these issues which are of relatively small concern from an investigatory perspective, the Payne Stewart Learjet accident was very poorly explained and the terminology involving aircraft oxygen and pressurization systems is extremely subpar for the series, and could easily lead a layman to draw incorrect conclusions about the accident. Given the large number of aircraft accidents in the set, though, on balance I found the coverage of aerospace-related subjects to be good overall. Certainly this is a series that could be useful and thought-provoking for engineers and especially engineering students, but anyone with an interest in design or operations safety would find the information here to be worthwhile. Oddly one of the disasters, the Baldwin Hills Dam episode, is repeated in two separate shows.

Of all the episodes, I found the following the most compelling: episode six on the ""Piper Alpha"" and episode eight on the ""Ocean Ranger"" oil rigs, episode 11 on the Hyatt walkway collapse, and episode 16 which covered both the THY DC-10 and the ""Torrey Canyon"" disasters (the autopilot issue on the ""Torrey Canyon"" was especially well explained.) While I have detailed a few minor faults with the series, I have repeatedly stressed that overall this is a very good set and is a great set for engineers, safety professionals, and anyone interested in technological safety to view and contemplate. Well done, History Channel!",1424822400,2,4484,5.376955903271693
