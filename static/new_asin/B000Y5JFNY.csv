3013269,5,B000Y5JFNY,"Such a classic movie. I rented on a rainy day because my boyfriend (20 something) had never seen the film before, and he LOVED it. He was singing the tunes all day and raved about it to his roommates. Hey, if you can get a dude to A. sit through the whole film (it is a long one), and B. like a musical film, you've got a winner on your hands. There's something about Julie Andrews that is timeless and relatable. Beyond the acting and the singing, the storyline is interesting! It addresses Austria's involvement in the World Wars, which is a really cool feature. If you haven't seen it already, or if you're looking for a great nostalgic film, this is your movie.",1464825600,,665,4.370967741935484

Every time we watch it, my husband comments, ""Julie Andrews really has one of the most beautiful voices of all time."" The songs are so fun to sing any time and the story is engaging.

Doesn't shy away from the realities of the Nazis nor the typical fantasy musical scenes.

Julie Andrews was born for this role and this is her in her prime as an actor and singer.",1522886400,,468,4.517647058823529

3013487,5,B000Y5JFNY,"First off let me say this has been my all time favorite movie since I was taken to it at 3 years old, and our local theater played this every year until its first TV showing on February 29, 1976. I am not going to review the movie and story because most reviews here cover that (almost 5,000 of them) and it's all a 5 out of 5. The story, the people who made the film, in my opinion ended up bringing us the best motion picture ever made. Everything that was done in all stages of production was just absolutely perfect.

Here is where my problem comes in with the 45th and 50th anniversary editions (which as far as quality are the same, the same restoration).

 This is indeed a new complete remaster of the film and the clarity of everything is A-1. The details have NEVER looked sharper or more clear. Except all of the colors are wrong. Not many would notice this unless they are film purists or those who have seen this in the theaters from 1965 to the big reissue in 1973 would notice it (and have noticed it if you read the forums on blu-ray.com, Home Theater Forum and other film sites). The movie has been remastered about 10 times since VHS, every time it was different, and this is the only version that has the color palette it does. Everything is now in brown tones and many of the blue colors have been removed. This is not how the movie ever played in theaters. Even the director Robert Wise, who had complete control over the laserdisc box set, even his version is totally different in color.

 I hope when the 55th anniversary edition comes out, probably in 4k too, they restore it to its original colors. Way too much brown and beige. They changed the colors of the walls in the Trapp villa, and Julie Andrews hair changes from blond to a deep orange many times in the film. Please if you have ANY of the previous editions, check this out and compare colors. As I said the clarity and detail are fantastic, I don't know what resource was used to match colors, I don't think there was one. Plus the sound has been filtered on the high end to get rid of the tape hiss. Remember in 1965 there was no Dolby noise reduction, so there is a natural hiss in the sound. It has been removed here, but in doing that, all of the high end sound  from sound effects to musical instruments has been removed. Listen to the 40th anniversary edition and hear the rich high end tones (bells, strings, horns), they are gone on the blu-ray and 45th/50th anniversary editions. Why would this be done? Because studios today aim these releases at younger audiences who buy discs, and they are used to digital sound and ndemand no tape hiss. So they remove it to make it sound ""digital"" but in doing this they remove some of the original signal. If you watch the extra on the sound restoration, you can see the guy clipping off everything above a certain line. This my friends is the high end of the sound where the tape hiss is located, but also some of the sound from the movie, the highest frequencies of the orchestra and sound effects.  This edition is really good, the extras are incredible, but these 2 things are way off and thus being my all time favorite movie, I don't get the highest enjoyment from watching this knowing what they did. Hollywood has done this to many movies.

For this version, for the first time they used the original 6 track stereo master. For the first time they had the tools to be able to use it as I have read that it is quite worn. Trouble is, it must have had alot of tape hiss, because they removed it. If you listen to the soundtrack CD that came with the laserdisc, this used the 6 track master, but you can clearly hear that tape hiss. I would rather have the tape hiss there and hear the high frequencies of the music than have it taken away. The most accurate version (color and sound) is the 40th anniversary DVD, why they changed all the colors and cut off the high end sounds is beyond me.

I will never give this movie anything but the highest rating, I just thought people should know that there were some alterations done and they were not for the better. As great as this looks and sounds, it is not what played in cinemas during its original or 1973 reissue. 20th Century Fox PLEASE correct this for the 4k version, probably due in a few years on the 55th anniversary!",1519344000,,4314,4.3424317617866

It's a musical, but like ""Fiddler On the Roof,"" it tells the often unheard story of the people of Germany and Austria that wanted nothing to do with Hitler's war machine. Great music sung by a very talented cast. Underneath all the turmoil, there is the inner turmoil of a military man who runs his family like an ships captain and his new nanny that brings the joy of music and childhood back to his house. And of course there is the ""other woman,"" to add a little something to the romantic aspect. Well worth watching on so many levels",1518048000,,573,4.314814814814815
3013505,5,B000Y5JFNY,"This is such a charming movie that the plot is almost lost...almost.

The plot is that of a family man choosing to walk away from all his worldly possessions for the sole (soul) purpose of NOT joining the Nazis.  He follows his moral compass firmly, refusing to take part on any level in hurting the innocent, and without a moment's hesitation treks off with his family into an unknown future with nothing but his family and the clothes on their backs.

This movie offers us an opportunity to examine what it would take for us, the viewer, to do the same thing if we ever found ourselves in a situation where our jobs depended on us looking the other way or enabling a predator to harm the innocent for selfish purposes.  It's something you really have to prepare for.  More and more, we see in the new these days, the teams of enablers that support predators who get away with ""murder"" for decades before anyone has the balls to blow a whistle...i don't get it.

This is just a movie.  The true story is quite different.  But still a Great movie and it's also great to see, in the news, so many people standing up for themselves and others who are not able to defend themselves.  Let's hope it continues.

....and if YOU are the predator or enabler- stop today and make it the first day of the rest of your life.  Peope will support your selfless change.",1517961600,5,1355,4.423387096774194

3013544,5,B000Y5JFNY,first off let me say that this is the Blu-ray that I bought not the DVD Amazon has a nasty habit of letting people review movies that are watching them on VHS or even on their video streaming service almost never can tell which format they're reviewing  I bought the Blu-ray the price was certainly right or this classic  this is the first time it's been affordable. Okay The first time I saw this movie was on a one of the largest screens in the country I live in Houston it was at a place called The Windsor Cinerama the way ahead of its time I saw 2001 there's as well and it was quite an experience The system that they were playing it on was 200 watts per Channel and in this particular theater there were 32 channels in total it seemed that there was a speaker for every voice on the screen the seem to be custom made for this particular kind of movie the sound on this movie was beyond expectation and it really made an impression on me at the time this for this Blu-ray movie it is exactly as I remembered it I found myself smiling a lot while watching if the first time again the transfer of this movie is Flawless absolutely flawless if you're wondering about that do not hold back this is an absolutely excellent picture I've seen 4K discs not look like this good now as for the story if you haven't seen it the cinematography alone is worth the price of admission Rodgers and Hammerstein really hit it out of the park with this one I don't usually like musicals but this one won me over if you have seen it see it again this is the perfect format for getting intimate with this movie I don't know any other way to put it besides picturing yourself being able to sit down in your own home and relax and finding yourself smiling as much as I did when you watche it this movie is a genuine pleasure and even those of you who think that it's a little corny and you're over it so to  will find yourself thinking differently after you've seen it especially in a home theater situation I had friends with me the first time I showed right after it arrived and no one felt they wanted to see it they even growned a little when I insisted but after the first 5 minutes their dissatisfaction soon faded away and I found them smiling as much as I did everyone enjoyed it you will too it's a great price you can't beat the price at $11 Amazon delivered it on time and intact and on time this new one day shipping for qualified orders is really nice way to go Amazon thank you very much for taking the time to read this review and I really appreciate it thank you Amazon for putting it up at a reasonable price I finally can afford it and it turned out to be very much as I remembered it on the first time I saw it made such an impression on me that's going some,1515283200,,2760,4.1551401869158875

3013583,5,B000Y5JFNY,I bought this not too long ago when I realized my kids had never seen it. It made for a great afternoon activity and the blu-ray version looked probably as good as it can considering the age. I'm very happy with the purchase and it was a lot of fun to teach all of the songs to my kids. I noticed days after we watched the movie that they were still singing the songs without realizing it.,1511740800,,389,4.064935064935065

The visuals without CGI, are so perfectly executed with the music, you become entranced. Then there is the chemistry of Andrews and Plummer which was as powerful as I have ever seen between two actors. They were the perfect fit.. I remember my mom took me to see it and she would hum all the tunes to herself, for months after. Although there are many other films that are considered superior and it is not my favorite, I have to concede that this the one PERFECT film.",1508371200,,586,4.385321100917431

The extras in the set are real gems, especially the music box and postcards, all of which have a great quality feel, not cheap like other collectible extras you sometimes see.

3013751,5,B000Y5JFNY,"The Sound of Music is an adaptation of Rodgers and Hammerstein's stage musical of the same name. It follows Maria, a free-spirited young woman studying to become a nun in an abbey in Austria, who is sent to the villa of a retired naval officer to be the governess of his seven children.

Most reviews focus on the quality of the film itself, but I'm going to write about the disc quality. The detail in this disc is amazing, even by today's standards, the colors are well saturated, the sound is great too, and the special features, which include commentaries by Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer and director Robert Wise, a sing-along of all the songs in the film and an extra disc with an hour-long documentary of Julie Andrews going back to Selzburg 50 years after the release of the film.

If you are a fan of the film, I recommend that you buy this disc right now, you won't regret it",1500249600,,890,4.487654320987654

3014000,5,B000Y5JFNY,"The love story happened before The Second World War. Maria became family teacher for a Captains seven children. The strict Captain treated them just as solider, told them obey but not love. After his wife died, he paid little attention to who were longing for the fathers love.
  Maria loved children by heart and soul, even when they made mistakes. She used music to solve everything. She used behavior from herself to tech them lots of beautiful thing, how to love god, how to mercy, how to improve themselves, how to be a lovely kid.
  What she bring home not only music but also happy and love. Captain found himself fell in love again. He found his children were so lovely so he began to do more things for the family. At that time, the Germany invaded into Austria, Captain refused to work for the bad government, so they decide to go abroad. But the enemy found their purpose and caught them on the way. family became more tight and close than ever did.  At the end of the story, the whole family escaped from their homeland when the public interpret ended.
  Maria was a sweet girl, who also had a sweet sound. Of cause it was just some kind of day dream. So another point here was the shadow of war. Although the war did happen in story, we could feel the nervous environment from.
  The captain was a critical character. Though the film said he was a patriot, but during the story, he did nothing serious things to help his homeland except struggle for a flag. In my eyes, it was no use when our country was in danger. What we can do was not only struggle for a flag but for more useful just like power, land and so on. He had a big fortune and a good fame once sing a song or hung a flag he was a patriot, it was too easy!",1486598400,,1733,4.259146341463414

3014086,5,B000Y5JFNY,"How do you solve a problem like the Nazis? By becoming the von Trapp Family Singers and hoodwinking the SS with your floral costume and
Patriotic songs, of course, however much it may be ridiculed - its status as a Christmas TV film is legendary - there's no denying that this is one of the best screen musicals ever made. As Maria, the lapsed nun who becomes governess to the von Trapp brood and weds their rather chilly papa (Plummer) before helping them outrun the Nazis, Andrews exudes a vibrancy that's hard to resist. But the real secret of the film's success lays in its brilliant songs ('Do-Re-Mi', 'Edelweiss', 'The Lonely Goatherd', 'and My Favorite Things'), every one of them is a toe-tapping classic which will buzz around your head for days. So, ignore those reservations and enjoy. Escapist films about, well, escaping; don't come any better than this.
Verdict a film virtually immune to criticism, The Sound Of Music delights and repels with the sureness of Marmite.",1484784000,,982,4.851190476190476

All I have to say is mine came with a redeem code for Ultra Violet (VUDU).  Originally I didn't purchase the version that was available on VUDU only because it wasn't the 50th anniversary version.  I hate owning physical copies as I prefer digital copies.  So, with a heavy heart, I purchased this one from Amazon.  Once I opened it and saw the FREE redeem code, I simply followed the 3 step process to redeem the code, and WAALAAAH now I have the 50th anniversary edition of the Sound of Music (this exact one), along with the featurette on my VUDU account, online!!!!!!!!!  This copy was NOT available before, but it's in my account, FREE.

3014225,5,B000Y5JFNY,I grew up watching a truncated version of this movie on TV as it was broadcasted every year around the holidays.  I bought this digital version for my own kid to enjoy and boy do they love it.  We've watched it (not all of it) almost every day since last week.  I did notice however that there is a section (and I only noticed it in this section so far) that is where Maria's voice is out-of-sync.  It's the part where she begins to teach the children how to sing with the song Do-Re-Mi up on the hill with her guitar.  Anyone else notice that?  Is it just a bad digital copy that Amazon has?,1482883200,,592,4.104347826086957

As far as musicals go, ""The Sound of Music"" is one of the best musicals there is, and it still holds up well despite being an older movie. This is a movie that the entire family can enjoy, since at its heart it is the story of a family healing and sticking together. The cold captain thaws and stops being the emotionally distant and strict father he was to his 7 children (after his wife's death), thanks to Maria's influence. Maria also grows as a character, and learns to face the difficulties that come her way (after being hired as a babysitter for the captain's children), and learns to live her life after being sheltered at a convent. Then there are the children, who want their family back. Overall this is a classic musical, that makes for great family entertainment.

My mom's best friend had lent me her DVD, I watched it once and then returned it to her and I cannot believe I still do not have it in my collection yet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Even when I was 11 years old and one day I was browsing around my local Blockbuster Video store (back when those were still functioning) I saw the VHS for sale and I did not even have my first DVD player yet and wanted to buy the VHS anyway because it was a movie I have been wanting for ages, but something was telling me that I might be getting my first DVD player real soon and this was a movie that I would might consider buying as one of my first DVD's. I just bought the 50th Anniversary Edition DVD along with a bunch of other movies as a gift for my sister and I am going to give it to her for her birthday coming up in another week I know that she'll really enjoy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GREAT FAMILY MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Update for 12/15/2016 I finally bought my own copy of this timeless classic and gave it to myself as an early Christmas gift & I cannot wait to enjoy it once again with my family while I am home for the Christmas break!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1479859200,,1306,4.203187250996016

The video quality ranges from fair to good, but never great. There is a lot of artifacting, of the dancing dots variety, especially in flesh toned areas. Also, the color looks like it's been darkened a bit and ""enhanced"", leaving it a bit over saturated, almost as though the movie has been colorized from a grayscale source, which it definitely was not.",1478995200,,421,4.613333333333333

3014407,5,B000Y5JFNY,"The Sound of Music is one of my all-time favorite movies. I grew up watching it on VHS with my family, back in the day where the movie was on two separate tapes and switching over to the second tape was the perfect intermission. I realized I didn't have it in my movie collection for some reason and, with the recent and sad passing of Charmian Carr, who played Liesl Von Trapp, I decided it was a great time to purchase it. Besides the beautiful singing, great acting, and amazing scenery, another reason I love this movie is because I was fortunate enough to visit Salzburg, Austria over 20 years ago. My family and I got to visit many of the scenes from the movie which is one of the reasons I love this movie so much.

The Sound of Music is based on the true story of the Von Trapp Family Singers. It was filmed in 1965 and the movie takes place in the late 1930s in Salzburg, Austria before the start of World War II. Fraulein Maria, played by Julie Andrews, is a headstrong, spunky postulant at an abbey. The Reverend Mother decides to send her to the home of Captain Von Trapp to become the new governess to his seven children. Captain Von Trapp, played by Christopher Plummer, runs a tight ship and expects his children to stick to a rigid schedule whereas Maria feels children should run and play. Maria loves to sing so there is a lot of singing in the movie and they are songs to which I've always remembered the words and it's fun to sing along with the movie.

I loved watching this movie after a long time and it was even better than I remember! This time, I was watching it from an adult's perspective and noticed things I hadn't seen before. The Sound of Music is a musical by Rodgers and Hammerstein and there is plenty of history as well as a love story. At 175 minutes, it's a long movie but there is still a couple minute intermission in the middle which is very convenient for a bathroom break. It is shown in color and can be watched in English Dolby Digital 5.1, English Dolby Surround 4.0, Spanish Dolby Surround and French Dolby Surround. It is rated G and I would love to show it to my kids someday once they have longer attention spans. This is the 50th Anniversary Edition and contains an optional sing-along track, a music machine sing-along and a Sound of Music Tour. The only regret I have is not buying it in Blu-Ray since the scenery is so gorgeous and that version would be more vibrant but the DVD is wonderful as well.

I love this movie and am so glad I finally own it (and it's not VHS!). If you also grew up watching this movie and have yet to own it, I'd recommend buying it since I feel it's money worth spent. We also purchased a copy for my mom since she loves this movie. Julie Andrews is one of my favorite actresses and she does a phenomenal job in the role of Maria. I love having this movie in my collection and recommend it to anyone who is a fan! So Long, Farewell!",1477094400,,2915,4.2771739130434785

I'm not a big fan of musicals. There's only a few that I like overall. But this is a classic movie that can't possibly be remade to match the original's emotion, charm, and talent. It has its romantic side but has its moments of wit along with the underlying serious issue. Great movie for all ages, even if you don't like musicals.
I bought the digital copy of this movie which has extra time at the end about the making of it. Outstanding quality! I was hesitant about buying it first and not renting it. I always rent movies first to see if I like it. I'm so glad that I bought it! By the way, Amazon has a great price for this movie.
I could go on and on about how amazing this film is...but watch and find out for yourself! You won't be disappointed! I surely wasn't. Bottom line: I recommend this movie to anyone!",1475020800,,1160,4.301369863013699

3014528,5,B000Y5JFNY,"The Sound of Music is one of my favorite movies - I know that not everyone likes musicals or older movies, but they should see this at least once.  The story is pretty well-known, so there's no need to discuss the plot.  This is a feel-good movie for the most part because most of the events are happy and the sad scenes don't last too long.  The ending is not happy when you consider the steep price that Max and the nuns would have paid (not shown) and the fact that the family has lost everything.  If you don't already have the Blu-ray version you'll want to purchase this since the picture is much clearer than the DVD version (I've seen both), but if you already have the Blu-ray version you probably don't need to spend the extra money for yet another re-release of the same movie.",1471910400,,788,4.340136054421769

It would then air again annually on NBC but only 1 more time unedited.  It was later cut by 30 minutes.

Now if you are looking for a blu-ray version of this then beware that the 50th anniversary edition  . It is the same transfer that the Blu-Rays  45th Anniversary and that fine.  The packaging makes you think this is an all new restoration and transfer.

3014595,5,B000Y5JFNY,"Robert Wise wanted to make it perfectly clear that he was not making a documentary or a realistic movie about the von Trapp family.  He approached the project with complete dramatic freedom in order to produce a fine and moving film that the von Trapp family could be proud of.  But serious liberties were taken.  This is the problem you face when you sell your story to someone to do with as they please.

Hard to believe, but at the time of its release some highly intellectual critics were exceedingly vicious in their reviews, referring to it as romantic nonsense and sentiment, artificial, icky sticky, and cozy-cum-corny.  Naturally, it was a big hit.  Definitely one of my favorite films, it never fails to cheer me up every time I watch it (okay, maybe not the part with the Nazis).

3014618,5,B000Y5JFNY,"A couple of weeks ago, I watched The Sound of Music for perhaps the umpteenth time since I first saw it in a theater way back in 1965. With my love for good old-fashioned musicals, I have  always ranked this film very high on my Top 10 list of all-time favorite movies.

For those not familiar with The Sound of Music, the film is based on the famous Rodgers and Hammerstein Broadway musical also entitled The Sound of Music. The play was based on Maria von Trapps memoir The Story of the Trapp Family Singers.

The Sound of Music is set in Austria during the years before the Nazis took over the country in 1938. Maria is an undisciplined, high-spirited novice at a convent. The convents Mother Superior sends Maria to work as a governess in the home of Captain von Trapp, a wealthy retired naval officer. Marias job is to care for von Trapps six unruly children. She and von Trapp sharply disagree on how to discipline the children. Von Trapp believes in strict, military style discipline, while Maria thinks an open, caring approach is better. The Sound of Music shows how Maria and von Trapp resolve their differences and form a loving family unit.

The Sound of Musics stars include Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer, Peggy Wood, Richard Hayden, and Eleanor Parker. It has some of the best acting and most entertaining musical numbers Ive ever seen in a movie.

Over the years, I have watched The Sound of Music in nearly every home video format  videocassette (both Betamax and VHS), DVD, and Blu-ray. Until now, Ive found home video editions of this film disappointing. They always seemed to feature grainy and colorless video that displayed dust, dirt, and other flaws found in the original films. The videocassette versions were particularly bad, and DVD releases were only somewhat better.

When I first watched The Sound of Music 45th Anniversary Edition in 2010, I could immediately see that the film had been completely restored.  The high definition 1080p video quality is astounding from the very first frame. Colors are vivid and accurate, images are sharp and detailed, and film grain is natural but unobtrusive. There isn't any banding, crushing, dirt, speckles, or other flaws  anywhere to be seen. The lossless DTS Master Audio 7.1 soundtrack is rich and robust.

The 45th Anniversary edition of The Sound of Music is a three-disc combo-pack that contains a copy of the restored film on both Blu-ray disc and DVD. Theres a third disc that contains a wide variety of  outstanding bonus features. If youve never seen The Sound of Music in true high definition, or if you're simply  looking to upgrade to the best possible home video version, this edition is the one to get.

It may be corny or smarmy to some, too wholesome and pure for the realists among us.  Yet the characters are constantly adjusting their sails and steering by the heavens - the anecdotal definition of realists.  And, they do it robustly with great joy while singing!

In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!

3247984,5,B000Y5JFNY,"First off let me say this has been my all time favorite movie since I was taken to it at 3 years old, and our local theater played this every year until its first TV showing on February 29, 1976. I am not going to review the movie and story because most reviews here cover that (almost 5,000 of them) and it's all a 5 out of 5. The story, the people who made the film, in my opinion ended up bringing us the best motion picture ever made. Everything that was done in all stages of production was just absolutely perfect.

Here is where my problem comes in with the 45th and 50th anniversary editions (which as far as quality are the same, the same restoration).

 This is indeed a new complete remaster of the film and the clarity of everything is A-1. The details have NEVER looked sharper or more clear. Except all of the colors are wrong. Not many would notice this unless they are film purists or those who have seen this in the theaters from 1965 to the big reissue in 1973 would notice it (and have noticed it if you read the forums on blu-ray.com, Home Theater Forum and other film sites). The movie has been remastered about 10 times since VHS, every time it was different, and this is the only version that has the color palette it does. Everything is now in brown tones and many of the blue colors have been removed. This is not how the movie ever played in theaters. Even the director Robert Wise, who had complete control over the laserdisc box set, even his version is totally different in color.

 I hope when the 55th anniversary edition comes out, probably in 4k too, they restore it to its original colors. Way too much brown and beige. They changed the colors of the walls in the Trapp villa, and Julie Andrews hair changes from blond to a deep orange many times in the film. Please if you have ANY of the previous editions, check this out and compare colors. As I said the clarity and detail are fantastic, I don't know what resource was used to match colors, I don't think there was one. Plus the sound has been filtered on the high end to get rid of the tape hiss. Remember in 1965 there was no Dolby noise reduction, so there is a natural hiss in the sound. It has been removed here, but in doing that, all of the high end sound  from sound effects to musical instruments has been removed. Listen to the 40th anniversary edition and hear the rich high end tones (bells, strings, horns), they are gone on the blu-ray and 45th/50th anniversary editions. Why would this be done? Because studios today aim these releases at younger audiences who buy discs, and they are used to digital sound and ndemand no tape hiss. So they remove it to make it sound ""digital"" but in doing this they remove some of the original signal. If you watch the extra on the sound restoration, you can see the guy clipping off everything above a certain line. This my friends is the high end of the sound where the tape hiss is located, but also some of the sound from the movie, the highest frequencies of the orchestra and sound effects.  This edition is really good, the extras are incredible, but these 2 things are way off and thus being my all time favorite movie, I don't get the highest enjoyment from watching this knowing what they did. Hollywood has done this to many movies.

For this version, for the first time they used the original 6 track stereo master. For the first time they had the tools to be able to use it as I have read that it is quite worn. Trouble is, it must have had alot of tape hiss, because they removed it. If you listen to the soundtrack CD that came with the laserdisc, this used the 6 track master, but you can clearly hear that tape hiss. I would rather have the tape hiss there and hear the high frequencies of the music than have it taken away. The most accurate version (color and sound) is the 40th anniversary DVD, why they changed all the colors and cut off the high end sounds is beyond me.

I will never give this movie anything but the highest rating, I just thought people should know that there were some alterations done and they were not for the better. As great as this looks and sounds, it is not what played in cinemas during its original or 1973 reissue. 20th Century Fox PLEASE correct this for the 4k version, probably due in a few years on the 55th anniversary!",1519344000,,4314,4.3424317617866

3248001,5,B000Y5JFNY,"A must see for lovers of the genre. It's a musical, but like ""Fiddler On the Roof,"" it tells the often unheard story of the people of Germany and Austria that wanted nothing to do with Hitler's war machine. Great music sung by a very talented cast. Underneath all the turmoil, there is the inner turmoil of a military man who runs his family like an ships captain and his new nanny that brings the joy of music and childhood back to his house. And of course there is the ""other woman,"" to add a little something to the romantic aspect. Well worth watching on so many levels",1518048000,,573,4.314814814814815
3248002,5,B000Y5JFNY,"This is such a charming movie that the plot is almost lost...almost.

The plot is that of a family man choosing to walk away from all his worldly possessions for the sole (soul) purpose of NOT joining the Nazis.  He follows his moral compass firmly, refusing to take part on any level in hurting the innocent, and without a moment's hesitation treks off with his family into an unknown future with nothing but his family and the clothes on their backs.

This movie offers us an opportunity to examine what it would take for us, the viewer, to do the same thing if we ever found ourselves in a situation where our jobs depended on us looking the other way or enabling a predator to harm the innocent for selfish purposes.  It's something you really have to prepare for.  More and more, we see in the new these days, the teams of enablers that support predators who get away with ""murder"" for decades before anyone has the balls to blow a whistle...i don't get it.

This is just a movie.  The true story is quite different.  But still a Great movie and it's also great to see, in the news, so many people standing up for themselves and others who are not able to defend themselves.  Let's hope it continues.

....and if YOU are the predator or enabler- stop today and make it the first day of the rest of your life.  Peope will support your selfless change.",1517961600,5,1355,4.423387096774194

This is the first time I sprang for the rental to show this classic to my girls (who were dying to see Do-Re-Mi for real). Worth the $3 rental for a quality mommy-daughter movie night with an old fave. But seriously, Amazon.

3248041,5,B000Y5JFNY,first off let me say that this is the Blu-ray that I bought not the DVD Amazon has a nasty habit of letting people review movies that are watching them on VHS or even on their video streaming service almost never can tell which format they're reviewing  I bought the Blu-ray the price was certainly right or this classic  this is the first time it's been affordable. Okay The first time I saw this movie was on a one of the largest screens in the country I live in Houston it was at a place called The Windsor Cinerama the way ahead of its time I saw 2001 there's as well and it was quite an experience The system that they were playing it on was 200 watts per Channel and in this particular theater there were 32 channels in total it seemed that there was a speaker for every voice on the screen the seem to be custom made for this particular kind of movie the sound on this movie was beyond expectation and it really made an impression on me at the time this for this Blu-ray movie it is exactly as I remembered it I found myself smiling a lot while watching if the first time again the transfer of this movie is Flawless absolutely flawless if you're wondering about that do not hold back this is an absolutely excellent picture I've seen 4K discs not look like this good now as for the story if you haven't seen it the cinematography alone is worth the price of admission Rodgers and Hammerstein really hit it out of the park with this one I don't usually like musicals but this one won me over if you have seen it see it again this is the perfect format for getting intimate with this movie I don't know any other way to put it besides picturing yourself being able to sit down in your own home and relax and finding yourself smiling as much as I did when you watche it this movie is a genuine pleasure and even those of you who think that it's a little corny and you're over it so to  will find yourself thinking differently after you've seen it especially in a home theater situation I had friends with me the first time I showed right after it arrived and no one felt they wanted to see it they even growned a little when I insisted but after the first 5 minutes their dissatisfaction soon faded away and I found them smiling as much as I did everyone enjoyed it you will too it's a great price you can't beat the price at $11 Amazon delivered it on time and intact and on time this new one day shipping for qualified orders is really nice way to go Amazon thank you very much for taking the time to read this review and I really appreciate it thank you Amazon for putting it up at a reasonable price I finally can afford it and it turned out to be very much as I remembered it on the first time I saw it made such an impression on me that's going some,1515283200,,2760,4.1551401869158875

Then there is the chemistry of Andrews and Plummer which was as powerful as I have ever seen between two actors. They were the perfect fit.. I remember my mom took me to see it and she would hum all the tunes to herself, for months after.

The extras in the set are real gems, especially the music box and postcards, all of which have a great quality feel, not cheap like other collectible extras you sometimes see.

3248248,5,B000Y5JFNY,"The Sound of Music is an adaptation of Rodgers and Hammerstein's stage musical of the same name. It follows Maria, a free-spirited young woman studying to become a nun in an abbey in Austria, who is sent to the villa of a retired naval officer to be the governess of his seven children.

Most reviews focus on the quality of the film itself, but I'm going to write about the disc quality. The detail in this disc is amazing, even by today's standards, the colors are well saturated, the sound is great too, and the special features, which include commentaries by Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer and director Robert Wise, a sing-along of all the songs in the film and an extra disc with an hour-long documentary of Julie Andrews going back to Selzburg 50 years after the release of the film.

If you are a fan of the film, I recommend that you buy this disc right now, you won't regret it",1500249600,,890,4.487654320987654

As a matter of fact I hate musicals however this is a complete classic, even if in some points the story is too sweet, that is part of the charm of this movie and of course the landscapes of Salzburg are stunning!!! Great performances of all the cast, Julie Andrews in her best moment and Cristopher Plummer doing a great job as the former Austro Hungarian Navy Captain Ritter VonTrapp. A must buy for all the lovers of the musicals and even for those who are no huge fans of this gender!!!",1487721600,,507,4.347368421052631

3248497,5,B000Y5JFNY,"The love story happened before The Second World War. Maria became family teacher for a Captains seven children. The strict Captain treated them just as solider, told them obey but not love. After his wife died, he paid little attention to who were longing for the fathers love.
  Maria loved children by heart and soul, even when they made mistakes. She used music to solve everything. She used behavior from herself to tech them lots of beautiful thing, how to love god, how to mercy, how to improve themselves, how to be a lovely kid.
  What she bring home not only music but also happy and love. Captain found himself fell in love again. He found his children were so lovely so he began to do more things for the family. At that time, the Germany invaded into Austria, Captain refused to work for the bad government, so they decide to go abroad. But the enemy found their purpose and caught them on the way. family became more tight and close than ever did.  At the end of the story, the whole family escaped from their homeland when the public interpret ended.
  Maria was a sweet girl, who also had a sweet sound. Of cause it was just some kind of day dream. So another point here was the shadow of war. Although the war did happen in story, we could feel the nervous environment from.
  The captain was a critical character. Though the film said he was a patriot, but during the story, he did nothing serious things to help his homeland except struggle for a flag. In my eyes, it was no use when our country was in danger. What we can do was not only struggle for a flag but for more useful just like power, land and so on. He had a big fortune and a good fame once sing a song or hung a flag he was a patriot, it was too easy!",1486598400,,1733,4.259146341463414

3248583,5,B000Y5JFNY,"How do you solve a problem like the Nazis? By becoming the von Trapp Family Singers and hoodwinking the SS with your floral costume and
Patriotic songs, of course, however much it may be ridiculed - its status as a Christmas TV film is legendary - there's no denying that this is one of the best screen musicals ever made. As Maria, the lapsed nun who becomes governess to the von Trapp brood and weds their rather chilly papa (Plummer) before helping them outrun the Nazis, Andrews exudes a vibrancy that's hard to resist. But the real secret of the film's success lays in its brilliant songs ('Do-Re-Mi', 'Edelweiss', 'The Lonely Goatherd', 'and My Favorite Things'), every one of them is a toe-tapping classic which will buzz around your head for days. So, ignore those reservations and enjoy. Escapist films about, well, escaping; don't come any better than this.
Verdict a film virtually immune to criticism, The Sound Of Music delights and repels with the sureness of Marmite.",1484784000,,982,4.851190476190476

All I have to say is mine came with a redeem code for Ultra Violet (VUDU).  Originally I didn't purchase the version that was available on VUDU only because it wasn't the 50th anniversary version.  I hate owning physical copies as I prefer digital copies.  So, with a heavy heart, I purchased this one from Amazon.  Once I opened it and saw the FREE redeem code, I simply followed the 3 step process to redeem the code, and WAALAAAH now I have the 50th anniversary edition of the Sound of Music (this exact one), along with the featurette on my VUDU account, online!!!!!!!!!

3248722,5,B000Y5JFNY,I grew up watching a truncated version of this movie on TV as it was broadcasted every year around the holidays.  I bought this digital version for my own kid to enjoy and boy do they love it.  We've watched it (not all of it) almost every day since last week.  I did notice however that there is a section (and I only noticed it in this section so far) that is where Maria's voice is out-of-sync.  It's the part where she begins to teach the children how to sing with the song Do-Re-Mi up on the hill with her guitar.  Anyone else notice that?  Is it just a bad digital copy that Amazon has?,1482883200,,592,4.104347826086957

3248773,5,B000Y5JFNY,"This movie is cute and heartfelt, with great feel-good music, and a story that doesn't get boring despite the long run of 3 hours- but it can get a bit slow. As far as musicals go, ""The Sound of Music"" is one of the best musicals there is, and it still holds up well despite being an older movie. This is a movie that the entire family can enjoy, since at its heart it is the story of a family healing and sticking together. The cold captain thaws and stops being the emotionally distant and strict father he was to his 7 children (after his wife's death), thanks to Maria's influence. Maria also grows as a character, and learns to face the difficulties that come her way (after being hired as a babysitter for the captain's children), and learns to live her life after being sheltered at a convent. Then there are the children, who want their family back. Overall this is a classic musical, that makes for great family entertainment.

Even when I was 11 years old and one day I was browsing around my local Blockbuster Video store (back when those were still functioning) I saw the VHS for sale and I did not even have my first DVD player yet and wanted to buy the VHS anyway because it was a movie I have been wanting for ages, but something was telling me that I might be getting my first DVD player real soon and this was a movie that I would might consider buying as one of my first DVD's. I just bought the 50th Anniversary Edition DVD along with a bunch of other movies as a gift for my sister and I am going to give it to her for her birthday coming up in another week I know that she'll really enjoy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The video quality ranges from fair to good, but never great. There is a lot of artifacting, of the dancing dots variety, especially in flesh toned areas. Also, the color looks like it's been darkened a bit and ""enhanced"", leaving it a bit over saturated, almost as though the movie has been colorized from a grayscale source, which it definitely was not.",1478995200,,421,4.613333333333333

3248904,5,B000Y5JFNY,"The Sound of Music is one of my all-time favorite movies. I grew up watching it on VHS with my family, back in the day where the movie was on two separate tapes and switching over to the second tape was the perfect intermission. I realized I didn't have it in my movie collection for some reason and, with the recent and sad passing of Charmian Carr, who played Liesl Von Trapp, I decided it was a great time to purchase it. Besides the beautiful singing, great acting, and amazing scenery, another reason I love this movie is because I was fortunate enough to visit Salzburg, Austria over 20 years ago. My family and I got to visit many of the scenes from the movie which is one of the reasons I love this movie so much.

The Sound of Music is based on the true story of the Von Trapp Family Singers. It was filmed in 1965 and the movie takes place in the late 1930s in Salzburg, Austria before the start of World War II. Fraulein Maria, played by Julie Andrews, is a headstrong, spunky postulant at an abbey. The Reverend Mother decides to send her to the home of Captain Von Trapp to become the new governess to his seven children. Captain Von Trapp, played by Christopher Plummer, runs a tight ship and expects his children to stick to a rigid schedule whereas Maria feels children should run and play. Maria loves to sing so there is a lot of singing in the movie and they are songs to which I've always remembered the words and it's fun to sing along with the movie.

I loved watching this movie after a long time and it was even better than I remember! This time, I was watching it from an adult's perspective and noticed things I hadn't seen before. The Sound of Music is a musical by Rodgers and Hammerstein and there is plenty of history as well as a love story. At 175 minutes, it's a long movie but there is still a couple minute intermission in the middle which is very convenient for a bathroom break. It is shown in color and can be watched in English Dolby Digital 5.1, English Dolby Surround 4.0, Spanish Dolby Surround and French Dolby Surround. It is rated G and I would love to show it to my kids someday once they have longer attention spans. This is the 50th Anniversary Edition and contains an optional sing-along track, a music machine sing-along and a Sound of Music Tour. The only regret I have is not buying it in Blu-Ray since the scenery is so gorgeous and that version would be more vibrant but the DVD is wonderful as well.

I love this movie and am so glad I finally own it (and it's not VHS!). If you also grew up watching this movie and have yet to own it, I'd recommend buying it since I feel it's money worth spent. We also purchased a copy for my mom since she loves this movie. Julie Andrews is one of my favorite actresses and she does a phenomenal job in the role of Maria. I love having this movie in my collection and recommend it to anyone who is a fan! So Long, Farewell!",1477094400,,2915,4.2771739130434785

All around an amazing movie! I was skeptical for a while about watching this film because of some of the remarks and negative responses about it. Don't let that stop you though! I'm not a big fan of musicals. There's only a few that I like overall. But this is a classic movie that can't possibly be remade to match the original's emotion, charm, and talent. It has its romantic side but has its moments of wit along with the underlying serious issue. Great movie for all ages, even if you don't like musicals.
I bought the digital copy of this movie which has extra time at the end about the making of it. Outstanding quality! I was hesitant about buying it first and not renting it. I always rent movies first to see if I like it. I'm so glad that I bought it! By the way, Amazon has a great price for this movie.
I could go on and on about how amazing this film is...but watch and find out for yourself! You won't be disappointed! I surely wasn't. Bottom line: I recommend this movie to anyone!",1475020800,,1160,4.301369863013699

3249025,5,B000Y5JFNY,"The Sound of Music is one of my favorite movies - I know that not everyone likes musicals or older movies, but they should see this at least once.  The story is pretty well-known, so there's no need to discuss the plot.  This is a feel-good movie for the most part because most of the events are happy and the sad scenes don't last too long.  The ending is not happy when you consider the steep price that Max and the nuns would have paid (not shown) and the fact that the family has lost everything.  If you don't already have the Blu-ray version you'll want to purchase this since the picture is much clearer than the DVD version (I've seen both), but if you already have the Blu-ray version you probably don't need to spend the extra money for yet another re-release of the same movie.",1471910400,,788,4.340136054421769

It would then air again annually on NBC but only 1 more time unedited.  It was later cut by 30 minutes.

Now if you are looking for a blu-ray version of this then beware that the 50th anniversary edition  . It is the same transfer that the Blu-Rays  45th Anniversary and that fine.  The packaging makes you think this is an all new restoration and transfer.

3249092,5,B000Y5JFNY,"Robert Wise wanted to make it perfectly clear that he was not making a documentary or a realistic movie about the von Trapp family.  He approached the project with complete dramatic freedom in order to produce a fine and moving film that the von Trapp family could be proud of.  But serious liberties were taken.  This is the problem you face when you sell your story to someone to do with as they please.

Hard to believe, but at the time of its release some highly intellectual critics were exceedingly vicious in their reviews, referring to it as romantic nonsense and sentiment, artificial, icky sticky, and cozy-cum-corny.  Naturally, it was a big hit.  Definitely one of my favorite films, it never fails to cheer me up every time I watch it (okay, maybe not the part with the Nazis).

3249115,5,B000Y5JFNY,"A couple of weeks ago, I watched The Sound of Music for perhaps the umpteenth time since I first saw it in a theater way back in 1965. With my love for good old-fashioned musicals, I have  always ranked this film very high on my Top 10 list of all-time favorite movies.

For those not familiar with The Sound of Music, the film is based on the famous Rodgers and Hammerstein Broadway musical also entitled The Sound of Music. The play was based on Maria von Trapps memoir The Story of the Trapp Family Singers.

The Sound of Music is set in Austria during the years before the Nazis took over the country in 1938. Maria is an undisciplined, high-spirited novice at a convent. The convents Mother Superior sends Maria to work as a governess in the home of Captain von Trapp, a wealthy retired naval officer. Marias job is to care for von Trapps six unruly children. She and von Trapp sharply disagree on how to discipline the children. Von Trapp believes in strict, military style discipline, while Maria thinks an open, caring approach is better. The Sound of Music shows how Maria and von Trapp resolve their differences and form a loving family unit.

The Sound of Musics stars include Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer, Peggy Wood, Richard Hayden, and Eleanor Parker. It has some of the best acting and most entertaining musical numbers Ive ever seen in a movie.

Over the years, I have watched The Sound of Music in nearly every home video format  videocassette (both Betamax and VHS), DVD, and Blu-ray. Until now, Ive found home video editions of this film disappointing. They always seemed to feature grainy and colorless video that displayed dust, dirt, and other flaws found in the original films. The videocassette versions were particularly bad, and DVD releases were only somewhat better.

When I first watched The Sound of Music 45th Anniversary Edition in 2010, I could immediately see that the film had been completely restored.  The high definition 1080p video quality is astounding from the very first frame. Colors are vivid and accurate, images are sharp and detailed, and film grain is natural but unobtrusive. There isn't any banding, crushing, dirt, speckles, or other flaws  anywhere to be seen. The lossless DTS Master Audio 7.1 soundtrack is rich and robust.

The 45th Anniversary edition of The Sound of Music is a three-disc combo-pack that contains a copy of the restored film on both Blu-ray disc and DVD. Theres a third disc that contains a wide variety of  outstanding bonus features. If youve never seen The Sound of Music in true high definition, or if you're simply  looking to upgrade to the best possible home video version, this edition is the one to get. Highly recommended.",1469318400,,2712,4.821120689655173

Great acting, singing, dancing, set design, costumes, cinematography, and music and lyrics are the foundation of this classic.  It may be corny or smarmy to some, too wholesome and pure for the realists among us.  Yet the characters are constantly adjusting their sails and steering by the heavens - the anecdotal definition of realists.  And, they do it robustly with great joy while singing!  I want to live like that!",1467849600,,579,5.042105263157895

In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!
