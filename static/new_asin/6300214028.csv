238060,5,6300214028,The mixture of cinema and commentary from the people who lived through these events makes this film a must see for anyone interested in the American socialist response to the Bolshevik Revolution and the idealism  they embodied.  Beatty and Keaton have amazing chemistry in the dramatic  recreation of the events that transpired.  Beatty masterfully captures the  disillusionment felt by John Reed as the idealistic Bolshevik Revolution  gave way to a reign of terror.,935712000,5,468,5.342465753424658
238061,3,6300214028,"To distill this massive-scale epic into as concise and succint a summary as possible, ""Reds"" is a disparate fusion of many elements; some refreshing, and even inspiring; some infuriating. For a more detailed  critique, I divide the following categories: THE GOOD: 1.) The mere fact  that such an uncommercial topic was undertaken; and that aided with a large  budget, and--more importantly--that the creative mind behind it believed in  its sociopolitical issues so religously. ""Reds"" has a strength of  it's convictions rare indeed for a modern film; more so, even, for such an  expensive one (the obverse of ""Titanic"", etc.). 2.) Considering  it's countless opportunities, ""Reds"" seldom ever stoops to the  exploitation of sexual content and four-letter words, sooooooo prevalent in  today's films. 3.) Best of all, the Oscar-winning color  photography of  Vittorio Storaro. His skill at creating dramatic sweep with his camera (as  befits an epic) is unsurpassed by his peers. His exteriors are eye-filling,  spacious, extraordinarily beautiful; his interiors (so often neglected by  today's photographers) are particularly nicely judged, exquisite color  compositions painted with light, no less aesthetically appealing than his  exteriors. Epic length films so often become visually tedious. Thanks to  Vittorio Storaro, one of the great masters of his craft, ""Reds""  does not. THE BAD: 1.) Despite it's plethora of lines of dialogue,  ""Reds"" does not allow it's actors opportunities to make much  impact; except, to some extent, Warren Beatty. Yeah, I know everybody got  Oscar-nominations and stuff; but the Academy has never understood that big  parts do not necessarily guarentee great roles; let alone, great  performances. The fact is that the script and direction of ""Reds""  lacks refined approach to dramatic concept, in order to make the very most  out of the performances. As it is, the picture itself overwhelms the  acting, more or less (unlike ""Gone With the Wind"". THE UGLY: 1.)  The overblown love-story bookends, reputedly a Beatty directorial weakness.  We have to wait for 1 hr and 20 mins of pretentious, boring, predictable  romantic vicissitudes between Beatty and Keaton before they arrive in  Russia--when the story really gets going (that's because that is when John  Reed's character really gets going). Keaton tries hard; but as much as  Beatty wants to place the love story on equal standing with the adventures,  it only diminishes the effectiveness of it. The focus should have been kept  on the political career of Reed most of the way, with a low-profile romance  underscoring the action most of the way; with the love story only taking  center stage in the later events, to give the story a great romantic pay  off. 2.) The introduction to too many irrelevant characters and subplots;  particularly with the Eugene O'Neill character, and the affair he has with  Keaton. I cannot see any reason with substance for that entire piece to  exist. 3.) The incredible nonstop hail of talking. There has never been a  wordier movie than this. The effect of the good talk is not counterpointed  by any thoughtful reticence. Here, Beatty weilds the reins of Altman in his  relentless desire to have ten people talking at once. Unlike the old  masters, Beatty doesn't understand the necessity of relieving his  audience's ears along the way. It is not until near the end that we can get  even a few minutes of silence. By now, though, we are exhausted. A mark for  trying for Mr. Warren Beatty, even if he sabotages his own efforts much of  the way.",922320000,8,3575,5.146341463414634

238166,5,6300214028,"I haven't seen this movie for 25 - 30 years and it has always remained near and dear to my heart. Watching it again this evening has only confirmed my fondness for this epic movie.

It was a significant time in history that is only repeating itself in modern America. Unions have been weakened once again and worker exploitation (the masses) are very apparent. Those that give this movie a ""boring"" rating don't realize that history is only repeating itself. The captains of industry (the corporations and billionaire politicians) of USA today and the breaking down of Democracy where all people are supposed to have a voice regarding the direction of their countries is a red flag that only a film like ""Reds"" could illustrate.

The people of that era were idealists who saw their inspirations dashed and many of their ""comrades"" were murdered and killed. Little did they know at the time there was a brief moment in history during the 20th century in which most working families enjoyed the fruits of the blood that was shed from the idealists. I don't call them Communists as they held high hopes to make change for the better for all people, not just a oligarchic or plutocratic few. That's what ruthless Capitalism was doing then, and is doing today as well.

Very important time-piece film and solidly acted.",1506124800,2,1314,4.779735682819383

Dark and haunted even in his younger days, Nicholson as O'Neill gives a hint of what could be an incredible close to a great career . . . if Jack would do the aging O'Neill now, it could be terrifying and awesome.

Beatty's vision was massive, it's really his version of a David Lean type of epic, but punctuated by the narration of the Witnesses (something Lean would never have done).  Small wonder Reagan welcomed Beatty to the White House for a memorable Saturday viewing of the film, which history records the President enjoyed.

They both cheat with mistresses or lovers and believe in free love. Very little is actually shown of the russian civil war, no speaking parts by Lenin or Trotsky nor any great battle scenes. Just very general sketch of the war. It serves as the backdrop for the love story. Not what I expected.

238334,5,6300214028,"This is a movie about an American who travels covertly to Russia during the Communist Revolution and becomes embroiled in it.  The movie is an epic and probably a ""must see"" for the true student of Hollywood history.  The movie was nominated for numerous Academy Awards and was awarded three.

Warren Beatty directed and starred in the movie.  It was a great effort on his part.  He was awarded an Academy Award for Best Director.  Personally, I loved Diane Keaton, who was nominated, but did not win an Academy Award.  Maureen Stapleton was also excellent and was awarded an Academy Award.

The cinematography was also excellent.  At times the scenes depicted reminded me of ""Doctor Zhivago"" and at other times of ""Lawrence of Arabia"".  There were times the scenes are chaotic and I have trouble following everything.  However, the film depicts chaotic times and therefore I think these scenes are realistic.

As a younger, somewhat shallow and frivolous person, I privately considered Warren Beatty to be some sort of self indulgent light weight.  For many reasons, I have come to the conclusion that I greatly underestimated Mr. Beatty and he has my true respect as an artist.

In summary, this is a great movie.  It is lengthy and therefore requires a bit of commitment to have a true and complete viewing experience.  I feel it is well worth the effort.  Thank You...",1475280000,,1372,4.844827586206897

And this film actually attempts to put this ""revolution"" in the light of a good and necessary societal shift in consciousness.

The most calamitous aspect of the bolshevik revolution in Russia is that it resulted in the deaths of 60 million Christians, later to be followed by 6-7 million Ukrainian Christians -- in 1932-1933 Holodomor -- in a concentrated effort towards starvation of the populace in the world's most fertile grain-producing regions. All of this was a direct and planned result of these bolshevik ""idealists"" taking over the vast Russian lands. These horrors preceded various anti-Christian purges over the next 5 decades at the hands of the jewish-bolshevik elites.

While it is true I am an Anti-Communist, it shows how in the early part of the 20th century the citizens of the United States were sucked in by Marxist philosophy, that sounded really good. It took place at times when the government was dealing with things like WWI and the roaring twenties and all the things that were going on that people had serious problems with the economy in the United States. Roosevelt, and Wilson were both Marxists and then the Depression hit. The upheaval in the country was ripe for, like Germany at a time of poverty running rampant, an overthrow of the Government.

Hollywood and authors that were esoteric, abstruse, obscure, arcane, recherch, rarefied, recondite, abstract; enigmatic, inscrutable, cryptic, Delphic; complex, complicated, incomprehensible, opaque, impenetrable, mysterious who were self-centered and needed to be adolescents when the FAD was going against the norm like today with the homosexuals and their COMING OUT; they in order to be NOTICED needed to rebel.

It is very ""literary"" where if one wrote or made movies about things that were GOOD AND NORMAL...then one really wouldn't have ever been a STAR! ""Greatness"" is when one does things that are DARING AND ACTUALLY BAD AND WRONG! This is in fact what this movie shows.

It was a time when it was, like with the HIPPIES of the 1960s, when they all ran away to Canada. Since Carter put them into normal status by pardoning them (rather than sending them to JAIL FOR BREAKING THE LAW) few people know or care who they are or what they did. To really understand the OUTLAWS...Robin HOOD'S of our time one must also read Saul Alinsky. He has said to WIN, they need to become accepted as normal. It has created a real problem with hiding in plain sight. It is the mantra of Bernie Sanders. He is SINGING THE SONG of ""Reds"".

It is what makes people go over to the Taliban or ISIS! Nothing has changed, it is the people that go into police stations and claim credit for CRIMES THEY DIDN'T COMMIT. They are just seeking notoriety as being BAD because they simply cannot make a mark in the world by being good or successful. The people of that time, were a cult of ""artists and authors"" Had they been traditional they would never have achieved any fame at all.

Random thoughts.
1. This is NOT a pro communist movie. Anyone who says that did not listen to the dialog. I am conservative.
2. There is a movie trailer out there glorifying the rebel John Reed who dared to ... (whatever). That is NOT the movie. Bad marketing.  Ignore it.
3. Warren Beatty co-wrote, directed, produced, and starred in Reds. He had control over every line in the movie. If there is an anti-communist jibe here and there early in the movie he OKed it. e.g. ""Is that what they are reading about in Greenwich Village now, industrial accidents?""
4. Diane Keaton starts out as an Annie Hall air head hanger on and ends up being the only one making sense. Listen to her. Watching her facial expressions as she reacts to the situations is memorable.
5. The political dialog is first rate.
6. The actors show pain in their faces in the movie like real people do when hurt.
7. When the character played by Jerzy Kosinski brags about how he stayed at his party job even when his young son was very sick the camera catches the face of his now adult son for about a half second. There is a lot of attention to such detail in the movie.

Read the following statement: from drone protestor, Don Timmerman in Wisconsin: ""Don was hoping to read the following statement on Nuremberg from Nuremberg and American Justice during his testimony, but was not allowed:
Allegiance to the nation-state must be replaced by a loyalty to the human community and by a respect for international law. It is not the rebel who threatens civilization, but the compliant conformist who mechanically suppresses his moral qualms when confronted with the dictates of authority. The famous therapist R.D. Laing reminds us that the perfectly adjusted bomber pilot poses a greater threat to the survival of the human species than does the hospitalized schizophrenic. Laing goes on to note that so-called normal individuals have been responsible for the unnecessary death of perhaps one hundred million of their fellow human beings in the twentieth century.""
When the media starts covering heroes like Timmerman- a John Reed of our day- - rather than the trumps or Clintons of the world- well be getting somewhere. Yhe media spends its time covering normal people as if they were news. They arent.
The movie ""Reds"" portrays some of the lefties of the early 20th century- peop;le who, like Timmerman- stood for something.

238544,3,6300214028,"Warren Beatty's epic, 'Reds', is a one-dimensional, though smartly executed, exposition of the political whirlwinds taking place during World War I, concentrating on the February 1917 overthrow of the Czar and the subsequent October [Bolshevik] coup that toppled the Provisional government, setting the climate where Beatty's character, journalist John Reed, who arrived in Russia three months before the Bolshevik coup, abandons his 'journalist' credentials, taking part, both unofficial and official, in the coup. The true contextual framework that existed on the global political scene that gave rise to the chaos of World War I, from which the Bolshevik state was born, is altogether different than what Marxist co-opted history has informed us...

The refusal of the World War I Allied nations of Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, France, Canada and the United States to overthrow the Bolshevik regime immediately after the 7 November 1917 coup in Petrograd shun a bright spotlight on not only the Marxist co-option of the Allies political establishments, but Marxist co-option of the Central Powers political establishments as well, since after the war those nations that constituted the Central Powers during the war failed after the war to alert the attention of the world to the Allies Marxist co-option, where the Allies protected the Bolshevik regime in Petrograd, even though Lenin's war policy would remove Russia from the war, thereby strengthening the Central Powers against the Allies.

World War I was a Marxist operation creating false oppositions for the purpose of causing chaos, where out of the ashes of chaos the Marxist global position would be stronger. The official term Marxists give to this false opposition tactic is the 'Scissors Strategy', in which the blades represent the two falsely opposed sides that converge on the confused victims, simultaneously neutralizing true opposition while advancing the Marxist agenda.

In one of the many senseless campaigns fought on the Western Front, the Cambrai campaign (20 November 1917 - 7 December 1917) witnessed more than 44,000 casualties, including 7,000 servicemen of the United Kingdom and South Africa dying for little ground gained. That 44,000 casualty figure should have been used instead for the more critical campaign against the Bolsheviks in Petrograd, resulting in the re-entry of Russia into the war, thereby sparing the exhausted Allies the prospect of facing (1) thirty German divisions previously deployed against Russia on the Eastern Front;* (2) Austro-Hungarian divisions freed from the Russian Western Front (twenty-three Austro-Hungarian divisions); and (3) Ottoman divisions freed from the Caucasus Campaign. In fact, a 60,000 strong Allied military unit was already in Russia (the Ukraine) at the time--the Czechoslovak Legion--and could have been used to overthrow the Bolsheviks if the Allied powers so wished. Instead, the Czechoslovak Legion was sent on a 6,000 mile odyssey across Russia, its destination Vladivostok on the Pacific coast for passage back to Europe and the war, instead of sending the legion 700 miles due north to Petrograd and collapse the Bolshevik coup. The politicians of the West were doing all they could to (1) protect the fledgling Bolshevik regime in Petrograd; while (2) sabotaging every opportunity to immediately get Russia back into the war before the Bolshevik position had strengthened throughout Russia. Only when the position of the Bolsheviks was relatively secure would the Allied powers mount campaigns to supposedly overthrow the Bolsheviks (North Russia Intervention and Siberian Intervention), campaigns that were sure to fail due to the lackluster number of soldiers assigned to both missions (though the Japanese contingent of 70,000 soldiers deployed to the the Siberian Intervention is a minimum number one would expect from the combined American, British and French contingent, whose actual total complement registered an anemic 10,250 soldiers up against 600,000 Bolsheviks) and the remote locations for the soldiers' landings--Archangel (British, French, Italian and American), Murmansk (British, French, Italian and American) and Vladivostok (American, British, French, Canadian, Italian, Polish, Chinese and Japanese)--far from the Bolshevik's Command and Control center located in Petrograd (Saint Petersburg), where too the Bolshevik's leadership (Central Committee) is located.

As soon as the World War I operation had ended, Marxists began planing for the World War II operation with the creation of that war's two false opposition fronts, the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the National Fascist Party in Italy. Benito Mussolini was a well known and influential Marxist before the Comintern ordered that he take up a new identity as leader of the National Fascist Party. As for Adolf Hitler's Marxist pedigree, one-third of Hitler's SA, and later Gestapo personnel, were 'former' Marxists.

During the course of World War II Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, Chief of the Abwehr  (German military intelligence), and General Reinhard Gehlen, Chief of the German General Staffs intelligence unit for the Soviet Union and East European countries, Foreign Armies East  (FHO), independently discovered that a group supervised by Deputy Fhrer Martin Bormann,4 second in command of Germany, was transmitting unsupervised coded radio messages to Moscow

""Our suspicions were largely confirmed when, independently of one another, we found out that Bormann and his group were operating an unsupervised radio transmitter network and using it to send coded messages to Moscow. When OKW monitors reported this, Canaris demanded an investigation; but word came back that Hitler himself had emphatically forbidden any intervention: he had been informed in advance by Bormann of these Funkspiele, or fake radio messages, he said, and he had approved them.""

The only way to ensure that fake radio messages were being sent to Moscow, and not the latest Wehrmacht movements in the Eastern theater of operations, is to have such radio messages supervised by intelligence officers vetted for counterintelligence operations. It's one thing for Hitler to approve fake radio messages, but there's no excuse to not have the fake radio messages supervised by experienced counterintelligence officers. To refuse to implement this critical standard operating supervisory procedure cries out treason, since even Bormann himself should have wanted to ensure none of his subordinates were transmitting sensitive information to Moscow. The fact that Hitler refused such elementary precautions informs us that Hitler & Company were Marxist agents, sabotaging the German war effort from Berlin. In fact, it was the winter of 1941-42 that Gehlen and fellow generals had assessed that the Soviet campaign was a hopeless enterprise ""not because it could not be militarily or politically won, but because of Hitler's continued interference, which resulted in such elementary blunders that defeat was inevitable.""

Gehlen details Hitlers sabotage of Germany's Soviet campaign:

(1) The General Staff wanted to concentrate resources on capturing Moscow, since Moscow was the Command & Control location for Soviet forces. Hitler insisted on dissipating the effort on three fronts.

(2) The General Staff saw that the Soviets were going to entrap the Sixth Army at Stalingrad, and demanded a strategic withdrawal. Hitler vetoed this and 200,000 of Germany's best troops were lost, including the loss of irreplaceable weaponry.

(3) To replace these losses, the General Staff wanted to recruit millions of willing volunteers from anti-Communist ranks, i.e. Russians, Ukrainians, Lithuanians etc., After twenty years of arbitrary injustice and terror, the reestablishment of elementary human rights such as the dignity of man, liberty, justice, and the sanctity of property united every inhabitant of the Soviet empire (insofar as he was not directly working for the Moscow system) in a common readiness to support the Germans. What could be more natural for us than to exploit this readiness?""  Hitlers policy of treating Slavs as sub-human sabotaged any meaningful attempt in turning captured Soviet soldiers into German allies.

Both world wars severely weakened the security of the West by the deaths of non-Marxist military officers, who were replaced with Marxist officers. The Korean War continued this supplanting of Marxist officers for non-Marxist officers, and in the case of the United States was further exasperated by the Vietnam War, where over 50% of North Vietnamese soldiers (NVA) were Chinese PLA soldiers attired in NVA uniforms. As the globe turned ever redder after the November 1917 Marxist coup in Russia, the Marxist co-opted West naturally never liberated one Communist nation, and in early 1992 refused to perform a verification of the collapse of the USSR, thought the survival of the West depends on such verification.

* The Allies would also have to worry about the eventual redeployment to the Western Front of the eleven divisions that made up the German 9th Army, at the time engaged in the Romanian Campaign; with Russia out of the war, Romania was surrounded and wouldn't be able to remain in the war for long. As it turned out, on December 9, 1917 Romania signed an armistice with the Central Powers, freeing the German 9th Army's eleven divisions for action on the Western Front.",1440633600,2,9491,5.526859504132231

238696,4,6300214028,"For people interested in history, this was a sizeable and impressive production related to the epoch of the Russian Revolution.  Unlike most accounts, it was intended to reflect the revolution from the American viewpoint and not from Moscow.  As such, Warren Beatty plays the head of one of the communist party organizations, Diane Keaton the female companion, with Jack Nicholson and others having smaller roles playing personages from that time.
The plot follows the machinations of the American Communist party and it's interrelationship with the struggle in Russia.  The events in the US are rather mundane and very similar to the union activities of the time.  However, the film picks up a 'Dr. Zhivago' romance element when it heads to the point of action, i.e. Russia.  To be genuine and to know what's really afoot, Beatty heads to Russia to see the revolution in action.  One of the party operatives who confronts him, challenging his 'bona fides' as an authentic revolutionary communist, is a high-ranking Bolshevik, played by the author Jerzy Kosinski.  It's clearly the high point of the film, where a real 'Red' assails the dilettantes in the western world who talk a good game but don't achieve anything for the cause.

Presaging the decline of the Soviet system, even in its birth Beatty can see flaws and knows that the Soviet empire will never be a 'workers' paradise'.  We get the message that for all the weaknesses of our system, their system was hardly a panacea and the revolution there was more a power struggle than a fight for 'justice'...",1417824000,,1564,4.938931297709924

Both are anti-communist, and very happy with their conservative views, while I am a moderate liberal sympathetic toward the labor movement.

239057,4,6300214028,"Like Dances With Wolves and Braveheart, this movie shares the distinction of being directed by its star. And, like Citizen Kane - another title directed by its star, Reds represents the zenith of the actor's career. Orson Welles never again approached the greatness of Citizen Kane. Likewise, Reds is Warren Beatty's crowning achievement, a spectacular production involving multiple locations and hundreds if not thousands of extras - and he co-wrote, directed and produced as well as played the starring role. Whatever deal Beatty struck with Paramount Studios to make the movie, he got what he needed, because he evidently spared no expense to bring the critical events in the life of the story's central characters to the screen. Those characters, Jack Reed (Beatty) and Louise Bryant (Diane Keaton), were American radical journalists covering the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia, which began in 1917. In Reed's case, the coverage escalated to include complete involvement in the cause. Communism became his obsession, and Beatty conveys Reed's passion and determination to help the cause succeed - however misguided it appears through the lens of history.

At three hours-plus, Reds qualifies as an epic. But it's an episodic narrative. Its many, many scenes move along rapidly, as though we pop in and out of moments in Reed's and Bryant's lives. Their relationship develops rapidly, too. At first she's married to a dentist in Portland, Oregon. Then, all of a sudden, she's left her husband to join Reed in Greenwich Village. Then, she's engaging in an affair with playwright Eugene O'Neill (Jack Nicholson) and heading to France to cover the war. Then, Reed is battling for control of the National Socialist Party and heading to Russia to win the support of the Bolsheviks.  And so on. Yet Beatty's skilled enough as a director to keep things coherent. He also employs an interesting device to provide both respites from the story's breathless pace and background information about the times and the characters: the comments of 31 ""Witnesses,"" people - some of them well-known - who knew Reed and Bryant. But Beatty goofs, I think, by not identifying them on camera.

Beatty's reputation over the years has been based primarily on his romantic escapades. But here he shows true and serious talent and a devotion to an unusual character embroiled in a tumultuous time in history. It's a respectable effort and well worth a look.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phil-s-Favorite-500-Loves-of-a-Moviegoing-Lifetime-2014-edition/dp/B00HU8VK4K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime (2014 edition)</a>",1381622400,,2684,5.557457212713937

239060,2,6300214028,"Reds, 1981 film

This is the Hollywood history of John Reed, a journalist who went to Russia to cover their Revolution and became a supporter. Old people talk about their recollections. Reed is buried in the Kremlin, the only American there. Louise Bryant is shown as an unconventional wife. When a political meeting discusses the Great War Jack Reed makes a short speech. Is this war about ""Profit""? Louise meets him. Jack spouts his beliefs. He writes for ""The Masses"" magazine. Jack and Louise become friends. They go to New York (Greenwich Village). We see pictures of real people from the 1910s and scenes from that time. Can society be changed if all the workers in the world united into one big union? [No, human nature creates differences even in one country.]

A meeting is dispersed by the police and armed citizens. [No problem with the Second Amendment then.] Jack leaves a publication over their editing. [Don't they all do that?] He argues with Louise over their styles. They put on plays and discuss current events. [As if their opinions were important.] Provincetown becomes an artsy resort. Louise is left behind when Jack leaves to cover a political convention. Gene O'Neill enters Louise's life. In 1917 Wilson declared war (the Zimmermann telegram). Jack develops a kidney disease. Will they support the war? There is jealousy over romantic events. [Basic human emotions, love and possessions.] Jack's diseased kidney is removed, he is warned by his doctor. Jack plans to go to Petrograd to cover politics. They see soldiers by a train station. Kerensky continues the war. Jack interviews Trotsky and Lenin. There are problems in Russia (desertions, food shortages, etc.) Jack speaks at a political rally. They sing a song.

Jack and Louise are happy together. They return to America, their Russian newspapers are confiscated! Louise is questioned by a political Committee. Aliens were deported (if politically undesirable). Jack wrote ""Ten Days That Shook the World"", about the Russian Revolution; it was successful. The Socialist Party purges a number of its members. What will they do? A small group discusses politics (interpersonal conflicts). There is a Socialist convention in 1919 Chicago. Those without a red card are rejected, these form a Communist Labor Party. Others form a newer party. Jack will be sent to Moscow to get authorization; he has the background. Jack is a writer not a politician, says Louise. Who is following Louise? Federal Agents enter her home to look for Jack Reed, accused of Sedition.

Jack is arrested in Finland, then released later. He does not have a USA passport. Louise goes to Finland. Jack speaks at a meeting about labor unions in the USA. He is outvoted and leaves. The Bolsheviks have taken over the newspapers and other organizations; those who object are shot. Jack is sent on a mission to the Near East. Anti-colonialism is the policy. Louise arrives in Russia. Jack speaks against oil companies. On the return their train is attacked and shelled! Louise meets Jack. He has high blood pressure and can get a stroke. He dies in a hospital.

The credits roll. The witnesses were not identified as they spoke. One says few know about Jack Reed today, Aside from his book ""Ten Days ..."", who remembers the journalists from that era? Is this movie worth watching? I think a history book about that era would be better. Should a man with a serious disease know his limitations? What would have happened if he lived? Not too many know that the 1918 Revolution in Germany ended the Great War. It was suppressed by the forces that later brought Hitler to power.",1374105600,,3621,4.939244663382595

The character's determination and development struggle with the crumbling of dreams is  most poignian.  The realities of war and just how wrong good intentions can go should be a lesson for all.  The beauty in the internationality of joining a variety of movements into the revolution and the American fear of anything that threatens the ""profits"" (best line in the film) of the elite juxtaposed holds far too many truths to this day.

239211,4,6300214028,"If you enjoy period movies and romantic stories, then ""Reds"" will entertain you.  It is quite long (almost 4 hours): two discs and a much needed intermission.  A 20-something free-spirited and progressively-thinking wife in Oregon (in a dull marriage to a dentist) falls in love with a handsome but somewhat naive writer with socialist leanings.  She moves to New York with him and joins the Village ultra-liberal scene.  Changing times and changing values in early twentieth century America influence the young couple.  Interspersed flashback comments by aged, wrinkled interviewees add a light touch, and there are other small elements of comedy throughout the movie, but I thought the attempts at comedy were only partly successful.  The story winds to Russia at the time of the 1917 revolution.  This long romantic tale likely will interest women more than men.  I thought the most interesting aspect of the film was one of its messages about how well-intentioned Americans of that period who had socialist leanings were taken-in by the early Communist movement, and how Communism quickly changed to incorpate repression and severe limitations in individual freedom that surprised and stunned the do-gooders who had earlier thought that Communism might have been a just cause.  Communism turned out to be an unworkable system full of inefficiency, repression, violence, and failure.  But these messages appear only during the last 20 minutes or so of this very long film, so I think the writer / director / producer was really trying to ""sell"" the romantic story in this movie rather than any profound message.

You know, like a good piece of journalism, the lead is incredibly important.  In the context of this film, the lead, in the form of Warren Beatty, is incredibly weak.

239218,5,6300214028,"The kind of film that has sadly just about disappeared - the personal,
auteur driven epic.  Very rarely if ever now will a studio give a film
maker huge funds to do a risky, personal, not obviously commercial
project,  one that could never be made as a `small' film.

While critics can nit pick, and a few of their points may be valid (both
Beatty and Diane Keaton were at least 10 years older then their real life characters,
making some behavior seem overly naive and juvenile instead of understandable
for their youth and inexperience), overall this is a masterful combining of the big picture
and the personal, and how the two interrelate in life.  How do we deal with emotions that
are much messier than our ideals of how to live?

It explores the twin faces of revolution - the sometimes desperate need to fight to
create a new order, but the danger that the new order may be just as corrupt as the old.

Rare is the film that deeply, honestly explores both idealism and the dark realities of
political compromise.  Rarer still is the film that explores both in a personal way, without
judgment, but with deep insight.

Beautifully shot by Vitorio Storraro, wonderful production design.

Keaton and Beatty are very good in the leads, and the supporting cast, down to the
smallest role, is generally magnificent.  Especially amazing are Maureen Stapleton
as Emma Goldman, and Jack Nicholson in one of his very best (and most restrained)
performances as Eugene O'Neil.  He may capture the true pain of trying to live through

239283,5,6300214028,"One factor I think about in ranking a movie 5 stars is whether - upon successive viewings - I discover more layers of meaning or excellence.  Will the movie get tired or will it get stronger?  ""Citizen Kane"" or ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" are those kinds of films that get stronger each time I see it.  I include ""Reds"" in that same category of profoundly interesting films.

One brilliant aspect is the director's playful use of the ""Witnesses"" - talking heads framed in black - that interrupt parts of the narrative like a Greek Chorus. Sometimes they have something insightful to say...sometimes trivial...but all the Witnesses knew John Reed or Louise Bryant back 70, 80, 90 years ago.

Warren Beatty's epic sews many different threads successfully.  Yes, it is a love story about John Reed and Louise Bryant, but part of that love story is the personal growth of Louise Bryant's character as a woman.  Early on, she complains she is not taken seriously.  John Reed responds that only if she writes about serious things  will smart men begin to take her seriously.  And he is right. In time, Louise Bryrant must have developed an insightful, observant voice. In literary style I actually prefer Louise Bryant's ""Mirrors of Moscow"" to John Reed's better known ""Ten Days that Shook the World.""

""Reds"" is also a story of young men and women who were willing to make tremendous personal sacrifices if their efforts might bring about a better world. And this at a sad time in American history when child labor, poverty wages, and 70 hour workweeks were common. It is also an uncommonly honest film about socialism and the Russian Revolution.

There are many deeply intelligent scenes.  Two examples:  John Reed and Emma Goldman privately debate whether the Communist Party has abandoned its principles.  Or Louise Bryant is compelled to answer to a Congressional Committee about her patriotism and faith.

On every level, this is a thinking person's film that has many obvious and hidden treasures. Alas I feel that too many current films celebrate comic book heroes rather than real flesh and blood individuals...people with very serious flaws, fears, and yet outstanding courage. John Reed was such a person.

While I personally believe his desperation to support the communist party was a wrong choice...I will accept the reality he did so at a time when the idea of a workers' revolution seemed to be an alternative to the evils of unchecked capitalism.  So, for example, in condemning the U.S. decision to get into World War I, he proclaims that the U.S. Government is ready to support J.P. Morgan even with the blood of its sons. In other words, John Reed argues the American elite would protect J.P. Morgan's financial interests against catastrophic bank losses even if that meant war.  Nearly 100 years later, what has happened?  Hundreds of billions of dollars were recently loaned by the U.S. Treasury to AIG Insurance and to the Big Banks during the economic blow-out that these institutions caused in the first place.

History repeats itself.  Learning from these great films may serve as a warning...next time.",1288569600,2,3119,4.946257197696737

239285,5,6300214028,"I just got finished watching another video, an older video made in Mexico about John Reed and his work with the likes of Poncho Villa during the Mexican Revolution. The Title: ""Reed: Insurgent Mexico.""  In this, Reed is constantly running toward or from battle, as he attempts to get a clear picture of the revolution.  The reason why I mention this, is that Warren Beatty as Reed, chases after the Red Army as it fights off a White Russian attack toward the end of Reds.

Basically, Reds begins where Insurgent Mexico leaves off, so, a very interesting two movies, if you can find the above.

You are left with few questions, if any, about John Reed regarding his views.  Whether the last scenes were true to the real story, John Reed tells one of the leaders of Propaganda that the revolution is dissent and a dissent voice must be allowed.  Throughout the movie there is the tug between the larger group dynamics versus the few having control of things.

We meet John Reed after we meet who was to become his wife, Louise Bryant, played by Diane Keaton.  We see Maureen Stapleton, playing Emma Goldman.  (Fascinating to me how Maureen Stapleton never seemed to age.  She played Mama in Bye Bye Birdie over 18 years before and look very much the same.  Jack Nicholson plays the Irish American Eugene O'Niell.  He plays more of a pragmatic role juxtaposed to Reeds idealism.  Not to be left out is a very upbeat Gene Hackman, who plays a reporter who is really the opposite idealogically of Reed and his cohort.

The fact that these people gave their time, life and effort to a cause that they really believed in.  These men and women spent ample time imprisoned in numerous places because of their quest for  what they felt was right.

Additionally the movie is filmed in Russia (The USSR at the time) which was actually amazing due to the stories openness.  It has an epic feel at times, yet the invterviews from actual witnesses and acquiantences of the Reeds and their story, brings a much more personal feel.

One scene is very telling, Reed is asked how is he supposed to do so much with so few.  He proceeds to ask a question about how many were involved in Revolutionary America with the first shot heard around the world.  He answers, 77.  So few were able to do so much.

Whether or not you agree with the ideology of Reed anyone looking for a view of unbending character in ideology, you get that in this story.",1268265600,4,2423,4.545034642032332
239286,4,6300214028,"Reds is a quintessential epic, a big movie about big history. Warren Beatty plays Jack Reed, an intellectual revolutionary trying to get into the mix of the Russian Revolution. He meets Louise Bryant (played by Diane Keaton), an earnest writer of sorts who doesn't have a cause but who greatly desires change. They move to Greenwich Village and take up with other famous movers and shakers of that time, such as Eugene O'Neill and Emma Goldman. Events escalate overseas, Reed becomes enmeshed with the Communists, and Bryant tried to find herself through trying to find out what makes Reed tick.

That, of course, is the tip of the iceberg here. Westerners often look to Russian art and history to get a palatable panorama of human existence, and this film excels at dissecting that fascination. Beatty directs this film with great skill, making it a digestible history lesson wrapped in an absorbing love story. Parts of it are also a lot of fun- who wouldn't want to see Jack Nicholson's take on Eugene O'Neill? There is also a very subtle thread of humor throughout- Beatty knows how much info to give the audience at any given time before the story suffers. Also praiseworthy is the film's exquisite cinematography- this is a huge sweeping homage to the great epics of the 40's and 50's. It is a rather large commitment for any passive fan, but I would highly recommend it to anyone with any interest in the Revolution or Communism in Europe.",1266710400,3,1446,4.784
239287,5,6300214028,"One of my all time favorite films to broach one of my all time favorite subjects; `Reds' is an outstanding example of filmmaking at its absolute finest (in every possible way).  It's hard for me to really put into words what I think about this film, because it is such an experience in itself that mere words don't seem to do the film justice.

I've heard so many complain that this film is boring and overly long and I'm stumped because I don't think a single film has really ever engulfed me like `Reds'.  That isn't to say that this is the best movie out there (in fact, it isn't even the best movie of '81; that honor goes to `Diva'), but Beatty's direction is truly one of the best directorial achievements of all time.  His delicate yet swift hand helped create a lavish and exciting epic feel without losing the intimacy and personal taste level needed to give this type of story `flesh'.

This movie was such a joy to watch.

The film centers on American Communist John Reed, and it tells his story; from his involvement in the Russian Revolution to his intimate relationship with Louise Bryant, a writer who sparks his interest and tests his values.  Their relationship (as chaotic and conflicted as it was) is the true heart of this film; and while `Reds' is a political masterpiece (it is one of those rare films that really makes you feel a part of the history, delivering a powerful and intelligent story without losing the audience in the unfolding) it is first and foremost a beautiful love story that captures the heart of man.  Reed's loyalties are tested by Bryant, but their love is never in question.

Don't get anxious, for this is not your typical weepy romantic film.  What I mean by love story is that is really fleshes out the human NEED to love.

Garnering a slew of Oscar nominations, and even netting Beatty that coveted directing Oscar, `Reds' is certainly outstanding in every area.  Warren Beatty is not an actor I am really head-over-heals for.  I often find him either stiff (he was the worst part of the otherwise superb `Bonnie and Clyde') or forgettable (again, he was the worst part of the otherwise enjoyable `Shampoo') but he has impressed me a few times (his ferocious approach in `Bugsy' was startling and breathtaking at the same time) and this is one of them.  Sure, he is not best in show, but he really understands the political and emotional makeup of this character.  I think maybe his directing had a hand in his grasp of character, but he really sunk into this one.  Personally, this film belongs to Diane Keaton.  I just LOVE this performance; so strong and full of fervor and tenacity.  She develops a fully fleshed out woman who longs to get a hold on all she holds dear but is unable to fully comprehend how to do that.  So many rave Keaton's `Annie Hall', but honestly, her Louise Bryant is MUCH better.

Aside from those two beautiful performances, there is Oscar nominated (and deserving of those nominations) Jack Nicholson and Maureen Stapleton (Stapleton actually won the Oscar).  I adore Stapleton in this film.  I was thinking the other day about supporting performances that truly define the category, and this performance kept popping up in my head.  She really delivers such an authentic and natural progression of character; never delving into ticks or gimmicks or clich&eacute;s to build her character, but hinging her entire performance on pure and genuine humanity.

Just breathtaking.

I'd feel bad if I didn't spend at least a few moments talking about Nicholson, since it is `Jack Nicholson Friday'.  His performance here is one that slowly creeps up on you.  For the first half of the film he seemed like nothing more than a background character to me, but as the film progressed and his character's intentions and motives started to unveil themselves I started to find that he was all I could think about.  Even when he wasn't on the screen I could feel his presence in the eyes of Keaton (another testament to her BRILLIANT performance) and long after the film is through I can still feel the impact of his advances.  It is a small performance from someone who is usually larger than life, but for me that makes this one all the more special.

If you love broadly stroked epic films that embody the screen with rich characters, tightly woven plots and beautiful scenery, `Reds' is a film for you.  One of those biopics that feels like so much more because it is so much more.  This film defies genre for me, for it covers everything, and it does so without ever missing a beat.",1263513600,3,4551,4.65

239364,5,6300214028,"This film is a docu-drama about the 1917 Russian Revolution that transferred political power from the Tsars (royal Romanov family) to a socialist / communist gov't under Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. Also chronicled the start of the Socialist labor and Communist parties in America.

Much of the film is about the American Socialist labor movement of the early teens in NYC as a rebellion against the Industrial Revolution during the late 19th century. The other third of the film shows John Reed in the Russia during the early Communist party formation, trying to get legitimacy from the RU party for the Amer party. While there he wears himself down physically. Then his left-behind wife, Bryant, crosses Finland to St Petersburg too, but too late where Reed dies of typhus (""Jail Fever,"" a sanitation disease caused by bacteria which attack the brain, spread by body lice, which was common in Russia. (only curable with the antibiotics tetracycline, occurs naturally in beer fermentation (Conover, Pfizer 1950 patent) and prevented with insecticide DDT (Muller, 48 Nobel) discovered in 1939).

As an adjunct film of history on the Industrial Revolution, watch the first half of PBS's TV epic by Jared Diamond's ""Guns, Germs and Steel (05)."" It shows how the agricultural and industrial revolutions profoundly affected world politics, including conquest, colonialism, and socialistic communities. Driving former agrarian peoples (serf sharecropper, slavery, feudalism) from the farm to cities and its centers for education was essential to create the artisan worker (middle-class). This also created the economically powerful capitalist-class. The socialistic counter-attack was German Karl Marx and Frederich Engels thesis ""Das Kapital (1867)"" which addressed the exploitation and alienation of the laboring class.

The industrial revolution started in the UK in the late 18th and 19th centuries starting with textile and steel making, canals and rail, and steam power. The Russian political revolution started in Petrograd (St Petersburg) then the largest city and capital of Russia at the time at the eastern-most edge of the Baltic Sea, next to Finland and closest port to W Europe's technology.

It became the industrial center of Russia, with canals cut in the former swamp and in 1718 to the headwaters of Volga River system which is 80 miles from Moscow, iron ore deposits south of Moscow near the Ukraine boarder, coal near Moscow, steam engine technology starting in 1837, Russian Academy of Sciences, Petrograd State U, Technology and Mining Institutes, Medical-Surgical and Naval Academies and migration of the serfs emancipated by Alexander II starting in 1861. The 1916 Petrograd population was 2.4 million housed in large community housing building projects.

Much of Beatty's Russia was filmed in Finland with expensive recreation of Russian sets, as he botched getting permission from the former USSR gov't in the late 70s, as they were in the midst of Soviet War in Afghanistan (79-89) with the US, UK, and PRChina supporting the Muslim Mujahideen rebels in a guerrilla war. This was a half-decade before Perestroika economic restructuring was starting in 1986 by Gorbachev, as centralized-management model of Soviet industry and agriculture was failing due, in part, with the debilitating Afghan war.

He initially went to visit Moscow's centralized film industry, MOSFilm, but started off on the wrong foot, calling the 1917 Oktoberist Revolution a mere ""Bolshevik takeover."" Did this backlash cause the film not adequately described in the ""Reds"" was the revolutionary proletariat (labor class), Vladimir Lenin, and the formation of the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (RSDLP)? The RSDLP later formed the Russian Communist Party. Vladimir Lenin (as Roger Sloman) appearance in ""Reds"" was a mere look-alike in the background, even though he was elected Chmn of the Soviet Congress at 47 years old on 8 Nov 1917.

Instead Beatty's dialog emphasized Reed's conflict with Grigory Zinoviev (as Jerzy Kosinski) who was one of Lenin's closest aides. Before the Oktoberist 1917 revolution, he wrote a position paper against an armed revolution against the weakened, inbred Tsarist monarchy. This caused Zinoviev's temporary expulsion from the Soviet Central Committee and eventual imprisonment for treason.

Beatty's film did not have an epilogue where Stalin's rise to power after Lenin's (1870-1924) (Kazan U, LLB U StPetersburg, taught Geneva U) assassination attempt (1918), refusing hospitalization and resulting a long debilitating 6-year illness. Stalin emphasized industrial and agricultural development away from the vulnerable Baltic after WW I towards the interior Moscow, Volga River and Ural Mts dividing Europe and Soviet Asia.

Good thing that Beatty had essentially a blank check from Paramount / Gulf+Western coffers as filming took about a year and burned up over a million feet of film, that was specially processed in Rome, Italy, in order to get the special dark filming effects, pioneered by cinematographer Vittorio Storaro, who won 3 Oscars, including ""Apocalypse Now (79)"" (Coppola, dir, 2 Oscars) and ""The Last Emperor (87)"" (Bertolucci, dir, 9 Oscars).

ENR is a proprietary Technicolor process (originally developed for Vittorio Storaro by Technicolor-Rome by three employees with initials E, N & R). It is one of the many bleach retention processes: after the bleach bath in the pos process, the film is passed through a black and white developer which reconverts the bleached silver ions to silver, which is not removed in the fixer. The result is a very contrasty and desaturated image, with particularly rich blacks but subdued colors.

Overall, a great docudrama movie, well researched and well filmed. But too long, 3 1/4 hrs. In the movie marketplace it did poorly only grossing at the box office of $40M, with a production budget $32M. Paramount lost money on American Communist party history.",1240704000,4,5951,5.401939655172414

I have to admit I like this kind of film because it shows real people being moved by real world events. How they react or respond or resist to the power that overwhelms them makes for great cinama when it's done right. And this movie does it right. Directed by Warren Beatty who won the Oscar for his efforts the presentation of the turn of events suurounding the Communist Revolution is clearly presented. Some great performances by Diane Keaton, Jack Nicholson and Maureen Stapleton add major 'meat' to the body of the narrative.

Sometimes a little drawn-out especially when Beatty -playing the lead character John Reed - starts preaching to the Revolution leaders about his insistence that they not alter his writings ( he believes firmly in the power of communism and it's ability to save the American worker from the rule of the Capitalists and writes speeches for them about this ) and when he's trying to explain why Communism is a seemingly perfect economic system. But the scenes change quickly and the next stage in the revolution shows itself to be just as heartless as any other contrivance created by people determined to improve their economic plight.

The Blu-ray image is very good, the sound is very good, the bigger-than-life feel you get watching these people torture themselves and others is palpable to the extreme at times but the action moves along. I've noticed when I watch movies like this I find myself really grasping the jist of the story only after having viewed it several times. This is that type of movie.

The low budget look of the film, combined with its mediocre actors and gargantuan length (188 minutes) give ""Reds"" the feel of one of those 80s mini-series.

Ignorance, youth and over-confidence are a lethal combination.  Made shortly after the similar youthful outburts of the 1960s, the movie could easily have used that backdrop for the same purpose.

The revolution began with high hopes and sank into an Orwellian slough, just as many of the 1960s visionaries became the conservative suburbanites of the following decades.  The supposed father of the Russian Revolution was Karl Marx, but in short order all that remained of him was his poster picture--because his ideals, as John Reed and Louise Bryant would discover, were impossible, e.g., the abolition of all private property.

Reed died early, before the purges, before the advent of Stalin--who would probably have killed Reed.  Bryant lived on, married a U.S. ambassador and lived in Paris, where her scandalous behavior was of a different sort.  The movie doesn't go into all that, any more than ""Hair"" went into the rise of Ronald Reagan.

The acting in this movie is superb, flawless.  The use of witnesses is especually effective, although I wish they had been labeled.  I recognized some but not all of them.

239474,5,6300214028,"I'm an undergraduate in history at Harvard, and I've studied the Russian Revolution with some degree of depth, but all the books in the world could never succeed in doing what ""Reds"" did for me, which was truly to give me a feeling for what it FELT like to experience those events.  The political atmosphere, the material environments, all of these are meticulously (and rather accurately) reproduced, and all of this is combined with a compelling narrative propelled by difficult personal and political choices that the main characters must make.

(Examples:  Support Woodrow Wilson or not?  Struggle for the revolution in the USA or Russia?  Concerning the Russian workers, whether going on strike will be a betrayal of their Russian soldiers and American allies, or whether that would be a comradely gesture that would set an example and ignite revolution around the whole world?  Accept the Bolshevik rationalizations for their dictatorial ways, or reject the Bolsheviks?  Etc.  The movie doesn't just pose such questions; the movie shows how ordinary people (soldiers, workers), as well as the main characters, wrestled with these questions, and the window into this history that the movie provides is simply fascinating.)

That's what truly makes the movie work:  the detail and sophistication given to the intricate political questions.  For these, the movie does not prescribe normative answers, only a view to how these particular characters responded.  I really do not understand the reviews arguing that ""Reds"" glorifies communism or the Soviet Union.  Reds includes plenty of hard-hitting skepticism and criticism of communism and the Soviet Union from the likes of Emma Goldman, Jack Nicholson's O'Neill, and some of the documentary-style witnesses.  It would have been much easier to make a movie that hammers a single, unified message into the viewer, but ""Reds"" doesn't do that.  Throughout, the movie constantly confronts the characters and viewers with tough questions:  was the revolution worth it?  Are Reed and Bryant deluding themselves, as O'Neill claims?  Which comes first, revolution or love?  Are they mutually exclusive?  What does it take for a person like Reed to balance between being an objective journalist, a creative artist, a partisan for his true political feelings, and a lover to his wife?  Questions like these (that the film never definitely tries to solve for the viewer) are what keep the viewer gripped to the movie and make every minute of the 3 and a half-hour movie worth it.  The only thing that this movie demands from the viewer is an open mind, and unfortunately it seems that that is too much to ask from some viewers.",1214870400,10,2670,5.146171693735499

239476,5,6300214028,"Beatty was perhaps a little old to be cast as John Reed, but his empathy
for the character made up for it(and Beatty is, afterall, one of the
ageless, Dick Clark-types).

Few actors could be better suited to their respective roles than Jack
Nicholson as Eugene O'Neill, and Maureen Stapleton as Emma Goldman.

If I had one wish for the movie, it would be for a bit more on the tragic
life of Louise Bryant after Reed's death.

Much of the screenplay's depiction of Reed's thinking while in Russia was
necessarily speculative, and, indeed apocryphal, but nevertheless fairly
sound, in my opinion.

It deserved an Oscar, but was, alas, upstaged by On Golden Pond that year
(which also deserved an Oscar).",1214784000,,702,4.776859504132231
239477,4,6300214028,"When I saw ""Reds"" on the big screen in 1982, I admired the strong casting and performances, the photography and editing, and the ingenious use of interviews by elderly witnesses.  But I strongly disliked its romanticizing of the Bolsheviks, the Russian Revolution, and the American radicals of the early 20th century.  I disliked how it romanticized free love and dismissed marriage.

Over the years, then, I have generally dissed the movie.  When I watched the film recently, however, I gained a new respect for it.  Why did I have a different reaction?

My first take on Beatty's treatment of the period still seems accurate.  In the interview that is a ""special feature"" of the 25th anniversary edition DVD, he confirms that he intended the film to honor the socialists and Communists of the nineteen-teens and 1920s.  And the film, Beatty tells us, ""was very much motivated by my own political activism at that time -- probably had a lot to do with what I thought was a mistaken American paranoia about Communism and most particularly in Vietnam.""

In the DVD interview, Beatty mentions his collaboration with ""the British playwright Trevor Griffith who was a very strict Marxist who I felt would keep me or John Reed in line with the dogmatism of it.""  Beatty feared that a movie with such ""political, polemical, dialectical"" dimensions could not find financing.

Finally, Beatty admires ""those who really thought something else would be possible in American politics.""  It seems possible that he imagined or idealized a counterfactual history that would have unfolded if America had embraced the socialist vision.

A quarter century has now passed since the film was released.  The Soviet Union no longer exists.  Now, we know the twin Soviet promises -- a better material life and human equality -- were frauds.  Now, we know that the Bolsheviks, Lenin, and Stalin killed millions.  Now, we know about the frozen hell of the Gulag camps.  Now, we wonder how the utopian claims of Communism could be so admired by intellectuals in the West when the reality of life in the Soviet Union was so cruel, capricious, and bloody.

In the same quarter century, there has been more historical research on socialism, American Communism, and the characters portrayed in the film -- John Reed, Louise Bryant, Max Eastman, Emma Goldman, and Eugene O'Neill among them.  (Consulting Wikipedia is a good first step to learning more about them.)  Those were complex times and complex personalities, to be sure, but one now notices that -- whether from the need to compress the story or to make it more palatable -- the script scrubbed away some dark corners of their characters.

So when in 2008 we hear Beatty, Diane Keaton, and Jack Nicholson speak the political, polemical, and dialectical lines in the dialog -- lines intended to be faithful to John Reed's times -- we react differently.  We know more about Soviet dishonesty and more about the crimes the carefully chosen words of the screenplay were designed to smooth over.  In a scene with Edith Stapleton playing Emma Goldman, for instance, we hear John Reed justify the Revolution's suppression of dissent.  Now, we recall that Fidel Castro and Saddam Hussein said many of the same things.

Similarly, the script was written to challenge conventional values.  In the years since the film was made, for instance, Americans have intensely debated marriage.  Twenty-first century Americans may read Diane Keaton's portrayal of Louise Bryant differently -- that the free love she spoke for was at war with her desire for commitment and fidelity.  Could it be that those ""bourgeois"" values are not mere social constructs but are, rather, ""written in the heart""?

I conclude, then, that ""Reds"" is a great movie, but in a way Warren Beatty did not intend.  Twenty-five years after it was released, the film he intended to honor the socialists and challenge American ""paranoia"" about Communism conveys instead many ugly truths about Communism, socialism, political and social radicalism, and ... John Reed.

REDS

Review

By Richard E. Noble

Reds is a combination documentary and romance film.
John Reed is a famous/infamous American, radical, historical figure. He was an aspiring journalist, writer and poet during one of the most explosive, revolutionary periods in American history.

He was an avid Communist and active in the U.S. for many years. He was in my hometown of Lawrence, MA in 1912 along with Big Bill Haywood and the IWW for the well documented Bread and Roses Strike.

He was in Paterson, New Jersey, for the silk strike in 1913 and was a major influence in ""The Pageant of the Paterson Strike,"" a radical union play put on to help raise money for the strikers and their families and promote worldwide attention to the cause of labor struggles throughout the world.

He wrote about the Ludlow Massacre and other American Labor conflicts.

He is most famous as an American journalist and writer for his book ""Ten Days That Shook the World."" He travelled to Russia after the Russian Army had walked off the battlefields of Europe in 1917 during the First World War. The entire Russian Army quit the ""Capitalist"" conflict and went home to take care of business. They would kill Czar Nicolas II, topple the centuries old regime and attempt by way of armed and violent revolution to establish a new democratic government. And John Reed was there to record the event.

He was a Harvard graduate.

The study of the Union Movement here in the U.S. and consequently the American Communist and Socialist parties, has been purposely neglected and even hidden from the American people. Yet the battle over workers' rights, social justice and human equality brought this nation to the brink of a second Civil War.

The battle rages on today in our present political system. Hatred for the American worker and his right to earn a living wage is still prevalent in our political system and throughout the populace.

The film story centers on the love story between John Reed and Louise Bryant. I was not aware of the extent of this gripping romance until seeing this movie. It was quite an outstanding love affair and Beatty does a fantastic job in documenting and recording it.

It is definitely on the Doctor Zhivago level in story and film making.

I bought the film because of its documentary significance and my interest in the American Labor Movement.

There are interviews with famous radicals, writers, American Communist and Socialists.
Despite all the negative propaganda the American Communists and Socialists and their political parties and organizations did more to promote fair pay, the elimination and exploitation of child labor, good working conditions, sexual equality and free speech here at home than all other groups, parties, armies and social movement combined.

I feel that from an historical point of view knowing more about this time period and these famous radicals is crucial to a proper understanding of American history.

Our present overall understanding of this time and these people and their movements is convoluted and distorted to say the least.

This movie, besides its obvious Russian historical value, is American History.
Watch what happened then and get a better understanding of what is happening around you here in America today.

PS: Believe it or not I was looking for a copy of this film for years. I had the wrong director/producer and I couldn't find it. Finally I stumbled onto Warren Beatty and there it was.

It was done quite well - not many movies in the United States with an American communist hero as the subject matter.

Beatty concentrates on the love story involved, which is probably the only way that this subject would ever have been acceptable in America.

I wish someone would do the life story of Karl Marks in the same manner.

Marks' life involves a fantastic love story - along with his political, social, and economic disaster. It would make a wonderful movie - but would probably have as much box office success as Reds.

I wanted this movie because of the history involved, but the great and human rendition of the love story involved was like frosting on the cake.

This was a combination documentary, history lecture, and romantic love story. I would guess that this would have to be considered the greatest production of Beatty's career. It is quite a movie - and done in a balanced, non-judgemental way. I really enjoyed it.

239574,4,6300214028,"In spite of the fact that it does feel like a vanity project, this is the penulimate Warren Beatty movie.  It's like watching a David Lean movie.  The arguments that Beatty and Keaton are just marvelous and this is one of her performances and that's saying something.  Also Jack Nicholson who practically steals every scene he's in.  In fact, there's a large supporting cast at the top of their game and that says something about Beatty's skill as a director.  He considerably slowed down his input after this, probably thinking how's he ever going to top this.  My only real complaint are the witnesses, not that they're there, they serve their function well as a Greek chorus.  But there's no identification and guessing their identies distracts from the movie.  It was fun seeing Gene Hackman and Beatty share the screen again.  My second favorite Beatty movie is ""Bonnie and Clyde.""",1192579200,,886,4.8533333333333335

His ingenious use of actual interviews with those who knew the Greenwich Village couple--including Henry Miller and Rebecca West--gives the picture an extra depth and dramatic veracity. But it's the chemistry between Beatty's uncompromising Reed, a man devoted to the principle of class struggle, and Keaton's fiercely independent Bryant that's sure to rouse your inner rebel. With terrific support from Maureen Stapleton (as Emma Goldman), and Jack Nicholson (as cynical playwright Eugene O'Neill), ""Reds"" is a film that embraces love and politics without giving short shrift to either.",1183939200,2,813,5.783333333333333
239576,5,6300214028,"Hollywood's been waiting a long time for this one. The Cold War pretty much made the Revolution a taboo subject. By the time Beatty got around to it, the proletariat had disappeared to be replaced by American college kids with trust funds and drugs arrests. Still, it is good to see this extraordinary historic event dramatized so well and performed so memorably, even if it stars Beatty playing a whiny, post-Watergate-type journalist who believed in the truth. The Bolsheviks had to put him wise on a few things. Jack Nicholson plays Eugene O'Neil, the great cynical playwright, whose marvelous performance put young Diane Keaton's silly Woody Allen impersonation in a new light. Overall, it is unique in its mainstream use of interviews to extend (pad?) the narrative. I found these interviews a real high light, especially the extended use of Henry Miller who is a hoot. Beatty never really fulfilled his promise after this stunning film. Like Costner, his seems to have had one masterpiece in him and then he shrank back to size.",1183593600,,1034,4.948275862068965

On top of the film - which looks great - you get some great extras that provide a fascinating look at the history of this movie.  The one thing that bothers me is the absence of the original movie trailer.  It's a bit ridiculous when a DVD hits the market, sometimes a few months after it was in the theaters, and includes the trailer.  We were watching that trailer on TV not that long ago!  It's much more interesting for classic movies to include the trailer when it's released on DVD to give us a complete historical package.

239660,4,6300214028,"As a disclaimer I must tell you that I am a big fan of the film epic, especially from the director, David Lean, who directed Dr. Zhivago and Lawrence of Arabia. In Reds, there are long treks across the frozen tundra and men on horseback attacking trains that pay homage to Lean.

There are spectacular scenes and attention to detail that make the film a visual treat. The cinematography earns the Oscar it got in 1982 and looks wonderful on DVD. It really doesn't look over 25 years old partly because it probably got cleaned up for the DVD, but also because of the expert lighting and cinematography. I can't imagine what it looks like in the HD version.

There are some who say that Beatty glorifies communism. I would disagree.  Beatty instead glorifies the act of revolution and idealism whether it is the free love movement or the revolution against war and for the liberation of workers. There is excitement of political organizing and passion of actually overturning oppression. This is why many would feel the first part of Reds is better than the second. The second part shows the consequences of the revolution whether it is hurting a lover or finding that the revolt only replaced tyranny with tyranny.

I really appreciate the inter-cutting of interviews with witnesses to that time in history. These men and women knew the main characters in the film and share their opinions and remembrances with great charm.

At 195 minutes, the film is rather long -- too long. The film would have benefited from tighter editing and little less indulgence. With that being said, this film earns a solid B and is worth a watch.",1179532800,3,1626,4.731448763250883

239663,5,6300214028,"The important contribution of John Reed to the revolutionary movement here in America before World War I and later during the Russian revolution and its aftermath has never been fully appreciated. His reportage of the Russian Revolution gathered in Ten Days That Shook The World is a classic of journalistic coverage. Thus, Warren Beatty, whatever his personal motives, has done a great service in filming the life of this ""traitor to his class"" (and his Harvard Class of 1910) and partisan of the international working class.

As usual with such commercial enterprises the order of things gets switched in the wrong direction. The love affair between Reed (played by Beatty) and budding writer and early feminist Louise Bryant (Diane Keaton) (and a little third party intervention by the playwright Eugene O'Neill, played by Jack Nicholson) is set against the backdrop of the Russian Revolution not the other way around, but such is cinematic license. More than most film depictions this one mainly gets the story straight; the early radical free lance journalist who wins his spurs covering the Mexican Revolution; the bohemian Greenwich Village life including its socialite partrons like Mabel Dodge; the socialist fight against American participation in World War I; the turmoil in socialist (and anarchist) ranks over support to the Russian Revolution; and, an interesting segment on the seemingly incomprehensible in-fighting in the early communist movement between the foreign-language federations and the Reed-led American-born ""Natives"". Those 'natives', like James Cannon, Earl Browder and Willaim Z. Foster in the course of events would form the leadership of the party through most of the twenties when the cadre still wanted to make a revolution here and not just cheer on the Russian Revolution from afar. A nice touch in the film is the interspersing of commentaries by those, friend and foe, who knew or knew of Reed or were around during this time. See this movie",1172016000,9,1980,5.246056782334385

239666,4,6300214028,"'Reds' is the true story of American communist John ""Jack"" Reed, his relationship with journalist Louise Bryant, and the overall ""leftist"" movement in America during WW1 and it's aftermath. Jack Reed was a journalist and fiery leftist activist who frequently supported union causes and other workers movements. His circle of friends consisted of writer Eugene O'Neil, anarchist Emma Goldman, and feminist journalist Louise Bryant who would become his wife. The film essentially follows Jack as he progresses from a journalist and activist to a full-fledged communist. After being heavily involved in workers causes and the anti-war movement at home, Jack decides to go to Russia to cover the unfolding Bolshevik revolution. It is here where he becomes an active supporter of the international communist revolution and even rubs elbows with figures such as Lenin, Trotsky, and Radek. One of the sub-plots of the film is Reed's turbulent relationship with Lousie Bryant. I found their relationship to be very strange but moving in it's own right.

Although it started off a bit slow, 'Reds' developed into a very engrossing film. Not only was it a film about the American leftist movement, but also a good portrayal of the Russian Revolution. I found the film to be sympathetic to the person of Jack Reed and his original friends but not necessarily the communist movement. On the contrary, the film shows the growing disillusionment of Reed's friends, and eventually Reed himself, as the ""party"" evolved into the totalitarian monster that it was. There was a sense of tragic irony that the movement that they helped create turned out to be worse than the ""evils"" they set out to destroy. All in all, 'Reds' is a compelling historical drama about a little-known portion of American history. I would recommend it highly to any lover of history or student of political movements. My only warning would be to those who don't like long films. 'Reds' clocks in at just over four hours long.",1170547200,7,1983,5.045731707317073
239667,4,6300214028,"It's surprising, 25 years later, how little ""Reds"" has influenced movie making.  At the time of its release, Warren Beatty's use of real-life witnesses seemed to open up new doors for historical films.  Beatty proved that you could stop the action and bring in real people with knowledge of the events and strong points of view (often contradictory) and not just lend authenticity to the story, but also maintain the emotional connection between audience and character.  Within two years, Woody Allen satirized ""Reds"" by using Saul Bellow, Susan Sontag and others as ""witnesses"" of his fictional Leonard Zelig.  And then, the technique was just forgotten.

Perhaps the problem is that everyone remembers what didn't work in ""Reds"" more clearly than what did work.  Beatty gave one of his best performances, but his limitation as an actor is that he wants to be loved too much and will never allow his charcters to look unflattering.  ""Reds"" would have worked better without Beatty's shaggy dog portrayal.  Diane Keaton does everything she can to make her Louise Bryant work, but the casting still seems off to me.  Everyone else in the movie is perfectly cast, especially Nicholson in a very low key portrayal of Eugene O'Neill and Maureen Stapleton, a highly deserving Oscar winner for her portrayal of Emma Goldman.  Keaton is just a bit too flighty to play such an intellectual heroine.

Because of the casting, the love story is hit and miss, sometimes working (especially the early scenes), but growing more tedious as the film progresses.  Everything else about the movie succeeds brilliantly.  Yes, ""Reds"" is very long.  And it's also about communists ... not just American ones either, Russians too.  But within the complicated plot, you can see why the Soviet experiment failed ... how the American left felt betrayed by the shift from anarchism to communism (a theme of Thomas Pynchon's new novel ""Against the Day"", set in the same era.)  You can also see how Woodrow Wilson's crackdown on war dissent led to very un-American outcomes, such as the deportation of native born Americans.

If only Beatty had cast someone else in the lead and fought his impulse to give his girlfriend a job, ""Reds"" could have been one of the greatest films in history.  Instead, it is very good and more deserving of attention.  Any screenwriter in a full on Charlie Kaufman panic over how to adapt a difficult book should take a look at ""Reds"" and consider whether Beatty's witnesses might be the answer.",1170028800,4,2496,4.92822966507177

Jack Reed and Louise Bryant were journalists, lovers, and ultimately revolutionaries who documented the rise of Communism in Russia.  Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton were brilliant as the two main characters, and the supporting caste was just as magnificent.

The story told in Reds might seem somewhat obscure to most Americans today.  Few know who Reed, Bryant, Max Eastman and Emma Goldman were, and fifteen years after the fall of the Soviet Union a movie that documents (some who obviously haven't watched it all the way through assert that it glorifies) the rise of Communism in Russia would appear to be dated at best.  Reds should not be passed up, however. It depicts a world in which revolutionary change, great literary and artistic experimentation, and mindless repression coexisted.

239880,4,6300214028,"Highly, highly recommended for those who enjoy lush, historical biopics, ""Reds"" skillfully and entertainingly combines intelligent, thoughtful political discourse and sweeping romantic drama, resulting in a movie that flies by despite its three hour-plus length.

Keep an eye out for how the mundane constantly clashes with the epic during the course of the movie: John Reed and Louise Bryant indulge in lofty political discourse on events that are changing the world as Reed is comically burning dinner in the kitchen; soap opera-ish affairs are entered into and abandoned as governments topple and new ones take their place; a critical meeting to assure the future of the socialist movement in the United States is missed because of a sick baby that needs tending.  This constant and clever juxtaposition of the personal and the epic humanizes the sweeping events on display, reminding us that real people living real lives were at the heart of these world-shaking events, not just academic and political arguments.

To enjoy ""Reds"", one doesn't have to be a particular proponent of socialism past or present.  I'm certainly not.  You simply need to be someone who enjoys intelligent, involving movies that illuminate the people and events at the heart of notable periods of history.  And ""Reds"" is certainly such a movie.  Of course, it helps that John Reed and Louise Bryant are generally portrayed as sympathetic people whose motivations are admirable even if one doesn't agree with their politics.

This new, 25th Anniversary Edition DVD of ""Reds"" is well worth the modest price.  The crisp yet warm widescreen visuals are almost startlingly clear; the original theatrical intermission break (in a small but nice touch) is preserved at the end of the first disc; and there are very generous extra features that further illuminate the topics covered in the film.

In short, this one's a keeper.",1164585600,26,1899,5.176470588235294
239881,4,6300214028,"Even at its epic length of 195 minutes, Warren Beatty's quadruple hat trick as producer, director, co-screenwriter (with Trevor Griffiths) and star of this 1981 historical drama feels surprisingly intimate despite periodic efforts at David Lean-style grandiosity. Finally on DVD in a pristine print transfer, it's hard to believe it's been a quarter century since I've seen this movie, yet it still casts an intriguing spell probably because Beatty seems so enraptured by the turbulent story of John Reed, the American journalist-turned-Communist activist who provided a vital and controversial first-hand account of the Russian Revolution of 1917, ""Ten Days That Shook the World"".

The film itself covers the last five years of the young writer's life (he was only 32 when he died), and Beatty smartly uses talking heads by way of 31 surviving eyewitnesses of the period as a means to explain the context of the story being told. Covering the full political spectrum from left to right, none are identified outright, but a few are quite famous like writer Henry Miller, journalist Adela Rogers St. John and comedian George Jessel. This approach allows the core of the movie to be the love story between Reed and his wife Louise Bryant, a fellow writer who became his companion on his first trip to Russia. Theirs is a tempestuous relationship driven by their increasing politicization and complicated by adultery and conflicting priorities. They socialize in an elite circle, which includes socialist writer Max Eastman, political anarchist Emma Goldman and playwright Eugene O' Neill, with whom Bryant has a passionate affair.

Divided into two parts (and consequently separated into two discs for the DVD release), the first part focuses on Reed and Bryant's involvement with political and labor disputes stateside and their fits-and-starts courtship, climaxing with their trip to Russia during the revolution. The second half shows them inspired by their experiences in Russia with Reed trying to lead the Communist party back in the U.S. but getting bogged down by bureaucracy in both countries. It all ends in an extravagant series of Zhivago-like sequences that crank up the romance quotient of the entire venture. Except for the occasional lapses into Hollywood formula, this is intelligent filmmaking if rather dense, and the politics become especially cumbersome in the second half with the actors resorting to speechifying.

Beatty is as good as he's ever been as Reed, though his innately elliptical nature sometimes undermines the open idealism of the character he's portraying. With her self-effacing Annie Hall mannerisms held in check, Diane Keaton fulfills the comparatively more difficult role as the mercurial Bryant since she initially comes across as an embittered dilettante and then evolves in a somewhat disjointed manner to become the supportive wife. Both are so internally motivated as actors that they come across as a bit too contemporary and human-sized for such a romantic epic. Better is Jack Nicholson who threatens to steal the film as the cynically anguished O'Neill, especially in a hostile, painfully honest confrontation scene with Keaton. As Goldman, Maureen Stapleton transcends the dogma of her obsessive character with an undercurrent of humanity. Gene Hackman, Edward Herrmann, Paul Sorvino and writer Jerzy Kosinski are solid in smaller roles.

Not too surprisingly, the technical aspects are impressive from Vittorio Storaro's cinematography, which ranges from the sepia tones of the early scenes to the bold colors used during the revolution montage, to Stephen Sondheim's original music score, which matches well with the period music used, to Richard Sylbert's production design. The 2006 DVD comes with just two extras - a trailer made for the DVD on the first disc, and an enlightening documentary in seven parts on the second disc, ""Witness to Reds"" by Laurent Bouzereau, which runs over an hour. Despite his open reservations about providing commentary on the film, Beatty is interviewed extensively, and other surviving key cast and crew members are included as well, including a surprisingly open Nicholson. Keaton unfortunately chose not to participate.

Beatty and Keaton give strong 70s-ish performances, and Nicholson is spellbinding as Eugene O'Neill.  The ""witnesses"" such as Henry Miller are funny, and insightful.  The remaining TWO AND A HALF HOURS, however, are intermitent at best.

So it was with great anticipation I went to see Reds in early 1982. I thought it was thought provoking, and a history lover's dream. In high school we had to take Americanism vs. Communism (this was during the Kennedy Years 1960-63). However, I have yet to find anyone down here who would share my enthusiasm without being labeled a ""communist sympathizer"". At the time, I worked for a large metro newspaper and on Monday morning I came in raving about the movie, and you should have seen the look on the ""suits"". One of them frankly told me, ""I'm not interested in communist movies."" Well, that was almost 25 years ago. Now I run my own business and I'm still not a communist sympathizer but do enjoy a masterful job of moviemaking. Beatty really did an outstanding job as director as well as Dianne Keaton, Nicholson, Stapleton and others. It is sweeping, grandiose and sad. But back in 1981, when the movie was released you still had a lot of right-winged sentiments and a lot of old timers left over from the McCarthy 50's that saw this movie as communist propoganda. You can look at it anyway you want. I choose to look at it as a fairly accurate historical depiction of the years 1912-17 and the Russian Revolution and all the idealistic Americans involved in New York, and all the heartbreak too. Guess what! Now that I run my own business, I don't have to meet with the suits around the water cooler on Monday morning. Actually, I think we've regressed as a country in accepting different intellectual views. Be careful, If you buy this movie, big brother may write your name down on a list.

He had been long resistant to doing DVD extras for his movies but seems to have changed his mind for this title perhaps because it was such a personal project. There are seven featurettes that can be viewed separately or altogether. For fans, there are brand new interviews with many of the major players: Beatty, Jack Nicholson, Paul Sorvino, cinematographer Vittorio Storaro and others.

""Witness to Reds: The Rising"" traces the origins of the film. Beatty was interested in making a film about the development of the American left from 1915 to 1920 and, in particular, John Reed and his incredible, albeit brief life.

""Witness to Reds: Comrades"" features Beatty talking about he cast the movie. Beatty convinced Jack Nicholson to play O'Neill by saying that he was the only actor who could take Diane Keaton away from him in a movie.

""Witness to Reds: Testimonials"" examines the testimonial segments in the film with people who actually knew the historical figures depicted in the movie. It was an interesting conceit that gave Reds a quasi-documentary feel and provided exposition that Beatty wouldn't have to dramatize.

""Witness to Reds: The March"" examines the pre-production phase. Beatty almost got the chance to shoot in Russia but made a political faux pas and so he had to shoot elsewhere.

""Witness to Reds: The Revolution - Part 1"" takes a look at the politics of the film. Fellow cast members talk about how Beatty's personal philosophy is mirrored in the movie.

""Witness to Reds: The Revolution - Part 2"" examines Beatty's fascination with Reed's internal conflict between arts and politics. He stuck to historical facts and chronology whenever possible. The attention to period detail is also looked at.

Witness to Reds: Propaganda"" examines the post-production and legacy of the film. The actor says that the studio was completely supportive of Reds but that he did not do any interviews for it at the time because he felt that he would just get in the way.",1161561600,15,2091,4.94017094017094

It harks back to a time when Hollywood studios would take a chance and make an interesting, complex film.  It runs 195 minutes, but it feels short, because it's so outstanding.  I really liked the political discussions in the film.  The characters of the film really believed in what they were saying, especially John Reed (Beatty) and Emma Goldman (played by Maureen Stapleton).  Despite the fact that their idealism was short lived, you feel their passion.  You also feel sympathy for Eugene O'Neil (played by Jack Nicholson).  It turns out his cynical attitude towards politics was correct.  Hollywood studios should realise that you can make films like this along with your usual assembly ones.

239981,5,6300214028,"I watched ""Reds"" the other night for the first time.  I wondered how I may have perceived it had I seen it when it came out, a decade or so before the fall of the Soviet Union rather a a decade or so after it.  I had to make a deal with myself; I was going to watch the movie and appreciate it as a movie rather than debate the merits of glorifying socialism.  I must have succeeded in that approach because I gave the movie a 5 star rating.  I felt an impressive aspect of ""Reds"" was the periodic inclusion of on-camera first person recollections.  We saw the real witnesses of the persons, times, and events that we were watching.  It certainly added credibility to what we were seeing unfold and it also added perspective.  ""Reds"" is first and foremost a love story and the two lovers are (surprize!) Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton.  I have to admit that the two of them did very good work.  I have to give Beatty a good deal of credit for his role as director for which he, not surprizingly, won an Oscar.  I'm sure that his hard work made it difficult to edit the film down to the normal two-hour feature film length.  I'll admit that I watched the movie, on tape, over the course of three successive evenings but I don't think that I lost any appreciation of the film.  I probably could have told you just what all could have been cut if I had watched it all in one sitting.  I'll accept that some movies (and ""Dr. Zhivago"" comes to mind as a logical comparison) just need more time to tell a more expansive story.

Beatty plays Jack Reed who wrote ""Ten Days that Shook the World"" which did a lot of shaking of its' own when it came out.  In pursuit of a combined socialist/journalist's dream, Reed found himself in Russia on the eve of the October Revolution.  The scenes of that and other Russian events are quite impressive in ""Reds"".  Long before we get to that point in time, we see a relationship develop between a class conscious writer and a wannabe class conscious writer.  The emergence of love between the fighter of proletarian causes and the fighter of feminist causes makes for a different sort of love story.  The expressed opinions don't always match up neatly with the heartfelt opinions.  I give Beatty grudging praise for his ability and willingness to bring out this concept in ""Reds"" as well as his look at an imperfect political solution to a real social problem.  While there is plenty of Leftist propaganda to duck, Jack Reed wasn't exactly going to morph into Ronald Reagan by the film's end.  Yet Beatty allowed the passion of the Movement to come to life and the seeds of its' own destruction to also come to life in ""Reds"".  The scene towards the end with Maureen Stapleton (another deserving Oscar-winner from ""Reds"") was brilliantly done with an economy of words that conveyed an abundance of nuance.  Through it all is the oft-interrupted romance of Beatty and Keaton who seem to go to extremes in their seperations and reunions.  I'm not sure I ever saw a ""blockbuster"" movie that was ever this passionate.  The film's ability to maintain that passion over three houres is its' greatest strength",1159574400,16,3133,4.520426287744227

It's a true, panoramic story about the American left (who splinter and implode among themselves)and the Russian Revolution, taking place on two continents.  Conservatives living in Red States probably will hate it, unless they are willing to look beyond ideology to more basic, human, tragic themes.

239983,5,6300214028,"In 1981, the year Reds was released, the world was seeing a decayed and backrupt political system. Communissim was gasping its last breath in Romania, Serbia. Hungry, Poland and the former Yugosalavia and Czechoslovakia. The ""Red Menance"" was not so scary afterall. Regan was still in the White House and could watch the Berlin Wall crumble on TV. Such were the times when Warren Beatty choose to tell the story of John Reed. Here was history's eye whitness to the birth of the longest and most pervasive totalitarian rule the world would ever know. And how was it that an American journalist came to tell the story? Beatty manages to succeed on several levels. First and foremost the story is woven out over three plus hours with such skill and precision that I would not want a single scene cut. I have absolutely no quarrel with the editing. The story simply could not be told and the impact would not be as great were it even twenty minutes shorter.

After giving us access to the events central to the story, Warren Beatty takes us into the life behind the story, the life of John Reed, an extarordinary man, who covered the story for the leftest newspaper ""The Masses"". If all this were not enough, we're also allowed to explore Reed's life, through the eyes and words of some of the most dynamic and influencial personalities of the early twentith century. Like a real life ""Rag Time"" or ""Forest Gump"" Reed's life becomes a lightening rod, attracting and interacting with famous personalities like Eugene O'Neil, played by Jack Nicholson with tremendous intensity and depth and Emma Goldman, played by Maureen Stapleton. She delivers an oscar worthy supporting performance and one of her finest roles ever. These and many others provide a panoramic view of world shattering events that took place in Eastern Europe and Russia in the early part of the last century. To Beatty's credit he manages to inter-weave these characters into  chronological order, placing them in different parts of the world at precise moments in history. This historical backdrop provides the emotional core within the relationship between the central characters, played with superlative chemestry by Beatty and Keaton.

Warren Beatty hit his stride with Reds. This is film making that deserves to be talked about and compared with other great non-fiction epics like Ghandhi, Patton and Lawrence Of Arabia. Reds succeds in taking a complex story and distilling it down to its most essential elements. We care deeply about the relationship between John Reed and Louise Bryant and how they were effected by the upheavel of the revolution. Their journey and their story make for three plus hours of extraordinary cinema. I for one can not wait to see this movie finally make its debut on DVD. This is film-making of the very highest level. Here's a movie that will educate and entertain, without being heavey-handed or pompus. It's been long over-due in my book. Bravo Beatty!

I was in my early 20's when this film was originally released, being young, idealistic, wanting to challenge everything.  It was easy to get caught up in the romance of the film -- the struggle with politics, both sexual and social.  But this film has more staying power than most other early 1980's film releases.  I found it to be Beatty's best effort and well deserving of the film awards it garnered.

Be forewarned.  It helps if you have some understanding of world events during that era as well as knowledge of the movers and shakers of that period.  My favorite witness -- Henry Miller!  The quintessential ""sponge"".",1158796800,6,769,4.507246376811594
239985,5,6300214028,"'Reds', directed by and starring Warren Beatty has been called his 'Citizen Kane', comparing Beatty in some ways to Orson Welles. I agree with practically all the other major reviewers below in believing 'Reds' is Beatty's best, before or since, but it is nowhere near the quality of 'Citizen Kane', and it has little in common with Orson Welles directing style. In fact, the two directors to which I think Beatty owes the most for this movie are Woody Allen and Robert Altman. The 'witnesses' segments seem to pop out of 'Annie Hall's similar technique. And, the gimmick of having several people talking at once is pure Altman.

After all these years, I think this movie has not worn as well as many other Oscar also-rans. The one think for which I most often remember this movie is Jack Nicholson's very underplaid role as Eugene O'Neill. This may be one of the very, very, very few roles where our Jack does not ham it up. I saw this in the theatre when it first came out, and unlike some other movies such as 'Apocalypse Now', it does not improve with age, although it is still a worthy dramatization of places and times which are becoming more and more foreign to us.

His brief, but electric scenes with his close friend Beatty made hime realize what he was missing. And the rest is history. Oh and Jack Nicholson as Eugene O'Neill is one of his most understated performances since ""King of Marvin Gardens""

The story is based on a true story of a famous reporter and poet, Jack Reed who recorded this historical event in his best-known book TEN DAYS THAT SHOOK THE WORLD.  The story of the Russian Revolution against the terribly corrupt monarchy and aristocracy and the US right wing suspicious disapproval of it.  The cast is excellent.  Warren Beatty who wrote the film and starred and directed it also included Jack Nicholson and  Diane Keaten who played the role of Beatty's wife, Louise Bryant.  Filled with adventure, history, and romance incorporated into a  revolution that occurred in Russia and in some respects in the US. Since the film was not allowed to be filmed in Russia it was filmed in many, many different countries, from Spain to Finland and some scenes in the US.

Since I watched the film the first time, I've watched it a few more times.  I've come to the conclusion that it should have won Best Picture over Chariots of Fire, which I didn't really care for, but was still a favorite of the movie goers.  But still Ten Days did win 10 awards including best Director, Warren Beatty and several other awards.  I still find it one of the best movies, perhaps the best movie I ever saw, with a cast ""par excellence"", and I've seen lots of films and own hundreds and hundreds of DVD's.  This is still the best of all.

The movie won Academy Awards for the following:[10]

  * Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Maureen Stapleton playing Emma Goldman)
  * Best Cinematography (Vittorio Storaro)
  * Best Director (Warren Beatty)

The film received the following nominations:

  * Best Actor in a Leading Role (Warren Beatty)
  * Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Jack Nicholson)
  * Best Actress in a Leading Role (Diane Keaton)
  * Best Art Direction-Set Decoration (Richard Sylbert, Michael Seirton)
  * Best Costume Design
  * Best Film Editing
  * Best Picture
  * Best Sound
  * Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen.[11]

To date, Reds is the last film to ever receive Academy Award nominations in all four acting categories.

The movie currently holds a high rating on the website Rotten Tomatoes, scoring at 94%. The review stated that, ""At a time when Ronald Reagan had just become the president of the United States, Beatty's sympathetic portrait of notorious American communist John Reed seemed even more daring. Yet, as it continues to age, the film only continues to grow in relevance, assuring its rightful place at the top of the Hollywood canon.  I wonder if anybody remember Chariots of Fire.",1151366400,11,2578,4.803203661327231

I was gratified when Warren Beatty won the Oscar for his work, but I was disappointed the film was not more universally praised and appreciated.  Having spent several weeks in the Soviet Union upon graduating from college in 1967, I was stunned by both the historical detail as well as the emotional power of the film.  We visited John Reed's place on the Kremlin wall, and we discussed aspects of his push for the acceptance of his beliefs in America.  (I was on a college tour for credit -- Political Science and/or Art History -- of most of Europe at the time.)  It seems unfortunate that this aspect of American history is not more universally understood and appreciated.  It is both important and topical, considering all of the media coverage and discussion regarding our current president's use of Executive Privilege masked as ""within the legal limits of the office"" to give authority for surveillance of the citizenry.  It is interesting to compare the ideology of John Reed with the current political climate.  As a gay man concerned with our own equal rights quest, it's great to view the quest of another man somewhat outside the mainstream.  I can only wish someone at the studio which released this film would wake up and give it a full, complete and extended release on DVD.  IT IS QUITE LONG OVERDUE! ! !  Perhaps, Mr. Beatty is paying attention, and he will push for a proper remastering and release on DVD.  It is a great film -- one of significance and with enormous emotional power.  It also has an engaging and evocative musical score.  IT SHOULD NOT BE MISSED.",1138320000,13,1671,4.658703071672355
240091,5,6300214028,"An epic movie chronicling the lives of John Reed (played by Warren Beatty), revolutionary during the early years of the 20th century, author of TEN DAYS THAT SHOOK THE WORLD (about the Communist revolution in Russia), and the only American buried in the wall of the Kremlin; and his wife Louise Bryant (played by Diane Keaton). Actually the movie is nothing more than your typical love story set against a strongly developed historical background. The use of ""witnesses"" who, in a documentary style, relate the historical events of the times (c. 1914-1919) is excellent: their comments are interesting and engaging. The movie is an ambitious one - it shows a strong affinity and feel for the chaotic political times of the WW I era. Obviously a lot of care was taken to get things right - the look of things especially. The love story between Beatty and Keaton presents the most problems, maybe because finally it just seems so typical: boy meets girl, they fall in love, get married, have differences and split up, get back together again, etc. Keaton is to me a single-character actress (high-strung, always on the verge of going off the deep end), and her Annie Hall nervousness is misplaced here. She goes from a self-assertive, independent ""artist-writer"" to the sacrificial good wife who idolozes her husband. Jack Nicholson is good in a cameo role as Eugene O'Neill. A bit long at 195 minutes, but very well done and fascinating to watch, despite the problems.

Hopefully the DVD will be out very shortly.",1126483200,7,1512,4.883268482490273
240092,5,6300214028,"Warren Beatty gives a staggering performance, not only in a difficult lead role but as producer, director and screenwriter, after this film Beatty seemed to rest on his laurels, with a few brief exceptions.  Diane Keaton is also strong, although I think basically miscast.  She is many things but not a femme fatale on the Louise Bryant line, and the picture fails to show why Reed and Eugene O'Neill (not to mention her first husband!) were all so hot for her.  Nicholson is ok as Eugene O'Neill, really a rather underwritten part.  He seems to be playing O'Neill as though O'Neill was a sailor character from THE LAST DETAIL, endlessly skulking over the waterfront.  Stephen Sondheim's glorious, somewhat sardonic anthem shows why this Broadway composer should be writing more for the movies.

It's hard to believe this film came out back in 1981.  When it opened, it seemed as though it might usher in an era of intelligent historical epics about the American experience.  History has taught us otherwise.  Yes, the ""American experience"" for even though the movie is much concerned with the Bolshevik Revolution, and much of the film is set in Russia, it is largely concerned with how Americans took the news of a revolution on the other side of the world.

What would we want from the DVD version of REDS?  That's a question with an easy answer.  And it would be the best extra of the year.  Simply present the unedited testimony of the so-called ""Witnesses"" of the film.  The best part of the movie was seeing, in plain black and white, and so elegantly photographed, actual men and women who were alive before WWI and who (mostly) remembered Bryant and Reed or other Village intellectuals. In REDS their appearances are sometimes frustrating curtailed, in order, of course, to serve the dramatic arc of the movie as a whole.  I'd love to see the enedited footage.  These ""witnesses"" include many who are gone now--indeed I wonder if any of them could still be alive, for the youngest of them was about 80 when the film was shot!  And some of them were geniuses in their own right--Henry Miller, Rebecca West, Will Durant, Scott Nearing, as well as some of the most endearing personalities of the century.  I'm crossing my fingers that Paramount is working this up.",1121731200,5,2270,4.776923076923077

I will have to heartily disagree with Albert Lee.  Although he is helpful in the sense that whatever he rates a film you can be sure the exact opposite is true.  As you can see he has given this film only one star. High praise indeed.",1114646400,9,513,3.9514563106796117
240094,5,6300214028,"A particularly antagonized review cuts this film off, tauting it as liberal pro-Communist romance, full of lies and Hollywood evil. The review concludes that films like Reds don't get made anymore. To that remark I agree, though my attitude towards Reds, Hollywood, Beatty and film making of this stature is completely different than said review.

This is an amazing film. Epic in nature and intimate in quality, it beautifully weaves togather the World War I era in America, Socialist political machinations, so-called Leftist radicals (and their views, anger and work), friendship infused with national urgency and a dynamic love story of distinct personalities coping with their place in history and each other.

Praise was granted Beatty, in the form of an Academy Award, Directors Guild, and Golden Globe for Best Director, but this is a film which ought to be regarded with greater esteem.

Warren Beatty, Diane Keaton, Jack Nicholson and Maureen Stapleton give incredible performances. Beatty, the lead as John Reed, journalist and activist, revolutionary and lover is also quite funny and thoughtful. Keaton, as Reed's love, Louise Bryant is fiesty, angry, empassioned, and sublime as she witnesses and fights for John, searches him out and brings calm to a chaotic life. Nicholson as playwright Eugene O'Neill is awesome. With the beauty of doing so very little, he is scathing, vicious, heart broken and poetic. Nicholson is in command here like never before. Rather than the working class characters he played in The Last Detail, One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest, or The Postman Always Rings Twice, he is an intellectual, a poet and artist, a captain of words and emotion, beset by the pain and horror O'Neill put on stage.

But the performances are one aspect of this film. Vittorio Storaro's (Apocalypse Now, The Last Emperor, The Sheltering Sky)cinematography is stunning, capturing darkened smokey meeting halls and low ceilinged cabins, expansive Russian palaces, the streets of New York City, deserts of the Middle east, and snowy Russian tundras.

As well, this film deals with the touchy, and for the time (1980-1981) very dangerous issue of Communist Russia, Socialism in America, Capitatistic rule, American unionization and the significant struggles therein.

For people to drop a film like this in the bin of Left Wing Propaganda is trite and ignorant. Surely Beatty's politics were in play here, but there is a far deeper and interesting story to be told. While the revolution in 1917 in Russia marked the 20th Century, this tale of a man and woman's becoming, his expression and fight for ideas, the difficult fight for equality or political regard, the challenge of maintaining a private relationship while working for a different world, and the scope of humanity's need to better ourselves by challenging dominant paradigms and establishments, this is an important and successful film.

It hopefully will be available on DVD, and would be wise to include supplementalinformation which surrounds the circumstances and history of this story.",1113782400,10,3064,5.240816326530612

Since then I have spent many years becoming better acquainted with the backdrop against which it is set, having read and studied early 20th century American intellectual life, and familiarized myself with its art, literature and politics.  Last night, after 24 years, I watched Reds again and feel compelled to articulate my opinion.  This is not only a beautiful, moving piece of work, but a well-informed and highly important historical artifact as well.  Warren Beatty is best known as a dashing, handsome actor - he is less known as a scholarly and visionary writer and director; and while Beatty gives a great performance, Reds is truly a testament to the latter.  I challenge anyone with knowledge of the period to dispute the authenticity and attention to detail of the portrayal of WWI-era bohemian Greenwich Village and the issues that preoccupied it.  And from a purely aesthetic perspective, every beautifully balanced scene is a work of art.  One comes away with the impression of having viewed a series of dimly lit paintings from another unimaginably distant era, portraits of the timeless world of young adulthood, that period of heady intensity and newfound freedom when one is certain that all endeavors are possible and that idealism, romance and friendship are the passport to glory.",1106524800,12,1378,5.070796460176991

240188,4,6300214028,"EXCERPTED FROM STEVEN TRAVERS' ""GOD'S COUNTRY""
The 1920s were a strange time. John Reed?s ""Ten Days That Shook the World"" reached a large audience in the United States and internationally. Many wanted to know why an entire planet could be thrust into war. In an attempt to address that issue, some decided that nationalism, governmental agendas, realpolitik, racism, class warfare, capitalism, Democracy, and corporations in bed with politicians and militarists were to blame.
Nationalism was part of it. German unification and Balkan nationalism played a role. Governmental agendas and realpolitik always have played a role in conflict. Since Communism addressed the concept of ""one world government"" and a ""world without borders,"" some concluded that Communism offered the answer to these problems.
Racism was never an original part of the war, but would emerge as an ugly by-product. The Turks unleashed an open can of worms resulting in ""ethnic cleansing"" and genocide pitting Christians against Muslims, Turks against Arabs, secular vs. religious. In Germany, an easy scapegoat began to emerge: The Jews. Lies began to spread that Jewish banking interests profited from the war. In the American South Jewish influence was an affront to their sensibilities. The Ku Klux Klan rose again after a period of dormancy. The KKK?s ""mandate"" pitted them against a ""worldwide Jewish conspiracy"" somehow in league with Papal domination. They said Catholics pledge allegiance not to the U.S., but to the Vatican. But few Catholics and fewer Jews lived in the South. Many blacks did. They were becoming a more prominent segment of society. Blacks were emerging as professional athletes in the Negro baseball leagues, and as musicians in the jazz world. As they asserted themselves, this infuriated the white underclass.
But the most pernicious thing that emerged out of World War I were Westerners who believed that the war had occurred because of the failure of capitalism, Democracy, and corporations who were in bed with politicians and militarists. When Reed?s book came out, a segment of society allowed themselves to believe that the new political system in Russia should be given a chance. Communism became ""the answer"" to society?s many problems, including racism and poverty. The failure of Communism, already evident by 1920, was not exposed to the world. Reed either chose not to write about the thousands and thousands of famine victims, the secret police, the crackdowns and forced marches, the banishments, assassinations and disappearances, or he was controlled by the hierarchy, and not allowed to see it. He probably did not want to see it. He had found his story and he was going to stick to it. The great failure of the free press, of governments and political figures, of humanists and truth-seekers, was the failure to pin Russia - Lenin, Stalin, Trotsky, and the rest of them - down before they became too powerful. To expose them for what they were.

Oscar winning cinematography deserves a good widescreen. Anyone else out there who thinks a DVD is long overdue? UPDATE: The DVD is fine, lots of extras. This sweeping epic grabs me upon each viewing. Diane Keaton has never been better, and Beatty's vision is timeless; as powerful as when I first saw it in '81. My only complaint: I'm sure this was in a big widescreen, but the DVD is only 1.85:1 and Storraro's Oscar winning photography might have shown more. A wonderful film achievement. David Lean's Doctor Zhivago also tells of the Russian Revolution, and it's interesting to see the different styles and perspectives, though REDS is based on fact.",1083888000,7,809,5.044776119402985

240192,1,6300214028,"This movie has an awful lot of chutzpah, but does not go so far as to try to glamorize communism - at least not as it developed in the early Soviet.
But communism was a hideous and genocidal ideology.  And Warren Beatty needed to justify John Reed's (clearly Beatty's alter ego) attachment to it.  So he gave Reed something to hate - namely his parents.
Communism was as much about hatred as it was about ideology.  This movie unintentionally shows that.  The movie treats Reed's parents in a gratuitously ugly manner.  I guess Beatty thinks that if you mock the people you hate - they somehow deserve it.
I'm glad this movie was made, because this imaginary autobiography by Warren Beatty's could have been written by a whole class of people in the baby boom generation.  It does not hide the hatred at its core.  That's a good thing to have as part of the historical record.

240193,5,6300214028,"It's a brilliant movie really; romantic, funny, intelligent and sad, as well as historical.  John Reed was a confused American, or perhaps just an inspired one.  His real battle was for the American working man, an underpaid, over-worked breed of Americana who helped form this nation.  Reed really just believe, if you break it down into bare essence, that men should be treated fairly.  He was labeled a communist, and probably believed himself to be one on some level, but his views were really more socialistic.  This was his basis, and that basis took him to Russia, where he became an unwitting spokesman for the communist regime, his words twisted and translated to meet the Party's needs.  His heart was just with the working man, and a misguided feeling that life should be fair.  His writing speaks for itself--read ""Ten Days that Shook the World"".  Ah, but there's more behind Reed's Russian connection, far more.  He, along with the people who formed his circle of friends, was a bohemian in all respects.  They were people of art, and of talent, intellectual artists in their own right, and far ahead of their time.  The movie touches upon it, and leads one to want to learn more about the man, and his time.  His relationships with Gene O'Neill and Louise Bryant goes far beyond what is portrayed, but the movie does at least give one the insight into those relationships.  In their time, Reed, Bryant, and O'Neill did much in America for American writers, and for American theatre.  They were all people of art, and of deep emotion.  In a time of growing comformity, they tossed comformity aside.  Their lifestyles were not the lifestyles of ""proper people"" of the time, but they gave great emotion to merely living, and to living each day as it came.  Each of them touched this world in some way, left something of themselves behind, and that's what Reds is really all about...what one leaves behind.  John Reed is the only American ever buried in the Kremlin...hardly a matter to be left a faded shade in history.  His belief was strong, and he stood by those beliefs, and that's something that most of us never achieve in the long run of things.
It's a good movie, and worth seeing, and worth remembering.",1062115200,9,2223,4.7272727272727275
240194,5,6300214028,"Warren Beatty pulls off a difficult task in ""Reds."" He's got to juggle several epic stories, including the rise of the American left in the early 20th century, the Russian Revolution, and a personal story of two romantics in a relationship charged by passion both emotional and political.
Any of these story threads presents a difficult task for a filmmaker and Beatty weaves his multilayered tale together with skill. He pays close attention to detail, gives us a multitude of historical characters and events, and mixes his story telling with the words of real people.  Beatty buttresses his scenes with deceptively simple ""talking heads."" These ""witnesses"" provide a real background to the John Reed/Louise Bryant story of ""Reds,"" giving viewers a good grounding in the passions of the era.  The attention to little details (Reed bringing Bryant lilies, the constant phrase ""There's a taxi waiting,"" etc.) provide a rich portrait of two volatile human beings.
Beyond the personal, Beatty knows how to handle epic screen drama. The rousing montage that leads up to the overthrow of Russian government is sumptuous and envigorating.  Don't be deceived thought; this is not a ""pro-Bolshevik"" film by any great stretch of the imagination.  Reed's dissillusionment with the Soviet system is portrayed in agonizing detail.  Emma Goldman's story, a really great history in and of itself, gives another point of view to the difficulty passionate people have when taking on governing authorities and social mores.
The performances are uniformally excellent. Beatty and Keaton are well matched and there's plenty of gems in the supporting roles.  Standouts include Jack Nicholson as Eugene O'Neil, Maureen Stapelton as Emma Goldman, Edward Herrmann as Max Eastman, writer Jerzy Kosinski as Soviet bureaucrat Grigory Zinoviev and Paul Sorvino as Louis Fraina.
I love ""Reds."" It's one of my favorite films.  Be forewarned, however, you could be lost and confused by the myrad of events in this film if you don't know much about political history of the radical left in early 20th Century America or the Bolshevik Revolution and its aftermath.  On the other hand, if you're intrigued by the film you'll find yourself up to your eyeballs at the library reading about the true events and real people who inspired this film.",1048118400,164,2311,5.176943699731903
240195,4,6300214028,"""Reds"" is the 1981 Warren Beatty epic that harnessed the turmoil of the Russian Revolution as reported by American journalist Jack Reed and brought it to the screen in a rivetingly intelligent and thoughtful entertainment piece. As Reed, Beatty brings to the character a political and social passion that is eventually shared with his wife, Louise, played unflinchingly by Diane Keaton. Beatty and Keaton are aptly supported by co-stars Jack Nicholson and Maureen Stapleton (in a Best Supporting Actress Oscar performance). The film is a stunning historic retelling of the political chaos of the socially and economically devastated Russian society and their implementation of the Communist regime that would establish the Soviet Union and last the next 70 years, most of them in Cold War relations with the Western world. Beneath the political drama, ""Reds"" is also the love story, probably glamorized, between Jack and Louise, and Beatty and Keaton are realistic in their roles. The film carries us from the planting of the seeds of Russian discontent to Reed's death from kidney failure, and in between we get an important historic lesson. This is one of Beatty's better and more diligant projects, and it's one that's earned respect and a timelessness for its historical importance.",1039996800,12,1286,5.247572815533981
240196,4,6300214028,"Beatty's historical-biographical epic about John Reed deserves credit for tackling the controversial subject of Communist sympathizers in America during the early part of the 20th century. Reed is sympathetically portrayed as a sincere idealist who sees those ideals betrayed in the aftermath of the Russian revolution, long before the Cold War got started. Subsequently revealed facts may have modified this view of Reed, but the drama is still effective if taken on it's own terms.
Some reviewers felt the romantic subplot was unnecessary or overemphasized, but I think it serves to show Reed as an uncompromising idealist even in his personal life. He questions all social institutions, even marriage, in trying to maintain an open relationship with his main romantic interest. The vicissitudes of their relationship are a tellng illustration of  the difficulties on the personal level they have in adapting to the bold social revisions they are endorsing. The fact that Louise later voluntarily endures personal hardship to find him and care for him indicates a final personal triumph, underscoring the disappointment he has in the turn of larger scale events which ultimately hasten his demise.
Although the real-life Communist drama has ended in a way that Reed, and even Beatty in 1981, certainly didn't imagine, there is still relevance to modern audiences. Current events are foreshadowed in the scene where Reed makes a speech to an Arab crowd that attempts to parallel Eastern and Western class struggles, and they begin chanting for Jihad against America and it's allies. Although Reed complains about translation problems to his Russian sponsors, it is remarkable how little it took to agitate a crowd of Arab men into a violent anti-Western rage, even back then.",1024272000,6,1776,5.297872340425532

Diane Keaton and Warren Beatty have a scene at the end that has to rank as one of the greatest moments in film.  This is not a political film.  It is a devastatingly beautiful love story with the most significant political event of the twentieth century as its backdrop. There are several eloquent and erudite reviews here that get into more detail, but I just wanted to say-- how could this film possibly still not be out on DVD?

I'm trying to collect my all-time favorite films on DVD, and this one is in the fight for the #1 slot with Dr. Zhivago and Lawrence of Arabia. I must have the DVD!!!",1018224000,8,1071,4.241379310344827
240258,1,6300214028,"I wrote a favorable review earlier, but that was before I knew (it was recently found in USSR records) that John Reed recieved over 1million from his pals in the bolsheviks/soviet union in the 1910s and 20s.
It's not the movie's fault, because the makers had no way to know, that Reed was not so much an idealist who did too much dreaming for everyone's good, as a flat out paid communist agent serving his masters for cash and probably not asking too many hard questions to keep that cash coming in.
  Everybody admires an idealist (even one who is wrong), but nobody likes a toadie, and this revelation makes the movie, no matter how well done, mortally flawed and a waste of time.",995414400,33,683,4.5
240259,5,6300214028,"Anyone with some knowledge regarding the Russian Revolution can tell you John Reed's ""Ten Days that Shook the World"", is likely slanted (primarily because of the enormous sum of money the Bolsheviks provided him whilst he was in Russia), and may or may not be historically accurate. But does Reed's facts detract from the quality of this movie? Of course not. First of all, the USSR collapsed almost a dozen years ago, and anything that Trotsky and Lenin would have considered their brand of Socialism died with them, so why do people still nag and moan about how this is ""Liberal Tripe (!?)"". Who knows, and honestly, who could possibly care less. The amount of awards, the cast, and the remarkable location should be enough to garner a high rating. Presently, the amount of money to make a movie this excellent would probably surpass Titanic (to get Jack Nicholson, Warren Beatty, and Diane Keaton in the same film would undoubtedly top $100 million alone), so Reds is clearly one-of-a-kind. Where else will a person see a true-to-life reproduction of the Russian Revolution.
Firstly, there is the hope and enthusiasm which surrounded the original Revolution of March 1917, then, there is the initial enthusiasm for the Bolshevik Revolution, and the subsequent disappointment (because of their repression of dissent, and elimination of opposition parties). In addition, the obvious difference in methods and opinions between the Socialists within the US, and the more radical Socialists epitomized by John Reed, is quite stupendous (especially in this day and age, when the US propaganda machine has successfully associated all forms of Socialism to the Stalinist Bureaucracy). Perhaps the only gripe I have with this film is the disimilarity between the actors and the genuine historical figures. Warren Beatty looks absolutely nothing like John Reed, the actor who played Lenin looked absolutely nothing like the genuine Lenin, and the actor who played Zinoviev was ridiculous (last I checked, Zinoviev was a heavy breathing 220-pounder, not some svelte weakling!). Perhaps the only likeness was the actor who played Karl Radek (of course, finding a person who looks as deceitful as Radek isn't remarkably difficult!). Since the DVD apparently will not be released for quite some time, I would definitely recommend this terrific VHS, which in all probability is one of the ten greatest movies ever.",980121600,10,2402,5.193298969072165
240260,5,6300214028,"For those of us who appreciate movies that both entertain and educate, Warren Beatty's vastly underrated magnum opus ""Reds"" is a wonderful example of how well the two can be combined. Although it did not succeed at the box office, this magnificent spectacle concerning the involvement of an American socialist reporter in the Bolshevik revolution is a terrific movie, and also features Warren Beatty in the pivotal role of John Reed, an American journalist covering Soviet affairs for a progressive American socialist journal called ""The Masses"" who found his way into a series of important roles in the Soviet revolution and the regime that followed. Also found here is a especially memorable performance by Diane Keaton as the companion, love interest and protg of Reed's who also served in a variety of roles in the new communist regime shortly after the revolution.
This movie is largely based on Reed's moving autobiographical portrait of his personal experiences during the October revolution in his best selling book ""Ten Days That Shook The World"". The movie opens by exploring Reed's relationship with Keaton's early feminist character, and chronicles their growth and evolution toward a socialist perspective and an eventual commitment to political journalism that took them to the streets of Moscow in the days just preceding the October revolution.  Also prominently featured in the movie is Jack Nicholson as Reed's intellectual friend, novelist and playwright Eugene O'Neil. This is a quite entertaining, sophisticated, and historically accurate effort to show America's own flirtation with unionism, socialism and communism and the reaction of more conservative forces within the business and civic community. The exploration of lifestyles and constant questioning of tradition and conformity make this a terrific teaching tool by showing how critically we can look at the lessons of history. Enjoy!",973382400,155,1914,5.444444444444445
240261,5,6300214028,"Created at the dawn of the Reagan era, it took a lot of guts on Warren Beatty's part to put out this rather favorable view of American socialist-turned-communist John Reed.
But while the viewer will learn of some of the more unsavory aspects of life in the land of the free (such as Woodrow Wilson's Palmer raids in suppression of free speech, and the real reason our pompous messianic leader led us into the First World War), the film is not a hymn of praise to Communism.  It is instead a portrait of lives lived to the full -- maybe not, to be sure, the way we would choose to live our lives; but it certainly depicts lives lived beyond the category of drones in what is supposed to pass for democracy in America.
As Reed, Beatty infuses his character with an energy and dynamism that probably exceed the original template.  And to the character of the ""Queen of Bohemia,"" Louise Bryant, Diane Keaton brings a luminous beauty that grows along with her character.  Jack Nicholson is wonderful as the jaded Eugene O'Neill, and a host of other actors make this film one of the most richly cast films of the era.
Communism is dead now, and as for socialism, any glance at a public restroom will demonstrate the regard that people have for property not their own.  Part of the appeal of this film, as with the ideologies it depicts, lies in the romantic myth spawned by Rousseau that, once liberated of the shackles of civilization, humanity will be reborn and therefore truly free.  As to whether that same humanity will be happy is quite another question, and one which the film implicitly answers in the negative.  For those interested in where the most noble parts of these ideas may lead a truly honest person, I suggest that you purchase a film called ""Entertaining Angels.""  It is about a woman who knew some of the people depicted in ""Reds"" and shared many of their ideas to her dying day, Dorothy Day, the co-founder of the Catholic Worker movement.  She may one day become a canonized saint.  She is already an inspiration to many, and her ideas are far from the dustbin of history.",972345600,20,2090,4.566844919786096
240262,5,6300214028,"""Reds"" is one of my all-time favorite epic films!  This unusual biographical movie recounts the love affair between two Americans who became deeply involved in the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution in Russia. John Reed was a brilliant reporter and an American Communist who not only witnessed and reported the events of the Bolshevik Revolution in late 1917, but became an active participant in them. (Reed, considered a hero to the Bolshevik cause, is the only American to have been buried with honors in the Kremlin during the Communist era of the Soviet Union. Reed authored a memoir of the Bolshevik uprising entitled ""Ten Days That Shook the World."") Louise Bryant was Reed's great love who eventually became his wife.  Bryant, an extremely talented writer in her own right, was also an ardent Communist who participated in the Bolshevik Revolution.

Brilliant performances are turned in by Warren Beatty as Reed (Beatty also directed the film, winning the Academy Award for Best Director for his work); Diane Keaton as Bryant, and Jack Nicholson as the Socialist playwright George Bernard Shaw. The film's cinematography is superb, and the screenplay is well paced and finely honed.

""Reds"" is a fascinating and chillingly realistic look at the Bolshevik revolution, one of the twentieth century's most turbulent and frightening times.  It's also a great love story.  ""Reds"" is definitely a film not to be missed!",970444800,12,1411,5.166666666666667
240263,5,6300214028,"The film Reds is a wonderful portrayal of life both in America and in Russia during World War  1 and the Russian Revolution.  I love this movie because it forces you to look beyond what you can see with your eyes, and  focus on what the director is trying to symbolize.

240265,5,6300214028,"Some films have a reputation for being overpraised, and as a result - paradoxically -  they become underrated.  This is one such film.  Who cares that we now know communism failed in Russia?  REDS is not meant to be  a piece of Soviet apologism.  It is about two people who take part in  exciting and sweeping historical events.  I certainly disagree with the  politics of John Reed and Louise Bryant, but it doesn't matter. I envy the  romanticism of the times they lived in (even if the romanticism isn't  authentic), and that they were able to find, as one of the  ""witnesses"" says at the end of the movie, ""things worth  living and worth dying for.""  The second half of the movie - where we  see the price that must be paid for taking part in history - provides good  dramatic balance to the more sentimental view of revolutionary politics we  see in the first half. The cinematography is outstanding and the love theme  by Stephen Sondheim is exquisite.  As it is a  film that should be seen on  the big screen, I'm hoping that REDS will be re-released for its 20th  anniversary in 2001.",939600000,62,1092,4.492307692307692

Instead, you're viewing a tediously long movie about two people, John Reed and Louise Bryant, with the Bolshevik Revolution as sort of a  backdrop or secondary story. Bait and switch.
John Reed was not an insignificant person in history, but the sweep of the era deserves a better film describing what went on then a love story and babble about socialism.

7805660,3,6300214028,"RELEASED IN 1981 and written & directed by Warren Beatty, Reds stars Beatty as real-life radical American journalist and socialist, John Jack Reed, who becomes involved with the Russian revolution, and hopes to bring its spirit and idealism to America. In the meantime he romances progressive writer Louise Bryant (Diane Keaton), who also goes to Russia. Jack Nicholson plays the wrench in their romantic wheels, Eugene O'Neill. Maureen Stapleton & Gene Hackman are also on hand.

Throughout the movie there are interjections from aged people who actually knew John Reed, Louise Bryant and Eugene ONeill. I found this an interesting touch.

The first hour and twenty minutes take place in the states during WWI, starting in Portland, Oregon, and then switching to the East Coast when the couple decides to move there (New York City & Provincetown, Massachusetts). Only then do events start to perk-up when they head to France and then Russia. Until that point theres a lot of relationship shenanigans between the three (Jack, Louise & Gene) and endless talk about communism, socialist ideals and workers rights.

The tone of the drama is akin to a Robert Altman film; you can tell Beatty learned a thing or two from him with McCabe & Mrs. Miller (1971). The movies certainly ambitious and well-acted. Those with interest in the period will find much to like here. Unfortunately, its not all that compelling and it lacks the epic stature, nigh-surrealism and jaw-dropping cinematography of Dr. Zhivago (1965). Reeds a misguided character because his communistic ideals proved to be a nightmare for the Russian people. To the films credit, this is effectively shown in the last act in a potent discussion between Reed and Emma (Stapleton) yet, even then, Reed didn't get it, which is typically the case with boneheaded libertines who insist on forcing their fatally flawed ideology on the rest of the populace.

While communism sounds good on paper, it just doesn't work in practice. It's a demotivating system that ensures that everyone's equally poor, except of course for the ruling state class, which essentially becomes communistic royalty. To all intents and purposes they are the reviled ""bourgeoisie"" and the common people are the ""proletariat,"" both of which communism sought to eliminate in the first place, which makes communism hypocritical. Furthermore, communism leads to all kinds of suffering and corruption, like waiting in long lines or bribing doctors and sellers for services & merchandise, not to mention how the state itself becomes god and thus demands the worship of the people. Sure, capitalism has its downside, but it's an all-around superior system, which is why people from communistic states flee to capitalistic countries and not vice versa.

The temperamental and non-traditional Louise Bryant has her points of interest, but ultimately she isn't a sympathetic character (for one thing, shes duplicitous). Not for a second do I believe that she bluntly said to Reed in the yard outside a lecture hall: Jack, I want to see you with your pants down (rolling my eyes).

THE MOVIE RUNS 195 minutes (3 hours, 15 minutes) and was shot in England, Finland, New York City, California, Spain and Sweden. ADDITIONAL WRITER: Trevor Griffiths.
