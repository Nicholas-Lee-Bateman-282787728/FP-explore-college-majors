5819368,5,B00DJ5IPBE,""" ...Cinematic Stylings of..Tarantino"" is advisory and not to be taken as anything more than an explanation of the directorial style. The quality of the artwork,both in background and charactor design is superb  and brilliant in all respects. Colors are bright,details are exact and the music is appropriate.
Hana (Hatchin) is the star although she is only 9 years old on the day escaped convict Michiko crashes through the window on her motorbike and takes her on a long journey in search for Hana's father.
If you are PC blinded,pass this by as this is not anything close to being PC. It is raw,real and violent and completly without humor or joy. Life is cheap,murder and vulgarity common and often involving children.
Although there is a raw women's prison scene and Michiko is a drunk and a slut,there is zero nudity and fan service; when the stripper at a bar completes her pole dance and remains fully clothed,you get your first hint there is no nudity or fanserv.
Hana(Hatchin) retains her inter-quality throughout as she navigates her way through the violence and destruction all around her and captures the hearts of many. Michiko,although she bends a little near the end and does ""grow"" a little, substantially remains the self-centered slut, almost without any redeaming qualities short of good looking.
The ending may really piss you off but,when you think of it,there was no other possible ending.
Well worth a view,just don't waste your time looking for anything naked as it isn't there.",1382313600,2,1502,4.9603174603174605
5819369,4,B00DJ5IPBE,"Quality of the Blu-ray is great, haven't come across any bugs or glitches. Gives you the option of watching it in either Japanese or English with or without subtitles. So for those people who are totally against dubbed anime you can watch it the way you want. I usually prefer dubbed anime but if the subbed anime voice acting is more suitable than I have no problem watching that.

The only dislike I have about this is some of the English voice acting, which is just an opinion. I really dislike Michiko's English voice, its not the type of voice I imagined she'd have in English and it just doesn't suit her ""in my opinion"". I wish she had more of a sexy/bold attitude type of voice as for Hatchin her voice is fine, I also wish they got a little more creative with the overall voice acting like adding Spanish/Portuguese accents and more.

As for the debate on Michiko's race (not ethnicity), no one is 100% positive what her race is. Brazil is a very diverse place with many races. So does it matter? Absolutely not because the story doesn't focus on it at all. This has a very compelling story line and reminds me a lot of the movie ""City of God"" which I am positive is something that influenced this show. So get in a comfortable spot, get some snacks and enjoy the show!",1380844800,,1278,4.3881856540084385
5819370,5,B00DJ5IPBE,"It's been a long time since I've been this excited over an anime. M&H has all the reckless feel of ""Samurai Champloo"", with the intense, character-driven storytelling style of ""Cowboy Beebop"". Doesn't hurt that the artwork, characters AND backgrounds, are superb.
Parts 1 & 2 make for a continuous narrative of vingettes, so you'll want to watch all four discs to get the complete story.",1379894400,8,387,4.969230769230769
5819371,5,B00DJ5IPBE,"Michiko to Hatchin is about a Afro-Latina woman named Michiko who escapes prison to search for both her lover and his daughter, Hana, and together they embark on an adventure of mischief, broken bonds, and love.

I loved Michiko to Hatchin when it first came out in 2008 and was anxiously awaiting for it to be picked up and over 3 years later it finally has! Now, let me start off by saying that this Anime is both a hidden gem and a rusted pearl.

It's made by the same people who created Cowboy Bebop! It's known for its charm, ethnic characters, and violence.
FUNimation picked it up, and though I'm grateful since they have a habit of creating beautiful box sets and awesome releases...I got a bone to pick. Rant begin/ While the sub is great, in the dub I'm disappointed with Michiko's voice. They did give some of the other Ethnic character's African American voice actors and that did them justice but I have to admit the flaw I found in FUNimation's dubbing was that they recycled some of their voice actors. I do not find Monica Rial a suitable voice actor as she sounded neither African American nor Hispanic. Michiko is a bad to the bone, Mixed gal, ok? She sounds raunchy and sexy in the subbed version but she ended up sounding like a Country girl in the dub. Rant over/
If you can get over that then no worries.

I love this anime because it's so rare to see ethnic characters! You will meet many beautiful, unique characters from Michiko to Pepe Lima to Atsuko and more! There's also a huge debate about the origins of the characters since it's so rare to see anyone of color but Michiko is clearly a Afro-Latina woman. I give it a 5 for being unique and enjoyable but I have to admit there wasn't a lot of character development and even at some point you find yourself wanting to bang your head against the wall with Michiko constantly trying to pursue a man that doesnt want to be involved with her anymore.

Bottom Line? Go buy it! It has two parts, so you'll need to buy part 1 and 2 (22 Episodes total) to complete the series but it's worth the money and you'll own a anime with rare characters and a interesting storyline!",1379721600,25,2144,4.406565656565657

5819373,4,B00DJ5IPBE,"Loved the feel and atmosphere of this Anime, reminded me somewhat  of Cowboy Bebop. My main  attraction to this series was the use of an African American/character of African descent, in addition to the fact that the artist actually drew them well and attractive looking, not like in the past anime's of the late 80's mid 90's where they over did certain features or skin tone due to possible lack of exposure to blacks or Afro-Latin's by Asian artist. The story line isn't the best to date along with the typical humorous hyperactive behavior, but the production value is so captivating,that it holds my attention. It's no ""Ghost in the Shell"" or ""Akira"" which is probably what they weren't aiming for in terms of production or target audience anyways, but it is worth having in my collection for me personally due too,..it's the first anime I've seen centered around a black character, and my exposure/interest in anime dates back to the late 70's-80's so I can say with some confidence that this may well be one of the few original anime's of its kind with the exception of Afro Samurai.",1392595200,,1090,4.731578947368421

""City Of God"" and ""Kill Bill"" and you got one mother of a series.  The Latin flavor to the colors and the

5819376,5,B00DJ5IPBE,"This is an excellent anime series. If you are a Cowboy Bebop fan, this is a must get.

First the item review: The case is well done and the Blu-ray quality is superb. The actual video is 1080p native with good color and contrast. The dub in English is really amazing, you can feel the emotions from the dialogs (it is not a plane dub without emotion just reading text).

Second the anime: The story is around Michiko, an inmate in a prison in Rio (well that's what I think, I don't really remember) who took part on gang wars searching for Hatching, the daughter of boyfriend she had. Once the search of Hatching is over, they embark in a quest for searching Hatchins father. My description may sound pretty lame but do not be fooled, this series touches mature content, gun fight and social problematic that makes you to not leave your tv seat. The soundtrack is impressive and it immerses you in the favelas.

As a fan of this series, my advice is: If you do not have it, what are you waiting for, do it. It is worth the money.",1388620800,,1029,4.321243523316062

8593717,5,B00DJ5IPBE,"Michiko and Hatchin is a series that drew my attention due to it's origin, and that origin is filmmaker Shinichir Watanabe. He also directed Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, and Space Dandy, and in my opinion, those are some of the best! You won't be disappointed in this series if you are a fan of his previous work. This series follows an escaped convict and an abused girl, and their path towards a common shared person. More of a slice of life type of genre. The art and animation is second to none, so detailed and believable, and so fluid in it's movement. If you liked Cowboy Bebop or any of the aforementioned, you will love this! (although not as action packed as the others)",1441065600,,683,4.516129032258065
8593718,3,B00DJ5IPBE,"Let me preface this review by stating the same thing many others have stated: I am a fan of Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo. So my particular point of view might be biased based on what I was expecting over what I actually got.

Michiko E Hatchin from the start, is an obvious throw back to the old style of anime that many of us became accustomed to from titles such as Trigun and Cowboy Bebop. However it is more like a nod as if to pay homage to these series, and that is really where the similarities stop. This isn't Cowboy Bebeop. This isn't Trigun. This is Samurai Champloo. There are a lot of similarly styled action sequences that could almost be considered a ""brand"" if you will, that was apparent in both Bebop and Champloo.

So why all the comparisons to Bebop and Champloo? The same team of writers and animation studios developed this series. There aren't long drawn out fight sequences like ones you'll find in Shonen series (like Bleach as an example). Despite major differences in past titles, it still has a more ""realistic"" approach towards the action, which I personally like.

The graphics are superb. The theoretical ""Mexico-esque"" landscape was both exciting and beautiful. No complaints there at all. The art style is enough to at least warrant watching this series if it ever does make it to Netflix.

The audio is also extremely well done. The audio soundtrack is reminiscent of Bebop with some jazzy elements to it. It isn't nearly as good, but it is still considerably better than most anime series out there. The music fits the scenery, and the sounds effects are well placed an aren't cheesy. All in all, it has quality audio all around. If fits the theme well.

The plot is where the show begins to start to lose its originality. As not to spoil anything, it is a show about a reunited mother and daughter. The mother is on the run after breaking out in prison; the daughter was previously taken care of by a foster family. Their reunion is what serves to spark most of the plot developments because the daughter is more responsible and mature than her criminal mother who acts immaturely, irresponsibly, and downright slutty at times. One main theme throughout the show is Hatchin trying to figure out if she would be better off alone, or with her crazy mother. Hatchin (the daughter) struggles to find herself and come to grips with who her family is while dealing with the constant stress of being on the road running from the law (and when I say that it is a subtle part of the plot and is really just more of an underlying theme). There aren't a whole lot of chase scenes where the cops are hot on their trail. The plot is gritty as you might expect, but it often feels forced at times when it doesn't need to. Sure being a criminal means you will be involved in a lot of shady situations, but they take it to an unbelievable extreme. There is a lot of profanity, but most of it at least feels well placed and helps to maintain the mood of the series. I don't dislike profanity in a series personally, but I am a stickler for realism as it is used. There is nothing worse to me than having a series that attempts to be edgy by having lots of misplaced profanity just for the point of appealing to high school kids -Michiko E Hatchin is not one of these series, and if anything it helps to support the main character's personality. I don't feel it was absolutely necessary, but at the same time it doesn't sound forced or out of place. The plot is certainly nothing new, rather a reliable fall-back that is becoming overplayed. Sadly, it makes the show entirely too predictable (which may be a positive depending on your point of view).

Where the show really lacks is character design. Most of the non major characters lack any kind of depth. It keeps the show at a lighter-hearted tone at the expense of making a potential mockery of itself. Supporting characters are easily forgettable, very cliche based, and predictable. The graphical design most characters is acceptable, but certain nothing unique. The main character Michiko is perhaps one of the most annoying characters I've ever seen. This might be a deal breaker for some. It almost was for myself. Michiko's attitude and even her actions are not the problem. In fact, the actual character design for Michiko is pretty good. The American voice actor is a deplorable casting job however. She sounds like a mix between a latino, an angry black chick, and a considerate soft spoken mother all at the same time. Her accent changes frequently and without reason. This hodge-podge of different ethnic portrayals is borderline offensive, and poor acting at best. Michiko is a criminal afterall, but she is a cliche criminal that makes a mockery of the character at times. Beyond her, there are other similar examples that are not main characters in the show that are just as poorly cast and equally offensive. In general, Michiko E Hatchin's biggest let down is the American voice cast. It was bad enough to turn this otherwise 4-5 star show to a 3 at best. I could have overlooked some of the flaws in the character design if the main role was a little better, but it isn't. Hatchin, the other main character is well cast and is a believable character, I just wish they had used the same level of scrutiny for all the cast.

All in all, this is probably not one to add to your general collection. It serves as an important title in a rather niche sub-genre instead. It is nothing new or exceptional, but the show does have its share of individual charms and is definitely worth watching or purchasing if you can find it at a good price. I personally bought the entire collection on Blu-Ray for $20 brand new. I would definitely say it is worth that much to own, but anything past that I would wait to catch it on Crunchyroll or Netflix if it is released later.",1437523200,2,5853,4.5632730732635585

8593725,4,B00DJ5IPBE,"""From the other side of the road, someone will come to get me"" - One of the initial lines of dialogue spoken by title character Hanna, also later on known as Hatchin, sometime in the middle of the first episode. She's contemplating running away, even though she knows it's a certain death.

In the very next scene, a dark somber mood hangs over our Hanna as she's forced to slave yet another day under grotesque and abusive foster parents. Suddenly, while at the dinner table, a raging green bike [Pictured on the cover of this Blu-Ray boxed set] slams through the window and lands right on top of the dinner table's occupants. A tan-skinned sex diva, clad in tight and seductive clothing, slams her foot on the table, bringing fear to the startled family's eyes. She takes a moment to lower her bulky sunglasses, and then analyzes every terrified occupant's face with piercing eyes; scanning each and every person- she looks for features that resemble a picture of a little baby girl she knows as Hannah. Her eyes settle on a timid girl with bushy white hair.

""Come on Hannah"" She says softly, and reaches out her hand. Hannah, looking at the hand, hesitates a moment. She feels scared. She doesn't even know who this person is. She fears her, and yet...admires her transient beauty and daring composure. Reaching out, she takes this stranger's hand. In a sudden and haphazard motion, this woman (whose name we later learn is Michiko) jerks Hatchin onto her bike. Gunshots start ringing out from police outside as well as, surprisingly, a money-hungry priest wielding a shotgun. Just as she had come in, this woman jerks her motorbike around in a 360 degree motion and explodes out into the world.

By taking this woman's hand, whose name Hatchin quickly learns is Michiko, she begins a personal and physical odyssey that will see them connect in ways unseen before in any anime. For those that want to witness the rest of their journey. This is it.

----------

Let's make something clear: this show is not for everyone, and that is this show's biggest problem because it advertises itself as a very accessible show complete with action, gunslinging hot babes, and underworld criminal activity.

I'm not a fan of highlighting a show's negative points first, but I want to make myself clear again. This show's biggest problem is that it advertises itself as a fun, action oriented Black Lagoon-type anime, even featuring a primary character that bares striking resemblance to Revy. However, this is simply not the case. It's...deeper then that. The true reality is that only those willing to undertake a slow and episodic story which focuses on its characters' inner conflicts, rather than external ones, will be the viewers who truly enjoy this anime the most. This fact is a shame considering the show's best characteristics lie within its presentation: graphics, animation, choreography, music. Very similar to most other high-caliber action series. Even so, let me be clear once more in saying that the interaction and story between the primary two characters takes massive precedent over everything else in this TV series. (That's three times I've stated that idea now.)

If the premise of this show doesn't click with you, you aren't going to like this series. Period. End of story. The product description gives the simple gist that this is an adventure show featuring a sex deva and an awkward young girl bound together in their struggle to locate a man important to both of their pasts. Take that gist at face value. If that storyline doesn't sound appealing than you should probably avoid this series, and will especially regret purchasing this expensive boxed set later on. Personally, having already witnessed masterpieces such as Cowboy Bebop and Black Lagoon, I thought this show seemed somewhat outclassed. Close. So very close. Equal in everything else except story, but no cigar. By itself the show could by all means can be considered great. I can hardly argue with people that think so...If you are one of those people by all means consider this series five stars. More power to ya, I say. I myself remain firm.

The bottom line is that this show's story can appeal to you or it can not. For me, it just didn't click. To me this show's story just seemed like an inferior version of the anime Samurai Champloo, which featured a near identical overarching storyline and similar-type characters. (Also made courtesy of studio Manglobe and director Shinichir' Watanabe) In both shows we see our primary characters scouring a country looking for a mysterious character relevant to all of their pasts. In Champloo it was the enigmatic Sunflower Samurai. In this show it ended up being what appeared to a random guy named Hiroshi Morenos. For the life of me, I couldn't figure out why this man could be so significant to the main characters. Some may feel that what I'm about to say is (or saying) something of a spoiler, but I honestly do not feel this way. I'd argue it's important to state the facts about what the show is about so potential fans/customers know what it is about. Here's how I interpreted it. To me, this show felt constrained in that the story was about the relationship between Michiko and [I think?] her daughter Hatchin in what was almost like a slice-of-life show, but was overall trapped within the setting and presentation of a high-caliber action anime. If you are anything like myself, or otherwise follow the message I am trying to portray: you will understand that when I say that the overarching storyline ended up being completely mediocre and flat in it's conclusion, you will know I'm saying that to protect you from wasting your time, money, and most of all expectation (Which is worth more than money) that they are getting something different. In Champloo it culminated in an explosive and heart-pounding finale that elevated what had previously been a mostly episodic and strictly B story to near-Cowboy Bebop level (legendary) status.

This show? Not so much. The finale of Mitchiko to Hatchin isn't nearly as decisive as either Champloo or Bebop. There's action, sure. But the action in the final episodes of this series is no different or more suspenseful than anything the viewer sees throughout the previous to the final episodes. In fact, I'd argue the best action scenes featuring Mitchiko were actually in the beginning of the entire series (in the first few episodes) rather than the end. Besides that, I'd argue the best action scene of the last episodes of the series didn't even feature Mitchiko, but a side character...Who but one episode after [Slight spoilers] an amazing last stand goes on to be killed off and forgotten in the extended storyline, regardless. [/End Spoilers**] I don't know. To me, that seemed something of a waste. As for the title character Mitchiko, once she ""rescues"" Hatchin after her initial escape from a prison in the first couple episodes she holds on to a moral compass for the sake of Hatchin. Again, understandable for sure, but still nonetheless disappointing when compared to other action shows' main characters such as Revy from Black Lagoon, Spike from Cowboy Bebop, and/or Mugen from Samurai Champloo. Some would say that this fact makes this show distinctive, which is a perfectly fine opinion, but I feel compelled to state that I was disappointed.

If you want a summary than this is it: as an action-oriented fan that came expecting something that presented itself so different; it felt like that I had been shot through the heart when those expectations didn't follow through. I remembering feeling almost ripped off but not quite. Instead I felt...somber. I'm enough of an anime veteran and have seen enough series to no longer get so upset at situations such as these, especially considering that (unlike many other anime series these days) there is a definitive conclusion..But I can't say for sure how I really feel about it. I can say this, though. I didn't love it. I can also very easily see such a disappointment devastating another newer or unsuspecting fan. Do not be mistaken, there are small moments of glory scattered throughout the series, particularly in the episode I listed below, but it is not nearly enough so that one seeking Hellsing Ultimate/Black Lagoon level action leaves satisfied.

[*SPOILERS- LOOK AWAY!**] For those veteran fans that are wondering, I'm referring to the final standoff between Satoshi Batista and Shinsuke Saci Rodriguez in Episode 20: Rendezvous of Extermination [/End Spoilers]

The show gives many hints in the forms of flashbacks and lines of dialogue throughout the series as to just who the ""mysterious"" main character is. Lines of dialogue are dropped, some flashbacks are thrown in that do add some substance to him. However this character, named Hiroshi Morenos, to me felt very unsatisfying. As a writer and longtime connesiuer of written fiction I could have easily thrown in a couple plot devices that would have made this character much more interesting, but as it stands it is in vain. This show did very much feel like a spiritual successor of sorts to Champloo, but the show's story just didn't seem quite ambitious enough to escape Champloo's shadow. If you've already seen Samurai Champloo in particular, you are proabably going to be somewhat disappointed with this show. Based off story alone, I would have given this show a measly three stars. The conclusion and supposed climax, unlike Samurai Champloo which was explosive and its best part, turned out to be very anti-climatical except for a single sub-plot that involved Hiroshi Morenos' old criminal associates. [Which actually did end up being very reminiscent of Gungrave or Black Lagoon.] If only these subplots had been expanded...Alas, the lost potential.

Yes, therein lies a sort of contradiction this show fails to address. This show has got some /serious talent behind it. I mean really, Manglobe did a bloody fantastic job in the technical department; this is easily one of the best anime I've ever seen visually. Very rarely do I change a rating of a show based off its animation, choreography, or music. This show features all three exceptionally. For that reason and that reason alone, I felt compelled to add a star. Words can not overstate just how great many of those recently-stated characteristics are. The environments are drawn beautifully, the animation is so smooth, and it was an absolute pleasure to behold on my 42'' LG 1080P TV played through my PS3 and my 5.1 surround sound. In fact, for that reason alone I could see myself putting this show back on again. Speaking strictly about the show, it really was truly enchanting at times, but oh so underwhelming in others. It leaves one feeling a striking sense of lost potential which will leave you playing the ""What-If"" game in your mind for days after. I do not regret watching this show, nor do I regret buying it...but I do regret holding high expectations for it. Perhaps the biggest shocker was at how the trailer does not live up to the story. At least after the first couple episodes. Shame on me for believing a trailer and editorials, I guess.

Anyways, getting off such a somber rant. Let's talk about the audio for a moment; the sound of this story is backed by the famous Shinichir' Watanabe, who primarily served as a this series' music producer. It's freaking fantastic. This is rare for me, but numerous times I felt myself stopping and just...listening. To the opening song or end credits. The setting of this story is mostly contained to unnamed Latin American countrysides and cities, and the audio reflects that. I suspect it is meant to be in Mexico, because it (**Slight spoiler!**) references different characters ""crossing the border"" (**/End Spoiler**) a couple times throughout the anime, but it could just as well be set within Brazil or any other South American country. The precise location and whether the country/setting is fictional or not is never made clear. Personally, I thought this was a good thing. By keeping the setting primarily fictional it helps keep most viewers [including myself] more detached from reality and better helps each viewer submerse themselves into the plot of the show. Seeing as this show's story as a whole, which just barley hung in the balance in keeping my attention, attachable. This may have well been one of those ""small"" factors that allowed me to rate this series as highly as I did. Change one of these small factors and I might have given up on this series. (Let's just say it walked a thin line.) For other viewers it might be under the bar, those viewers will give up on this series and/or view it negatively; while other viewers still will see it set way above the bar, and hold it amongst the best anime ever made. Once again, for me it was right on that thin line- but in keep mind I'm one who tends to appreciate smaller details. For this reason I go back and forth.

I could probably go on and on rambling about this series, but let's leave it with a little game. Read the following quote.

""Rest is not idleness, and to lie sometimes on the grass under trees on a summer's day, listening to the murmur of the water, or watching the clouds float across the sky, is by no means a waste of time.""

' John Lubbock, The Use Of Life

Read that quote again. (Slowly this time.) Try to take in its deeper meaning. If you find yourself connecting with the quote and pondering it's inner meaning, chances are you are likely just the kind of person that will enjoy this series. If such is the case: waste not a second more. Order this series immediately. If instead you skimmed the quote, thought about it merely a moment, and skipped to this paragraph: go ahead and skip pass this anime. Instead, I would refer you to go watch a show called ""Lupin the Third: A Woman Called Fujiko Mine."" or ""Samurai Champloo""- if you haven't already seen them.

Thank you for reading this review. It's my first one in a while. I rate this series a rock solid 4 stars, or a score of 8 out of 10. Good luck to you, fellow fans, and always remember Funimation's motto. ""You should be watching"".

Remember there's always something out there for everyone.
