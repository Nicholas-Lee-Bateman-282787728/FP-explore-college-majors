8245019,2,B0012BW58G,"Sucks. poorly organized. do not buy.
 the teaching set whizzes by too fast, without a clearly delineated onscreen name for each movement.
no clear sequencing of movements onscreen, in comparison to other videos where there is a clear onscreen title and each movement is clearly separated.
 he doesn't even say how many movements there are.
breathing is hardly mentioned

he knows the movements, but not how to do a video. i have about 40 qigong videos, this is among the worst as a learning tool. if i hadn't gotten it really cheap i would be returning it.",1420675200,2,556,4.711340206185567
