8726724,5,B012YOU8PQ,"This concert features the farewell concert of the 78 year old conductor, still very sprightly, as he retires after leading the orchestra for 20 years with great distinction and no mean renown. Joining him is solo violinist Julia Fischer who has performed in this role with David Zinman on many occasions over the last 10 years.

The official concert programme starts and ends with works which have been part of these players enormously successful integral sets of Richard Strauss and Beethoven. In between is the Dvorak violin concerto with whom these players had previously made a much admired recording coupled with Bruch. This therefore is more than just a farewell concert  it is also a celebration of a partnership that has enjoyed critical acclaim over many years and whose recordings of these exact works will be in many of the audiences library collections of CD discs.

So how does this concert match up to the previous recordings? The answer is  even better in so far as there is a palpable sense of a joyous occasion, one of real celebration but not tinged with regret at Zinmans imminent retirement from the podium. The freshness and clarity of vision so apparent on all their recordings is enhanced here by the spontaneity of a live event at one of the worlds greatest concert series.

The camera team catch numerous glances and expressions of joy with frequent smiles of pleasure either shared or intimate. The 2014 BBC sound recording is a text book example of natural balance set within a believable audio space. The highly enthusiastic audience is impeccably well behaved throughout the music making. Sound is presented in DTS-HD MA 5.1 and stereo.

Julia Fischer is on good form and the concerto has a greater sense of the dance in the final movement and more relaxation within the first two movements when compared to her recording. Her technical perfection remains but seems less of a main focus on this occasion and she even allows herself to smile from time to time  always an encouraging sign of personal pleasure.

Her encore, the finale movement from Hindemiths sonata for solo violin, inhabits a very different world to that of Dvorak. Members of the orchestras string section especially showed admiration and respect for this clearly virtuoso playing and the Prom audience responded to the fireworks aspect with their usual enthusiasm. Listeners at home may respond differently in terms of repeat playing, skipping swiftly on to the Beethoven!

The final piece, a clever, witty and hugely enjoyable encore of traditional inspiration arranged by Florian Walser, was an inspired choice with which to round off this very celebratory occasion. That is a piece that most certainly will give much pleasure upon repeat viewing.

This disc could easily be a particular favourite for collectors for its remarkable sense of musical celebration and joy.",1477526400,5,2869,5.033755274261603
