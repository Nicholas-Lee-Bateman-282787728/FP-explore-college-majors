8186319,5,B000FEB91K,"I have to say that I didn't quite realize how many films I'd be getting when I ordered this bundle pack. There are many different films on each disk - some better than others, I have to say. Overall, though, this is a great deal. While all of the films are older, there is a lot of information here and some very strong footage. I liked the films involving San Franciso the best, but that is mostly a matter of personal taste. The shots of Los Angeles are also very strong and I liked the historical perspective.",1147910400,,512,4.288659793814433
