8623918,5,B00GJT2N10,"I love this movie! I cannot give it high enough praise...the acting, the directing, the screenplay....just wonderful! I didn't even like this story until I saw this movie. Mandy Patinkin was amazing as Quasimodo and even if you don't like this story, it is worth watching just for his performance! I was deeply moved by his acting as the poor hunchback...he really sold it.
Oh and the other actors! Salma Hayeck was perfect for Esmeralda and gave a very believable performance as the beautiful gypsy doomed to be an archdeacon's obsession. Richard Harris was also amazing as Archdeacon Claude Frollo. I have only ever seen him as a good guy but as Frollo he was truly intimidating and a little scary. Bravo!
So if you haven't seen this movie, you should. It was a well directed, well acted film!",1463875200,,795,4.726618705035971

8623922,5,B00GJT2N10,"I REALLY LIKED THIS STORY (MADE FOR TV - 1997) VS. THE ORIGINAL, THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME AS IT WAS TOLD  WITH EXCELLENT ACTING FROM ""MANDY PATINKIN"" AS ""QUASIMOTO"" AND THE LATE AND GREAT ""RICHARD HARRIS"" AS ""DOM CLAUDE FROLLO"". I NEVER THOUGHT ""GINA LOLLOBRIGIDA"" AS THE DANCING FREE SPIRITED ""ESMERALDA"" (IN THE 1957 MOVIE VERSION) COULD EVER BE DONE BETTER ...... SAY HELLO TO THE VERY BEAUTIFUL ""SALMA HAYEK"" AS ""ESMERALDA"" IN THIS MOVIE TITLED ""THE HUNCHBACK"", WOW !! I HAVE ALL THE MOVIE VERSION'S OF ""VICTOR HUGO'S"" CLASSIC IN MY MOVIE COLLECTION .... AND I MUST SAY THIS IS CERTAINLY MY FAVORITE !!!!!",1398211200,2,612,4.773584905660377
