8394076,2,B003C5FMLW,"John E. Faircloth was kind in his review, believe it or not. I got the set at KMart for $2.99. It was overpriced.

God help us and curses on the Blair Witch Let's Do The Stupid Jerky Camera Routine Project writers. I made it through 15 horrific minutes of MONSTER before I gave up and thought it a pity it was on the disk with the other two, cuz otherwise I'd have thrown it in the garbage. (That is still a possibility, by the way.)  I personally believe a law should be passed that the next person who even attempts to film a movie in that style be shot.

I AM OMEGA is another in a long line of last man on earth rip-offs offering us immediately the first rule (SPOILER ALERT)of escape: Remember your car keys. If you learn nothing else from this three-some of terror, remember that.  I'm thinking seriously of having it tattooed on my butt. Our last man, ""martial arts master Mark Dacascos"", still has all the conviences of modern society save the aggravation of other people. Plus he gets votes for thinking nunchuks are a good zombie weapon. I'd go for a 12 gauge shotgun myself, but I'm no ""master"" like Mr. Dacascos.  He's a McGuiver jack of all trades and the best he can do vehicle-wise is an old Pontiac with a cassette deck. In good times I wouldn't drive that car. How old is this movie?! Someone could explain the pet Rex bunny but doesn't. Zombies look like a cross between old style Klingons and a nuclear fatality. Mark is so incredibly careless (in my view) I don't understand how he's managed to survive. He lives in a house with a lot of glass and windows, and fences that are wooden and fragile looking.  Anyway, he gets a computer message from a young girl which totally freaks him out. I'm freaked out that he has a working computer. Honestly, it really never improves yet the excitment of wondering why he was still among the non-nuclear/Klingons kept me watching till the bitter end.

AVH: ALIEN VS HUNTER is really a TinMan alien and a kind'a alien/spider with octopus arms. No, I'm not joking. There is nothing funny - more's the pity - about any of these movies. I like William Katt and he does the best he can with what he is given here. I'm sure he needs the money. I can't think of another reason for him to have done it.  The aliens, by the way, are really bad. Worst I've seen since CREATURE.  First off we have Katt jogging and running into a cop buddy. I liked the exchange here, I liked Katt and his friend. It begins going downhill at a breakneck speed when they drive up to a trailer. Oddly enough SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT they manage to do this without noticing a huge crashed spaceship behind the trailer. In fact, the smoke and fire that are obviously once Katt went around to the back wasn't seen as they drove up. Nor could the crackling of the fire be heard until then. Amazing. Anyway a bad costume, er alien, bounces out and eats the cop.  A teenage girl shows up and she and Katt are suddenly elsewhere. It's like magic.

STILL DOING SPOILERS Like Katt, we have a cast that is adequate to the task but helpless in the face of substandard effects and crappy script. The spider alien has eyesight like a fly, apparently. How it even navagates is beyond me, much less attack and kill folks.  The hunter alien, or TinMan, is also stumbling around missing chance after chance to kill anything, including the trapped-in-this-script people. (I'm sure he was a Storm Trooper in another movie) The survivalist manages two death scenes which is unusual. Really no surprises is this movie. When it ends the few survivors are all happy and laughing, dispite the fact they've just lost friends, and walk off into the sunset.  Then we have the little extra of the hunter taking off his helmet and I'd tell you what happens then but it's just too stupid for words.  The best thing about it is it's so much better than the other two which is why this mess gets at least two stars.",1343001600,2,3928,4.4375
8394077,2,B003C5FMLW,Grade D movies at best.  These things are not worthy of being on Amazon or anyone with an IQ over 70.  Please do not watch these.  It probably kills braincells.,1337212800,,160,4.266666666666667
