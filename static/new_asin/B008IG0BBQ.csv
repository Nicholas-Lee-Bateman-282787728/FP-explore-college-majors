I would encougage everyone to purchase this movie, you won't be sorry/",1354060800,,137,4.75
5167290,5,B008IG0BBQ,"We did not have this movie, and thought it would be good family watching,  and it was.  I would reccommend it for any family.",1353110400,,125,4.166666666666667
5167291,1,B008IG0BBQ,"The singing by George Canyon is the star of the movie (in my eyes). He sang two songs and really did a great job, I probably should give the movie another star because of him. The movie is a very low budget movie, and at times it seemed like it was self directed. This movie is not horrible, and I know some people will think I am for what I am about to say. I remeber years ago when I still had a few sparkles in my eyes, our Bible Study Group was asked to write and perform an Easter Play. We all sat around in a circle and the theme kept growing, and it grew...... and finally someone said this is long enough, so we need to figure out how to end it. So we did. This movie reminds me of that play.... not a bad story line, but not really a profesionally produced movie either. Someone created a pot-luck stew, and it didn't taste too bad. If you are looking for something to take to your Bible-Study group to generate some conversation, I recommend it. If you are looking for a movie to add to your Christmas Collection, you may want to keep looking.",1351728000,15,1053,4.116504854368932
5167292,4,B008IG0BBQ,"I won't spend the time to go over the fine details of what this movie contained.  I will say that it was on the serious side, so if you are looking for light hearted, then this is probably not the movie for you.  I will say that even on the serious side, it is a good wholesome movie for the entire family.  Good Christmas movie.",1351209600,29,329,4.030769230769231
5167293,3,B008IG0BBQ,"Having seen Kinkade's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thomas-Kinkade-s-Christmas-Cottage/dp/B001KWV90W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thomas Kinkade's Christmas Cottage</a>, which is my favorite and truly a worth watching once Christmas movie, and his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Christmas-Lodge/dp/B005UKKKAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Christmas Lodge</a>&nbsp;movie, which was good, but not as good as Christmas Cottage.. I had high hopes for this movie. I rented it online for $3.99, as I did not know if I would want to buy it for my collection of Christmas movies. I do however plan to tell others to watch it and rent it or buy it in hopes the revenues will encourage his family and estate to keep making Christmas movies. Kinkade was one of the few still putting out good solid family and faith Christmas movies before his death earlier this year and any one who likes these kind of movies I encourage to help support this movie. Rent or buy his Christmas Cottage and Christmas Lodge as well. The reasons I give this 3 stars are because it is a dark color movie, I realize it takes place at night and in a old church, but it gives a overall gloomy feel to the movie. The characters were some what believable, but not as good as in the first two movies. Each movie has new characters and they are not connected in story line. Only Christmas Cottage is about Kinkade's early years and life I believe. I feel that Christmas movies people enjoy because they offer wonder and joy and I did not feel either much during this movie, which is part of why I am giving it 3 stars. I liked the old church idea in it, but it moved slow in the story line and the Characters did not pull me into the story with their acting very well. It just did not compare to the first two Kinkade movies. I do hope that this is not the last Kinkade Christmas movie though, this is a good legacy and I'd rent every future movie they make if they make more. If they are good, I'd buy them too. If you are not sure about buying it, at least rent it, or buy it and watch it and then give it away to someone else to watch.",1350950400,24,2182,4.932065217391305
5167294,4,B008IG0BBQ,"Like most people, I LOVE holiday movies.  They are cheesy, sappy, and heartfelt and that is what I need and expect in my holiday movies. Christmas Miracle didn't disappoint it had the right about of cheesiness and a beautiful holiday message.

Matt's parents are separated and heading toward a divorce. His father is trying to get to him when he ends up meeting a bunch of others who are also on a mission to get wherever they need to go for the holiday. Due to a downed tree these strangers end up counting on each other for survival during a winter storm by taking refugee in a church. Each person has their own story and fate has brought them together for a very good reason. They all need to learn something, remember something, or feel something. It is a sweet family movie about kindness, friendship, love and forgiveness and was thoroughly enjoyable.",1350864000,52,857,4.631578947368421

5167472,4,B008IG0BBQ,"Enjoyed watching this movie about 8 people stranded in a snow storm who take refuge in an abandoned church.  There's the happily married man, the very sad man, the bickering couple, the newly married couple and the separated couple.  Each struggling with something in their lives.  Most of their cars pile up one after the other when a vehicle comes to a stop in a bend in the road due to a downed tree.  The man who first stopped knows the area and leads everyone to an abandoned church where they discuss, bicker and struggle.  There were some very meaningful moments to think about in real life.  However, there were some things that drove me nuts, which I had to ignore.  And, I had also read up on Thomas Kincaid.  Some very disparaging words about him, but the movie is a good movie all things considered.  Nice ending.  If you don't want to read what drove me nuts, stop reading here.

________________________________________________________________________

What did I see that drove me nuts?  Not everyone ends up at the bend in the road all at one time. One person arrives in a 4-wheel drive and walks to the church.  Now, why didn't they take her 4-wheel drive back to their house with everyone in it?  Did I miss the part where the vehicle was not drive able?  The other part is the fact that another person walks from a house, gets lost but also close enough to be found.  Why didn't they walk back to the house?  Except the injured person. It really bugged me.  Maybe I missed something but ... I did enjoy the movie otherwise.",1482537600,,1542,4.562043795620438

A crisis situation brings issues to the forefront and they are able to recognize and deal with them.  Probably not a kid's movie-geared toward adults that know life is not perfect.  A feel good movie, not a guy movie with explosions. (Not meant as a slam, but an observation and description.)  I thought some of the characters were a little cliche', but it worked well for the movie.  Filmed somewhere in the Pacific Northwest i think (probably British Columbia, Canada).",1481846400,,594,5.135416666666667

There was nothing unpredictable about the storyline, and do not expect a miracle of the supernatural sort. But the getting together of these people for mutual cooperation and support is very heart-warming. Weak points: the acting by the woman who sprayed her ankle, the babysitter, and the newlywed bride. Also, the boy with ""autism"" showed none of the typical symptoms and acted as normally as his acting would allow.  3 stars.",1481328000,,522,5.0

5167634,3,B008IG0BBQ,"This is a decent film, but definitely not five stars.  There are too many holes in the plot, almost no real resolution, and very unrealistic situations.  How do five cars come to the same spot within sixty seconds, but not a single car comes after or before?  When they're walking in a supposedly brutal winter storm, almost no snow is falling and they're walking on packed-down snow.  And the church is close enough to town for an eight-year-old autistic boy to walk to in fifteen minutes in a ""blizzard,"" yet too far away from town for a bunch of able-bodied adults to cover?  If you want to enjoy this, you really have to suspend disbelief and accept silly things.  Decent acting and believable characters, but weak story and awful storm simulations.",1481328000,3,753,4.709923664122138

Kinda cheesy. Slow. My pet peeve, another Christmas movie where its a blizzard and freezing, yet no one seems cold. When do they film these things in July? You cant stay in the car because the heat won't catch up, but you get to the church and wait an hour to light a fire?

We were watching as many good ,love, christian and Christmas movies as we could then she Passed suddenly of cancer a week and a half after she had gone in the hospital. Did get to bring her home because she wanted to pass here with her parrot and I, having just me to take care of her as always.  Her father had passed over 4 1/2 before. The actors and actresses were all good in it too as well as the singing and music! Loved it!! Thank you for having it on prime, please put more like this on!! I really need these type of movies.

Most of it was very good, but I felt like the concluding song was a little bit of a let down since most of the movie seemed to have some positive spiritual values and the concluding song seemed a bit too secular for this movie since a lot of the plot seemed to be seeking God's guidance in your life.  However, the movie does make you think and ponder your own spiritual condition along with giving you some very warm fuzzies so it is definitely worth watching",1477094400,2,525,4.402061855670103

5167990,3,B008IG0BBQ,"I guess it's kind of cute? I didn't love that six of the stranded people were married couples working through marriage problems. Really? Did we have to hash out the same theme three times? Why not have a couple who loves each other struggle together through a common issue like a wayward child or an illness or something? Ugh. Also, there are two twangy, country-style Christmas numbers. Kind of painful to sit through, so I rotated laundry and brushed my teeth instead. Finally, the wind is howling as background noise during the. entire. movie. I'm going to hear it in my dreams tonight.

But, ok, it has redeeming qualities. Love is rekindled, faith is restored, cooperation abounds, and there is even a kid with super, super fake autism in it to try pulling your heartstrings. There is touchy-feely Christmas cheesy goodness throughout. It is shot quite beautifully and makes me kind of want to bond with some random strangers during a blizzard in a church basement (now that I've said that out loud, it sounds kind of creepy. NEVERMIND). You won't miss out by not seeing it, but it doesn't hurt to watch I guess. I'll probably pull it out again next year and make exactly the same commentary I did this year, only I'll skip all the marital bickering which takes up a good third of the movie. Did I mention that bugged me? Bleh.",1450137600,7,1332,4.6440677966101696

It was very exciting it showed love it showed how people can get together that have nothing in common if cornered into a situation where they the group of people are the only ones around they will learn to except each other more quickly and not be so eager to judge . It shows the love of the child to see his dad on Christmas that was the most important thing for him just to see and be with his dad . The real struggles that people go through the real efforts of raising children the real love of children loving their parents and the gifts of little things personal things but mainly the gift of love for each other and the gift of our Savior and God for there being such a thing as Christmas,1449100800,2,753,4.094594594594595

5168028,3,B008IG0BBQ,"In the Christmas season I tend to like a more upbeat and feel good movie so you can guess that this wasn't my cup of tea.  I got the movie because it was a Thomas Kinkade movie and I had really enjoyed The Christmas Cottage.  I do like to toss in a nice heart warming movie with my Santa and Christmas fantasy films once in a while.  This is about a group of people with problems stranded in a abandoned church in the woods during a bad winter storm.  Helping each other they work things out.  Whether it is the acting or the directing this film has a more depressing feel to it than seems necessary.  It is a okay film for a watch, but not one that is going to get a following.",1418947200,,678,4.022388059701493

If you're looking for award-winning acting, then I'm afraid you'll be disappointment.

5168043,5,B008IG0BBQ,"I saw two places n this movie, that touched my heart, because they were miracles that happened to me and my family.

One spot where the little boy is out walking in the snow, and he found his parents just as he passed out, he would have froze to death. My brother was in a boating accident, where the great White shark breeds, in Tamales Bay. My brothers boat sank (short version) and he was in the water, for about three to four hours. The coast Guard was searching for my brother, and they found him at 9:00 at night with a spot light from a helicopter, on the grid pattern. They got him to the hospital, and his body temperature did not register. The Doctor told him, if you had been in the water for 5 more minutes, he would be dead. The week before, was the first time they had practiced rescue with a helicopter.

Spot number two, the wife was talking to the Pastor, and she told him about her son being autistic, and how he loved bells. The Pastor heard something he needed to hear to help the little boy and his family. My wife got her green card, because somebody heard something they were supposed to hear. Short story, I prayed before I went in to the immigration office that God would give me the right words to say. We were in talking to the immigration Officer, and she asked a question, so I answered it. I mentioned that I broke up with my fiance, to finsh 1999. I broke up with her on Dec 31. I went into a Clinical depression. Our Pastor had his sermon on a Mock Wedding. He had the bride and the Groom there marching down the aisle. This was showing God's relationship with the Church, while I was running sound, so I had to stay for the whole service. After I cleaned up, I went home sobbing, and then God spoke to me. He told me to buy books and tapes on Marriage. The Interviewer, interupted me, and said she wanted to tell me something when I was finished. I finished my answer, then she said, coming into work this morning, she heard Joyce Meyers on the radio, saying if your going to get married, buy books and tapes. That ended the interview, she grabbed my wifes Passport and stamped it. She was not even supposed to hear our case, somebody else was.

The movie really brought these two things out, on a rating of 1 to 10 I would give at least a 15",1391644800,,2275,4.213302752293578
5168044,3,B008IG0BBQ,"I was sick with the flu the week after Christmas, so I watched a lot of movies in bed.  This was one of them.  It wasn't great, but it was still a good movie to watch while stuck in bed.  It has a nice wholesome message.  It's not very Christmas-y, but I enjoyed it.",1389312000,,266,3.8703703703703702

In the beautiful little town of Summitview, (which looks like it is maybe in the Colorado or Montana mountains), a snowstorm and icy roads make driving impossible.  Seven strangers, stuck on the roadway, are forced to abandon their cars and take refuge in a deserted church.
