8548244,3,B00A8KOG6G,"OK fist let me say the is not correct, its not the US festival, its a much later concert during the Sammy Hegar Year's (its the 5150 Tour). It appears to be a concert recorded in New haven Ct. Its not a bad concert, in fact its good. The sound quality is good not great a 3 out of 5 I would give it: and the picture is good not great again 2 out of 5. You can get better quality DVDs for the Sammy Years. I am being a little generous with this review. One last thing all the tittles are in Spanish hear, but its easy to figure out even if you don't speak Spanish.",1433203200,,563,3.8205128205128207
