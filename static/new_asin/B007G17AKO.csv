5084372,3,B007G17AKO,This was OK but a bit boring. Also they all spoke Spanish which was strange. I would rather watch movies in English.,1363046400,,116,4.318181818181818
5084373,5,B007G17AKO,This film brings back memories of the police movies with Jean-Paul Belmondo in the1960s. The acting comes through as brutally honest. The plot is unexpectedly twisted.,1357171200,,167,5.461538461538462
5084374,5,B007G17AKO,"This is a very entertaining movie.

Nothing like the brain dead trash that mostly comes out of Hollywood these days.

The plot is excellent and the acting is very good.

I can highly recommend this movie as worth renting and watching.",1356739200,,234,4.658536585365853
5084375,4,B007G17AKO,"This is a lone wolf action flick.  It is a different style than standard Amerian police drama.  American heroes especially police don't usually force their way into bars or night clubs extorting free drinks and threatening.  The subtitles slowed the action fo me but I reviewed several sections to catch where the action was going. The compostion and shooting style was gritty and raw and helped to convey the desperation in the lead character.  Although the protagonists seemed to be to easily followed and eradicated, the real conflct as always is man against himself.",1356393600,2,570,5.031914893617022
5084376,4,B007G17AKO,"Unlike most American movies there is nothing dumbed down about this show. Most American movie makers so dumb down the scripts it's insulting. This movie grabs hold of ya from start to finish and never lets go. Excellent, Bravo, WELL WORTH THE PRICE OF ADMISSION.",1356307200,,262,4.844444444444444
5084377,5,B007G17AKO,"Being so satisfied with this movie, immediately reminds me what north american movies lack most of the time. There is a gritty, raw & uncut motif in movies like this and it is such a nice break from the britney pop US crap that is released constantly. This movie in particular has a character who is despicable, and he emits this grit I'm speaking of like white on rice. Yes I hated him, and I loved every minute of hating him.

This didn't have a cookie cutter ending, it just ended. And when it did, I was ready. I dug this movie. If you liked El Mariachi, and also appreciate slower paced movies with intermittent brutal violence then you will like this. No lame one liners in this movie, just a real bad arse man who does what he wants, the way he wants, when he wants to fricking do it!",1356220800,,791,4.23841059602649
5084378,4,B007G17AKO,"Ever since I read a review and saw the poster then the title, I knew it was going to be a great film. Jose Coronado as the corrupt detective is just brilliant. An instant classic in the genre. Comparable to No Country for Old Men and The Departed with some Training Day.",1332374400,,270,4.211538461538462

8516140,3,B007G17AKO,"Basically a drunk gets kicked out a bar that's closing up when he demands a drink, stops to relieve himself while driving home, turns round an notices a strip club on the other side of the road. He goes inside, is told by a woman cleaning up that they're closed, he demands a drink because the stereo is playing music, a male employee comes out and also tells him he needs to leave, he demands a rum and Coke and produces his police badge.  They still tell him to leave.  The owner comes out and tells the woman to make the officer a drink on the house.  He tells him you just missed some very hot women you should come back another night, for free for you of course. Maybe not liking that they are holding a verbal mirror up to his corruption and intimidation with the badge he shoots all three.  When he goes to get the security footage, another person is upstairs, who manages to avoid getting killed. Now he's got to track him down, in between rum and Cokes of course.

I found this one to be pretty boring for the most part.  It is watchable but definitely wasn't the clever movie others have portrayed it as.",1511827200,,1114,4.280952380952381

8516142,5,B007G17AKO,I do not mind subtitles. I have closed caption on most of the time so I don't miss dialogue. This was such an interesting movie. Many twists and turns in the plot. Surprise ending.,1466467200,,180,4.323529411764706
8516143,5,B007G17AKO,"Some people don't like reading captions when watching movies, I read captions on every movie I watch, regardless of the language it's made in. You would be amazed at how much you miss when your just watching any movie. This is a really well made action movie with a good plot, the characters are well played, and the story line really comes to light in the final scenes. I personally usually watch and read every movie at least twice, as well pause it to re-read if necessary as I go, which allows me the best possible understanding of what I just saw ... just look a good book",1417305600,,577,4.351851851851852
8516144,4,B007G17AKO,"I've seen my share of crime thrillers and this is about as original an idea as I've come across.

Here's the scoop. This film is set in Spain. Santos Trinidad is a greazy police detective with some serious baggage. One night he makes a bar stay open past hours by flashing his badge. He just wants to drink his rum and Cokes. You get the feeling he's been drinking all day. The three working the club try to play nice but it ticks him off and he shoots all three. What he doesn't realize is that there's a fourth person upstairs who beats a retreat. Now he needs to hunt this person down before his dirty deed is exposed. As a judge and senior detective get involved in investigating the triple murder some surprising things come to light.

This is a clever, densely plotted flick with a nifty twist. There's no way to say it without spoiling so I'll leave the twist out of things. But this involves some good police work on both the side of the detective as well as the judge. And there are no histrionics here. This is done very 'by the book' in calm fashion. The jolts that do come happen by their nature and not by them needing to be pumped up. And there's some creepy stuff as well. When he is subpoenaed by the judge, sits in her office for questioning and calmly lies to her, it makes your skin crawl. And we get glimpses of how he came from being in the exalted 'Special Ops' to the state we find him in in the beginning of the film. I never want to be anywhere near this guy.

The acting, directing, music and all other production values are good without being flashy. I can easily see Hollywood grabbing this idea and turning it into a mega hit. It's not that far off from ""Insomnia"" with Al Pacino.

If you like clever thrillers that will keep your brain pan in gear, this should do you well.",1380499200,,1803,4.2631578947368425
8516145,4,B007G17AKO,"With the biblical title inspired by verses in the Book of Isaiah, ""No Rest for the Wicked"" (""No habr paz para los malvados"") follows the story of Santos Trinidad (Jose Coronado), a grizzled police detective of the Missing Persons Unit, who has shot three persons to death while drunk in the bar.

While chasing the witness who ran away, Santos stumbles upon a major criminal plot. Unbeknown to his fellow officers, Santos, once a highly decorated intelligence professional, embarks on his own investigation, but the official investigation into HIS murders, led by Inspector Chacon (Helena Miquel) and aided by his former fellow officer Leiva (Juanjo Artero), slowly catches up with Santos.

There is something subversive about this Spanish noir directed by Enrique Urbizu (""Box 507""). Santos is not just a bad cop; he is repugnant and obnoxious. The film refuses to explain what drives Santos, perpetually drunk and ill-tempered, to behave as he does. To call him an anti-hero is an understatement at best because, well, nobody including viewers would relate to him. The portrayal of this enigmatic protagonist is made all the more fascinating with Jose Coronado's charismatic performance, without which the film would have been a failure.

Obviously ""No Rest for the Wicked"" has to say a few things about the ineffectiveness of the bureaucratic police system. Some details may refer to the real-life bombings in 2004, though, if so, I don't know what part of the film does so, except the locations and the date. I enjoyed the film as a crime drama, aside from the flat supporting characters and slightly exploitative nature of the storyline.",1379116800,,1642,5.096654275092937
8516146,4,B007G17AKO,"This film contains great plot twists and character development which it develops through violence with a steady grace.  I'd say more, but don't want to give anything specific away.",1369785600,,180,5.206896551724138
8516147,5,B007G17AKO,"I love spanish films! This Goya-award movie is amazing, the story is intriguing and very original! The acting is phenomenal!",1369180800,,124,5.25
8516148,5,B007G17AKO,"This a movie with basic action and location settings.  You are not going to get Bond level or M.I. over-the-top mayhem.  If you speak Spanish, it will make things easier, but it's not too bad with the sub-title color and font (I've seen better).  Oh, there is no sex other than a few Spanish hotties used as background actors.  The lead female investigator is just beautiful and classy.  If you are wondering about the price, this is not a major release and so they expect distribution through AMZ to make up for for fewer eyes at the theater.  In short a good action flick at a fair price to keep more coming.

Trust me, you'll notice the little details like eyedrops for weary cops and tossing evidence in six different directions at a dumpster.  The continuity is very tight. Enjoy.",1365292800,,785,4.557142857142857
