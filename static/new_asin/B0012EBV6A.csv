3087876,5,B0012EBV6A,"Truly indicative of why my favourite comedies and actors are british, this little nugget of strange is both hilarious and ineffable. Truly worth a look if you enjoy examining the weird side of life.",1332460800,2,198,4.852941176470588
3087877,5,B0012EBV6A,"A dark comedy starring (arguably) the world's greatest and most versatile actor, Gary Oldman.  Hysterical, fast, neurotic, and offensive at times, this movie embraces all things great about British humor, delivered in a clever, believable way.",1319760000,,243,5.75
3087878,1,B0012EBV6A,"Despite its impressive cast including three gifted actors Gary Oldman, Robert Carlyle and Terence Stamp, I never heard of ""Dead Fish"" until recently. But I am a Gary Oldman fan and I was naturally interested in this crime comedy in which Oldman plays a hitman named Lynch. Here Lynch, competent but humorless, is suddenly attracted (romantically) to a girl Mimi (Elena Anaya) at a London station, where he helps her to retrieve her stolen cell phone, using his professional skills.

The idea sounds interesting, but the filmmakers completely failed to develop it into a decent story. Mimi was actually using the cell phone of her irresponsible boyfriend Abe (Andrew-Lee Potts), a petty criminal who owes money to a loan shark Danny (Robert Carlyle). For some reasons I don't understand, none of them - Abe, Lynch and Mimi - realize that Abe's cell phone is switched with Lynch's. More unbelievably, Abe actually accepts an ""offer,"" not knowing the nature of a job that the killer Lynch should be doing.

The contrived set-up is followed by more incredible situations and stupid decisions of the uninteresting characters. For all its nice locations and interesting supports (Billy Zane, Jimi Mistry and Kevin R. McNally) the film lingers on pointless scene with uninspired dialogues. In short, if you are looking for Guy Ritchie, you will be disappointed. Acting is just average. If always reliable Gary Oldman looks bored, you know there is something wrong with the film.

""Dead Fish"" is exactly what its unattractive title suggests.",1254009600,,1533,5.099601593625498
3087879,2,B0012EBV6A,"Am a die hard Gary Oldman fan, watched almost all of his films available, when I ordered this I thought he would carry the movie and make it a fun experience, alas,this did not happen. He walked through the film without giving us the movie fan a performance we have come to expect from Mr. Oldman, excellence.",1252886400,2,309,4.43859649122807
3087880,5,B0012EBV6A,"I would consider every movie a good movie watching which I have a good time, especially when this feeling is confirmed to last with the ending of the movie leaving a good taste at me. It feels good to end something with the feeling of knowing that each second spent on it was totally worth it. This movie a friend of mine(to whom I should thank at the soonest occasion)gave to me was one of those movies in the every sense of the word, making me wonder while watching what was gonna happen, how the story would continue to unfold in the next scenes. Each character chosen to play in this movie suits his/her role perfectly in my opinion. Andrew Lee Potts couldn't have possibly acted better among these good actors as Abu character who is a kind of guy who mostly finds himself in the middle of the unsolveable-looking tough situations he didn't begin, yet each time finds a way to get out of the situation with the lest damage, sure with the luck on his side. I liked a lot his vulnerable, innocent character who is inside a good person and never wants to do the wrong thing indeed but is drawn to bad situations as things happen totally unplanned and out of his control. Robert Carlyle :) lol well this talkative Scottish man's character doesn't require to make any comments I would say, he's a movie on his own :) I burst out laughing most on the scenes where he plays...One of the most gifted actors I've seen yet lol. Love every move he makes...Billy Zane and others are good as well bringing a different taste into the movie making it more watchable in its different comedy line. The ending was totally unpredictable for me as it will most likely be for you, surely on the condition that you don't read it here or elsewhere, which you shoudln't. Overall this is certaintly a good comedy movie the story of which unfolds literally in a much different&nicer way than those that I've watched in the last years, which is why I've given it 5 out of 5.",1247529600,8,1952,4.440111420612813
3087881,1,B0012EBV6A,A pointless movie that never finds its true identity - it tries too hard and not enough at the same time. The movie has a good cast that got wasted for naught.,1241740800,,159,4.0
3087882,2,B0012EBV6A,"Sometimes I wonder what really makes the Brits laugh. I really can't explain what went on, other than Gary Oldman, the hit man falls in love with this pregnant girl at a train station......Karel Rodan (another hit man) was sorta funny talking with Billy Zane, his handler, ummmm. Terence Stamp was supposed to be dead, but ended up still alive in the end to save the young couple. Yeah, well, you have to see this movie to believe it. British humor. This is not helpful. Little wonder I'm only the second reviewer of this movie. I don't think too many people have much to say about this movie.",1235433600,,593,4.5
3087913,5,B0012EBV6A,Movie was as described. Quickly shipped. I highly trust & recommend the seller. Gary Oldman is one of my favorite actors.,1424995200,,121,4.809523809523809
3087914,5,B0012EBV6A,"D.A.N.N.Y D.E.V.I.N.E.  He is the whole reason to watch this film. This could have been a great cult classic sorta film, but the editing is not great.... a couple of scenes are just ridiculous like Oldman's singing sceen..WTH? BUT, Robert Carlyle's character Danny Devine is SO COOL I had to buy it so I could watch his parts over and over. Seriously worth it.",1424822400,2,360,4.625

3087917,5,B0012EBV6A,If you like British humor  this movie very funny If you don't like British humor you'll hate it. I thought it was hilarious,1389744000,,123,4.3478260869565215
3087918,4,B0012EBV6A,"A surreal romp through London. Gary Oldman is charming  as a socially inept hitman.  Robert Carlyle's Danny Devine keeps you laughing (sometimes in spite of yourself).  Terrence Stamp steals scenes with a flick of his wrist.  A fun movie, with so much going on, you'll watch it repeatedly.",1382745600,,289,4.958333333333333
3087919,4,B0012EBV6A,"As a huge Robert Carlyle fan, I purchased this movie in an effort to watch everything he has ever made. I found this to be a bizarre little movie and you really have to pay attention to what's going on or you completely lose track. Robert's character (Danny Devine) was a total idiot and absolutely hilarious..I even find myself laughing as I write this review just thinking about it. The basic story is about Abe(Andrew Lee Potts)an innocent young guy, who gets caught up in a murder for hire plot when his cell phone gets mixed up with the one owned by a hitman(Gary Oldman). Needless to say, everything that can go wrong...does and it's quite funny watching it play out. Robert Carlyle plays a small time business man and it seems everyone owes him money. Just watching him harass his clients was enough to make my sides hurt from laughter. That being said this movie may not be for everyone...but for price I paid, it was enjoyable enough and that's why I gave it 4 stars.",1363478400,3,976,4.519774011299435
3087920,2,B0012EBV6A,This was a disappointment for gary oldman.  part was definely not for him.  have seen robert carlyle in different characters and as usual very funny. but too silly for mr oldman/.,1349740800,,179,4.741935483870968
3087921,4,B0012EBV6A,"Okay, I'm always distracted by too many F-bombs, and there are a lot in this movie. I think every character but one drops a few. But I'm a writer, and story does triumph in this movie. It is funny. It has a few surprises, and the end is satisfying, if not a little too convenient. But you'll enjoy. I recommend watching it with the language guardian on, though, especially if cursing is not ""realism"" to you. Movie makers seem to believe that everyone uses a cuss word every five seconds, but such is life for some.",1348617600,,515,4.375
