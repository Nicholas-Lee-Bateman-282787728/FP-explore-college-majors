8283554,3,B001BMN40E,"The DVD description states: ""Using a contemporary style and narration, DESIGN 2 is hip, fun, and informative."" In fact it is neither hip, nor fun, nor terribly informative. This series was produced by European network Arte and consists of self-contained episodes, each 25 minutes in duration, focusing on significant moments in design through the following innovations: the bookworm bookshelf, the concorde, the conica coffee machine, the leica camera, the lounge chair and the vespa. The documentary format falls somewhere between ""how it's made"" and ""modern marvels"" and feels terribly dated (though it was produced in 2000.) The voice-over is excruciatingly didactic and if you are considering purchasing the DVD for classroom use, I would look elsewhere: it will put your students to sleep in seconds. The segments that incorporate interviews with the designers are far more engaging, but they are far and few between. The Leica episode is void of interviews and relies on an awkward narration that sounds like a word-for-word translation from the French script. One has the option to view the material in German, French and English. If you do speak French, I would recommend viewing the original version. A great concept for a documentary program, yet a poor and disappointing production.",1263081600,3,1293,5.31219512195122
