Particular dialog is really give perfect mood to the film. i don't say the story because it is better if you watch from start to finish. everybody have done a great job. Direction, editing, casting, Music, background music. even their was not much scope for songs some how Music director have done a great job. Particularly last 10 minis is really exiting. i like to say to KARAN JOHAR that make this kind film rather than making same kind of film, with the same casting. i must salute to entire team of the EK CHALIS KI LAST LOCAL. hey guys carry on to make brilliant movie...!",1304035200,,769,4.460992907801418
8199844,4,B000RADNLG,"Here is an underrated and overlooked post-Tarantino gangster flick set in modern India.  You know the film noir formula:  An ordinary guy is blown off course from his normal life at night, meets a mysterious woman in the rain, and becomes involved with various strange characters from the underworld.  ""Last Local"" traces its roots back to Edgar G. Ulmer's masterpiece ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Detour/dp/B00004W19C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Detour</a>"", and does a wonderful job invoking the atmosphere of unsafe areas of modern Bombay during the wee hours of the morning, while constantly confounding the viewer's expectations.

It starts off innocently enough.  Our hero works in a call center where he must deal with American customers.  He misses his train late at night and meets up with a beautiful woman who has also (apparently) missed her train.  For the first 30 minutes we might think we are watching a romance comedy.  But gradually we fall into the company of druggies, prostitutes, transsexuals, kidnappers and killers.  My favorites are the religiously devout killers who cheat at cards.  The movie becomes more violent as it goes on, eventually pilling up an astonishingly large number of killings.  All of these killings are done with black humor, Tarantino style, so it is difficult to tell if one should laugh or be disgusted.

The major flaw with this movie is the length which is about 2.5 hours.  The director had the conceit of making this in ""real time"" so the viewer is supposed to experience the time between 1:30 and 4 AM as it happens.  This is overlong, as the brain tires of the various twists and turn-arounds in the plot after the second hour.

This is not a bad movie.  A bad movie is overlong because of poor pacing, or not enough material to fill the film.  ""Last Local"" is well paced, and contains enough incident for 2 or 3 normal movies.  It is just a bit much for something that has no purpose other than entertainment.  Apparently, nobody outside of California understands how a good cutting room can save a movie.

There is a marketing problem.  This movie is not suitable for children.  Older or conservative Indians will not watch such subject matter.  And Americans will not watch subtitled movies.  (Perhaps they cannot read and watch at the same time?)

Some will scream at this suggestion.  But I think someone could make a lot of money if they cut this movie down to 90 minutes and did voice over tracks in Spanish and English.  That way they could sell it to cable TV.  As it is, it is a gem in the rough, that will probably vanish from sight.",1199404800,,2639,4.9363636363636365
