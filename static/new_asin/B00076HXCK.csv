8169379,5,B00076HXCK,"We really enjoy our ""Lighthouses Of The Outer Banks"" DVD. Our family has been traveling to the Outer Banks for years.. and we fell in love with the lighthouses there. This video is beautifully photographed and edited.. it's just as if you were touring the lighthouses themselves. A must if you are an Outer Banks or lighthouse lover!",1109894400,4,333,4.758620689655173
