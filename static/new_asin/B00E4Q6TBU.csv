5890386,3,B00E4Q6TBU,Not the movie I thought it was very old films of Sam Elliott and the quality is not good at all skips in some spots.,1395446400,8,116,3.68
5890387,3,B00E4Q6TBU,"Enjoyed Gone to Texas and I Will Fight No More Forever, but Blue River was crappy, and I didn't even watch Seduced.  Don't like that kind of movie.  Not the type of movie I like to see Sam in.

5890388,4,B00E4Q6TBU,"All 4 Movies were good, I enjoyed watching them, most movies with Sam Elliott in them, are very good, one thing about this Guy, he takes no Crap from Nobody. If you enjoy watching Westerns, then this one is for you.",1445299200,,215,4.2682926829268295
5890389,5,B00E4Q6TBU,"My favorite cowboy, Sam Elliott, was excellent in every movie.  He is the ultimate hero, and he enhances the books that inspired these movies.  Louis L'Amour [was] lucky to have him boost his stories on the big screen.",1445126400,,218,4.7105263157894735

5890393,4,B00E4Q6TBU,A must for the big Sam Elliott fan who wants to see everything. Not the best movies he was in but he is solid as always.,1432425600,,120,3.6538461538461537
5890394,4,B00E4Q6TBU,"Of the 4 movies in this collection, I had viewed 2 before I purchased this collection.
1. 'Gone to Texas' I liked quite a bit. 2. 'I will fight no more forever' I really liked. 3. 'Seduced' was disturbing, but had an interesting, albeit disappointing ending. and 4. 'Blue River' I did not like the description and so I didn't even watch it.
If you haven't seen the first two, then it is worth buying. If you have, then pass on this one.",1430006400,6,436,4.265060240963855

8601057,5,B00E4Q6TBU,Its hard to think of many masculine actors in the old style.  Sam Elliot is one of those who conveys the essence of old time masculinity.  As such I love whatever he appears in.,1529798400,,177,4.176470588235294
