8542277,5,B009JVUG4Q,"Sometimes a film comes out, and you wait to purchase it on VHS, and you play it, and play it, and ..., oh, well you get the point, right?  Well the was the story with me and Caf&eacute; Flesh.  I had never heard of this film, I was at a Science Fiction Convention in Washington, DC and was in the dealer's room, walking around, heard a couple of people mention Caf&eacute; Flesh, and asked them about it.  I was directed to one of the tables selling tapes and there it was. I bought a copy, and when I got home, played the thing.  The characters were curious, the plot silly, nuts, but it made sense.  A place where normal (norms) could go and have sexual intercourse without the fear of dying from a major disease.  The actors handled their roles well. I would say that this film fit in the world we live in today.",1483833600,2,815,4.225806451612903

8542283,4,B009JVUG4Q,"The first time I saw this film was at The Nuart Theater in Los Angeles. To this day I can remember seeing young women's jaws dropping when the first explicit scene hit the screen. It looked like they were glued to their seats, unmoving. My friend thought Cafe was mean and nasty (bitterly cynical is what he meant), but I saw something else there, and I am just now beginning to reflect on why this film fascinates me. The characters, the music, the setting, the ""numbers,"" everything worked to create a modern day vision of hell on earth. And if Hades is really both outer darkness and fire, surely that fire is the burning of unfulfilled desire and longing. This country seems to suffer from the same thing, as evidenced by the mass consumption of pornography. Seems many people can't control or quench that desire. make no mistake, Cafe Flesh DOES contain hardcore scenes, but it is an art film, first and foremost, with excellent acting, characters, and structure. Deserves to be seen, enjoyed, and pondered.",1404259200,7,1012,4.755681818181818
8542284,4,B009JVUG4Q,"I remember seeing this when it first came out at the famous Scala Repertory Film Theatre in London in the early 1980's. The glamour and sheer naughtiness of viewing a film said to be about porn but not necessarily a porn film enticed me, I think.

Whatever the reason, the film has a certain cachet about it. The idea of a nuclear war creating a divided nation of sex positives (those who can - and must - perform sexual acts without being sick) and sex negatives (those who can't) is original and, when viewing the film 25 years after its release, still makes me smile.

Those who act are good, particularly the excellent Andrew Nichols (as Max Melodramatic) and Michelle Bauer (under the pseudonym Pia Snow). Those who perform, but have lines, act unconvincingly, but perform well!

I just can't help liking this film, with its very explicit sexual acts (real porn here!) and absurd, but very clever, story line and dialogue. It can make you cringe, it will make some outraged but, hey, we are adults.

By the way, Stephen Sayadian (credited as Rinse Dream) does a great job. The excellent music is by Mitchell Froom, who produced and played on the albums of his ex-wife, Suzanne Vega. He has produced albums by Richard Thompson, Elvis Costello amongst others and is now married to Vonda Shepard. This must have been an interesting early project for him!

Have fun - it's worth it.",1394841600,7,1383,4.674897119341564
