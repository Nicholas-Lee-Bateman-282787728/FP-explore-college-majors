8359080,5,B002A89H0O,"I had no idea this DVD existed and ordered it as soon as I found it on Amazon. I think all the Moody Blues do excellent solo work but
I must admit I always play Justin's songs on a new album first. I so wish Mike Pinder would return. Anyhow, this is an excellent DVD.
Any Moody Blues fan would love it. It is Justin only. There are many great musicians backing him but none are Moody Blues.",1351468800,4,390,4.012820512820513
