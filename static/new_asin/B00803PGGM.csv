5115493,3,B00803PGGM,"The worst of the 3 is Blaze. A sad vehicle for the aging actor, Paul Newman. It is billed as a comedy. it is not, even, mildly amusing. A real waste of time. Dumb. I will give this movie 2 stars.
Dustin Hoffman is an acting icon (as are all 3 actors starring in these movies), But, even though he was not bad in this role, it just didn't seem to be a right fit for him. The acting, through out, is good and the story is OK.. I give this movie 3 1/2 stars. Just a little bit better than OK.
The best of the 3 is Nixon. Anthony Hopkins is brilliant as Nixon. He really captured him. The movie plays, somewhat, as a documentary..I think there was an element of editorial in the story, but it, basically, played true. This director's cut version has an additional 28 minutes added to a very long movie. I liked it, but I don't think it is for everyone. Anthony Hopkins gets 5 stars for his performance. I give the movie 4 stars.",1391644800,,924,4.110497237569061
5115494,3,B00803PGGM,"I bought this DVD because I got three movies for the price of one.  I wanted Billy.  The other two basically suck.  Especially Nixon.  Not even close to reality.  Bathgate is the only one that is fiction, yet its story of Dutch Schultz is close to the truth.",1381708800,,258,4.291666666666667
5115495,4,B00803PGGM,"....of these three movies.  ""Billy Bathgate"" is passable with Dustin Hoffman playing a very mean Dutch Schultz with great panache.  Bruce Willis is his usual swaggering self as the guy who gets ""in dutch with Dutch"" and pays the consequences.  Nicole Kidman is, well....Nicole Kidman.  A pretty fair movie--far better than ""Blaze"" with Paul Newman appearing to struggle speaking with new false teeth,  This one was so lame and crude I didn't even get through the first half.

""Nixon"" is the gem here and Anthony Hopkins is at the top of his game portraying that ""scoundrel President"" and actually evoking sympathy for his character.  He is both hateful and pitiable and you end of with a very different impression of Nixon after Hopkins' portrayal.  Granted, it's not an accurate presentation but it does give one pause to consider what was going on inside of Nixon's head and what he struggled with in his past that made him the man he turned out to be.  This movie is very well done.",1374710400,2,985,4.747058823529412
5115496,5,B00803PGGM,Yes they meet my expectation as 1980's movies go. Interesting biopic movies! Dustin Hofman and Paul Newman has always been great actors.,1373068800,,136,5.2272727272727275
5115497,4,B00803PGGM,"This is worth buying for just ""Nixon."" That is why I bought it and recommend Nixon very much. I would give it 5 stars.",1363305600,,118,3.9583333333333335
5115498,5,B00803PGGM,"I don't particularly care for the other two films, but I bought this because it has the Director's Cut with 28 minutes of added footage including the brilliant scene where Nixon meets with the CIA chief (played by Sam Waterston) that should have been in the final cut. For under $5 you can't go wrong!",1357862400,6,301,4.490909090909091
5115499,5,B00803PGGM,"This is a bargain. Three very good movies at a very reasonable price. I bought it for ""Nixon"" and was happy to find that the other two movies were excellent as well.",1357430400,4,165,4.1875

8523515,5,B00803PGGM,"I'm from the Kennedy-Nixon era, so it was interesting revisiting a time that held so much hope and turmoil at the same time.  Love the gangster era, so Billy Bathgate was definitely entertaining.  Blaze was a fun movie.",1469923200,,219,4.7368421052631575
8523516,5,B00803PGGM,Bought for hubby ! Thank you !,1465171200,,30,3.4285714285714284

8523518,4,B00803PGGM,"Paul Newman and Lola Davidovitch were funny, thoughtful.  Anthony Hopkins and Dustin Hoffman?  Great actors.  Maybe I am a bit squeamish, but don't watch Bathgate before sleeping (lol).",1453334400,,185,5.535714285714286
8523519,5,B00803PGGM,"Warning: something about government becomes the home entertainment mulch of America while you are watching these in movies. The most dreadful was the Nixon movie, with Anthony Hopkins as Nixon saying the president can bomb anyplace he wants. Getting legal advice was captured in the line: Nixon does nothing but swear.

Billy Bathgate is a fun with the twerp skinnydipping movie. Enjoy the old time latest developments when a fire inspector shows up for his payoff. Billy gets fired by a fading gang because sometimes would you rather be there or here? has two meanings.

Blaze is so outrageous that Paul Newman dies trying to fulfill his inner desires and the character Earl Long was buried a week after he was elected to Congress. A song by 10,000 Maniacs on Candy Everybody Wants tells us:

Give them what they want.

For years I thought of the Nixon movie as the story of some thugs and one human being named Martha Mitchell. There are only slightly more than one woman in each movie. Joan Allen as Pat Nixon is like Tom Petty trying to find a new bass player or drummer for the Heartbreakers. Howie died from the kind of addiction that drags people down like Americans living in a Jesus expledeleffingheimer.",1445472000,,1213,4.734597156398104
8523520,4,B00803PGGM,NIXON as portrayed by Anthony Hopkins is an enlightening look at the former U.S. President and his fall from power.,1439769600,,115,4.8
8523521,5,B00803PGGM,"Bouight only because my brother is the Auctioneer in the video. Haven't watched it as I saw it in the theater when it first came out. Rated 5 satrs, again because my brother was in it.",1430956800,,184,4.138888888888889
