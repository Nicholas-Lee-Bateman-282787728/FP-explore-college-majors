8011507,5,B0001EZ1ZY,THIS WAS GREAT AND FAST SHIPPING. WILL BUY AGAIN! THANK YOU VERY MUCH!,1417737600,,70,4.461538461538462
8011508,3,B0001EZ1ZY,"Yeah.. okayyyyy.. This movie is a strange one simply from the aspect of how its put together.  It would be very easy to just write it off as a huge waste of time.  But the odd thing about this flick is that you keep watching it despite the obvious ineptitude of just about everything except for the apparent fact that somebody knew how to write a screenplay of sorts and then break it down into scenes, shoot and edit those scenes together in such a way as to actually create a quasi-coherent story.  I gave it 3 stars because its not that a hated it or loved it.  But it caused a sort of fugue of confusion in me because I knew that somebody in this mess knew how to communicate a story via film, while at the same time couldn't have given a giant damn about acting and dialogue.. its the basement of horrible acting.. did they even rehearse any of this stuff?  Jeesh, its one take ed wood style.  But oddly enough there are sequences and scenes that actually kind of saves this celluloid silly putty from the crap pile.  I don't know people, its something you'd have to experience for yourself in order to understand.  You can preview this messterpiece on you tube like I did.  I don't think I would buy it unless I found it at a garage sale for a quarter..well..I'd pay half a buck for it, but NOTHING more! lol!  I feel bad for the guy that sweated over this one because one can see that he's got some definite movie making chops.. but wow whadda an overall train wreck.  But like all train wrecks it captures your attention and leaves you with an overwhelming sense of sick awe at the colossal carnage that stretches out before you.  You gotta you tube it! http://youtu.be/JvzyC2mjCNw  sit it out and actually watch it and youll see what I mean.. I think.",1401321600,,1760,4.361963190184049
8011509,4,B0001EZ1ZY,"I'll admit this movie has it's flaws - the acting and the sound at times are both weak, but despite what issues I had, I found this a very creepy movie. The nightmare sequence in particular stayed with me. Is this a perfect movie? No. Is this an obviously low budget production? Yes. Does it work as an adaptation of an excellent H. P. Lovecraft story? Yes. This one is well worth it, for the Lovecraft fan.",1313625600,,407,4.298701298701299
8011510,1,B0001EZ1ZY,"I've seen the good, the bad, and the ugly, but nothing is more ferociously ugly than this folks. I think a grade school play would be better than this sludge. I bought this from a seller on Amazon new for 58 cents (a red flag should have been slapping me in the face right then). I bought it because I am into H.P. Lovecraft and it said this was an adaptation of his story "" The Lurking Fear"". Well folks, the only Lurking Fear is waiting for you when you hit play. This is THE award winner for worst acting. The lines are read like they are reading them straight from the cue cards and as if they never rehearsed them. There is no emotion whatsoever to be found throughout the movie. I rarely foward through a movie, but made an exception with this snoozer. Nothing scary. Nothing surprising. Just a big waste of time. If you want to see some of the better H.P. Lovecraft adaptations, buy just about anything from director Stuart Gordon. But in closing, I'll just end by saying I spent 58 cents on this terd and it was 58 cents too much. I could have bought a can of Coke! What a waste of time and money.",1175558400,2,1105,4.216981132075472
8011511,2,B0001EZ1ZY,"Ugh.  Well, here's one for the crap-pile.  A perfect example of ""what not to do to an H.P. Lovecraft take""  (in other words, ruin it).  I read a review on a different site and it boasted the ""awesome sound track"".  good lord, it was worse than the movie!!!!  I could picture the guy in torn, acid washed jeans, up for days on tweak, shaking his sweet curly mullet and forking the devil sign while moshing around his living room, thinking this movie (and yes, the sound track, too) was the best thing since bathtub crank.

Sorry folks, bypass this one, unless you are a die-hard Lovecraft fan and on a mission to see all available (like me). Your time would be better spent, watching one of the other screenplay versions of The Lurking Fear (Lurking Fear and Bleeders a.k.a. Hemoglobin).

And yet, I gave it two stars....which I did because there's worse HPL films out there...lurking...sucking",1167264000,2,893,4.67948717948718
8011512,3,B0001EZ1ZY,"I enjoyed the film except the acting was a bit off. The points where the actors should of been scared, they were making dumb odd ball coments, which made me laugh rather than take the story seriously.

The ending I did not get. I have read lovecraft's ending and I enjoyed it. This film would of gotten 4 stars if it had stayed more adjacent with the original lovecraftian story.

Other than that, forget about the actors and focus on just the story and you will love it. A fine film for hangin out with friends or a girl on a friday or saturday night when there is nothing to do.",1145059200,3,580,4.216216216216216
8011513,4,B0001EZ1ZY,"Although not an accurate adaption of H.P. Lovecraft's ""The Lurking Fear,"" this film dose indeed deliver the mood that one would expect from an H.P Lovecraft story set in more modern times.

A couple residing within a camper in the woods is massacred and their deaths become the talk of a small Louisiana Town.  An investigative reporter, Clint Harrison, is summoned personally by the owner of a newspaper company to investigate the case. His job is to spend the night in the abandoned Dansen house which stands in the middle of the woods five miles away from the recent murder scene. The task makes no sense to Clint and his selected crew members, but they were being paid overtime, so why not?

This is where the sum of all of Harrison's nightmares begin. Returning from the house with a story which no one will believe, his boss insists that he should take a vacation. Haunted by his experience, Clint tries to find answers at a local Library and reads about the seemingly normal history of the Dansen family. Despite its normalcy in print, Clint learns through two parapsychology students that that house is legendary for producing unsolved murders. So hence the investigation continues, leading his new crew on a track of unspeakable discovery.

There the story is, but be warned, this film is plagued by awkward acting and the quality of the picture is not DVD quality. To me, the old grainy look seemed to fit this rather eerie movie, but...that's just me. And some things in the film do not coincide with reality, either. For instance, just because you bury a body in the woods, dose not mean it will not be found by police dogs. Just small things like that...

Otherwise, the film is great. I know Lovecraft did not include redneck characters in his books, but the film dose a great job at creeping you out. The dark, isolated settings and the threat of death that surrounds them when lightening strikes is perfect.",1128816000,9,1923,4.711309523809524
8011514,1,B0001EZ1ZY,"PEACOCK FILMS is a rip-off artist. They never paid director David McCormick one cent for the video release of this film after 10 years of sales and they also illegally released this film on DVD after being sent a termination letter by the director years prior to the release. Although their original contract has now expired they have flooded the market with this cheaply done DVD.

DO NOT SUPPORT THIS UNSCRUPULOUS COMPANY.

Please note that this has nothing to do with the vendors who are selling the DVD on-line. They are unaware of the situation.",1100736000,24,550,4.778947368421052
