1664968,5,B00005TRZ6,"Like some other people who wrote a review I rented now and then here and there from a local blockbuster and if I didn't  see the first episode on comcast I may have never  seen this wonderful anime creation. This is one of the best drama anime serie's i have ever seen. This serie's is almost like Escaflwone but  very depressing as in There Is No Hope. I don't like to spoil reviews by revealing  things about the story so I only encourage readers to see it. This is such a powerful anime show that it starts to make you feel for the characters right off the bat. Some things in this story are hard to understand like why lalaru acts the way she does evan after act's of good she holds the same face only smiling here and there, and why shu will stop a nothing to protect her, he is so concentrated on protecting her that he doesn't think  a lot about  his parent's or sister but he makes you love and respect him for his strength and dedication. Even tho this is a depressing story Shu brings a little hope back when it seems to be completley gone. Now and Then Here and There leaves a very strong memory in your mind it makes you appriciate life and see that torcher seems worse than death. Even tho this is a animated show it shows what a lot of children in the world suffer and to see a child this brave and strong go threw this and still keep the will to survive will inspire all .viewers",1097798400,4,1394,4.163568773234201
1664969,5,B00005TRZ6,"WOW, this whole series took me completely by surprised. I was not at all ready to be bombarded with so much violence and sadness. The first set of episodes practically ruined my night and I could not get over it (hard to believe that a ""cartoon"" can effect you so much).
The next night, I rented the rest of the series-glad I did. The whole story is just awesome. Even though the hardships and issues the children are facing are horrendous, it really gives you a picture of how children really suffer in a world without law.
Each character in this series is just amazing. You really feel for everyone of them, from the evil Hamdo to the little boy, Boo. Each situation and background just really hits home.
Shu's pureness and good heart really touched me. Kabuca's (don't know if I spelled that right) horrible situation where he is forced to murder innocent people just broke my heart. Every character was portrayed and drawn magnficantly. The story is very well written.
This anime is for someone who is looking to be challenged mentally and emotionally. Be prepared to see terrible images of little children suffering and people being faced with brutal predicaments. Yet, to some people this is real life. I believe it is good to know that bad things do happen, however a strong, determined heart like the main character Shu to change one world's terrible dilemma.
Highly recommend to anyone who loves anime and also to those who love to experience an astounding drama.",1035504000,,1472,4.7315175097276265
1664970,5,B00005TRZ6,"I had just rented Now and Then, Here and There: Discord and Doom at a local Blockbuster the other day, I was very impressed. This anime was brought to America by U.S. Manga, and was originally done by AIC and Pioneer. It starts with a boy named Shu who meets a girl named LaLa-Ru and they get taken into another dimension where LaLa-Ru is wanted for a pendant she possess. She hands the pendant to Shu but Shu loses it in a fight between himself and a solider named Kabuca. The King, Homda wants the pendant to minapulate their low water supply. They are all on a huge ship called, Hellywood I believe, they are also fighting in a deadly war. The King and Lady Abelia have kidnapped many children age depending to fight as soliders and once they win the war they can go home, basically! It's a really good anime, and trust me I've seen many anime, one of the only anime's that come close to being this good is Martian Successor Nadesico, Evangelion is alright!",1032134400,2,960,4.398876404494382
1664971,5,B00005TRZ6,"This is a GREAT anime. I admit that I was at first discouraged by the very simple and somewhat goofy looking character designs (what can I say, I like pretty things). Even more so when I read a review about it that was far from encouraging. my, how misleading first impressions can be. This show touched me deeply. The characters have so much emotion and life that they feel real to you. The situations that these people are in are enough to make wanna jump in and save them yourself. The Story is about a very cheerful and optimistic boy named ""Shu"". He accidently gets transported to a mysterious world while trying to save a new friend. There he gets mixed up in the crazy problems of this warring world and is subjected to intense torture. This show greatly focuses on the use of severe physical abuse to train the soldiers fighting in this world, most of them still mere children. The leader of them all is a blubbering, crazy king, who I find to be one of the most interesting anime characters I've ever seen. The background art and use of color and lighting is absolutely breathtaking as well. This is a series that will never leave you bored or feel as if it's too long. It is a show definately worth puchasing.",1023667200,5,1219,4.446428571428571
1664972,5,B00005TRZ6,"This is one of the best anime series or movies that I have ever seen. Although it is set in a fantastic setting, there is a level of realism rarely encountered in most ""realistic movies"". It is dark, but at the same time well paced and entertaining. It shows suffering and hardship without sentimentality and tear-jerking. There is at the same time a Peter-Pan - ish quality to the story of children doing battles, and at the same time the emotions and motivations of the children are complex and real - this movie portrays real children better than most movies I've seen, which tend to make children either too mature or too immature for their age. In fact the most immature person in this movie is Hamdo, the king - a person of no nobility whatsoever. Hardship brings out the best in people sometimes - there is a certain nobility and solemnity to the child soldiers that is a product of the environment they are in and the pressure put upon them.",1021852800,2,949,4.523255813953488
1664973,5,B00005TRZ6,"Now and Then, Here and There is grim, brutal, powerful and beautiful all at once.  From what I understand it's loosely based on a documentary about child soldiers in Africa that the director saw, the violence in this series isn't disturbing because of it's gorey nature as in more typical anime, but in that the acts of violence ring with a disturbing note of truth and reality.  Despite this however, the protagonist Shu, is so noble and optimistic that there's always a glimmer of hope through all the darkness, and you never hit rock bottom while watching. Some people may not be able to stomach it, but if you're not sqeamish it's a very rewarding series.",1019347200,,659,4.672413793103448
1664974,4,B00005TRZ6,"This will be the simplest review I have ever written...Nothing new is done with this show, but all the old tricks are pulled off with class and elegance.  Definitely worth a look!",1018051200,,179,4.59375
7954501,5,B00005TRZ6,"A dark anime but one of the best iv'e ever seen. Not a lot of people know about it but it's great. It has murder, rape, children soldiers and war in it. The characters are good and you really feel for them. Get the DVDs. I like the extras on the dvd that has the sketches of the characters and detailed sketches of the locations and buildings.",1526342400,,343,4.134328358208955
7954502,1,B00005TRZ6,"Gross Gauche mean spirited, harsh, nihilistic, bitter, and cruel for the sake of being cruel. Now And Then Here And There is probably the most bitter, cruel, meanspirited, and stupid show I've ever seen.

But the sad thing is, for the first ten episodes I thought this was going to turn out okay. It appeared to be an anime that was handling the topics of war in a nuanced and intelligent way.

Then episode 11 happened and it totally undermined itself for the sake of pushing a theme at the expense of a main character. I got more invested in Sara Ringwalt as a character than any other character in this show because what she went through, well it was far too much like what people in our own world go through. Plenty of Anime play rape for comedy and titillation. NATHAT doesn't, it plays it for the horrifying, disgusting, selfish, inhuman act it is. It's probably the most realistic portrayal of a victim of rape I've ever seen in an anime or live action film.

Sadly, it drains away all the goodwill it built up for itself with the way it ended her story. Furthermore w/o spoiling it. If you know anyone who's gone through something like what Sara went through? You're going to be made VERY angry. I'd compare the to making a story where Jaycee Dugard chose to stay behind with Nancy Garrido after Phillip Garrido died.

It reminds me a lot of something Mel Brooks said about ""Life Is Beautiful' a similar movie that tried and failed in execution to find hope in a dark setting.

""The message of the movie seemed to be 'people can get over anything if they're optimistic enough'. No. They can't, they can't 'get over' a concentration camp.""

(spoilers for the ending below)

Thats not even mentioning how the message of hope ultimately rings hollow when the human race in Hellywood is facing literal extinction. What hope? Even if the evil warlord is dead, there's literally no tomorrow for this world. even assuming that things turn out alright for humanity. That civilization does rebuild itself, and people do learn to start being human again. These people, including Sara will probably be killed in a few generations by the literal end of their world due to their sun being a red giant that could go supernova any day now. The message 'everything will turn out all right' doesn't really resonate when things are destined to go wrong and humanity is destined to die out in that world. Everyone in that world which could VERY WELL be our own. And if it is our own, then the message isn't true at all because humanity is destined to destroy and rape itself into oblivion before then. And Shuus whole message of hope doesn't amount to anything because he didn't accomplish or change anything for the human race long term.

That's not an optimistic ending. That's horrifying and morally disgusting.",1515974400,,2803,4.648484848484848
7954503,5,B00005TRZ6,"I cannot praise this series enough.  As many others have said, this show is not for the faint of heart--painful moments are dragged out so the viewer can experience them in real time, some shots lingering just a bit too long to allow them enough time to truly understand the weight of the decisions being made throughout the course of the show.  My favorite part of this series is its fearlessness, whether that's relating to its depiction of wartime atrocities, the loss of innocence, and sexual/physical assault.  It's unafraid to portray these topics with a relentless fervor, punctuated heavily with long silences.  I truly believe this to be a masterpiece of the medium.  The animation is dynamic, possessing a dated charm that makes it look older than it is while still appearing timeless in its expressiveness and fluidity.  The designs, while simple, are iconic and easily identifiable.

Admittedly, I haven't watched this show in Japanese--I admit that the dub can be a bit hammy at times, but for the time (2002) I believe it to be quite competent.  I like Abelia's smoldering anger and Hamdo's over-the-top foppishness.  The way he in particular navigates around certain lip-sync issues that run rampant in anime dubbing is interesting to watch.  There are many times where he seamlessly blends long lines together with haggard breaths and angry stuttering, something that's incredibly difficult to do, given that actors must dub to picture as exactly as they can.  I also believe that Dan Green's performance as Nabuca is something that shouldn't be missed.  While his voice is a bit too old for the character, I adore the subtlety in his delivery.  He's a talented man, and Nabuca is easily one of my favorite anime characters because of his work.

Watch this show.  Keep your tissues handy.",1493596800,,1804,4.966666666666667
7954504,5,B00005TRZ6,So depressing but good. Please don't let your kids watch it though.,1477440000,,67,4.666666666666667
7954505,5,B00005TRZ6,"It's one the most emotional and cathartic experiences in the anime world. I never once imagined how a show so visceral in its depiction of fear, hopelessness, despair and hatred could express such a beautiful and timeless message.

The anti-war, ""this is the human condition"" message is as blatant as it gets, and yet, it feels as though the show never preaches that the human race is a failure, or that it should not exist, quite the contrary, ""Now and Then, Here and There"" chooses to exalt and celebrate life.

It is one of the darkest pieces of art you will see on the medium, but at the same time, the one with the most optimistic message. 10 out of 10, as far as I'm concerned.",1447977600,2,683,4.412698412698413
7954506,5,B00005TRZ6,"This series borrows plot lines from Miyazaki's Castle in the Sky: the girl with an all-powerful pendant, a mad-man needing the girl and her pendant to work his flying doomsday fortress, and a boisterous boy flung into the middle of all this because he dared to help the girl.  But that's where the comparison ends, for while this movie borrows plot lines from Castle in the Sky, it centers itself on the horrors of war.

Be warned.  This is no kid's movie.  The film treats without mercy the horrors of child soldiering, rape, murder, genocide, and the madness of war, and though viewing this was tough for me at times, it taught me much about its main subjects.

Though I found the main character Shu downright irritating in the beginning, I still could not fail to connect with him as the film progressed.  The only character that I thought was a little flat at times was the mad King Hamdo's do-everything commanding officer, Abelia.  But even here, you can still see some of her motivation in the few lines she's allowed to reveal her twisted devotion to King Hamdo.

The dynamics between the boy soldiers and Sara and Shu, is meticulously crafted and very believable.  It is agonizing to see how desperately Nabuca hangs on to the lie of going home one day, or how his boyhood friend has become a madman himself.  It is in the agony of these relationships that the movie happens.

So while the movie might have taken a plot closely resembling Castle in the Sky, its portrayal of its characters and its careful portrayal of what we read in newspapers but never actually connect to, that makes this series worthwhile, even if it is at times painful.",1221350400,,1652,4.623287671232877
7954507,4,B00005TRZ6,"Not for the squeamish, this anime series starts with the miraculous capture of the teenaged protagonist, Shu, by futuristic machines apparently seeking a mysterious girl, Lala-Ru, who had already captured Shu's attention.  Lala-Ru is sought because of a mysterious power she is rumored to possess: the ability to produce water from a pendant she wears.

The setting shifts to a desert world in which systematic brutality is the way of life in the new place Shu has arrived.  Many elements of this new world are identical to those common to war-torn regions today, such as kidnapped children made into soldiers; genocide; mass disease and starvation; rape, torture and murder; rule by warlord; and barbarism (i.e., identify self with tribe while designating all nonmembers nonhuman, all under absolute autocratic rule).  In this place Shu soon meets a girl, Sarah, that superficially resembles Lala-Ru in some ways.

Although the story doesn't dwell on the visuals of the brutal life Shu now endures, it is extremely unsuited for younger children and should be watched and discussed with any older teenagers you think able to profit from such a story.  Prescreening is strongly recommended.

I have seen only the subtitled Japanese original and do not know whether any of the violence against children has been edited out.  Be warned: late in this series there are events critical to the plot that cannot have been removed that are unavoidably graphic and portray the violent death of several children.

I recommend this anime because the vast majority of the story revolves around credible characters responding to realistic challenges in self-consistent ways.  Moral and personal questions abound, and each person struggles to make sense of life according to what they know and believe.  Although Lala-Ru's miraculous abilities are an occasional part of the story they rarely touch on the kinds of questions that the characters face most of the time.  Of particular note is that none of the characters espouses any specific religion, yet it is clear that the differing views on the value of life as well as the definition of who is human is drawn largely from uncritical acceptance of what the person has been taught.  Shu's cultural matrix is very different from almost everyone he encounters at first, yet he eventually finds a kindred soul who has arrived at the same values he shares even though her beliefs were drawn from great suffering.

The resolution is heartrending yet ultimately hopeful.  Each character reaches a believable conclusion with several surprises, both good and bad.",1205366400,,2592,5.152744630071599
7954508,5,B00005TRZ6,"I can't really add too much to the great reviews already written for this series except a few things:

1) If you watch this series English Dubbed, you won't enjoy it as much. The actors do a good enough job (which in itself is unusual in an anime show), but the ages aren't correct - hearing college-aged voices coming out of the mouths of adolescents really ruins the setting, at least for me. And while the evil Hando is clearly insane in Japanese, he just sounds too over the top in English - like a video game villain or something.

2) The price for each volume is so low for used copies (in some cases NEW), that any anime lover NEEDS to get these volumes now. I think the series is that good.

3) While watching this first volume, I felt some deja vu during the second episode - an usurper leader invading countries ""for their own good"", stealing their valuable liquid (water), becomes so hated that he starts to lose his mind - oh, and quelches human rights and tortures his enemies, too. Isn't there another leader who rose to power through questionable means, invaded a country ""for their own good"" and stole their valuable liquid (oil), became unbelievably hated, quelches human rights and tortures his enemies?

Now whatever your political affiliation might be doesn't matter - I at first believed this to be another recent Japanese anime subtly (or not so much) using the west's actions as a plot device (it's very subtle in the Ishbala storyline in Full Metal Alchemist, for example - the military invading an ancient middle-eastern settlement, insulting their religious beliefs and customs, with dire results).

The big difference is that Now And Then, Here And There was made in 1999! Debuted in U.S. in 2002) This startled me because I was amazed by just how NOT-subtle they were in introducing Hamda that I was thinking they may have really turned off right wing anime fans (there's are a few). This reminded me of the old old book called ""Futility"" by Morgan Robertson - about the 'unsinkable' ship called Titan. It came out about 15 years before the Titanic's maiden voyage.

But don't worry - by the time you get to the second volume (Flight And Fall), you'll be completely immersed in Lala Ru's world and Shu's problems in it. It's an amazing journey with gorgeous animation (once in a while the animation looks a bit ugly, like an afterschool 30-min cartoon but that's rare) - but like I said, other reviewers described the virties of this series much better than I could...

7954509,5,B00005TRZ6,"Wow... What a wonderful little anime we have here! It's surprising it's not more popular than it is. True, the animation style is a little more simplistic than your typical anime, but it has its unique charm that strengthens the anime rather than mitigates.

This is quite the depressing anime. You watch different characters going through horrible situations, such as torture, murdering, rape (although, it's done tastefully. It's not a total gorefest or anything, but it suggests and shows enough for the viewer to get the point)... All the characters are struggling to survive, each with the glimmer of hope of better things to come, including the protagonists, antagonists, and all the characters in the blurry line in-between.

The characters are each pushed further and further onto the brink of sanity, and you'll have to wonder what their motivations are. Why is Shu always so blindly optimistic? Why is Lala Ru so cold and detached? Why is Hamdo a total psycho and why is Abelia so loyal to him? Not all questions are answered, leaving the viewer to wonder about some of the characters past lives that influence their present decisions - which is a good thing, in my opinion.

Character development is very well done and it's sad seeing some of those characters start to fall apart emotionally and beaten up physically, but the anime leaves you with an important lesson at the end - something you'll need to watch for yourself.

This is the first of three volumes, though, and contains 5 episodes. It starts off well - introducing you to the most important characters. It has its funny, shocking, and disturbing moments, and it quickly introduces you to the conflict. It's fast-paced, but not too fast where all the characters are lost in the action. You might want to get all three volumes simultaneously because you'll want to see the other two volumes after finishing this one.",1158883200,2,1889,4.89375
7954510,5,B00005TRZ6,"I thought I'd give this series a spin since I'd heard it was good. The story is basically about a boy named Shu who gets transported to a war ravaged world where the twisted king Hamdo is searching for a magic pendant. The first thing I noticed was the fantastic music and fast pacing. This show is exciting every step of the way. The character designs are a little simple but the animation on a whole is excellent.

The main character Shu has the strongest willpower and emotional stability I've ever seen in any character. Can ANYTHING break this kid? The only thing the viewer has to depend on is Shu who never seems to lose hope in the face of horrible situations and bleak odds. The show contains torture and training of children to kill in battle, so I wouldn't recommend it for the weak of heart. This show will bring your mood down like nothing else.",1114128000,,858,4.430379746835443
