8447234,5,B0028K3HI2,"Having already visited Costa Rica on our own, we had many pleasant memories while watching this DVD. We wish we had seen it before we went, since Barry & Corinne have a knack for finding unique adventures during their travels, while at the same time covering all the basics. Their personal, conversational style makes it seem like we're traveling with friends.",1246320000,2,360,4.918032786885246
