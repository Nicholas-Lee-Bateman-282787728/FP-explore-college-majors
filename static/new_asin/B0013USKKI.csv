8253014,1,B0013USKKI,Very disappointed in the quality of this video.  The film does no justice to the area. It seems out of focus and 60s quality.  It's like a student was narrating this.  I'm very disappointed in this DVD.  It definitely needs updated before being sold again.  I feel like I'm watching and old filmstrip,1406851200,2,300,4.584905660377358
8253015,5,B0013USKKI,This is an excellent DVD and goes well with Part Two.  We kayak the lakes in the ADK's and watch these DVD's before we go so that we know what we will be seeing during our trip!,1392508800,,177,3.7837837837837838
