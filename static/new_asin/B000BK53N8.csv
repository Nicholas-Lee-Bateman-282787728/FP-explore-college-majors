Buena lectura musical de Philippe Jordan al mando de los cuerpos estables de la pera de Viena, una vez ms, flamantes.

La produccin de Andrei Serban, ambientada en los aos 20, de hermosa plasticidad, est llena de ideas renovadoras de la obra, aplicadas con gran inteligencia, que demuestran conocimiento profundo de la misma. Esta es una reinterpretacin del 'Werther' que conserva la ms pura esencia de la obra, y que nadie debera perderse.

Se completa el producto con un interesante documental sobre el baile de gala de apertura de la temporada, con lvarez y Garanca cantando el do de la zarzuela 'El do de la Africana'.",1139011200,6,836,4.964285714285714
8087590,3,B000BK53N8,"The singing and acting is great, but this Charlotte is a bit too far from the original character. She's much too flirty and responsive to Werther's advances (she almost kissed him in Act 1 and kissed him twice in Act 3, although the first time forced by him). Overall she looks more like a smart and independent woman who would live her own life than a traditional girl who values duty over freedom. I guess if you see the story and characters as independent from Goethe's novel, this production is good in its own way. But I personally prefer adaptions to be faithful to the original work, so I like Jonas Kaufmann and Sophie Koch's Werther better. Sophie Koch perfectly portrayed a maternal and tender woman who tried hard to suppress her feelings to fulfill her duty. I still like Elina Garanca though. She's an excellent singer.

Also, some scenes are weird, like in Act 3 why did Charlotte show the guns to Werther? She should have sensed from Werther's letters that he had suicidal thoughts. And in Act 4 Albert just watched Charlotte and Werther the whole time...",1418601600,3,1070,4.661375661375661

8087592,5,B000BK53N8,"The stage director Andrei erban is an outstanding genius!  For a stage director, it is easy to see how singers should act on stage as composer generally write how it should be on music score. Problem is how to choreograph  singers not described on the score of a certain part.  erban put Albert on the stage on the final act, where music score does not even mention Albert's name. Albert knows that Werther is in love with his wife. When Werther came to  borrow his handgun for a long trip, and then his wife follows him totally agitated, it is obvious that Albert should be very much concerned about what could happen between his wife and Werther. The presence of Albert on stage on the last act makes such a great impact to audience.  No other productions come even near this level. In some other part, he put Charotte's sister, Sophie on stage where she is not expected to be there. Wow! Andrei erban is a psychoanalyst!  Being an opera stage director myself, I have a great respect in Andrei erban. I should add that singers, conductor and orchestra are also doing remarkably well. It will be very difficult for any stage director to do better than this production. T.K.OHSKA",1369785600,,1179,4.59047619047619
8087593,2,B000BK53N8,"POORLY ACTED AND SUNG IN A RATHER SILLY AND AMATEURISH PRODUCTION AND CHANGE OF VENUE. ADDING NOTHING TO, IF NOT DETRACTING FROM. AN ALREADY SLOW MOVING PLOT.",1357948800,4,158,4.888888888888889
8087594,5,B000BK53N8,"I am possibly too late to add my thoughts about this production of Werther; but I have only just seen it.  However, I cannot resist.  It seems that there is general agreement about the stellar cast, so I will not go into that aspect.

Whenever there is a production wherein the director puts a different interpretation, there is usually a chorus of ""Eurotrash"" or at best complaints that the wishes of the composer and librettist are not being followed.  But who really knows what these wishes might have been?  When the operas were written, the originators were part of their times and wrote according to their cultural influence.  But I believe that profound works of art deal with the human condition and leave sufficient ambiguity to allow for reinterpretation as society changes.  Shakespeare's plays are a prime example of that.  Gilbert and Sullivan operettas suffered and seemed anachronistic as long as the D'Oyly Carte company held the copyright and refused to allow updated interpretations.

Werther needed to be updated.  Goethe saw him as a great romantic hero; and many impressionable young men followed the example.  In our culture, and in this production as well as the Weigl one, he is certainly not.  A very powerful force on a person is a death-bed promise.  Charlotte promised her dying mother that she would marry Albert; and despite her ""coup de foudre"" for Werther, she believed that she had to go through with the marriage.  Therein lies her tragedy.  Werther certainly added to that.  Not to put too fine a point on it, he is a stalker, a manipulative abuser.  And all of his actions and music underline that.  He would not accept that Charlotte was married to someone else and hence out of reach.  Even after he went away he plied her with importunate self-centred letters culminating with suicidal threats.  At the end he even wrote asking for the pistols instead of quietly doing away with himself.  And the end of the opera also hints at the end of Charlotte as well.  Had Albert not been such a cold callous person (his treatment of Charlotte at the end of Act III is abominable), Charlotte would have been able to hold Werther off -- or not, considering the number of murder/suicides perpetrated by stalkers.

To conclude:  Great operas are not cast in stone.  At the very least, why bother to go if all productions would be alike?  But like all great works of art, great operas can be enhanced by different interpretations.  Instead of carping, complaining, and dismissing with insulting phrases like ""Eurotrash"", perhaps it would be more profitable to ask what the director has in mind, and why.  It would certainly make all theatre-going considerably more interesting.

8087595,5,B000BK53N8,"Where ""Werther"" is concerned, there's not much competition in DVD format--only the heavily cut and lip-synched 1985 Petr Weigl film, which is still worth checking out for Brigitte Fassbaender's performance but not for much else.  All the more reason to be grateful, then, that this 2005 production does not break the spell that seems to have guaranteed good fortune to virtually all the recorded versions of Massenet's most radical and adventuresome opera in both LP and CD formats (my personal favorites: von Stade and Carreras under Colin Davis, and Kasarova and Vargas under Jurowski).  The musical values in this DVD set are quite high, with sensitive direction from the podium (Philippe Jordan) and a seamlessly stellar cast--there's not a weak link in the ensemble.  Andrei Serban's staging and direction are perhaps not for all markets--this production moves the drama from Goethe's late eighteenth-century setting to the 1950's--but, for the life of me, if there were ever an opera that cried out for and could actually thrive on imaginative updating, it is surely ""Werther."" Vincent Patterson's recent updating of Massenet's signature opera, ""Manon,"" which views the heroine's career through the lens of various Hollywood stars (Audrey Hebburn, Elizabeth Taylor, Marilyn Monroe, Ingrid Bergman), has received considerable acclaim (see the amazon.com reviews of the DVD); but Serban's vision engages the core elements of the drama in ""Werther"" far better than Patterson's treatment of ""Manon.""  By comparison, Patterson's ""Manon"" seems merely clever.  Serban's ""Werther"" is disturbing and profoundly moving, because it meticulously drives home the resemblance between the turmoil registered in the original setting and the soul-killing social and domestic proprieties of '50s-era middle-class culture.  While it may be a cliche to think of the 1950s in those terms, this production makes them painfully fresh and real and gives edgy resonance to Massenet's psychologically asute music.  The center of gravity does shift, however, but I think this is for the better. In Serban's production, the central character is clearly Charlotte, and the pivot of the drama turns on her (and, in Serban's staging, also Sophie's) unwillingness to acknowledge or act on the true nature of her desire until far too late.  As a result, both Werther and Sophie also emerge as more complicated and far less sentimental figures than traditional stagings would allow: here Werther's instability and delusional fugues register powerfully, as does Sophie's painful and frustrated passage into adulthood.  In a word, Serban's production does for ""Werther"" what Douglas Sirk did for filmic melodrama in the 1950s (think: ""All That Heaven Allows,"" not to mention Todd Haynes' 2002 remake, ""Far from Heaven"").  Marcelo Alvarez captures the danger in Werther with powerful intensity; Elina Garanca's Charlotte is a major incarnation, especially riveting in the harrowing final act.  If you love ""Werther,"" you must see this.",1230595200,15,3004,5.48051948051948
8087596,4,B000BK53N8,"Why do directors have to detract from operas by forcing the viewer to watch their ego (which they call creativity)? The singing, acting, and orchestra are very good. So is the opera (one of Massenet.s most popular). But the scenery and the shift of time to the 1950s make it seem silly. As for the scenery, the giant tree that is the theme in all four acts is fine for act 1 (the garden) and act II (the town square, but is rather silly as the wall of the sitting room in act III and is totally ridiculous in Act IV where Werther's death bed in his bedroom is under this tree. Changing the time to the 1950s makes the plot unbeleavable. Girls of the 1950s simply didn't refused the man they loved to marry the man their late mother had wanted them to marry.",1202688000,10,757,4.227586206896552
8087597,5,B000BK53N8,"Like the previous reviewer, I had never seen any other production of Werther to spoil my enjoyment of this one.  I thought it was wonderful!  The music was powerful.  The parts of Werther and Charlotte were sung beautifully and passionately by both Marcelo Alvarez and Elina Garanca. The acting was perfect.  All the singers were good.

I was sort of surprised to see the 50s setting and costumes, but this is a timeless story, so...what does it matter?  The staging with the gigantic tree was quite cleverly done, I thought.  The changing colors of the leaves showed the passage of time.  It was odd to have Charlotte's living space appear beneath the tree in Act III, but this is opera.  By Act IV, the tree looked like a monstrous spider, and there lay Werther, bullet hole to the chest, dripping with blood.  It took the entire act for him to die!  With Albert lurking in the background and Charlotte mashing herself into Werther's bloody body...weird?  Yes.  Opera?  Yes.  I loved it!",1192492800,14,989,4.701754385964913
8087598,5,B000BK53N8,"And that's what director wanted to achieve I believe. I have never seen any other production of this opera, so I do not suffer any problems to take it along with the music. Singing on the leading parts is great and the rest are fairely good as well. It is disturbing, but I guess that's how it was supposed to be at the time it was written by Goette. That time was way more sencible and inocent, so the turns of director are justified.

As for the bed scene, the wound in this production is not to the head, but

a confused one to the stomach so there's no contradiction.

 I had a great time watching this and I will do it again and again.

Sometimes the opera reviews are reminding me of Islamic fundamentalit's

writings. Not to mention, I am a former opera singer with 10 years of carrer. Buy it if you enjoy the fact that the opera is not something left in the past with the THREE TENORS, there's plenty of great singers in this world and Alvarez is definetly one of the best.",1173225600,7,981,4.219251336898396
8087599,4,B000BK53N8,"I agree with the reviewer who calls this a 'questionable' production.  The characters were occasionally pushed beyond their character type.  For instance, Werther is extremely irritated with Sophie and her happy singing in Act 2, whereas Werther would never be so unkind.  And at the beginning of the opera, Sophie and Charlotte seem to be quite annoyed with one another, whereas Charlotte is supposed to be the loving nurturer of all the younger ones in the family. She comes off as neurotic and self-centered, and I'm pretty sure that is not how Massenet intended Charlotte to be protrayed.  Also, the fact that Albert seems to be present all during Act 4 is downright weird.

I thought both Alvarez and Garanca followed the direction carefully and for the most part, it did work, even if the director's ideas rubbed a bit against the music.  The chemistry between the two of them seemed real and it was easy to suffer along with Werther.  His singing was lovely and hers was too.  Garanca has a rich, low mezzo.  The Sophie sang very well also.  The Bailiff and the Albert were acceptable.

There was a strange cut in Act 1: the bit where Sophie encourages her father to keep his promise and go out with Johann and Schmidt - an odd little cut.

One more odd thing - in the last act, Werther and Charlotte don't just kiss - they are actually rolling around in the bed together.  That seems a bit weird since the man has a gushing hole in his head.

Since the singing is good, and it's the only commercial live production of the opera we can get so far, complete with nice subtitles, I recommend it buying it, as it is certainly one of the most lovely operas ever written.",1140566400,28,1673,4.533333333333333
