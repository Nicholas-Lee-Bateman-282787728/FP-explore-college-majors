3530951,5,B001DIK7OC,"I bought this disc for the movie, ""The Luck Of The Irish"".  Having never seen it before, I taped ""The Luck Of The Irish""  back in the 1980's on VHS and have been waiting for it to air on TV again or for it to come out on DVD.  Thirty years later, I finally found this DVD.  The entertaining story revolves around hard-boiled journalist Tyrone Power stumbling onto a leprechan portrayed by Cecil Kellaway, and unwittingly acquiring the leprechan's obligated services which change the direction of Power's life.  It's a bit of romantic fluff but with a message and many comedic touches.  Great fun.",1358380800,4,596,4.6826923076923075

3530953,5,B001DIK7OC,"I love the movie, I'll Never Forget You {1948}, I saw it as a young girl and it was just wonderful seeing it again after so many years. It got here quickly and in perfect shape. Good quality for the money.",1290470400,4,205,4.024390243902439
3530954,4,B001DIK7OC,"This review is partially in response to the other review for this
double feature...I did not notice any problems with the sound on
either film. For those who may find color and tints of interest,
The Luck Of The Irish can be watched in a tinted green version (during the Ireland sequences) or in the alternate black and white version. I'll Never Forget You begins in black and white and then is transformed into beautiful color when Tyrone Power is mysteriously sent back in time. I found these effects added to the enjoyment of the films.",1231718400,19,539,4.625
3530955,1,B001DIK7OC,"This 1948 version of the Luck of the Irish is a great movie. I have seen it before on TV. However, this double-sided version of two movies has terrible sound quality.  There is an echo with every word. It was pretty expensive for such poor quality.",1226880000,8,248,4.391304347826087
8293467,4,B001DIK7OC,"This is a really charming movie. Ann Baxter and Tyrone Power are at their best, showing why they deserved their star status. Ann Blythe and Mr. Power also hold everyone's interest with their fine acting in I'll Never Forget You.  FYI, this movie seems to be offered for over $900. A tad much, even for 2 good movies. I saw it on eBay for around $21, I believe. Perhaps the seller might come down a bit.",1503532800,,402,4.2894736842105265
