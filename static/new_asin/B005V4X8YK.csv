8487351,5,B005V4X8YK,Bought this as a Christmas gift and I'm hoping I can borrow it to look at.  It should be very interesting.,1386201600,,106,4.0476190476190474
8487352,4,B005V4X8YK,"This is not ""hardcore"" history - i.e., basic chronology replete with precise dates, exact places, well documented events, recorded names of participants, verifiable outcomes, and precise ramifications.  Rather, it's a combination of actual history, literary history, cultural history and climatological history.  The series starts by taking events chronicled in the Bible and fleshing them out with the kinds of disastrous events that have been observed to have occurred since historical records were kept.  This results in seeming irrelevancies being thrown in, such as the eruption of Vesuvius which destroyed Pompeii; or modern day famines in parts of Africa and Asia; or tsunamis; or the locusts which nearly destroyed Mormon crops in 19th century Utah.  Clearly, none of these relate directly to anything in the Bible; they simply demonstrate the destructive capability of similar events chronicled in the Bible.

The first entry focuses primarily on Moses and the 10 Plagues of Egypt; and while it suggests verification of these events by Egyptian as well as Hebrew records, what it shows is how these 10 Plagues may have been brought about by natural occurrences that have been identified through modern science.  Clearly it's not traditional history for someone to identify, millennia after the fact, bacteria that might have turned the Nile red; no one can say for sure that that was indeed what happened because no trace was left behind.

With something like the story of Noah's Ark, however, there are sedimentary traces showing an ancient flooding of the Black Sea to a depth of 500 feet.  Of course, that doesn't mean the Black Sea flood corresponds to the events depicted in the Bible - or in the various other ""flood myths"" found in ancient writings, such as the Babylonian tale of Gilgamesh.  Nor does the apparent evidence that the ancient city of Jericho was destroyed by an earthquake necessarily correspond to the Biblical story of Joshua.  Nor does the modern discovery of hydro-carbon traces around the Dead Sea necessarily confirm the biblical story of Sodom and Gomorrah.  But, then, it's not the intent of this series to prove beyond a doubt that these things actually happened or to provide definitive explanations of how they happened; only to propose possible hypotheses for these biblical stories.  And while that's not ""history"" as such, it's most definitely the basis of history since virtually everything in the past began with someone somewhere sometime saying something happened; historians - to include anthropologists, geologists, climatologists - take it from there and follow the trail wherever it leads.  It may lead nowhere; or it may result in a fixed entry in the historical record.  Most ""ancient history"" has been written by modern scholars based on research from a number of disciplines.

The second entry strays pretty far from the path of history.  By focusing exclusively on the persons associated with biblical events, it wanders into the realm of pure speculation, even though some of the events surrounding these persons are historical fact - such as the Babylonian Captivity, which features Ezekiel; the on-going feud between the Jews and Philistines, featuring Samson; the issue of child sacrifice, highlighted by Abraham in particular.  But the stories of Job and Jonah are completely outside the scope of established history, other than the mention of the Assyrian city of Nineveh in the Jonah and the Whale story.

The entry regarding the Book of Revelation presents a different kind of history: literary history.  It shows possible antecedents to this particular book of the Bible, as well as events contemporary to the book's author which may have inspired his writing - even though the actual author has never been definitively identified.

One has to bear in mind that The History Channel is as much about entertainment as history per se.  The degree of accuracy of the material presented may vary; but the packaging is consistently excellent - photography, graphics, archival material, commentary, editing.  Unfortunately, making history commercially viable necessarily squeezes out the innate grayness of rigid scientific discipline.",1343779200,7,4195,5.286144578313253
8487353,1,B005V4X8YK,"If this is history, then so is the story of Mohammed's flight from Mecca to Jerusalem (and back!) on a flying horse;  the Mormons' tale of how Jesus visited America; and the Native American belief that the craters on the moon were formed by three frog sisters.  We could go on but I think you get the point.  ""History"" should contain, or at least be consistent with, some kind of verifiable data; to merely accept everything anyone says happened at some point in the past as ""history"" is to devalue the term.",1333324800,,508,4.5
