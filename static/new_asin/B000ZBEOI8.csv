This was a wild,fun,crazy ride of a movie! The acting was great from most of the cast ( a little weak from the kids in it )and the production values were suprisingly good. The special effects were over the top excellent for an independent movie and the editing and music was also solid. Overall this was a really good flick and I would recomend it to anyone that gets into independent horror. Some people have said it was only worth one star and all I have to say to that is you better just stick with your big budget duds and leave this for the down and dirty horror buffs. Kurtzman does it again!",1200355200,22,739,4.323741007194244
3039149,1,B000ZBEOI8,"When I saw the endorsement on the cover from Fangoria saying what a great film this is I thought for sure this would be a sure fire splatter classic.  Well I'll tell ya people, never ...EVER judge a DVD by it's cover cause this movie sucked stinky sweaty, open sored, herpie infested, itchy balls.  Just by the title alone you should know that this is simply just a wannabe rip off of ""28 Days Later"", but so much worse.  Instead of getting hordes of infected, you get one angry monster thingy & zombie birds.  I'd go into the plot of the movie, but there really isn't one other than a mad doctor experimenting on people with a ""rage virus"", so why bother right.  I suppose there could be more to the movie, but after they find the black guys head in a muppet zombie bird nest I just had to turn it off.  This movie was even too stupid for me & I love bad horror & almost never turn a movie off before finishing it.  I don't know about anyone else, but when I see something tagged as a new splatter classic I think good special effects; right?  Well, you're not gonna find it here.  You get some of the stupidest looking zombie birds ever put to film (I think the zombie birds in ""Zombie 3"" were more believable), say there's another movie it ripped off), & really horrible make up/special effects.  The acting is rediculous, the movie is really nothing but your average train wreck of a film.  Now had I watched this expecting it to be this bad it may've been okay just to laugh at, but by the way the cover makes it out to be the next big sleeper, splatter/cult horror flick I was just left being p!$$ed (can I say that?)that the people behind the movie would be so insulting as to make me believe that this is anything special.  Word to the wise, don't ever trust a DVD cover with a Fangoria endorsement, cause they're either BIG TIME sellouts, or they have really, REALLY awful taste in movies & have absolutely no business printing a monthly magazine anymore.  This whole movie is nothing but the very bottom of the barrel amatuer hour stuff, nothing to get excited about, & ABSOLUTELY NOT a ""classic"" in any way, shape, or form.

The Birdemic effects could have been better, but it would have lost some cheese value. Misty Mundae (listed as Erin Brown) was enjoyable .

Goofy semi spoof, semi serious offshoot of films like ""28 Days Later,"" with plenty of "" Re-animator"" overtones.

A scientist invents a ""Rage"" virus that turn humans in to blood thirsty mutated Zombie like creatures. Not only does it work wonders of mass meaty mutilation from it's human infected, but infects giant vultures who (somewhat hilariously) swoop down from the sky & attack an RV filled with twenty something's. What ensues is a funny fearful fight for survival, as they become infected their self's, one by one.

For you blood thirsty gory gore hounds out there, this is your main course of red rare meat by the piled plateful, quivering, shivering, glossy globs of gluttony gore . For the rest of you, just sit back & be bemused, & amused by the whole bloody spectacle!

3039158,4,B000ZBEOI8,"What can I say about this movie. I loved it, it has everything a B movie should have. Yes the acting sucks oh well. That is normal in these type films. It has plenty of gore and killings. I would have loved to see this movie in the drive in. There are these killer zombie birds, that I must admit look terribly fake. I didn't let that bother me I was busy watching the bird vomit acid all over this guys face and watched his face melt. That is what kind of movie this is. A gross you out, hope they don't notice the small flaws and just enjoy the gore type film. The budget was small, but it still pulled off a pretty decent movie with little money. The director should be given a bigger budget and freedom to make more films like this. I can't wait to see Robert Kurtzman become a great horror movie maestro. I have watched hundreads of low budget films and this one has to rate at the top. Please understand that I'm rating this movie compared to other low budger horror films. I know there are some of you out there that sit down and dissect these movies. This is a lose yourself entertaining type film that shouldn't be dissected. If you are looking for flaws there are millions. That to me is what makes these films great. It brings me back to the 80's when horror movies were just fun to watch. Now everyone expects them to more serious and for people who lack imagination.

3039162,1,B000ZBEOI8,"Okay, so in my stack of movies yet seen yet purchased somewhere along the line I came across a little film called THE RAGE, also known as ROBERT KURTZMAN'S THE RAGE. For those who don't know, Kurtzman is the K in the company KNB Effects. Along with Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger, the three made one of the best effects companies around. But Kurtzman for some reason (I've not heard this story yet) decided to break off and start his own film production company. Of all places, he located it near Crestline, Ohio. You can't get much further from Hollywood than that kids.

There are fans of Kurtzman out there who love the Wishmaster series of films he was responsible for having directed/created the first film. And his credits as an effects artist are pretty impressive as well. But this movie will not be one that lends itself to bragging rights over. In fact, this movie is so bad that I would recommend it for little more than either a brief laugh or one of those films you put on during a rowdy party where everyone is pretty much wasted and doesn't care about the movie but gets a laugh out of things they see while in a drunken stupor.

Andrew Divoff (who has a long list of great roles he's played in films from AIR FORCE ONE to the afore mentioned WISHMASTER) stars as a mad Russian scientist searching for...well for something. As the film begins we have no idea what that is. We just know he's in some remote backwoods lab where he's created a series of mutated humans that are covered with humongous boils that look all slimy. His latest creation jumps off escapes the table he is strapped down on, bites the good doctor and sets out on a rampage, filled with the Rage mutation the doctor has created.

Flash forward to an outdoor rave that somehow has enough money to pay professional band Mushroomhead to play (at the time they were considered up and coming). Two couples and a tag along friend are in the midst of getting wasted and the tag along is coaxing one couple into a three way. Isn't that how all raves end up?

The night before the escaped mutant had killed and eaten a parked couple having sex in a convertible and then later died. His corpse was eaten by vultures who have now taken on the rage mutating gene and been altered. Move on to nice Uncle Ben (horror genre star Reggie Bannister in a wasted role but with one of the best lines in the film that's sure to bring laughs to horror fans) and his niece and nephew, out for a fishing trip at the ole fishing hole their late father used to go to. When the niece doesn't return from taking a tinkle, Uncle Ben finds her being eaten by the birds who then spew forth some form of acid into his face that transforms him as well. Of course he then takes out the nephew. The vultures are the first of many poorly done special effects. The hand held ones aren't too bad but the CGI vultures will remind you of the bad CGI creatures you see every week on SyFy's latest killer croc/dinosaur/snake movies.

By this time the rowdy kids have awakened and are on the road in the motor home. Here comes the second worst special effect in the movie. As they drive we get to see a projected image of the RV moving through the windows that's out of focus, out of sync and down right stupid looking. After a fight in the RV between the once wasted yet now angelic girlfriend drawn into a three way the night before, they suddenly slam into Uncle Ben now in the middle of the road munching on someone.

When they get out to investigate, they have to contend first with the not quite dead Uncle Ben and then of course the raging vultures. These are some nasty critters as they rip through the windows, attempt to enter via the hatch on top and in general make themselves pretty darn pesky. Which leads to the next poor effect, the RV blowing up in what looks like some of the worst created CGI fire I've ever seen.

Skipping ahead, and yes I've already told you about a lot of the movie but in an attempt to save you the $1 or perhaps 50 cent price tag for the rental, not all of them survive as they trek through the woods but wouldn't you know that they end up back and the shack used by the good old mad scientist who actually died but came back, resurrected by the rage formula. He's found out about the vultures and discovered that their mutated genes aren't affected by his antidote. Now he must experiment on these teens (?) to find a new cure. And suddenly one of his ex-experiments is helping him and he's picked up a mutated dwarf as well!

You can watch the film if you want to know what happens. All I can tell you is that for a movie made by one of the top progenitors of effects in the last 30 years, this one has some of the crappiest effects I've seen. Not to mention one of the worst scripts with bad dialogue throughout. And some terrible acting. I guess I should have expected that as the main lead in the film, not-so-innocent-girlfriend Kat, identified in the credits as Erin Brown turned out to be B-movie bad girl and straight to video star Misty Mundae. I have yet to see her in anything where she did something that resembled acting.

Honestly I've watched Ed Wood films that were more entertaining. This one is truly bad and wavers along that fine line between a film that is just bad and so bad it's good. And not good as in a good movie but good as in this film is so over the top and bad that it's hilarious. With the exception of Bannister's one quote and another from Mundae delivered to the mutant midget concerning oompa loompas, this movie is worthless. I was sorry I spent the money on it. I've since passed it along to my son who I am sure will put it on and laugh the first time and then use it to demonstrate how bad a movie can be.

There is one good thing about this film. It should give someone out there the confidence to know that anyone can make a movie and that almost anyone could come up with something better. Let's just hope that they don't come up with THE RAGE 2.

On a final note there will be those who enjoy this film for one reason. They love gore. The film does contain tons of it. Everything from exploding heads to entrails to squirting wounds. Sadly even these aren't done better than most films. And if that's all you're interested in, hey enjoy.

3039165,5,B000ZBEOI8,"The Rage (2007) is what is known as a ""splatter"" movie. Lots of blood and guts and gore. This is not the same as a ""slasher"" movie. Slasher movies, while graphic, aren't as graphic as splatter movies. Good examples of slasher movies are the Halloween movies, the Friday The 13th movies, Happy Birthday To Me, Black Christmas, etc. Slasher movies usually involve a psycho stalker who kills his victims in various unique ways using different tools or gadgets each time. There usually is at least a fairly good plot and story. In contrast, a splatter movie shows an over-the-top amount of blood and gore and relies on showing the graphic mutilation and destruction of the human body. The emphasis is on showing a lot of gore throughout the movie. The plot is almost always extremely weak or laughable or nonexistent. Good examples of popular splatter movies are Night Of The Living Dead (1968), Dawn Of The Dead (1978), The Evil Dead (1981), Bad Taste (1987), and Braindead (1992). So, with this background and description of how a splatter movie is its own sub-genre of horror film and differs from the closely related slasher film, I will give my analysis of The Rage.

The plot is basically this: a mad scientist has set up a laboratory in the middle of the woods somewhere. He has created a ""rage"" virus that he wants to test on some innocent victims he has in captivity in his lab. When these people are injected with the virus, they turn into zombies/monsters. When they escape from the lab, vultures feed on their carcasses. But there's a problem - by feeding on the carcasses, the vultures have now contracted the virus and go into a ""rage"" themselves. They attack anybody who is in or near the woods. A group of young kids in a winnebago stumble across this mad scientist's laboratory in the woods and are fighting for their lives from the monsters inside the lab and the attacking vultures outside.

I found this movie to be one of the best splatter movies I've ever seen. You can't expect much from a splatter movie when it comes to a plot. You can't expect Academy Award-winning acting. All you can expect is a movie that lives up to the definition of ""splatter"" movie. I found this movie highly entertaining. It really kept my attention from start to finish. The pace of the movie is fast. Never a dull moment. I kid you not, I was laughing the whole time. Laughing counts for something. If I'm laughing the whole time, then the movie is doing its job of being very entertaining. Sometimes movies that have a silly plot, bad acting, and shocking graphic violence are the ones that are so entertaining that they get me laughing.

How is the acting in this movie? With the exception of a couple of actors who do an adequate job of acting, the acting is fair to poor. This alone got me laughing. What else got me laughing? The crazy people in Dr. V's lab! And the vultures! The vultures were the stars of the show, if you ask me. They were scary and funny at the same time. They are computer generated and don't look 100% ""real"" but I'm somebody who can see past that. I can't complain. What do you expect from a low budget B splatter movie?

This movie's music is excellent. It was composed by the gothic/Halloween band Midnight Syndicate. The music really fits the movie well. I own the soundtrack because it's good.

Overall, this is a good splatter movie. I realize that this type of movie won't sit well with everybody, so that's why I differentiated between what a splatter movie is and what a slasher movie is. If you like splatter movies, give this one a try. It's even better with pizza and beer.",1263254400,3,3612,4.567901234567901

I see from other reviews that some people really do like it. Fair enough, each to their own and all that, but everything about this film leaves me bored. Very weak 'story', desperate acting, gormless script, unconvincing gore. I had no interest in the characters and would have happily seen them all nuked after 30 minutes of this dross.

3039168,2,B000ZBEOI8,"The Rage (Robert Kurtzman, 2007)

Misty Mundae is in this movie. And if you find that reason enough to check it out, then by all means don't let me stop you. If you value anything else having to do with the wonderful world of film, however, you're setting yourself up for an hour and a half of disappointment. A ludicrous script, terrible gore effects, and a bunch of mangy-looking vultures do not a horror movie make. I'm not entirely sure, but this might actually be worse than Flu Bird Horror.

Plot: bunch of kids stumble into area where evil mutant vultures are transmitting nasty virus. That's pretty much it. There's some interpersonal stuff that's meant to inspire tension. There is, of course, a mad scientist in the middle of nowhere. And there's a cameo from Reggie Bannister, which is, of course, the best part of this.

All that said, The Rage is watchable, in a train-wreck sort of way; it's stupid and cheesy and kind of fun. And, of course, there's no denying the attraction of Ms. Mundae.

This little flick here is one I have been waiting to see quite some time. Like some films I wait a long time to hit dvd just to be let down, this one delivers. Much better then the trailers I had seen on it. Don't expect a big budget theater movie here. Expect a good freakin time. So much crazy stuff going on to keep you on your toes through out the movie, it's insane. If you want gore, there is heaps of it. The zombie vultures sounded dumb but when you catch them in action, it's quite interesting, very surprising in a good way, and brutal.

If you are familiar with Erin Brown, aka Misty Mundae, you are treated to seeing her in this flick. For many people, that alone is worth the price of admission.

I'd put this little flick on par with films like Re-animator and Dead Alive. If you enjoyed Re-animator, this one is sure to please. A great popcorn flick for a friday night to bring your buddies over and have a good time. Dont' forget the beer. A good film like this is always more fun with beer. Yes, the key word is fun. This film isn't about being perfect or pleasing critics, it's about fans of the genre having fun doing what they like best, making a film that they would want to see if it was them buying or renting it. The people who made it are one of us, not some suits behind a desk or someone trying to prove his technical movie making prowess. If you are looking for Hollywood and the next big blockbuster film, go see your local movie listings. If you want a freakin good time, then your bus ride stops here.

Just be sure you watch the uncut/unrated version. If you get the other version, you may not like it and are sure to miss tons of the fun in the movie. For 10 bucks, you can't beat that. Get it while it's still 10 bucks at Amazon. Buy a second film that is 15 bucks or more, and you won't get hit with a shipping charge either. You could have 2 great movies for about 25 bucks, if you choose the right movie for the seond one. ;)",1206144000,6,2047,4.148614609571789

A wonderfully fun homage to '80s splatterfests like RE-ANIMATOR and EVIL DEAD II, Kurtzman and company present an ersatz zombie film filled with gore, mutants and Harryhausen-esque monster vultures. The acting from the veteran actors outshines the newcomers, naturally, and star Divoff particularly owns every scene he's in. All this talk about ""bad CGI"" - what would you have preferred, picky ""fans""? The vultures transforming into cars? Would that have been better? The effects were as campy as they needed to be and fit in beautifully with the tone of the film. It's a loud, happy, outrageous and bloody party movie that never bores or pretends to be something it's not. It's wonderful to see a horror movie made for and by horror fans, rather than some tired sequel or remake churned out for a quick buck. Pick this up if you want a ""new"" '80s-style splatter movie. You'll love it.",1206144000,5,976,4.9573170731707314
3039181,1,B000ZBEOI8,"Well, what can I say, I had my hopes up for this one.  Robert Kurtzman was involved and I have always liked his work with KNB.  This however was not what I would expect from a special effects guru.  The first 10 - 15 minutes were pretty darn bloody and really kept my attention but when the movie switched to some CGI vultures, that's when the movie became absolutely ridiculous.

SOME SPOILERS IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPH!

This film is about a mad scientist that was creating a drug that would make people hate each other so that he could take over the world and at the beginning it had some Re-Animatoresque moments, but then it suddenly became an outdoor adventure.  The Rage spreads like a virus and if you are bitten you are infected.  The Rage gets outside, which is fine, except that some stupid CGI vultures spread the Rage.  Now if they had used 1 CGI vulture in 1 scene to make the Rage spread to the humans that would have been fine, but no, they had to be featured the rest of the movie!  BAD MOVE!  They are so poorly done that they are funny at first, but it just gets to be completely irritating.

This movie moved very quickly until the vultures appeared, then the film slowed to a crawl.  While I didn't fast forward I did check the running time on the box to see how much more of this dreck I would have to be subjected to.  Overall the effects are very extreme and look pretty cool but the damn birds!  UGH!  The pacing was good but what could have really been a good flick was quickly ruined.  Too bad, another wasted effort by Erin Brown (Misty Mundae), see her performance in Sick Girl if you want to see what she can really do.

A wasted cast and unfortunately some decent effects down the tubes by some really lame CGI.  Oh well, at least it was only $9.99.  I read the reviews and should have just taken it off of the pre-order list but I thought how bad could it be?  That BAD!",1206057600,2,1898,4.248603351955308
3039182,1,B000ZBEOI8,"When you hear about special FX guru Robert Kurtzman helming a movie, it's not too shocking to see the finished product lacking in so many different areas.  Being the director behind the fairly unmemorable horror films Wishmaster, and most recently Buried Alive, I(unlike some other reviewers) wasn't expecting very much... unfortunately I didn't even get that.  The Rage tells the story of a ""mad"" scientist who is out for vengeance on a world that refused to release his cure for cancer(by killing everyone... makes sense right?).  He creates a virus that turns any human infected with it into a bloodthirsty raging maniac, however he makes one minor miscalculation when it begins infecting vultures that have fed on the contaminated remains of the dead... now all living creatures can catch ""the rage.""  Enter a group of teens who spend their time popping Extacy, having threesomes, watching a band called Mushroomhead out in the woods, and being HORRIBLE actors, all before being attacked by the aforementioned rabid vultures... I guarantee you'll be begging for their deaths within 3 minutes of being introduced to them.  In fact, I'd argue that this may be the most obnoxious bunch of ""victims"" put on screen since, well... maybe ever?!  I mean this group is worse than a truckload of wheelchair ridden Franklins from the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre!  Now you might be wondering, ""who cares as long as they die slow and gruesome deaths.""  And you'd be right in that theory, but here's yet another major flaw this film suffers from... death by CGI!  For a special FX guru, Robert Kurtzman seems to have forgotten the cardinal rule of low-budget horror, if you can't afford it, keep it off screen(or completely out of the film).  Here the vultures are a laughable mess, created with the worst computer animation you're likely to ever see AND stupid looking sock puppets for the all-to-often close ups.  Oh and did I mention that they show up... A LOT.  But that's not it either, we also get computer generated flames, bus crashes, explosions, and even blood splatter effects... again, Robert you know better(at least you should)!  Even a guest appearence from Phantasm's own Reggie Bannister comes off flat and forced.  Underneath it all, The Rage does provide a few decent moments of authentic splattery goodness, but there are so many movies that do it better that it's hard to recommend anyone wasting there time with this instead.  Wow, what a bad movie, so bad that it could almost be good(almost!) because of the laughs provided when combined with friends and alcohol(lots of alcohol)... don't even think about trying it sober though!",1205712000,12,2648,4.986363636363636

3039185,1,B000ZBEOI8,"After reading mostly positive reviews from reputable horror websites, i ordered this online (i'm in Australia).  What a waste of money.  You gotta respect enthusiasm from Kurtzman and Co...but i wouldn't recommend this for more than a one-off rental etc .  I wasn't expecting Oscar worthy acting or dialogue, but some of the acting and lines are utterly terrible, and some of the camerawork very amatuer.  I felt like i was watching a Sci Fi production. The characters weren't interesting at all and the actors themselves weren't much better (sorry to say).  So that leaves us the gore and effects - the gore was for the most part lots of fun although for an unrated cut nowhere near as gory as i'd have expected, however the CG was really bad - esp the vultures and the 'forest' backgrounds used inside the RV. I grew up on 80's shlock and low budget films which i'm sure this is meant to be a homage to, but it just didn't cut the mustard for me.  You CAN have a low budget film with good actors and dialogue.  The only actors who even looked like they were having fun was veterans Bannister & Dividof - who chews up every scene he's in.  If it wasn't for him this would be a total loss for me.  Shame Kurtzman didn't have more of a budget as it'd be fun to see what he can do given more to work with - just next time find actors who can act and at the very least are fun to watch until they get picked off!

So just goes to prove you should never buy blind based on reviewers..",1204934400,4,1480,4.253571428571429
3039186,4,B000ZBEOI8,"Doctor Viktor Vasilienko (Andrew Divoff) is a brilliant scientist. He has discovered the cure for cancer. However, when he unveils his findings he is derided as a quack. Yes, those pharmaceutical companies would rather keep the money rolling in from their existing palliatives than see their profits dry up. Our disgruntled doctor decides that the only way to get even is to get mad. After years of experimentation on abducted humans, he is almost ready to unleash his new creation, the Rage Virus, on an unsuspecting world. No prizes for guessing that this virus turns its victims into blood-crazed mutants with an insatiable appetite for human flesh.

Thus far, Vasilienko has managed to keep his human experiments confined in his ramshackle laboratory in a remote area of the countryside. All that is about to change as the virus has crossed the species barrier. Mutant vultures soar above, waiting for their next victims. They see dinner in five young people: Kat (Erin Brown), Josh (Ryan Hooks), Pris (Sean Serino), Olivia (Rachel Scheer) and Jay (Anthony Clark).

Director, Robert Kurtzman, and his colleagues happily concede that in making `The Rage', they were not setting out to redefine the horror film. Rather, their aim was to make an entertaining movie. I think they've largely succeeded. Yes, some of the acting is a little dodgy from the peripheral players, and yes, some of the special effects are less than special (notably in some of the sequences with the vultures). However,  most of the visual effects are spectacularly good for a low-budget film. You want blood? They've got blood, and lots of it!

Andrew Divoff turns in an excellent performance as the mad doctor. The film's opening section sets the tone in grisly fashion. His low-grade Frankenstein laboratory hosts his latest blood-soaked victims who are already strapped in, unwilling and unready to go under the knife.

Leading lady, Erin Brown, is not known as a Scream Queen for nothing. In this film, possibly one of the loudest I've ever heard, she sounds quite hoarse at times as she and her pals send the decibel counter into orbit. As we all know, Erin Brown is also known as softcore icon, Misty Mundae, and, although her nudie film days are behind her, it is, perhaps, difficult for her to escape her past. There's one scene in `The Rage' where she's woken up after camping out with her friends after a rave. Some nearby men encourage her to lift up her top. She lifts it so far before pulling it back down and giving them the finger. Is this a thinly coded message: ""Ha! I don't do that any more, suckers!"" or am I reading too much into it?

As far as the DVD's bonus material goes, there's an epic `Making of' documentary that lasts almost as long as the feature itself. This has plenty of coverage of the special effects as well as the usual mutual backslapping inherent in these things. There are a lot of production and special effects stills and there's a director's commentary which rehashes a lot of what's already been said in the `Making of' documentary.

`The Rage' is very derivative and has nods to quite a few different films and actors. In one scene, Reggie Bannister's character mentions&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phantasm/dp/B000MV8ABS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phantasm</a>, a film in which he starred almost thirty years ago; the mad doctor has an eastern European accent a la Bela Lugosi; and, given this film's subject matter, there are obviously similarities with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Days-Later-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JMA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;and any number of zombie flicks.",1204675200,2,3749,5.301346801346801

From the creator of From Dusk Till Dawn and director of Wishmaster and Buried Alive comes The Rage.

A mad scientist's ""rage"" injection backfires when his latest specimen breaks free, kills him, then flees. After his third kill, he collapses, and vultures swarm to eat the carcass, thus ingesting the virus and infecting everyone they come in contact with.

A Winnebago full of friends encounter the birds, and the fight for their life begins. They stumble upon the mad scientist's lab, and find out that he's not dead, but is even more adamant on continuing his experiment.

What results is a horribly executed movie with a few decent gore scenes, and CGI birds that are straight bogus. The only plus of this feature was the presence of Erin Brown (aka Misty Mundae) who carries a lead role, but unfortunately, keeps her clothes on in this one.

If you'd rather see Erin how you always have, naked and naive, rent Chantal or Sick Girl, and then buy the newly re-edited 2-disc version of Vampire Strangler, which shows a much younger Misty, but has her only hardcore scenes to date.

This movie was even too stupid for me & I love bad horror & almost never turn a movie off before finishing it.  I don't know about anyone else, but when I see something tagged as a new splatter classic I think good special effects; right?  Well, you're not gonna find it here.  You get some of the stupidest looking zombie birds ever put to film (I think the zombie birds in ""Zombie 3"" were more believable), say there's another movie it ripped off), & really horrible make up/special effects.  The acting is rediculous, the movie is really nothing but your average train wreck of a film.  Now had I watched this expecting it to be this bad it may've been okay just to laugh at, but by the way the cover makes it out to be the next big sleeper, splatter/cult horror flick I was just left being p!$$ed (can I say that?)that the people behind the movie would be so insulting as to make me believe that this is anything special.  Word to the wise, don't ever trust a DVD cover with a Fangoria endorsement, cause they're either BIG TIME sellouts, or they have really, REALLY awful taste in movies & have absolutely no business printing a monthly magazine anymore.

3273659,1,B000ZBEOI8,"Okay, so in my stack of movies yet seen yet purchased somewhere along the line I came across a little film called THE RAGE, also known as ROBERT KURTZMAN'S THE RAGE. For those who don't know, Kurtzman is the K in the company KNB Effects. Along with Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger, the three made one of the best effects companies around. But Kurtzman for some reason (I've not heard this story yet) decided to break off and start his own film production company. Of all places, he located it near Crestline, Ohio. You can't get much further from Hollywood than that kids.

There are fans of Kurtzman out there who love the Wishmaster series of films he was responsible for having directed/created the first film. And his credits as an effects artist are pretty impressive as well. But this movie will not be one that lends itself to bragging rights over. In fact, this movie is so bad that I would recommend it for little more than either a brief laugh or one of those films you put on during a rowdy party where everyone is pretty much wasted and doesn't care about the movie but gets a laugh out of things they see while in a drunken stupor.

Andrew Divoff (who has a long list of great roles he's played in films from AIR FORCE ONE to the afore mentioned WISHMASTER) stars as a mad Russian scientist searching for...well for something. As the film begins we have no idea what that is. We just know he's in some remote backwoods lab where he's created a series of mutated humans that are covered with humongous boils that look all slimy. His latest creation jumps off escapes the table he is strapped down on, bites the good doctor and sets out on a rampage, filled with the Rage mutation the doctor has created.

Flash forward to an outdoor rave that somehow has enough money to pay professional band Mushroomhead to play (at the time they were considered up and coming). Two couples and a tag along friend are in the midst of getting wasted and the tag along is coaxing one couple into a three way. Isn't that how all raves end up?

The night before the escaped mutant had killed and eaten a parked couple having sex in a convertible and then later died. His corpse was eaten by vultures who have now taken on the rage mutating gene and been altered. Move on to nice Uncle Ben (horror genre star Reggie Bannister in a wasted role but with one of the best lines in the film that's sure to bring laughs to horror fans) and his niece and nephew, out for a fishing trip at the ole fishing hole their late father used to go to. When the niece doesn't return from taking a tinkle, Uncle Ben finds her being eaten by the birds who then spew forth some form of acid into his face that transforms him as well. Of course he then takes out the nephew. The vultures are the first of many poorly done special effects. The hand held ones aren't too bad but the CGI vultures will remind you of the bad CGI creatures you see every week on SyFy's latest killer croc/dinosaur/snake movies.

By this time the rowdy kids have awakened and are on the road in the motor home. Here comes the second worst special effect in the movie. As they drive we get to see a projected image of the RV moving through the windows that's out of focus, out of sync and down right stupid looking. After a fight in the RV between the once wasted yet now angelic girlfriend drawn into a three way the night before, they suddenly slam into Uncle Ben now in the middle of the road munching on someone.

When they get out to investigate, they have to contend first with the not quite dead Uncle Ben and then of course the raging vultures. These are some nasty critters as they rip through the windows, attempt to enter via the hatch on top and in general make themselves pretty darn pesky. Which leads to the next poor effect, the RV blowing up in what looks like some of the worst created CGI fire I've ever seen.

Skipping ahead, and yes I've already told you about a lot of the movie but in an attempt to save you the $1 or perhaps 50 cent price tag for the rental, not all of them survive as they trek through the woods but wouldn't you know that they end up back and the shack used by the good old mad scientist who actually died but came back, resurrected by the rage formula. He's found out about the vultures and discovered that their mutated genes aren't affected by his antidote. Now he must experiment on these teens (?) to find a new cure. And suddenly one of his ex-experiments is helping him and he's picked up a mutated dwarf as well!

You can watch the film if you want to know what happens. All I can tell you is that for a movie made by one of the top progenitors of effects in the last 30 years, this one has some of the crappiest effects I've seen. Not to mention one of the worst scripts with bad dialogue throughout. And some terrible acting. I guess I should have expected that as the main lead in the film, not-so-innocent-girlfriend Kat, identified in the credits as Erin Brown turned out to be B-movie bad girl and straight to video star Misty Mundae. I have yet to see her in anything where she did something that resembled acting.

Honestly I've watched Ed Wood films that were more entertaining. This one is truly bad and wavers along that fine line between a film that is just bad and so bad it's good. And not good as in a good movie but good as in this film is so over the top and bad that it's hilarious. With the exception of Bannister's one quote and another from Mundae delivered to the mutant midget concerning oompa loompas, this movie is worthless. I was sorry I spent the money on it. I've since passed it along to my son who I am sure will put it on and laugh the first time and then use it to demonstrate how bad a movie can be.

There is one good thing about this film. It should give someone out there the confidence to know that anyone can make a movie and that almost anyone could come up with something better. Let's just hope that they don't come up with THE RAGE 2.

On a final note there will be those who enjoy this film for one reason. They love gore. The film does contain tons of it. Everything from exploding heads to entrails to squirting wounds. Sadly even these aren't done better than most films. And if that's all you're interested in, hey enjoy. For me, I'm more interested in things like plot, story development, character development, acting, directing, good special effects, etc.",1278288000,,6404,4.350627615062762

3273662,5,B000ZBEOI8,"The Rage (2007) is what is known as a ""splatter"" movie. Lots of blood and guts and gore. This is not the same as a ""slasher"" movie. Slasher movies, while graphic, aren't as graphic as splatter movies. Good examples of slasher movies are the Halloween movies, the Friday The 13th movies, Happy Birthday To Me, Black Christmas, etc. Slasher movies usually involve a psycho stalker who kills his victims in various unique ways using different tools or gadgets each time. There usually is at least a fairly good plot and story. In contrast, a splatter movie shows an over-the-top amount of blood and gore and relies on showing the graphic mutilation and destruction of the human body. The emphasis is on showing a lot of gore throughout the movie. The plot is almost always extremely weak or laughable or nonexistent. Good examples of popular splatter movies are Night Of The Living Dead (1968), Dawn Of The Dead (1978), The Evil Dead (1981), Bad Taste (1987), and Braindead (1992). So, with this background and description of how a splatter movie is its own sub-genre of horror film and differs from the closely related slasher film, I will give my analysis of The Rage.

The plot is basically this: a mad scientist has set up a laboratory in the middle of the woods somewhere. He has created a ""rage"" virus that he wants to test on some innocent victims he has in captivity in his lab. When these people are injected with the virus, they turn into zombies/monsters. When they escape from the lab, vultures feed on their carcasses. But there's a problem - by feeding on the carcasses, the vultures have now contracted the virus and go into a ""rage"" themselves. They attack anybody who is in or near the woods. A group of young kids in a winnebago stumble across this mad scientist's laboratory in the woods and are fighting for their lives from the monsters inside the lab and the attacking vultures outside.

I found this movie to be one of the best splatter movies I've ever seen. You can't expect much from a splatter movie when it comes to a plot. You can't expect Academy Award-winning acting. All you can expect is a movie that lives up to the definition of ""splatter"" movie. I found this movie highly entertaining. It really kept my attention from start to finish. The pace of the movie is fast. Never a dull moment. I kid you not, I was laughing the whole time. Laughing counts for something. If I'm laughing the whole time, then the movie is doing its job of being very entertaining. Sometimes movies that have a silly plot, bad acting, and shocking graphic violence are the ones that are so entertaining that they get me laughing.

How is the acting in this movie? With the exception of a couple of actors who do an adequate job of acting, the acting is fair to poor. This alone got me laughing. What else got me laughing? The crazy people in Dr. V's lab! And the vultures! The vultures were the stars of the show, if you ask me. They were scary and funny at the same time. They are computer generated and don't look 100% ""real"" but I'm somebody who can see past that. I can't complain. What do you expect from a low budget B splatter movie?

This movie's music is excellent. It was composed by the gothic/Halloween band Midnight Syndicate. The music really fits the movie well. I own the soundtrack because it's good.

Overall, this is a good splatter movie. I realize that this type of movie won't sit well with everybody, so that's why I differentiated between what a splatter movie is and what a slasher movie is. If you like splatter movies, give this one a try. It's even better with pizza and beer.",1263254400,3,3612,4.567901234567901

I see from other reviews that some people really do like it. Fair enough, each to their own and all that, but everything about this film leaves me bored. Very weak 'story', desperate acting, gormless script, unconvincing gore. I had no interest in the characters and would have happily seen them all nuked after 30 minutes of this dross.

3273665,2,B000ZBEOI8,"The Rage (Robert Kurtzman, 2007)

Misty Mundae is in this movie. And if you find that reason enough to check it out, then by all means don't let me stop you. If you value anything else having to do with the wonderful world of film, however, you're setting yourself up for an hour and a half of disappointment. A ludicrous script, terrible gore effects, and a bunch of mangy-looking vultures do not a horror movie make. I'm not entirely sure, but this might actually be worse than Flu Bird Horror.

Plot: bunch of kids stumble into area where evil mutant vultures are transmitting nasty virus. That's pretty much it. There's some interpersonal stuff that's meant to inspire tension. There is, of course, a mad scientist in the middle of nowhere. And there's a cameo from Reggie Bannister, which is, of course, the best part of this.

All that said, The Rage is watchable, in a train-wreck sort of way; it's stupid and cheesy and kind of fun. And, of course, there's no denying the attraction of Ms. Mundae. Don't get me wrong, you'll still regret spending an hour and a half of your life on this, but you'll at least end up wondering how it went by so fast. **",1238371200,3,1159,4.5095238095238095

The story is non-existent...which might be okay if the special effects weren't so horrible.  This was produced by guys from a well established special effects company.  So, how could they have made such a weak film.  They compare this film to The Re-Animator, but don't buy into that.

Oddly enough, however, there was this nagging thought in my mind that implored me to give the film a chance. And when it finally arrived on dvd, I decided to purchase it.

Now, there are very few horror movies that have been able to grab me and never let me go in the past. This film is one of them. ""The Rage"" is simply put, one of the grandest and goriest splatter films in the annals of horror cinema.

This little flick here is one I have been waiting to see quite some time. Like some films I wait a long time to hit dvd just to be let down, this one delivers. Much better then the trailers I had seen on it. Don't expect a big budget theater movie here. Expect a good freakin time. So much crazy stuff going on to keep you on your toes through out the movie, it's insane. If you want gore, there is heaps of it. The zombie vultures sounded dumb but when you catch them in action, it's quite interesting, very surprising in a good way, and brutal.

If you are familiar with Erin Brown, aka Misty Mundae, you are treated to seeing her in this flick. For many people, that alone is worth the price of admission.

I'd put this little flick on par with films like Re-animator and Dead Alive. If you enjoyed Re-animator, this one is sure to please. A great popcorn flick for a friday night to bring your buddies over and have a good time. Dont' forget the beer. A good film like this is always more fun with beer. Yes, the key word is fun. This film isn't about being perfect or pleasing critics, it's about fans of the genre having fun doing what they like best, making a film that they would want to see if it was them buying or renting it.

If you are looking for Hollywood and the next big blockbuster film, go see your local movie listings. If you want a freakin good time, then your bus ride stops here.

Just be sure you watch the uncut/unrated version. If you get the other version, you may not like it and are sure to miss tons of the fun in the movie. For 10 bucks, you can't beat that. Get it while it's still 10 bucks at Amazon. Buy a second film that is 15 bucks or more, and you won't get hit with a shipping charge either.

This however was not what I would expect from a special effects guru.  The first 10 - 15 minutes were pretty darn bloody and really kept my attention but when the movie switched to some CGI vultures, that's when the movie became absolutely ridiculous.

SOME SPOILERS IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPH!

This film is about a mad scientist that was creating a drug that would make people hate each other so that he could take over the world and at the beginning it had some Re-Animatoresque moments, but then it suddenly became an outdoor adventure.  The Rage spreads like a virus and if you are bitten you are infected.  The Rage gets outside, which is fine, except that some stupid CGI vultures spread the Rage.  Now if they had used 1 CGI vulture in 1 scene to make the Rage spread to the humans that would have been fine, but no, they had to be featured the rest of the movie!  BAD MOVE!  They are so poorly done that they are funny at first, but it just gets to be completely irritating.

This movie moved very quickly until the vultures appeared, then the film slowed to a crawl.  While I didn't fast forward I did check the running time on the box to see how much more of this dreck I would have to be subjected to.  Overall the effects are very extreme and look pretty cool but the damn birds!  UGH!  The pacing was good but what could have really been a good flick was quickly ruined.  Too bad, another wasted effort by Erin Brown (Misty Mundae), see her performance in Sick Girl if you want to see what she can really do.

A wasted cast and unfortunately some decent effects down the tubes by some really lame CGI.  Oh well, at least it was only $9.99.  I read the reviews and should have just taken it off of the pre-order list but I thought how bad could it be?  That BAD!",1206057600,2,1898,4.248603351955308
3273679,1,B000ZBEOI8,"When you hear about special FX guru Robert Kurtzman helming a movie, it's not too shocking to see the finished product lacking in so many different areas.  Being the director behind the fairly unmemorable horror films Wishmaster, and most recently Buried Alive, I(unlike some other reviewers) wasn't expecting very much... unfortunately I didn't even get that.  The Rage tells the story of a ""mad"" scientist who is out for vengeance on a world that refused to release his cure for cancer(by killing everyone... makes sense right?).  He creates a virus that turns any human infected with it into a bloodthirsty raging maniac, however he makes one minor miscalculation when it begins infecting vultures that have fed on the contaminated remains of the dead... now all living creatures can catch ""the rage.""  Enter a group of teens who spend their time popping Extacy, having threesomes, watching a band called Mushroomhead out in the woods, and being HORRIBLE actors, all before being attacked by the aforementioned rabid vultures... I guarantee you'll be begging for their deaths within 3 minutes of being introduced to them.  In fact, I'd argue that this may be the most obnoxious bunch of ""victims"" put on screen since, well... maybe ever?!  I mean this group is worse than a truckload of wheelchair ridden Franklins from the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre!  Now you might be wondering, ""who cares as long as they die slow and gruesome deaths.""  And you'd be right in that theory, but here's yet another major flaw this film suffers from... death by CGI!  For a special FX guru, Robert Kurtzman seems to have forgotten the cardinal rule of low-budget horror, if you can't afford it, keep it off screen(or completely out of the film).  Here the vultures are a laughable mess, created with the worst computer animation you're likely to ever see AND stupid looking sock puppets for the all-to-often close ups.  Oh and did I mention that they show up... A LOT.  But that's not it either, we also get computer generated flames, bus crashes, explosions, and even blood splatter effects... again, Robert you know better(at least you should)!  Even a guest appearence from Phantasm's own Reggie Bannister comes off flat and forced.  Underneath it all, The Rage does provide a few decent moments of authentic splattery goodness, but there are so many movies that do it better that it's hard to recommend anyone wasting there time with this instead.

You gotta respect enthusiasm from Kurtzman and Co...but i wouldn't recommend this for more than a one-off rental etc .  I wasn't expecting Oscar worthy acting or dialogue, but some of the acting and lines are utterly terrible, and some of the camerawork very amatuer.  I felt like i was watching a Sci Fi production. The characters weren't interesting at all and the actors themselves weren't much better (sorry to say).  So that leaves us the gore and effects - the gore was for the most part lots of fun although for an unrated cut nowhere near as gory as i'd have expected, however the CG was really bad - esp the vultures and the 'forest' backgrounds used inside the RV. I grew up on 80's shlock and low budget films which i'm sure this is meant to be a homage to, but it just didn't cut the mustard for me.  You CAN have a low budget film with good actors and dialogue.  The only actors who even looked like they were having fun was veterans Bannister & Dividof - who chews up every scene he's in.  If it wasn't for him this would be a total loss for me.  Shame Kurtzman didn't have more of a budget as it'd be fun to see what he can do given more to work with - just next time find actors who can act and at the very least are fun to watch until they get picked off!

They see dinner in five young people: Kat (Erin Brown), Josh (Ryan Hooks), Pris (Sean Serino), Olivia (Rachel Scheer) and Jay (Anthony Clark).

Director, Robert Kurtzman, and his colleagues happily concede that in making `The Rage', they were not setting out to redefine the horror film. Rather, their aim was to make an entertaining movie. I think they've largely succeeded. Yes, some of the acting is a little dodgy from the peripheral players, and yes, some of the special effects are less than special (notably in some of the sequences with the vultures). However,  most of the visual effects are spectacularly good for a low-budget film. You want blood? They've got blood, and lots of it!

Andrew Divoff turns in an excellent performance as the mad doctor. The film's opening section sets the tone in grisly fashion. His low-grade Frankenstein laboratory hosts his latest blood-soaked victims who are already strapped in, unwilling and unready to go under the knife.

Leading lady, Erin Brown, is not known as a Scream Queen for nothing. In this film, possibly one of the loudest I've ever heard, she sounds quite hoarse at times as she and her pals send the decibel counter into orbit. As we all know, Erin Brown is also known as softcore icon, Misty Mundae, and, although her nudie film days are behind her, it is, perhaps, difficult for her to escape her past. There's one scene in `The Rage' where she's woken up after camping out with her friends after a rave. Some nearby men encourage her to lift up her top. She lifts it so far before pulling it back down and giving them the finger. Is this a thinly coded message: ""Ha! I don't do that any more, suckers!"" or am I reading too much into it?

As far as the DVD's bonus material goes, there's an epic `Making of' documentary that lasts almost as long as the feature itself. This has plenty of coverage of the special effects as well as the usual mutual backslapping inherent in these things. There are a lot of production and special effects stills and there's a director's commentary which rehashes a lot of what's already been said in the `Making of' documentary.

`The Rage' is very derivative and has nods to quite a few different films and actors. In one scene, Reggie Bannister's character mentions&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phantasm/dp/B000MV8ABS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phantasm</a>, a film in which he starred almost thirty years ago; the mad doctor has an eastern European accent a la Bela Lugosi; and, given this film's subject matter, there are obviously similarities with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Days-Later-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JMA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;and any number of zombie flicks.",1204675200,2,3749,5.301346801346801

From the creator of From Dusk Till Dawn and director of Wishmaster and Buried Alive comes The Rage.

A mad scientist's ""rage"" injection backfires when his latest specimen breaks free, kills him, then flees. After his third kill, he collapses, and vultures swarm to eat the carcass, thus ingesting the virus and infecting everyone they come in contact with.

A Winnebago full of friends encounter the birds, and the fight for their life begins. They stumble upon the mad scientist's lab, and find out that he's not dead, but is even more adamant on continuing his experiment.

What results is a horribly executed movie with a few decent gore scenes, and CGI birds that are straight bogus. The only plus of this feature was the presence of Erin Brown (aka Misty Mundae) who carries a lead role, but unfortunately, keeps her clothes on in this one.

If you'd rather see Erin how you always have, naked and naive, rent Chantal or Sick Girl, and then buy the newly re-edited 2-disc version of Vampire Strangler, which shows a much younger Misty, but has her only hardcore scenes to date.

3273686,5,B000ZBEOI8,"I am so excited for the release of this film. Robert Kurtzman has done it again! He is the master of horror films, and this film does not disappoint. The Rage is a roller coaster ride from begining to end. Reggie Bannister (Phantasm), Andrew Divoff (Wishmaster), and Erin Brown (Sick Girl) are amazing as always, and newcomer Ryan Hooks is truly a delight. The creatures and fx work are incredible. There is also an appearance by Mushroom Head in the rave scene. This film is soon to be a classic in the genre, and I am proud to add it to my collection.",1201219200,10,553,4.378640776699029

8235263,3,B000ZBEOI8,"A crazed Russian doctor (Andrew Divoff of Wishmaster) experiments with a deadly new virus that turns people (and birds) into bloodthirsty mutants gets in hot water when the virus gets loose and starts infecting those in the surrounding area creating havoc for a group of teens who were out partying at an outdoor Mushroomhead concert in the nearby woods. Woodenly acted from an awfully stupefying script. The movie quite knowingly seems to be a homage to '80's cult films (mainly Evil Dead & Re-animator), but lacks the wit to pull it off as a good movie itself, despite the presence of otherwise talented Divoff, Erin Brown, and Reggie Bannister (the latter in more or less a cameo). May be perfectly acceptable fodder for 2:15 AM after a night of bar-hopping, but watching it unintoxicated is not really recommended.",1516838400,,818,4.934782608695652
8235264,3,B000ZBEOI8,"I'm probably being generous with 3 stars on this one...  but I can't bring myself to drop it to 2...

So, apparently this movie actually had a $2M budget...  on top of that, they actually got the guy from Wishmaster to play in it...  hahaha...

Let's break it down...

Pros - the majority of the special effects were actually not 1/2 bad / PLENTY of gore for people who like that / the story itself was actually reasonable / camera work and audio were fine

Cons - the acting was awful ( in some cases funny awful, which may have been intentional ) / some of the CGI effects were pretty bad...  surprisingly though, they ""might"" have been better than some of those Sunday afternoon SyFy flicks / for a film with a $2M budget, they clearly didn't invest very much in their sets...  I'm guessing most of it went into special effects and fake blood

So, what's the takeaway?  This movie isn't scary, but it has plenty of gore.  What could have been a REALLY good story was just butchered and topped with poor acting.  The upside is, this movie actually did give me a couple laughs.  I suspect they were kind of going for the ""so outlandish and stupid it's funny"" concept, but didn't quite make it all the way.

My suggestion?  If you are bored, and want to go brain dead for an hour and a half, you can certainly do worse than this flick...  Don't expect much, and just laugh at how silly and absurd some of it is...  If you're not into gore and semi-comedy horror style, then just skip this one and find something else...",1516752000,,1519,4.345195729537367
8235265,3,B000ZBEOI8,"The Rage is an over the top gory horror film that's not supposed to take itself too seriously, so if you're looking for some intelligent take of the meaning of life, you're not going to get it here. While it has its moments, something about it just doesn't reach its full potential. I really dug on the humanoid monsters in the lab and thought the film would focus more on them, but during a solid chunk of the film's middle, awful looking cgi birds take the spotlight as mutants created from the rage virus. The main characters have the depth of a kiddie pool, and nothing made me really care about them. It was a case of waiting around for annoying characters to die in gruesome ways, and in that aspect, I can't say I was disappointed. So I say one star for a cool idea, one for the gore, and one for Reggie Bannister making a Phantasm reference at one point.",1501977600,,862,4.327160493827161

These so-called victims that are in peril, I could not possibly care less for any of them. the dialog seems to be made up on the fly and very badly at that.
