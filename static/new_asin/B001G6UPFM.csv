3597220,4,B001G6UPFM,"SUMMER HOURS (L'heure d't) is more of a reverie than a story for a film. This very French film touches the subject of family - the meaning and influence and contradictions - in an examination of coping with the death of the matriarch and her wishes versus the intentions of the siblings. Writer/Director Olivier Assayas seems less interested in allowing the viewer to get to know the individuals of the story than he is with conveying the vacuum of death and the aftermath of dealing with it in the setting of a family of grown children.

The film opens as it closes - in summer with scenes awash with French countryside living. Three children have gathered with their families for the 75th birthday of their mother, the elegant and wistful Hlne (Edith Scob) whose adoration of her famous painter uncle presses on her mind as she senses her own mortality. One son, Frdric (Charles Berling) is her confidant in hearing her wishes about the dispersal of the house and furniture and art that mean so much to her. Her other son Jrmie (Jrmie Renier) has traveled from his new home in China where his tennis shoes company has stationed him: his fondness for his mother is apparent but his need for financing makes him view the wishes of his mother in a more practical light. Her daughter Adrienne (Juliet Binoche) has traveled from her preferred new home in New York City and views the wishes of her mother with a similar practical and somewhat distant stance.

Some time later the mother dies and the children gather for the funeral and for the discussion of what to do with the 'inheritance'. The interplay between the sentimental Frdric and the pragmatic Adrienne and Jrmie bring about questions of placing the art and furniture with museums and the selling of the house of their youth. Gentle undertones of sibling relationships and questions about the quality of memorabilia versus the practicality of getting on with living provide the final movement. The film ends in a coda that returns the younger generation (Hlne's grandchildren) to the beauty of the gardens of the now empty French house. The thread that holds the film together is the presence of the longtime housekeeper lose (Isabelle Sadoyan), the gentle being that understands it all.

Though the film is beautifully acted and photographed there is very little development of the various characters, a fact that leaves the viewer with the feeling of simply peeking through a windowpane to watch a French family walk through a moment in life and in death. Nothing much happens here: the film is more a reverie, but a very beautiful one to relax and enjoy. Grady Harp, May 09",1243728000,3,2634,4.797356828193832

3597222,5,B001G6UPFM,"This elegiac French film concerns the passing of one generation to the next in a family of three siblings left with the complicated inheritance of a mother whose country house is filled with the memories and belongings of a great-uncle who was a well-known artist. Richly detailed, Proustian evocation of a moment in time where past and present meet - before time moves on.

This is a multi-layered film, interested in the interconnections between overlapping lives, while taking on many themes from the meaning that possessions assume in our lives to the responsibilities we owe to the past and to the memories and wishes of our forebears. It raises issues of lasting vs ephemeral values, esthetic vs practical, monetary vs sentimental, materialism vs intangibles like loyalty, respect, passion, tradition. It tantalizes with the expectation of family secrets that are never quite revealed. It luxuriates in the languor of French countryside at the height of summer.

While the dilemma - what to do with the the art collection of a dead artist - suggests a kind of high-culture perspective on the subject, the film keeps bringing us down to earth with its interest in the conflicts that might exist between any family members left to sort out the belongings of a dead parent, while needing to get on with their lives. The closing scenes are a brilliant coda to the way the dilemma is resolved - the central characters are left behind as we follow the next generation - teenagers invading the abandoned country house for a last weekend of partying, their attention focused completely on the present and the beckoning future.

This is a wise and thoughtful film especially for older adults. See it with someone who has lived a good deal of life, and the two of you will have much to reflect on and comment about.",1242518400,53,1811,4.873376623376624

Helene Berthier dies and leaves behind a comfortable country house-the sort that takes a whole life time to get just right-and an art collection. Her three children, Frederic, Adrienne and Jeremie (played by Charles Berling, Juliette Binoche, and Jeremie Renier) argue about how to dispense of Helene's things. Frederic wants to keep everything as it is. Adrienne and Jeremie would rather sell the house and everything in it and donate the art to the Musee d'Orsay.

Prima facie, this film sounds a little dull. But it deeply explores the way in which things acquire meaning through attached memories. Some people seem to want no memory and strive to live in a clear, unencumbered present. Adrienne and Julienne live overseas and want little to do with France and its traditions. Adrienne's mother poignantly tells her ""you prefer objects not weighed down by the past"". Julienne, living in Japan and manufacturing trainers-an icon of the disposable lifestyle-is keen to get rid of what he won't use.  Others, like Frederic, are reluctant to let go of things because the animate memory and lifestyle attached to the inanimate object will likely disappear with the auctioneers hammer.

I once aspired to not own more than I could fit into my VW. And yet, I can't deny being moved when I look at piles of old photographs of my grandmother in the South of France. Everyone wants to simplify. It's terribly tacky to attach meaning to things. And yet, home doesn't feel too homey if it's full of IKEA furniture purchased yesterday. What do you keep? What do you let go of? How much of your present life do you sacrifice for the jet sam of your parent's life? How much energy should you expend to make the decision? How much should things rule our lives? Summer Hours demonstrates that every thing, every piece of stuff you bring into a home, no matter how trivial, is likely to exact a toll that is anything but small.",1242345600,6,2171,5.159090909090909

3597234,4,B001G6UPFM,"'Summer Hours' is a film that takes us to the present. The mother of this family is celebrating her 75th birthday at their summer place outside of Paris. During this time she speaks to her oldest son, Frederic, played by Charles Berlinger. She wants him to know about the things she will be leaving behind, some very old and worthwhile when she is dead, and what should be done. She does not write anything down and does not trust lawyers. Her other children, Adrienne, played by Juliette Binoche is a very busy artist living in New York, and Jeremie played by Jeremie Renier lives in a China with his family. They visit once a year as the mother expects, and this film is really about them.

Of course, the mother soon dies, the family decides to sell everything or give some of the valuables to a museum. The memories of mom center around her living with her uncle, a great artist, after their father and her husband dies. They all have their memories, and we share a little about their lives and their families. This film is about their decisions and how they will proceed with their lives. It gives us a glimpse into our futures.

3597235,3,B001G6UPFM,"This is a more or less ""plotless"" film about three generations of a French family. The matriarch is arranging for the disposal of her valuable art collection and the family is just as definitely resisting the idea that she is going to die. But die she does, and then the next generation, three children have to figure out what to do with the house, the valuable pieces of Art Deco furniture and some paintings by Cortot and a damaged Degas maquette (small plaster model for a larger cast statue.)  The interesting part of this interaction is not only what the house and art means to each of Hlne's children, but how they deal with French death tax, which is carefully designed to extract the best pieces for state museums such as the Muse d'Orsay so there can be some residual of wealth for the heirs. This is done via some careful negotiation--the most interesting of which was about the sale of notebooks of the fictional artist Berthier. A casual side remark about where they were to be sold was really the crux of the negotiation.

The generation of grandchildren also enjoyed the house for long rambles in the woods, gathering berries and games on the grass, but finally, the inevitable passing of family history blends with lives that are drifting widely away from France and each other.

The best part of the film was near the end, showing how the artworks ended up in the museum and how they were displayed--an interesting transition. It was like looking at animals first in their natural environment, then in a zoo. The maquette, which was D.O.A. in the initial scenes, comes to life at the hands of a skilled restorer. That was a small scene but quite dramatic.

The only false note I found was the incident with the granddaughter, who was caught smoking pot and running around with a boyfriend. It was a bit of an aside to the general theme. I also thought Juliette Binoche was somewhat wasted in this role, although she does her workmanlike best to create the character. She was the weakest of the three characters and it was kind of a shame, as she's always a joy to watch. I hoped for a bigger role. Like many French films, there is little plot and much of a slice of life.",1400889600,,2187,4.557251908396947

3597237,1,B001G6UPFM,"It's 'antiques road show goes to France'. Ug. Dealing with grief and loss and life moving on is a meaningful, relatable, complex human experience. Dealing with the details of a mutimillion dollar estate is not. This is a long, tedious movie about the latter.
 I kept wondering when they would start acting like 'people'. It never happened. One guy cried in the dark with his back to us once. They almost had an argument about the estate once. Handling their expensive old belongings was not a metaphor for something more. It was literally just a movie about stuff with some halfhearted people drifting in and out of scene. It's bizarre to me since death and it's aftermath can be such rich, fertile ground for characters to develop and show who they are- but not in this movie.

3597243,4,B001G6UPFM,"""Summer Hours"" (2008 release from France; 103 min.) brings the story of three siblings: Frederic, Jeremie and Adrienne. As the movie opens, we get to know these characters and their family at a family reunion to celebrate their mother's 75th birthday at the family's summer house outside of Paris. The first 30 min. of the movie covers just this reunion. We learn that Jeremie and his wife and kids now live in China, while Adrienne now lives in New York, leaving Frederic as the only sibling still in France. The family reunion concludes, and it's not long thereafter that we learn the mother has suddenly passed away, and the siblings now must decide what to do with the summer cottage, including the nice art work that has been collected over decades. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first and foremost, this is a very fine and nuanced family and character study. I love how we get to know the three siblings better. Writer-director Olivier Assayas (also known from the ""Paris, je t'aime""  movie segment ""Quartier des Enfants Rouges"") takes his sweet time and is in no rush, and I mean that as a compliment. Second, this movie feels entirely credible in so many respects. I grew up in Belgium, now a long time resident of the US, and I completely relate to the dilemmas encountered by the expat siblings, feeling a strong bond with the summer cottage yet knowing that their lives are now elsewhere. Third, there are a ton of great performances, none better than Charles Berling as the oldest sibling Frederic. Juliette Binoche as Adrienne is remarkably understated. Last but certainly not least, art (and the collection of it) plays a major role in the film, so if you are not into that, do yourself a favor and stay away from this.

Bottom line: this is a very fine movie, which I enjoyed from start to finish. So glad I picked this up at my local library the other day. Please note that the Criterion edition comes with an second DVD chockfull of extras but I have to admit that after seeing such a beautiful and nuanced film, I really had no interest in watching any of the bonus materials. It was just perfect the way it was. ""Summer Hours"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1394668800,,2272,4.632754342431761

3597249,5,B001G6UPFM,"This is a tender, thoughtful film about people and their possessions, emotional attachment to objects versus the chill of market value, the haunting of sentiment in an unsentimental world.  So too with people, families dismantled by death, job transfers, new attachments, drifting from one place to another.

The acting, writing and directing are impeccable, as if watching real life, especially in scenes of the siblings gathered together after the death of their mother.  The fond familiarity, casual intimacy of jokes, diplomacy of compromise and side-stepping of controversy, the quizzical speculations about the late mother.........every nuance of inflection, expression, body language........all rang perfectly true.

In one of the strongest scenes, the oldest sibling visits his mother's former writing desk, now on display in a museum.  Outside of emotional context the desk is coldly objectified, stripped of meaning.  So too the lives of individuals in this globalized world?

The film reminds me of the Japanese director Ozu.......""Tokyo Story"", ""Late Spring"" and ""Early Summer.""  Graceful small stories of everyday life in which sentiment loses again and again to a newer, confusing, modern-day culture.

""Summer Hours"" is so subtle, so natural, one might not immediately recognize its powerful resonance.

Should it all go to a museum?  Should the children (four of them) have an equal share of items?

3597259,5,B001G6UPFM,"I'm writing this review after not having seen it for a while but somehow ended up here. There is this great aspect of French cinema (and maybe life) that deals with the layers of history by building personal narratives. This movie inhabits a home stuck between generation gaps, an artist pushed back into the place they came from by historical context and the objectification of objects, as well as the issue of death being a post mortum debate about what to do with these historical narratives and objectified objects.

It's worth seeing because it deals with things people have to deal with but only after a certain point in their life. Not all of us are lucky enough to have historical artifacts divided among personal ruins but I think it might ring true for everyone in some way or another. If you like antiquities and/or art this will peak your interest and you will most likely enjoy  this film. I don't remember it being funny or blockbuster-esque.

But while the ideas are intriguing, and the acting good it never quite reached the deepest level

Called a masterpiece by a number of critics, and something close by others, I cant quite go there,

3597262,5,B001G6UPFM,"There are few films that capture the authenticity of life quite like `Summer Hours', a small and intimate portrayal of family life in all of its various stages yet confined to a simmer.  The film moves rather languidly, floating in and out of `moments' that capture a whole far grander than many films concocted in recent years.  This film is touching, moving and ultimately reassuring for it understands the intricacies that make the finale so profound.

Anti-climactic can be far more climactic than we give it credit for.

`Summer Hours' delves into the lives of three individuals; Frederic, Adrienne and Jeremie, shortly after the death of their mother.  As they all gathered together for her seventy-fifth birthday, they are told that once she passes they are free to do whatever they like with her belongings, including her beautiful estate.  Once she dies, differences in her children start to creep into the way they wish to dispense of their inheritance of sorts. Their values, their futures, their ideals are all called into play as they discuss and compromise with one another over the belongings their beloved mother left behind.

But this film is so much more than that.

This film is far less about `things' and more about people and the way they affect our lives.  As her children are left to sort through all she left behind, it is less her belongings and more her legacy, while barely mentioned, that makes the strongest impact.  Lives move so quickly that our actions can be deceiving, but there are beautiful moments that pick up on the subtle hints that chip away at the truth behind the eyes of these newly orphaned adults.  By the film's end, one is brought to a sharper realization of the importance and enriching fragments of life itself, and one can beautifully grasp the sincerity of every frame.

With fine performances from the entire cast, Olivier Assayas directs a modern masterpiece; a stunning piece of cinema that comes full circle in its own message; closing out with a sequence that says so much about the core of this film and where `life' is headed.",1334016000,5,2086,4.828651685393258

3597265,5,B001G6UPFM,"Yes, this is an ""art"" fillum and it is French so it's not for everyone, but bear with me on both scores. The art in this movie is actual art that three siblings inherit along with their family home after their mother dies. The French part shouldn't dissuade those of you who hate subtitled flicks or artsy fartsy European fare--it's really a poignant, loving portrayal of a family yet one based in the reality of what one has to deal with when a loved one dies and you're left with their memories (in this case their valued objects and home).

If this story was done by Hollywood you'd have shrill voices screaming and fighting over the valuable art. As it was done by the French, it's done in a way that seems natural among two brothers and a sister over how to dispose of a family estate in a way that brings honor and dignity to the family name.

There are some great scenes that show up museums and the ""coldness"" of the way they do business and subsequently display other people's memories where all context and love of art is pretty much lost once removed from its original owner's homes.

The dialogue is first-rate and so natural. The story is also so modern and speaks of the globalization of our modern world and how a culture can be chipped away just by family members moving away. I won't ruin that aspect of the movie for anyone but you'll see how profound the effect is and yet in the end the grandchildren show all is not lost for France when its citizens move abroad.

The movie also looks fantastic. You actually feel as if you are in a wonderful jumbled French country home that actually feels like a home and the art pieces are alive (i.e., one famous vase gets used constantly for flowers rather than just being a display behind a glass case).

(Kudos also for the choice of the Plasticines' song near the end of the movie to showcase France's punk pop of today.)",1308960000,3,1883,4.430635838150289

How can you transmit your loved ones those unsaid experiences that truly convey you to another dimension, encapsulated if you may into this incorporeal atmosphere?

Three siblings must come to terms with their mother's mortality as they decide what to do with her valuable belongings in this warm family drama from filmmaker Olivier Assayas. Hlne Berthier (Edith Scob) is about to turn 75, and her children are gathering at her home in the country for a party. Adrienne (Juliette Binoche) has flown in from New York City, where she lives with her boyfriend, James (Kyle Eastwood). Jrmie (Jrmie Renier) has taken a rare break from his globe-trotting business interests to stop by with his wife (Valrie Bonneton). And Frdric (Charles Berling), the only one who lives close enough to visit regularly, has also come with his spouse, Lisa (Dominique Reymond). Hlne has inherited a large and valuable collection of art from her brother, and with her health beginning to fail, she approaches Frdric and asks that he, Jrmie, and Adrienne come up with a plan to deal with the pieces after her death. Frdric wants to keep the collection together and see if they can persuade a gallery to purchase and present them as a set. Jrmie and Adrienne have other ideas, but as he's pondering a business opportunity in China and she's planning on settling in America for good, they don't have as much influence over the final decision as Frdric. L'Heure d't (aka Summer Hours) was produced in part by the celebrated French art gallery Muse d'Orsay, and was one of a handful of films created to honor the museum in its 20th anniversary year.

The film explores not only the missing ties of a recent past and confronts it with the daily conflicts of a new generation concerned with other interests, expectations
and other ways of experience respect the existence.

When we watch the irreversible dismantling of that residence and observe how the experts steem the cost in the market; or when we are witness about the youngster meeting with the new music floading the extinct home of the scent of the new times, we feel that the art of conversation (that nurtures the thinking)has lost part of its significance.

An ambitious film that exposses much more than it shows thanks to its powerful visual metaphors.

It's about the gradual demolition of certain values that now will have to be experienced through the web and alternative resources.",1303776000,,2591,4.906392694063927
3597269,5,B001G6UPFM,"Assayas,director of the monumental Carlos,with its worldly references,here shows he is also able to direct a quieter fictional film of the power of memories and the beauty of summer's passing. This drama about an elderly art collector,Helene(Edith Scob),whose birthday(75) brings the annual summer visit from her 3 children, Frederic (Charles Berling),an economist,Adrienne(Juliette Binoche), the designer for a Japanese store based in New York,and Jeremie,who works for Puma in China. They are accompanied by partners and children,although Adrienne is engaged to a man in New York who we see later in the film.

Nearing the end of her life,Helene is slightly depressed,thinking about passing on her estate in the country and her art collection, in memory of her uncle,artist Paul Berthier,to her son Frederick,who wants to share it with his siblings and her grandchildren. Her children begin to discuss what will happen to Helene's art collection(works by Bethier,by Redilon and Corot,as well as beautiful vases,cabinets and furniture) when she dies. Each sibling has different plans. Adrienne and Jeremie live abroad. Frederick is wanting to preserve the art works in the family and keep the country estate with the housekeeper Elouise for the family. We feel the draining away of authenticity and identity as the house becomes a ghost of itself. A nice touch is when Elouise is given one of the beautiful twin vases to take away when the house closes,saying she wouldn'y have wanted anything valuable.

The elegance and subtlety of treatment(without being talky),the concept of  preserving or profiting from family heirlooms,the younger generation who have no connection to them,the uprooting and dislocating and dispersal of family life,is done with sentiment but without sentimentality. Berling carries the main load of the film very well,but the other actors are just right in this measured, poignant examination of time passing and life moving on in modern France.

The film acknowledges that modern life can disconnect yet makes it obvious that there is a common denominator, that of authenticity bestowed by one's inner life. Eloise touching the flowers in front of the emasculated house. Eloise watching her patronne wilt after the departure of grandkids. The Paris couple adjusting to life with grace and humor; the girl's sadness upon realizing that she has just lost a priceless part of her childhood. It seemed to me that the expat siblings were missing something essential -  as if cutting links to their old home and country diminished them subtly, irreversibly. The film wasn't easy to watch, my grandfather had a similar grand old house & garden etc. And I now live far away.

3597271,3,B001G6UPFM,"Cinma vrit? That's what 'Summer Hours' seeks to be... a carefully crafted exploration of real people's lives. But, despite the excellent acting, intriguing story and beautiful cinema-photography the problem is that the film fails to explore the reasons why the characters feel the way they do. You want to know why, but it doesn't really tell you - there's no context to their emotions. For example, a man breaks down because his family home and all that it means to him is about to be lost, but there's insufficient evidence of why this means so much to him to make you engage in his, superbly acted, reaction. And, without this it just drifts along... leaving you thinking that there's a much better film below the surface trying to get out. 'Paris', with its similarly slow, 'true to life' storyline shows just how good this type of subtle French cinema (and Juliette Binoche) can be in the hands of the right director, but 'Summer Hours' isn't much more than a languidly enjoyable example of how not to do it.",1289174400,,1013,4.696629213483146

The real star is Charles Berling in a complex and complete performance. He has issues of his own, while trying to do the right thing for his mom. This is a film about generations, and what might happen when things aren't properly prepared. The last scene, which some other reviewers found inane, was really about the new generation coming to terms with the fact that what they once took advantage of may not be there anymore.

3597273,3,B001G6UPFM,"I can't get over the disappointing ending in this film.  If you truly adore the history of fine art, you may enjoy this DVD Criterion Collection, especially the special features.  The storyline is about a 75 year old wealthy French woman who owns a magnificent estate that is filled with a large collection of fine, museum quality artwork.  The more memorable pieces in the film are a Louis Majorelle desk, paintings by Corot, Felix Bracquermond vases, panels by Olidon Radon, and a Christofle Tray.  And her life is focused around the paintings and drawings of her uncle, painter Paul Berthier (fictional).

Sensing her death, she invites her three grown children over for a birthday party.  Two of the children, live away from France.  Plus, she has a devoted housekeeper.

We get the sense that she was in love with her uncle, the painter Paul Berthier as she speaks of him constantly.  And it is a tender moment when the children are gone from the party, she says: ""lot of things will be leaving me, memories, secrets, and stories that interest no one anymore.""  And to her, all she has are the objects.

Fast forward to her death, and the focus is not on grieving, but the three children are vacillating what to do with the estate, and the decision is to sell it.  The next step is to discuss with committee members from the museum how to disperse the valuables.  Much time is given to the discussion of the art.

Although you might feel there is a little drama, who fights over what, what happens to the estate, when does it sell, who gets a share of the profits, etc.  Nothing much like that was discussed.  There always remains an air of suspense, but what  happened?  We assume much of the artwork has gone to the museum as a donation in lieu of a huge tax bill.

Then, as little as we know about the characters, mainly the son who lives in France, comes out of the blue his dealing with a teenage daughter in trouble at school.  Why did this storyline come into the picture.  It means nothing.

So, all in all, the storyline is good.......until the end.  The DVD film provides an hour documentary titled The Inventory, given by the experts from the Musee d' Orsay Museum, and, there is an interview with the director.

Let's face it: a film about liquidating an estate is just not that interesting unless you're an estate liquidator.
My favorite contemporary French director is Cedric Klapisch. His recent film Paris is also beautifully filmed and acted  and he tells a compelling story of a dancer who needs a heart transplant. Both films feature Juliette Binoche, who is still excellent in her middle years.
If you're a fan of the French new wave, comparing these two films is a bit like comparing Eric Rohmer's Six Moral Tales to Jean-Luc Godard's Breathless. Godard wins easily.",1276646400,2,734,4.872

Obviously he wants to leave everything for his siblings and their children to enjoy for future generations.

Frederic is the only of the three who wants to preserve a part of their life but the older siblings see no point in it and want to get on with their lives. The rest of the movie is the process of selling the house and the precious artifacts  thereby destroying a piece of their lives.
Some sequences in the movie were splendid and have stayed with me. I thought that the musical piece accompanying the scene which gives us a voyeuristic glimpse of the happenings at the celebration was haunting. Similarly Edith's face as she sits in the dark after her children have departed their home is evocative of the heartbreak that parents face when their children have left them for far off places. In my opinion the movie was accurate in depicting the lives of people who have left their homes for distant shores although they are nostalgic about their past they are too busy in their new lives to preserve the past that they have left behind. This is a movie about trying to make a life for oneself in distant lands while letting the past disintegrate. I loved the movie four stars. 5/21/10",1275091200,,1910,4.589442815249267

3597278,5,B001G6UPFM,"Writer and director Olivier Assayas lends his talent for natural dialogue to ""Summer Hours"" (L'heure d't), a low-key family drama that reflects on a growing apathy towards a stagnating culture and economy in France. Helene (Edith Scob) is a family matriarch and proud preserver of her uncle Paul Berthier's memory. Berthier was a famous painter, and Helene is dedicated to his legacy. For her 75th birthday, her three grown children, their spouses, and children reunite at the family's country home. Helene feels she has little time left and wants her eldest son Frederic (Charles Berling) to understand that he is free to sell the house and art collection when she is gone. But Frederic hopes to preserve it for her grandchildren, even though his brother Jeremie (Jeremie Renier) and sister Adrienne (Juliette Binoche) live overseas and don't share his sentimentality.

A less thoughtful writer might have pitted Frederic's values against those of his siblings and had them yelling at each other. Assayas doesn't. He's making a down-to-earth film about a group of people who are all trying to be reasonable. It is essentially a series of conversations but does not feel as ""talky"" as many French films do, because the dialogue is not pretentious or self-conscious. These people are very listenable. Helene is losing interest in life, but she is more realistic about how the world will work in her absence than her children are. Frederic, the only child to make his life in France, sees his history slipping away, leaving little for his own children. Jeremie and Adrienne see their future and their family's elsewhere, where dusty objets d'art and tales of Paul Berthier will not be relevant. They understand one another perfectly, but that doesn't change their perspectives.

""Summer Hours"" would be just a naturalistic family drama were it not for its allusions to the current crises of French culture. Jeremie and Adrienne are among a growing number of French expatriates relocating in search of economic opportunity. Jeremie works for Puma in China; Adrienne designs tableware in New York. They have fled stagnation in France. Not coincidentally, Frederic is a Parisian economist of somewhat passive ideology. Museum curators are worried that Helene's collection will leave France. By their nature, they are less concerned with creating a future in France than with keeping the past there. And so the small drama of dispensing of one woman's belongings reflects the dilemma that younger generations of French face in a perpetually sluggish economy, where basic cultural assumptions are being called into question. Assayas' quiet exploration is sympathetic and subtly critical.",1272931200,4,2680,5.244755244755245

In the early scenes of ""Summer Hours,"" a 75-year-old French widow (Edith Scob), sensing that the end of her life is at hand, gathers her three adult children and their respective families together at their bucolic ancestral home to celebrate what she believes may be her final birthday.  Though a proud mother and a dutiful wife, Helene Bertier has really lived her whole life dedicated to preserving the work and the memory of her uncle, a famous, well-respected painter (there are indications that there may have been more to their relationship than what was apparent on the surface).  Two of her three children have scattered to the far-flung corners of the globe - Adrienne (Juliette Binoche) to New York City and Jeremie (Jeremie Renier) to China - while the oldest, Frederic (Charles Berling), alone of the three, remains in France.  When the day of her passing finally arrives, the three siblings are faced with the universal dilemma of clinging to the past by holding onto the family estate with all the memories it contains or of selling it off and moving on with their lives.

""Summer Hours"" is a beautifully realized film that captures the truths of familial relationships in subtle and knowing terms.  The film has an unforced, spontaneous feel to it, due in large part to the lack of contrived plotting, the lifelike dialogue, the understated performances and the spontaneous, naturalistic style of filmmaking director Olivier Assayas has employed in service of the material.  Though very little ""happens"" in the conventional narrative sense of the term, the film is never static because Assayas has made the camera an intimate though unobtrusive observer of the scene.  We feel as if we are eavesdropping on these people, while, at the same time, becoming deeply involved with their lives and story.  Even the conflicts that inevitably arise among the siblings are executed with amazing restraint and precision, completely devoid of the kind of hyperbole and histrionics that seem to blight so many ""family dramas.""

The movie captures the sad reality that sometimes when a person's life is over, all that's left behind to commemorate that life is an assortment of ""things,"" things that come to have less and less value to each succeeding generation as the personal meanings and memories associated with them recede with time.  Yet, in the final scene there is a brief but poignant hint that there is still a continuity that runs through the generations, binding them together in shared experience, no matter how tenuous that connection may appear to the casual observer.

This film is a ""map"" of modern human consciousness.

It starts with a French family gathering in the provences at their family home.  The aging mother, now 75 years old, played by lovely and charming French actress Edith Scob, has gathered with her children for a birthday.  Her children have come from their careers, all over the world, to be with her.  During the course of the celebration, they begin exchanging memories, sentiments, the realities of fulfilling careers in a modern global economy, and, the importance of their love and sentiment for each other.

In the wake of the mother's demise, the family explores the values that they hold most dearly.  As all of us must face, in our modern lives, they make compromises so that they may continue with their careers, their global pursuits, and their relationships outside of the family.  The denouement arrives when they decide to sell their mother's considerable estate, and, donate many of her objets d'art to the Muse d'Orsay.

The film witnesses the resolution of their grief, fears, hopes and dreams, as they gradually let go of the art that their mother had collected, and, which had surrounded them when they were children.

Juliette Binoche (as a blonde) is no less than brilliant in this performance.

""Summer Hours"" revolves around the children of the family matriarch, Helene (played by Edith Scob) who is celebrating her 75th birthday with her three children and their families.  Her children include the oldest son Frederic (played by Charles Berling), who happens to be the only son living in France; her daughter Adrienne (played by Juliette Binoche) who lives in New York and is a designer for a Japanese department store and her youngest son Jeremie (played by Jeremie Renier) are there to celebrate her birthday.

But for Helene, life is loneliness and knowing that this 75th birthday may be the last she sees of her children and grandchildren as they are living their own lives without her.  All that is there for her is her longtime maid Eloise and memories of the past, and countless, priceless art and sculpture collections collected over the years by her uncle and the family.  Relics that have been part of the family for ages.

While everyone is celebrating her birthday, she talks to her oldest son Frederic and gives him directions of how she wants the paintings, the expensive artifacts in the home to be taken care of and preparing him just in case she is no longer around.  Of course, Frederic doesn't want to hear any of this and feels his mom will be around for many, many years to come.  But being at the old house and talking with his mother brings back memories of  when Frederic and his siblings were young and how the place has so many memories.

When everyone leaves to go back home, Helene is saddened.  She knows that she won't see her family for a long time.  They say they will visit but each have their own family, their own careers and are all busy.  Lonely, saddened, she finds peace while sitting alone in the dark.

And not long after the day of celebrating their mother's 75th birthday, the children are reunited once more but this time to mourn their mother's death but now figure out what will happen to the paintings, sketches and expensive artifacts around the home but also what will happen to the house that they grew up in.

Adrienne is busy with her career, her own personal life and living in New York, Jeremie and his family are planning to move to China and have no chance to visit France to check on the house and for Frederic, he is torn because of his memories of the house and the art that they grew up with and hoped the children would inherit it.  But the children are too young too appreciate the art and his siblings may need the money to help them start with their own lives.  It's letting go of the things that he once grew up with and appreciated that is the most difficult.

For Frederic, knowing that the things in the home are full of memories of his mother, his childhood and a potential memory for this own children but due to circumstances, he knows that he must let go.

The cinematography by Eric Gautier captures the tranquility of the home and its surrounding areas.  The attention to detail when it comes to the art pieces is fantastic and I can easily imagine how awesome this film would look on Blu-ray.  What I loved about the look of this film is that it does remind me a bit of Jean Renoir, Eric Rohmer and Agnes Varda.  The attention to the nature and the living space with so much detail.  Absolutely beautiful!

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Summer Hours"" is a simply story about siblings who have lost a loved one, a parent and having to make decisions of what happens to possessions and property. Something that a lot of people can relate to.

Describing this film by words is not so easy.  The premise of those mourning the death of a love one may seem a bit banal and not so interesting but director Olivier Assayas does a a few things right in order to make the film feel just right.  From the beautiful cinematography by Eric Gautier and capturing the beauty of the home and its outward scenery.  The place looks small but its surrounding so lush with green plants, flowers and overall just this sense of peace and tranquility to the outside world.  With Assayas's appreciation of Jean Renoir, he also incorporates along with nature, the beauty of art.  In fact, that is what intrigues me about the characters is their appreciation and knowledge of art but also to see how art is used throughout the film.

Also, there is a sense of choreography of how the characters interact with each other.  Depending on one's experience of having to dispose of possessions after one's death can easily be seen as a scene of conflict, a scene that can become troublesome but you realized with these characters, this is a loving family but each have their own lives.  Older brother Frederic who is more emotional towards the house and the paintings while his two siblings are not as attached.  Adrienne is getting married and continuing her life in America to begin her own family, while Jeremie and his family are focused on their move to Beijing.  As an older brother, he is conflicted because his mother and uncle loved the house, the art but knowing his siblings are not in the same situation and the money made by selling each piece can benefit them.

And Assayas also manages to inject the significant others of Frederic and Jeremie into the film as they stay strong in support of their husbands and their decisions.  Watching these characters, you have a sense of what is important, what is sentimental and what is the finality of their decisions.  We can easily understand each of the siblings point of view and then we can also see why one would be tied to the home and the art.  These scenes are just beautiful to watch onscreen and one can think, ""why would anyone want to leave this haven""?  And I believe the children of Frederic sum it up very well when they see the paintings and when told that they can inherit it one day, the look of their faces are not happy but more of a ""Why?"" and the comment of the son of the painting is of another era?  Too young to appreciate the beauty in art and for the character of Frederic, knowing that art should be appreciated, not given to those who inherit it and don't have the same passion.

And that is what I find so beautiful with this story.  It was well-written, well-directed and cinematography is absolutely beautiful.  ""Summer Hours"" is a gorgeous film, a touching film but is not perfect.  As we get comfortable with the older siblings, the film suddenly switches to Frederic's young daughter Sylvie who brings her friends to party in the house.  We see the children blasting hip hop, smoking weed and by the end of the film, you feel satisfied but the generation shift was a bit abrupt but at the same time, you can understand why it was done.

The Criterion Collection has presented us again with another DVD (and also Blu-ray) release of a beautiful film that is worth having in your film collection.  As I am viewing the DVD version, I can easily say that I'm quite sure the Blu-ray version will be absolutely beautiful due to the outdoor scenes and the amount of detail presented inside the home and the art and sculptures featured.  The special features are quite enjoyable, especially if you are passionate about art.

Overall, ""Summer Hours"" is a fantastic film that I can easily give the highest recommendation.",1271721600,4,9831,4.713532513181019
3597285,5,B001G6UPFM,"Writer/director Olivier Assayas does an excellent job creating the relaxed vibe of a family reunion with kids playing boisterously in the background with authentic-sounding conversations, like the playful way siblings insult each other but with a spiteful subtext familiar to anyone who has a brother and/or sister. Summer Hours also addresses the inevitable mortality of one's parents - something most of us will have to face at one point in our lives. Assayas' film is about many things, most notably the importance of family and the loss of a loved one. When a parent dies you start to take stock of your own life as you become aware of your own mortality.

There is an interview with Olivier Assayas that was conducted in January 2010 especially for this DVD. He talks about Summer Hours in relation to some of his other films. With this film he wanted to make a simple story set in France and explore subject matter familiar to him. Assayas talks about the influence of Jean Renoir's films on his own work. He speaks quite eloquently about the themes his film explores.

""Making-of"" is a 26-minute documentary featuring interviews with Assays and actors Charles Berling and Juliette Binoche. There's plenty of footage of Assayas working with his cast and crew on the set of the film. The director talks about his working methods and what he expects from his actors.

""Inventory"" is a 50-minute documentary that examines the film's approach to the art on display in Paris' Musee d'Orsay. Originally, the museum wanted to celebrate its 20th anniversary by having several filmmakers shoot a small film with the museum featured in it. Assayas was approached and ended up turning his into a feature-length film which became Summer Hours.",1271376000,2,1737,4.962199312714777
3597286,4,B001G6UPFM,"A family returns home to celebrate the birthday of their aging mother.  Their ancestral home is like a living museum, containing the works of her uncle, a celebrated painter, and of so many other important artists.  Before long, she will be gone, and she knows that the treasures she had accumulated and preserved will no longer remain intact.  It is a subtle story of a family, like all families, with things that are left unsaid but need to be spoken, with expectations that cannot possibly be fulfilled.  It is told here by Oliver Assayas with a remarkably light touch, with a beautiful palette, a fluid camera and seamless edits.  The acting is pitch-perfect throughout - it doesn't feel like acting.

I couldn't help but think of this as a lighter counterpoint to the more melancholy, but more playful and inventive,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Christmas-Tale/dp/B002M36R28/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Christmas Tale</a>&nbsp;by Arnaud Desplechin, whose sensibilities strike me as similar to those of Assayas - both films deal with similar issues of inheritance, of loss, of communication failures, and yet, while this film is less deliberately avant-garde than that one, it feels every bit as profound and yet more delicate, more subtle.  In addition to displaying the changes in France over generations, the film reflects on larger questions.  At what point do personal relics, a desk, a vase, a display case used as a kind of closet, become cultural artefacts?  To whom can art belong?  What is the connection between usage and display value of an artwork?  What makes it art, after all?

I caught this during its theatrical release, but am very happy to hear it is being released by Criterion.  The look is stunning and it would be a shame to see it released in a way that doesn't do justice to its imagery.

Here's what to expect on the Criterion disc:

-New high-definition digital transfer, supervised by director Olivier Assayas and approved by Assayas and cinematographer Eric Gautier (with DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack on the Blu-ray edition)
-New video interview with Assayas
-Making-of documentary featuring interviews with Assayas and actors Charles Berling and Juliette Binoche, and showing the cast and crew on set
-Inventory, an hour-long documentary by Olivier Gonard, shot partly in Paris's Muse d'Orsay, that examines the film's approach to art

3597287,4,B001G6UPFM,"This beautiful film is about family relationships and the manner in which they change over time as family members form new attachments and loyalties. It is about two brothers and a sister who visit their elderly mother, Helene, in the final years of her life and how they resolve the distribution of her estate after she dies. The issue is complicated in that Helene was the favored niece, and possible lover, of a relatively famous artist and thus objects found in the estate my have art historical significance, or sentimental significance, or both. Helene's oldest son is sentimental and wishes to keep the estate intact and as a refuge for family members. His younger sister and brother have developed lives elsewhere and the value of the estate will allow them to live more secure comfortable lives. Thus a family dynamic around memories, wealth, sentimentality unfolds in a careful, sensitive, moving manner that reminds us all that life moves on and we must move with it. I found the film to be very authentic in that the issues explored were real, possibly reflected in many homes and families as they struggle to reconcile differences in values while honoring each other's choices and commitments. The film is driven by character development in a realistic setting rather than by a suspenseful or witty plot. Watching it is as if you already know the plot and you already know the characters for you have experienced them in your own life. This gives the film a warmth and intimacy that is rare.",1264982400,2,1504,4.856031128404669
3597288,3,B001G6UPFM,"Though I agree with the other reviewers here on Amazon, the movie is beautifully filmed and contains finely nuanced portrayals of a family at a crossroads, there's still not much of a story here, and I found my attention wondering at times.  I kept waiting for more to happen.  In lieu of a more complicated plot, I looked for some moral or message being conveyed to the viewer, but there's no strong point being made either.  It's not difficult to relate to the situation this family finds itself in, but almost too true to life, there's no big drama here, and life continues on for the living.",1263859200,,595,4.542056074766355
3597289,5,B001G6UPFM,"Seventy-five year old Helene is a widow living in a gorgeous cottage in the French countryside.  We meet her during a visit from her three grown children, and it's obvious that she does not get to see them very often.  We find out that she is the niece of a famous French artist, and she has devoted her life to preserving his place in the art world.  In fact, she is so dedicated to him that she hasn't changed the house he left to her, and she has kept as many of his works of art (as well as a collection of other's works) as she could.  She talks to her oldest son about what will happen when she is gone; he tries to assure her that the children want to keep the house and preserve the art collection.  However, she has her doubts.

""Summer Hours"" is a uniquely French movie that was commissioned by the Musee d'Orlay (which figures prominently in the plot).  Directed by Olivier Assayas (""Irma Vep""), this sensitive almost delicate movie works on so many levels.  On the surface, the film explores the struggle that often ensues between siblings and family members after the death of a loved one.  What do you do with all their stuff?  In this case, some of the ""stuff"" is very valuable, which complicated the scenario.  Anyone who has experienced the death of an elderly relative and seen the friction that can result when dividing up their ""stuff"" will surely relate.  On another level, we can see Helene's struggle to let go of what she has spent an entire lifetime valuing.  She understands that she cannot burden her children with the unenviable task of carrying on her uncle's legacy.  This part of the film is gut-wrenching and so beautifully nuanced.  Ultimately, the movie attempts to tackle the permanence of important art versus the relative impermanence of objects valuable only for sentimental reasons.  ""Summer Hours"" subtly explores these important topics without ever being heavy-handed or obvious

A number of wonderful French films were released in 2008 to great acclaim, including ""A Christmas Tale,"" ""The Class,"" and ""I've Loved You So Long.""  This film is every bit as good - a tremendously beautiful film that should be treasured.  Although released in France in 2008, ""Summer Hours"" premiered in the U.S. in 2009, allowing it to be considered for this awards season.  So far, several critics' societies (LA, Boston, and New York) have named it the best Foreign Film, and USAToday include it in their Top Ten films of the year.  I hope that the film will be recognized by the Academy Awards and move beyond the art houses.",1262390400,5,2550,4.685393258426966

The 2008 French release 'Summer Hours' is a reflective, sensitive film that examines the interpersonal dynamics between people and possessions following the death of the family matriarch. Three siblings and there families must decide what is to be done with the many art treasures left behind by there well-to-do Mother. Most importantly what is to become of her beautiful home with it's luxurious gardens still echoing with the laughter of many shared memories of family gatherings through the years. Should the estate remain in their hands to be used as the site where future family memories can be made, or has the time come to let go of the past to look elsewhere for the comfort of hearth and home.",1256083200,5,741,4.928
3597291,4,B001G6UPFM,"At 75 years old, Helene, (Edith Scob), has left express instructions to her three adult children on what to do with her vast collection of valuable art and country home when she dies. She is also wise to realize her wishes may not be met, foreseeing her children's indifference to her beloved collection, and their own global routine of daily living, which won't include the care and upkeep of a lovely and rustic French country home rich in familial history. She tells all this to her children during her 75th birthday get-together, as if leaving them to choose between the lady or the tiger.

For anyone forced to deal with a deceased parent's estate, director Olivier Assayas' examination of the cycle of life in one French family will strike a nerve of gentle guilt. While the matriarch is alive, the three adult children have no intention of disrupting the generational passing of precious heirlooms, but upon her death, the impracticality of maintaining a country home and possessing museum quality artwork transposes itself. With a degree of reluctance they free the past and embrace the future, not greedily, but with a strong sense of family pride.

This is a quiet film, more a slice of life than story. The inanimate artwork and home furnishings breathe as much life as the characters; an ancient sculpture in restoration during a tour of the museum where the children will donate much of the artwork exudes, nearly glows with the expression of all that had fondled or looked upon it. The cast has a breezy natural style revealing layers of conflicting emotions - guilt and reverence, sadness and happiness, security and doubt, especailly Charles Berling as the oldest son and Dominique Reymond as his wife, who later view the mother's possessions displayed in a museum. It's cold, he says or something to that effect of his mother's once practical furnishings - it has no life, no purpose.

3597292,2,B001G6UPFM,"THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE MOVIE ""SUMMER HOURS"" (L'heure d't).  It's rather late to be posting this commentary, but it might be useful to anyone who missed the screening and is thinking of renting it or buying the DVD.  This oeuvre was another in a series that the film critics seem to have skipped, but nonetheless write about as if they had seen it, repeating the same things that the distributor has written for the press, which is basically a synopsis of the movie. Their comments are repetitive and leave nothing to the imagination. You can read them everywhere, The New Yorker, The San Francisco Chronicle, The San Jose Mercury-News. And to that extent, they are accurate.  Summer Hours is skin deep, and  fairly predictable. Everything is staged for maximum eye appeal, with no rough edges. Yet it pretends to be naturel. Again we are treated to the usual cast of ""normal French people"": the secret lover of a great artist (their story is only talked about in gossipy terms), the ""fashionable designer-consultant"", ""the handsome young globe trotting Nike shoe executive charged with expanding the business in La Chine"", the brilliant, self-effacing economiste-intellectuelle whom we see criticized by another intellectuelle during a radio interview. And lest you think everything is just divine in these people's lives, the daughter of the economiste is picked up by the cops for shoplifting and possessing weed. The benignly paternal police let her, and him off with a warning. On the way home, the modest economist-father gently interrogates the daughter about the company she's been keeping, in bed and otherwise. Oh! those naughty French! Have I spoiled anything? Go see this if you want to sop up some of that whispy nostalgie intellectuelle , the precious gardens, the country home, the objets d'art, the product placements (I think Renault bankrolled this movie, with some help from the Musee d' Orsay.) But don't say I didn't warn you!",1248480000,9,1946,5.03416149068323
3597293,3,B001G6UPFM,"I tend to read ""French"" in the description of a film and then overlook everything else about the film. I should remember to do as much research into a French film as any other.

""Summer Hours"", stars Juliette Binoche, Charles Berling and Jeremie Renier as siblings who bring their families to visit their mother/ grandmother at her country estate every summer. Mother takes her oldest son (Bierling) aside to give him her normal talk about her death and what he should do with all of the artworks and valuable objects in her house, annoying him enough to cause him to walk away. But she dies shortly after and the siblings have to deal with the estate and their past disagreements.

""Summer Hours"" written and directed by Olivier Assayas (""Irma Vep"") is, initially, an interesting film. An extremely meditative look at the relationship between the siblings and their mother, this depth provides the interest, holding our attention for a while.

But as the film progresses, it becomes episodic. And slow, repeating the themes over and over again.

The film opens with the entire clan invading grandmother's house in the country. The housekeeper seems a little overwhelmed, trying to keep the grandchildren from destroying the house, but she has been with the family for years, so she is used to the yearly invasion. Grandmother seems to welcome the activity, but becomes a little put out when she starts to open the gifts they have brought. Later, she corners her son and starts to give him a rundown of all of the valuable pieces in the house. He quickly becomes irritated; he has heard this before and doesn't like to hear her talk about death. There also seems to be friction between grandmother and her daughter (Binoche) who lives in America. The youngest son and his wife live in China, where the son runs a factory for Puma. Grandmother seems to be able to talk of little else other than her famous Uncle, a painter who will soon have a retrospective in San Francisco. Daughter tries to connect with her mother over this, but their appears to be too much bad blood, too much history.

This segment goes on for a while, and introduces us to each of the main characters in the story. When the various families leave, grandmother sits down and enjoys the peace and quiet. There is a slow fade to black and then we watch as the siblings gather for their mother's funeral. There are some interesting moments as we witness their grieving and how they start to deal with the loss of their mother. Then the conversation turns to the estate.

After some conversation, it seems like the estate becomes the only reason for the film to exist. This is what starts conversations between them. This is what drives the narrative; such as it is, forward. Maybe this is the point. Perhaps we are supposed to realize these siblings are not very close and only come together when they have to deal with family issues. This is made very clear, very quickly, yet we keep returning to it, we keep watching various scenes meant to illustrate this. It becomes repetitive.

Each time the image faded to black, I was ready for the film to end, but it quickly faded back and another chapter unfolded. This wouldn't be a bad method of storytelling, but the narrative doesn't really seem to move forward on a consistent basis.

And Binoche disappears for a lot of the film. The film really stars Charles Berling. He does a remarkably good job of playing the older brother, the patriarch of the family. You can see the weight of the world resting heavily on his shoulders and now that he is the only sibling living in France, he has to deal with their mother's affairs. His relationship with his wife and teenage daughter helps to break up the monotony of the rest of the story, giving us a glimpse into life in modern France.

But just as the relationship between the older son and his wife becomes interesting, a subplot about the Musee D'Orsay taking possession of some of their mother's pieces takes over the narrative. Really? This is interesting for a few moments, but when we sit in on a committee meeting while various French officials begin to debate whether the family deserves a tax credit against the inheritance tax, I began to tune out. Again.

""Summer Hours"" has an interesting germ of an idea buried within the film. But a lot of extraneous detail and dialogue make it almost inaccessible to the audience.",1245715200,18,4396,4.697402597402597

To Frederic, the only one of Helene's three children that still lives in France, she insists upon talking about what to do with the house and its considerable artistic contents after she is gone. After all, she's devoted much of her life to keeping the memory of her uncle, a famous French artist-collector, by preserving this house with his works. Frederic assures her it will be so, for he too wants to keep the house for future generations. But Jeremie lives in Beijing making sneakers and Adrienne lives in New York; they admit that they are likely never to return to France, and that they care nothing for the house. They need the money from the estate sale. After Helene dies and the contents are auctioned to collectors and museums, we're shocked to see the obvious, that a vase lovingly filled with fresh flowers by the house keeper Eloise becomes an inanimate object in a museum. In some significant way the house made a home for the family, but now it is gone.
