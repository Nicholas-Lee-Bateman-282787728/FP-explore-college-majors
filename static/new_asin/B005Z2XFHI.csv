Like him I don't like writing reviews but just had to. This DVD is such a let down, if you've read scar tissue you'll know that a lot of what the commentators are saying is actually false. It barely even dives into what is, in my opinion, one of the most incredible musical journeys ever. It's also an unauthorized DVD, which I wish I knew before I bought it, and it's pretty obvious right away why it's unathorized; it's terrible. I'm all for art and I'm sure the people who made this are fans but seriously it is a 1/5 stars. Please save yourself the money, if you want to really learn about them, watch behind the music, or even better read Scar Tissue.",1383782400,,807,4.281045751633987
8489424,1,B005Z2XFHI,"I ordered this dvd hoping to learn more about my favorite band; to have something that I could watch from time to time. However, this DVD is sooooo boring, I watched for maybe first ten minutes and I decided that it is completely waste of time. It is like you are watching documentary on subject that you have no interest in; I was expecting something lot more fun for a documentary about such a crazy rock band. I wish I could return this because it is totally waste of money.
I do not like to write reviews because I don't want to misguide people- something that is boring to me may be very interesting to somebody else so I like to keep my opinions for myself- but I was so disappointed with this video that I just had to write something.
5 stars for the amazon though- I ordered this DVD together with "" an oral/visual history by RHCP "" (great book by the way), shipping was super fast!!",1345939200,2,891,4.27810650887574
