8011679,3,B0001EKM8K,"In keeping with my ""31 Reviews for 31 Days of Halloween"" review marathon, here's a really obscure slasher-film from the late '80s. I found this in its entirety on Youtube so you don't have to go searching everywhere for the VHS of it. Overall, this was a pretty decent slasher film. The plot was minimal and the way they chose to end it will make you shake your head and put your face into your palm. However, there were a few good gore scenes, the setting was excellent and was a pretty powerful thing, underlining the feeling of isolation. It was also nice to watch the development of the relationship between Gerald and Lillian, among the other detailed social mini-plots throughout the movie. Finally, despite a rather half-brained ending, the twist thrown in at the end was exciting and pretty brilliant! Good for watching once or twice maybe. Thanks for the time and peace.",1318204800,4,879,4.714285714285714
8011680,3,B0001EKM8K,"Hard to really recommend this, but if you are like me and love those 80's watered down slashers like Humongous, The Final Terror and such then pick this up.

Not much blood, nudity and partying teens- staples of the genre- but we have an axe wielding killer, nice mystery and a cheesy end credits theme song (that all of those 80's slashers seem to have).",1181088000,2,355,4.461538461538462
