5295037,5,B0099PW0UU,I found these DVDs to be very helpful for my shoulders & hips. I have not done the core DVD yet but judging by they others I'm sure it will be awesome. Been trying to do the shoulders on 2x a week as is suggested by Miller.  Seems to be keeping my shoulders more in place than they have been. Chiropractor said they are better in alignment. I would def recommend these for people willing to put in the work for self healing.,1364428800,10,424,4.108433734939759
5295038,5,B0099PW0UU,I bought this for my wife who is probably an intermediate type of Yoga person.  She loves it.  She likes the variety and felt her core was benefiting.,1362960000,5,150,4.321428571428571
5295039,3,B0099PW0UU,This video(s) are definitely not for beginners. I've done a few yoga videos over the years and this is probably intermediate plus. If you have back issues this is probably not for you ( I do) or at least be VERY careful with this one. There isn't much of substitutions for the exercises done I doubt I'll ever be able to do some of the moves( these are the moves you go whoa did not know the body could do that!).I tweaked my back out over doing it so everyone be careful and listen to your body. (I didn't :P).,1419811200,3,511,4.12
5295040,5,B0099PW0UU,Love Jill Miller and her Yoga Tune Up series!,1414454400,,45,4.111111111111111
5295041,5,B0099PW0UU,This is an excellent series for someone who is familiar with yoga and has built up some body strength. Jill Miller will help you tweek those small areas that sometimes get overlooked for an overall stronger and more fluid body.,1410393600,,227,4.7
5295042,4,B0099PW0UU,"I reviewed one of her dvd's prior to purchasing the set. She is definitely a yoga master. Some of the exercises are difficult, the exercise sessions are about an hour each ( which is too long for me), and I didn't have all of the equipment I needed to begin with which was frustrating. But overall if a person practices these exercises regularly I am sure they will benefit greatly, With one session my hips felt better.",1396224000,,420,4.467532467532467
5295043,5,B0099PW0UU,"This is a great series.  I have owned it for a year and can say that it is easy to follow and as with all Hatha Yoga, the concentration is on breath and strength.  I have hip and lower back issues and some of the poses are so freaking symptom relieving I want to do them all day.  I highly suggest you do not skip through the 90 minute Core Primer section, the instructor gives you all the rationale and specific instructions needed to get it right.  I think the first time you do it you will know why - every muscle in your body is engaged! Yoga is not something one should ever try to do by the seat of their pants - you can seriously injure yourself.

I am also inclined to say that this may not be for people who are not already familiar and flexible - i.e.; first try beginners.  Although a lot of the poses have compensated levels, I could not imagine properly engaging in the poses with limited flexibility.

I enjoy Jill Miller's style and her knowledge.  She is very good at explaining why's and how's and gives great advice!",1394064000,3,1034,4.239795918367347
5295044,1,B0099PW0UU,"These dvds are not functional, but unfortunately I did not open them until the return date had expired. Be careful.",1379894400,,115,4.8
5295045,5,B0099PW0UU,"This was really helpful. I have pain on lateral sides of hips (piriformis?) and weak inner thigh muscles (probably from sitting at a desk). The unconventional moves in these dvds help to alleviate some of the discomfort and strengthen the muscles. I tend to overuse the same muscles when I do yoga, so these DVD's were helpful b/c they reach other muscles. Very professional filming too.",1379289600,2,387,4.878787878787879
5295046,4,B0099PW0UU,"I am a yoga instructor and adore JM.  Though there are a couple moves I neither do, nor will I teach from this series.  I find that they could compromise existing injuries. That said; if you are tuned in, your body will tell you ""nope"", bad idea, if you approach this slowly (use the pause button if necessary).  However; that being said, most of the poses are innovative and enlightening.  Focusing on new things about disconnected places within.  As for the aforementioned ""too much"" poses, most normal range of motion people won't even come close to the danger zone of injury (if it doesnt exist prior), their range of motion won't allow for extremity.  As always, having a professional to ask regarding your own individual needs is wonderful (even if you yourself are a pro!), outside perspective is great-and a necessity from time to time.  In lue of that, go gently, and, if you are ready for the next intermediate to advanced step in your own work out, check out everything JM has been doing.  she's a breath of fresh air in today's fitness and wellness community.",1379289600,10,1071,4.689839572192513
5295047,4,B0099PW0UU,I like the way the directions were broken down in small parts and then integrated into the workout.  Covered all I expected it to.,1378771200,,130,4.416666666666667
5295048,4,B0099PW0UU,"First - let me state that these are wonderful restorative DVD's for rehabing injuries. I find when I do them, my shoulder and hip injuries feel tremendously better in a short amount of time. I like the core DVD as well - I have no issues there, and it seems to be a good workout. All of these DVD's are about an hour in length, and come with an instructional section as well, which is even longer. You'll want to do that first a couple of times to learn the exercises and about what muscles you are using.

I typically workout first thing in the mornings, and was trying to do these afterwork when my shoulder and hip throbbed after sitting at a desk all day. It's really hard to fit in an hour after work to get all this in. Additionally, it's suggested that you do the hip DVD 5 times weekly, the shoulder 3-5 times weekly, and the core 3-5 times weekly. I'd pretty much have to give up my regular workout routine to fit all this in.

Now, if there were someway of combining the most important elements of all three DVD's into one 45 minute workout - that I would do every night.

I enjoyed the instructor. She gives very detailed instruction and is very knowledgable, yet humorous in her explanations. I will keep these DVD's around and hope to win the lottery so I can quit my job and get to the point where I can do nothing but do yoga four hours a day, and eat organic gluten free,-casein free bon bons for the remainder :-)",1376092800,27,1430,4.25
8538124,5,B0099PW0UU,Tough workout that hits all the spots you need to keep limber. She knows her stuff!,1528588800,,83,4.25
8538125,4,B0099PW0UU,"I LOVE the content of the DVDs, but the sound quality is terrible - it's emitting a low buzz/feedback type sound the whole time?  Anyone else having this issue?  Again, the content itself is stellar and I can't endorse it enough.",1496966400,,229,4.560975609756097
8538126,5,B0099PW0UU,very good dvds,1457308800,,14,4.0
8538127,4,B0099PW0UU,Awesome DVDs but they're very long. I find it difficult to get myself to spend so much time on an isolated muscle group. My shoulders do feel great after the shoulder dvd,1454457600,,170,4.34375
8538128,5,B0099PW0UU,Great,1448064000,,5,5.0
8538129,5,B0099PW0UU,LOVE!!!,1443657600,,7,7.0
8538130,5,B0099PW0UU,Love her work,1428278400,,13,3.6666666666666665
8538131,5,B0099PW0UU,"I knew what i was buying. I had already barrowed it from the library and done the workouts. She is sharp as a whip in her job. Each move is designed to target a specific muscle and joint. By the end of the workout you feel light as feather. She teaches chiropractors and therapists. Which you won't need one, if you do the workout at home. I have had multiple accidents that caused disk and vertebrae issues moderate to severe. I could hardly move my shoulders anymore. I also have hip pains. The workouts open up every tight and locked joint and muscle. This is a tune up workout, no kidding.",1420934400,,593,4.351351351351352
8538132,5,B0099PW0UU,Great videos,1420329600,,12,5.5
8538133,5,B0099PW0UU,"I received the Harmonizing the Hips DVD for Christmas.  I have a desk job and over the years it has wreaked havoc on my lower back and hip flexors. I would say I'm an intermediate yogi, as I have been practicing for about 1-2 years. After my first time through, I'm was hooked!!  I don't think any one class I have ever attended has given me so much relief.  I love that it's focus is strictly on the hips, a target area that my body needs the most.  Some of it was new to me and was a bit of a challenge, but the more I get used to it, the less difficult it will become.  I would recommend this to anyone and everyone. Do what you can and don't worry about what you cannot do.  Doing something/anything is better than doing nothing.  I definitely have less pain after than I did before I started using this DVD and hope to continue to use it multiple times a week. I am excited about adding the Shoulders & Core DVDs to my collection as well.  Thank you, Jill Miller!!",1420243200,,969,4.117021276595745
