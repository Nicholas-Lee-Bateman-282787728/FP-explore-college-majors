As to the DVD offered here- I can't say much because it hasn't arrived here yet and at 154 minutes a lot of programming has obviously been eliminated so I've set my expectations low. I would have much preferred a complete season offerring rather than someone else's idea of ""Best of....""",1217289600,8,553,4.711340206185567

3161904,5,B0016OCTT4,"Beware of handicap street parking, they are DESIGNED to trap you.  Especially the one on Race and Juniper street. (you can type this in google map and see this on street view)

1. placed in the middle of REGULAR parking spaces
2. NOWHERE close to any entrances or buildings, what sane Handicapped person would park there?.
3. no curb cutdown or blue paint on curb to suggest its a handicap space.
4. the word 'Handicap' or 'reserved for handicapped only' does not show on the sign...alot of people blame it on the motorist because they don't read it...all the handicap sign had was a small 3 "" x 3"" SYMBOL of a person in wheel chair placed far below the time limits sign, and about the same size as the width of the pole..., it does not say for handicapped only, it is only a picture...absolutely no words that says its handicapped parking on the sign...so i did read the sign, i got the proper stub for the time i was there, and placed it faced up and on the curb dash side (i even read the fine print on the stub about this) but i missed the SYMBOL of the person in the wheel chair....(its small, it was dark...read it a few times and really didn't see it at all...thought my car was stolen because i was so sure i did everything right. .)
5. its a trap...if you visit philly, just park in a lot, probably will end up paying less.  Many of the small handicap symbol is placed below another sign you won't see it when you are busy reading the sign.

anyways, after watching parking wars and seeing how they work, i don't feel so bad because now I know they carefully designed the parking system to issue as many tickets as possible and chalk up as much fines as possible.",1427500800,2,1672,4.298412698412698

3161907,5,B0016OCTT4,"The most outrageous, funny reality show. See how ignorant people can be when they park illegally and get a ticket. Watch a mean-spirited lady get angry because she got a ticket for parking next to a hydrant, then insists on following the meter person around demanding she give out tickets to others. They had to threaten her with arrest for harassment!!.

Rodney, Ponytail, Cheryl, Richie V, and all the other Parking enforcement officers are amazing at their jobs.

The 2nd have of the show is people whose cars have been impounded and they're trying to get them back. People have $1000 and upwards of $2500 in parking tickets and don't understand why their cars have been impounded. Some don't have registrations, insurance, drivers licenses, etc. and they yell, scream, curse, threaten and everything in between to the clerks trying to help them.

Towing & booting - HILLAREOUS! People jumping on the hoods of their car so it can't be towed. This one 20 yr old was so out of control they had to call the people. She was screaming (and I mean SCREAMING) at the top of her lungs the whole time. She got right in the towers face with spittle coming from her mouth, she grabbed the strap that secures the tires to the tow bar and broke it. She was a nut case with a capital N. Why? Because all residents of the complex must have a parking sticker on their windshield and she didn't have one. She thought that didn't matter because she's lived there for 5 years and there was no reason to tow her care - even though the apartment manager called the tow company.

It's just such fun to see different cities from the perspective of people who are walking around keeping things moving!  They show people ticketing cars, booting them and also the impound lot.  Some people will try absolutely ANYTHING to get out of paying their tickets!  I mean, no one loves a parking ticket but the officers they feature have such great personalities they really make the show fun to watch.  I love the crews who are out there day after day.  They each really love the city they work for and maybe that's why it's such a great show.  It really is a great show and very different than a lot of the other mindless things out there.
