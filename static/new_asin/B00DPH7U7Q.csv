5841362,3,B00DPH7U7Q,This play was pretty good and more women should have more support systems. I wish men would have support systems like this lol. maybe we wouldn't be so grumpy.,1387497600,,159,4.517241379310345
5841363,5,B00DPH7U7Q,"This film is a stage play. It is a must see for all women. It is funny and it relates real talk about, marriage, dating and sex. It is rated PG. I really cared for all of the main characters and it sent a clear message of the power of a relationship with God without being preachy. Robin and Clifton are not the main characters but they are good. The acting is good and the script is realistic. Highly recommended!",1385510400,,414,4.1875

This is not a movie. This is a stage play. It's nice to watch a theatrical performance in the comfort of my home, but it would have been a better viewing experience if the camera hadn't been on the audience at times. I didn't need to see their reactions; I'd rather stay focused on what's happening on stage.

I liked Sunday Banks and Sister Jones; however, Sasha (the wayward member) kept my attention more than any other character. I wasn't happy with her choices or the way she treated her sister, Sunday, but then I heard her story and I understood. I forgot for a moment that we all have issues, no matter how small, and that there's always a root cause. I forgot for a moment that past hurts are usually behind negative patterns of behavior. So again, I understood, but it still didn't excuse how disrespectful Sasha was towards her sibling.

The most important aspect of this stage play is that it deals with domestic violence, a serious issue that needs to be addressed. The most touching part was when the women shared their stories.

Favorite Line: I don't hate. I congratulate and I celebrate.",1385164800,2,1192,4.6084905660377355
