5681957,4,B00BY8DJW8,I have had an old beat up print of this movie for years and while Fox's print of it has not been restored it is still much better quality than what has been floating around the gray market. This is from the Fox archives which is made on demand burned not a pressed DVD. If you love these old mysteries and I do then you will enjoy watching this late at night with the lights out. Younger audiences probably won't find much here but if you are of a certain age and grew up watching old mystery movies on television you will enjoy this.,1379203200,6,534,4.144230769230769

5681960,4,B00BY8DJW8,"This show was okay. It wasn't as funny as some of Milton Berle's others, but, it has Willie Best in it and I loved to watch him. He was obviously a comedic genius and, in my opinion, did not receive enough credit for it. Every time I see a movie starring Willie Best, I buy it.

5681961,3,B00BY8DJW8,"As far as the movie goes it is OK. I don't get into telling people the story of the movie, however if you are looking for a ghost movie forget it. It is all humor, great humor at that. Good picture and sound. By the way Willie Best is in this one and as always he is very funny. He was in a class all his own.",1368576000,12,309,3.626865671641791
5681962,4,B00BY8DJW8,"For those who can never get enough of Lucien Ballard's photography in UNDYING MONSTER, the best black and white in horror film history, at long last Fox has given us WHISPERING GHOSTS. They apparently had to dig deeply in the vaults and only surfaced with a somewhat hot positive but this seldom seen comedy has never looked better. You can throw away your boot leg. There is one lie that needs correcting; ""I'm not that good an actor."" Yes you were, Willie Best. And better than the one's you acted with. Bob Hope knew that!",1366934400,20,525,4.536842105263158
8575408,4,B00BY8DJW8,"Honestly, Willie Best steals the show again.  He does not get the lines or strong interaction with the main character like with Bob Hope in ""The Ghost Breakers"" or Wayne Morris in ""The Smiling Ghost."" But, he manages to steal the show in this one.  Milton Berle's lines do fall flat as others have mentioned, but I could easily see the lines being hilarious had they come from Bob Hope or Wayne Morris.  The interaction was so similar to Willie Best and Bob Hope in ""The Ghost Breakers,"" I could have seen it being a follow-on movie to ""The Ghost Breakers.""  On the whole, the story is interesting with many of the same characters actors you see from a lot of these movies - Arthur Hohl (Sherlock Holmes movies), Milton Parsons (Charlie Chan movies, many Monogram pictures, etc.).",1489276800,,780,4.630434782608695

8575414,5,B00BY8DJW8,"This is really good.  I was afraid it might be a little hammy with Milton Berle but it wasn't, he was good, Willie Best was really good. This is an all around enjoyable fun movie. It does make you wonder why people kept choosing to go to an old derelict ship in the middle of the night. But then it wouldn't be as fun in the daylight.",1410825600,,334,3.985074626865672
8575415,4,B00BY8DJW8,"Ok early 40's comedy/mystery starring Milton Berle in a role that Bob Hope could and had done before, and better.  I'm not knocking Berle, he's not bad here.  Willie Best comes off better in his usual subservient manservant role that understandably would make some people uncomfortable, (but those were the times).  Aside from all that the story is about a young woman who inherits a rusting old ship that is crawling with ghost and loads of creeps looking for treasure.  The quality of the DVD-R release is pretty good.  Recommended.",1408147200,,534,4.888888888888889

8575417,3,B00BY8DJW8,"As a few others have already stated here, Willie Best was something of an unsung hero in the history of African American actors.  While some people these days may view his many similar roles--valet, manservant, butler, etc.--as subservient, the fact is he was often funnier than the stars of the films in which he appeared.  This is certainly the case with ""Whispering Ghosts,"" in which pretty much EVERY supposedly-funny line delivered by headliner Milton Berle falls flat.  The plot is standard b-movie mystery/comedy shenanigans, with able assistance from John Carradine and Brenda Joyce (who is a bit underused, but looks lovely).

Be warned that the print used here hasn't undergone any specific restoration, and as such, it looks a bit soft compared to other films of the same vintage that have been cleaned up.  Nevertheless, A/V quality are perfectly acceptable, especially if you are a fan of the film and can overlook the less-than-pristine transfer.  I'd recommend this for  Willie Best fans, or hardcore Milton Berle fans.  It probably wouldn't be a bad warm-up to more enjoyable Halloween fare like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Abbott-and-Costello-Meet-Frankenstein/dp/B0049B8SLE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein</a>&nbsp;or Willie Best co-starring with Bob Hope in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ghost-Breakers/dp/B00005UMF5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ghost Breakers</a>.",1381449600,14,1515,6.577889447236181
