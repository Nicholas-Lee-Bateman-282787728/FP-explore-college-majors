The whole cast is great, and the story helps us understand the plight of Cubans who feel compromised by the country's philosophies.  It ought to make us, as U.S. Americans, appreciate our freedoms.",1407196800,,256,4.930232558139535

8601218,5,B00E4V08GW,"Not only a beautifully executed movie, but a valuable lesson on the dangers of socialism. Watch it to see how the Cuban political milieu resembled what's currently happening in America under Obama. The sycophantic Castro supporters attacked anyone who disagreed with them, egging the houses of the defector's parents. The Cuban musicians were not allowed to play jazz because it was the ""music of the enemy"". They were forced to tow the government line or lose their gigs. The character of Arturo Sandoval's wife expresses how she LOVED Castro until he executed a popular general, buying the whole socialist collective ""promise"". Arturo (Andy Garcia) knew before anyone in his family did, having seen his father's mechanic garage taken from him for the state and leaving him to play dominoes for the rest of his life. A valuable lesson wrapped in an enjoyable film.",1390176000,2,865,5.055944055944056
