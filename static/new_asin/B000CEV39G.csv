This is my least favorite of what I've bought from them.  (Animal Charm is good place to start.)  This label's offerings are very very cool, and I love that this is put out by them and is part of the fabric of their fringe/experimental/cultural dvd oddities.  Maybe I expected too much from this afro/blaxsploitation trailer compilation.  Appreciate having the disc.",1195603200,,512,5.035714285714286
