8361737,4,B002BO2R4A,"What I like most about PBS is that it has far less political affiliation than the big guys like MSNBC and Fox News. What we have here is an almost hour-long documentary on the cause of and response to the financial meltdown that we're still dealing with now.

Understand that this is basically a summary. It is not an exhaustive source by any means as a lot more went into the financial crisis than what could be covered in a PBS special. This is a good place to start however.",1309219200,,477,4.3

A too-narrow, though quite comprehensible, one-hour look-see at the 2008 Financial Meltdown.

The hour starts just prior to Mo/09/15/2008, when Lehman Bros. declares bankruptcy--and ends on We/02/11/2009, when all the investment-house & bank CEOs are called in for a tongue-lashing by the House Financial Services Committee. The viewer's understanding of pre-Lehman events is presumed.

Basically here's what (little) this Frontline episode will teach you:

* Paulson (Treasury) told CEO Ken Lewis (BoA) to absorb Merrill. No stranger to acquisitions, Lewis is tickled pink. Paulson says do it immediately, without taking time for due diligence, to offset the pending bad news about Lehman.

* When credit, banks and markets freeze up anyway, Paulson is finally cured of his life-long academic delusion that unconstrained free markets magically optimize and perfect everything in sight. So Paulson runs to Congress hat-in-hand and then ram-rods TARP money (and government control) down the banks' throats.

* When Lewis learns just how toxic Merrill is, he wants out, but Paulson says no. Lewis' stockholders want answers; he finds a scapegoat and distraction in Merrill CEO John Thain and the huge executive bonuses Thain negotiated into the deal.

* Then Lewis follows through on his swing by canning Thain.

* The hour ends with several rants on how America's banks have been nationalized - even though many of the banks are even now arranging to pay back TARP money, so as to be rid of any government influence/control.

This production's best recommendation is that, somehow, the producers got a number of key players on camera - Lewis and Thain the most notable and Paulson the most notably absent - each sharing their perspective on just how it all went down. Without their vignettes, there's not much 'telling' found here.

8361739,5,B002BO2R4A,"It began to unravel in September 2008, in the same month that President Bush announces the fundamentals of the economy are still strong.

Investment firms and banks are about to collapse like a stack of dominos as Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Paulson attempts to stop the economic hemorrhaging. But his bandages of mergers, TARP agreements, and takeovers unravel as the details of the meetings, mergers, arm-twisting, and deals become public. Congressional hearings, stockholder fury, and disclosures take their toll as one CEO after the other is thrown under the bus of an outraged public. A new administration marks the end of the party, as bankers knew it.

Frontline delivers with interest, as usual. Written and directed by Michael Kirk, the banking crisis is distilled into incremental deposits of factual information that give the viewer a chronological account of events that went on in the boardrooms and the floor of the stockmarket. Jim Gilmore's voice is perhaps the best in the business, and it is always a pleasure to listen to him narrate.

There is a reason that ""Frontline"" is one of the best and most informative programs on television. After you see this, you'll know why. You will not only be entertained, but perhaps, better informed.

The cost is certainly worth it, and it shouldn't break the bank.",1272585600,10,1325,5.036529680365297
8361740,5,B002BO2R4A,"This is a very informative, well produced program  on the financial slide that occurred on Wall Street, which lead to the Federal Bailout. No pundits, no lies or yelling, this program is straight information that tell the facts.  Even non-bankers will understand this excellent Frontline program.",1269388800,4,296,5.413043478260869
8361741,1,B002BO2R4A,"This is quite possible the worst piece ever done by Frontline. Practically no reporting involved on what was really happening that brought down the banking industry, and to make matters worse, ends with a quip by E. Warren about how all the glory days of banking are gone. Granted when this was produced, it was probably early in 2009, but by the June 2009 air date, could she be more wrong? Incredibly disappointing. This story isn't over yet.",1249948800,2,444,4.705128205128205
