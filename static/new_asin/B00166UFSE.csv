3152488,5,B00166UFSE,"I've been waiting for this DVD to come out for years now. first of i'm glad that they didn't do no funky editing like the nu nation tour DVD the concert is off the hook yolanda is sangin' her you know what off, Donnie did his thing and kirk wow i love when he does medley  of his songs and he didn't dissapoint the arrangements the harmony is sick, i forgot the womens name playing the violin but she is awesome this is a must have DVD",1218067200,8,435,4.0
3152489,5,B00166UFSE,"Let me say, this is my 1st review.  I never review anything even though I make many online purchases.  This was so good, I had to write one.  I am a christian woman that falls WAY short of the glory.  I  watched this with my husband and my 7 year-old son last night.  All three of us truly enjoyed it.  The singers, musicians, the messages--nothing short of perfect--God's hand was all over it.  There were different times when my husband and I were touched to the point of tears.  God is amazing.  This DVD is truly wonderful.  I don't even know what to say because words cannot express how good this is.  You would be cheating yourself of God's gift to you through this DVD if you don't watch this for yourself.  You would think I got paid for doing this review!",1217894400,23,764,4.295774647887324
3152490,3,B00166UFSE,Purchased this DVD because it sounded innovative.  It is!  A great way to spread the gospel to all ages in the family.,1386806400,,118,4.318181818181818
3152491,5,B00166UFSE,"The story of three childhood friends pledging to each other what they plan to do with their lives in changing the world to make it a better place as they do things a little different.  If you know anything at all about the artist on the cover of this DVD, you have to investigate their different way to praise the Lord with their music.  As I listened to the music, I had to get up and represent my self to the Lord! Their music and singing was so powerful that I could not be still.  I could feel spirit of the Lord through their singing, music and body expressions.  I wanted to be baptized all over again!  The really good part is when I want to be spiritually uplifted and praise the Lord at the same time, I just put on this DVD anytime I want.  This DVD is perfect for introducing religion to youth because some of songs are produced with todays youthful music format and beat!  I highly recommend this DVD if you have any religion in you.  You will understand that it is OK to express your self if you want to.  You can be happy and serious all at the same time in your worship of GOD.",1373846400,,1092,4.137440758293839
3152492,5,B00166UFSE,"I love every bit of this and was hoping it was a Hopeville 2, thankfull for this one. PRAISE GOD",1369526400,,96,3.85
3152493,5,B00166UFSE,"You cannot appreciate good singing, until you see and listen to this video.  I simply love it.  It is just not singing it is
some good comedy in this video.  Great job.",1360022400,,168,4.1875
3152494,1,B00166UFSE,"First off don't get me wrong I love gospel music, but this was not a play. I thought this was going to be an actual play that you might go to the theater to see but it was not. It was just a mini concert. In the beginning it had a short movie about the Yolanda Adams, Donnie McClurkin, and Kirk Franklin, when they were supposed to young and dreaming about their lives, acting not that great at all, then it was supposedly to come to real time and all I saw was a mini concert. If you are looking for a ""play"" don't waste your money. I was so dissappointed I could not even finish the video.",1328486400,,591,4.016949152542373
3152495,5,B00166UFSE,"I heard about this musical, but couldn't find it. I found it here and it was worth the price. The DVD was in great condition, and I received when promised. GREAT SERVICE.",1316649600,,170,4.34375
3152496,5,B00166UFSE,"I have watched this numerous times, it is very encouraging and well put together. It is so evident God's Holy Spirit is in this without a doubt... great!",1298851200,,153,4.5
3152497,5,B00166UFSE,"I really enjoyed this video!  Donnie, Yolanda, and Kirk all did an excellent job and it was so spirit-filled!  I loved it!",1290038400,,122,4.5
3152498,5,B00166UFSE,"I had heard of the Hopeville tour somewhere around 2003-2004 where Kirk got together w/ many of his friends in the industry and they gave God's name the praise in dance and. It wasn't until recently that I happened upon some clips of the show on Youtube and couldn't help myself any longer--I had to get this DVD! I have always been a fan of Yolanda's testimony through her amazing voice, and Donnie's vocal prowess is unmatched by most singers on either side of the musical scope! Throw in Kirk's flair for the dramatic (he picks up some little girl and kisses her on the cheek while he's hyping up the crowd) and you've got yourself a very entertaining gospel experience.

This DVD is excellent for the whole family, consider a Sunday afternoon after dinner w/ everyone crowded around the tube watching this incredible display of song, dance, testimony & urban praise! I didn't really catch the ""stage play"" aspect of this video--it played out as more of a concert than a typical gospel play. Wait, I slightly take that back. There was the intro where they showed Donnie, Kirk & Yolanda as kids which was entertaining but the kid who played Kirk might have really been...'special'. He was jerking around too much lol...God bless him though =)

Donnie's Psalms Hymns & Spirituals DVD came close, and theatrically, I liked Kirk's The Rebirth of Kirk Franklin DVD a bit more, but you can't beat this gospel experience. I highly recommend this production!! The only thing I wish is that I was actually there when it was being taped!!",1269388800,,1531,4.708955223880597
