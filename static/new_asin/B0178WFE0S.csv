7497901,4,B0178WFE0S,"This wasn't a full on found footage film but the aspect that is, was  cleverly done. The film seems simple enough. American tourists going somewhere off limits or doing something taboo.

In One part of the Panama jungle there is an area that is said to be cursed by the Chupacabra. To make the legend more convincing to most of the locals,many tourists and Panamanians have gone missing and never found due to not heeding the warning

There is some blood and violence but a minimum amount of gore,although all very well done. The acting was good as well. The film also cashes in on the social media based Horror of late by adding a clever plot twist using the internet.  I enjoyed it and found a few scenes really tense , even scary.

The  ceature effects are nicely done giving us enough of the monster to satisfy but not too much as to desensitize us to it. If I had one complaint it would be that they wasted too much time having the characters run around the jungle with flashlights calling out each others names!

But as a whole I thought it was smart and succeeded in what it set out to do. Also the beautiful Panamanian scenery including waterfalls ,beaches and lush jungles are very easy on the eye.",1449532800,12,1207,4.4343891402714934

Poorly developed and annoying characters spend an hour goofing off and the payoff is watching each one of them being picked off one by one in the jungle. There were lots of attempts at ""jump-out-at-you"" scares, which I had thought were easy to do, but this movie shows you there really is an art to it as none of the attempted scares in this movie work.

FYI, Indigenous is a pretty blatant ripoff of the green inferno, which while it's not a fantastic movie, is MUCH better than this one.",1457827200,,541,4.520408163265306

One time I got lost in the El Yunque jungle in Puerto Rico with a friend for hours, it was like the trail disappeared and the ground was very wet and slippery. We eventually found our way out of there but it was the first time in my life I was really afraid of the possibility of spending the night in a jungle without gear. The worst part was being in unfamiliar territory and the possibility of something harming you. This movie hit home for me but at least we didn't have some crazy creature after us !!!!",1457827200,,550,4.101851851851852
7497926,3,B0178WFE0S,"This starts out feeling vaguely reminiscent of The Ruins (2008).  A bunch of 20-somthings go on a Central American vacation and a side-trek goes horribly wrong as they discover the local fauna.  It takes place in the extremely remote Panamanian forest Darien Gap, which is allegedly the reason we can't drive from North America to South America.

They go on a jungle hiking adventure to find a nearby ""secret"" waterfall that the locals warn not to visit.  It's too dangerous.  Why?  It just is.  The real answer: chupacabras.

I have no complaints about the acting or general production value, it all seems up to snuff--decent, in fact.  It seems that this film was trying to make an above-ground version of The Descent (2005) with chupacabras.  The result is moderately entertaining, but it doesn't come close to its predecessor.

From here on, we observe a series of Descent knock-off gimmicks rehashed in lower quality as our 20-somethings are picked off by hairless, albino, blind flesh-eating bat people that squeal like stuck velociraptors whenever they move.  The gore includes a chewed off face, a grotesque leg wound, and various other bloody messes.  It's generally not a very gory movie, but it has its moments.  Eventually our victims wander into a deep network of bat caves complete with offal pits of slimy human bones.  The budget limitations are most apparent when you realize you never see more than one monster at a time.

They did a pretty good job with the characters. I wasn't really rooting for any of them, but they did a great job making the tough guy jock into a scared-shitless mumbling survivor and I wouldn't exactly say I didn't care about them at alljust not as much as I should have.

Director Alastair Orr may not amaze us with this flick, but he demonstrates that he is highly capable of assembling something entertaining even with a highly unoriginal knock-off story, no major actors and a slim budget.  I'm looking forward to seeing what he does next.",1457568000,,1986,4.84272997032641

Obnoxious American tourists go surfing in Panama. (The U.S.' relationship with its client state: From regime change to tourism in three easy steps!)
We start with an idyllic day at the beach (a la Touristas.)
Lots of chicks in bikinis and boys making stupid pathetic sexists jokes.

Then our intrepid tourists hear about this forest that's supposed to be home to some kind of mythical Panamanian monster: Travelers go there an never come out! Woah!
So the kids decide to go there. Who wouldn't?
""When was the last time someone died from a myth,"" one of the dips(bleep) says.

Okay, the film has decent production values for a semi-found-footage film. But that's the only positive thing about it.
The script is lacking in imagination -- even though there are many interesting things that could be done with the premise.

The film in a nutshell: Obnoxious characters running around in circles in a dark forest screaming. They yell and scream -- around creatures that rely more on smell and hearing than sight -- and run around in circles then yell and scream some more then run around in circles ...

I mean the film has NOTHING else. We're talking a 30 minute set up then 60 minutes' worth of people running around. Since the characters are so unappealing and so badly written, we don't give a hoot what happens to them.
.
As for the monsters, well they're ripped off from any number of movies, especially The Descent -- which is what  you should be watching instead.
(Neil Marshall's The Descent and its sequel are both free on Amazon to Prime subscribers.) These are superior film in every way.
Now, they're set in a subterranean cave system in Britain, not in a jungle. Otherwise it's the same idea.

The British films feature great characters played by terrific actors. The intricate cave system makes for an interesting, varied setting and allows for the characters to make an actual journey in search of an exit. They don't run around in circles, .
The first film has an all female cast and instead of yelling screaming crying and generally being loud, like American teenagers, these chicks bear down and try to survive.
For one thing, they actually try to figure out how the creatures sense their surroundings, how they hunt, how they find their prey.
In Indigenous, the characters -- one of whom is studying to be a vet -- don't bother using their heads, just lose them.
So we have a would-be vet who doesn't bother thinking about these predators.
Her bf has developed some facial recognition app -- and I thought the story would eventually make use of it in interesting ways. (The creatures are human-oid. So does that mean they have faces? Were they people before becoming monsters? You see the possibilities.)
But no, this thread was dropped as well.

So there's little here, just a bunch of loud, whining, screaming, crying kids running in circles.

It was well done and actually made me jump on several parts.

On a technical level, ""competently made"" would apply. It's barely better than SyFy CGI fest, in fact I believe almost all SPFX were created via old school practical techniques, so... there's that.",1517184000,,328,4.9818181818181815
8738343,3,B0178WFE0S,"RELEASED IN 2014 and directed by Alastair Orr, Indigenous covers events in Panama when five college-age youths vacation there for some fun in the sun. Things go awry when they visit a beautiful waterfall in a forbidden area of the jungle.

This is a professionally made monster-in-the-forest flick with a competent no-name cast highlighted by gorgeous Panamanian locations and winsome Laura Penuela in a bikini. Precious Lindsey McKeon is another highlight on the female front.

My only problems are that (1.) the plots hackneyed, particularly bringing to mind The Last Tribe (2009), which is marginally better in some ways. Other flicks come to mind, like ""Touristas"" (2007) and The Ruins (2008), which are superior to the other two. (2.) Theres no depth in the plot: This is a monster movie focusing on partying youths getting chased in the forest by savage creatures and thats it. As such, the films not very compelling despite the horror and thrills. On the bright side, the last act throws in an unexpected curve ball and shows that the movie wasn't micro-budget. Another positive is that this is arguably the best and most realistic chupacabra flick out there (keeping in mind that Ive only seen four such movies).

Speaking of which, 'chupacabra' is a Spanish word, which literally means ""goat-sucker"" (from chupar ""to suck"" and cabra ""goat""). There are two varieties of this cryptozoological beast: (1.) a reptile-like creature with leathery/scaly greenish-gray skin and sharp spines or quills running down its back; and (2.) a hairless form of canine with a pronounced spinal ridge and prominent eye sockets, fangs, and claws. Indigenous interestingly features neither of these, although the creatures come closer to the first description, I suppose.

8738344,3,B0178WFE0S,A good time killer. A little slow in the beginning but picks up. I have become a fan of the director. The fx makeup is pretty good.,1502841600,,131,3.888888888888889
8738345,4,B0178WFE0S,"Not as bad as I thought it was going to be! YES... There are moments when you want to fast forward the pace of the movie is so slow, then there are the jump out of your seat scares, and good action/ thriller scenes. it DOES go back and forth between 1st viewer/ documentary style filming and regular filming which they did almost seamlessly. The actors/ actresses are good, nothing seems wooden, the character development is good and the tension is there all through the movie.
The only bad thing about this movie is the darkness, not the movie content which is dark but the actual DARKNESS of the movie. I had to turn up the brightness on my screen all the way and it STILL wasn't bright enough some of the time!",1496966400,,713,4.368421052631579
