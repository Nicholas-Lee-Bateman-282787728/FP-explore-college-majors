3714987,5,B000OYNUKO,This movie was a Thriller. I loved it. It was also funny yet emotional.,1410480000,,71,4.142857142857143
3714988,5,B000OYNUKO,"This movie has been made for years, and it is one of my favorite movies. I like the action, the funny dialogue. But mostly moved by the relationship between Li and his son. They fought together and willing to die for each other. A close analogy is the many description of brotherhood in war movies, except  this is between father and son.  But I can understand that many American viewers would miss that and only saw actions and goofy scenes because of the subtitles.

The title is misleading and could be frustrating if people came to see the Shaolin Founders. I checked wikipedia about """" (see the Chinese characters on the poster), and the correct translation is ""Five *Elders* of Shaolin"", not founders. They are famous in Qing Dynasty. I suspect this is a re-make of an famous old Hong-Kong about the Five Elders, but with a new story line about how Hung Hei-Koon helped them when they were kids. So the title has both elements to drew back the old audience and attract new audience. But when translated to English, and it is misleading.

Anyway, this is one of my favorite movies, and enjoy as much as you can.",1410048000,4,1116,4.565

Add to this some splendid mass fighting, and lots of humor, and I think this one is a winner.",1396137600,,399,4.391891891891892
3714997,4,B000OYNUKO,"Hung Hei-Koon: Shaolin's Five Founders (original title: ""Hong Xi Guan: Zhi Shao Lin wu zu""; a.k.a. The New Legend of Shaolin; a.k.a. Legend of the Red Dragon) is a heck of a mouthful but it's also one of my favorites in Jet Li's body of work. If you're looking for wushu action that's grounded in reality, you'd best look elsewhere. Here, the martial artists observe their own far-fetched laws of physics.

In the time of the repressive Qing government, Shaolin and the Heaven and Earth Association formed secret societies in an attempt to restore the Ming Dynasty. One of the most feared rebel heroes was Hung Hei-Kwun (Jet Li) who one day came home to find his village in ruins, his trust betrayed by an old friend, his family massacred but for his infant son, Man Ting.

Eight years later, the Shaolin Temple is still fomenting revolution. Five Shaolin pupils have their backs tattooed with sections of a map revealing the hidden location of the Ming Dynasty treasure. These five children are forced to go on the run when Qing agents storm the Shaolin Temple.

Elsewhere, Hung Hei-Kwun and Man Ting (Miu Tse) are roving vagabonds, still fugitives from the Qing government. Impoverished and starved, Hung Hei-Kwun hires on as personal bodyguard to a local high muck-a-muck. Sucks then for the pair of confidence artists known as the Notorious Mother and Daughter that had set their covetous eyes on that same high muck-a-muck. Turns out that Miss Red Bean (Chingmy Yau) and her outrageous mom (Deannie Yip) provide tons of comic relief. I like the running gag of the mom having to play dead and holing up in a nearby shed and subsisting on foods Red Bean would sneak in to her. (""My daughter is so nice, she knows I love eating chicken ass."")

This film released in 1994, four years before Jet Li would cross the waters to try to conquer America, or, anyway, its theater box office. And, to be honest, this is the Jet Li I prefer, just as the Jackie Chan I prefer is the one making those Hong Kong movies. I guess I'd rather that they're in their comfort zones, instead of having to (awkwardly) adapt their styles to fit American sensibilities. Unlike Jackie, Jet leans towards the stoic protagonist. And I'm glad he's so restrained here. There's such an offbeat, wacky vibe to the film, and so much slapstick, it's nice to have those elements be offset by Jet Li's somberness.

Mirroring Jet Li's gravity, serious for serious, is his young co-star Miu Tse. Miu Tse is the film's secret weapon, and I can't help but notice the similar look he has to the little boy from Lone Wolf and Cub. Miu Tse is a freakin' little badasss and frequently funny as the very disciplined eight-year-old martial artist. Trivia-heads will note that this is the first of two films in which Miu Tse and Jet Li play a father-and-son tandem, the other being&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Enforcer/dp/B001H5X6PI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Enforcer</a>&nbsp;(original title: ""Gei ba ba de xin""; a.k.a. My Father is a Hero (1995)).

As mentioned, the action beats thumb its nose at the normal laws of physics. Fight choreographer Corey Yuen sure goes kray-kray with the wire-fu. Hung Hei-Kwun happens to be a real-life historical figure, an honest-to-gosh Chinese folk hero. But the story clouds the historical facts with fantasy elements, and the combat sequences reflect this. There's even a touch of anachronism in that the film's disfigured big bad (Chuen-Hua Chi) rolls around in a chrome death car that resembles an armored armadillo. So you, dear friend, will have to develop a suspension of disbelief. If you're looking for a peek into the purity and proper execution of the martial arts forms, well, just keep in mind that moves like the gravity-defying shadow kick and catching darts with your teeth may be a wee bit exaggerated. Thank goodness our hero's weapon of choice is the awesome, deadly, wobbly spear. It's a treat that Jet Li gets to show off his knack for the spear, which I do think is one of the most visually electrifying weapons to watch when wielded by an expert.

I saw this movie on Amazon Instant Video, and I have to agree that it takes a mo to acclimate to how fast the sub-titles pop up and then go. But your eyes should adapt. It's fine. And, me, I vastly prefer the original language to the always clumsy English dub. Reading won't kill you, bro.",1394928000,2,4409,4.847277556440903
