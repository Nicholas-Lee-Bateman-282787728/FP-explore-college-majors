8704496,3,B00U646MQG,"This DVD has 3 parts; The Texas Rangers 47 minutes, The Fathers of Texas 45 minutes, and The Enforcers: The Texas Rangers 42 minutes.
The programs have many narrators, including Kenny Rodgers and many talking heads  experts that know about the history involved. There are hardly any reenactments which would add more interest with the expert narration rather watching a person talk.

The DVD and the history are interesting and educational. We learn that the Comanches could shoot 12 arrows to the 1 shot the Rangers could make until they were equipped with Colt Repeating pistols. However what is extremely irritating when you watch all 3 segments is that there is so much repetition of information  in the same wording and duplication of events. The Ranger history is so full that this was not necessary.",1444867200,2,806,4.955555555555556
