685425,5,6303593178,"Los olvidoados es la pelcula que marco el retorno de Buuel a las grandes ligas cinematograficas. Despues de mas de 20 aos alejado del cine comercial, Los olvidados es la muestra que buuel no es un fosil del surrealismo sino que sabe hacer cine tan contemporaneo como antes. La pelicula tien un ritmo muy marcado y muy bueno. Los personajes estan muy bien construidos y la trama es cruda y real. Es el retrato de una sociedad que preferia vese como un Pedro Infante cantador, que como una jungla en donde todos contra todos para sobrevivir. Buuel muestra que no hay buenos y si muchos malos y que las circunsatancias dictan el pan de cada da. La mejor pelcula Mexicana para un publico profano. Excelente.",982108800,5,703,4.632
685426,5,6303593178,"Luis Bunuel's ""Los Olvidados"" is a true depiction of urban poverty in Mexico City during the mid-twentieth century.  Bunuel does a fantastic job of capturing the speech, slang, and even the mannerisms of  the local youth, and shows these as they involve themselves in a series of  crimes including that grow in severity from theft to murder.  The final  scene, as shocking as it is, sums up the total disregard for human life as  everyone is out for themselves. Haunting and provocative.  ""The  Children of Sanchez"" is a book by Oscar Lewis that complements  Bunuel's film.  Released in 1961, this autobiographical depiction of a  Mexican family really takes you through a powerful journey of poverty and  suffering.",951609600,5,716,5.0256410256410255

685630,3,6303593178,"Where this fits into the history of cinema I have no idea. I get the feeling it is considered a worthy milestone. It is a colourful depiction of both Mexican background and characters, and watchable. Some of the scenes and screenplay may have influenced Huston's last film ""Under the Volcano"" with Albert Finney, and Peckinpah's seedy raw Mexico seems to be an extension of this. But it isn't as good as everybody says while probably being influential.

On the other hand...when will see a film about - from - on Mexico that offers us beauty, human dignity, cultural richness to compare and contrast with its undoubted problems of endemic poverty and disturbing violence? And a certain presumption on the part of Western media (let's face it film is not an art form but a media and is consequently more propaganda and entertainment than anything else) of loose morality which I find repugnant and culturally racist. Surely, Eisenstein's ""Que Viva Mexico!"" coming from a socialist point of view is a far greater film. But THEY wouldn't tell us that now...would they?

685635,5,6303593178,"Los Olvidados ('The Young and the Damned', actually more correctly translated as 'The Forgotten Ones') is the 1950 social realist film that put Luis Bunuel back on the map as a film-maker. Having scandalized middle class sensitivities with the surrealist classics Un chien Andalou (1928) and L'Age d'or (1930) in Paris with Salvator Dali, he made a strange 'documentary' about a dismal Spanish village called Las Hurdes (1932) before vanishing for 15 years. His autobiography 'My Last Breath' (which I highly recommend) has him picking up odd jobs around Hollywood studios and even in MOMA in New York, but we can't really be sure what he did. He eventually fetched up in Mexico in 1946 where he went on to make two inconsequential dramas, Gran Casino (1948) and The Great Madcap (1949) which producer Oscar Dancigers saw. Bunuel already had another script ready, but Dancigers had no doubt seen some of the Italian Neo-realist films of the period like Vittorio De Sica's Bicycle Thieves (1948), Roberto Rossellini's Rome Open City (1945) and Paisan (1946) and maybe even Luchino Visconti's Ossessione (1942) and La Terra Trema (1948). He wanted Bunuel to make a film in the same social realist tradition about the slums of Mexico City. It's very interesting then that without Dancigers Bunuel probably would not have made his crunching study of the poor which took the 1951 Cannes audiences so by surprise and which got Bunuel the Best Director award. I say 'crunching' because the film is a tale of truly horrific dimensions. As Derek Malcolm says in the accompanying introduction with this DVD, watching it is akin to being punched in the guts for 80 minutes without let up, so despicable is the human behaviour Bunuel (and screenwriter Luis Alcoriza) put in front of us.

The film is about a group of destitute kids and their daily lives in a slum. Their leader is Jaibo (Roberto Cobo), a truly nasty piece of work who rejoins his gang after leaving juvenile jail. Aided by Pedro (Alfonso Mejia) he tracks down Julian (Javier Amezcula) who he thinks fingered him. In a scene designed to show the sheer propensity for evil kids have, Jaibo hides a rock in a sling, pretending his arm is broken only to beat his prey to death with it. Pedro is relatively innocent up to this point, but now he is an accomplice to murder and has to shut up to protect Jaibo who goes on to use him throughout the film. Bunuel truly rubs our noses in the sheer horror of everyday slum life here. No character is good in this world of survival at any cost. The gang beat up a blind street musician (Miguel Inclan), but when the man's stick is studded with a rusty nail which he uses to assail his attackers, and when he proves in any case to be a paedophile, it's hard to feel sympathy. The group mug a legless cripple, kicking his support trolley down a hill. Another (this time well dressed) paedophile tries to pick up Pedro. Pedro's mother (Stella Inda) makes clear she hates her son by beating and screaming at him at every chance. She even allows herself to be seduced by Jaibo in a truly toe-curling sequence, and eventually gets rid of her son by sending him to a 'farm school'. Here we meet the film's only truly sympathetic character, the school head (Francisco Jambrina) who starts to show Pedro the way out. Here we have a twist of a Dickensian variety. The head trusts Pedro with money to go and buy tobacco for him. The boy is intent on making good, but Bill Sykes (I mean Jaibo) catches him outside and he is once more mired in slum conditions. Dickens magics up a happy ending for his tale, not so with Bunuel. The ending here is as heart rending as any I have ever seen in the cinema. The sheer pitiless inhumanity is deeply shocking, all the more so as one of the characters involved (the beautiful girl, Alma Delia Fuentes) has been Pedro's closest friend throughout the film.

Italian Neo-realism was based on a desire to throw off the cosy artificiality of Hollywood melodrama. Suddenly the stress was on location shooting, semi-documentary methods, improvised dialog, working class themes, real people working in real places and the idea of poor people being victims of the environment that conditions them. Los Olvidados goes along with most of this. It opens with a voice over declaring the general theme of every city having it's slum area. This is similar to the way La Terra Trema begins for example. Certainly Bunuel does show the truth of environmental conditioning, but there's more to it than that. For Bunuel, people are people beyond the remit of their environment. They all have their own desires, material, sexual or otherwise as shown in two surreal dream sequences (the first portraying Pedro's guilt at being involved in murder and the second having Jaibo being sucked into a hole as he dies) and in the behaviour especially of the mother. Nothing 'conditions' her to hate her son or want to have sex with Jaibo - it's her desire pure and simple. Also lacking in Los Olvidados is the use of children as a mirror to show up the horror that surrounds them - the boy at the end of Bicycle Thieves, the boys who watch the priest's death at the end of Rome Open City. Here the kids are evil incarnate. And they grow up (if they survive that is) to be even worse, if that is possible. There is a harsh pitilessness here which though tempered by short scenes of affection (the girl running milk over her legs and responding to Pedro's gifts, the mother eventually showing concern) is deeply shocking nevertheless. Bunuel's Neo-realism is one of assault and disturbance and it gets to the route of reality much more directly and honestly than even the best of the Italian Neo-realist films.

I notice some reviews here see Los Olvidados as being Bunuel's best. Well, it's certainly one of them, but he did go on to make equally devastating attacks on the world as he saw it in El (1952), The Criminal Life of Archibaldo de la Cruz (1955), Nazarin (1958) and especially (the two films I think are really his greatest works) Viridiana (1961) and The Exterminating Angel (1962). Derek Malcolm relates that Bunuel's biggest regret was that he never made a film in Hollywood. I for one am glad he never did. Softening his critical edge for the sake of 'entertainment', such a prospect would have robbed us of some the greatest films cinema has to offer us. This DVD is very good by the way. The picture is clean, if not completely without blur when the camera pans quickly especially across dark scenes. A 'happy' alternative ending was unearthed and digitalized in 2002, but sadly it hasn't been attached to this DVD as an extra. As it is we only have the said Derek Malcolm introduction which I feel could have been deeper - less clips from the film and more critical analysis would have helped. I bought this for less than a fiver which makes it a sure recommendation.",1411430400,5,6877,4.672442244224422

I watched Los Olvidados from Luis Buuel on TV when I was 7 years of age. It made a huge impact on my life because Los Olvidados is a very deep emotional film about abandoned kids in Mexico City who due their circumstances turn to be criminals. Watching this film as a kid made me realized how insensitive, cruel and heartless a human being could turn into.  I remember having nightmares several days after about the last scene of the movie, probably because I watched it alone with no adult explaining to me the plot. I could never forget this film.
I have a 3 year old now, and I will certainly watch the film with him when the right time comes.  I believe its very important as human beings to understand at a young age the failed results of a society with a very uneven distribution of wealth; it will come back to bite us in the butt, even to the very wealthy ones.",1383004800,9,1081,4.373134328358209

685652,5,6303593178,"This is a true classic, made by visionary film maker, Luis Buuel, who started in 1929 and sadly passed in 1983. During that time he made arguably, some of the best cinema in the world including a Mexican set version of `Wuthering Heights' in 1954. This film was made in 1950 and is set in the slums of Mexico and tells the story of some of the juvenile delinquents. Ostensibly telling the story of Pedro, who gets pulled by his compatriots into wrong doing.

They are utterly ruthless getting involved with robbing a blind man and a paraplegic man simply for his cigarettes. There is the crushing poverty that is shown by the desperation of Pedro's mother who can not show him any love as he is just another nuisance mouth to feed who won't get a job. There is also the story of the little country boy, who has been abandoned by his father but finds some solace with those who take pity on him, he is nick named `Small Eyes' and he is so sweet it is hard to comprehend who  would abandon such a child.

The whole film has a vitality that shines off the screen even after all these years. The actors are all superb and the cinematography a true joy. There were for me reminiscences of `Oliver Twist' at one point or more accurately David Leans film of the book. This was one of the first two films preserved by UNESCO as being of major social importance, the other one was Fritz Lang's `Metropolis', so it is amazing that it is still relatively unknown.

It was received, in its day, very badly being criticised by all corners of society as being unrepresentative of Mexico and just too brutal causing it to be pulled from cinemas after only three days in some instances. Suffice to say it is now recognised as being a brilliant study of poverty and crime and very much a true representation of that time. The fact that it still has the power to shock is a testament to the talent of Bunuel. This was originally thought to be an eight reel film, but recently a ninth reel was discovered that contains the alternative happy ending, which I have not seen. This is for true fans of cinema, artistic, realistic, entertaining and shocking for all the right reasons - an absolute classic.",1370736000,4,2181,4.458646616541353

685654,5,6303593178,"THE FORGOTTEN ONES (translation) is really a powerful film about the children who live in the slums of Mexico.  Roberto Cobo is especally good in his role as a delinquent and later became a real star as a transvestite in Arturo Ripstein's THE PLACE WITHOUT LIMITS.

Director Bunuel shows us the seamier side of life among this small gang of kids, the lascivity of ""old men"" and young women, the exploitation of the ""blind man"" and the mistaken beliefs of idols instead of Christian values. The story is full of deceptions by parents who bring up their children but leave them to pursue their lives in an indifferent and cruel society where death is the only escape.

Filmed on the outskirts of Mexico City, there is a set piece of an unfinished building of a hotel which symbolies the poverty and futility of Mexico's youth of 1950.

685730,5,6303593178,"After a silence of years, Buuel has a new movie: Los olvidados. If this film is compared to those performed with Salvador Dal, surprised all the rigor with which Buuel carried to its extreme limits its first intuitions. For one thing, Los Olvidados represents not only a high point of artistic maturity, but a turning point that wit takes us back to the Hurdes, but then there is a suffocating despair: sleeping doors closed, leaving only that of blood and primitive violence.

Until now, the action described is accurate as clockwork, amazing like a dream and unforgiving as the silent march of the lava. In this film, the blood, horror, hatred, desire, desilussion, death, hopeless and wickedness twin themselves. Such is the weight of his realism, which finally seems unbearable, because that's the reality in nature, wild and unforgiving where justice, forgiveness, redemption and mercy are absent, as occurs in nature.

Buuel rediscovers that behind the apparent inevitability that freedom brings, it hides behind the mask of destiny. This clash between human consciousness and the external fatality is the essence of the tragic event.

As far as my memory can remember, I can only name a film with similar characteristics: The Greed of Erik Von Stroheim.

And of course, we can not ignore the tacit fact that underlies in the historical moment in which it was filmed. Los olvidados is the homage paid by Buuel to Italian Neo Realism.

In that sense, this film is not only a masterpiece in itself, but a movie out of its time. Hence its beating actuality, because those suburbs Mexicans differ very little respect to any other place in the world: the naked violence that precedes death.

See it if restrictions. It is a true icon in cinema history.",1325030400,,1753,4.925423728813559

685735,4,6303593178,"This is at least the 3rd time I have seen this film.  ""Los Olvidados"" is ultimately a cautionary tale, a battle between good and evil filled with various archetypes--vicious, amoral El Jaibo (Roberto Cobo); conflicted Pedro (Alfonso Mejia), his partner-in crime, who although basically good, is attracted to El Jaibo's delinquent world; decent, hard-working, compassionate Julin (Javier Amzcua); Don Carmelo the blind musician (Miguel Incln), a misanthrope who, in wishing death upon all the misfortunate children, thinks he is doing them a favor.  Pedro's difficult, put upon mother (Estela Inda) neglects him and causes him to rebel; she also ends up being seduced by evil (in the form of El Jaibo).  At one point in the picture, Pedro is placed in a type of reform school, and his given his freedom by the director.  However, immediately upon leaving the school, Pedro encounters El Jaibo, and his downward spiral recommences.

Highlights include the famous dream sequence of Chapter 3, and El Jaibo's dream-hallucination sequence in the final scene of the film.  In those sequences, Bunuel's surrealism appears, although otherwise the style of the picture could be described as brutal realism.  The score by Rodolfo Halffter is melodramatic, moody, and an excellent complement to the film.  The set and background features a smoky, dirty atmosphere accentuating the gritty life of the characters.  There are creepy fairy-tale like touches as well, for example, the exterior of Meche's (Alma Delia Fuentes) Dickensian shack, the interior of which is crowded with humans; burros and chickens reside in the adjacent shack. Supplemental material is featured in the ""caractersticas especiales"" portion of this DVD, including biographies of the picture's participants and an alternate ""happy"" ending to the film.

685776,5,6303593178,"This is a deeply affecting film about the poor in Mexico City, in I believe about 1950.  The principal protagonist is a young boy in a large disordered family, whose promiscuous mother oversees alone; he is unloved, but struggling to do the right thing and full of rage.  One of his friends is an evil young criminal, whom a gang of kids looks up to as someone who controls his own fate.  He is one of those destructive personalities that, if you have the misfortune to encounter intimately, will leave his mark.  There are many other characters, all finely drawn and relentless in their brutal realism, including an abandoned peasant boy and his abusive caretaker, a blind musician full of hate.

The young boy is seeking to find what to do with his life and even gets some help from an institution run by a good man, who gets him a job as an apprentice in a silver smith's shop.  It is a way ahead for the boy and he takes to it with great energy and hope.  Of course, things don't work out the way they should, in what can only be called a catastrophe that no one will ever know about.  I don't want to reveal the plot, of course, but Bunuel serves up an awful tragedy with total honesty and an utter lack of sentimentality.  I almost wept at the end.

Bunuel adds many subtle twists to the film, such as the criminal's affair with a woman, perhaps a passing on of his bad genes.  There is also the blind musician, exulting in death, a laugh that entered my nightmares when I first saw the film 30 years ago.  The images are unforgettable, such as the dream of the boy with his mother, when she is offering him meat only to have the criminal emerge from under the bed to take it.

REcommended with enthusiasm.  This is a great, even pioneering film that does not end with a happy ending or indulge in any hollywoodian moralizing.",1303171200,3,1832,4.3657817109144545

Since this is one of the great films of world cinema and there is no American DVD release, I would recommend skipping this version and buying the PAL region 0 France import version titled: Young And The Damned.  That one says subtitles in its description(Most DVD plays can be made PAL and NTSC- all regions, just google your DVD model for the code.  Normally its a sequence on the remote to a secret menu).

685782,4,6303593178,"Los Olvidados (Luis Bunuel, 1950)

I'll admit from the outset that I haven't seen all of Luis Bunuel's prolific output, but as far as those films I've seen, Los Olivdados is unique in that Bunuel goes for a realism that would be entirely out of place in a movie like The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie or Viridiana. This is a movie about the forgotten, the stepped-on, those whose lives are, in many ways, already surreal enough that even the impressive talents of M. Bunuel couldn't do much to augment the general absurdity, lack of love, as dissociation from reality that are a daily part of the lives of these kids. That said, you've seen the main theme of this movie in many of Bunuel's films over the years: the corruption of the innocent (viz. Diary of a Chambermaid, the aforementioned Viridiana, Belle de Jour, etc.). In this case, the innocent is Pedro (Alfonso Mejia, in the first role of a twenty-year career), and the corruptor, or at least the agent of corruption (for at the base, the corruptor is simply the way of life brought on by crushing poverty), is El Jaibo (Roberto Cobo), the oldest and pushiest kid on the block, and thus the leader by default. There are times when it seems El Jaibo wants to protect Pedro from the corrupting influence of the life they lead, even while teaching him how to survive ingrains it in his system; one cannot, however, as they saying goes, be in the world and not of it.

IMDB's trivia section notes that when the film was originally release din its native Mexico, its theatrical run lasted just three days; pressure from the upper classes and the government closed it down. That says more than I ever could about the truths to be found in this movie. After all, you know you're doing it correctly when you piss off the right people. ****",1228608000,2,1794,4.568322981366459

This is an unblinking look at the hell on earth that looks like slums of Mexico City. It is also a masterful combination of gritty realism and Buuel's surrealism like in the scene of young Pedro's dream of Virgin Mary with a face of his mother whose love he desperately needs but never knows.

All the characters, including a young boy caught up in a criminal world but trying to be good, his tired mother who does not have time to love her children, the brutal and cruel gang leader with his own story that breaks your heart are not just wonderfully written and acted, they are absolutely real and would stay with you long after the film is over. Shocking, erotic, and sad, this is a masterpiece - the perfect film from the beginning until the harrowing and devastating end.",1172448000,27,910,4.481927710843373
685784,5,6303593178,"Spanish surrealist director Luis Bunuel's grim ""Los Olvidados"" is a stark, realistic depiction of the lives of a gang of impoverished street kids in the squalid slums of Mexico City.  Doomed to their existence by indigence, lack of education and parental guidance these unfortunate street urchins resort to crime and violence to sustain themselves.

Bunuel's dark commentary on society revolves around two boys, one basically good, Pedro played by Alfonso Mejia, and one bad, Jaibo played by Roberto Cobo.  Jaibo has just escaped from a reformatory and takes up his place as the leader of the gang.  He leads them in robbing and persecuting weak and defenseless people in the neighborhood.  Pedro, born out of wedlock and abhored by his mother tries everything to win her affection but to no avail.  Thrown out of his house, he takes up with Jaibo.  He witnesses Jaibo's murder of another neighborhood boy who had allegedly squealed on him.

Pedro was now in deep trouble as Jaibo's accomplice.  He nonetheless attempted to still curry favor with his mom by getting a job as an appentice to bring home money for his family.  His plans got short circuited as Jaibo stole a knife in the shop where Pedro worked.  Pedro was unjustly blamed for the theft and wound up in juvenile court.

Bunuel's story does not have a happy ending as both good boy and bad boy suffer the same fate.  Bunuel's symbolic ending in which the lives of these unfortunate boys is equated with trash is particularly disquieting.",1154563200,3,1500,4.858267716535433
685785,5,6303593178,"Undoubtedly Los Olvidados is a significant standard of comparison for all films dealing with the cruelty and despair of life at its most despairing. Bunuel is a genius to capture such horror in the form of realism, with just a touch of surrealism with the dream scene. However, realism overall seems to become surrealism in that what occurs is difficult to stomach, difficult to imagine. It's easier of course to watch this with the typical detachment that has become a part of our lives; the challenge however is to watch it and let it hit and hit hard because it is reality and more so now than ever before.",1124668800,7,609,4.5963302752293576
685826,5,6303593178,"The preface to ""Los Olvidados"" warns the viewers that the scenes that they are about to see are disturbing yet they are true.  We'll, this movie was made in 1952 so we figure there probably isn't much in it that'll disturb us.  However, I was bothered plenty by ""Los Olvidados"".  It is the story of a gang of street kids in Mexico City.  They weren't up to too much mischief until an older kid named Jaibo joins them after sneaking out of some sort of juvenile prison.  He is bad and things get worse after he joins the others.

What makes this movie work so well is how Brunel, the director, is able to quickly gather our disgust and our simpathy.  In several acts of violence, Jaibo assaults everything we hold sacred.  Interspersed with these scenes are ones in which Pedro, another boy in the group, does his best to break out of this dead end existance.  We find ourselves cheering for one and against another.  I felt that Brunel was challenging us to see beyond good and evil to search out the real cause and solution to the problem.  He gives us hints but wants to make sure we understand the gravity of the situation.  I certainly came away impressed.",1120521600,6,1160,4.4454976303317535

Legendary director Luis Bunuel, known for his iconoclasm, atheism, and preference for anarchy as a political system, could rarely be accused of playing it safe.  This film is a bit raw to those of us so accustomed to high production values and Hollywood formula, but its gritty realism and in-your-face style will shake you up.  You'll never look at a Christian Children's Fund TV spot quite the same after seeing the world that Pedro and Jaibo live and die in, here in the Mexico City ghetto.  Many reviewers attach the words ""masterpiece"" and ""genius"" to this film, and maybe I'm just not smart enough to go that far but I can certainly recommend this to you who are looking for something a little different...especially if you speak Espanol.  Subtitles always take a little something away from an intense film like this; one can't see the actors' expressions and read the words at the same time, so viewing at least twice is recommended.  Don't expect a happy ending; this is the kind of film intended to deliver a message, not a smile.",1115683200,5,1294,4.75

shown this to Mexican immigrant students in my classroom and am

always impressed with the power this film wields over its audience.  Incorrectly translated, the title means ""The Forgotten"" rather than the ""Young and the Damned.""  By the way,

685831,4,6303593178,"Known for being a Surrealist with such groundbreaking early works as UN CHIEN ANDALOU and L'AGE D'OR, Spanish filmmaker Luis Buuel tones down his surrealistic tendencies in LOS OLVIDADOS and aims for something more realistic. The result is a film that is shocking, offbeat, and tragic---in short, a small masterpiece of realism and social commentary about the disturbing immorality of youth in Mexico.

The first thing that might strike you as the film begins is its tone. For a film about such a potentially harrowing subject, Buuel adopts a strangely light tone, even as some of the main characters harass a blind man and one of them ruthlessly kills another young man for ratting him out in a previous time. It's a weird mixture of tones that nevertheless has an interesting effect on us: it helps to distance us from the action so that we end up merely looking on as detached spectators, instead of being emotionally involved in what is rather shocking behavior from such young fellows. It is as if we are eavesdropping on real life in the slums of Mexico City, and Buuel sustains this objective tone throughout most of the film (notwithstanding his one nod to his Surrealist roots, in a wild but important dream sequence that leads to one character's subtle change of heart). And yet the total effect never seems merely cold or clinical (even though it perhaps is that). LOS OLVIDADOS still manages to achieve a disturbing power that justifies its objective approach. Under Buuel, there is no hyped-up, false sentimentality to be found in this film, as there might be in a film about a similar subject if made today. It is as if he is telling this story as it is, and trusting us in the audience to make our own moral judgments. (Certainly, the scenes of violence in the movie has an intensified power as a result of this lack of stylization---it is quick but brutal violence, and more disturbing because it is so simply presented.)

LOS OLVIDADOS is hardly a perfect movie. Buuel doesn't seem as concerned with getting good performances out of his young cast or even telling a coherent story. The performers either don't really act at all (most of the young kids) or act a bit too much (in the case of Miguel Incln, who plays Don Carmelo, the blind man), and the narrative seems rather disjointed at times. Those flaws, though, are not big enough to matter much in the end. Buuel, that enthusiastic provocateur who would later bring to cinema THE DISCREET CHARM OF THE BOURGEOISIE, aims to shock and enlighten in LOS OLVIDADOS, and, in its unblinking and sobering portrayal of disaffected youth, it succeeds magnificently. Recommended.",1095811200,3,2641,4.814977973568282

It is ripe with social issues, poverty, gang violence, ignorance, and the struggle to survive. I like Los Olvidados because the movie reveals an unusual but common side to Latin America, poverty.  Los Olvidados also has strong symbolism throughout the movie and a CONVENIENT ending for those interested in Latin American class and social reality.  It is not surprising that the protagonist ends up somewhere that is a common theme to Latin American Literature. Let me not give up the ending. I first saw this film in a Media Studies/ Art class in Spain.  The focus of the course was Surrealism.",1072224000,2,695,4.766666666666667
685833,5,6303593178,"""Los Olvidados"" remains a landmark in not only Hispanic cinema, but world cinema as a whole. It marked the return of Luis Bu&ntilde;uel after two decades of obscurity and proved he was more than just a memorable name from the Surrealist movement in Europe. ""Los Olvidados"" is gritty, surreal storytelling at it's finest, Bu&ntilde;uel masterfully mixes the storytelling with dreamlike touches to create a film that is unforgettable and timeless. The film follows the lives of children living in the poverty-stricken areas of Mexico City, there is little hope in their daily living for social advancement and they resort to crime to fulfill their needs. A murder for revenge eventually creates friction between two friends and sends them on a dangerous odyssey. ""Los Olvidados"" is a striking social commentary, even more so today because anyone who has lived or traveled through Latin America can fully relate to the issues the film explores. Consider that the youth culture in ""Los Olvidados,"" made in 1950, is no different from that which is shown in a more recent, equally great Mexican film, ""Amores Perros,"" made in 2000. Bu&ntilde;uel paints here on a canvas of love, death, revenge, lust and murder. The images are rich and the writing is on par with the visuals, especially since Bu&ntilde;uel takes what would in other circumstances be seen as simple storytelling and turns it into a work full of great depth and visceral energy, there is even a hypnotic dream sequence that reminds us that Bu&ntilde;uel was a surrealist first and foremost in his filmmaking. When the movie first came out it won him a Best Director award at the Cannes Film Festival and played for months in Paris and London, influencing many a young aspiring filmmakers, including Roman Polanski who remembers seeing the film as true literature.

In fact, though, Los Olvidados is much much more brutal and harrowing than The Bicycle Thief (not to say that this assures it to be a superior film). Buuel mostly takes a break from his surrealist tendencies in this film, with the exception of a few remarkably effective dream sequences, and creates a ultra-realist portrait of Mexican slums that is uncompromisingly frank. All the characters, including a young boy caught up in a dangerous gang, his harsh mother, the gang leader and vicious bully, and a bitter old blind man, among others, and what transpires among them are expertly captured by Buuel's camera. To characterize this movie, I would call it a much more bleak and brutal Neo-realist film, with a touch of surrealism. I would also characterize it as a masterpiece.
