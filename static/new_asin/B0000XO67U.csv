8004287,4,B0000XO67U,If you are struggling with flexibility in your golf game I am very pleased with my improvement.  DVD is simple and easy to follow,1475107200,,129,4.375
8004288,4,B0000XO67U,"Good routine, about 45 minutes.  Seems to be improving flexibility.  Is absolutely focused on golf related exercises/poses.",1418688000,,123,6.176470588235294

8004290,5,B0000XO67U,"I have been doing Katherine Roberts' Par Series for over six years now, five and six days a week.  Thus, at age 72 I can still hit the ball over 260 yards and keep up with much younger golfers.  Whether you golf or not, I would recommend this program for any adult not bothered by back problems.  Before I began the program, I suffered from stiffness.  If I sat at a desk for any length of time, I had to take five or six steps to limber up my ankles and knees.  That problem disappeared within a few weeks of beginning the yoga and has not returned.  I don't know if she works with the elderly, but Roberts should.  I like Roberts' CD because she takes you through the poses very carefully and deliberately, explaining the value of each one.  And she seems to realize that not everyone is as limber as she is.  So beginners don't have to worry about mastering pretzel poses.  I am grateful for what Katherine Roberts has done for me.  Because of her yoga program, I am constantly being told that I move like someone ten years younger. .",1399507200,4,1037,4.293814432989691
8004291,4,B0000XO67U,Nice starter video. About an hour routine. Walks you through with good direction. Bonus on course routine (stretches you can do on course to keep loose).,1398124800,2,153,4.923076923076923
8004292,2,B0000XO67U,"I, did not like this I, was not impressed, I was bored, it did not keep my attention was not what I, exspected.",1396137600,,111,3.869565217391304
8004293,5,B0000XO67U,"I don't play golf.  A male friend of mine does.  He first purchased this DVD several years ago.  This DVD and Gary Bromlely's ""Yoga Class""  (It is very relaxing.) are the only DVD's he would use.  He bought the other DVD's by Katherine but NEVER used them.  Gave them to me.  I never used them either.  He said doing yoga made a big difference in his game.  I do  work outs with him at his house.  Last year I hurt my shoulder and after doing acupuncture I needed to build my shoulder back up.  I knew that Katherine had good moves for the shoulder even though I could not do the push ups then,  so I bought my own DVD.  I have recommended it to some of my friends and they say Katherine is too slow and talks too much.  I agree but because I know so many other moves I do something else while she is talking.",1387584000,,809,4.031645569620253
8004294,4,B0000XO67U,"I got the ""break 100,90,80"" DVD from this same instructor, and altho its nice to watch her body form into these different poses, it was not a ""follow along"" format, which was what i was looking for.

This video is SO much better. It's a simple follow-along format, she explains things well.. its slow paced, and she reminds you to breath... so it's much more enjoyable then the previous video. I will be purchasing the BIRDIE level yoga for golfers in a few months, for sure.",1364342400,4,475,4.523255813953488
8004295,5,B0000XO67U,Pretty much a waste of money.  It was at the most 5 minutes in length. So we zoomed through about 5 exercises.  The quality was poor... I felt like I was watched a foreign film with the voice not matching the lip movement.  Save your money don't bother buying this video.  I don't rate it at 5 stars... the program here automatically gives it 5 and there is no way to make a change.... misleading at best.,1270512000,11,405,4.220779220779221
