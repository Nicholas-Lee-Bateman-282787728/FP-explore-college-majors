Thank you to the creators of this video!",1240876800,,269,4.153846153846154

2833405,1,B000Q7ZL0Q,"Just look at the titles of the songs...  ""Give me""  ""I need"".  My child says, ""May I please have...""  If he said something to the effect of ""Give me a cookie"" he would be corrected.  To teach such blantantly poor manners is irresponsible.  I am returning this dvd and will NOT let my children watch it again.  If you want your child to develop kindness and proper manners, I would seriously reconsider this dvd purchase.  The other reviews are awesome, and I just can't understand that.  Teaching a child to DEMAND something that they want is just plain rude.

I wouldn't recommend this to anyone with small children.  Baby Babble is a much nicer dvd.",1234656000,3,651,4.573913043478261
2833406,5,B000Q7ZL0Q,"This DVD is so wonderful. I have 5 children under the age of 8 so I love buying fun, educational DVDs and this is the cream of the crop. It teaches great communication skills through a combination of computer animation, children's actions, and music. And to top it all off, Elizabeth Balzano sings like an angel. Her voice is so beautiful it actually brings tears to my eyes. Buy this for your children- right away!!!!!!!!",1225843200,2,422,4.64
2833407,5,B000Q7ZL0Q,"My child is not even on the spectrum, but the Bounce DVDs are a huge hit in our house.  Elizabeth's songs are fantastic -- they don't drive you nuts like other kid-tunes.  And the themes of all the DVDs teach coping skills and behaviors that can benefit ALL children.  It is so nice to see a DVD like this that actually uses REAL kids rather than wall-to-wall cartoons and none of that strange, psychedelic animation that seems to be the trend.  If your child is a late talker, or just shy, or just likes great music to jump around to, then the Bounce DVDs are the best that money can buy.  How many ways can I praise this series?  Can I give it more stars than five?  And when on earth are they going to add more episodes??  Kids and parents are waiting...",1222387200,2,757,4.244755244755245
2833408,5,B000Q7ZL0Q,"My ASD son who just turned 4 adores this movie!  He loves the songs and I hear him humming them often.  The DVD comes with a complimentary CD that I have included as a reinforcer for his ABA therapy.  He even told me the other day, after he sneezed ""I want a tissue.""  I almost fell on the floor! (Parents that have minimal verbal children will understand my reaction) I recommend this movie.  I am purchasing 2 other Bounce movies today!",1221436800,3,438,4.3580246913580245
2833409,5,B000Q7ZL0Q,"All my kids are ""on the spectrum""--the older two (now 18 & 11) are extremely verbal Asperger's kids, but the younger two (preschoolers) were diagnosed in June as ""severely autistic,"" with extremely limited expressive language ability.  They literally never asked for anything they needed; they would wait patiently for their needs to be magically met, or they would cry or scream until someone guessed what the problem was, or they would ""hand lead""--they would try to physically make the adult do what they wanted but wouldn't sign or say something simple like ""more,"" or ""open, please.""

Of course, we started a variety of approaches once the kids were diagnosed, and we have to give credit to most, if not all of them, for the progress we have seen in just a couple of months.  However, these ""Bounce!"" videos really caused something to ""click"" with my kids and were exremely helpful in a few key areas.

First, Elizabeth has a ""see ya later alligator"" toy that signals when it's time to go, and she sings a goodbye song with it (and she has a ""hello"" song to the same melody.)  My daughter (now approx 33 months) uses the song (""Hello, hello, hello!"") to greet people now, and we use the alligator to get my son (who just turned 4) to part with his beloved Thomas trains when it's time for him to go to his preschool on the bus.  (We place a toy bus and a toy alligator on the table near the front door; the trains wait there too til he gets home.)  We received these videos just before his preschool started this year, and he had never been before; I know they made what would have been a major transition for him a LOT easier.

Second, Elizabeth has a song about asking for what you want:  ""I want a hug,"" ""I want an apple,"" etc.  My son started singing the song to himself after he had learned it (that's the majority of his speech--he doesn't talk so much as he quotes things he's heard.)  So when we'd hear him say something like ""I want a hug,"" or ""I want some juice,"" we'd reward it with the hug, juice, etc.  This delighted him so much that he started to actually use the phrases appropriately when he did want something, and he has generalized that to other things--so now he'll say, ""open, please,"" or ""more, please,"" which has been a really big breakthrough (and a huge improvement over screaming!)

Finally, they love to watch the other kids on the videos;  my son knows all their names and will talk to them:  ""Alright, Tucker!""  I think it's been good for the kids to see how the children in the videos behave for the teacher--looking up at her when she is talking, looking at what she is pointing at, etc.  This seems to have improved their eye contact, attention, and general classroom behavior (sitting in circle time, etc.)  I would highly recommend these to other ASD parents--and ""regular"" kids would probaby enjoy them, too!",1220140800,11,2849,4.542074363992172
2833410,5,B000Q7ZL0Q,"Elizabeth Balzano is an educated, amazing music therapist!  Her program is excellent.  My son LOVES Ballou and has a wonderful time interacting with the Spectrum Connection/Bounce Series.  Children learn excellent communication and safety skills!  Whether your child struggles with developmental delays or has a typically developing brain - they will BENEFIT from this series.  Parents - YOU will benefit from the wonderful ""Tips: Advice"" special features.  Bravo!!  Brava!  to the whole team - including Brandissmo!! & Sprout!  This is a MUST HAVE item - the WHOLE series!",1200182400,11,573,5.494252873563219
2833411,5,B000Q7ZL0Q,"My 20 month daughter is hooked on this DVD.  I got it in desperation to see if it would help her talk.  She watches it everyday at least twice and now asks for ""bounce"".  The songs are catchy and even my 4 year old will sit down and watch.  Has definitely helped my daughter's speech delay.  Even though it was developed for kids with autism it is great for all kids who need some extra help to talk.",1199664000,12,400,4.076923076923077
8194907,5,B000Q7ZL0Q,"My son loves this!!! He really connects with her and the children. I have found music and video modeling are great for my son. His speech is delayed and although he knows the phases she presents in the DVD which are I believe ""lets go"" ""I want"" ""and give me"" he uses them much more readily and appropriately now. He sings all her songs in the car (mine came with a cd) which is incredible to me (not the fact that it came with a cd ... his singing:-)) He's 5 autistic and developmentally delayed, but I could see younger typical children would enjoy this as well.",1489017600,,563,4.271028037383178
8194908,1,B000Q7ZL0Q,I bought not just this specific videos but all the bounce videos.  I have at least 6. The videos are all already short (30 mins) and they sing an intro song and goodbye song which is at least ten minutes so you. I think they don't have anything much to teach so each videos has those singing to consume time. lame! Save your money or find other videos out there thats worth watching coz this and the rest of bounce videos are not!!!,1486684800,,432,4.204819277108434
8194909,5,B000Q7ZL0Q,"We discovered this series on PBS Sprout years ago when my daughter was a toddler.  We absolutely loved it. It taught her language skills, listening skills, and just plain fun songs.  We recently were looking for it to recommend to a friend and finally landed here!  This is truly educational TV for young children that is worth owning.",1485388800,,335,4.741379310344827
8194910,2,B000Q7ZL0Q,My students did not like it,1446508800,,27,3.6666666666666665
8194911,4,B000Q7ZL0Q,"I love this entire series.  I bought the series for my first son who wasn't talking as well as he needed to; now he's talking my head off.  These dvds helped him understand and learn how to communicate.  I HIGHLY recommend them.
Now as for the seller:  His delivery time is super fast, but the product (dvd) skips the entire first song.  I do understand that the dvd was used, but I expected it to play.  On Spectrum Connections original website, the dvd's individuals price is $14.95, and I paid more for the used.  The website is no longer selling dvds - Sold Out!  If you can find the dvd new, I do advise you to buy it new!",1410480000,,627,4.2100840336134455
8194912,5,B000Q7ZL0Q,"I highly recommend this video.  I am a speech language pathologist and a mom.  I have purchased this video and shared it with classroom teachers that  I work with who have children with autism and/or down syndrome in their classroom.  I actually taught my son to say ""help me"" with this video/song.  It is great as it includes examples with children saying the targeted phrases as well as scenarios in which they may be used appropriately (Hello, I want, help me, goodbye).  Children who have special needs often learn best from multi modalities- visual, verbal, etc. This is also true for typically developing children. This video provides that for them in a fun, engaging way.  To the reviewer that said this teaches bad manners; I would say that you can teach the child the concept with this video and then expand their utterance when they say it. For example if the child says, ""I want cookie""; You can say, ""I want cookie, please.""  The great thing would be that they are using an utterance that consists of more than one word which would be developmentally appropriate for a two year old anyway.  I love this video; can't say enough about it.  You can definitely get it cheaper directly through spectrum connections (15.00)",1352505600,2,1229,4.754716981132075
8194913,3,B000Q7ZL0Q,"I purchased this DVD for my 3 1/2 year old son who has a severe speech delay.  It has been very helpful b/c it gives him simple phrases to use, like I want, help me, and give me.  Right after watching it, he started testing these phrases out on me to see if I could understand him.  Due to the severity of my son's speech delay,this video is just the right thing to get him started with sentences.  Up to now he has only used one word or two words together, like ""more milk,"" but no verbs. The songs are good enough to capture his attention and help him understand what ""I want"" means.

Contained in this ""Lets Talk"" set is a DVD and CD of the music.  In the DVD there are a group of kids in a circle around a women with a guitar singing songs to and with them.  Originally, I thought my son wouldn't want to watch something so simple, but he enjoyed it.  I also play the CD when I don't want him to watch TV!

To address another review on here that said she didn't want her son to speak like this (I assume she was concerned about manners and politeness), I would say that the song ""Give me"" is the only song that would not be polite.  However, due to my son's speech delay, it is more important to give him words to express himself and than to worry about politeness.  Once he can express things better, we can work on politeness, but for now, he just needs to learn to speak.

So, overall, I would recommend this DVD to anyone with children who have a speech delay or who are learning to speak.  If your child can speak simple phrases already and you are more concerned with getting your child to speak politely, then I would recommend you look at other DVD's.

On another Note: At the time I purchased this DVD, it was cheaper to purchase directly from the Bounce Website, then from Amazon.

Update: After watching it a few times the kids got tired of seeing other kids singing in a circle.  so I have to lower my rating by a star.  Since it was enjoyed for such a short time.",1312675200,2,1980,4.15485564304462
8194914,4,B000Q7ZL0Q,"These Bounce videos are great - my two children with Autism continue to view them over the years because, as they grow, they are more interested in the children and their expressions than just the songs.  They are starting to imitate the children on the video.  The songs are very catchy and teach valuable social skills, and Elizabeth Balzano does a great job teaching the children necessities like waiting on line, saying break and explaining emotions.  BUT please buy from Spectrum Connections at half the price!",1281052800,3,515,4.965116279069767
8194915,5,B000Q7ZL0Q,"I got this for my son who had a speech delay. This DVD really helped him.

After watching the DVD, he's learned how to express himself very well, using ""I want..."" and ""I need..."" which is a big help for any parent. When he sings ""I want a COOKIE!!"" it always makes him laugh.

My son loves the DVDs, but even more so, often requests the bonus CDs that come with it. They make him very happy when we listen to them in the car.

I think these DVDs are targeted towards children on the Autism Spectrum, but honestly, ALL children could benefit from these DVDs.",1253145600,,558,4.245283018867925
8194916,4,B000Q7ZL0Q,"Good DVD encouraged kids to say hello, I want, etc. Active and engaging, but only 30 min.",1244160000,,89,4.294117647058823
