8143733,1,B000I2J6A0,"Probably the worst Globe Trekker episode I've ever seen. Long segments in which she asks her gondolier about guests who want to make love in the gondola (with each other or with him,) watching an art installation of a video of naked women, trying to find celebrities at a film release on Lido and flirting with her Casonova guide. Hardly anything about sights to see in Venice (floating book store, the Jewish ghetto, history of the campos, the public hospital, and the water system prior to public water service) or the food. Having just recently been to Venice, my daughter and I were looking forward to this episode and were sorely disappointed. Stream it on YouTube.",1454198400,2,670,4.7844827586206895

8143737,5,B000I2J6A0,best DVD on Venice.....we're going in October and wanted to get a feel for what to expect and explore....this DVD was perfect for that.,1368489600,,135,4.666666666666667
8143738,5,B000I2J6A0,"I have looked all over for something on Venice to prepare for travel....nothing till I saw GlobeTrekker's dvd. It covers it all! I t's one of those reviews that makes you feel :  ""I was just going to ask that!"" and here it is.

I continue to look for other things just in case, but if I don't find anything else, this dvd did the trick.

I think the problem is that most people do Venice as an afterthought....and the guides treat it that way too. It's stuffed in with other Italy comprehensives.

Venice is so unique that it should be treated as its own entity when providing travel guidance.",1358553600,5,593,4.363636363636363
8143739,4,B000I2J6A0,"Generally speaking, I usually find travel shows from Globe Trekker to be rather abysmal; the hosts are often obnoxious, the travel-worthiness of their coverage is, at times, questionable, and they regularly try to cover too much material in a single show.  This being said, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the coverage of Venice; the DVD strikes a good balance between historical perspectives, contemporary culture, and practical advice for would-be travelers to the region.  Moreover, the hostess - Justine Sharpiro - presents herself as a well-rounded travel guide whose primary focus is to bring the essence of Venice to her viewers.  Finally, the fact that they cover only one city in this segment works to their advantage - Hopefully the producers of Globe Trekker eventually realize that the ""1 hour/ 1 city"" format for their shows is more conducive for creating quality programming that trying to cram coverage of an entire country into their limited 60 minute time frame (e.g., their coverage of Scotland (BAD), their coverage of New Zealand (REALLY BAD)).

For anyone interested in traveling to Venice, or for those who enjoy travel DVDs, the Venice City Guide DVD would make a worthy addition to your collection.",1332547200,3,1235,5.129353233830845
8143740,5,B000I2J6A0,I have watched at least a dozen Venice DVD's geared to those who wish to travel to Venezia! This is my number one choice. You want be disappointed.,1297814400,8,147,4.285714285714286
