6588905,5,B00MMPB3SY,"This is a movie I've been chasing for years, and it's finally here. The movie is an old friend that tells a simple story
wrapped in a pretty good WWII yarn and carries a moral. Sometimes even the clown has to fill in for the ringmaster.
He just has to remember to do the job well, and know when to become the clown again.",1417737600,,321,4.03125

6588950,4,B00MMPB3SY,"When Glenn Ford, who stars as Sgt Savage, is mistaken for his commanding officer General Lane who has been killed by the Germans, he decides to keep up the pretense and lead a counterattack against the oncoming Germans.  His planned ruse is put into jeopardy when a former Master Sgt, who was busted to the rank of private as a result of Savage's testimony, joins the ranks now under the command of ""General"" Lane.  Will the busted to private expose Sgt Savage's ruse and if so which will be better for Sgt Savage, be shot by the Germans or court marshalled by the U.S. Army for impersonating a General?  Light hearted action-comedy also stars the ever funny Red Buttons as Corporal Derby",1456963200,2,688,4.622950819672131

6588956,2,B00MMPB3SY,"They tried to have humor along with kill those Germans! A silly attempt at comedy with a dash of occasional war reality. By the way both sides in this film use the same kind of tanks, the only way to discern the difference is to look for national markings.",1453507200,,256,4.244897959183674

6588958,5,B00MMPB3SY,"This is a movie that I saw when it first came out and have been waiting for it to be put on DVD. The combination of Glenn Ford and Red Buttons is awesome!! Ford may not have been trained as an officer, but he did know how to handle the GIs. If not for his leadership who knows what would have happened.",1452643200,2,302,3.8870967741935485

6588962,3,B00MMPB3SY,"1958 WWII dramedy about an enlisted man forced to impersonate his KIA commanding general to prevent a route of American forces before a German counterattack. Glenn Ford was a competent actor in comedy as well as drama. His co stars are Red Buttons and Dean Jones, two actors mostly associated with comedy. The whole thing is fiction, but it is entertaining...if you don't try to rake the history or story seriously...filmed in black and white, in Hollywood backlots using 1950s era US Army equipment..well, a Jeep, some Dodge WCs, and cargo trucks...and a Walker Bulldog US tank as a Jerry panzer( what else?). Interesting to watch. Typical fare for the era. Another from TV of the 60s I saw as a kid and always remembered. Thanks to Amazon for letting me see it again and add itbtomthevcollection at a bargain rate!",1441411200,,816,4.794326241134752

6588964,5,B00MMPB3SY,even the film is in black and white it gives you a good picture how the war was,1438128000,,79,3.4444444444444446
6588965,5,B00MMPB3SY,Great movie!,1434672000,,12,5.5
6588966,5,B00MMPB3SY,"I saw this movie in the theater when it first came out, so I must have been about 12 years old.  What has always impressed me about it is the humor and interaction between the characters.  Imitation General is a bit far-fetched--or it might seem that way--but it doesn't try to be a great movie, just a very good one.  As a result, and again the interaction of the characters helps, it succeeds in carrying out its odd plot device.  I don't want to give away what that is, even though the title does a good job in saying what that is.,  I enjoyed the movie back in 1958 and have looked for it on tv, recording  and watching it when I could.  I'm glad I could add it to my collection.",1432512000,2,683,4.128787878787879
6588967,5,B00MMPB3SY,Glenn Ford and Red Buttons are funny as ever.,1430006400,,45,4.111111111111111
6588978,5,B00MMPB3SY,"Glenn Ford is a terrific comic actor, the story is engaging and the cast is stellar.  I watch it every few months and enjoy it just as much.  Another great performance is in Teahouse of the August Moon",1427760000,3,201,4.2631578947368425

6588981,5,B00MMPB3SY,A great movie and cast. A funny movie to boot. America always had enlisted men that would take command and do what had to be done.  We had a lot of born leaders in the military during WW 2 and Korea.  I watched the movie when it came out. Tried to buy it from Amazon a few years ago but Tedd Turner had baught the film. When I noticed it was for sale on Amazon I bought.  You'll love it.!,1421193600,2,388,3.825
6588982,5,B00MMPB3SY,"SAW THIS IN 67, read the story in Tibbets 'salute to the brave"". Good film given a minor errpr in the time set. Bearing in mind it was supposed to take place in December of 44, a good rendition of a delaying action.",1420675200,,215,4.023255813953488
6588983,4,B00MMPB3SY,"This is a WWII comedy that shows two facets of military operations, officers command, sergeants command better.",1420329600,,111,5.588235294117647

6588985,5,B00MMPB3SY,"My grandfather, Brig. Gen. William Chamberlain, wrote the story this movie was based upon.  My siblings and I have searched for years and years for the VHS and later the DVD of the movie.  How wonderful to see it finally released to the general public!  Like most of what Grandfather Bill wrote, the story is simple and humorous, and written from the point of view of the career soldier that he was.  He didn't write ""great literature"" and this is not great cinema; but if you're looking for a bit of relaxed entertainment, this is a good way to while away a couple of hours. I thought Glenn Ford was at his laconic best in this one.  Being able to buy the movie at last really made my day!",1418515200,13,690,4.317829457364341

8673021,5,B00MMPB3SY,Glenn Ford was an actor who did not get the credit he deserved for his skills.,1486339200,,78,3.9375
8673022,5,B00MMPB3SY,great movie and arrived on time,1485907200,,31,4.333333333333333
8673023,4,B00MMPB3SY,"There were so many good military movies made about WWII during the 40s and 50s that Imitation General could get lost among the sheer numbers but it stands out for me because of the uniqueness of the story and for the casting of Glenn Ford and Red Buttons. Taina Elg is a lovely addition though she only speaks French in the film. It is short by today's standards at 88 minutes but the action and dialog move it at a steady pace throughout. Glenn Ford had a facility for this kind of humor as was demonstrated in his performances in Teahouse of the August Moon and Don't Go Near the Water. Red Buttons is always entertaining and a very young-looking Dean Jones and crusty old Tige Andrews complete the cast's main characters.
For many years the film was not available so it is doubly good to be able to see it again now.",1485820800,,819,4.359477124183006
8673024,5,B00MMPB3SY,This is a an outstanding comedy of course set in a WW-II background. Glenn Ford and Red Buttons seam to have been purpose picked by the screenwriter's mind when writing this. This is 88 minutes of enjoyment.,1485388800,,207,4.621621621621622
8673025,5,B00MMPB3SY,Excellent movie.,1485302400,,16,7.5
