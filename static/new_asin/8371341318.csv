1170789,5,8371341318,"Alec Guinness gives a terrifically funny performance as Wormold, a reluctant, middle-aged British resident of Havana who is approached by his country's desperate, and ridiculously credulous, ""intelligence service"" to do his patriotic duty and become a part-time spy.  Wormold is also the lonely father of a nubile daughter and he needs extra money to answer her increasingly expensive wishes.  The government will pay well.  One day, rather hopelessly and absently, he sketches the interior of a vacuum cleaner he is supposed to be selling at his modest business, pretending his sketch pertains to some dangerous, real-life strategic device.  His secret agent employers are elated.  They send Wormold money.  Unfortunately, they also become desperate for more ""intelligence"" from the now equally desperate Wormold.  As he invents ever more outrageous fictions, the spy masters grow ever more fascinated.  Then comes the kicker: Wormold's elaborate fantasies begin to come true.  He has created a monster, in effect.  The complexities of his imaginary spy world begin to envelope him.  The outcome is terrible - and terribly funny.  The subtle comic genius of Guinness may be lost on some American audiences, or it may be just your cup of tea.  I laughed till I cried. I have never forgotten this movie since I saw it when I was an English major, studying Graham Greene, among others. I eagerly await its issuance in DVD.",1080604800,36,1420,5.175438596491228
1170790,5,8371341318,Graham Greene served in British Intelligence during the 1939-1945 war along with other literary types such as Malcolm Muggeridge.  They all were less than impressed with the organization and expressed this in various literary ways.  For Greene it was a series of semi historical novels. I would guess that Inspector Clouseau would not feel out of place in the MI6 of the post war era.  In this novel Greene illustrates all of the misunderstandings and quirks of fate that foul up intelligence operations. An inept person is recruited into the organization.  In order to show results he fakes the recruitment of subagents and fabricates information they are supposed to have given to him.  His security is bad and these reports are read by the other side thinking they are true.  The sub agents are arrested and tortured to death.  The hero is recalled to London and given a medal and retirement to cover up for the bungling of himself and the poor judgement of the person who recruited him and the people who accepted his false information and used it for national policy direction.,1056758400,15,1082,4.8478260869565215
1170791,4,8371341318,"Sir Carol Reed's 1960 film of Graham Greene's ""Our Man in Havana"" gets off to a slow start. The expatriate British widower Jim Wormold (Alec Guinness) is having difficulty making enough money to support the expensive tastes of his cherished teenaged daughter Milly (Jo Morrow), who has caught the idea of a Batista torturer and equestrian, Capt. Segura (Ernie Kovacs). The British spymaster for the Caribbean (Nol Coward) insists that Wormold become a British secret agent, and Wormold decides to take the money and when pressed for results, concocts nonsense ""intelligence.""
His ludicrous inventions, including a military installation he invents out of vacuum cleaner parts, are taken very seriously. As in Greene's ""The Third Man"" (also filmed by Reed) and ""The Quiet American"" (filmed by Joseph Mankiewicz), ignorance (""innocence"") proves to be extremely dangerous to others. This film is not as great as those other two, but has a very strong cast (including Burl Ives as a German doctor, Maureen O'Hara as a plucky M16 professional sent to assist Wormold, and Ralph Richardson as the agency head back in London) and splendid black-and-white cinematography of Havana almost as good as that of Vienna and Hanoi in the other two films. The camerawork is by Oswald Morris, John Huston's cinematographer on another, broader 1950s  spy spoof (Beat the Devil) and other films (including the 1952 Moulin Rouge, Moby Dick, The Roots of Heaven, The Man who Would be King, and Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison) plus Kubrick's ""Lolita"" and Reed's ""Oliver!""
Guinness (who had a career in spying movies ahead of him!) delivers a subtle performance. More unexpectedly, so does Ernie Kovacs, who was generally a very broad and antic comic. A thuggish police officer in a Latin American dictatorship is an easy target, but Kovacs draws on the tradition of cortesia and is considerably more professional than the M16 establishment that turns out to be at least as devoted as he is to keeping up appearances. Burl Ives (who long outlived Kovacs, but stopped getting roles like those in which he was so memorable in the late 1950s) also delivers a subtle performance as he is dragged into the madness Wormold's fantasies unleash.",1012953600,70,2207,5.096685082872928
1170792,3,8371341318,"I have seen this movie several times and in spite of the wonderful actors - no need to praise them, and since I love Noel Coward the singer it's a great pleasure for me to see him here - and it has a major problem.  Up to the moment in which the Secret Service secretary arrives on the scene, with the obvious romantic implications, it is very smart and satirical and funny, as Greene wrote it. But from then on it's just boring scenes of Guiness and Maureen O'Hara talking in front of Cuban backdrops and getting a bit too serious for the sardonic tone of the story. I guess there was a need to put an old-boy-meets-not-very-young girl in it, but for me it totally ruins this film - and it's a great pity.

1170802,5,8371341318,"This is one of  the fabulous early Alec Guinness films. It is based on the enticing novel by Graham Greene. It makes a mess of and fun of the British Secret Service. Great lines, comedy, suspense, brilliant. Wonderful scenes shot in early Havana too. I hope that it is never ""remade"" because nothing could top off this production.
We were recently gifted with a few film channels and are looking forward to revisiting Guinness's ""Lady Killers"", ""Man in the White Suit"", and ""The Horse's Mouth"". Those are my favorite, top four films mostly because of the unique, brilliant characterizations that Guinness brings to these great scripts, and the fabulous, ridiculous scenes and characters that the directors and writers weave with and around Alec and into the story. Actually these four films do rival my other top favorite, Dr. Strangelove, and this confession gives you an insight into my sense of humor about human nature and our potential (or real) screw ups.

1170823,4,8371341318,"OK, not everything they did together was up to The Third Man, but this was interesting. First, it was subversively funny--there's a whole gay theme as an undercurrent, which is furthered by Cole Porter. The bumbling MI6 was a lot of fun too. Mostly, I enjoyed the street shots of Havana in 1960, just as Castro was taking the reins. It occurred to me that the same cars are still on the streets. There was an energy to it that Reed captured nicely.

My sophisticated movie critic friends thought it was disjointed and not very good. I don't agree. That said, the daughter was a dud, completely unnecessary and miscast. And Ernie Kovacs was funny, but not sure I'd have chosen him for this role.",1435622400,,694,4.552

1170828,5,8371341318,"This movie is a dark-light comedy set in pre-Castro Cuba that makes fun of the British Secret Service.  I write dark because some aspects are dark if you think about them too much, but most of the movie is very light and dry.  It is hilarious except for a few minutes in the middle where it dragged some, at least for me.  Perhaps some people might not enjoy it because the cynicism inherent in the setup is now familiar to all of us, but I thought it wonderful.  It is, I believe, also ahead of its time on some issues, although not every one agrees.
  LeCarre wrote a book inspired by Greene's novel entitled The Tailor of Panama.  It spoofs the British Secret Service but one of its primary purposes is much more serious: lambasting American foreign policy.  For this reason it is not quite as funny, but it is worth watching too.",1431302400,,833,4.398692810457517

1170842,4,8371341318,"Yes Virginia, there was a Her Majestys Secret Service, a cinematic version anyway, before Sean Connerys James Bond exploded onto the screen with his then high tech-aided acts of derring-do. Whether that old time secret service was worth its salt, was anything but a good old boys club for unemployed university graduates without first son gentry (you know second sons and later unable to grab a share of the encumbered property), noble (again second sons and later unable to be the Earl, Duke, Count, Marquis, etc. of Stumblebrook or whatever rotten borough they represented in the Lords), or royal (you know the second in line just waiting around hoping that number one falls down and has no kids before the fall)  status and without other means or gainful employment is an open question. Certainly for the time period of the film during the height of the Cold War frenzy that is an open to question in light of the ease with which Kim Philby and the Cambridge spies did what they assumed was heroic work on behalf of the Soviet Union. As a recent Philby biography has once again shown the secret service operations were an open sieve shop filled with all kinds of good old boy implicit trusts but that issue is a separate question for another day when I am reviewing the Philby biography.

Of course any governmental agency is entirely capable of bureaucratic inertia and pratfalls, with or without Cold War backdrops, otherwise unemployable wayward sons, and oddball placeholders, but Graham Greene in the film under review, Our Man in Havana, knew enough about the inner workings of the agency to have a field day poking fun at its follies, and at its sometimes bizarre ways of looking at the rational world.

This film has an added dated aspect to it since its time frame was just before the Castro Brothers-Che-July 26ht movement led Cuban Revolution that would change Havana, change Cuba from a free-wielding anything goes American sin city outpost to a thorn in the side of Western capitalists. A thorn that played (and plays today against all reason) a key part in keeping things in an uproar in the American lake, the Caribbean, and elsewhere during the Cold War. That said one of the imperatives of the Cold War for both sides was to have boots on the ground, or maybe better shoes on that ground, in any locations that might be of interest as listening posts for what the locals were, or were not, doing. Normal spy stuff that has been going on since the first powerful guy who was curious about his neighbors intentions sent out a sacrificial lamb to scout the works.

And that is where run-of- the-mill British exile and vacuum cleaner salesman James, understatedly played by Alex Guinness, comes in to foul up the works, fouls up the best laid plans, for his own simple purposes. Purposes which non-professional spies, taking advantage of the paranoid spook mentality, have been doing since, well, whenever they started spy services. That is to get some serious dough to keep his doted upon young daughter in some kind of style, and away from the riffraff.
So despite all appearances to the contrary Hawthorne, a decidedly good old boy network station chief for the Caribbean played by Noel Coward recruits James, and tells him about his expected tasks. Tasks that James is incapable of performing since he is not spy material. But get this, maybe he is. In order to keep the money rolling in James, in  lieu of any real intelligence provided or local agents recruited figured out that he could make stuff up and nobody would be the wiser. Hell, it done all the time to make busy work in that trade. Just look at the bungles of the real life CIA over the half century or so (and of course that Philby-tricked British equivalent mentioned earlier).

And so the comedy of errors commenced and James creativity had given him all the financial rewards he desired. But then, as things must in such a comedy of errors, the other shoe fell. The other shoe being that no one, not James, not Hawthorne, not the nefarious Cuban secret police captain, played by Ernie Novacs, who was also sweet on James young daughter, can pull the thing together before the service finds out that James is a fraud. A fraud who moreover as such things go winds up getting people killed before he is brought to ground. But here is the real beauty of this film. Once everything has been exposed, at least within the agency, the cover your ass high sign was on. So James instead of facing hard time in some dank Coldwater prison never to be heard or seen again was essentially pensioned off and the agency swept the whole thing under the rug, locked the door, and never looked back. Sound familiar about the doings of a certain American spy agency. Ask Kim Philby.",1417478400,,4749,4.695078031212485

1170887,4,8371341318,"The expression: Our Man in Havana is the something of a way to invoke the cynicism of and around the world of intelligence. As such it is not a universal expression but it is a rare case of a writer capturing the mood of an era. The movie: Our Man in Havana is based on the book by the same name with the screenplay written by the same author: Graham Greene. Note that Graham Greene did have experience as a reporting agent for MI6. He was one of several well-known British writers selected for this role in part according to the story, because they could travel to unusual places without drawing attention; but also because they could write witty, readable reports.

By turns cynical, blackly humorous and one suspects too close to the truth this movie is very worth your time.

Jim Wormold played by Alec Guinness is a British ex-patriot selling vacuum cleaners in prerevolutionary Cuba. His daughter Milly is coming-of-age, perhaps a little too sophisticated in her tastes and is aware that she is caught the eye of an important Police Captain Segura played by Ernie Kovacs. Into this mix comes the obvious British spy Hawthorne played by Noel Coward. (Under the heading of just how small the world is or was Noel Coward's neighbor on the island of Jamaica was his friend writer and one time spy Ian Fleming.)

Hawthorne recruits Jim to be our ""Man in Havana"" for the British secret service. Hawthorne however is a nobody with no contacts and no influence. Between the pressures he is under as a family man and as Hawthorne's agent, Jim begins to fake intelligence. Cobbling together information from the newspaper, Time Magazine and whatever rumors he can hear, he begins feeding ""information"" to MI6. Over time he becomes more creative and concocts an obviously elaborate story. This obvious fiction causes British intelligence to decide he is an agent of such importance that he needs his own staff. At about the same time Capt. Segura begins to roll up the otherwise innocent people named as agents by Jim. It is at this point where, what has been a dark comedy reveals itself as a cynical comment on the spy business.

It is a cliche to say that the book is better than the movie. In this case both are excellent both should be enjoyed for the advantages in each media. Alec Guinness fully captures the bumbling, desperate and creative drafted spy. Ernie Kovacs, not known as a serious actor completely inhabits the role of a police captain more than willing to use torture and who has an eye for teenage girls. Burl Ives as a burned out German ex-patriot lends pathos and heart to this story. The smaller roles played by Noel Coward Ralph Richardson and Maureen O'Hara are star quality.

While some will conclude that this is a strictly Cold War era movie with no relevance to our age; 25 years later, John le Carre'would lift the plot outline and place it into his book the Tailor of Panama.

This is an excellent movie. The cast performs as you would expect this level of actor to perform. The movie stands well against the original book. Black humor is not always an easy laugh but in this one the smiles can be quickly followed by the sad realization that real people become the tortured victims of even the innocent mistakes by the intelligence community.

My general feeling was that the film could not decide on which tone to adapt, bounced around and therefore was unsatisfying in some regards. Additionally, while it was clever in some regards I can't say it was humorous as it intended.

The film has a lot going for it, with a great cast and some beautiful scenes, but despite some great moments is still overall about a 3 1/2 star effort.  I love old movies, and enjoy slow pacing, but this one was a little too slow, Guiness wasn't used to his full potential, and the subplot about his daughter in my mind proves to be a distraction as it serves as a mere plot device that could have been satisfied in much better ways.  If you can get this cheap it's not a bad pickup, but from time to time it sells for some reasons at over $50.

Directed by Carol Reed

Jim Wormald (Alec Guiness) is an Englishman selling vacuum cleaners in Cuba on the cusp of the 1959 Castro-led revolution. Hawthorne (Noel Coward), a British intelligence agent, is looking for information on Cuban affairs and recruits Jim to act as a spy. Jim has no experience in espionage and no useful knowledge to pass along, but Hawthorne is willing to pay for his services, and since Jim's daughter Milly (Jo Morrow) has expensive tastes, he can use the money. To keep Hawthorne happy (and his paychecks coming in), he turns in reports on the Cuban revolution that are copied from public documents, ""hires"" additional agents who don't exist, and presents blueprints of secret weapons that are actually schematics of his carpet sweepers. However, Hawthorne and his associate `C' (Ralph Richardson) think that Jim is doing splendid work and encourage him to continue; meanwhile, Capt. Segura (Ernie Kovacs), the corrupt chief of police, has been fooled by Jim's charade into believing he's a real spy - and has also become attracted to Milly.

Great supporting roles for Burl Ives and Maureen O'Hara in this witty comedy inspired by Cold War paranoia and penned by Graham Greene.

One bright spot was seeing Ernie Kovacs, who does a great job in an unusual role - he plays a local police official / strongman for the Batista government. In one scene as he was sitting at a desk I kept thinking he would pull out a pair of thick glasses and introduce himself as Percy Dovetonsils and a couple times I could swear I heard the first few beats of the Nairobi Trio's theme but his strong performance did snap me out of that.

1170904,4,8371341318,"In this rather peculiar story, the British government has concerns about Cuba and wish to employ a British subject who already resides in Cuba to set up a spy network.  Their recruiter arranges to meet a likely prospect: Mr. Wormold, a local shop owner.

Mr. Wormold makes a modicum of money selling vacuum cleaners, but not enough money to support his grown daughter's love of horse riding and his desire to send her off to a safer part of the world.  So, when the Secret Service recruiter promised him significant money, he agrees to become a part-time spy.

Mr. Wormold has a problem: there is simply nothing, that he is aware of, in Cuba worth reporting on.  At the suggestion of a friend, he begins making up outlandish reports from his fictitious Cuban sources on a revolutionary weapon being built in the rebel-controlled mountains.  It would make the H-bomb look like just a conventional weapon.

Mr. Wormold soon has another problem: others are beginning to take notice of his activities, and unfortunately for Mr. Wormold, they don't deal in make-believe weapon systems, but in guns, poison, and accidental murders ...

Some movies are like forgotten time capsules.  This 1959 film gives us a glimpse of life in Cuba before Fidel Castro.  Havana was no paradise, but a thuggish police-state where intimidation, torture, and death were the razor-edged tools of the state.

Overall, I found this movie interesting.  It is difficult to categorize.  Although it has comic elements, it is not a comedy, but perhaps you could call it a comic film noir.

Alec Guiness only has to walk on screen and you're in his spell, so great was his talent and presence.  And Noel Coward, whose droll, ultra-dry wit conveys with both subtlety and force the incompetence of foreign agents.  Then you have Burl Ives, Ernie Kovacs, Sir Ralph Richardson and Maureen O'Hara, perfectly cast in their serio-comic roles.  Oodles of star power.

There are some serious notes here, because after all, spying and war have weighty consequences.  But those messages are so well leavened into the Keystone-cops antics that you don't mind.

1170911,5,8371341318,"Collaborating for a third time with director Carol Reed [""Fallen Idol""; ""The Third Man""], Graham Greene has written a script, based upon his novel ""Our Man in Havana,"" which effervesces like vintage champagne, its humor, both dry and subtle, radiating a brilliance that obscures the fact that this black-and-white film was made in 1957, during the height of the Cold War.

The unlikely plot to which John Le Carr would later pay homage with ""Tailor of Panama,"" is made entirely plausible due to the nuanced performance of the incomparable Alec Guinness, whose portrayal of Wormold, the seller of ""Atomic Pile Vacuums"" in a seedy pre-Castro Havana, ranges between bemused ineptitude and faux confidence and sophistication as he improvises on the tradecraft of espionage, a profession that has been thrust upon him. Much of the humor, in fact derives from his bumbling efforts to recruit agents. The felicitous combination of Greene and Reed ensures that the humor gradually assumes ominous overtones as Wormold's deception is quickly swallowed whole by one side of the espionage game and slowly detected and regurgitated by the other. Given the fact that the film was made before the Cuban Missile Crisis, the drawings of ""secret installations"" in the heart of Cuba provides the viewer with a chilling verisimilitude in hindsight.

Burl Ives, who was noted primarily for folk-singing, turns in a more-than-competent performance as Wormold's enigmatic friend, a doctor and German First-World-War veteran, whose part in the affair is never completely explained. Although Ernie Kovacs' performance of the dastardly chief of police, Captain Segura, borders on caricature, one cannot imagine anyone else playing the character in any other manner. And while I was never quite convinced by Jo Morrow in the role of the precocious convent daughter--she seems a bit too mature--the rest of the cast, which includes Maureen O'Hara as the skilled secretary that London sends to back up their most valuable asset in the Caribbean, is thoroughly credible.

Only Graham Greene could concoct this deliciously sardonic spoof on the Secret Intelligence Service in which he served during World War II. All the fabled real-life stereotypes are present and accounted for: Noel Coward as an Old Boy who, impervious to the raucous importunings of maracas-wielding street singers, strides stiffly through the steamy boulevards of Havana in a three-piece suit, bowler hat on head and umbrella in hand; Ralph Richardson as ""C,"" the all-for-expedience Director, who hears what he wants to hear (transforming what has been described to him as a smalltime salesman into a ""merchant adventurer""); the stammering spy obsessed with his pipe (reminiscent of a notorious mole under whom Greene served in real life), working for the Other Side. All contribute a note of Cold War reality to this tongue-in-cheek tale of espionage. Underlying the humor, however, lurks a question, later asked by John Le Carr: are intelligence services sometimes too willing to believe in expedient scenarios that seem clearly delineated--and therefore too good to be true, when actual events may prove to be other than they seem.

Except for the original theatrical trailer, the extras are eminently trivial and not worth watching. This fact, however, should not prevent one from buying this DVD, which, presented in letter-box form, to preserve the original Cinemascope presentation, is not to be missed.

Hmm, a movie about Cold War paranoia that cannot be purchased in the US? Perhaps the spooks at the CIA really do have a sense of humor.

Alec Guinness stars as Jim Wormold in this comedic spy thriller. Wormold is a vacuum salesman in Havana with a daughter with expensive tastes. He becomes the unlikely head of a British spy ring and is handsomely rewarded by MI-6. Only one problem: the spy ring is fake. Make that two problems: He is so successful, the Brits send out a couple helpers. No, wait more problems. Although the spy ring is fake, the names Wormold provides are of real live people in Havana. The bad guys get wind of the spy ring and for all they know, these are real spies. The movie combines humor with action.

The movie was filmed on location in Havana very shortly after the revolution removed the dictator Batista from power. Nearly a half-century later, it remains the last US movie shot in Cuba. In addition to Guinness, the movie also features Burl Ives, Ralph Richardson, Noel Coward, Maureen O'Hara, and Ernie Kovacs. Highly recommended.",1214352000,3,1350,5.274418604651163
1170915,4,8371341318,"Besides The Third Man, the film of Carol Reed's that I find most interesting is Our Man In Havana: partly because of the music, which, like The Third Man, is unique and memorable; partly because anything Alec Guinness is in is going to be memorable; but also because it is almost a comedic version of The Third Man. Instead of post-war Vienna, the story is set in pre-Castro Cuba - only, it was filmed in Cuba after Castro had taken office; so it is a final glimpse of what Cuba was like before it was closed to the free world. For that reason alone, it is fascinating.

It is a spoof on spy thrillers. As with all Reed's most successful films, the story and script are by Graham Greene. Alec Guinness, who is an ex-patriot that owns a vacuum cleaner shop, is recruited by the British secret service to spy on everyone and everything that looks suspicious. He only does it for the money, to keep his daughter in horses and tack; so he makes up a lot of imaginary contacts and sub-agents. But when HQ requires results, he gets the idea of doing some drawings of secret facilities and weapons that are based on his vacuum cleaners. This creates a sensation with the home office, who send Maureen O'Hara down to assist him with the ""important work"" he's doing. Things get out of hand when Burl Ives, a friend of Guinness', acts like the ruse he's pulling off is real; when Ernie Kovacs, the local police captain, wants Guinness to be his counter-spy; and when Noel Coward, Guinness' British contact, tells him someone is trying to kill him. It is really a lot of tongue-in-cheek fun.

I don't know why this film has not received more attention, unless it is because it is not out on DVD yet, except in non-US format. If you ever get a chance to watch it on Turner Classic Movies, do so - it is a little gem shaped by the hand of a real master. But I trust it won't be long before it is out. It definitely deserves to be.

I just want to add some of the wonderful jokes I recall from seeing the movie, about forty years ago. Note that some of what follows might be interpreted as SPOILERS, although that is not my intent.

  Of course Guiness could be funny just walking down the street, but as he drew the Vacuum cleaner parts and provided a description of a scientific weapon being developed in secret, it was already funny. When Ralph Richardson, the British Spymaster (of MI5? I don't recall a name being given for the agency) sees the plans, he describes them to Noel Coward, who is in based in some neighboring South American Country, as looking for all the world like a GIGANTIC VACUUM CLEANER! Noel Coward, who knows Guinness sells vacuum cleaners, looks quite upset (in an understated, British way of course -- everything is quite subtly done). Ralph Richardson then becomes worried that Guinness will be up to the task. ""He IS a man of substance, I hope,"" he says to Coward. ""A small businessman is no use at all!""

  Noel Coward then goes back to his base, and looks into things, soon asking Guinness to visit him. By this time he is convinced everything is real because he's picked up chatter from the enemy about Guinness' discovery. The funniest thing in this visit, so subtle it could easily be missed, is when Coward welcomes Guinness out in his garden and carefully closes the gate to the terrace with a subtle hint of wanting to frustrate eavesdroppers. But the gate is a typical garden gate, made up of a few ribbons of wrought iron, and completely useless for containing sound.

  We meet Ernie Kavaks relatively early, when Guinness' daughter is berating him for arresting a (presumably liberal) Doctor Mendez (I think), and, saying, "". . .no doubt you're torturing him!"" Kovaks answers in a perfect Spanish accented English, ""No, some people we arrest expect to be tortured, but Doctor Mendez is not in the torturable class.""

  The scene where Guinness challenges Kovaks to play checkers with Whiskey miniatures, Bourbon against Scotch, and purposely forces him to take piece after piece, is for the purpose of taking Kovaks' gun. Guinness doesn't own a gun, but needs one to confront the man who is killing his supposed agents, and at one point in the game begins to worry that he doesn't know how to load a gun. ""Do you keep your gun loaded, Lieutenant?""  he asks. Kovaks has a great line, which he delivers with great restraint. ""The kind of enemies I have . . . They don't give me time to load.""

  There is real spy stuff going on as well, understand. People are killed, a few of whom we care about. But I remember this movie for it's FUNNY lines.",1167091200,3,2869,4.629191321499014
