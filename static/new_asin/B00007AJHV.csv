1803653,4,B00007AJHV,"I use both the Pure Power and Pure Sweat workouts from Rainbeau Mars when I have limited time, but still want to feel like I have built strength.  She is soothing (perhaps a bit too ""new age"" at times) and the scenery and music are quite relaxing. I typically do a few sun salutations on my own before beginning this workout to add some time and heat to it.  As mentioned by another reviewer, there are definitely strenuous poses in this practice, particularly for the upper body and core.  I also typically add a hip stretch towards the end, which is unfortunately missing, and sometimes a shoulder stand and fish pose sequence.

Overall, a good DVD when you don't have an hour to spend on a more complete practice. Augmenting it with a few poses on your own makes it a great workout.

1803654,4,B00007AJHV,"First, I have a different take on the ""this DVD seems focused on balance"" comment.  Relative to ""Yoga Conditioning for Women"" with Suzanne Deason where you're grabbing your toes and standing on 1 leg 1/2 the time, no... the video is decidedly NOT about balance.

If you can get past the sometimes embarrassing new-age analogies (your arms are straws sucking life force from the earth, surf your breath like waves, offer your heart humbly to the earth) then it's not a bad video, especially if you like to get into a pose and hang out for a while.  I like it because it's pretty tough at times physically (if you want it to be) although not too crazy in the flexibility camp.

This is picky, but her voice is not a pleasure to listen to.  Not horrible, but just tense in a way.",1133308800,8,776,4.398601398601398
1803655,4,B00007AJHV,"Pure Power is a 30-minute challenging yoga routine that is designed to build strength. It is definitely not for beginners, as it includes some fairly strenuous moves which require quite a bit of pre-existing strength, especially in the arms: as an intermediate exerciser who has been practicing yoga for several years, I found that I needed to take several breaks throughout the practice.

Rainbeau Mars leads the practice in her usual calmly flowing manner. The first half of the routine consists of approximately five total sun salutations. Although Rainbeau moves slowly through each series, she inserts poses which will definitely challenge your stamina, including side plank, crescent lunges, awkward chair, and 3-legged down-dog. She also includes some tough movements lying on your stomach such as yogic push-ups (lowering to chaturanga and then lifting back up), 1-legged chaturanga, and cobra variations. From standing, Rainbeau comes to a reclined position (there are no seated postures in this practice) for bridge, lying twist, and relaxation.

In this video, Rainbeau is less chatty and more focused on the poses than in some of her other videos, but as always, she is gently encouraging and provides very good mirrored cuing. This is an excellent program for anyone looking to expand their yoga practice, from more experienced beginners who want to slowly build strength to more advanced yogis who wish to continue to increase their stamina and endurance. Finally, the 1/2 hour time frame is likely to be particularly beneficial for those who have limited time but who still want a serious yoga practice.",1093564800,25,1618,5.267441860465116
1803656,5,B00007AJHV,"Pure Tranquility is a yoga practice designed to prepare you for meditation by relaxing your body and clearing your mind. Even more so than Rainbeau Mars' Beginners video, this is a truly gentle routine--the entire 30-minute practice is performed on the floor. Throughout the practice, Rainbeau reminds you to concentrate on your breathing in order to allow your mind to become focused. She then leads you through a series of gentle stretches, many of which are recognizable from more traditional stretching programs, such as shoulder and tricep stretches. After throughoutly releasing muscles in the upper body, Rainbeau moves on to gentle twists for the lower body, always focusing on opening the hips as well. When the practice ends, it leaves you in a perfect position for continuing in a seated meditation or reclining on the floor for relaxation pose.

Rainbeau comes across as sort of a young, happy, hippy chick. She provides excellent mirrored cuing and is obviously very knowledgable about yoga. This is perfect practice for anyone who wants a very gentle, very relaxing yoga program, but it would also be a great video for those totally new to yoga and wanting to increase their flexibility through very simple yoga stretches. Highly recommended!",1093564800,20,1256,5.1568627450980395

1803659,3,B00007AJHV,"I've done Brian Kest's yoga tapes for a few years now, and was looking for something different. Rainbeau was reccommended by someone, and while I thought her teaching was good, and the scenery and music were great, I was really disappointed in the simplicity and duration of the routine. None of the challenging poses Rainbeau is seen doing are taught, nor are the easier poses leading up to them. It's really just a basic sun salutation with a few other things. It wasn't nearly as challenging as Kest. While I liked her personality better, it looks like I'll have to stick with him for a challenge and/or an hour-long session.",1048550400,48,628,4.718181818181818
1803660,5,B00007AJHV,"This 3rd tape in Rainbeau Mars excellent ""Sacred Yoga"" series is exactly what it says.
 It is a Powerful routine that will challenge you specifically in terms of building strength.
 Rainbeau starts with some nicely paced Sun Salutation's which open you up gently without moving too fast.
 She soon moves into an Arm Balance (on-arm stand(Side-plank) aka Vasisthasana) which she also shows with a simpler modification.
 Then there are lots of Uttanasanas (forward bends), Chaturangas (yogic pushups) to Cobras (with many repetitions of the variation of Cobra with the hands clasped behind the back) and Downward dogs (plus variations of Downward dogs) throughout. There is also a nice lunge to Warrior one sequence as well which are wonderful hip and shoulder openers (as well as leg strengtheners).
 Another thing I particularly like is that she does Bridge pose three times towards the end of the session which lets you get really deeply into that very beneficial pose. There is also a lying twist at the end as well.
 She emphasizes breathing throughout, shows modifications for all the poses and gives very clear and helpful instructions that are very easy to follow.
 The session ends with a relaxation sequence.
 If you're looking for a challenge that is at the same time very accessible then you'd surely enjoy this tape.
 If I was to compare it in terms of difficulty to other tapes I'd say it's not as hard as the Kest ""Energize"" tape or some of the Harder Baptiste tapes, but is probably more along the lines of Total Yoga's ""Water"" tape (from ""The Flow Series""), or Rodney Yees ""Power Yoga for Beginners ""Stamina"" though it is very different in style.

1803675,3,B00007AJHV,"Just too simple for my taste. Too short and not really flowing nor challenging for intermediate level. More of a beginners short practice, no problem with this except it is not advertised this way, specially with the cover, which has NOTHING to do with the actual practice.",1215475200,2,273,4.829787234042553
1803676,4,B00007AJHV,"This is a well done video.  It is set outside on a cliff over the ocean, which is nice instead of a studio.  As other reviews have already stated, it is a medium/intermediate challenge.  Before buying you should know that there is only one workout on this video, which is why I gave it only 4 stars.  However, I use this video at least once a week.  The majority of the moves focus around doing planks, down into cobra, back up into down-dog, step into forward bend etc.  She does many variations of this, some more challenging with one leg up.",1209427200,,544,4.336633663366337
1803677,5,B00007AJHV,"Rainbeau Mars presents a fairly intense series of poses in a Vinyasa Flow style. The forty minute practice feels more like twenty minutes due to the increased focus needed to keep up with the postures.

As waves crash behind Rainbeau Mars, she calmly moves through shoulder openers, challenging plank poses and the traditional downward facing dog and cobra. Plank becomes more challenging as you extend one leg behind you and then lower all the way to the ground. Chair, Cresent Pose and Bridge also present good challenges.

Since you hold the postures long enough to feel the burn most of the postures also test your balance and strength. You may notice your arms get an especially good workout. You may find yourself out of breath because you are truly lifting your body weight and moving from standing to flat on your stomach fairly quickly to revitalize and heat the entire body.

While many yoga routines seem to put me right to sleep at the end, this one leaves me feeling invigorated and very alive. You may also notice improved posture.

1803678,5,B00007AJHV,"Since they already wrote all the great & different poses she uses which is different then some yoga dvds, I can add only that it also has the option of 5.1 surround sound so you can hear the Hawaiian ocean waves behind her.
The poses really work on building muscle strength, she really works the upper body with going up/down in chaturanga & her chair pose is 100x deeper, lower & harder to do then any other yoga dvd I've done.
Her personality is great, she's matter of fact with gentle optimism. Some lines are ""stay conscious of the back, so you're not overreaching, the lower back houses the kidneys, maintain a fullness in your back to optimize good health & alignment,"" ""You must sink to rise up,"" ""extend strongly though the feet, the inner thighs will follow,"" ""with strength in your arms, lower yourself to the floor,"" ""remember to balance your effort w/surrender"" ""if you need to modify, it's perfectly ok, you will still build strength,"" ""even the most beautiful lotus grows in dirtiest of ponds.""
She is great with cues to remind you to keep going such as what organs each pose helps, not to get discouraged, analogies to really picture what you are trying to accomplish, etc. & to move through it. She's not fake happy, she tells you she understands it's tough, but it's worth it for your health to challenge yourself & do your best.
No,this isn't an advanced yoga workout, this is high beginner/low intermediate workout.

You can see her passion & ability to do yoga in clips on you tube.",1184198400,6,1502,4.6254681647940075
1803679,5,B00007AJHV,"This version was easy to follow, did not involve elaborate positions, and provided quiet time for meditation.",1178928000,4,109,5.470588235294118
1803680,4,B00007AJHV,"Many people wrote great reviews, I will only add what has been mostly left out.

The menu options are the audio in 2.0 or 5.1 dolby, chapter selections, photo gallery, the bonus section has a 9 min guided meditation (using verbal hints of color, chakras, nature elements) & trailers of her other dvds.

The workout is mostly gentle stretching, 95% in cross legged position. There is a great side torso stretch (arm/hand placement is key) that works the side, shoulder & neck as well, basic common yoga sitting spinal stretch, 2 deep shoulder stretch behind your back also using isometric pulling from the other hand, basic sitting straight leg bend, a one knee bent over the other straight leg knee (great deep hamstring stretch never seen before) & bending fwd & butterfly.

I enjoy Rainbeau's pure positive speech & ways to describe how to move. She sounds like a calm yogi/martial art master. Those who did not like her voice or especially her reminder to ""enjoy your breath"" probably were holding theirs & pushing their body too far, too fast. She said it herself, this yoga dvd is for learning to go slower, to relax, to really go deep in your body calmly & slowly to open up deep emotional tension that you would skip over in a faster routine.

I was able to go slow & deep w/o getting antsy & hitting the fwd remote I normally would from a teacher who was not as calm as she is. By doing so, I really got some deep stretches & really opened up my neck, shoulders & hamstring. I did feel some subconscious emotional tension come to the surface, but not fully released, but then I did skip the meditation in the bonus section.

This dvd is those who have or looking for yoga teachers who do have full body awareness who knows what feels good, with what specific arm, leg position in the right order who are looking for a slow, calming session to open up emotional tension that is the source of physical tension. In this particular dvd, it is best if you can hold a cross legged position a long time, though you can also have your legs in butterfly position or pause the workout & take breaks.

If you're looking for a more physical demanding workout, try her Pure Sweat or Power yoga. For other teachers with body awareness, try Rodney Yee, Wai Lana, Shiva Rae, Yogi Hari, Better Sex Through Yoga, Yoga with Ateeka, Yoga Fusion-Power, The Firm-Power yoga.",1178582400,5,2360,4.554245283018868

It's set in Maui, so the scenery is lovely, and the entire practice is done seated, for those stressful days when you don't have the energy for much of anything. She does use a lot of ""new age"" terminology, so it that bothers you, look elsewhere. If not, this DVD will surely become one of your favorites for relaxing.

As Rainbeau says, ""Yoga is not a competition."" Even though she is very advanced, as you can see when she demonstrates her own practice through the closing credits, she makes Pure Tranquility accessible to all fitness levels. A bonus 15-minute meditation session is also included.",1173744000,6,684,4.7478991596638656
1803683,5,B00007AJHV,"About myself:

I train in Power Vinyasa Yoga since about six Years. I practice every day.

I'm also a Power Yoga Teacher at a local Hotel Spa Fitness Club.

I personally prefer complete and challanging Workouts that still contribute to all aspects of Yoga.

Beeing german my english spelling is pretty bad. Excuse me for that.

About the product:

It's a good short programm. You can't train one hour every day, and short programms like this are perfekt for the days in between. The programm is physically challanging with some pretty unique variations to create upper Body Strength. An experienced Yogi can make it even more challanging by making some little variations like going from Chaturanga ( Low Plank Position) straight up to Upward Dog instad of lying down and than rising to Cobra as Rainbow does.

Rainbow Mars is a very nice encouraging Yoga Teacher. And to comment on some Reviews calling her to ""New Age"": She is a Yoga teacher, so she should talk a little colorfull ;-). This is Yoga Friends! You shouldn't be distracted by sentences like : ""Melt down to the earth"" or ""offer your heart to the sky"". These are actually Pictures that are helpfull for your practice if you try to be open minded with it. And even if it might be a little to much somtimes, who cares?

I highly recommend this programm!

1803684,5,B00007AJHV,"Rainbeau Mars practices yoga by the ocean and this specific yoga practice is mostly a seated series of exercises with stretching and relaxing as the focus. I will agree that Rainbeau Mars is for serious students of Yoga who have been practicing for a number of years. Her escapes into pure focus demonstrate perfect techniques and she gives key pointers to make sure you are doing the exercises correctly and with a sense of dedication. At times she starts talking about the movements slightly ahead of time, but this is OK because then you are well prepared for the next step. She has a beautiful spirit and never sinks into mediocrity. Each pose is perfected and performed like a work of art. In this DVD, you surrender to gravity as ocean waves crash behind on rocks. There is a balance between the ocean's energy and Rainbeau Mars inner tranquility. As you nourish the body with breath, you gain a sense of calm to face life's chaos.

1803714,5,B00007AJHV,"I found this workout to be an excellent relaxing yogic stretch workout.  With a bonus meditation section.  This is a well chaptered workout.  Since it is chaptered you could easily add-on any section to another workout.  It is all done sitting or lying down.  This makes it a good cooldown stretch after an intense workout.  Or doing the whole workout for a great relaxing stretch at the end of the day before bed.  The instructor has a soothing voice, the scenery is beautiful and the music relaxing.",1152835200,5,501,4.689655172413793

1803716,1,B00007AJHV,"I didn't care for this DVD and more importantly, my body didn't like it!  I'm in complete agreement with Lisa, the reviewer below.  I felt more tension while doing this than I did before the program.  I didn't know that was possible with so-called relaxing yoga, but apparently it is!

For the pros - the setting by the water couldn't be more beautiful.  It's downright gorgeous.  But in itself, it's not enough.

As stated by others, you sit cross-legged without moving your lower body for what seems like an eternity (okay, 30 mins).  My knees and lower back protested over that.  I tried to ignore my body, thinking just give it more time.  I only got more uncomfortable as time progressed.

The other thing is Rainbeau Mars reads a script in voiceover and she doesn't pause or stop talking at any point - it's just constant chatter.  So not only was my body unable to relax, my mind couldn't either.  She didn't give me a chance to go deep within, as most yoga instructors do.  She tries to be helpful in what she says, but much of it was unnecessary, and some parts sounded like a sermon to me.  And other things she said just seemed rather irritating.  For instance, I lost count how many times she says ""Enjoy your breath"" (I stopped counting at 6).  I wanted to mute out her voice after a while.  This is not a good sign!

I wanted to like this DVD.  Something that looks this beautiful shouldn't have felt like such a waste of time.  But there are so many other gentle yoga programs available, I wouldn't recommend this one.  Most relaxing yoga programs (if not all, besides this one) let you change your body's position, give you resting poses in between, like child's pose, or poses done laying down interspersed with sitting cross-legged (the latter is fine, if not over done).  And in the end the tightness in your body gets released, rather than increased!  So I'm going back to my other yoga DVDs, and tomorrow after work I'll donate this one to my local thrift shop.",1151193600,8,1982,4.51830985915493
1803717,5,B00007AJHV,"Rainbeau Mars presents an intermediate practice session on a rocky shore in Maui. If you enjoy exercising outdoors, this is a session with flowing postures set amidst the ocean's power.

As waves crash behind Rainbeau Mars, she calmly moves through shoulder openers, challenging plank poses and the traditional downward dog and cobra. Plank becomes more challenging as you extend one leg behind you and then lower all the way to the ground.

Moving as slowly as you are (the routine is highly focused and precise), you may find yourself out of breath because you are truly lifting your body weight and moving from standing to flat on your stomach to revitalize your entire body.

If you wake up and you feel tired and listless, try a bellydance routine and then try this yoga practice. The positive narration and ocean vistas are emotionally healing and completing the challenging exercises will give you a renewed confidence to face the day. While many yoga routines seem to put me right to sleep at the end, this one leaves you feeling invigorated and very alive. You may also notice improved posture.

Special Features include working out without narration and additional bonus workouts with front and side angle views. What I like most about this entire workout is the focused narration and the insightful instruction throughout. Rainbeau Mars' advice allows you to go deeper into poses than you ever thought possible.

1803718,2,B00007AJHV,"I bought this because people said it felt relaxing, and I was trying to find some variety from the AM and Stress yoga programs we usually use.  But we didn't feel relaxed from it at all.  Yes, it was all on the floor, but it was all sitting up in a cross-legged position for 30 minutes.  My back hurt so much I couldn't even do it without moving around to try to find different, more comfortable, positions from which I could work.

There is simply no variety.  It was definitely a good stretch, and ""Pure Flexibility"" would be a more appropriate name, but even at that, it didn't stretch *all* parts of the body, like the AM and Stress programs do.

Aside from that, it seemed a little unprofessional.  Not that this was a big thing, if I had liked the program, I could overlook it, but the dialog doesn't match the video all the time -- sometimes you have to wait to see what you're suppose to do -- and sometimes she starts to smile or laugh which, for me, kind of takes me out of the mode to see she's not centered.

But the absolute *worst* part of it is that, after the routine is over, where most yoga dvds will give you music or nat sound to relax to, this one does that for only a very short time and then pops to an extraordinarily annoying advertisement.  I don't want to have to think about searching for the remote to turn that annoyance off when I'm trying to center.  Very tacky. I guess I wouldn't feel quite as bad about it if it hadn't have been one of the more expensive yoga DVDs I had looked at.  I feel like I wasted my money.",1146787200,8,1548,4.178451178451178

Even though this workout is bare bones in terms of complexity, Rainbeau's use of crescent pose, plank, and cobra, as well as a great abdominal and upper body sequence, makes this DVD a must have.

1803720,5,B00007AJHV,"I really like this video, it is great for days that you aren't up for or don't have the energy for a more strenuous yoga practice, but want to stretch, relax and clear your mind.  This 30 minute program is done seated, mostly in a cross legged position, often switching the crossing of the legs.  You will see spinal twists, side bends, forward bends, and some shoulder, arm and neck stretches while in the crossed leg position. There are also some forward bends and some hip stretches.  As others have stated this is not a traditional yoga routine, it is to prepare you for meditation while stretching you out gently.  There is a bonus meditation segment on the DVD which is also done seated, but could be doing lying on your back as well.

This is my first DVD with Rainbeau Mars, she is a pleasant and likeable instructor.  She instructs as a voiceover, which I normally don't care for but it doesn't bother me here.  She instructs one on one on a platform surrounded by rocks with the ocean and mountains behind her, the video is filmed in Hawaii and the scenery is quite lovely.  During the closing credits she demonstrate some quite advanced poses which showcase her flexibility.

For anyone looking for a gentle yoga practice, this is a fine choice, great to ease the mind after a stressful day, or on low energy days when you just want to relax and do something good for yourself.  Highly recommended.",1143763200,2,1409,4.577689243027889

This is not for early beginners. This is a little more advanced or when you want a good challenge. This workout was starting to make me sweat and that isn't an easy job. For beginners, try sara ivanhoe, susan deason or Rainbeaus own vinyasa for beginners is a great relaxing, but challanging routine.",1138752000,7,532,4.552083333333333
1803723,5,B00007AJHV,"Let me clear the air.  If you want a workout from your Yoga, do not look here.  Go and look for a Rodney Yee, Bryan Kest, or even a Sara Ivanhoe routine.

This is a very gentle practice, performed seated on the floor and is to prepare your mind for meditation, so don't go expecting rigorous sun salutations.

Rainbeau cues in voiceover, and places proper emphasis on breathing.  Her mirrored cueing in this practice is generally done well, if not a bit inconsistent, and there are some minor timing issues where her cues are not in synch with her movements - this is a risk you take when you cue in voiceover, but is not so detrimental as to take away from the practice in any sort.

She takes you through seated twisting postures, stretches and forward bends.  While you hold the pose she uses spiritual prose to guide you and help you focus.  Some viewers may find this a bit 'airy-fairy'; if so, you should not be looking at any of Rainbeau's practices, since it is obvious that it is not a 'Sacred Yoga Practice' that you are after, but more like a '20min Yoga Makeover' or a 'Fat Blasting Yoga' routine, which you will not find here.

My mother, who suffers from depression, makes fantastic use of this routine.  After performing the practice she is calm, relaxed, and free from stress.  She makes the most use of this routine, and literally lets go of tension and anxiety.

You will be calm, peaceful, and tranquil.

7974598,5,B00007AJHV,I bought this years ago and it's the only exercise/health DVD that I regularly pull out of the basket.  It is not a workout but you feel like Jello when you are done.  Her voice is so calm and soothing and the sounds and the waves creates a great ambiance for relaxation and stretching.  I love it.,1419897600,,298,4.192982456140351
7974599,2,B00007AJHV,"Vinyasa flow, one would expect vinyasa. This is more or less a meditation video. Not at all what I expected.

Boo",1370908800,,113,4.380952380952381
7974600,5,B00007AJHV,"I have tried many yoga DVDs over the years for gentle stretching/relaxation and this is my hands-down favorite.  The sequence of exercises is wonderful for every part of your body and the ocean view just adds to an amazingly tranquil vibe.  I do have to roll my eyes at some of Rainbeau's overly-flowery way of talking, but this is the workout that I reach for when I need some tranquility in my life; it truly lives up to its name.  The length of the workout is great.  Just long enough to truly relax and stretch out those tight muscles, but not so long that you can't easily fit it in to your busy day.  I often do Pure Tranquility before going to bed and it allows me to have a much better quality sleep.",1360195200,,708,4.253731343283582
7974601,5,B00007AJHV,"This is the first video I bought from Rainbeau Mars. I like her style. I felt super relaxed after this video, and I was a little sore the next day which was surprising because it didn't feel like I was working out to hard :-) I am use to doing power yoga, but I defiantly will be keeping this in my workout regimen!!!",1343779200,,317,4.0476190476190474
7974602,5,B00007AJHV,I love Rainbeau Mars.  I have (2) of her DVDs Pure Power and Pure Sweat.  It's great for immediate Yoga users and I like to take it with me when I travel and can't get to a class.  Nice flow.  Nice warm up and cool down. Very easy to follow.  I really like this.,1262822400,,262,3.7777777777777777
7974603,4,B00007AJHV,"I love this DVD. It's not physically challenging, but when I finish, I feel open, calm, and almost euphoric. It's good for people who have trouble really concentrating on their breath during more physical yoga workouts. This practice gives me a chance to really breathe and unwind.",1243900800,3,281,5.0
7974604,5,B00007AJHV,"I have been doing yoga for about 15 years and have over 20 yoga dvds.  I've owned this video for at least five years. I've done it hundreds of times and never get sick of it.  That's a big compliment because yoga videos can get too groovy and annoying, even for me. I love this Tranquility video especially when I am too tired to stand up, when I feel stiff and sore all over.  It is the yoga I do when I am too tired to do yoga.  My favorite instructors are usually Baron Baptiste, Rodney Yee, and Gurmukh.  I like John Friend and Anna/Ravi and Bryan Kest, but they can get on my nerves if I am in a bad mood or feeling cynical.  This is Rainbeau's best video because it is basic body relief, nothing fancy.  It gives basic reminders to pay attention.  The sentiment to pay attention to the breath never gets old.  I've given this video as a gift to many non-yogini friends because it is basic stretching, nothing gimmicky or off-putting.  It really helps me keep going.",1239926400,6,971,4.285714285714286
