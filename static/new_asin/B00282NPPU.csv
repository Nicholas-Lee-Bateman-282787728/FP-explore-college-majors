I have watched the joy and excitement on the faces of very young children as they viewed these stories. The animation is Superb, and the stories entertain throughout. They are colorful, fun-filled, and enjoyable. In addition, this Classics Collection is a very reasonable price for the entertainment it delivers. Highly recommended!",1420761600,,418,5.446153846153846

8355537,4,B00282NPPU,"These are basically B-versions of some popular Disney movies.  A friend had these and my son watched a few when we stayed the weekend.  He got hooked on several of them so I looked around for the set.  They are really not bad entertainment for $25, which is what you will pay for just ONE of the same movies produced by Disney.  They are definitely not Disney quality, but does my 4-year old know the difference?  Nah...",1370908800,,420,4.402597402597403
8355538,5,B00282NPPU,"We received this collection as a gift from Grandma, and to be honest at first I was skeptical. I've never heard of Timeless Media Group, the distribution company that produces these videos, and at first glance they looked like cheap knock-offs of the Disney stories. But then we popped one in and my daughter was instantly drawn to it. They are true to the classic stories and don't try to follow the Disney formula. Frankly, I still don't quite get the appeal of the cartoons, but my little one adores them. We watch Puss in Boots nearly every night. The two-story disks are great, each one is at least 100 minutes long and some are 131 minutes. Great price for the number of stories and the length of each disk.",1356307200,4,713,4.492307692307692
8355539,5,B00282NPPU,These are not the Disney versions but are still wonderful.  They actually stay truer to the original stories than Disney.  I love all of the different stories in this collection and so do my kids.  They couldn't be happier with them and watch them constantly.,1285459200,7,259,4.711111111111111
