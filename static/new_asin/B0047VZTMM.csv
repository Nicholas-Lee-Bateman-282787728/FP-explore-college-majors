4285690,5,B0047VZTMM,"Let me get this straight: in Dubai you can ski in a mall, snowboard in the desert, play golf at a first class resort, ride a camel on the beach, visit the world, visit the universe and trek to the top of the tallest building on the planet?

Nice...

In 30 minutes, the host and production crew give you the rundown on where to go and what to do, keeping it simple and providing anyone who's planning a trip to Dubai the confidence to strike out on their own. You can literally follow in their footsteps, mix it up, or linger longer anywhere along the way. Anyone can do the standard tours (and I especially liked the one that was included), but to get the real flavor of a destination, there's nothing like venturing out on your own.

Oh, and did I mention shopping (the host sure seemed to like it). Did I say like, she actually seemed to LOVE it! But seriously, Dubai is a shopper's paradise and any travel video that doesn't touch on this guilty pleasure is missing the boat on one of the main reasons people love going to Dubai (this video even gives you a quickie lesson on how to haggle!).

If you're thinking of heading to Dubai, trust me, this will be the best $15 you'll ever spend. Looking forward to more videos from these guys; finally someone who seems to have gotten it right. The program is very informative and entertaining; more like a TV show than a standalone DVD!",1268092800,2,1383,4.36964980544747
4285691,5,B0047VZTMM,Exactly what I was looking for since I will visit Dubai next month.  Am a golfer and liked the part of the video on golf.  Will also plan a trip to other parts of the emirate because of host suggestions.  Am now looking forward to vacationing there more than ever.  The video is kind of like a guidebook transformed into a DVD.  Lots of places visited in only 30 minutes.,1267747200,,371,4.242857142857143
