ny father was a World War II Seabee and I was a Seabee in Vietnam.",1439078400,,207,3.727272727272727
8660365,3,B00KO80X1E,"I had never seen nor heard of this movie...so I ordered it to see what I had been missing! Amazon delivered it in less than two days in excellent condition. I opened it up, popped it in the DVD player and settled in to watch. First, it's definately w ""B"" feature, made to be the second movie on a two feature showing, this bring the ""lesser"" of the two. It's in black and white and only runs for sixty-three minutes. No really big stars... The studio here( a Warner Brothers partner or nomdeplume of some such) used then recognizable TV stars and contract players. John Lupton and Brett Halsey, paired with an actual film actor, James Edwards, one of Hollywoods go to black actors for movies from the late forties onto the early sixties. These guys are the Americans running about on a Japanese-held island in what would be 1942. The Japanese are played by a few Amer-Asian Hollywood actors who were always called on for such stuff...Most recognizable is James Hong, a Chinese-American  actor most memorable in the ""Sinefeld"" TV episode about the Chinese restaurant ! A native girl is played by then rising actress Ziva Rodan. Her lines were limited, no doubt due to her lack of command of the English language. She made a few movies in the sixties...then sort of faded away... There's the cast...on to the plot!
 Ok, four ""U.S.ARMY(?) SEEBEES"" are sent to survey and scout a Japanese island to see if the land will support concrete runways for an airbase. If not the island will be bypassed. Now, this stuff actually did happen, but the SEEBEES  were part of the U.S. Navy....the Army did have engineers who did such survey missions. The guys don't want to be there..,they constantly are bitching (and talking way too LOUD) to their leader, the ""Lieutenant"". All are outfitted in period correct gear and uniforms( Army fatigues) but all four carry ""Tommy Guns""....maybe, but that's a heavy weapon to lug about with all the survey gear...and all but the leader walk about with fingers on triggers....nope. Good way to kill the guys around you by accident! Only actor Lupton carried with finger off the trigger...as the military once must have tsught him! This plot of mission and squad make- up of three white, one black seems vaguely familiar to me...then the guys get ambushed by Japanese guards and the black soldier is wounded in both legs and left unable to walk....they must leave him as they run into the jungle, his painful cries of "" my legs, I can't walk, help me!"" Ringing in the ears of GIs and audience alike.....and suddenly I realize that this film has lifted the plot from the 1949 film  ""Home Of the Brave""! Even the same actor...James Edwards! Well, anyhow, the similarities end there. The acton is fast...remember the films only a bit over an hour long...and the PT boat to pick up the guys will only wait two hours! I won't go into more plot...see it for yourself....it's not bad...just predictable. Lots of odd stuff to make you watch closely....the Japanese officers speak Japanese to their men...and English to each other....but the Japanese soldiers speak English to each other when the officers aren't present? The Americans run into a terrible yucky swamp with clingy dark mud and goop all over them....then they are miraculously clean but wet in the next scene...hosed off? Their weapons do not have limitless bullets...they really do have to change magazines on those Thompsons! And the clips have bullets visible in them! Towards the conclusion, the character ""George"" unable to walk due to wounds seems to have pulled the bullet fragments out of his shins and is able to walk again, helped by the native girl the Japanese have antagonized through the film. In fact, after he pours saki on his wounds he is able to run and fight, taking out the majority of the Japanese force with one grenade and his tommy gun! And the other guys decide to...well, you'll have to see it to find out.
Seriously, bad as the plot sounds, it's an interesting film to watch just to spot the odd stuff and be reminded of what movie studios used to produce for theater double billings! All in all, I'm pleased to have it in my collection!",1417737600,5,4144,4.719613259668508
