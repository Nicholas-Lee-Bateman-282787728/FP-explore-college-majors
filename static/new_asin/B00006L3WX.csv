There are many reviews of this performance scattered among the reviews wrongly located by Amazon with reviews of other performances.
Among the reviews of this performance there are a good number of 5 star ratings. There is a lot of praise for the singing and for Verdi's music. I agree with the praise and the 5 star rating. There is a general opinion that the staging is rather static, but I was struck, as an artist, by the unusual and beautiful use of color.
This opera has a wonderful part for an aging baritone. I own this one sung by Nucci and also the La Scala performance by Bruson. Both men are great in their triumphant last act.
I believe the reviewers who praise Domingo as a baritone. I will order that performance.
Amazon's overall rating order for this opera cannot be trusted because of the mixed up customer ratings. This is the second time I've noticed this same mix-up, so I advise reading reviews of several performances before believing Amazon's overall rankings. Amazon needs editing.",1521590400,,1120,4.685279187817259
