8042633,2,B0006SL1RC,"Just tried this again with my now 9 and 6 year old boys. We all find it too hard and the whole ""now rewind and do it"" idea really doesn't work for us. Even when they ""teach"", they go far too fast and don't break it down enough. Plus one dance (the jitterbug) is useless for three people.",1422489600,2,287,3.9655172413793105
8042634,5,B0006SL1RC,"I purchased this DVD for my children (8 and 5) and they love the fun music and cool dance moves.  It is fun to watch the two of them learning together, and it goes slow enough so my five year old has time to catch on to each new move. My husband even loves to dance with them!  This is a great way to get the kids to get off the couch and get active!",1230249600,,350,3.6533333333333333
8042635,5,B0006SL1RC,"Ordered this for my 7 year old and he absolutely loved it. I didn't have too high of expectations when I ordered it, but it did just what its supposed to. My child is more active and still wants to watch it almost a year later.",1229472000,,227,3.9565217391304346
8042636,5,B0006SL1RC,I ordered this DVD for my two sons ages 8 & 10. This DVD gets them to exercise and they don't even know it. They have so much fun learning these dance moves and even break a sweat doing it. My boys were hooked to video games for years but now enjoy Kideosyncrasy even more.  This is a great DVD for all parents looking for new and fun ways to get their kids active.,1229472000,,365,3.9324324324324325
8042637,1,B0006SL1RC,"I brought this home for my daughter who has an interest in dance.  This pretty much killed that interest.  In kids videos we are all willing to tolerate the lousy production value and overall cheesiness, but there should be perhaps some kind of useful content, no?  NO!  They run through a dance at top speed, then ""teach"" the dance all at once at regular speed, and tell the kids to REWIND IT if they want to learn the dance!  There is no way for my daughter to keep up and possibly learn a thing!

This appears to be a vanity project set up by some of the parents or something, who decided to show off what dance class dollars have accomplished.

Other inanities include:  constant blurbs about how exercise is cool, really awful contrived jokes, terrible acting and special features that, if you weren't so mad about the uselessness and frustration factor of this disc, might be fun to ridicule otherwise.",1135123200,6,908,4.596273291925466
