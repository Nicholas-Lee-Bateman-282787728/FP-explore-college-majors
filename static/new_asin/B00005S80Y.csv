1658702,5,B00005S80Y,"I have the region 2 version of this DVD, which I bought off Amazon.co.uk -- this concert is absolutely amazing.  It's hard to describe, but the crowd of about 9,000 people seems incredibly intimate for such a large group of people...in a way, it matches David's own transformation from being kind of a folksy singer-songwriter to being part of the British and American musical mainstream.  This concert has the personal feel of a ""house"" show while at the same time capturing David's growing popularity with the masses.  I loved every minute of it.  All his best songs are here.  He performs a ton of songs from the White Ladder cd (the title track, sail away, please forgive me, this year's love, say hello, wave good-bye and, of course, babylon are only a few of the songs you'll get to hear from that cd).  In addition, David also performs key tracks from each of his previous three albums (""shine"" stands out in my mind as the not-to-be-missed song of those albums and, of course, that's included here as well).  In total, the concert is well over an hour, and David performs 17 or 18 songs.  There's not a whole lot of theatrics going on, so don't be expecting him to put on any kind of act or to get excessive with the storytelling.  Of course, if you're a David Gray fan, you should already know that it's all about the music.  If you are not already a David Gray fan, however, and are just looking to try something ""new,"" be forewarned:  this is not a concert that uses gimmicks or props.  But then again, this is not a concert that needs those things to keep you interested.  This concert, like David Gray himself, is all about the music.  And what great music it is!  In addition to the concert, the dvd also contains an interesting documentary on David Gray, the man behind the music.  A definite must-have for any David Gray fan, and a worthy investment for anyone who just appreciates deep, soulful music.  Highly, highly recommended.",1006905600,9,1947,4.58092485549133
1658703,5,B00005S80Y,"No doubt he is one of the greatest musicians of all time!  His song writing and lyrics are destined to stand the test of time....for all time.  I cannot tell you in words how great this concert is and how awesome he is.....just buy it, you will be grateful and so will your children, your parents, even your grandparents.  My Mom is 72 and she loved it.  My son is 21 and he wants me to hire him for his wedding reception!!  I hope I can!  You would be a fool not to have this in your collection!!",1062460800,3,497,4.020408163265306
1658704,5,B00005S80Y,"Simply brilliant - that's all you can say about this DVD. It is topped by only 1 thing, and that is seeing David live - in person. To listen to an artist sound better live than in studio is a rare and precious thing that should be savored and re-lived over and over. The DVD is very well produced with Dave sounding as clear and crisp as ever. Shine is incredible, Babylon awesome and Please Forgive Me is just massive. Buy the DVD, see him live and see what the others forgot long ago.....",1049155200,,490,4.223404255319149
1658705,5,B00005S80Y,"I have to be honest that I did not follow David Gray until White Ladder came out. Once I listened to this I realized what a great song writer he was and went back to appreciate his previous music. The DVD Live at the Point is not flashy but most of his fans are not followers for great stage shows, they want David seen and singing from his passion for his songwriting. I have not seen him personally in concert but his head movement does bug me ...
As far as the concert itself and deliver and reproduction you cannot go wrong.. I put david in the class of Edwin McCain but not yet the claiber of Don Henly who I consider one of the best song writers and delivery of his lyrics better than anyone, John Mayer is not far behind John and David and the interesting thing is they have been around awhile and just coming into ther own fame. Its grate to see and this DVD will not
 dissapoint you",1048032000,,891,4.1502890173410405
1658706,5,B00005S80Y,"You wouldn't normally expect a solo acoustic artist and his band to be able reproduce, so faithfully,  what for most can only be achieved, technologically, in the safety and comfort of a recording studio. You certainly wouldn't expect them, out on the wire,  to sound even better live, but that was my experience when I saw David's remarkable performance at the Manchester's Evening News arena in November this year. It left me yearning for a live video or DVD concert recording to recapture some of the magic of that unforgettable experience. You just don't get it on C.D. And here it is; that magic is written on every track and seen in every frame of David Gray Live at the Point, Dublin. This `must have' DVD includes a well-crafted documentary covering his sell out tour of Ireland. Hear the views of some very articulate Irish fans, see the hard work involved in touring, the venues, large and small,  but most important get further insight into the man. David is refreshingly `unshowbizz'; is clearly unpretentious and accessible and comfortable with fans. See him in a record store , just standing there singing `Babylon' to the folks with his guitar. On a radio station interview he sings an old Everly Brothers number live, but he could have sung the phone book, such is the passion in his voice.  The cover blurb points to this concert being very special, marking as it does a pivotal point in David's career, an unforgettable night, he tells us, more a celebration than a gig' and that is clearly what has been captured successfully on this DVD. In every one `of the seventeen tracks David performs here, his unique voice is clear, confident and powerful; his acoustic guitar musicianship clear for all to see. He looks a remarkably happy and fulfilled person, turning now and again to others in the band and exchanging knowing smiles, really enjoying himself in that unassuming way he has. No need or place for flashy showmanship. David and his musicians are so tight, totally focussed on what they are doing. Who wouldn't enjoy being on that stage in front of such a knowledgeable and appreciative audience, making and hearing the sounds of those instruments and voices live, blending as they do, together so beautifully , supporting David and his piercing lyrics. He seems to regard himself as very fortunate; all the people around who work with him are there because they want to be, from the early days when the payback was more love than money and that, he says, is what makes it all work.  I have all David's C.D's but there is, believe me, no substitute for seeing him live. The nearest you can get is a DVD like the Point concert. I just hope his management will seriously consider releasing
( soon) another David Live concert on DVD . The sustained quality of the new songs on `A  New Day at Midnight' , the very recent , remarkable Apple Studio Concert , confirm  that David, live,  just gets better and better and has me yearning for a more recent live concert DVD to complement this one.",1040860800,6,3012,4.702087286527514
1658707,5,B00005S80Y,"I was recently turned on to David Gray's music and this DVD is a must have.  I love the presentation--nothing over the top, just about the music!  Gray's genuineness and sentimentality translate well in concert.  This DVD makes me anxious for the time I'm able to see him in concert here in the United States!  As is the case with many truly gifted artists, Gray is not as well known as he should be.  I suppose if the majority of people in this world like what you're doing, you're probably not doing something right.  Do yourself a favor and buy this DVD!",1030579200,,557,4.411764705882353
1658708,5,B00005S80Y,"If you live in the USA, you likely only really know of ""Babylon"". And when you heard it - catchy isn't it - but you probably didn't know who sang it.  Well, David Gray does.  And he sings it, and all his songs, from the Heart!  If you are looking for a flashy concert, w/bright lights and pyro -- and more lypsyncing than singing, then DO NOT buy this DVD. Zero lypsyncing and not one pyro explosion here (Check out Britney in Vegas for those...) Anyway, David Gray brings a long over do return to music SUNG from the heart.  This DVD includes songs from the ""Babylon"" cd and songs from his other 5 or 6 CDs. (He's only ""new"" to us in America.)  With this DVD you can catch up on all the songs making him popular now, and also hear many from his past (CDs)that got him here.  I recommend watching the film ""Up to the Point"" first as a lead in to the Concert.  You can see him as a struggling musician trying to break in and then catch the concert that, to quote David is a ""taste of things to come.""  Well, ok David. We saw. We agree. Now get your [behind] over here and let us see it live on the US stages!!!  It's a great DVD and great music if you just want to let if play in the background.  :-)  ...  All of you here in the USA...ENJOY your new DVD!",1016928000,,1254,4.012096774193548
1658709,5,B00005S80Y,"Simply put, this DVD is the best concert disk I have seen and heard. I now use this disk as a reference disk for high-end audio/video equipment costing $5,000 to $50,000. Don't let the 5.0 Dolby Digital fool you. I have had people complain about it not being in 5.1. It is a life altering experience to hear and see this DVD. I am looking forward to his next one!",1010793600,3,363,4.2
1658710,5,B00005S80Y,"This DVD definitely secured me as a David Gray fan. I was totally sold on all his earlier stuff but White Ladder still wasn't sitting well with me--until seeing the songs from it performed live. Living in the US, we don't get many chances to see Mr. Gray perform but this will have to do---for now anyway! New found appreciation for ""Sail Away"" and a new realization as to why ""Shine"" will always be the defining song to David's career. Especially moved by the crowd's excitement to hear ""This Year's Love"". The sing-a-long was great!! Seeing all this David Gray hysteria made me want to move to Ireland with my fellow Gray-ites!",1009411200,2,629,4.625
1658711,5,B00005S80Y,"It's been SO hard waiting for this DVD to come to the States. David has been popular seemingly everywhere except for the States until White Ladder came out here, but I've been a fan since well before then. But it's finally here and it is well worth the wait.
For new fans, White Ladder songs are interlaced throughout the concert playlist. It's a wonderfully balanced songset that has tracks from all of his albums to date including ""Lost Songs"" and ""EP's 92-94"". If you have and enjoy all of his albums, there will be some tracks that you wish were included, but that is truly one of the problems (albeit a good one) inherent to David Gray; he simply has an enormous number of songs that are just ""great songs"" that you can listen to repeatedly.
The quality of the video is pristine. There aren't any jumps, skips, or artifacts that plague some other concert DVDs. The audio, too, is crystal clear and synced accurately to the video. I've had past experience with DVD's gone awry in video and audio quality. No such problems with this one at all.
The included documentary follows David Gray daily during the 7 days leading up to the concert at the Point in Dublin. Mixed between interviews with him are interviews with other musicians in Ireland talking about David and his music as well as this wonderfully animated Irish poet that steals the show. You'll see David singing Babylon at an Irish record store to a crowd of fans as well as scenes from sound tests and backstage footage from the other concerts he had in Cork, Galway and Belfast. They talk to everyone and anyone that has something to say about David. I enjoyed the look into his life and history as well as the interpretations of his music by the people in Ireland.
Overall, this DVD is a must buy for any fan of David Gray. Even if you've just become a fan with White Ladder, this is a great opportunity to sample fantastic renditions of his past music to get a taste of what came before and his growth as a musician over time.",1008288000,20,1994,4.4958677685950414
1658712,5,B00005S80Y,"Any David Gray fan, particularly those who only know his White Ladder tracks, simply MUST purchase this DVD.  Your appreciation of David Gray's music will AT LEAST double after viewing this concert which features 9 songs outside of the White Ladder play list.  Also, I strongly suggest that you FOLLOW your post-viewing urge to purchase his earlier works.  You simply can't be disappointed by the talent displayed by Mr. Gray.  If you are looking for a classic before it becomes one, this DVD and this artist are it.",1008201600,4,516,4.829545454545454
7953246,5,B00005S80Y,I am such a fan of David gray that I love everything he does. I hope a dvd for mutineers is coming soon.,1443916800,,104,3.5652173913043477

7953248,5,B00005S80Y,"If you are a fan of great music, this is the greatest Concert DVD I ever owned. The last song was great with the light show and the camera work was excellent!

Highly recommend!!!",1394496000,,179,4.264705882352941
7953249,5,B00005S80Y,"Excellent DVD. David Gray's head bobbing takes some getting used to, but the songs are great, especially ""Please Forgive Me""!",1386288000,,125,5.3
7953250,4,B00005S80Y,"I searched for Blue ray and couldn't find it so had to settle with DVD. Our screen is 56"" so was alittle fuzzy. Disc also skipped in a couple of spots but only a few times. Definetly still worth buying, great songs.",1321056000,,215,4.142857142857143
7953251,5,B00005S80Y,"When ""White Ladder"" came out I was lent a copy to listen. I was curious to hear more and after buying a copy for myself I soon bought ""Lost Songs"". Then by chance stumbled across ""Live at the Point"" and thought ""Why Not? I love his stuff so far and have yet to see him in action"". That was one of the best purchases I could have made. I am since one of his biggest fans. Right from the beginning you are swept up in the energy of his music and performance. He surprised me at first with his ""bobble head"". I wondered how he could do that and sing at the same time. By the end of the first song though I had not only gotten use to it but noticed myself doing to as well. That's the great thing about Grays music, You can't help but be moved and feel every song, fast and slow, through your soul. This concert takes you on a great journey of emotions and the audience treats every song with reverence and participation by mouthing the words or clapping along. I was amazed at how even the songs from ""White Ladder"" that I had listened to hundreds of times by then seemed fresh and new with these live versions. I have since found that either due to his creativity or his need to play older songs in a new way that Gray is constantly tweeking certain songs thereby ensuring new versions found on this disc. You won't be able to take your eyes and ears away once this concert starts and you'll feel you appreciation of good music enriched by the end of it. Another part of this disc that I cherish just as much as the concert is the bonus documentary that can proceed your viewing of the concert. It's full of the behind the scenes stuff I adore. Not only do we get to hear how people feel about him before the ""White Ladder"" success and people explaining how good music makes them feel but we also see Gray doing the smaller venues like clubs,bookstores and radio shows. The film does an excellent job of helping you to feel what it's like to walk in Grays shoes as he climbs the slow ladder of success and how music is his true calling. For me,as a fellow musician, I find it insperational and motivating. In a day an age where there is so much room on a DVD there is no good reason why all concert DVDs shouldn't have wonderful things like this attached.",1171929600,,2253,4.217592592592593
7953252,5,B00005S80Y,"Hats off to David and his band for producing a magnificent concert DVD... sound is of superior quality. This dvd has grown on me in so many ways. If you enjoy playing guitar to the music, this is a great place to play. Give it a chance...",1141257600,2,238,4.085106382978723
7953253,5,B00005S80Y,I love live performance video. I was casually aware of David Gray until I saw this performance. I'm a New Fan Now!,1127088000,3,114,4.2272727272727275

7953255,5,B00005S80Y,"Since inadvertently hearing a few tracks from the breakout self produced White Ladder in a music store I have been quite interested in exploring more from this artist.  Unsure what to expect from the DVD, I was more than surprised at what this man brought to the table.  The setting is perfect, a small (8000) person venue in an atmosphere that was a breeding ground for new fans to be born.  Ireland is passionate about DG and it shows in the faces, the singalongs and the emotions.  Then wham!  Song after song after song, each one with it's understated beginnings but easily finds its way to the hook.  The energy and excitement eminate from DG and his bandmates with his writing partner Clune showing grace and an ecclectic style that makes you grin from ear to ear.  It's obvious that the partnership DG and Clune share is more equal than not.  Clune is able to keep DG focused within the rhythms but allows for DG's excitement to burst through.  The visuals are not necessary to enjoy this concert but do provide a look into a moment in time that is able to show someone on the verge of making the record companies eat their words.  DG is unassuming in his approach and handles the crowd with schoolboy like charm.
From the opening ""Sail Away"" to the up tempo ""Please Forgive Me"", these songs contain exceptional lyrics coupled with a lyrical structure that enhances each track.  The song list is selected from his entire collection and provides the first time listener with an overview of what to expect if one was to delve deeper into the talent of DG.  In some songs, i.e. ""Late Night Radio"" his brazen use of obscure chord pairings show his experimental stylings that keep DG from being relagated to average status.  While others, i.e. ""Shine"" are unique variations of traditional progressions.  Overall, too many notables to mention.  This is a great collection from an up and better be coming artist.  North America certainly could use a few large doses of David Gray.  The music is what this DVD is all about and does not disappoint.",1069718400,24,2046,4.654596100278551
