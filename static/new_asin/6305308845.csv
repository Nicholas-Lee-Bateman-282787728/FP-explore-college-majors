1011077,5,6305308845,"The film is excellent..One of my favorites.  I would like to have seen more extras, (Stop making Sense) has a lot of neat things in it. Wide screen would have been cool, but the big difference here is the dvd sound  and clean video. most people  don't notice the superiority of dvd until they  go to a friends house and watch it on vhs..  despite any minor complaints,  it is a definite keeper.  Leonard maltin called it  ""depressing"". I don't think so..Its a movie about people who play  the cards they were dealt and played them well.",964396800,,536,4.443298969072165
1011078,5,6305308845,"David Byrne, lead singer of the Talking Heads, takes us on a tour of the life and times of Virgil, TX, as it prepares to put on a ""Celebration of Specialness"" as its contribution to the sesquicentennial  celebration of the state of Texas.
The video takes a bit of getting  used to, but once you are in tune with what is going on you will see that  there is great humor embedded in this pseudo-documentary.  During the first  part of the movie we meet main players.  John Goodman plays a man hungry  for a stable (or any) lasting relationship.  He even advertises!  You also  meet ""The Lying Woman"" who tells a better and more unbelievable  tale than anyone.  There's a woman who hasn't gotten out of bed in years,  it's not because she's ill, she's rich enough that she doesn't have to.  There's the head of a local computer company and his wife who haven't had a  direct conversation with each other for years, a mall full of twins, and a  man who can tell a person's emotional state by touching their nose!  An  incredible, but extremely fun mix of Americana, music, and disjointed  deadpan quips from Byrne as he plays the lead and narrator of the  story.
You will thrill at the majesty of a fashion show at the mall,  experience kareoke at a local bar, and be a mouse in the corner at a  computer board assembly line.
Make any sense at all?  Well, it will if  you give this video a look.  This is definitely a comedy, but you have to  be ready for it.  This is comedy tailor made for people with a dry sense of  humor.
This is not a video for people who need a laugh track, or overtly  funny bits to see humor to enjoy a comedy.
If, however, you see humor in  life's little irony's, you grew up or live in a small town, and like music  like that of the Talking Heads you will enjoy the show.  It's a  treasure.
You should be advised that this is NOT A MUSIC VIDEO, and most  of the Talking Head's music on the sound track is performed by someone  else.  The Talking Heads did, however, release a CD in 1986 called  ""True Stories"" that contains the music from the movie, all done  by the Talking Heads.
A highly recommend this video -- give it a try.  You may be glad you did.
5 stars.

1011079,4,6305308845,"Director and co-writer David Byrne takes us on a tour of Virgil, Texas (Population 40,000), in ""True Stories,"" a whimsical and , at times, poignant look at the characters and characteristics of rural America.  As  the town (and this could be any town, anywhere) prepares for a ""Celebration  of Specialness,"" Byrne, the on-screen narrator and host, introduces us to a  cross section of the somewhat singular citizenry, running the gamut from  the common to the eccentric.  We meet the well-to-do but lazy Miss Rollings  (Swoozie Kurtz), who never leaves her bed; Ramon (Tito Larriva) who reads  people's ""tones;"" a married couple, Earl and Kay Culver (Spalding Gray and  Annie McEnroe) who never speak directly to one another, communicating  instead through their children, who take it all in stride; a woman (Jo  Harvey Allen) who claims, among other things, that she knows the real  ""Rambo,"" and has written songs for Elvis and Michael Jackson; and Louis  Fyne (John Goodman), a lonely bachelor looking for a wife, ""Just someone to  love.""  This is a light-hearted character study of sorts, in which the  town itself must be included; for the shopping mall, the factories and  computers, the neighborhoods, empty lots and highways all factor into what  defines who we are and where we come from. It's a premise rich with  satirical possibilities, and Byrne must be given credit for not going  there.  He neither pokes fun at nor patronizes the people of Virgil, or  their town; all is viewed objectively and taken at face value, the result  being that the audience is left with a good, perhaps wistful, feeling, and  an overall positive impression of the whole experience.  Rounding out a  likable cast are Alix Elias, Amy Buffington, Richard Dowlearn and Matthew  Posey.  From the parade down main street, which includes such things as a  precision lawn-mower team, to the contest of identical twins and the talent  show that culminates the celebration, all is done in good fun.  Additional  memorable characters include Mr. Tucker (Roebuck ""Pops"" Staples), who  conjures up a love spell for Louis, and a preacher (John Ingle), who serves  up a sermon of ""Puzzlin' Evidence.""  The music is by David Byrne and his  band, The Talking Heads, and features such songs as ""Wild, Wild Life,""  ""People Like Us,"" and ""City of Dreams.""  ""True Stories"" is kind of like  looking in a mirror; it reminds us that we all come from somewhere, and  that place, wherever it is, probably isn't a whole lot different than  Virgil.  This film will take you home, and you're going to run into people  you know.  In the end, Virgil's ""Celebration of Specialness"" is an  acknowledgement of the diversity that makes us all special.  A tip of the  Stetson to Byrne and co-writers Stephen Tobolowsky and Beth Henley for  giving us a film that's both entertaining and enlightening.",958003200,2,2855,4.9491525423728815
1011080,5,6305308845,"This movie took me a few viewings to love, and love it characterizes my feelings exactly. I guess I wanted another ""Stop Making Sense"". That is a GREAT concert film. This is a movie that tells a story (actually  several stories), but it does contain some wonderful music in it. The movie  is appealing, and it grows on you. I have watched it about 10 times and am  not tired of it. For a movie that was made in and about the 80s, the theme  is still very current, although the computers shown in the film are dated.  The movie is so full of little treasures that you must see it.  And, if you  are a fan of David Byrne, then this movie is a ""must see"".",953683200,,652,4.086614173228346

1011236,5,6305308845,"This is one of my all-time favorite films.  David Byrne's peculiar sensibilities are perfectly meshed into Beth Henley's rendering of small-town Texas life that's slowly changing.  Byrne has several laugh-out-loud moments, but most of the story is told by his narrator character with a sort of bemusement, a gentle warmth and fondness for a way of life in America that's vanishing.  Byrne's soundtrack is really good, and not just the obligatory Talking Heads songs.  (This is the movie that gave the band Radiohead its name.)  His incidental music is evocative.  All of the performances are perfect, from John Goodman's early appearance as a lovable mensch to Spalding Gray's portrayal of the town's powerful yet clueless businessman.

1011262,5,6305308845,"David Byrne's first and last musical about a crazy little town in Texas and the nutty characters who live there, who each in turn perform their musical numbers. Also a love story for John Goodman and Swoozie Kurtz. This is one of John Goodman's earliest roles and he plays Louis with utmost sincerity in his search for love. He was my favorite character in this film.

This was supposed to be Byrne's conversion from rock star to movie director. However, the movie flopped. The public was not ready for something this quirky. Each character has something very eccentric about him or her and Byrne revels in that eccentricity. Then he usually has the character perform musically as well. He captures America in the mid 1980s as it is lived in a rather small town in the great open sky country of Texas. Byrne gives an intro to ""The History of Texas"" at the start of the film and it is one of the best parts. He mentions that God had to create special people who liked land which looked like this land and this is just one of his quirky yet apt observances.

The ""Parade of Specialness"" he stages is indeed special as he puts Shriners in those little cars along with the 'lawnmower brigade. I think Byrne saw this kind of thing disappearing for good and he may have been right as I don't know where someone goes to see this kind of parade nowadays.

Byrne even puts on the most oddball fashion show that has ever been put to film with one outfit, for example, made out of astroturf. He plunks this bizarre fashion show into a shopping mall which makes it even more bizarre rather than less so. Dinner with Spalding Grey as the patriarch Mr. Culver is a classic and reminds me of the dinner table back in the 1950s as we experienced it. Grey is nicely formal, ""pass this to our guest"". Grey as this strict and formal patriarchal type oddly works.

He also has a voodoo ceremony with a man in full outfit performing before the voodoo altar. This has one of the best musical numbers.

I loved this film. It is an absurdist look at life and ordinary people with odd quirks living those lives. It never gets old for me. This also exists as a Talking Heads album.  Curiously Byrne has his own band record the album to go with the movie instead of releasing the soundtrack with the characters doing the numbers.

Byrne went back to his musical career after the movie failed. But the Talking Heads did not last long after this. Byrne continued to reinvent himself musically every few years and is still doing so today. The other Talking Heads disappeared.

That is not altogether surprising, since the Talking Heads were perhaps the most authentic and original rock band since Velvet Underground. Their concert film Stop Making Sense (1984, dir. Jonathan Demme) is justifiably considered to be the most perfectly filmed musical performance to date. That film, like the Talking Heads themselves, was birthed from the New York New Wave underground scene, with true-blue eccentric David Byrne as the front man, driving force, and genius of the group. The remaining members of the band supplied a down-to-earth quality which prevented Byrne from totally succumbing to art-school loftiness. Further proof lies in the Heads True Stories (1986), and more pointedly in the fact that post-Heads Byrne, while still compelling and clever, has been decidedly uneven in his work, and unable to retain that sorely missed folksiness he had with the band.

Byrne writes, directs, narrates and stars in True Stories and it is his congenial presence which edifies all the quaint idiosyncrasies inherent in American mythology. Byrne sheds his oversized dinner suit for a black cowboy hat, hops in a red convertible, and escorts us to the fictional Virgil, Texas just in time to celebrate its 150th anniversary. Not surprisingly, what follows is hardly a linear narrative. Rather, it is an anecdotal slice of postmodern myth informed by banality, fashion, and consumerism with Byrne as our gnostic Thorton Wilder guide. Although Heaven is a place where nothing ever happens, True Stores never descends into all-too-easy cynicism. For the free spirited, Virgil is as easy to take as chocolate covered Talking Heads. Some, including the late Roger Ebert, claimed True Stories is not a musical. I disagree. Like any good musical, this film makes no claim towards pretentious realism. In Busby Berkeleys musicals, the directors always attempted to mask the eccentricities of the characters, and the choreographer. Byrnes approach is to romance his characters, with the Talking Heads lip-synching to Byrnes nine songs via good-humored abandon. The result is a refreshingly original choreography that gives the film its whimsical quality. The studio didn't know quite what to do with True Stories and, predictably, nothing like it has been attempted since, making it a standalone effort with a texture solely of its time and place.

A young, awkward, and infectiously charming John Goodman plays a bachelor whose life goal is to get married. The Wife Wanted neon sign in his yard never seems out of place in Virgil. A preacher (John Ingle) begins his sermon with a discourse on Elvis, and you do know that those newfangled barcodes are going to be used by the antichrist? I recall very similar sermons from my own childhood in the 70s. True Stories astutely captures those beautiful, real moments of unintentional, inspired surrealism.

Among Virgils inhabitants are: a married couple who haven't spoken in 15 years (Spalding Grey and Annie McEnroe, who are quite happy with the arrangement), the laziest woman in the world (Swoosie Kurtz), a pathological liar (the delightful Jo Harvey Allen) who claims Rambo was one of her sexual conquests, and R&B musician Roebuck Pops Staples and Mexican punk singer Tito Larriva (both of whom prove that Byrne and company are not Virgils only musical inhabitants).

Theres no evading the ghostliness that palls over True Stories, but it is as perfectly natural, edifying, and American an idea as Norman Rockwell providing illustrations for the National Enquirer.

1011326,5,6305308845,"As much as I hate using this word as it is over-employed by reviewers, David Byrne's 1986 comedy is a very *quirky*, oddball little film.  Ostensibly about a (fictional) town in rural Texas it is really about America as a whole and where we are going (or were, I guess).  Byrne is surprisingly non-judgmental - he simply shows us things and lets the humor take care of itself.  He is not laughing at the people of Virgil, Texas for being ignorant rubes as some reviewers have stated... he is laughing *with* them (and at them sometimes) for being human.  And he is willing to laugh at himself too - notice how he's the ONLY one wearing Western wear through the whole thing?  This is a movie that makes you feel the *joy* and wonder of existence.  It is a true ""feel-good"" movie (and again, I hate using that term).

This DVD is old and barebones.  There are no special features, not even a trailer.  It is presented in a 1.33 to 1 aspect ratio which I strongly suspect was how this low-budget film was originally shot - you can see the edges of the film frame at some points watching this (this isn't unusual, and even some big-budget movies were actually shot open-matte and cropped for theatrical showings - Kubrick famously did this with his later movies).  So I surmise that the ""formatted to fit your TV"" blurb may be a mess-up on the part of WB.

Oh well, I still love the movie itself, anyway so I give this five stars.  I just wish that WB would release a special edition or something with some actual features (yeah, right).",1385769600,,1533,4.435714285714286

1011332,5,6305308845,"This film is a MUST for lovers of quirky, charming comedy, as well as for most fans of David Byrne and the Talking Heads.

The flick is somewhat akin to the tone of the quiet-and-subtle-satire films from, say, Christopher Guest or Ricky Gervais. . . But a bit more surreal. And Byrne takes a more sympathetic, even affectionate, viewpoint toward his quirky characters. As you watch and get caught up in their personalities, you really tend to be laughing more with them, than at them.

Think ""Northern Exposure"", set in Texas, with a touch of Fellini, and you're on the right track.

Anybody who knows much about David Byrne knows that he has always been, first and foremost, an artist.  As the lead singer and songwriter for the Talking Heads, he warped the boundaries of the Rock and Pop industry, and even changed the definition of what ""top 40"" could mean.

But regardless of the medium, David will always slyly but relentlessly push the limits, as he did with this marvelous little gem of a film.  Wit, satire, nostalgia, pathos and parody are among the many tools he uses to examine the quirks and charms of human nature.  And like his song lyrics, his visual concepts are highly original, witty, and ultimately quite poignant.

This semi-mockumentary, semi musical-comedy flick will keep you chuckling and occasionally laughing aloud at the foibles and charm of all the various eccentric characters in a small Texas town as they gear up for their big sesquicentennial celebration, and pageant.

It features a humorous and endearing performance by the then up-and-coming actor John Goodman, as well as some amusing supporting roles from Swoosie Kurtz and the late, great narrative artist Spalding Gray. Also quite noteworthy is singer/actor Tito Larriva, who sings a Tex-Mex version of Byrne's song ""Radio Head"", and actress/performance-artist Jo Harvey Allen, who almost steals the show as the irrepressible ""Lying Woman"".

Byrne himself also stars as a sort of roving narrator, examining and explaining the various characters' motives.

The film features all of the songs from the Talking Heads album ""True Stories""-- some performed by them, some performed by the film's various main characters.  A real highlight is John Goodman's cowboy-soul version of ""People Like Us"", as he sings his heart out to try to find a wife.

This has been one of my favorite flix for many years, and never fails to lift my spirits and make me laugh. It's not just a ""keeper"", it's a ""sharer""-- you'll want to grab all of your friends and take them along for the ride, when you watch it for the inevitable second and third and fourth times.",1368230400,,2628,4.905191873589165

Anyway, it's a pretty funny movie, with David presenting us with a look into a small-town USA that has an interesting cast of characters almost as weird as how David presents himself. It's a relatable kind of weird that makes you think this could be your hometown all along, that beneath it all they're just normal folks dealing with a society that's changing around them and trying to be normal about it as possible. Of course, the round-robin performance of ""Wild Wild Life"" will always stick out in my mind as the highlight of the movie. And...who is that popping up in the middle of the performance? Meatloaf? Pretty good facsimile if he isn't. Definitely worth a watch.",1344556800,,943,4.652694610778443
1011363,5,6305308845,"David Byrne's architectural education shines through in this movie. The characters are memorable, and the sublime editorial on rural America and development trends is both humorous and true.  For example in one of the opening scenes Byrnes is driving through a open and bland Texas landscape framed by an enormous super elevated interstate exchange (with no sign of development or traffic in sight) and he says something like ""Freeways are the pyramids of our time"".

It is not your typical lip-synch makeover. Surprisingly, the Talking Heads songs are sung by real people, which makes it refreshing and real. The evangelist's presentation of ""Puzzling Evidence"" is perhaps the most powerful multimedia presentation I have ever seen.

It is not for everybody though. If you are an architect, planner, landscape architect, or just a Talking Heads fan I highly recommend it.

1011386,5,6305308845,"""True Stories"" was inspired by newspaper clippings about strange people and situations in Texas, there was indeed a couple who never spoke to each other, only through their children; there were shut-ins, bizarre fashion shows and of course a few witch doctors. There are many fine character actors in this film, the one who gets over-looked the most often is the late Spalding Gray, who plays the father who doesn't talk to his wife, and who illustrates consumerism on his dining room table. Spalding has been in a few other films worth checking out, ""The Killing Fields"", ""Beaches"", ""King of the Hill"" (the movie, not the cartoon), ""Kate & Leopold"" as well as his many filmed monologues, which are these impressive shows where he talks without break for 90 min!

This movie is special, its so strange and quirky, we're given a glimpse into these people's lives, and even though the situations are ridiculous, we can connect with the feelings of loneliness and the steps we take to find a connection with the world around us. Don't shrug this movie off so easily, its a true gem!",1311379200,4,1079,4.770053475935829

I like old school punk rock circa '77 so I was somewhat drawn to it. The cover is cool and has David Bryne of the Talking Heads who I never really enjoyed. The Heartbreakers, Television and a bunch more are better early NY punk bands.

The music and movie was pretty boring and the other parts too long and drawn out overall. It was different seeing John Goodman in a very early role, he oddly looks the same as he does now but his acting wasn't as good. Other than that it sucked. Very 1980's. A decade I despise.

David Bryne is working with St. Vincent  now who is a talented musician and lady so we'll see how that goes.

Purchased this on VHS for $1. Been buying VHS movies recently since no one else seems to. You can pick up stuff you'd never acquire otherwise if you were to rent, it narrows the choice down, cheap, there can be a big lack of choice (all major studio films, nothing rare/weird that gets your attention to buy) at certain stores so it can be a fun gamble or lousy one.

1011390,4,6305308845,"It's not uncommon to have wildly veering reactions to the same films at different times.  My biggest problem with David Byrne and Talking Heads was their obvious artiness.  the first time I saw TRUE STORIES, my reaction was, ""what's he trying to be? the Texan Andy Warhol?""  The second time I saw it, years later, I asked myself, ""Well, what's so wrong about being Texas' answer to Andy Warhol?  You get as many interesting characters in rural America as you do hanging out at the Factory.  Why not?""

If that sounds equivocal, well, good: that's what art should be about, rethinking your positions.  Apparently, there's been an ongoing debate about whether or not David Byrne is condescending towards his characters or just presenting them as the loveable eccentrics he thinks you should perceive them to be.  Well, why not both?  The teller of just about ANY tale is condescending towards his/her characters.  If they're your characters, hey, you're in the superior position.  You're calling the shots, Mr. Storyteller Man.  On the other hand, that doesn't mean you don't just love the bezeesus out 'em, your creations.  Even if David IS emulating Andy, he's on higher ground morally: these are paid actors, after all, not some exhibitionist kid performing for the camera 'cuz he thinks he's the next Superstar and that that means something.

And thank the great storyteller in the sky that Mr. Byrne DID use professional (and quite good) actors in his film.  They bring out the humanity in these small town eccentrics in a way that more jaded scenesters never could.  That's particularly true of the love-starved shlub Louis Fyne (John Goodman), who is actually quite touching.  But you could say the same for veteran actress Swoosie Kurtz as Miss Rollings, the laziest woman in Texas and Jo Harvey Allen, the lying woman.  Byrne himself, a non-actor, adopts the affectless Warhol-esque pose that often served him well in interviews.  Since he's not a trained in the dramatic arts (or even much of a natural, it appears), this willfully naive stance actually works for him here too.  He's there for other characters to bounce off of. And bounce they do.

TRUE STORIES appeal lies, to a large extent, in its unique blend of knowingness and innocence.  First time out, I thought the innocence largely affected.  Now I think it's actually the dominant viewpoint.  One thing I will say, TRUE STORIES is more layered than it may first appear.  I'd say it's earned its cult status.",1293753600,,2478,4.899038461538462

I couldn't decide whether or not writer-director-actor David Byrne was making a satire on the American way of life, or if he was just gently poking fun at ordinary people while deeply respecting them.  I think that perhaps he approached the story as if he were from another planet, landed in Virgil, Texas, and was bemused by what he saw.

David Byrne, lead singer of the Talking Heads is the eyes and ears and narrator of this odd, but fun film.  To quote one of the movie's opening scenes, ""This is a movie about a bunch of people in Virgil, Texas.""  And that pretty much sums up the show.

David Byrne arrives in town to experience the  preparations for and the variety show associated with the sesquicentennial of the state of Texas.  Along the way we meet an engaging assortment of characters including Louis Fynes (John Goodman) who's man goal in life is to get married, ""The Lying Woman"" who tells the tallest tales ever, a woman who is so rich she never has to get out of bed, the owner of the town's major employer, a computer company, etc.  You will get to visit the local dance club, the mall, a fashion show, a revivalist church meeting, the town parade, and, of course the show itself.

David Byrne does a fanastic job as the lead man, and, humorously, he is the only one in the whole show who actually wears western styled clothes.  He also comments on things as diverse as driving, shopping, and a variety of other unpredicted things.

The music of ""The Talking Heads"" is featured throughout the show, but not performed by them, for the most part.

1011429,4,6305308845,"The extremely influential band Talking Heads had begun to self-destruct by 1986, and in truth the film TRUE STORIES is more a David Byrne project than a Talking Heads project--but regardless of who-what-where-when it is a quietly bizarre satire of all things Texas, as any one who has spent time in a small Texas town can attest.

The town in question is Virgil, a community experiencing growing pains due to the advent of the computer industry and a new mall that is drawing folks away from the downtown area.  The Texas Sesquicentennial provides a loose theme: promoted as a ""Celebration Of Specialness,"" events include a fashion show, a parade, and most importantly a talent show.  Along the way Byrne, acting as a sort of niave visitor-interviewer-narrator, more or less introduces us to the more eccentric locals: the love-lorn Louis (John Goodman); the Civic Leader (Spalding Gray) and his wife (Annie McEnroe), happily married although they have not spoken in years; Miss Rollings (Swoozie Kurtz), so rich she can't even be bothered to leave her bed.

The main thrust of the film follows Louis' efforts to find a wife.  So desperate that he advertises on television, Louis draws everything from new-age-yoga practictioners to a woman with a dozen children.  Most particularly he encounters The Lying Woman (Jo Harvey Allen) and The Cute Woman (Alix Elias), both of whom are running characters throughout the film.  There is also The Computer Guy (Matthew Posey), who is sending signals straight up in the hopes of contacting space aliens; The Preacher (John Ingle), who is convinced that an unspecified conspiracy is taking over the world; Ramon (Tito Larriva), who thinks he can read your mind through your nose; and a Voodoo priest (Pop Staples), who claims to be able bless you with love and wealth.

This being, in theory at least, a Talking Heads film, music pops up from time to time.  The score for TRUE STORIES is very underrated by most fans of the band, who complain ""it isn't Talking Heads, it's David Byrne!""  Well, if it isn't Talking Heads its a very good imitation of it; the real annoyance seems to be that the music serves the nature of the film: deeply ironic and tinged with a Texan plantiveness.  Pieces such as ""Love For Sale,"" ""Radio Head,"" ""Dream Operator,"" ""City of Dreams,"" and ""Wild Wild Life"" (which was a top forty hit) are memorably ironic, witty, and strange in the best traditions of the band.

Now, TRUE STORIES is indeed a cult film in the classic sense: a movie that provokes an extremely positive response in a minority of viewers.  The key word is ""minority.""  Most people aren't going to like the film.  It's glitchy.  It's odd.  It's moody.  It has a certain sadness.  But for those who have an eye for it, TRUE STORIES is charming, witty, clever.  The DVD is tiresome--the transfer and sound are merely okay and it is ""formatted to fit your screen""--but even so, strongly recommended.

(May contain spoilers.)

This film is not a Talking Heads film. It is a movie about a bunch of people in the fictional town of Virgil, Texas. One of the main things that makes this film really enjoyable is the brilliantly casted assemble of characters.  Among the movie's talented cast is ""Rosanne"" star John Goodman. in one of his earlier roles. Among the cast of quirky characters are the Culvers, a happily married couple who haven't spoken directly to each other in years, a woman who is in love with love, a woman who is so rich she doesn't have to get out of bed and a Latino who can see the future. But the real highlights of this movie are John Goodman's portrayal of a country music loving single man who just wants someone to love. Jo Harvey Allen plays ""The Lying Woman"" who gets through life telling outrageous lies. Last but not least, David Byrne's unnamed narrator character.

Scenes that make this movie fantastic are the wild fashion show, the narrator's dinner with the Culver's and John Goodman's character's performance of the Talking Heads track ""People Like Us"". This movie was not a box office hit perhaps it was because of the misconception that this film was ver much like the Talking Heads' 1984 concert film, ""Stop Making Sense"". But the film became very popular with the great souls that bothered to see it.

Like many others, I believe that this film was cheated of a proper DVD release. This DVD has no special features and barely contains a main menu. I would suggest getting the VHS. I think the picture is sharper and the sound is clearer. Hopefully, the movie will get better DVD treatment. Overall, this film is highly recommended for Talking Heads fans and for fans of very funny 80's films.

1011431,5,6305308845,"While I will admit there are better-made films out there, True Stories remains my favorite movie of all time. I like it because, much like its themes and characters (and life itself), it is imperfect. But its imperfection becomes part of its genius, especially on repeated viewings. It's not really a movie with a plot, except maybe for Louis' search for love. It illustrates ideas, themes and moods through a series of arresting images, narration, dialogue, humor and music. The film looks at its subjects with Byrne's mixture of bemusement and satire, both handled with the sort of wide-eyed innocence of an alien visiting Earth from another galaxy. As a result, we see this town and its people through the eyes of Byrne, and therefore start to look at the familiar and mundane in new ways. I will not bother to spend a lot of the time others have spent talking about the plot or what makes this film great--just buy it. It's only 10 bucks. Some favorite quotes:

I was also bemoaning the lack of a widescreen edition, but if this is really open matte, then we have here more visual information than a 16:9 ratio would have.

However, I got this from a poster on the IMDb messageboard for the film, and he did not provide proof. I'm still searching for documentation, but to no avail.

1011460,5,6305308845,"I first saw this film on cable back in the early 1990's and taped it and it's one of those films that I watch from time to time over the years.

It helps to be a fan of the Talking Heads as it's essentially a T.H. film due to the fact that their music is featured within it and they are featured in a video montage of various ""commercials"" in the middle of it and David Burns plays the lead.

Based on a virtual town in Texas named Virgil and it's celebration of specialness, that is, showcasing one's unique talents in this small community, the film takes us through the days leading to the parade and show that is held in a field at the end of the week. We see various quirky characters like Lewis Fine, a large panda shaped guy who is basically a nice guy at heart but really wants a wife and spends his time in the film trying to get one. Lewis is superbly played by John Goodman and by the end, ends up marrying the laziest woman in the town, a well to do gal played by Swoozie Kurtz. She spends her days in bed eating, watching TV, reading and what not and she never lifts a fork but has a machine turn her pages, feed her etc - that's how lazy she is.

The match making is done through mystical powers of prayer by an African American man in a modest little house with his family who does a ritual in a special room he created for such a purpose and it's that and a chance viewing of Lewis singing at the show from the lazy woman that sparks the relationship and marriage of the two.

What I love about this film is it's offbeat characters during the mid 80's when that part of Texas is booming as people move down there for the semi conductor industry that sprang up down in those parts. I love how it portrays some of the characters, the mayor, Earl Culver, played by the late Spalding Gray, was almost evangelical in his zest for things such as the semi conductor industry, he's rich, the mayor and the emcee of the talent show and seems somewhat at odds with his family as they are presented in a stiff fashion.

There is the lying girl, who works at the semi conductor plant who is always telling tall tales of she doing this and that and people listen to her sceptically. Then there is a scene at a Fundimentalist church where the preacher is discussing through a song about things he fears in the song, ""Puzzling Evidence"".

All in all, a cute, quirky film that is well worth a viewing, or more.

The one caveat is that there is no widescreen version of this film released so it's pan and scan only and apparently it was shot in widescreen. I have heard rumors that it won't be re-released in an improved version but we'll see. If David Byrne gets a hold of it, we might see a widescreen and/or blue-ray edition as well.

Dvd - 1 star

I am choosing to leave the review of the film itself to others. The film is great, and worth seeing. This review focuses on the mediocre dvd issued by Warner.

I was quite surprised and disappointed that Warner Brothers chose to release this dvd only in a full screen 'pan-and-scan' version, with absolutely no extras. The best way to appreciate this film is to be lucky enough to see it on the big screen. Byrne used many wide-screen still compositions to set the tone throughout the film, which are broken up into 'pan-and-scan' segments to fit the tv screen on this version. It is not unlike trying to watch a Kubrick film on cable or video - it doesn't really capture the essence of the original film. The video quality on this dvd is just not up really to current dvd standards. Also, having seen a short documentary about the making of this film, many years ago, and owning the amazing coffee-table book that was put out to accompany the film (with the full script + photos by Byrne, William Eggleston & others), I know there is worthy material that could have been included as extras. Warner chose a no-frills dvd release.

This is such an under appreciated film, and fans and new viewers deserve a far better treatment of it on dvd. Having viewed it, I chose not to purchase this full-screen dvd until a superior version is made available, and urge others to consider this before purchasing.",1167264000,11,1429,4.54863813229572

This is a must for Talking Heads fans, and for any viewer who yearns for an originality that is lost in standard Hollywood fare.

This is a really joyous and upbeat kind of multi-purpose movie. Put it on when you're feeling blue. It's great to watch over and over -- I must have watched the lip sync segment a hundred times. I'll do so a hundred more times. I hope you don't mind LOUD  music.

Of small town life, David Byrne is both respectful AND willing to poke a little fun; and there's more going on here than can be processed by mere mortals. I mean, supposedly there were 50 sets of twins cast -- can you find them all? I can't. What does it all mean?

The ""Puzzling Evidence"" segment has to be seen to be believed. ""Mike Wallace wants my body"". That lying woman's hat! That preacher! That sermon! There's some incredible eye & ear candy going down.

The glaring absence of the widescreen format detracts from an otherwise satisfactory DVD -- hey, you just put it in the player and it starts playing. No Spam!

The story, such as it is, centers around a celebration in a small Texas town. That is the element that holds everything together. Other than that, it just looks at slices out of the lives of some of the inhabitants of this town. It seems that the most important thing that all of the inhabitants have in common is being weird.

Though it has little in the way of story, it did keep my attention. I wondered what was going to happen next and what bit of lunacy was about to transpire. Detracting from the story was the inclusion of numerous songs; in a sense it was like an old fashioned musical. The story is just an excuse for the songs. These were not in the Broadways style but they were well done. If you like this sort of thing, that would be an attraction; for me, it was a distraction but not one that I minded overmuch.

1011502,5,6305308845,"I have always loved True Stories, but it's not for everyone.  This is one ingenious but quirky movie that plays on multiple levels all at the same time.  The box cover describes True Stories as ""a completely cool, multi-purpose movie,"" and that's about as good a description as there can be for a film almost impossible to describe.  The film takes the form of a documentary of the sesquicentennial celebration in Virgil, Texas, with Talking Heads front man David Byrne cruising into town in his red convertible to narrate the events.  Byrne is, in my opinion, an underappreciated genius, and what he managed to do here was to capture a wonderful slice of Americana.  Virgil isn't a small town, but it has a small town feel, surrounded by flat land as far as the eye can see - land destined to be developed in the coming years.  The townspeople are the true stars of the film, though; most of them are not even given names, and I think this is because they are not so much individuals as representatives of everyday men and women.  You have, for example, the Laziest Woman on Earth (Swoosie Kurtz), who has not gotten out of bed for years and years, the Cute Woman, and the Lying Woman (Jo Harvey Allen) - who continually steals the show with some of the most outrageous comments you've ever heard.  The silent masses are just regular people going about their regular lives, most of them the opposite of glamorous, just the kind of folks you probably see in your own local shopping malls.  The only difference is that here, thanks to David Byrne, you notice these people - and I think that is very important.  When these people get up and lip synch to a song like Wild Wild Life, it doesn't matter how weird they are - they are just having fun being themselves.

Of course, the star and central figure of True Stories is a reasonably svelte John Goodman; he plays Louis Fyne, a man desperate to find a woman to share his life with.  He pays for ads on television, and even has a Wife Wanted sign in his front yard, but nothing seems to work.  This is certainly a character I can identify with.  Louis is as excited as everyone else in town over the big doings for Virgil's Celebration of Specialness.  And why not?  You get to see the world's strangest fashion show, enjoy the big parade featuring such sights as Shriners in little red Mustangs and a precision lawn mower marching team, and end the festivities with a great big local talent show outside of town.  The parade speaks volumes; as the townsfolk watch it wind away into the distance, they may well have a sense that life as they have known it will soon disappear as the population swells and modern conveniences trump their connection to one another and the town.  Despite a good bit of off-beat humor in this film, it does leave you feeling somewhat sad and nostalgic.

Of course, one has to mention the music of True Stories.  It is a pity that plans to release a soundtrack featuring recordings by the actors and actresses in the film fell through because these songs are an integral part of the film (the Talking Heads supplied only three of the songs themselves).  You can buy the album featuring the Talking Heads performing all of these songs (and it is an outstanding album), but People Like Us seemingly belongs to Louis Fyne after you watch the movie, and ""Kay Culver"" gives an unforgettable performance of Dream Operator.

Inevitably, you'll either ""get"" this movie or you won't, and I don't think you can predict anyone's reaction to the film until he or she actually watches it.  It is exceedingly quirky, almost surreal at times, and filled with off-the-wall comments that will not even register with some viewers.  I don't think it's possible to hate this movie, though.  It either leaves a lasting imprint on your mind or instantly disappears from your memory.

1011505,4,6305308845,"What is this strange movie about? Shopping malls, easily (and shabbily) constructed suburban building projects, computer dating, lonliness and the pursuit of attention, mass media, metal buildings, computers, evangelist preachers, the disappearance of culture into the principles of the ledger sheet and the skyscraper. These and other topics pervade ""True Stories'"" disparate plot lines and imagery. David Byrne took on the entire emerging power establishment of the late 1980s in this film. Today the film views like a warning, like a bleak testament to the disappearance of a previous way of life. Most of us live in the culmination of what this film seemed to prophesize. ""True Stories"" is cultural criticism embedded in campy film.

Byrne had played with the theme of mainstream alienation before. ""Don't Worry About the Government"" (from ""Talking Heads '77""),  ""The Big Country"" (from ""More Songs About Buildings and Food""), and ""The Road to Nowhere"" (from ""Little Creatures"") provide just three examples. These songs attempt to elevate peoples' perceptions about their immediate culture. So does ""True Stores"".

Not everyone will enjoy this movie. Sometimes the pace moves along like molasses. Some of it feels very dated. It has an intentionally stilted perspective as it plays with common expectations and perceptions. Some of the humor is corny. In short, it's an experimental movie. That said, it also contains moments of absolute brilliance, penetrates some then unknown depths of humor, and has the ability to open eyes to the bizarre aspects of the culture of 1986 that we have all inherited. It also invites comparisons (in theme) to Luis Bu&ntilde;uel's ""The Discrete Charm of the Bourgeoisie"". That and the cinematography of the vast Texas landscape is stunning.

One scene that really brings out the film's themes is ""The Parade of Specialness"" in Virgil, Texas (with the Shriners in cars and the 'lawnmower brigade'). This scene is more about the disappearance of small town culture and pride and less about the freakishness of small town parades. As the painfully brief parade passes, the crowd stares at the tail end of the festivities as it slowly fades away into an empty distance. Where are they going? Away, seemingly forever, to nowhere. And quickly.

Some of the other brilliant scenes include: the fashion show with wildly ostentatious and meaningless fashions paraded past gaping mall goers; the dinner with the Culvers (""pass this to our guest""); the ""Puzzlin' Evidence"" and ""Love For Sale"" montages; the film's climax ""The Big Show"". Byrne's intro ""The History of Texas"" is one of the biggest highlights. John Goodman, in one of his earliest roles, plays Louis with sincerity and sometimes over the top humor. And Spaulding Gray displays only absolute mastery when he appears on the screen. His almost surreal introduction to ""The Big Show"" would stand up to infinite viewings.

Lastly, calling ""True Stories"" a ""Talking Heads Movie"" must be one of the greatest misnomers of that band's career. This was Byrne's movie (the other 3 members only appear in very brief glimpses and in the re-edited cut of the ""Wild Wild Life"" video). In 1986 the band stood on a pinnacle of popularity following 1985's ""Little Creatures"". People with money in their eyes likely thought to capitalize on the band's success (or perhaps that's how the film received funding?). Unfortunately, the band also found itself breaking apart at the seams. In an issue of Rolling Stone at the time, the other band members (most notably Tina Weymouth and Chris Frantz) openly attacked Byrne. They depicted this movie as Byrne's attempt to put himself above the band. Weymouth even compared Byrne to a five year old. Nastiness ensued, and the film ""True Stories"" remains one of the pieces in the puzzle of the band's demise. They released one more album in 1988, ""Naked"". That was it, apart from a few very cursory ""reunions"". The DVD re-release pretty much removes the ""Talking Heads"" tie-in that created so much tension during the film's original release. This is good. ""True Stories"" stands up better as a ""David Byrne"" film than as a ""Talking Heads"" film.",1098403200,50,4156,5.131462333825701
1011506,5,6305308845,"Who would have thought that Byrne and the Talking Heads would make such a sweet movie? It's a satire, of course, but the characters, rather than being ridiculed, are adorable. The perfect casting and relaxed pace give it just the right documentary feel, Byrne's reedy narration gives it just the right edge, and the story line plays out nicely. It's very watchable.
Listenable, too. The songs are a blast, whether lip-synched by the 'locals' hilariously or sung by the cast. The Talking Heads as the backing band for the songs are terrific, with some gorgeous pedal steel guitar thrown in.
For Spalding Gray fans, it is a classic performance, if brief.

The funny thing was, the Germans couldn't tell the fantasy from the reality.  They thought the Shriners riding their little motorbikes around in a parade was something out of David Byrne's imagination!

1011508,4,6305308845,"Talking Heads frontman David Byrne follows trailblazer Kinky Friedman (the original New Yawk musician/raconteur to enter the Lone Star state of mind) with this subtly satirical Texas travelogue from 1986. It is no easy task to pigeonhole ""True Stories""- part social satire, part long-form music video, part mockumentary. Fans of droll humor (and Byrne's art-school sensibilities) will enjoy the film. The episodic vignettes about the quirky but generally likable inhabitants of sleepy Virgil, Texas should hold your fascination once you buy into ""tour-guide"" Byrne's bemused anthropological detachment (some might say, ""conceit"", but there is no detectable mean-spiritedness here). The pseudo-documentary approach and low-ley ensemble performances presages (by a good 10-15 years) the gently satirical ""mockumentaries"" Christopher Guest & Co. have become so synonymous with. The excellent cinematography seems to get overlooked by reviewers and is worth a mention. The DVD transfer is not as dismal as some would lead you to believe, although I would agree that it is a shame that ""pan and scan"" is the only format currently offered (but for such a low list price, there is not much room for complaint). The audio is quite adequate. Fans of the obscure and offbeat will rejoice.",1082937600,2,1278,5.459595959595959

Come on.

No extra features, no insights, no commentary, and TWO - get this - TWO menu selections - either to select a scene, or simply play the movie.

Don't buy this - wait until a version comes out that shows evidence someone has given this incredible movie some respect.

1011540,2,6305308845,"When I received this DVD as a gift, I tried very hard to watch, after seeing the glowing reviews written by some of the people here.  Unfortunately, while I found certain scenes extremely funny, I just could not get into the movie *as a whole*, and I finally just lost patience halfway through and had to turn it off.  The trouble was, I felt like there were far too many extraneous shots, or lines that just came out of nowhere.  And, if I may be blunt, I didn't care for some of the renditions of the Talking Heads' songs.  I like this band, I really do--the trouble is, I don't like the way the songs came off *in this movie*.  I also admit I'd hoped to hear some from Remain in Light and Speaking in Tongues, which are my two favorite albums of theirs by far.
As I said, there were good points.  David Byrne himself is definitely the most prominent one...as others have said, his commentary is quite funny to listen to, and I get a kick out of the intent expression on his face as he delivers these strange remarks.  Also, certain scenes were very funny--the one that makes fun of all those 80s music videos was spot on, and just about had me rolling on the floor laughing!  The woman who never got out of bed also had me laughing hysterically.  And, you have to admit there's a certain truth to the dating-by-computer mishaps...it's just amazing that even so far back it would occur to David Byrne to portray this.
Unfortunately, half of the movie (such as that ridiculous fashion show) simply had me raising an eyebrow and returning a stare as blank as Byrne's could be sometimes.  I simply could not enjoy this experience as a whole, and while I cannot give it a 1-star review due to its good points, this is something I will definitely not be seeing again...better to sell it back and get myself something else.",1078531200,4,1819,4.419161676646707

minor carp: warner's dvd edition is rather shoddy. although the sound is excellent, the image is pan-and-scan and the video transfer itself seems to be nothing more than the original 80's transfer dumped on dvd. that's a shame. sadly it's the only option available at the moment. i'm still hoping for a criterion edition ...",1050105600,5,627,4.557522123893805

For all of you out there that think the funniest movies you've ever seen are Austin Powers and Dumb and Dumber, take a step back. The sheer insanity and unpredicatability that make David Byrne wonderful in this movie count for much more than the slapstick humor you'll find in the script of any other movie out there. The more you watch True Stories, the more you'll see yourself in the charecters and understand the odd brand of logic that David Byrne is trying to impress upon the rest of the world. If I had a goal, it would be to show this movie (all right, and Yellow Submarine- if you like this one please check that out too) to the entire world, just to make them think.

You don't have to be a Talking Heads fan to enjoy the movie ..., but you may become one after watching the film. The idea of inserting songs from the Talking Heads' album of the same name as this movie into different parts of the film, and having the actors sing them was a great idea. The ""Wild Wild Life"" scene is simply classic. John Goodman portrays the very likeable Louis Fyne - a person who is looking for a wife and from the start you're wanting Louis to get what he wants out of life.

It's one of the most bizarre films I've seen, but somehow manages to sum up what it's like living in a small American town. David Byrne wanders through Virgil, Texas meeting various odd characters, accompanied by the music of the Talking Heads. The off-the-wall commentary is perhaps the best part of the film; driving through the pancake-flat plains of Texas, Byrne comments, ""The radio reception is great out here!"" Or when he drives down and endlessly straight highway: ""Fancy driving!""

To those like myself who don't mind an occassional quirky film that doesn't follow standard plot elements, this is a treasure.  With odd middle American characters breaking into joyous Talking Head numbers, there is something none but the most cynical among us won't like. It is also deeply funny if you consider the characters: The lonely overweight computer engineer (John Goodman) who uses technology to seek a wife (this movie is pre-internet mind you), the equally lonely television dependent millionairess who never leaves her majestic suburban Texas home or bed for that matter, or the cheerful middle class couple who haven't spoken to eachother in years using their kids to communicate and many others. Byrne treats his characters and the monotonous Texas town with the boarded-up-mainstreet-but-burgeoning-tech-sector with equal parts ridicule and affection. They are exaggerated representations of the Middle America we all know and love (or hate). The film is also a commentary on how technology and the media have forever negatively altered our social linkages. I loved it nonetheless.",1010534400,,1182,5.349462365591398
1011590,1,6305308845,"Understand that I am a fan of David Byrne's music. Talking Heads has long been one of my favorite bands. I also count Stop Making Sense among the top concert documentaries of all time. True Stories, though, is just really, really crummy.
Sometime during the 80's Byrne apparently concluded that he was a Renaissance man who could take on any creative medium. Though he was a kickass bandleader and entertainer, this film shows that he was clearly not a screenwriter, director, or actor.
The ideas behind the film had potential, but the actual product is weak, dull, contrived, and amateurish - basically a student film. A few earnest performances by real actors (primarily John Goodman) only serve to emphasize how bad the other elements are. At 89 minutes it's about 84 minutes too long. It contains one fun mini-video of Wild Wild Life, one clever line spoken by Byrne's character, and one good joke about Texas. That's it.
Buy this video only on the assumption that you'll watch it once and then give it away (to someone you don't like very much).",1009584000,2,1050,4.774725274725275
1011591,4,6305308845,"When David Byrne conceived of this movie idea he was probably believing that he was only slightly ahead of his audience.  Unfortunatrly, he was years ahead of them in terms of technology, music, and ideology.  It's a wonderful film, a scathing indictment of the negative changes rampent technology was bringing on simple people... and a study on the price of loneliness on everyone. But, it no doubt did not catch on to an audience that was overpowered by the visuals and ideas in this movie.
The music is simply wonderful, the children singing ""Hey Now"" in a field that is being taken over by urban sprawl is worth the price of the movie alone.  Talking heads interject several times with shameless music videos.  And characters in the movie sing Talking Heads songs... in voices that were made from you and me.
This movie, in which David Byrne makes his directorial debut Byrne tours us around the town  of Virgil, Texas, and introduces us to the citizens of that town, their interests, their industry, and their shopping mall.  John Goodman's character looks for a love.. and it all ends in a talent show that was wonderfully edited and gave it a sense of excitment.  Goodman doesn't sing too bad, either.
In my opinion this was one of the top Rock and Roll movies ever made (it should be noted that the best Rock and Roll Concert Documentry is ""Stop Making Sense"" also by the Talking Heads.",1007510400,6,1394,4.66530612244898

1011593,5,6305308845,"This film is important for a number of reasons. It's like watching Noam Chomsky's Manufacting Consent, and its examination of American values, only from the narrative of a seemingly objective observer. David Byrne has always been fascinated by suburbia and our artificial landscapes. Just check out the Talking Heads second album. The title says it all, ""More Songs about Buildings and Food"".
With a humorous, deadpan objectivity, Byrne explores not just manufactured Texas, and its corregated warehouses, shopping malls; Byrne also shows us the future, where semiconductor, hardware and software companies will dominate. He also examines America's ""live to shop"" credo; walking through a shopping mall and explaining how Main Street has been replaced by this climate controlled, muzak laden pleasure center, where you can always bump into a friend, and parking's never a problem.
Spalding Gray plays the nutty chairman of the local microchip company; delivering deadpan lines and absurd hand gestures (similar to Byrne on stage and obviously pulled from the choreography of any politician or CEO), lecturing about the brave new world of computers (remember, this was about 15 years ago; so it's somewhat prophetic).
John Goodman plays Louis Fine, a lonely man, just lookin' for someone to love; while locked up in the sterile room in the plant. ""It's pretty okay, I guess,"" he quips from his cell. And, in America, since you can purchase anything you want, Louis figures he might as well go on TV and advertise for a bride.
There are lots of other zany character in Virgil, Texas; like the ""sweet"" woman, surrounded by teddy bears and pink furry things, who can't accept any bad in the world; not even a sad song. And the woman who never leaves her bed, 'cause everything she needs is either on the TV or in a catalog. And it all takes place during Virgil's sesquicentennial Celebration of Specialness. Byrne delivers lines like Buster Keaton would, if he had talked; funny,ironic, and over some folk's heads. If you're not on the same wavelength as David, this film would seem, well, dumb. But it's not. It's brilliant, in an aburd, silly way.
This movie is a must see for anyone interested in rock and roll, the sociology of latter 20th Century America (especially their work and leisure habits), and really big grass suits.",984960000,6,2327,5.0310880829015545

Everyone can relate to someone in this movie on one level or another... haven't we all felt lonely, or outcasted, or unheard, or just plain ordinary?
What I love best is the ""drivin' through"" appeal. The same kind of thing you may experience in people watching or while on vacation, when you hear snippets of other's conversations, observe a stranger's intereaction with another, etc. But here you have names and you're invited into their homes and you get to see what goes on after the fact, so to speak.

It is not funny, per s&eacute;.. even  though it has some humorous moments.  It is an abstract film about a little  town named Virgil in the state of Texas.  Texas is about to turn 150 years  old, so Virgil, a town whose main industry is computers, is celebrating its  ""specialness"" with parades and talent shows.  It is narrated by  the one and only David Byrne (who drives around in a red convertable).
The movie really has no real plot (except for Louis, played by John  Goodman, trying to find a wife).  It just explores the lives of people in  Virgil.  These are the people that everyone knows: the lazy person, the  liar, and the love-looker... we know these characters and encounter them in  our everyday lives.  John Goodman does great acting, there is some great  music, and David Byrne says some things that make us laugh... and some that  make us think.
As the tagline said, it is a completely cool multi-purpose  movie.  I love the indy approach to making it.. and the end, when Mr. Byrne  talks about how by forgetting all the details we can see something as it  really is.. that always makes me stop to think.
