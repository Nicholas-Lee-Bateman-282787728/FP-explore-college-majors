8193923,5,B0008GPJ4S,"As you might have read from my other reviews I am a die-hard Leslie Sansone fan. I use this video when I want to do some good weight training along with my walking. This is interval training: you do about 3-4 minutes of brisk walking, followed by the same amount of time of weight training. I definitely work up a sweat with this video. I noticed with some other Leslie workouts that reviewers talked about sometimes they got poor quality dvds. All of my workouts are in vhs format and I have used them for 3-4 years now with no problems.",1133308800,3,538,4.336633663366337
