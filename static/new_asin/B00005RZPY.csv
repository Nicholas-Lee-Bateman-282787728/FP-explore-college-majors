1658531,4,B00005RZPY,"Much better than I was expecting.  Has the feel of a 'made for Sci-Fi Channel' budget and acting, but that's not always a bad thing.  The plot held together all the way through and the effects were not terrible.  They were overly obviously CG but worked within the structure and feel of the movie.
This is NOT boring if you ARE looking for more than just 90 solid minutes of Mobile Suits fighting.  The characters are simplistic but interesting and they move the human drama along just fine.  Common threads found in many Gundam plots are to be found in G-Saviour as well, such as the moral dilema of conflicting loyalties and understanding for one's self what the right thing is to do in overwhelming and difficult situations.
The spectacle of the final MS battle does not dissapoint when it comes time, so it seems there is something here for both people looking for the pathos of human drama and MS fans wanting to see mechs battling it out.",1014940800,2,944,4.562130177514793
1658532,1,B00005RZPY,"I really hate this movie because of the Stupid Surround Sound.
I could barely hear the actors speaking. There should have been more fighting and less talking. Even I can think of making a better Gundam Movie based on the Gundam Series. This movie is a waste of money and I think everyone should not buy it.",1014681600,,306,4.385964912280702
1658533,1,B00005RZPY,"This is a waste. Story line is so Boring!..Plot is very very slow...Less Mondo Mecha...The only good thing is the CG...but that's not enough!..The first 30 mins , you just only see 2 mobile suit show up in a few seconds..one is a worker type another one is the commander. I don't feel like I'm watching Gundam!... They tried to focus on that BORING LIQUID THING!...Sunrise should make the story line better than this , the Action Scene and CG are less than 30% of the movie....The rest (70%)_You'll see poor acting, slow plot....less Mobile Suit scenes than you expect.......DISSAPPOITED!",1011916800,,588,4.89
1658534,1,B00005RZPY,"In my opinion Bandai Entertainment could've done much better job with this DVD. Firstly th movie is not in the widescreen format (misssing part of the original movie), I really don't know what kinda deal Bandai got but I'm sure they could've at least try to get the original version of the movie. Secondly, extras are non-existing, I mean nothing, just still form the movie and previews from other Mobile Suit Gundam series. What I fail to understand is that there's not even a description of the Mobile Suits featured in this movie, including the G-Saviour. And finally the menus are boring and dull. Again I realy don't know how far is the reach (""pull"") that Bandai Entertainment has but to my eyes the G-Saviour DVD is a failure.
Now the movie. This movie is just a stupid mistake of trying to portray the Gundam Universe on real life. To me that's all it is, a mistake, an error, something should've never happen. The Acting is terrible, the worst I've seen in a long time. Plot (if there's any) is weak and transparent. The CG (Computer Generated Graphics) are good but then they're not featured enough.
This movie should've never happen, this is just to show you that
the Gundam Universe should stay in the animation world.",1011744000,3,1230,4.6728110599078345
1658535,3,B00005RZPY,"unfortunately G-Saviour is only a decent movie.  The acting involved is somewhat mediocre, but one thing the movie has going for it is the awesome CG.  The CG itself merits a 5 star rating (unfortunately there isn't enough fighting in the gundams), but the acting and storyline are lacking tremendously, which is why i rate this movie 3 stars.  i do recommend this movie to any gundam fan, but if you aren't a gundam fan, please don't start with this one, try another gundam title first.",1010793600,2,487,4.6395348837209305
1658536,4,B00005RZPY,"The year is Universal Century 223 and the Congress of Settlement Nations, or CONSENT, controls the Earth Sphere. At this time, the world is plagued with global famine that is taken the notice of everyone. Mark Curran, an ex-consent soldier, is forced to become the pilot of the Gundam G-Savior and to protect the discovery of a new type of Bioluminescence that could solve the world hungar crisis found by the Gaian Cynthia Graves and Dr. Reva from a conspiracy to have selective famine around the world by the corrupt Consent. They head towards the colony of Gaia where there will be a clash between Consent forces, Gaian defence forces, and the rebel faction called the Illuminati.
The Mobile suits look as if they were made from the One Year War Era and the plot seems to be slow in development. The only advanced technology that this movie has are the Beam Shield element from the series V Gundam. It is an okay movie, but it is suggested that you should be at least familiar with the world of Gundam or you will be completely lost in this world of giant robots, space ships, human emotion and trials, and corrupt world governments.",1006905600,11,1136,4.628712871287129
1658537,1,B00005RZPY,"You gotta hand it to `em, they try.  But what do western filmmakers know about Japanese cartoons?  Judging from this movie, a low-budget live-action adaptation of the ""Mobile Suit Gundam"" franchise, not a whole lot.

Created to kick off ""Gundam's"" 20th anniversary, ""G-Saviour"" retains its title as the worst Gundam product ever produced.  The plot--which seems to be less about the war for a glowing enzyme that could end widespread famine, and more about said war being started by the hero's jealous girlfriend--makes the film feel like something out of the SCIFI Channel, or rather, the Lifetime Movie Network!

It's worth noting that members of the cast like Brennan Elliot (the hero) and Enuka Okuma (who lent her voice for the English dub of ""Gundam Wing"") hold their own while the CGI used to create the giant robots and space-age vehicles are decent.  But that's not enough to condone how half-baked the finished product turned out to be (the soldiers' uniforms were taken straight from ""Starship Troopers"").  And I'll spare the details of the inaccuracies so as not to sound like a bratty fanboy.  Just consider this a reason why anime and showbiz don't mix.  DVD features include a Japanese audio track (with no subtitles), an art gallery, credits, and trailers for the Gundam shows you should watch.

This film is recommended for ages 13 and up: Violence, Adult Language.",1217721600,,1382,4.969565217391304
1658538,3,B00005RZPY,"I was ,overall, disappointed by this film. The plot should have been more detailed. If you look at any of the episodes of the gundam series you will see that they all have intriguing, provacotive, and detailed plots. The plot on this movie was not up to par for a gundam movie. There were times when I was watching this movie when I couldn't tell whether it was about the war of the colonies or the main characters' love story with the scientist. Although, I will admit the gundam fight scene in the end was pretty good. But thats about all I can say. The acting was near terrible, the special effects were sub-par, and the whole thing was just too predictable. In conclusion, this is DEFINITELY NOT a buy, barely even a rent. I only paid $1.99 for it, I feel as though I got my moneys' worth. You can buy it if you want to see the fight scene at the end but I implore you to not pay more than 5 or 6 dollars for it. If you do, you will probably feel like you were cheated. In my humble opinion that is.",1167004800,,1003,4.122448979591836
1658539,2,B00005RZPY,"First off, I'm a HUGE Gundam fan. I'm collecting all the series, and I had to get this. (How could I pass up a live action Gundam movie?!)

The movie was well made, but it had a lot of sequences that reminded me of the more... cheesy moments of SeaQuest DSV.

Basically, I feel that the graphics and the story were a little half-assed. I mean, while you see 2 Mobile Suits for about 4 mins (MAX) near the beginning of the movie, and two other quick shots a bit later, you don't see any more until near the end! Isn't this a Gundam Movie? Shouldn't the Gundam, or other Mobile Suits be in this a lot more? I think that in the entire film, there's maybe 10-15 minutes of Mobile Suits, and this is a 2 hour movie!

The story... (SPOILERS INSIDE THIS PARAGRAPH!) Basically, it's Universal Century 223. Earth is on the edge of famine, and two scientists may be on the virge of a breakthrough that could solve this problem, once and for all. The Earth Alliance, (or certian factions within the Earth Alliance) decided that such a breakthrough is not needed, as without it, power will be given to those who can provide food. Now while this may sound like a nice concept, things get worse... One pilot, who was in the military a number of years back, is framed as a killer and is labeled a traitor when he helps free one of the scientists with the breakthrough, eventually getting her off of Earth, and to the colonies. Now the only way to stop the scientist from finishing the breakthrough is the declare war on the Colonies. (Although, like the rest of the film, this is done by making the Colony shoot at them first, making their ""war"" a retalitory act. -_-' )

The execution of the story is just plain predictable, and not very invocative.

The Gundam and Mobile Suits aren't that good either. The 3D looks like graphics that belong in The Last Starfighter, which had the first computer graphics meant to be real-life visuals. (It was released in 1986. This film is 2000. That 14 years!!) Basically, this film looks like it was made on a shoe-string budget, and has absolutly no visual resemblence to any of the Gundam series, aside from the design of the G-Savior, AKA The Gundam, and the basic design of the Earth Alliance uniforms. (Oh, the Earth Alliance soldier/marine outfits look like they were taken straight off the Starship Troopers set...)

Now while I may have just really badmouthed this film, it's not without it's good points. The 15-minute battle at the end of the film is rather good, even if the graphics aren't up to par. The execution of the non-MS sections were well done, and the concept for the whole thing had a lot of potential.

In many ways, I feel that this had the chance to be something wonderful, and it ended up being a home-made cheesy film.

Honestly, I think this could of been done better, even for the time. But at the same time, I think it's kinda cool to see something like this done.

Overall rating: 2&1/2 out of 5 stars.",1126915200,,2958,4.462962962962963
1658540,1,B00005RZPY,"This movie is ok by American sci-fi standards if not associated with the Gundam franchise...but as a 20th aniversary celebration it falls well short of Sunrise's usual standards. The plot is incredibly simplistic and the cliche characters are all far too happy and care-free for being on the verge of war.

The ""war"" is quite small as we see maybe a total of about 80 mobile suits(including the reinforcements from the incredibly cliche ""illuminati"" force of quasi-gundams that arrive without any fleet transport/escort at the end) and only two ships built for battle, one of which is a mobile suit transport with no apparent weapons of its own.

The G-Savior is quite a joke as far as Gundams go as well. In EVERY Gundam series the main Gundam is an advanced suit that is better than the mass-produced models. From what we can see, the G-Savior is actually INFERIOR to the RX-78 original Gundam in everything other than appearance.

To tell the truth, I feel really sorry for those that worked on the project and the shame they must feel for their failure. It really would not be difficult to create a story that would fit in Gundam's impressive storyline and to have memorable characters, but apparently it was beyond them.",1109203200,4,1225,4.796208530805687
1658541,3,B00005RZPY,"Now I want every one here to note I have seen at least one episode of every gundam series ever, in fact I have seen at least 70-80% of all gundam in my time, now this movie is an interesting concept: Live Action movie taking place in the Gundam universe, even though they never say the word ""Gundam"" at all you can see words like ""Mobile Suit"" pop up in places.
The movie lacks every thing that makes a good gundam, I can easily get past the fact it is not the best looking film I have ever seen, but the characters lack chemistry, the other UC gundam characters were so great was because they all had a chemistry and all reacted to each other in a diffrent way, and you could easily understand their situations. The characters in here do not seem nearly as tragic as in ""Mobile Suit Gundam"" or the kill-a-minute ""Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam"" in fact I would go as far and saying I did not like, understand, and I can not even remember the names of most charcters, unliek the epic motion picture ""Mobile Suit Gundam Char's counter Attack"" the characters in ""G-Saviour"" are rather plain and uneventfull, the action ( I know how much you probably love action) is very low, in fact, the show lacks the ""full scaleness"" of ""Mobile Suit gundam SEED"" of which it would look like every one was involved and the war was really brutal, ""Savior"" on the other hand made it seem like a walk in the park. In fact, this movie was actually kicked off the UC calender, because it had WAY to many continuity problems, over all I suguest looking into it if you are curious, how ever the film falls VERY short of being what the other UC shows were.",1080864000,2,1625,4.331147540983607

Let's see what else the plot for starters.  Wow if this wasn't the stupidest thing in the world I don't know what is.  Heck monkeys with typewriters could come up with a better plot than this.  Acting: horrible.  My six year old sister could act better than these clowns.  All 30 seconds of CG was kind of cool, maybe if you where on acid.

1658544,1,B00005RZPY,"This movie is quite a dissapointment compared to the Gundam series it is supposed to be derived from. It is a typical sci-fi action movie, it draws on images and ideas from Gundam Series but does not build upon anything from or add to the gundam series.
As a ""stand alone"" movie it is average- watch it if you have nothing else better to do but not something I would set aside time to watch. Acting was ""stiff"", chracters were shallow- plot was marginally acceptable and has some ""logic"" errors. Does not come any where near the rich character and background of the gundam series.",1045612800,2,580,4.533333333333333

the other is that the story is easy to follow (to me it is)but you must pay attention to the movie when you watch it. I would recommand this movie more for the star wars fans then the gundam fans or the babylon 5 fans.",1039478400,2,465,3.8541666666666665
1658546,1,B00005RZPY,"I am a die hard Gundam fan.  Everything from the 0079 series to Turn A and even Wing.  Gundam has a very big cult following and for us fans it is an animated world full of action, drama, mystery and suspense.  It is sad to see how G-Saviour bastardized the Gundam universe.  The only thing worth watching is the 5 minutes of CG which isn't really all that great.  The plot is REALLY bad, the acting is horrible, the characters are VERY plain and one dimensional.  If you are a Gundam fan please don't purchase this lame excuse for a movie...if you do they'll only start making more garbage like this.  Unfortunately this was an impulse buy and I am stuck with it (the people I have offered to give it away to don't want it).  Spend your money elsewhere...perhaps start exploring other Anime/Mecha titles such as Getter Robo or Big O.  If not go ahead and burn your money...it's probably more enjoyable to watch than this movie.",1032048000,15,927,4.470238095238095
1658547,5,B00005RZPY,"Although this movie was made in the USA and the Gundam anime series it is based was made in Japan, G-Savior is a great movie. It was made to honor the series' 20th anniversery. Everything futuristic in this movie is CGI(Computer Generated Image), but other than that it's live action.
The live action part makes it seem more realistic and the fact that the main charactor has background with several other charactors, some friend and some enemy, the fact that he's not sure he's doing the right thing and some real world concerns makes the storyline seem that much more realistic. Basicly it's Gundam that is set a little more in the real world.
Don't expect alot of fast paste battles in this movie.",1031443200,,700,4.653225806451613
1658548,2,B00005RZPY,"Lets get right to it:
The Good:
1) Nice mecha designs and the CG looked good.
2) Good (but too brief) battle scene towards the end.
The Bad:
1) Wooden characters.  Ironic that the the first 3D version of Gundam would have such 1D characters.  Besides the Mecha, Gundam has always had great characters and this movie had none.
2) Slow pacing.  It takes way to long to get to the big Mecha battle at the end and then its over much too quickly.
The Ugly:
1) This should have been a Japanese production.  In Western hands it just came out unimaginative and boring.  It happened with Godzilla (which luckily is back in Japanese hands) and its happened here with Gundam.",1027296000,9,664,4.454545454545454
1658549,3,B00005RZPY,"Definitely a movie for children who love Power Rangers, but a disappointment to Hardcore Gundam fans who had anticipated a live action addition to the Gundam saga. The casting for this movie was OK, however, the plot was virtually non-existant, and the writers need to be lined up in front of the Gundam Heavy Arms & let Trowa have a go at them. I actually would have given this movie 2.5 stars if I it was possible. The one highlight of the movie was in fact the CGI scenes, but even the quality of those varied throughout the movie. I recommend this movie for the library of any Gundam fan if only to insure the completeness of your collection, and for all those in love with those sappy Power Rangers.",1020124800,2,704,4.423076923076923
1658550,4,B00005RZPY,"For many Gundam fans, this may appear to be a horrid excuse for an anime-to-live-action film, but you may not realize just how great this movie is. Here are a couple of reasons why:
1. Even though it's a special 20th Birthday film, the film isn't mearly used as an excuse to make a film exploiting a franchise, like Street Fighter Alpha.
2. The whole movie isn't centered around mobile suits, making the film acceptable for non-gundam fans and new ones.
3. There is actually story instead of just some movie that tries to combine all the terms of Gundam into one movie.
4. There are actually some NEW mobile suits in this as well as new forces and governments so regular fans won't be bored.
Now let's talk about the film. It starts off with a Star Trek-esque opening and then starts explaining the basis of G-Saviour. We are introduced to the many new people:
Mark Curran: Underwater worker who pilots mobile suit for CONSENT for underwater farming.
Cynthia Graves: One of the scientists from Gaia who plans to end world hunger.
Fileet: An old friend of Mark who is a member of the Illuminati.
There are more names, but I can't remember them all. Now, as for the governments, there is no more Zeon or Earth Federation. Instead, there is the CONSENT, which can be considered the Earth government. Other than Gaia, there isn't really any other government.
I won't lie to you. G-Saviour has little mobile suit action. There are only two battle scenes with G-Saviour if you count the scene where it is destroying debris in space. However, the climax battle that takes place outside of Gaia is an incrediblely beautifully done battle sequence that will make any fans of Star Wars blush. For instance, a long scenes where the camera zooms in on Gaia until it captures the battle between G-Saviour and an enemy mobile suit. The battles alone are enough reason to buy G-Saviour.
The DVD extras are minimal. There an odd little art gallery and some trailers for other Gundam series. The included Japanese language is okay, but with no subtitles, you won't know what they're saying. Overall, G-Saviour is one fun sci-fi movie anyone will enjoy.",1017964800,,2135,4.711229946524064
1658551,4,B00005RZPY,"There are certain themes that run in the classic Gundam series.  Corrupt politics, corrupt military, the latest advance in Mobile Suit technology, betrayal by the one you most trusted, etc, tec...
And of course, the pilot that didn't WANT to be a pilot.  But HAD to be.
In this, G-Saviour comes full circle.  It's about 130 years AFTER the original series.  Politics and the like are all so different, and still somewhat the same.
And a crisis is arising.  The reason is pretty contrived-- but hey, face it-- the original wasn't?  No, in a way, this makes MORE sense.
But what impressed ME was that the actors did this movies and DIDN'T seem lame.
No... they seemed ANIME.
For the FIRST TIME EVER we have live action actors acting like ANIME characters.  INCLUDING the sometimes over the top stuff we are used to expecting from anime characters.  And, in my opinion, for once it worked.
Ever seen the live action Fist of the North Star?  BAD movie.  (Although, sadly, it was better than the ANIMATED FOTS movie.)
But G-S WORKS.
Because EVERYONE in the flick is NOT trying for an Academy award.  They are being typical Anime characters.  They are pulling the SAME bonehead plays that we have all come to know and love.  And for once, it WORKS.
It doesn't hurt that the computer generated mobile suits are downright real.  I can BELIVE in these suits.  It's scary.
90 minutes of mind-candy... not any different from an OAV... just with real people.

The best part, of course, is the big battle between the colony Gaia and the Earth forces.  All suits are done exceptionally well in CGI, and even show off some suits I don't think are in any of the anime.
  Save for the colonies (Sides) and the design of the mobile suits (the word ""Gundam"" is never said in the course of the movie), the story, while good, has nothing to do with either the Mobile Suit Gundam series or the Gundam Wing series.

7953074,3,B00005RZPY,"G Saviour was meant to be an iconic first in the Gundam universe: A live-action feature film to mark the franchise's 20th anniversary. Set at the (current) end of the Universal Century chronology, it concerns a food-driven cold war between colonial super-nations. Predictably everything devolves to all-out war and it's up to a lone hero to pilot his experimental giant samurai robot and end the fighting. So far so good.

Where the movie goes off the rails a bit is that nobody told the producers that giant robot movies are expensive. An amount of money that I'm going to guess was comparable to the amount spent on one season of 0083 or so was thrown at creating a fully live-action and CG Gundam universe, buster rifles, beam sabres, and all. The effects ate up most of the petty cash so most of the actors are TV and B film performers, but that's okay. They put on a spirited attempt at being serious, and let's face it, characters in Gundam shows are always kind of weird. Just look at Zeta.

The look and feel is what really sinks the movie below the 3 or 4 star mark. The CG starts off good (we first see the mobile suits under water and in the murky depths of the ocean they're pretty convincing) but the more we see of the CG and the more of it there is in one shot the worse it looks- the climactic battle between good and evil on a battered space station looks like a pretty middling PS2 game. Similarly, the sets are the same mix of modern public buildings and disused factories that populate every low budget sci-fi film. The gritty industrial look works in some places, but the overall effect is that we're watching a Gundam movie set in THIS century, not hundreds of years in the future. Some things work right- the mobile suits have a very natural weighty look to their movements as compared to the man-in-a-suit quickness of the TV shows, and the cockpits, while low rent, are full of blinking lights, levers, and little monitors just like they should be. It's not always convincing that the actor in the cockpit is doing the same things as his robot in the effects shots, though.

In the end there is an epic robot battle, the day is saved, and everyone learns an important lesson about the futility of war. Considering the people of the universe learn this at the end of EVERY Gundam installment, people must have short memories, but in spite of the rocky road to the climax, this DOES feel pretty Gundam-ey. Which is odd because the word Gundam is never spoken in the film. Wing fans who were hoping the terrified military mook screaming ""It's a GUNDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM"" would finally be brought to life will need to look elsewhere.

PROS:
-It's better than Gunhed, Crash and Burn, and Robot Wars, which are basically its only competition.
-For the pittance of money they had, the team cranked out an outstanding TV movie (so it's a shame that it was meant to be a big deal over in Japan).
-Pure collector value for the hardcore Gundam fan. You may have all the Chibi Maquettes, but without this you're a nobody.
-In a franchise rife with side-stories and alternate universe arcs, it's nice to visit the UC one more time.
-Little things like the animation and some of the settings speak to how diligently the filmmakers tried to realize their vision, even if they didn't quite make it.

CONS:
-Oh man, I forgot about Robot Jox. It's not as good as Robot Jox. SHOOT THE GREEN LASER, ACHILLES!
-For the price of collecting this (unless you get lucky) you could more or less own any 1 Gundam series on DVD.
-Laughable CG and unprepared performances from many actors will turn off anyone who isn't hardcore into Gundam or B Sci-Fi.
-The CG sort of breaks the suspension of disbelief. By sucking.
-Lacks the distinct soundtracks that all proper sci-fi war animes seem to have. You know what I mean. Like in Ace Combat and stuff.

COMMENTS:
-Weeaboos like to complain how not everyone in this movie is Japanese. They seem to be overlooking that about 30 percent of characters in Gundam aren't. WHAT, DON'T YOU PEOPLE LOVE QUATRE AND TROWA? Monsters.
-It's pretty costly to buy this new. I found it used for a fifth its new asking price, so buying it, watching it, and if you want, flipping it is a viable option.
-This movie is a Japan/Canada co-production. It's a bit of a train wreck, but don't hate on the teamup; Japan and Canada gave us Johnny Mnemonic which is outstanding.
-Predictably this movie bombed domestically and abroad, in part because of poor name-brand recognition and release, and in part because it's sort of bad. Its failure to blow fans minds may be WHY more side stories were produced afterward. But if that's what it took to get us Turn A Gundam, I'm totally okay with that.",1342483200,,4714,4.579383886255924

Created as part of Gundam's 20th anniversary Big Bang event, this live action movie was a co Canadian & Japanese production using all english speaking actors and intended to be a chapter of the Gundam saga in the far distant future of the U.C. series, year 0223 to be exact.

What gundam fans ended up getting was a pretty garbage film with CG, action, cinematography that's on par with the schlocky sci-fi films currently airing on SyFy channel.  For the Gundam completist, I do recommend you watch this movie just to understand how hilariously bad it is.

Gundam is about mobile suit action and all the MS in this film are CG and look like primitive pieces of junk on par with the designs of the original 1979 series.  The title suit, G Saviour itself while a half decent design, you certainly can't tell in the film since the CG rendition is so awful.  Plus action and script are subpar.  I'm glad I saw this as a rental only and didn't spend real money buying this film.

AVOID.",1305936000,,1087,4.454545454545454
7953076,2,B00005RZPY,"I would like to point those reading this review back up to the top of the page and ask them to look at the title of this product. Notice how, nowhere on it, you will find the word ""Gundam"" in it? (If you read the part above the title, well, you were doing it wrong~) That's because, quite simply, this is not Gundam. I rented this movie from a video store, and I'm grateful I did, because purchasing it would have been such a waste of money. I managed to make it through about 40 minutes of so-called acting before I had to stop. A cheesy plot, bad characters and acting, horrid mechanical designs and no real sign of what makes Gundam, well, Gundam.

There's a reason most, if not all, Gundam fans have disowned this movie from the Gundam timelines, universes, and the series. It's straight up BAD. Unless you're looking for a good ""I dare you!"" movie, save yourself the time and money, and just walk away.",1266624000,,907,4.366863905325443
7953077,3,B00005RZPY,"With my goal to watch everything related to Mobile Suit Gundam and the Universal Century on DVD for 2008, I realized that there was a film released in 2000 (DVD released in 2002) to celebrate the Gundam 20th Anniversary.

In a collaboration with Sunrise, Inc. and Polestar Television, ""G-SAVIOUR THE MOVIE"" was released.

With a budget of nearly $9 million, the film would combine live action with CGI with the majority of the film in live action.

The film would take place in the Universal Century 223, way past the storyline of the anime series and there is no mention of Gundam in this film.

If anything, this film could be seen as one of those films you would catch on the Sci-Fi channel and realize that it has mecha and kick back and enjoy it.

I know this film is not accepted by Gundam fans, not accepted by Gundam co-creator Tomino Yoshiyuki but being the sci-fi fan that I am, I wanted to give this film the benefit of the doubt.

The film revolves around CONSENT (Congress of Settlement Nations) officer Mark Curran and one night, his ship was infiltrated by some unknown group who are looking for some type of lab samples. A gun fight ensues and CONSENT military led by Lt. Colonel Jack Halle (Curran's rival) ends up killing some of the people of this group.

Mark Curran then does his investigation and through interrogation, realizes that this group were actually scientists who were after something in the lab that would lead to the benefit of mankind.

Of course, Curran, being the optimist agrees to help the scientist, Cynthia Graves which automatically puts him in odds against CONSENT and ends up helping the group of scientists and puts him on the wanted list of CONSENT and becomes a cat and mouse film with the military trying to capture Curran and the rebel scientists.

As for how it relates to anything Gundam. Aside from the date which is ""Universal Century 229', there is a mobile suit that the opposition to CONSENT has in its disposal called ""G-Saviour"". Also, the mention of colonies such as ""Side-x"" were used in the film but no mention of Gundam at all.

I suppose back in 2000, the CGI for the mechas were top notch but the majority of the film doesn't feature too much CGI and I guess that would be a positive thing now because of CGI advances since then.

As for the voice acting, compared to the first season of Star Trek: The Next Generation or Star Trek: Deep Space Nine to the first season of the modern ""Battlestar Galactica"" and even Sci-Fi channel films, ""G-Saviour"" is not a horribly acted film.

Actually, Brennan Elliott does a good job playing CONSENT officer Mark Curran and rival/enemy Lt. Col. Jack Halle plays a good bad guy. The others in the film were not bad as well. I've watched a lot of sci-fi films and by no means is this film terribly acted or the worse one ever created.

The DVD also features a dubbed Japanese track and even though you have talent like Shinohara Ryoko playing the voice of Graves, as much as I enjoy watching Japanese anime with English subtitles, I didn't want to watch an English film dubbed in Japanese with English subtitles.

So, with that being said, I was not disappointed with this film at all. Was it wonderful? No. But it wasn't terrible either.

I had some problems with the pacing of the film. How Curran and Graves start to fall for each other... it just seemed a bit rushed. Also, when I see someone being shot multiple times, I would expect that person to not live through that. But who knows, maybe weapons were set at stun or something.

Another was how Curran became the main pilot of the G-Saviour. A former military officer/friend of Curran says of the G-Saviour, ""this was built for you"". It was one of those ""rolling my eyes"" moments in the film and next thing you know, Curran becomes a pro in piloting the G-Saviour and ready to take on colliding objects, space junk, etc. with no practical experience with G-Saviour. Sure, he's piloted many mobile suites and aircraft but for him to master G-Saviour so quickly... that's a big stretch.

The CGI didn't bug me all that much, since its a bit dated and the battle between G-Saviour and other mobile suits were cool to watch. Facial expressions/emotions after a battle were sometimes cheesy but all in all, the balance between CGI and real life actors worked well.

Personally, with the storyline taking place nearly 250 years later after the original ""Mobile Suit Gundam"" series, personally I didn't think too much after I watched it of how it affects the Gundam universe. If anything, I was more concerned about the Earth Federation collapsing and the emergence of CONSENT. But it would be interesting if Sunrise would create another anime series that did take place in this timeline.

As for special features, there was like CGI and artwork from and for the film. Even the special feature was a let down because there were less than ten images.

It would have been nice to watch a featurette with interviews with the cast or even behind-the-scenes filming. After all, this is the celebration of Gundam's 20th Anniversary at that time. So, you would have expected to see something in relation to that. Maybe even the Japanese premiere.

A lot of people made their judgment to not see this film and some who have seen it enjoyed it or disliked it.

For me, I found it as essential to have in my collection because I'm watching and owning everything ""Universal Century"" related in the Gundam universe.

I didn't dislike the film, I enjoyed it and for me, it was like catching a sci-fi movie special and that was it.

As for the DVD is concerned, for a 20th Anniversary Project celebrating Gundam, you would have expected more on this DVD and that is where this DVD fails in that there are hardly anything in regards to Gundam or even this film in terms of featurettes, interviews or anything else except CG and hand drawn artwork. And surprisingly, there is not much there for that either.

Fortunately, you can find this DVD around $5 online.",1218153600,3,5997,4.629594721960415
