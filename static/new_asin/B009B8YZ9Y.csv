5312982,5,B009B8YZ9Y,"Mike Birbiglia loves pizza. And jokes. And jokes about pizza. And now, you can view his new film, ""Sleepwalk With Me"" in the comfort of your own home, while eating your very own pizza.

Birbiglia, a comedian with seven hilarious albums under his wing, wrote, directed and stars in this semi-autobiographical, coming-of-comedian's tale about breaking into stand-up, finding your voice and jumping through the second story of a La Quinta Inn window in the middle of the night to avoid a jackal.

""Sleepwalk With Me"" follows a young man with a dream to become a stand-up comedian in his first few, painful years of performing, as he is trying to find himself a midst a tumultuous first love, small audiences barely paying attention to his jokes and an increasingly concerning problem of acting out his dreams in his sleep.

Along with This American Life's Ira Glass, Birbiglia has created a uniquely shot, cleverly narrated, independent film with a stellar back-up cast, including Six Feet Under's Lauren Ambrose as Abby, Birbiglia's full-hearted, relatable love interest. With music by indie-rock favorite Mates of State, this film entices not only a young audience, but an audience full of people who can relate to what it feels like to be young, in love and completely, irrationally delusional.

Walk with Mike Birbiglia through his dreams, and wake up Christmas morning with a DVD of your journey you can watch again and again.",1352851200,,1428,5.012658227848101
5312983,4,B009B8YZ9Y,"I've seen Mike Birbiglia in a few stand up broadcasts, but really knew nothing about him, except that I liked his laconic, stutter-step approach to delivering his material.  He seemed like a funny guy who also happened to be sorta nice too.  I knew nothing about his book, Ira Glass appearances or one-man off-Broadway show.  That's probably a good thing, because I was able to enjoy SLEEPWALK WITH ME pretty much on its own terms.

Apparently this movie is quite autobiographical, even though Mike has changed his character's name to Matt.  But Mike/Matt frequently talks directly to the camera, and we're assured the story is true...so it's almost impossible not to assume that we're basically seeing a (perhaps exaggerated) take on Birbiglia's life.  But it doesn't really matter either...the story is compelling and says some interesting things about relationships and about how a stand-up comic builds their career literally from the ground up.

Matt is in an 8-year relationship with Abby (Lauren Ambrose, who is wonderful).  Abby is a great girl, and everyone (both viewer and the characters on screen) have to wonder why Matt is having a hard time settling down and committing to a marriage with her.  But as Matt says, he's unhappy that everyone says the best thing about him is his girlfriend.  It's true.  He's a bartender who wants to do stand-up.  Or at least, he thinks he does...he gets almost no opportunities to try.  His life and his relationship is on hold.  Abby is faithful and patient, but also growing frustrated.  Surely she is wondering what more she can give of herself to this man who trembles at the thought of marrying her.

One day, with Abby's help, Matt actually gets an agent.  And the agent begins to give Matt tiny gigs.  Gigs that barely cover the cost of gas and food to get there.  But Matt wades in, ready to try out his meager material.  He's actually a pretty terrible comedian, but he's willing to do just about any lousy gig he can get.  He is excited at his new life on the road (there's a great scene when he checks into his first flea-bag motel and is clearly THRILLED).

Abby remains in NYC, but is supportive.  Matt continues to limp along until he gets the advice of a more successful peer to use his personal conflicts as fodder for his material.  Suddenly, his material connects with the audience, and his success grows.  He loves life on the road.  And thus, his distance from Abby grows.

Meanwhile, he also suffers from severe sleepwalking, where he gets out of bed and runs from the creatures that are chasing him in his dreams.  His dreams of running seem to coincide with this waking fear of commitment.  Of a ""normal"" life chasing him down.

Matt frequently behaves poorly, but Birbiglia is so specific in showing us details of his life, that we tend to sympathize with him, even as we wish he would pull himself together.  At one point, before showing us some really poor behavior, Matt turns to the camera and says ""before I show you this next part...remember, you're on my side.""  And he's right, we are.

We're also on Abby's side and that's what gives this movie such a rich, bittersweet quality.  We yearn for them to find happiness...yet we see how elusive that is going to be.  Birbiglia directs the film, and he shows an adept touch for little details and telling dialogue.  I'm not ready to say he's a great director, because so far, he's only used his own life as material...but I'd be prepared to see more of his work.

SLEEPWALK WITH ME is very funny at times.  It's very raw at times.  It can frequently be surprising (the details of his sleep disorder are fascinating).  It's a very adult film (the language is relatively mild though).  It is VERY well acted (including great support from James Rebhorn and Carol Kane as Matt's parents).  The dialogue is sharp, and few words are wasted.  Almost every line is significant.

It's not a perfect film.  Sometimes the pace drags...it felt longer than its 90 minutes.  It occasionally struggles to reconcile its varying tones. I like movies that shift tone, but I like to feel the director MEANT for the tone to shift...sometimes I think it does despite Birbiglia's efforts.  But these are fairly minor complaints and I'd give the film 4.5 stars.",1348617600,16,4264,4.707713125845737
5312984,4,B009B8YZ9Y,"My expectations were at rock bottom as I entered the theater for this USA entry to the 2012 Seattle International Film Festival. Of course anything better than that, was a pleasant relief.

I was afraid this was a one-man show about sleepwalking, but instead I discovered that it is a scripted movie that happens to feature a stand-up comic and uses elements from his life, and has other, more well-known actors and actresses in the cast.

We see:
  * Mike Birbiglia (""Your Sister's Sister"") is an ill-at-ease boyfriend who chafes at the idea of being a fianc&eacute;. He is a third-rate comic who aspires to the big time. The tough slog to success causes a major rift in his sleep and in his relationship.
  * Lauren Ambrose (""Wanderlust"") is an erstwhile girlfriend/fianc&eacute;e. If that's her real voice, she can sing! This character is so sweet, we'd like to see things go her way.
  * James Rebhorn (""Real Steel"") is our hero's father, who talks over the top of everyone and has a plan in place for everything!
  * Carol Kane (""The Bounty Hunter"") is accustomed to being talked over by her husband, but always adds, ""...and another thing...""

Plus oodles of other familiar faces, as our young couple sorts through the issues that surface after a seven-year relationship...with no wedding. Of course both rely on friends and relatives for free advice, which turns out to be worth exactly what they paid!

Amazon.com will notify me when this is available on DVD.",1348444800,,1467,4.800796812749004
5312985,4,B009B8YZ9Y,"""Sleepwalk With Me"" (2012 US release; 90 min.) brings the story of Matt (played by Mike Birbiglia) as he struggles with a sleep disorder and tries to salvage his long-time relationship with Abby (played by Lauren Ambrose). Abby wants to get married, badly. Matt, not so much. Abby is looking for any sign from Matt that he will propose, which he eventually does, after an emotional side trip that makes him feel guilty and ashamed. Parallel to all of this, we see Matt getting his start on the stand-up comedy circuit, and barely hnaging on. Then, one day, he makes a funny quip about his failing relationship with Abby, and wouldn't you know, the audience eats it up! I don't want to give more away, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first and foremost, even though he plays a character called ""Matt"", this story is based on Mike Birbiglia's own life experiences (in fact, before this became a movie, this was an unexpected off-Broadway hit play). Birbiglia not only stars but also co-wrote and co-directed the movie. Second, the movie makes the most of the shoestring budget on which this obviously was made, and I was pleasantly surprised how well it all flowed. Last but not least, the overall tione of the movie is very much bitter-sweet (to me at least). When I saw this in the theatre a few days ago (at the Landmark E Street Cinema in Washington, DC), there were a number of people who were laughing out loud in many parts of the movie. I never felt quite that way. Yes, there are funny moments in it, but when all is said and done, this movie documents a failing relationship and a serious disorder, so how truly laugh-out-loud funny is that?

Besides Bribiglia, who obviously carries the movie (and quite well at that), the support cast is nothing short of terrific, including the already mentioned Lauren Ambrose as his girlfriend, but equally if not even more so James Reborn and Carol Kane as his parents. They make the most of the limited screen time they have. This movie is MILES away from your standard Hollywood fare, but if you are in the mood for something quirky and slightly left of center, ""Sleepwalk WIth Me"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1346976000,7,2199,4.650385604113111
5312986,5,B009B8YZ9Y,"If the plot of Sleepwalk with Me gives you a sense of deja vu, that could be because you may have heard comic Mike Birbiglia's account of his sleepwalking experiences on public radio. Or perhaps you saw the one man show based on his life. Now Birbiglia- and Ira Glass, host of This American Life- have joined forces to help create and promote Sleepwalk with Me, loosely based on Birbiglia's life.

This low budget film could be a sleeper hit of the year. I hope it becomes more than a sleeper and receives major acclaim. It deserves the attention.

I recently saw this film (via a pay per view option before the film's official release date) and was totally captivated. I hadn't heard the radio essays by Birbiglia or seen the one man show or even caught any promos for this movie. But I was instantly hooked by the autobiographical tale of a comic afflicted by a sleepwalking problem so severe that he engages in some very wild and bizarre behavior.

To say this film is a ""must see"" is an understatement. While fictionalized, the movie is based, however loosely, on Birbiglia's real life and the problems caused by his sleepwalking. But that is only one aspect of his life. There is so much more: his efforts to succeed as a comic, his ambivalent feelings towards his girlfriend ( played wonderfully by Lauren Ambrose), and his complicated relationship with his parents.

Birbiglia plays himself in the film, although his name is changed to Matt and real life events are transformed enough that the film is labeled as a fictionalized version of Birbiglia's life. But even if some details aren't an exact match with Birbiglia's experiences, the film still seems absolutely believable and authentic. This is both passion and very real pathos here. There is also drama, danger, and pain.

I felt so drawn to Birbiglia and his alter ego Matt, especially  his struggle to build a career while trying to handle the stress of a serious sleep disorder. His sleepwalking episodes seemed far more extreme than usual...if there is such a thing as ""normal"" sleepwalking ( I am no expert on that topic).

Some of Matt's actions may strike you as morally questionable. At times, they certainly crossed my ethical boundaries. But I also felt drawn to Matt and both fascinated and horrified by what happened when he walked - or ran or jumped - in his sleep.",1346889600,3,2343,4.727941176470588

I was mainly interested in seeing this because my boyfriend has REM-behavior sleep disorder; a rare and dangerous disorder that causes people to act out their dreams. This comedy-drama is helpful in the information is provides about the disorder as a natural part of the plot, and it's also very funny. The principal actor is a struggling comedian trying to get a break. He drives hundreds of miles for gigs at college frats, you-name-it. Desperate for laughs and material, he drives and is sleep-deprived, and keeps putting off going to a sleep center. Meanwhile, his sleep disorder worsens, causing some interesting situations.

5313003,4,B009B8YZ9Y,"Its not often that I get to see a comedy movie that not only makes me laugh, but really connects with me on another level. I think it was comedian Duncan Trussell who first mentioned this movie on a podcast a while back, and I always meant to watch it, but never did until today. This is one of those films that I can recommend to anyone because it feels so real in a lot of ways, and is sure to be relatable to most people in at least one way. Do yourself a favor and go into this one without seeing any clips first, because while it is a comedy for the most part, it deals with the very real problem of telling the truth in a relationship, whether its for the best or not.

Matt Pandamiglio is a comedianwell, he wants to be a comedian. He doesnt have very many jokes, and what he does have earns him so much silence that you could hear a pin drop. Very obvious things like pointing out Cookie Monster may have an eating disorder don't exactly get a reaction these days. He works as a bartender at a place that has comedy some nights, and he admires the comedians who go up and get reactions from the crowd. Matt also has a bad sleepwalking problem that slowly escalates over time as his other problems in life grow more troublesome. To be honest, the best thing he has going for him is his girlfriend Abby. Shes got personality, has a good job, is gorgeous, and gets along with his family. The thing is, despite being with her for so many years, Matt hasn't even thought about marriage, and when she brings it up, he gets nervous and doesnt know how to put his feelings into words in a good way. Things start to look up when Matt starts to perform at small shows at colleges and other places out of town, and at the same time, this makes the relationship more unsteady.

The title is a little misleading, since Matt only sleepwalks a small number of times through the film, but its a very important part of the story. His father, Frank, is a doctor and wants him to get everything checked out, even giving him a book on sleep problems. When its revealed what exactly might cause Matts specific form of sleepwalking, things click in place. The guys in his 30s, isn't doing what he likes for a living, and has this wonderful girlfriend who, all things considered, he should marry. Just the thought of having a baby with Abby throws him off. Why? The answer is surprisingly obvious, and something not a lot of people will admit themselves.

For me, the laughs were a little on the light side. Most of the time, I was laughing at how Matts jokes were bombing, and other times, I was laughing at how absurd the situations he was getting in were. Thats not saying that they're bad, because if you look up sleepwalking stories, crazier things happen. This just isn't the kind of thing you see in movies very often I guess. There are appearances from other comedians like Marc Maron, and I don't feel like they were used enough. I didn't want them to get tons of time and take the movie off course, and yet Maron only gets a couple of lines, as do a few others. Its not a big deal though.

If you have an hour and a half, Sleepwalk With Me would be a great way to spend it. Its cute enough to be a movie for couples to watch, and its still serious enough to be a light drama. This is one I wouldnt mind watching again a couple of times.",1417392000,2,3331,4.249211356466877

He is a recurring guest on another public radio show, This American Life, which is produced by Ira Glass. So when I heard that the movie had been released, I wanted to go see it, but the closest theater showing it was in Atlanta, a 2 hour drive from my home. I was already familiar with a lot of the material but that didn't diminish my enjoyment of the film. The script seems to be largely autobiographical, even though his character (Matt Pandemiglia) and presumably most of the other characters' names have been changed. I found myself wondering if it had been emotionally painful for him to have to relive some of dramatic moments. All in all, I was very pleased with the movie, as I am sure any fan of Mike or TAL will be. I only wish it had been longer, but there are plenty of You Tube videos of Birbiglia's stand-up routines to watch to fill the void.",1413244800,2,944,4.279329608938547

5313011,3,B009B8YZ9Y,"Like many other reviewers, I think Mike Birbiglia is a phenomenal comedian and story teller.  Within that work he shares very personal and embarrassing stories that come out hilarious when he tells them.  So, like many other reviewers, I almost feel the need to apologize before being critical of his work.  Recently I saw Mike Birbiglia's Thank God for Jokes at the Fargo Theatre, which was the best comedy I have ever seen.  He had me in stitches, AND he made me feel better about my own embarrassing moments to boot.  After that great set, ""Sleepwalk With Me"" was, to borrow language from another reviewer, a bittersweet chaser.

First of all, the protagonist in the movie is named Matt Pandemiglio, which is awkward, because the film is clearly autobiographical.  Was Mike Birbiglia just not willing to own his story on the big screen?  Why the face, Mike?  It does not get any less awkward when ""Matt"" narrates in first-person between scenes.  The whole thing was awkward, largely because the title gave me the wrong expectations.  When I casually streamed ""Sleepwalk with Me"" to my living room, I was half expecting a sleepwalk documentary and half expecting something funny.  The movie met neither expectation, though it does contain elements of both sleepwalking and comedy.  Overall, I would have been less disappointed if the title had been better at cluing me in as to what I was about to see.  Perhaps, ""Mike Birbiglia's Grotesquely Unreasonable Courtship of Abby and How It Turned Him into a Great Standup Comedian,"" or ""This Is Not So Much a Funny Movie about Sleepwalking As It Is a Sad Movie about Mike Birbiglia, Who Is Someone Who Is Funny and also Sleepwalks.""

Every review I read on Amazon has totally nailed this movie.  Great for Birbiglia fans, but not great for documentary or stand up comedy fans.  You are not going to learn much about sleepwalking from this film, except that one should avoid excessive stimulation and overeating before going to bed.  And there is not a whole lot of laugh-out-loud comedy.  The comedy is all dark.  Do not get me wrong: Birbiglia has a lot of heart for sharing the story of Abby and how he became successful.

5313019,4,B009B8YZ9Y,"Comedian Mike Birbiglia's first movie is an autobiographical story of his life as a struggling stand-up comic and his relationship with his longtime girlfriend Abby (Lauren Ambrose).  Both issues are complicated by a sleep disorder that causes Matt to sleepwalk, sometimes with disastrous results.

When Matt (Birbiglia) attends his sister's (Cristin Milioti) wedding, all fingers begin to point at him and when he and Abby will get hitched.  After all, it's been 8 years.  Everybody likes Matt but they love Abby.  Matt bartends hoping to become a stand-up comic, but as more than one person tells him, ""you're not very good.""  And he's not, at least early on.  There's one telling scene in the picture, when asked why he's not sure about marriage and his response is that he's afraid that the best thing about him is Abby.  We get it.

As luck would have it, Matt gets a series of one night stands that force him to travel throughout the northeastern United States, alone in a crummy station wagon donated by his critical father (James Rebhorn).  He stumbles and fumbles along the way but eventually finds his rhythm and discovers a new line of jokes.  And they all feature him and his fading relationship with Abby.

Fortunately for both, they each discover that they weren't meant for each other, even as they were closing in on a wedding.  The movie is certainly more comedic than dramatic.  It works even if it is sometimes a bit awkward with Matt talking into the camera.  There are several funny scenes involving Matt's sleepwalking.  They are at their best when we get to see what Matt is actually dreaming about.

In ""Sleepwalk with Me,"" he takes a slice out of his own life, stage show, and chapters from book and applies it to celluloid. Birbiglia does a pretty good job adapting  his life to screen and it's clearly about the fall of his character. His onscreen girlfriend, played excellently by Lauren Ambrose, acts as a foil, but certainly is not the focal point of Birbiglia's story, so while some people may be turned off at how one dimensional her character is in this movie, keep in mind that Birbiglia does a lot of demonizing heavy lifting.",1363910400,,660,4.892857142857143

I can't believe how supportive the girlfriend is of him cuz he is such a loser! I honestly don't know why the movie got so many great reviews since the main character is such a lame-ass idiot. He is so indecisive and unsure of himself, and he has managed to keep such a great girl around. She even wants to marry him! The dream sequences during the sleep walks are pretty cool and creative, but they are the only thing I liked about the movie.

I own a copy of the CD and of the book that share the story with this film.  And I find it compelling, interesting, and fun to watch.  Anything with Lauren Ambrose is fun, and she shines as a normal, frustrated girlfriend opposite the awkward Mike Birbiglia.

This film focuses a bit more on the growth of Mike Birbiglia as a comedian (er, sorry, Matt Pandamiglio) compared to the book and standup specials (part of the necessity of the story is understanding the narrator's voice), but the cameos by other comedians you'd probably remember from somewhere (though possibly find it hard to know exactly where) should make you smile.

i found this movie because i first heard of the comic do the stand up version of the film on Ira Glass's THIS AMERICAN LIFE radio show on NPR. Glass liked the material so well that he ended up producing the film to make it happen.  I am so glad he did.

However, the movie is so much more than a story about a sleeping problem. It's the story of a man and a woman who have built a life together and a series of events cause them to reevaluate the life that they are sharing. His sleepwalking is just a funny part of a kind of serious story.

I laughed out loud at this movie, but only in parts. If you come to this movie expecting The Hangover or Anchorman, then you are going to be disappointed. It's not that type of comedy. It's a heart-breakingly familiar story line told via excellent writing and solid performances from the entire cast.

Pros: Funny movie, unique feeling, very personable.

Cons: Falls a little short on the emotional final note in my mind.

On the Side: If you want to find a slightly deeper feeling version of this story, look up the stand-up version of this.

I'm already of a fan of Ira Glass and This American Life - but the clever storytelling ribbon of the funny and thoughtful true story of Mike Birbiglia's trouble sleeping and growing through a relationship and into a career as a comedian were both heartbreaking and contemplative. Great character actors, great story. Worth your time.",1356393600,,370,4.983870967741935
5313263,5,B009B8YZ9Y,If you are a fan then you should definitely watch this!  It's funny and very touching.  You'll even see some of the material referenced in his routines through out the movie.,1356307200,,174,4.580645161290323
5313264,2,B009B8YZ9Y,"This is one of those concepts that has the potential to be funny if it embraces the right angles, but instead tries to toe the line between humor and heartbreak without success. It's about a naturally funny guy who dreams of being a stand-up comic, but just isn't any good on the stage. Eventually, in desperation, he starts griping about his stagnant love life during the act and his career picks up steam. Also, he's begun sleepwalking. There's really no connection between those two threads, so they tenuously coexist on lonely parallel paths while the narrator lays it out for us. Although it's loaded up with cameos from a fistful of familiar comedians, there's a surprising lack of laughs and the sappy, played-out relationship drama doesn't pick up any of that slack. Even the sleepwalking scenes aren't all that entertaining.",1356307200,2,833,4.957142857142857
5313265,3,B009B8YZ9Y,"Entertaining, has a good pace, definitely NOT boring, funny and fun.  I really liked the movie and find Mike Birbiglia a good comedian.  I have heard him on This American Life and really liked him there.",1356307200,,203,4.611111111111111
5313266,5,B009B8YZ9Y,"This was an entertaining, low-key comedy/drama. The style kept reminding me of Woody Allen movies, back when they were reliable good, but without so much sex-obsession and neurosis.

I found the main story about the relationship engaging and poignant. The side stories about comedy and sleepwalking just added that much more. The acting was all good.

I like Birbiglia's comedy. The best bit for me in this movie was when he reminds the audience that they are on his side. Loved that.

Note that this movie is primarily about relationships and coming-of-age. It's not a comedy in the sense of trying to give you a lot of laughs. Think Annie Hall or Lost in Translation, rather than Some Like it Hot or Raising Arizona.

I was actually pleasantly surprised with this movie. I've become a fan of Birbiglia recently - watched a few streaming comedy videos, heard an interview with him on NPR. But I really didn't expect much from this movie - a first-time film by a young comedian, what are the odds that it would actually be very good?

Birbiglia's character in this movie, and his comedy persona too, is kind of a mumbling loser. (And could a guy like that make a good movie?) But he is so unassuming and honest about himself that you end up liking him. So that was one of the things I liked about this movie, watching him ""find himself."" Transformation of character is one of the things that makes a story good. Birbiglia is obviously not a slacker in real life, to have directed and created this movie.

For people who care about content, there was one F-bomb that I remember, something that a few years ago would have gotten this movie an R. There are also a couple brief seduction scenes, with talk of breasts.

The review here titled ""Excellent film full of bittersweet comedy"" said it all in a nutshell. Good job, Mike Birbiglia.",1356048000,,1834,4.624615384615384
5313267,5,B009B8YZ9Y,"Have you seen ""Girls"" on HBO? Do you listen to ""This American Life""? The author/actor appears in them. Oh, yeah. This movie is thaaaat good. It's very funny, endearing, and interesting. Mike Birbiglia is a very talented standup comedian/actor, and a wonderful writer, who is very funny and very endearing but the interesting aspect of his work is even more compelling. My first exposure to this talented artist was from the shows I mentioned and this movie is similar to those works. These productions are sooo good, they almost seem like a whole new genre within the independant art movement. ""Sleepwalk with Me"" is a good example of these new, young film makers. You will love it.",1352851200,,682,4.837606837606837
5313268,5,B009B8YZ9Y,"I have been a fan of Mike Birbiglia and this story since it originally aired on the radio show ""This American Life"" so I knew the basics before hand. What I was not expecting was for the movie to be so well acted, so well directed and so well produced. My expectations were high walking into the theatre but the film itself managed to surpass them. The characters are well-rounded and (because they are based on actual people) feel very real. The script is truly original, incredibly funny and at times poignant and a little heart wrenching. The supporting actors are all phenomenal, as many other reviewers have pointed out. I could watch Carol Kane eat cereal and be amazed. I also have to admit I developed a huge crush on Mike Birbiglia while watching this film and now find him completely swoon worthy. I actually loved the film so much that I watched it twice, the second time at home on demand. Can't wait to own it as well.",1352851200,,931,4.482352941176471

Anti-climatic and reeking of manchild shtick, this guy seems really nice and really funny but maybe to people who know him in person. I wanted to like him and listen to his story but found myself annoyed.",1530576000,,307,4.310344827586207
8539291,2,B009B8YZ9Y,"This movie is a romance that is for men, which is okay, but it likely misses your target audience.  The lead character decides to not marry a wonderful woman and then decides to go to --- work?  We don't see more about the kind woman he rejects or how his rejection affects her.  We just see him doing more comedy after running from his fears of long term commitment, which seems so cowardly, and movies about cowardly behavior are really unfulfilling.  It was such a disappointment that the movie showed him embracing love instead of avoiding it.",1529193600,,547,4.608247422680412

8539295,1,B009B8YZ9Y,"I read the book, and really liked it---the story of his struggle with a sleep disorder, his successful MD father, a very dysfunctional relationship, and his attempts to make it in comedy, all treated with an engaging, sarcastic self-deprecating humor.  This movie is nothing like the book... they turned it into a very typical romantic comedy, trying very hard to be ""quirky"" but failing.  A mediocre date-flick at best.  If you want to see Mike Birbiglia being funny, watch ""What I Should Have Said Was Nothing"" or ""My Girlfriend's Boyfriend""--- you'll get some laughs while he makes jokes about himself (he's got the market covered for being a likeable loser), and talks about some of real-life problems.  (Girlfriend's Boyfriend is kind of like a very long piece that would be on Moth Radio).  I'd give both those films a 4.5 star rating.  Skip this one, unless you want a fake-quirky run-of-the-mill date flick.",1514332800,,915,4.947712418300654
