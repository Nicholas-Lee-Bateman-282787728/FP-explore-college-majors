2100661,5,B0002KPICS,"Its a movie made for a E head raver techno trance junkie. You will be entertained right until the ending credits. It is ment to be cheesy and make fun of the whole rave scene. I don't know if it was the music but there is really a lovable quality about the film. If the music doesent get you to love it you have plenty of cheesy dialouge and cheesy to the max scenes to keep you entertained. It doesent even come close to being as good as Groove but it does show a more realistic portrayal of the scene and people. All in all if your looking for a well made ""rave movie"" watch Groove, Human Traffic, Party Girl, or Go. But if you liked those how can you not like this?",1147824000,5,668,4.030075187969925
2100662,4,B0002KPICS,"Ok, ok, the movie was probably only worth three stars.  It's kind of monotonous.  If you ever considered yourself a raver, or even if you just like to dance to techno/electronica, it is kind of fun to watch for its realism.  However, the music gets a full five stars.  I really wish there was a soundtrack available.

Also, I'm a big fan of Shakespeare.  This is not his play.  I started off assuming that this was based on his play.  It's not.  After about fifteen minutes, it's painfully obvious that only some of the characters are loosely connected to the original, and allusions are made occasionally.  However, if you forget the title and the Shakespeare connection, it's not too awful a movie.",1147824000,3,700,4.663934426229508
2100663,3,B0002KPICS,Good music not so interesting movie if you liked groove or human traffic this won't be so good to you.. see it for yourself though,1138147200,2,130,4.24
2100664,1,B0002KPICS,"I must have been really desperate for mindless entertainment! I agree, there were some pretty good old songs though.",1136505600,,116,5.157894736842105
2100665,1,B0002KPICS,"Too bad they did not release a soundtrack CD because the music is the only redeeming thing about this movie. Imagine an unlikely cross between ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" and ""Redneck Zombies"". Assemble a cast too physically unappealing (and too sleazy) to get work in the porn industry even though their acting skills are on that level.

When both the director and the writer have their careers stalled for three years after a movie, it is a good indication that you will be viewing a truly staggering mess. Unfortunately the script kept only a bare outline of the Shakespeare play and replaced the rest with student film quality dialogue and plot elements. Most high school class project films are better than this-if only because they have a shorter running length.

This is slightly more dull and mind-numbing than spending two hours observing a bunch of drones and wiggers indulging themselves at an actual club. If you are determined to stay with it until the end, and are searching for a way to maintain you sanity, you can focus on trying to figure out where the $1.5 Million budget went since none of it made it onto the screen.

Obviously this movie is not for Shakespeare purists but neither is it for anyone with a few still active brain cells. The cinematography is high school MiniDV quality, the production design is accidental, and the editing supports the theory a lot of drugs made their way into the systems of the post-production staff. I am embarrassed to admit even watching it, oh the sacrifices I make for public service.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1127347200,14,1593,4.736462093862816
2100666,5,B0002KPICS,"This movie is killer.  Shakespeare on drugs?  Hell yeah. That guy who plays Xander sucks in a lot of movies, but he actually pulls this one off.",1120521600,3,144,4.296296296296297
2100667,3,B0002KPICS,"There is nothing new or witty about the movie but it is still mildly entertaining. The music however transformed my room into a dance party even though I was watching it alone. Too bad there is no soundtrack to go with the movie. If you want to watch something light and humorous without having to use much brain power, check it out. It was nothing special but I still enjoyed watching it.",1116892800,3,389,4.416666666666667
2100778,2,B0002KPICS,"All the Rave dvds I purchased were basically the same. They were very boring because the younger people in them talked all the way through. The directors interviewed many people, but this was the main focus during the movies. I did not expect this. I was very dissapointed in how they set the movies up. I kept fast forwarding hoping to see the music and people in action. I wanted to hear fusion techno variations and see the way people were dancing. I really like the Crystal Method etc. The dvds hardly covered what you hear on cd baby, live 365 and the excellent stations on Pandora.
The editing was poor. You do not hear the kind of fusion techno that you hear on CD Baby etc. The directors kept skipping through scenes. The dvds did not really show the people interacting with fusion music.
I have never been to a Rave, which is the major problem. People must go to a Rave. If they cannot, then create their own techno stations like on Pandora. Pandora is not like going to a Rave, but it is better than purchasing poorly edited dvds. People out there should go to the Rave meetups if they can.
In summary, the dvds could have been much better, but then again it is impossible to create a situation where the audience feels like they are at a Rave by watching an interview dvd, just like sex vs. real dolls or people who have kids and people who do not.",1293321600,,1359,4.354330708661418
2100779,5,B0002KPICS,"the movies is the s@#$ its awsome if u like this movie u will love groove
its how all raves should be at the end thanks PLUR peace for life",1276992000,,139,3.6666666666666665
2100780,3,B0002KPICS,i got this because i had remembered seeing it a few years ago. it wasn't as good as i remembered though. it is kind of slow and not too exciting. i would only recommend it for young teenagers or people who like to do drugs. it has some famous actors in it but it really isn't a very good movie.,1274227200,2,294,3.9166666666666665
2100781,3,B0002KPICS,"I'll be honest, I bought this movie only because I read that Charlie Spradling is in it. She's gorgeous. Unfortunately, she is only seen for a few seconds in the deep background. For Charlie Spradling fans a complete disappointment. As for the movie, it's probably OK if you like the teen rave scene, otherwise...",1230249600,,313,4.814814814814815
2100782,5,B0002KPICS,"This movie is about to be true to yourself and honest about your feelings; is about being in love and discovering more about it...
People who love Andrew Keegan will enjoy this movie.
It is a successful achievement by the young and charming cast.
Cheers!",1206316800,,254,4.666666666666667
2100783,4,B0002KPICS,"It's a decent movie for what it is... a glimpse of a typical rave with no preachy overtones, or too much of a plot to get in the way.  Just be in the right state of mind and it is a good watch.

Production, writing, and acting well done to simulate the rave atmosphere where the music takes over and the social rules don't apply anymore.  Such as conversation scene on dance floor with Damon, Elena, Mia, and Xander trying to communicate (and not doing so). And the fast talking girl rolling and falling in love is almost as real as it gets, along with the self realization when Nick is sketching out after getting double dosed (and makes the perfect reference to the shakespeare classic).

Best indside joke - Xander: ""It gets good milage"", on why he drives a miata",1189728000,,766,4.411347517730497
2100784,1,B0002KPICS,"I bought a series of movies that have something to do with nightclubbing and raving and expected to find one of the better kind when I bought this movie ... but It was a weak copy of a much better movie I saw which is 'Groove!' ... Not good, I'm sorry.",1188432000,,252,3.9607843137254903
2100785,2,B0002KPICS,"Well, where to begin... I wasn't a fan of any of the actors too much, but I've got to admit I like the idea of Midsummer set at a rave and ecstacy is what Puck is peddling. I needed this movie to compare with the Stanley Tucci version for a class project and I would HIGHLY reccomend the Stanley Tucci version. Its not updated, but sometimes you gotta ask yourself why update Shakespeare? Im not saying im utterly against it, but is it necessary in each case?",1178928000,,459,4.287356321839081
2100786,3,B0002KPICS,"The only real problem I had with this movie was the sound quality.  The actors and acting was great.  The screenplay was an interesting new twist on an old classic.  Midsummer Night's Dream is one of my favorite Shakespeare comedies.  The music at the rave was spotty at best.  Granted this was an indie film so music was the last on the budget and the first thing cut, they did a great job.  The extra features are boring but the film is great.",1155168000,3,445,4.301204819277109
2100787,4,B0002KPICS,"I thought this movie was great!! I am a huge fan of groove and human traffic.  this movies dulls in comparison...but I do have to say i was engrossed the entire time!! I absolutely love the music, who do i ask about releasing a soundtrack?  the music just plane rocks and the storyline is good as well...however...did those peeps in the beginning ever make it to amsterdamn?????? n e wayz...i def reccommend!!!! 4 starts def!!!",1153612800,2,427,4.68

8028550,1,B0002KPICS,"I bought this DVD because I recently found out a friend of mine was in the cast of Rooftops and I wanted to check it out, however, these are probably two of the worst movies I have ever seen.  They were painful to watch.",1415404800,2,220,4.0
8028551,3,B0002KPICS,"I remember this movie when I was a kid seeing it in theaters.  Had a big crush on Jason Gedrick afterwards.  So I decided to purchase this for Rooftops.  OMG now that I watch it... Its still not that grand and Jason is still cute in it... but what floored me was how far NYC has come.  It's truly a flash back into time to when NYC wasn't that pretty.  I remember the spread of drug infestation and abandoned buildings.  It's just a era long gone and it was cool to see what once was again.  If anything just purchase it to see what NY truly looked like before the clean up.  For $4.99 think of it as an educational guide of old NYC.  Now I need to find an old movie with Time Square... times sure have changed, no more porn shops.",1366416000,,731,4.055944055944056

8028553,2,B0002KPICS,"Two truly average movies all in one glorious 2-sided disc, what more could you want?  Rooftops answers the age-old question of what could be better than combat?  Capoeira, of course!  Meanwhile, on side A, some of Hollywood's brightest young stars (and by this I mean absolutely the opposite) gather to put their own unique spin on Shakespeare's classic.  By ""unique"" I mean pointless and unnecessary, this movie sucks, and so does Rooftops.",1338768000,,441,5.083333333333333
