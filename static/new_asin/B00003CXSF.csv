The movie gracefully showed many aspects of the modern computer industry, while taking its(the industry's) viciousness to another level.  Maybe you have to embrace the future to enjoy this movie.  Or maybe you just need an open mind, but i saw this movie 3 times in theaters and every time on the way out, the people around proclaimed the greatness of the cast and the overall entertainment factor of the movie in general.",989539200,3,489,4.7976190476190474

And don't expect 5 star for these movies because these are computer related thriller movies.

1303800,1,B00003CXSF,"One of the worst movies ever to hit the screen.  The charecters are completely and utterly ridicolous, and the script should have been burned.  The actors fared off ok but its still utterly unbelieveable. Of all the Tech based movies out there, this is just utterly bad.  A clasic example of Bill Gates but who wants to watch that.  If I want to see a Bill Gates strugle I would rather go with the clasic between Gates and Jobbs.  This movie is not worth the rent or buy.  Unless you know nothing about technology and the workings of its industry, you should stay far far away from this one.",988848000,5,591,4.376146788990826
1303801,4,B00003CXSF,"Ryan Phillippe acquits himself credibly as genius geek who gets his big break working for a Bill Gates wannabe, played by Tim Robbins. The biggest problem, going in, is open source versus commercialism. As the flick begins, Milo's (Phillippe's character) biggest dillemma is sorting out open-source Anarchism from Capitalist wage-slave (albeit elite) seduction.
While Milo makes the ""wrong"" choice, it propels him into the storyline of this movie. Slowly we see that Robbins would put a James Bond villain to shame. Eventually, Milo figures that out, too. Don't worry about being too slow to pick up what's going on, the major plot is spelled out so that even the most clueless jock can keep track.
Some interesting cinematic devices are used (notice the digital art during a climactic sequence) and the actors compel us to take part in the story. Plenty of clues forshadow important plot elements, so viewers may feel smarter than they really are as they predict what will happen next. For the real propellor heads, actual HTML & BASH codes are used. Massive Attack's ""Angel"" fits perfectly into a key dramatic moment.
How much longer can Tim Robbins go on playing charismatic psychopaths without getting typecast?
Four stars for plot, four stars for revealing the plot, four stars for acting. Overall, a great Friday night entertainment flick. Won't win any awards, but who cares? It's fun.",987552000,30,1392,5.08296943231441
1303802,4,B00003CXSF,"The most important thing to remember is why this screenplay was brought to fruition in the movie theatre.  The relevancy should be apparent. Often we have life imitating art. In this case the art is definitely  imitating life in many ways.
Careful observation of the phenomenon known as Open Source ([...]) will reveal  the real life David vs. Goliath conflict which Hollywood so dearly loves. It's not difficult to figure out which  former technology CEO that Tim Robbins is parodying. Investigation into current press releases reveals that  this type of anti-competitive behavior still exists in our current day market place.
You'll enjoy the movie if you like technology-oriented story lines or are a Linux geek. While there are story-line  fractures overall it is a fun watch. Keep in mind the overall theme is a paranoia that the media, the government  and everything else can be bought off or controlled by certain Mega Companies.

1303803,1,B00003CXSF,"Howett wrote/directed arthouse film 'sliding doors.  THIS one is inept.
* Robbins schtick seems a parody of amoral characters he's played before if not for the fact this follows his politics. Noshing potato chips in blatant product placement w/ a maniacal smile & lifting one eyebrow seems extent to which he's 'created' a character. Too bad it's Dana Carvey's SNL character The Church Lady. Hey, where's the Superiority Dance? Oh-he also says 'surprise me' a lot. This movie didn't. Talented actor illustrates Flaubert's dictum about why you should be dispassionate when creating to avoid embarrassingly bad art.  * Gates Factor..Cloven-hooved and cardboard because we get no motivation, no facets to 'Gates'. He's evil because he is. Makes me want to hear Bill's side.
* BAd logic...it's a plot point that hero has to disclose a murder, but he won't tell major media outlets supposedly because they will tip off the villain. Does this jibe? Squelching evidence of a murder is a crime. Not notifying the authorities opens them up to a number of liability issues, would make them accomplice after the fact. Also, code & the murder could've been broadcast to websites & chatrooms. This guy is a computer genius? HOw about to the cops or to college websites?  * Suspense and Sesame seed scene--this has to be seen to be believed. A red herring whose presence stinks up the screen.
* Foley: sound of typing and visual on screen are VERY much out of synch.
* Casting--Phillipe, like Keanu in the Matrix, as a computer genius? Hmmmm. Forlani/Phillipe-no chemistry.
* When realizing who villain is, Phillipe has echo chamber and faces speaking moments that havent' been seen seriously in decades. Very funny, reminiscent of Pia Zadora's turn in The Lonely Lady film.
* Somebody says phillipe the character can't act (feign dumbness to their evil plotting)--a good moment in the film, because it provides a NEEDED inadvertent joke when considering the caliber of his performance rises only barely above Studio 54 nadir.
More bad stuff, directing moments that look like an error was looped in, cliche startle shots that an action director would've lopped off, logic of villain's plot that defies reason-good movie if you like THOSE bad movies.
The guy in the goatee is convincing. The only one.

1303804,4,B00003CXSF,"I thought his movie was pretty good, although the whole computer geek thing doesn't appeal to me. Tim Robbins did a great job, he was a geeky pringles lover that could be pretty sinister and frightening at times. Ryan Phillipe did a good job performing the role but I didn't like how he only really looked geeky in his ID pictures. He wore glasses in the id pictures, yet only wore them while on the computer. that makes no sense. he had, in the pictures, longer, more dissheveled hair, but his hair wasn't even like that in the movie. They should've found someone geekier.",980035200,2,573,4.519230769230769

From double crosses, to murder to cyber domination, AntiTrust is a non stop thrill ride, from start to finish. It is a great flick, espically for a movie that is only PG-13. The writter must be proud of himself, I love this movie. Ryan Phillipe is getting better all of the time. **Warning this could be considered a spolier** The ending was great, normally the good guy would kill the bad guy, but this ending was not like it at all. I could see a sequel sometime in the future, just imagine how much more better it would be if it were raed R. However, I am satisfied and I hope you are too with this great flick.

1303962,3,B00003CXSF,"Antitrust is a fun movie about the life of a computer programmer who works for a Bill Gates clone. Basically it's a Hollywood version of the Microsoft campus and culture. Though many people will disagree with me I did quite enjoy it in the theater and would like to see a deluxe Blu-ray release (however unlikely). Almost all the characters and plot devices are cliche and they haven't aged well at all. It's almost like an early version of ""The Social Network."" It seems to spoof itself at times so you can't take it too seriously. Tim Robbins is great if somewhat over the top. Rachael Leigh Cooke and Claire Forlani play their parts well and Ryan Philippe is likable enough as the lead. Overall, it is enjoyable if you want a light popcorn movie. Many scenes make me laugh so you have to be prepared to suspend disbelief and just have fun with it. It ended up being a complete flop with a $30 million budget but only managed to gross $11 million at the box office. However, it isn't as bad as that and certainly no worse than any recent thriller. If you liked Hackers you may appreciate this movie as well. Neither made the jump to Blu-ray. Admittedly, technology changes so fast so it's not going to satisfy its presumed core audience now (nor did it when it was originally released). Antitrust is much better than The Net which was produced a few years earlier than this film. This is a 4 star film in a 3 star release.

However, I decided to give it another chance, and purchased an inexpensive copy of it.  I actually don't regret it.  I think if you allow yourself to concentrate on the story instead of the supposed cheesiness, you'll find that there's quite an intriguing film to be found underneath.  Maybe it's because I'm a computer enthusiast and/or a ""geek,"" but I guess that's the point.  Only so many movies are made where they focus so closely on technology the way they do in this picture, so for me it was a lot of fun.  Is it Hollywood?  Is it somewhat far-fetched?  Maybe some of it, but the issues that they confront are quite relevant and thought-provoking, and I enjoyed the suspense and the drama, which kept me guessing all the way to the end as to how it was going to turn out.  And I think Tim Robbins pretty much nailed the eccentric CEO obsessed with his teenage passion who doesn't realize he's going too far.  Not a timeless masterpiece, but worth watching in my opinion.",1335139200,,1078,4.510309278350515

1304154,4,B00003CXSF,"Milo Hoffman and Teddy Chin are two of the brightest minds in the computer programming world and also best friends. Their views are very close to being the same when it comes to the world's knowledge. That it should be free. Teddy is just a tad more gung ho about it though. While Teddy sets up shop with two of their other friends, Milo (Ryan Phillippe) decides to take an offer that both Teddy and himself were given. An offer to work for NURV, and to make a lot of money. The two are both working on the same program. A program that will let every device such as cell phones, PDA's, laptops, and computers transfer and broadcast media such as pictures and videos. While Teddy and others across the world are trying to figure out the code for this software to share it to the world for free, NURV has other plans for completing the software... at any cost. After a tragic event happens, Milo begins to wonder what is really going on within NURV. Every time a breakthrough of the programming comes up, there is really no one Milo can see that could have done it. As Milo begins to do some of his own detective work, he becomes startled when he begins to unravel some of the hidden secrets within NURV. Who can he trust as he begins his plan to show who NURV really is.

Ok so right away the connection between NURV and Gary Winston (Tim Robbins) is blatantly clear that they are Microsoft and Bill Gates. NURV is the company that is getting into trouble for basically monopolizing the computer world, just like Microsoft did. And Gary is a multi-billionaire being blamed for thievery, just like Bill did. But once you get that out of you head and start watching the movie for itself, it becomes a really fun ride. Yes it can be a little bit by the numbers, and yes it can be predictable, but for what it's worth, I've enjoyed this movie every time I've seen it. Ryan and Tim's acting were of course really good. Tim was a lot of fun to watch because he would go from the older computer loving geek kid to the leader that rules with an iron fist in seconds. It was fun to watch Gary and Milo's interactions. Even though Gary is this billionaire genius, he would lean in and get excited with Milo while figuring out programming, all the while chompin down on some Pringles and making a mess everywhere. The movie is littered with geeky fun also, such as certain programming and hacking, but that doesn't take away from the casual viewer at all. The movie has some decent tense moments as well as a few good twists. Having both Claire Forlani and Rachel Leigh Cook sure doesn't hurt the movie either.

In the end, I would definitely give this a watch. I never got bored and had a good time watching it. I'm glad I own it.

P.S. - Rachel... if you ever read this review... call me gurl. I HEART YOU!!",1238457600,,2797,4.36468330134357
1304155,3,B00003CXSF,"I remember when this movie was first released.  It looked interesting and exciting to me and so I saw it in the theater, and I enjoyed it.  It's not a great movie; the plot is farfetched and one dimensional and the acting is flawed, but the film is entertaining none-the-less.  This is the definition of popcorn fluff; simple yet exciting and serviceable.

`Antitrust' tells the story of computer genius Milo Hoffman who plans to open an open-source site for the public with his friends, especially fellow genius Teddy Chin.  His plans are turned upside down when Gary Winston, president of NURV, offers him a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity; to single-handedly help him launch his open-source program.  Milo takes Gary up on his offer and soon has joined the NURV team and is working hard for the `enemy'.  Soon, obviously, Milo realizes that Gary is not the man he claims to be and that his business practices are less than admirable; in fact they are deadly.  In order to expose him for the monster he is he will need the help from a few friends, but who can he trust?

Ryan Phillippe was the `it' boy for a while thanks to his performance in `Cruel Intentions' and while I actually thought he nailed that performance beautifully I think he was a little miscast here.  He's not very believable as a computer genius; but whatever.  He is a little too pouty here, a little to melancholy.  Claire Forlani is a beautiful girl and a decent actress (I loved her in `Meet Joe Black') and she works here, but she's nothing spectacular.  In fact, none of the acting here is really up to par; even Tim Robbins turns out a somewhat hacked variation of his talent.  They deliver decently but no one ever excels.  Rachael Leigh Cook is beautiful to look at but kind of dense.

The plot is extremely unbelievable; but I kind of expected that much.  The ending is completely ridiculous and sadly the dialog at times is preposterously cheesy (i.e. ""In the real world, when you kill people they die - for real!"") but the actors do their best to sound like it's natural.  The character development was a real downside for me.  Everyone just seemed so clichd, so one-dimensional and simple.  No one really seems all that interesting to me.  They could have really improved there, but when you're attempting to create a semi-respectable teen thriller in order to fill theater seats then you really don't need character development; you just need decent thrills and a bunch of `hot young things'.

`Antitrust' is not a bad movie, but it's not a good one either.  It's in the middle.  It's a fun movie, one you can turn your brain off and enjoy.  Sometimes that is more than enough.  You could definitely do better than `Antitrust', but you could also do worse.",1211500800,,2741,4.670146137787056

Suspend disbelief in how sophisticated the survelliance of programmers at work and marvel at the plausible explanations to deny accountability and justify whatever ""creative"" means are required to be first with the technology.  The home of the C.E.O. is set and has features actually in the home of Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft.  A touch of humor is in citing Bill Gates technology and saying that his is ""primitive"".

Robbins wants to be the first person to be able to control global communications and will go to any desperate measures possible to attain his objective. Were it not for Phillippe, he would have pulled it off. Most pictures involving ""takeovers""in the past have involved some sort of military unrest or coup planning. In ""Antitrust"" we have civilian workers, many brilliant and well paid, working toward a common goal. The major problem is that Robbins is obsessed,unstable, and, armed with his ""wannabes"", an extremely dangerous personality: perhaps a Hitler in the making.

1304160,3,B00003CXSF,"The problem stated up front: the film isn't frightening enough.  The film isn't frightening enough mainly because the lead character, Milo--played by Ryan Phillippe--never seems to be in mortal danger.  And no matter what sinister mess the star of the show may find him or herself snarled up in--if the stakes aren't high enough, to the point where the hero looks seriously in trouble of surviving, you have what is ultimately a minor-league thriller.

This is a story of a computer whiz who signs on as the new Golden Boy of a software company called NURV, owned by Gary Winston (Tim Robbins giving a very strong performance), who has brazenly set a target-date for the unveiling of a revolutionary new communications system for PCs, handhelds, etc.--sort of a Unified Field breakthrough for worldwide chat--that will make him very wealthy.  If the system, SYNAPSE, doesn't work on time, Winston is a joke.  Milo, boy genius, must get all the worst bugs out of Gary Winston's brain-child before time runs out, but just as he's settling in--and getting the red-carpet treatment from everyone at the firm, including the resident Ice Queen, Lisa (Rachel Leigh Cook)--he's thrown a bit of a curve: Gary Winston keeps providing him with mysterious computer discs, full of radical new code, that will help Milo make the big breakthroughs.  Milo can't make sense of it; if he's the big saviour, where's all the brilliant code coming from?  His boss's smarmy shell cracks when Milo asks questions, and Milo gets a face full of a Gary Winston paranoid tantrum, his first clue that his ambitious employer is not the nice guy he seems to be.

But how far would Gary Winston go to get what he wants?  Is he procuring other programmers' code illegally, and if so, how?  Milo starts to deduce pieces of the truth that suggest coincidences aren' t always coincidences, and then someone close to him suffers a senseless tragedy.  Coincidence?  A shocked Milo enlists the aid of his girlfriend Alice (Claire Forlani), and even some old buddies he snubbed earlier in the film merely by going to work for supreme capitalist, to subvert all the cutting-edge security features at NURV, and even in Winston's home, to find out the real truth about the people he works for.  Along the way, Milo discovers he may have more hidden enemies than he thought.

That's the tense summary of the plot...now let me list all the things that sabotage the thrills:

Except for Tim Robbins, none of the bad guys are very scary.  Robbins's main henchman is the guy who played Doctor Tom in Ed Wood (friendly face, nerdy-looking (sorry, fella), practically bald, calm throughout).

Ryan Phillippe's character always seems to be one step ahead of the bad guys, certainly once he gets a whiff of what's really going on.  He pulls various clever tricks that allow him to move about areas of NURV that would normally be off-limits, and even when the bad guys know what he's up to, Milo KNOWS they know, but they allow him some leeway, because of course Gary Winston still needs SYNAPSE completed.  This creates a very interesting cat-and-mouse game but it seriously destroys any real threat to Milo, certainly for the bulk of the story.  It feels like a game.  It doesn't feel like anyone is ever going to just appear out of the shadows and point a gun in Milo's face and get rid of him, or even put a bomb in his desk-drawer.

There's no grime in this film.  Everything's polished, neat, shiny, pristine, new-looking, sanitized, orderly, whatever.  There's no dirt anywhere; even the nightly shadows of NURV seem disinfected.  I would argue that, on a psychological level, a thriller needs some dirt, some blurriness, some clutter, a back alley with some piles of rubbish thugs can hide behind.  This film's director seems to like things neat and stainless-steely and nonthreatening (see also Johnny English).  Thrillers need some dirt, and some unidentified shapes tucked in the shadows.

Finally--as I've alluded to already--though there are chase scenes, Milo-hiding scenes, Milo in danger of being deliberately fed Sesame seeds scenes (he's fatally allergic), Milo afraid to trust someone scenes--the truth is, Milo usually knows when he is in danger before danger has a chance to strike.  And the one time he's caught totally by surprise, he makes an ally.

I think Claire Forlani is a most beautiful actress, and she, along with everyone else in the film, gives a strong performance.  This film even features an uncredited appearance by one of my favourite actors, David Clennon (he played the creepy boss in ThirtySomething, appeared as slimey ""Radio Doctor"" Norris Breeze in an episode of WKRP In Cincinnati, appears in John Carpenter's The Thing and Being There, and, uh, an episode of Sledge Hammer!), but he's barely in it--strange!  The whole film is strangely watchable, despite the fact that it is never as thrilling as it could have been.",1172707200,2,4912,4.902055622732769
1304280,3,B00003CXSF,"Featuring an awesome young cast and the legendary Tim Robbins, this is an exciting cyber-thriller that will have you thinking one thing then surprise you with another twist. While the story may seem unbelievable, it is quality viewing, and anyone who likes a good thriller will have no trouble sitting through it. Still good to watch even after the first time, a good DVD to add to anyone's collection. Will appeal mostly to teenagers and young adults, it will stand up to the tests of time.",1163635200,,491,4.72093023255814
1304281,3,B00003CXSF,"Will ""Synapse"" be launched on schedule? Yes. They will do whatever it takes. The start of the film suggests a few graduate students with little money, experience, and connections can create successful software today. Do they know their customer's needs? There isn't much of a market for shareware anymore. Software comes bundled with computers, and most users don't care. (Unless paid advertising can change their minds.)

Milo shows up at NURV to begin work. Their office is ""open"", which can create interruptions that affect productivity. One TV news item tells of a competitor who is killed in a car crash; drugs were found in his system. Milo is impressed by some code and wonders where it came from; Gary Winston flies off the handle at this question. Highly sensitive? There is a mysterious attack on a friend of Milo's. Teddy had been close to an exciting discovery! Milo finds that a fiberglass cable allowed spying on Teddy. Who did it?

Milo reports his lost badge; this allows him entry to security, and a chance to snoop into the system. Soon Milo starts acting like a detective. He finds a system that contains private information on many of his friends. How can a powerful corporation arrange to hire criminals? What if they can also influence the Department of Justice? Research show how NURV is connected with major corporations. [Does this remind you of ""Big Brother"" in Orwell's 1984?] Wearing a tuxedo, Milo manages to find some IP addresses from Gary's private system. But Milo is suspected, and they plot his demise: Milo has an allergy and can suffer anaphylactic shock! So what is in that meal? Milo ""borrows"" a server to expose the conspiracy; he gets away with it! But his company car is bugged so they can follow him! Action and conflict follow, with more surprises.

Reviews aren't supposed to give away the ending, but we know the good guys must win in the end. ""The Net"" was a much better film, this one seems like another version. A work of fiction can guarantee a happy ending. We know what is happening in the real world. The film ends on a false claim. The coding created by anyone does not become ""open code"" by saying so. This statement is not made about any other work product, like a loaf of bread.

Back in August 1994 I saw a TV news item that showed ""Gary Winston"" and ""White House Bill"" meeting for a golf date. Each carried an identical gym bag to their golf cart. At the end they each carried away one of the identical gym bags. Afterwards the Department of Justice dropped its antitrust investigation. How many $100 bills could fit into one of those gym bags?",1160179200,,2603,4.676855895196507
1304282,4,B00003CXSF,"Antitrust is one of those movies filled with lots of great ideas and even some brilliant execution, but suffers from the weight of its own plot.  Because one of the central themes of the film is open-source (allowing everyone in the world to see the code of your programs so they can alter or improve it), this point ends up taking over the entire story and (sadly) trumps character.  As a result, some of the people aren't as fleshed out as they should be, and the main character's arc is a bit muted.

Nevertheless, the movie is still quite a lot of fun.  The climax of the film is a nice payoff for viewers and the very end isn't too sentimental (though a bit heavy-handed with the ""moral of the story"").

It's worth viewing.  Consider renting if you've never seen it before, in case this kind of movie isn't for you.",1126224000,,820,4.397350993377484
1304283,3,B00003CXSF,"What a time the late 1990s were, eh? Everywhere you looked, the computer age was underway. Or was it the information age? Or the digital age? I'm not sure they've decided on a title yet. Anyway, the rise of the Internet had everyone and their grandmother running to the store to buy a computer with a modem so they could access the best adult websites America has to offer. Words and terms like ""E-mail,"" ""Windows,"" ""search engines,"" ""AOL,"" and ""Netscape"" formed the building blocks of a new lingua franca for those in the know. I still remember the hysterics revolving around the release of Microsoft's Windows 98 operating system. Extraterrestrials landing on the White House lawn wouldn't have garnered more press coverage. All that excitement for a system loaded with bugs that crashed--at least on my computer--at least once a week. All hail the relative stability of Windows XP! Anyway, the revolution wouldn't be complete without Hollywood jumping on the bandwagon. Surprisingly, or perhaps not considering most people in Tinseltown aren't smart enough to understand the rudiments of computers, it took them until 2001 to release a film like ""Antitrust."" Say hello to a big bellyful of good old Hollywood anti-corporate claptrap.

Milo Forman (Ryan Phillippe) has just about everything going for him. He's got a good-looking girlfriend named Alice Poulson (Claire Forlani), he just graduated from a top-notch college where he won numerous awards for his computer programming skills, and Gary Winston (Tim Robbins) wants to offer him a job. Who's Gary Winston? A Bill Gates type geek with a few hundred trillion in the bank and a smile one expects to see in a morgue. Forman planned on working with a few of his school pals in their own little company devoted to open source software, but Winston's offer is too good to pass up. So it's off to visit Gary at NURV headquarters (yep, NURV; I couldn't make this up if I tried) to learn the ins and outs of working for the big boys. It is here that Milo makes nice with the ethereal beauty that is Lisa Calighan (Rachael Leigh Cook), and it's also here that he soon learns that he's Winston's golden boy. Gary and his executives are working on a new system, Synapse, which will link together every communication device on the planet through a bunch of satellites. And it's up to good old Milo to put the pieces of this amazing hardware together. Winston drops by at times to provide him with code and other interesting tidbits.

Problem is, Milo soon suspects that Winston and his cronies are stealing a lot of their information from other computer programmers. Not other companies, mind you, but from programmers sitting around in their garages writing code. In other words, stealing from people like Milo's friend Teddy Chin (Yee Jee Tso). The jerk! Of course, it's not easy to prove such a grand conspiracy, although Winston's occasional outbursts and his win at all costs mentality lends credence to the idea that NURV would resort to anything to stay ahead in the game. Even, do I dare say it, MURDER. After Teddy takes a one-way trip to that great operating system in the sky, Milo Forman launches an investigation of his employer fraught with peril. Hopefully, our brainy hero can count on the help of Agent Lyle Barton (Richard Roundtree) at the Justice Department, who is leading an anti-trust investigation into NURV. Then again, maybe he can't trust anyone. He certainly comes to distrust Alice Poulson, and with good reason. After all, why would a chick this good looking have anything to do with an ubergeek like Milo? Surprisingly, that's not why he suspects she's in on Winston's plan for global domination. It's got something to do with sesame seeds and...ahhh, just watch the movie.

I'm not sure whether ""Antitrust"" is a comedy or a thriller. The movie possesses elements of both, although one strongly suspects that those situations pointing to the former were unintentional. I liked a lot of the suspense elements in the movie, once it gets going in the second half, and I simply adored the angelic vision that is Rachael Leigh Cook. These things work and merit praise. But I found I couldn't stop laughing long enough to appreciate fully the serious issues presented in the film. The funniest thing about ""Antitrust"" is its paranoia. This movie absolutely reeks of far left-wing paranoia of the type currently espoused by those tin foil helmeted kooks manning the Bush barricades down in Texas. Big business run amok, massive surveillance operations, murder conspiracies; I could go on and on. It's like big brother with a pocket protector. And Winston's diabolical plan to take over the world? Who came up with this idea? As far as I can tell, it was either Snidely Whiplash or a Bond villain. Like any government or big corporate concern would unquestioningly turn control of their networks over to Gary Winston. Thank goodness we've got geeks like Ryan Phillippe--and by extension Hollywood--running around protecting us from Bill Gates wannabes!

Extras on the DVD include a commentary track from director Peter Howitt and editor Zach Staenberg, a music video, alternate opening and closing sequences, deleted scenes (I love Rachael Leigh Cook in the bathroom!), and a behind the scenes look at the movie chock full of interviews with the cast as well as proof that the filmmakers and all involved really researched the computer industry before making the movie. Uh huh. Even citizen of the world Tim Robbins deigns to drop in for a few comments about his transparent impersonation of Bill Gates. I'll give ""Antitrust"" three stars since I always enjoy a thriller, but the film's ability to draw a laugh when none was intended sort of takes away from what the filmmakers tried to accomplish.",1125100800,,5767,4.917864476386037
1304284,3,B00003CXSF,"Even though I'm not a fan of Ryan Phillipe's (a vastly overrated actor), it's not his fault that the movie doesn't soar to great heights.  ANTITRUST is competently made and it held my interest throughout.  There are so many false pretenses and twisty moments, though, that it tends to deflate the movie's underlying plot.  Tim Robbins seems to be having a wonderful time in his Bill Gates-like portrayal, it's hard to tell if he's taking his role dead serious, or if he just wants to make the most of the script's mechanisms.  Phillipe does okay in his role, but he lacks the maturity of someone like Matt Damon or Matt Davis to be effective in his role.  Claire Forlani and Racheal Leigh Cook are basically wasted.  ANTITRUST isn't an awful movie by any means; it's handsomely done and holds your interest; could have been better with a stronger, more convincing male lead, though.",1111708800,,882,4.73202614379085
1304285,2,B00003CXSF,"The only reason to watch this film is to see Tim Robbins as a dead-ringer for Bill Gates. It sure as heck isn't to see Ryan Philippe. I watched one of the featurettes and laughed because of how proud the filmmakers were that they bothered to use real code in the split-second scenes where you see the screen as the characters type furiously. Who cares?

If you want to see what the war to find the next great techno-innovation was really like, watch ""Pirates of Silicon Valley. This docu-drama concerns the very real industrial espionage on all sides that went into creating the first PCs. Bill Gates does the most and of course comes out on top. It's everything ""Anti-trust"" wishes to be, and without the preposterous murders.",1110844800,3,727,4.6796875

It's not over your head material and the basic story is greed.  In this case someone is killing people to get to the top of the heap.  Of course if the killer can get you to work for him then you have a chance of staying alive.  Gary Winston (Tim Robbins) is trying to build a global network but his genius comes at a high price.

Like I said, it's not Oscar material.  This film may take itself too seriously at times but it's okay.",1101686400,6,573,4.154545454545454
1304287,2,B00003CXSF,"The one good thing about this movie is that this is the first movie I've ever seen that uses _real_ computer commands for hacking.  If you watch the commands that the hero uses to hack into the computer, you will find that they are, in fact, real commands that work the way shown.

Other than that, the movie was pretty lame.  It could have been a good movie, but it was just a bit unbelieveable and not well thought through.  The open-source/closed-source differentiation was bad.  As an open-source/free software advocate, I thought that the portrayal of the reasons for open-source and the philosophy were very poorly portrayed.

I enjoyed seeing it for the hacking scenes, and to get to see a few of my favorite programmers on film in cameo shots.  It's also somewhat historic, as being the first mainstream film about monopoly power and open-source, even though it treated both subjects poorly (a real movie about the problems of monopolies would be great, but this wasn't it).  So, watch it for those reasons, because there isn't much else there.",1091664000,9,1052,4.805555555555555

I originally tried to shy away from this because of the obvious ""teen-appeal"", but sometimes I can't help myself when it comes to computer geek movies.

Recent college grad, Milo, is recruited by Gary Winston to join a team of talented programmers working for the dominate software giant.  The goal is to finish the code for Winston's satalite uplink system that will allow anyone with a cell phone, computer, or television to communicate in real time across all formats.  When Milo's best friend is found murdered while on the verge of an incredible technological breakthrough, Milo begins to suspect that the prestigious company he works for as well as those around him may not be as honorable as he thinks.

1304370,4,B00003CXSF,"Although it comes across as a movie custom fit for the youth of America who are not technologically challenged, it's actually enjoyable by anyone who cares to put some thought into the plot. Written and filmed around the pinnacle of the court battles between the Department of Justice and the Microsoft Corporation, it takes the Feds' claims of Microsoft's domination of the computer market, takes a fictional look at it with a twist of paranoia...and becomes a major motion picture.
Ryan Phillippe does a commendable job portraying Milo, a young brilliant programmer who is hired by Microsoft-esque corporation NURV. NURV is operated by Gary Winston, a seemingly nice guy who takes an evil turn, played by Tim Robbins who does a fantastic job. Claire Forlani, Rachael Leigh Cook, and even the original Shaft himself Richard Roundtree do nicely in their supporting roles. The best part of all is that this can be a film for all age groups. The profanity isn't over the top, something that seems to be a given in most big time movies today.

The acting is wooden, the plot tediously predictable, the characters less-than-one-dimensional, and the actresses were skanky. Worst of all, every element of the dastardly scheme which Ryan Phillippe's character uncovers is repeatedly explained ad nauseum as though the viewers were incapable of drawing any conclusions for themselves. For example, when the Bill Gates bad guy character says that the answer to a newly solved technological problem is ""not in the box, it's in the band"", we are treated to a full 10 minutes of flashbacks as Ryan remembers his friend, who was brutally murdered just recently, describing HIS OWN innovation with the exact same words - hmmmm, what could this possibly signify? Nope, can't work it out, how about some more flashbacks, and a shot of the bad guy's goons actually attacking the friend, to make it really obvious?

1304372,4,B00003CXSF,"This film is a pretty interesting film on an essential subject and it raises fundamental questions. What can a society do against a capitalist private monopoly ? Not much. The very principle of the capitalist market is to enable competition hence to enable one business to become a monopoly at any time. The only guarantee we can have is that this competition will be honest and not helped with criminal or illegal activities. But how can we be sure ? The film shows that it is very easy to use dark means to achieve one's economic aim. How can we stop it ? the film seems to think that only young rebels helped by some older agents and animated by the same competitive ideology (but to their own profit after all) can prevent it, and even so it becomes show business. The second answer is to decide that knowledge is a public common good and that everyone must have access to it. This is a good idea as long as it deals with patents whose amortizing could be spread out in time or whose cost could be covered by some public system  or service. But who is going to pay for the research ? This is less of a good idea when it deals with literature or arts because then the rights of the author over his own work is negated. How are authors, composers, etc, going to live if their work is no longer sold ? But the film raises a real problem in our society. It is easy to attack Bill Gates, actually named in the film, and deal with informatics which is a Wide Wild Wilderness. But I would like to see a film about pharmaceutical firms, about AIDS drugs sold at such a high price that millions of AIDS victims cannot afford them. The scapegoat procedure of the film is bad, very bad, but informatics cannot be compared with pharmaceutical drugs because with the latter we are speaking of life and death, even if with informatics we are speaking of the complete control of information and communication, of the mind and the government. Is Big Brother finally arrived, twenty years late ? How can we prevent it from happening and/or stop it ? Is it the fault of one man or of an over-competitive system ? Another film is necessary to go deeper into these questions ?

1304374,4,B00003CXSF,"The main enjoyment of watching this movie for me was the irony that a motion picture made by Hollywood made a hero out of someone on the fringe of the open source camp. I didn't find it unbelievable that Ryan was working as a computer programmer, and I feel almost offended at the implication that computer programmers can't be shallow and image conscious just like everyone else. Believe me, we can.
The main disappointment was that many people who saw it either missed the fact that the bad guy was committing murder, and therefore wasn't just a corrupt businessman, or that they thought that everyone involved in open source believes in liberating other people's code, or that they missed that the villain had already committed copyright infringement.
Who shouldn't see this movie: Open source advocates - you'll either feel offended at being portrayed as extremists, or, if you are one, you won't want to pay money to an MPAA movie. Computer programmers - you'll probably end up spoiling the movie for the people around you as you explain that things don't work that way in real life, although at least you can point out that they use Linux on their workstations.

It would most certainly be cheaper to just buy one of the programs from all the kids knocking themselves out in garages all over the country then to develop NERV, and especially cheaper then to kill every character.  This character is a pathetic fame seeker who is more concerned with being first, or for having an expensive daycare centre then making money.  This is no more obvious when one sees that his program team selected based on degrees and awards, particularly Milo Hoffman is one of the most important programmers yet he never has to show a portfolio or sample programs.

(Webster's)  This movie gets you thinking.  Sure, the plots could be better, the actors more aware, and the screenplay more intense and elaborate, but the movie really poses some good, inspiring roles and questions human behavior in capatalism.  ""How many will be altruistic, and how many will make billions off of your generosity?""  Enron, WorldCom, and Tyco CEO's and directors were brought down by insider whistle blowers just like Milo Hoffman (Phillippe).  The movie gives a realistic portrayal of some CEO's tricks of how to keep from being caught, and what it ultimately means if you decide to blow the whistle on them.
""You're a one or a zero, alive or dead.""  In the binary computer world of business, Gary Winston (Robbins) is trying to capitalize on other's inventions and knowledge, as well as their time, money, and careers, to further his profits and control within and without his company NURV.  Robbins does a fine job with his part, and looks the part as well (Similar look in the film to Bill Gates, as intended.)  The story is played out in a pleasing way, and grabs your attention after the introductory period, about 25 minutes long, and goes until the last minute or so.  The story is real to life, and the actors try (and fail at points) to fully ingage their interest and full ability into their roles.  Peter Howitt did a great job in deciding which scenes to keep and which to discard from the theatrical version, as seen in the commentary on the DVD.  The use of directors from James Bond films, and The Matrix helped the aesthetics of the film as well.
Overall, it is a good film that can be seen again, and is worth your time.  I also wonder, since the film was made in 2000 and released in 2001, how many people saw the movie, and were inspired to finally blow the whistle, as 2001 and 2002 marked Corporate Amaerica's worst bankruptcies and business frauds in history.

1304379,5,B00003CXSF,"Anti Trust is a highly enjoyable above average thriller that offers a lot and keeps its pace till the very end, unlike many thrillers these days that start with a lot of promise, only to lose it half way through.
The story of a computer genuis geek Ryan Phillipe, joining a powerful and 'hip' computer firm ,founded by the equally geek, genuis but greedy Tim Robbins to develop a new state of the art, money making software. Greed and stiff competition lead to murder, and it is up to our young hero to unravel the mystery and expose the criminals. This is all filmed with a unrelenting pace that is guaranteed to keep you at the edge of your seat.
Ryan Phillipe is a good actor, a talent that should be invested more in by directors and producers, while Tim Robbins, is of course one of the best actors around, and he plays the computer boss to perfection. The angelic beauty Brit Claire Forlani, provides the female lead, and is quite good, as the deceptive love interest. Rachel Leigh Cook,although billed as a second  female lead, has a supporting minor role that is very much underdeveloped in my opinion.
Director Peter Howitt is the Ron Howard of British cinema. A TV star in late 80s early 90s with mega hit Liverpudian sitcom Bread, he moved successfully to directing few years back to do the very well made romantic 'What If' fantasy Sliding Doors, up to his latest release, the Rowan Atkinson tailor made feature Johnny English.
He has a cameo as a homeless man in the film. Although this I find unnecessary pretentiousness from directors nowadays to appear in cameos, it does not take away anything from the film. When Hitchock appeared in his films, he did it in a very original way, as if each time taunting the viewer to 'spot him', while Scorsese regularily appears in his films in a tongue in cheek manner (from playing the psychotic murderer in Taxi Driver to appearing for few seconds as a family man dressed for dinner in Gangs of New York).Yet this practice has become a staple of many directors, other that Howitt, I recall Todd Phillips who also likes to make appearances in his films, as the toe sucking weirdo in Road Trip in a surreal and funny scene,and most recently in Old School.
Having said all that, Peter Howitt's cameo notwithstanding, he is a very talented director that I hope would make many good films in the future.
So back to Anti Trust, whether you write software between commercials or you still associate the word 'mouse' with cute little rodents, you will still enjoy this film immensely, a well made underrated thriller that is worth your dollars.",1058054400,2,2592,4.647058823529412

1304461,4,B00003CXSF,"I think this was a solid movie, if not a bit campy with the Bill Gates look-alike.  All irony aside, Tim Robbins plays the part well of a lumbering computer dweeb who lost the meaning of chips and dips on a Saturday night; it seems his character, in the whirlwind of multi-billion dollar success, was more misled by bad buisiness partners than he was diabolical.  In fact, the way he played it at the end (albeit, a bit contrived) made it seem that he didn't have the where-with-all to actually order a man to murder someone else.  In deed, he seemed more driven by the people who surrounded him, which would explain the anger in his character's portrayal.
Ryan Phillippe looks the part of a cute, curly-haired kid who just doesn't have a clue...that is until Act III: at which point he runs the show...what a pity the writers made him that way; many of the ""Geeks"" I know are stupendously intelligent as well as being paranoid to a fault, much like Milo's murdered friend Teddy.  Good names, though.  However, I thought the Internet hits graph, at the end, in the garage, was a bit of overkill.
Considering that the megopolis of the computer industry's brain-child was exclusively geared at surveiling the ""Geeks,"" I thought that the cavalier attitude toward computer genius was overplayed with a sort of in-your-face name calling melieu.
Otherwise, the script seemed well put together and the movie paced fairly well...I wasn't bored.",1041638400,,1436,4.797570850202429

Lisa (Cook), plays one of Gary's most loyal employees. Milo (Phillipe) is a computer genius, who is part of this club in a garage with his friends Teddy and Brian, where they try and find out what makes certain organizations so BIG. Gary calls up Milo and asks him to come and work for him. Milo excepts. One night Milo comes home to his girlfriend ( Fornali)  crying to tell him that his friend Teddy's been killed.

1304464,5,B00003CXSF,"This movie is quite well done. I do believe that it is a thinly veiled shot at Microsoft (a bit of an exaggeration to get the point across that a company that huge can be rather evil).  The cast is rather impressive.  Tim Robbins, made up to look suspiciously like Bill Gates, was amazing as ""Gary Winston,"" the C.E.O. of N.E.R.V., a software giant only comparable to that of the likes of Microsoft.  Ryan Phillippe, plays ""Milo Hoffman,"" a Stanford educated computer geek, who is hired by N.E.R.V. to complete work on the ultimate piece of media software called ""Synapse.""  Milo's girlfriend, played by ""Mallrats"" veteran Claire Forlani, is rather good in her role.  Rachael Leigh Cook, from ""She's All That"" is amazing too!  I think that she gets better in every movie she is in.
This movie takes some pretty good twists and turns. It boils down to be murder mystery with a little bit of fighting ""Big Brother."" Generally, I am not a fan of suspense.  It annoys me, because generally we always know which way it is heading.  ""Antitrust"" has great suspense.  It is never over-the-top.  The movie can be rather unpredictable.
This movie is everything that movies like ""Hackers"" lack.  It is obviously not going to be perfect representation of the Information Technology industry, but it is remarkably close (and really, that would was too close it would probably be bad for business).  There are no flashy graphics when it comes to how the code and computers are used.  Unlike ""Hackers,"" geeks are geeks here; it isn't the rave scene going around playing computer ""Robin Hoods.""  Not to say that there is too much ""geek stuff"" in the movie, but what is there looks and feels like the real thing.
""Antitrust"" is the best tech movie I have ever seen.  The cast is perfect.  I have watched this DVD probably twenty times and have yet to tire seeing it.  I recommend it to everyone I know in IT, and most anyone else too.  The movie is top-shelf material.",1037059200,4,1951,4.654970760233918

1304467,5,B00003CXSF,"""Antitrust"" is the best cyber-flick I've seen in years. It's suspenseful, fast-pased, and just incredibly entertaining. Ryan Phillippe stars as Milo Hoffman, a young computer genius who gets the opportunity of a lifetime: working for the highest-ranked computer company in the world, N.U.R.V. His best friend (also a computer geek), gets the job position, too...but rejects it because he feels as though the company's owner, Gary Winston (Tim Robbins) will stop at nothing to stay at the top. So Milo takes his girlfriend, Alice (Claire Forlani), and they move out to the N.U.R.V. campus and he takes the job. It's only a few weeks in his new job position when he learns that his best friend was brutally murdered, and then he finds out that the murder may be linked to his new company! Now it's up to Milo to take all the knowledge he has to help bring down the N.U.R.V. company and stop Winston from destroying peoples' lives.
The acting is great from the entire cast...especially Ryan Phillippe, who is probably in one of his best roles yet. Rachael Leigh Cook plays Lisa, a smart girl who also works for the N.U.R.V. company and tries to help Milo. Tim Robbins, as always, is superb as the power-hungry company owner. The supporting cast is also excellent.
The DVD is really good, because it includes an Everclear music video, deleted scenes with director's commentary, and a featurette on computer crimes and such. The screenplay was well-written, and the film was engaging.
I recommend this for everybody who enjoys computer crime flicks!

1304468,3,B00003CXSF,"Somewhere, there was an intention to come up with a good movie here.  I'm not sure if it was meant to be a thriller, an indictment of the Bill Gates syndrome, or a satire.  It would've done well as any of the three.
There is stuff here for computer buffs, and should be worth seeing by those in that camp.  There does seem to be some that think it fails in accuracy, but even if it does, it will give groups of computer people something to talk about.
And from about the mid point on, it comes close to succeeding as a thriller if you don't think too much about it.  It's kind of the type of movie to watch when your brain's worn out and you enjoy watching the flickers on the screen.",1026259200,,684,4.082089552238806
1304469,1,B00003CXSF,"It probably seemed like a good idea at the time, showing the terrible potential of huge computer firms.  Yet this paranoid fantasy never manages to scare its audience, it doesn't even manage to make them care.  It has Ryan Phillipe as a computer whizz who discovers that the man who has employed him (Robbins) is killing off his competitors.
There are countless flaws in this movie, especially in casting Ryan Phillipe as the main character.  Marvellous as he was in 'Cruel Intentions', he cannot play a nerd to save his life, even if someone obviously did think that he could if he was wearing glasses.  As the computer business owner, in a clumsy parallel with Bill Gates, Robbins switches between serious and ludicrous.  Both are good actors stuck in the wrong movie.  The two female leads, Claire Forlani and Rachel Leigh Cook are used as eye candy and little else.  Someone should have thought long and hard before casting a lot of beautiful teenagers as computer geniuses.
There is nothing sophisticated or even remotely realisitic about this.  For example, Robbins has his enemies killed through street thugs.  A thousand other paranoid fantasies in this vein are out there and 'Antitrust' would have to come at the bottom of the pile.  The countless twists and turns in the tale certainly aren't ironic, they're just plain stupid.  Plus, it's unclear who Howitt was aiming the movie at.  It's genre would suggest an entirely different audience to its stars.  The ending has a moral tagged on as an afterthought and all loose ends are tied up with one of the most laughable conclusions to any movie.  There really is little of note in this movie at all.",1016323200,5,1660,4.799295774647887
1304540,2,B00003CXSF,"I can't tell a joke well. A bad joke isn't funny no matter who tells it, but a person such as myself can make a good joke bad. A story also has to be told well and, in the case of a movie, filmed well, to be interesting. The problem with AntiTrust is that it's an okay tale that isn't told or filmed very well. It's lovely to look at, yet has neither electricity nor soul.
Milo [Ryan Phillippe] is a computer genius. Fresh out of college, he plans to start a business with some friends out of a garage, just like their computer heroes did twenty years ago. They plan to make their mark in cyberspace. One day, seemingly out of the blue, Milo and his best friend are approached by Gary Winston [Tim Robbins], who wants them to come to work for his giant, multinational company. It seems Winston is about to launch a computer program which will revolutionize communications, but he needs a few good geeks to get it operational. The friend, a wise young man, decides to stick to his original plan, but Milo gets sucked in. Along with his girlfriend Alice [Claire Forlani], he packs up and moves to Portland, Oregon, the home of Winston's Nurve Corporation. It isn't long before Milo suspects that Winston will literally kill to get what he wants. Breakthroughs in the programming of the new product always seem to happen just after the mysterious death of some bright programmer.
One of the problems in the movie is with some of the casting. Tim Robbins is fine as Winston, making him look and act so much like Bill Gates that it's a bit spooky. Ryan Phillippe, however, I can't buy as any kind of genius. He's done a good job in the past playing such roles as a sociopath [Cruel Intentions], a psychopath [The Way of the Gun] and a party boy [54]. But a computer whiz? I don't think so. Rachael Lee Cook is equally unbelievable as Lisa, a fellow programmer. Claire Forlani, who may be a star one day soon, is fine as Alice, but it's a part that's way beneath her capabilities.
AntiTrust belongs to the paranoid thriller genre. That's the one in which only the hero has figured out a diabolical plot. Until the end of the movie, the rest of the characters are almost always blind to the truth and tend to believe that the hero is simply stressed out. Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window is a classic example of this kind of film. To succeed, the movie must cause the audience to care about the protagonist. It must relate to him This doesn't happen in AntiTrust. Milo is just too bland and lame to hold our interest. It's one of those cases where, if we relate to anyone at all, it's to the bad guy, Winston. At least he's quick-witted and somehow humorous. You know a movie is in trouble when we start rooting for the villian.",1016150400,4,2719,4.429141716566866
1304541,4,B00003CXSF,"This film is a perfect thriller for our times.

1304544,3,B00003CXSF,"Like an earth with two moons, the world in which we live has evolved toward a schizophrenic level of dual realities, one sensory based, tangible; the other a reality of the mind that can be found in the dimension we know as cyberspace.  And maintaining the latter has become big business in the former:  Providing software that changes the parameters of that reality on a daily-- even hourly-- basis.  It's a big, and moreover, a binary industry, a business in which (according to this film) you are either a ""one"" or a ""zero,"" and it's therefore imperative to stay ahead of the competition at any cost.  Which is exactly the position explored by director Peter Howitt in ""AntiTrust,"" a thriller that puts something of a paranoid perspective on the world born of the microchip.
 Based in the Pacific Northwest, N.U.R.V. (Never Underestimate Radical Vision), the empire of software magnate Gary Winston (Tim Robbins), is on the verge of achieving a quantum leap forward in the realm of global communications.  Their ""Synapse"" satellite system, once operational, will make global communications through any medium a reality.  All they need is one more all important piece of the puzzle to implement it, and toward that end Winston has recruited Milo Hoffman (Ryan Phillippe), a young computer genius, one of maybe twenty programmers in the world who can accomplish the task before the targeted date set by Winston to launch Synapse.
 The carrot on the stick that Winston dangles in front of Milo is too tempting to refuse, so Milo abandons his plan of starting up his own company, in which he would have been partners with his best friend, Teddy (Yee Jee Tso), to accept the position-- and the challenge-- at N.U.R.V.  Very quickly, however, this apparently perfect world into which Milo has entered begins to implode on him, beginning with the tragic death of Teddy, apparently the victim of what looks to be a racially motivated hate crime.  But then something happens which causes Milo to question the truth about Teddy's murder, as well as the methods Gary Winston employs to keep N.U.R.V. at the top of the charts.  And he is determined to find the answers at any cost; whatever it takes, he will know the truth before it's over.
 With this film, Howitt succeeds in putting a fresh face on the concept of the ""computer nerd,"" and though overall it may be a bit to slick for it's own good, he does provide some thrills with it and manages to maintain enough tension and suspense throughout to keep it interesting.  As pure entertainment it works, but it's not one into which you want to delve too deeply; just sit back and enjoy the ride.  If you do insist on looking closely, you'll discover a plot that is something of a cut-and-paste job, into which an element is injected purely to move the story in a certain direction, and it does, but at the cost of compromising the film's credibility somewhat.  There is an ""All is not what it seems"" aspect to it that is fairly obvious from the outset, but Howitt fails to mine it's potential to the fullest, and it leaves you wondering how much better this would've been in the hands of a Hitchcock or Mamet (and, granted, that's pretty exclusive territory).  Howitt does well enough, but he's still playing at ""Triple A"" level, not quite ready for the ""Show.""  What he does have going for him are the performances of his personable and very watchable stars, Robbins and Phillippe.
 The character of Gary Winston is Bill Gates, roman a clef, and is well served by Robbins' portrayal of what could be called Gates' fictional evil twin.  Robbins sells the character with his natural, charismatic personality and makes the image of Winston as a leader and motivator believable.  And he adds some nice, personal touches-- his penchant for potato chips, for example-- that fleshes out the character and gives you the whole package rather than just a surface-will-suffice representation.  Though with a completely different character, Robbins has been down this road before, in ""Arlington Road,"" and now, in creating Winston, proves beyond any doubt his adeptness at playing to the dark side and making it real.
 Phillippe, too, gives an engaging performance as Milo, lending an air of introspection to his character that really brings him to life.  It's an earnest portrayal and very well presented.  Phillippe has a genuine quality that makes him stand out, even as he did as part of the ensemble cast of ""Playing By Heart,"" in 1998, in which he shared the screen with the likes of Sean Connery, Angelina Jolie, Dennis Quaid and Ellen Burstyn.  His performance here, in fact-- along with Robbins-- is a big part of what makes this film so agreeable.  He's a fine young actor who has already demonstrated he has what it takes to carry a film on his own, and he's definitely one to keep an eye on as his career develops.
 As Alice, the woman in Milo's life, Claire Forlani looks elegant and has an ingratiating quality that draws the eye to her, and her character, though less than detailed, is believable.  Rachael Leigh Cook, on the other hand, is attractive, but her character, Lisa, lacks definition, and what you get is something of a ""Cliff's Notes"" version of who she is.  With both characters, Howitt seems to have had trouble getting a handle on how best to present them, especially Cook, who ultimately serves as little more than window dressing.
 The supporting cast includes Douglas McFerran (Bob), Richard Roundtree (Barton), Tygh Runyan (Banks) and Tyler Labine (doing a Jack Black take on his character, Redmond).  ""AntiTrust"" may not equal the paranoia induced by ""Enemy of the State,"" but it does raise some questions about where technology is taking us, and more importantly, who is in the driver's seat.  It's a cautionary tale, good for some thrills; but again, just don't look too deep.",1012608000,3,5847,4.821821821821822

Aside from its many references to the open source model of software development (...), Gnome desktops (...) also features prominently on all the computer screens in this film.  In fact, if you go to the film's website, it features interviews with Linux gurus like Miguel de Icaza from the Gnome project and Joe ""Maddog"" Hall from Linux international.  Never have I seen a film that so openly taken up the cause of open source movement.
This of course would probably have escaped most watchers of this films, who are simply looking for entertainment.  In this sense the film is quite flawed.  Aside from the fact that most hackers don't look like Ryan Philippe or Rachel Leigh Cook, the plot requires a serious suspense of belief.  First of all, we are asked to believe that a software monopoly is killing off potential budding programmers who might threaten its commercial success.  I hate Microsoft passionately, but not even Microsoft is that evil.  This undermines the premise of the film, because it sets up an unbelievable monster, when in fact the real monster is far more complicated in its monopolistic evil.
There are also many inconsistencies in the character development in this film that screams for attention.  For instance, consider the security guard at NURV who seems hell bent at catching Milo in the act.  All of a sudden at the last minute he turns around and assisted Milo's attempt to destroy the company.  No explanation given for this unbelievably sudden twist in the plot.

The movie opens with some character development with the ""good guys"" discussing the benefits of open source programming, which is a good hook to the hacker community but a concept lost on the general population.  Unfortunately this concept is one of the focal points of the movie.
All in all the plot is good, not too predictable.  Various tech elements that are thrown are are great.  There are some subtle things that only techies will notice but they really enhance the quality of the movie.

But when several programmers end up dead and the clues lead to N.U.R.V., Milo starts an investigation, but soon finds out it's very difficult to decide who he can trust to discover the truth.
This is 1 of very few computer related movies I know of that actually take enough interest in the computer business and show the viewers some actual computer code for starters.
The real fun part of this movie is the finger-pointing towards Microsoft (the N.U.R.V. campus looks alot like the one MS has). Also letting the world know that human knowledge belongs to the world is a nicely used feature!
The differences shown between the Open Source community and the multi-million dollar software companies like N.U.R.V. ,all of these things do exist in the real world.

Hey wait, that's not Bill Gates!
This is a fun movie for anyone who liked the movie The Net. I myself like a good computer suspense thriller with a cute hero.
This movie is about a hero named Milo (Ryan Phillippe) who discovers that not everyone is as idealistic in the real world of the corporate computer business .
It's got all the fun elements--flirting, jealousy, Gary Winston (aka Tim Robbins, aka 'Bill Gates' persona), backstabbing, and of course the hero's journey to reveal the truth.
If you want a good movie for a Sunday afternoon flick--this is it. Rent this for no other reason than to see some awesome art on the walls--you'll know what I mean after you watch it!",996278400,,735,4.492537313432836
1304748,4,B00003CXSF,"This is a credible techno-thriller that goes a bit too far in its anti-corporate message, but is highly entertaining nonetheless.  Milo Hoffman (Ryan Phillipe) is a boy genius who lands a job as an elite programmer for the most prodigious technology firm in the world (clearly patterned after Microsoft).  His tech genius friends are disappointed that he sold out to the corporate behemoth.  They believe that all source code should be non-proprietary (translation: programs that programmers create should be free for everyone to use).  This is where the liberal political subtext gets preachy and inane.  Corporations = Evil, Little Guys = Good.
Milo is recruited by the Chairman of the company, Gary Winston (Tim Robbins) to work on developing the software for the satellite system that Winston will use to take over the world.  Milo is taken in by Winston and the entire culture, until he discovers that Winston is stealing code from other developers through the use of surveillance cameras, and that Winston had one of his best friends killed.
Despite the implausible workup, the film then shifts into high gear and provides a thrill-a-minute roller coaster ride of intrigue and suspense where Milo is racing against time to prevent the satellite system from going online.  There are a lot of scenes that stretch credulity, but not so bad as to be ridiculous.  Industry insiders will enjoy the codehead jokes.
The acting is mixed.  Ryan Phillipe is not terribly believable as a computer geek.  Phillipe has yet to transcend his well-earned teen idol status as the hottie from ""54"" and ""Cruel Intentions"".  But his pouty good looks and demeanor were a mismatch with his geeky character.  His nerdy friends are far better cast than he.  Claire Forlani (""Meet Joe Black"", ""Boys and Girls"") gives another fine performance as Milo's duplicitous girlfriend.  Rachel Leigh Cook (""She's All That"") is another actor who is out of her element.  She is cute, but unbelievable as a supergeek.
Tim Robbins must have relished this role.  He plays Gary Winston, in an unabashed caricature of Bill Gates.  They were shameless in creating Winston's home to be identical to the description Gates gave of his own home in his book.  Robbins, who is a vociferous and fanatical leftist that frequently and publicly yearns for America to become a Socialist society, threw himself into this lampoon of the techno-corporate culture.  His performance is outstanding, deftly hiding his maniacal nature with a reasonable corporate demeanor.
If you can get beyond the mocking anti-corporate subtext, you will find this to be an enjoyable thriller.  I rated it a 7/10.  Software developers will probably enjoy this film greatly.",995155200,,2702,5.109339407744875
1304749,3,B00003CXSF,"Being a techie myself, I thought this movie kept my attention long enough to keep the unrealistic plot where it belonged - behind the nerdy stuff. The acting was so-so but what do you expect from Hollywood actors trying to be something they aren't? Tim Robbins was very plastic and inconsistent; the plot twists were fairly predictable and the attempts at humor didn't work very well. Otherwise, I really enjoyed watching the gadgetry and *real* programming screenshots. For once, Hollywood didn't fabricate stupid looking futuristic computer screens and peripherals. I also have a better appreciation for the open source community than before. Nothing against Microsoft, though, because MS is an American company (read capitalistic) from the ground up and has earned money the American way. I love the line, ""All it takes is some kid in a garage to knock down N.U.R.V..."" (paraphrased) Ah, the American dream lives!!",994636800,,917,5.202702702702703

The company now seeks new employees, new employees with the skill and creative instinct to put out its new communications software to make millions.  Phillippes is a computer geek that works in his garage and gets hired to join the company, but soon finds out its darker motive.  A good film, exciting, beleivable.",994550400,,633,5.0576923076923075
1304751,3,B00003CXSF,"""Antitrust"" is yet another in an increasingly long line of cyber-techno thrillers designed to scare the be-Jesus out of the paranoiacs among us - particularly those who fear that computer technology provides the perfect tool for ending personal privacy as we know it.  Certainly, ""Enemy of the State"" remains as the high watermark of the genre, but ""Antitrust's attempt to cope with some of the same themes, albeit on a somewhat smaller scale, yields some impressive results.
Like most movies made in the capitalistic US of A, ""Antitrust"" seems oddly derisive and suspicious of the corporate-world mentality.  Thus, we are not really surprised to find that this film, like so many others, demonizes the entrepreneurial spirit as it glorifies youthful virtue and ingenuity.  Tim Robbins plays a dark version of Bill Gates, an overgrown computer geek who has parleyed his nerdishness into a multi-billion dollar software monopoly.  Here again we have a successful business executive portrayed as a nefarious single-minded villain up against the morally virtuous youthful genius, Milo, played by a bland Ryan Phillipe.
Given the predictability of the premise, ""Antitrust"" scores as a generally effective thriller thanks to its many genuinely impressive plot twists and turns and its ability to generate suspense in a number of crucial scenes.  The film manages to keep us guessing at every turn.  Like Milo, we are never entirely sure whom we can and cannot trust.  And Robbins provides such a crafty villain - part Machiavellian genius, part emotionally stunted adolescent - that he rivets our attention in any scene in which he happens to appear.  This is more than can be said for Milo, who as a central figure and heroic protagonist, fails to engage our interest to any great extent.  Luckily, the details of the plot do that for us.
I would be remiss if I did not take special note of the extraordinary art direction and set decoration that adorn the film.  The look of the film perfectly reflects the cyber-world plasticity around which these people center their lives.
""Antitrust"" doesn't exactly break new ground in its rather recent but already overworked genre - but the speed, energy and creativity with which the film approaches its subject make it a satisfying entertainment.",994377600,2,2285,5.118279569892473

Everything was so formulaic.  The acting, which was poor, hurt the movie a lot.  Ryan Phillippe is a good actor, but he doesn't have the stuff to carry a movie all by himself.  I was highly disappointed in the quality of Tim Robbins acting.  It has seemed his film career has really taken off lately, but it takes a step back with the making of Antitrust.  The directing was OK, but nothing to brag about.  But I did think Milo (Phillippe) figured everything out way to quickly.  And the bad guy/good guy was easy to figure out.  Everything was so predictable.  The music choices for the film were terrible.  Putting Alternative/Pop music into a movie automatically makes me take the movie less seriously.

But it's mostly pretty predictable, and the parallels between corporate giant NURV, its CEO (with his elaborate coastal mansion), its Justice Department investigation, its large corporate ""campus"" in the Pacific Northwest, and a major real-world software giant are unmistakable. These guys, however, are doing stuff Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison, et al have never even imagined. On top of it all, NURV has also managed to manipulate and infiltrate everywhere.
If the plot of ""Anti-Trust"" is a little ""over the top"", that isn't the only problem. The acting is mediocre, as well. Ryan Phillippe as a computer genius is pretty hard to swallow. Tim Robbins plays the evil NURV CEO about like MisterRogers might. The rest of the cast is just so-so.
""Anti-Trust"" is a mildly interesting drama. I can't imagine any reason for wanting to see it more than once, though. I recently reviewed ""What Women Want"" and gave it three stars. I'm giving ""Anti-Trust"" three stars, too, but the two certainly aren't equal. ""What Women Want"" is a strong three stars (3 plus), while ""Anti-Trust"" is a weak three stars (3 minus). Just my opinion, but don't buy this movie unless you've seen it already and are sure you want it.",990230400,2,1791,4.837133550488599

7918156,5,B00003CXSF,"My brother's a computer engineer.  When I told him about this movie he was less than interested.  After he saw it with me he said he liked it better than Hackers and The Net.  He likes The Net for the same reason most men like it -- Sandra Bullock!!!  Anyway, he said The Net was not realistic at all and Hackers was just a lot of fun, but Antitrust caused him to bring to mind and discussion some real-life scenarios like the ones in this movie.  I'm not a computer geek but I love this movie.  That's why I had to have it.",1490400000,,524,4.038834951456311
