8546400,5,B00A2YLM9C,"I discovered this video in an exercise class for seniors.  I absolutely loved it.  I have arthritis and my joints are always stiff and sore.  After using this video for a week, I felt so much better.  I highly recommend it for anyone who needs to gently exercise their joint for better mobility.  I have viewed several chair yoga videos and found this one to be the best.  She doesn't overdo any one exercise and explains what each exercise is designed to help.",1430524800,5,461,4.493975903614458
