2499169,5,B000E6EHNG,"Proof that Oprah has no european DNA in her body.  Many people should watch all professor Henry Gates Jr. films.
Maybe the bible is correct,  "" in the beginning there were 3 mankinds,  the sons of god,  the sons of man and the giants"".

Bought this to send to my daughter.",1295913600,2,272,4.254901960784314

2499171,5,B000E6EHNG,"I really enjoyed this series,and wish to congratulate PBS for again being in the vanguard by producing it. For those interested in African-American genealogy,I feel this is a must have. And even if you're not a fan of genealogy itself, the celebrities and the presentations of their 'stories' are interesting in and of themselves. Highly recommend!",1237334400,4,348,5.232142857142857
2499172,5,B000E6EHNG,"A wonderful PBS program hosted by Henry Louis Gates.  With the aid of historians and geneologists, Professor Gates researches his own history and that of several prominent African Americans. Each guest speaks of his or her own knowledge of their ancestors and Professor Gates fills in the gaps using census records, estate diaries, archives and DNA. Everyone is in some way surprised by what they learn concerning their lineage. Professor Gates is a gifted communicator, and the interaction between he and his guests is very interesting.  I loved the segments with him and his dad and aunt.  The parts regarding slavery are very moving--it's sobering to see how human beings were put on the level of oxen or cattle with some records not even listing their names.  The guests appeared to be deeply touched when told of their enslaved ancestors.  I would highly recommend this well made, fascinating DVD to anyone who is interested in geneology or African American issues, or really anyone.",1219363200,7,988,5.03680981595092
2499173,4,B000E6EHNG,"Quincy Jones and I are related, so I found this video to be very enlightening. It was a well done piece about African American heritage.",1209427200,2,136,4.48
2499174,4,B000E6EHNG,"This video was very entertaining.  It researches the family history of several prominent african amerians.  It also provides a general history  of blacks in slavery, Jim Crow years, the Civil War, The Middle Passage and the Great Migration.  Specific information is given on how DNA can assist in geneology studies.  I recommend this video for the family.",1198540800,6,355,5.157894736842105
2499175,5,B000E6EHNG,"I watched this on PBS during it's initial airing.  Unfortunately, many friends did not.  I'm purchasing this now one as a gift for a dear friend and one for myself to watch with other friends.  I found it extremely interesting and educational for people of all nationalities. Whether you are African-American or any other nationality this is something to watch. The diversity on the outcome of the research done on Oprah, Q, Whoopi, Chris Tucker, & all the others done during this research was astounding and very interesting.  Just to find out Penn State doing the Master File on genetic tracking.  Just a swab of your saliva from your mouth and your family genes can be backtracked to the actual birthplace of your family.  Just so thought-provoking on so many levels.",1153008000,23,770,4.8396946564885495
2499176,5,B000E6EHNG,"I was so pleased with this project.  This is an excellent source for college professors and instructors who teach courses on race.  As someone who has lived in Africa, I was moved by Chris Tucker's reaction to the reception he received by the Angolan people.  The idea that we can trace our ancestry to Europe, Africa the Middle East based on our DNA is absolutely fascinating.  Finally African Americans, all Americans have a lens in which to view the concept that we are more alike than we are different.  Henry Louis Gates is to be commended for his foresight and scholarship.",1140220800,35,579,4.693069306930693

2499218,5,B000E6EHNG,"I thought I reviewed this years ago!  Anyway, I fell in love with Dr. Gates' work when the show aired on PBS.  Dr. Carson is one of my heroes.  His story is about miracles.  Anyway, I will be showing this to my grand children.  We were robbed of our heritage.  Thanks to Dr. Gates and others, we know quite a bit.",1391990400,,313,4.049180327868853

The 240 minute discussion covers the following topics: listening to our past, searching for our names, the promise of freedom, and beyond the middle passage.

8106373,5,B000E6EHNG,"This documentary derives from Skip Gates's TV series Finding your Roots. The difficulty of tracing the ancestry of African Americans is the spotty record-keeping of the statuses of slaves. Such gaps are partially mitigated by DNA testing, which has made possible discovery the approximate African locations and tribal identifications of the subjects' forebears, as well as their near-universal European lineage due to the rape of female slaves by their slave masters. The resilience of both the celebrities and their ancestors, who survived unconscionable and overwhelming abuse, is moving, humbling, and inspiring.",1424390400,,615,5.769230769230769
