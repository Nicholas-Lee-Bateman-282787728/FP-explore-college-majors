If you have health issues, Dr. Klappers straight forward message will teach you how to gain control over your health issues and get healed.",1497916800,,296,4.175438596491228

8491085,5,B0062CRK58,"Digestion Made Easy is a good basic knowledge resource to have!  It's well presented and applicable for making every day food choices.  Interesting.  Sharing it will give someone an ""aha""!",1374969600,4,188,5.2
8491086,5,B0062CRK58,"Informative yes.  This DVD lecture is a kind of overview of the human digestion system.  It covers without going into too much depth the workings of every function of the system such as esophagus, stomach, gall bladder, small intestine, liver, etc. There was a lot of information I was unaware of.  The only thing that I was hoping would be covered that wasn't is bacteria of the small intestine and its effects.",1360454400,11,412,4.694444444444445
8491087,5,B0062CRK58,"I am very impressed by this DVD.  It's pretty comprehensive and teaches you things about how what you eat and how you eat it can affect not just your body but your life.  This is the sort of material that should be in the primary, intermediate and secondary school curriculum. Most GP's (MD's) and dieticians should get a copy too, as there appear to be many who do not grasp the understanding of how what we eat, as I said before, can affect not just your body but your life.  Some doctors, dieticians and advertising agencies say there are no bad foods; we just need to eat everything in moderation.  This DVD proves that line to be a load of hokum.  Highly recommended.",1357948800,9,672,4.430894308943089
8491088,5,B0062CRK58,"This is new information. It's knownledge and understanding of a body's central function that's known by few laymen and, I suspect, few medical professionals. Armed with it, you can affect your health and strength and, if you pay attention, your weight and ability to fight chronic diseases that kill 2.5 million of us every year. Enjoy!",1350691200,9,336,5.017857142857143
8491089,5,B0062CRK58,"Digestion Made Easy is just that.  A lecture on our complex and amazing digestive system presented in a simple (though never simplistic) way.  I learned more about my digestive system (and my body) by investing just over an hour watching this DVD than I had learned my whole life.

This DVD should be required viewing for every human being.  It's like a manual for one of the most critical systems in our bodies.  And you'll also find clear explanations of, and easy-to-implement solutions to, a variety of common conditions, including heartburn, constipation, hemorrhoids, and even that embarrassing gas.  For just over 20 bucks, this is a steal!

You'll find information here that, unless you're a doctor with a lot of knowledge about nutrition, you would not otherwise have learned.  As Dr. Klaper points out, we are not what we eat, but what we absorb.  What's the difference and why is it important?  Watch the DVD and find out. . . .",1324425600,20,939,4.77639751552795
8491090,5,B0062CRK58,"""Digestion Made Easy""  is exactly that.  Finally it is explained in a way the average person can understand, and with this we can begin to see how what we eat affects our health and well being.  Dr. Klaper's expertise of anatomy and the bodies organs is amazing.  This dvd is an educational lecture on the complete digestive system.  Once we understand this, we can see how and where digestive problems originate and often take us down a road of ill health.  It is beautifully illustrated and Dr. Klaper's sense of humor keeps it light and fun.  I would highly recommend this dvd.",1324339200,15,580,4.627450980392157
