8038053,3,B000640XSY,"This dvd is way to short and that is one of the reason I rated it 3 stars. This dvd is only sixty minutes long and it has a basic plot line. This dvd looks as if it could be a good starting episode for a good series. Also, this dvd is only sub so if you like dub only probably you might want to stay away from this. If you like to see robots fighting then you would probably like this.
  The animation is beautiful but it doesn't have any extra content except for looking at character stils. All in all it is an alright anime, but I would suggest renting it if you can. If there were more episodes, I might suggest to watch the series.",1224892800,2,635,3.953125
