2823968,5,B000PISZ86,"I LOVED this season of Bewitched especially the Tabitha episodes like ""I Dont Want To Be A Toad"", ""Tabitha's Weekend"" & I loved the Serena episode of ""Mrs Stephens Where Are You"". Also LOVED ""Weep No More My Willow"" about Sam's willow tree! And Samantha's Shopping Spree is a funny one too with no Derwood included. This season was especially fun because there are a lot of NON Darrin episodes near the end of the season and they are more magical and no party poopers to mess up the fun like Derwood always did. I liked this season and season 4 the best....because they had some of the most fun and most magical episodes.  While a lot of the reviewers are sad that this was York's last season. I thought there were some good Sargent episodes too like their  Salem episodes in season 7. Not to mention the famous Jack & The Beanstalk  episode in season 6.  Sargent was a good Darrin though I do agree York was my favorite but really Derwood was not my favorite character any of the time. The only down side I can think of which is only a minor downer is this season does not feature any Aunt Clara episodes because the actress who portrayed her had passed away. But there are MORE Serena & Uncle Arthur fun this season which is good. I cant wait to have this season 5....its a good one....!!!",1182556800,7,1291,4.366666666666666
2823969,5,B000PISZ86,"Bewitched Season 5 -  Pre-order Release date July, 10, 2007

Bewitched Season 5 is a GREAT season and it will be the last season that Dick York will play the roll as Darrin Stephens. He will truly be missed after this season because he had such wonderful chemistry with Elizabeth Montgomery and more so I believe than Sargent. No offence to Dick Sargent because they both played good roles but I do feel that York had better chemistry and was quite funny to watch.

Aunt Clara (Marion Lorne) will sadly not be in this season or the rest of the seasons of Bewitched because she passed away from a sudden heart attack right before the filming of Bewitched Season 5. She will be surely missed!

I definitely recommend this season for any Bewitched fan!! There are many great shows on this set and Tabatha will have more show time as well. Another reviewer right before me has included a list of all the shows in this set so I decided not to duplicate it. I am buying this season because I am a big fan of the show and also to dedicate this set to Dick York because of his last appearances, I have not decided if I am going to purchase ""Bewitched Season 6-8"" yet because York will not appear but I may buy them to get a complete set.

Highly recommended!",1179014400,22,1250,4.347639484978541

Let's hope they give us some extras on this one; haven't seen too much of that since the release of the first season and there are some terrific documentaries on the cast and the show itself that could and should be issued at some stage. Enjoy!",1178409600,59,11860,4.681313375181072
2823971,5,B000PISZ86,This is the 5th season of the eight year series and the final for Dick York as he became ill while filming the series and he had missed a lot of episodes in this season so Elizabeth Montgomery had to react with somebody who usually with David White (Larry Tate) and even with herself when she became Serena her cousin.  the most memerable episode in this season for me is when Serena turned Darrin's mum into a cat as Phyllis was being very catty towards Sams family.  Another episode I liked is when she collected money for UNICEF where a person wouldn't pay it so she haunted him until he paid it.  So for all you Bewitched fans this is a must have.  So I definately give a  5 out of 5 for this season.  So I hope they will bring out the remainder of this series before this year is out.,1178236800,12,789,4.157894736842105
2823972,4,B000PISZ86,"Season 5 of Bewitched was a turning point for several reasons, which all add up to the series' decline.  But Season 5 has many enjoyable episodes and much going for it that makes this set a must-have for all fans of the series.

On the positive side, cousin Serena makes more appearances this season and establishes her character in her own right instead of just a double for Samantha.  Her best episode was ""Mrs. Stephens, Where Are You?"" where Serena turns Darrin's mother into a cat.  A classic episode!  Also, Tabitha has more lines and shows that Erin Murphy was truly a gifted child actor.  Her best eipisode was when she turned Amy into a butterfly.  She was also great when she turns herself into a raisin cookie.  Too bad she didn't do much more after Bewitched ended.  She would have been great on Little House on the Prairie or Eight is Enough at least as a guest star.  Other favorite episodes include ""Samantha Twitches for UNICEF"", and ""Samantha Goes South for a Spell"".  Dick York shines when Endora zaps a vanity spell on him, and ""aids"" him in speaking Spanish.  Social issues are also explored this season with ""The Battle of Burning Oak"" regarding racism and classism.  Truly hysterical the way that is approached.

However, on the down side, Aunt Clara is now gone with no explanation even though it was known that Marion Lorne had passed away, but no explanation about Aunt Clara.  Uncle Arthur is somewhat less lovable when he starts goofing up his spells.  Endora's dark side gets darker.  And the worst thing that happened which the series never recovered from, Dick York fell ill and had to leave the show before the season had ended.  This was truly tragic.  But if you can get past the downside, you can still enjoy Season 5 of Bewitched.  I plan to!!!",1177372800,14,1779,4.623003194888179

2823998,5,B000PISZ86,"Not only is BEWITCHED my favorite single-camera sitcom of all-time, its also my favorite TV show of the entire sensational 60s decade. When I first discovered the show in weekday afternoon reruns in 1975, the syndication cycle was in the second-half of Season 5 so these shows hold a particularly strong nostalgic grip on me.

Of course I purchased the original Sony release of these episodes back in the summer of 2007, but was so disappointed to discover that some of the prints were not restored and looked the same as though they were being rerun on a local UHF channel circa 1984 from the old Program Exchange syndication package. I purchased the recent Mill Creek re-release for a good price hoping the problems would be rectified, but alas, they are not.

Still, this remains my favorite season of the entire series with many memorable episodes including Weep No More My Willow, Samanthas Wedding Present, Cousin Serena Strikes Again Part 1, Samantha and Darrin in Mexico City.  This is the season in which Serena really came into her own and she remains one of my favorite characters on the show.

Despite the fact that Dick York was absent for much of the season, I found it refreshing that the Darrinless episodes allowed us a bigger look into witch life without the routine client stories or Endora cursing her son-in-law with her hex of the week. Mrs. Stephens, Where Are You, Tabithas Weekend, Samanthas Shopping Spree, Samanthas Power Failure all allow for lots of imaginative, fun and creative witchcraft scenes that remain highly entertaining in this modern age of CGI effects.

If nothing else, you need to watch these episodes to see how pitch-perfect the music cues were at this point in the series run. Just watch Tabithas Weekend to see what I mean.

The season-opener contains closing credits with Darrin riding along Sam on her broom and its too bad they were too lazy to reinsert the original Season 5 theme song/closing credits rather than the bland, standard Season 1 theme they always seem to use for the Dick York color episodes.

If you skipped on the Sony release, this one can be had for under $10 most places and IMO is one of the best collection of BEWITCHED episodes out of the 254 produced.",1434326400,3,2225,4.763636363636364

Love watching this with my kids, they enjoy it as much as I did as a kid in the 70's--the humor really is not dated and carries through because its not one-liner jokes, but done with a lot of heart and tender scenes mixed with the funny.  Just like in real life, so its relatable.  I have bought all the DVDs except the last season (I don't know whether I'll buy that one yet, several of the original characters were gone by the end and the boring ""social justice"" themes took over as well as silly episodes).  Season 5 highlights for us were funny Endora spells and some great Uncle Arthur episodes.  One episode had Endora casting a shrinking spell on Darrin, another spell made him extremely courteous to everyone, and another spell causes Darrin to become super conceited.  There's even some funnies for the Serena fans, especially where she tries a mortal dating service, predictably causing havoc, and she also turns Darrins client into a monkey.",1416096000,2,980,4.735294117647059

In the 2010+ time period, it seems a little dated. (No cel phones or computers in every house!) Despite all that, it has become a period piece full of good acting and writing based on a (mixed) supernatural family. Elizabeth Montgomery, Agnes Moorehead, Dick York (and Sergeant), David White, Irene Verson (and Kasey Rogers), Erin Murphy, Paul Lynde, Alice Ghostly, Alice Pearce (and Sandra Gould) and George Tobias are most of the stars who have made this show continue in re-reruns globally since the 1960's.",1402790400,,761,5.0476190476190474

2824045,4,B000PISZ86,"Well, I'm sure every Bewitched fan knows the story behind year 5 of the show; Dick York's final season as Darrin Stephens and he will be missed, although I have to say that Darrin wasn't as absent from as many episodes in Season 5 as I originally thought.

Out of 30 episodes, York is absent from 8, which isn't too bad I suppose. I just thought before buying this DVD collection that he was gone from a lot more episodes. And not to try & read too much into Mr. York's physical condition, but it strikes me that Darrin was looking a lot thinner this year than in the past. Again, maybe I'm reading too much into it knowing what happened to the poor guy.

In the last episode York actually filmed, ""Daddy Does His Thing,"" I remember reading an interview where Mr. York talked about his final day on the set & how he was doing a scene with Maurice Evans where he was suspended from wires & that was before he had the seizure that caused him to pass out & bow out from the show, so obviously there was supposed to be more to the storyline than Darrin being a jackass for the majority of the episode.

The fact that this very same premise from ""Daddy Does His Thing"" was redone in Season 6 with Dick Sargent as Darrin and was stretched out into a 2 part episode if I remember right proves my theory.

Another thing I might point out with this season is that the people at Sony didn't do quite as good a remastering job on some of these episodes compared to previous seasons. In particular, the episode ""Cousin Serena Strikes Again, Part 1"" looks very garish I think. Too much of an orange hue on the film and a number of spots throughout the episode look out of focus. I expected better from Sony in that regard.

It was also with Season 5 that the spelling of Erin Murphy's character was officially changed from ""Tabatha"" to ""Tabitha."" And a great Tabitha moment from the episode ""Cousin Serena Strikes Again, Part 2"" where Darrin tells Samantha to take Tabitha into the kitchen so he can talk to Serena alone & little Tabitha says ""I want to stay and hear you scream daddy.""

Overall, it's sad to see the original (and best) Darrin go, but that's not to say I'm not looking forward to season 6. Farewell Dick York, you were a great guy.",1389916800,4,2235,4.322195704057279

2824072,5,B000PISZ86,"The 1968-1969 season of ""Bewitched"" was a fantastic season. The show's fifth year continued to be excellent in terms of writing, directing, and acting, but there was trouble for the series, in the fact that Dick York started missing many episodes due to a back ailment. The shows he missed really effected the show, as the main story on ""Bewitched"" was the romance between Samantha and Darren. The producers tried to fill the void by putting supporting roles to the forefront, but it just didn't work.
 Some of the best episodes this year were aired early in the season. My personal favorite is ""Samantha Goes South For A Spell"", in which Samantha is sent back by 100 years to New Orleans by a witch. Isabel Sanford, from the ""Jeffersons"", makes an apperance here. Another great show is ""Darren Gone and Forgotten"", where Darren is held captive by a witch, played by Oscar winner Mercedes McCambridge, who wants her son with Samantha.
 This was really the last great season of ""Bewitched"" before the show ""jump the shark"". The series finished the year at #12 with a 23.3 Nielsen Rating, and it continued to flourish as one of ABC's higest rated shows.
 In the following season Dick Sargent would replace Dick York as Darren. Although a good new Darren, Sargent could never be as impeccable as York, and the audience couldn't forget Dick York in the role.

  At times,yes, it does get a little whimsical,but there are true comedy classics such as Endora turning Darrin into an obnoxious know it all,or having him tell the truth all the time (wasn't this idea used for a Jim Carey film?)

Another great season of wonderful characters, great storylines, and of course, Samantha & Darrin proving that no matter how different someone may be, it's love that makes ""all"" the difference!  Sadly, Season 5 is the final season for Dick York as the unsinkable and long suffering Darrin Stephens. However he's in top form throughout this season and always gives his best!  Episodes include:

1- Samantha's Wedding Present- Endora tries to make peace with Darrin, but ends up shrinking him down to size . . . gradually. Samantha tries to get her mother to return Darrin to his regular size, but not before a drunk finds the diminutive Darrin in a mayonnaise jar in the trash.

3- Samantha On The Keyboard- Endora gets Tabitha to play beautifully on the piano, and Darrin dares Samantha to learn how to play the mortal way. The Piano teacher hears Tabitha play and invites a famous conductor to see her play. Without magic, Tabitha does a poor job and the conductor is stunned. Samantha then finds a real prodigy for the conductor, and wins the bet with Darrin.

4- Darrin, Gone And Forgotten- Once upon a time, Endora made a deal with another witch Carlotta that Samantha will marry her son Juke, but Samantha hasn't lived up to her part of the deal. Now Carlotta and Juke are back and Carlotta will stop at nothing to give Juke what he wants. She makes Darrin disappear and never brings him back until Samantha agrees to marry Juke. Samantha tells Juke to finally stand up to his mother and tell her off.

5- It's So Nice To Have A Spouse Around The House- Serena is involved again. This time, Darrin takes her to the honeymoon spot where he and Samantha went. Samantha is at a Witches Council meeting and doesn't know what is going on. Darrin gets intimate with Serena, thinking that she is Samantha, and she tells him to back off. Then Tabitha is called to solve the puzzle.

6- Mirror, Mirror On The Wall- Endora turns Darrin into the most self-centered, conceited person on earth. He thinks that this will make him lose an account with a new client, but Samantha saves the day when she tells the client that they should zero in on the youth market.

7- Samantha's French Pastry- Uncle Arthur is supposed to make napoleons for dessert, but ends up bringing in Napoleon Bonaparte instead! Arthur cannot remember how to send him back and Larry wants to use Napoleon to advertise detergent. Unknowingly, Samantha says the right words and he disappears back to his own time.

8- Is It Magic or Imagination?- Mrs. Stephens drops in unexpectedly, and insists Samantha enter a slogan contest to win a trip to Tahiti. And she wins! Of course, Larry Tate's none to happy as it turns out to be one of their biggest clients. The typical Stephens fight occurs. Darrin's furious! He thinks Samantha used witchcraft. Darrin heads to the neighborhood bar, gets drunk, and tells the he's married to a witch. Darrin comes around when Samantha's slogan is rejected after all.

9- Samantha Fights City Hall- Samantha gets involved in a fight against tearing down a neighborhood park for a supermarket. The bad news is that the park is owned by Darrin's new client, Mr. Mossler, and because of her involvement, Darrin ends up losing his job. Samantha saves the day when she brings one of the statues in the park to life to convince Mossler to stop with the construction.

10- Samantha Loses Her Voice- As a joke, Uncle Arthur switches Samantha and Darrin's voices, and they try to keep a depressed Louise and Larry from finding out.

When the teacher groups the children in animal groups, Amy gets chosen to be a toad in the toad group, but she wants to be in a butterfly group. Tabitha misunderstands her request and actually turns her into a butterfly! Samantha, who has been watching the whole thing through the window, chases Amy the butterfly all around the city and catches her so Tabitha can change her back.

12- Weep No More My Willow-  Samantha wants to keep a willow tree in her yard and decides to treat it. She calls Dr. Bombay to make her tree weep, but Samantha gets caught in the spell and each time the wind blows, she starts crying. When Larry hears her cry, he thinks that she and Darrin are having a fight and comes over to comfort her, but not before Dr. Bombay comes by to give her an antidote to make her laugh. When Larry comes by, Samantha starts laughing and laughing, and Larry starts laughing too. Then Darrin comes in to find Samantha and Larry laughing for no apparent reason. Then Dr. Bombay comes by with another antidote to make everything and everyone normal again.

13- Instant Courtesy- Darrin is turned into the most nicest person in the world by Endora and gets a tough client named Mrs. Sebastian to sign with McMann and Tate.

Never has there been a more beloved TV series than the magical and lovable ""Bewitched!""  I look forward to adding the additional seasons sets 6, 7, and 8 to my TV-DVD collection of ""Bewitched,"" for no matter how many times I watch any of the 8 season episodes, it always surprises me how much I enjoy this show and it's stars, for they've become like family over the years and they will always be ""immortal.""",1207526400,2,11631,4.636849781234808

Love the Bewitched Series!  Can't wait for Season six to come out!",1207440000,,256,11.142857142857142
2824086,3,B000PISZ86,"In contrast to the stunning, superb Fourth Season, which represented ""BEWITCHED"" at its creative apex, the somewhat shaky Fifth Season reveals the beloved Series in a state of transition.
  Marion Lorne, who played the adorably confused Aunt Clara,  died near the end of Season Four. She is terribly missed. In her absence, Uncle Arthur (Paul Lynde) screws up a spell in ""Samantha's French Pastry."" Instead of producing a dessert, Napoleon materializes instead-- and ""Laugh In's"" Henry Gibson makes a wonderful guest appearance. Gibson would return as a mischievous leprechaun in the Season Six episode ""If The Shoe Fits.""
  In an especially hilarious episode titled ""Samantha Loses Her Voice"" (which I watched three times in two days), Uncle Arthur switches Samantha and Darrin's voices-- and practically causes Louise Tate (Kasey Rogers) to have a nervous breakdown.
 Marion Lorne is missed, but Dick York's absences due to severe back pain and illness began to create SERIOUS production problems in Season Five. York missed a few episodes in Seasons  3 and 4. He missed a record of 9 episodes out of the total 30 for Season 5. York's absences here threw the Series' Premise, an enchanting romantic comedy,  off balance. Ironically, York gave some of his best performances as Darrin in Season 5.
  In ""Samantha Goes South For A Spell,"" Darrin is transported back to 1868 New Orleans to rescue Samantha from the curse of a vengeful witch. York is also superb when Endora (Agnes Moorehead) zaps a ""Vanity"" Spell on Darrin in the episode ""Mirror, Mirror, On The Wall."" Darrin becomes unbearably self-obsessed  and appears in a serious of ""Hippie"" outfits. The somewhat spooky episode ""Samantha The Sculptress"" features talking clay heads of Darrin and his boss Larry Tate (David White).
  Elizabeth Montgomery has a grand time playing Cousin Serena. In ""Marriage, Witches Style,"" Serena tries computer dating because she wants to marry a mortal, too. The outcome is predictable, but hilarious fun, nevertheless. However, with York's Darrin gone for much of this Season, the writers had a difficult time coming up with fresh story ideas. Samantha turns a chimp into a man for an episode. In another, the angry Witches Council strips Serena and Uncle Arthur of their magical powers because they have sided with Samantha once too often. They are consequently forced to get jobs like mere mortals--and end up getting into a fight with frozen, chocolate covered bananas-- a tired gag recycled from ""I Love Lucy.""
  Dick Sargent was brought in as an emergency replacement for Dick York. Sargent had auditioned with Elizabeth Montgomery for ""Bewitched"" back in 1963, but was unable to accept the role at that time due to previous contractual commitments. While it is extremely sad that Dick York was too ill and physically unable to continue, I urge all ""Bewitched"" ""fans"" who are still engaged in the endless and pointless ""Debate Over Two Darrins""  to relax, enjoy the series, and appreciate what both Dick York AND Dick Sargent brought to the role of Darrin.
  Amazon.com has announced that ""BEWITCHED: THE COMPLETE SIXTH SEASON"" DVD Set, with Dick Sargent installed as Darrin, will FINALLY be released on May 6, 2008-- AND IT'S ABOUT TIME, TOO!",1205020800,2,3240,5.0926275992438566

2824088,5,B000PISZ86,"The fifth season of ""Bewitched"" is a delight.  It does not come with added DVD extras like the first season, but the show itself is well worth adding to your collection.  While it cannot be helped because of her death, Marion Lorne's character Aunt Clara is gone and missed.  From the first disc, one of my favorite episodes is ""It's So Nice to Have a Spouse.""  Samantha is summoned to the witches' council which results in Darrin mistakenly taking Serena to a romantic resort to put some spice back in the marriage.  Watching Serena stew as she tries hard to escape Darrin's embraces is hysterical.  Elizabeth Montgomery does a great job playing these two very opposite characters.  ""I Don't Want to Be a Toad, I Want to Be a Butterfly"" from the second disc is an excellent episode that puts Erin Murphy's Tabatha in the spotlight.  Darrin's mother insists Tabatha join nursery school, which results in Tabatha turning another little girl into a butterfly and the sends the schoolmistress to a nervous breakdown.  It's a hilarious episode.  ""Marriage, Witches' Style"" on the third disc is another wild show as Serena decides to try computer dating.  Unfortunately, the computer matches her to a warlock with zany consequences.  Disc four has several excellent episodes.  ""The Battle of Burning Oak"" pits Samantha against phonies at a country club.  She uses witchcraft to reveal that even arrogant wealthy snobs can have hidden cobwebs in their closets.  ""Samantha's Power Failure"" also shows Samantha fighting for justice as she is stripped of her powers and fights for her right to be married to Darrin, the mortal she loves.  Dick York's last episode, ""Samantha & Darrin in Mexico City"" is excellent as Samantha's twitch overcomes language barriers.  York turns in one of his most excellent comic performances.  While the season evolves the show, the fifth season is still a complete delight.  Enjoy!",1202428800,,1904,4.987301587301587

2824090,4,B000PISZ86,"The fifth season of BEWITCHED was the final with Dick York, the original Darrin.  Chronic back pain had finally begun to take it's toll on the actor, who found it difficult to perform without the aid of painkillers.  Many of the episodes have Darrin ""out of town on business"" or ""stuck in the office"", with Samantha and her wacky cousin Serena at the forefront for most of the storylines.

The passing of Marion Lorne, who played befuddled Aunt Clara, also impacted the show heavily.  Writers brought back Alice Ghostley with the new character of absent-minded Esmeralda in Season Six (Ghostley originally played hapless housekeeper Naomi in a Season Two episode, ""Maid to Order"").

What I love about Season Five is the amount of episodes with my favourite character, Serena.  Elizabeth Montgomery relished the chance of cutting loose as Samantha's zany cousin; and all of the episodes in which she features are a delight.  With little Tabitha quickly growing up--and mastering her powers--Samantha has lots of trouble concealing her abilities, especially in front of Darrin's meddling mother!

2824091,3,B000PISZ86,"This is the last series in which Dick York portrayed Darren Stevens.  He does not appear in many episodes which is disappointing but given the health problems caused by his back pain and reliance on painkillers, it is evident that he could not continue working in a demanding TV series.  Dick York's comic abilities certainly were an essential element of the program's success - Dick Sargent never came close to his talent and being known as the ""second Darren Stevens"" has come to be equated with always being even less than second best.  The series relies heavily on appearances by other members of Samantha's and Darren's family, the most notable being Paul Lynde's hilarious portrayal of Uncle Arthur and Mabel Albertson as Darren's highly strung mother. The series is watchable and has some very funny moments but it is not up to standard of the first three series.",1191801600,5,870,4.864864864864865

2824093,3,B000PISZ86,"I've always enjoyed Bewitched as a kid and now as an adult, but here you can see the quality of the show is really starting a downturn. Dick York's frequent absences hinder the season from shining as bright as the previous ones. You just flinch whenever he is required to do a fall or a trip, knowing what back problems he was going through. Character development seems to have to come to a full halt as we see Endora simply going through a formula of ""pop in, insult Darrin, cast a spell, leave for awhile, then come back near the end to remove the spell."" We do get to see more of Serena (including one episode where Uncle Arthur and her do the ""candy assembly line"" bit from ""I Love Lucy"" almost verbatim, but with frozen banana pops) and that allows Elizabeth Montgomery to stretch from being the same old Sam, who lately either fights with Darrin or Endora or both!  The charming Maurice Evans pops in for two episodes, although one of them is the last show Dick York worked on, before having to quit the show over his medical problems.  It's a shame that Sony is still too lazy to give us fans any bonuses or even the original theme song restored for this season.

Worth every penny.  Can never get enough of this program.  It just takes you back to a simpler time.  Only bad thing - not too much Darrin.  His health issues finally led to his leaving the show.  Looking forward to season 6 and finally 7.  Complaints - only that we have to wait too long in between releases. If you're a fan - don't hesitate to buy the series - especailly the early seasons.

Dick York missed a total of 8 times in this season due to his ongoing back pain, but we got to see more of Cousin Serena and Uncle Arthur.
