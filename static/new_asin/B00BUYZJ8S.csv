8574420,5,B00BUYZJ8S,"Jurgen Ohlsen, in his second and final screen role, stars alongside Ernst Udet, future Luftwaffe Inspector General, WW1 ace and an actor in a number of Riefenstahl 'mountain' films .Sadly, Udet committed suicide in 1941 due to the pressures of his job.

The plot of this 1935 film is fairly mundane. Young Muthesius befriends Udet and becomes, more or less, his protg. Muthesius enrols in the German glider movement, precursor to the Luftwaffe, and is soon participating in gliding activities despite the concerns of his mother. What makes this film, however, is the stunning aerial photography, courtesy of Hans Schneeberger, and the fantastic musical score of Giuseppe Becce. Udet's stunts [he was also a real life stunt pilot; many air aces during the inter war years, all over the world, resorted to such employment to earn a living] are quite scary, especially his flight under a bridge which is depicted in a dream sequence.

There are some fascinating scenes of the inside of Udet's Berlin apartment. Udet shows Muthesius his extensive collection of memorabilia. Pictures of Hermann Goering, Richtofen and Boelke [ mistranslated as 'Volke' in the subtitles] adorn the wall of what is essentially an Aladdin's cave of trophies, medals, airplane remains and old photographs. He was quite a collector!

As regards print quality,it's very good. There are a couple of age related anomalies but no worse than can be found on other DVD copies of films of the period. It's a typical 'Sunday afternoon' film; not too demanding and a pleasure to watch. With it's musical score and stunning scenery, it's a must for anybody interested in aviation or films of this period.",1400025600,3,1667,5.054545454545455
