8401706,5,B003OTNOZM,I really loved this movie and Celeste Kellogg she is a very talented singer and a great actress in this movie.,1396569600,,110,4.285714285714286
8401707,1,B003OTNOZM,"Very typical Christian-made mix of Diary of a Wimpy Kid meets High School Musical. The acting is what is expect from a church production, and my kids (the target age group) thought it was hokey and poorly made.  Nothing original nor realistic (a teacher dragging kids by the ear to the principal?? Not likely). Much better stuff out there from Disney. I had a lot better discussion with my girls from Cyber Bully. I wish Christians would set the bar higher.",1365292800,,457,4.6419753086419755
8401708,5,B003OTNOZM,The movie came in plenty of time even thought ordered close to Christmas. Not having heard of the movie before we weren't sure what to expect but it was great! The kids loved it!,1356652800,,178,4.264705882352941
8401709,2,B003OTNOZM,"These kids are limited, and so is the video:  it suffers from the same problem many Christian-themed videos have, which is a lack of talent on the screen.  The acting is fine for a church pageant, but not so much for a mass-marketed video.  Veteran actor Bill Cobbs is an obvious talent, but no one else in the film can match him, or even comes close.

The direction is limited as well, with most shots focusing on just one actor at a time, no creative approaches, very basic shots.  The lighting is also often poor.  This is a very low-budget film.

For all that, the story itself is reasonable, and quite old-fashioned:  I was reminded of the old Mickey Rooney/Judy Garland movies where the kids decided to ""put on a show!""  The plot and situations come out fine.  And there's nothing especially wrong with the film.  You just shouldn't buy it expecting a big-budget picture out of Hollywood.",1307318400,2,894,4.594936708860759
8401710,5,B003OTNOZM,"Your first day at middle school can be a very stressful experience. It's hard to find movies that portray this age group correctly while being appropriate for the entire family. I really enjoyed No Limit Kids because it sends a positive message to new teens. If you ask me, middle school is the hardest time in a kids life and it's nice to watch a movie that shows kids how to embrace this time. No LImit Kids would make a great gift for the holidays.",1292371200,,451,4.317647058823529
8401711,5,B003OTNOZM,"No Limit Kids: Much Ado about Middle School is a great DVD. I was captured right from the start and was entertained all the way through. No Limit Kids: Much Ado about Middle School is about a group of outcast middle school students, whom become friends and want to save a old theater from being destroyed.
Going to a new school is always hard, but when you have personal problems in the home or are not one of the popular students it can be worse. It will bring back memories for the adults of there middle school years. It also will give future middle schoolers the confidence that they will do well and have lots of fun in school.
This DVD not only will be loved by the young, but also adults will find it very entertaining and helpful with their own children.
Celeste Kellogg and Ashton Harrell are very talented young people. They sing many songs on the DVD that are magnificent. Both of these young people have been on many other shows, movies and concerts. It is great to see young people who are not afraid to show others that you don't need to have sex in your movies or songs. No Limit Kids: Much Ado about Middle School is well put together and has outstanding actors and actresses.
This DVD is highly recommended by Dove Foundation for being suitable for all ages. I also highly recommend this DVD, for family viewing and lots of fun entertainment.

This DVD was given to me from Katie at Propeller Pure Flix Entertainment for viewing and reviewing purposes",1283731200,4,1468,4.49812734082397
