7982340,4,B00008EYBD,"The VHS tape listed on this page is the older Columbia Tristar release. For a better quality tape, check the other listing of 'Alone in the Dark' for the New Line/Turner Home Entertainment release. I have both tapes and the New Line/Turner tape has better contrast and a brighter picture than the Columbia Tristar tape. Please be advised that you may want to check with the seller to verify which tape they have. If they list it as an ex-rental, then it is most likely the Columbia Tristar tape. A BRIEF SYNOPSIS: 'Alone in the Dark' stars Jack Palance (City Slickers), Martin Landau (Ed Wood, Mission Impossible), Donald Pleasence (Halloween 1,2,4,5,6), Dwight Schultz (A-Team's Murdock), and Erland Van Lidth (uhh...this movie). This is an entertaining movie which deviates from the standard slasher fare. Four patients at a sanitarium are convinced that their new doctor has killed their previous doctor, Harry Merton, and they must exact revenge on the new doctor. Since they are locked up in a sanitarium behind doors with electric locks, this would appear to be a problem, until one night: blackout. Four escaped mental patients are on the loose and a family finds themselves isolated, trapped, and alone in the dark.-Bob",1099785600,3,1227,5.019607843137255
