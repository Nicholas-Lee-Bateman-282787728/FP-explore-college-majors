All I can say is that all of the reviews were spot on..  And the ending was just flat out illogical and dumb.  You cannot cut up everybody into body parts.. without having at least one survivor.  If you like murder and mahem try an episode of Dexter.  DO NOT GO TO THE EXPENSE OF BUYING OR EVEN RENTING THIS DVD.  You will be waisting your time.  This will be especially true if you watch it..  as I hate to admit that I did.",1347321600,,582,4.035087719298246
8310308,2,B000G8NXPU,"When you have only one real suspect, it is easy to figure out the killer. Rule of thumb...If you are going to cast people who can't act, cast women with lots of cleavage. Dumb males have deep pockets.

They get to the island for a Survival reunion and find the hut is trashed, a warning ""You will all die"" written on the wall and the water is poisoned. So they opt to spend the night there instead of on the yacht that brought them. So the next morning, the boat is gone! So rather than stay together as a group, they all split off into couples and wander around the island into Rambo style traps. Meanwhile there are remote cameras all around the island filming everything (where did he get those batteries?).

It is a yawn from start to finish. No real gore. No nudity, but with all the plot and acting of a ""B"" porno movie.",1276473600,2,826,4.254777070063694
8310309,1,B000G8NXPU,"I just finished watching Safety In Numbers and I was MAJORLY disapointed. First thing me and my sister noticed was the camera angles were bad. I'm not just being nit-picky, the camera angles were at times quite literally sickening. Second, the characters weren't that well built up. They were introduced without really introducing them. For example, one of the girls was introduced and I only learned her name by watching the special features. Lastly of all, the ending. If you've seen the movie then that's a nuf said moment, but for those of you that haven't I'll go into detail. A tree stump could write a better ending and I honestly believe that. On the plus side, it had lots of offensive language which we found EXTREMELY amusing. I think that prolly makes me a inmature person but whatever. Don't watch this movie cause it isn't worth it.",1186704000,6,846,4.722972972972973
8310310,1,B000G8NXPU,"Too bad Amazon doesn't allow a rating of zero for movies because this one certainly deserves it.  The only good part of the entire movie is the ending--meaning when I took the DVD out of my player and put the disk in the trash.  Folks, avoid this one at all costs!!!  Between a poor script, grainy film, terrible set and bad acting, you'd be better off spending your money and time doing almost anything else.  Don't waist your time or money on this one.",1163980800,5,454,4.369047619047619
