Why does no official U.S. release exist as of December 2015? Distribution disputes going back decades compounded further by the high cost of having to also license the soundtrack.

A quick primer for those unfamiliar with the Macross universe: the original Macross anime series (1982) was a huge hit, leading to an adaptation rebranded as Robotech for American audiences. The story's unique combination of love triangles, science fiction, and catchy songs helped Macross stand apart from generic mecha anime. Over the last three decades, Macross has spawned spawn multiple television series, movies, and video games.

This particular anime television series, Macross Frontier, is set in the far future of the original series. Although it gives plenty of nods to the past, Macross Frontier can be watched as a stand-alone series.

The new Macross colonies have been folding through space in search of a new home planet. The ostensible goal? To ensure humanity's survival. Unfortunately, humankind still cannot avoid its penchant for war. Fighter pilot Alto finds himself swept up in the conflict and torn between two women pivotal to the war effort.

It's probably unfair to compare Macross Frontier to the strongest Macross productions, but perhaps it's also unavoidable. Macross Frontier does succeed in both portraying the epic scope of the original television series while meeting the production standards of the Macross Plus movie. This series at its best offers beautifully drawn vistas of space and breathtaking city landscapes. The detailed CGI used for dogfights makes it easy to forget how impressive it is that everything was done on a television budget.

Still, the series displays unevenness. The animation quality jumps jarringly at times, moving from sloppy shortcuts to the highest quality character illustrations. The story pacing hopped all over the place as the series found difficulty tying the romantic threads into the wider conflict.

This unevenness carried over to character development. Though the female characters are strong, the protagonist, Alto, is unsuited for the role of leading man; he is a person who prefers to be carried by the wind, but that doesn't make for a very captivating hero. I laughed when later on in the series he was almost completely missing from the opening credits--because as far as I could tell, that's where the series was headed. I was confused as to why the pop star Sheryl wasn't made the main character if she was going to be developed more than everybody else.

While we're on the subject of pop idols, no discussion of a Macross series would be complete without a review of its songs. It has been too long since we have been gifted an anime soundtrack this good. Macross Frontier eventually released no fewer than six albums, selling nearly a million discs and revitalizing anime music sales in Japan. The series even dared to take on the song that started it all: ""Do You Remember Love?"" Yes, Macross Frontier delivers a new rendition of this classic Lynn Minmay song...and it is worthy! Perusing the credits, I recognized household names in anime like Yoko Kanno and Maaya Sakamoto along with J-Pop singers May'n and Megumi Nakajima--it was clear that no expense was spared. The music of these women saved the series, and I rate the soundtrack a 5 out of 5 without reservation.

Macross Frontier's strengths lie in its technical production and its music, but its weaknesses all stem from lackluster writing. After a strong first episode, the show suffers from meandering plotlines throughout. Battles occur randomly and have no personal stakes. The total effect on me was indifference. Often, I had no idea where the story was headed and why it mattered. Anime tropes were overused; for example, I groaned when all the major characters conveniently ended up attending the same school. The major reversals in the story are too safe to be exciting. Perhaps I wanted Macross Frontier to be something that it was never intended to be; in retrospect, it seems like a series intended to bring younger audiences into the Macross universe.

In that context, and taking into account its music, Macross Frontier is worth a casual viewing. I recommend this series to old fans looking for nostalgia and to teens wanting something light and fun to watch.",1450742400,3,4537,5.030625832223702
