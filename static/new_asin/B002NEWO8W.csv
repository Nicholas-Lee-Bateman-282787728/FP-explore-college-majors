3959228,4,B002NEWO8W,"Arrived in excellent condition,and my copy of beggars of life was easy to see, not kino quality, but not dark. And being a hard to find film,it was worth it. I wish this film would be restored because it is an excellent film, Wallace Berry does a great job, and of coarse Louise Brooks and the other actors also, I loved the film,thanks for making this available,and hope kino will restore it someday.",1334188800,4,401,4.506849315068493
3959229,4,B002NEWO8W,"Not great films, but both movies give a hint of the glory to come with ""It"" in 1927. Watching her act while everyone around her overacts is a treat. The restorations are not great, but they're watchable.",1332892800,9,203,4.513513513513513
3959230,4,B002NEWO8W,".....Well considering everything that is.  The DVD I got is a DVD+R with the film on it.  It played fine on my DVD player.  However, I ripped in into the hard disk and will Xvid encode it into an MKV video container.  The disc and case are in excellent shape.  The 'artwork' is nice.  I believe it is a small time business operation where the video is burned into a DVD+R disc.  Better than nothing.  A reviewer for another disc in this Louise Brooks series believes that the movies are pirated.  I do not think so.  The operation is legit.  But how many people would buy these except geeks like us who are into silent movies in 2011 :)  So I am thankful we have a seller selling these.
Beggars of Life is a beautiful movie.  I gave this transaction 4 stars because the quality can be better, and I wish, OH I WISH, this movie can be restored and HD remastered like Pandora's Box.  I truly do not know what would go into such an endeavor, but I know it is worth it.  I for one will be getting the rest of DVD's in the Louise Brooks series.  I hope they will be all as physically clean as this one.",1297123200,12,1097,4.127962085308057
3959231,3,B002NEWO8W,"Clara Bow is delightful in Mantrap (1926), one of her best films.
Her charisma and energy jump off the screen.
Also included is Dancing Mothers (1926), in which she was billed third,
but stole the picture from Alice Joyce.
Mantrap is directed by Victor Fleming (The Wizard of Oz, Gone with the Wind).
He was Clara's lover at the time of Mantrap.
I give the DVD 3 stars, as it is from a rough print,
but 5 stars for historic value. At least we have her films!
Highly recommended, for film buffs only.
Also highly recommended is David Stenn's biography of Clara Bow, Runnin' Wild.

3959232,3,B002NEWO8W,"This DVD contains one gem: The Saturday Night Kid (1929).
Clara Bow's third talkie. Her Brooklyn accent is not as harsh as expected, in fact, quite acceptable. There is no evidence of her microphone anxiety.
The sound recording is good, judging by the husky voice of Jean Arthur.
This is a fascinating film, because it features three famous actresses at different stages of their careers. Clara Bow, near the end of hers, a bit overweight. Jean Arthur, early in hers, but you can see she is going to be a star. Watch for Jean Harlow, as Pearl, with one line. You won't recognise her, because of the cloche hat, but listen carefully for the Harlow voice.
I can only give this DVD 3 stars, because of the poor transfer, from a VHS tape, of a poor print, but that's no reason not to buy it. I give it 5 stars for historic value.
The DVD also includes Kid Boots (1926) Silent, mostly Eddie Cantor, not much Clara.
Also Clara singing and dancing in a 1930 Paramount on Parade.
Highly recommended, for film buffs only.
Also highly recommended is David Stenn's biography of Clara Bow, Runnin' Wild.

3959233,5,B002NEWO8W,"The DVDs in the ""Rare Films of..."" series issued by Classic Video Streams are not of the highest quality. The case often arrives damaged and the art design is so basic that the names of the films do not feature on either the cover or the spine. (The titles are included on the back of the case, but almost as an afterthought). The disk does not have chapter selection or any extras features, and although you can select which of the two films to watch, the second film will always follow the first automatically. It is all very primitive. The films have not been remastered and are of very mixed quality; the musical sound tracks often seem to be any old classical piece chosen at random. To make matters worse, the DVD are inclined to be defective and unplayable. Fortunately, Amazon's hassle-free return policy means this last problem can easily be rectified by exchanging faulty DVDs for playable ones, providing you are willing to wait an extra week or so.
Why would I give such a product Five Stars? The simple answer is that these rare silent films are for the most part available nowhere else. ""Beggars of Life"" (1928), arguably Louise Brooks' best American film, is the one where she murders her abusive stepfather and flees dresses as a boy into the hobo underworld of 1920s America (or at least as visualized by Hollywood). It is the only film in the ""Rare Films of..."" series in which Louise has a starring role, as opposed to a bit part, even though the movie really belongs to Wallace Beery as the Oklahoma Red. The second feature is a short excerpt from an interview with Louise made in the 1970s, where she talks about the great Clara Bow (who is represented in this series by only a single video, albeit with two of her better films).
Until Kino or Criterion release a superior, high-definition, restored version of ""Beggars of Life"" with an original score, this one issued by Classic Video Streams will have to do. Meanwhile, they get five stars just for making these great old films available once again.",1283299200,25,2022,4.650837988826815
3959234,1,B002NEWO8W,"Movie would be of interest but dvd came scuffed with scratches and fingerprints on it.
It has very poor production values - I have other films from this era none of so poor quality.
There is no excuse for sending a dvd with fingerprints and scratches - never got to see it all as it stopped playing.

Seller should be ashamed to send such a poor quality product",1269993600,11,361,4.3088235294117645
8374993,4,B002NEWO8W,"Clara Bow was a late arriving phenomenon in silent films.  She had a lot of vitality and personality.  Her films are definitely worth watching.  These films have not been restored, their quality is poor.",1438214400,,203,4.911764705882353
8374994,4,B002NEWO8W,"Good one for Clara Bow fans like me. It includes 2 of her early Preferred Pictures films and one of her late silent Paramount formula films including a thin story and bland cast except for Clara who carries the whole picture and makes you glad you saw it. Despite disappointing quality especially in the two early films this one's a winner!
Oops! This is my review for Volume 2! Its getting late! I'll come back and write one for this pair.",1437696000,,440,4.444444444444445

8374997,4,B002NEWO8W,"The films aren't in perfect quality, which is fine because we are lucky to have any sort of film at all. However the DVD box is not well put together and the DVD is labeled for Mary Pickford (though it does play the right films)",1417996800,2,228,4.088888888888889
8374998,3,B002NEWO8W,"The first movie, a talkie, was OK, the acting, with funny scenes at times, was a bit ruff.  The story plot was a bit weak at the end. The second movie, a silent film, was very funny all the way, even though it followed  the usual plot of many silent films.  I really like Clara as an actress in her silent films. She is cute, and very effective in the roles she plays",1396742400,4,367,4.0

Well, don't hold your breath. If you desire wonderful crisp transfers go order the new Hollywood crapola. You want to see film history, order this.",1377734400,6,324,5.018518518518518
