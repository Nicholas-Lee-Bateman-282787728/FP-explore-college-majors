8314255,5,B001K3JS6S,"This film is a light and entertaining take on the effect of Howard Stern's move to satellite radio. It is filled with inside jokes so Howard Stern fans will get a real kick out of it. (Non-fans can still enjoy it as there is no nudity or outwardly lewd remarks; unlike Stern's actual show).

I noticed in the credits that Howard Stern regular Billy Mira does his dead-on David Lee Roth voice for the film. Very nice touch.

In conclusion, if you're a Howard Stern fan, you might want to pick this up as a potential collector's item. If you have a friend who's a fan this might be a good gift.",1228348800,,592,4.276785714285714
