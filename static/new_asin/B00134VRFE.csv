8249175,1,B00134VRFE,"Sorry to say that I actually hated ~ yes, hated ~ this DVD.  We already had two other Hermie DVDs which I and my grandchildren like very much ~ ""Common Caterpillar"" and ""Stanley the Stinkbug"".  Those two are beautifully made and have a good story.  I found everything about ""Grumble Bees"" extremely unpleasant.  As far as the artwork goes, it is predominated by the icky maize-y yellow and black of the bees...  This DVD lacks the beautiful colors and artwork of our previous Hermie DVDs.  For my personal taste, Buzby/Elvis is just YUCKY to look at and to listen to, (I'm not a fan of Elvis, or of his impersonators).  The two ""Grumble Bees"" and their horrible behavior and totally non appealing to the (my) eyes looks had no redeeming qualities.  Their horrible voices/attitude took up waaay to much of my time.  I watched this DVD once, and promptly stuck it in a bag to go to Goodwill.  :(",1313539200,,893,4.559748427672956
