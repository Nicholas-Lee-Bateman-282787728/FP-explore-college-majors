8141590,1,B000HWY60Q,"I was a little disappointed when I received this video.  I tried it in 3 different dvd players and all of them said it was an unreadable disk with errors.  I simply returned the video and didn't ask for a replacement since I also had purchased other potty training videos.  I was excited about this one since it was geared toward girls, but I was completely shocked about it's outcome.  The disk appeared to be new and didn't have any scratches on it, but it was packaged in a disk cover like you get with music CD's.  I know that shouldn't matter on quality, but the first thing I though even before I knew it didn't play was it was going to be cheap... maybe that was the problem.  I would love to hear from anyone who has this product... if it's worth it I might try to reorder in hopes it's a good disk.",1179273600,,807,4.174193548387096

8141592,1,B000HWY60Q,It was useless. It was not compatable with my DVD player. Or my computer. This has happened before with DVD's I purchased from Amazon.,1173312000,3,134,4.625
