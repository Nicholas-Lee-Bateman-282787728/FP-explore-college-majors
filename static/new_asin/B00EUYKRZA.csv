5944847,5,B00EUYKRZA,This is a rich collection of Christopher Nolan. I like each movie of them since I am a big fan of Christopher Nolan after watching Inception. the special features are quite a lot too. I can learn from the making of and those narration. But still one thing could be better and that is the box package. Can you find somebody to design this box set?,1421020800,,346,4.257575757575758

5944850,1,B00EUYKRZA,"This is made by money grubbing little... I mean my word! I got the last collection last year. Had I known they'd release THIS I would have waited. What on earth? I mean, they release a collection a month or two before the release of the Dark Knight, and everyone thinks that's annoying. Then when tons have already BOUGHT that edition, they come out with... THIS. I'm not purchasing it. Horrible people...",1381190400,3,405,4.638888888888889
5944851,1,B00EUYKRZA,"Basically this is a rerelease of an okay set, so they could add The Dark Knight Rises. It still doesn't contain one of Nolan's best: The Prestige. I'm not shelling out 45 bucks for a rehash of an okay set that is crucially missing The Prestige.",1380412800,7,244,4.326086956521739
5944852,4,B00EUYKRZA,"If you don't own any of director Christopher Nolan's films on blu-ray, then this would be the perfect box set for you.  But if you're a long-time fan of Nolan's work, then I'd guess you probably own most or all of his films already... if that's the case then there's really no good reason to spend more money on this set.

This set includes 6 Movies:
- Memento
- Insomnia
- Batman Begins
- The Dark Knight
- Inception
- The Dark Knight Rises

What's missing:
- The Prestige -->&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Prestige-Blu-ray/dp/B000L212HC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Prestige [Blu-ray</a>]

*******

This is a re-release of the 2012 Nolan Collection set...&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Christopher-Nolan-Director-s-Collection-Memento-Insomnia-Batman-Begins-The-Dark-Knight-Inception-Blu-ray/dp/B0085D3I3K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Christopher Nolan Director's Collection (Memento / Insomnia / Batman Begins / The Dark Knight / Inception) [Blu-ray</a>].  The only difference is the inclusion of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" (which was not available on blu-ray at the time of the first set's release).

It seems as though Warner Bros. didn't put much additional effort into this re-release.  They could have at least differentiated the box art or put new extras inside; or how about improved video transfers or some more special features on the discs?

Most importantly, the set is still missing two Nolan movies - ""Following"" and ""The Prestige"".  Now, I understand that other studios own the home video rights to those two films, but multiple studios have worked out licensing deals on box sets before (for example the Kubrick box set).

If you're primarily a Batman fan and aren't as interested in the other films, then this set might be a better choice -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dark-Knight-Trilogy-Ultimate-Collector-s-Edition-Blu-ray/dp/B00DUCXFUC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dark Knight Trilogy: Ultimate Collector's Edition [Blu-ray</a>].  Not only does the Dark Knight Trilogy collector's set have a better design, but it also includes a bonus disc with brand new special features.",1378512000,12,2457,6.96742671009772
5944853,2,B00EUYKRZA,"Call me crazy, but Chris Nolan's collection of films stand out in an era of reboots, prequels, and the occasional money grab (looking at you, Finding Dory.) This 'Hollywood Dryspell', seems to have found an answer in Mr. Nolan. The young director, who specializes in artistry, practical effects, extraordinary storytelling, and all around riveting drama will surly rank among histories greatest directors. However, it could be said that this man would never have made the neo-noir roller coaster ""Memento"" if he had a daughter like mine. My Blu-ray player has been missing for WEEKS, and I'm confident that my daughter has it at her dorm at U of M. Unlike the finale act of the Prestige (Spoiler alert), there's no great mystery as to the who stole my Blu-Ray player. It was Denice. And if not her, one of her friends. I've been meaning to watch this Director's Collection for quite some time now. The packaging is superb, and the choices of movies are excellent, as befits the Auteur. However, much like Heath Ledger's masterful portrayal of the Clown Prince of Crime (RIP), my daughter has unleashed chaos into my life.
As a huge fan, I'd love to say that this collection was worth the steep price. But as a man who has a wealth of Blu-Ray's I can no longer watch (""Raging Bull, All seasons of Band of Brothers, Full Metal Jacket, to name a few,) I must rate this a whopping two stars. I implore anyone who is reading my review to PLEASE be cautious with their Blu-Ray players, as your children may be as hurtful as mine. Denice will no longer be allowed to 'BORROW' any of her nice mother's or my things.
Like Mr. Cobb, I hope that I can one day wake up from this nightmare.",1467504000,2,1677,4.574750830564784

5944857,5,B00EUYKRZA,"The packaging to this collection was better than I expected. Mainly bought this cause I wanted Inception (My favorite movie) on Blu-Ray. Also wanted to watch The Dark Knight Trilogy and Memento. Insomnia was a just bonus for me. I've only watched Memento, Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and Inception so far. With these 4 movies alone. Christopher Nolan is now my favorite director. This collection offers high quality movies. Not only saying the picture is great, but the movies themselves are great. Worth every penny.",1442361600,,520,5.058139534883721

5944862,5,B00EUYKRZA,I love Christopher Nolan and having my favorite BluRays all in one box was awesome.  Now I just need to add Interstellar.,1432598400,,121,4.5
8609651,2,B00EUYKRZA,"This a great set, but my Memento disc came with several deep scratches (gouges, really) on it, despite the fact that I bought it brand new from Amazon. Unfortunately, I didn't get around to watching that particular disc it until long after the return deadline. It's the one movie in this set that's nearly impossible to find on it's own at a reasonable price, so  I may end up having to buy the whole set again, because I'm certainly not going to pay 80 bucks for a standalone replacement.",1523404800,,489,4.49438202247191

8609653,5,B00EUYKRZA,"Most satisfied. So much exceptional cinema in this package it accents Nolan's pure genius of creativity and imagination. Added THE FOLLOWING from Criterion, saw DUNKIRK twice in 70 MM at the local IMAX, but need INTERSTELLAR to complete my catching up.",1503014400,,252,5.170731707317073
8609654,5,B00EUYKRZA,This collection is a steal for the price. Amazing films. Also bought The Prestige Blu-ray to go with it (it fits in the box with the other films). If you're a Christopher Nolan fan this collection is a must buy.,1494460800,4,211,4.3

8609657,5,B00EUYKRZA,Super impressed with these blu-ray versions. They all look great. This really shows off HD. Insomnia while not my favorite Nolan movie has some scenes that I would swear were shot in 4k.,1481932800,,186,4.666666666666667
8609658,4,B00EUYKRZA,"I purchased the Christopher Nolan Director's Collection (Memento / Insomnia / Batman Begins / The Dark Knight / Inception / The Dark Knight Rises) [Blu-ray].

Not much to say really. It's a great collection if you enjoy these Christopher Nolan films. I would have rated it a 5-star if the collection had also included The Prestige. My co-workers and I all agreed that The Prestige was our most favorite Nolan film but it's not in the collection...",1474243200,2,447,4.805194805194805
8609659,4,B00EUYKRZA,"My usual 4-star here because the movies are all excellent, the transfer is great, and it's quite inexpensive for 6 movies, including the Batman trilogy. There's nothing wrong here, but I'm not a drooling fanboy with these as I am with some of the 5-stars I have put up. Nolan knows how to make a suspenseful action movie, and that's all there is to say. You want a movie review, go to Rotten Tomatoes or something.  Don't look at me.  I've watched Battlefield Earth twice and I'm still alive. If you like the Batman movies, pick it up, because Memento is worth the extra cash on its own, and Shutter Island was really awesome. It's also packaged in a really pretty box with individual cases (almost said DVD), and it makes things, well, just so easy to organize.",1470873600,2,762,4.5144927536231885
