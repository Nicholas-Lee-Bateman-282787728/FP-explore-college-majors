8728333,5,B013P0X2VA,"I really enjoy watching The Doozers because I was always a huge fan of Fraggle Rock. My son loves Fraggle Rock and he totally recognized the Doozers when they came on! In this DVD collection, the Doozers set out to make a large gingerbread house and the show really goes into the math and engineering of building the house. Its great how it manages to simplify it enough for young viewers to enjoy. Next you get to see the gang help out a friend and engineer a really cute dress in the process. There's even little present exchanges in this story. I really love how educational and engaging this show is for younger children. I think teamwork is an important life skill and any child watching this is sure to learn very quickly the importance and joy that comes from being part of a team. This is great for ages 3 to 7, but my 21-month-old really enjoyed as well. I give it 5 out of 5 stars! Reviewed by Rachael V. for KIDS FIRST!
