173867,5,0972628614,"This documentary is an excellent attempt to summarize the whole life span of Muhammad's Life alongwith showing the Lives of current day Muslims, side by side. The director very intelligently picks up a diverse set of Muslims, both Men and women, immigrants, and locals, born muslims and reverts, scholars and day to day practicing muslims, and shows the aspects of their lives while touching the Life of Muhammad. It gives an insight into what goes on in Muslim mosques and Islamic centers in United States and the rich culture and civilization that is associated with Islam, a faith practiced by 1.3 billion Muslims, Worldwide. A most cited documentary by PBS in recent times. Astounding to say the least...",1132963200,9,708,5.008474576271187
173868,5,0972628614,"This movie is an perfect window to the life of muhammad. The little details of his life which inspire human to remain faithful to God during all struggles of life.

This movie also lifted some of the misconceptions of the non-muslims about 9\11. the fact that it was act of genocide and no law in Islam with appreciate such terrible acts.

I would recommend this DVD for everyone who know little or nothing about prophet muhammad and his legacy.",1115683200,4,445,4.620253164556962
173869,5,0972628614,"finally a great movie about islam and muhammad that shows the true nature and following of muslims as true muslims; not as the violence of the media lately portrays muslims. this is not a documentary with narration in the background. the words and stories included here are out of the mouths of the people and families who practice islam and are true to the religion as it is meant to be-a peaceful and loving religion, with the same love for god that christians, and catholics, and jews follow. a fabulous and one of the best features on islam and muhammad by those who know best-common people you would meet and encounter each day",1104796800,8,632,4.601769911504425
173870,5,0972628614,"This movie is one of the best movies if it wasn't the best one that tells the story of Muhammad, the prophet who has and is a playing a big role in the life of Muslims.

It shows his story from the begining and it explains some misunderstood terms about Islam like Jihad. Many famous people and scholars in the Muslim world were interviewed.

I suggest that you try this movie and learn about this religon from its real sources.",1092355200,12,428,4.3375

7794507,5,0972628614,"I first saw this on PBS and then bought it for my own copy  to help with preparation for a Spirit Play on the Story of Mohammed I was presenting in our church's religious education program.  The narratives by people of Islam faith and by Karen Armstrong (a religious scholar) on details of the faith and history of Islam were very informative.  It was enlightening to hear about the positive aspects of Islam and what Jihad really means --which is ""to struggle or stride"" to be a better human being, parent, child to a parent, sibling, contributing member of society, etc.  I see this in my Muslim neighbors who brought food to us daily after the death of my daughter. I also learned from the video and my neighbors how Muslims fast in Ramadan not only to worship Allah but to understand what it is to be hungry. At the end of Ramadan, it is the custom of Muslims to give money or food to the poor.  Muslims also have giving alms as part of their 7 Pillars of Islam. Mohammed grew up as an orphan taken in by an uncle.  He witnessed poverty and starvation in his surroundings and was sensitive to it. This is well worth watching.",1419120000,,1129,4.37799043062201
7794508,4,0972628614,"The Documentary on the Life of Muhammad is by far the biggest eye opener in explaining the Islamic history and its faith.  The story of Muhammad has been passed down for over 1,400 years from generation to generation by mostly memory.  Muhammad was born into a dangerous world where there were no written laws and no organized government.  In essence it was like the Wild West in relation to lawlessness.  He was essentially an orphan but was eventually raised by his uncle Abi Talib.  At the age of 25 he met a wealthy widow named Kahdijah who was 40 years old and he was asked to take her caravan to Syria.  She was so impressed with him she asked him to marry her.  Fifteen years later Muhammad became restless and society was booming economically in the region.  In the year 610 AD he went up the mountain of Light or Jabal al-Nour near Mecca to meditate.  Once on top an Angel (Gabriel) appeared and wrapped itself around him and began to squeeze him tightly and told him to recite in the name of the Lord.  Muhammad who was shaken by this experience ran back to his village and to his wife.  He told her what happened and that he had to recite the word of the one true God.  He was warned not to do so because he would be rejected but he came to the realization that he was a prophet.  He now believed and received another revelation that he must publically announce to the people his message from God and that he is the prophet.  He told the people they need to serve the people and take care of their community.  This is a clear example of volunteerism that is seen in both Christianity and Judaism.  He also told them there was life after death which was the same belief in Christianity.  After he received each revelation Muhammad would recite it to the people and then they would pass it onto others.  Muhammad was fortunate in Mecca because he was protected in the Tribal system by his Uncle even though he was a threat to the economic system.
  In the documentary there is a diverse group  contributing speakers including authors, professors, calligraphers, an executive director from the ASMA (American Society for Muslim Advancement) Society, Kevin James an supervising Fire Marshall for the FDNY and Jameel Johnson, Chief of Staff for Congressman Gregory Meeks.  However there was one interview from Jameel Johnson whom also coordinates Islamic Friday prayers that immediately got my attention.  At time code 42:22 it shows him going into a Friday prayer known as Jumah in a cramped room on Capitol Hill led by Anwar Al-Awlaki an American-born Al Qaeda Cleric.  This video clip shocked me and caused me to pause the documentary.  This Terrorist was responsible for giving guidance to many terrorist and their actions that are responsible for many innocent deaths that go against the teachings of Muhammad.
  The documentary continued on and spoke through the narrator and other speakers about how the first Muslims were discriminated against and attacked for praying in public.  Because of this persecution Mohammads Clan was forced to move into a Ghetto and they began to be starved out of society.  At this time both his wife and prominent uncle passed away which meant Mohammad no longer had any protectors.  He is now at the lowest point of his life.  Than the Night of Ascension occurred when Muhammad was awakened by the Angel Gabriel and they traveled via a magical steed to Jerusalem and then straight up to the heavens where he meets all the other prophets and the presence of God.  When he returns from his journey he tells his followers where he went.  A group assembled and he is asked to describe Jerusalem and he begins to describe it in great detail.  At this time in Mecca his enemies decided it was time to eliminate him.  After a failed attempt on his life he fled Mecca and is eventually invited to move to Yathrib present day Medina roughly 250 miles north of Mecca.  The settlement was engulfed in tribal warfare but Muhammad became an arbitrator between the factions.  Muhammad would become the leader of Medina and he develops pacts that stated no matter your religious beliefs if they were attacked from the outside all residents would be responsible for defending the city.  After attacking and being attacked overtime by soldiers from Mecca they eventually gained the upper hand.  Mohammad encouraged a spiritual jihad from within in order to perfect oneself for God.  As you can see Jihad was not used to declare war against the innocence.  Mohammad always had a code of conduct in warfare unlike Islamic extremist.  By 628 AD Mohammad led the first Pilgrimage to Mecca just like many religions today do such as the Buddhist, Hindus, Christians and the Jews.  Because the residents of Mecca had concerns a Treaty of Peace was negotiated between the Muslims and Mecca and this was the first political acknowledgment of Islam and Mohammad.  A year later Mohammad led thousands to Mecca and he had a Muslim slave perform the call to prayer.  Mohammad subsequently led his military and took Mecca by force destroying all religious idols but granted his enemies amnesty.  Mohammad gave his final Sermon on the Mount of Arafat which overlooks Mecca.  Today Islam is the second largest religion and believes in the same God (Allah in Arabic) as the Jews and Christians.  All three religions are considered monotheism.  Finally, Islam believes as mentioned above in only one God (Allah) and that Moses, Jesus and Mohammad were all messengers from God or Prophets unlike the Christians who believe that Jesus was the son of God and Judaism is very similar to Islam but is based on the historical event of divine revelation experienced by the entire nation.  Whereas Islam is based on the prophetic claims of a single individual who subsequently convinced others to follow his ways.  This is one documentary that everyone should watch no matter what your religious beliefs or prejudices are.  It just doesnt tell it from one view point but from many viewpoints from across the spectrum of our society.",1385856000,,6034,4.763969171483622
7794509,4,0972628614,"The movie about the prophet Muhammad begins showing his life as a child. His father was deceased before his birth and his mother died when he was six years old. He grew up the wealthy adopted son of his aunt and uncle. After he married a financially well to do woman, Khadijah, she encouraged him to follow his desires to preach publicly. He was 40 years of age when he left his home to go out into the public to spread the teachings of the Islamic religion. During the 23 years of his journey to establish and maintain the doctrine of Islam, Muhammad went through many challenges to test his dedication to what he believed in. His followers were even thrown into some of the punishments he once only suffered from. He and others were banished to a desolate place in the desert to survive off of wild leaves from trees. He was invited to assist with the ending of a war which was successful and the reputation he has made for himself, being a self proclaimed prophet began to attract more believers. Muslims from different walks of life, helped to contribute their perspectives on the life of Muhammad. The reflect on his life and how he was often criticized and challenged.",1354060800,,1174,4.5424528301886795
7794510,4,0972628614,"This film is a great educator to those of us who were ignorant of Muhammad's vast importance to the followers of Islam. We are shown Muhammad's influence on faithful believers who work and live in this contemporary time based on principles that originated thousands of years ago. Why is the prophet so loved? Why is Islam the fastest growing religion in the world? The documentary credits this increase to the steadfastness of those who hold Muhammad's inspired word in their hearts despite the obvious opposition by others especially after the 911 attacks. We are awakened to reality by multiple interviews with Muslims who are firefighters, nurses, professors etc. who are no different than the rest of the world. True Muslims strive to be honorable, respectful, hard working and accountable in all areas of their lives. How admirable that this faith encompasses such diversity! African Americans, Arabs and Europeans are all represented as Muhammad is celebrated within millions of households every day across the world.
The historical journey from Muhammad's beginning to his death is vivid and awe inspiring. The prophet was unable to read and write yet God used him to deliver a powerful new faith that would so prick the heart of people they would turn over their whole lives to Allah. This proves Muhammad's works were not of his own merit but of a greater God who used a man many would deem unseemly to bring about positive change in so many believers. The film also proves that the extremist actions of many who claim to act out in violence to protect the sacredness of Islam are not supported by the original teachings of Muhammad. One after another interviewees stress that this his words were those of peace, unity and love. He is credited with bringing hope to a planet drenched in war and suffering from an emptiness that only Allah could fill. With an open mind anyone who views this documentary will walk away with a new view of Islam and a respect for those who hold its truths deep in their hearts.",1272153600,,2017,4.832369942196531
7794511,5,0972628614,This video provides a great historical perspective about the life of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and how it shaped early Islamic history. I also love the video clips injected throughout the movie that depict the lives of Muslims living in America today. This provides viewers a great window into the lives of both born and converted Muslims and how they carry out their day-to-day routines as they strive to become better Muslims and better human beings.,1224633600,2,450,5.013333333333334
7794512,3,0972628614,"This two-hour documentary somewhat awkwardly interweaves the story of Muhammad with profiles of various American Muslims: a firefighter who converted to Islam; an Islamic calligrapher; a woman who moved to the U.S. from northern India at age fifteen; the chief of staff for a New York congressman; a nurse in Michigan; and a convert making the pilgrimage to Mecca. The film presents Muhammad and Islam in the best possible light.

The DVD's special features include interviews about the making of the film, four deleted scenes, and a five-minute overview of the various practices involved in the Hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca.

7794513,1,0972628614,"It is historically documented that Muhammed spread his teachings and visions and built his Islamic empire with tactics that included mass killing, torture and destruction of property and productive goods. These ""details"" were never mentioned.

In Muhammed's Meccan period when he was weaker and had fewer followers passages of the Qur'an encouraged peaceful relations and avoidance of conflict.  Later, after persecution and emigration to Medina authority was given to engage in warfare for defensive purposes only.  Finally, as the Muslim community grew stronger but conflicts with its neighbors continued, further revelations expanded the license for waging war. Sura 9, one of the last chapters to be revealed, concluded that war against non-Muslims could be waged at any time and in any place to extend the dominace of Islam. Hence, the justification used by jihad terrorists today to wage war against non-Muslims around the world.

It is crucial to engage Muslims in a process of clear thinking and debate on how to evaluate the moral guidance of the man whom they strive to emulate. This type of propaganda film is a farce.  Shame on you PBS.",1159142400,2,1148,5.183783783783784
7794514,5,0972628614,"Hi. Can you give a reference that Muhammad did those things? Those allegations are pure propaganda. Without having read his life, and without knowing him, it is a crime to blame him for such things. So, if he were around, it wouldn't be him who would be in jail, but it would be you who would be put in jail, because of blaming him irresponsibly (unless he forgave you-and i believe he would, because he is the greatest man of all mankind). May God guide you to the right path. Peace.",1138492800,7,484,4.329670329670329
