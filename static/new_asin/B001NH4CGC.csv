Brilliant writing and acting. You'll feel a little nauseated, a little disappointed in the characters, and a little happy - all at the same time! It's not a feel good, leave numb movie. It's a movie you'll want to talk about after it ends, even if you are sitting around and everyone else is doing the talking.

Favorites: I grew attached to the gnome for some comic relief. A hand growing out of the basement - just as creepy as it sounds. I loved Archie's innocent energy and was captivated by Veronica's song in the tree.

A little comedy, romance, horror, fantasy, musical all in one!  An absolute must see!",1231891200,2,700,4.531746031746032

8327018,2,B001NH4CGC,Pointless and boring.  Thank God for the ability to skip sections.,1486339200,,66,5.0

8327021,3,B001NH4CGC,"I'm not really sure how to review this flick.  I expected a horror movie, which is my forte', but I got a bizarre psychedelic transformation into unexplained worlds of cosmic mystification.  Does my first sentence make sense?  Of course not...and neither does this film from the get-go.  It is a ""trip""...definitely one you may want to nurture a bottle of wine (or whiskey) to be your movie theater date.  Don't get me wrong, I liked it because it was different.  However, movie-goers will probably not be able to equate the artwork on the DVD case to anything that transpires on the DVD.  I gave it 3 stars because I'm still seeing stars.  What the heck did I just watch?  I don't know!  Who's on first?",1250467200,4,704,4.56
8327022,5,B001NH4CGC,"Great movie!  My kind of horror film - lots of suspense, a love story, and pockets of tongue in cheek humor that made me laugh out loud!  This movie was extremely entertaining while in the theater, and very thought provoking on the ride home.  Lively discussion with the other three people in my car!",1234915200,,300,4.518518518518518
8327023,5,B001NH4CGC,this girl is gorgeous.  who wouldn't want a guitar playing sweetheart that you could nurture and get out of a bad relationship with Philip.  damn him to hell for eating her finger and causing her to only have 9 fingers instead of 10.,1233619200,2,233,4.395348837209302
8327024,5,B001NH4CGC,"It was cool seeing this movie in the theater. Better than ""Gran Torino"" you ask? I don't know, I haven't seen it yet. I'd like to, but ""like to"" only works in horseshoes and hand grenades. And does anyone else think it would be cool to see ""Growing Out"" in 3-D like that Valentine movie? Sign me up for that.",1232755200,,308,4.15
8327025,5,B001NH4CGC,"Highly recommended! This film has interesting characters, solid acting, and a refreshingly unique plot that will hold your attention to the end.",1231891200,,144,5.590909090909091
8327026,5,B001NH4CGC,"This is definitely a movie that makes you think.  Some gruesome parts, but not necessarily scary - a little more suspenseful than anything else.  Would for sure recommend this movie!",1231891200,,182,5.033333333333333
