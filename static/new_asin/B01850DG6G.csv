7539255,5,B01850DG6G,"- Synopsis: An anime about a hero and his masterful display of a bow. Despite the odds being against him, he attempts to take on some of the most powerful warriors known to human-kind. Being impressed with his resolve and skill, she decides to employ him into her ranks. From one battle to the next, their experiences and interactions together will be remembered for awhile, as they join forces to take down their enemies. Tune in to experience the adventures of a marksman and a war maiden.
===========================================================================================================

- Comments: Great anime with nice waifus too. One of the things I found really interesting is the main character. It's pretty rare to see an archer/marksman as a protagonist. Typically, like in many JRPGs, the protagonist is a sword-wielder. So this was a nice change of pace from all those warrior classes. It was nice seeing from the perspective of a marksman and seeing his deadly precision. He has to make all shots count, calculate wind speed and distance. Kinda like a sniper. Very methodical and resourceful. You kinda have to when you are just a human.

- Analysis: Not only in war, life in general is a constant struggle between life and death. Although the dangers vary situationally, it should be noted that each day comes with a chance that one will die. Whether an accident occurs within one's place of dwelling, or something like a car accident, death is always lurking around those that are cautious or unaware. Death doesn't discriminate, after all.

- Features: English and Japanese audio, as well as English subtitles. Includes 13 episodes on 2 Blu-rays, and 13 on 2 DVDs with a run-time of about 5 hours. Rated TV-MA for violence, blood and gore, and some sexual content. There is plenty of fan-service, but there isn't any nudity.

- Conclusion: He's also pretty lucky stumbling into various ecchi situations but doesn't make too big of a deal of it like many other male anime characters do. They usually freak out, but Tigre is pretty chill overall. So, although he's a bit of a ditz at times, he's pretty calm and mature. A fairly refreshing trait that isn't present in many protagonists.

7539256,5,B01850DG6G,"I love this series. It is campy and funny. Although it did seem like they hurried the series to bring it to a close.

However still worth watching it.",1482624000,,150,4.172413793103448
7539257,1,B01850DG6G,"Bought the limited edition that was suppose to come with the six art cards, but instead I only got five. The one I'm missing is from the dvd case and the other two art cards were a bit damage from the top left edge.",1482105600,,215,3.909090909090909
7539258,5,B01850DG6G,"Don't let the Moe fool you.  At its base this is a serious series about Medieval feudalism,... with some slapstick harem humor and magic added.  In a parallel version of Europe, teenage Count of Alsace, Tigrevurmud ""Tigre"" Vorn, answers his king's call and joins his small force to a seemingly oversized Brunish army (25,000) seeking vengeance from Zhcted's nearest domain, which can only muster a small force (5,000).  However, Zhcted War Maiden Eleonora ""Elen"" Viltaria, uses her tiny force brilliantly and wins a spectacular victory, among other things accomplishing the capture of Tigre, who impresses her with his courage and his bowmanship.  With King Faron falling into depression at reports of the death of his son who was in command, Brunish factions begin to struggle for control, and Tigre learns to his horror that his own province of Alsace is to be raized and its population seized, but to his shock, Elen agrees to bring her small army to the defense of what will accordingly become a Zhcted province of Alsace instead.  What follows is an intricate feudal dance in which Tigre and Elen gradually win allies by doing the right thing as opposed to doing the calculated thing.

Among the surprising things in this series is the detailed explanations of the large scale battles as well as the violence; one of the major characters is murdered by bee stings!  It will make you think, and the opening theme song is one of the most effective I've heard in years.

Note: The manga series is now being published over here; and it is both much longer and much more detailed:

7539262,5,B01850DG6G,"I have a love hate relationship with amazon. It is great for ordering stuff, but it advertises stuff to me that I like. That sucks when I'm broke, but luckily this was shown too me when I had money.
I almost never watch previews for movies/shows. I rely on review (star rating) and recommendations. When I put the disc in all I knew was the name and it had good reviews. So the only warning I have is its a bit cheesy/clich. Once I accepted that was the kind of show it was I really enjoyed it.

I like both the English and the Japanese voice actors of this anime I liked most of the episodes, wish it was longer I liked alot of characters including a couple that died. I hope we get a second season I would really like to see more of this anime story and different characters that did not appear much and the other nations and nobles that they did not show.

7539266,5,B01850DG6G,"I had to look hard to find a copy, but when I did I played the whole series in one weekend - then replayed it over the next week.  The story is excellent, the animation is amazing, and the plot twists and turns were not too exhausting.  Something of a harem story, the 'Lord Marksman' of the title is a minor noble who is captured after an act of valor that impresses his captor and her long-time friend and general.  His mettle and honour are tested, further impressing everyone who comes into contact with him.  Some humour as well, as there always is with soldiers - try the scene where the women compete running their fingers through Vorn's unruly red hair in an attempt to comb it!

The sad issue is that the story is set in the overall context of a civil war - from that perspective, it is painful to view, as good troops who would probably get on well in a bar wind up cutting each other to pieces because of which side of a line on some map they belong to.  Vorn and the alliance he forces together through personal example and determination - including the forces of two War Maidens - are instrumental in bringing to an end the war and starting an uneasy peace.  A great series, which I would recommend to everyone.",1470009600,,1224,4.318777292576419

7539269,3,B01850DG6G,"The show has some interesting characters and plot ides, but it just never spends enough time expanding on any of them before rushing off to the next point.  It's like they tried to cram two seasons worth of material into a single season.

One note, despite the hints to the contrary, this is not actually an ecchi show.  There's some fanservice, but nothing is actually shown- any time one of the girls is naked, there's always something covering the not-safe-for-American-Television parts.  It gets an MA rating just for the violence.",1466035200,3,535,4.911111111111111

7539275,5,B01850DG6G,Excellent,1458604800,,9,9.0
7539276,5,B01850DG6G,"It is evident that the producers are rushing the content as I can easily see that there are more context throughout the entire series. Does that mean the pacing is off or awkward? Not at all. I applaud the director and writers of the adaptation as I thoroughly enjoyed every second of it. From what I've seen online, this show has a ecchi tag on it. If you like ecchi, this is NOT the show to look for it, as it has NONEXISTENT ecchi element in it (mind blown). The entire series is mature, sprinkled with playful dialogue from the main characters. The character design is bar none one of the best I've seen, and you'll never get tired of them.

I think one aspect that deserves special acknowledgement is the OP. It has easily become my top 3 OP. The music is epic, and the animation that goes along with it is amazing as well. It's not a perfect show, but it is undoubtedly a solid, solid show. Personally, I hope a second season comes out soon.",1458604800,3,947,4.320224719101123
7539277,4,B01850DG6G,Interesting series. Needs to be longer. If it were longer the story and characters could have been flushed out in more detail. You can tell that things were probably cut story/character wise to fit into the small amount of episodes.,1458432000,2,232,4.825

7539279,4,B01850DG6G,"I enjoyed everything from the Character Animation to the English dubbing.  I watched the first 2 episodes on Funimation's site and had to watch more, so I got this set.  Tigre is the main character who seems like a low class baron or prince who just can't seem to get along with the ruling faction, but he's pretty bad@$$ with the bow and arrow.  That itself makes all the girls swoon over him.  You want to root for him and hope he does great things, not just cuz the other women that come along in the show, say so or hint at it :)  I won't get into more details bc other folks will prolly tell you everything you want to know.  There's a decent amount of fanservice, action, & budding romance to make you want to watch more.  I watched the entire series in one day (and yes i do have a life, haha).  My only problem with the show is that they didn't flesh out enough of the main characters or even some of the other characters that appear in the credits, my guess is that they were hinting at the other characters that would have been fleshed out more in a 2nd Season.  Overall, I got my moneys worth, if you like to root for the good guy and see some very buxom ladies, this shows for you!  I only wish there was more :(",1458000000,,1224,4.105042016806722
7539280,4,B01850DG6G,I like this but I not sure about it I have to get more into it. I can always find a good home,1457568000,,93,3.0869565217391304

7539282,3,B01850DG6G,"Yet another cookie-cutter anime series with no real 'teeth'. Although I did enjoy watching this series, it was utterly predictable, I telegraphed the ending easily and the characters are lackluster. The English dub was well done though. Too much use of CG and a sharp drop in animation quality towards the predictable ending.
A nice series but far from a purchase. Rent or stream this one.",1456790400,,389,4.909090909090909

8741461,3,B01850DG6G,"This is the first anime I've been disappointed in for quite a while. The fan service seemed fairly minimal compared to other series and wasn't really a factor...it's the story, the mouth garbling names (which most should be used to in this genre and normally doesn't bother me) and the fact (spoiler here)...the hero never misses except early on when they gave him a bad bow to screw up his aim for a 'test.' After that became clear, there wasn't much of an element of suspense in the battles...mostly familiar anime tropes. Motivations for a lot of the characters seemed unclear and the province and country diplomatic connections were odd, vague...and finally uninteresting.
Some of the series I have enjoyed more in a fantasy vein lately (and can give you a gauge where I'm coming from) include Utawarerumono, Grimgar, Fairy Tail (which has a lot of silly moments but can be pretty serious on occasion) and Is It Wrong to Pick Up Girls In A Dungeon. Watch some of those first and if you're bored or you can see it free then try this one. Of course it's all selective, I'm just trying to be a considerate guide. Enjoy!",1496620800,,1120,4.633165829145729
