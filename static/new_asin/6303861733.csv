721329,1,6303861733,"I did not like this movie at all, and I have taken it out of our collection and put it in the trash. The only reason that I didn't like this movie is because of the bullies in it that pester Little Foot and his friends. It is negative, and have found my two year old son starting to act out some of the behaviours that the bullies do in this movie.

Get it if you wish, but I don't recommend it.",1128816000,7,395,3.817073170731707
721330,5,6303861733,"Even though words like ""dumb"" were used, this is a reality for children. It gives parents an opportunity to talk to children about how it feels to be called names and to be sensitive to others feelings. My kids love all the movies and pretend play the characters. They see what being a good friend is all about. I can refer back to the movie to make a point.",1026259200,5,358,4.202898550724638

721374,1,6303861733,"Not appropriate for children.  At the start of the movie, there's a song about how great it is to be big and intimidate the smaller dinosaurs. Ok, they're bullies, fine. The little guys point out that they'll be bigger when they grow up.  At this point Hip, the leader of the bullies says, ""oh yeah? I'm going to see to it you never grow up."" ""How?"" His friend says. ""Sheesh you're dumb, let me lay it out for you. First we chase them. Then we catch them. Third we hurt them."" This is not ok for kids. I turned it off at this point.",1458345600,,532,4.105769230769231

7854109,1,6303861733,"I purchased this movie and previously purchased a Vizio television with an AMAZON VIDEO App that includes an ""Amazon"" BUTTON on the remote control - PURCHASED not rented - in reliance on the availability of this AND MANY OTHER MOVIES for viewing by my PERMANENTLY DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED 26 YEAR OLD daughter on the AMAZON Video App on the the remote because she is not, as a consequence of her disability, able to maneuver screens and log-ins on a television.  In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!  This is fraud.  This is likely also a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and just bad business!!!!!! Do not BUY ANY AMAZON VIDEOS unless you intend to purchase a new television every year to keep up with Amazon's unscrupulous and fraudulent business practices.",1465948800,2,1192,4.8
