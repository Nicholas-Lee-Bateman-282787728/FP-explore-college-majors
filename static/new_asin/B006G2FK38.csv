8497392,4,B006G2FK38,"Let me state upfront that I am a big fan of the Film Movement library of foreign and indie movies. I am a subscriber of their DVD-of-the-month Club but this is an older release that I hadn't see yet.

""Hospitalit"" (2010 release from Japan; 95 min.) brings the story of a man who owns a small printing company along with his (much younger) wife and his divorced sister. The business is literally run from the front room of the house. One day a stranger shows up, claiming to be the son of a well-doer who gave the family some much needed help back in the day. As it happens, the only other employee of the shop has health issues, so the man decides to hire the stranger and give him room and board. This becomes a major issue as not much longer after that, a woman claiming to be the stranger's wife, a gorgeous looking Brazilian, shows up. At this point, we are about 30 min. into the movie and to tell you more would ruin your viewing experience.

Couple of comments: first of all, I have no idea why the movie's title for the US release is ""Hospitalit"" (as opposed to, say, ""Hospitality""). Second, the movie offers some seldom-seen ideas about the lack of diversity in Japanese society, which in fact is one of the most homogenous cultures and societies in the world. Third, there are several winning performances, notably American actress Bryerly Long (in the role of the Brazilian woman) and Kumi Hyodo as the young wife. As always, the DVD comes with a bonus shortie, and on this release, it is a great US shortie called ""Miyuki"" (12 min.), about a lonely young Japanese woman who recently moved to New York and out of desperation tries the internet to meet people, with unintended consequences. Watch!

Bottom line: ""Hospitalit"" is a pleasant movie, striking a great balance between comedy and drama, and with winning performances. It is yet another nice addition to the ever growing rich Film Movement catalog of foreign and indie movies. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1387670400,,1965,4.640804597701149
8497393,4,B006G2FK38,"This is a ""weird"" movie - but uses that weirdness very cleverly to make some interesting points about xenophobia. And I saw it at the time that George Zimmerman was being tried for his killing while on a Neighborhood Watch patrol, which may be why the movie made a very positive impression on me. I admire artists who can hide statements about social problems within a good story. I was entertained and when it was over I was left thinking about flawed human behavior.",1376956800,,468,4.583333333333333
8497394,3,B006G2FK38,"I'm always intrigued with other cultures and their way of life. I love learning about everything from the food, the beliefs, customs, and overall way of life. Movies are a great vehicle to give us a glimpse into societies we'd otherwise may never have exposure to. Hospitalit does just that as it delves into the quiet household of Mikio Kobayashi (Kenji Yamauchi) and his family.

Mikio lives a somewhat plain life along with his beautiful, and notably younger, wife, daughter, and his divorced sister. The family drama alone is fairly entertaining, but things get a little more exciting for the family when Kagawa (Kanji Furutachi) arrives. Kagawa claims to be the son of a financier who once helped Mikio's printing business. Mikio has some recollection of this, so he feels obligated to be hospitable to Kagawa.

Before you know it, Kagawa invites himself to be a live-in employee along with his non-Japanese wife (we are never quite sure of her nationality). Thus the concept of hospitalit comes into play. The Kobayashi's adapt around their new visitors, which both brings them closer and draws them apart in some respects. I think anyone who's ever had an unwelcomed house guest can relate to this situation, and those who have know that it often can bring out the best and worst of us.

The film becomes more than just a wacky comedy, but more about family, community, and of course, hospitality. The Japanese culture is always been on I've been very interested in, so this movie provided a lot of enlightenment and entertainment for me. The director wrote about the film inside the DVD case for the film and discussed about Japan's historical view of outsiders. He said he'd like to see more foreigners in Japan to mix things up and keep it interesting. That thought provides a lot of insight and more meaning into the film.

I enjoyed this film mostly due to its message and honesty. I too hope that the world becomes more accepting of other cultures and people who are simply different. The film does a great job of showing a family and their conflicts and milestones as a result of accepting an outsider. However the humor for me was possibly lost in translation, as I felt the film was fairly dry with exception to a few humorous scenes. I had trouble really liking most of the characters, often becoming annoyed with some of them. But hey, maybe that is the point and I'm not supposed to love them, but accept them? Either way, I felt as if I were missing something on many occasions and lost interest during a few periods of the film.

Though the film didn't quite have the laughs or relevant characters for me, it still achieved what it set out to do. It makes a strong statement, and does so in an honest, artful and sometimes quirky manner.

8497395,4,B006G2FK38,"Mikio Kobayashi (Kenji Yamauchi) runs a printing business on the ground floor of his home. His second and very young wife Natsuki (Kiki Sugino) handles the financial affairs of the shop and looks after his daughter Eriko (Erika Ono).  Into their lives comes a manipulative con man/blackmailer named Kagawa (Kanji Furutachi) claiming to be the son of an old friend of Kobayashi's father. Kagawa rapidly takes over the job of a sick employee and gets room and board provided too. Kagawa then also brings his wife to live in the house,  the wife says she is from Brazil but one has doubts about this statement as she later says she is from Bosnia. Her English sounds American.  What follows is that Kobayashi's life and the life of his family is turned inside out and upside down. Although this movie starts off subtly and slowly it picks up speed as it goes along, secrets are revealed and the plot thickens.  I found this film to be primarily an outing and criticism about Japanese xenophobia.  The xenophobia is most pronounced in the neighborhood watch group that wants to clear their small area of Tokyo from foreigners and the homeless.  It's interesting though that despite the xenophobia Kobayashi's young daughter Eriko is learning English and that his divorced sister, who also lives with them, hopes to move abroad and also wants to learn English. This movie is a black comedy/drama that despite it's slow start eventually builds to a raucous finish.  It is like hospitality taken to the absurd when manipulative people are able to almost totally overcome the lives of weaker and gentler people.  I give it 4 stars for being different and entertaining.",1348099200,4,1660,4.861702127659575
8497396,5,B006G2FK38,"Original, Funny and Thoughtful! Hospitalite is a drama-comedy with an enjoyable plot and an amazing cast! I'm a very difficult viewer who needs to be entertained but I actually really enjoyed the slow pace of the film. I felt I could better follow the evolution of each character and feel incredibly connected to them. Each character has something sincere and crazy that makes you never want to leave them and the `'family'' they form. One of the best films I have seen in a while!",1338940800,7,481,4.670588235294118
