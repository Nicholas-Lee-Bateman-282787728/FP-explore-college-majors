8241134,3,B00119ULQW,"""The Uranium Conspiracy"" is a 1978 espionage action movie from B-movie mogul Menahem Golan, shot in various locales (notably Italy and The Netherlands) and featuring a dizzying array of languages though no subtitles. Normally when the credits start with a mention of Golan-Globus Productions (in this case Golan-Globus-Dunamis Productions) I quake in fear for the way the next 90 minutes of my life will be spent. In this case that's unwarranted. This is actually a somewhat dated but very watchable and briskly entertaining movie, one of Golan's best.

The film stars Fabio Testi as Renzo an ultra-suave operative that is assigned to research a shipment of yellowcake (a uranium compound) which is ostensibly going to be used for manufacturing paint, but in reality is to be used for Middle Eastern despots to make 25 plutonium bombs which can spell nuclear annihilation for Israel (the Mossad even makes a shadowy appearance in the backstory here.) Bonus points go to Golan and company for having the precognition to envision this plot almost 40 years ago.

Testi does well with his role despite occasionally ridiculous dialogue (the exchange in English about a German crossword puzzle serves as a prime example.) Needless to say for a suave agent like Testi, there needs to be a vixen, in this case Helga (Janet Agren) who looks very nice but gets in way over her head. Testi's stalwart comrade is Dan (Assaf Dayan) who also does fine in his role. The bad guys are a diverse lot and before it's over there is a conspiracy stretching from Salzburg to Saudi Arabia, with ""The Baron"" (Siegfried Rauch) leading the German-speaking contingent. While it's not terribly difficult to follow the film, there are several times when subtitles would have been of value, though Golan manages to catch everyone up with deft summaries in English after a non-English exchange. The yellowcake ends up on a freighter, and to keep the bomb out of the hands of terrorists a plan is hatched to sink the ship with mines, the problem being that Renzo and Dan are onboard. The pace starts slowly, but really quickens in the last half of the film, and there is much gunplay and fighting in anticipation of the big finale, which I won't reveal.

The film has several drawbacks: intermittently the dialogue tends to the ridiculous, and some of the early scenes run too long. Most annoying is the unrelenting electronic music soundtrack which is frequently weirdly inappropriately and almost totally irritating. Balancing that are some beautiful location shooting (the boat chase in the canals is very well done) and generally decent performances throughout. ""The Uranium Conspiracy"" won't ever rival the James Bond franchise, but it is one of the best films ever to come from the Golan-Globus empire.",1341360000,2,2776,5.004329004329004
8241135,4,B00119ULQW,"The Uranium Conspiracy, 1978 film

The film begins at a mining camp in Zaire Africa (the former Belgian Congo). Armed guards patrol the grounds. A man walks into a bar, he is looking for someone who is busy. There is a report on a special big order of uranium. Yellowcake can be used for fertilizer or paint, or it could be used for plutonium. The agent gets cash to pay his informant. They show scenes of Venice, an important banking center since the Renaissance. A factory in Salzburg bought the uranium ore. Renzo meets Helga, she talks about her boring job. They become friendly. Contact is by telephone or Telex. Prince Fouad arrives at the mansion, he likes arak. Is this a trick? What are they after? Next we see Amsterdam. The conspiracy is uncovered. The girl gives her captors the slip. Renzo rescues her! Her attacker goes over the edge.

A motorboat chase in the canal provides action and fills out the story. Shots are fired! This provides excitement in the middle of the film. [Does it remind you of an earlier film?] But a lock closes to end the chase. The message is delivered by the girl, who is no longer needed in this film. Renzo is captured, can he be saved? The barrels of uranium are loaded at Antwerp. What will those SCUBA divers do? The ship leaves port at night. Dan finds Renzo and helps him out. Can they commandeer the ship? Will the Tedeschi cancel their orders? A gun battle breaks out. [More action to pad the film.] What will happen when they run out of bullets? Will help arrive in time to save them and capture the villains and the ship for a happy ending?

The film ends without telling what happens next. How will they account for the dead men aboard? A foreign action film dubbed into English is always interesting to watch. Was it based on a true event?",1268006400,,1793,4.477064220183486
