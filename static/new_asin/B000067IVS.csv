1719283,5,B000067IVS,I don't yet have the Perfect Collection but it's on the way.  Blue Seed is ranked way up there in my opinion.  It isn't as dirty as most animes but it isn't kiddy at all.  If you like animes like Sorcerer Hunters then you should also like Blue Seed.,1024358400,,249,4.040816326530612
1719284,4,B000067IVS,"To those who have waited for ADV to get around to it the patience is rewarded.  Although not in the league of Evangelion Blue Seed those carve its own niche with a deft bit of humor interspread with the action filled story.  Although the characters are stock (klutzy heroine, tortured hero, though a twist with the weapons freak being female is a nice touch).  Fanboys will enjoy the generous ""service"" shots slipped in though nothing warranting strict adult control.  The omake theater segments are especially enjoyable if you understand the cultral humor and inside jokes of the plot. All in all a nice addition.",1024272000,,614,4.875
1719285,5,B000067IVS,"Blue Seed is an AMAZING series in many ways. I bought the first vhs volume 3 years ago and since then have enjoyed it. Although the art is usually far from perfect, that doesn't stop it from being on the list of my favorite anime ever! There are some amazing action sequences, but along with that, it will make you laugh, cry, and give you some shocking plot twists (which I will NOT spoil). The concept is X- Files meets Aliens meets your favorite sitcom (in most parts).

  Parents be warned; the violence is not all that keeps this title out of the reach of young children. There are a few near-sexual situations and some panty humor. As for the better language, steer clear of the dub if you can't stand squealing heroines. I'd probably go for the sub even if that wasn't the case.

  I won't reveal the plot for you, but I will tell you a few things. The leading character (no names mentioned; find out yourself) is done by a massively popular voice actress: Megumi Hayashibara. The humor fades later, and speaking of the humor, NO STUPID COMEDY CLICHES(thank GOD!).
And although the whole monster thing is a bit of a cliche, the monsters themselves are pretty original. If you want more humor later check out the 13 omake theaters.

  Overall, I'd put it in the no. 2 spot on my favorite anime t.v. series list (putting it below the amazing Neon Genesis Evangelion and above the hilarious Slayers). My father even came to enjoy it, and if you LOVE anime or are a beginner, you'll adore it.",1057708800,6,1495,4.487084870848708
1719286,4,B000067IVS,"This anime is very interesting... at least with good storyline, AMAZING story and the love-comedy thing make this anime a JOY to watch.
DO NOT watch this anime if you are searching for LARGE BUDGETS ANIMES like Akira, Spirited Away or X because this one is very bad with the animation and the graphics(comparing with other animes).
The Japanese track was very good, I really liked the voices of Kusanagi and Momiji but I heard BETTER voices of Megumi Hayashibara(Momiji)like Pai(3x3 Eyes) and Lina(Slayers), anyway my favorite voice of Hayashibara is Pai.
The English track was VERY BAD, the worst voices were Momiji and Kusanagi because those two sounded like jerks and the other voices were stupid, the worst part was when Momiji is singing with Sakura . I heard better dubs in english like Battle Angel and Akira's first dub, I hope the dubbing people make a better work next time.
The Spanish track was very nice, I REALLY enjoyed the voice of Momiji (for me, it was better than the japanese voice)and the other voices were good as the japanese. What I didn't like about this dub is that the dialoge was worst than the enlish dub because they change a lot of things that the characters had to say.

1719288,3,B000067IVS,"This is probably your quittisential anime series, and if your random shortsighted critic of anime saw it they would probably think their criticisms well founded.  It's goofy, the typical anime expressions and silliness are rampant (googly eyes, sweat/tear drops half the size of their heads, goofy love sub-plots, many underwear shots and jokes), extremely violent in places (many of the evil creatures and the methods they die, although they are plants so they usually bleed green), and an overly labored and confusing plot (blue seeds needed to gain power to kill evil plants, but are the evil plants bad?  and is the bad guy really bad?  and what's with the girl that was the main character's friend?  and the main character has to die but can't be killed by the bad guys...wha???).  Anyway, yes there are a lot of points to take criticism with this, and I'm pretty glad this isn't representative of all anime.  Nevertheless, still a fun series with lots of humor and action, and a great time-killer, so if you're looking for another good anime series to start on you can do worse.  Be wary though, you might want to take notes considering the excessive amount of characters, many similar sounding Japanese names,  and plot convolutions...",1050969600,5,1242,4.909090909090909

The story is just amazing with all its twists and plots but it is not to hard to understand unlike Evagalion which is a little akward if u don't watch the entire series. Anyway The story is your general action/adventure/romance/drama as far as animes are concerned except it has a few twist. First it is one of about 2 dozen anime based off actual myth. Secondly the love triangle between Kusinagi, Momiji and Kaeda is intense. and lastly the Animation is top-notch for an oldie.

The Perfect Collection appearance is fantastic. Although, the images on both the discs and the boxart is a little lower than average, and better pictures could have been used instead.
Content: 5/5
This series is fantastic. GO SAKURA! lol. A must for any action anime fan. Although, there are quite a few violent instances, and a major humor factor is the lead character, Fujimiya Momoji, and her ever-changing panties. lol, little sexual inuendo, and heavy, sometimes graphic, animated violence.

1719291,5,B000067IVS,"This anime is about the return of a traditional monster awakening and despite all of our modern technology, the traditional solution may be necessary to take care of it.
You may like this anime for the following reasons:
(1) This is the anime for Shinto traditions.  There are many traditional Shinto themes in this anime.  From festivals honoring local spirits to the monsters themselves.  This is quite a trip for a western viewer.  Somewhat educational too.
(2) Very balanced anime here. There is considerable action, but not too much.  Some relationship twists, but again not too much.  Plus it has a real plot, and it's allowed to develop and conclude.  Several puzzles are uncovered and their answers are not obvious and it doesn't descend into just finding and solving puzzles.  There is also some echi (naughty) humor, but again not too much.  So this series is perfectly balanced between the ""shoujo"" (girls anime) and the ""shonen"" (boys anime.  Good universal appeal.
(3) This box set gives you alot of anime for the dollar!
(4) The sub voice actress is Megumi Hayashibara.  She does a great job with the Momiji character.  If you know her history, she gets to be in many of the great anime series, so this series is to be included in that elite list.
Overall, it's definately something worth watching.",1039046400,2,1312,4.834080717488789
1719292,5,B000067IVS,"The blue seed collection has to be the best dvd to ever be purchased. once you watch one episode, you don't want to stop! The story is about a young 15 year old girl named Momiji Fujimia who is a clutz and lives with her grandma and mother. She had been purifying herself since the 5th grade b/c of her grandma's comands, but never really knew why. But she finds out when a man with 4 eyebrows and 7 blue mitamas on his hands, and chest tries to kill her. She is saved by the TAC who tries to kill the bad guys in the story, called Aragami. The man who tried to kill Momiji actually turns back to what he's supposed to do, which is to protect the Kushinada. Momiji actually has a twin sister who was killed and so now the man (Kusanagi) has to protect Momiji. The story has many twists and turns and has OMAKE in the extras wich is just a riot. The story also has a cute romance in it, and lots of humor. It's great for probably 13/14 and up. Just because they need to be old enough to understand the story b/c you have to pay attention to get it. This is an awesome buy!",1028073600,6,1071,4.032863849765258
1719293,4,B000067IVS,"After only having the first three tapes, I decided I was going to get the DVDs. Budget was always a concern until I found this boxed set...
The series is about a small, secret government organization that protects Japan from a race of mythological plant-based creatures called Aragami. Momiji is the only one who can protect Japan because of her family's bloodline. Kusanagi was created to protect Momiji and her sister Kaede. However, Kusanagi wants to be free of that and is more interested in trying to kill Momiji. He quickly returns to the role of protector within the first few episodes (out of 26).
I found the series to be very enjoyable, and it seems to borrow elements from the movie, Green Legend Ran. I can't really make a comparison without a risk of revealing the endings of both. The styles are somewhat different so I can't promise that if you enjoy one, you'll like the other. You might find the stories interesting though.
I did experience some technical issues with the DVDs. If I chose Japanese with English subtitles, the settings would reset back to English dubbed with no subtitles at the beginning of the next episode. I also had a problem on the 3rd DVD. After the 3rd episode, one of the Omake Theaters appeared. When it finished, I was taken to the Extras menu instead of the next episode. However, if I simply skip ahead to the next chapter stop, it does take me to the next episode like it should. I usually skip the opening and closing titles after I've seen them several times (especially when watching all episodes straight through) so this isn't a major concern.
If you prefer the dubbed version, this is a great DVD edition. Many of the usual ADV voice actors are here. Some you may recognize from Evangelion or Gunsmith Cats. Amanda Winn does the English voice of Momiji. (Amanda was Rally Vincent in Gunsmith Cats.) Tiffany Grant's Kome is not her best performance. Tiffany Grant seems to be known best for Asuka in Evangelion. She also provided the voice for Becky in the dubbed version of Gunsmith Cats and Chocolat in Sorcerer Hunters.
If you prefer subtitles, you can only hope the problem was with my DVD player. Resetting things to Japanese with English subtitles after each episode could get frustrating. I have not checked to see if selecting Spanish was any different.",1027987200,11,2313,4.713580246913581
1719294,5,B000067IVS,"Usually when it comes to such a dire story as the one portrayed in Blue Seed, the characters are dark and the story extremely cold and serious.  But Blue Seed stands out as being able to have a sense of humor throughout the series.  It strikes a balance between a ""kid"" focused anime and a ""thinker"" anime, what with the very funny characters involved, and the story's obvious opinion about modern Japan.  Voiced by Megumi Hayashibara, Momiji is an endearing character with a good heart, if kinda air-headed personality.  I recommend this anime.
This DVD set is pretty cool, with a HUGE number of episodes per disc considering the usual is 3, with the first disc in a series having 4.  Very cost effective way to own a whole series.  The English dub wasn't as eye watering as is usualy for anime (my opinion anyway).  The Omake Theater was something that first surprised me, then made me laugh out loud.  Character bios were pretty decent, explaining the names and other personality traits.  This set is something I recommend buying.",1027987200,4,1033,4.726256983240224

1719296,5,B000067IVS,"I LUUUUUUUUV this anime. I wish I could give it six stars it's so good. As a matter of fact, this is possibly my favorite show of all time, and I've seen nearly every anime series out there.
The best thing is that this [is a]perfect collection...for all 26 episodes. I have never seen a better deal in my life, with nearly every other boxset out there to date running over a hundred dollars. Ahhh the age we live in, when we used to only be able to buy VHS's with two episodes max. GEEEZ i'm making myself sound like an old man when I'm really a 17 year old girl.
Anyway, I bought this show on a whim because of this cute little boxset being so darn cheap. I was shocked that something so good had taken so long for me to find. I recalled my visits to Video [stores] and seeing a long line of these tapes on the shelves. Then thinking to myself I'll get it next time. Two years later I see this set, decide to buy it, and loved it.
For one thing I love the way it starts off monster of the week (people make it sound like this is a bad thing) and grows to a more complex and involved story. COOL!! shootin down the demon things is always fun to watch. What surprised me the most though was how funny this show is. I was prepared for something more along the lines of, I dunno Boogiepop, Vampire princess Miyu, something kinda gory and dreary. Instead I was treated to lotsa humour. I swear I was falling outta my seat at times. And those Omake theatres were pretty funny too. Especially the ones on the last two discs.
Oh oh oh and don't forget the love story  between the two main characters. Those two make a such a darn cute couple I can't stand it. You want them to hook up so bad, at times, you're ready to sledge hammer the tv . This story is just so involving. Oh the dub is really excellent as well. I mean of course the japanese cast do a great job, can't go wrong with Megumi, but I found myself growing more attached to the english as the show progressed. If you have never seen this show then please, do not hesitate to run out and get it right awy.",1026864000,2,2061,4.101485148514851
1719297,5,B000067IVS,"Blue Seed was my first anime, and is also still my favorite.  The great characters and multi-genre storyline was what drew me into the world of anime.  Everything is so colorful and alive, which is what really gives this series it's sense of meaning. It doesn't take much to get hooked on this inivative story.  If you are like me and appreciate a strong, but understandable storyline Blue Seed will nourish you for all 10.8 hours. The character development is some of the best I've seen so far.  If you have been searching for a fun, unique, and classy anime look no further. Give it a chance, and Blue Seed will ""grow"" on you very quick.",1025136000,2,639,4.482758620689655
1719298,5,B000067IVS,"This is one of my personal favorite animes of all time. It's full of action,romance,and at many times very funny. The story tells of a world where monsters have come about and that only one girl can save the world by killing herself thus, killing the monsters. But if the monsters kill her in a special way (not going to tell) they won't be killed and have no worries of being killed. This anime is rated about PG-13 due to violence,brief nudity,and racy humor. The violence at sometimes is pretty graphic. But the nudity is pretty light,yet, their are many panty shots in it. Yet, their is light R-rated Omake Theater in it which should not be shown to young children. Overall though this is one of the best animes ever made. Trust me, you will love this anime.",1024963200,2,762,4.489208633093525
1719299,5,B000067IVS,"I got this anime almost blindly, going on reviews and brief story summaries, and never really knew what to expect. My fears were put to rest, though, once I saw the first episode. The show is funny and action packed but has enough depth and meaning to keep you interested from beginning to end. There are many correlations between the show and Japanese myths whether important or not which gives the show a bit of mystesism. For the most part it is all about having fun and keeping track of a young girl and her friends who are just trying to leed normal lives amits the chaos and wierd occurances and let's not forget trying to save the world. But important questions arise; Should they really save Japan? Does the human race really deserve to live after everything it has done?
That aside, not only does the show have laugh-out-loud humor but included on each disc is a number of Omake Theaters(which puts the characters in various silly situations in one form or another creating film shorts) are even more funny. Some range from hilarious while rarely others range to just beeing poetic, but there are only one or two of those.
All in all a perfect addition in one's anime collection as it has a mix of comedy, love, and action which are all well ballanced. The only problem is I don't think this is a show for 12 and up as it is rated thusly. The anime has mild language, a touch of blood, brief nudity(panty shots more than anything), and enough sexual inuendo to give it a rating where the minimum age should be a bit older.",1024704000,4,1531,4.4714285714285715
1719300,5,B000067IVS,"I've watched this series through before (on these DVDs) in Japanese with subtitles.  I haven't watched the English dub but I'm familiar with the dub talent and I'm sure they're fine.  The Japanese voice talent comprises some famous Japanese voice actors and actresses, many of which I'm fond of.
Basically, this series is kind of old, early 90's in Japan, but it's a very solid and enjoyable series.  It's about a long-hidden race called the Aragami and their attempt to retake Japan, and a group of people called the TAC who try to prevent this.  At the center of these efforts is a young girl named Momiji who has part of an Aragami fused with her during the first episode.  At the center of the Aragami's efforts are Momiji's sister Kaede and their Lord, Susan-oh.  It also raises questions at points on whether Japan is worth saving, whether humanity is more deserving than the Aragami or not.  I thought times like that in the series were poignant.
I would advise though that the series is about a PG-13 rating in content (the first episode being a bit more risque than the rest of the series in general, though).  The Omake Theater bonus humor bits, however, should be shown to children with caution, as some of them are R-rated in content whereas the series is, as I said, PG-13ish.
I enjoyed the story of this series and the ride I went through watching through it (I didn't own it at the time), and I've been awaiting this boxed set to buy the whole series at a discount.  As of this writing, I'll be buying this collection sometime next week.  I enjoyed it, and you might as well, if any of the content description above made you curious to learn more.  Remember the content ratings I gave though, if you are considering purchasing this for children (or are a child yourself).

7963550,4,B000067IVS,"The life of a teenage girl can be stressful enough, but Momiji Fujimiya is a bit more stressed than usual -- it turns out that evil plant monsters are out to get her. Yes, evil plant monsters.

Fortunately if you can swallow that, most of the rest of this series will be a pretty entertaining ride. While it starts rather shakily (and with a very patchy dub), ""Blue Seed: Complete Collection"" unwinds into a complex anime full of grotesque monsters, teen romance, blam-blam action and international strife as the whole world is threatene, et cetera et cetera. It's fluffy fun, but what sets it apart is a heavy dose of Japanese folklore.

One day on the way to school, Momiji Fujimiya is confronted by two bizarre creatures -- a young man (Kusanagi) with seven ""blue seed"" mitamas embedded in his body, who tries to kill her; and a serpentine plant monster (Orochi). Turns out she's part of an ancient family line, the Kushinada, that can destroy the aragami (sort of plant monsters).

But then Orochi invades Momiji's high school to destroy her, and is barely stopped by the Terrestrial Administration Center (a motley band of scientists, soldiers and government officials). Before Momiji knows it, she's been handed over to Mr. Kunikida of the TAC, and Kusanagi has changed his mind about killing her -- now he wants to protect her, no matter what. Oh yeah, and the Kushinada before her was a twin sister named Kaede, now presumed dead.

And life with the TAC is rarely boring: they fight a bizarre jellyfish, a giant water blob, a grotesque crow, a tree aragami at an idol show (where Momiji song-duels with an American Shinto priestess), mutated dogs, a fire-breathing frog, a building-sized centipede, and a bloodsucking creature that can control people. Then a new trio of enemies appear -- a treacherous Kushinada thought to be dead, a sinister man with eight mitama, and the reborn god Susano-o. As the aragami grow in power and number, Momiji becomes plagued with doubts... and the fear that she will lose everything.

""Blue Seed: Complete Collection"" starts off a little wobbly. Initially the stories are geared towards fighting the aragami-of-the-week, and a some episodes are just ridiculous -- a couple of them actually hinge on a pop idol competition and PANTY-PREDICTION software. Seriously. But the series starts to flower when it returns to the roots of Japanese folklore and legend, complete with kappa, an immortal woman, and a reborn god.

Additionally, as the story becomes more complex and darker, it also brings in an overarcing storyline that stretches all the way to the end. But the writers also keep the main storyline saturated with lighter fare, to remind us that these are people with ordinary lives to live -- a cute little romance between Momiji and Kusanagi, and some fun glimpses at how the various TAC members act around one another. And of course, plenty of explosions, gunfire and messy splattery action scenes.

In the first three episodes, Momiji is as endearing as a cat ice-skating on a blackboard -- she whines almost continuously. Fortunately she becomes a far more likable heroine as the series goes on, grappling with insecurities and worries that seem all too realistic. Kusanagi is a likable counterpart for Momiji: strong, powerful, but still relaxed enough to tease her about her underwear whenever he gets a chance. Of course he's also utterly socially inept, which makes their budding romance a bit more difficult.

And unlike many an anime show, the supporting cast is pretty colourful, even if they sometimes come across as stereotypes (the Genius Loser-Nerd, the Gung-Ho Gun Girl, the Scientist immersed in her work, etc). Fortunately each character is explored lovingly and given their own quirks and weaknesses, making them seem quite real and endearing.

It's worth noting that the English dub for this series isn't of great quality. In fact at the start of the series, it's pretty awful -- Momiji's whine, Kusanagi's toneless yells, and Matsudaira's scratchiness. Fortunately the voice actors get the hang of it a few episodes in, and they're doing a pretty decent job by the middle of the series.

""Blue Seed: Complete Collection"" starts off wobbly in many ways, but it also serves up plenty of monsters, mayhem, and Japanese folklore. Worth seeing, and actually goes from mediocre to brilliant in a short time.",1243900800,,4370,4.965800273597811

This series has almost everything in it, action, adventure, some mystery, comedy, and even romance. Blue Seed shouldn't be underestimated for being an older anime, since it came out in 1995, and was later released by ADV Films in 1997. I really enjoyed going through the 26 evenly passed episodes, the characters were wonderful and memorable, and the ending fits the series well. There isn't alot left hanging, which means this series comes to a satisfying conclusion. The characters are really likable, especially the relationship between Momiji(The heroine), and Kusanagi(...). Momiji is the clumsy but brave girl(Unlike other magical girls), while Kusanagi is the hero who comes to save the day,(...). One cannot help but laugh when he peeps at Momiji's pantys under her skirt, one can get a good kick out of that.
