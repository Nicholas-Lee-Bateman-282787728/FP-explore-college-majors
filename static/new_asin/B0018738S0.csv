Production
- it was short! and 'play' only - no chapters
- the promo I saw on youtube with a montage of his dancing doesn't even appear on the dvd! it's all in the studio, how disappointing...maybe I watched the wrong thing...

Instruction
- hmm...not sure...he did break the steps down, but coming from an area where you get told specifically which muscles to contract, what your posture should be, and what to move where this felt really inadequate. Plus you couldn't even see exactly what he was doing as he was wearing long baggy trousers, t-shirt and long sleeve overshirt. I understand than you might want a 'look' when performing, but for instruction it was not helpful.
-  he says in the beginning it was for all levels, but I think only absolute beginner. After each 'easy' move like a an arm wave or body roll he does a bit of dancing but for show not really to follow from what I could tell. With the 'king tut' (?) he went through 6 very basic positions slowly then whipped through the advanced stuff at lightning speed as if to say 'look what you could do if you were any good'!
- seeing as the dvd was so short anyway, instead of telling us to practice he could have included some drill combinations.
-combination section - again..hmmm...I did like the side kick, he was very funny. He imitated Omar like a shadow and didn't even object when Omar pushed him back into position to go over the `routine' again. I laughed at this bit, but wasn't inspired to get off the couch. I'll try to watch it back and join in next time, maybe that will give me a feel for it all.

I would love to know more about this stuff but not sure I want to risk one of these dvd's again! I'm not sure if it's just this one or the genre that just doesn't work for me? The only one with about 30 good reviews was how to do the robot and it's discontinued (- now i see the reviews are gone and its a video download) A bellydancing equivalent is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pop-Lock-Shimmy-Drum-Solo-Technique-Choreography-Intermediate-Advanced-Belly-Dance/dp/B000W4TBNQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pop, Lock & Shimmy: Drum Solo Technique & Choreography (Intermediate / Advanced Belly Dance)</a>with much clearer, detailed instruction, drills and performance!

8268616,4,B0018738S0,"On some crazy whim I decided to buy this DVD. I woke up one day and thought, ""I wanna learn how to pop"".  I ran across this instructional video and I had a lot of fun watching it.  Seriously, I haven't had the guts to try it because I'm always afraid a neighbor might see me, or my husband might walk in, but the step by step instructions make it very easy to put together what he's doing when he speeds it up.",1213747200,2,410,3.927710843373494
