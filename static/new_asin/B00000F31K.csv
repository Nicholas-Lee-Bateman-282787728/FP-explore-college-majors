1205479,4,B00000F31K,"Perhaps not many of you have noticed that this movie is a ""land-based"" version of a previous film, starring Gregory Peck and Ava Gardner, called ""On the Beach"" (1959).
There too we have a post-nuclear theme, in which all life on Earth has been wiped off the face of the planet, only to leave a few ""desperados"" alive, both on board of a U.S. submarine and on the shores, somewhere near Australia (the last bastion of life... but for how long?).
There too, we have a signal emitted from somewhere, in the northern hemisphere...

Yet, despite all similarities, this movie is a kind of updated version, with fine actors at the helm (although not of the caliber of said actors above) and a very interesting story development.

The difference is that this is less a drama-oriented movie and more an action-adventure-thriller oriented working of the subject.

If one remembers the period in which this movie was made (late seventies), baring in mind that this was a time of overblown ""super-spectacular"" apocalyptic, ""end-of-the-world""-like flics, such as ""Earthquake"", ""The Towering Inferno"" and ""The Swarm"" (probably the last and worst of such movies), one can say that this one differs considerably in both quality and story-development.

I personally like this little ""what if"" effort. No big special effects, except for some stock footage of nuclear explosions, some pyrotechnics and varied color flavors in the sky (supposed to represent the variations in the Earth's atmosphere).

Sometimes, for a movie to be good, you simply don't need millions, just simply a solid story and fine acting. This is certainly a film that makes you think and entertains at the same time.

My only regret is that no one has yet thought of tranferring it on DVD and offer it to us in a more decent and widescreen version. The Pan and Scan one loses out on many ""strange"" environments recreated for this movie. Actually, I wouldn't even call it Pan and Scan, since in many scenes, one just watches nose to nose conversations.

My only hope is that someone at 20th Century-Fox, or at Anchor Bay reads this and may come to the decision to restore it in its original format and deliver a more accurate and complete vision of apocalyptic terror on screen...

**************************

Add-on as per April 21, 2011

Now that it is out in the news that this movie will be released in July of this year, I am glad to say: Finally!
But I wouldn't hold my breath, until I actually get to see this tiny Sci-Fi gem actually released, either on DVD or on Blu-Ray.

Considering the price it is tentatively offered at, I only hope they will both be provided with decent extras, such as a Making-Of and
some commentaries, interviews and the like.

I also hope that the sound will be treated as it should be.

Considering that this movie was filmed with a ""Sensurround"" process of the time, called ""Sound 360"" (as specified on IMDb Pro), I only
hope they have transferred it at least to a decent 5.1 surround stereo for the DVD or a TrueHD 7.1 Master Sound for the Blu-Ray.

Also to be considered is the short, but poignant music score by master composer Jerry Goldsmith, who was rather busy in those years
(the following year, he would compose the score for ""The Swarm"" which closely resembles this one, at least in the brass section).

In fact, if for nothing else, this movie should be bought for Goldsmith's score, completing thus ""the brass years"" (notice that brass
musical effects were also contained in ""MacArthur"", the biopic movie starring Gregory Peck as General Douglas MacArthur).

George Peppard appears in ""Damnation Alley"" in a rather unusual role in his career. Quite different than Hannibal of ""The A-Team"" series
that followed later on. Until then, Peppard used to play ""tough"", unlikeable characters (see ""The Blue Max"" or ""The Carpetbaggers"").
He is not as ""ugly"" in this one, but represents a military ""martinet"" who tries to ""follow the rules by the book"", in a world in which
rules don't apply anymore.

Jan-Michael Vincent is the easy going counterpart, trying to get some fun out of everything he encounters, although it is just all an illusion.
This is probably where he got is future role in ""Airwolf"", together with Ernest Borgnine (""Escape from New York"", ""The Dirty Dozen"", ""Marty"").

The unforgettable Paul Winfield (""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan"", ""Roots: The Next Generations""), playing one of his first major starring roles, as a former security officer in a nuclear silo, who turns to become an indispensable member of this odd team of explorers in their attempt to seek other life signs on the devastated Planet.

And finally French actress Dominique Sanda, as the dame in distress here. She is the weak link of the entire movie. In all honesty, I must say that
she is as flat as can be. Except for some overdone screams, and looking somewhat sad on screen, the lady can simply not act at all.
She's just another pretty face to be ""saved"" by Jan-Michael Vincent.
A far cry, from say, Melanie Griffith in ""Cherry 2000"", who could nuance her looks with her skills as an actress.

In fairness, I must add that being Sanda French, she might have had trouble with the language and therefore might have experienced a sort of ""culture
shock"" when offered the part.

Yet, despite all this, the movie is packed with action scenes, some silly, some others dramatic in nature. As I stated in my previous review the special effects are somewhat primitive by today's standards, but being this more a story oriented movie, rather than just a purely effects saturated
one, one tends to forget such faults after awhile and comes actually to enjoy it.

The best though, as others stated here and elsewhere, is the vehicle depicted in the movie, the Landmaster (revolutionary for its times). It is an actual vehicle, not just a model, built in California by Dean Jeffries at Jeffries Automotives just for this particual movie.
The origins are even more curious. It appears that the initial idea came from a very early project for a Mars Rover (for more information refer to Wikipedia).

There is plenty included in this movie, to make it stand out from all the rest produced at that time.

In my humble opinion, of all the so-called B-movies out there, this is probably one of the most original and ""active"" of them all and sets the pace for other similar movies that would follow (see ""The Mad Max"" series, the mentioned ""Cherry 2000"" and even ""Terminator"").

If the DVD and/or Blu-Ray Disc will manage to see the light of day, and if they will sport some decent extras to accompany the thrills contained in this tiny movie, then I could only highly recommend it as a must buy.

On my part, I have already put it in my basket as a pre-order item (who knows, it might disappear as it came, so better be on the safe side).

Ultimately, it is up to you, the reader of these reviews, to decide whether or not to invest in this product or not. But if you are a true Science Fiction aficionado, you simply cannot afford to miss out on this one.",1048982400,77,7027,4.729132569558102

Ithink though it made it more exciting,there was alot of adventure and danger along there long journey!
i mean have to think can this really happen,i say yes because who know who will drop the next bomb?
When it came out in 1977 i was a little thing not much older then 3,but i happened to see it about 8 years old i watch from my room as my father had it on ,he told me time for bed ,but even at this age i was intriged by sci-fi and horror movies i couldn't take my eyes away from the screen!!
it's a great movie and i think sci-fi fanatics like me should get every chance to see it!!

The movie never really establishes who starts World War III. Although from the graphics showing the initial missile launch it would appear the bad guys were the Soviet Union. Today, most of us are more worried about China than Russia.  Anyway, this movie was better than I thought. By no means, state-of-the-art, but a very good story and well acted.

1205795,5,B00000F31K,"Just finished watching ""Damnation Alley"" released by 20th Century Fox.
I first saw ""Damnation Alley"" at the Midway Park Movie Theater in Camp Lejeune, North Carolina when it was first released back in 1977 - about a year after Star Wars had been released and a year after Ark II had it's first and only season as a Saturday morning post-apocalyptic show set in the 25th Century.
Even now, as I watched this movie again, I'm reminded how much the Landmaster resembled the Ark II.  Only the Ark II never had a missile launcher, just a force field.
Ever since its release, ""Damnation Alley;"" which is based on the novel of the same name by Roger Zelazny, has enjoyed cult status as a post-apocalyptic road trip across an atomic bomb scarred United States.
World War III was a quick little war that started when the Soviet Union launched a preemptive first strike on the United States by using a the break up of an orbital satellite to cover the launch traces.  Even though the missile defense of the United States destroys 40% of the incoming missiles, the damage done by the remaining 60% of the missiles that reached their target is enough to knock the Earth off it's tilt; and not cause a nuclear winter, but cause a bunch of bad weather - along with the creation of giant mutant scorpions and flesh eating cockroaches.
""Damnation Alley"" may sound like a silly movie, but it's the steadfast heartfelt performances of George Peppard, Jan Michael Vincent, Dominique Sanda, and Jackie Earle Haley as the survivors who form a highly functional dysfunctional family unit as they try to reach a safe haven in Albany, New York, which is the only broadcast signal that can be heard anywhere in the United States, or the rest of the world for that matter.

The film is from 1977, the year first Star Wars: IV A New Hope came out, which by the way has great special effects for its time-period.

One day their only surviving housing facility explodes and the men are forced to find a new place to stay.  They head out to east coast all the way from California to find-out who has been sending a radio signal...the scientists believe that they are the only survivors left on the planet...on their way to Albany, NY they run into all sorts of troubles...

The film starts Jan-Michael Vincent and aging George Peppard.  Interestingly, in the film Peppard is smoking cigars and driving an amphibious vehicle, something that he will also do years later in the cult-classic series called The A-team.",1436054400,,932,4.9423076923076925

1206004,3,B00000F31K,"1977 will remain in memory as the year that moviegoers wanted fantasy (""Star Wars"") as opposed to real science fiction offerings, and Jack Smight's (never a director with a real sense of artistic pulse) picture was rushed out (it feels to me) in order to compete at the palace of misnomers known as the Cineplex (a place where some dreams live, but where others just as easily die). And, in truth, ""Damnation Alley"" really isn't very much fun, and its non-mutability towards the architecture of fantasy genre spiraling is one of the great failings of the movie. Also, sadly enough, the narrative doesn't seem to know what it really wants to be, or what it wants to say, and the performances (if we can call them that) suffer deeply as a result. I had hopes for this movie when I ordered it, because I do like real science fiction when it is filmed successfully, and I have much more confidence in rediscovering these older titles more so than I do in anything being offered today. Unfortunately, while ""Damnation Alley"" might be light years better than films such as ""A Boy and His Dog"" or ""Zardoz"", it is difficult to locate the joy that the filmmakers found in putting it together, and therefore a viewer must suffer too as a result of this indirection. Alan Sharp, who has an interesting interview piece in the extras offered on the DVD, seems to me to be nothing more than a hack, and it's no great mystery as to why competent storytellers such as author Roger Zelazny were not welcomed in Hollywood (why Zelazny didn't file suit after seeing what had become of his source novel is beyond me, but since this picture didn't earn back enough audience support at the time, it probably wasn't worth the investment of a good entertainment lawyer to even pursue the matter). ""Damnation Alley"" should have been ideal for late night TV revival showings (there is also an alternate TV print of this title that was aired on the NBC network in the early 80's), but it really has no sense of cinematic shape, or much dramatic momentum for that matter, to keep it interesting. It is clear in looking back at it that 20th Century Fox spent far too much on promoting a movie that didn't have half as much ""idiot appeal"" as the more simplistic ""Star Wars"" picture had. They should have read the script more carefully, that's my opinion. But, to be fair, the giant radioactive bugs are fun to see, but there's not enough of them.
Shout! Factory's typically pristine work is great as usual, offering a great audio commentary track by Paul Maslansky, as well as some information given by the producer about how challenging that the overall creation of the movie really was (no wonder Zelazny was skeptical of working for the movies, as this title really had a tough time at the hands of the studio henchmen, forcing even director Smight out of the way towards the end of schedule and radically transforming the artistic qualities of the first print). Dean Jeffries's piece about the invention of the Landmaster vehicle is exciting as a piece of memorabilia, but it doesn't save the overall film. Sadly, the Jerry Goldsmith score in ""Sound 360"" audio is not preserved for home stereos, which is yet another reason why some movies should be seen as they are meant to be in the movie house setting as opposed to on the smaller scale presentations preserved on home media formats. The Anamorphic Widescreen DVD transfer actually looks quite nice in the 2.35:1 aspect ratio, but again it's not a fun picture, and is certainly no great legacy for the history of 70's science fiction cinema. Nice try 20th Century Fox, but no cigar. C-",1421280000,,3613,4.673469387755102

Personally, however, I didn't like the film.

1206717,4,B00000F31K,"THE STORY: In the near future, World War III erupts, enveloping the earth in a nuclear holocaust. The staggering power of the atomic warheads exploded during the war tilts the planet's axis, causing all manner of horrific storms and other natural disasters. A few years later, an attempt to discover what remains of mankind is undertaken. The tattered remnants of an Air Force missile command outpost in southern California head out into the radiation-scorched wilderness in two mammoth, self-contained all-terrain transports: The Landmasters! Their mission is to locate other scattered bands of humanity and see if any form of advanced civilization remains or if everyone has reverted to savagery. A radio broadcast has been picked up from Albany, New York, so there IS hope! But in order to find out if the signals are being sent by actual living people or if it's just a repeating prerecorded message our brave adventurers will have to pilot their mighty machines through the deadly, diseased heart of DAMNATION ALLEY! Will these fearless explorers succeed or will darker forces - both natural & man-made - wipe out our last, best hope??

THOUGHTS: I barely recalled seeing this flick waaay back when. The huge ATV-RV machines are what stuck in my mind, though I kept getting them confused with the futuristic transport vehicle from the old ""ARK II"" TV show. Same idea, different approach. Anyhow, DAMNATION ALLEY is an enjoyably silly post-apocalyptic guilty pleasure. The visual F/X are barely B-grade though. We're talking Bert I. Gordon-level stuff. Apparently, this wasn't a concern for the film's creators, who must have thought ""why spend lots of money on F/X? It's just a silly sci-fi film, right?"" Trouble is, 20th Century Fox released this the same year as another little film of theirs that you may have heard of: STAR WARS. Whoops! But that's okay. The visuals in this are much in the same vein as a lot of Roger Corman product that was soon to follow. Honestly, the Landmaster vehicles alone make DAMNATION ALLEY worth watching. They are truly awesome. In addition to the Landmasters themselves, there's some seriously macho TV-star power at work within them, too. I mean, how can you go wrong when George Peppard & Jan-Michael Vincent are at the wheel? A good movie for a rainy weekend. Still, I can't help but wonder... where's Airwolf and the rest of the A-Team when you really need them???

THE DVD: Video & audio are okay on this Shout! Factory (who else?!) release. A decent enough transfer but there is some pixelation, especially in dark scenes, and the film has some crush (video noise) as well. On the plus side, it has a solid, well-balanced soundmix. There are several bonus features to round out the package: three behind-the-scenes featurettes, a full-length audio commentary from the producer, the film's theatrical trailer and a TV ad, too. All-in-all, a very respectable, well-rounded package of post-apocalyptic fun. It's good to finally have this gritty 1970's sci-fi gem on home video at last.

Another star of the movie was not an actor at all but the vehicle being driven by them. Again, poor use was made of this actor.

Sadly drinking problems derailed his life in the next decade though.  The rest of the cast is excellent as well. I reject the reviews that say that this was not a good move special effects wise. In fact if you watch one of the documentaries about the movie you see that they did the best they could with the technology of the  time. ANd audiences of thetime were more than happy with the effects as  they had never seen todays effects after all.  Breakthroughs would come via star wars that same year , but this was the best they had and they used the techniques of the time.  Star wars was done by the same studio ironically.  They built a fantastic vehicle for this film.  The movie is based on a even better book but that's often the case. This movie has one of the most chilling scenes ever though in a film. The opening segments in which they launch a nuclear war and you see the missles coming in and the two lead characters are returning fire  from their silo are a horrible reminder of what people daily lived with for decades, the threat of nuclear annihilation! , I don't think that scenario has ever been done better.  The rest of the tilm is a standard adventure film where our heroes travel across the wasteland of neutron bombed cities , (those leave the buildings but kill everyone) and such.  They meet monsters and such and bad humans. The science is of it's day for sure as a nuclear war wouldn't shift the worlds axis.  This is a good flick that the whole family can enjoy. As the heroes are wholesome and there's a clear line between good and evil here. the print of the film is not restored. Some scenes look better than others ,but lines and dirt are not on it. . The film is grainy as it was shot on film and that's they way it looks anyways.  Unless someone restores the colors of this movie this is the best we can hope for.

1206885,2,B00000F31K,"This film was supposed to be the adaptation of post-apocalyptic classic SF book by Robert Zelazny - but it is NOT!

Written in 1967, ""Damnation Alley"" by Roger Zelazny was an excellent SF novella, which was later extended into a short novel and published as a separate book. In both versions it is a very good read and it inspired a lot of later imitations, some of them good and mostly very bad, both in SF literature and in films. ""Mad Max"" series, and especially the second and third film, certainly owe a little bit to this book - and I think even the legendary ""Escape from New York"" was a tiny little bit inspired by ""Damnation Valley"".

In case you don't know the BOOK, here is the beginning of the action. After a nuclear war, United States are left devastated and depopulated. Two pockets of civilization remain - one in California and another around Boston, but they are separated by a mostly radioactive wasteland. In those savage lands there are mutated monsters and the few remaining people form warlike tribes - violent and vicious, but still riding in cars and using firearms. Which makes things worse, is that air and sea travel is now impossible because the climate was so upset by the nuclear war, that there are all the times terrifying storms raging everywhere. Therefore the only way to voyage is by land. Because of radioactivity in the atmosphere, there is also no radio contact.

One day, a lonely traveler comes to California after coming all the way from Boston. Before dying from his wounds he transmits the message he is carrying. Boston is dying from a deadly epidemic. There is vaccin available in California - but somebody must travel all the way through what was once United States to carry it... Those are the first two pages of the BOOK - and what followed made a big splash amongst SF fans when it was published in 1967...

But the adaptation of this story has VIRTUALLY NOTHING IN COMMON with the book, except for the title and the general idea of travel through Unites States transformed in a wild wasteland. Here we have four soldiers, who survived the nuclear war in a missile base in California and who two years after the conflict decide to go and look for other survivors, lured by a radio transmission from Albany, NY.

Not only is the story different from the book, but the travel itself is rather boring and the ending - sorry, SPOILER here - rather anti-climactic and disappointing. Ultimately, in this film almost nothing really happens - except one scene with cockroaches. In all, the first minutes are good and after that we must wait a long time for the cockroaches and then there is a lot of not much for a long time and then it is the end. THE END.

Also, with the exception of cockroaches, the special effects are very weak. The few ""action scenes"" barely deserve that name.

As in the book at one moment a girl will appear, but the French actress Dominique Sanda who plays her clearly doesn't give a s*** and anyway her character is here strictly for nothing.

It is a pity that the scenario is so weak, because three good actors were gathered to play in this film - and their talent is wasted. I always liked Jan-Michael Vincent, but in this film he hardly has a chance to do or say something interesting - and his character is ridiculous. George Peppard's character - an aging Major of US Air Force - is actually quite interesting and good, but once again the scenario doesn't allow him to do much. Finally there is Paul Winfield (remember him as LAPD Lieutenant Traxler in ""Terminator""?) - but his talent is also wasted. Cruelly.

After seeing this film Roger Zelazny was devastated and requested that his name be removed from the credits...

So bottom line, this is a failed and very disappointing film, nothing like the original story and GREATLY inferior to it. Only cockroaches are interesting and it is for them that I give this film two stars. But (assuming that you want to watch it at all) once you watched the cockroaches scene, you can turn as well your DVD player off - there is nothing more of interest until the end.

1207016,3,B00000F31K,"I first saw ""Damnation Alley"" on NBC sometime during the early 1980s.  While the movie was somewhat hokey, it served then as a cautionary tale about what could happen if Man let the nuclear genie out of her bottle.

The movie, based on Roger Zelzany's novel of the same name, differs in one key respect. Instead of a dangerous prisoner offered a full pardon if he can help deliver medicine from Los Angeles to Boston to help ward off a plague, the survivors of a destroyed air force missile complex in Southern California (played by George Peppard, Jan-Michael Vincent, Paul Winfield, and Kip Niven) take off for Albany, New York, which has apparently survived Doomsday intact.  Along their route, they encounter fierce storms, flesh-eating cockroaches, and other hazards. And they do so in giant Landmasters, vehicles designed to handle rugged terrain and even water, and constructed with truck parts that could be available in any junkyard.

""Damnation Alley"" has weathered about as well as another fine Doomsday movie, the made-for-TV classic ""The Day After"", which means that it's still quite a watchable movie.  And in a rather odd footnote to history, 20th Century Fox had more confidence in ""Damnation Alley"" than it did in ""Star Wars"" - a movie I've yet to see.

1st Lieutenant Jake Tanner (Jan-Michael Vincent), an unorthodox Air Force officer, shares ICBM silo duty at an Air Force missile base in California with Major Eugene ""Sam"" Denton (George Peppard). When the United States detects incoming nuclear missiles, Tanner and Denton ""turn the key"" to launch part of the retaliatory strike, initiating Doomsday. After launching their entire arsenal of nuclear missiles, Tanner and Denton witness nuclear devastation rain down all around them.
Two years later, the Earth has been tilted off its axis by World War III, radiation has mutated insect life, and the planet is constantly wracked by massive storms that cover the entire hemisphere. Military order at the base has broken down. Tanner has resigned his commission and Denton is considering going to Albany, New York to find the source of a lone radio transmission. Before they abandon the base, a rocket fuel explosion kills all but four men -- Denton, Tanner, former Airman Keegan (Paul Winfield) and Airman Tom Perry (Kip Niven).
They set out in two Air Force ""Landmasters,"" giant 12-wheeled armored personnel carriers capable of climbing 60-degree inclines and operating in water. They must cross ""Damnation Alley,"" considered ""the path of least resistance"" between intense radiation areas. On their journey, they lose one Landmaster in a storm (which also kills Perry), pick up two survivors, fight a band of crazed, savage shotgun-toting mountain men and encounter mutated ""flesh stripping cockroaches"" in the ruins of Salt Lake City, which eat Keegan alive, as well as a tidal wave set off by earth suddenly returning to its normal axis (admidst terrific energy storms in the night sky) before reaching their destination, a surprisingly intact Albany.

1207220,3,B00000F31K,"If there's one thing that Shout! Factory's splendid Blu-Ray of the 1977 Fox sci-fi flop DAMNATION ALLEY proves, it's that even the bad movies of decades past are infinitely more entertaining than today's cinematic mediocrity. If nothing else, this is a hugely entertaining misfire with one terrific Jerry Goldsmith score.

A troubled production with a reported budget of at least $10 million (a huge chunk of change back in the mid `70s), ""Damnation Alley"" was at one time viewed by its studio as having brighter box-office prospects than another, less expensive film they had in their pipeline: ""Star Wars."" George Peppard, Jan-Michael Vincent and Paul Winfield play Air Force officers living in a bunker after the apocalypse, where the Earth's axis has tilted, causing giant scorpions to roam the deserts and our heroes to drive around in a massive ""Landmaster"" (a cross between the Jawa Sandcrawler and a Winnebago), trying to find any survivors.

Alan Sharp and Lukas Heller adapted a novel by Roger Zelazny for Jack Smight's film, which is only 91 minutes long and shows obvious evidence of post-production tinkering - including an appearance by an uncredited Murray Hamilton, seen in a few shots but uttering not one word of dialogue at the film's beginning (apparently Mayor Vaughn's role ended up almost completely on the cutting room floor).

You can't help but think trying to speed the movie along wasn't a bad idea, however, since even in the finished film nothing happens until 15 minutes in, when Peppard and Vincent finally set out on the wasteland to find survivors Dominique Sanda (of ""Caboblanco"" non-fame) and Jackie Earle Haley, the young thesp coming off his ""Bad News Bears"" triumph the previous year. A hilarious run-in with killer cockroaches, some hugely uneven optical effects, and a rousing finale (complete with a gorgeous Goldsmith climactic cue) end up making for a delectable, dated `70s genre brew for cult movie aficionados.

Shout! Factory has brought ""Damnation Alley"" to Blu-Ray (and DVD) in a simply sublime package. The AVC encoded 1080p transfer preserves the film's erratic visual appearance without any kind of digital noise reduction - making for a satisfyingly unadulterated transfer that looks like real film, warts and all (and there a lot of those given the ramshackle nature of the optical effects). The audio is surprisingly robust, presented in 7.1 uncompressed PCM and 6.1 DTS-MA; whether this has been derived from the movie's original ""Sound 360"" track or was remixed for this presentation, I'm not sure, but it's quite well done.

Extra features add even more enjoyment to the film. Producer Paul Maslansky's audio commentary is highly interesting, with Maslansky talking about the film's shortcomings and revealing all kinds of behind the scenes anecdotes (Maslansky discusses how Goldsmith agreed with him that there didn't need to be music over the nuclear bomb detonation; he also believes that Goldsmith's music was deserving of an Oscar nomination).

1207223,3,B00000F31K,"This is one of those late 70's science fiction films that never had the money for big budget special effects....and it showed. What it did have was some fairly decent acting, one heck of a great and unique vehicle and an interesting soundtrack and some cool, low budget, sky effects.
Basically, Damnation Alley is a road movie. A group of nuclear holocaust survivors travel across the desolated USA on their way, to of all places...Albany. Along the way they pick up a few more survivors and face killer cockroaches, freak storms and other dangers. While the plot is a great idea, the ending is very anticlimactic.

Considering how badly the film did at the box office, its probably a miracle that its on blu ray and has extras. No doubt its the cult fans who have kept this film alive. There are three documentaries on the disc, one is from the creator of the Land Master truck who offers little or no explanation as to HOW he built the truck, only how he got into the business and why he built it. Another is from the original producer who explains a bit of some of the trouble they had in producing the film...fairly interesting stuff. The third documentary is from one of the assistant script writers who laughingly admits he has no idea how this film got into cult status.

If you loved this film back in '77, then you should no doubt add the blu ray to your collection. If you have never seen this movie, but love old science fiction films (and aren't critical about special effects), they you may like this one. Never heard of this film? Well, then you really need to have an taste for the genre before you buy.",1336262400,2,1618,4.48135593220339

1207225,3,B00000F31K,"In 1976, 20th Century Fox spent millions of dollars to produce Damnation Alley and Star Wars. Damnation Alley was the ""A movie"" and Star Wars was the ""B movie"". In 1977, George Lucas' Star Wars was a critical and commercial hit while Damnation Alley flopped and ended up on the double bill of another movie. It was shown on TV in 1983, released on VHS in 1985, and shown on cable TV. For years, some people bought bootleg copies of it on VHS and DVD-R's. Thanks to Shout Factory, we can enjoy a quality DVD version of the film. Damnation Alley is loosely based on Roger Zelazny's 1969 sci-fi novel. In the novel, a convict called Tanner transports a vaccine through post-World War III America. In the movie Damnation Alley released in 1977, Tanner(Jan Michael Vincent) and Denton(George Peppard) are two futuristic soldiers who search for survivors during World War III. They use a Landmaster Tank to travel from California to New York. Along the way, they pick up a woman(Dominique Sanda) and a boy(Jackie Earle Haley). Paul Winfield and Kip Niven play two soldiers who travel to New York with Denton and Tanner. During their trip, they battle giant scorpions, killer cockroaches, and people armed with guns. The producers spent a lot of money on animatronic scorpions that didn't work. They had to resort to old fashioned means such as photographing scorpions near a blue screen and optically putting them on film. The filmmakers did get their money's worth out of the Landmaster Tank. Jerry Goldsmith's epic, energetic, atmospheric music score is an underrated classic. The theatrical version of Damnation Alley was released in ""Sound 360"". This film does have some flaws. There's a lot of corny dialouge and the special effects look clumsy and dated. Damnation Alley was made when sci-fi movies were dark, violent, and depressing. Damnation Alley isn't avant-garde or classy, but it is fun to watch with pizza and beer.",1333411200,,1923,4.92
1207286,4,B00000F31K,"I've been watching this movie whenever it appears on TV for the last 30 years and it brings back floods of memories.

PROs:
American Missile crews conduct WW III against the communist U.S.S.R.
The Landmaster Vehicle (the most bad-ass vehicle until the ""Dead Reckoning"" from George Romero's Land of the Dead)
Mutant cockroaches attack
Playboy magazine centerfolds from the 70s (back when PG-rated films could show breasts)
Trippy 70s special effects (similar to 2001: A Space Odyssey, when Bowman goes through the Stargate)
George Peppard (from the A-Team) gives a great performance
Jackie Earle Haley (the official 70s kid actor)
91 minutes (short for a quick watch--low commitment)

CONs:
Not realistic at all (hence a cult popcorn movie-must use suspension of disbelief)
  --The Landmaster would have ran out of fuel long before their destination
  --Gamma Rays & fallout from the nukes would have fried our travelers
Paul Winfield plays a whiney Security Forces hippy--cops don't spout off about peace and love...

1207289,4,B00000F31K,"Decisions, decision. Damnation Alley has finally made it to DVD and even Blu Ray. No, the story won't be any stronger on dvd. The scorpions in the desert will still look like they came out of a 50's movie. Hissing cockroaches are still hissing cockroaches, but in Damnation Alley they are really tough little bugs and they eat rubber, human flesh, and so on. George Peppard is as cheesy in this movie as in the A-Team which probably followed this movie. Jan Micheal Vincent was one of Hollywood's reigning pretty boys. Ah, the seventies, what with Gregg Allman and the Allman Brothers, Lynyrd Skynyrd, The Marshall Tucker Band, the Pittsburgh Steelers, Charles Bronson and Death Wish, PLAYBOY Magazine, Penthouse, Richard Nixon, the United States Bicentennial in 1976, etc. It was a time for disaster movies like Soylent Green, The Omega Man, Earthquake, The Towering Inferno, The Planet of the Apes sequels, and on and on. In such a backdrop Damnation Alley fit right in. It was the beginning of disco, the Saturday Night Fever movie and soundtrack, the coming of age of the Bee Gees and the brothers Gibb.

If I didn't grab you with the first paragraph then you surely didn't live those years. Me, I was still a kid about junior high age. I thought Damnation Alley was pretty cool and also pretty limited. I always liked the landrover. Jan Michael Vincent was cool as heck, and so was that co-star from the Bad News Bears' movie. I'm not sure of his name. Anyway, I bought this movie on VHS about ten years ago. I remember that I thought it was a pretty bad movie. I judged it for plot and other reality based issues, like where did they get FUEL for this vehicle, drinking water, FOOD and of course, what about the NUCLEAR FALLOUT or RADIATION. Surely after just a couple of years the world was still MASSIVELY radiated an CONTAMINATED. And surely this vehicle was not WATER TIGHT. And how were the slot machines still working in Las Vegas, Nevada? What was the power source? And then there was the happy ending. So much CHEESE and CHILDISH NAIVETE. IF only humans could nuke the world they way they did in this movie and then have the world fairly habitable again after just a couple of years. Yes, the movie is a lot of NONSENSE. But like I said, I grew up in the 70's and this silly flick is a part of my youth and it was a part of my music experience. I missed out on a lot of stuff growing up but I did catch this flick. Is it a bad movie, well yes it is, on many levels. It is also a GOOD MOVIE on many levels. If you are looking for a reality based post nuclear holocaust movie well look to something like The Day After or Threads. Those movies are pretty much on the money. Damnation Alley is PURE ESCAPISM and FANTASY. This is a post nuclear holocaust movie that your children could watch and not have nightmares about. In this movie young girls and women can fall in love with Jan Micheal Vincent who is now about 67 years old, and who nearly died in the late 90's in a drinking and driving accident. Vincent has also been a drunk. The man is down and out. And George Peppard has now left us. We are left with Damnation Alley and The A-Team to remember Mr. Peppard. Yes, he was also in some decent movies as well. But revisit Damnation Alley and consider the context from which it came. Remember this was a low budget movie without convincing special effects. This was certainly not Star Wars. It was not even Logan's Run, both of which came out of the 70's. Take this movie for what it is and it's kinda fun. True, the ending basically SUCKS and it isn't very believable and the movie kinda came to an abrupt ending. But this movie is STILL so much BETTER than so many OTHER movies that came out of the seventies. And remember, Billy Jack and Walking Tall also came out of the seventies. I'm feeling a sense of pride in my 70's heritage just remembering all the great stuff that happened in the 70's. : )",1324771200,16,3918,4.411602209944752
1207290,3,B00000F31K,"For me, one little highlight of traveling from the San Fernando Valley into L.A. via the 101 is seeing a distinctly sci-fi looking vehicle just off to the side of the freeway.  This aging relic is the Landmaster, the featured vehicle in 1977's Damnation Alley.  It took only 34+ years, but I finally saw the movie itself.

Damnation Alley opened in the Fall of 1977, a few months after Star Wars transformed the science fiction film genre.  It represents the tail end of the era that featured a heap of dystopic science fiction movies which would include Planet of the Apes, Soylent Green, Logan's Run, Rollerball and even the comic Sleeper.

Damnation Alley opens with a nuclear war that has completely devastated the Earth, even altering its axial tilt.  Most of the U.S. is now a hostile desert.  In an isolated Air Force base, a few remaining soldiers are living okay until an accident kills most of them.  That leaves George Peppard leading Jan Michael Vincent and Paul Winfield on a road trip from California to Albany, where Peppard believes the remnants of civilization remain.  The means of transport:  the well-equipped all-terrain vehicle, the Landmaster (a second Landmaster and a fourth character are done away with rather quickly).

The trip is along a path that Peppard has labeled Damnation Alley.  Along the way, they will pick up a woman and a kid (Jackie Earl Haley, who would eventually get adult roles such as Rorschach in The Watchmen).  They also most contend with bad things, including mutant cockroaches and some hostile hillbilly (or would it be desert-billy) sorts (one of whom is Robert Donner, who I remember best as Exidor in Mork and Mindy).

Despite the cheesy effects and often wooden acting (or maybe because of it), this film is often a lot of fun, at least till the end when the implausibilities pile on too high.  As one of the late representatives of dystopic sci-fi, it works well enough.",1323475200,2,1927,4.814589665653496

There are plenty of really cool (and sometimes hilariously cheap) special effects such as the psychedelic color shifting skies and the Landmaster vehicle, but other than that, the story falls very short and it all ends up feeling like a made-for-TV movie (especially the lame ending).
The Blu-Ray was really disappointing to me mainly due to the visible compression in the dark/blacks as well as in the orange sky transformation scenes after the bombs drop.  Normally Shout! Factory does a pretty good job on their releases, but this one just doesn't look good at all, and it's very disappointing to see a Blu-Ray with these digital artifacts.  It would be expected on DVD, but in the HD realm I don't expect to ever notice issues like this at all.  I was probably looking a little deeper into the video issues because I just simply didn't enjoy the film that much, but fans of this might not let the mild compression bother them at all since this is probably the best this film has ever looked on home video.  It's just a shame that this release couldn't have been authored better with some higher quality video.

All right, maybe I can.
I have to admit this is a lousy movie....that I love.  But I can see why it would annoy others.  It's shoddy, the special effects are a little one sided (as in, just the sky!), the acting is uneven; the story is basically just a very long road trip with infrequent stops along the way.  If pressed to explain why I love it anyway, I don't really think I can.  It's an intangible thing: preferences, likes and dislikes, one man's art is another man's junk.  Or my favorite analogy: the ugly puppy someone has to love.

From the very start it's a cold kettle of fish, the cavalier way in which Lt. Jake Tanner (Jan-Michael Vincent) and Major Denton (George Peppard) turn their keys and casually send off a retaliatory strike of nuclear bombs.  Even when they're supposedly arguing they can't seem to muster any passion.  That's pretty much the mood for the entire film.  There isn't a great deal of emotion attached to anything they do.  Even when members of their team are killed along the way it's simply business as usual, no burials, off they go....drive-drive-drive, next scene, drive-drive-drive, next scene.....  It's really quite heartless when you think about it.  It's also daffy, and yes, fun.

I've never read the book and this doesn't inspire me to do so, which is probably the harshest condemnation that could be leveled against this movie.  Even so, still like it!  It's going into the collection.",1314057600,,1537,4.682835820895522

Society was different then and so was film making and the way we watched them. I am a big fan of sci-fi/fantasy films and special effects of this era. If you are also, this will not disappoint.

This is in the original theatrical 2:35:1 widescreen format an A+ as I have a VHS to DVD conversion of this film which is fullscreen. Anyone who knows fullscreen it is nothing short of butchering and ruining the scope of a film, ie: (actors speaking to another who is off the screen etc).

This may be a digital transfer but the original film stock was not and it still retains those characteristics. Regardless, I rate the film quality a 10. The Brightness seemed low during the film and since I have an older Philips LCD, this may vary with different TV's and is easily corrected with the brightness control. The case and disc artwork is quality. I personally like extra features (behind the scenes making of the film etc...) 3 are included, 2 are ""the making of"" type and the 3rd is about the landmaster. Shout Factory did an outstanding job!

The disaster plot has been rehashed endlessly through-out the years by Hollywood and although some may find this film cheesy or consider it a Roger Corman style B movie, I find it entertaining and the entire cast are all quality actors of that era that are believable and natural in their roles.

There isn't much story, or structure, or scientific plausibility; entomologists and astrophysicists should definitely check their lab coats at the door. This is an action-adventure film - it's only 'science fiction' by classification and courtesy.
There's a lot to like, though: The pacing of the film is fast and dynamic. The cast are good actors, who are not having to work very hard.

Two years after the third world war and the devastating nuclear holocaust that followed, a rag tag group of survivors led by Commander Major Eugene Denton (George Peppard) set out in search of civilization. Major Denton believes that there are other holocaust survivors living in Albany, because he has been monitoring their radio signals for some time.

Getting to Albany won't be easy for the group; they'll have to brave the one hundred mile wide corridor between the radiation belts known as ""Damnation Alley"" Fortunately for the group Major Denton spent his time at the military installation constructing two armored plated Landmaster vehicles that will carry them across the desolate wasteland to Albany. Will the Landmasters make it through Damnation Alley? Are there really other survivors living in Albany? You'll have to buy your own copy to see how this post apocalyptic cult classic ends.

Like other fans of this 1977 cult classic, I've waited for ""Damnation Alley"" to finally be released on DVD and after watching it last night; I'm a little disappointed with the picture and sound quality. I really thought the picture and sound quality from Shout factory for this long awaited DVD release was going to be spectacular, but it isn't.

The video transfer for the most part is pretty decent, although the picture does suffer from some noticeable grain and embedded artifacts here and there; not bad enough to ruin the viewing experience. I'd rate the video transfer about 7/10 because it's apparent no real picture restoration was done by Shout other than the standard digital remastering process.

There are three sound options for the movie but sadly the original sound 360 used in theaters isn't one of them. I watched the movie on a 50"" Plasma and listened to the movie in 5.1 Dolby Digital surround sound on my home theater system and it sounded really good. Despite the lack of complete picture restoration and missing Sound 360 option, this is probably the best ""Damnation Alley"" will ever look and sound; unless it goes through a major restoration process. Despite some very minor flaws I've mentioned, Shout! should still be commended for their efforts. Thanks!

1207363,3,B00000F31K,"It was damned from the beginning. Based on Roger Zealzny's novel of the same name (although Zealzny immediately disowned it and it happened to be one of his least favorite novels as well)with an original screenplay (much rewritten)by Alan Sharp (""Night Moves"", ""Rob Roy"")and directed by TV and film Jack Smight (""The Illustrated Man"", ""Frankenstein: The True Story"")""Damnation Alley"" is a guilty pleasure--a big budget ""B"" movie if there ever was one, the film is, at turns, absurd, enjoyable and down right silly.

I have fond memories of ""Damnation Alley"" but it falls into the category of movies so bad it's good. Featuring ""B"" movie star Jan Michael-Vincent, George Peppard (with the most outrageous accent one can imagine), Paul Winfield (the token African-American who is killed), Jackie Earl Haley and giant killer cockroaches, it's been a long road for ""Damnation Alley"" to arrive on DVD and Blu-ray but it was well worth it.

This deluxe edition from Shout Factory gets it right for the most part. Although the film doesn't quite get the deluxe restoration that most fans would want, this is a fine looking transfer. That's not to say it's flawless--reel cues (something you rarely see in hope video transfers today)are evident and there is a large piece of bit of dirt in one of the bits of stock footage shown for the missile launches that should have been cleaned up but, otherwise, the film looks pretty good. Keep in mind this is a 70's film and as a result the image quality can be a bit dicey at times primarily due to all of the process/visual effects shots throughout the film.

The Sound 360 isn't here (evidently the audio tracks are in very poor shape and some no longer exist)but this is probably the best we'll ever see the film on home video and fans should be thankful that Shout did as exceptional job as they have here. The Dolby Surround 5.1 mix though does have considerable kick.

We get a good commentary track from co-producer Paul Maslansky although the most honest and direct assessment probably comes from screenwriter Alan Sharp in one of the featurettes ""Survival Run"". Sharp discusses being brought on board the project to primarily punch up the dialogue and notes changes to the structure that he would have made if it had been his script from the beginning.

Dean Jeffries who designed the Landmaster talks about the design of the vehicle which I used to see by the freeway at Jeffries Automotive on Cahuenga Blvd sitting along side the vehicle that he designed for the ""Logan's Run"" TV series--which IS coming to DVD on Demand from Warner Home Video you'll have to go to their website to order it)waiting for someone to finally appreciate the ultimate monster truck.

Jerome Zeitman discusses the trials and tribulations of making the film in ""The Road to Hell"" including the fact that he had originally approached his filmmaking partner visual effects wizard Douglas Trumbull (""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""Blade Runner"", ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and director/visual effects artist on ""Silent Running"")to work on the project. Trumbull noted that it would take a good two years to create the technology to create the visual effects but Zeitman couldn't wait since he had a green light and budget from Fox.

As others point out ""Damnation Alley"" was thought to be the big summer movie for Fox and that ""Star Wars"" was going to be lucky to make back the money invested in it. Ironically, the film is regarded as a classic although not in the same category or way as ""Star Wars"" but its failure at the box office wasn't a surprise given what we saw on screen but it's still enjoyable for what it is--a diaster movie that, well, turned out to be a bit of a disaster itself.

I still enjoy ""Damnation Alley"" (and saw it twice in theaters just because I enjoyed it's ""B"" movie badness)and am happy that the film has finally gotten the release it deserves. Fans that appreciate it for other reasons will also be happy that this has finally gotten an offical release on DVD/Blu-ray. It's so bad it's good.",1310428800,4,4046,4.778254649499285

Throughout the following years after my childhood and beyond, I still remembered this film, yet I could not for the life of me remember what the title was.  It wasn't until just last year in 2010, that I was surfing through some Youtube videos when I stumbled across one entitled ""Damnation Alley.""  I started watching and cried out, ""Holy cow, this is the one I saw when I was a child and had been looking for all these years!""  I was so thrilled, and,  found it still as entertaining as it was back then.
  The first half of film is absolutely superb.  I always thought ""The Day After"" was the first nuke film to ever show the actual exhange taking place.  Although I found the one in ""The Day Afer"" to be more intense, the exchange in this film is not that far behind and was done quite nicely. Then, after the war, it flashes to two years later where the entire planet has been devastated, and glowing, hideous, if not demonic, red skies now envelope the entire globe.  Seeing this, along with Jerry Goldsmith's riveting, haunting musical score, added a truly gripping feeling and I felt that this was one of the main highlights of ""Damnation Alley.""  Perhaps, though, the best scene in the entire film was how The Landmaster vehicle is finally unveiled.  Both Jan Michael Vincent and Paul Winfeld are sitting around, discussing a major disaster envolving fire that has just happened on the military complex that has pretty much become there seemingly permenant home.  Then, huge doors of one of the main buildings opens, and, as Jerry Goldsmith's haunting, yet somehow triumphant score strikes up again, we see the completed Landmaster making it's victoriously magnificent stride out.  This scene, I thought, was so wonderfully filmed.  The Landmaster was almost like a mechanical savior that was the one ticket out of trapped situation that all the men were in. (You really can't get too far on either horseback or foot when surrounded by desert scorched, nuclear wasted land.) A very superbly shot scene.
  As the film continues on, we see the few adventurers leave the complex in The Landmaster vehicle and encounter giant scorpions and cockroaches infesting ruined cities as well as a few ragged survivors.  However, it's about at three-quarters of the way through the film that things start to get quite unbelievable, if not down and out hokey.  You think that Roland Emmerich has numerous scientific fallicies in his films?  Well, if you think so, then you haven't seen Damnation Alley.  It's explained in the movie that the reason why the skies are red and the weather has gone haywire is due to the fact that the Earth has been tilted on it's axis due to the nuclear war!  LOL!  That's like saying you can bring down Mount Everest with numerous firecrackers!  I don't care how many nukes you detonate. They would NEVER be able to knock the Earth off it's axis and if the Earth was even slightly off it's axis, we would all be dead.  Then, at the end of the film, they find a whole slew of survivors that are living in beautiful farmland, seemingly untouched by any radiation or damage!  What?  I thought it was an ALL OUT nuke war, not localized!
  Well, anyway, despite these and a few other flaws and plot holes, this is still a very enjoyable movie and, quite frankly, I find the movie very symballic of today's world.  The greedy, crooked politicians, the bad economy, the kids killing and bullying other kids, could easily by symbolized by the rad-roaches and scorpions of the wasteland and the angry acrid skies could easily reflect the angry, hatefilled and immoral attitudes that sadly prevail in the world today.  In fact, everytime I leave my house, I feel like Jan Michael Vincent leaving in the Landmaster and venturing out to face the harsh wasteland of the world today.

  All in all, though, this is a film that is definitely worth seeing.  Enjoy!",1307577600,5,4144,4.716272600834492

1207422,3,B00000F31K,"It's too bad the film didn't match the book, but that's Hollywood for you. I suppose it's O.K.,after reading the book (which I did AFTER seeing the film)it would seem that the protagonist in the book was a perfect fit for Kurt Russell.
I DID however, like Jan-Michael Vincent's representation in the film. Besides ""Buster and Billie"" (which I thought was J-MV's best film), he did a pretty good job. So too, were George Peppard's and Paul Winfield's portrayals, as well as the job done by a very young Jackie Earle Haley (Dominique Sanda's role was reduced to window dressing, punctuated by the occasional scream).

The problems outlined by other reviewers are all correct, as this film was ""Movie of the Week"" on TV for quite a number of years. I, myself had a VHS copy of a TV recording for so long, the resolution degraded badly from overuse.

This film, being made in the 70's, has the look and feel of other films from that era. The science of the film is now so dated, it all seems surreal by today's standards. Let this not sway you from seeing it, though, it was pretty good for it's time.

The one actor I found engaging was Jackie Earle Haley. For a kid with so much talent, I hadn't seen him in anything from then until his role in ""Little Children"", as a pedophile, of all things! Which is a little coincidental, as Patrick Wilson, who was also in ""Little Children"", played a pedophile in ""Hard Candy"".

The one ""character"" glossed over was the vehicle used in the film. This beast was a one-off creation made specifically for ""Damnation Alley"". Articulated in the middle, it must have been difficult to drive, and noisy, too!

This film is one of those you never get tired of watching (provided you liked it in the first place), even though you know what happens.",1258848000,6,1776,4.554858934169279
1207423,2,B00000F31K,"I've long had an interest in exploring those halcyon days of science fiction film-making, before STAR WARS and it's sequels and imitators took over the genre almost completely, ending the wonderful decade before with its intelligent characters, thought-provoking story lines, and emphasis on speculation over laser blasts.  I know, that's a bit of hyperbole - but I really do think that back when SF wasn't a guaranteed sell, more chances were often taken, and an adult appeal was looked on as a good thing.

Sadly, DAMNATION ALLEY is not a good representation of that kind of quality, ""smart"" science fiction.  Belonging to one of the hoariest and most overused sub-genres (even in 1977), the post-apocalyptic survival movie, it tells the tale of a couple of Army officers (Jan-Michael Vincent and George Peppard) who take a couple of armored and armed (with rockets, no less!) bus-sized ATVs on a cross-country trip from the desert southwest to Albany, New York - the only place that they can get a radio signal from 2 years after the bombs fall.  Interestingly enough, Peppard and Vincent happen to be the two guys who turned the keys and launched the American retaliatory strike, which we see in the opening minutes (loads of stock footage, as is nearly all of the special effects work) - but this is never mentioned again and in fact the film completely ignores politics and any kind of moral questioning for a PG, Disneyish adventure mode.

In fact one of the oddest things about the film is the mood, consistently closer to ""high adventure"" or a weekend in the country than to fighting for survival.  When early on one of the original four members of the expedition (Kip Niven) dies it's acknowledged in about 15 seconds; when a second crew member (Paul Winfield) gets eaten by giant scorpions (which look more like beetles) it isn't mentioned at all!  Eventually we have to have the token female (Dominique Sanda, beautiful but completely wasted) and adolescent (Jackie Earle Haley looking totally normal as an adolescent), a run-in with some crazed mountain men types (the leader of which group reminded me of Harry Dean Stanton and should have been played by him), a moment of near-destruction or two, and finally a deliriously improbable and ridiculous happy ending.

This was filmed in Cinemascope and with a budget of 17 million which may seem like very little now but in 1977 was pretty high for a genre film and about double that of STAR WARS.  The money wasn't well spent.  Plodding, predictable, poorly-acted, directed as if it were a low-budget TV production by Jack Smight, with ludicrous effects throughout (ooh, color filter skies! poorly blue-screened giant bugs and lizards!), and desert settings that were chosen I think more for their cheapness than for their beauty, this makes the previous couple of years' A BOY AND HIS DOG and LOGAN'S RUN look like masterpieces.  Only for the sci-fi completist I'm afraid, or for those who just have a hankering for some bad-movie cheesiness.  I could enjoy it a bit on those levels, which is why it's a ** film and not a *.  The old pan-and-scan VHS doesn't do the film any favors either, though I seriously doubt that it will be improved all that much if/when a widescreen DVD is made available.",1256169600,4,3260,4.852252252252252
1207424,3,B00000F31K,"This movie , along w/The Island (Michael Caine), should be made for DVD viewers!  Damnation Alley reminds you of the Irwin Allen thrillers from the seventies.

George Peppard is the leader of the recon team.  The basic mission is to look for food, water, habitable land, and any survivors.

  The special effects are par for the times, I wish someone would remake this film considering FX development today, along w/Fantastic Voyage.  Damnation Alley reminds me a little bit of Lost In Space, Planet of the Apes, Omega Man (without the mutants), and Andromeda Strain, all rolled into one film.

It has been described as being loosely based on the book and although Zelazny pulled his name from the credits because it was a bit too far off the mark for him, you can still recognize it as such.
