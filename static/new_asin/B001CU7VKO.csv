3520007,5,B001CU7VKO,"I enjoyed the DVD, really old stuff on the DVD.  I guess I am getting old.",1408838400,,74,3.625
3520008,4,B001CU7VKO,Loved some of the performances but the master of ceremonies and his two so-called comedians take up way too much time in this video.  Amos Milburn does a great number and Duke Ellington is classy.  There are several other musical highlights.  Keep the remote handy to fast forward past the comedy routines!,1402012800,,306,4.846153846153846

3520010,4,B001CU7VKO,"My mother really enjoyed watching this and telling us about all of the entertainers.  Some I was familiar with, but others like Ruth Brown I was not.  I wish it could be restored to show clearer, but it is a treasure.",1388275200,,217,4.2682926829268295
3520011,5,B001CU7VKO,"It was like I, was at the Cotton Club myself, entertaining,a lot of showmanship from great entertainers. I love the comdey skit with the man buying the cigarettes, now that's how store clerks got rob back in the day.",1386979200,,216,4.564102564102564
3520012,3,B001CU7VKO,"This is principally an old time vaudeville show. Good for the period. MC is a bit much, always there, with chatter.",1374364800,2,115,4.523809523809524
3520013,5,B001CU7VKO,"Check out ""Rhythm and Blues Revue"" it is captured in very good quality; keep in mind that the original does need a rerstoration effort. Sara Vaughan's performance gets a bit grainy at the end.

8289330,5,B001CU7VKO,"Great talent and interesting historically.  People I had never heard of, and who knew the moon walk (and some other crazy moves) were invented so long ago.  The comedy routines, dancing, singing, and playing were just enormous fun.",1495324800,,231,5.052631578947368
8289331,2,B001CU7VKO,"Although this allowed me to see a number of entertainers doing their thing, no one was particularly enjoyable. It is a movie I won't watch again.",1486252800,,145,4.615384615384615
8289332,5,B001CU7VKO,So much to learn from this video!!!!!!,1483574400,,38,4.571428571428571
8289333,4,B001CU7VKO,"Some, if not all, is studio. The fake curtain drawing and the same audience shot (played both normally and reverse) only distract slightly. The music is great. Some acts are way better than others, and the smoking singer seemed very in love with himself or his image and seemed ill-placed with the others (more suited to L. Welk than an r 'n' b revue). I liked it a lot.",1482624000,,370,4.3768115942028984
8289334,5,B001CU7VKO,"Performances by greats , Count Basie, Lionel Hampton, Sarah Vaughn, and many more .. need I say more?",1469923200,,101,4.666666666666667

8289336,5,B001CU7VKO,"This movie is stacked with great live performances like Sarah Vaughn, Big Joe Turner, Lionel Hampton, Nat King Cole and so many others. Thank goodness it is here on Amazon because I have never seen it any where else. My favorite was Amos Milburn singing Bad Bad Whiskey. I love that song but never knew who the original performer was, great find. BTW, when the dancer at 13:00 did the Moon Walk made famous by MJ in his tap routine I was like WOW, that step has been around a LONG time.",1444953600,2,486,4.293478260869565
