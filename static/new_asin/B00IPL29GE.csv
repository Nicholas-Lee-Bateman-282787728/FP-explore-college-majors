8644510,3,B00IPL29GE,"I can't speak to the print here as I streamed this film on my television . The print I watched , like the film itself , was just adequate . As a BIG fan of all things Amicus and Hammer and British horror in general , this was a must watch for me after having read about it in Little Shoppe Of Horrors (volume # 20) . I love Freddie Francis's films but went in knowing this was not one of his finer efforts . That written , I enjoyed the cast and story enough to see it through . Pleasant rainy afternoon affair for us retro Brit horror completists .",1496448000,,549,3.954954954954955
8644511,2,B00IPL29GE,"The movie itself was good having a dependable cast and the screenplay written by the great Robert Bloch. However, the presentation leaves much to be desired. This must be a bootleg company since this comes from a German print which has not been cleaned up. The opening and credits are written in German while the actual film is in English. The print suffers from dropouts, splices, and other imperfections. So, if you can look past this then you may actually enjoy the film.",1480464000,2,474,4.72289156626506
