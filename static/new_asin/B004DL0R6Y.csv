8425596,5,B004DL0R6Y,"I just watched this documentary yesterday and liked it very much.  I have read a number of books on the physics of the atom in the first half of the 20th Century, everything from those who studied radioactivity from the late 1890s on (the Curies, e.g.), those who studied the structure of the atom (Rutherford, Bohr, etc.) and those who did research that led to the atomic bomb (Meitner, Hahn, and the Manhattan Project people as well).  I thought that this would be little more than a review of what I knew.  But I did learn a good deal more.

I knew that Hahn and Meitner had long worked together and that she had fled Nazi Germany after the Anschluss (Austria being annexed into Germany).  The subsequent story of how Hahn bombarded uranium and produced barium and how Meitner and Frisch (who was her nephew) calculated that the uranium atom had been broken into two large pieces was told very well in Frisch's autobiographical ""What Little I Remember"".  Sitting on a log in Sweden at Christmas time 1938 the two of them calculated that that breakup would lead to a lot of energy being released, FAR more than any chemical reaction could do.  That was the beginning of the atomic bomb programs in Germany, Great Britain, the US, and even in Japan.

This documentary gives a lot more detail on how things led up to that finding and also the life of both Hahn and Meitner from the time they first met to when they died in 1968.  It covers the Nobel Prize being awarded to Hahn and Strassman and Meitner being left out and the reasons why that probably happened.

If you want to learn more I might recommend Frisch's short autobiographical account (mentioned above), the biography ""Lise Meitner, a life in physics"" by Ruth Sime (who appears a lot in the documentary) and also ""The Making of the Atomic Bomb"" by Richard Rhodes.  This is a very nice documentary, one that will get you started.",1428192000,,1891,4.5816023738872405
8425597,4,B004DL0R6Y,"Hi all. This documentary was very interesting to watch. I think that it would make a good addition to the library of anyone researching the history of nuclear technology. It has opened my eyes up a bit more to the truth of the story, and I may soon purchase another one about Admiral Rickover. The story of nuclear technology is a broad one and this documentary has information that is not really covered in the general others.",1425859200,,427,4.558441558441558

8425600,5,B004DL0R6Y,"Great story, love the atomic stuff.  Too bad we treated women of science so poorly.  That must have been a rough life.",1410912000,,118,4.318181818181818
8425601,5,B004DL0R6Y,A great documentary showing the contributions made by Lisa Meitner in the early days of nuclear physics.  A woman who had to work in the prejudices of the day against women and later in Germany as a woman of Jewish descent.  Shows how her contribution to the discovery of nuclear fission was taken by a co-worker as his own even when he won the Nobel prize.  The documentary also shows the humanistic side and why she did not work when offered with the USA on the Manhattan Project.  Watch this movie and learn about a woman who helped change the world by her love of science.,1376956800,2,576,4.40566037735849
