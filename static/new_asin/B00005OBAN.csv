1640871,4,B00005OBAN,"Radical Jack was a straight to video release it is basically a clich-fest, a mysterious drifter, a guy who controls the whole town, a guy who dates a hot babe against her will. The only thing left is for the hot babe to fall for the mysterious drifter. Oh wait that does happen, now our hero is a marked man.

As far as B grade movies go, this one is pretty good, the actors are good looking, the acting is fair, the dialogue is cheesy, the fight scenes are atrocious and the background scenery spectacular. All of which makes Radical Jack a top-notch B grade movie reminiscent of days gone by, this movie would have done extremely well on the drive in circuit in the sixties and seventies.",1259712000,,690,4.390625
1640872,5,B00005OBAN,"Nice little movie, starring Billy Ray Cyrus and DeDee Pfeiffer.  Not much of a storyline, but fun to watch!",1190160000,,107,4.631578947368421
1640873,5,B00005OBAN,"I bought this movie straight out.  I tell everyone if they love Kurt Russell action movies they will love this movie.  Billy Ray Cyrus shows he can play a character that is charming and wholesome but can turn around and be absolutely cutthroat take-no-prisoners.  Those who love action will enjoy the movies explosive finale, and those who love drama will love the bar showdown, and the love triangle.  Who ever you are, watch this movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Even if you can't stand Billy Ray Cyrus' music, and you may not be a fan of DOC, you will love this movie!  Even if you do love him and DOC, you will love it too.",1020729600,11,628,4.612612612612613
7948698,5,B00005OBAN,I watched just about all the HD movies with action and violence. I decided to uncheck the HD option. So I watched a 4:3 that also wasn't 5.1 surround sound. The story was to my liking. There was adequate action and violence. There was lots of punching and kicking. There was lots of shooting and explosions. There was chase scenes. Beware: there was actual romance.,1517097600,,365,4.630769230769231
7948699,1,B00005OBAN,"Predictable, boring plot, with pointless nudity and one dimensional characters delivering lines that make ""Commando"" look like Shakespear...",1515283200,,140,6.833333333333333

not horrible acting, not great either way.  no character development, very contrived and implausible plot, weak special effects

but hey, it passes the time",1511740800,,202,4.882352941176471

7948704,4,B00005OBAN,"Milly Cyrus Dad did a a good and believe it or not an exciting job in this movie. This is a true sleeper for those of us who like action , romance and comedy - the acting ( except for Billy Ray ) was just OK . The movie arrived on time",1371859200,,235,3.5384615384615383
7948705,5,B00005OBAN,"All I can tell you is that this film deserves more awards than it received which was none.  I would give it the ""best movie ever made with a has been country star"" ever award.",1363046400,3,175,4.0
7948706,4,B00005OBAN,"I got this movie because I actually had a small part in it.  I believe it was direct to video, so I wasn't expecting any Oscar performances. Billy Ray actually did a reasonable job, but some of the acting was a little hit or miss. Aside from some rather unbelievable situations, fun to watch.",1320364800,,292,4.407407407407407
