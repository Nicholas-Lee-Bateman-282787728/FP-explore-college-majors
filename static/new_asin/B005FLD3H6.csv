4682197,5,B005FLD3H6,"OK, so I don't actually own this disc, yet. I saw Gary, twice, in his hard rock heyday, my favorite Gary. Gary isn't a great singer? Neither was Hendrix. Gary is fatter?
Yeah, and? When people think of Hendrix they think guitar. When I think of Gary I think guitar, period. In his hard rock heyday there wasn't a guitarist alive I would have
taken over Gary. Not Blackmore, not Schenker, not Eddie Van Halen, etc. It's not a question of being better than those guys, I loved how Gary played. I loved his passion,
his attitude on guitar, his ferociousness. He played like the ship was going down. And he had some serious guitar chops. Listen to his work with Colosseum II.
I love Gary's blues stuff but his hard rock playing does it for me. I'm sure this disc kicks butt. It's Gary Moore!",1325376000,8,787,4.397260273972603

4682201,5,B005FLD3H6,"I first saw Gary Moore 35 years ago when I was 13, on a show on the BBC called sight and sound playing with Colosseum II and it inspired me to play the guitar and to this day he inspires me so much in my playing.  Some of my happiest concert memories where in the 80's seeing Gary Moore (saw him 3 times in 6 days on the Run for Cover tour) and a fixture then for him was the presence of Neil Carter.

Fast forward 35 years and guess what I am fatter and have grey hair, this Blu-Ray has brought back so many happy memories and to have him playing with Neil Carter is a blessing.

Just enjoy the music and forget everything else and just feel blessed that a guy like this has been able to share his music with us.

4682202,5,B005FLD3H6,"I understand the reviews who commented on Gary's weight gain and his voice not being at his best but the man is still one of the best guitarists of all time and that skill is on full display here! I throughly enjoyed seeing the master play again and on this blu-ray we get treated to some songs he hasn't played live in over 20 years PLUS 3 brand new songs! Two of the new songs are good works in progress and one is awesome!

I'm going to miss Gary Moore, no question about that but I am so glad Eagle Rock has released this DVD and Gary's other performances at Montreux. I treasure all of those DVDs as well as this blu-ray.

The video and sound are great here. I have a 5.1 home theater set up and this blu-ray sounds and looks excellent.

The bonus tracks are 4 songs that were edited out of his 1997 performance on The Definitive Montreux Collection DVD set (another AWESOME DVD set!). That set contains his performances from 5 different years and some of the duplicated songs were edited out to fit on 2 DVDs. It's nice to have these 4 performances added on to this blu-ray.",1316649600,23,1080,4.284313725490196
4682203,5,B005FLD3H6,"I must agree with the other reviewer that challenged Gary's voice on this performance. But in my humble opinion his voice was bad because his health was obviously , obviously bad. Goodness... I love this artist, and I can't believe his friends, loved ones, and management let him put on such an enormous amount of weight around his mid section without getting him to a doctor?  His heart attack is no shock given these images and they frankly make it very hard for me to enjoy this DVD with the near future heart attack in the back of my mind. Sure I love his playing...like the return to some less frequently recorded repertoire and LOVE the new songs....and anytime Gary Moore is playing a Les Paul and I can watch I'm a happy boy. The bonus footage from 1997 shows how dramatically his weight had ballooned and even in the superlative concert Blu Ray for Phil Lynott&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gary-Moore-Friends-One-Night-in-Dublin-A-Tribute-to-Phil-Lynott-Blu-ray/dp/B001UGIRS0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gary Moore & Friends: One Night in Dublin - A Tribute to Phil Lynott [Blu-ray</a>] Gary was showing an expanding waist line and really sweating up a storm!

Due to the great playing and the low price I have to keep this a five star rating even though its with a heavy heart that I watch it. Any fan of Gary's will want this....but be warned...its a mixed blessing for such an amazing artist to be shown in this state in all its Hi Definition glory.

RIP Gary Moore...a true guitar hero, terrific songwriter and musicians musician.",1316563200,8,1588,5.1953125
4682204,5,B005FLD3H6,"I watched this today after having it for 5 days but being way too busy to watch it. All I have to say is may this guitar god rest in peace. The video above I got off ebay is the Japanese release that came out first. It has the DVD and two CD's. The UK and US release come out next week. All I can say is this is 5+ stars! One of the best videos that I have really enjoyed. It is 13 songs with 4 bonus songs for a total of 17 songs and two hours of great guitar work. I haven't seen so much heart in soul in playing since the late great Stevie Ray Vaughan passed away. I learned about Gary in Okinawa, Japan in 1982 while I was in the Marine Corps. If you love great guitar, or Gary Moore I would highly suggest you pick this up next week when it is released here.

4682234,4,B005FLD3H6,"Having seen Gary's excellent DVD of Jimi Hendrix songs, I was excited to get this show.  Gary does not disappoint.  His playing is passionate and his technical ability is outstanding.  It was nice to see him play some acoustic guitar on Johnny Boy.  His band is tight and they seem to be having fun onstage.  If you are reading this, you probably already know that this is the last filmed show of Gary.  He certainly bows out with a good one.

4682248,4,B005FLD3H6,Really good but kind of sad at the same time. I wouldn't say Gary was at his very best here but that said...he's still better than 99.9% of the guitarists out there.

4682253,4,B005FLD3H6,"I love Gary Moore, and I was very sad when he passed being still on his prime. I was also very lucky to see him live with jack Bruce and Ginger Baker, and I was amazed at what he could do with the instrument.
Therefore, I set myself on a quest to see everything he recorded on video, and to own every piece of music he put out. This video is most likely for true fans, because you get to see the late Moore at Montreux in 2010, and some extras of a previous show at the same venue. It is very hard to tell the difference between the two in terms of playing quality. His tone was beyond this world, and his singing was very particular and touching. I give this film 4 stars without hesitation, but I warn casual viewers and not loyal fans to Moore that this may not be your cup of tea. There are other videos of him that are considered better, at least for starters.",1410912000,3,865,4.064327485380117

4682267,3,B005FLD3H6,"I'm not typical of people who would buy this DVD.  I've played guitar for more than three decades and always knew Gary Moore was out there and considered a fine guitarist, but I rarely heard much of his music, and what I did hear didn't have much impact on me.  But lately, with so much concert footage coming out on DVD, including Blu-ray, I've been building up a collection.  It made sense to get something from Moore, and I went with this particular concert because of the strong reviews.  So I didn't come to this as a Moore fan, just a fan of guitar.

Verdict?  The positive side is that Moore is definitely a great guitarist, with chops and passion galore.  But the negative side for me (it's subjective) is that I frankly find most of the songs to be rather simple and even boring.  While he was a great guitarist, I don't think he was a great composer, and that might help explain why he didn't achieve the acclaim of people like Hendrix, Page, Van Halen, Beck, etc.

In contrast to this, I did find some footage online where Moore plays blues and Hendrix songs, and there he really shines.  So my conclusion is that, while this DVD may be great for Moore fans, people in my category may prefer his performances where he plays the music of others, several of which are apparently available on DVD.  Combining great songs with Moore's playing is definitely potent!",1404086400,2,1371,4.510121457489879
4682268,5,B005FLD3H6,"I remember hearing Gary Moore for the 1st time when I was very young. 'Cold Day in Hell' is not here but hearing him play live is such a privilege. 'Still Got the Blues' is nothing short of a spiritual experience, drunk or sober. People can say what happened to him, him dying before his time, was a waste of talent. I disagree. There were plenty who picked up a guitar because of him. He was very influential. And Moore continues to live in his music. This set will go perfect in my library with Rory Gallagher & Joe Bonamassa.",1400198400,,528,4.29
4682269,5,B005FLD3H6,"I find this a very emotional concert to watch. Yes, Gary was heavy (obvious signs that he was not well) but as far as performance goes, I see this as a man playing like his life depended on it. Watching the final song PARISIENNE WALKWAYS it gets really intense as the camera pans the audience who are hanging on every heartfelt note Gary is playing. The video captures as close as humanly possible to showing how Gary's music affected people. He's been gone a bit over three years now but thankfully there are some DVDs and BLU RAYS of his amazing body of work. I watch parts of this on a weekly basis and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys passionate playing... Rest in Peace Gary.. You are so missed.....",1396310400,3,714,4.416666666666667

4682313,5,B005FLD3H6,"As a life long fan of Gary Moore, Let me say Live at Montreux 2010 is one of Gary's finest performances. His Playing, his voice, and the tightness of the band is spot on.
The proof is in the pudding, watch and listen to the  audience you can see it in their faces and hear it in their voices.

I have read some of the other reviews and I was appalled that some would fault Mr. Moore for getting old!
Talking about the weight gain and voice not as good.
Let me say getting old is part of life and some of our bodies handle it differently.
Some loose all their hair, some put on wait in our middles, some our voices change. Shall I go on?
On that note I have been a fan from the beginning Skid Row and followed Gary through the years. I have all his music, and I love it.
Seeing him in one of his last performances, I consider it a very special moment in his life.
on a scale of 1 to 10 I give this concert a 20!!
After watching I did not run and get a older concert to watch I put it back in and watched a second time. This is on my list of all time favorites.

His playing here is nothing but stupendous. The band is tight and capable. I agree with some other reviewers that the vocals are a bit lackluster but the guitar makes up for it easily. The video was shot with Gary in mind, lots of close-ups of his playing. Thanks to the director and cameramen for that. All electric guitar except for the beautiful ""Johnny Boy"", a nice interlude.

Returning home from a party celebrating my Green Bay Packers win in the Super Bowl, I logged onto my computer to Amazon.com and went to the Customer Forums (remember them?).

This is probably a 3.5 star show for me, but I am a big Moore fan so I leaned high. I know based on some other reviews that I may cop some flack for my opinion on the vocals,  but I can only call it how I see it.
