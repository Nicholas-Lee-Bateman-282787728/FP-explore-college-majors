1714767,5,B000067FP9,"My kids both LOVE the Magic School Bus videos. My son watched one in Kindergarten and raved about it so much that we bought them all--and we've never been disappointed. We have all learned fun, new facts. The kids watch them again and again.",1193875200,,241,4.5
1714768,5,B000067FP9,"I homeschool (unschool) my son, and the Magic School Bus series is GREAT for teaching kids science. We have 4 DVD sets and a few VHS's.

If you're unfamiliar with the premise, the central characters are Ms. Frizzle (a teacher), her class, Liz the lizard and the Bus. Ms. Frizzle takes her class on crazy field trips, where Bus--and sometimes the kids!--experience a transformation so they can get closer to the action. (For example, become a bee or turning into water droplets.)

One of our most recent purchases was Creepy, Crawly Fun! and it's excellent as always. These three episodes are:

*Inside the Haunted House - Acoustics and hearing

*Going Batty - Nocturnal creatures and echolocation

*Spins a Web - The life of spiders

There is also a few interactive and DVD-ROM features, by my son hasn't used those.

This CD runs about 90 minutes and is supposedly geared towards children 3-8. Personally, I think the age-appropriate range is more like 6-10 because of the complex concepts introduced.

However, if younger kids enjoy it--more power to them! It certainly can't hurt to introduce science to younger kids if the Magic School Bus holds their interest.

My 8-year old son really enjoys the series now (he didn't get into it when he was younger), so I use the Magic School Bus series to supplement our learning/experimenting with science principles. And, my son seems to love Creepy, Crawly Fun--especially where Ms. Frizzle's voice is distorted!

Also, this would be a great DVD for Halloween time--especially since it's educational!",1181260800,4,1546,5.00390625
1714769,5,B000067FP9,Very fun and educational!!! Very creative and fun to watch!! Colorful--bright and great kids!!! Sooooo much fun!!,1179014400,,113,5.705882352941177
1714770,5,B000067FP9,"I was quite surprised at the quality of the programes, so much infomation on so many levels. Easily digested visually and verbally. It presents facts that are both sound and accurate for the range of age groups specified. As a teacher I can heartily reccommend the Magic School Bus series.

If you want to know more about bugs, bats and spiders this is one to have . I would also reccommend MSB Bugs,Bugs, Bugs!!! which is about Ants, Butterflies and Bees. Both of these DVDs are up to MSB's usual standard of excellence.",1175385600,2,521,4.602150537634409
1714771,5,B000067FP9,"My Daughter loved this, she likes Scooby Doo and halloween, it is just scary enough to be fun without being the cause of nightmares. The toy made the movie more fun for her, she like to have it handy while watching the movie --it increases her participation in the stories.",1168473600,,273,4.48
1714772,5,B000067FP9,First-rate educational entertainment for the whole family.,1167868800,,58,7.428571428571429
1714773,4,B000067FP9,"The DVD is excellent in teaching scientific facts, for instance, my 3 year old loves the episode on bats, and has learned much from it. (She corrected me when I said bats were blind.) I also give it high marks beause the teacher does not always answer the children's questions, but instead leads them to a situation where they can discover the answers themselves through interaction and experimentation. My only negative comment is to get to the situation always involves some ""magical"" transformation. It just seemly highly ironic to juxtapose scientific explanations with impossible magical transformations, but the kids love it.",1158019200,3,631,5.257425742574258
1714774,5,B000067FP9,"My son and daughter love this magic school bus dvd.  they watch it all the time.  he is four and she is two.  also, they love the human body dvd.  well worth the money.",1152144000,,168,3.8529411764705883
1714785,4,B000067FP9,"My son is 4 and pretty sensitive about scary things. This video, especially the first episode, is a bit scary. He's getting into an ""I'm so brave. I'm not afraid of anything."" phase right now, but I'm pretty certain that if I had showed him this video a couple of months ago, he never would've made it through the whole thing.
Once you get past the scary bits though, it's very entertaining and educational. We love these videos! Human Body and Space Adventures are my son's favorites.",1317772800,,485,4.586206896551724
1714786,5,B000067FP9,I cannot believe how addicted my 3 year old daughter is to The Magic School Bus. She can watch any of the DVD's over and over. It is wonderful to know that she is watching educational cartoons. She loves the books as well.,1317686400,,222,4.186046511627907
1714787,5,B000067FP9,"The Magic School Bus series keeps my 6 year old's attention.  He loved the books from when he was very small and he has not outgrown them.  When he was younger, we would talk about the concepts generally and now that he's older, I can discuss things in more detail...so there is plenty of flexibility for various ages and level of interest in the particular topic.  I highly recommend any of the topics because I have not found one he didn't have some interest in.",1311724800,,464,4.435294117647059

1714791,3,B000067FP9,"The intrepid Ms. Frizzle and her students are back for further adventures with their magic school bus. There are three stories on this DVD, i.e. ""Inside the Haunted House"" which focuses on sounds and acoustics; ""Going Batty"" which features nocturnal creatures; and finally, ""Spins a Web"" which covers arachnids. Compared to the other programs in the series, I felt this fell a bit short in terms of presenting facts, hence the three stars. The DVD runs about 20 minutes per episode on average and the language options are English, French, and Spanish.

The Magic School Bus DVDs are highly educational and promote children's interest in science, and I feel this series will appeal to children ages 5 and older (as some of the concepts are a bit complex).",1275436800,9,754,4.890625
1714792,5,B000067FP9,I grew up with magic school bus cause I always found the shows interesting. I got my young kids to watch them and they learn alot from there themselves. You can never go wrong with these movies.,1270944000,,194,4.27027027027027
1714793,4,B000067FP9,"I got this togather with the other 4-5 Magic school bus DVD series, my 3 and 5 years old love all other DVD series to bits, but this one least. They both always hide behind me when watching this DVD. Perhaps they are still a little bit too young for it (for the creepy crawlies). Overall a good source of science and adventure stories. 3 stories in this DVD.",1265500800,4,358,4.202898550724638
1714794,5,B000067FP9,"Although I really enjoy the educational series of The Magic School Bus, the item took 30 days to arrive.  I've ordered other Magic School Bus dvds and have all arrived within a week.  I'm unsure if Amazon is using a different company to send out the videos.  The viedo was to be a Halloween gift for my nieces but it did not arrive until after Oct 31st.  The order was placed in plenty of time to receive prior Oct 31st date. BEWARE of the shipper, it may take longer to get your DVDs.  Back to the series...YOU MUST BUY THE SERIES.  Lily Tomlin is excellent and the my nieces have grown to love the series and in fact it is their new favorite cartoon. They HAVE to take it with them on car trips, sleepovers and grandma's house.  Its come to be their security blanket.  Beware they will begin telling you how things work.  LOVE IT!",1259020800,,832,4.282051282051282

7962677,5,B000067FP9,"I am a Music Teacher, and I found one of the episodes on this DVD a very helpful and fun way for the students to learn about sound waves and other concepts of sound.  The students enjoyed it very much, which helped them to remember what they'd learned!",1389916800,,252,4.25
7962678,3,B000067FP9,"All the Magic school buses are great.  This one had a lot about Vampires and scary things which my son does
not like.  In between the Vampire stuff it was learning about bats and insects which a lot of kids enjoy.  It does
have one episode on this about sound and where does sound come from but they use a haunted house type
set with scary sounds to teach the kids which again if your child does not like that type thing this probably
wouldn't be the best thing for your child then.",1383350400,,482,4.161290322580645
7962679,5,B000067FP9,I was very excited to find this particular dvd on line because of the age of the show wasn't sure i was going to.  My 3 year old loves this show and this is her very favorite one.  Great price fast service makes me a happy amazon shopper,1375747200,,237,3.9166666666666665

7962682,5,B000067FP9,This dvd is perfect for a lesson our class is doing on spiders. I absolutely love the magic school bus. Kids learn while they are watching a cartoon. Very informative and helps kids relate to science.,1354838400,,200,4.583333333333333
