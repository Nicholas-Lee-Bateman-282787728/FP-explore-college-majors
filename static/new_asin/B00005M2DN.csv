7944928,5,B00005M2DN,THIS PRODUCT ARRIVED WELL BEFORE THE EXPECTED DATE. THE ARTWORK AND DISK WAS IN MENT CONDITION AND PLAYED WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS. COULD'NT BE MORE PLEASED WITH BOTH THE PRODUCT AND SERVICE.,1352073600,,187,5.064516129032258
7944929,5,B00005M2DN,"I love this movie. I use to think it was bad movie, but I just enjoy always watching it. It looks like it was shot quickly, but the actors do have some fighting talent. The dialouge is very hookey and the sound effects are over the top.

Apparently, all though Bruce Lee's life people were always picking fights with him. And Bruce would always kick tail!

I find myself always quoting this movie.

The bad thing is that I can never find a good copy of it. But I guess that ads to the flavor of the movie.",1109980800,5,505,4.13265306122449
7944930,4,B00005M2DN,"UNLIKE JUST ABOUT EVERY OTHER BRUCEPLOITATION FLICK I'VE SEEN, THIS ACTUALLY HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH BRUCE LEE, AND IT'S ACTUALLY A PRETTY TRUE STORY! THE MOVIE EXPLAINS HOW BRUCE [PLAYED HERE BY BRUCE LI] HAD TO STRUGGLE TO GET INTO MOVIES IN AMERICA AND IT GIVES SOME LOGICAL INSIGHT TO HIS YEARS AS A TEENAGER. HAS GOOD FIGHTS, A LOGICAL WAY OF EXPLAINING BRUCE'S LIFE, AND IT'S ENTERTAINING. THIS HAS GOT TO BE THE BEST THING BRUCE LI HAS EVER DONE IN HIS CAREER. THIS MIGHT BE BETTER THAN ''DRAGON; THE BRUCE LEE STORY''.",1089244800,2,527,4.557894736842106
7944931,2,B00005M2DN,"I bought this disc because my UK (Region 2) disc is sourced from a badly damaged theater print that has the rather good Nunchaku duel removed by the Censors. I WAS hoping this US disc would have been a good replacement...wrong! this disc is so poor it makes the UK disc look as if Criterion had mastered it. Also dosen't the US have anything like the ""Trades Description Act""?
Every statement on the Disc cover is false. Digitally Remastered-NO WAY, it's been sourced from a crappy vhs with faded colours and a VERY badly scratched print and 4:3 pan & scan(unlike the UK disc which is Widescreen-sort of). Dolby digital 5:1-Total Lie! At best it's only 2:0. Still the movie is probably the best bio-pic on Lee (Bruce Li really captures the spirit of the man)and it was cheap!!",1011916800,8,776,4.589928057553957
7944932,4,B00005M2DN,"""Bruce Lee:The man, the Myth"" is a surprizingly accurate accounting of the late martial arts ""superstar"" Bruce Lee; more so than ""Dragon-The Bruce Lee Story"". The story begins in Hong Kong with a young Bruce Lee (Ho Chung Tao/a.k.a. ""Bruce Li"") paying a final visit to the ""kwoon"" of his Wing Chun ""sifu"" Yip Man before leaving for America. Lee engages in a sparring session with Yip Chun who portrays the part of his famous father. After making the move to America and settling in Seattle, Lee begins teaching any and all who want to learn his kung fu. After a brief encounter with a tough thug (karate legend Donnie Williams) who takes exception to Bruce Lee stating that karate came from kung fu, Lee is challenged by a karate master (David Chow of the TV series ""Kung Fu""). Lee defeats Chow and his hinch men then moves on to California to be discovered for the role of ""Kato"" of the ""Green Hornet"" TV series. Lee later returns to Hong Kong and is met at the airport by the real life childhood friend of Bruce Lee, ""Little Unicorn"" (""Little Unicorn"" played the part of ""Jimmy"" in ""Return of the Dragon""). While persuing his film career, Lee faces many challenges including matches against Thai boxers and the extra's on the set of ""Enter the Dragon"". The story contains several scenes of Ho Chung Tao training with the Wing Chun dummy, weight machines, electric muscle stimulator, etc. that were part of the real Bruce Lee's training regimen. I would have rated it 5 stars if not for the hokey ending, but other than that there are several points about this biopic that the sincere Bruce Lee fan will pick up on. I have not yet viewed the DVD version of this feature, but I will surely add it to my collection as soon as Amazon.com makes it available.",994204800,7,1755,4.556962025316456
