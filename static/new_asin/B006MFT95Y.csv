8500702,4,B006MFT95Y,"This was an eminently watchable film that moved and inspired me - true stories from three different people at three different times in the same troubled region of Europe. It's a movie about overcoming differences and finding unexpected good in people during the worst of times. As someone who has lived in and studied this part of the world, I found it very authentic, but friends and family members who are less knowledgeable enjoyed the film equally. It transcends time and place as a universally human story of courage and kindness.",1332115200,,535,4.8901098901098905
8500703,5,B006MFT95Y,"This is a wonderful documentary on peace & reconciliation for all people of Western Ukraine and Southern Poland - whether one is Christian, Jewish, Polish or Ukrainian.  But most importantly, it transcends political borders and provides a message of hope for all people, all humankind!",1332115200,,285,5.333333333333333
8500704,5,B006MFT95Y,"This film shows three bright lights in a sea or horrors. It demonstrates that there are people who will do what is right despite potentially devastating consequences.  While movies with such difficult topics are usually painful to watch, this one is uplifting.",1332028800,,260,5.190476190476191
8500705,5,B006MFT95Y,"I found the three stories compelling portraits of three individuals providing three very different facets to the events in Galicia during and following WWII. There have been many WWII stories, but these are new, fresh and speak to the struggle of individuals to maintain their humanity and dignity.  Is there a time when you would reach out to help your enemy?  These three stories, beautifully and sensitively told raise that question and find answers in the individuals they portray.  It is a great film!",1332028800,,506,5.0
8500706,5,B006MFT95Y,"A fascinating view on Galicia and Polish, Ukrainian and Jewish people living in the same geographic area with their world views far apart. The sensitively done stories reveal what can trigger hatred and what can awake bravery in any of us while we may be unaware of our own hidden prejudices...",1332028800,,294,4.784313725490196
