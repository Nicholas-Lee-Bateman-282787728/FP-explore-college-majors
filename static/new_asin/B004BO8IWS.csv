8422096,2,B004BO8IWS,"I think this series is some what informative but for the price it isn't worth it. This series is for absolute beginners. If you want to learn the blues, grab the Complete Guide to Blues Guitar by Joseph Alexander. It's 3 book series that goes over every aspect of Blues guitar. And you'll spend under 60 for all the books",1490832000,,321,4.366666666666666
8422097,5,B004BO8IWS,Best series yet,1421712000,,15,4.333333333333333
8422098,5,B004BO8IWS,I have not finished viewing the total number of sessions but so far it is excellent. Takes through the basics into some pretty sophisticated playing.,1414454400,2,149,5.0
8422099,3,B004BO8IWS,sort of disappointed in the course detail. Most of the videos show Steve playing with the bank but the course seems to lack direction to me. I understand he is trying to develop the ear of the user but the course seems to lack purpose. The Learn and Master guitar course was much more structured,1398124800,5,295,4.381818181818182
8422100,4,B004BO8IWS,"As a performing Guitarist, specialising in Jazz and Latin, I found this lesson set to be excellent.

Steve's tuition is easy to follow and concise, The ideas and concepts provided from disc one are excellent and I also learnt some great ideas and techniques.

I recommend this anyone wishing to learn The Blues or wishing to use it as a teaching aid for their students.",1380412800,2,369,4.661538461538462
8422101,5,B004BO8IWS,I love the way Steve goes through the systematic lessons. I love the way how the arrangements are made with regard to the learning process.,1334275200,3,139,4.6
