8468144,1,B005EDVLE2,"Its my fault that i did not read the description for this DVD carefully enough ... only 4 episodes!
I am giving it one star out of five because 4 out of 39 episodes at this price is not a good purchase at all.
Buyer beware !
I have only myself to blame because usually i am a very decent shopper. Oh well  ... Live and learn.",1373155200,3,325,3.8507462686567164
8468145,5,B005EDVLE2,"My mother use to sit me down in front of the tv as a child week days and watch this on the old WPIX channel 11. For years I though I was cloud coo coo, because I was the only one that remembered it, until seeing it on AMAZON.com ! Low buget sfx, but it is what it is.",1372550400,5,267,3.542372881355932

8468148,5,B005EDVLE2,"I use to watch this as a kid, love these old shows, so when I found it I've had to have.
very fast service, will purchase from seller again.",1357084800,,140,3.8620689655172415
8468149,4,B005EDVLE2,"People who are fans of Gerry Anderson types of marionette shows will definitely appreciate this, in fact it's so much like his style, it'd be easy to think it was one of his - my husband actually said if he'd just walked in without knowing otherwise he'd have thought a hoverbike scene would have looked like a FireballXL5 scene.  It's actually before my time (I was born in the 70s) so I am just discovering some of these shows.

This is really generically packaged to the point my husband asked me if I bought a pirated copy.
It's technically only three episodes (Husky Becomes Invisible, The Wandering Asteroid, The Evil Eye of Venus) with a ""bonus episode"" (The Invisible Invasion)-- bonus because it's about the quality you'd get if someone found a ""I recorded this off my tv, re-recorded it, re-recorded, etc etc, then posted it online, then recorded it from that on my phone cam""  version of the show (being a silent movie junkie who is used to damaged films being ""restored"" sometimes from stills, I'm okay with that -- I understand that stuff gets lost, damaged, etc especially if it's from before this internet digital age).

That said, there's still just not enough on this.  No commentary.  No extras of any kind.

There is another dvd that appears to have the whole show, complete with extras.  Never having seen the show, I went with this as that version appears to be out of print and is very tough to find and can be very expensive.  I don't like to go the expensive route with knowns if I can avoid it, let alone unknowns.  That said if, like me, you're just now getting this show recommended to you based on other likes - well if you're a Gerry Anderson fan, puppet fan, fan of old shows that most find cheesy, etc - yeah go for it, you won't be disappointed.",1351900800,2,1777,4.507788161993769
8468150,4,B005EDVLE2,"Great stuff... I was rapt to receive this DVD as Space patrol episodes are hard to find. Now all I need to do is find my favourite episode, which seem to no longer be available :(",1341619200,,179,4.0
8468151,5,B005EDVLE2,"I am very glad to have found this DVD treasure. It dates back to my elementary after-school days. Called ""Planet Patrol"" in the US (because of an earlier serial show from the 1950's), it used puppets to animate the characters in the high tech universe of the 2100's. It was a clever, thoughtful series from the UK that portrayed an interplanetary setting of intelligent cooperation against various dangers. I hope for more episodes to be re-published.",1323648000,3,451,4.947368421052632
8468152,5,B005EDVLE2,"This product was exactly as advertised:  NTSC region 1, so that it played on my player.  This company should produce all 39 episodes instead of just the four.",1317600000,4,158,4.607142857142857
