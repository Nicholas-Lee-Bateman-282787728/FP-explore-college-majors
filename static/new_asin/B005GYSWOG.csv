8472425,5,B005GYSWOG,"I have loved Eyewitness books, videos, and, now, dvds, for YEARS. They generally provide accurate science and wonderful graphics. This particular edition, DESERT, provides one more valuable lesson-that ANYONE can make a mistake. Kids too often believe everything they see in a documentary and the laughable error presented in this one, something that any southwestern US kid can tell you is WRONG, helps remind viewers to question supposed authorities.
About 15 minutes in, the narrator says that tumbleweeds are able to get the water they need to survive as they roll along.  Whoever prepared the script seems to have not realized that someone was pulling their leg and did not check the science before including it in the show.
For those of you who haven't had the pleasure of trying to uproot a tumbleweed in the growing season- the are FIRMLY rooted in the ground, they get water through their roots and are a formidable foe-they are very hard to pull up (easiest if you soak the ground to the depth of their long tap root). It is only in the Fall, when the plant dies, that it lets loose its strong hold on the Earth, and the wind eventually sends it rolling across fields and along highways. When a tumbleweed is in the tumbling stage of its life, it no longer needs water, because it is dead.
Teachers, ask your kids to watch this dvd and tell you if they can spot the error in it. Helps develop critical thinking.",1363046400,,1421,4.661354581673307
