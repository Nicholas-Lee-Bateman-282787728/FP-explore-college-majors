8566956,5,B00BEH5RK6,"I highly recommend this DVD for anyone interested in improving their practice, no matter what level they are at - novice or seasoned yogi/yogini. Lisa is a gifted instructor and a very motivating & inspiring individual. The sequence is relaxing while still offering a challenge. The ability to do this practice in smaller increments vs. straight through makes it adaptable to all schedules and endurance levels.

As a certified yoga instructor, exercise physiologist, and licensed osteopathic physician I can tell you from a professional perspective that her alignment cues and method of teaching are exact and purposeful. From a personal point-of-view, I spent several years taking her classes in person and now due to living at a distance can no longer do so. This DVD allows me to benefit from her teaching style even though I live over a 1,000 miles away. She is truly dedicated and talented and I have found few teachers like her in my life journey, thank you so much Lisa;-)",1367193600,,980,4.9393939393939394

The moves are perfect for a beginner as well as an advanced student.  After a week doing Lisas yoga, I feel calmer and more at peace.  I also have more energy.",1366416000,,324,4.0
8566959,5,B00BEH5RK6,"Lisa Goodwin's peaceful voice delivers clear instruction as she demonstrates essential yoga poses to the beginner, as well as challenging tips to move the most advanced yogee's practice to a new level. I have been practicing yoga for about 25 years, and with Lisa Goodwin for the last three years. Being a mom of a toddler now, I don't always have a full hour to myself. Therefore, I love how the class segments on the dvd are divided on the menu so I can select whether to do the entire class, or only certain sections if there's not time for the full hour. The red rock setting is calming in itself, and when combined with Lisa's meditative presence this yoga flow dvd will be a wonderful addition to everyone's practice.",1362614400,,723,4.569230769230769

This video leads you through a full range of yoga postures and relaxation techniques. Lisa's beautifully detailed instructions and easy-to-follow modifications make understanding the alignment simple. You can choose to do the entire hour long practice or just parts of it at the menu selection when you begin.

8566963,5,B00BEH5RK6,"If there is a better yoga instructor anywhere in the world I would like to know where they are.  Lisa Goodwin is an intelligent, industrious and innovative teacher.  She is very serious about her teaching and about her students.  I have practiced yoga in many parts of the world and never found another teacher that rises to her level.  She not only teaches yoga she lives it.  She has an advanced understanding of the body, mind and spirit. This DVD is an excellent enhancement to your practice.  Take it with you when you travel.  Better yet.  Take some classes with her.",1360800000,2,573,4.603960396039604
8566964,5,B00BEH5RK6,"I am so excited that Lisa Goodwin has finally created a DVD.  Lisa is a beautiful person on the outside and even more beautiful on the inside which shows throughout the DVD. This DVD is a must buy and I highly recommend it.  The practice is for all levels and with her gentle, soothing voice, you can truly go within and enjoy the flow.  I love that if you are on a time restraint you can do your practice in segments and not all at once.  Hopefully, this DVD is the first of many that Lisa makes.  Thank you Lisa for sharing your unique spirit with the world.",1360800000,,560,4.148148148148148
