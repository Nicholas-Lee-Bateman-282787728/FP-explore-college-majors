8319852,5,B001LTZ5MM,"This is a well made video. It is put together very well and is very thorough. The video shows how to create 7 different faces, it tells you what materials you will need to create the faces, textures, marketing your business and many other important steps and techniques. Sharon Neilson is a very skilled artist and knows what she is doing. Great video!",1478476800,,352,4.603174603174603

My family love Halloween and makeup.  I have alway been big into face painting and prosthetic and now that my children are getting older I'm passing that love down to them.  I got this video as a jumping off point for my kids so everything they learn doesn't come from dear old dad. I watched this vedeo with them because the deal was if they could watch the entire video and not be bored and shut it off then they could have their own make up kit and work on project by themselves.
First off one out of two kids made it through the entire video. The one that did is only 4 and I didn't have high hopes for him anyways, he's still too young. The oldest did make it and now has her very own make up kit.
Now with that out of the way let's talk about the video it's self.  This video is very educational and teaches the basics and more advance steps. I even learned a few tricks myself and I thought I knew them all. LOL!
In closing if you are a beginner or an old hand this video is great.  My duaghter watches it at least twice a week and I can't count how many times I have to set in the chair so she can do my makeup.  One you have this video the fun never ends.",1474329600,,1209,3.9183673469387754
8319854,1,B001LTZ5MM,Id love to see someone get a real tattoo on their face of a werewolf or the green monster so they will be stuck with it forever. Wow this paint face stuff is so lame if you wanna buy this kit then why not just get a tattoo of it done officially? H uh!!,1462665600,,252,3.685185185185185
8319855,5,B001LTZ5MM,"With halloween just gone, this DVD was awesome and helped us to create some new and amazing horror looks. We did 3 parties over the weekend, each with about 10 kids at each and found that we were never short of ideas for creating and transforming the kids into zombies, werewolves, skulls, vampires and mummies. Some great techniques for achieving realistic looking scars, blood, bruises and all the rest. I highly recommend this for anyone in the party business or even for individuals wanting to do their own face painting.",1415491200,,525,4.844444444444444
