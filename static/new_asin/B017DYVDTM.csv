7501059,4,B017DYVDTM,"When I saw&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Evil-Dead-2/dp/B005J9ZE5I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Evil Dead 2</a>&nbsp;in 1987, it blew my mind. It holds up well as a bloody absurdist comedy, and I haven't seen anything match it since (Army of Darkness felt like they were running out of ideas). So what's it like seeing Ash today? Well, I'm no longer a teenager with a penchant for mind-altering substances, but it doesn't matter: Bruce Campbell + Sam Raimi = more 1987 magic in 2015!
'
Ash vs Evil Dead takes all the best of the franchise and throws it into a 21st century container. Does it works? Yes!
If you have a good memory you'll notice tons of details clearly paying homage to the films. You'll see Ash reenacting some of the same motions with the same camera angles when facing new threats. He's back in the Oldsmobile Delta with silver trailer, and while so much else remains the same, some promising new blood has teamed up with him in the fight against deadites. The continuity is not surprising given Sam Raimi's involvement, and he brought his fabulous friend Lucy Lawless onboard, although her screen time in the first three episodes is minimal (only a few seconds in the premiere).",1446940800,9,1240,5.174129353233831
7501060,5,B017DYVDTM,"I have been waiting years for this, years!! Well, a lot of us have been waiting years for this. Luckily Universal Studios didn't let Raimi use the original cut for Army of Darkness (originally titled Medieval Dead and with a different ending where Ash uses the Necronomicon to return home but ends up in a post-apocalyptic future). For years there were rumors of another Evil Dead film, or a reboot, but since television has gotten so good, Im really glad that this was the medium they chose to tell more adventures of Ashley J. Williams.

I watched the pilot Halloween night on Starz as was intended, and it was everything I wanted it to be. Bruce Campbell was perfection as always, it was so amazing to see Bruce back in the role of Ash after all these years, its almost like no time has passed. After picking up a girl and taking her back to his trailer, they party and to impress her Ash reads a bit from the Necronomicon, not a good idea. Never read from the book! There are tons of awesome deadites in the pilot, lots of creepy and gross moments that harken back to Evil Dead 1 and 2. I love all the call backs to ED 1 and 2, music cues and flashbacks (though there is no mention of Army of Darkness at all, maybe in future episodes but that adventure was not mentioned in this first episode). I want to say more but I won't spoil anything either. I loved that there was more Three Stooges style slap stick humor, this just felt right at home with the rest of the films.

Ash is a lone hero, but often times his stubbornness and arrogance gets in him in trouble. Luckily for Ash, he has some help. Ray Santiago plays Pablo, Ashs coworker who looks up to Ash and sees the potential in him to be a true hero. Dana DeLorenzo plays Kelly, Pablos friend and also works with he and Ash, she doesnt really see Ash in the same light that Pablo does. We are also introduced to Jill Marie jones as Amanda Fisher, a cop who runs into some deadites and has a very brief encounter with Lucy Lawless who plays Ruby. Sam Raimi gives us a lot to chew on in the pilot, but is also keeping a lot secret, and as the first season unfolds you really can't tell if Ash will be the hero he has been in the past. Who is Ruby and what are her real motivations, will Pablo and Kelly become an item? Will Ash ever get to see Jacksonville, FL? There ended up being only 2 references to Army of Darkness that I caught, but there were some great callbacks to things that happened in the past, especially ED 2. Some of the episodes in the middle of the season are a bit light on action and horror and focus more on character development. But boy does the last half of this season really kick s&%# into 12th gear with the gore and horror and action. I ended up loving all of the first season, the show retained the campiness and style of the original films while injecting some new blood and modern touches that I think really helped the show overall. The humor, the action, the horror, its all on point. This is everything I wanted it to be and more. I think any fan of Evil Dead 1 and 2 or Army of Darkness is really going to enjoy watching more adventures of Ash vs. Evil Dead. FULLY APPROVED.",1446422400,49,3170,4.23801652892562

7501084,5,B017DYVDTM,"ABSOLUTELY AWESOME SHOW! Its different from the films in many many ways but still has the heartfelt goofballishness that made the films so great. I've watched both seasons 1 & 2 and they both are terrific. I started to wonder what the films would have been like if they had had the CGI technology then that we have now. If that were the case the movies would still be good; but not the timeless classics that they are now. In season 1 you'll notice that there are many references to the first two films, but nothing referencing the 'Army of Darkness' film. Apparently there was some legal dispute over the ""rights"" to it and it could not be mentioned or referenced. But in season 2 it becomes a rather important ordeal to the actual storyline itself. The films served as an inspiration to a generation or more of up and coming film makers. Bruce Campbell can simply do no wrong as Ash Williams. This show is funny as hell! im so glad that its a show and not another series of films. TV just has so much more impact as far as story lengths go.

7501088,5,B017DYVDTM,"If you are a fan of the  Evil Dead films or Army of Darkness you will want this in your collection!  Ash is the same wise guy, ass kicker he was in the Evil Dead films.  The cabin is there, the book, and the deadites are around to give Ash ample scenes to destroy them.  Lots of creative gore and splatter on display here.  Several of the effects are CGI  which are not as good as in the original movies.  But hey it is what it is.

There are 10 episodes to view here so it is an easy binge watch.  Some nice special features to round off the 2 disc set.  I met Bruce Campbell in Chicago at a Fangoria Horror  convention and this dude was the real deal!  His personality was the same as Ash.  He is a very funny guy, the fans loved him.

In 2017 if I can watch new Ash vs. the Evil Dead then count me in!  It is a fun ride and will bring back some good memories from the glory days of horror!!",1490918400,,893,3.856353591160221

Actually you need not even be slightly acquainted with the movie franchise ... you can start this ""cold"" and still have a helluva time on this delightfully wild ride. This is a candy store for horror fans, or for people who love over the top adventure, slapstick, and stuff like ""Big Trouble in Little China"". This is a jam-packed plethora of thrills and blood (oh, the blood, such plentiful blood) and wise cracks and practical effects/makeup and groovy comic book camera work and classic rock and amazing sets/props and more.

7501104,4,B017DYVDTM,"There are a surprising number of daylight scenes. I got the impression from the second movie that the Evil Dead can't possess people during the daytime.

It seems like every household object in this show is hard enough and sharp enough to punch through a person's whole body and impale them.

I don't understand the writer of the Necronomicon being so eager to find it.
The person who wrote it is the person who needs it least. You have to have known the information in order to have written it down.

Maybe the point of finding the book was to destroy it rather than read it. But that doesn't seem necessary since most of the book is written in a foreign language, and Ash can't read it.

Still, I was on the edge of my seat, and I binge-watched the whole show in one night.",1483315200,,775,4.324137931034483

7501115,5,B017DYVDTM,"This show was just what I needed.

Ash Williams is an aging store clerk living in a trailer.  30 years ago he saved the world, but today he kills his time smoking, drinking and hooking up.  Until one day the evil he fought returns.  Despite his best efforts to escape his fate he has to take up his chainsaw and boom stick once again.

I was a big fan of the Evil Dead and Army of Darkness films and wow, this is a very surprising and very welcome return.  It reunites the original creators actor Bruce Campbell and director Sam Rami and recaptures the air of the films perfectly while acknowledging the 30 years that have passed.  It gives Ash two sidekicks Pablo and Kelly both of whom are great foils to Ash's cocktail of arrogance and ignorance.  Rami's Xena star Lucy Lawless joins as well.

The classic rock soundtrack also deserves some kudos, not only are they good songs, but perfectly chosen for each episode.

But there's a lot more than nostalgia at work here, there is really is a decent story, good humor and lots of gore.

And the ending, the ending tells us that people are petty and greedy and no, things are not going to be OK.  The perfect message as we go into 2017.

Do I have quibbles?  Yeah a few.  The episodes get a bit formulaic, and you soon realize that anyone Ash meets is doomed to a bloody and gory death.  So that plot twist loses impact over time.  Also they seem to live in a world without cellphones, no matter how much those might help our heroes.

But y'know I had a lot of fun watching this and will probably watch through it again.  If gory horror comedy sounds like your kind of thing, check this out!",1479427200,7,1641,4.321311475409836

7501122,3,B017DYVDTM,"Ashley Williams (Bruce Campbell) is still living the same life. He works at a local department store barely getting by. He lives in a trailer where he keeps the Necronomicon locked up...most of the time. Unfortunately one night he's smoking weed with a cute blonde who is into poetry. He decides to read some Kandarian poetry from the Necronomicon, which releases evil on earth yet again. This time, Ash is helped by Pablo, a fellow store employee, and Kelly, Pablo's upstairs neighbor whom he helped get a job at the store. They have an encounter with evil in the store which sets them off on the mission to destroy the Necronomicon. Meanwhile, a cop has a run in with the unnatural evil summoned by the book, which puts her on a collision course with Ash and the gang. The cop is joined by Ruby (Lucy Lawless), a woman also in pursuit of Ash though her motivations are suspect.

The set up seems a little complicated but the pilot episode was directed by the director of the first three Evil Dead movies, Sam Raimi. He has a good grasp on the material and knows the style backward and forward, so he does a fine job both establishing new characters and showing what level Ash has sunk to. His treatment of women is at an all-time low, using his missing hand as an excuse to get some pity-sex from a woman at a bar. That particular scene made Ash a little too unlikeable in my book, especially as it is played for comedy.

The rest of the series is a slow journey through various set-pieces to get Ash and company back to the original cabin where they can get rid of the book. Unfortunately, many episodes were too similar--a little story advancement, a big battle with some Deadite demons, lots of blood and guts all around. The comedy appeal of getting soaked in blood (which admittedly is a staple of the Evil Dead movies) gets very thin after a couple of episodes. Having a larger variety of kills is also less appealing and interesting as the series goes on.

The last three episodes get better as they return to the cabin where everything started. The blend of familiar elements with new twists works better there. The sort of demon fighting they do is more plausible in a remote forest rather than in ""modern day"" locations where much of the story takes place. The story doesn't really end which is a bit frustrating. They were clearly hoping for a second season, which is broadcasting right now. I'm not impressed enough to seek it out...maybe when it comes out next year on DVD I'll have forgotten my disappointment with this series and rent the next set of discs from the library.",1477440000,,2591,4.54389721627409

If you're not familiar with the Evil Dead movies, there are a lot of heads flying off, gallons of blood, and mature language.  This series doesn't hold back on any of that.  Bruce Campbell is just as funny and wholeheartedly committed to his Ash character as he was 30 years ago.  His co-stars are also great additions to the story line.
The plot begins when Ash, thinking to impress a date while getting high, reads from the Book of the Dead.  Stupid thing to do.  But then, Ash can be pretty stupid sometimes.  Heroic, yes, but stupid.",1473638400,,647,4.478632478632479

7501148,5,B017DYVDTM,"This is the release onto DVD of the same named series from specialty cable,and boy is it a blast. Watching this show,in which one ep strings into the other,is like watching an extended version of a new Evil Dead film. It is shot in hi def widescreen and looks beautiful. The very same crew is back that did Hercules and Xena;Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert. And we all know what superb shows they were. And,although I cannot confirm this as I write this,I believe this is shot in New Zealand, as in the second last ep some kids hiking in the woods sound an awful like Kiwi's to me.
Of course the star and our main man from the Evil Dead films is here,Bruce Campbell. As is his self absorbed and lazy character Ash. However as push comes to shove(and there's a LOT of pushing that is needed)Ash realizes he is the only man that can cure the Deadite plague and save the Earth from that scourge. The show also showcases Ash's flaws such as his using shoe polish to dye his hair, and his false teeth, to name just two. That kind of self deprecating writing is just what fans want to see. My main hope is as this series progresses that the writing remains up to snuff and they never lose sight of what they have laid down in this first season. They have been so careful re-creating everything that references the past films and they need to keep those core values uppermost in their minds at all time,or it will sink faster than a lousy Ash one-liner.
I am writing this review from the perspective of someone who has never seen the show on TV,so I can tell you that from what I see,Campbell has slipped back into his character as easily as putting on one's favourite shirt. I also have never seen a television show as ""raw"" as this. Raimi and Tapert have pushed it all to the limit and hold nothing back, in so far as blood and gore and salty language in the form of ""F"" bombs, go. And you know...... I LOVE IT!  I thought the minute I heard this show was being put together, that the TV format and ""rules"" would just water the whole thing down and it would be just a ghost of its former self;in other words,a piece of crap. Not so,my friends.
For extras there are two promo trailers,one featurette and commentary with each ep. However there are no scene selections on any ep. The only big drawback to this set is that there are only 10 eps in total. Not much bang for your buck at all,but essential viewing for Dead fans none the less.
In conclusion,if you love the Evil Dead franchise as I much as I do and have longed for more of it,but were afraid of what TV would do to it,I am here to tell you to not worry one iota. It's all here for your guilty pleasure. You will also see old Xena herself,Lucy Lawless, popping in to do some scenes and even Hercule's sidekick Iolous,in the form of actor Michael Hurst ,directing an ep or two. All the eps are well helmed,the SFx's are top notch and the whole experience is what any Evil Dead fan would want. Highly recommended.",1472601600,,2958,4.291592128801431

7501158,5,B017DYVDTM,"I just finished the season and boy did it pick up when they hit the cabin. It was still good before that without really roping me in but I was loving everything I was seeing back at the cabin. The gore is fantastic and off the charts for a TV series. The humour's good too along with the acting but the writing could be a bit stronger. But I care about Pablo & Kelly and that is a pretty big thing when most of the time you don't really care about the lesser lights.

 All the blood in that scene when they're shooting that deadite militia guy pinned up against the car was outrageous. The show ended very strongly and again a very good sign.

Bring on Season 2!

This isn't a true review, but rather a question from a diehard fan who can't wait to see the show. Does anyone know when this is set to be released? Its shown up here on Amazon for a considerable amount of time. I contacted Amazon and guessing they are outsourcing their customer service got a response that suggested that it was out of print (before it was even released?) and that directed me back to this same page as a ""similar item"" Thanks for the help anyone with any information.

I'm a fan of the Evil Dead and Army movies including the 2013 remake, so I dare call myself an expert on the franchise. It took me a minute to warm up to the new characters because Ash had become an ""Alone Wolf"" (See what I did there) in Army, but their relationship drove the season and I am looking forward to more. Guest stars were great and the chaos was just right. I wish each episode was longer, but I'll take what I can get. I'm in love with Kelly (Dana DeLorenzo) and I hope she makes it till the very end of the series. Pablo too. Ghost Beaters for Life.

This was AWESOME!!!!!  If your a fand of Evil Dead 2 or Army of Darkness you'll love this show.  It has all the laughs, the blood, the gore and the action and the creepy horror.  And while it takes time to build up to it it also has the the emotion of people facing evil and losing people to that evil.  Rally thought it was going to be all action and laughs, but there really is a lot of fear, horror and emotion to go with it.  These episodes flow together like one flowing story, each episode part of the greater whole,  really its like the season is worth two movies.  Evil Dead 4 and 5.  I can't till this comes out on dvd/bluray to add to my collection and to start season 2 in 2016.
Update for Blue ray itself  8 30 2016
This was a great season! I loved watching the season with all the laughs and chills again in high definition.  Blue ray was definitely the right choice for this show.  Everything I said before is still true but now we have all the stars inside the show videos collected into one video and a reel of the best ash deadite kills.  The only other extras are commentaries for every single episode from the directors, and the actors for pableo, Ash, Kelly and Amanda.  This was really interesting listening to it.  I loved it.  You also have the options to watch the episodes one after another without returning to the main menu.  The only thing I'd change since the first five episodes and the last five feel like two different moves in the season I wish we could have watched the entire season or each half season as one long movie with credits only at the beginning and ending of everything.  Well worth he five stars.",1451779200,,1747,4.293577981651376

Ash has a band of helpers to follow him this time, ya this is getting good. Now heres the problem. Only the first episode is free to watch, after that you need the Stars cable package. Who has that!

This is basically a replay of the basics of the original movie. He's a dimwitted, wisecracking guy who has a chainsaw attached to his one arm and carries a ""boomstick"" from S-Mart on the other, killing evil demons with both which have been set loose on the earth through an evil magical book called the Necromicon (from H. P. Lovecraft). Anyway, this series is one long series of extremely gory killings interspaced with a lot of wisecracks. The flaw in this series are the scriptwriters: they are too formulaic. Oh, well.
