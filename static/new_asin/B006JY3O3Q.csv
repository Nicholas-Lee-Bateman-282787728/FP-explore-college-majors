Video: Here is where this release suffers most.  For some reason it was decided to release both films on a single disc instead of packaging the original disks from the individual releases together.  This has resulted in compressed video.

The Punisher is still in 1080p, however when compared to the original release it is noticeably less crisp and saturated than the original release.  The colours simply don't pop the same way they do on the standard release and the picture seems slightly fuzzy.  This fuzziness is most noticeable during the opening sequence, but is there throughout. Despite this the film still looks far better than DVD, so it's by no means terrible, just not great.

War Zone suffers a bit more as it is only a 1080i transfer.  That said, the picture is crisp and the colours look great, though the blacks felt a bit crushed.  I don't have the original to compare it too, but despite the lower resolution I actually liked this transfer better than the one for The Punisher.

Audio:  Both films come with a 5.1 DTS track in French and English.  While these tracks are solid this release lacks the other tracks found on the individual releases.  The Punisher blu ray comes with a 6.1 DTS track, and War Zone comes with a 7.1 DTS track.  Both of these tracks are missing from this release to conserve space, so audiophiles beware.

Overall: If you want to own these films on blu ray and aren't concerned with having the absolute best quality then this is a great way to get both films at an amazing price.  Hardcore fans and anyone obsessed with picture quality would be better off buying the individual releases, especially since they aren't that expensive anymore anyway.",1430006400,4,1951,4.735905044510385
