It's a thought provoking, immersing series with no sex and little profanity, even in the uncut versions.  However, the series just went off the air, so you'll have to buy the videos.  The whole series is pretty much about these people who want to have peace, but war against each other for the correct way to do this (In fact, this was one of the ideas for peace.).  One of the best things about Gundam Wing is that the good guys are not necessarily good, and the bad guys aren't really bad (except for the Alliance).  In fact, at the beginning of the series, the gundams (A gundam is an extremely powerful mobile suit [a war robot] made of gundanium alloy.  However, both the gundams and their pilots are called gundams.) are the bad guys.  They're trying to destroy Oz as revenge for Heero Yuy's death (The Heero Yuy in the series is not really Heero; that's his code name.), but Oz is overthrowing the tyrannical Alliance.  One more thing about Gundam Wing that you need to know to understand it are the conditions for peace (as stated by Milliardo Peacecraft) are:  1. No weapons of war can exist.  2.
