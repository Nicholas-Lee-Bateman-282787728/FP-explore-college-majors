3911764,5,B002DMJLZI,"This DVD has 3 episodes.  One long episode focusing on Polar Bears, one episode on Puffins (penguin-like birds), and one episode focusing on Okapi (odd deer/giraffe like creatures).  The Puffin episode has especially catchy songs.

The Go Diego Go TV series is especially effective at eliciting responses from my toddler; and this DVD is his FAVORITE.

Diego is an animal rescuer who, along with his side-kick baby jaguar and his sister Alecia, sets out to help an animal in trouble, solving many problems along the way.  Diego is Dora's (""Dora the Explorer"" TV series) cousin; however, the Diego TV series seems to be aimed at slightly older kids than Dora--the songs, puzzles and responses requested are more sophisticated than in the Dora series.

Each episode in the series focus on one creature and teaches 4-8 facts about it.  3-5 of those facts are repeated and demonstrated multiple times during the episode with a clever quiz at the end.  My 2 year old usually gets 50% or better the first time through, so I think their technique must work.

But beyond the educational value--the shows are just fun and engaging.  My toddler loves the characters and gets wrapped up in the plots and will talk to the characters when they ask for responses/""help"".  Even Sesame Street, which he adores, couldn't do that!  Plus, it's a show I don't mind watching with him--always a bonus!",1255737600,21,1379,4.871244635193133

3911783,5,B002DMJLZI,"My 2.5 yr old thinks all 3 episodes are great on this dvd.  The Great Polar Bear Rescue is a longer show, nice introduction to puffins on the Puffin Fishing Adventure and we already love Okapi's from the ones we've seen at our zoo.  It doesn't change our enjoyment of the dvd at all, but I have to say it puzzles me why Okapi's were included in the Arctic Rescue bundle.",1288396800,6,370,4.197183098591549
