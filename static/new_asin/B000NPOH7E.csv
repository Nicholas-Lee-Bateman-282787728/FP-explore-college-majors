I actually used some of the info as a basis for part of the meteorological information contained in my book, ""Devastation on the Delaware: Stories and Images of the Deadly Flood of 1955."" The best part is how accessible some rather complex concepts are made to the lay person who's not completely familiar with technical terms.",1433116800,,459,4.411764705882353
8180534,3,B000NPOH7E,"I purchased this video for a college-level course on weather. I was annoyed that before I showed the video, I had to warn the students about significant inaccuracies in the video. For example, the video has the Trade Winds blowing in the wrong direction. Nice footage, though.",1224201600,,276,4.8936170212765955
