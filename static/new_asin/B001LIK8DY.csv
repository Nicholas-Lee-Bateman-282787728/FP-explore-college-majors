3683691,4,B001LIK8DY,"It was alright series, meaning the development of some characters worked while others seemed to fall to the wayside.

One of the proudest aspects of the previous season for me was the relationships and dynamics between certain characters.  That of Jonathan and Laura with that of Tom.  The cliffhanging ending. And the mystery of the past lives of Tom and Damien.

Somehow those ideals took a backseat to other storylines.  A mysterious plant, a werewolf, all took the show in a refreshing promising new direction.  Although there was still time to pop into the lair for delights from time to time.

Kudos on Sheriff Trout and his development, as well as newcomer troubled Ian.  Sometimes the best stories are those given time to unfold without sex.  Well thought out and definitely good chemistry between the two.  Who knew Sheriff had a gentle side?

The botonist and his new found love left me torn as far as that storyline, love the eye candy and where the story might have been going, however just as things began to get interesting(don't want to spoil the ending) the story concluded.

Personally, there are hunks everywhere, it a great vehicle to employ more former p*** stars, and the timing of the series is welcomed.",1238371200,7,1226,4.813397129186603
3683692,5,B001LIK8DY,"Season 2 has added new characters with their own twist to the storyline.  Season two picks up a day or so after season one ended.  We find out the fate of Thom, Frankie, Laura and Sheriff. We see the Lair under new leadership of Colin. But many details have changed such as the production quality, acting, and most of all the new theme song.  This season was a major improvement from last season.  There where two storylines yes Thom had to share the sport light this season with Ian, the Werewolf.  It would have been nice to see a cross over episode for with Dante's Cove. I am so excited that they decided to produce a Third Season with 12 episodes.  This will be great. There are many cliff hangers such as... Will Thom and Damian relationship survive? Will Colin come back?  Since the Botanist was bitten by Ian is he now a Werewolf?  Will there be a conflict between the Vampires and the Werewovles?",1236384000,7,905,4.442424242424242
3683693,4,B001LIK8DY,the acting is getting better.  glad to see  lot of gay adult actors being given a chance to spread there craft.  hopefully there will be a season 3.,1236211200,2,148,4.214285714285714
3683694,5,B001LIK8DY,"I had heard of this show but never seen it, I'd seen some still pictures but hadn't heard much about it, so I decided to see it for myself. Great cast and great production values, always kept me on the edge of my seat. The eye candy factor is superb, too. I'm so glad that I got to see the entire series, finally, and will enjoy watching again!",1316304000,,344,4.073529411764706
3683695,2,B001LIK8DY,"The campy charm is largely absent in Season 2 of ""The Lair."" The series  loses focus by concentrating more on a dull werewolf named Ian (Maddy Ferraro) who is befriended by the temporarily blinded Sheriff Trout (Colton Ford). There's an even more preposterous subplot involving a botanist who is posessed by a psychotic plant!! Some stiff, wodden performances, especially from Frankie Valenti as the botanist's assistant/boyfriend, make ""The Lair"" low-quality, as well as low-budget.
  The tension, sexual and otherwise, between Vampires Colin and Damien (Dylan Vox and Peter Stickles) and Damien's beloved mortal soul mate Thom (David Moretti) should have been front and center. Unfortunately, there's not enough of it. Very little of the action takes place in The Lair itself, as the kinky gay vampire's club was closed after the climax of Season 1. There's still some sizzling chemistry between Stickles and Moretti. But a few softcore sex scenes don't make up for the fact that Season 2 of ""The Lair"" lacks serious bite.",1288396800,4,1024,5.193939393939394
3683696,1,B001LIK8DY,"This is such drivel --- somewhere between a home movie and an x-rated gay movie --- but not really anything about anything.  the actors (and I use the term loosely) should be on a stage doing transvestite shows --- I simply could not believe that this stupidity could be looked upon seriously --- there are no more words to say about this stupid, stupid, stupid show...",1269648000,2,369,4.590909090909091
3683697,5,B001LIK8DY,"Just as hot an sexy as season 1.  No nudity from total hottie Colton Ford, but one can always find him nude online, as he has quite a past in gay porn.  With a little research i discovered all the members of the show are gay..except the chick, who i don't care about, and didn't bother checking on.  How odd, this season we have Vampires and Werewolves, just like in the sequel to Twilight...some crappy film i cant remember the name of.  However, thankfully, this werewolf does not turn back to human and still have pants on.  So the nudity this season, like i said is hot.  Watch season 2 for the hell of it, or just cause that Dylan Vox is to cute to stay away from!",1267142400,4,669,4.1875
3683698,5,B001LIK8DY,The item was here within the week I ordered it and in the original packaging! I was very pleased and would definitely buy from this seller again!,1255478400,,145,4.407407407407407
3683699,5,B001LIK8DY,"The DVD set is of top quality.  All discs and episodes played properly, with sharp, clear pictures and good audio.  As for the show itself, Season 2 is in every way a worthy companion and successor to Season 1.  I enthusiastically recommend the product to anyone who is interested in the subject matter.",1252886400,,303,4.679245283018868
3683700,2,B001LIK8DY,"I rented first season and 2nd season thinking this would be one hot sexy gay vampire bite-fest.  Boy was i Wrong!  I will review season 2 since its the most recent/relevant.

For one, a weed (yes a plant) is alive and killing-hurting the gays in this small island???

2nd, the horrid acting and unpleasant men here are a huge turnoff, especially the extremely feminine blonde guy ""the leader"" of the SEX club? ???

porn stars?  The extremeley annoying and girlish manbot that is colton ford as a straight sheriff? He tries too hard to ""ACT"" MASCULINE ..haha ive never seen any sheriff be so concerned that his shirt be tight enough.  Total diva! (diva in a bad way) Super gay and stereotypical.  The producers of this ""drama"" have no connection with the real world.. its like they live in ""west hollywood"" world.  The other pornstar, that Hazzard guy is cute but needs to work on his acting.  He is actually more pleasant then that girlish fembot, Ford.

sex club?  this is a disgrace to the gays.. whith shows like this, how can we expect to overturn prop 8. and other agendas. this doesnt delude bad idealogies of gays at all, it just reinforces stereotypes and the bad perception that the general public has (not everyone thinks like you west hollywood gays, come back to reality)

the only good thing about this series is they sexy sex scenes.. yeah and that is repulsive alone.  This is softcore porn without the penetration.  The scenes are a rarity so don't count on seeing too much ""front"" money shots.

Bottom line, rent this but even renting this has its faults.. YOU WILL GET BORED AND WONDER WHY YOU ARE EVEN WATCHING THIS CRA*!",1246579200,5,1640,4.622837370242214
3683701,5,B001LIK8DY,"It really is entretaining , stimulates sexual appetite and brings back memories from past on horror movies and series it is just great",1244937600,,134,4.869565217391305
3683702,4,B001LIK8DY,"as good as the first season, well worth it, hope this get into my library system, as I did give it to them (might be too much nudity)",1242950400,,133,3.7857142857142856
3683703,5,B001LIK8DY,"The Lair:  Season 2 is a must-have for its fans.  If you have The Lair:  Season 1 then you'll want the next in the series.  There's the humor, suspense, thrill and horror that we'd expect from a modern-day gay vampire/gay werewolf series.",1238976000,4,238,4.595238095238095
8318141,5,B001LIK8DY,"Currently on season 2 and I was surprised they ended up adding a few new characters, especially the wolf guy. Looks like vampires weren't the only ones hiding for centuries.",1458777600,,173,4.8

8318147,3,B001LIK8DY,"Changed the boyfriend but think it was due to he wasn't ""hot"" enough in first season.  Added a few more out of work porn stars from Chi Chi LaRues harem.  How does Dylan Vox keep getting roles in these movies.  The plant thing was confusing kinda like Little Shop of Horrors without an explanation and the werewolf costume was so bad it was sad.",1368921600,,345,4.359375
8318148,4,B001LIK8DY,They finally started getting some where with this one the qualitiy of the show got way better in this season. The lady still couldn't act.,1363305600,,138,4.56
8318149,5,B001LIK8DY,One of those series from the gay network that tries to be mystery yet shows a LOT of gratuitous nudity.  The plot is decent and the acting is pretty good (at least half of the cast is from gay porn).,1319241600,,199,3.975
8318150,4,B001LIK8DY,i watched this online too as soon as youtube loaded the second season of the lair. its almost better than the first season. i wonder what season 3 has in store?,1318896000,,160,4.193548387096774
