1317915,5,B00003CY6O,"I saw this  in theaters 3 times and now I own the dvd. Its one of coolest movies  I have seen in a long time. The dvd is only missing one thing(theatrical trailers),and I hate to say it,but the film seems alot like ""assault/13"".Other than that its  the best money Ive ever spent on a movie.",1007596800,,290,4.142857142857143
1317916,5,B00003CY6O,"From my initial viewings of the trailer of this movie, I thought ""Wow! This movie looks great!""  I was excited to see this film.  I went in with an open mind, prepared for anything-Realizing that movie trailers are NOT always an accurate scale in which to rate a film.  (Being a fan of quite a few John Carpenter movies- my favorites being THEY LIVE & BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA, it was good to see him back.)
I was pleasantly suprised and quite happy with the results.  This film pulled me in immediately!  With it's unique and very contemporary flashback (and flashback within flashback) scenes, you feel compelled to keep watching.
The acting in my opinion was good.  Ice Cube was excellent as was Natasha Henstridge.  I keep trying to imagine the original choice for the role as Ballard (Courtney Love), but I just can't do it.  Henstridge portrays Ballard with a strong, yet quite human & vulnerable side.
The DVD for this film is a very good addition to any sci-fi or J.C. buffs video library.  The picture is sharp so you can catch every bloody detail & the sound is very good, putting you on the barren plains of Mars.  It contains interesting featurettes documenting the film shoot, Special fx deconstruction, and how the music for the movie came about.
I would call this film a ""comic book"" type of film with it's larger than life heroes and evil adversaries, but it's much more than that.  I would also call it a Cult Classic, paying homage to other great classic movies.  Basically an ultra-cool stylized flick, winking at us with it's ""B"" movie charm :)",1007337600,7,1567,4.617328519855596
1317917,4,B00003CY6O,"If you like cheesy movies with almost non-existant plots here is your film. I have the type of sense of humor where I find cheesy action the highest form of comedy out there. John Carpenter movies are obviously not meant to be taken seriously. This movie is fun to watch and a laugh riot if you find that kind of thing funny. The main ""Bad Guy"" is a buffed up Marilyn Manson look-alike who does not even utter a single actual word throughout the entire film. He repeatedly throws his arms up in the air and screams ""RAAAAGH"" constantly. I was entertained and that's what John Carpenter sets out to do. If you're a fan of J. C. (especially Vampires) you will love this.
PS: Ice Cube plays a black version of Snake from Escape from New York.",1006905600,3,739,4.36231884057971

The make-up, effects, the gorgeous and painful props, the cinematography, the physical acting by the extras move this movie forward. I see this movie as being an avenue for a variety of meaningful conversations. I see this movie as illustrating PTSD. I'm currently taking medication for it. When I'm asked what it's like to have PTSD, I always recommend watching this movie. My art was my method of self-mutilation, sparing my skin from visible scars.",1503360000,,582,4.83
1318021,5,B00003CY6O,"Very uderrated movie. First off, John Carpenter. Normally, 'nuff said. But then you add in a fantastic potporri of capible actors, some of which are highly bangable, drop them on Mars, and oh yeah btw, the planet is kinda haunted. The only way you could make this movie any better is if Batman swooped in to save the day at the end.

Let's talk about Natasha Henstridge. Will she ever not be sexy? Holy cheese and crackers. And don't even get me started on Jason Statham.

Ice Cube is the bad guy here, until he's not. If you like bad guy turned hero a la Riddick, then this is your cup of Earl Grey. The ""Ghosts"" of Mars are the real threat here and I won't give it away, you'll have to see what happens for yourself.

All in all, this is a real winner with a cherry on top. And yes, by cherry I mean Pam Grier! You'll watch this movie over and over and love it every time. Sometimes I even have it running in the background while I'm folding socks. CHECK. IT. OUT.",1502841600,,966,4.182795698924731

1318024,3,B00003CY6O,"With respect to his stint at the xXx franchise and what he does in John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars, Ice Cube doesn't quite have it in him to be a credible lead action hero. And I guess I'll be that guy and point out his, uh, husky physical build as the main culprit. Because he does have the attitude. I think only the unsvelte Sammo Hung can pull it off. In fact, I bought screen sex goddess Natasha Henstridge more readily as an expert asskicker.

John Carpenter presents a sci-fi knockoff of his excellent 1976 thriller, Assault on Precinct 13. Observe that Assault on Precinct 13 is itself a modern updating of Howard Hawks' classic western Rio Bravo. So, there is copycatting, and there is incestuous copycatting.

Plot to this one: It's 2176 A.D. on the Red Planet. The opening texts alert us that the Mars population numbers 640,000 colonists, and that terraforming is 84% complete, thus permitting humans to stroll the surface without ungainly pressure suits, and also that it's a matriarchal society, not that any of these matters a lick. Rumors skitter of a mysterious force that once was buried and dormant, now unearthed and alert, and sweeping like locusts across the southern valley, visiting death and destruction upon the isolated colonists. Meanwhile, a locomotive hurtling towards the mine colony of Shining Canyon, five members of the Mars Police Force (MPF) make ready for a prisoner transfer.

The figure of interest is ""Desolation"" Williams (Ice Cube), ""Desolation"" being much cooler than the guy's first name, which is James. Desolation had before been charged with murder three times only to get off three times. Lt. Melanie Ballard (Henstridge) and her meager MPF squad arrive at the mine colony to find it alarmingly deserted. Sweeping the area, they find a slaughterhouse of suspended corpses and, later, the few survivors holed up in the local police station's holding tanks. Our scowling felon, Desolation Williams, is there, all scowly.

Let's not tease you. That mysterious force turn out to be the resurrected, maddened spirits of an ancient Martian civilization, exhorted and prodded by a terrifying figure the end credits dub ""Big Daddy Mars"" (Richard Cetrone). It's undeniable that Carpenter hasn't lost his eye for the grotesque. These spirits are gross and freaky creatures, having possessed a horde of unwary colonists and compelled them to gruesome acts of self-mutilation. So many bloody piercings.

What's missing is Carpenter's knack for galvanic storytelling. He hamstrings himself by choosing to tell his story by way of a series of bewildering flashbacks and, worse, flashbacks within flashbacks. It's an aggravating technique that, for huge chunks of the movie, sacrifices the plot's sense of propulsion. Not even Carpenter's driving heavy metal/synth score can elevate the pulse of this sucker. I don't have to consult Rotten Tomatoes to suspect that this one flopped mightier than a haddock gasping on dry land.

There's a passage in the movie in which what's left of the cast barricade themselves in that police station as the berserker horde lays siege, and it's when you catch a strong whiff of Rio Bravo and Assault on Precinct 13. Also, inescapably, Ghosts of Mars will remind you of vampire or zombie horror. The tropes are all present. If you're a gorehound, this is worth eyeballing. Carpenter doesn't skimp on the decapitations and skewerings and the lopping off of body parts and other gristly kills.

On the upside, we catch a sighting of early days Jason Statham, already macho as Sgt. Jericho Butler. Lookee, he's got hair on his dome. That's cute. Statham was reportedly considered to play Desolation Williams except the studio preferred Ice Cube whose brand was bigger. Imagine how good and brawny Statham would've been as this anti-hero, and how Desolation Williams would've been as legendary a nickname as Handsome Rob. As it were, he was a scene-stealer in this one.

The script to Ghosts of Mars was originally intended to be the next Snake Plissken sequel, the movie title would've been Escape from Mars. But Escape from L.A. went on to suck at the box office, and so that was that. Natasha Henstridge continued to broaden her range, here transitioning from her eye candy femme fatale bit in Species to no-nonsense action heroine. Here, she's better than what she's given to work with. I enjoyed her contentious interplay with Cube. Like I said, Cube had the braggadocio down. He just didn't look the part to me. As solid as Henstridge was in her role, I wish the studio had landed one of its earlier choices. Michelle Yeoh, Franka Potente, even unhinged Courtney Love would've brought something more unique, more offbeat to the part. Anyway, Ghosts of Mars from 2001 is decent work by John Carpenter. He's done better.",1487721600,,4787,5.012578616352202

1318077,5,B00003CY6O,I loved this movie! Criminals and police come together to attempt to suppress the last native martians. It demonstrates just how tough colonization can be. Ice cube was perfect!

1318080,5,B00003CY6O,"Okay, so to be fair I have seen this movie probably 30 times.  I sadly do not have a VCR at my house and the only copy I had was the VHS.  So I went out and bought, obviously, the DVD version and it is the same as on the VHS, except clearer and it is special edition.  I usually don't look at the additional features unless I am really bored so that I can not speak to, but the overall movie is great, the graphics are good, and the overall package is nice.

So now to the actual movie.  It is campy, well some people may say it is really campy, but I think it is only a B+ movie instead of a full B rated.  The main character is a criminal and is destined to be moved to another jail.  To get there he must take a train through the rural, dusty, dangerous wilds of Mars. Yes, this is a ""science fiction/horror"" movie.  So bad things start to happen as they do when you are screwing with stuff beyond your knowledge and an evil force is released.  This evil force decides that it likes to self-mutilate itself and maybe cannibalize each other.

So obviously it is gory, but the gore isn't modern day horror movie gore, but more the preception of gore, I mean yes people get shot.. and heads on pikes, but there isn't the in your face there is in modern movies.

I don't like Horror movies, but this is one of my favorite movies of all time.",1479427200,,1340,4.076335877862595

1318149,3,B00003CY6O,"While I definitely enjoy this movie, It's because it's really just unintentionally silly b-movie fun. It was intended to be a big box office hit but that was never going to happen. Why? Because the movie doesn't go anywhere. They have a bunch of gunfights and battles and two or three interesting characters but no real ground is gained, nothing is really explained (they start to try and advance the plot a couple times but then that fizzles out), there's no real character development, and no resolutions. There are also a lot of plot holes.

But if you wanna have a fun time sitting on the couch with your mates and a bag of popcorn watching mindless violence and making fun of the dialogue, plot holes, and the silliness of this action/survival sci-fi flick you'll have a great time with it. This movie would make a great drinking game film. Make sure to finish your drink every time Melanie takes an orgasm pill!

Edit: Actually... here you go!

Ghosts of Mars Drinking Game

Drink once when...

Someone hits on Melanie
Someone is decapitated or loses a limb
When you spot alien arts and crafts
Anytime you hear alien gibberish
Anytime you hear the word ""fuck""
Anytime someone says Descanso's name
Anytime the blond rookie fucks up
Whenever someone says the word ""train""
Jericho is acting sleazy (hitting on Melanie, picking locks, scamming the rookie at cards, etc)

Take two drinks when...

A woman acts sexist against a man (""good solid woman we can count on"", ""you men love to exaggerate"", when you see the basically all woman government, Matriarchy, etc)
Every time you see through ""ghost vision""
Whenever someone is shoving or already has shoved something sharp through their face

And anytime you see Melanie take an orgasm pill... Finish Yo' Drink!

Have fun and try not to get alcohol poisoning!",1467849600,,1809,4.790996784565916
1318150,2,B00003CY6O,"I'm a big fan of John Carpenter's earlier work like The Thing. This movie had a low rating but I thought I would give it a try anyways, and was very disappointing that Carpenter's name is attached to it.

The effects and use of miniatures are bad, and haven't held up well. They look very low budget. The acting is flat, and Jason Statham remarkably is the best actor in the whole movie. There is no sense of horror or suspense in the movie, and the effects aren't good enough for a gross out, moment.

My biggest pet peeve in this movie is that the story is being told from the point of view of a single witness testimony, and often times they back track then have a flash back within the flash back. I think at one point they had a flash back within a flashback, within a flashback. Re-editing the movie to have it make chronological sense might help. I just found the whole thing very distracting.",1467158400,2,900,4.319526627218935

1318471,4,B00003CY6O,"An underrated Carpenter flick. I can see why mainstream viewers might not like this movie - I myself think poor decisions were made with makeup and alien design. However, it is still a fun action movie, with some clever dialogue, and fun character interactions (the latter being one of the hallmarks of Carpenter's work).

The film also features excellent editing through which Carpenter and his editor create a compelling sense of time passing in the story. For example, clever dissolves create interesting time compressions - e.g., characters begin walking down a passage and a quick dissolve later they are seen reaching the end of the passage; whereas in most movies a standard cut would have been used to compress time. The movie also makes interesting use of flash backs to show what characters A and B were doing in one location after we've been showed what characters C and D were doing at that moment in another location. The flash backs are fairly brief, and this technique combined with other clever editing helps create suspense as well as a certain pace and a compelling sense of events unfolding in a very specific manner which is reminiscent of other Carpenter films, in particular Assault On Precinct 13, The Fog, and Prince Of Darkness.

I did not particularly like Mars the first time I watched it, but upon my second viewing a few years later I now realize I had been too dismissive. I'd been hoping for another The Fog, The Thing, or In The Mouth Of Madness instead of viewing Mars on its own merits. Is it as effective  as these other movies? No, but that's beside the point. No filmmaker has a portfolio consisting of only masterpieces (not even Hitchcock or either Kurosawa, Akira or Kyoshi). Especially for Carpenter fans, or those who appreciate what a talented independent filmmaker can do with a small budget, Ghosts of Mars is well worth viewing, and certainly in my own case worth viewing again.",1411948800,5,1924,4.806646525679758

This is one I can remember going to the theater as a freshmen in high school. As a long-time fan of John Carpenter and oddly Ice Cube, the combination was enough for teenage-Denham to count down the days until it released and one of two theaters in Baton Rouge (now, there are six theaters thanks to the rapid growth in our population after Katrina).

Synopsis: With its 28 million dollar budget, Carpenter and co-screen writer Larry Lulkis bring us a depressed Mars that is cut off from planet Earth. Even the mining communities and whatever else exists there are isolated from each other, connected only by a single rail. The story adopts themes commonly found in westerns and blends them with themes from survival (situational) horror. After ancient alien ghosts emerge and possess the community members, it is up to a handful of cops and crooks to stop the madness from spreading to other communities and ultimately, Earth.

Critique: The special effects are what really shine in Ghosts of Mars. The story is your standard B-grade movie dialogue. Nothing is really done wrong with this film minus what a larger budget could have given it. Sadly, this film is the reason John Carpenter left ""Hollywood"" (filmmaking) for nearly a decade. It stands a worthy re-watch for though and maybe, a first time view for those who missed this SciFi/Action&Horror more than a decade ago.",1404259200,,1416,4.867219917012448

1318769,2,B00003CY6O,"I really wanted to like this very promising SF/action film - but I simply couldn't. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

This film begins quite well indeed. On a largely terraformed Mars (air is breathable) governed by a matriarchate (!) , a police patrol is dispatched by train (for some reason planes and choppers are absent from this movie) to a little mining town, to bring in custody a wanted criminal named James ""Desolation"" Williams (Ice Cube), just arrested by the local sheriff. But once the police patrol arrives, there is nobody to greet there... And then the film begins.

The cast is one of the few strong points of this film. The police officer in command of the patrol is of course a woman, the very lesbian Commander Helena Braddock (Pam Grier). Her trusted (but not interested by her advances) second in command is Lieutenant Melanie Ballard (Natasha Henstridge). Under their orders are three more officers, the experienced tough Sergeant Nathan Jericho (Jason Statham) and two young rookies, Officer Bashira Kincaid (Clea DuVall) and Officer Michael Descanso (Liam Waite). Later in the film they will meet also another important secondary character, Doctor Arlene Whitlock (Joanna Cassidy).

As we can see, there was a lot of screen talent here. Pam Grier (thank you Quentin Tarantino for raising her from dead in ""Jackie Brown"") is still darn hot even at 51! Natasha Henstridge is GORGEOUS - in fact she is the main reason why I give this film two stars, as it would still be a pleasure to watch her even in a commercial for camembert... Jason Statham was at that time still in the beginning of his career (he was billed fourth!) but he certainly already showed big promise - also, making him a subordinate of not one but two women offered also some good opportunities for dialogs... Finally Clea DuVall, with her unique, non-conventional kind of beauty and veteran actress Joanna Cassidy were certainly also assets.

All of that however, together with the original premises and a considerable budget were wasted by the dirt-poor scenario, which the director should never have accepted in the first place, without a serious re-working. Therefore the one who must be blamed for the failure of this whole project is the director - John Carpenter. The man who made great films like ""Escape from New York"" and ""The Thing"", interesting flicks like ""Assault on precinct 13"", ""Fog"" and ""Christine"", comedies like ""Dark Star"", ""They live"" and ""Vampires"", as well as the burlesque head scratcher ""Big trouble in Little China"". And then this...

In this film we can actually see some reminiscences of his earlier works, but in a very inferior version. ""Desolation"" Williams is a kind of pale (pun very much intentional) copy of ""Snake"" Plissken. The idea of a besieged police post in which cops must make an alliance with criminals reminds of ""Assault of precinct 13"" - but is definitely less well shown. There is a kind of absolutely lethal mist like in ""Fog"" and an enemy who can hide amongst people you trust the most like in ""The Thing"". And then there is also a kind of tribute to this great cult classic ""Heavy Metal"" (a film John Carpenter was not involved with), especially the last story ""Taarna"", with Big Daddy Mars being an equivalent of Barbarian Leader and Melanie Ballard kind of reminding of Taarna herself...

Also, a great deal of lethal weaponry is used, which should in principle please action film freaks like me - you can check them in detail on Internet Movie Firearms Database.

But all of this is mostly wasted in this film because of rather stupid scenario, mostly weak dialogs (there is only like two or three really good one liners or comebacks), not so good action scenes, interesting characters dying much too soon, disappointing use made of villains and of the Martian armoured train and last but not least a very lame ending. Also, the original ideas mentioned in the beginning (terraforming, Martian matriarchal government) or in the middle of the film (possibility of discovering Martian ancient artefacts) are not developed. At all. Instead, the film goes at ""full speed ahead and damn the torpedoes"" pace into a ""shootout, gore and F... bombs"" direction - and then fails to deliver good action scenes...

So bottom line, this is a huge disappointment and a waste of good idea, good actors and good money. Watchable only if there is nothing else and then only for Natasha Henstridge luminous beauty and nothing else. If possible, avoid.",1386115200,,4504,4.9015748031496065
1318770,2,B00003CY6O,"If it wasn't for Natasha Henstridge, this movie could have been a total abomination (and it comes close regardless).  It's incredibly cheesy with low budget... everything (acting, presentation, etc).  It's generically written with cliched ""everyone's a serious tough guy"" personality since the film deals with specially trained cops which is another cliche of course, and the setting taking place in a recreational facility on Mars several years into the future is... yeah, cliched writing once again.  This tired old identical situation has been used and copied way too many times.

A more appropriate and creative direction to take Ghost of Mars would have been to leave everyone abandoned in the middle of nowhere and darkness with very little (if any) weaponry to defend themselves, and have the mysterious creatures pose a threat *then*.  We'd then have ourselves one frightening and highly rated horror film!  As it stands, the movie is incredibly disappointing on pretty much every level.

When you have low budget acting, well, that's seriously the worst thing you can do with a horror film because now the actual atmosphere and horror elements are significantly reduced, which is the reason Ghosts of Mars is a 2-star movie (and even then, I'm being generous with the rating).  The creatures called ""supernatural warriors"" are probably the most offensive aspect.  Just regular looking people with make-up and a desire to be violent by chopping off heads and turning people skin-rippingly vicious by way of infections and organisms.  Not exactly what *I've* always envisioned as an intimidating alien creature on another planet, how about you?  Of course even with such a poor idea for a movie, at least it could have been executed more satisfyingly.  The monsters could have actually been monsters.  Even though the odds of this being an improvement in any sense is incredibly slim, Ghosts of Mars doesn't even try.

Overall, thank goodness for Natasha Hensridge's stellar acting performance- otherwise this would have been 1-star easily because Ice Cube and the other actors/actresses are clearly not good enough.  Then again with such a terrible idea for a movie, you can't really expect the actors to carry it alone.",1384819200,,2228,5.184357541899441

1318773,4,B00003CY6O,"Ghosts of Mars is an entertaining and original sci-fi flick.  I cannot say I have seen something quite like it.  John Carpenter has delivered another great and very underrated movie.  It has great special effects, a competent cast, great action, and much entertainment value.

The story is as follows.  It is the year 2176.  Humanity has colonized Mars.  However, some minors in the remote colony of Shining Canyon have dug up the remnants of an ancient civilization that used to inhabit Mars.  There ghost are still inhabiting the place and possess the minors and turn them into zombies of some sort.  LT. Melanie (Natasha Henstridge) of the Martian Police Force and her unit are sent to the c\Canyon to investigate and to pick up a dangerous criminal named James Desolation Williams (Ice Cube).  So they must work together to escape alive.

The cast does very well surprisingly.  Natasha Henstridge does a great job in the role and her character is badass and does not take crap from anyone.  She is actually more of the protagonist than Ice Cube which is weird because he has top-billing in this film.  In fact this is a good movie for women.  This movie has quite a few badass women in it.  Ice Cube actually does pretty well, which is surprising.  The only films Ice Cube was in that I like are Are We There Yet? And Are We Done Yet?  which are guilty pleasures of mine.  Jason Statham is also in the film and he does a good job as well.  Statham is always badass.  The rest of the cast is fine as well.

The film looks great.  The look of Mars is done very well given the budget they had.  The zombies look great and intimidating.  The sounds they make them ever more intimidating.  The score is very well none and catchy.  John Carpenter always composes great score for his films.  The film also has some fun action scenes during the middle and ending portions of the movie.

There is one issue I have with it and it can get quite annoying.  The issue is how the film is structured.  The story is told out of order.  The majority of the movie takes place in flashback.  Many times there are flashbacks within the flashbacks or even flashbacks within flashbacks within flashbacks.  Often they go back to scenes that already happened and expend on them to give us more information.  Are you trying to be Memento, because you failed?  Some stories can work being told in non-linear order like Memento or Batman Begins, but with this it does not work.  Plus, doing it in that format pretty much gives away who is going to live and who is not.  Also some shots are edited weird so it is hard to make out what is happening.

Despite its flaws, Ghosts of Mars is a very interesting and entertaining sci-fi film.  If you are a fan of science fiction or of John Carpenter, then definitely check this out.  You should have a good time if nothing else.",1381968000,10,2848,4.495107632093934

I didn't like it much, but every time I see that it is on cable, I watch it!  I finally figured out that it is just fun!

Workers on Mars accidentally let allow spirits to escape and take over the bodies of many of the miners in cities along the railroad. They become kinda, sorta like zombies except they can organize, make weapons and run fast. The props are so poorly made that they almost look like they are made from cardboard. Natasha Henstridge does a really good job in the lead role, and Jason Statham holds up his end. They just didn't have enough plot or good dialogue to make this an awesome movie.

The reality is, this is a really fun Carpenter movie, and gathers elements from many of his previous films.  The movie borrows from Assault on Precinct 13, The Thing, even Escape from New York to some degree.  The acting is a bit ham-fisted, but it all comes off as fun.  What is unique about this movie is the atmosphere; this movie is literally steeped in it.  This is where it shines, and if you let yourself get caught up in it, you are taken on a very fun ride.  The video quality of the Blu-ray is very good, with black levels looking awesome (very important as most of the movie is in the dark).  The sound is decent, but the surround is a bit lacking.

For example, most of the fight scenes in ""Ghosts of Mars"" are hilariously inept. But Carpenter being Carpenter, he does manage to build a pretty high level of suspense at times. When this movie does lag, it's partly the fault of a weak script but mostly due to poor acting. There's no chemistry at all between the two leads, though the film wastes a lot of time and energy pretending that there is.

I know I shouldn't have been surprised when it developed into a zombie type horror film with lots and lots of gore but I suppose I had hoped for a little more science fiction and a little less fantasy horror but that was not to be.

I'll give it credit for a few interesting ideas in the story; I thought the idea of the Martian source of the problem was interesting and the nature of the transmission of the problem. The acting was adequate to the plot and did not distract from the progress of the story. The movie ends with the problem unresolved which opens the door to a possible sequel which seems unlikely in view of box office receipts for this one.

It is a good cast wasted on a poor script and the actors just sleep walk their way through this been-there,done-that yawner from John Carpenter. Maybe because it was filmed mostly at night it would explain the yawn part.
The story opens on Mars which is almost fully terraformed. There has been on going exploration of the planet for some time. A remarkable discovery is made when a blasting site reveals an opening in the side of a cliff;obviously artificial. Joanna Cassidy is the person who first explores the tunnel and inadvertently opens up the door at the end of it. This unleashes a reddish cloud which contains the souls of thousands of dead Martians from ages past and they aren't up for garden parties. It is more of a possess now and kill later kind of thing.
Henstridge,Grier and Statham are three out of five cops sent to retrieve a dangerous killer in the form of Ice Cube. When they reach the settlement by train they come upon one grisly discovery after another. This leads to the ultimate discovery of hundreds of miners that have been possessed by the Martian souls and are bent on killing the ""invaders""(that's us).The spirits can possess either the living or the dead so the crew has to be careful at all times.
In the end most of the original cops have gone and in fact Henstridge and Cube are alone fleeing on the train. Cube manages to get away from Henstridge who wanted to return him for trial. When she arrives back at HQ,she is interrogated by a disbelieving panel of superiors. As she sits alone in her room she suddenly hears alot of raucous outside. Who should show up but Ice Cube as the possessed beings have reached HQ and Cube and Henstridge are ready to fight but are taking no prisoners.
This movie must have certainly looked better on paper,because it doesn't look good on film. It is almost as if Carpenter had an obligation for one last film to someone,and came up with this lame duck of an idea. The cast goes through their paces barely awake;there is very little excitement or suspenseful build ups at any time. The SFX are really pedestrian at best and do not help anyone or anything about Ghosts of Mars.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and looks clear and crisp. Extras include the making of GOM,commentary,a vid diary,featurettes on the making of GOM,the S/FX and the scoring and the trailer.
All in all a very mediocre Carpenter film;a real disappointment. The plot is hum drum and the lack of excitement and drama exuded by the actors on screen really shows,because of it. 2 1/2 stars. Pass on it.",1334880000,3,2682,4.6723044397463

There's absolutely no use in asking why things happen in this movie, people do stupid things just to keep the action going (remember Prison Break? and at least the effects and the acting pull you in and keep you there). It's gory and the costuming is wonderful, the zombies are some of the creepiest I've ever seen.

1319257,3,B00003CY6O,"Its reputation precedes it. A big-budget b-movie, 2001's ""Ghosts of Mars"" was such a critical and commercial disappointment that director John Carpenter went M.I.A. for the remainder of the decade. To be fair, though, the film has been grossly under-estimated as the light-hearted and slightly cheesy sci-fi romp it was intended to be. Like most of the director's output, it is the sort of film overlooked in its time but which will likely be appreciated in hindsight. Stocked full of wild special effects, amusing characters and over-the-top action, ""Ghosts to Mars"" is certainly worth a revisit for the Carpenter faithful.

Set 200 years in the future, ""Ghosts of Mars"" stars Natasha Henstridge as she leads an intergalactic police force to Mars on a seemingly routine trip to transfer a dangerous prisoner (Ice Cube). Her crew (which features an odd assortment of Pam Grier, Jason Statham and Clea DuVall) get more than they bargained for when they happen across a deserted part of the now colonized red planet which has apparently been taken over by blood-thirsty ghosts. Or zombies? Anyways, these ghost-zombies (or is it zombie-ghosts?) have the power to possess anyone around, so you can see where this is heading. In the end, the good guys are forced to join forces with the bad guys in an effort to live to tell the tale.

The film is not without Carpenter's trademark style. The man knows how to deliver the atmosphere, and his trip to Mars is no exception. Thankfully, the film doesn't have an overly glossy big-budget look, retaining the grit of the likes of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Escape-from-New-York/dp/B00004Y87O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Escape from New York</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Thing/dp/B0002CHK1S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Thing</a>."" The story is also told in flashback-mode, which gives it a unique twist not often seen in sci-fi or horror. As for the cast, Henstridge is the obvious star, even if Ice Cube receives top billing. While the latter isn't given much to do other than look tough and menacing (like in his N.W.A. glory days), the former comes through with a strong female presence that pays homage to tough girls in action flicks such as Ripley in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aliens/dp/B000G6BM00/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aliens</a>"" or Sarah Connor in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Terminator-2-Judgment-Day/dp/B001VLBDD0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Terminator 2 - Judgment Day</a>."" The rest of the cast ranges from wooden to wasted, but that doesn't hurt the film. Instead, the lack of strong supporting characters only adds to the good times when the blood-splatter starts and the film reveals itself as the little guilty pleasure treat it truly is.

If ""Ghosts of Mars"" falls victim to anything, though, it would be an extremely lagging pace that makes the first half a bit difficult to sit through. While Carpenter is known for slow-brewing his brand of horror, it doesn't quite pan out as well here, as the film isn't meant to be scary or even suspenseful. Unlike, say, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Trouble-in-Little-China/dp/B000QUCQX8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Trouble in Little China</a>"" Carpenter doesn't let loose and have fun with his material, thus delivering a breezy show like he should have. Also, the score - a trademark of Carpenter's if ever there was one - leaves a lot to be desired. While the collaboration between the likes of Anthrax, Steve Vai and Buckethead yields some interesting results, it doesn't exactly work in the film, making it feel almost video game and only serving as a distraction during some of the more exciting action scenes.

At the end of the day, ""Ghosts to Mars"" is a flawed but fun little film. It isn't one of John Carpenter's best - not even by a long-shot - but certainly didn't deserve the fate it suffered. But alas, time and time again, Carpenter is misunderstood, and unfortunately this film was the straw that broke the camel's back. Taken for what it is, the film can be enjoyed by just about anyone who wants a sci-fi film with high production values that doesn't take itself too seriously.

Then there's the lame story-line, which is told in flashback.  If you've ever seen the pilot for the original Star Trek you've got the idea--except the story isn't nearly as interesting.  A panel is listening to a woman discuss the reason she was found handcuffed to a bunk on a train with nobody else aboard.  Now, there's been an atomic explosion at a power plant on Mars, so you'd think these officials would be a teensy-weensy bit concerned about the boom-boom stuff and all the dead people in the affected city, but not these morons.  Nope.  They want to get to the bottom of that empty train, and they don't even mention the blast or seem aware that there was one.  The bad guys are right out of Twin Peaks, ghosts that go from one ""host"" to another and turn them into evil killers.  In this case, though, the ghosts are Martians who have been lying in wait for extraterrestrial prey and are now bent on killing all invaders--despite the fact that they need those invaders to serve as their hosts.  These ghosts have ostensibly taken over a lot of miners only days before, but none of them look or dress like miners anymore.  Almost all of them have long black hair and are dressed up in some sort of Ashanti warrior gear.  They carry evil-looking swords, too.  I would have expected them to still look like and be dressed like human miners and carry home-made weapons and maybe some pistols here and there, but obviously the powers-that-be wanted them to look ""cool"", logic be damned.  They also didn't want them to have guns so our ""heroes"" could knock them off by the thousands.  All-in-all, the storyline seems like nothing more than a clumsy set-up so that some bad-ass good guys can go on a slaughter, which they do.  Not that you'll care very much.  You only get to know a few characters, and they're not very likeable.  You've got a bossy, drugged-up female representing law and order and a killer thug as her unwilling sidekick.  The women are in charge, and the men are either sleezy creeps, outright thugs, or chum for the evil guys.  If all movies were this bad I'd swear off watching them.

At one point in the film Jericho says that there are at least 200 of the undead but realistically it's about five dozen sorry extras running around in bad makeup. The action scenes aren't exciting and the film is told in annoying flashbacks. The ""evil spirit"" or whatever you wanna call it is just some rather silly red sand that the wind carries.

1319531,1,B00003CY6O,"John Carpenter is a great director. He has a great sense of humor, great timing and has great skills. In fact, he is a great disciple of the classical form: austere, precise and always economic in terms of narrative... in the same tradition of one great master of the past: Howard Hawks. Don't take my word for it. Check the opening sequence of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vampires/dp/6305258287/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vampires</a>&nbsp;and compare it with the opening sequence of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hatari/dp/B00005JSGK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hatari!</a>. The similarities are striking and one can clearly see how Carpenter dominates his art.

But this film is very weak. The story about some dormant martian creatures (or their ghosts) who possess and transform a human colony in Mars into a homicidal tribe is so heavy handed it gets to be ridiculous.

The concept in itself is not bad and John Carpenter has had success with ideas even more offbeat than this one. But unlike films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Thing-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B0002CHK1S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Thing (Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Escape-from-New-York-Special-Edition/dp/B0000CNY27/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Escape from New York (Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;or less loved entries like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/They-Live/dp/B0000AOX0F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">They Live</a>, everything here is a mistake.

The characters are dull (so dull that even Pam Grier and Joanna Cassidy look embarrassingly bad), the casting is a huge mistake (all other actors are unconvincing) and the acting is non-existent.

1319534,3,B00003CY6O,"Despite the basically unexplained absurdity of the whole storyline, Ghosts of Mars is a pretty entertaining film to watch, what with all of the explosions, gun battles, decapitations, and bare-fisted brawls riding the crests of John Carpenter's hard-driving musical score.  Sure, it takes a little while to put the characters in place and set the Martian scene for us, but once the gauntlet drops, it's pretty much on.  You don't need a lot of character development in an action thriller like this one because you know most of the characters you meet aren't going to survive in the end, anyway.  I do have to deduct some points for the whole flashback business, though.  It's bad enough that the bulk of the film is presented as a flashback, but when you start putting flashbacks inside your flashbacks, I've got to stop you right there and call Shenanigans.  Flashbacks within flashbacks should be the sole province of fifth-year, we've-run-out-of-ideas sit-coms.

It's the year 2176 and man has established a strong presence on Mars, setting up mining colonies all over the increasingly terra-formed planet.  Society is set up along matriarchal lines, which should be interesting but isn't because the story just throws that out there and does nothing with it.  It certainly does nothing to stop the practice of male sexism because Sgt. Jericho Butler (Jason Statham, who always brings plenty of action to the party) spends most of his time (when he's not fighting for his life, of course), trying to get into the 22nd century knickers of his superior officer Lt. Melanie Ballard (Natasha Henstridge).  Ballard and Jericho are part of a quintet of cops dispatched to a remote post to pick up a prisoner and bring him back for trial.  This isn't just any prisoner, though; no, this is the formidable Desolation Williams (Ice Cube), a dangerous but as of yet thrice-acquitted murderer now accused of slaughtering six people.  When the cops arrive, they are disconcerted to find a virtual ghost town.  Williams is still secured in his cell, but most everyone else in town is hanging upside down, sans head, in one building or another.  We already know from the early minutes of the film that Ballard is the only person to make it back to base camp (a fact which robs the movie of a great deal of potential suspense); what we don't know is what happened out there - and that doesn't become perfectly clear until the end of the movie.

Natasha Henstridge doesn't really do a lot for me, but she was pretty good in this film (although some of the scenes wherein she shows her authority and general toughness rang a little hollow).  She's not your ideal cop, and that makes her character more interesting - especially when everything hits the fan and she's forced to seriously change tactics in an attempt to survive.  I thought Ice Cube was great; his is really the most interesting character in the film, and even Jason Statham can't match him in the ""one tough hombre"" department.  For their part, the ""ghosts of Mars"" aren't impressive at all, and their minions (whom they ""possess"") look like a huge gang of WWE rejects trying to channel The Crow.  They are evil and relentless (not to mention ugly), though, which pretty much guarantees that all of the fight and battle scenes are going to be fiercely waged.  Their little flying body slicers are particularly effective at disarming (and sometimes even ""dis-heading"") their victims.

Basically, Ghosts of Mars is more of an action movie that just so happens to take place on Mars than it is a makes-you-think kind of science fiction offering.  If you're not into relatively bloody action movies, you probably won't enjoy this film very much.",1215734400,8,3692,4.856459330143541
1319535,3,B00003CY6O,"When I first saw this it was because I am a huge fan of John Carpenter. I was a bit disappointed as it was no ""Halloween"", ""Escape from New York"", or ""The Thing"" remake. It was okay but not great. It revolves around a colony of miners on Mars going berserk after being exposed to an alien cloud. They put much more graphic items in their faces than any punker in Picadilly. The small security force there is severely challenged to stay alive since there are so many miners that have turned and their intent isn't just better food at the mining cafeteria. No in fact it is a much more bloodthirsty requirement they want met. I caught this again on television the other night and though not one of Carpenter's best works, a good one nonetheless. As one reviewer noted it is afterall another B movie, and as far as B movies go, this is pretty good stuff. I realized he actually had vision as this movie was ahead of its time. This type movie is much more common today and therefore well worth seeing. Come to think of it John has always been ahead of the curve. Decent acting, John Carpenter great music choices, and good sets, make this worthy of at least a rental if not a purchase at this great price. I intend to add a copy to my collection of horror.

1319666,3,B00003CY6O,"I saw this on the big screen and must say I was not impressed. It seemed very lacklustre and pedestrian by Carpenter standards. Watching this recently on the small screen, I enjoyed it. Not sure whether it says more about the film or myself (or both?) but what Carpenter delivers is a B-Grade (I say that in the best sense of the term; let's face it, Carpenter is a gloriously talented B-movie King, no disrespect intended) movie that allows him to do (yet another) western riff in the shape of a sci fi-horror flick. The titular ""GHOSTS"" are less aliens or zombies as they are ""Injun"" savages in the best (politically incorrect) context.
Knowing how much Carpenter has wanted to make a Western, looking over his body of work, one sees that influence on his films. Snake Plissken is a bonafide western outlaw/anti-hero just like Han Solo was. Vampires is a western with blood-suckers instead of Indians. The starkness and isolation expressed through his imagery, characters, locations, events and music is very much a loving tip o' the hat to the western genre. I don't need to go on. Fans of his work know this. Doubtful? Just go and watch is films again (As if you need that excuse!).
The weakest aspect of this film is how under-developed it all is. From the outset we are thrust into a future that exists in an oppressive matriarchal society (another staple of Carpenter's being his satirical political bent), but this is only a glimpse worthy of more exploration and development. This aspect really served to distance it as an original work of film lore from the likes of STAR WARS, BLADE RUNNER and other sci fi works. A real pity that not much was done with it.
Of course the score is a typical Carpenter work of bravura. One thing that Carpente knows above others is how to utilise music to enhance one's viewing experience.
Sure this isn't Carpenter's finest work, but as B-grade, Saturday afternoon view, it more than delivers. And you really can't ask for much more than that. I think we just expect far too much - our expectations and ability to over-hype things in our own imaginations prejudices our ability to simply enjoy a movie for what it is. Just a movie. To be watched and experienced and to forget all the crap in our lives. Why we need to bring so much baggage to our entertainment is sometimes beyond me. Carpenter is one of the greats who has given me so much viewing entertainment that I think it's unfair to simply dismiss his work outright without giving it the benefit of time. At least consider that before slagging off (fill in the blank).",1191024000,,2570,4.6381578947368425

Note to filmakers:  If your audience is too stupid to remember what happened five minutes ago, repeating it isn't going to help.

No kidding, some scenes were repeated verbatim three times...

This movie is ridiculous.  That's the only word for it.  The filmography is bad.  Sudden jumps in movement isn't artistic, it's just a lazy way to cover a big chunk that was edited out.

The fighting is worse than the old Battlestar Galactica fighting.  You can see them miss even as the enemy goes flying.  People with knives in their hand and grenades on their chest resort to punching faces before they are disarmed.  Perhaps most amazing of all, after the group of heros discovers there are two hundred enemies and kill thousands with bombs, grenades, many many rounds of apparently unexpendable bullets, there are still at least five hundred left to storm the train. A nuclear power plant's rods are exposed and the core exploded  creating a moderate explosion with a two mile radius and no nuclear fallout????  All those people at Chernobyl and Three Mile Island must have exaggerated the danger.  I feel much safer now.  Of course now I have live in fear that someone will throw an aluminum pie pan at me and slice off my head.

Perhaps the hardest thing to swallow, other than the acting or lack there of, is the rather convoluted explanations via a druggies bad trip of why Martian Ghosts would take the form of dried dust and wait around thousands of years to steal bodies, then act like the motorcycle gang in mad max two... I think they even borrowed their costumes.  Hmmm...  maybe it was the same gang, I detected some bad australian accents...

Thats not to say its not a well crafted film I believe it is. However, Carpenter obviously had fun making it because I had fun watching it. Its up to the viewer if they're willing to shut their thoughts off and enter Carpenters world. You can nit pick if you want, but whats the point really, this film isn't about realism its about fantasy.

 For me Carpenters strength is his ability to create a sense of time and place, an alternate reality if you will. This isn't a real world or even a realistic world but Carpenter invites you into it and it has a sense of place and time.

 Thats where the fun comes from, the escapism, the strange setting, the slightly off key plot and dialogue.

It is about aliens that have been released from an acient prison that can go from human to human via air currents and they start to destroy the facilities on mars and killing every thing that is breathing. in order to regain their acient home. there are a coulple of corny lines but this movie is still in the same class as Quentin Tarintino's remake of dawn of the dead. So if you want a good bloody, gorey, and violent killfest check this movie out. However I reccomend this movie for mature audiences ONLY.

1319674,4,B00003CY6O,"Well... I dunno if you're a fan of Carpenter's films or not, but every fan of his work can tell you that his movies age like fine wine. If you like slam-bang action mixed with sci-fi and horror, I can recommend this movie. I'm not saying it is the best movie ever committed to film, but I will say that I enjoyed it quite a bit. It takes a while to really get moving, and I don't mean action-wise... that happens pretty quick... what I mean is conceptually, the story didn't really gel for me until about half-way through, but the time before that was spent in character development, so I can't completely shame it there.

The plot's fairly simple... in the year 2176 Earth has teraformed Mars for colonization and ore processing. They haven't worked out all the kinks and are really just kinda stumbling around in the harsh, alien environment. When a mining crew stumbles upon and ancient Martian artifact, they release the disembodied essences of the former Martians who can possess the bodies of anyone they come in contact with. The humans who are possessed by the Martians become savage, sado-masochistic beasts who mutilate their flesh and kill anyone they come in contact with.

Enter into this madness a crew of Mars police officers who are unknowingly arriving in an infected mining town to escort a prisoner from the jail to the penal facility. Poop hits fan, and the police have to forge an uneasy alliance with the criminals in the jail against the Martians.

There's some pretty good stuff about the movie: it's pretty darn violent... if you like frequent beheadings and belimbings (I made that word up!!!), you'd prolly dig this one. The makeup effects were incredible... when I say these people mutilate themselves I really mean it... we're talking screws in the face, barbed wire cutting into flesh, gashed open mouths, filed teeth... these things are scary lookin! There's one really cool scene that shows the Martians' memory of their former selves and the Mars of ages past. I really wanted to see more of that... here's hoping the buzz about Slither and its alien flashback scene lives up to the hype. And then there's the concept in and of itself: an enemy that can't be killed. You kill one of them they hop to your body and continue the fight. It's kinda staggering. Also, this movie felt like it was made in the 80's... I dunno what about it seemed that way, as the special effects were up to par for the time it was made, but it just had that flavor. It's kinda like another Carpenter film, Assault on Precinct 13. Wow... Carpenter has made another ""zombie movie"" without zombies!!!

What didn't work: two words: ICE CUBE. Who in their right mind ever thought that this jackass is a good actor? Oh ok... he was funny in Friday... but that's IT! Just stop now... make him go back and be a rapper... yesterday. Ugh. In my opinion he stunk up the movie royally. I could deal with everyone else in the movie, but he just... just... eeeugh. Jeez. If they wanted a tough rapper guy I'd have been happier with Coolio... at least he has fun hair! Another thing that kinda stunk was the wish in my mind that it had been a bit more violent and gory. I mean... it was ok... and by ok, I mean really good... but I dunno... I expected a LOTTA violence and gore.

1319754,1,B00003CY6O,"It's becoming a more distant memory with each new John Carpenter film, but there actually was a period in the late 70's/early-to-mid 80's when he was quite a good director. Most of his films from that prolific period rank among some of my favorite films of all time: Assault on Precint 13, Halloween, Escape from New York, The Thing, Big Trouble in Little China. I grew up with those films and they still entertain me to this day.

But somewhere around the time that his 1987 disaster Prince of Darkness came out, things started to go seriously wrong with John Carpenter. Just look at the crap that he has churned out since then (with the exception of They Live and In the Mouth of Madness which I actually liked though they are far from great movies): Memoirs of an Invisible Man, Village of the Damned, Vampires, and now, his latest debacle, Ghosts of Mars......I'm sorry, make that JOHN CARPENTER'S GHOSTS OF MARS!!! I'm not sure what has happened to him, but he seems to be walking proof that somewhere along the line he went senile, or insane....take your pick.

Ghost of Mars involves a group of military personnel led by Pam Grier and Natasha Henstridge. They are going to an outpost on Mars to pick up a prisoner, played by an annoyingly stoic Ice-Cube, who is being charged with murdering a bunch of people on the train. Of course when they get there the place is deserted and they quickly find corpses that have been either decapitated, dismembered or disembowled. They find some prisoners, including Ice-Cube and they proceed to tell, in flashbacks, how a group of miners accidentally unleashed some sort of evil dust that contains some sort of evil spirits that take over people and make them go insane and on a killing spree.

Actually, the first hour of the film's 93 minute running time is basically nothing but each character saying what they were doing when the massacre took place. I found it particularly amusing how many flashbacks occurred in this movie. In fact, my friends and I invented a drinking game in which everyone downs a shot whenever a character has a flashback scene. And to add insult to injury, there are actually flashbacks WITHIN flashbacks!!

When they finally meet the possessed people from the colony, I couldn't help but laugh until I almost cried. All of the bad guys literally look like Marilyn Manson clones. The leader, who is billed in the credits as Big Daddy Mars (LOL!!), speaks in some kind of gibberish and walks around scowling and occasionaly getting set on fire.

The last half hour or so is basically a yawn-inducing battle in which Natasha and the military group trying to get away from the outpost alive. All of the fighting looked extremely stiff and faked. It was especially annoying that whenever an explosion occurred, you could count on 2 to 3 people flying through the air after obviously bouncing off of an off-screen trampoline (watch the behind the scenes featurette for evidence of this.)

By, the time this movie finished, I felt like someone had taken my brain out of my head, attempted to bounce it on the floor close to a 100 times, and then sloppily tried to put it back in. This movie really is that bad.

All of the actors involved looked like they were only interested in getting paid. And it wouldn't be a true Natasha Henstridge film without a scene of her in some really tight fitting underwear.

The sets look like something left over from the old Star Trek series from the 60's and the special effects mainly consist of a few poor looking decapitations and dismemberments.

Any John Carpenter fan can see that all he did was combine elements from Assault on Precinct 13, The Thing and Prince of Darkness into this movie.

The DVD consists of a commentary track featuring John Carpenter and Natasha and I was especially disheartened as to how unaware John was about how awful this movie actually turned out. He was completely happy with the final product!! John claimed that he wanted to make a futuristic version of an old-fashioned western. So why did this get marketed as a horror film then?! It seems that he has completely lost the ability to look at his films from an outsider's point of view, so that he can truly see what he has created. I'm not sure what is going on with him. But this movie and his last, the equally bad Vampires, gave me a one-two punch that nearly caved my head in.

It will be interesting to see if John will have any sort of a career after this one. They spent close to 30 million making this movie (it doesn't show) and it made back 1 or 2. He needs to really take some time off and reflect back on his career before he tackles his next project.",1130889600,4,4657,4.598795180722892

The plot is really as simple as it gets

(NOTE: SPOILER FOLLOWS)... a cloud of some kind of microorganism is released and possesses the local humans. That's the plot, in a nutshell. The rest is just a running gun battle.

Why? Simply because it had a reasonably good cast. Natasha Henstridge (now dating UK singer Darius, the lucky girl), Ice Cube, Bruce Willis lookalike Jason Statham, Clea DuVall, and Pam Grier.

The main cast are after the bad murderer played by Ice Cube. On Mars. Of course. In the far off future. For some strange reason, Pam Grier's character is the only one who's qualified for want of a better word to go after this guy. The rest of her crew include a pill-popper, the new guy who fancies his chances with the pill popper, and TweedleDee & TweedleDum rookies.

The movie's told completely in flashback, with flashbacks in flashbacks - confusing? Not really. There are some other strange bits in the movie, like it's never explained why exactly the ghosts are ghosts, who have all previously starred in Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" video. And their leader's inspiration is Marilyn Manson. It uses the old cliche that the ghosts can take over people's bodies, except in the cool way you see a red mist going towards them when it wants to take them over.

With so many ""zombie"" movies around at the moment (Shaun of the Dead, Dawn of the Dead remake etc), it's strange to watch this. There's a whole hooha from other reviewers about how John Carpenter has done better films yadeyadeyada. Have I ever seen John Carpenter movie apart from this? If I have, then I can't remember it. Will I be interested in seeing any others? Will they explain exactly why the 'ghosts' suddenly went mad? Will Clea Duvall actually smile in any of her roles? And why doesn't Jason Stratham get his kit off? This is an OK movie, apart from the lack of explanation about the ghosts.

1319760,1,B00003CY6O,"I've read some of the reviews already posted here, and a lot of folks either flat-out loved this film or thought it stunk. Unfortunately, I find myself more aligned with the latter group, although ""stunk"" may be too strong a word. I'm actually more disappointed than anything else.
I'm a big fan of John Carpenter and B-movie schlock in general. My favorite Carpenter film is ""The Thing."" To this day, I think it's a barf-bag/gross-out masterpiece. I've watched it an embarrassing number of times and I have yet to grow tired of it.
I've just seen ""Ghosts of Mars"" after having rented the DVD. I really, really wanted to like this film, but I just couldn't do it -- even after having watched it a second time to see if maybe I'd missed something.
If only there had been decent plot development, meaningful dialog, competent acting (the best of the lot is Ice Cube, as ""Desolation"" Williams) or good special effects, it might have stood a chance at the box office. No such luck. For me, its most noteworthy feature is the fact that Natasha Henstridge actually manages to keep her clothes on during the entire movie.
The train visuals and music that accompany the opening credits aren't too bad, but things go rapidly downhill from there. I won't rehash the plot, as it's already been discussed at length in other reviews. Suffice it to say that when the movie ended, I was still waiting for something halfway believable to happen.
I do want to address one aspect of the film's premise that I haven't seen mentioned in any of the reviews I've read here. ""Desolation"" Williams is supposed to be this big, bad, ultra-nasty murderer, right? So who is sent to transport him from one location to another? Competent people, maybe? Nope. We get a known pill-popper (Henstridge, as Ballard), two rookies (Clea Duvall and Liam Waite), and a ""new guy"" (Jason Statham) no one seems to know too much about, but whose main activity is trying to put the make on Ballard.
A fifth member of the transport team (Commander Helena Braddock, played by Pam Grier) is the only one who seems even remotely qualified for the assignment, although she apparently has the hots for Ballard as well (oh, the problems of being drop-dead gorgeous). Braddock isn't around very long, though. After her depature, we're left with Drug-Taking Cop, Sex Fiend Cop, and Tweedle-Dee and Tweedle-Dum Cops to successfully transport Nasty Murderer to Intended Destination. Does this make sense? Nope, not to me.
Throughout the film, the main characters act so illogically that I just couldn't bring myself to care about them. The plot is riddled with holes and continuity problems. Most of the dialog is so ridiculous that I don't know how the actors kept straight faces while delivering their lines. (""Maybe I'd sleep with you if you were the last man on Earth, but we're not on Earth."" Groan.)
Even the scenes without dialog are silly. The worst offender is the interminable sequence during which Henstridge demonstrates how adept she's become at rolling her eyes up so only the whites are visible. This is something she didn't do nearly as well in ""Species."" I guess the intervening six years gave her plenty of time to practice.
After seeing ""Ghosts of Mars,"" I'm left with one question: What could John Carpenter possibly have been thinking? Whatever it was, I hope it moves on -- much as the ghosts in the film vacate bodies they occupy once those bodies are killed -- and lets John Carpenter be himself once again.
Meanwhile, I intend to keep the faith and remain a fan. That having been said, I think I'll go watch ""The Thing"" for the 1,734th time.",1089849600,3,3611,4.751592356687898
1319761,4,B00003CY6O,"It's John Carpenter, so what does everyone expect?  I know what I expected, and ""Ghosts of Mars"" pretty much delivered.  Thudding sound track, B-movie dialogue, heads on stakes, ""Road Warrior"" like zanies with metal sticking out of their faces stalking the ""good"" guys.  Bring on the popcorn.  Then there's a humorous twist.  The ""guys"" in this future world live in a Matriarchy.  Guys make the coffee, defer to the women, but also are told to deal with mechanical problems when they arise.  (Well, at least the ""breeder"" - Jason Statham as Jericho - does.)  Carpenter works all kinds of little jokes into the script on this wrinkle alone.  Natasha Henstridge as the tough cop hero, and Ice Cube, as the con hero, are serviceable - and they know when to shoot, kick, and punch.  And that's all that's needed here.  I don't know who the main Martian is (he looks like Marilyn Manson in Kabuki), but he's perfect!  Four stars for operating well within genre.",1088294400,29,956,4.7272727272727275

Such a shame then, that ""Master of Soiling His Own Name"" John Carpenter should ruin it by trying to make Ghosts of Mars ""Assault on Precint 13 in Space"", and turning out a straight to video clunker instead of the classic this might have been.
Case in point: Ice Cube's Desolation Williams, though watchable, is far too nice for a murderer. and he doesn't even kill anyone, he robs someone, and that's how they catch him. Excuse me? NO!!!
The movie delivers the kind of action you'd expect from Carpenter, but it is too seen it all before. And it does not make use of Jason Statham, who, if you watch the transporter is far from the pussy he is shown to be here. and let's not talk about Pam Grier's pork rib acting. she should probably be given an award for ""Most Unconvincing Lesbian Ever"", among others.
Admittedly, the thing looks good, and plenty of stuff blows up and gets chopped off, but you would have a better time to just watch a pig being chopped up: it provides both the gore and the ham of this film, and takes less time to endure.

Wes may be hip wit da teens, but John does what he wants to, even if you think it's lame.  Ghosts Of Mars isn't his finest hour, it's not even all that great, but it's Carpenter.  This is the kind of film Carpenter has always made.  He's never admitted to being more than a B film director and he chooses to be such.  After Starman, he coulda been in the big time, but chose his own independent Prince Of Darkness over the Hollywood machine.  Ghosts Of Mars would have had more critical and fan praise if it were released in the mid eighties.  It wouldn't have seemed so cliched.  Personally I admire him for making such a film, passe as it may seem.  If I were you I'd check it out.

1319859,3,B00003CY6O,"Ghosts of Mars (John Carpenter, 2001)
Man, was everyone down on this movie or what? Come on, folks. This wasn't great art, and it wasn't meant to be. It's simple turn-your-brain-off fun that follows the formula of most of John Carpenter's earlier flicks to every dotted I and crossed T. And while that seems to be exactly what had the fans howling in the aisles, please, folks, help me out here.
Okay, so all the guns exist today even though it's in the future. (Escape from New York, anyone?) The bad guys look a lot more like the guys from GWAR than they do actual bad guys. (Vampires, They Live, erm, the crazies from Escape from New York.) The action runs a very taut line between not gory enough and ludicrously faked. (Escape from New York-- are you sensing a pattern here?) So what? Everyone overlooked it twenty years ago.
The basic idea is that a team of space marines has to go get a prisoner, Desolation Jones (Ice Cube of Trespass and Friday fame), from a remote outpost and take him back to HQ to stand trial. Problem is, when they get there, they found out a whole lot of crimes matching the ones he's supposed to have committed have happened while he was in his holding cell. So the team, headed up by a drug-addled Lieutenant (Natasha McElhone), her commander (Pam Grier), and their new officer, an overly cocky and wildly oversexed Sergeant (Jason Statham, best known for his Guy Ritchie films) figure there's something nasty going on, and have to figure out what it is and how to stop it before the train, which has gone on to make a few more stops, gets back.
No, you're not going to find great acting, the plot's been done before, and, well, it's about as silly as can be. But folks, that's pretty much what John Carpenter has always been about, from Dark Star till the present day. Some of his movies forget to be humorous, some of them forget to be scary, some of them are just sci-fi action pictures. That's what this one is. Things blow up, the bad guys chase the good guys, things blow up, people bond, things blow up, you get the idea. Turn your brain off and enjoy the ride. ** ",1078704000,3,2105,4.425257731958763

Please tell me that the people who gave this film anything more than two stars are kidding right? Have you ever seen another John Carpenter movie? What is wrong with you people? This is NOT return to form. This is NOT even a good film. The acting is abysmal and if anything John Carpenter has got worse - No! Strike that - he is now the #1 nose-diving director in the history of cinema. In the 1970s, 1980 and even early 1990s Carpenter ruled. Even his mediocre films where better than average and worthy of repeat viewings and certainly DVD ownership. Then came - Village of the Damned (1995), Escape from L.A. (1996), Vampires (1998)... and now Ghosts of Mars (2001)... BOMB, BOMB, BOMB and now the ultimate John Carpenter TRAINWRECK has arrived. Not only is this film devoid of suspense or a coherent storyline but it is also Carpenter's most stupid work to date. The man is not only in quicksand but he IS quicksand, taking down everything he touches with him. Natasha Henstridge has her lamest role to date as she plays an intergalactic cop who is hooked on some LSD drug that actually plays a vital plot twist in saving her from becoming infected. WHAT??? Ice Cube plays a con turned good guy who is there to do what these ex-rappers are stereotypically doing in all these movies... playing to the audience that come to see their one-liners and machismos. Jason Statham, fresh from the movie ""Snatch"", takes on a career low point as a cop in the background running around looking paranoid and angry. The poor Pam Grier had to suffer through this one for only a few minutes but even when she is on the screen boy does it seem like Jackie Brown is something of an acting miracle for her. Worst of all is Clea DuVall. You will be shocked to see her scene in what has to be the worst bit of action acting in the history of cinema as she stands on a sand dune trying to shoot the monsters. I nearly fell clean out of my chair just seeing her arms going back and forth in the most pathetic attempt at a performance you will ever see - ""Help me Mr. Carpenter! Just what is it that I am supposed to be doing here again????"". Reply - ""Shut up and keep dancing up and down as if you are firing those guns at something."" She isn't even looking at what she is shooting. She isn't even paying attention to what her arms are doing. It is like she is having a fit on film. Maybe that scene alone is worth watching this movie for.
The plot.. oh good heavens... is about a prison on Mars that has just become host to some sort of a ""ghost"" defence system that turns people into quasi-zombie-neanderthal maniacs that hunt down whoever they see. The leader of that group looks quite nasty but this is pitifully - No, Strike that... pathetically mishandled in the worst way that your mind can possibly conceive. Nothing will prepare you for how OUTRAGOUSLY BAD this movie actually is. Carpenter should be put on ""suicide watch"" after making this one.",1073952000,11,3109,4.4275741710296685

The results might fall short of Carpenter at his best, but there is no denying the movie has enough energy (in the good, old fashioned rough and tumble sense - no wire-fu or bullet time digital hijinks found here, thank goodness) and humor to hold a forgiving fans interest.

1319866,3,B00003CY6O,"Ghost of Mars is the type of movie they don't seem to make anymore.  John Carpenter borrows elements from a number of his previous films, most obviously Assault on Precinct 13, The Thing, and The Fog, as well as genre staples like Night of the Living Dead, Aliens, and the entire western genre.  He also foregoes the excessive CGI typical of a sci-fi action film these days and settles into B-movie territory with gusto.  He loves cheese, he loves rebellious statements about society and politics delivered between head bashing action and heavy metal riffs.
In the year 2176, some cops (led by the gorgeous Natasha Henstridge) are traveling to a mining city on Mars to transfer a dangerous prisoner (Ice Cube).  They find the city completely empty save for a few bodies, but the prisoners are still sitting in jail.  It's not long before they discover a tribe of very angry mutants who seem to enjoy self-mutilation, sharp weapons, and a lot of killing.  It turns out that some miners unwittingly unlocked a vault that was keeping some kind of alien life form thingee trapped inside, so we have a little bit of The Keep as well.  (Now there's a bad sci fi movie to borrow from if there ever was one).  This life form is airborne and takes over people, turning them into speedy zombies that like driving blades through their own flesh, screaming a lot in front of bonfires, and wreaking havoc.
So we get some Rio Bravo (the basis for Assault) action as the cops and criminals band together to blow away the creatures with weapons from the present day.  Strange, but today's soldiers seem better equipped than the people in this movie are; it would be like outfitting the US Army in 2003 with muskets.
The head zombie looks like he should be fronting a Norwegian Black Metal band as his role calls for a lot of screaming, waving of a rubbery sword, and Viking action, and the other zombies look like understudies for KISS or GWAR, which lends the film a silly, fun quality.  I'm not sure why they're so angry, especially since the humans freed them...
Henstridge clearly cannot act; not sure if Species had a bigger budget than this or not, but that film at least had her running around naked when the violence wasn't exploding on the screen.  Her face is very chiseled, but she seems to be thinking of something else (her best 'acting' comes during her drug induced high battle with the demons).  Pam Grier shows up, briefly, before her severed head makes an appearance.  Jason Statham is always fun with his English equivalent of a Brooklyn accent.  Ice Cube, as the criminal James 'Desolation' Williams (er, right) scowls most of the time and gets to do some gangsta action with two guns (check out that chrome plated gun at the end) as well as sport a leather jacket that looks like he wore it to the set that day.  Joanna Cassidy shows up to give some exposition and little else.
This is a fatalistic movie, with most of the characters eventually being sliced and diced.  It has a typical Carpenter ending, which is always welcome amid the typical Hollywood action endings.  There's even a pro-drug message at one point (go Carpenter!)
However, what I can't figure out is how this film, made in 2001, can look cheaper than lower budget flicks Carpenter made earlier in his career.  If Carpenter was going for pure B-movie fodder, he succeeded almost too well.  In typical Carpenter fashion, the director composes the music himself (apparently with help of Anthrax). It seems hard to believe it even got a theatrical release, given the look of the film.  It's like it fell out of 1982 or something, with sets that look like they sprinkled some Star Trek props with red dust.  Apparently, people can breathe on Mars now, even with those hot white lights that Carpenter has hanging just out of camera range.
I love John Carpenter, but I have to wonder what's up with his career.  He probably has difficulty getting funding for his movies, and I fear another movie like this and he could be off to straight-to-DVD-land.  He does, however, get a lot of credit for just not caring about typical Hollywood norms anymore and doing what he wants to do (remaking his previous films).
Ghosts of Mars is a cheesy movie, period.  Carpenter clearly misses B-movies of yore, genre films that didn't have to be mega-blockbusters.  It's definitely a good cheap DVD pickup with plenty of potential for repeat viewings of the mayhem that ensues on screen (have to love the head zombies excessive screaming and posing).  This might offend even Carpenter addicts, but it's a guilty pleasure, completely, totally unpretentious, and fun.",1066953600,2,4617,4.72568578553616

I won't be a ""spoiler"" to those that wish to view it but I will add that there is a great predictability factor present. One example is labeling two characters as ""rookies"". I knew then that those two would have a short onscreen ""life span"".
You can spot the plot inconsistencies MILES before they occur. There are so many unanswered questions by the end of the picture that one might wonder if the screenwriter had finished primary school.

There is nothing new to the look of these films, nothing special about the storyline, nothing unique or even interesting about the special effects.  Ghosts of Mars is truly an awful movie, even for a B horror film.  Aside from the lunacies of the story, the fact is that there is no suspense at all.  The tale is told as a flashback from Natasha Henstridge's character's viewpoint, and while the fate of a single character is somewhat uncertain, we're sure at the beginning that most everyone is cannon fodder.  The monsters look like a cross between Alice Cooper, TNA Wrestlers, and the Orcs from Lord of the Rings--except the Orcs look better and are more frightening.

Like Vampires I thought this movie is average at the most when I saw it for the first time. But after some time I watched it again and I began to like it. The actors are acting very good, except NATASHA HENSTRIDGE - she is a rookie and stikes it bad!
I really think the first impression is not so important. Watch movies a second time and consider your thoughts again! This counts for music as well. Ghosts of Mars wasn't that bad, was it?

1320054,2,B00003CY6O,"It really hurts me to write this review, since there is no way that i can say anything positive about this movie. I have been a fan of John Carpenter ever since Halloween, and didn't think i would ever watch a bad movie made by him, but here it is. The story is thin, the actors awful and the directorial job nonexistent. This is not a ""fun"" b-movie like Prince of darkness or Village of the damned, just a plain bad movie.
I will give it two stars: One for the movie, and one for old friendships sake. Better luck next time Mr Carpenter!",1036800000,,538,4.1826923076923075
1320055,3,B00003CY6O,"Part music video, part wrestling match (complete with makeup)...Ghosts of Mars has a lot to offer but goes about telling the story in a rather strange way.  Henstridge plays an officer who is found to be the only survivor on a train that came back from Mars and she begins to tell her story through flashbacks.  Through the retelling though even her character go back and forth with flashbacks, got to pay attention here.  Seems ghosts have been let loose in the mining camp and have inhabited everyone and Henstridge and her officers who went to pick up big, bad Ice Cube (playing prisoner ""Desolation"") are trapped and need to get out.  Doesn't sound so bad, but the movie goes about the telling like I said with flashbacks and flashforwards and music video styling, then the weird casting of Pam Grier and Joanna Cassidy to add to the mix.  Overall it's not so awful.  Just good fun on a Saturday night with a bowl of popcorn....a bit cheesy, a bit corny, a bit gory, and a bit of fun, hey it's John Carpenter!  ENJOY!!",1033776000,,1022,4.521739130434782
1320056,1,B00003CY6O,"John Carpenter did Halloween, yes? He did! And he also created The Thing and The Fog. All three of those were creative horror movies full of spirit (Well, the spirit of horror). Let's take John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars and compare this to those movies. Oops, we can't. Because Ghosts of Mars [stunk] beyond total belief. I believe that is the harshest words I've ever used for a movie. But I believe it's true. The acting was terrible (Except that given by Jason Statham as Jericho). I expected so much more from Pam Grier and Clea Duvall, but got nothing. The concept was a very good one, but it was executed without any interest. And there were so many characters that at one point, I wondered where one of them came from.
 The only good stuff about Ghosts of Mars is: The makeup. The makeup effects were extremely awesome. That being of the mauled faces of the ""ghosts."" There were a lot of ammo wasting / battle scenes, and those were good and tightly paced. The scenes just seemed to not matter much when you don't care for the characters much (And there's really no use anyway as . . . allow me not to spoil this even though I despised it).
 The DVD has some features that I really didn't care for so I didn't watch them.
 Sorry if I seem so bitter about this movie. I can't even believe I sat throughout the entire thing. Or wait, I did wait to see if Clea Duvall brought anything to the movie. She didn't. A shame. I still love her as an actress though.",1033257600,3,1463,4.3321167883211675
1320057,5,B00003CY6O,"... Carpenter is king, and this movie is a sly, cool homage, send-up to his own style, his influences, and so forth. In a way it has just about every Carpenter motif there is, especially the nods to THE THING and RIO BRAVO. Cube and Syl make a great team, and the red and black color scheme is relaxing and sexy. Just understand that Carpenter has his tongue too deeply in his cheek for any normal man to see. So stop asking why and start asking why not? .... One day, John's name will be among them in the ranks of great filmmakers inspired by Hollywood. ....",1032912000,6,560,4.242990654205608
1320058,2,B00003CY6O,"I see many elements of Assault on Precinct 13 and The Thing in this movie. In one scene where the possessed miners break into the building with the battering ram, they began swarming inside. The way they were getting in and trying to get at the humans reminded me of that one scene in Assault on Precinct 13. When the cops arrive at the beginnning of the movie, it has that ""What the hell happened?"" feel just like in The Thing.  The Thing and Assault on Precinct 13 are way better. Another thing about this movie: THE FLASHBACKS!!!! It would have been better if they found Natasha and she told the story in one flashback. But there are flashbacks within a flashback. Plus they keep going back into the interrogation room and Natasha explains more about the story. Here's something else I don't like: Natasha and Ice Cube seem indestructible throughout the movie while everyone else dies. One of the Martian spirits try to possess Natasha at one point but somehow she drives it out! Then she tries to go back inside. When they finally let her in, they point guns at her. Another element from The Thing. The ending [wasn't good] too. I don't have to explain it. Just stick to John's classics.",1032652800,,1191,4.565420560747664
1320148,5,B00003CY6O,"Mr. Bruce Rux asked 'Why?' about ""Ghosts of Mars"". I thought he deserved some specific answers to his many questions.
Mars is ruled by a matriarchy. WHY?
- And why not? Men don't have the exclusive in power. Nobody's asking why our society is a 'patriarchy'. Mrs. Hilary Clinton will probably be the next president of the United States and nobody'll be asking why. Margaret Thatcher's been for a long time the first person in Great Britain and nobody asked why. Don't be another macho one!
A man cuts off his own thumb. WHY?
- Because he's a strong drug addict. Just before he does it, he filled his brains with nitrous mix through a black market breather, a Laugher. And as Jericho explains, that nitrous stuff turns your brains into cheese. In two words, it makes you dummy, totally unsensitive and unconscious. That's why he cuts off his thumb without even noticing right away.
The entire movie is told in multiple flashbacks. WHY?
- You mustn't go to movies very often, pal. ""Ghosts of Mars"" isn't the only movie told this way. There are plenty of them. Remember ""Titanic"". Lately there was ""The Hole"". Or Brian de Palma's ""Casualties of War"". Or Carpenter's ""In the Mouth of Madness"". Or ""D.O.A."". Or...
There are flashbacks within flashbacks...WITHIN FLASHBACKS! WHY?
- That's a way of storytelling, like any other one. The main character of the movie is the only survivor of a massacre. Like in ""The Hole"" and many other films. In front of her superiors, she tells everything about what happened to her and the others. The thing is, Melanie Ballard isn't the only one to tell about the events; some other people - inside flashbacks -, especially Dr. Arlene Whitlock, Jericho and Uno, also tell about what happened to them, about what they saw and what's going on around them. They have to, to make things clear for the others - and for us. There's no problem about that. Many people find this way of storytelling complicated and confusing; I'm still wondering how they do it.
Natasha Henstridge stars - and DOESN'T STRIP! WHY?
- Because it's not in her contract - she's not supposed to show her beautiful body every time she makes a movie. Besides the role wasn't written for her, but for Courtney Love, who's far from being as sexy as Natasha. And remember this: in a Carpenter movie, women DON'T strip. They're treated as real human characters, not like simple ... toys, like in Hollywood.
Henstridge is a lawman - er, ""person"" - who allies herself with a notorious criminal...even AFTER the mutual threat they're fighting is over! WHY?
- Pardon me. The mutual threat Melanie and Williams are fighting is NOT over! In the end the ghosts invade the city of Chryse, where Melanie is. Williams comes to rescue her and they keep fighting together. Simple!
ICE CUBE! ON MARS!! WHY?
- Hey guy, it's just a film! Don't mix everything! In ""Total Recall"", Schwarzenegger and Sharon Stone end up on Mars and nobody asked why.
Jailbreakers get themselves locked in the same cell as the guy they're trying to bust out! WHY??
- They don't get themselves locked. They come to rescue Desolation Williams, but Uno, who was keeping an eye on the cops, has a moment of joy and unwariness when he sees his brother again. Melanie uses it and locks them in the cell. Logical.
Joanna Cassidy in a hot-air balloon - ON MARS!! WHY???
- You're dealing with a science-fiction film. It takes place in 2176, at a time when men have made the air breathable on Mars. Not as well as it is on the Earth, but breathable anyway. And don't forget the winds. Another thing you forgot: in the film, Joanna Cassidy is a scientist, and on Mars, the gravity is much lower than on the Earth. So flying in a hot-air balloon is much easier on Mars than on the Earth.
Aeons-old Martian gas makes men into ooga-chaka zombies, who grunt to ""I Can't Stop This Feeling, Deep Inside of Me""!! WHY?!?
- Some possessed men are aware of what happening to them, and in one scene, one of them deals with a human, and he tries to warn her (Melanie), that's all. He cuts his throat because he knows he's already dead, and in order to try to tell the human what's going on.
The Martian zombies dress for a Kiss video - ON MARS!! WHY!?!
- They dress as anything they want, not for what you call a Kiss video. They're not like us, they make a savage, early tribe. And you're right, they're Martian, on Mars. They're here to break any invasion of their planet, and they have to look like determined, pitiless warriors. And they don't care about the Kiss band - they don't even know what it is. Again, don't confuse fiction for reality!
The good guys escape, only to rush back into the jaws of certain doom - FOR NO GOOD REASON!!! WHY!!!
- For no good reason?? I'm gonna give you one good reason: DOMINION!! ""Ghosts of Mars"" isn't only a science-fiction film with elements of western and horror, it's also a reflection about colonialism and the human condition. The purpose of the film is the conquest of Mars. And to make this conquest possible, the so-called 'good guys' have to destroy, completely erase the enemy while it's still only in Shining Canyon, before it gets to Chryse and spreads all over the planet. As Melanie explains: 'It's not their planet any more'. The thing is, the enemy is a gang of ghosts. We can't kill what's already dead, but with an atomic bomb, maybe you'll do it. That's why they take the risk, and unfortunately many human people die. The bomb explodes but doesn't kill the enemy, and in the end Melanie and Desolation have to face it again... and the film finishes. This is an opened ending, like in ""Halloween"". Things will be more complicated on Mars than they were on the Earth, with the Indians. You can't kill what's not alive! Maybe they'll be making a sequel...
You said that nothing in the film makes sense - you're totally wrong. Everything in ""Ghosts of Mars"" makes sense. John Carpenter is not a primary filmmaker, he's one of the best ones still working. Maybe the best one. Like many other people in the U.S., you didn't understand much about this movie - if you didn't try to. Now I hope you will! You said that you love it, so why don't you try to understand it? And when you say that it's as bad as ""Battlefield Earth"", I don't agree, not at all. ""Battlefield Earth"" is another Hollywood complete disaster, and ""Ghosts of Mars"", a great independent work. Both films can't be compared, and you can't compare Carpenter to...

The special features were good especially the scoring of ghost of mars! The scoring was awesome because, Anthrax and Buckethead did the music!

THi history is full of holes, the main question being: What made the ghost spirits choose what body tehy would invade or not? The movie clearly shows that proximity was not the rule. So, what was?
But the worst part wasy the casting of Ice Cube as the ""anti-hero"". While NAtasha did a good job, Ice Cube was a joke, burying even further down any ""credibility"" this movie could aspire to have. Got nothing against him, I'm only complaining about his acting in this particular movie. It was beyond hope.
Other than this, Pam Grier's brief appearance was a shock, but I guess that actress at this age can not lose opportunities to work, and she must thanks Carpenter for giving her the role of a determined, altough brief, commander.
The end was a joke, a classic signature to remind all of us that this is indeed a trash feast.
Bottom Line here: Only for die-hard fans of Class B and trash movies.",1030924800,2,1093,4.49748743718593
1320151,1,B00003CY6O,"My title kind of gives away where this review is going as the first 5 minutes of the movie set the tone for what has to be one of the most unbearably terrible films in 10 years.
The plot is pointless really, but even worse is the directorial style. It's not that I don't understand the ""B-movie campy"" atmosphere he is setting here, but with 28 million you would figure Carpenter would do a bit better job. The costumes and characters were weak and weakly written respectively. Even though the characters all pretty much have to die, it seems like they go out of their way to make it happen as opposed to being the logical progression of the plot.  (""Let's go back, we own this planet now"", or something to that effect.)
Someone before mentioned this being ""inspired"" directing?!? Inspired by a 4 year old on ridalin maybe. The visual feel could have been helped with using a red tinted lens to give the planet that ""Mars, red planet look"" For effective use of the method see ""Traffic"" and even the uninspired ""Mission to Mars"" but none of this was to be,...the directing is beyond subpar, the plot's B-Movie appeal is lost on everyone but a few viewers and John Carpenter. Either make the movie funny, or dramatic. the actors aren't good enough, the directing isn't good enough for them to balance the two.
Waste not your time or money unless this is supposed to be a gag gift,...and even then you're better off with something else,...the laughs will be had by the guy selling you the video, not by whoever you get this for.",1030752000,3,1525,4.52536231884058
1320152,1,B00003CY6O,"This movie was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  The acting is horrible; Natasha Henstridge is monotonous and her face doesn't change at all while she acts, and none of the other characters are convincing at all.  The movie is very annoying with the countless flashbacks.  The set looks fake.  The plot is confusing and scattered.  I guess I'd say get it if you are a hardcore John Carpenter fan; I'm not, and if the rest of his movies are anything like this, I never will be.",1030665600,,485,4.344444444444444
1320153,1,B00003CY6O,"I made it through an hour of this movie, but could go no further. Reasons? The script and dialogue seem to have been written by a seventh grader. Godawful, anonymous heavy metal music explodes from the soundtrack at all times. It contains relentless, repulsive, hideous gore - apparently an attempt to induce as much vomiting as possible from the folks who actually paid money to view this film. To what group of humans this movie would appeal, I can't imagine, but if they exist, they surely wouldn't be too far off from the mindless, violent zombies in the film. What sane person would enjoy watching scene after scene of heads and other body parts being chopped off, people being shot and in pain, and the so-called acting of Ice Cube? This is the type of movie that inspires lunatics to go on shooting sprees, and even worse, more rappers to think about acting careers.
John Carpenter peaked in 1978 with Halloween, and has been going steadily downhill ever since. It's getting so bad that his name in a movie's title is now synonymous with ""big budget bomb"". How can a man, who showed so much directing talent with Halloween, spend the next 20 years making totally incompetent movies that appear to be geared only towards the psychopaths and/or high-schoolers in our society? (the answer's in the next paragraph). There he was in '78, displaying his brilliant cinematography and particularly lighting and musical skills, and now here he is making grade Z, straight-to-video bombs of ultraviolence choreographed to heavy metal. Wow, what a transformation - one that fascinates me because it's been so consistent. Even when he has a good idea (""They Live""), he can't resist screwing those up too - in that one, by casting a wrestler in the lead role who can't act. He seems admirably determined to ruin his own movies, especially with his casting choices. Gotta give him credit - he tries so hard to wreck his films, and he's succeeded every single time since Halloween.
""Ghosts Of Mars"" is a total failure, and is riddled with every horror/sci-fi cliche you can find in Ebert's Little Movie Glossary. I might expect this out of a first-time director, but not a vet like Carpenter. It's hard to come up with any other conclusion than to realize he stopped caring about quality in 1978, and decided to condescend to the idiots in the world who demand crap like this, and who presumably yell and cheer wildly during such scenes as Ice Cube running around with guns in both hands shooting zombies and shouting profane cliches. In other words, $$$. It's a shame to see $28 mil wasted on this garbage, presumably spent getting some 'talented' person to make a LOT of real-looking decapitated heads. It's an even bigger shame to see Pam Grier in a film like this, after it looked like she was having a comeback with ""Jackie Brown"". Only two positive things I can say about this movie: Natasha Henstridge is a hottie and can act a little, and the special effects are excellent, but for $28 mil, they should be.",1029715200,4,3006,4.738549618320611

You might get the impression I hate this movie.  I don't.  I actually love it.  It's one of my personal favorites.  I honestly couldn't stop cat-calling it out loud at the theater  -  and I NEVER cat-call movies (at least, in public).
But that's exactly why you have to see this movie.  It's just UNGODLY fun.  This is THE perfect movie, for your own Friday night Mystery Science Theater party.  It's as bad as Battlefield Earth, but much more gorgeously produced, and much, MUCH funnier.
Don't sit there, wondering WHY?  Buy it, and find out.  You'll watch it over and over again, marveling with each new viewing at the unbelievable WHYS??? you missed on your previous viewings.

1320274,3,B00003CY6O,"Remember that terrible film ""Anaconda""?  Yeah, that one with hammy actors including Angelina's dad, and a big, bad snake with a leading lady Ms. Lopez.  Let's forget that ""Ghosts of the Mars"" is directed by John Carpenter, and think this way.  Take out Ms. Lopez (cos she is now doing a bigger film), and throw in Natasha ""Spieces"" Henstrige there as an investigator on the Mars, who has to transport Ice Cube (who was also in that jungle), a supposed murderer.  But as she and her crew (including members with politically correct ethnic and sexual diversion) are attacked by the Goth ghosts that crawl like monkeys, Henstrige's heroine knows that the only way to survive is to make a dubious pact with Ice Cube and his men.
See?  This is not a genuine horror film; nor it's a sci-fi thriller.  This is rather a new version of western films that is set on the Mars in the future, with ""Stagecoach"" situation.  And westerns are made within comparatively lower budgets, as you know.
Try to think that way; otherwise, you'll be hugely disappointed with this cheap-looking, trashy, apparently sci-fi film.  The land looks as if shot with a tons of red-colored earth (it's the Mars, you see!), but it is obvious that the place is somewhere in New Mexico.  And the actors look tired (probably it's too hot there), but the loud music (including that of the Anthrax) will batter your nerves, trying to cheer up their spirits.  And to make the earth redder, the zombies attack the actors in a ""Starship Troopers"" way, chopping their bodies into pieces.
Frankly, the editing is so poor that sometimes you cannot tell what is going on, and the acting is less than average.  The names of the players are fairly impressive -- besides Ice Cube and Natasha Henstrige, you got Clea Duvall, Jason Statham, Joanna Cassidy, and even Pam Grier.  But their roles are all unmemorable, especially that of Pam Grier is too lamentable.  I don't say much about the plot because there is little of that, but it is certain that the overuse of flashbacks is draining the momentum of the film considerably, letting us know the end of the story earlier than the film should do.
As an entertainment, this film has some charm of watching midnight TV program with 6-packed beer.  If you accept its trashy charm as it is, you will enjoy it.  However, if you want something really scary or with style, like ""Halloween,"" you don't look at this one.",1026691200,,2411,4.680094786729858
1320275,5,B00003CY6O,"I went to the theater to see this one, as I love Carpenter. And when the movie ended I was not disappointed. It is a cult movie from its very conception. This film doesn't want to be the hit of the season, and that's why it rules so much. The sets are great, the actors could be better, but I think that would be bad for the overall result. Nevertheless, Ice Cube is the best here, and his line ""Come on you miners MF!"" is the best part of the movie. Also, I think Carpenter made a kind of mixture of his career highlights with some ""Assault on Precinct 13"", ""Prince of Darkness"" and ""Vampires"". The Carpenter fan will love this movie, and those who are not especially fond of Carpenter's legacy should give it a try too.

1320276,3,B00003CY6O,"The premise was pretty funny with a squad going to transfer a criminal in a Mars prison. Ice Cube was hilarious as the innocent James ""Desolation"" Williams and Natasha Henstridge played Lt. Ballard, a no nonsense woman. The year was 2176 and there was a mysterious smoke that took over human beings. It made them into Marilyn Manson fans and had them piercing themselves. I was appalled with the creatures because they didn't speak any English with their pierced tongues and all they did was get in the way.  The transfer was supposed to be routine, but Williams' friends joined him for some comic relief. ""Who you calling scumbag? MF!"" That was some funny schtick. Criminals and the group of police joined forces and fought the ghastly demons. They carried saw blades and sticks. The crazy Manson fans also knew where to put heads. It was disgusting! There were a lot of flashbacks in this movie that were unnecessary, thus lowering my score for the picture. John Carpenter has made better movies, but this isn't a bad effort.

1320277,1,B00003CY6O,"There's a gruesome bit of stuff where this white faced nutter beheads a few people erroneously making you think that you're in for a tasty bit of Carpenter grand guignol. But oddly, it doesn't happen. It's as if Carpenter gathered his cast round and told them that they didn't have the time or money to employ stunt doubles for all of them so they should just go out there and fight but try not to hurt each other, defeating the whole point of a picture like this. The result is one of the most bizarre chase scenes ever filmed, with actors fighting in almost slow motion. In the middle of the whole sorry melange, the white faced dude keeps stopping and screaming at the camera, presumably in anguish over his thoughtless beheading of the planet's only registered dentist. Does anyone remember 'The Andy Williams Show' from the sixties? It used to have two cavemen that would leap in the air and freeze in mid flight before dropping to the ground. This chase sequence made me feel quite nostalgic for old Andy. You'd get a feeble explosion and up would pop a caveman from behind a rock. I half expected the bear from 'The Andy Williams Show' to swoop down on a jet pack asking for cookies. My God, he would have been welcome company, not to mention probably the only one who could actually land a punch on someone.
Another bright move was to have two of the women have that same silver hair as the kids in 'Village Of The Damned' (a homage to himself?) At one point I thought it was Natasha Henstridge who had her head chopped off but it was a case of mistaken identity.
Carpenter himself seems cheerfully unconcerned at the prospect of his career going down ... and appears to be having a whale of a time in the commentary (what I heard of it.) How bad can it get waking up every morning as a film director and knowing you're about to spend the day with Natasha Henstridge? In one hilarious moment he asks Mrs Henstridge how she approaches her craft. ""I...er...it comes er...from within"" she dissembles wildly. He needles her about her past as a model and tries to get her to gossip about that scene but she nervously declines, mentioning only some ""nice dinner parties"". He goes for cynical chuckles over the cheapo train model. Careful about underestimating your fans, John (or fan, after this debacle.)

Our 'heroes' are all one-dimensional creations that you hope will fall victim to the savages, so much so that you no longer care that you know from the start who will survive you just wish they would get on with it. Mercifully it is at least short.

Melanie Ballard (a role originally slated for Courtney Love, but she bowed out due to an injury), a Mars policewoman sent on a mission with Pam Grier, Jason Statham, and Clea Duvall to find notorius criminal James ""Desolation"" Williams, played with cheesy menace by Ice Cube.  When they arrive however, they learn an ancient long imprisoned Martian spirit has escaped and infested itself into every person mining on Mars, making the movie a cross between Carpenter's Assault on Precinct 13 and Night of the Living Dead.  As with every other Carpenter film, there is a lot of gorey violence as well as Carpenter's heavy metal tuned musical score (featuring Anthrax and Buckethead no less), but the special effects are rather lackluster, and I for one expected a lot better.  Henstridge and Statham turn out rather good performances, but I felt Ice Cube's character could have used a lot more character development that would have made the film progress more smoothly.  All in all, Ghosts of Mars has cult classic written all over it, and while it may not be one of Carpenter's better films, it's still worth a look.",1022284800,2,1505,4.810077519379845

John Carpenter's Ghosts Of Mars decided to choose the latter and ultimately fails to generate any scares while taking itself way too seriously to even generate campy entertainment value.
It could have been a very cool movie had the budget been raised from the expendature of a Wendy's Kids Meal, because there are a few cool gore and decapitation scenes, not to mention a near ingenious concept (Angry spirits of long-dead martians possess nearby humans etc.) and a killer soundtrack by Anthrax and Buckethead, but those alone can't improve the quality of Carpenter's latest fiasco.",1022112000,,837,5.161764705882353

I found the movie to be more interesting than I bargained for, considering that the plot was based on Zombies on Mars.  With plenty of action and gore, it's well worth checking out.  Ice Cube gives a standard hard man performance and Henstridge plays her part well.  John Carpenter can turn any dodgy monster flick into something worth watching.  Carpenter has this uncanny nack of making bad films so fantastic that while gasping at the ridiculousness of the films, I can't help but dip my hat to a true master of his craft.",1021248000,,789,4.475524475524476

Of course I understand th B-movie type of feel, but is it supposed to be bad-funny, like a joke or something? I watched this appalling film, hoping to see some John Carpenter magic & all I got was formula, predictable trash. Too many people liked ""Escape from New York"" in my view. All the actors are in it because it's J.C. directing, but everyone is miscast & trying to make something out of a bad script. I'm sorry ,but I just can't believe ""Ice Cube"" is Mars' most notorious criminal no matter how tough he trys to look. Kurt Russell as Snake Pliskin is more believeable.
On a positive note, the audio commentary with John & Natasha is hilarious & beats the movie hands down for entertainment value. So my suggestion is, grab the DVD just for the commentary.",1019952000,,911,4.461077844311378
1320381,2,B00003CY6O,"I was quite excited as I sat down to watch this for the first time (cause I'm a big fan of Halloween, The Thing, Big Trouble and Escape from New York), but I did have a slight worry that it may be one of his more poor quality films (Village of the Damned, Vampires, Escape from LA). Unfortunately, for me it was the latter. It started well, but as it went on I got bored because it all feels very unoriginal and sort of pointless.
I thought maybe it would be saved by the action and horror, but it wasn't really. Theres a couple of cool moments, a few cool slow-mo kicks and Ice Cube firing two machine guns at once, but nothing that really makes you root for them. It certainly wasn't tense or scary at any point. The main bad guy (Big Daddy Mars) didn't have any lines (infact I don't think the baddies/ghosts spoke at all), and he felt like he was purely there so they would have someone to fight at the end, as opposed to him serving any real purpose.
John Carpenter uses a flash back story structure which helps the film from being too linear, but I didn't feel a real good sense of structure, no distinct acts. It's basicly boring ""character development"" for 50 mins, then lots of running around and shouting and then its over.
Now I know some people would say ""why are you being so analytical, it's an action film!"". But the problem is even if you look at it on a pure action film level it's not very good by todays standards, hell it's not even as good as Carpenters ""Big Trouble in Little China"" which came out in the mid-eighties!
But I must say I really liked the kills in this film. Flying limbs and heads are always a good laugh. And they really take you by surprise. The other reason I gave this film any stars at all was the very funny commentary by John Carpenter and Natasha Henstridge... It's as if Carpenter himself is aware that it's a [poor]film!
Personally I found the Anthrax soundtrack sort of embarassing, but I know alot of people like loud ""jigga jig jigga jig"" guitar soundtracks. I thought it was kinda dorky. But it was cool to see Carpenter working with Anthrax on the music (he composed it they performed it).

I've seen almost all of his movies and people have been hard on him recently.  A lot of his films are either you hate it or you love it.  He maintained his theme of the movie occuring in either a flashback and over a couple of days.  It makes the movie feel as though it just happened and you learn as much as the tribunal is in this case.  The editing was crisp and fast and kept the action flowing.  Ice Cube played a reluctant hero successfully and Natasha Hendstridge cooled down from an uptight police officer to make a great duo, the last scene of the movie just kicks [behind] ... when Cube runs in and tells Melanie that ""The tide is up"" ...

Bodies go missing at a mining town in the Mars desert, the missing people are blamed on the notorious criminal James ""Desolation"" Williams (Ice Cube).  When the team reaches the remote outpost, they find that ""Desolation"" had little to do with the disappearances but something else more horrifying is involved.
When I first saw this movie in theatre, I left the theatre kind of disappointed, I had thought it was a decent action movie but thought it was missing something.  When it was released on DVD I was skeptical whether or not I should buy the it.  After buying the DVD I am very happy with the movie, after watching it a second time I came to the realization that this movie is one of the most underrated John Carpenter movies ever created, alongside Big Trouble in Little China.  The movie does have its short falls though, such as overusing flashback scenes.  But, I have gotten over this.  One other note, people say the bad guy looks to much like Marilyn Manson, all I have to say to you is that you people have no imagination.  What other way would you have portrayed Mars savages?  They wear war paint, body piercings, which is exactly like our tribal ancestors here on Earth.
A couple of notes on the special effects and sound track.  Some of the special effects could have been a little bit more touched up to make them look more realistic but I love John Carpenter's retro feel to his movies.  And the soundtrack really is great, I am not a fan of Anthrax (who performed the music JC wrote), but the music really does set the feeling with a industrial feel.
Overall, this movie is definately worth seeing for any action, sci-fi, or John Carpenter fan.  In my oppinion, of the three Mars movies to come out in the last couple years, this is by far the best of them all.  If you pick up the DVD, you will be treated by some excellent extras including audio commentary with John Carpenter and Natasha Henstridge and a series of videos about the making of the movie, a very excellent DVD.

1320385,1,B00003CY6O,"The official title of this movie is John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars. The flamboyant director has done this in the past. I used to think this practice was entirely due to ego. In this instance, I hope it was just part of an effort to sell the picture. Surely, no sane person would want his or her name closely associated with a movie as bad as this one.
My philosophy is that nobody in the movie business bats a thousand. No star has ever made only hit movies. No director, even the most revered, has ever had every single project universally praised. The process is all part of the game of life. Carpenter is no exception. His Assault on Precinct 13 [1976] is a low budget cult classic. In 1978 he made Halloween, one of the most successful independent movies ever made. He went on to make some pretty cool movies, including Escape from New York, The Thing and Starman. Lately, he has been on a losing streak [Vampires, They Live], and Ghosts of Mars is definitely the low point.
The time is 2176, We have colonized Mars and have almost completed giving it an Earth-like atmosphere. [I doubt this is a feasible scientific possibility, but it is a way to make the movie without the actors having to run around in space helmets.] The society there is a matriarchal one, although no valid reason for this is ever given.
Lt. Melanie Ballard [Natasha Henstridge] is part of a team that has been dispatched to a remote mining town to bring back Desolation Williams [Ice Cube], who has been arrested for robbery and multiple homicide. When the team arrives, the town is strangely quiet. It turns out Williams may be a robber, but he's no killer. The culprits are the unseen entities which are [you guessed it!] the ghosts of Mars.
Because audiences have been exposed to so many of them, it is hard to make a sci-fi horror film these days without a huge budget, which is obviously something Mr. Carpenter did not have. To compensate, he uses mainly one set and throws every trick he can afford - fires, explosions, battles, and legions of murderous zombies. The result looks exactly like what it is -- actors running around leaping through the air, grunting and screaming profanities on an orange-lit stage set. As a result, it never casts the illusions necessary to keep an audience interested.
Compounding the problem is the use of props that are laughable. We are supposed to be 175 years into the future. We have colonized Mars, changed its atmosphere and set up huge mining operations. Yet the actors run around using big walkie-talkies that rarely work right, ride on a train that uses a human engineer, and peer into TV monitors that would look retro back here in 2001.
The cast contains some good actors. You might not know this if you hadn't seen them before because they have little to do except grimace, look concerned and say to each other ""Are you okay?"" every couple of minutes.",1015804800,3,2884,4.61284046692607

1320463,2,B00003CY6O,"I have been a huge fan of writer/director John Carpenter for years. From his humble beginnings with ""Assault on Precinct 13"" through ""Halloween,"" ""The Thing,"" ""Starman"" and up to his underrated but superb ""In the Mouth of Madness,"" his hip, darkly comedic, visually strong anti-hero tributes are unique to the multiple genres (sci-fi, horror, suspense) he weaves in and out of like some demented kid in a celluloid candy store.
After seeing ""Ghosts of Mars,"" however, I have come to the conclusion that perhaps Mr. Carpenter should consider hanging up his filmmaking guns. Derivative, clunkly and laughably bad, ""Ghosts of Mars"" combines elements of the already-mentioned ""Assault..,"" with ""Escape From New York,"" ""Dawn of the Dead,"" ""Vampires,"" and, of course, ""Rio Bravo."" But it lacks the style or wit of any of those mentioned films.
Quite simply, ""Ghosts of Mars"" rivals ""Big Trouble in Little China"" as being the worst Carpenter film ever made. The problems, almost too many to mention, include multiple flashbacks within flashbacks, completely destroying any momentum the film may have had; the casting of bland beefcake in pivotal roles (slowly becoming a Carpenter trademark); a story so predictable as to be excrutiatingly dull; and an infantile comic book mentality.
Mars miners discover tomb of planet's former inhabitants which seems to possess ghosts. These alien spirits possess the planet inhabitants turning them into bloodthirsty killers with a thing for body piercing. Possessed folks eventually surround a motley crew made up of criminals, policemen and Pam Grier. Motley crew has to fight for their lives (mainly with machine guns and dynamite) to make it back to train. Did I miss anything?
I used to think John Carpenter was a genius. After ""Ghosts of Mars,"" a thick-witted though admittedly stylish flick with several Carpenter trademarks, I have decided it is time to accept the fact that his most influential and groundbreaking work was left behind him long ago. Today we are left with the ghost of what Carpenter once was.",1012953600,,2049,5.193353474320242

Natasha Henstridge is spot-on as the space cop who must survive the attack of warrior space-zombies, while Ice Cube lends ample support as the crook she joins forces with in order to survive.  Pam Grier, who never seems to put in a bad performance, is wasted in an all-too small role.  As with most of Carpenter's films, the gore is a bit over the top and the film is well paced.

2) REALLY bad cinemaphotography - I can understand what John was trying to do with this film, but it never got there - too many bad fades from one scene to another made the film too disjointed to watch;
3) Bad special effects - WAY too much gore in some places, WAY not enough in others - although this film has to set a record for on-screen decapitations (I counted at least 12 and then gave up - note, this does not count the 40+ heads on stakes in one scene!!);
4) This plot doesn't cut it - way not enough time spent on the 'Ghosts', their reasoning, their civilization (except through the drug-induced trance suffered by the lead actress in one scene, which provides not enough info - for example, why Egyption hieroglyphs (yes, I paused the movie there!) on the seal of the 'crypt'?  Give us a break, and give us the tie-in, not some lame explaination from some one who is obviously NOT qualified to be a scientist.
All in all, one to add to a collection of John Carpenter's work; but NOT one to add just because the case or title look cool.  Save your money - I wish I had!

1320469,3,B00003CY6O,"This is a sci-fi/horror hybrid that looks like it may take the viewer along for an interesting ride, only to fall into a morass of absurdity, with bad acting amd worse dialogue. Written and directed by John Carpenter, it is not one of his better efforts.
The premise of the movie is relatively simple. It is the twenty second century and Mars is colonized by humans who live in some sort of matriarchal society, an issue which is never addressed nor explained, though reference is made to it. The Mars police are given a mission. They are to send a team of officers to a remote mining outpost, where there is a prison and bring back one of Mars most wanted, ""Desolation"" Williams (Ice Cube), to stand trial for murder.
The team, headed by two women (Pam Grier and Natasha Henstridge), arrives at the remote outpost, only to be greeted by apparent desolation (no pun intended). A closer look reveals indescribable carnage. They soon discover that many of those from the miming operation and from the prison have become possessed and turned into a frightening band of Marilyn Manson and Kiss doppelgangers who have pierced their bodies in indescribable fashion and are looking to finish off anyone who still looks human, all while roaring, howling, and screaming gibberish. Of course, the police joins forces with the surviving mining personnel and prisoners, including ""Desolation"" Williams, in an attempt to survive. Predictable carnage and action scenes follow.
Pam Grier is pathetic as the commanding officer, as her acting is so bad. Natasha Henstridge is better and has potential, though it is difficult to assess with the lousy dialogue she has been given. Moreover, why Joanne Cassidy accepted a part in this movie is beyond me, as it will definitely do nothing for her career. Ice Cube plays the part of a bad guy with enough panache that he leaves the viewer rooting for him. While most of the film is so-so, there are some truly chilling and interesting scenes.

His last movies weren't blockbusters and have been appreciated only by a few faithful fans. We are not so many to have enjoyed VAMPIRES, a western set in New Mexico with ghouls as main characters, or even ESCAPE FROM L.A., more a satirical opus about today intolerant society than a pure action movie. I'm sure that John Carpenter will have its place in Movie History along with other thinking action movies directors such as Howard Hawks or John Woo.
Carpenter's last movie, GHOSTS OF MARS, has been violently rejected when theatrically released. Strange when one thinks that Carpenter has not lost his technical skill nor his sense of  rythm. It's true that the themes found in the movie have already been treated in precedent Carpenter movies. So what! Everybody knows that a good author writes the same book his whole life long and the last Hitchcock movies are not very different from those he directed in the beginning of the thirties in England.
So we find in GHOSTS OF MARS the hidden enemy already seen in VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED or THE THING, an enemy who surrounders a little group of people trying to escape from a locked place, a situation found in almost all Carpenter movies. The only way to survive in a Carpenter film is to become an outlaw such as Snake Plissken in both ESCAPE movies because the system is often the enemy or, worse, doesn't help the Carpenterian hero in his tragic situation. These themes are, in my opinion, very interesting and justify their various reappearances in the director's filmography.
The DVD offers the always entertaining commentary of John Carpenter, this time with Natasha Hendridge, french subtitles, a video of the recording of GHOSTS OF MARS's musical score and a very interesting featurette about the shooting of the movie at night in the New Mexican desert.

GHOSTS OF MARS is basically VAMPIRES meets ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 relocated on Mars (and that planet must be cursed, since it just doesn't seem possible to make a decent film about it). Natasha Henstridge stars as lieutenant Melanie Ballard, and she's not a very convincing femme fatal, who leads a group of police officers that have been ordered to escort Desolation Williams, a dangerous interplanetary villain (Ice Cube), to a prison in the outpost city of Chryse (on the planet Mars). Sadly, a nearby mining team has been digging a bit too deep in the soil, and they've unearthed an age old Martian defense mechanism that has unleashed the ghosts of the original Martians, and they're now taking over and possessing the bodies of the miners (and everybody else who comes in their way). Phew... Add to this a ridiculous ending and you've got quite a storyline if ever there was one (who needs Federico Fellini?). Pam Grier as Helena Braddock deserves some credit (and is the only reason why I've given this film two stars instead of one), but she doesn't live for very long and after her death most things spiral downwards to movie hell.

There is a point in the movie where they actually get away from the threat of an onslaught of demonic ghosts and there are about 6 heros left to hundreds of ghost beings. So, do they proceed and then come back with reenforcements? No. They comeback with the same paultry few that got whipped to begin with. Ridiculous. If you liked the Phantom Menace you may like this, however both are highly NOT reccommended.",1010275200,,881,4.411042944785276
1320549,5,B00003CY6O,"This movie is great, loaded with alot of sci-fi action and great thrills. Ice Cube even does a damn good job as well as Nastasha Henstridge. John Carpenter may be an old man but he still knows how to direct and in my opinion this is his best film since the thing. It has splendid acting and excellent special effects. Also I think it has an excellent story, and Jason Stratham was in it, who is an awesome actor except I think he should've been involved in the movie more then he was. And what is the deal the music was outstanding and it fit the film perfectly,I mean im not a huge fan of Anthrax but they are an ok metal band. The movie has loads of great action, science fiction and even humor. Its just a great ol entertaining joyride and is the best sci-fi action flick of 2001 and one of the best ever, a true fun classic enjoy.",1009756800,,834,4.154320987654321
1320550,2,B00003CY6O,"I would have to say this is NOT John Carpenter's best work, and I've been an admirer of his films ever since Escape From N.Y. It has a good cast, but they have all been in much better movies (check out Species, Three Kings or Jackie Brown). I didn't feel like I was seeing anything new, just action cliches--lots of decapitations, stuntmen jumping in front of explosions, and gunplay galore, to a thrash-metal soundtrack.
Nothing makes a whole lot of sense or is explained very well. Some kind of dormant lifeform that looks like a cloud of red smoke (but at times is invisible apparently) has been awakened and has the power to possess people, who then become face-painted savages who look vaguely like the original slayer from the Buffy series. Where did they get the swords and spears and decapitating frisbees? If Mars has been terra-formed and has atmosphere, why is it dark all the time?
Anyway, I recommend it only if you're a hardcore J.C. fan, or if you just never met a shoot-em-up you didn't like. The quality of the DVD itself is excellent. Also, if you're a fan of the band Anthrax, you can see clips of them recording the soundtrack in the studio on the extra feature ""Scoring Ghosts of Mars"".",1009756800,2,1207,4.592592592592593

1320552,3,B00003CY6O,"The hard truth is that it's been tough to be a John Carpenter fan for the past decade or so.
Sure we remember that this the guy who gave us such classics as ""Assault on Precinct 13,""  ""Halloween,"" ""Escape From New York,"" and ""The Thing.""  Even his box office disappointments(""Big Trouble In Little China"", ""They Live"") were still better and more interesting than just about anything else to hit multiplex screens during his glory years of the mid-seventies through eighties.
But by the early 1990s, Carpenter hit a slump that saw him cranking out one schlock film after another.  Think of  ""In the Mouth of Madness"" or ""Vampires.""
For this reason, I was more than a little skeptical when ""Ghosts of Mars"" hit theaters last summer.  Even aside from J.C.'s recent track record, the film seemed a pastiche of other pop culture sources like ""Pitch Black,"" Ray Bradbury's ""The Martian Chronicles, and even Carpenter's own ""Precinct 13.""  But my curiosity got the better of me and I decided to take a chance.
My verdict?  Forget all the negative hype about this film.  It's the movie Carpenter fans have been waiting for.
Granted the film isn't the least bit scary.  It also doesn't ponder any weighty philosophical or political questions, like some of Carpenter's earlier films.  What it does offer however is a thoroughly entertaining sci-fi action pic that delivers plenty of ass-kickin' action with Carpenter's trademark cynicism thrown in to boot.
I won't rehash the plot, since odds are you've already read the summary above.  Instead, I'll focus on some other things I liked about this film, like the cast.  I'll believe Ice Cube is a great actor when I see him convincingly play a brain surgeon, a priest, or something other than another variation of the same scowling bad ass he played in his debut film, ""Boyz In the Hood"" years ago.  Still when a scowling badass is what you want, this rapper is your man and his persona(he basically plays himself in every movie) serves him well here.
As for Natasha Henstridge, no matter what she does she'll probably always be thought of as ""The babe from the `Species' movies.""  But the script smartly plays off her ""hottie"" status, by having her cop deftly fend off sexual advances from both her female commanding officer(Pam Grier) and her fellow officer(Jason Statham).  She's smart as a whip and tough as nails.
The supporting cast, is also full of interesting picks, Statham and Clea Duvall are two of my favorite character actors and 70s-film goddess Grier is always fun to watch though I wish she had more to do here.
Also worth noting is the action.  It's been years, since Carpenter did a balls-out action film, and it looks like this script really got his juices flowing.  The action scenes here just flat out rock.
Lastly, though the film's overall storyline is nothing special or inventive it's biggest asset is that it does succeed in drawing the viewer in.  After watching this movie, I found myself wanting to know more about these characters, about the true nature of the film's ""Martians,"" and about the matriarchal human society that came to rule the red planet.
Though the film's dissappointing performance at the box offices puts the prospects of a sequel in doubt, I have to say it would be more than a little interesting to revisit the characters and story elements introduced here.
I only saw the film in the theatre so I cannot comment on the DVD release.  However, the extras listed here pretty much guarantees that I will buy it at some point in the near future although I have only one quibble:  Why no Ice Cube commentary?
Bottom line though, this movie is really a must for JC fans and anyone who likes the sci-fi action genre. John Carpenter is back and back in fine form.",1009670400,,3744,4.757341576506955
1320621,1,B00003CY6O,"This is probably the dumbest, most idiotic attempt at a Sci-fi movie in the last 10 years. To start, the script is stupid: every major decision that could cause the characters trouble is usually made as a device to keep the plot (as little as there is!!!) going. How little? Well, just imagine a five minute plotline padded into 90 minutes. I regret this movie stole this time from my life!",1009324800,,390,4.507042253521127
1320622,1,B00003CY6O,"When I bought this I knew it was going to be bad. I was hoping for Night of the Living Dead II bad or The People Under the Stairs bad. You know, the cheesy scary flick that is still great because of the humor or just being so bad it's good. Well unfortunately this movie is not so bad it's good and it isn't humorous, although it is laughable. This movie gets my stinker of the year. Every year there is one movie in my collection that I'm ashamed to admit I've watched it and even more so to admit that I own it. Well for 2001 Ghosts of Mars is it.
The special effects are a joke. In fact there really aren't any. A couple of explosions and that's about it. The fight scenes are photographed poorly. You can see punches being thrown and passing by a face by more than a foot. The sound is absolutely horrible. I can't even recall a movie where the sound track was noticeable. It's generally just something that goes along with the movie. Only when it is extremely bad does it stick out in my mind. My wife even commented on it while we were watching the movie. The sound track resembles a 13 year old metal head that just learned a riff on his guitar and plays it over and over 24 hours a day. It is very bad. The sound quality is bad. Speech is so low it is almost inaudible in many parts but doesn't matter because they aren't saying anything worth listening to anyway. If the sound is turned up to the point speech is understandable as soon as somebody opens a door or fires a gun, the neighbors will be calling the cops on you. The sound was poorly engineered to say the least.
In a nut shell this movie just plain stinks. It isn't scary. It isn't suspenseful. It isn't humorous. The bottom line; it isn't entertaining - at all. Life is too short. Do yourself a favor and miss this incredibly weak excuse for a movie.",1009324800,2,1822,4.193732193732194
1320623,1,B00003CY6O,"The recent career path of cult-director John Carpenter has proven quite depressing. They Live (1988) was the last time he made anything resembling a satisying film. Ghosts Of Mars is an utter abomination. It's weak box-office performance may signal that the end is near for the man once responsible for rousing genre classics as Halloween, Assault On Precinct 13 and Escape From New York. Carpenter wastes a perfectly functional B-list cast: Jason Statham, Clea Duvall, Pam Grier, Joanna Cassidy, Ice Cube and the gorgeous Natasha Henstridge. They're all given some of the worst dialogue i've heard in quite a while. What should have been a simple and familiar B-movie plot is rendered incoherent by a baffling flashback within a flashback plot device. Ghosts Of Mars is also the worst looking science-fiction films in quite some time. The production design and visual effects are an embarrassment.
The chance that Henstridge may remove her shirt is the only reason to indulge in this shambles.",1009065600,2,994,5.1419753086419755

The actors do a superb job at their characters; the movie takes place in the future and in the planet of mars. this movie is  about the human race opening by accident some cave that lets out the spirits of the planet(mars) that later possess the humans who are creating a civilization-and chaos erupts. I am not going to give out too many details, but Ice Cube(a great actor in this motion picture), Natash Henstridge(beautiful lady), and Pamela Grier for me are the right actors who did this film.

  There was too much gore for me to like it.  The plot and the actors had quite a bit of potential to make this an awesome movie.  However, there were so many inconsistencies in the plot that it made it less and less believable.  (E.g. Why didn't any of them explore how Ballard fought the ""germs."")
  Ballard (N.H.) and her fellow officers go to this town to transfer a convict, Desolation Williams (Ice Cube).  They soon realize that something is wrong in the town - you have decapitated heads on poles, people hanging by their feet, etc.  And the action starts.  The perpetrators are miners who have been infected by these... what should I call them... evil germs who have the planet's memories somehow engineered in them.

Cinematography that reminds me of the old 'Buck Rogers in the 25th Century' tv series.  what the HELL were the people working on this film thinking??  Awful, just bloody awful.

And I didn't expect to. I gave it a pass when it first came our because my friends who had seen it said it was awful.
The critics were saying it was awful.
Everybody seemed to find fault with it (and, to be honest, there is fault to be found).
Some rag on the Special Effects, some on John Carpenter's soundtrack, some complain there is too much hand to hand fighting.
None of this bothered me when I finally watched it.
I mean, the Special Effects weren't that bad, Anthrax, Buckethead, and John Carpenter gave us a driving soundtrack, and the hand to hand combat is to be expected when one is fighting a reincarnated warrior species who seem to be really into hunting heads as prizes of war.
It has some of the flavor of Escape From New York, a dash of the humor of Big Trouble in Little China, and more than a hint of inspiration from the pulp magazines of yore like Weird Tales, and Jungle Adventures and so forth. What I am saying is that the spirits of Talbot Mundy, Rider Haggard, Edgar Rice Burroughs, and Harold Lamb are alive and well in this story.
It was a delight to watch.
Ice  Cube, Natasha Henstridge, and Jason Statham make a pretty decent team along with Clea Duvall and  Liam Waite.
Pam Grier isn't on screen a lot but she makes her presence felt when she is.
And as for Joanna Cassidy...well, what can one say about an actress who has played everything from a Replicant in Blade Runner !1982) to T'Pol's mom on Star Trek Enterprise?
