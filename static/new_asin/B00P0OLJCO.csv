6780808,4,B00P0OLJCO,"this is a very enjoyable movie. The plot is interesting and the lead characters have great chemistry. The songs were also very enjoyable, especially the well done title song. If I had one complaint about the movie, it is the ending. I found it a little unrealistic and would have rather seen things (Spoiler, Spoiler, Spoiler, Spoiler next) progress slowly then a happy ending. If you see the movie you will know what I am talking about.",1428537600,2,437,4.688311688311688

Even though Parineeti  Chopra's character wasn't all that likeable through 1/2 of the movie & not enough time  was taken in developing the romantic relationship between the 2 main characters, I thought this was a good little movie. I'm glad I own it & will watch it again.",1418774400,,285,4.68

8686025,4,B00P0OLJCO,"And what better time to celebrate Christmas than with a fun Bollywood movie? 2014's Daawat-e-Ishq (translation: Feast of Love) showcases irrepressible rising star Parineeti Chopra who has yet to fail to light up the screen even in her crappier films. Daawat-e-Ishq was deemed a box office dud, and I don't get that. I thought it a droll romantic comedy.

In the city of Hyderabad, Gulrez Qadir (Parineeti Chopra) speaks her mind and suffers no fools gladly. Gulrez - or ""Gullu"" - dreams of studying fashion design in New York but for now settles for toiling as a shoe store salesgirl. After a succession of rejections greets her father's efforts to set her up with an arranged marriage - and note that her father can't offer much in the way of dowry - Gullu gives it up as a lost cause and makes up her mind to somehow get herself and her father to New York. Ah, but how to raise enough money to get there?

I should mention that this is also a social comedy. A title card launches the film and informs viewers that the issue of dowry has for years triggered the shame and abuse and deaths of many Indian women. The payment of dowry is prohibited as per Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code. Doesn't mean it still doesn't go on these days. And, yes, I did say ""social comedy."" Because the movie chooses to tread lightly over this subject matter.

So how to raise enough money to get to New York? Gullu, thinking outside the box, goes the larcenous route. She explains it to her reluctant father (Anupam Kher) - how she aims to post a fake profile on a matrimonial website to lure in a greedy suitor, orchestrate a fake wedding ceremony, and then threaten to file a dowry harassment case under Section 498A against the groom and his fam, and then sit back for the inevitable out-of-court cash settlement. This is as good a time as any to laud Anupam Kher who is solid like bedrock as Gullu's father, Abdul Qadir, initially aghast at Gullu's proposal but who then gets roped in. Kher provides plenty of grins as the simple, blue-collar dad trying his durndest to pull off his masquerade of the haughty millionaire.

They cast their net in Lucknow and reel in Tariq ""Taru"" Haider (Aditya Roy Kapoor), brash proprietor of that swell eatery, Haidari Kabab. Kapoor, generating the swagger of Akshay Kumar and the likability of a mischievous puppy, matches Parineeti Chopra in playfulness and in natural charisma. And it's their energy and their interactions that propel the narrative. I hadn't seen a Bollywood picture in a long minute. Daawat-e-Ishq reminds me all over again what I've been missing - the zest for life, the unapologetic heart-on-the-sleeve approach, the festive colors of set and costume, the raucous musical numbers. And, of course, it wouldn't be Bollywood if there weren't a cheesy fight scene somewhere along the way. And since one of the leads is playing a chef, we're also treated to a visual feast of mouth-watering Indian dishes - from shahi tukda to biryani and feerni and curry - ah, man, excuse me as I wipe away the drool. Anyway, in the parlance of the times from an exotic, faraway land, and because when in Rome blahbetty blah, I say to you, ""Khuda Hafiz.""",1451001600,,3184,4.650088809946714
