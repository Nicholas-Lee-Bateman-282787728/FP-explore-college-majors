8423980,1,B004CYF7K8,The music was cut out. That was the only reason I bought this. Total waist of money. But it's my fault be cause I didn't read the reviews. My bad. See the music here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywa2H6JNhaQ,1413676800,2,210,5.0285714285714285
8423981,2,B004CYF7K8,Got to see the interviews but really bought it for the musical number and it wasn't on here!! Very Disappointed...,1378944000,3,114,4.75
8423982,2,B004CYF7K8,"Yeah, I bought this for Alice Cooper.  While the interview is good and Alice is cute as ever, they say stay tuned for Alice to come back and perform.  You come back to knucklehead Jay Leno.  No Alice performance.  I would guess that Carson's company is too damn cheap to pay for performances, rights to songs....????  Anyway, if you want the Lace and Whiskey song done with the dancing, shooting chickens...only an Alice fan would understand...then it's on Youtube.",1343433600,3,465,4.8354430379746836
8423983,1,B004CYF7K8,"This cd is definitely not worth the money. It is supposed to be the whole episode. However, the music is cut out. That is a huge issue when I bought it because Alice Cooper is one of the only 2 guests on the show. Total waste of money.",1293667200,8,235,3.9166666666666665
