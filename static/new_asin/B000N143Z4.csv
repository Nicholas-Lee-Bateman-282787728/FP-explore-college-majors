8173859,4,B000N143Z4,"Federico Luppi is a great actor.  This movie is set in a town on the Amazon and deals with a daughter who comes to visit her father who now has an attractive mistress.  The daughter does not like the mistress, which helps to define the emotional dynamics of the movie.  Watching it, it is hard to like the daughter or even to understand her motivation.  Were it not for the superb acting by Luppi and superb cinematography, this would be just a soap opera.  The opening scene which shows an aircraft carrying the daughter enroute to meet her father is becutifully shot and worth watching more than once.",1365638400,,603,4.546296296296297
