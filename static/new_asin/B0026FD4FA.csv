I just have problem with the title. In this film, I could not find one single correlation between the blues and sevdah itself. Sure, there is the link for us, who can feel both of the musical forms. For someone, who is outsider, there is the missing link, and I think it's about time for the author to make another part (part II) to go and to find that missing link in this amazing story about incredible music form and culture and the blues itself. I am personally involved in my mind to analyze this link and relation between sevdah and the blues. It might come as surprise - but, lot of Americans do not know what THE BLUES, actually, means!

I am, also, surprised that nobody came here earlier, and write some kind of statement, opinion... Am I the only one who, actually, seen this film?

Were are the viewers?

PS. I am trying to initiate others to respond their opinions.",1268092800,2,1016,4.422459893048129
