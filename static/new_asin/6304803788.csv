928255,4,6304803788,"I thought this was a really interesting  movie.  Right from the beginning I thought, Uh oh, don't try to help someone seriously disturbed through friendship.  It became more complicated than that.  The acting was great, and I am a Schygulla fan.  I thought this showed her at her best.  Margaretha von Trotta is such a sensitive director, especially about women's issues.  The ending left me gasping.  I highly recommend it.",1364601600,9,424,4.957142857142857
