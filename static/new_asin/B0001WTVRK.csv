8017203,3,B0001WTVRK,"Hours and hours of warbird footage...  so far I've watched three sides of the disks.  It's been footage of the same Confederate Air Force warbirds doing the same thing at different airshows.

I haven't had television in years.  When I read the description of the DVDs, I figured it was a complete television series of some sort; something from The History Channel maybe.  It's not.  :-(

On the other hand, the footage is very nice as are the aircraft.  It's a nicely done background of the C.A.F. and their airshow efforts.",1136937600,2,524,4.681318681318682
