7958469,1,B0000633TD,"ITs horrible. Its a high school film done by the kids who got a D in their film making class. Ok story, but horrible shooting, except the very first scene, horrible sound, bad music, it is just GARBAGE start to finish. Bad lighting, bad acting,  bad dialog, but a good villian who's a bisexual girl.",1050537600,,299,4.4363636363636365
7958470,2,B0000633TD,"The Plot: A young man(James) is forced to move to a poorer suburb (though it look pretty upscale for a ghetto to me) because of a separation of his parents.  In his attempt to adjust to his new community he meets Celeste who he of course falls for.  In short order, Celeste is raped and murdered as a gang initiation.  James then uses a gun he found earlier to hunt down everyone related to Celeste's rape and murder.  The ending seemed lacking.  As if they simply ran out of money and rewrote the ending to fit the budget they had.
It could be a good movie but the Audio is done so poorly it sounds like a cheesy porn at several points.  At many points the Audio is so bad that the dialogue is incomprehensible.  If you can get past that(to do so I suggest removing your Subwoofer from the sound system temporarily as it has heavy bass tracks) though the movie is mildly compelling.
It's obvious the movie was done on a minimal budget both in the sound and in the sets.  Each time you start to get involved in the plot the sets remind you that this could have been a high school production.  Amazingly though this film was the winner at a New York Independent Film and International Video festival.",1046736000,2,1199,4.3408071748878925
