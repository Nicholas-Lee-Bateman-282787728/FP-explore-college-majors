7479919,5,B016U8A690,"My nine year old swimmer daughter saw this and loved it.  It made a huge impression, and a lasting one.  We will be cheering for Missy in the Olymopics now, and my daughter understands all great swimmers start as she has.",1450828800,,221,4.365853658536586

7479921,5,B016U8A690,"If you have a young athlete in your family, male or female, swimmer or not-this is such an inspirational story about struggling through workouts, watching others excel when you plateau, true friendship, good sportsmanship, the relationship between coach and athlete. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself and your family a favor. Get it now. You won't be disappointed.",1446508800,2,370,5.183333333333334
7479922,5,B016U8A690,"I loved this movie. It wasn't just about the success of Missy Franklin. She is a gorgeous, kind, determined young athlete. However, the movie was a much deeper look at the struggle of an Olympic athlete because Kara was fearlessly open with her emotions. I was moved to tears and on my feet applauding. An inspirational film for everyone.",1446422400,,338,4.745762711864407
7479923,5,B016U8A690,If you have a swimmer in the family or are just a swim fan this is a MUST SEE.  Our swim team hosted a screening of this film in a theater last spring and it was a huge hit with all age groups.,1445904000,,193,3.488372093023256
7479924,5,B016U8A690,"A great REAL LIFE story behind the commitment it takes from athletes, families, friends and coaches to help someone realize their goal of making the US Olympic team. Even if you are not a swimmer, this story is inspiring and uplifting.  I loved the Missy component but, I was equally compelled by Kara Lynn's story line: an older athlete attempting to make her 3rd team, strapped for money, unsure of the best training atmosphere, with less out right support...I found it really interesting to see how she coped. Lastly, it is a story about YOUNG WOMEN battling for their success!  There are equal numbers of men and women out there challenging themselves but we don't often hear the stories of the women.  This is a must see....must own!",1445817600,3,738,4.75
7479925,5,B016U8A690,Preordered this movie for my competitive swimmer daughter. She loved it! I loved it! All her teammates loved it! Such a shame the movie wasn't more widely shown in theaters.,1445731200,,173,4.8
7479926,5,B016U8A690,My 10 year old competitive swimmer LOVED this movie. One of her 2 or 3 favorite movies.,1445731200,,87,4.176470588235294
7479927,5,B016U8A690,"Finally a positive movie about women in sports! This movie gave me tears and shared the excitement of the Olympics. I can't think of another film who follows a superstar on the way up and captures a the behind the scenes look at family, friends, teammates and coaches. If you want to see what it takes to be the best this film is a must see.",1445299200,4,341,4.181818181818182
7479928,5,B016U8A690,"This is a truly refreshing film.  So many stories being told these days seem to focus on the tragic side of life and while this film certainly has captured some very personal sacrifices of some of the people involved in the film, overall it tells the story of strength and perseverance.  This film is inspiring and great for all ages.  The filmmakers did a fantastic job of allowing us to witness in an authentic way what hard work, sacrifice, positive outlook and a loving and supportive family can accomplish.  Watching this film will have you wanting to play bigger in your own life.",1457654400,,586,4.660194174757281

8737281,5,B016U8A690,I watched with several non-swimmer good friends.  They loved it.  Not just for swimmers and FOS (friends of swimmers).  A great inspirational tale.,1462320000,,147,5.304347826086956
8737282,5,B016U8A690,"Every sports parent, coach, and swim family should view Touch the Wall. It has many life lessons and shows the joy of success and agony of defeat. The loving guidance and encouragement of Missy's parents and coach are truly unrivaled in youth sport today. They never put pressure on her, they met her where she was each step of the way. The film-makers did an amazing job capturing truly special moments and milestones as Missy and Kara Lynn prepared for Olympic Trials. I laughed, cried, and smiled. Can't wait to watch it again and share it one day with my kids whether or not they swim (well one better ;)!!

You will love it! Go Team USA!",1458864000,,642,4.487179487179487

I also loved seeing the relationship between both Missy and Kara and Missy and her family.  It's great to see someone do so well, and still be so down-to-earth.  I'm not a swimmer, but this is just a great film for anyone because it's such a personal story of triumph.",1458777600,,400,4.591549295774648
