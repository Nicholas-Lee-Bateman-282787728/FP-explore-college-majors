2988929,2,B000WPAG1Q,"From an older person's perspective (past age 35), this concert is all flash and mumbles, which you may thoroughly like (the Vegas-Madonna glitz); but if you're wanting only to hear Aguilera's beautiful voice, to see her before she married and seemed a bit truer to herself in both message and looks, then opt for the ""Stripped"" concert a few years earlier.  It is there that you'll find more of her singing only with a piano or even solo, directing her message of domestic violence abuse with compassion.  In this concert, her voice and singing are glossed over, a brief interlude drowned out by the music and what seems to be poor sound engineering.  Where's that beautiful voice, something that emerges in ""The Hurt,"" her one and only venture into a slow song that shows her chops...but then it's right back into the fast paced, bright lights of the show.  Was there any feeling in there?  You won't find that here, her dancing a bit more forced, her performers still stunning and now outdancing her (maybe it's the full sheep's head of blond hair that she carries).  But again, if you want just a Broadway-Vegas performance and don't really care about what she sings or even hearing her sing, then this is the concert for you...all fireworks and flash, but little else.",1421625600,,1272,4.733031674208145

2988931,2,B000WPAG1Q,"I attended the live concert and it was amazing; however this dvd does it no justice.  Christina is a wonderful performer who knows how to entertain a crowd.  Conversely, the dvd quality is poor and hard to watch. The camera is unable to focus clearly on all of the movements so the images looks somewhat blurry.",1417824000,,311,4.535714285714286

2988941,5,B000WPAG1Q,"Everybody has certain tastes in music. I am a professional musician (drummer), and drum teacher. Christina, simply said, has a god given talent through a set of vocal pipes that can keep me at the edge of my seat. Her voice is amazing, her audience appeal is stupendous no matter if told to do so by her producer, or her honest appeal of thanks to those of us that support her talent.

I love every song, every move, every note in her voice.....this concert is wonderful, and full of her older stuff which (for me), is better than some of her newer stuff.  If you have surround sound and a nice couch, you can't go wrong.  As a professional musician, it doesn't get much better!",1370217600,,678,4.408

2988947,4,B000WPAG1Q,Better than what I thought! I love Christina but my fave is the Xtina Stripped staged. I'm a huge fan of old Hollywood and thought this would be super campy. Was surprised at how all around entertaining it was. LOVE the Trouble video and the Nasty naughty boy performance with the Aussie hottie from the crowd. Highly recommend it.,1361232000,,331,4.627118644067797
2988948,5,B000WPAG1Q,"One of her best concerts and definitely one that inspired the future generations, including her peers.

2988950,5,B000WPAG1Q,"Ms. Aguilera has been included in Rolling Stone Magazine's List of 100 Greatest Voices of all time. She masterfully proves her worth to be in that list with this concert. She is one of the few remaining popular mainstream artists to possess such a powerful set of raw natural pipes. This DVD is edited well and the production is top notch. She is able to showcase her vocal talent while being able to infuse dancing, extravagant clothing and set design.",1353888000,,453,4.675

she has quite matured in appearance but looks sexier.  one reviewer said that she has a ""bump"" during
this concert but it doesn't seem noticeable when i watched the concert.  christina as always gives
a hundred percent performance level rating.",1341705600,,350,4.816666666666666
2988953,5,B000WPAG1Q,"Last night I watched/listened to a Christina Aguilera concert, ""Back to Basics: Live and Down Under."" I picked up the DVD from the bargain-rack at a local Ross Store. It was a rather good DVD concert. Most concert DVDs seem to have either poor sound or poor photography, or both. This DVD was quite well done. Both the visuals and the sound were quite good and made for enjoyable watching and listening.

I'd heard of Christina Aguilera, but this was the first time I've ever seen her or listened to her music. I was favorably impressed. She's a bit hard to peg, but I'd say she's part Soul, part Madonna and with a bit or Michael Jackson tossed in. The concert was impressive. Christina had about a 15-piece backing band, which reminded me somewhat of a small ""Big Band"" with a couple guitars. In addition, there were about 10 singers/dancers. Sorry if my numbers are off as it's hard to count with so many people on stage. Christina was usually front and center with mic and an active member of the dance troupe. I'd say the whole performance, together with the band, was rather active and athletic and Christina's vocals were excellent. The large Australian crowd, of course, loved the presentation and Christina and her troupe loved the responsive crowd. It was just a good concert and you'd enjoy being there.

The Christina Aguilera disc is hard for me to rate. Although I liked the music and performance, it was not my type of most-enjoyable music so I'd probably give it four stars on that basis alone. However, this is one of the better concert DVDs I own, and I think that merits bumping the whole production up to five stars.

I bought from a ""Music Village"" or something along
if you are just planning om buying it but wonder if its good let me tell you
Christina Delivers the whole circus experience and feel is reflected throughout the whole show!
Not to mention that VOICE",1331942400,,334,4.403225806451613
2988956,5,B000WPAG1Q,"This is one of the best DVD concert performances I have seen.  Awesome production quality and Christina Aguilera delivers and outstanding performance surrounded by great dancers and an amazing band.
A must have for Christina fans and anyone who appreciates great concert DVDs.",1324857600,,276,5.4186046511627906
2988957,5,B000WPAG1Q,"I haven't bought a concert on dvd in a long time, but I was curious to see what Christina Aguilera would bring to the table. I had always wanted to go see her in concert, but missed the opportunity. Throughout every song, Aguilera's vocals were on point. Her stage settings were intricate and fun. Also, her dancers bought a lot of energy to her overall performance. This dvd is a great buy.",1324425600,,391,4.444444444444445
2988958,5,B000WPAG1Q,"Christina was hot and it is so high energy. I loved the whole thing, what a great concert. I haven't even gotten to to the behind the scenese because I can't stop watching the concert. (great for watching it while on a treadmill)",1297728000,,229,4.348837209302325
2988959,4,B000WPAG1Q,"There is no doubt this girl can sing and anyone who continues to compare her to Britney Spears is tone deaf. The energy level is so high it made me tense. I wish Christina would do more ballads and break up her performances with them to allow listeners over 30 years of age to catch their breath.  It would also be nice if Christina could connect more to her audience instead of just once during ""Beautiful"".  But I suppose these things will develop as she matures and with vocal ability like this she'll be around for a long time.",1290816000,,531,4.353535353535354
2988960,5,B000WPAG1Q,"I went to see her in Los Angeles in 2007 and this was hands down, the best concert I've ever been to. Her voice was in top-notch condition and the show was fun and reminded me of one of the old 1940's MGM hollywood musicals. Back to Basics is one of my all-time favorite albums and the show exceeded my expectations!",1280620800,,316,4.19672131147541
2988961,5,B000WPAG1Q,The sole purpose of me buying this DVD was because I actually went to this tour show 2 years ago...in BMORE...and it was AWESOME!!!!!Christina has an amazing voice...and I will tell anyone to purchase this DVD but if you ever get a chance to see her live...GO....Hearing her live is amazing...she has such a powerful voice and that is why besides Beyonce she is in my top 5 singers of all times right now,1240963200,,404,4.472972972972973
2988962,3,B000WPAG1Q,"Christina's Back to Basics tour is quite a splendour to watch, it is clear that she has matured in many ways than one. What I love about this young talented woman is that she took the reigns of her career into her own control, others like Britney, although very successful, had their careers controlled from the word go (only now is she having more creative freedom) no wonder she had a break down. Christina however had it with doing what others expected her to do and only after her first album broke away with ""Stripped"" it shocked us a little but her talent shone through and she never turned back. This extended to her project ""Back to Basics"" her most mature work. This DVD is spectacular amazing costumes, incredible (and I mean amazing choreography and dancers) and the cherry on the cake, Christina's mind-blowing vocals, man can she let it rip. A Jamie King production, so you know its good, I mean look at Jamie's work with Madonna's ""Reinvention, Confessions and Sticky and Sweet tours as well as Ricky Martins ""Black and White tour"" masterpieces to say the least. I absolutely enjoyed the ""Welcome to the Circus"" section, a visual masterpiece.

The only reason why I did not give this DVD 5 stars is that I felt too many of her classic hits were redone (different versions) e.g Come on over, What a girl wants, the only track that was original was the closing track ""Fighter"", I love to hear my favourite songs the way they are, although stars like Madonna have done a good job of reinventing past songs, e.g Erotica (Confessions Tour). Apart from that Christina rocks again, oh and did I mention that this woman can sing?",1238025600,,1635,4.637931034482759
2988963,5,B000WPAG1Q,"This is a fun concert to watch.

2988965,5,B000WPAG1Q,"Christina Aguilera just keeps gettin better in EVERYTHING she does, i recommend this for ANY christina fan, or anyone who can apprieciate the BEST VOICE IN THE WORLD
she sounds amazing and she puts on an outstanding performance!!!!",1228694400,,231,5.105263157894737
2988966,5,B000WPAG1Q,"I have to give this dvd a five star for the outstanding timing and pace, it was truly a spectacular show. The songs, most of which I had never heard, other than ""Fighter"", are certainly themed, so it's unlike your typical rock concert. I can't imagine how anyone could watch this tho and not be throughly entertained and impressed. Even if you weren't the hugest Christina fan ever; tho, I must say, my esteem for her certainly increased. She's a total professional, an excellent dancer, and everyone knows her voice rivals Elvis's and wins.

If you like Christina, you will love this. If you only sort of like her and like to collect concerts, you will be throughly impressed. It truly has a great progression of song styles, and everything that comes wow's you more. Really. Outstanding concert. Unusual quality and entertainment and engery and professionalism from a pop star, in a world where amazing shows are the norm. This really is the creme de la creme of concerts and production and talent. It's big, big, big, in every way - the least of which is not heart and soul.",1228608000,,1077,4.668421052631579
2988967,5,B000WPAG1Q,"She did a fantastic job in the Australian tour! There are parts in the DVD where she's in Adelaide, they used footage from the 2 Adelaide shows.  She mostly says ADELAIDE! So yay!  Amazing tour, glad i saw it!",1226361600,,209,4.333333333333333
2988968,5,B000WPAG1Q,"I think this is one of the best performances ever made by Christina Aguilera. Congratulations!! I'll never forget this tour, I went from Barcelona to London anly to see her!",1215388800,,173,4.8
2988969,5,B000WPAG1Q,All I can say is Christina's delivered a strong performance which hard for other singers out there to compete. I really enjoy watching this dvd and I dare to say that this is the best concert that I ever seen.  This dvd is a must for Christina's fan to own.,1209340800,,257,4.14
2988970,2,B000WPAG1Q,"I enjoyed the concert and Christina's performance, but I though much of the concert was very poorly filmed and the spazmatic editing was very hard to take.  It made enjoying the concert very difficult.

The video framing was very poor with terrible zooming that made no sense.  The half-second camera angle changes compounded the issue as did the very poor editing.",1209168000,,365,4.950819672131147
2988971,5,B000WPAG1Q,"Christina brings down the house with this concert.  The music is phenomenal.  She is clever and does a few of her old songs with a new spin to make them fit in with the theme of the show.  The set design was great, costume changes were clever, and the coreography was excellent.  This was noting but pure entertainment.  Christina gave it her all and didn't let up once.  I can't wait to see what she does next.",1207958400,,411,4.2727272727272725

TE AMO CHRISTINA AGUILERA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1207872000,,310,4.980769230769231
2988973,5,B000WPAG1Q,"My girl Xtina bought it home with this DVD. It's an awesome concert - much different from her Stripped tour and better in my opinion. There are different set changes which range from a Jook Joint to a Circus. Also love the costumes on Xtina. Here's the setlist
1. Intro (Back To Basics) - the same intro from the BTB album
2. Ain't No Other Man - awesome performance
3. Back In The Day
4. Understand - my favorite song from the album and the vocals are excellent.
5. Come On Over (Jazz Version) - I like the performance. However, I prefer the radio version of COO than this one.
6. Slow Down Baby
7. Still Dirrty/Can't Hold Us Down - Xtina's still got the nasty in her. Very sexy performance
8. Interlude - I Got Trouble - a very raunchy video of Xtina at her nastiest. It seems like you're watching a porno.
9. Makes Me Wanna Pray - how ironic is that? after the raunchy video of Trouble she bursts onto singing MMWP. Great performance though
10. What A Girl Wants (Reggae Version) - Liked it! At first, I was wondering why she would sing a reggae version of this song, but after hearing it, I enjoyed it.
11. Oh Mother - Wow. A very disturbing video in the background as Xtina sings her heart out.
12. Enter The Circus/Welcome - this is where the stage becomes the set of a circus. Really cool performance by Xtina and her dancers.
13. Dirrty - one of my favorite performances from the show. She's singing on a carousel horse while her female dancers are swinging from poles attached to the stage. A man's fantasy :)
14. Candyman - a hot performance
15. Nasty Naughty Boy - she pulls a guy out of the audience, straps him up, and sings her song with her dancers. Very hot
16. Hurt - another one of my favorite songs from her album. the set changes into a night set which is very interesting.
17. Lady Marmalade - she sings the full version!! Great and hot!
18. Interlude - Thank You - a video of her song Thank You including her fans from around the world.
19. Beautiful - Great of course.
20. Fighter - the final peformance.
An awesome tour. If anyone likes the Stripped Tour, they will definitely love this tour. She went Back To Basics to where it all began. Go Xtina.",1202515200,,2173,4.302439024390244
2988974,5,B000WPAG1Q,"Since I was unable to see the top female tour of 2007 live, as soon as I heard ""Back to Basics:Live and Down Under"" was going on DVD to Best Buy, I had to go get it asap. And I must say, I am more jealous than ever of those who saw it in person. Because even Christina Aguilera in my living room was an unbelievable experience!

While Christina has always been an amazing singer, she has not gone all out performance wise. This time, however, she stepped it up, and included theatrical dancing, extensive props, video clips, and crowd participation along with her ""voice of this generation"".

Christina truly is a one-woman show, and considering that she was in her first trimester of pregnancy during this concert is just mind-boggling!

Many of the songs on 2006's Back to Basics were clearly meant to be performed live. Skippable tracks on the album such as ""Welcome"" and ""Nasty, Naughty Boy"" are highlights of the show, especially with a ""volunteer"" for the latter song.

Other highlights are the beautiful ""Hurt"", solo rendition of ""Lady Marmalade"", fun and spunky ""Candyman"", intro ""Ain't No Other Man"", and powerful encores ""Beautiful"" and ""Fighter"".

I highly recommend this dvd, for anyone who enjoys a great show.",1202342400,,1223,4.804761904761905
2988975,5,B000WPAG1Q,"For anyone who is a christina fan and who has been anticipating this Dvd concert it is awsome just like the live concert, I was lucky enough to see her in Houston, Tx and that was her first performance of this tour. Oh yeah a good thing to know when trying to get this dvd is that they only sell this at Best Buy thats why amazon says they don't have it in stock.",1202256000,,363,3.918918918918919
2988976,5,B000WPAG1Q,"Christina is on top of her game. The stage show is elaborate, the band is comprised of top musicians, and her voice is in fine form. VERY impressive concert and it shows that she just keeps on getting better and better. I like the Back to Basics theme, gives her more of an outlet to really show off her great vocal range, much more so than her last album, Stripped. Anyways, this dvd is definitely enjoyable and a must have for Christina fans.",1201564800,,444,4.36144578313253
2988977,5,B000WPAG1Q,"I attended her performance at the Excel Energy Center in Minneapolis, MN back in March 2007 and this was a night to never be forgotten.  Her incredible synchronization with her musicians, stunning vocal quality, dancing, and overall performance were truly one-of-a-kind.  I've seen Josh Groban live, PCD, Maroon 5, and many other incredible artists perform live and none compare to Christina Aguilera.  She's in this business for the long hall with the powerful vocals to keep her going.  Congratulations Christina and keep up the incredible work.
I can't wait for the DVD!",1197849600,,573,5.195652173913044
2988978,5,B000WPAG1Q,"I saw this show in Spring of 2007 in the States, and it was amazing.  Her voice sounded so great.  She is a very gifted vocalist who puts on a great, high energy show.  The performance was tied for my favorite concert ever, and I've seen many 'singers' who are supposed to be great.  Christina blows them all away...",1197676800,,316,4.305084745762712
2988979,1,B000WPAG1Q,"After the disappointment musically that was ""Back 2 Basics"" the album. I was interested in seeing how Christina AT LEAST improved as a performer. The verdict is in...this concert is just as boring to watch as her last dvd ""Stripped"". Although the stage settings are very elaborate & theatrical (some things I've seen on old Madonna tours)....Christina Aguilera lacks the natural charisma of an exciting performer.

Even for being touted the ""voice of this generation""....her vocals sound subpar for that status. The vocals sound weak & strained...the stress is apparent in Christina's face as she shouts the notes. There were some moments of LIPSYNCHING which came as a shock to me! Normally, singers will lipsynch if its a more dance-oriented number....but she lipsynchs to mask the harder notes. Mariah, Whitney, and Celine never had to do that in their prime...it's sad how the standards have lowered.

I'll have to recommend Justin's ""FutureSex/LoveSound"" Live in MSG or Beyonce ""The Beyonce Experience"" Live at Staples Centers instead of this. These are the best male & female performers out of the young crop....definitely great gift DVDs for this holiday season!",1196812800,,1169,5.245989304812834
2988980,1,B000WPAG1Q,"I did not entertained when I bought this DVD. AT ALL.

It sucks, and absolutely boring. Her songs all very emo! and makes me sleepy. All she does is screaming, yelling, screeching, straining her fcukin' voice. ALL THE TIME. So annoying. How is that ""VOICE of the generation"". She can't even control and runs her own voice. Her vocal runs technique is horrible and Xtina falsetto control are laughable compared with Beyonce. LMAO. And tell Xtina don't ever try to move or dancing cause she look retarded doing it. Thanks.

Go buy the new Beyonce Experience and Justin's concert DVD instead. They both the best entertainers right now and will entertain you in every possible way. If you buy this, don't get mad at me, cause I've warn you, it will disappoint you. Unless you a REALLY obsessed fans of Xtina who don't care if she sucks at live or anything, then buy this. This is not a real show. Even Britney Onyx Hotel DVD show much better than this.",1196294400,,948,4.570588235294117

She did it though and this time there was whips! First off the show opened with two of the hottest act in R&B, Pussycat Dolls and Dainty Kaine! who got the crowed pumped then Christina opened the show with her first single AINT NO OTHER MAN!Through out the two hour concert you see great special effects a few pyros and like Christina fashion, a bunch of confetti. Speaking of fashion, her costumes designed by DSquared and Roberto Cavoli were stunning! She did a little circus act mid way through which in my opinion was very original and entertaining! Bottom line is Christina proves over and over she is an amazing singer/song writer and her performances on stage just comes to show the world ""she aint going no where, no shes' here to stay""!BUY IT!!!!",1195603200,,911,4.560975609756097

She was fantastic. Didn't lypsing anything(unlike some other popstars that shall remain nameless),and the selections of songs that she sang were phenomenal. I swear I could talk about this show all day long but there's not enough time.
  Seriously, if you are a Christina fan and didn't get the chance to see her on this tour this is a must have. This tour just proves that Christina is a true artist.",1194480000,,568,4.451923076923077

3223426,2,B000WPAG1Q,"From an older person's perspective (past age 35), this concert is all flash and mumbles, which you may thoroughly like (the Vegas-Madonna glitz); but if you're wanting only to hear Aguilera's beautiful voice, to see her before she married and seemed a bit truer to herself in both message and looks, then opt for the ""Stripped"" concert a few years earlier.  It is there that you'll find more of her singing only with a piano or even solo, directing her message of domestic violence abuse with compassion.  In this concert, her voice and singing are glossed over, a brief interlude drowned out by the music and what seems to be poor sound engineering.  Where's that beautiful voice, something that emerges in ""The Hurt,"" her one and only venture into a slow song that shows her chops...but then it's right back into the fast paced, bright lights of the show.  Was there any feeling in there?  You won't find that here, her dancing a bit more forced, her performers still stunning and now outdancing her (maybe it's the full sheep's head of blond hair that she carries).  But again, if you want just a Broadway-Vegas performance and don't really care about what she sings or even hearing her sing, then this is the concert for you...all fireworks and flash, but little else.",1421625600,,1272,4.733031674208145

I love every song, every move, every note in her voice.....this concert is wonderful, and full of her older stuff which (for me), is better than some of her newer stuff.

3223450,5,B000WPAG1Q,"Last night I watched/listened to a Christina Aguilera concert, ""Back to Basics: Live and Down Under."" I picked up the DVD from the bargain-rack at a local Ross Store. It was a rather good DVD concert. Most concert DVDs seem to have either poor sound or poor photography, or both. This DVD was quite well done. Both the visuals and the sound were quite good and made for enjoyable watching and listening.

I'd heard of Christina Aguilera, but this was the first time I've ever seen her or listened to her music. I was favorably impressed. She's a bit hard to peg, but I'd say she's part Soul, part Madonna and with a bit or Michael Jackson tossed in. The concert was impressive. Christina had about a 15-piece backing band, which reminded me somewhat of a small ""Big Band"" with a couple guitars. In addition, there were about 10 singers/dancers. Sorry if my numbers are off as it's hard to count with so many people on stage. Christina was usually front and center with mic and an active member of the dance troupe. I'd say the whole performance, together with the band, was rather active and athletic and Christina's vocals were excellent. The large Australian crowd, of course, loved the presentation and Christina and her troupe loved the responsive crowd. It was just a good concert and you'd enjoy being there.

The Christina Aguilera disc is hard for me to rate. Although I liked the music and performance, it was not my type of most-enjoyable music so I'd probably give it four stars on that basis alone. However, this is one of the better concert DVDs I own, and I think that merits bumping the whole production up to five stars.

I wish Christina would do more ballads and break up her performances with them to allow listeners over 30 years of age to catch their breath.  It would also be nice if Christina could connect more to her audience instead of just once during ""Beautiful"".

3223459,3,B000WPAG1Q,"Christina's Back to Basics tour is quite a splendour to watch, it is clear that she has matured in many ways than one. What I love about this young talented woman is that she took the reigns of her career into her own control, others like Britney, although very successful, had their careers controlled from the word go (only now is she having more creative freedom) no wonder she had a break down. Christina however had it with doing what others expected her to do and only after her first album broke away with ""Stripped"" it shocked us a little but her talent shone through and she never turned back. This extended to her project ""Back to Basics"" her most mature work. This DVD is spectacular amazing costumes, incredible (and I mean amazing choreography and dancers) and the cherry on the cake, Christina's mind-blowing vocals, man can she let it rip. A Jamie King production, so you know its good, I mean look at Jamie's work with Madonna's ""Reinvention, Confessions and Sticky and Sweet tours as well as Ricky Martins ""Black and White tour"" masterpieces to say the least. I absolutely enjoyed the ""Welcome to the Circus"" section, a visual masterpiece.

The only reason why I did not give this DVD 5 stars is that I felt too many of her classic hits were redone (different versions) e.g Come on over, What a girl wants, the only track that was original was the closing track ""Fighter"", I love to hear my favourite songs the way they are, although stars like Madonna have done a good job of reinventing past songs, e.g Erotica (Confessions Tour). Apart from that Christina rocks again, oh and did I mention that this woman can sing?",1238025600,,1635,4.637931034482759

3223463,5,B000WPAG1Q,"I have to give this dvd a five star for the outstanding timing and pace, it was truly a spectacular show. The songs, most of which I had never heard, other than ""Fighter"", are certainly themed, so it's unlike your typical rock concert. I can't imagine how anyone could watch this tho and not be throughly entertained and impressed. Even if you weren't the hugest Christina fan ever; tho, I must say, my esteem for her certainly increased. She's a total professional, an excellent dancer, and everyone knows her voice rivals Elvis's and wins.

If you like Christina, you will love this. If you only sort of like her and like to collect concerts, you will be throughly impressed. It truly has a great progression of song styles, and everything that comes wow's you more. Really. Outstanding concert. Unusual quality and entertainment and engery and professionalism from a pop star, in a world where amazing shows are the norm.

3223470,5,B000WPAG1Q,"My girl Xtina bought it home with this DVD. It's an awesome concert - much different from her Stripped tour and better in my opinion. There are different set changes which range from a Jook Joint to a Circus. Also love the costumes on Xtina. Here's the setlist
1. Intro (Back To Basics) - the same intro from the BTB album
2. Ain't No Other Man - awesome performance
3. Back In The Day
4. Understand - my favorite song from the album and the vocals are excellent.
5. Come On Over (Jazz Version) - I like the performance. However, I prefer the radio version of COO than this one.
6. Slow Down Baby
7. Still Dirrty/Can't Hold Us Down - Xtina's still got the nasty in her. Very sexy performance
8. Interlude - I Got Trouble - a very raunchy video of Xtina at her nastiest. It seems like you're watching a porno.
9. Makes Me Wanna Pray - how ironic is that? after the raunchy video of Trouble she bursts onto singing MMWP. Great performance though
10. What A Girl Wants (Reggae Version) - Liked it! At first, I was wondering why she would sing a reggae version of this song, but after hearing it, I enjoyed it.
11. Oh Mother - Wow. A very disturbing video in the background as Xtina sings her heart out.
12. Enter The Circus/Welcome - this is where the stage becomes the set of a circus. Really cool performance by Xtina and her dancers.
13. Dirrty - one of my favorite performances from the show. She's singing on a carousel horse while her female dancers are swinging from poles attached to the stage. A man's fantasy :)
14. Candyman - a hot performance
15. Nasty Naughty Boy - she pulls a guy out of the audience, straps him up, and sings her song with her dancers. Very hot
16. Hurt - another one of my favorite songs from her album. the set changes into a night set which is very interesting.
17. Lady Marmalade - she sings the full version!! Great and hot!
18. Interlude - Thank You - a video of her song Thank You including her fans from around the world.
19. Beautiful - Great of course.
20. Fighter - the final peformance.
An awesome tour. If anyone likes the Stripped Tour, they will definitely love this tour. She went Back To Basics to where it all began. Go Xtina.",1202515200,,2173,4.302439024390244

And I must say, I am more jealous than ever of those who saw it in person. Because even Christina Aguilera in my living room was an unbelievable experience!

While Christina has always been an amazing singer, she has not gone all out performance wise. This time, however, she stepped it up, and included theatrical dancing, extensive props, video clips, and crowd participation along with her ""voice of this generation"".

Christina truly is a one-woman show, and considering that she was in her first trimester of pregnancy during this concert is just mind-boggling!

Many of the songs on 2006's Back to Basics were clearly meant to be performed live. Skippable tracks on the album such as ""Welcome"" and ""Nasty, Naughty Boy"" are highlights of the show, especially with a ""volunteer"" for the latter song.

Other highlights are the beautiful ""Hurt"", solo rendition of ""Lady Marmalade"", fun and spunky ""Candyman"", intro ""Ain't No Other Man"", and powerful encores ""Beautiful"" and ""Fighter"".

I highly recommend this dvd, for anyone who enjoys a great show.",1202342400,,1223,4.804761904761905

3223473,5,B000WPAG1Q,"Christina is on top of her game. The stage show is elaborate, the band is comprised of top musicians, and her voice is in fine form. VERY impressive concert and it shows that she just keeps on getting better and better. I like the Back to Basics theme, gives her more of an outlet to really show off her great vocal range, much more so than her last album, Stripped. Anyways, this dvd is definitely enjoyable and a must have for Christina fans.",1201564800,,444,4.36144578313253
3223474,5,B000WPAG1Q,"I attended her performance at the Excel Energy Center in Minneapolis, MN back in March 2007 and this was a night to never be forgotten.  Her incredible synchronization with her musicians, stunning vocal quality, dancing, and overall performance were truly one-of-a-kind.  I've seen Josh Groban live, PCD, Maroon 5, and many other incredible artists perform live and none compare to Christina Aguilera.  She's in this business for the long hall with the powerful vocals to keep her going.  Congratulations Christina and keep up the incredible work.
I can't wait for the DVD!",1197849600,,573,5.195652173913044
3223475,5,B000WPAG1Q,"I saw this show in Spring of 2007 in the States, and it was amazing.  Her voice sounded so great.  She is a very gifted vocalist who puts on a great, high energy show.  The performance was tied for my favorite concert ever, and I've seen many 'singers' who are supposed to be great.  Christina blows them all away...",1197676800,,316,4.305084745762712
3223476,1,B000WPAG1Q,"After the disappointment musically that was ""Back 2 Basics"" the album. I was interested in seeing how Christina AT LEAST improved as a performer. The verdict is in...this concert is just as boring to watch as her last dvd ""Stripped"". Although the stage settings are very elaborate & theatrical (some things I've seen on old Madonna tours)....Christina Aguilera lacks the natural charisma of an exciting performer.

Even for being touted the ""voice of this generation""....her vocals sound subpar for that status. The vocals sound weak & strained...the stress is apparent in Christina's face as she shouts the notes. There were some moments of LIPSYNCHING which came as a shock to me! Normally, singers will lipsynch if its a more dance-oriented number....but she lipsynchs to mask the harder notes. Mariah, Whitney, and Celine never had to do that in their prime...it's sad how the standards have lowered.

I'll have to recommend Justin's ""FutureSex/LoveSound"" Live in MSG or Beyonce ""The Beyonce Experience"" Live at Staples Centers instead of this. These are the best male & female performers out of the young crop....definitely great gift DVDs for this holiday season!",1196812800,,1169,5.245989304812834
3223477,1,B000WPAG1Q,"I did not entertained when I bought this DVD. AT ALL.

It sucks, and absolutely boring. Her songs all very emo! and makes me sleepy. All she does is screaming, yelling, screeching, straining her fcukin' voice. ALL THE TIME. So annoying. How is that ""VOICE of the generation"". She can't even control and runs her own voice. Her vocal runs technique is horrible and Xtina falsetto control are laughable compared with Beyonce. LMAO. And tell Xtina don't ever try to move or dancing cause she look retarded doing it. Thanks.

Go buy the new Beyonce Experience and Justin's concert DVD instead. They both the best entertainers right now and will entertain you in every possible way. If you buy this, don't get mad at me, cause I've warn you, it will disappoint you. Unless you a REALLY obsessed fans of Xtina who don't care if she sucks at live or anything, then buy this. This is not a real show. Even Britney Onyx Hotel DVD show much better than this.",1196294400,,948,4.570588235294117
3223478,5,B000WPAG1Q,"I saw her show in Phoenix back In February and let me just say, I was impressed! I loved her stripped tour so much that her topping that seemed impossible! She did it though and this time there was whips! First off the show opened with two of the hottest act in R&B, Pussycat Dolls and Dainty Kaine! who got the crowed pumped then Christina opened the show with her first single AINT NO OTHER MAN!Through out the two hour concert you see great special effects a few pyros and like Christina fashion, a bunch of confetti. Speaking of fashion, her costumes designed by DSquared and Roberto Cavoli were stunning! She did a little circus act mid way through which in my opinion was very original and entertaining! Bottom line is Christina proves over and over she is an amazing singer/song writer and her performances on stage just comes to show the world ""she aint going no where, no shes' here to stay""!BUY IT!!!!",1195603200,,911,4.560975609756097
3223479,5,B000WPAG1Q,I went to this tour in NY and it was great! Christina is a true artist who can sing and dance and put on an outstanding show. This is totally worth the buy. I'm def getting it when it comes out.,1194566400,,194,3.7560975609756095
3223480,5,B000WPAG1Q,"I actually saw this tour when Christina came down to Miami and all I have to say is WOW OMG!! I thought the Stripped tour was something this one just topped that one. She was fantastic. Didn't lypsing anything(unlike some other popstars that shall remain nameless),and the selections of songs that she sang were phenomenal. I swear I could talk about this show all day long but there's not enough time.
  Seriously, if you are a Christina fan and didn't get the chance to see her on this tour this is a must have. This tour just proves that Christina is a true artist.",1194480000,,568,4.451923076923077
