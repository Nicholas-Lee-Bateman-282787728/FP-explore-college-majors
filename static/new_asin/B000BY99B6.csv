2447724,5,B000BY99B6,"A critically acclaimed documentary that has won Best Film and Best Documentary in four separate film festivals world-wide.  Black professors, psychologists, artists, and writers from around the world give very frank, thought-provoking commentaries about the residual effects of the slave culture on Blacks worldwide: Americans, Africans, Barbadan, Brits, French, etc.  It starts with a brief recap of slave history that everyone knows about then expounds further on how the institutionalization of blacks into  Western white culture and a disconnection from African roots has psychologically left a dramatic void in the Black identity.  The documentary very frankly and intellectually addresses this condition, its reasons, it effects, it causes, the social and psychological impact and uplifts us to embrace being black but realizing the necessity to reconnect with our African Identity and values as African peoples.  Education, of course, is the very key to that., and how the lack of it kills the ability of our advancement.

Highly recommended, well-researched documentary that is a must see.",1202256000,117,1097,5.658536585365853
2447725,5,B000BY99B6,"This documentary is very informative, however I would like to know what the black race is doing with all this knowledge. Despite being aware of our history do we continue to be mentally enslaved or do we emancipate ourselves and create a positive legacy for the next generation. It would be interesting to see in my lifetime if we will be able to do so. Our ancestors sacrificed and paved the way for us to be where we are at today. Lets build on this by recognizing their efforts and knowing despite the odds something positive came from their experiences and so we should continue to carry their torch in a positive light. The best we can do to honour their legacy  this moment in time is to put the ego one side and start to work together to build a better economic, spiritual and social structure for ourselves and the next generation. Once we have respect for ourselves, other nations will also begin to have that respect they once had for us many moons ago. Peace",1193529600,5,969,4.47457627118644
2447726,5,B000BY99B6,"This film documentary caputures some of the most important history that is relevant concerning the Afrikan continent's enslavement, and the pillifering resources struggles which remain our bondage. It is a gripping reality that reinforces my own persona of freedom and individuality; my mind and my life does not belong to no man or belief system,is a challenge that I will protect with my life as I live everyday. Five hundred years later and Afrikans everywhere haven't fully realized that the we must break the chains that are keeping us from our destiny of being the best in human capacity.",1190937600,22,594,5.01010101010101
2447727,3,B000BY99B6,As a final year student in History and Anthropology I have found this documentary extremly useful and would recommend it to anyone even if they are not history or anthropology students.  It also gives on a view from the other side.  I have also recommended this to my lecturer and he may get the other sudents to watch some clips from this.,1187308800,8,340,4.467741935483871
2447728,5,B000BY99B6,"It's interesting that it is called a Holocaust whenever a large group of human beings are slaughtered but when people of African decent are discussed it's something that is simply trivialized.  This documentary shows the extent of the destruction that was deliberately done to those of the African diaspora and how it has shaped our continued destabilized condition.  It is explained how different lenses are used to evaluate how we were exploited and murdered with the rise of the ONLY international economically driven chattel slavery market in human history being our fault because some Africans participated.  However, the fact that Iraqi's are helping Americans or the fact that Jews did business with Nazis is never brought up and used as justification for what they have and are(Iraq) going through.  No one ever says since Jews were involved with Nazis it's the Jews fault for their supposed Holocaust!  The specific point is made concerning how we gave advanced civilization to the world yet the world looks upon those that they should honor with unjustified indifference and contempt.  This documentary is a proper context for understanding true history as well as African history and in that it's still just a snapshot!",1186272000,12,1230,5.155778894472362
2447729,5,B000BY99B6,"This one of the Greatest, Most Exceptional and Informative Movies I ever seen. The Traumatic Maafa(a.k.a. Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade) and its today's consequences on Africans is seen through African eyes. I recommend this documenatry to every human being on this planet, whether you are from African descent or from any other descent. A friend of mine recommended this movie to me and I bought it and greatly thanked my friend for letting me know about this documenatry. I'm a teacher in high school in the Paris area in France and have worked on this documentary with my students, they Greatly liked it. The only regret I would have is that it is not subtitled in French. However, I gave this documentary 5 stars because it more than deserves it. GO GET IT!!!!!",1175904000,21,762,4.78030303030303
2447730,5,B000BY99B6,"500 years later is, in my opinion, one of the most informative, captivating, and eyebrow raising films produced through the honest, but too often ignored lens of the Afrikan centered collective. It not only outlines in outstanding narration, the history of Afrikan peoples' early relationship with the Europeans (and Arabs to a certain extent) via. the Trans-Atlantic slave trade, as well as our experiences in the so called New World; but it breaks down with unshakeable precision, the damaging results such enslavement has had on Afrikans, not only in the Western world, but also back on the Motherland. Such modern-day manifestations are organized into specifc issues which formulates into the chapters of the DVD (i.e. Race, Class, Education, Culture, etc). Without revealing too much, I can say with absolute confidence that this documentary is deserving of all the accolades, awards, and honors received at this point. Truely a must-see!

Peace brothers & sisters!

2447783,1,B000BY99B6,"If you're looking for a well documented history of 500 years of slavery-this is not the movie for you.  This feels like a propaganda piece with a lot of unrelated on camera clips and comments by un identified people complaining about unjustness in the workplace today etc. and how it is related to the historical slave trade.  There is no attempt made to illustrate oppressive policies resulting from the slave trade so these comments come across as unrelated rants.
There was some talk of of the slaves revolting and ""jihad"" and then I realized that this is a Muslim production done in Africa.
It is not an objective or scholarly work and I am quite surprised this movie is ""award winning"" which is the main reason that I purchased it.
I must admit I only watched the first half because it really is not very good.  If you want to understand more about slavery you would be better reading the James Mitchner novel ""Caribbean"" or watching the mini series ""Roots"" on DVD.",1408492800,8,970,4.627906976744186

2447811,5,B000BY99B6,"This film is important because it illuminates very valid points about slavery and its aftermath which, as we all know, is a topic that has been glossed over by our educational system and by our society and our world in general.
There are several things that would improve on its accomplishment.
  First: The inclusion of, and emphasis on leaders who have sacrificed their personal lives to raise the consciousness of the black community, not to mention the world community about slavery. The primary person that comes to my mind is Paul Robeson who was more selfless than any person in the civil rights movement next to MLK, yet hardly gets any mention.  He was a moving orator, singer, actor, athlete, lawyer, educator, activist and lots more.
  Second: Not so much as one spiritual is heard even though it was the music of the black slaves who built our country.
  I found that the editing could have been better. For example: A recorded sound bite is heard as a quotation from a different person is simultaneously projected on the screen. I had to pause the film, read the quotes, and then rewind to listen to the speaker since I could not process both at the same time.
  This film and films like it should be required in the curriculum of all history classes regardless of race. It will be given as Chanukah gifts this year.",1376784000,5,1329,4.645299145299146

2447822,3,B000BY99B6,"The only problem with this film is that it is 50 years too late with its message.  Even as early as 1963, there were people from the West Indies who had been living in Africa for 30 years.  When I arrived in 1964 my first question was, ""How long have West Indians been living in Kenya?""  If African-Americans ever hoped to change  the status of and assist in contributing to Africa's educational, economic development and corporate structure, they should have come in the 1960s when independence was spreading throughout the continent. Many of the countries, like Ghana were open to black immigration, so African-Americans have missed the boat on that one.

Some African-Americans are moving to South Africa at this time.  There is a lot of work to be done there, but first they'd have to remember to leave behind the old 'superiority complex' that many have about being born in the United States.  Also they'd do well to know that there are many highly educated people  in Africa.  I first became aware of this  in the 1960-70s when I asked an African gentleman, ""What area did you study for your Ph. D.?"" to which he replied, ""Which one?"" Over here, people think they've achieved something if they've obtained a B.A.--shocking!!  As for languages a good number of people speak Swahili, English and French, in addition to indigenous languages, while over here we are still stumbling over English.  When I was living in Israel, there were Kenyan students who spoke fluent Hebrew also.  Nowadays, they are learning Chinese (particularly in Mombasa).  That's just a little 'eye opener' as to to the type of people you will encounter and how far behind  we are.

2447830,4,B000BY99B6,"WE MUST LEARN HOW TO TALK TO BE MOST EFFECTIVE AND MOST AFFECTIVE...we must learn what to say and how to say fight with words that do not say 'fight' because we can win the fight if we do that.  We can stop saying ""slave""--that would be a great start... and then wonder why people take such pleasure in saying 'slave' and the memory of enslavement, which serves as a psychological EMPOWERMENT base for some people.  There are between 200,000-400,000 people, even as high as millions of people held in bondage in America right now as I compose this and they are beaten and dehumanized and forced to ""act like a slave"" and some of the people holding others are every color and some who are held by others are every color but most are children. Slavery is not black! Enslavement is not black and people who are dehumanized and forced to act like a slave are not just black people. Bondage and enslavement is a human condition; people will do it; that's guranteed.  Over the past 40 years of my scholarship I've asked hundreds of people what color is slavery and they all said 'black' and I informed them no, the color of bondage and enslavement is human; all humans have done it and all humans will continue to do it in eras and times. In this documentary an African woman wanted to make the statement that in Africa slavery was there but not like in America...that the African slave is a part of the family. Any person held in bondage is certainly not family. The one thing that says so with any animal is: if the gate is left open they will escape.  BUT THEN PEOPLE DO ESCAPE FROM THEIR OWN FAMILY for abuse and dehumanization; so the mention of family when it comes to mistreatment and abuse across the board gives rise to escape.

So I think it is important to know that ""slavery"" is not over like some young people told me and I had to burst their bubble: their illusion.  Slavery is never over; it is a part of the human experience and ""civilizations"" have to fight Hell; they have to fight like crazy to keep atrocities out of their world.  I am so reminded of Jesus on the Cross and the message he brought in his life and the message he left in his death: ""DON'T DO THIS...SUCH AS THIS IS NOT DONE IN THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN.""(my paraphrased)  Atrocity is a part of the human condition that must be addressed and guarded against around the globe in every human society. *THE INSTITUTION OF AMERICAN BONDAGE & ENSLAVEMENT & ATROCITATION of millions of Africans and Native Americans were extraordinary atrocities bar none but then in Germany the dehumanization and atrocitation of the Jews were equally evil.[Evil is the enemy far more that people.]

ALL PEOPLE DO NOT DO ALL THINGS IN ALL TIMES but things are inevitably done in times because they are human things that are done, even the process of dehumanization.

There are so many ways to fight this without picking up a gun. I have taken to writing people my famous letters. If a columnist (no matter skin color) use the word 'minorities' they get a letter from me: Please explain what is meant by 'minorities' is an equalized society.  And if you do explain this I will write you back and let you know you are outdated and antithetical to the American constitution and you are definitely thinking like a racist. Enough of those letters sent to media and they will stop using the phrase: minority, disadvantaged, deprived, depraved.  All got letters from me.  The embarrassment shutdown some of their use but others rebel and use those words even more.

In this documentary I heard a lot of details that differ from what I read in books and journals: like in one port alone the Europeans had detailed records for 6 million Africans they comandeered and there were hundreds of ports.  I read estimates that numbered from 6million to 66million to 666million albeit someone may have been trying to create the devil symbol 666 but in that documentary there were records that clearly inferred what was being said had some validity about the numbers. It was like the biggest atrocity or coming close to the 35 million lost in China in another civil mishap and atrocity.

Rape appears all around the world so does bondage and enslavement. We need to learn how to voice this. We want people to join the movement to look out for and stamp out atrocity  as it buds. PLEASE use the phrase: ""HELD IN BONDAGE AND FORCED TO ACT LIKE A SLAVE"" instead of saying the word 'slave' as if it is a real identity, as if the atrociters were able to create this illusion for real....because the biological anatomy of the human has no cells in it marked S. A 'slave' is a perceived vision; it does not exist; it is an inhumane enforcement in reality: a perceived creation that is only real and true in the minds of the atrociters but history tells us clearly it was never true no matter how much an atrociter tortured his/her victim. *AFRICANS IN AMERICA had night schools even though it meant a loss of eyesight, life or limbs.

I think we can make a gain from this view of it and rush to do our bit against it because we have to stand against atrocity around the planet. We have no time to waste; atrocity is constantly underway.

THANK YOU.  Fight injustice; Fight bondage,enslavement and dehumanization everywhere!

This film helped me understand a little better how the consequences of enslavement of African people are still present in our society.

It must be noted that not all white people are racist. John Brown a white man was an American revolutionary abolitionist; He was hanged on December 2, 1859. Mr. Brown was a man of action; he walked the walk and talked the talk. His death was because he vehemently opposed the institution of Slavery.

2447839,5,B000BY99B6,"500 Years Later is a must in 2011.  For African American and anyone living especially those of African decent because it looks at slavery in general.  I focused on the American segments as I am an American.  It allows a look a the past and potential future.  We see that a lot has changed but also a lot has been lost.  The efforts of all Americans should be to not forget the fact that on American soil people were force to labor the land and the products of some of the issues that we are having now are generations of history that has not been addressed.

People are not aware of their past are destine to repeat it. No we may not be back in chains but failure to know how and why things happened can cause use to repeat them. The documentary addresses many areas that are not spoken on it is a great tool for discussion in or out of the classroom.

This is a great group discussion with any group not just African American. I would suggest watching it with a mixed group of individuals with varied backgrounds, races,etc. and you will be amazed at the various views that come out of it.  The fact that it has been 500 years since slavery was documented to be discussed here allows for opportunity to see how much history is not taught these days.  This is not just a documentary that has people of color discussing how bad slavery was but it speaks to you in what are your going to do the next for knowledge of it is one thing but how has it changed the lives of the offsprings. Are we destine to repeat it..watch it with an open mind and find out where you and/or your friends stand on the issues addressed.

It is a must see for a history class to understand American history that sometimes leaves out people of color. Slavery ended not because people thought it was so bad but because it was a matter of supply and demand.  The thought patterns of the country were changed by those who took a stand to change yet so many of the mentality issues that existed during slavery still exist only in other ways.

For such a disdainful commentary, I fail to see you offering an alternative. SHAME ON YOU MR. PEYTON!!! SHAME ON YOU!!! Though you are obviously entitled to your own opinion, you might want to remember that if you are merely criticizing others attempts to bring to light the history that created the problem and are not offering a solution to the problem, then you are simply part of the problem, if for no other reason than you continue to perpetuate the problem! SHAME ON YOU!!!

This was a beautifully, thought provokingly, well organized documentary. Being a 47 y/o white female, I was left both embarrassed and remorseful for the actions of what I can only assume were the actions of some of my ancestors, but certainly by those of whites that came before me. I AM SOOOOOOOO SORRY FOR WHAT WE DID, & CONTINUE IN SOME CASES TO DO TO YOU!!! NOT JUST AS A RACE, BUT AS INDIVIDUALS!!! IT WAS WRONG!!! If I could change what was done I would.  But I can't. Neither can any of the rest of you.  But that doesn't mean you just turn around and walk away.  We ALL (regardless of your race) have a responsibility to get up every day and do what we can to foster and improve not only race relations between each other, but most importantly, to teach and SHOW the young African Americans (or whatever country you're in)coming up that they are beautiful inside and out, and capable of everything and anything that their white ""counterparts"" are, that they are WORTHY of the best life has to offer, that they have such a beautiful and rich African history to lavish themselves in & to pull from (outside/aside from the torturous portions), but that it is of paramount importance to learn and embrace the worst of their history, as painful and mind-boggling as it may be, for it is the only way to ensure that it won't be repeated!  But most important of all, we MUST create a way, an environment, for these children to be taught all of this.  And in a day where money is so tight, funding so difficult to be found, the simplest most basic way to begin is simply by loving your neighbor. By treating them the way that you know you would want to be treated.  By quietly practicing random acts of kindness with out the expectation of receiving so much as a pat on the back for compensation, but just doing it because it's the right thing to do.
