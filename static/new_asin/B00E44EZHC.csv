5889530,5,B00E44EZHC,Hard to find great classic cartoons and what they show now most are just junk. So its nice to be abel to show my kids what classic cartoons are all about,1378857600,,153,3.967741935483871
5889531,4,B00E44EZHC,LETS START BY SAYING THE DISCS ARE NOT SILVER A AND B SIDES. WHICH MAKES THEM EASIER TO HANDLE. ALSO EVIDENCE OF REMASTERING HAS GONE ON. THE COLOURS ARE NICE AND BRIGHT. WHICH MAKES A CHANGE FROM SIMILAR ITEMS BOUGHT IN THE PAST. WHICH IS GOOD BECAUSE I DO LIKE THIS CARTOON.,1378684800,,276,4.326923076923077
5889532,5,B00E44EZHC,My favorite Saturday morning caeroon! I used toalways get excited to hear the words: CAPTAIN CAVEMAN!!!!! Mel Blanc is best.,1378598400,,124,5.25
5889533,5,B00E44EZHC,"If there's one cartoon series I have wanted more than any other, it's Captain Caveman, I grew up with this show and it's such a joy to finally have it on a complete series DVD (2 discs)
For anyone who's never watched it, this series by Hanna Barbera is a take on Charlie's Angels, with a loud and hairy caveman they found in the ice and defrosted. Cavey is voiced by animation voice god, Mel Blanc and can pull out anything from his hairy body including dinosaurs. Each 20 minute episode has two 10 minute stories.
It hasn't aged a day and if you grew up with the series, you'll immediately be back in kid mode. While you're considering buying this cartoon, they've also released Help!...It's The Hair Bear Bunch (another must buy) Now if only they'd released The C.B. Bears.",1378080000,2,775,4.50354609929078
5889534,5,B00E44EZHC,"My children think the cartoons from the 70's are horrible, however they never stop watching them while they are on.... it's a must for your family!",1376956800,,147,4.6923076923076925
5889535,5,B00E44EZHC,"Who would ever have imagined during those glorious days of childhood that one day, thanks to current technology,. we would be able to OWN these fantastic shows!!!! To watch over and over again; an embarrassment of riches for sure! I don't think there are any HB shows I do not own, but if there are, that will be rectified SOON! This one (and The Roman Holidays, which I ADORE) are my favorites. Yes, you CAN go home again, get this DVD< if you've never met the Captain now is the time to get acquainted! Enjoy!",1376092800,4,511,4.389473684210526
5889536,5,B00E44EZHC,"It's the catch phrase voiced by Mel Blanc the legendary voice artist we all grew up with and loved. Now Warner Archive has finally gotten around to releasing this long lost animated gem. If it were the Warner Bros main branch label no doubt we would have had Season One part 1 with 10 episodes and they would have milked it into 4 releases but luckily WA stepped to the plate and released the whole series of Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels in one go. True the episodes are burned onto DVD-Rs so some may have trouble playing them on PCs or DVD recorder devices but on my end I have never had any problem playing the WAC animated releases, the picture looks great for it's age and the cartoon still cracks me up to this day, pure Hanna Barbara goodness!  Here are the list of episodes for those who are curious and the original air dates. This dvd set is highly recommended by ""THE"" Retroman!

I haven't seen this show since the 1980s and re-watching the episodes brought back a lot of great memories!!!! The first 24 episodes originally aired as a segment on ""Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics"" (1977-79) and the remaining 16 episodes were broadcast in its own half-hour timeslot in 1980.",1375315200,27,672,5.289719626168225

5889543,5,B00E44EZHC,"You cannot fathom the excitement that ripped through me when I saw this was available on DVD. No, it's not educational, as I'm sure people have complained about. But I, along with many others, grew up watching this every Saturday and it was for pure entertainment and imagination. I had books and sesame street and the outside world with my dad for education. But my Saturday mornings were dedicated to my breakfast and these cartoons before I enjoyed playing outside. I bought this set along with some other cartoon sets from my childhood for my late insomnia filled nights and in hopes my child will enjoy them as well. Unfortunately, i don't have a DVD player and these will not play on my laptop. Fortunately, we were able to enjoy them at my parents and the quality & sound is surprisingly great. I highly recommend reliving your childhood!",1499299200,2,845,4.716216216216216

I was pleasantly surprised that the quality of the show is pretty good.  I expected it to be fuzzier, but the picture is pretty clear.  The TV in my son's room is 47"", so I'm not sure how it looks on a larger tv, but it looks good.  The sound quality is nice too.

5889557,5,B00E44EZHC,"The Flintstones caveman/cave animal gags crossed with a Scooby Doo mystery solving team/Charlie's Angels homage and you have The ""Cavey"" and ""Curvey"" Teen Angels team.

 Mel Blanc was hilarious as the inquisitive, child-like Captain Caveman, adjusting to modern day 1970s life and springing into action with his hero battle cry and his powerful if not too dependable flying wooden club (""unga bunga...bad time for power failure""...(crash!)) and accompanying prehistoric animal assistants inside the club to capture the bad guys.

Brainy Dee Dee (Vernee Watson), perky Taffy (Laurel Page), and easily confused Brenda (Marilyn Schreffler) comprised the Teen Angels team with Brenda stumbling across clues, Taffy launching zany plans to trap the bad guys, and Dee Dee putting all the clues together to solve the mystery with Cavey supplying the brute strength and comedy relief.

5889639,5,B00E44EZHC,"Another very popular late '70s Saturday morning cartoon has just reached DVD through Warner Archive and, depending on your attachment to childhood memories, is either a reason for celebration or for an ""Ugh."" Actually, either way, it still adds up to an ""Ugh,"" flawlessly performed by the great Mel Blanc himself, in one of his last leading cartoon character roles.

Wouldn't it have been weird to be at the network pitch for Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels? ""Okay, there's this caveman guy, but he's a super hero that's been trapped in ice for about 2 million years until these shapely young detectives, who happen to be exploring the frozen north in their miniskirts, discover him and he helps them solve mysteries...

""No, it's not another Scooby Doo. Not exactly. It's like Charlie's Angels but with a hairy caveman instead of David Doyle...

""Let me put it another way...""

In 1977, Charlie's Angels was all the rage, along with disco music and Star Wars. Hanna-Barbera worked both into several cartoons of the era, including another series you may think you dreamed but really happened called Casper and the Angels (which I kind of liked anyway). Even Yogi Bear eventually flew into the galaxy and visited floating space discos. (You didn't dream that, either.)

Captain Caveman looks like one of the Slag Brothers from Wacky Races and must have been the most fun element of the show to animate. Being composed of lines and scribbles, he was the seven dwarfs to the more naturalistic Teen Angels, who presented more of an animation challenge, as with Snow White (this may be the first time Captain Caveman has been compared to Snow White.)

Therefore, sometimes the Teen Angels look wonderful, striking the poses on the model sheets at one moment, but look awkward the next. Such is the result of breakneck production speed at limited budgets, especially when you consider that Captain Caveman was a ten-minute segment sandwiched into the two-hour Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics.

In its premiere year, the two-hour block contained a segment of Laff-A-Lympics, a Scooby Dooadventure, a Captain Caveman and another Laff-A-Lympics. The Scooby segments have been released as the ""lost"" third season. You can even find pretty much all of the Laff-A-Lympics on various DVDs, and can re-create your Saturday morning paradise. I would suggest frying some bacon to make it a multi-sensory experience.

A few more Captain Caveman shorts were made for the second season, retitled Scooby's All-Stars. You could also root for Cavey and the Angels as competitors on the ""Scoobie-Doobies"" team in the Laff-A-Lympics segments. In Spring 1980, the Captain got his own half hour. The DVD set pairs two stories into 20 half-hours; 40 total cartoons. This is likely the way the series was packaged for syndication and cable.

Clearly this was a satisfactory, if not phenomenal, success for Hanna-Barbera and ABC. A board game, coloring books, comics and other merchandise graced the store shelves. I even have a card game that features Cavey, Taffy, Brenda and Dee Dee.

The three Angels don't get much time to develop character aspects in the short episodes. The premise itself, in HB tradition, is spelled out during the theme song in 30 seconds by none other than Gary Owens. Like Charlie's Angels, there is a ""smart one"" in this trio - that would be Dee Dee. (Remember the wonderful Vernee Watson? I recall seeing her as the Bachlorette on The Dating Game!) Brenda comes up with wacky plans and schemes and is voiced by Marilyn Schreffler, who also played Olive Oyl around this time. Taffy (Laurel Page) flirts with Cavey to get him to do brave deeds.

Cavey yells his name a lot. I would imagine millions of kids did, too, though Blanc's performance of the yell is clearly the same one used over and over. Also used a lot is a transition device with a window and other things flying at the camera. Because of the brevity of each story, they all start with a Teen Angel exposition line: ""Well, here we are on a Mississippi Riverboat!"" ""Golly, it's groovy to be here in New York City!"" It is recommended that a few Captain Caveman episodes be savored at a time, instead of binge viewing, because of these patterns.

There is no real theme song, just some of the background music with Owens, telling us how hilarious and sometimes scary it's going to be. The first and second season end titles, at least on the DVD set, come from the tail end of Laff-A-Lympics and look like the type was laid over that spin art some of us used to make at the carnival.

The third season end titles have a country sound to them with different credits. There are some fun stories in the mix, including one that finds the Teen Angels back in time to meet Cavey's parents. Unlike Scooby Doo mysteries, which are always supernatural in theme, the stories here are also about jewel robberies and smuggling rings without as many of those disguised ghosts that can inexplicably fly through the air and pick up solid objects even though they turn out to be 16mm films with crude little sound systems.

Zoinks, I'm getting nostalgic. Excuse me now while I fry up some bacon.

I forgot about this cartoon,then I ran across it on Amazon.  2 disc good graphics on the DVD's I have seen some dvds that are just sliver/not printed (in other type of dvd sets).

I rediscovered my love of this show in very short order.  The funny/goofier thing for me was the characters intro on the first few episodes?!?  The first 3 episodes I thought ""Brenda"", and ""DEE DEE"" was introduced wrong?!? I was like ""Brenda for a pretty black chick"". and ""Dee dee"" white.  It was also nice to see ""Dee dee"" as a smart Black girl. The first season all the girlies basically had their arm/hands/fist  bowed out on the sides of body- like superman?!! I loved the way they had them walking too?!?  You just got to love the 70's/pre 80's animation !?!!

The second ""season"" they really started to change up and expand the story line- The first season was just basically the same gags repeated.
Overall good set. Enjoyable -wish for more!?!",1520985600,,964,4.526011560693641
