8742524,5,B018J3V9FE,"An amiable jaunt through beautiful Marin County, this ride is harder than it appears. Indeed, the camera famously flattens terrain, but Pauls breathing (and the dashboard) reveal the challenges of this ride.

In this video, we travel through some lovely spots in Marin, as Paul provides a veritable lecture on exercise physiology, proper riding and working out hard for pleasure. This video  travels through rural terrain, farmland and some more civilized spots. All are sunny and charming, and the casual rider can just amble along indoors. However, if you follow Pauls advice and the dashboard, it also satisfies the pain seekers among us.

Indeed, coming in 2 parts it runs for slightly over 2 hours, and the audio tracks offer differing kinds of support and, frankly, entertainment. In this and the more recent videos, the dash is less intrusive, used more selectively and better amplifies Pauls attendant commentary. I enjoyed this ride and, as always, the video provided numerous audio options. First go round, I listened to the default audio, but on the second, I provided my own soundtrack. These options work incredibly well to deal with the obvious tedium of indoor training against the backdrop of gorgeous outdoor videos.  In fact, though it's sunny outside as I write this, the temps are below 20 F, and the surfaces snow-covered.  Not worth it to venture out on 2 wheels!

I highly recommend this addition to your video library, along with others Ive reviewed on this site and Amazon.

Happy trails!",1514160000,,1513,5.028
