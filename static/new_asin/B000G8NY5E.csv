The semantic part of my brain says ""this is BS, there are warning labels all over that mention explicit content, nudity, and even the back of the DVD clearly says 'uncensored footage from ... model shows and adult entertainment shows' and yet it IS CENSORED every time they show nudity below the navel... as in the opposite of uncensored.""  I ABHORE censorship particularly when it's this obvious-in-your-face digital touch-up that proclaims ""we filmed this candid action but we're not letting you see all of it uncut.""

But to be fair, this DVD is sexy when it does show footage that doesn't have to be edited, and it has A LOT of that kind of footage (boobs, booty shake, girls kissing, up skirt panty shots, etc).  There are three extensive scenes in this which feature the girls, quite a lot of content.  And while all three suffer blurred/blobbed out portions so you NEVER see the girls' southern parts, at least the blurring is localized rather than making their entire lower torso fogged out.  It's still absurd to show this much footage that has to be censored.  I'm kinda annoyed that the publisher was shown as Funimation but my copy arrived and had the TokyoPop High Voltage bar along the left side.  Had I known it was actually TokyoPop I may have had second thoughts about buying this.  Leave me a comment if you have an original of this DVD in case this senseless expurgation is a new trend perhaps.

One good thing is at least this contains some of the same scenes that were entirely destroyed in the Gold (or was it Jade?) Street Fury DVDs - this time at least they left the topless footage alone.  And there is a little bit of full nudity as long as the girls are just standing there (hints of side bush every now and then).  But considering how much of this takes place in a strip club or at an adult radio station and the activity is well beyond what this series can actually show, again I have to ask why did they bother to show us so much censored footage?

The ""extras"" mostly are just the model gallery which only contains photos of the host girl in bikinis, no nudity and it's the same girl in every shot.  Ho hum.",1423008000,,2190,4.469849246231155

I wish there was more KT So in the video.",1302134400,,124,3.310344827586207
