8473435,3,B004XW6P6O,"This is the original Japanese anime, which has additional episodes not included in the American version.  It is much ""darker"" than the American version, which has been watered down for a younger set. The captions are OK, some are hard to understand because the translation isn't perfect.  The biggest problem I found is that episode 24 is missing.  The episodes from 24-30 are misnumbered (off by one) so 24 is actually 25 and there are two copies of episode 31, one numbered 30 and one numbered 31.  They should have done a better job considering the cost of the item, which is why I gave this an OK rating as opposed to a higher one.  Otherwise this is a great way to practice your Japanese.",1314835200,7,693,4.512
