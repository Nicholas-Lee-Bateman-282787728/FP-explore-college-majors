426239,4,6301977750,"If we can judge by the simple fact that Dickens novel of the French revolution was required reading in high school courses on English literature in the 1940s, we might assume that it is among his best known, if not most popular, books. What makes this film so special is the understated performance of Ronald Colman. That word isn't appropriate in any attempt to describe what he is in every scene. He is so real, so himself in his modest assurance of natural gifts. These factors help to account for the touching realism of the final scenes when Colman feels, says, and does the right things to comfort the wretched companion of his.execution. We know and believe in the source of his calm courage and strength; he is ""laying down his life for his friend"" and experiencing that ""greater love"" surpassing understanding.",1490486400,4,819,4.774647887323944

426270,5,6301977750,I have never seen this superb film.  A young Ronald Colman is magnificent.  Really well done.  A young David O. Selsnick (spelling) produced the film.  Really fine.  Life changing about the French Revolution.  Its an old film (1935) but well worth the effort to see it.,1475452800,,269,4.739130434782608

Dickens is so good, and the reality of the French Revolution is a very stark and scary back drop to this drama. I really enjoyed the performances of all the actors.

426310,5,6301977750,"A five-star rating does not do justice to rate this classic movie in a DVD presentation.  The master of Michelangelo stature to combine both Hollywood romantics and historic fact is found in David O. Selznick.  The Master achieved this high degree of production in his classic ""Gone With the Wind.""  With genius he took the classic novel ""A Tale of Two Cities"" by Charles Dickens as well as the historic facts of the French Revolution and combined both to be reality.  The reality was the prelude to the Reign of Terror that resulted in several innocents sent to the guillotine by Marat and Robespierre.  Ronald Colman, Donald Woods, Elizabeth Allan, Edna May Oliver, Reginald Owen, Basil Rathbone, Blanche Yurka and Henry B. Walthhall were superb in their acting performance with the crowd scenes for the storming of the Bastille, thronged courtrooms, the eerie festival of public execution and the emotional power of Revolution.  I have seen several movies based on this very novel, and still, David O. Selznick is above
all those productions and second to none.  It is a privilege to have this DVD and other classic productions by Selznick in my DVD collection!",1465430400,6,1164,4.938461538461539

426335,3,6301977750,"As a lover of the original novel, I found this to be a decent summation of many of the key scenes of A Tale of Two Cities.  However, in an attempt to cover these key scenes, the powerful emotions that are conveyed in the book are lost both by the time spent developing them and in the actors melodramatic performances.  The music falls flat as well, and comes across as very sappy and forgettable.

The redeeming performance belongs, as other reviewers have mentioned, to Ronald Colman, who manages to give a believable performance to Sydney Carton that both entertains and captures the audience during the scenes he is in.

This film is likely a credit to the era it was created, and is a reminder that such a powerful story needs to be remade today.",1456617600,3,751,4.54074074074074

426344,5,6301977750,One of my favorite movies of all time.  This has a very reflection of Christ's love for us in that He gave His life so that we can have life.  The love of one man for his secret love caused me to think of what a sacrifice has been made for me.  Greater love has no man that he gives his life for a friend.  This movie reflects that in my opinion.,1450742400,,346,3.763888888888889
426385,5,6301977750,"My favorite of all the movie versions.  Ronald Colman stands out but all the

426388,3,6301977750,"The film is great, but the DVD started skipping 3 years after I bought it and two years later it was worse. When I played it almost three years after that, it basically skipped/stalled for the first 22 minutes, and then skipped periodically thereafter.
Amazon confirms that this is the same item I purchased way back when.
As you can tell, I don't watch the films I buy very often; this is because I own so many that, even though I watch one every evening, it takes nearly 3 years now to go through them all (this is not a boast, just an explanation). They are stored vertically on bookshelves or media storage of various types. Other DVDs have degraded over time, but it is a very rare occurrence (perhaps 0.5%), not counting two that just plain refused to play all of a sudden (as it were). I have, over the years removed more films (VHS and DVD) from my collection after seeing them a few times and deciding I didn't want to keep them than that.
So when I find Amazon selling the same edition that failed for me, I begin to wonder if I want to invest in another copy. Perhaps, in a few months, I will feel like doing so.",1443916800,2,1123,4.276995305164319

426393,5,6301977750,"Reviewers of the day say that Ronald Colman's performance as Sydney Carton actually ENHANCED Dickens' celebrated tale, and it is hard not to agree.  RC really should have won the Oscar for this one:  he is not his usual urbane gentleman---even the thin moustache was shaved for period authenticity.

426461,3,6301977750,"The plot is basically one of a family escaping France in 1789 as the ""reign of terror"" continues with innocent and guilty people being beheaded at the whim of the mom who is seeking retribution for their suffering at the hands of the monarchy and wealthy class.  The focal point is on the nephew of an evil aristocrat Who disagrees with the treatment of the lower classes and decides to leave France for good. He receives a letter from his tutor asking for his help when this is actually a scam to trick the nephew into returning to France where he will be condemned to death. The acting is quite well done by all with Basil Rathbone portraying the evil aristocrat perfectly.  Maybe the movie was short or else so well done that it seemed to be over very quickly.

The Amazon TV software connection to my movie account is very poor, Note my TV is NEW, my wideband Comcast connection to the internet is good and I am able to listen to Gary Hendershot's wide-web program on my TV wideband set with NO problems.

AMAZON Login:  BIG PROBLEM !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Note when trying to log into my Amazon movie account, Amazon software will not recognize my Password or account name.  Note further, much later, I also  tried to use the special AMAZON password assigned for login on my TV set from AMAZON, that was put up on the TV screen, but got no results.

PROBLEM:  Amazon TV software procedures via the internet, is super poor.  (Note I never have any problems with reading Kindle books from Amazon.  Why not use the Kindle interface also for movies.)  On my TV I have a wireless keyboard with my new (2014) Samsung 60inch TV, BUT the Amazon movie software interface will NOT let me use my TV keypad for ANY letters or numbers.  The only key it recognizes on my keypad is the ""Enter"" key.  I must use Amazon's displayed keyboard on the TV picture, which is very slow and tedious to use.  Yet when I go to my ThinkPad PC, NO PROBLEM with the same identical input and I am  immediate able to see the movie, Tale of Two Cities.  I have given up on watching this movie on my new TV set, after 2 hours of failures.  Maybe Netflix is the way to go ??

I am not a beginner at this type of input.

A manager at Amazon needs to pick some average guy/girl off the floor and have them login on a Samsung wireless Keypad TV set.
Set up the time clock to see how long it takes them to login into their accounts, and then how log it takes to start the movie.

very disappointed

Amazing period re-creation of the famous Charles Dickens novel of the French Revolution and its impact on England,  with splendid sets, costumes and photography; and of course great casting and acting.  Speaking of which, this could be Ronald Colman's best role ever, as the tragic Sydney Carton.  Colman was unique among British actors of the 30's era, as he had deep sensibilities and sensitivities more akin to American actors, in addition to being polished.

426850,5,6301977750,"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this 1935 filmed version of A Tale of Two Cities, with Ronald Colman in the role of Sydney Carton, the reluctant hero of the novel.  This is a difficult role to play.  Colman must bring a comedic touch to his scenes in court where he helps defend Charles Darnay from a charge of treason, and, of course, he must be serious and believable in the end when he delivers his famous speech, ""It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known."" Even now, a day later at the computer keyboard, this tragic scene continues to affect me emotionally.

The rest of the cast is equally good, particularly Edna May Oliver as Miss Pross, the guardian of Lucie Manette, the heroine of the story.  The final showdown between Miss Pross and the villain of the film, Madame Defarge, may not have the production values of a 21st Century film, but it is still likely to have most viewers clapping their hands in delighted approval of the English bulldog who defeats her French antagonist.

Speaking of production values, this film looks like what it is -- a film made in the early 1930's.  Even so, I was impressed by the ability of the filmmakers to tell a difficult story with a cast of thousands in a believable fashion.  The storming of the Bastille by the Paris mob, done without computer assistance, was impressive and convincing.  The famous end scene of the execution of the aristocracy in the public square in Paris brought to life the horror of this bloody nightmare in French history.

Purists may want to know, how true is the film to Dickens' novel?  True, I think, to the spririt of the book, if not to all the details.  That is the best we can expect when we turn a long novel into a two hour film.  What is most impressive to me is how well this old film stands up over time.  It continues to entertain us and demonstrates that a good story, well told, by competent actors and a clever director does not need all the bells and whistles available to modern filmmakers.

I did not expect the movie to perfectly mirror the book. It took me weeks to get through the book but you only had two hours of the movie. Some of the scenes were thus condensed (for instance, Mr. Darnay only had one trial in Paris during the movie but two trials in the book). I don't, however, think any of the condensing was to the detriment of the story.

I also made a comparison between the movie and what I imagined in my mind while reading the book. It was pretty much spot on except for the final scenes.

And really, I loved the movie. It's so intense, and portrays the madness of the period very well. Made in 1935, it's in black and white, which I think was very effective. It stars Ronald Colman as the lawyer Sydney Carton, Elizabeth Allan as Lucie Manette, and Donald Woods as Charles Darnay. I think the casting was very well done too; Madame DeFarge and Miss Pross are also well played. It's not quite so cheesy either, and I think probably paints a fairly accurate portrayal of the French Revolution, though scholars might disagree. It sticks pretty true to the original novel, except for the fact that Darnay has only one trial in the film, rather than two as in the book. I think it was thought that the film would be too long if both trials were included.

A Tale of Two Cities was certainly much more moving than Gone With the Wind (referring to the movies here.) I was crying a little bit at the end. The ending is a really powerful one. I would definitely recommend this old but great movie to fans of the novel or people intereste

The most remarkable sequences of this film are the great Parisian crowd scenes engineered by Jacques Tourneur and Val Lewton, who would in a few years show they could do just as much in their horror films for RKO with almost no resources at all; even so, the sheer majesty of the sequences of the storming of the Bastille and the final execution in the Place de la Revolution are pretty stunning. (It has been said over 17,000 extras were used for this film, and you seem to see all of them.)

The rest of the film is directed by Jack Conway, and it's pretty well done too (even though the dominant musical theme is for some reason ""Adeste Fideles""). A TALE OF TWO CITIES was one of Dickens' most melodramatic novels (it was clearly written with the stage in mind), and so the plot adapts itself very well to the film medium: Madame de Farge (Blanche Yurka) is there at her most absurdly evil, evoking the poses of nineteenth-century melodrama in her testimony before the Revolutionary Tribunals, while Lucy Manette (ideally cast, with Elizabeth Allen) simpers uselessly and acts pretty and docile and noble. Ronald Colman's plummy enunciation always takes some getting used to, but it's nice to see him cast here in a part (Sydney Carton) that at least allows him to be a drunken scalawag as well as nobly redemptive. Edna May Oliver is, almost inevitably, here (as Miss Pross), and Basil Rathbone gets to say hilariously unfeeling comments as the despicable Marquis St. Evremonde. Only the insipid Donald Woods as Charles Darnay fails to do much in one of the bigger roles. The way in which MGM oversimplifies the history of the Revolution is pretty ridiculous but expected, as is its espousing of patriotic British sentiments (ludicrously, Edna May Oliver gets to call upon the name of George III when hindering Yurka in preventing the escape of Allan and her family). And the ending still carries the Dickensian emotional wallop as Carton ascends the stairs to the guillotine at the very end.",1318204800,,2449,4.830952380952381

Directed by Jack Conway

An elaborate adaptation of Dickens' classic tale of the French Revolution. Dissipated lawyer Sydney Carton defends Charles Darnay from charges of spying against England. He becomes enamored of Darnay's fianc&eacute;e, Lucie Manette, and agrees to help her save Darnay from the guillotine when he is captured by Revolutionaries in Paris.

Absolutely the finest of all versions of the venerable novel by Charles Dickens, and superb film making on every conceivable level, with the definitive career performance from the great Ronald Colman. There's not a false note sounded among the literally hundreds of supporting performances.

Truly one of the great films of all time, and an honor to view, whether it's the first or one hundred one times you've seen it.

Very few films in history rank total perfection; this is one of them.

For fans of Ronald Colman, A Tale of Two Cities is not to be missed. Highly recommend!

426972,4,6301977750,"The Ronald Colman 1935 film version of Charles Dickens' 1859 novel 'A Tale of Two Cities' is the best known and most popular of at least 15 film and TV movies with the same title.  A best picture Oscar nominee in 1937, this version has one of Hollywood's most popular leading men ever in the staring role of dissolute lawyer Sydney Carton, who goes to the guillotine in place of the husband of a woman Carton loves.

The very popular book is famous for both its opening words (""It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...."") and its final words (""It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to, than I have ever known."")  The film keeps these words.

The secondary characters are particularly memorable.  Jerry Cruncher is a ""go for"" for a London bank and a grave robber for medical research.  Miss Pross is the highly devoted governess to the leading female character (Lucie Manette), and she is a very strong character.  Over the years, Madame Defarge knits into her shawls the identities of people who should go to the guillotine when the French Revolution comes to Paris--which is the main setting of the action of the film, shared with London (the two cities in the title).

Like most films made from excellent novels, this one suffers primarily from the need for abridgment--and possibly the absence of color, as it was filmed in black and white just about the time color was first used successfully in movies.  IMDB's voters give this film 7.9 out of 10 points--high praise, indeed.",1311033600,,1559,4.519572953736655
426973,5,6301977750,"I like this old version of the classic better than some of the new ones.  The old-fashioned sentimentality and melodrama of the style of acting displayed in this 1935 version of the ""Tale,"" I think are very suitable to the tone of Dickens' works.  The way that the somewhat comic ""character roles"" are played, like those of Mr. Lorry and Miss Pross, strikes me as particularly Dickensian.

On the other hand, the performance of Ronald Coleman in the role of the sacrificial Sydney Carton seems typical of modern movie anti-heroes--those that appear, say, in the 1950s and afterwards.  His anti-hero personality (disguising a heroic loving heart that will give all) makes him stand out as a singular character in the midst of all the others--and that's suitable because his destiny stands out amidst those of the  more ordinary types in the story who will live to enjoy more ordinary fates than he.

Besides the fact that this movie is a deeply moving version of a story about an extraordinary act of sacrificial love, for which I especially cherish and mourn the tragic character of Carton, I remember the film mostly because of Miss Pross as played by Edna May Oliver.  One of my favorite of all movie scenes is when Pross stands up to the murderous Madame Defarge.  It's so funny when this determined and protective servant/guardian draws herself up, barring the door to her charges within, and declares, ""I am an English woman!"" and then proceeds to prove herself the dominant of  two tigresses as she and the blood-crazed French woman  fly into an instantaneous ferocious tangle!  Pross is a tough and daunting personality, yet uniquely lovable.

Another great old time character actor best known for his portrayal of Sherlock Holmes appears here as the despicable Count Evremonde.  I've always been fascinated with Basil Rathbone as a person having an interesting and unusual face, especially in profile.  So, I like to see him in movies just to study the Rathbone bones!  (Watch for a good glimpse of his profile in one scene here when he climbs into bed.)

The last time I watched this movie I noticed that the scenes of the storming of the Bastille were actually pretty thrilling!  And it's remarkable to think they were accomplished without digital computerization.",1309305600,4,2274,4.9109947643979055

426975,5,6301977750,"IMO, the very best of all the versions of a classic.

426986,5,6301977750,"I work in a middle school library and recently performed a reading from Tale of Two Cities for multiple groups of students. I chose to highlight what I called the ""slapdown"" between Madame Defarge and Miss Pross. I stopped my reading after the gun goes off, but did not reveal to the students who went down -- a cliffhanger of sorts to encourage them to perhaps choose the book themselves, or at the very least appreciate that the classics can be anything but dry and boring. I kid you not, the kids were totally into it. That night at home I reported to my 5 and 9 year old about how much the big kids loved Tale of Two Cities and retold the excerpt. Now THEY demanded to know who died in the altercation. What could I do? The book is just too much for either of them so I decided I needed a really great version of the movie. Amazon clearly dictated THIS version was the way to go. I'm not going to say it will hold the attention of the average youngster, but my children keep wanting to watch it. The 9 year old and I are talking about big ideas and questions. The 5 year old is telling her kindergarden friends about Sidney Carton and the guillotine. So long as someone who knows the story is there to fill in the gaps, this movie has enough action and virtuosity to carry the day. Now, my daughter actually claimed to be disappointed by how the fight scene came off on screen (no disrespect to the malevolent performance of Madame Defarge)but as so often happens, even the best screen adaptations are but imitations of the movies we make in our heads while reading.",1276128000,,1570,4.343537414965986
426987,3,6301977750,"""A Tale of Two Cities"" was the remarkable 1859 story by Charles Dickens that appeared as 31 weekly installments in Dickens' own periodical. It was made as a film several times, including 3 silent versions prior to this 1935 version, and again in 1958.

The 30s were a great time for Dickens films, including ""Oliver Twist"" (1933) with Dickie Moore, ""Great Expectations"" (1934) with Henry Hull and Jane Wyatt, ""The Mystery of Edwin Drood"" (1935) with Claude Rains, ""Scrooge"" (1935), ""David Copperfield"" (1935) with none other than W. C. Fields, and ""A Christmas Carol"" (1938) with Reginald Owen.

He's not much remembered today, but in his time, Ronald Colman was a leading actor in England and then in the US. He starred in silent films like ""Stella Dallas"" (1926) and ""Beau Geste"" (1926) and when talkies came along he was one of the first to be nominated for an Oscar as ""Bulldog Drummond"" in 1929 (he lost to George Arliss in ""Disraeli""). He would be nominated again in 1943 (""Random Harvest"") and won in 1948 for ""A Double Life"" for which he also won the Golden Globe.  He's probably best remembered for his performance in ""Lost Horizon"" (1937), but he was equally good in ""Under Two Flags"" (1936) and ""The Prisoner of Zenda"" (1937). For his role as Sidney Carton, Colman shaved off his mustache,  something he rarely did.

Was there ever a greater villain than Basil Rathbone, whose brief appearance as the Marquis only hints at his true skills. Shortly after making this film, Rathbone would give us such great performances as the abusive Mr. Murdstone in ""David Copperfield"" (1935), evil Sir Guy in ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" (1938), Baron von Frankenstein in ""Son of Frankenstein"" (1939), and the evil Captain Esteban in ""The Mark of Zorro"" (1940). Lest he be thought of as having only one note, Rathbone could play the hero as well, starting with Sherlock Holmes in ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"" (1939) and the 13 Holmes movies that followed.

Reginald Owen gives his usual good performance as Carton's friend and partner. He's best known as Ebenezer Scrooge from ""A Christmas Carol"" (1938) and made nearly 100 films including ""Mary Poppins"" (1964) and ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"" (1971).

Elizabeth Allen plays Lucy Manette, the object of the affection of Carton and Darnay. Her beauty is haunting and her sincerity is heart-felt. She made nearly 50 films in the UK and the US. She's not well known to US audiences because she returned to the UK after a contract dispute with MGM in 1938.

Edna May Oliver is a hoot, as always. She plays Miss Pross with sufficient droll humor and tart naughtiness to serve as the film's comic center. She starred in a series of mystery-comedy films as Miss Hildegarde Martha Withers, from 1932 to 1935, but is best known for her performance as the Red Queen in 1933's ""Alice in Wonderland"".

Donald Woods plays Charles Darney, but he's clearly overpowered by the other actors. Woods appeared in dozens of films without making much headway, turned to TV in the 50s where he stayed busy, and then retired in 1976.

At 2+ hours, the film is long, but Jack Conway's direction keeps it moving, as he did with several other long films (e.g., ""Viva Villa"" in 1934, ""Northwest Passage"" in 1940). Conway was a prolific director (over 100 films) who started out as an actor but decided directing was for him when he was asked to wrestle a lion. He directed MGM's first talkie in 1928 (""Alias Jimmy Valentine"") and worked on ""Birth of a Nation"" (1915) as a second director. Conway could handle large crowd scenes, as he demonstrated in ""Viva Villa"" the previous year, and you see some great work in the storming of the Bastille scenes, the trial, and the guillotine scenes.

David O Selznick produced the film and it has all the pageantry and large cast that you expect from a Selznick film. Fresh off his successes at RKO (e.g., ""King Kong"" in 1933), Selznick came back to MGM in 1933 to pitch in while Thalberg was sick. In 1935 alone he produced ""David Copperfield"", ""Anna Karenina"" and ""Tale"", but Selznick was never easy to live with, and he formed his own production company and went on to produce such Oscar nominated classics as ""A Star is Born"" (1937),  ""Since You Went Away"" (1944) and ""Spellbound"" (1945) as well as winning the Oscar for ""Gone with the Wind"" (1939) and ""Rebecca"". In 1940 he won the Irving Thalberg Memorial Award.

The music from Herbert Stothart is excellent. It complements the action without drawing attention to itself. Stothart was good at his craft. He was Oscar nominated for 8 films (including ""Random Harvest"" with Colman) and won for ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939.

The film was nominated for Best Picture and Best Film Editing. It lost to ""The Great Ziegfeld"" (picture) and ""Anthony Adverse"" (editing). The New York Times said it was ""magic"" and called Colman's performance ""his ablest in years"".

The film is of interest to classic movie fans or to fans of Dickens' films. Standing by itself the film leaves a good deal to be desired. The editing leaves out portions of the book, and some of the jumps between scenes are startling. Moreover, this is not the best performance from any of the principals, nor is the lavishness of the production remarkable for a Selznick piece. As well, the shifting from one city to another (after all it is called ""A Tale of Two Cities"") is not distinct enough to give us the flavor of the novel. Nonetheless, it has a certain charm and visual appeal. Some of the small things are really appealing, like Basil Rathbone's attempts to stay pretty, the little guillotines that are given out as toys to children, the hot iron rod used to make a hot toddie really hot, etc.",1269734400,18,5679,4.751269035532995

426989,5,6301977750,"I watched this picture many years ago and was enthranced. I had read the novel in my teens and have always remembered it as it also caused a deep impression on me. Madame Defarge knitting before the guillotine, the long trial, the contrast between the chaotic France and the organised England... Happily one doesn't have to choose between them, but can equally enjoy both and mix them. For the book always explains you more about the characters, their wishes and motivations, but the images bring them alive, though some are always supressed from the novel. I am for the magic in pictures. Some have it, some don't. This certainly does. Tyrone Power would have made a great Darnay, and certainly a better oponent for Colman, who is superior in his role, than Donald Woods. Elizabeth Allan could have had a better part as her role remains quite superficial, but this also happens in the book. Edna May Oliver offers a thrilling duel in the last part. And if you don't know the story, don't let anybody tell you how it ends! A fantastic movie to enjoy.",1253145600,,1050,4.650537634408602

Don't worry about missing it though.  The films fairly gallops to its conclusion.  Ronald Colman is wonderful.  For those who see the 1937 version of ""A Christmas Carol"".

Watch out for any scenes where Colman is slightly inebriated - in spite of his reputation for correct and gentlemanly behaviour, he simply excels at these. Basard and Jerry provide first-class comic relief, and the seamstress - with only a few minutes of screen time - delivers one of the most moving performances I have seen.

However; if the book didn't enthrall me enough the 1935 movie absolutely glued me to this tale of heroism by an ordinary but incredible man. The ability exhibited in this movie to bring such vivid images to the screen like Madame Defarge knitting as royalties heads are lopped off are incredible. Add to that the scene when Ronald Coleman recites his ""It's a far, far better thing I do, ..., far better rest that I go to"". If you don't have tear jerking at your cheek I think perhaps you should join the Defarge knitting club. I shouldn't be surprised though with David O. Selznick at the helm of the production and John Conway directing. It is a masterpiece of a movie that I think even Dickens would have stamped his seal of approval on.

427066,5,6301977750,"The story of a family and a friendship in the French Revolution of 1789.

Based on the history novel of the great writer, Charles Dickens, who wrote ""Oliver Twist"" and ""A Christmas Carol"". Good script, and some likeable characters. A lively drama. A couple large-scale scenes.

The French Revolution was brought by: prior kings spending the country's money on wars, failed crops, starving peasants, hopelessness of renters farming for the wealthy, the seeming unconcern of many of the rich, and Judges favoring the rich over justice (all we need today is crop failures). Some 18,000 to 40,000 persons were executed by guillotine during the French Revolution. It meant death to have been a member of the ""uncaring"" rich, to be an aristocrat.

King Louis XVI married at 15-years-old, his wife of 14-years-old, Marie Antoinette. Marie Antoinette had been sent from Austria, all alone, at 14-years-old, leaving family and friends, to marry a young man she had never met. It is no wonder she turned to pleasures. They became king and queen at 20 and 19-years old. The king, himself, said ""We are too young to rule"".

Some revolutions start with good intent, such as democracy with land reform; giving hoarded land back to the peasants to farm and own. Then in the confusion, evil men struck, seized power, and formed a dictatorship. So in Russia, in World War I, 1917, Lenin and Stalin did not start the Russian Revolution. Rather, men who sought democracy, began the Russian Revolution, and were murdered by Stalin and Lenin, who then usurped power, lied, lied, lied, and oppressed the people. The French Revolution started with some good intent, but, out-of-control, lack-of-values, led to mob rule, and murder of innocent people. The French Revolution gave rise to Napoleon Bonaparte ten years later. Napoleon would lead over a million Frenchmen to their deaths in war. Napoleon saw 600,000 men die in his retreat from Moscow during the harsh winter war.

This film also comes in a 5 movie set, of black & white, 1930's films, with: ""Pride & Prejudice"" (excellent), ""David Copperfield"" (very good), ""Treasure Island"" (good), and ""Marie Antoinette"" (some interest with sadness) within ""Motion Picture Masterpieces Collection"".

The ""Scarlet Pimpernel""-1935 is an excellent film of this same subject, but much happier; starring Leslie Howard, who played Ashley Wilkes in ""Gone With the Wind"", and was a real-life spy in World War II; also starring the beautiful actress, Merle Oberon.

So I only feel inclined to comment the final words/thoughts of Sidney Carton as delivered by one of the best actors I've ever had the pleasure of watching. These few words uttered by a lesser actor would most likely have proved to be the ultimate kitsch,but Ronald Colman just drains his most versatile and beautiful voice of all its colour in order to reveal these words' sincerety and ultimate beauty.

427068,5,6301977750,"So many folks already know the plot and resolution to ""The Tale of Two Cities"", that a detailed review is unnecessary.  This may lessen the suspense but should not diminish the appreciation for this fine movie.  This is a well-done MGM classic from the old school.  TTC is set against the French Revolution of 1789, but the absence of French accents does not detract.  Neither does a ""Paris"" obviously shot on a Hollywood back lot. Ronald Colman is the lead and virtually carries the picture.  He plays a slacker of a London lawyer who clears a young Frenchman, Donald Woods, of trumped up charges.  Woods had moved to England to escape the treacherous atmosphere of smoldering Paris. Woods' uncle, played by Basil Rathbone, planted the fake charges.  BR is over the top as an effete, haughty, snobbish French aristocrat. That Colman and Woods are in love with the same young woman, Elizabeth Allen, is the crux of TTC.  Woods wins her hand but makes the mistake of returning to Paris-and is promptly thrown into the cooler and sentenced to death.  To prove his amour for Allen, Colman visits Woods in prison -and switches places on the waiting list for the guillotine!  The subrogation is completely believable, not maudlin in the least. TTC moves briskly; most will not notice the two-hour run time. Less time would have been inadequate for the involved plot. As it is, viewers should still watch TTC closely for fullest appreciation.  Some key scenes are brief! TTC is shot in beautiful black and white-perfect for the gloomy subject matter.  Why anyone would colorize-or remake! - this classic is a mystery. The original cannot be improved upon.  This reviewer was so impressed with the film, he bought the book, a perfect compliment/complement to any self-respecting movie.",1132444800,8,1778,4.926174496644295
427069,5,6301977750,"This is an epic film, adapted from Charles Dickens' book of the same name. It is, indeed, a tale of two cities, as the drama in the film swings back and forth between Paris and London. In Paris, France, the seeds of revolution are being sown. A secret underground is already at work, presided over by a Madame Defarge (Blanche Yurka), who, with her husband, runs a small wine shop. These unhappy citizens are seeking to end the tyranny of the aristocracy, whom they view as oppressors of the poor. The worst of the aristocracy is represented by the Marquis St. Evremonde (Basil Rathbone), an insufferable, effete aristocrat, who cares for no one but himself, much less for the starving masses outside his door, whom he considers to be less than dogs. There is a scene in the film that illustrates this quite aptly.

Meanwhile, one of the victims of the Marquis, Dr. Manette, an innocent man who has been imprisoned in the Bastille for the last eighteen years without benefit of trial, is finally released, a changed man who has lost touch with reality. Dr. Manette is reunited with his daughter, Lucie (Elizabeth Allen), who had thought that her father was dead. Under her love and nursing, he recovers a bit and together travel to England to resume their lives. It is on that voyage that they meet a fellow Frenchman, a young, handsome man who goes by the name of Charles Darnay. They do not know that he is the idealistic nephew of the despicable Marquis St. Evremonde.

Once in London, Lucie and Darnay have occasion to meet. Then, he is accused of treason, having been framed by an emissary of the Marquis. Represented at trial by a team of barristers, which includes Sydney Carton (Ronald Colman), a handsome, melancholy barrister with a penchant for drinking. It is at the trial that Carton makes the acquaintance of Lucie Manette, for whom he develops a deep and abiding secret love. Carton becomes a welcome and frequent visitor to the Manette home, where Lucie holds him in great esteem and considers him her greatest friend. Carton thrives under her attention. So, when she tells him that she is going to be marrying Charles Darnay, Carton simply  begins his downward spiral anew. Shortly after, Lucie becomes Mrs. Darnay. Later, Carton resumes his visits with Lucie, none the wiser of his feelings for her. Carton eventually settles for being a favorite of Lucie and Darnay's young daughter, who is watched over by Lucie's former nanny and companion, Miss Pross (Edna May Oliver).

When the revolution in France begins, all hell breaks looks, with Madame Defarge as its spokesperson. She now relentlessly knits shrouds for victims of the guillotine, as the aristocracy and anyone affiliated with them are sentenced to death by kangaroo courts presided over by ""citizens"".  Under false pretenses,  Darnay is lured back to France. Even though he knows that he is at risk, he goes, thinking that he will be helping his former tutor and friend, who has been arrested for having been employed by the Marquis St. Evremonde, the Marquis having long since been murdered. When Darnay arrives in Paris, he is arrested as a member of the aristocracy, despite having renounced his title long ago. He is imprisoned, and  his wife, daughter, father-in-law, Miss Pross, the family banker, and Sidney Carton, all go to Paris in hopes of helping him. Dr. Manette testifies on behalf of his son-in-law at  trial, and it looks as if Darnay may be set free, as the people seem persuaded by the eloquent plea of the man who spent eighteen years unjustly imprisoned in the Bastille. Then, an outraged Madame Defarge steps up to home plate. At Darnay's trial, she rallies her fellow citizens with her revolutionary rhetoric  and gets the verdict that she desires.

While Darnay awaits his turn at the guillotine,  Carton sees that there is something he can do to help his beloved Lucie. He can return Charles to her. He concocts a daring plan, so that instead of Darnay, the guillotine will meet with him, instead. It is one of the most memorable, redemptive self-sacrifices ever filmed. He also arranges for them to flee France immediately, as the by now insanely bloodthirsty Madame Defarge, aware that Darnay has a child, wants all the descendants of the Marquis St. Evremonde to make contact with the guillotine. Madame Defarge almost succeeds but for the fact that she runs into the formidable Miss Pross. The tangle between these two at the eleventh hour makes for one of the film's most memorable scenes.

This is a superlative film. The cast is stellar and gives performances that are exceptional. The two main standouts are Ronald Colman and Blanche Yurka. Ronald Colman gives a sensitive, restrained performance as Sidney Carlton, the lawyer on the skids, who finally has an opportunity to show his love for Lucie in a way that will be meaningful to her. Moreover, in portraying an attorney with a drinking problem, he does so with a deft subtlety, getting the point across without over doing it. His face shows a myriad of emotions, and  his suffering is etched on it, visible with every glance. His velvet voice, as always, keeps the viewer riveted to the screen.  Blanche Yurka gives a powerful and compelling performance as the commanding Madame Defarge, who goes over the deep end at the last.  Basil Rathbone is excellent as the cruel and narcissistic Marquis St. Evremonde, his every word and action dripping with contempt for the people of France. Of course, who could forget the indomitable Edna May Oliver, who has one of the most memorable scenes in the film, when Madame Defarge crosses her path at a most inopportune moment? The rest of the cast, too many to mention, individually contributes successfully to making this a worthy film, indeed. It should be in the personal collection of all those who appreciate vintage films. Bravo!",1125187200,76,5844,4.847542627883651

427073,5,6301977750,"I am a huge fan of A Tale Of Two Cities it's one of my favorite books and I have seen most of the adaptations on screen-- this is the BEST version to own in your collection.

It might not stick entirely to the story as much as the PBS Masterpiece Theatre version does but, with a good cast and a great dialouge that makes up for what the version from PBS lacks. Unlike the never-ending version this short version is all about love, family, honor, and war-- you get a chance to fall in love with the characters.

This has the best Darnay and Carton you'll fall in love with both of them. Especially Ronald Colman does a great job as Sdyney Carton you get more of an impression of his love unlike the other versions. Darnay also does a great job... But really it's Colman who does the greatest job.

I love this movie and if your a fan of classic movies done in a time when there was good acting, beautiful sets, and good-clean movies this is one is for you!  And if your A Tale of Two Cities Fan this is the best version for you to own!",1106870400,4,1035,4.108910891089109

427089,5,6301977750,"Having recently read the novel cover to cover, and falling madly in love with the character of Sydney Carton, I felt it was time to see MGM's take on the novel. So, I chose the 1935 version of A Tale Of Two Cities since I love the classics; and I hear that is rare for someone only seventeen! Anyways, Colman's performance of the beloved hopelessly and helplessly in love Carton, had me in happiness and romantic sympathy. I don't think I have ever been so emotionally shaken with any film like this one. It is a film that lays true enough to the novel, and to the characters. It is the best film adaption of the novel you can find, and the greatest performance of Sydney Carton you will ever hope to see. I raise a taost to Ronald Colman for his magnificence and grip on the character, and another toast to the entire film for keeping my eyes and mind on the story and its characters struggles in life and love, and the pursuit of self.",1082246400,7,937,4.299435028248587
427090,5,6301977750,"I've been on a Colman kick lately, thanks to a friend who is an ardent fan of his. So, I went to rent some movies, saw this one, and brought it home.
I'm a little funny about costume dramas. As a rule, I find them incredibly boring. But, I like Ronald (listening to him talk is almost worth watching a boring movie for), and I was pleasantly surprised with ""Marie Antoinette"", so I thought... I will try this one out.
The story was not only gripping, it was very emotionally powerful. I just don't cry over movies. Sometimes, I *almost* will - but with this one I just couldn't keep the tears back. It started when little Lucie started crying for her father and didn't stop from that point to the end of the movie. I knew what Sydney was going to do, and while waiting for him to do it, I dreaded the time when it would come and admired him. Sydney Carton is my hero of the day and will be forever enshrined in my hall of cinematic heroes. (Okay, so it was a book first, but I've never read the book.) He was so sweet to that poor seamstress, too.
Anyway, tears and emotion aside, this is a fascinating and terrifying glimpse into the bloody insanity of the French revolution and the terrible things that happened to the innocent right along with the guilty. Horrible proof of how a mob, once aroused, can be nearly impossible to stop. Basil Rathbone turns in a fabulous performance as the cold-hearted nobleman who can run down a child in the street and go on his way without blinking twice. Ronald Colman as the slightly sodden but thoroughly unselfish advocate. He can say so much with his eyes. The Christmas service scene was unbelieveably moving.
I fear I'm not making much sense. Let's say this film left a deep impression on me, definitely will be a favourite from now on. I recommend it highly.",1082073600,10,1803,4.4174174174174174
427091,5,6301977750,"Ronald Colman is Sydney Carton a London barrister. One man gives up his life so that another man may live during these turbulent times in France. However, the backdrop of this story takes center stage. The images of the Reign of Terror are haunting. This can be credited to Jacques Tourneur (director of CAT PEOPLE, I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE, OUT OF THE PAST, CURSE OF THE DEMON and WAR GODS OF THE DEEP) who worked on the Revolution sequences even though full directorial credit is given to Jack Conway. Jacques Tourneur was in fact hired by Producer David O. Selznick as production supervisor for these scenes. Mammoth sets of the Bastille were constructed as well as surrounding Parisian structures. Jacques Tourneur directed the frenetic scenes when the Bastille was stormed utilizing thousands of extras in an impressive but eerily emotional view of human suffering and loss of life. This is unforgettable and impressionable filmmaking.",1026604800,12,938,5.058064516129032
427092,5,6301977750,"Originally released for Christmas in 1935, this splendidly produced, atmospheric and magnificently acted film displayed M-G-M's flair for filming literary classics - DAVID COPPERFIELD was released earlier that year - with no expense spared; the storming of the Bastille sequence employed several thousand extras and was filmed on one of Hollywood's largest sets ever. Ronald Colman was intially reluctant to play the role of Sidney Carlton, that charming but dissolute lawyer who commits the ultimate self - sacrifice ...... It took great persuasion to make Colman shave off his trademark moustache for the role of Carlton, but he delivered more than likely his finest performance ( Later in his life, Colman admitted this was his personal favourite of all his roles ). Charles Dicken's stirring classic of seventeenth-century Paris and London and the events surrounding the French Revolution had been filmed as silents on four different occasions -twice each in Great Britain and America - this easily remains the definitive masterpiece. Under Jack Conway's meticulous direction, A TALE OF TWO CITIES offers memorable performances by a fine cast, including the marvelously hammy Blanche Yurka, frightening Lucille LaVerne, vinegary Edna May Oliver, despicable Basil Rathbone, eloquent Henry B. Walthall ( he was the ""Little Colonel"" in BIRTH OF A NATION ) and, in a radical change of pace, the dimunitive Isabel Jewell, as the pathetic seamstress who accompanies Colman to the place of his execution.",1017446400,41,1501,5.418803418803419
427093,5,6301977750,"This early version of Dickens novel was the film that David O. Selznick chose to produce for MGM before his gigantic production of ""Gone With The Wind."" The numerous versions that have followed fail to capture the grandeur and emotion this glorious black and white film portrays.  I've read all the customer reviews on Amazon and can't add much more to them. It is a shame that these classics aren't available yet on DVD.  One aspect of this production that has not been mentioned in any of the reviews on Amazon and I thought was worth a segment in the recent release of Disney's ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" special edition on DVD is the character actress Lucille La Verne.  She specialized in playing hags or old crones during her career and her performance in ""Tale Of Two Cities"" brought her to the attention of Walt Disney.  She was hired to voice the Queen and also voice and play the Witch.  Watching her performance in ""Tale"" today, you can see the witch of Snow White in the flesh.  I did some research on Ms. La Verne and found that shortly after her stint in ""Snow White"" she retired from film and voice overs and ran a bar in Culver City, California close to MGM Studios.

427095,4,6301977750,"than a lot of other movies, that's for sure! What a wonderful adaptation of Charles Dickens' ""A Tale of Two Cities"". Like so many of the great author's works, this story is crammed full of images famous outside of the work itself: Madame DeFarge and her incessant, malevolent knitting, Dr. Manet lost in his cobbling, Sydney Carton offering the ultimate love sacrifice. Ronald Colman gives a splendid performance as the world-weary Sydney, and looks surprisingly young without his trademark moustache. Among the good supporting cast, Edna May Oliver, as always, steals the show as the prim Miss Pross, chaperone to Lucie Manet, daughter of the unfortunate doctor held captive in the Bastille for half a lifetime.  Like all pre-GWTW Selznick pictures, the movie has an air of the antique about it (like ""David Copperfield"" and ""Little Women""), but for a story set in the distant past, that makes sense. It had been many years since I last saw this piece, and what surprised me were the excellently done mob scene when the French peasants charge the Bastille, and when Madame DeFarge denounces Charles Darney in the witness box. Usually, the only scene excerpted from ""A Tale of Two Cities"" is the last guillotine shot, but I think it's a disservice to the film to not show more of these other great scenes to a larger audience.
