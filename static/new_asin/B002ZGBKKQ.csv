All in all, this dvd feels very ""genuine""; it captures the spirit of being a kid and having fun, and doesn't feel overprocessed as if the goal is to sell you a product. I would trade all our other children's dvds in for just this one (well, except our other Hoy Lari Live in Concert dvd...).",1405987200,,445,4.186046511627907
