8569015,4,B00BIDMV8C,"This movie is based on a Japanese manga (cartoon serial novelization) and anime.  Basically, it is about how a young man adopts a child who is supposed to be his recently deceased grandfather's illegitimate child after no one in the family wants to care for her because of the embarrassment.

The cast is excellent and  the storyline is good.  It veers off from the manga and anime at the end and some parts of the film can be a bit vague...",1444348800,,441,4.407407407407407
