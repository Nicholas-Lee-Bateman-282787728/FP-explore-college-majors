8723937,3,B0119TA898,"This movie made me angry to see the way the poor orangutan was chased for three days and finally cruelly captured.  I've enjoyed the other movies by the Johnsons but this one left me disgusted.  Karma being what it is, Martin Johnson died in a plane crash not long after this final film.  The other parts of the movie cover their exploring the jungle of Boreno where we see rare monkeys, flying snakes and tree climbing fish.",1472342400,,425,4.4935064935064934
