My father was one of those troops, and he never forgot his ten-minute taste of caring food & coffee. He cherished this one-time experience; I thank God for all those wonderful folks that made it possible for him and so many others to receive a personal welcome at a time when the whole country was pretty shook up. Rural and small-town families made sure these soldiers had a real, home cooked and home baked meal. I hope you will enjoy this film greatly!",1471305600,,626,4.548672566371682

8103530,4,B000E0OBDS,"This is a very touching and inspirational film about an amazing all-volunteer program to support soldiers going off to war during WW2. During the war, nearly all the troop trains went through North Platte, NE and made a 10 minute stop.  The women there started serving goodies to the servicepeople on the train because they mistakenly thought some of their own home town boys were on a specific train shortly after the U.S. entered the war.  They kept at it and it became probably the largest volunteer effort of the war.

The film combines interviews/""confessionals"" (for those of you who watch reality TV) with some of the women who worked in the North Platte canteen back in the 1940s (some of these women are hilarious!) and some of the veterans who stopped there on the way to war with period photographs and information from historians.

The impetus for the movie was a reunion in which a dozen or so veterans who had spent 10 minutes on a train stop in the canteen came back to the town for a celebration of that time.  It was simply amazing how emotionally affected the veterans were by just a short period spent at the canteen.  Some of the men met young ladies, became pen pals and later married with having spent very little time together.  And one man found out his pen pal sweetheart was marrying another man and it so affected him he didn't marry until much later in life.

I was shocked by the huge number of servicemen and women who were served coffee, milk, cookies, donuts, sandwiches, birthday cakes, and inspiration -- up to 10,000 a day.  The volume of donations and the work that went into keeping the canteen going would be amazing for a large city but North Platte wasn't that large -- help came from a large surrounding area.

Volunteers came from towns all over the state and nearby states and brought staggering amounts of food during a period of rationing.  Health regulations aside, I don't think anything like this could or would be done in this day and age and if it were the goodies would come from a factory not be home baked.

If you are interested in history, particularly WW2 history, this is a film you should see.  It tells a story of a war support effort unlike any I had ever heard of.  This was definitely the greatest generation.",1305676800,7,2271,4.561576354679803
8103531,5,B000E0OBDS,"According to my father, who is a WWll veteran who passed through North Platte, Nebraska on August 11, 1943, THE CANTEEN SPIRIT was accurate in its portrayal of the events that took place at the canteen.  The materials used to present the DVD were actual pictures taken at that time. The interviews of the people who worked there tell the story of their war effort to make the ""boys"" feel special for the few minutes that they were there. The North Platte stop was impressive to the ""boys"" to find such generosity out in the middle of nowhere. My father recommends that you buy the DVD. It met his expectations.",1257724800,13,610,4.545454545454546
