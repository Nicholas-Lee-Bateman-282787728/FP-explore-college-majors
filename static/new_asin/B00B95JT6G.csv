8603317,4,B00B95JT6G,"Movie is in Mandarin with English subtitles.  Enjoyed this movie as the story was easy to understand and the fight scenes are pretty well choreographed.  Story is about a homeless guy who happens to bump into a well known assassin who has made a promise to all the bad clans that he's going to kill every clan after three years if they don't straighten out on the righteous path.  This assassin is the good guy and the bad clans that have to face him are the bad guys.  Each bad clan has the choice of either giving up the clan leader as a sacrifice for the clan, or the entire clan can be killed if the clan leader refuses to give himself to the assassin.  After bumping into the homeless young man, the assassin took a liking to him because the homeless guy doesn't care who the assassin is and he's not interested in the powers of highly trained kung-fu even though everyone else is afraid of this assassin and would love to have his powers.  Thus, the assassin decides to take this young man home and transfers his powers to him through palming, a method used by kung-fu artists to transfer energy (chi), similar to a plug and an outlet, from one master to another.  This homeless young man's name is Bastard because that's what his mother in the mountain called him.  One of the intriguing part of the story is that it seems everyone is mistakenly identifying him as someone else, someone who is a clan leader, a boyfriend, a son, a playboy, etc., someone he's not.  Everyone seems to think he's just either acting or may have forgotten about who he is even though his personality seem to be quite different than who they knew.  This guy is friendly, not very smart, not greedy for power, not a playboy, cares about people and not selfish.  So, what is going on?  Why the mistaken identity?",1523491200,,1795,4.45565749235474
8603318,3,B00B95JT6G,"From what I've read the reason Kuo Chue had duel roles in this movie was a pay back of sorts from Chang Cheh for excluding him (I have no idea why) from Two Champions of Shaolin. Chiang Sheng is the only Venom to appear in both (at this point Wei Pei had disappeared from Shaw Bros). Lo Mang, Chiang Sheng, and Lu Feng star in Two Champions while Kuo Chue and Sun Chein star in Ode to Gallantry with an appearance by Chiang Sheng. Of the 2 this is the lesser film. The action is very minimal until the end and even then the villains are just sprung on us so there's no emotional build up. Still a much watch for fans of Shaw Bros and the Venom guys. Just not one of the better efforts.",1519603200,,685,4.044117647058823
8603319,2,B00B95JT6G,Unless I misunderstand something about the Venom series. Or I missed Lo mang (Toad)  How can this be considered a Venom movie? Chiang Sheng (6th Venom) had barely a supporting role. Kuo Chue Or Ku Chu (Lizard) the main character of the movie does a fine job playing a dual role as look-alike characters.. A plot twist easily figured out. Lackluster fights given the fact that he has obtained Supreme powers. Just not utilized properly. Really not very good story. you still must watch just because it's a Shaw Brothers film just not one of Chang Cheh's best.,1518393600,,558,4.6938775510204085
8603320,2,B00B95JT6G,"Have seen many many Shaw Bros. movies starting when I was young. At the local Shaw Bros. theater I eagerly anticipated Cheng Pei Pei, Lo Lieh, Yueh Hua, Lily Ho and many others. However I understood there are limits to what you can do with a kung-fu movie and a bad kun-fu movie can be downright B-A-D. After awhile they are repetitive and stale. Sorry to say the Five Venom series are a case in point. The early ones were fun. Then  the later ones became artistic wannabes and quickly wear out their welcome. ""Ode to Gallantry"" is supposed to be one of the better ones. However I found it too preachy, too wordy and the fighting sequences terribly boring. Essentially after you have seen the first and second ""Five Venom"" movies you have seen them all.",1518307200,,753,4.4963503649635035
8603321,5,B00B95JT6G,"I have always loved Kung-Fu movies from the early 70's to early 80's.  This is especially so for movies directed by the late and great Chang Cheh.  Although I wish this movie was English dubbed or featured English subtitles, the action was great.  The picture quality was great as well.",1438819200,,286,4.68
