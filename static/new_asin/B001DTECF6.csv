3539271,4,B001DTECF6,"This isn't your typical YMAA DVD program. At 45 minutes, ""Xingyquan, - 12 Animals Kung Fu and Applications"" is more of an introduction and an overview then a comprehensive instructional program.

With that said, this DVD program (although an introduction and overview) is fascinating and informative. Of course no one is going to learn Xingyquan from this program alone. It should, however, prove helpful to students of Xingyquan as a reference, and for practicing basic stances, the five phases sequences, the 12 animals sequences - and for understanding basic 12 animal fighting applications. The more advanced material presented in this program - the 2 person sequences, the 5 Phases linking sequences, the Xingyquan sequence (and more advanced study) - will probably be too difficult to learn from a DVD format and require instruction from a qualified instructor or master.

For a more profound understanding of Xingychuan (aka Shape Mind Fist), DVD viewers are advised to consult the YMAA publication ""Xingyquan - Theory, Applications, Fighting Tactics and Spirit"". I haven't read the book, but based on reader's reviews it would seem that it provides detailed, step by step instruction of the material presented on the DVD and therefore should complement this program very nicely (and visa versa).

Personally, I'm enjoying this program because I find the style fascinating. I would recommend ""Xingyquan - 12 Animals Kung Fu and Applications"" to Xingyquan students of any level, and martial arts enthusiasts interested in learning about this unique ""internal"" style of kung fu.",1288569600,2,1583,5.349397590361446
3539272,5,B001DTECF6,"It's long been one of the ideals of Chinese martial arts that the animal kingdom is beauty incarnate in its balance and being true to its own nature. With each one of the animal forms demonstrated in this video, Dr. Yang shows us how mimicking the movements of animals can be a very effective form of exercise and self defense.

Each segment of the animal forms of Hsing I (xingyi) flows naturally like water down a hill from one animal to the next. From crane to tiger to dragon and all the other animals in between, this is a beautiful and strong adaptation of nature in human form.

If you've ever wanted to learn the animal forms, shy of having a sifu to instruct you, this is the best way you will find to learn the elegant and powerful forms of Hsing I.",1287360000,,759,4.300699300699301
3539273,3,B001DTECF6,"Okay, I'll admit that one of the first things I noticed when reading the back of the DVD cover was that the DVD was 45 minutes long.  The reason this stood out is because I'm so used to YMAA DVDs containing two and three hour programs.  Even with the shorter length, ""Xingyiquan: Twelve Animals Kung Fu and Applications"" with Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming and Master Liang, Shou-Yu is an informative and well produced DVD reference on this Chinese internal martial art that can be translated to ""Shape-Mind Fist.""

The program begins with an introduction explaining what Xingyiquan is and some basics regarding the history and art.  This is taught with a voice over and subtitles and you see demonstrations of movements without instruction and some charts to illustrate points.  This brief introduction also points out that this DVD accompanies the book Xingyiquan by Master Liang, Shou-Yi and Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming.  While the DVD provides good information, using it with the text will provide a much more complete understanding of this art.

The program progresses in the same way, with a voice over explaining certain movements and concepts and on the screen mainly students demonstrating.  While the program and book were written by Dr. Yang and Master Liang, Dr. Yang does not appear in the DVD except for some still photographs near the end.  Master Liang is shown in some scenes demonstrating certain movements, but he doesn't ""teach"" to the camera.  The only speaking is done through the voice over, and the program is demonstration, not instruction.

A person is not going to learn Xingyiquan from this DVD.  It is however, a good demonstration of the art.  Fundamental postures, explanations of the postures and their relationship to the Five Elements, two -person Five Phases Matching exercise and Linking sequences are demonstrated.  Movements based on the twelve animals; Dragon, Tiger, Monkey, Horse, Water Lizard, Chicken, Harrier, Swallow, Snake, Chinese Ostrich, Eagle, and Bear are demonstrated along with martial applications of the movements.

I see two groups of people who will find value in this DVD.  The first group are those who are learning this art and want an additional resource for home.  The book accompanied by this DVD would be good to review if you are already learning the art.  Again, you won't learn it from this DVD, but it will assist you if you are learning from a qualified instructor.  The second group would be people like myself.  I enjoyed learning a bit about the art and seeing the movements demonstrated for a better understanding of the art for my global perspective on martial arts as a whole.  I like to learn about all arts, and once in a while borrow things to include in my training which has the Korean art of Hapkido as its core.  I don't anticipate trying to learn how to perform these animal forms, but I enjoyed learning about them.  The video is a little slow to watch repeatedly, but I liked watching it to just find out more about this art.

It's a well produced DVD, but I think it has a limited audience.  You must enjoy learning about all martial arts like I do, or be a practitioner of Xingyiquan to gain value, and for deeper instruction and information you need the book that this DVD accompanies.  And to learn the art, you will need a qualified instructor.

3539274,3,B001DTECF6,"Xingyiquan or Shape-Mind Fist is modeled on the movements of the twelve animals, Dragon, Tiger, Monkey, Horse, Water Lizard, Chicken, Harrier (a hunting hound dog), Swallow, Snake, Chinese ostrich, Eagle and Bear.

Five Phases and descriptions of how they relate to the elements are demonstrated. A female student goes through the sequences in both directions, right and left, filmed from the front and behind. Next, a male student demonstrates the same sets.
You can follow along and practice having the fists and feet arrive at the same time. After the solo sets are show, double sets both standing and moving are demonstrated. Linking sequences to improve reaction speed and attack/counter attack skills are shown.
The end of the DVD demos the Xingyiquan sequence with each of the twelve animal forms. The Masters come in at the end to show the martial applications of each set.

A little added gem at the end of the series shows black and white stills of Master Yang, Jwing-Ming and Master Liang, Shou-Yu with arrows superimposed over the moves to show directional energy.
The price of the DVD is worth this alone.

My main practice has always been Yang style taiji. Just a few months ago, I began studies with a Xingyi teacher. ( I live too far from Boston to study with Master Yang).  A good practice routine, however, there is very little verbal instructions for the novice.

This DVD will be very helpful as I learn the forms and sets from a live teacher.",1285804800,,1463,4.812749003984064
3539275,4,B001DTECF6,"After watching  and enjoy Dr Yang's Five Animal Sports Qigong I was really happy to see this DVD. In a way I can see how the two are related but this one is a bit different.
It is not one of the dvds that you can learn by following along with the instructor. YMAA strongly recommends to use this dvd as companion. The instruction that the DVD lacks can be found in the book, which at the moment I do not have.
However, by itself the dvd still contains an incredible amount of information. I believe that with careful viewing one can follow it along and learn the 12 forms. I doubt, however, that a beginner would be able to get anything out of it. The forms are performed as a solo, in slow motion and regular speed. This will allow the student to learn and practice methodically. The performers are amazing! I really like the way they mastered the movement and perform it flawlessly (in my opinion, that is).
What I found incredibly interesting is the introductory material that contains the philosophy of the forms and the moves. IN this section you can also find some fundamental poses and some introductory material.
While I do understand the frustration of other reviewers, I recommend this DVD to all those Martial Artists who are ready to bring their knowledge and practice of the ""animal"" forms to a whole different (higher) level.",1285545600,,1339,4.579166666666667
3539276,2,B001DTECF6,"Extremely disappointing.  All most of the commentary is either introductory or theoretical.  None of the commentary is done by the persons doing the demonstration.  There are no pauses in the demonstration.

If you are expecting something useful from Liang Shou-Yu, you will also be severely disappointed.  He never speaks, and almost all of the demonstration is done by students.  His only demonstration is of the matching routine.

I gave it two stars instead of one, only because of the limited demonstration value.  Unfortunately, I will now have to spend hundreds of hours going frame by frame in order to dissect the movements.

And I'm sorry, but when you spend $40 buying a DVD, the ""you have to buy the book too"" excuse just doesn't fly.",1279756800,4,746,4.904
3539277,3,B001DTECF6,"Dr. Yang, Jwing Ming is a pretty familiar face in kung fu circles, but this was my first experience of his material outside of magazine articles.  I am actually pretty disappointed.  I wanted instruction in the basic forms and postures of hsing-i. Unfortunately, that was not provided here. Unlike the typical martial arts instruction video, there was almost no explanation at all of how to perform the techniques.  The video shows very clear demonstrations of the five elements, but with only very cursory descriptions. The video would really only work as a reminder to someone already studying. Since they are presented clearly and slowly, one could learn by imitation, but that would be very difficult.  The twelve animals are not presented, rather a combination form.  Similarly, linking forms are demonstrated but not explained in any way.  The videography is excellent and production quality is high, but the most important ingredient is missing - a master's instruction.  This video would be a good reference for a student of the art, but don't expect to learn anything if you're a novice without a lot of work with slow-mo and copying the movements.",1260921600,8,1157,5.057894736842106
3539278,5,B001DTECF6,"I was taught xing I xuan when I was 10 years old by my father.  His style is different than what is shown in this DVD.  This DVD complements what I know of xing I xuan.  Now I can practice two different styles.  This DVD displays the action in three speeds: slow mo, slow and regular.  Nothing beats a kong fu teacher if one is to learn kong fu but I am impressed with this DVD and will be buying other kong fu dvds from this company in the future.",1236038400,5,448,3.933333333333333
8294817,3,B001DTECF6,"Production quality is very good as is expected from YMAA. This is not the instructional type of DVD that one expects from YMAA. It is meant to be a companion to the book, which is okay except that the linking form as demonstrated (at a very fast pace) does not correspond to the description in their book. Confusing at best. Being disappointed with the content I would be hesitant to purchase further material from the YMAA. However if you live close enough to practice with one of the authors this is probably good complimentary material.",1452297600,,539,4.684210526315789

8294820,2,B001DTECF6,"While this DVD does offer a small introduction to the fascinating art of Xingyiquan it sadly does not live up to the levels of quality and depth that are associated with other YMAA titles. Most of the lower ratings given here on Amazon clearly illustrate the shortcomings so it is not necessary to reiterate them. In response to this production, and despite the fact that I am a huge fan of Dr Yang, those who are seeking DVD-based instruction on Xingyiquan would be far better served by the offering of Sifu Liu Xiaoling (from Wudanglongmen) - Xingyi Quan 5 Element Fists (available on Amazon) - which is a worthy equal to Dr Yang's Taijiquan DVDs.",1381104000,,649,4.6521739130434785

8294822,3,B001DTECF6,"The book and the dvd are meant to go together. It's a self taught introduction material on this martial art. If you want more background material on XINGYIQUAN, you might want to get a book by Robert W. Smith on XINGYIQUAN. Robert W. Smith wrote many books on Chinese and Japanese Martial Arts.
If you really want to learn a style of martial art, you might want to get every good book and dvd on the subject for research. Only you can further your own education. An instructor can only show you the basics of a martial art, the rest is up to you to perfect what you learned.

8294825,4,B001DTECF6,"An excellent introduction to the basics of Xingyuquan, featuring Liang, Shou-yu. Intended for a complete beginner, this DVD provides simple and concise information crucial to every student of the art. The menu is laid out in a clear and comprehensive manner, is easy to navigate, and provides subtitles in both English and Spanish.  The video angles are perfect, and the movements are repeated in both left and right directions, making most of the techniques relatively easy to absorb.

The introduction is pretty standard, providing a general history, and a basic overview. With the use of diagrams, we are introduced to the basics of the Chinese 5 element theory. Volumes have been written on the subject of the 5 element interaction, as the topic is very complex, and delves into the core of Taoist metaphysics. It can therefore be appreciated that the diagram is presented in a straightforward manner in its direct relation to the 5 basic fists of Xingyi, without any unnecessary sidetracking to muddle the focus of the program and strain the attention of the audience.

The posture sequence covers the standing stake exercises of Xingyi, going over the 3 basic postures, proper body alignment, and the typical standing time required for proper conditioning. Next, the fundamental 5 Phases are described in detail, including which element each technique belongs to, how they interact with one another, and their Qi Gong function.

The Five Phase Matching chapter deals with a two partner drill exercise similar to chi sao or tui shou in principle. Two partners drill continuous stationary and moving techniques in a predetermined sequence. One down side to this section, is that the movements are performed too quickly, and the individual movements are not explained. This makes the set vague, and difficult to follow. However, the companion book to this DVD covers the sequence in great detail.

Next, the 5 Phase Linking Sequence and the Xingyi form sequence offer two forms. The first is the very basic beginner form, putting the five basic element fists together, allowing the novice to develop proper jing, and explaining the Qi Gong function of each element. The second more complex form is a combination of the basic 5 element, and the 12 animal form, devised by Liang, Shou-Yu's instructor. The forms are repeated twice, each demonstrated clearly, and are both relatively easy to follow. The camera angle is perfectly trained, allowing the viewer to clearly follow the movements.

I was pleasantly surprised to see the 12 Animal Form applications. Each animal movement is performed by 2 students, and demonstrated by Master Liang first in slow motion to show the technique, then in fast motion to demonstrate the momentum. The only down side to this section, is that the two students had very similar (slim middle height) body types. It would have been more helpful to have a slim lightweight student perform the first example, followed by a more heavy-set individual, to demonstrate the difference in body mechanics.

The final section involved what looked like a slideshow of a free sparring session between Mas. Yang Jwing Ming and Mas. Liang. I find the purpose of this final section a bit vague. The photos were clearly intended for the companion book, and in my opinion are unable to convey as much meaning as the live video demonstrations in the previous sections. The DVD would perhaps have been better off with this final section left out.

As it stands, this DVD offers great material for a novice looking for an introduction to Xingyiquan and is for whatever reason unable to find an instructor, or for those who wish to have reference material for what they are currently studying in class. Another great release from YMMA.",1306454400,3,3747,5.0420032310177705
8294826,3,B001DTECF6,"This video was made by Master Liang Shou Yu in conjuction with Dr. Yang. Although Dr. Yang is in the video the primary focus is Master Liang. Even though Master Liang is said to be highly skilled I felt that his and his student's demonstrations of the techniques were very ""airy-fairy"", demonstrating very little intensity and power.",1304726400,,333,4.859649122807017
