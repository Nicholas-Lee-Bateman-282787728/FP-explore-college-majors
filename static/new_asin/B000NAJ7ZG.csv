2764007,5,B000NAJ7ZG,"I have ALL of the Turbo Jam videos and I love Chalene in general -- but this is one of my favorites. I was truly shocked how much the ball adds to the intensity of the workout. It is pretty hard! It will leave you feeling toned and worked out. While I am now in pretty good shape such that I do not use many of my old basic Turbo Jam videos, this is one that is tough enough to keep in my routine. It is a great advanced workout for the core; I can literally feel that my abs are tighter afterwards.",1283558400,3,499,3.854368932038835
2764008,5,B000NAJ7ZG,"This is a geat workout!  But be aware all you Turbo Jamers, this is much more difficult then any of the other DVD's.  I can pretty much breeze through the other DVD's, while this one left me panting and sore.  Of course, this is a good thing!

What I really like about this DVD is that it is so different from the other Turbo Jam workouts.  I really like Turbo Jam, but Jamers know that each DVD is pretty much the same; same movements just changed up a bit.  Also, sometimes I feel that each section is just a little too repetitive. Not so with this DVD. This was a refreshing change.  I like it!",1242345600,3,597,4.139130434782609
2764009,3,B000NAJ7ZG,"I just recently received this DVD did the workout and I can't believe I paid 42.99 for this, anybody know why this one was so expensive compared to her other workouts.  I did break a sweat, probabley will do it again.  I am big fan of her other DVD,s, I own 3 others.  Maybey I expected so much more for the price I paid, I guess I feel ripped off, this one is not as fun to do.  I would not recommend this DVD especially for the price you pay.",1240272000,3,444,3.9
2764010,5,B000NAJ7ZG,"I own most of the Turbo Jam videos, and today I did Total Body Blast for the first time and it was AMAZING! I love all of Chalene's videos, but this is the only one so far that has actually left my arms and shoulders feeling sore! I would have never known that a ball would make me work out even more than the weights! It's a longer workout, 60 minutes, but definitely worth every second!!! The entire 60 minutes are in intervals mixing cardio and abs, using the ball in every section, from warm-up to cool down!

Love it!!!!",1231459200,2,525,4.25
2764011,5,B000NAJ7ZG,"This workout is really great! I love how she works the ball in, some cardio, then ball work, back and forth. It is a 60 minute DVD, but really doesn't seem like it! It is a must to your Chalene Johnson collection. I wish she would do more DVD's with the ball.  The ball gives you a really good workout! The music is good. This is another one that I include in my favs. You will want to add it to your collection.",1226361600,2,412,3.963855421686747
2764012,5,B000NAJ7ZG,This is the hardest and most intense of the turbo jam DVDs i love this video it is way better than the other ball DVD because you use it the who time i definitely recommend this video you will get an incredible work out! It sculpts the shoulders and the abs with some lunges as well.,1224979200,4,283,4.071428571428571
2764013,4,B000NAJ7ZG,"This is a killer 60 minute workout which blasts calories from head to toe. Using the ball intensifies the work out, targeting your abs, buns and thighs and all problem areas. Using the ball has helped me develop good overall muscle tone for my entire body, and the evidence can be seen in just a week! The workout also targets and trains the Transverse abdominus muscles: The deep abdominal muscles, Tultifidus muscles: The back muscles that support the lumbar spine and the Quadratus lumborum muscles: The muscles of the lower back that maintain spinal and pelvic balance. 6o minutes looks like a long time but because Chalene makes it so much fun the time flies. I've been doing the workout for two weeks now and I've never felt or looked better. You will sweat more than any Turbo jam workout, guaranteed. I definitely recommend the total body blast DVD for anyone looking for a challenging workout that blasts fat. No matter what your fitness level, try it out and see the results.

2764014,5,B000NAJ7ZG,This workout is really fun! It's the best ball workout I've ever done and you feel like you've really worked out! Chalene makes it fun so time flies and you feel great!,1186963200,9,168,4.28125
2764015,4,B000NAJ7ZG,"This is a great, challenging ball workout.  If you're familiar with Chalene and Turbo Jam you'll appreciate how awesome and inspiring she is. ""Get on the Ball""  is different, obviously because you use a ball the entire workout, but also because it's not as dancey and party-like as Turbo Jam.  It is, however, entertaining and effective and never boring. A good deal of ab-work, quite a lot of lunges and shoulder sculpting moves.

If you're looking to get sculpted and sweat your tail off give it a try.",1178323200,9,504,4.693181818181818

8176460,5,B000NAJ7ZG,"I started doing ball workouts around 2000. I have not had a serious backache since. The warmups on some involve standing and moving the ball around with your arms which I find incredibly fun, but since that usually only lasts under five minutes which is not aerobic. Also I love barre workouts and my legs and butt look great now for a 59 year old woman that is 25lbs. overweight. (I was 40 lbs. overweight.) I tend to not like working my abs...which makes me look somewhat like an egg with slender strong glutes and legs. I love the turbo jam videos. I have arthritic knees now so I do low impact aerobics and mini trampoline workouts. Chalene always includes low impact options and I love her perky encouragement.
  I was looking for a workout that uses a stability ball for aerobics. Patrick has a few but after viewing them online I decided I'm not ready for those. I don't want to get hurt, takes too long to recover. This video fills the bill. Its a hard workout, so you burn calories. There are higher impact moves for younger exercisers, lower impact for people just starting or with bad knees. The workout is intense so I found myself wanting to do the ab intervals which is great for someone that is not wild about ab work. Nowadays when I do lunges I use the transfirmer in ramp position so I do them correctly.
  This workout is not boring or repetitious and it works your whole body while getting in aerobics for a full hour. Also the balance moves are great as are the stretches. FUN!",1392336000,3,1498,4.4363636363636365
8176461,5,B000NAJ7ZG,I have quite a few of Chalean's videos and I really like them. I decided to try this one because of the reviews. I'm so glad I did! The hour goes by quickly. I wasn't quite sure how the workout would go using a ball the entire time. It was awesome. I really like how she splits the time from working with the ball upright then going back down to the floor for ab work. It's a good break while still burning calories. :),1387411200,,419,4.0
8176462,4,B000NAJ7ZG,I do really like this DVD. It's an hour long and Chalene keeps you moving every minute of it. I work out a lot and wanted to get a new DVD that would make me sore. This workout didn't get me as sore as I would've liked but I'm still glad I got it because I still feel like I put in a good work out.,1381104000,,298,3.5303030303030303
8176463,5,B000NAJ7ZG,This is one of my favorite Chalene workouts!  I own almost all of her DVD's and this one is a killer.  I am sweating within the first 3 minutes and continue to sweat through the cool down.  Great job Chalene!,1358640000,,208,4.15
