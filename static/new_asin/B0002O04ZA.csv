8157169,3,B0002O04ZA,"""The Battle of Midway"" is one of the documentaries produced by Pegasus in ""The War File"" series. I am going to give it three stars despite clear indications that this documentary was made on a shoestring budget. It lacked expert military technical advice relating to the use of historically appropriate archival war footage and in identification of ships and aircraft. It used only very worn black and white archival battle footage when very good US Navy colour film of the Battle of Midway is available. I will explain these failings in greater detail but first I want to mention the positive features of this documentary.

The producers have done an excellent job of examining and explaining the course of an historic and very complex naval battle. They are also to be commended for examining the strategic reasons that led to the most important battle of the Pacific War and the reasons for the defeat that turned the tide against the previously victorious Japanese Navy.

The producers are to be highly commended for mentioning correctly that the carrier-launched Doolittle Raid on Japan on 18 April 1942 did more than boost American morale as many historians used to think. Although the damage to Japan was slight, the impact of the Doolittle Raid on the Japanese high command was so powerful that it threw Japan's Pacific strategy completely off balance. The admirals of Japan's navy had assured Emperor Hirohito that Japan's home islands would never be touched by American retaliation for Pearl Harbor. The red-faced admirals had failed to keep that pledge to their emperor. Securing Australia's isolation and surrender by blockade and bombing had been Japan's highest priority in the Pacific before Doolittle. Now that priority would be shared with an all out effort to destroy the carriers of the US Pacific Fleet. The Doolittle Raid would cause the Japanese to set in train simultaneously three widely separated major naval offensives, and breach the fundamental military principle of concentrating force to win battles.

The producers rightly assign to Allied code-breaking its vital role in reading the Japanese Navy's coded signal traffic and exposing crucial details of the Japanese plan to attack Midway to the Commander in Chief Pacific Fleet, Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, in time for him to set an ambush for the Japanese carriers as they approached Midway. In particular, the producers are to be commended for frankly acknowledging that the vital signal intelligence containing Admiral Yamamoto's plan to attack Midway Atoll was intercepted by the joint Australian-American Fleet Radio Unit, Melbourne, Australia (FRUMEL) and relayed to Commander Joe Rochefort's brilliant cryptanalysts at the Combat Intelligence Unit in Hawaii (also known as ""Station Hypo"") for deciphering. Unfortunately, credit for appreciating that the vital Yamamoto coded signal related to Midway is rarely given to Yeoman Bill Tremblay of FRUMEL. Wikipedia incorrectly attributes the vital intelligence concerning the Japanese attack on Midway as coming from Station CAST (Philippines) but that station no longer existed in May 1942. Its staff had been evacuated to Australia.

This documentary correctly acknowledges three critical blunders by the Japanese: (1) the Japanese Midway/Alaska plan was overly complex; (2) the Japanese assumed that the Americans would respond to the simultaneous Japanese offensives at Midway and Alaska as the Japanese wanted them to respond; and (3) the dispersal of the massive Japanese naval armada into five separate formations scattered over thousands of miles of ocean denied any one formation support from another formation when it ran into difficulty as happened to Japan's First Carrier Striking Force on 4 June 1942.

That having been said, it is necessary to point to some errors in ""The Battle of Midway"" that can probably be explained by researchers lacking technical knowledge of navy ships and aircraft. Errors of this kind can be overlooked in historical dramas but not military documentaries that are clearly aimed at viewers with an interest in military history.

The first error is the statement that USS Enterprise (CV-6) was launched before USS Yorktown (CV-5). Yorktown was launched before Enterprise and gave its name to the Yorktown Class of aircraft carrier.

The producers correctly acknowledge that the Battle of the Coral Sea was an important Allied strategic victory because it frustrated the Japanese plan to capture Port Moresby. The capture of Port Moresby carried a very high priority for the Japanese because it would provide the anchor for a string of Japanese bases stretching across the Pacific to Fiji and Samoa (Operation FS), and it was designed to isolate Australia, and thereby, deny the United States access to Australia as a major base for an American counter-offensive. The documentary fails to mention that Coral Sea almost certainly played an important role in the Japanese defeat at Midway. Admiral Yamamoto had intended to attack Midway Atoll and the US Pacific Fleet with the same six powerful fleet carriers that attacked Pearl Harbor. He foolishly allowed the fleet carriers Shokaku and Zuikaku to be diverted to cover the capture of Port Moresby in early May. The timing of the Port Moresby operation was not crucial, and it should have been postponed to a date after the Midway operation in June. This blunder cost the Japanese dearly. Bomb damage and aircraft losses suffered at Coral Sea deprived Admiral Yamamoto of Shokaku and Zuikaku for his attack on Midway Atoll which had to be undertaken with only four fleet carriers, and consequently, the margin of superiority over the American carriers at Midway (three) was significantly reduced by Coral Sea.

The documentary attributes to Admiral Yamamoto an intention to support his carrier attack on Midway Atoll with aircraft launched from captured Wake Island. I have never heard any suggestion of this kind before, and I believe that the distance between Wake and Midway would rule out any such land-based air support for the Japanese fleet at Midway. The distance between Wake and Midway is 1,380 miles (2,220 km). That distance is within the operational range of the Japanese Navy's Mitsubishi G3M (""Nell"") and G4M (""Betty"") bombers, but well outside the range of Zero fighter escorts.

The documentary pursues a false view that the flight decks of the four Japanese carriers were packed with bombers preparing to attack the American carriers when American SBD dive-bombers struck and destroyed the fleet carriers Akagi, Kaga, and Soryu. In fact, the flight decks of all four Japanese carriers had been cleared for the combat air patrol Zeros to land, refuel, rearm, and relaunch to combat low level American torpedo bomber attacks. There were no bombers on the decks of the three carriers when they received fatal American bomb strikes. The false picture of activity on the Japanese carrier flight decks appears to have arisen from an account of the battle by Commander Mitsuo Fuchida who appears to have been motivated by a desire to avoid an appearance that the Japanese carrier fleet had been thrown completely off balance by repeated American air attacks, as indeed it had been. See Fuchida and Okumiya:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Midway-The-Battle-that-Doomed-Japan-the-Japanese-Navy-s-Story/dp/1557504288/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Midway: The Battle that Doomed Japan, the Japanese Navy's Story</a>.

The lack of technical knowledge of aircraft is readily apparent from the clips of various kinds of aircraft inserted randomly to represent the famous Douglas Dauntless SBD dive-bombers that effectively won the battle for the Americans on 4 June 1942. Perhaps the worst ""howler"" is the voice-over description of the obsolete, heavily patched Vought SB2U Vindicator bombers taking off from Midway Atoll as ""fighters"".

Finally, I have to question the inexplicable failure in this documentary to use existing US Navy colour film depicting the Battle of Midway, and in particular, the excellent 16 millimetre coverage in colour of the Japanese attack on Midway Atoll on 4 June 1942 by the famous American director John Ford who was actually wounded during his filming of the attack. Other action scenes are shown in black and white aboard American carriers despite the fact that the same action scenes are available in colour. Overall, the quality of the archival black and white footage leaves much to be desired.

Better coverage of the battle itself, much of it in colour, can be found in the Discovery Channel documentary&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Battle-of-Midway-Documentary/dp/B00005Q64T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Battle of Midway - Documentary</a>&nbsp;which includes excellent computer graphics and interviews with men who flew the American warplanes at Midway, including the famous Lieutenant Commander Richard Halsey Best who participated in the sinking of two Japanese carriers at Midway - the Japanese flagship Akagi and the Hiryu.
