6230311,5,B00HW3L8FO,I love this book. I had already read it in paper back. I am replacing all my books that come out on Kindle. This book is very good. Keeps your interest.,1404864000,,152,3.935483870967742
6230312,5,B00HW3L8FO,It finally came on DVD and I bought it.  Been looking for it for years.  To me a classic film.,1403913600,,94,3.65
6230313,5,B00HW3L8FO,the film was a more coherent adaptation of the book.  very good entertainment,1403913600,,77,4.923076923076923
6230314,5,B00HW3L8FO,"Arthur Hailey's The Moneychangers is a wonderful soap opera that Ross Hunter produced in 1976. The picture and sound are magnificent. This was the era that the networks really spent money on casts too. The plot revolves around a bank, the employess, and the grab for power once the bank president gets cancer. Particular favorites in the cast are Anne Baxter 7 years before Hotel, A pre Dynasty Joan Collins, and in smaller roles, Virginia Grey, Barry Coe, and in an early role Marla Gibbs who played Florence on The Jeffersons. Any fan of 1970's television will enjoy this.",1402531200,5,574,4.808080808080808
6230315,4,B00HW3L8FO,"From a great mid seventies novel comes this adaption of The Moneychangers.
The mini series is a rather faithful adaption of a story about the banking industry, intertwining the powerful and the powerless.
Christopher Plummer is perfectly cast while Kirk Douglas is good, but his performance is not quite as muscular as the character called for. The story is rather dated, especially in these post crash days where it's obvious how much the banking industry cares about it's less wealthy clients.
My only complaint is the way the characters of Miles and Juanita were left hanging. The book gave these important individuals a bit of closure that was lacking in the adaption. With so much time, there really was no excuse.
Still, there's much to enjoy about this series. I've waited a long time to see the full version of this drama and it was worth it.",1402099200,,850,4.789115646258503
6230316,2,B00HW3L8FO,I remember when the book after which this movie is patterned came out.  The book was great and today the film is way too dated.,1401753600,,127,4.08
6230342,5,B00HW3L8FO,Loved it.  Great way to spend an afternoon.,1439510400,,43,4.375
6230343,5,B00HW3L8FO,I saw this movie when I was a teen and have been searching for it for years.  I still have the hardcover book.  Although the movie is a little dated it gives a little insight into the corporate structure and potential failings of the banking system.,1436832000,,249,4.391304347826087
6230344,5,B00HW3L8FO,Good keep it up,1435449600,,15,3.0
6230345,3,B00HW3L8FO,The series itself is great but its let down by the dreadful picture quality. Looks like the master was the same one used in 1976 and its been left to rot. Anyone after this show needs to buy the German Region 2 release Die Bankiers. Far superior quality and entirely English friendly. 3 stars for the US release- 5 for the German one,1434758400,,333,4.301587301587301
6230346,3,B00HW3L8FO,"This is a very good mini-series that aired in Spain in 1979.

It's a shame they did not restore it. The image is just average and the colors faded.",1434153600,,147,4.068965517241379
6230347,3,B00HW3L8FO,"Good, though dated miniseries.",1433030400,,30,6.75

6230349,5,B00HW3L8FO,Kirk Douglas is great in this movie.  Good inside look at the higher ups in banking.,1426809600,,84,4.25
6230350,5,B00HW3L8FO,"Loved it then, love it now.  Saw it originally many uears age and it holds up well and may be even more relevant today.",1426118400,,119,3.9583333333333335
6230351,5,B00HW3L8FO,good movie,1425254400,,10,4.5
6230385,5,B00HW3L8FO,"I remember this from the days when a mini series was an event.  I've wanted to see it again for many years and finally got this chance.  Flawless item,  thank you!",1424131200,,163,4.193548387096774
6230386,4,B00HW3L8FO,"A recent incident with my own major bank in which I as a depositor got trimmed for a withdrawal I didn't make (being that it happened way out in California where I've never been--the case is still pending at this writing) sent me first to Neflix, then here in search of this miniseries. Fortunately it's still around returned to its original 5-1/2 hour length--one other customer here points out that there have been pared-down versions of it over the years. Kirk Douglas and Christopher Plummer star as heirs-apparent for the position of president of a major bank due to the medical retirement of the last serving executive of the bank's founding family. Douglas plays Alex Vandervoort, an idealist who (would you believe?) is involved with a radical lawyer. Plummer is typecast as Roscoe Heywood, an aristocratic type we've seen before in ""Sound Of Music""--only Captain Von Trapp never had the skeletons in his closet that Heywood has. One side story is a low-income housing project whose funding Vandervoort's girlfriend has him gung ho on, while Plummer's character has a predictable quasi-elitist bias against it. Another side story is Tim Bottoms' character Miles Eastin, a branch teller supervisor who not only embezzles money from the bank, but tries to get one of his tellers Juanita Nunez framed for it. Percy Rodriguez plays an ex-cop director of security for the bank who uses Eastin once he's served his time in a sting operation against mob-run counterfeiters, some of whom he met while ""inside"". Which there's nothing wrong with--police often find ex-cons with underworld connections a useful resource in that way. But he crosses the line when he uses an innocent--Nunez--as a pipeline between himself and the undercover Eastin. Which makes Rodrigues' character in a way more complex than the headliners. On the one hand, he's the guy whose investigation of the embezzlement nails Eastin and clears Nunez, but then he turns around and exploits her as a secondary informant, endangering her and her pre-school daughter. Hopefully by the time this shows up here, my own personal ""bankmare"" will be solved.",1423353600,,2118,5.089080459770115
6230387,5,B00HW3L8FO,"I loved it, as I am a retired banker.",1420761600,,37,3.2222222222222223

6230390,4,B00HW3L8FO,"Very good stuff for the time.  Unintentionally mention of 6,000 as being ""Serious"" money.  ALso anticipating ""Easy Credit"" credit cards as an achilles heel for the banking industry.  Can't believe how many cast members are now dead or near-death.",1408060800,,246,5.256410256410256
6230391,5,B00HW3L8FO,"I had read this book several times.  Its one of my favorites.  I saw the listing for this mini-series while randomly surfing and my eyes lit up.  I had to have it and I had to see it.  I was just a little kid in 1976, so theres no chance I would have been allowed to watch it as it originally aired, had I even been interested in the subject matter at that time.

The mini-series follows the plots and subplots of the book closely.  I thought the themes brought up within were mostly timeless, and indeed some are more relevant now.  Bankers and corporations have gotten a lot more brazen these days. The fashions and hairstyles, alas, don't hold up quite as well.  It is, without a doubt, a snapshot of the mid-1970s.

There were a few things I found changed from the book, for those who haven't read it yet:

* The FMA/Forum East bank slowdown showdown had a different ending in the book.  Im disappointed in both the way they showed it in the mini-series and that they left a lot of loose ends there.
* Eastins story after he got out of prison was greatly simplified in several ways.  Juanitas role here was somewhat different, Eastins interactions at the Seven Seven Club and his moves to get closer to the core were different, and the final showdown was much different than I remember.

If youve read and enjoyed the book, I encourage seeing this mini-series.  It was certainly good to have the characters I knew and loved act out their passions.  If youve never read the book, I recommending doing that, then coming back for this DVD.  You can thank me later. :)",1406678400,,1568,4.411149825783972
6230392,5,B00HW3L8FO,"Many of the reviews posted here are ""spot-on"". This Mini-Series is my all time favorite! Paramount invited Arthur Hailey to see their adaptation and he was astounded as it was nearly exactly like his book. He told Paramount Television it was just as he envisioned it! Years later when I visited Los Angeles, I purposely went to see the twin black towers and hoped the orange rectangular sculpture was there... it was. I have waited 38 years to see this great television event again, in its entirety. Ross Hunter, the producer, worked his magic here again! Jim Lee",1406160000,4,563,4.755102040816326
6230393,5,B00HW3L8FO,Excellent reproduction of the original mini-series that originally aired back in the 1970's.  I wondered if this would ever be released as it was on television only once.  Absolutely top-notch performances by an all-star cast and the storyline was very close to Arthur Hailey's book.  Very inexpensive for hours of quality entertainment.,1405900800,,337,5.4423076923076925

8636682,5,B00HW3L8FO,This is a great movie. Somewhat out of date when they refer to salaries and stock option stuff but the intrigue and double crossing that takes place certainly relates to our current society.,1442361600,,190,4.787878787878788
8636683,5,B00HW3L8FO,"I saw this on tv  almost 40 years ago and was pleasantly surprises at how well it had held up over time. Several major actors in lead  roles ie:Kirk Douglas, Christopher Plummer plus a  captivating plot. This movie was also true to the book which often doesn't happen. I worked in the financial services industry too for over forty years so the movie was quite credible typical of the book's wonderful author Arthur Hailey.",1441324800,2,423,4.6891891891891895
