Michael Biehn delivers an outstanding performance in this movie, I personally feel that this movie is best to watch on HBO or Showtime more than a purchase.  Profanity scenes of rape & torture.

I'm almost positive that doomsday and films about nuclear destruction couldn't get any more disturbing and hopeless as this one. It is a perfect example of the lows humanity will go to when they're put in dangerous and potentially deadly situations.

Best movie I've seen in 2-years!!  Brief Plot (because too much to cover to give a thorough Plot description): WHAT IF.... Nuclear Bomb Blasts hit NYC... leaving it like Hiroshima/Chernobyl??  ...WHAT IF... the ""Lucky Ones"" died in the blast, and you were trapped in basement of your apartment building, with radiation slowly seeping in?? This movie (was already at the Theater, ..now coming to DVD) is so AMAZING and PROFOUND with all AMAZING Actors doing top-notch performances (including a few ""big-names"")!!!",1334188800,2,675,5.419047619047619
5056058,2,B007549W62,"I confess I did not like this story. It is marketed as a horror story, but I think a drama would be a better description.

What it is, is an unrelated small group of people manage to get in time into an atomic bomb shelter during a nuclear blast. The original plan is to wait out the nuclear blast. However, they get locked in by some scavengers and more importantly a few start to go crazy. I hope it is not a real image of people as I like to think in times of extreme danger people come together and do not go crazy like, for example, miners trapped in a mine or inmates in German Death camps. Overall, I think the story starts off very good, half way I was really enjoying it, but then it drifted off into pointlessness.

The characterizations itself are reasonable. The acting is good.

The filming and special effects are reasonable for such a movie.

I would, however, not see it again nor do I recommend it, mainly because I do not like the story.",1334016000,6,955,4.259668508287293
5056059,3,B007549W62,"With a slick production, and a admirable director behind the helm of this piece, I figured this was going to be one of the best of 2012.  Frontier(s) was brutal... it was of course a contrived story line, and nothing above competant acting, but showed tremendous potential as the sets were brooding, the effects were amazing, and it was ""no holds bar.""  IMHO this flick missed with its scripting.  Again, great sets, competant acting, but the first half of the film falls completely flat due to the ridiculous dialogue shared between the individuals who find themselves trapped together in an apartment basement.  For some reason, this seemed to detract a lot from the film for me.  Everything else, fairly average to above average.  I did really want to enjoy this film, as I had been looking forward to it for a year or so now, but for me, it did not live up to my ever growing expectations.  However I do want to note that the third act of the film is very well done and intense.  And I did really appreciate the gloomy ending.

What starts off as a tense situation quickly explodes into something much, much worse and everyone's views of each other change. This is not what I was expecting. I thought this would be more of a Sci-Fi type movie and what it was was a very disturbing look at what different people will do when pushed to the edge. For those that have seen the movie ""Blindness"" you will know what to expect.

If you want to see a apocalypse movie that is full of the morbid, desolate, and hopeless nature of such an event, then this a movie for you. No happy ending or savior devices here. It's a twisted, dark, and frightening look into what some people become when the world turns upside down.

It opens with a massive nuclear strike on a major city and the residents of this giant apartment building doing all they can to get somewhere safe. The land lord has a private bunker and the basement, but some of his tenants manage to force their way in before the building crumbles around them. There are some plot pieces that are left unanswered which was kind of annoying.. but they aren't what the movie is all about.

5056101,4,B007549W62,"After reading many of the reviews I have a problem with some of them.
As a babyboomer I watched this movie and it seemed altogether too real......The movie about the aftermath of a nuclear war The Day After this movie spoke to me loud to the point of horrors.....I did not find the end anticlimactic but too much of what could be. Those of us who grew up being trained to get  under our desks in grammar school should all realize this movie tries to explore what could happen in this microcosm of society in that horror of horrors.
Folk that seem to be products of a society easily break down as radiation sickness being restricted and having necessary survival rules imposed on them react to the situation.
I found too much truth in this movie I believe anyone who has been subjected negative politics and felt they had no option but to try to TOUGH it out.
I did as I had folk who depended on me for shelter food medical care and the other necessities of life so this movie hit home for me the horror of making decisions that are needed for survival in th face of horrors.
I truly think it is something that those of us who came after the ongoing immediate threat of nuclear war need to see and think about as that threat has not gone and is ever present.
I do not think the scenes portrayed in this movie are all that farfetched as primal beasts are lurking under all humans surface.",1485907200,5,1386,4.3307692307692305

People are trapped in the isolated room, and nobody can get out, but the armed army can invade in to arrest them and kill them. So they became more and more desperate and eager for food and water to survive longer.

5056121,4,B007549W62,"(3.5, really)  One benefit of being single (and quite available) is that I've ample time to indulge my penchant for post-apocalyptic nuclear Armageddon films far from the prying eyes of others (for the record, I also enjoy long walks on the beach).  On the sliding scale, positing DefCon 4 at the low end, and The Road (or, going back some, On the Beach) at the high end, I'd place this a bit above center.  If you liked 10 Cloverfield Lane, this might jive, although I'd give higher marks to that (excluded from consideration is the whole zombie trope, that IMHO has played itself out multiple times over.

What you get here is a film that sustains tension, if not entirely the suspense, for the duration, and that doesn't succumb to the panoply of cliches that are rife in films of this ilk. This isn't to say that it's going to knock Samuel Beckett's Endgame out of the literary cannon anytime soon.  However, there's something than cockroach infestation and people's inevitable descent into madness to the point of slitting each other's throats over the last can of pinto beans going on here.

Fantastic rendition of what COULD happen if some people in an apartment building all clammered into their landlord's bunker as bombs are falling an the end of the world is at hand.  That being said, if what happens in this movie is what COULD happen, let me never live in an apartment building that HAS a bunker like this, people like this, and let me blow my head off the second I see bombs dropping, as shown in the first scene in the movie.  You just have to see it.  There is NO review that can do it justice.  If you are a fan of post apocalyptic movies, it is a must see.  I AM.  And I was still shocked.

5056138,2,B007549W62,"[Moderate Spoilers] It took a couple of sittings, but I did finally watch this whole apocalyptic, claustrophobic film with its dark subject matter, almost unbearable at times, so much so that it may make you weary of watching another apocalyptic film anytime soon, albeit with respectable performances from Michael Biehn (""Terminator"") and Lauren German as ""Eva.""  A small group of tenants hole themselves up in their landlord's basement waiting out the apocalypse, then slowly implode as a group in their descent into urgency and madness.  You get the sense that these actors are doing the best with what little script they have to work with, but I just don't see the point (and apparently this is the best that cast member Rosanna Arquette's agent could get for her).  I mean, yes, the end of the world is supposed to be dreary, but there's no calculated balance here, barely any inspiration or hope for its characters, and an excruciatingly long 2-hour run time.  I'm also curious if the reviewers who praised it ever watched it again, because I feel that would take a concerted effort, with its ashen-faced and physically confined characters, some rapists, spewing sacrilege and greed, highlighted by scenes of dismemberment and defecation, with males generally depicted as animals who can't control their urges and women portrayed as their inferior and sometimes willing participants (maybe it's just me, but those aren't exactly movie-viewer-friendly scenes).  Its message seems to be that, in reality, there would be no real humanity in this scenario, that we're all headed for a ravine, no two ways about it.  Where's the characters' deliverance?  Not badly made, just too ominous and unpleasant, and I wouldn't watch it again and wouldn't recommend it, sorry.",1474416000,,1768,5.139372822299651
5056139,4,B007549W62,"Ironically, theres a reason the reviews are almost equally divided. If the intent of project was to make you feel like you're also going mad in the bunker, its a great success. However, i feel more like this thing just couldn't find its focus.

POSITIVES

Loved the score. It had me immediately on board with this. The opening scene as well. Two standout performances from the ladies, particularly rosanna arquette. The story has some of the most potential ive seen ever seen in this type of movie. Especially the second half! You think its going in a certain direction, but it quickly pulls a u turn and from there It gets very dark and some viewers may not be able to handle it, so be aware. I liked that this one had a bit longer of a run time than other films in the genre. I think it was much more justified, and increased the affect they were going for. I actually couldve used a bit more to further explore the characters as individuals and their journey to a dark place within themselves.

NEGATIVES , may contain spoilers

Aside from the ladies, the acting was sub par. Even from beihn. Ill say most of the blame falls on the direction, because ive seen some of these actors perform far better in other projects. I think the direction is the problem with just about everything i disliked. It feels like two or three different movies. The first half, a total fail for me, following the typical trapped in a bunker theme. Unlikable characters galore, arguing over food, a couple with relationship troubles, etc. Toss in the archetype tough guy who was prepared for the situation, and some unknown scientific experiments happening outside. The acting was terrible on top of a script that didn't flesh out the characters very much.
SPOILERS*******
then comes this odd transition where the unknown big brother/assumed government people come and take the kid. Shortly after a volunteer goes out, sees some very intriguing things, and as he gets discovered flees back to the bunker. From there i really expected it to follow a broader scoped story. Who are these people and what are they doing out there/we need to save this little girl. Oh how surprised i was when they are immediately sealed inside the bunker. From there its like they were planning on doing the above described story, but changed their mind and went all lord of the flies with it. Which i don't think the actors, writing, or director were equipped to take on in the proper way. Everything feels disjointed. It gets very dark and deep but theres still not enough depth to the characters. Which makes it hard to empathize and leaves you a little confused when they make some of their decisions. The last minutes and ending were ok with me but it didn't really feel like a payoff because, like i keep saying, the characters aren't deep or explored enough to make you care about their individual character archs.

NO SPOILERS**********

Though i see a lot more wrong with this than i do right, i still recommend it. Definitely if can watch it free. If you like the genre go ahead and rent. Its not a story that you see very often which adds an element of shock and unpredictability.",1473552000,,3150,4.626118067978533
5056140,2,B007549W62,"I was expecting something different from the other ""trapped in a bunker"" movies I've seen once we saw the soldiers near the beginning... but the movie never again explores who they are or what they are doing. After that the movie devolves into the same carbon copy of others of its kind, albeit with a better cast (a couple of them, anyway). The ending is the most underwhelming ending I've seen this year and pretty much ruined the rest of the movie for me. It kept me interested enough to finish but once I got to the end I felt like the whole experience was a waste of my time. The sad thing is there was a feeling itching at the back of my mind that I knew EXACTLY how the movie was going to end but I didn't want to believe that it was going to be that stupid and cliche.

I think that this movie not only for it's amazing quality and amazing actors, it is a scathing amd frightening depiction of what would happen during a nuclear war, and the afteath of survival. And it ain't pretty honey. Scared me so bad I had to research nuclear bombs, and statistics says it would take a hundred thousand years, just for nuclear half life, and no life would be able to survive the radiation of aftermath of fallout and beyond. Scary thought huh?! Ya, well it scared the living daylights right out of me. I was freaking out crying at one point with anxiety, but that's shows the incredible quality of the film makers. This movie is a roller coaster. I think that this is probably the scariest movie I've seen in a forever because it's so real, and so much of a possibility. After watching this I said 100,000 Hail Marys and I'm not even Catholic I just did it for good measure. I donated to UNICEF, and I rocked back and forth in a corner for about a month. Okay that's how scared you're going to be. And then the next day you're going to call up all your friends and your family and you're going to tell them all that you love them, even the distant relatives. Some of you will start trying to build your own bomb shelter, and start stacking food corner and hoarding it. I'm just saying these could be possible side effects of watching this movie and it's completely normal just go with it, you also might have a nervous twitch in one eye that's temporary... don't be worried. So for anybody who really likes the reality horror genre, put on a diaper, and then watch this because it's going to scare the poopsies right out of you.",1454112000,2,1706,4.419047619047619

5056186,3,B007549W62,"This movie does a very good job showing the ugly side of human nature.  Humans will easily turn on one another, especially when the cavalry isn't coming.  Think of how bad Katrina was... and that was with the knowledge that just over the horizon help was on the way.  Think more about Concentration Camp survivors... children killing their parents over a crust of bread... yeah, that bad.

Moving on from that I read a book recently that had a quote I thought was very applicable.  It goes something like, ""Everyone wants to keep what is theirs until the run out.  After that everyone become a very good Liberal and demands that others share with them.""  Most of the survivors were like that.  They all wanted someone else to provide from them... because they failed to provide for themselves.

So my pointless ramblings aside I found this movie as an in-between.  It wasn't bad... but it wasn't good either.  I didn't like the fact that >>SPOILER ALERT<< the little girl's storyline was left hanging.  Same with the government 'troops' that showed up early on... what was that about?  How did they get there that quickly?  Why would they risk radiation poisoning so early on (no radiation suit in the world will protect you that soon after a nuke)?  Why did they take children?  How did they get into the basement of a collapsed building?  So much was left up in the air that it really bothered me.",1451952000,7,1399,4.621951219512195
5056187,5,B007549W62,One of the most disturbing movies I've ever see. It chilled me to the bone to see humanity fall to such depraved behavior. This movie will will sick mark your soul.,1450656000,2,164,4.32258064516129
5056188,5,B007549W62,"The Divide is about a group of survivors who are stuck underground during a nuclear apocalypse, and they have to rely on each other to remain sane and make it out alive.  Unfortunately sane quickly turns into insane.

At first the story seems sort of rushed the way we see the characters heading for the underground storage area without any build-up or scenes of the destruction outside so we're left to guess what happened, and we're also supposed to feel that the one character, Michael Biehn, is the rational one in charge and in control even though the others take exception to his semi-bossy advice, routine and arrogance.  However it turns out that he's been lying, stealing and keeping/storing food for himself while the others aren't aware until later on, resulting in them turning on Michael, strapping him to a chair and torturing him until he reveals the combination to access the food room.

However before that a group of men wearing suits and masks with guns break into the area where everyone's staying, and they're not very friendly men I'm afraid so Michael and the other survivors have to fend for themselves and take them out!  After Michael and company win the fight, one of them dresses up as a masked man by putting on the uniform, leaves the room and investigates what's outside... and it turns out it's some kind of testing area where they experiment on people.  Gross!  I was hoping we'd see some of the outside world here but no, sadly not.  Instead we see bright hallways and the scientists eventually realizing one of them amongst the group is an outsider resulting in the guy quickly running back to the room with the other survivors, and the men with masks sealing the room shut so none of them can escape.

Now the story kicks in, and it's really gross because it involves chopping up dead people lying around and eating them (though we don't see the eating part).  At first the survivors work together as best they can, however most of them don't get along at all because at least half of them like to rape women, play truth or dare games such as who can courageously cut up dead bodies on the ground with an axe (while sick, it's not the worst thing in the world considering the conditions they're forced to persevere) and act extremely violent and wild.  The other half are the victims or the men too weak/timid to know how to defend themselves against the vicious group.  They're all stuck in the same rooms however, which is enticing from a storyline point of view.

While Michael's being tied up in the other room the whole time, it's a little strange that none of the others at least tried to see his point of view and attempted to free him.  I mean when you have people turning on each other, raping and enjoying it (poor Rosanna Arquette's character is the victim of several rape scenes, and her cries for them to stop are really graphic and believable so this movie is definitely hard to stomach on a few occasions) it could be argued that the Divide captures remarkably well what it's like to be secluded in a dark hopeless space and gradually losing your mind realizing that it's only a matter of time until men turn into animals when they realize there's no way out, which is the case here.  Then again I don't know how sorry I really feel for Rosanna.  One minute she's acting sleazy and sleeping around basically asking for a rough time and noticeably enjoying it, the next she's playing the victim by hiding and shaking.  You can't have it both ways.

Lauren German is the rational person of the group.  The only you really pull for because she's polite and quiet, and you feel sorry that she ended up stuck in the same room with all these crazy people.  Well so is Michael Biehn, but he's too tied up to help in any constructive way at the moment.  Perhaps he should have been freed early on so as to write him into the story more.  Just saying his character was too good to be pushed aside the way it was.  At least this opens the door for Lauren to be written into the script, and she's definitely a memorable character with her own worries of getting raped and tortured the same way as Rosanna which encourages her to approach the wild men with caution. She's also forced to be courageous which makes her character the best in the movie.  The movie sort of goes overboard with the men too and how they're presented almost looking like senseless weirdos who belong in a circus, but then again it also makes their actions unpredictable which is awesome.

Without spoiling what happens, Michael isn't such a selfish and ignorant person like everyone thinks.  I'm sure most viewers picked up on Michael being the sensible one early on however none of this is anything special as far as storytelling goes, but the story's so gripping (except the rushed parts in the very beginning), the acting's above normal (though occasionally has moments of weakness admittedly) and the atmosphere is so intense, that I think the Divide is a splendid film.  It's just too bad we don't see more of the outside world as I mention above.  Granted it's basically gone but it's always good to show some visuals so we know what's going on.  Highly recommended movie but the way these people act like encaged animals isn't going to please everyone, and the rape scenes are rather strong but oddly the movie shows them without any nudity which is difficult to pull off.",1445299200,,5394,4.589583333333334

In my opinion, is is just an excuse for poor imagination/writing ability. Atleast it was not an exact copy of another sci-fi film from the past. I had seen part of the film previously, but walked away from it because of the endless dog eat dog human drama that kept going on and on, without any real plot development. It had some originality, and has a little twist at the end, but I can't say it was a good movie just because of that. Basically the usual cabin fever scenario, complete with implausible game changers, and the usual cast of stereotypical personality types. Upon finishing it, I am so pissed, that a have to write a review. I sincerely feel ripped-off. I purchased a sci-fi, but got a dark gory version of friends.",1442793600,2,871,4.662337662337662

5056214,2,B007549W62,"Wow, Xavier Gens reduces humans to their basest, primal instincts in his tale of survivors of a nuclear attack in New York City.  Gens offers no explanation at all for the attack that begins the film.  Whos attacking us and why?  We never do find out.  All we know is a group of people rush to the basement of their apartment complex, which the building super Mickey (Michael Biehn), a former firefighter, has turned, into a bomb shelter.  The survivors include brothers Josh (Milo Ventimiglia) and Adrien and friend Bobby; Marilyn (Rosanna Arquette) and her young Daughter; and Eva (Lauren German) and her boyfriend Sam.

After the initial shock of the attack the will to survive begins to take over.  Mickey will not let anyone leave the basement for fear of the radiation fallout and things quickly become contentious within the group as they bicker over the next course of action and deal with sharing a small space.  Up to this point The Divide is moving nicely and even though theres virtually no development of any of the characters beyond the basics, you can see their attitudes adjust to the stress.

Gens derails the film when a handful of soldiers dressed in hazmat suits bust in the door, steal Marilyns daughter and attempt to kill the rest.  Somehow, they manage to kill several heavily armed and trained soldiersyeah right.  And then manage to figure how to outfit and utilize the high-tech suitsyeah right again.  Josh puts on the suit and leaves long enough to find that the enemywhoever in the Hell they may beare performing experiments.  An ID badge has a name that is Asian but is spelled out in English so go figure.  If Gens wasn't going to reveal who was behind the attack then why even include this in the film?  Its a clumsy break in the tone of the film.

Once locked in the shelter again the survivors fall apartfighting over dwindling resources, torturing and raping each other in a Lord of the Flies apocalyptic scenario.  Frankly I had lost interest.  The characters are all extremely unlikable and were given no reason to root for any of them.  Mickeys background of being a firefighter and having a family at the time of the 911 attacks is hinted but never developed.  There are some strong and intense performances, particularly from Biehn and Ventimiglia.  And Arquette is over-the-top crazy as the mom driven over the edge.  Too bad Gens didn't give us a reason to care about any of the characters.",1438387200,,2433,4.7156398104265405

Anyway, this film involves a group of individuals who end up in a basement shelter beneath an apartment building after the world melts down in a nuclear war.  Of course there are two women amongst a varied group of men ranging from the typical street grunge to an educated foreigner.  The shelter belongs to the controlling apartment supervisor (Michael Biehn) who does a knock-out job metering out rationed food and water daily to the survivors. Then it gets ugly as the days endlessly grind on, people bicker, sex becomes a focus, fights break out, and the U.S. pulls a good one by trying to annihilate the remaining survivors and not succeeding.  After so many die, the end is, well, the only likely possible result and it really didn't take me by surprise.  I think it was supposed to be a twist?  Not too sure if they pulled that off.  But it is intriguing.  If you are into apocalyptic films this is a good watch.  I would recommend it as the acting was excellent!",1434153600,4,1134,4.569306930693069

5056279,4,B007549W62,"As the music swells we open on a close-up of a tear being birthed by an eye in which we see a reflection of missiles falling on Manhattan.  As the point of view shifts we see nuclear explosions erupting all over the city.  I love me a good end of the world movie and Xavier Gens had me on the edge of my seat from the opening scene to the very end so I didn't wonder out loud why our heroine didn't go blind as she was looking directly at the blast.  This movie is a really fun ride in spite of its flaws.

The action starts with the panicked residents fleeing their apartments and further explosions as they're trying to escape which sends 8 to the basement where the super, Mickey, lives and where the nightmare unfolds.  Luckily for everyone Mickey is a bit psycho and has been planning for such an event in the years since 9-11 so he just happens to have a lot of food and weapons stockpiled.  Smoke `em if you got `em because it's going to be a long few weeks.  A lot of smoking takes place.

This could now go in a variety of directions.  ""The Road"" comes to mind; who will be the first to be dinner when the food ultimately does run out?  It's definitely not the special effects laden ""The Day After"" nor is it the solemn humanity and quiet death of ""On the Beach.""  Nope, it's a psycho-sexual horror movie as satisfying as any even if by the climatic end you realize you've been had.

As tempers begin to fray they can hear the building collapse on top of them and after a brief silence and a knock on their door, followed by banging , we see a torch welder cutting  through the steel door.

What comes through the door is a small group wearing hazmat suits.  A child is dragged from its mother's arms, something is squirted into her mouth and an injection with a hypodermic the size of a baseball bat goes into her neck.  She is loaded, screaming and crying into a body bag and removed.  Then the troopers go after the survivors who fight back.  Our survivors take out the two remaining storm troopers and tend to their wounded.

Wearing one of the hazmat suits one of the survivors opens the door and goes into the unknown.  He walks out not onto streets of destruction but into a biohazard like tunnel system made of hazmat  plastic.  Our survivor continues until he finds a lab and sees the children, shaved heads and eyebrows, taped eyes and tubes in their mouths.  Each are in their own stasis module.  A fight ensues with some of the troopers who discover he's an imposter and he takes them out and retreats back to the basement shelter.  We see the arc welders again at the door and someone screams ""They're coming back!""  Mickey says , ""No.  They're welding us in.""  This is high concept apocalypse after all.

Sharp, tight dialogue and a clever script keep us on edge as their options, patience, sanity and humanity run out faster than their food supplies as it is discovered Mickey has been keeping hidden his stash of food.  This plot point keeps them alive as they descend further into the depths of depravity.  After an hour and a half of madness our heroine is all that's left and she dons a hazmat suit, and descends into the septic tank where she finds another way out and climbs up covered in poo into a dead world.

And that's the problem.  Where are the hazmat guys and where and why and what was all that about.  Apparently it was a story arc that went nowhere and was just a gimmick to get a hazmat suit in the shelter so she could escape without ruining her pumps in poo water.  But really?  Compared to the disappointment of not having that story arc resolved it would seem that a better script would have had her make her way through the waist deep poo water without protection.  Her climbing up into a dead city would have created a stronger scene, put a period on that sentence and would have not left those of us with enough brain cells working to figure out that the whole hazmat deal was a gimmick to get that hazmat suit down there for her to use.  Considering how psycho Mickey was it wouldn't have been surprising were he to have one stashed there as well so that whole story arc seemed unnecessary.

None of this means the ride isn't a whole lot of fun and you can see the actors digging deep to perform their psychotic dance but you feel a little cheated because you really want to know who the hazmat guys were and what they were doing and that doesn't happen",1396656000,7,4403,4.329670329670329
5056280,5,B007549W62,"I found this film on the shelf just recently by accident and thought I'd try it.  Well in moments it was memorizing, no build up and in just seconds we are faced with the onslaught of a nuclear war on tenants in an apartment block - no time to think - just run for the basement and get to safety. Only some make it, and the superintendant/janitor of the apartment block shuts and bolts his basement door, cutting others off, and then the waiting begins.

It was fascinating to watch the very slow disintegration of the survivors mentality, as if it wasn't bad enough to be incarcerated in a basement with no windows and the sounds of war above, with apparently no food or water, and an angry Super who really didn't welcome the 'crowd' in his work area and private refuge, but then the realization that the survivors are slowly going mad.  I ended up waiting to see who was going to 'loose' it next and how, and that was nail biting, as all the time you feel desperately sorry for the weaker people, trying to survive with some of the dominant one's slowly banding together. The threat of violence erupting, feels just a whisper away.

You start to realize that the women are in a particularly dangerous situation, as it the men are starting to loose control, getting into arguments, some of look like they will end in violence and some do.  However, the mental disintegration is slow, and the tension mounts.  When they are invaded, temporarily by the outsiders, and one is kidnapped, and the mother is distraught, the atmosphere becomes increasingly menacing, not just in the basement, but what is going to happen if the 'invaders' come back.

Its chilling to discover, when one of the group make it out of the basement for a few minutes only to discover that the 'invaders' are experimenting on humans, and that's extremely sinister.  They then get sealed in the basement by the outsiders with several dead bodies, and the gruesome, but necessary task, of disposing of the bodies really seems to send most of the group over the edge and you see the signs of insanity emerging.  The treatment of one of the women by one of the insane guys is extremely harrowing to watch, and it just get worse and worse and you see the situation getting totally out of control with the extreme depravity of some of the group, and you are gripped by the fact that their madness is deepening.

The only person who appears to remain sane, does really well to keep out of trouble for most of the film, though one senses there is extreme danger throughout, but somehow this person keeps out of the limelight. The craziness continues to get worse as the insane guys become crueler and crueler and more people die in so called 'mishaps'. You feel they are reverting to the 'starving rat syndrome' when they'll all kill or eat each other to survive, but madness is their enemy, not starvation, as they have been plundering the Super's food store - so nutrition isn't the issue.

Eventually, just when things reach their crescendo of depravity, danger and extreme behavior, does the sane person win through, but in fact, surprisingly seals the fate of the remaining survivors, deliberately or accidently, they are shut in behind a coded locked door, and the survivor makes no attempt to help the others. That seemingly heartless act of self-survival plunges the escapee into yet another nightmare world of a totally destroyed world, without a safe atmosphere and surrounded by the remains of everything that has been vaporized, a world without hope. So the tantalizing hope of escape merely means the lone survivor finds in fact that there is no way to survive.

The film leaves your imagination knowing that in fact no one can escape the nuclear war, and its evitable that one way or other, everyone slowly dies. You don't see the sole survivor die but you know there is no way to survive in a world complete radiated and reduced to ash (presuming the air in the protective suit will indeed run out).

The first 30 or so minutes really lived up to my hope...then it went into some craziness about government people in radiation suits kidnapping kids, cutting out tongues, and never explained any of it. Really bad vehicle to set up the ending.

When the ""good guys"" had many, many chances to get rid of the ""bad guys,"" they didn't. They just let them keep on living--even when it threatened the good guys' lives.

This movie really could have been cut by a whole lot down to 90 minutes and would still be too long.

5056301,3,B007549W62,"""The Divide"" is one of those films that could easily be a play.  It takes place exclusively in a bomb shelter where several survivors have fled after a nuclear blast. The apartment tenants have no idea what happened, and they are largely at the mercy of the superintendent, Mickey (Michael Beihn). The survivors all have relationships with each other - some are failed at relationships like Eva (Lauren German) and Sam (Ivan Gonzalez), others are broken families like half-brothers Bobby (Michael Eklund) and Adrien (Ashton Holmes).  What starts out as merely survival unravels in a post-apocalyptic tale where there are no good guys, only survivors.

At first the team is united in survival and threatened only by their worst fears, but gradually that changes as the existential threat of outsiders becomes very real. Soldiers break into the room in biohazard suits and kidnap a child, representing the last hope of the survivors.  The survivors manage to fight them off and then even turn the tables for a little while; ""The Divide"" is notable in that many films of this type would leave the threat unseen off screen.  Here, ""The Divide"" shows you what's on the other side, and the knowledge only makes things that much worse.

The soldiers decide to weld the survivors in, and then things go from bad to awful. The group splits into two, the divide of the title, each side claiming a woman. They barter for food, water, electricity, and sex, and the imbalance between the two groups gradually turns into a rift as it becomes clear who has the upper hand. It's not long before Eva realizes that there is no hope for her when she finally decides to take her fate into her own hands.

There are no happy endings here; no heroes, no good guys - just bad guys, and worse guys, and they are always, always guys.  This is not a feel-good film.  It is a brooding insight into the awfulness of human nature at its worst. It's also a refreshingly zombie-free meditation on the horror of being alone with other people.",1369526400,4,2010,4.72

The tenants of a high-rise apartment complex escape the nuclear devastation by hiding out in a bomb shelter beneath the building, but hunger, fear, and paranoia soon begin to tear them apart. This new post-apocalyptic vision follows the same running theme of societal breakdown that is present in many of George Romero's early films, only it is taken through to a much nastier conclusion. Just as we have seen in DAY OF THE DEAD, the trapped survivors quickly descend into the darkest depths of depravity once the veil of civilization has been lifted. Although it is very strongly executed by FRONTIERE(S) director Xavier Gens, THE DIVIDE pushes too hard, making the actions of its characters intolerable to watch. Many tangents are created but then never fully explored, leaving a number of questions unanswered as the film attempts to pick a direction. The timing of events also comes into question considering how quickly things fall into chaos. Still, there is a power and intensity behind THE DIVIDE that borders on madness, giving it a nihilistic edge over other 'End of the World' thrillers.

5056325,2,B007549W62,"I didn't like this film and I regret that I bought it, for many reasons, not the least of which is that I was deceived by the image and teaser on the cover of the DVD.

I thought I was buying a SF film about survivors of a nuclear war trying to go on with their lifes. This film however is something diiferent. The original cataclysm is barely shown and is never explained - we never learn what exactly happened. The whole story is in fact a study in the slow but certain disappearance of all social order and even purely human reflexes amongst a group of people who are trapped in a cage without exit (an underground shelter) and with dwindling food and water supply...

The film is full of incredibly vulgar language - it seems that absolutely everybody speaks with the ""F"" bomb beginning every sentence. There are purely obscene moments of sexual nature (nothing to do with love-making). Excrements, menstrual blood, rotting bodies and swarming cockroaches, all play considerable role by moments. There are very graphic scenes of murder, rape and torture. In one word, this film has more in common with ""Saw"" franchise than with SF movies. This is most of the plot and of the scenario - and this film REALLY disgusted me.

I would rate this thing one star, if it was not for the last five minutes, which contain one pretty cruel but really intelligent twist, which I didn't see coming at all. I also must admit that actors did a rather good job and the cast is strong: Michael Biehn, Rosanna Arquette, Courtney B. Vance, Milo Ventimiglia and Ashton Holmes all did very well. It is however Lauren German (an actress I never heard about before), playing the main female role, who offers the best performance - she sure can act.

But other than the last five minutes, watching this film was for me personally a VERY unpleasant experience. My advice - avoid it, except if you really like films in which people torture, rape and murder other people in the middle of rotting bodies and crawling insects...",1354492800,12,2002,4.615168539325842

This movie is very intense and keeps your interest.  Residents of a building wind up in the basement after a nuclear attack with the maintenance man (Michael Biehn) who has fashioned a bomb shelter there and has power for lighting, a latrine, and food and water.  He calls the shots for a while until hazmat-suited people break into the basement room, and seize the little daughter of Rosanna Arquette.  They spirit her away and try to kill the remaining residents who fight back and kill two of them.  With a working hazmat suit, one of the guys ventures out of the room and sees strange experimental happenings along with the kidnapped daughter who is now inside a pod with her head shaved and a respirator/feeding tube.  We don't know if she is alive or not.  He is discovered, barely makes it back alive and the door to the basement is welded shut by these unknown ""others.""

They wear white hazmat suits or some type of gear and 'experiment' on people and they also want the americans dead- we don't get too find out much more than that.

5056341,4,B007549W62,"After hearing Michael Biehn talking about ""The Divide"" on the Adam Carolla podcast, I was compelled to check it out. I've been a big fan of post-apocalyptic/post-nuclear movies since the early '80s, but this is decidedly not the post-apocalypse I was hoping for.

The movie revolves around eight people who escape what appears to be a nuclear attack by hiding in the basement of their apartment building, until then solely occupied by the building's loner superintendent Mickey (Biehn). I say ""what appears to be"" because shortly after the cataclysm, someone comes knocking on the big steel door, attracted by the survivors' CB radio transmissions. In the movie's strangest and most illogical turn, armed men in rubber armor invade the shelter and are repelled by the survivors, but not before taking the only child hostage. (Which was sort of a relief, as the young actor's performance was almost painful to watch.) Later, one of the guys suits up and goes out to explore, and finds a labyrinth of lighted tunnels leading to more men in suits in a mobile laboratory. Who are they? Aliens? Military? Why are they taking children and what are they doing with them? After some gunfire and an implausible escape, this subplot is mostly forgotten.

Certainly, some of the characters do some depraved things, but that's who they are. And really, that seems to be the premise of the movie: When all bets are off, how low will we sink? We never really get to know any of the characters (most movies would feature an early ""introduction roundtable"" scene), but now that I think about it, I'm OK with that choice. I didn't really care to know anyone's backstory, and anything I needed to know was revealed gradually, either through subtle dialogue or, better yet, their actions. Although there are some clues (falling hair, facial pallor), you never get a good sense of how much time has passed between events.

Made on a low budget, the movie boasts some remarkable visual effects and interesting cinematography. One irritation was the looping (overdubbing) of the actors' voices, which tended to make most of the acting come across as bad, although it lent a surreal effect to Michael Eklund's (oh-so-disturbing) performance.

Despite its grueling nature and unrelenting savagery, I found ""The Divide"" very entertaining and thought-provoking, even if it was uneven and went off on too many tangents. The lesson I took from it was, ""If you see the two toughest guys in the fallout shelter maneuvering to divide the group and take over the food and water, kill them.""

If you like your post-apocalypse raw and unforgiving, give this a shot.",1347926400,,2631,4.9434389140271495
5056342,4,B007549W62,"The bomb/fallout shelter environment depicted in ""The Divide"" is graphically presented. Unexplained (plot weakness 4-star justification) intrusion by armed raiders raises everyone's violence level beyond paranoia, and beyond growing annoyance with short rations (the divide) and with tedium. But ""The Divide"" recalls issues discussed during the 1960s fallout shelter craze: ""Who is in and who is out?"" In The Great Recession's Wake IMO surviving homeowners surrounded by foreclosures face similar questions because the homeless often react badly to ""Go home!""",1346803200,,559,6.0
5056343,1,B007549W62,"The opening scenes for The Divide show us a firey nuclear hell unleashed on New York City, a mad dash to get out of a building, and finally we see a lucky few manage to force their way into a basement before the door is slammed shut. The stage has been set for what should be an interesting couple of hours. Maybe a dozen or so characters, seemingly a random bunch that just happened to make it into the same place at the same time.

Unfortunately The Divide quickly begins falling apart in many ways. First, within apparently a few days of the total nuclear destruction of New York City an (theoretically) US government agency of some sort has set up shop outside the basement door. This agency is not FEMA out to find survivors and ferry them to safety; no, armed with machine guns, they are out to confront survivors and take by force any children among them, then kill off any adults.

Although the sole child in the group is grabbed, injected, bagged, and wisked away from the group, the machine gun armed thugs in futuristic hazmat suits apparently have had almost no training in handling automatic weapons or finding and killing targets. What should have been meat on the table for these thugs turns into a catastrophic loss as they lose two of thier own, including weapons and the suits, for the loss of none of the survivors.

The survivors, as well as the audience, wonders what the heck was that all about? So one of them suits up and ventures out. What we find is that this government agency appears to be conducting some kind of disections, tests, or experiments on children. It is near impossible to figure out what they are doing exactly, but what ever it is, it is barbaric, making these government agents seem like some evil aliens from another world. Predictibly, the survivor's disguise doesn't hold up long and he makes a mad dash for the basement, dropping and leaving the machine gun along the way.

The government agency apparently decides that welding the door shut from the outside is the best way to keep the rats in the cage, so after this point in the story that door is never opened again. With all of the rats in a well sealed cage and limited supplies with no foreseeable way out, the survivors quickly degenerate into subhuman beings, driven by animal-like instincts and little regard for any kind of community spirit. We are shown torture (both physical and mental), and reapeated rape or attempted rape. Eventually this all leads to a predictable sole survivor who seems to be the one keeping a shred of humanity in an insane environment. This survivor's final act is to shed that last bit of regard for others and purposely abandon the last few to a horrible fate.

In the end, the viewer will feel both robbed and cheated. Robbed of two hours of life. Robbed of any explanation for the actions of the mysterious government agency. Cheated by the director's insistance on repeatedly having seeming rational characters make irrational decisions for no plausible reason. Granted, this does happen in real life from time to time, but almost every character in the film repeatedly makes gratuitously bad decisions. It is also hardly believable that a group of somewhat average people would degenerate so quickly into psychotic excuses for humans. If the basement was located in the bottom of Rikers Island prison instead of an average apartment building, this story in this movie might have been a bit more plausible.",1346371200,6,3448,4.72093023255814

I enjoyed the fact that the residents of the apartment building hiding out in the basement have no idea what is going on or why armageddon has arrived.  That is how most of us would really experience such an event.  The acting was solid throughout and production values were fine, but the movie lacks any kind of soul that the viewer can tap into for the ride, albeit an uncomfortable one.  Not that they are comparable films, but ""Testament"" has a very down-beat nuclear war theme, but the heart of the film was obvious and consistent.  This film lacks any real depth to enable the story and characters to be anchored to something the viewer cares about.  When you're done watching, you feel relieved that the ugliness these characters have shown each other over two hours is finished.

I am not a fan of this type movie because they seem to be very depressing and this was but it kept my interest nonetheless.  I wanted to turn it off yet I didn't.

This movie forces you to face the harsh reality of the human mind and how fragile it is. You also have to sit through some of the most unsettling scenes that would make prisoners cringe but AGAIN they are very realistic and most likely will happen to people in that situation. I was particularly affected by the character Marilyn played by Rosanna Arquette. This character's child was taking from her for government experiments, she was raped constantly, she was beaten, and torture til her death and every scene was extremely vivid. I don't advice anyone with a soft heart, a feminist, or religious a person to watch this. BEWARE!

5056350,1,B007549W62,"One star for the pleasant and mood-appropriate music throughout the movie. The plot (group of people trapped in confined space) has been done over and over in different settings, nothing new there. There are plenty of post-apocalyptic movies out there that are much, much better.

Honestly, you would think scriptwriters could learn how to use the internet, since it is fairly obvious they have no practical education in using a library. I have a number of problems with this film, most having to do with filmmakers completely ignoring anything resembling reality. (You can go to ready.gov to read about nuclear blast emergencies, and what to do in case of one)

***********Spoilers**************

1. If you were that close to the blast they watch, it's game over. The flash travels at the speed of light, the following blast wave travels at the speed of sound (approximately 768 mph). At the very least, they would have been blind. Yet, they make it to the basement with no ill effects. They never show a blast wave. Quite some time later the building falls without crashing through the basement.

2. They are fairly close to the blast. Accute radiation sickness kills in under 48 hours, depends on your level of exposure. They only show some signs of radiation sickness (bleeding gums and hair loss), what you would expect from someone a distance away from the blast site. They never show signs of nausea, they eat and eat and eat all through the movie. They never get infections, even the guy who gets shot. Based on the symptoms they DO show, 50% of them should have been dead within 4-6 weeks.

3. EMP. Ok, lets say their electrical equipment survives. Where, exactly, is the electricity they are using coming from?

4. They are worried about fallout but never close off the ventilation system. DUH

5. The people that come in and steal the little girl make no sense. When the guy goes out there, he does so to no purpose. They are then sealed in by the people outside. Completely pointless. If someone kidnaps a kid, shoot first, ask later.

6. At the end, why is the concrete building burning? Gasoline explodes, it is not a slow burn. You cannot use gasoline in a lamp. BTW, concrete DOES NOT BURN. That basement survived a nuclear blast, but went up like a dry wood building from less than a pop bottle of fuel in a lamp. Get real.

As for the characters in the movie, no one ever shows the least bit of ""good"" humanity, it is all about how people are selfish and weak, cowardly and cruel. Which is true to some extent, but I find it hard to believe out of a group of people, NONE would have any redeeming qualities AT ALL. (Or go nuts and try to kill everyone.) Even the one ""good"" character is just like the rest in the end.",1344038400,14,2735,4.576687116564417
5056351,3,B007549W62,"The first half hour of the movie was pretty boring to watch. It got more interesting once the survivors started turning on each other. But towards the end of the movie, the characters just randomly go insane. I get that they were slowly descending into madness, but they all seem to go completely crazy in an instant. Suddenly, they're protecting their enemies and killing their friends for no discernible reason whatsoever. I would have rated the movie higher if the characters' actions towards the end of the movie made any sense whatsoever. Still, the middle bloc of the movie is entertaining to watch. It's worth a rental, but I wouldn't buy it. I don't regret watching it, but it's not the kind of thing I'd bother watching more than once.",1343952000,2,744,4.730769230769231
5056352,5,B007549W62,"This movie succeeded at doing something few movies can do these days.  Something few people seem to care about.  Not much was laid out for the masses but a lot was laid out for those that can still think on their own.  Much like an old school good mystery, you were invited to both know a little about a lot of things then think it through.  Maybe the people giving bad reviews should learn a little and especially how to think by reading or watching some old mysteries.

Not saying this was a mystery movie by any stretch, just be prepared to think, reason, conclude and deduce.  It's not the challenge of 6th Sense because things are clear if you pay attention, but obviously many small hints were overlooked by people that reviewed it poorly.

My definition of a good book or movie is one that can leave me hungry for more, leave things hanging, not answer every question, not find closure.  Anything that fits that bill does the most wonderful thing.  It asks me to think  to create, to explain, to solve.  I just feel if you must have closure about everything you miss the point.  Go have a good meal and enough closure.  Read a book to stimulate your imagination, watch The Divide to stimulate the imagination.

I am going to toss out a lot of spoilers here and recommend you not read this review before seeing the movie.  If you look at many of the reviews, they point to plot flaws, unexplained events and the like.  I am going to try to explain some of those things in hopes people that see the movie and are on the edge of liking it might read this after and ""get it.""  Obviously a lot of people didn't.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SPOILER ALERT #1

Why didn't people show the effects of rad poisoning equally?  If you paid attention you would notice the most severely effected were also the people closest or even touched by or touching the 'invaders.'  What is going to be on the outside of a biohazard suit?  Enough said I hope.

SPOILER ALERT #2

Why did the invaders take the girl out but not anyone else?  Why were they then sealed in?  Recall the bird flu of a few years ago and the limited supply of vaccine.  Assuming the radiation was affecting a mega city like NYC, would there be enough Decontamination chambers and chemicals for the amount of people affected?  Doubtful.  Would you prefer the adults be treated or the children?  Bare in mind a child has a much higher chance of success than most adults as well.  Simple truth is they took the child because they couldn't help the rest.  Look at the ID tag when Josh went out.

SPOILER ALERT #3

Much like Lord of the Flies, there was a slow degeneration into depravity.  Some folks thought things were too graphic, too visceral.  I say it had to be on these levels to form the continuity required for the end.  If you saw the movie, imagine jumping past any of the events and ask yourself if you wouldn't have had more questions about why it ended the way it did.  I tried to just blot out one scene randomly and it weakens the end to do so.  All of the grit and dirt HAD to be there or the end is watered down.

SPOILER ALERT #4

I felt the characters were well defined by their actions and who needs to know their life history if their actions carry their definition?  You did need to know Mickey was a paranoid survivor of 9/11 and that he likely lost his family during that, but beyond that, the only things you needed were defined well enough.  Eva wasn't a nurse, but was a caring and gentle soul...shown throughout much of the movie.  Her bf was a lawyer, and a wimp...amply illustrated.  Josh and the others were typical NYC maybe even Bronx boys.  Brash, bold, loud, maybe stereotypical but there you are.  His half brother was something of a gentle soul as well, played the guitar and helped Eva to sleep some nights...spoken of if you listened.

SPOILER ALERT #5

Who cared what happened to the world outside?  In fact, my only complaint was the end when the survivor walked out.  It played to some of the empathy a good movie needs to generate, but not enough to have been worth it.  I didn't mind her getting out, it followed the thing with Mickey about the gun, etc...
But, I felt it would have been better and the movie better served to just have her face shown for a few moments.  You generate the empathy, but leave all those scrumptious unanswered questions.  And, much leeway for a sequel.

SPOILER ALERT #6

Why did the survivor turn on the others at the end and desert them?  Go from saint to sinner in an instant it seemed?  Consider the slow build, toss that as too weak.  Add the attempted rape, toss that, she was stronger than that even.  Add the forced mutilation, toss that, stronger mettle still.  Look at who she deserted then.  Mickey that really wanted to die and she knew that, understood it maybe before he did even.  Her bf that I think she knew couldn't handle what she knew she was going to find.  I knew he was going to be a mess from watching the way thing developed.  He was going to need a lot more psyche attention then he was likely going to get.  She knew that as well.  Better off dead than suffering the rest of his life where he had descended.  Maybe add her budding affection for the one that was killed, but leave it at that.
Simple fact is, she was the only one left that could leave that place and have any chance of surviving and holding on to any sanity.

5056353,4,B007549W62,"This film is not for everyone. It explores some of the  darker elements never dealt with in most disaster films. Quite a few people seem to have missed the point that it's a film about how people react during a crisis. There really are no cinematic heroes present (a refreshing change from the cliched filled majority of these movies) and the overall situation is given the right sense of dread. These people are alone, trapped in a basement and forced to deal with one another. The fact that some have been driven insane by what happened adds to the tension.

5056354,1,B007549W62,"I wasted two hours of my time so you don't have to. There is no way to sugar coat this, this movie is a waste of time. Slow moving most of the time, a total of 2 hours actual run time could have easily been condensed into a 20 minute short. Maybe that could have made it more watchable. You watch and watch and watch and wait for something interesting to happen, some sort of pay-off, but nothing.

Just about everything that could potentially have been interesting about the movie was touched very tangentially and then forgotten. On the plus side, it avoids some of predictable cliches found in movies in this genre. That could have saved the movie, except, nothing interesting happens. The suspense ends up being, not what is going to happen to the plot/characters next, but will something interesting happen eventually? The answer: it happened, it was the song playing over the closing credits.

There is no depth to the characters, no arc, no realistic progression or development. The film slowly devolved into random violence for the sake of violence.

The DVD extras are 1) audio commentary track with the director and some of the actors, and 2) 2 minute trailer for the movie. It has subtitles and it is 2.35 widescreen anamorphic.

The DVD packaging is nice, a standard case with a paper sleeve on top. The post-apocalyptic picture is just there as eye-candy, it has very little to do with this movie.",1342828800,2,1410,4.696356275303644

The outlier of the outside soldiers and what they are doing adds to my interest in this, and would certainly like to see a sequel. Kind of like 'Cube' was supposed to be a standalone, and fans got them to make two more! So, would certainly rent it to see if you like it enough to your permanent collection; I do not think I will be doing so, but will watch it again someday.",1341878400,,612,4.2844827586206895
5056356,2,B007549W62,"<strong>The Divide</strong> (Xavier Gens, 2011)

Full disclosure: this movie was proided to me free of charge by Amazon Vine.

While I was watching the movie, I was perusing the comments on the IMDB message boards. Divisive, those, indeed. And for the first one hundred seven minutes of this one hundred twelve minute movie, I was spending a bit of brainpower crafting impassioned responses to a number of those comments, defending these characters and their behavior, with illustrations from history (anyone who believes that humans wouldn't descend to the level of savages given an impending apocalypse needs to bone up on the last century).

And then came the last two sequences in the movie, and what I can only describe as the [censored for Amazon consumption] move to end all [censored for Amazon consumption] moves. It's a complete one-eighty for the character involved, it's absolutely senseless within the universe the movie has built, and it reminded me all too painfully of just why it is I can't stand Xavier Gens (<em>Frontier(s)</em>). I am unfamiliar with the screenwriting team of Mueller and Sheean (this was their first work), but given the rest of the film, I am totally willing to place the blame for that ending solely on Gens' head. (Because, you know, Hollywood NEVER reshoots endings.)

Plot: nine residents of an apartment building in New York City flee to the basement during an attack that (as far as we can tell) levels the city. Whether it is a nuclear attack or not is ireelevant, really; Mickey (<em>Terminator</em>'s Michael Biehn), the somewhat cracked urban-survivalist building super, is convinced it is, and seals them into his basement shelter. We'd be getting into spoiler territory if I told you what happens next, but let's say that after a handful of traumatic events, the survivors' psyches begin to be stripped down to their basest elements. If you were paying attention in the first bit, there should only be minor surprises for you (one character seems a touch more noble than you'd think he'd be, for example); the pleasure, if one can call it that, in watching this movie unfold is in seeing just how absurd the personality devolvement will become. (Here's a hint: it's a Xavier Gens movie.)

And while it relies just a little too much on stereotypes--the aggressive African-American man who is finally out from under the boot of white authority pitted against the redneck brothers, the stable, well-adjusted guy is a wimp unable to stand up for his girlfriend, blah blah blah, I was willing to forgive the movie all this because Mueller and Sheean were dancing around as much as they could within those stereotypes, giving us realistic, complex characters that might actually have you questioning whether they're stereotypes at all. That takes some doing, a lot of sitting around the table talking about what these characters would do, a lot of backstory, and not a little subtlety, and for the most part it works... right up until those final two sequences. Which will likely make you want to go to New York, brave the allegedly-radioactive dust, and kill everyone involved.

In other words: worth watching, but prepare yourself for a letdown. **",1341532800,,3195,4.996240601503759
5056357,4,B007549W62,"This movie was very entertaining.  Yes, I agree with most that there is no backstory to the characters, and that the movie does not explain more of who dropped the bombs or who the men in the suits were... but it was still a very chilling look at what could happen after the bombs fall, and the psychological effects of being couped up in a dark fallout shelter for a long period of time.  In short, it focuses on 2 basic, carnal instincts: sex and violence.  I will stop there.

Driving the point home was the musical score.  This was very well done.  It reminded me of the score of Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later and Sunshine.  The music adds to the feelings of the people who are trapped underground.

All in all, it was very entertaining and did the job, despite the fact there were story elements missing.",1341446400,,807,4.369127516778524
5056358,2,B007549W62,"Directed by Xavier Gens (who made his name with a horror ""Frontier(s)"" back in 2007) ""The Divide"" attempts to do two things at once. The film starts out as a post-apocalyptic thriller about a small group of survivors after a nuke attack on New York City; it also intends to be a psychological drama of these ""lucky"" people under the claustrophobic situations. The premise may remind us of Vincenzo Natali's psychological thriller ""Cube,"" in which scientific elements serve as a set-up for the story about the characters trapped in a small space.

The idea is good, if not very original. Unfortunately, the filmmakers failed to develop it into a compelling narrative. ""The Divide"" tries to be a grim, uncompromising thriller by repeatedly using graphic violence. Though I do not disagree with the idea itself, I still find it annoying and pointless when violence is the only thing the director seems interested in.

What is strange about ""The Divide"" is that no one in the film (and the filmmakers) seems to care the details of the situation. The film seems unaware of such things as water, air ventilation and radioactive matters that will affect the lives of the characters. The director seems only interested in how those survivors descend into a hellish condition, being deprived of last vestige of humanity.

By the time the film's thin story comes to the conclusion, I stopped caring what is going on inside of the basement, even though the film has a decent cast including Rosanna Arquette, Michael Biehn, Lauren German, Courtney B. Vance and Milo Ventimiglia. While watching this mess, I remembered that Rosanna Arquette was in ""Pulp Fiction,"" possibly the best film of the 1990s.

Now, you are definitely not going to get any warm and fuzzy feelings while watching this film. Parts of it are dark and very sad, but it's not gory. Oh bad stuff does happen, but at least the movie does not show every gruesome detail. In fact, I'm not sure why this film is categorized as ""horror."" Drama or sci-fi drama would be more fitting.

There are a few twists and turns that I definitely did not expect, which made the plot interesting. While there are several holes in the story and I found myself wanting to wring the neck of a few of the characters, the film is not simply a remake of something we've seen before. It won't win any oscars, but it's a great psychological thriller. A sort of Lord of the Flies in the aftermath of an undefined attack that takes place in the basement apartment of a crazy building supervisor.

This dosen't make it a bad movie to watch as far as acting quality and atmosphere are concerned, however, it dosen't offer us anything new over story lines either. It rips off the movies I've just mentioned, only the The Divide takes place in a basement the entire time, and the characters are very unlikable. The opening scenes show us New York city getting decimated by a barage of nuclear warheads. As the bombs are raining down, a lucky(or unlucky) few manage to make it into their apartment building's basement just in time to escape the blasts. From this point on you don't need a crystle ball or alot of forsight for that matter, to tell you that things are not going to work out very well for the surviving few, and will most likley end extremely violently.

5056362,2,B007549W62,"I'm a little late to the party for this review so I'll keep it short and sweet.  Apocalyptic thriller that takes itself far more serious than the casting director obviously did.  I mean, really?  He must have promised his old college roommates he'd get them into a movie some day.  Too bad for director Xavier Gens because he's got quite a knack for the technical aspects of film making.  Beautiful shots, nice use of sound, slick and stylish while keeping with the overall darkness of the plot... Just those dang actors!  Probably not totally their fault, they are being forced to play some of the most unlikable human survivors this side of... I don't know, that show Survivor maybe(never seen it, but heard bad things)?  So all in all what did the Divide teach me?  That if you were a miserable person before, surviving a nuclear attack certainly won't help brighten your outlook on things any(also be selective when running into shelters during emergencies, I know your life is at stake but-- these are the people you are most likely spending the rest of your life with!  It's okay to be picky).  I also learned that The Divide runs about 20 minutes too long(why must ALL movies be 2 hours now?  Even horror and romantic comedies?  Why?!), and learning is half the battle.  Pass.  *Quick aside.  For those on the look for something really sick and twisted-- this ain't it!  The film is hyped as being fairly depraved, and maybe to the casual moviegoer it is, but if you're a horror/cult cinema regular then there's nothing overly memorable in that department here.

This movie centers around despairing situations and how a group of people face these challenges. It sounds really good on paper to me, but this movie was too depressing for me. There was some sort of plot, but it did not flow or connect together, which really left me unsatisfied at the end of the movie. It's just scenes and scenes of depressing material that I could have done without.

5056365,2,B007549W62,"I really enjoy dark movies of various genres- horror, science fiction, drama, etc.  So I was eager to watch ""The Divide"",  which is from director Xavier Gens (who also directed ""Hitman"").  The movie did quite well on the film festival circuit, where it was nominated for best feature film at both the SXSW Festival and the Toronto After Dark Festival.  So this isn't supposed to be your standard late-night cable cheesy apocalyptic movie.

While the cast isn't full of A-list actors, there are quite a few you will likely recognize (namely Milo Ventimiglia, Michael Biehn, and Rosanna Arquette).  The plot involves a diverse group of people who are forced to hide out in an underground bunker after their city gets hit by a nuclear attack.  There is obviously quite a bit of conflict between the characters, as well as some external forces.  The confined people's behavior starts getting darker and darker, and there are some haunting occurrences down there.

While the movie is wonderfully shot and has solid acting and music, the plot just couldn't keep me interested.  The two hour running time felt long to me.  The movie also introduced a subplot involving other inhabitants about 20 minutes in, but never resolved it or explained it, which was annoying.  The final shot of the movie is haunting, but unfortunately, it did not make up for the rest of the movie.",1340582400,4,1366,4.865800865800866
5056366,2,B007549W62,"Just when you thought that things couldn't get any worse during an apocalypse, along comes The Divide to prove to you just how much more depressing things can be.  The Divide tell the story of a group of 9 people who are forced into a nuclear bomb shelter when a nuclear war breaks out in the world above them.  Among the group is Micky (played by Michael Beihen), the owner of the shelter, who is none to pleased with having to share his new residence and the supplies inside of it with the other people.  Micky barks orders, makes snide and racist comments, and generally acts like an ass to everyone else while the world outside can be heard being destroyed by explosions.  Micky eventually learns that treating everyone like a jerk is a bad way to form solidarity amongst a group of people.... unless you want them to be in solidarity against YOU.  He learns this lesson too late as the group becomes tired of his antics and revolts against him, taking him prisoner in his own ""home.""

From there, the remaining group members degenerate,  Morals begin to decay, despair at the likelihood that they'll never be saved starts to take it's toll, and living conditions become disgusting.  This results in a ""divide"" (probably the reason why the movie gets its name) between two factions of people.  They consist of those who are miserable and doing nothing, and those who are miserable and acting like degenerates.  The latter group hoards all of the food and supplies in an attempt to force the former group into joining them in their debauchery, which includes repeatedly raping one of the female survivors and acting like swine.  The whole situation continues to break down until there is a final confrontation between the two factions.

The movie does a great job of painting a bleak picture of what would obviously be a horrible situation.  The bunker is dark and uncomfortable.  The conditions become so bad that you can almost smell the stench building up through your screen.  Also, the acting is decent, and everyone is believable in their rolls.  However, the good aspects of this movie stop there.

Though the first 20 minutes or so are filled with a good amount of suspense and intrigue, the majority of the film is depressing and boring.  For over an hour and a half (the remained of this film), the audience is treated to multiple rapes, lude references, people deficating on the floor, whining, body dismemberment, and some very dull conversations.  While I understand that the director is trying to convey just how bad this situation is, 90+ minutes is way more than what is needed to make this point.  In fact, it actually becomes torturesome for the viewer to have to sit through much of this just to see the conclussion of the movie.  We are also treated to images of everyone suffering the affects of radiation poisoning and unsanitary condition, EXCEPT for the character of Eva (played by Lauren German) who seems to keep relatively clean, well-kept, and intact despite the lack of showers and exposure to radiation.  Why?  I don't know, but I think it might have something to do with the fact that she's cute.

The characters, though well-played by the actors, are two-dimensional at best.  We have hardly any backstory on them, and while it isn't always necessary to have long histories about each character, it is troublesome for this movie.  This is particularly true in the case of Michael Beihen's character.  He obviously has some deep-rooted hatered burning inside of him, but we never get to see why.  We get a glimps or two of some pictures of his life prior to the war, but nothing is ever explained about what happened to that life.  With no backstory and little of anything else, we are never given much of a reason to like any of the characters early on in the movie.  And as the show wears on, the few reasons we did have to like any of them are stripped away until all of them become deplorable.  By the time this movie is over, it's hard not to find yourself hoping to see all of them die.

There's also the case of the masked ""soldiers"" who invade the compound early on, and kidnap the youngest member of the group.  Did I forget to mention them?  Well, that's ok, because after they make their grand entrance a half-hour into the movie, the writers forgot about them, too.  This is a shame, as these individuals shake things in the bunker up quite nicely.  They break, grab a girl, shoot some rounds to scare the other survivors, and leave with the girl (still screaming) shoved into a plastic, biohazard bag.  Shortly after, the group attempts to see what's going on outside (and to rescue the hostaged girl) using a biohazard suit that taken from a soldier they killed during the altercation.  A man is sent outside, and he discovers a group of scientists/soldiers similar to the ones that attacked them conducting experiments, as well as an area where children (including the one who was kidnapped) are being kept in some type of suspended animation for an unknown purpose.  After the advernturer is chased back to the bunker, the door to the shelter is sealed shut.... and none of these things are ever dealt with again.  The soldiers... their ""lab"".... the children they've got locked away like lab rats.... all of this could've made this movie 100 times more interesting, but instead it is all forgotten and used as an excuse to have the bunker welded shut (a feat that could've easily been solved with a cave-in of the buildings above over the shelter without leaving as many unanswered questions or causing as much confussion).

Probably my worst complaint is the end of this movie.  The final five minutes feature a character making decisions that do not make any sense for them, and performing an escape attempt from the bunker that is so remarkably simple, everyone else inside looks dumber for not having thought of it sooner.

Overall, this movie had lots of potential, but eventually deteriorates into a waste of time.",1340236800,4,5971,4.711946050096339

OK, this movie has a strong cast, and adequate directing, my beef is with the story itself.  Watching humans devolve in stressful situations is interesting, gritty, and makes for a long lasting impression.  These kinds of movies make for supremely interesting water cooler talk.  See ""Blindness"" (based on the Nobel prize winning novel) for an excellent example.  The problem with this movie is inescapable plot holes and a horribly sad and depressing ending.  Two successful film making rules the makers of this film should have followed are:
1. If it doesn't add anything to the story and creates confusion and questions for the audience; don't put it in the film.  In this case some specially suited humans show up partway through the movie; obviously spending considerable cost and effort to first infiltrate and then lock in the survivors.  Why?  To what end?  They are never explained and serve no purpose in the film.
2. The ending has to have some shred of joy, hope, happiness or closure - this movie has none.  The heroin goes through increasingly painful struggles to stay alive to simply die a lonely and hopeless death without any explanation or closure ... the movie just abruptly ends without telling the whole tale.",1340150400,5,1330,4.914798206278027

5056381,2,B007549W62,"I admit it.  I don't like ugly movies.  Call me frivolous, accuse me of having as much depth as a puddle, I don't care.  When I watch a movie, it's not to have a mirror held up to human nature and see what dark, devious depths are reflected within.  I watch a movie to be entertained, to be taken away from the ills of the world.  The Divide is an UGLY movie; I felt the same way after watching it as I did after watching&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blindness/dp/B004SUDQ2M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blindness</a>:  disturbed, violated, depressed, haunted.  In fact, if you want a really fun movie night, watch the two movies back-to-back.  If you don't want to vomit and curl up in a fetal ball on bathroom floor afterwards, you're a much stronger person than I.

At the technical/artistic level, I can admire The Divide.  The story is strong (for the most part), compellingly told with bravura performances by all the actors; the setting is claustrophobic, with a disgustingly realistic art and prop design.  Other than a certain whoopsie in the plot, which introduced a rather nonsensical and never fully explained story element, we're moved along without a hitch as the film explores what it takes for humans to devolve into monsters.  The movie starts off with some sort of nuclear attack on some American city; we're never told who is behind the attack, though the characters have their own particular theories.  We watch as the tenants of an apartment building race downstairs to find shelter; only a few manage to push past the building manager guarding the door of an underground bunker before he locks the door in place.  And so the story begins.  How long will the food last?  What about the water?  How long before all the ingrained cultural behaviors, such as kindness, charity, consideration, break down and our inner animal behaviors, such as greed, envy, destruction, come out in force?  In the end, as the characters try to break free from what ultimately becomes a prison, the question becomes, Was surviving the nuclear blast a salvation?

For the most part the movie flows as we watch these nine people spiral downwards, losing the veneer civilization places upon them and becoming more base until, at the end, most aren't even recognizable as human beings.  We see the paranoia take hold, the despair grow, the utter resignation to their fate invade their bodies like cancer.  However, the movie takes an odd turn early on, introducing a ""What the heck was that about?"" plot point:  ***POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD*** A group of hazmat-attired men with guns and weird helmet-masks break into the bunker, examine and then abduct one of the characters, a little girl named Wendi, the daughter of Rosanna Arquette's character, Marilyn, and then try to kill the remaining characters.  The characters overcome the intruders, killing a couple of them, before once more locking themselves into the bunker.  Later, Josh, played by Milo Ventimiglia, puts on one of the hazmat suits and ventures out to find out what's going on.  What he finds is an airlock tube attached to the outside of the bunker's door and a lab staffed by more mystery hazmat-suited men... and Wendi, along with other children, shaved and with tubes sticking out of their mouths, comatose in isolation capsules.  Josh gets discovered and barely makes it back to the bunker alive, but instead of coming back in and wiping Josh and the others out, the mystery men weld the bunker door shut.  So now the survivors are well and truly trapped, and this is where the depravity begins.  We're never told who those mystery men are, what agency or even country they work for, or what the hell they were doing.  To me it seemed as though they only existed for their hazmat suits, which played a part in the movie's finale.  Otherwise, they served no reasonable purpose.  Also, the character played by Lauren German, Eva, must've had a secret cache of shampoo and soap, not to mention extra water:  As the other characters degenerate and deteriorate, growing pale and wan, developing dark circles underneath their eyes; as their greasy hair falls out from malnutrition and their gums bleed, as their skin and clothing become foul with dirt, grease, and bodily fluids, Eva remains relatively unscathed.  Her hair stays clean looking, her skin remains glowing; even her clothing stays decent.  It's only until near the very end that she shows signs of deprivation.  Frankly, if anyone should've inspired paranoia of food hoarding, it should've been Eva.

While I can admire the film, that doesn't mean I like it, and I don't.  Certainly, scenes from the movie haunt me; even now, as I write this, I can see bits of it playing out in my head.  And I hate that, because I don't want to carry that ugliness with me.  As I said before, I want to movies to uplift me, to delight me, to take me away from reality for a couple of hours so I can smile, laugh, and be ignorant of the world around me.  A world, I might add, which holds enough ugliness in it without needing any fictional window dressing.  I don't know what kind of person I'd become should I be involved in some sort of survival-of-the-fittest situation, but I know how others would change:  Some would become even greater than before, some would remain the same, while most would happily embrace the monster within as they gleefully gave in to their worst impulses.

However, The Divide just didn't do it for me. It focuses on what happens when people are locked in a small space together and lacks nuance in that treatment. It reminded me more of a hatchet horror film than the psychological thriller it wants to be. The Divide intentionally feels claustrophobic, but unfortunately it's equally cramped in its ability to challenge the viewer.

Nonetheless, the cast is superlative, each actor offering brave, committed performances that are remarkable.
Michael Biehn who has eluded ""star"" status despite his roles in megahits like ALIENS and TERMINATOR is brilliant as the building super who conditionally offers aid to his co-survivors.  There is an underlying sense of sadness to the former fireman who obviously suffered a deep personal loss on 9/11.  Rosanna Arquette is devastating as the mother whose loss of her daughter sends her spiralling into a sexual decadence that is overwhelming.  HEROES' Milo Ventimiglia is chilling and frightening as the sociopathic Josh, cruel, sadistic and barbaric.  A star-making turn for sure.  Richard Eklund as Bobby--OMG what a brutal performance!  A modern day Caligula who steals every scene he's in.  Then there's Lauren Germann as Eve, the supposed moral center of the group whose descent into cold self-centeredness is unfortunately realistic.  Ashton Holmes emerges as the most sympathetic character, who maintains a semblance of humanity.  Ivan Gonzales as nerdish Sam is a complex mix of cowardness and pent-up rage.  Even Courtney B.

I was pleasantly surprised to see Michael Biehn (TERMINATOR) in one of the prime roles and thought that might nudge this film up a notch on my enjoyment meter. Again, not so.

I also sincerely love post-apocalyptic films. How much so, you may ask? TANK GIRL is one of the films I enjoy. As is ZOMBIELAND, MAD MAX, and LOGAN'S RUN. Yup. I'm seriously into  them. So I sat down with this film hoping I might add it to my ""Dead Earth"" series (as I like to call them).

But ...the main thing that makes these other films ""work"" where THE DIVIDE failed was sympathetic characters, a decent script, and an ending that actually was an ending (or at least made some sense). THE DIVIDE just seems to end with no resolution. No understanding of what actually happened to the world above (which the characters in this movie venture out into and find themselves a part of some sort of post nuclear holocaust experiment).

I get that the producers/writers/directors were trying to show these people in a pressure cooker element (people of differing personalities and behaviors stuck in a basement together until they burst at their mental seams). But give us some empathy ...somewhere. When people started dying/killing off, I could've cared less. I was hoping they'd all die quickly so the movie would be over sooner. Seriously? Who cares if they were angry with this person or that person? I never knew any motivation behind anything anyone did. Why SHOULD I care?

We have the man who built the underground shelter (Michael Biehn) and the many people he is sheltering. The film shows how the group easily slips into several conflicts turning the shelter into an underground hell of abuse, violence and murder.

The actors are first rate - so are the sets, the direction, the makeup and the soundtrack.

But to me, the script could be slightly come compelling if the film did not focus so much on the violence. It is strange that some characters start immediately to act like they are in a street brawl.

Only reason I watched it was because I really liked Milo Ventimiglia in Heroes but take the worst episode of Heroes it's even better than this movie...
I don't know how they got money to make this movie? They probably only showed them the trailer which was way better than the movie and made it look like it had lots of action and was actually worth watching?
Didn't seem like the writers even make an effort. So many plot holes like location of bathroom, lack of any explanation of militarized science workers, etc. No background given on almost anyone except for the 9/11 firefighter so for the most part you didn't care if anyone lived or died and couldn't wait for all of them to actually since most were idiots and not the kind of people you would want to repopulate the world anyways!

5056404,3,B007549W62,"The horror of a nuclear holocaust is one of the things that horrifies every one of us. I know, most of us are afraid of the actual explosion, while some are afraid of the nuclear fall out that fallows (photos of the Japanese people stricken with radiation sickness is indeed horrifying) and most of us wonder how we are going to cope if indeed the world falls under a nuclear holocaust. Well, director Xavier Gens' ""The Divide"" attempts to take a look at what can happen to a group of survivors if such an attack does happen. His vision is not very pretty, and really, the film is a little hard to sit through.

The film begins during a nuclear assault on New York as seen through the eyes of Eva (Lauren German). Eva alongside a number of the apartment's tenants manage to join the `survivalist super' of the building, Mickey (Michael Biehn) into the basement-made up fall out shelter where he has stocked piled some food and water. Days past, and the folks begin to crack, panic and then remain or turn into what we can call like ""stock characters"" in a scenario like this-there is the guy who turns psycho (Milo Ventimiglia), the sensitive geek (Ashton Holmes), the imbalanced one (Michael Eklund), the mother (Rosanna Arquette), the French guy (Ivan Gonzales) and there is the shaky one (Courtney B. Vance). You know exactly where the film is headed--imagine a pressure cooker where different personalities and paranoia come together too close for comfort....

I guess the way to describe the themes tossed around by writers Karl Mueller and Eron Sheean are the likes of what we've seen in ""Lord of the Flies"" and ""Night of the Living Dead"". There is something to be said for a little ambiguity and maybe restraint that can make such themes work. The trick is having a build up that makes the characters grow within the viewers' perspective, and add a little more drama with powerful dialogue to get its points across. There is a commentary here that is all about human behavior and rather than doing it in a subtle, methodical manner, Gens opts to put everything in your face.

I know, what we see in ""The Divide"" is possible, but for some reason, finding different layers and dimensions in the script becomes such a chore because of the way the film is executed. Not really sure why, I know most of the characters are supposed to be something that was truly meant to be despised and their behavior is excruciating to watch. But I am not sure, I felt that the characters were empty and a little too exaggerated. Yeah, the direction did have some points where it seemed to display a credible character shift (example Eklund's scene to chop a dead body up and German's strong-willed realization of the desperate situation), but by then, most of the film has already been hampered by too much cartoonish interaction that all appears to be heavy-handed and perfunctory.

The film is violent, however, I have to say that because of the way it was structured, some scenes become a little `funny'. Josh and Bobby are genre characters and despite their scenes of depraved behavior, I find them quite ineffective and a little dull. Most of the other characters are either tortured physically and mentally but none was more humiliated as Rosanna Arquette's character Marilyn, as I could not believe the lengths of humiliation the actress exposed herself to. I mean, having a menstrual scene and a duct tape bra while being sexually abused should be unnerving, what is more sickening is what the character's state of mind would be to allow such things to happen to her. German is the strong-willed female who maintains her cool and she serves her part well; but frankly, the other characters such as Adrien and Sam feel like minor fillers because they were underutilized.

The direction by Gens have that dirty and grainy atmosphere to add a gritty feel around his shots. I also saw some Sam Raimi-inspired camerawork that looked kind of cool. I did feel that the direction relied on visuals and in trying to make things over-the-top, rather than developing the roots and core of the narrative. The film feels like it is all about looks and visual and aural manipulation--no ambiguity at all, it is as straight-forward as one can get. I guess while I appreciated the ambitions behind ""The Divide"", and admittedly, the first half of the film captured a solid sense of discomfort and paranoia among its characters. I questioned its shifts, and maybe it tried a little too hard, and then pulled itself back. There is a good film in ""The Divide"", but it comes up a little short.

The movie was intentionally shot with a lot of grain and dirt, so the dvd transfer is nothing special. The film was shot in a dark environment to add to its tone and mood. It is pretty bare-bones save for a commentary and trailers.",1337040000,2,4828,4.686320754716981
5056405,3,B007549W62,"The most important thing you need to focus on while watching The Divide is that it is a horror film which takes place against the setting of an end-of-the-world shocker piece.  None of us should expect laid back acting or mild mannered situations like sitting around and playing chess games all day.  Horror builds up the level of fear with the goal of performing an unexpected event later.

Zombie films are mild in nature compared to the situations presented in this film which involves real conscious humans obsessed with themselves in a life or death situation.  The plot of this film, forces me to give it a high rating because it certainly does not play out like any other film of this genre.  The number of unexpected events, that still do not cross the unspoken plausible technology barrier, make it a joy to watch again while thinking of what else could have happened in this film filled with undiscovered plot lines.

Michael Biehn plays the part of a building superintendent who thinks the basement is his domain.  He does a good job of grasping the psychological twists that his character must endure during The Divide.  His success in this role was affected by the other actors in the film which lead to my 3 star rating.

Lauren German plays the role of Eva in this film, The Divide.  She played her role very well with deep long stares and uplifting confidence.

The Divide was my first chance to see Courtney Vance perform in a major role.  He has a lot of potential which could make this movie be watched more in the future.

The other actors did a less than notable job and one of them is my least favorite.  You can only do so much to avoid his movies today.

The cinematography in this film was very good for the low light conditions.  Since the movie is shot in a bunker, you are left with few places to film due to the vast area without lighting.

In conclusion, The Divide UNRATED presented by Anchor Bay Films is actually an entertaining film best suited for a lazy Sunday afternoon.  The acting was sub-par for the emotion required by the story but that was only due to inexperience.  Horror and Sci-Fi fans should appreciate something in The Divide.  My only regret is not seeing this film on 1080P Blu-Ray because the low light photography loses a lot of detail in DVD format.",1336953600,2,2303,4.557177615571776
5056406,2,B007549W62,"I'm amazed at the movies that depict the results of a nuclear war and how they've changed over the years. In the past, during my childhood years, there was always a sense of hope and cooperation between survivors in those films. During my teen years we were treated to the terrifying glimpse of the reality of the results of this form of war. And now as I've grown older, it seems a new generation feels that man can not do anything but remain destructive and petty. Where has all the hope gone?

THE DIVIDE opens with a nuclear bomb going off while Eva (Lauren German) watches from the window in her high rise apartment. Her boyfriend grabs her arm and they rush off down the stairs hoping to find an escape. Instead when they get to the lobby, they find themselves nearly crushed as the tide of people come running back in to avoid the blast wave and, fortunately for them, they have the chance to join a few that have made it to a bomb shelter in the basement.

The shelter was kept up by the apartment building's super, Mickey (Michael Biehn). And Mickey now intends to rule this basement as he sees fit, sharing what he has with the rest but by with certain restrictions. Some of the people want to leave but Mickey explains to them that the dust from the bomb will make the chances of survival outside next to impossible. It's better to wait it out till things settle.

Tempers and egos flare as each person wants to make their own decisions, failing to take into consideration that simply opening the door could do them all in. The posturing of males wanes back and forth while Mickey still controls them all in his most unpleasant manner.

The psychological aspects of being alive but trapped in a shelter play out throughout this film offering us little hope in a world where people care about one another but would rather focus on themselves only. Eventually help does arrive or so it seems. Instead the protective suited armed group that enters doesn't aid all but just a little girl in their midst. When members of this group later try to find out what's going on, the military welds shut the door and leaves them to themselves. Will they release them later? Who knows?

Before that day can happen the group begins to change. Not only physically but mentally as well. Life among the living deteriorates and the basest behaviors are displayed among them all. It becomes a sad tale in a world where insane attitudes seem to rule.

I'm not averse to movies that depict the world as it is. But it seems that these days a younger generation seems to have no hope in mankind or the world we live in. We've gone from a world where a generation dreamed of reaching to the stars to a world where we accept defeat at the hands of bombs. A new generation of film makers seems to see the worst mankind has to offer and expects that to be the norm rather than the exception. Then again with the self absorbed youths of today perhaps they're on to something.

It may seem as if I've revealed quite a bit about this movie, but most of it could have been witnessed in the trailer. There is much more that happens and all of it depressing as Hell. to me that's not entertainment. I couldn't find much that I could recommend about this film unless none of the things mentioned bothers you. Director Xavier Gens also made the film FRONTIERS which many touted as the best film they'd seen in years. I found that movie to be more disturbing than entertaining as well. But if you liked that one my guess is you'll enjoy this as well. For all others, pass it by.",1336953600,3,3551,4.4371165644171775

Sure, this kind of movie has been done before on more than one occasion, but I dig the director and frankly, it just looked really good. And it was. The movie is incredibly visceral, dark, bloody, sadistic, everything you would expect to see if this were a real life scenario. Now, there was something that happened early on that frankly didn't quite work for me, it just seemed really out of place. But then it turned out that it was the only way it could make the fantastic ending work. So I'm a bit torn there. Also, there was the acting, which seemed really overdone at first but then really started to find its place. It's almost as if the characters were putting on facades when they first came together, but then spend enough time together and the real character comes out.

The reviewers who gave this low scores state that it is a depressing movie without hope or redeeming value.  It is true the movie has little to no hope in it, and it is a descent of the rational into madness. What else would you expect when a group of people lock themselves in a building basement after nuclear bombs go off? You will enjoy this movie if you go into it expecting to be disgusted and wanting to see a raw, no holds barred portrayal of humanity at its worst.

I have also collected many movies of all types, over 3,000, and have quite a strong stomach.  But I don't know how the actors were even induced to play out such depravity.  I was sickened and only finished watching (fast forwarding through many parts), because I was curious to find out what happened in the end -- which was also pointless, I might add.  I suppose if there is one lesson we can learn from this, it's the horror humans are capable of unleashing on each other under certain circumstances.  We shouldn't, for example, say that things like the Holocaust can't happen, as some ignorantly do.

5056411,2,B007549W62,"I gotta hand it to little known Director Xavier Gens...He got great performances from his skeleton crew cast in The Divide. Unfortunately, the vision that Gens had his cast acting out was a very pessimistic view of human emotion and behavior. So while the acting and direction were really good, the plot was so over the top with such unbelievable scenarios that it made the movie one of the worst I've seen all year.

Nuclear bombs are raining down on The City, and you hastily make your way down from your apartment flat to the basement of your complex. You arrive at the basement door just in time to stop the building super from locking himself into a shelter and you out. You make it into the shelter with about 7 or 8 other building tenants. And...you would have been better off letting the bombs get you. Because it turns out that the other people who were neighboring with you in the building are mostly insane, irrational and incapable of a decent moral thought.

What's that mean? Well just ask yourself: Would you like to be locked in a small shelter indefinitely in a group of almost a dozen with even just one person that was mostly insane, irrational and incapable of a decent moral thought? Let the inhumanities begin: Murder, torture, rape, mindless cruelty...just awful.

What!!!) in place of the nuclear bomb devastated apartment building, and the military unit running the lab are as hostile (no pun intended) as some of the nuts inside the shelter.

I will say that the decent acting and the suspense of what crazy, atrocity would happen next kept me watching. As I said earlier, the cast took their parts very seriously. But, I mean, for a small room of people to resort to a such violent,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mad-Max/dp/B003ZD9DUC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mad Max</a>&nbsp;dictatorship from practically the first shout of ""action"" by Director Gens was beyond extreme and completely unbelievable to me.

Wish I could give it two ratings. 5 stars for the acting which was top notch and a lesser rating for the depressing plot which left a few glaring holes--for me.

The opening scene of a nuclear attack on New York is all you need to set up a group of survivors stuck in the basement to await the fallout.  But the movie takes so many twists and turns I was dumbstruck.  I've never had a movie leave my jaw hanging as much as this one and still continue to surprise scene after scene.  In the end you are left with an ""I can't believe that just happened"" feeling.

What the movie was trying to do and what others seem to be missing, is set up what it would be like for people stuck in a basement experiencing the nuclear fallout.  How not only being cooped up in the basement with no hope for survival and all the psychological traps involved there, but also succumbing to the radiation of the blast and the toll that it took on the survivors.  This movie explores the what ifs of that scenario, one where there doesn't seem to be any hope for survival and yet they must all co-exist with one another.

Granted it is dark and takes turns you wonder if it would have happened in real life, but in the end you accept it for what it is because each group of survivors is made up of a different group of personalities, and thus all reactions change.  I would recommend this definitely if you are ready for a mind trip.  Definitely not for everyone, but definitely worth watching and is best to go in to this one completely blind to the plot.  It has that much more of an effect on the viewer when you know absolutely nothing.

And that is about the only positive thing I can say for the film. The following 2 hours is just mind numbingly dull as we watch the survivors of the initial blast yell, fight and in general be mean to each other. That's it, that is the whole story. 9 people argue and torture each other over food, over sex, over...well just about over anything and everything.

Apparently a nuclear armageddon turns most males into drunken bully frat boys, while most women sit around and stare at things. ""The Divide"" takes a promising cast and wastes them.

The super of the building, played by Michael Biehn, is a total jerk and is very nasty to the other survivors.  None of the survivors seem to get along and there is a whole lot of arguing and fighting that ensues.  Most of the characters are thoroughly unlikeable and this is a real weakness of the film.  How are we supposed to care what happens to the survivors if we don't like them?  Another thing I did not like was how the survivors immediately turned on each other almost as soon as they reached the bomb shelter.  It did not seem that people in that situation would immediately start fighting one another.  Wouldn't they at least bond a little in their confusion and fear following a nuclear attack?  Wouldn't they try to work together at first?  Finally, the government comes but its not the rescue the survivors hoped for.  Things get even worse and desperate and things get very ugly and brutal as the survivors get even more hopeless and desperate.  This is not the feel good movie that you want to enjoy with your family.  I knew that going into this and even enjoy movies that don't always go for a happy ending.

I liked that it showed a situation I had never seen before and I am glad I watched it. However, I would not put myself through that 2 hour, soul crushing hopelessness again.

I thought a lot of it was unrealistic. For instance, a basement is not indestructible and it's not air tight. Radiation would have gotten in regardless. The people were unbelievable as well. I don't think people would just sit by and let women get raped or let random people decide who lives and who dies. And if they do, then they deserve their fate. Nothing really put those 2 depraved men above anyone else except that they were strong enough to take control. I also don't understand why a gun was so important. There were plenty of other blunt objects and even an ax that would have done the same thing: threaten or kill the 2 men that took control. I swear these people had the worst decision making skills EVER.

I was a little disappointed that no explanation was ever given for anything. It's unknown who bombed the US and who the troops were that attacked them and kidnapped the child.

This film was extremely bleak. There was no heroism or good decision making or hope. It was just people bickering and then torturing each other and then accepting rape and violence as a part of their daily life. I expected the visuals to be little more extreme because it was unrated.

Those who are absolutely disgusted by the movie based on what they see and those who appreciate the movie for what it is.  I'll stump for the movie because the cast turns in believable performances of difficult roles; in particular Michael Beihn who is extraordinary as a complex and nuanced antagonist.

The movie begins at the end. The nuclear bomb goes off and the lucky few who made it to the basement of an apartment building were saved. The movie is not about why the bomb went off or what happens next but more about the degradation of the human mind when a group is placed in a small space with no hope and limited supplies. They have just enough supplies to last weeks but they lose their minds faster than they run out of food.

I was impressed by the acting and have to say, the movie was brutal, depressing and truly disturbing but that is what makes the movie so good. The actors made you believe they were truly out of their minds because the effect happened slowly throughout the movie. The movie was really long so you can really believe in the changes but it might turn some people off because their is only so much depravity and hopelessness one can take. Oh, And to the make up department? You guys deserve an Emmy for the transformations of these characters. This great aspect only matched by the convincing performances.

I did not enjoy watching this movie. That is why it is a complete success. It showed how humans can reach desperate lows and I have to move in the love it camp.

I'm not usually one for post-apocalyptic films as I often find them too depressing to watch so I wasn't expecting to really care for it but this film really blew me away.

This movie is dark. Dark, intense and very powerful. It's full of things we all fear but most of all it encompasses the depravity of human beings when put in a situation such as what befalls the characters in this film. The cover of the movie itself should be enough to tell you that this isn't going to be a happy film. Blood, violence and even a considerable amount of rape are all in this film and it's all done so very intensely! This film shows you the horrifying and frightening things people will do to each other in order to survive, when crammed into the basement of an apartment building. This movie didn't hold back. The characters didn't hold back.

Milo Ventimiglia's character of ""Josh"" was absolutely brilliant as was Lauren German who played ""Eva"". Ventimiglia's performance went above and beyond. The transformation that Josh goes through is just unbelievable and so very dark, that it left me really speechless. I have to say, this is probably Milo's best work yet.

The basement, besides being Mickey's residence, is a bomb shelter. Mickey has canned goods put back, mainly beans. The bathroom is like an old fashioned out-house and instructions are given to scoop lime through the hold after use.
In The Divide we feel like our survivors are within the three or four miles of the blast and therefore would suffer from radiation poisoning if they stepped outside.
After several days, the shelter's door is broken from the outside and armed soldiers in biohazard suits enter. We're not privy to why but they take Marilyn's daughter. The rest of the survivors are able to kill two of the men and get a machine gun.
More days pass. It's decided someone should go outside, wearing the untorn biohazard suit, to see how bad it is and to see if they can find the girl. They pick Josh, figuring he would come back because of his brother.
Josh finds tunnels attached to the basement entrance, a lab, with several children sedated in containment units. He's recognized, so rushes back to the cellar losing the machine gun.
The Divide is not for the faint of heart - they must chop up the dead, drop them in the outhouse and dust with lime.
It's probably a fairly realistic picture of humanity lost.",1335312000,,1671,4.683673469387755

At the end of the day we're all animals and once our everyday comforts are taken away from us, it's all about survival of the fittest.

Even the wimpy foreign guy was pleasing to the eye when he wasn't crying like a lost puppy. Other than the eye candy, it was depressing, dark, and seemed meaningless. Nothing original or creative, just the standard rape-to-death sicko fantasy world for guys that want society to end. This movie played like someone gave a basic outline and the rest was impromptu, without anyone knowing or caring how it ends or any of the details along the way. The characters were all very flawed or very weak, or both. Would not watch again, would not recommend.",1335139200,7,809,4.625
5056457,4,B007549W62,"This movie is a punch in the gut.  There's a scene at the end between Mickey and Sam  that punched a hole in my heart and made me cry.

This movie has flaws, and since other reviewers covered them quite well, I won't repeat myself here.

Some people don't get it.  It's a movie you have to watch very carefully.  There's a scene between Eva and Sam later in the movie that if you don't catch it, you won't understand why she does what she does later on.  Some reviewers have said the mother does nothing to try to rescue her child.  Did they miss where the soldiers knocked her out, and later, when she tried to open the door?  As for her actions later, the woman has gone quite mad, and gravitated to whom she felt was an alpha male who would respond to her advances (at least that's how I saw it) and protect her.  She was running on instinct, and she was wrong.

For people bitching about the ""Oh teh noes, this movie was sooooo disgusting and awful!""  Do you normally watch random movies which might disturb you without doing any research ahead of time?  I think that sometimes people want to be offended.

The monsters in this film are us.  It is horror, but it's social horror:  the horror of what humans become when they lose their humanity.

The movie isn't gory in the usual sense of blood and guts.  There's some blood, and some dead bodies which have to be disposed of in the only way possible.  This scene isn't shown, but the sounds are obvious, and your mind fills in the rest.  For some, that's far more disturbing than anything graphically shown.

Some people also complain that nothing was ever explained.  Well, of course it isn't: how would the characters know what was going on and why?  We don't need to have every little detail spoon-fed to us!  My own theory is that America did it to itself as a 'Wipe the slate clean and blame the terrorists' sort of thing on select cities throughout the US.  Taking the child yet leaving behind Eva lends some truth to this: they were taking the untainted to harvest, which is even more disturbing.

If you have a strong constitution and can handle extremely disturbing depictions of madness in the aftermath of a nuclear attack, it's worth it.",1335139200,3,2204,4.433915211970075
5056458,4,B007549W62,"This film has gotten quite a bit of love and hate.  For me, the film made me really question whether surviving would be worth it and what would I do or become if I were to survive a horrific event, only to be trapped with other survivors.  I am sure you can read more about the movie all over the internet, so I shall rate the product.

There isn't anything very tantalizing about the special features with this movie.  You get the same features on the DVD or DVD/BluRay combo, so if you want to save a few dollars and aren't all caught up in the BluRay craze, I recommend just picking up the DVD.  You get a commentary, which, granted, may add to the knowledge behind the movie, but I tend to feel that commentaries ruin movies for me, so I avoid them. Then you have the Trailer...Which is odd, because I would think, with the lack of other special features, they would put all of the trailers they had on the disk...but regardless, you can watch the trailers online, so it's not really all that Special of a Feature.  I wish they would have put a blooper reel on the special features just to lighten the mood after such a heavy film.  It would have been nice to mentally relax after watching the movie with a good chuckle.  Also, I would have liked to have seen a short or something, perhaps...in comic book style, about what led to the disaster in NYC...though...that may ruin the purpose of the film and the intentional ambiguity of it all.  C'est la vie.

For settings, I was pleased to see that there were English SDH subtitles, as my partner is deaf.  English Subtitles are great and all, but it's really nice when they are SDH subs.  It allows all persons to be aware of other sounds rather than just spoken words.  I was very pleased they took the time to put that setting on the disk.

The main menu is run-of-the-mill.  We've seen it done a million times, nothing really special there.  And you have your typical scene selection.

The run-time at 122 minutes felt very long the first time I watched the film, but perhaps that was because it was so intense and I was holding my breath through much of the film.  The second time I watched the film, I felt it seemed shorter, but that may be due to the fact that I could remind myself to breathe now and again as the movie continued.

As for graphic violence in the movie...It's not nearly as gag inducing as Saw or Hostel.  It doesn't find itself in the torture-porn spectrum, but be forewarned...This movie is a psychological film and a lot of the things that occur WILL mess with your head.  I felt very empty...Like I lost a part of myself when watching this film, especially at the end.  The desperation created in the film seemed far too real to me.

So, all in all, if you want a movie that really just messes with your head and causes one of those deep anxiety internal conversations, I recommend watching this film, but don't expect much in the way of special features or extra pieces added for depth.  If you are or someone you are watching this with prefers subtitles...This disc will be excellent viewing for them.  The dialogue, as far as I could tell, was not changed/shortened.  As far as I noticed, it was word for word, so those reading the subtitles won't be missing out.

Whenever I see a bomb shelter movie, I always think about this ""Twilight Zone"" episode. It is the one where there is limited room in a bomb shelter as a Civil Defense announcement is made. The neighbors turn violent. Likewise in this film, it is the examination of people's character. Plot continuity is unimportant to the film. As a side note, notice the importance of plastic sheeting and duct tape during a terrorist attack.

The action starts from the opening clip. No time for character build-up. The reason why there is no character build-up is that the people represent different aspects of society/human psyche. Mickey, (Michael Biehn) the super of a NYC apartment building has made a shelter in the basement...for himself. He ends up with a group of tenets which he resents and they likewise despise his cigar smoking rough ways. While he is hard-nosed, he looks out for everyone's safety. He won't win any congeniality contests.

The tenets get on each others nerves. Some question Mickey's sanity. Things turn weird as there are outsiders of unknown origin. The film contains some realistic and horrific scenes of killing, torture, dismemberment, menstruation blood, and rape. It examines our core psyche and how it relates to our society: The desire for power and control among men, the competition of age and youth in women for suitors, and the many uses of duct tape. The bunker is a microcosm of society that starts out on equal footing and evolves into a ""haves"" vs. ""have nots"". There is a struggle for their world's finite resources...which on a larger scale has happened outside the basement.

Sadly, this one big mystery is never addressed ever again and instead, the movie descends into complete madness.

It's one of those movies that makes you wonder how the actors can do what they did. I love apocalyptic fiction, but tend to find the psychotic aspect that some of these stories focus on to be extremely disturbing, disgusting, and just not for me. For example, the cannibal cult in Lucifer's Hammer or the department store freaks (though to be fair, those guys escaped from an asylum) and Macklin's camp in Swan Song. Perhaps I just have more faith in humanity, but the idea that people can be reduced to such animalistic, psychotic behavior makes my skin crawl.

The Divide brings this exact type of creepy crawly feeling to life. I watched in horror as things just got worse and worse. It's an interesting psychological thriller that examines the basic human emotions and instincts such as love, jealousy, courage, and the need to survive but ultimately came down to what felt like a confusing mess. As I mentioned, a big mystery is revealed relatively early on and then is never, ever addressed again. If this was going to be the case, the mystery should never have been introduced in the first place.

I was led to believe that this mystery was where the movie was going and it seemed really interesting, but the movie ended up being about human depravity and psychological torture.

Reminiscent of ""Lord of the Flies"" and ""Omega Man"" and a hundred other movies in the past 50 years of people behaving badly towards one another when they're post-apocalytic stressed. In this case trapped in the basement of an apartment building soon after the opening scene of an atomic bomb destroying their city. The building's custodian has conveniently built into his basement abode a doomsday shelter stocked with food; a massive safe to store it in; a potty to the sewage system; some mysterious electrical source and a massive steel door into the complex. The point of the story is not in it's credibility but in displaying how nasty people can be so don't read the following if you don't want to know the problems.

Story problems: First, no explanation of why an atomic bomb blast and to what worldwide extent. Second, that the custodian could afford an apartment basement fortress without the owners questioning it. Third, that he has his own unknown power source. Fourth, the bizarre behavior of the trapped people works for a movie but their overly obnoxious, not rational, me-first behavior didn't come across as believable, and it only got worse. Fifth, for some reason shortly after the blast a bio-suit armored group happen to have an acetylene torch to cut through a steel door which of the thousands of destroyed buildings they happened to pick. They suddenly attach miles of plastic tunnels to a crumbling apartment tower and for some never explained reason are keeping people in large incubation chambers with loads of lab equipment.

5056488,5,B007549W62,"First off, This is not for children or those with any concern of graphic violence.  The themes portrayed here are dark and evil and this is a stark look at humanity and the decent into madness that isolation and fear can induce.  Also I find that the involvement of ""higher and more organized survivors"" interacting with the group adds to the sense of dread and ultimate dissolution of sanity.  The use of cinematography to capture the emotion of these events adds a very real and foreboding setting.  Once the world is viewed it is desolate and dark and reminder of the consequence of war.

The story begins with explosions (obviously nuclear) seen outside of an office window stories up in an apartment building.  As chaos errupts people make there way down stairs to the ground but some groups seek out the underground basement as a place to hide and regroup.  The Super of the building is a survivalist and has been preparing for the end of the world for many years.  A former military man and firefighter in 9-11 he is no stranger to surviving difficult and seemingly impossible situations.  Yet as we learn his wife and daughter perish in a fire themselves.  He is hard and impassionate.  Yet despite all of this he allows the 10 or so people to pile into the basement storage areas of the building. There is so many stress elements to deal with for everyone involved as the story continues but here are a couple of the highlights.  They can't let anyone in or out of the basements primary entrance due to the fear of radiation and dust.  There are load banging noises constantly as the building itself collapses and the sounds of other destruction continues long after the initial barrage.  In short,  the psychological strain is great and it plays against each character in varying ways.

Ultimately we learn that the risks outside are as great as the risks of those inside.  Who are these survivors and will they maintain sanity or slowly slide into the abyss of madness.  This concept is played over and over and things get only worse as time passes.  I don't wish to give any more away.  We know that the world around them is in ruin but the reality of their situation is too much for them to mentally grasp and as the tension builds so does the danger and despair.  The walls of humanity shake and crumble and the images will haunt you long after the last scene.

We know what is happening and yet the story continues to suck you in.  The character interaction is strong and the acting was very good.  The cinemetography was striking.  This is a powerful story with even more memorable images. I highly reccomend this movie as it was the most realistic I have seen dealing with the aftermath of nuclear warfare.  Why did all of this happen?  Do we ever really know?  If the world did end and you found yourself in that basement how would you know what was really happening or when it was safe to go outside?  How would the government deal with it and would they be helpful or the opposite?

It is hard to rate a movie like The Divide and I'm hesitant to say I liked it due to being judged as a psychopath. I'm not going to tell my mom about it, but I actually like this movie. Yes movie, not film. It is very fast paced yet patient as it cooks the crazy in each of the tenant's minds while they're stuck in the basement/bunker. The movie starts off with a bang and never lets up. It gets more and more intense as it goes on. At first I found the acting a bit cheesy, however as the movie went on each character became more interesting and well played.

The movie is violent, disturbing, un-nerving, and sometimes makes you squirm in your seat. There is a little twist here or there, however not much is really explained. You know what they know and nothing more. You are viewing the people experiencing this tragedy and you are locked in that basement with them. If you are one of those people who have to know why something happened or try and make sense of the madness, you may not like this movie. It is not a thinking movie however it projects the psychological effects of being confined to a small space with a bunch of people with little food and water. The beginning of the movie started to annoy me because I wanted answers. Why did the city blow up? Was it bombed? But as the movie progressed I understood that the explosion had really nothing to do with the movie, it is all about the people and the toll it takes on the mind.

Michael Biehn and Lauren German were brilliant and strong characters in The Divide. Milo Ventimiglia also had a very intense character to play. There were times where I was laughing (more in the beginning) due to the interaction between the tenants as not all of them get along. It is quite a rapid turn from the beginning of the movie to the end.

The PQ and AQ are both very good. The PQ is sharp, yet a little grainy as the director indented. The graininess really adds something to this movie and I 100% appreciate it. The AQ is crystal clear and at a good level blows you away with the intensity of the actions on the screen. It is a great movie to give you subwoofer a workout. There also is an almost constant buzz of the lights throughout.

Do I recommend The Divide? Yes, I do. Is it worth multiple viewings? Yes, I very much think so. It is one of those movies that wasn't great, however it will sit and stew around in your head for weeks to come and it will become one of those guilty little pleasure movies that you watch every once and a while and enjoy it.

The acting was unusually good with some veteran actors, albeit most of their careers having been of the b-movie variety, putting in some outstanding performances.

If I had to choose one word to describe this film it would probably be ""realistic"", unfortunately. It depicts just how low man can sink when stripped down to their primal instincts. The characters start going ""crazy"" a bit sooner than I think most people would, but the timeline is otherwise realistic. It's definitely not a family friendly film, with plenty of gore, blood, nudity, sex, rape, profanity and plenty else to help this film earn an R rating. I was rather surprised to see Rosanna Arquette doing multiple nude scenes at her age, but I don't want to give too much of the plot away.

My biggest gripe with the film is the lack of coherence in the overall plot and the amount of loose ends left over at the end of the movie. It really leaves you scratching your head wondering why many of the elements of the plots happened and who they involved. The entire background about how this supposed nuclear war broke out and who was behind it delve pretty deeply into the science fiction realm before ultimately being ignored in the end. It definitely is not what you would call a feelgood movie. If you are looking for a horror film with a realistic story, good acting and don't mind sitting through the twisted parts it is moderately entertaining though.",1529712000,,1869,4.712538226299694
8510381,5,B007549W62,"Very good acting and tragic, but probably one of the most realistic portrayals I've seen of how humans can devolve. One thing though, they would have run out of air if they were down there that long.",1523404800,,199,4.405405405405405
8510382,2,B007549W62,"Way too many plot holes, seriously predictable, and uses the most basic of acting with anger as the motivating force.  There is a reason Michael Biehn's career tanked, and this movie pretty well sums it up.",1520553600,,206,4.722222222222222
8510383,5,B007549W62,Very dark story.,1520467200,,16,4.666666666666667
8510384,2,B007549W62,Gave away after watching it.  It was somewhat depressing and not that interesting.,1520467200,,82,5.3076923076923075
8510385,4,B007549W62,I'm sorry tons of bad reviews but this movie was awesome.  The acting of the characters as they basically go insane is incredible.,1519171200,,130,4.6521739130434785
8510386,5,B007549W62,"Great post-apocalyptic film, without all the 'Hollywood.' Dark and gritty. Disturbing human behavior, and probably more accurate than many would think. Michael Biehn is awesome, as usual. Totally underrated actor, he is.",1516406400,,220,5.90625
8510387,2,B007549W62,"I tried to find something good to write about this movie.  The acting was decent.  Weird, but decent.",1516060800,,101,4.555555555555555
8510388,4,B007549W62,"Not many movies scare me. Compared to when I was younger current movies try to add too much gore which is just sick versus scary. However, this movie go under my skin and probably have more truths about what humans would do than any other movie. We'd like to pretend we would do the right thing but trauma changes people - especially long term trauma. Not many people on this planet are strong enough to deal with the psychological impact of losing everything and seeing death around you.

POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT.....

The reason I gave it 4 stars is because, although it would have been unrealistic, it would have been nice to have one sliver of hop towards the end.",1515542400,,667,4.55
8510389,3,B007549W62,I'm a fan of post-apocalyptic thrillers and this could have been a great movie if the characters had more depth. They don't so you are watching a long bleak slog of a movie with people you don't care about as they turn into sadistic beasts and waste away from radiation sickness. I recommend TESTAMENT for a film about life after nuclear attack.,1514678400,,345,4.580645161290323
