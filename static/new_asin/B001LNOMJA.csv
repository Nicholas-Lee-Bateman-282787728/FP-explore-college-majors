8318879,2,B001LNOMJA,"Even for (I'm guessing) 1963 and seeing as how these old sword and sandal movies were in their own way kind of fun. this had nothing for me at all. I expect the bad acting, editing and bad story. This Ed Fury guy, didn't like this at all. he and the ""princess"" fall into a lake and come out dry as a bone...just a little continuity please. It jumped a lot, my copy anyway. I admit to a certain weakness with these types of movies, fun in a bad way, this was just bad in a bad way.",1424736000,,480,3.9081632653061225
