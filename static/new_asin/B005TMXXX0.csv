4891829,5,B005TMXXX0,I remember this movie form my teenage years and was happy to find it listed on Amazon. I ordered the movie which was delivered in the specified time and the movie was perfect.,1325548800,,175,4.333333333333333
4891830,4,B005TMXXX0,"For many years, Ivan Tors' ""Gog"" topped my list of ""movies I want to buy on DVD."" One of my oldest childhood memories is seeing it with my parents at a drive-in theatre in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. I don't know if we saw its initial release in 1953 (I would have been REALLY young!), or maybe a second-run screening, but I vividly remembered scenes from it, even though that was the first and only time I ever saw it. I'm very pleased to now own this little-known sci-fi film on DVD (even though I have some qualms about the disk being ""made-to-order"").

By the way, if you wonder, as I did, why Amazon didn't post an image of the DVD cover, I have the answer. The cover features what looks like a red printed-circuit board layout on a stark black background. It's possibly the lamest, least relevant, most unattractive (not to mention cheapest) artwork I've ever seen on a DVD. It has absolutely nothing to do with the movie. I'm tempted to grab a couple of screencaps and make my own replacement cover. I posted a couple of Customer Images just in case Amazon never gets around to it.

But I digress. What about the movie itself? Well, I found it...interesting. Here's the good news. The video transfer is superb. The full-frame picture has excellent sharpness and contrast, vivid and accurate color and very good production values throughout. I noted just one place where the colors faded for a few seconds. The sound is very good, with crisp and understandable dialogue (except for a few short spots) that's never overwhelmed by exceptionally loud music as is so often the case in today's movies. The acting is on a par with other movies of similar vintage. The special effects range from laughable to excellent, but mostly are pretty good. The two non-humanoid robots, Gog and Magog, are very well-done (notwithstanding the goofy way they flail their arms around while moving), and the laboratory equipment, much of it supplied by the Bendix Corporation, has an aura of authenticity to it. Aviation buffs will enjoy excellent stock shots of North American F-86 ""Sabres"" and Lockheed F-94 ""Starfires,"" and science geeks will be impressed by how accurately ""Gog"" presents certain technical concepts.

And therein lies the bad news. As you watch it, you must constantly remind yourself that ""Gog"" is a 60-year-old movie that deals with ""far-out"" ideas--science fiction at the time--such as electronic computers, remote-controlled robots, atomic power, solar mirrors, spaceflight, cryogenics and other technologies that we take for granted today. Movie-going audiences in 1953 knew nothing about these things, so much of the dialogue in ""Gog"" explains them--in detail, often in stilted language and sometimes at seemingly interminable length. In short, this is a very ""talky"" movie. The long stretches of time with scientists explaining their experiments to each other are punctuated by all-too-brief bursts of activity that actually progress the plot. You would never call ""Gog"" an ""action movie.""

Yet, in the end, I found it very satisfying. The story is quite good, with a distinct beginning, middle and end, and finishes up as a tidy package with all plot points nicely resolved. ""Gog"" is a pleasant way to spend 83 minutes while you consider the incredible advances science has made in the six decades since its release. Viewed as a historical snapshot of the state of technology at the time, ""Gog"" is an interesting, enjoyable, thought-provoking, utterly inoffensive excursion into a world before many (if not most) of us were born. As such, it deserves mention along with better-known sci-fi films of the era. If you're unfamiliar with it, give it a try. It's not the best film of the period, but it's very good for what it is.",1324252800,117,3736,4.9348171701112875
4891831,3,B005TMXXX0,"During the 1950s and 1960s science fiction films started to get popular, everything from big budget classics like Forbidden Planet and the Day the Earth Stood to low budget, yet good ( to some not all ) ranging from movies like Rocketship XM , First Spaceship on Venus and this tale entitled Gog
Gog is actually a robot (with a counterpart named Magog) that is created by scientists conducting experiments underground. Within this group of scientists this is a traitor who is sabotaging everything including the robots Gog and Magog who turn evil. Its up the scientists to find who is sabotaging everything and to stop these robots. The robots are a cool design, sort of like Tom Servo with more arms and a case of bad attitude
MGM releases this in a very good, sharp clear full screen image. The colors look great overall. This is the best that Gog will ever look and probably the only release it will get. There are chapter stops every 10 minutes - there is no scene selection but if you want to jump ahead click the arrow and it will take you 10 minutes further into the film.
This might not be everyones cup of tea but for those of us who like a low budget fun sci fi action film in the 1950s/1960s tradition. Give it a try",1323907200,4,1227,4.409691629955947

Had this restoration effort not been enacted by 3-D Film Archives, the powerful 3D elements that are truly the shining star of Gog, would be potentially lost forever. For 3D fans seeking to complete their classic 3D collection, Gog's 3D depth and dimension are outstanding. Near the end of this sci-fi feature, there are even some stand out pop outs not to be overlooked.

An additional panel is also present on the credits.  The film restoration group here obviously cherished this film and we should cherish their fine, excellent restoration work.  The movie still holds up with very prescient technological developments--segmented mirror technology for precise focusing of a telescope or reflector, the first cyber malware attack using a central computer system (in 1954!), wireless bugging devices, stealth aircraft, and cryogenics.

4891855,5,B005TMXXX0,"Just finished watching ""gog"" released by 20th Century Fox.
The last movie of Ivan Tors' Office of Scientific Investigation movie trilogy, ""gog"" - which was filmed in 3D -  explores the impact of allowing advanced technology to run the day-to-day operations of an underground research facility that is dedicated to launching the first manned orbital satellite into space.
NOVAC is the supercomputer that oversees and runs all the technology in this top-secret underground facility, including the nuclear reactor at the basement level of the base.  Assisting NOVAC are two semi-autonomous robots:  gog and magog.  It is important to note that NOVAC is not an artificial intelligence - it does rely on human input.
The suspicious deaths of two scientists who had succeeded in perfecting a form of cryogenic suspended animation in monkeys - a key breakthrough for manned missions into deep space - brings Dr. David Sheppard, of the Office of Scientific Investigation to the facility to investigate the deaths and determine who is responsible.
Here's where ""gog"" gets intriguing.  Dr. Sheppard is wearing a wedding ring.  It's hinted, but never fully suggested, that the deep cover OSI agent he has a romance with is his wife.
""gog"" was also a bit ahead of its time showing women as scientists, astronaut candidates, and department heads in roles of authority over men.
As more deaths of scientists and astronaut candidates vital to America's space efforts occur, Dr. Sheppard and his ""wife"" must race against time to uncover who is the actual killer before NOVAC causes the nuclear reactor to go critical - destroying the secret space base.
""gog"" is a very intense science fiction thriller that accurately predicts why a supercomputer can go bad - here's one hint - it's not because NOVAC had a ""HAL"" moment.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
FIVE STARS!",1471132800,6,1836,5.1033333333333335

4891866,4,B005TMXXX0,"This is an underappreciated fifties sci-fi film that I was glad to see again. It was made well before the space age was really in gear and accurately presented many ideas of the times on the hazards of manned space flight. In a super secret base scientists are trying to develop safeguards against these perceived hazards so the astronauts could go into space and return safety. They were also exploring power sources for space craft and orbital stations. However things are going wrong at an alarming rate and when scientists start dying they have to solve the mystery behind the deaths.

Some things do come across as unintentionally funny, such as when dealing with a radiation source only the person handling the isotope is in a protective suit while onlookers three feet away are totally unprotected. The computer that helps run the base is pretty accurately described but it was nowhere near powerful enough to handle all the tasks it was supposed to be doing at the same time, but it was a necessary plot point. There are two robots, Gog and Magog, that are accurately portrayed as sophisticated machines and not evil villains. They also forecast stealth planes with a viable explanation of their stealth abilities.

The main flaw for me was the pacing, once someone dies events start happening very quickly and considering all those brilliant scientists they are kind of slow to catch on to what is going on,  but if they had the movie would have been pretty short.

So relax with some popcorn and see how the future was going to be in the 1950s.",1468454400,,1554,4.7444444444444445

4891894,5,B005TMXXX0,"This review is for Gog (3-D) (Blu-Ray) released  by Kino Lorber in 2016.

'Gog"" is the third and final movie by Director Ivan Tors, of his Office of Scientific Investigation (OSI) trilogy. The other two were 'Riders to the Stars' and 'The Magnetic Monster.' The movie stars Richard Egan (David Sheppard), Constance Dowling (Joanna Merritt) and Herbert Marshall (Dr. Van Ness).

BLU-RAY DVD: The quality of this DVD is excellent. The picture is clean and crisp and even the stock video shots look good. The 3-D is superb and I thoroughly enjoyed watching 'Gog' in 3-D. The color is excellent also... at least to my untrained eye. I'm no expert in picture quality and it's terminology. Let's just say it's nice to have such a nice print in color since there were so few color movies made in those days.

3-D: The 3-D is real nice and I have only one minor complaint. Whenever the direction calls for an object so be sent in the direction of the camera it gets real blurry. For example, when you see something that looks like it is exiting the television and coming into your room, the object loses it's clarity and becomes a blur. At least it does for me. I have no idea if different TV's and players handle this differently.
We learn from the interviews in the extra's that Gog was not available in 3-D for almost 60 years. It was rarely shown in 3-D even when it was first released. The cost was high for 3-D in those days (perhaps it still is, I don't really know). The 3-D camera that was recently invented back in those days used two reels, one for each eye and the camera was very large and bulky. The overall cost for producing the prints and showing them was higher also. In addition to having to print two reels, the theatre owners had to use two camera's in order to show the movie. The color film stock also added quite a bit of expense. Soon after a successful opening in 3-D, it was decided to just show the movie in regular 2-D. Since you need two different reels in order to see 3-D, the result was that there were many more right reels made than left. Both the left and right have to be show frame for frame in perfect sequence. All of the left reels had disappeared into history until about 5 years ago when a left reel surfaced. Fortunately it was complete but some of the color was washed out. Once again, I'm no expert in film quality or restoration but according to the interviews they enhanced the color to bring it up to what we see today.

EXTRA'S: There is an informative audio commentary by film historians Tom Weaver, Bob Furmanek and David Shecter. There is an interesting interview with the director, Herbert L. Strock and another interview with one of the developers of the 3-D camera. The interview on the development of the 3-D camera is somewhat technical and a bit hard to follow but it is very informative. There is also a restoration demo and trailer gallery.

PLOT: David Sheppard, an agent for OSI (Office of Scientific Investigation) is sent to a secret base in the New Mexico Desert to investigate some unusual activity including deaths. There, he meets up with another agent, Joanna Merritt, with whom he has been having a relationship with. Though this doesn't really factor into the movie. The base is located underground and has 4 levels. They are secretly constructing a space station there. Most of the functions of the base are controlled by a computer called NOVAC. While the two agents are there more deaths occur but Doctor Van Ness insists on keeping everything quiet as the project must continue despite the danger. There are supposedly 150 or so scientists at the base but you don't see more than a few throughout the movie. For the most part it looks mostly deserted but...hey...they only had a $250,000 budget...so let's not quibble. During the investigation we learn of two robots called GOG and MAGOG which are under the care of Dr. Zeitman but can be controlled by NOVAC. Early on we learn that NOVAC was built by a European company and it is also discovered that there are mysterious radio transmitters that are being found throughout the base. We also learn from security that there is a mysterious high altitude plane that keeps showing up overhead but it is not seen on radar. From the the poster of 'GOG' and the cover to this DVD we know that at least one of the robots is responsible somehow for the death's but how and why is the question. It's left up to our two agents to figure out exactly what is going on.

I thought this movie was very good and better than it's reputation. I like movies that are intelligently made and are not all about the action. Even though the science isn't necessarily accurate, it isn't bad, especially for the times. This is still 15 years before mankind lands on the moon. The robots are of particular interest because they are from a functional standpoint very well designed. They don't look anything like the more human looking robots that would come into vogue shortly thereafter. The pace is even as the two agents step by step uncover the truth as to what is going on. The acting is above average with maybe just one or two performances a bit 'over the top.'

Ultimately, it is another cold war paranoia film but i don't think that's a bad thing. It was the times. I have one minor complaint with regards to the special effects. While most of the effects were very good, the air battle was very poorly executed, looked completely phony and looked out of place with the rest of the movie. The fiberglass plane in particular looked terrible. Everything else looked very good. Each room in the complex was designed well and some of what we see is not fake at all, such as the helicopter that brings Sheppard to the base and the room where they are testing the gravitational forces on the human body. That room is an actual testing center. I have read and heard of complaints that the robots don't look at all dangerous nor threatening. I have no complaints about this. As I stated above, I think the robots were intelligently designed and this isn't a horror movie. We don't need a scary monster. 'Gog' is more of science fiction, detective hybrid that for me, works well. While not necessarily a great plot, it is still good.

I am giving the movie 5 stars. 4 stars for the movie...ok more like 3 1/2...but it gets a star for the blu-ray quality and and star for the 3-D. So that comes out to 5 1/2 to 6 stars!

As usual...thanks to Kino Lorber for giving us this 50's sci-fi movie in beautiful blu-ray color (along with the 3-D).
Not all of these movies recently released on blu-ray are necessarily good values but this one definitely is. It is worth the $18 that it initially was priced at.

4891912,5,B005TMXXX0,"If Gog were a cat, youd surely think it had used up eight of its lives, and had come perilously close to losing the ninth.

Its a science fiction film of the 1950s, uncommon in that it strives to be not a fantastic yarn, but a mystery-adventure grounded in the hard science of its day. Its really a kind of tightly contained odyssey, as we follow its hero on a journey into a remarkable underground research facility, tasked with launching a working space station and beset by unexplained acts of sabotage and coldblooded murder. With its man-of-action hero, its modest coterie of lovely starlets in supporting roles, its gadgets and gizmos, and its atmosphere of Cold War suspicion, Gog qualifies as an Ur-Bond film, anticipating some of the Sean Connery vehicles 15 years down the road.

But what truly sets Gog apart is its exemplary use of 3-D. Filmed in Natural Vision by Lothrop Worth, one of the key artists in the field of stereo cinema, Gog strikes a solid balance, offering the occasional off-the-screen effects while at all times presenting comfortable, rounded, carefully composed and dimensional moving tableaux to entice ones gaze.

And this is where we come to explain the cat analogy.

Gog, like other 3-D films of the 1950s, was filmed using two-strip 3-D technology. Separate cameras and separate strands of film, one for the left eye, the other for the right, were employed to create the stereoscopic 3-D effect. Over the years, some reasonably decent elements for the right eye were preserved. But one (and only one!) left-eye print survives, badly faded but otherwise nearly pristine. Bob Furmanek and Greg Kintz of the 3-D Film Archive have worked miracles restoring Gog to its original color, sharpness and luster. Watching this Blu-Ray disc, you may find it compares very favorably to House of Wax, Kiss Me Kate, and other well-regarded 3-D films of its era. In my view, it blows recent, timid 3-D cinematography out of the sky.

The story will not be to every taste. It is a 60-year-old film that could not possibly predict everything humanity would learn in the intervening decades. But the plot, unfolding as a mystery, does sustain interest, and the cast is credible and interesting and entertaining to watch. The gorgeous 3-D visuals wrap it all up with a bow.

If you are a dyed-in-the-wool 3-D fan, or even if you are a casual 3-D enthusiast, you will not be disappointed by the stereo visuals, rescued for us to savor by Messrs. Furmanek and Kintz. I urge you to give Gog a spin. I think youll not be disappointed.",1458000000,3,2546,4.801369863013699
4891913,3,B005TMXXX0,"Gog takes place in a top-secret underground laboratory in the desert where American scientists are putting the finishing touches on launching a space station into orbit. The massive installation is run by the supercomputer Novac. Novac also controls two experimental robots named Gog and Magog. Lately, there have been mysterious murders at the research base and  Dr. David Sheppard (Richard Egan) is sent to investigate.

Gog is unusual for a few reasons. First, its one of the few 1950s science fiction movies shot in color (Forbidden Planet, War of the Worlds, and This Island Earth are others that come to mind). Second, it was filmed in 3D in 1954 at the height of the initial 3D craze. And third, it is one of few pictures to combine science fiction with a murder mystery.

Limited to the underground lab and extremely talky, the movie is fairly static until the robots come into view. They look like an amalgam of R2D2, a hot-water heater and an elaborate vacuum cleaner, a design that makes them seem not at all menacing despite their power to turn on the humans. The films reference to the robots as Frankenstein of steel is considerably overblown, and it often looks as if the human actors are purposely positioning themselves in the path of a marauding robot.

Suspense is generated mostly by the confined environment, since escape is difficult. A pervasive atmosphere of paranoia reflects Cold War fears and insecurities of the era.

4891923,5,B005TMXXX0,"Thanks to the kindness of friends I got to see GOG last night.

OK, my plan with this release was to watch all 3 OSI films, which I started last week with RIDERS TO THE STARS (not the first I know but my least favorite of the 3 and poorest copy as it's off of broadcast from Turner) and planned to do over the next 2 weekends.
I was not going to have time to do see both this weekend, but when I got this copy I of course couldn't wait to at least look at it. I've been waiting for almost a year for this, ever since it was first announced.
I had a social commitment and couldn't even start until late (for me), so I watched the relatively short MAGNETIC MONSTER (which I love) and then planned to put this on just to check out the 3D, then watch it all next weekend, but of course once I did I was HOOKED and had to see it all.

In short: AMAZING! EVERYTHING I was hoping for.
Trust me when I say that this is technically probably THE BEST of ANY of the classic 3D releases we yet have, and I'm including the ""major studio"" releases of HOUSE OF WAX, DIAL M, CREATURE, etc.

Seriously, technically this disc is flawless and has as good 3D as any I've seen! You would NEVER know that the left eye was faded. No ""ghosting"" No scratches or debris. Sharp, steady, and just beautiful color, even if its origins were the cut-rate CCA rather than Technicolor.
The film doesn't have a lot of gimmick pop outs, but the depth is really great. I love the sets and the actual color 3D footage of period planes and choppers. There are a few flat stock shots, but not all are!

I know I don't have to tell any 3D fans this is a must have, but what if you don't have 3D or aren't that into it?

Well, IF you like the film and had the old MOD, you'll still have to have this as it totally blows that away. Proper aspect ratio for one thing. Better image for another, and of course blu ray resolution.

I know these ""A-Men"" films aren't for everyone, along with their cousin SCIENCE FICTION THEATRE. I myself am not that into RIDERS TO THE STARS, although a decent legitimate release would probably help my enjoyment immensely.
But both this and MAGNETIC MONSTER I find to be entertaining solid stories, and all 3 with engaging casts of familiar faces. They really should appeal to any ""hard"" sci-fi fans who appreciate the history of the genre and that classic 50's feel.

I can't say enough about how much love and attention obviously went into this. It's worth pointing out again that if not for Bob Furmanek and the 3D Archive, this would be lost to history in its original form. They really are saving important culture artifacts for us all.
We (too few) who love the vintage 50's 3D period have them almost solely to thank for having what we do out on Blu ray, and that is almost certainly true for whatever future releases we may get from this era.

4891926,5,B005TMXXX0,"Buried beneath the desert lies a top-secret research facility controlled by an electronic ""brain"" known as Novac. It is here that the world's top scientists are conducting freezing experiments intended for human space travel. We soon find that things are going horribly wrong at this underground laboratory as the machines are beginning to turn against the humans. Something has taken control of Novac, and it's up to Investigator David Sheppard (Richard Egan) to find out ""who"" or ""what"" is behind the sabotage.

Based on a short story by Ivan Tors, GOG is a film way ahead of its time. It is a story written for today, but filled with realistic possibilities for tomorrow, as it presents an amazing array of scientific possibilities that, for most of which, would eventually become reality. However, all this futuristic ""mumbo jumbo,"" as fascinating as it is, becomes the biggest problem for this film. The story becomes extremely weighed down by showing off all these technological wonders, which leaves its characters standing around doing nothing for most of the feature. Most of the action sequences are left for the film's final act, which come across as goofy, as robots ""Gog"" and ""MegaGog"" run amok, trapping their prey under the silliest of circumstances which makes one wonder how escape wasn't possible.

Such are the problems with most of these B-rated, low-budget films from this period. Their aim to entertain is well intended, but they mostly come across as laughably stupid. It's unfortunate, but most (but not all) of the titles released during the Golden Age of 3D fall into this category. That being said, I still have immense interest in viewing these titles solely for their 3D presentation.

Viewing GOG in this newly-restored Blu-ray release was quite a rewarding experience. One has to take into account that this was the most challenging restoration effort taken on by archivists Greg Kintz and Robert Furmanek. In their words, ""The only surviving 35mm left side element was totally faded with no yellow or cyan information whatsoever. Every single shot in the film required up to seven levels of correction, including color restoration, left/right panel matching, flicker reduction, image stabilization, detail extraction from the superior right side element, stereoscopic vertical alignment and dirt/damage clean-up.""

I was invited to a private screening of this Blu-ray at Bob's home a few weeks back with two members of Home Theater Forum. All three of us agreed that this was the finest restoration effort that we had seen come out of the hands of the 3-D Film Archive. Believe it or not, the word ""Warner Brothers"" was tossed around in our conversation, as a studio that puts this much care and effort into a restoration. Most of the credit has to be given to Greg Kintz, who has such an incredible passion for these kind of films and tirelessly committed himself to making this film look as good as it could under a very limited budget. The transfer looks nearly flawless. Colors are vivid (check out the redhead), and the 1080p transfer presents an outstanding level of clarity that brings out a well-detailed image. There are a few blemishes here and there, but when you watch the restoration demo in the included supplements, you realize the night and day difference in print quality. As Bob Furmanek explains, nobody ever thought this film could be saved, and this is the very first time it is being seen in its original widescreen aspect ratio with all its content fully replaced.

The 3D presentation is quite good. The most important thing I want to point out is the film's use of staging and camera positioning to highlight depth. This makes for a highly satisfying dimensional viewing. I think you'll find it interesting that Director Herbert L. Strock suffered from monocular vision. He could not see 3D. However, he had the best cameraman in the business, Lathrop B. Worth, who guided Strock through the process, ensuring that every scene was meticulously planned in advance not to waste any film nor make the 3D too severe that it would hurt the eyes of movie-goers. The result is a very natural 3-dimensional offering with an excellent amount of depth between foreground and background objects. While there is an attempt to throw things towards the audience, I am afraid most of the attempts fall short of being effective. The very first shot we see in the opening of the film is of a nurse with a needle, that is pointed at the viewer. In both projected presentations that I viewed (at Bob Furmanek's and my own home), it was marred by ghosting. This is not unusual for many similar kind of outward projections, and whose severity (or none at all) is dependent on what equipment you are viewing the disc on. Later in the film, attempts to propel a flame-thrower forward falls completely flat. However, there is a very brief moment when the robot MegaGog turns its own flamethrower tube at the viewer, and it works quite well. Take notice of a scene with a group of electronic tuning forks that seem to curve outward. It's one of the better well-pronounced forward protrusions.

The film's 2-channel DTS-HD presentation is excellent, with the film's tantalizing soundtrack and accompanying dialogue effortlessly prioritized without any noticeable background hiss.

As I mostly try to keep my reviews centralized on the plot and presentation, I rarely talk about the supplemental materials that are included. In this case, I want to urge owners of this disc to check out the restoration demo by Greg Kintz and Bob Furmanek, presented in 3D. I have to give kudos to Mr. Kintz in his creativity in making it a very entertaining and educational watch. Furthermore, I also urge the viewing of the 2003 interview with Director Herbert L. Strock, who has some remarkable stories about the making of the film. Also included on this disc is a Trailer Gallery as well as running commentary from Film Historians Tom Weaver, Bob Furmanek and David Schecter.

For me, GOG is one of the less entertaining films released during the Golden Age of 3D. That being said, I have continually mentioned in my many reviews that it's important that support is given to these releases so that we may see more of them. There are still dozens of these titles yet to be released -- with quite a few now in the pipeline. For that reason, good or not, these B-rated films remain a curiosity for those of us who have immense passion for the format itself.

The amount of care that has been given to this title by Mr. Kintz and Furmanek is quite evident when you see how tremendous the transfer looks. Thanks must also be given to Kino Lorber for the efforts they made to secure the rights to this film so the restoration could be done in the first place. GOG is the most ambitious effort put forth by the 3-D Film Archive and every frame of this film exemplifies the amount of care they put into its restoration .",1455408000,6,6929,4.860287891617274

4891929,5,B005TMXXX0,"This is a review of the actual upcoming  Kino Lorber 3D BluRay release of GOG and not the earlier 2D versions on DVD.

Disclaimer: Bob Furmanek is a good friend of mine.

Bob Furmanek gave me a copy of a screener yesterday and I watched GOG last night. I have to say that with each new release from the 3D Film Archive (Greg Kintz and Bob Furmanek) it just gets better and better, The restoration is absolutely stunning, and after seeing the restoration demo both here and the expanded one on the BluRay, you will find it hard to believe that anything but pristine elements were used for this release. It is nothing short of magic what Greg Kintz pulled off!

The film itself is a silly little 1950s cold war pseudo sci-fi tale of a secret underground research facility studying the possibilities of long term space travel, with the place run by a ""super"" computer (built by Bendix) called NOVAC that runs the entire place. Things start going awry when the facility starts killing the scientists, first by turning the equipment on them, and finally with two robots called GOG and MAGOG.It turns out the ""enemy"" (some unknown enemy, terrestrial or extraterrestrial, it isn't specified) is using radio beams (reminiscent of today's Internet hacking) to control NOVAC. Watch for a very young William Schallert being strangled by GOG. The cast also includes Herbert Marshall (who for most of the film I kept going ""I know that guy, I know that voice"").

The film is beautifully shot with lots of depth. In many scenes you feel as if you want to stick your head into the screen and look to the left and right of the edges to see what's there. There is minimal use of the typical pop out sight gags, but they are there and used to good effect. Unlike other films of the period where the producers used stock footage of military operations, the producers of GOG actually took the Natural Vision 3D camera rig onto the airfield to photograph fighter jets taking off and landing. It's mentioned that the director had monocular vision (one eye), so he couldn't actually see the stereo shots he was setting up. Nevertheless he knew exactly what he was doing.

I viewed the film using a Panasonic AE-8000U HD 3D LCD projector onto a 102"" screen. The film was shot and is presented in the 1:66 aspect ratio, mostly filling my screen width. The film was bright with the 3D glasses on (and I am a constant complainer as to how much light is robbed by the glasses) and there was minimal ghosting. The color is bright and crisp (again, magic, considering the restoration to the left eye print) and the focus sharp. The dirt and damage restoration done by Thad Komorowski is so good, you don't even know it was done (see restoration demo for shots of original film damage). Be sure to watch the restoration demo on the disc where Bob and Greg finally get some screen time (in 3D!) explaining what went into the restoration of this film.

For years, Bob has has a large GOG poster on the wall of his living room. Whenever I looked at it I wondered if I'd ever see that film. Well, now I have, and the way the director wanted it seen, in 3D!

Bob, Greg: Fantastic work!",1454457600,2,3149,4.541446208112875
4891930,5,B005TMXXX0,"This is a review of the upcoming KINO Blu ray of GOG.  Not the inferior MGM made on demand release also being discussed here.  It's base on a actual viewing to the Blu ray and contains no speculation as to what might be on it.

I was at a private screening of this new GOG 3D Blu ray release this past Wednesday (Jan 26, 2016) and I can report that it was an impressive  presentation. Getting to see this in 3D was a dream come true for me since it was the first film I remember seeing in a theater.  I guess the first time I saw a color film now that I think about it.  Since the 3D version of the film was only shown in a handful of theaters in Southern California in '54, it felt almost like a world premiere.  A really special night.
The 3D works a bit differently than things like THE BUBBLE as there are not too many in-your-face moments until the end where the flame throwers and Gog and Magog's arms are coming out to get you.  You will not be disappointed in this one, though as it's the depth of what your are seeing that works so well.  When Michael Fox is getting frozen solid behind the frosting window in the beginning, I can see 4 or 5 layers looking in from the front of the window going back to the wall behind Fox.  Some of the deep corridor shots make the underground facility look positively immense.  I am convinced that seeing this film in 3D is the only way to truly experience the filmmakers intent and this has been wonderfully created here.
Since I am going to write about this release elsewhere, I was allowed to bring home a pre-release copy of GOG and give it a thorough going over.  I compared it to the full frame MGM MOD release that I had and ...well there is no comparison.  Even as a 2D film the upgrade is astounding.  The color is rich and perfect for the film.  If only we could have the SCIENCE FICTION THEATER episodes look like this I would be ecstatic.
The interviews with the director and cinematographer shot in the early '00s are engaging and though a bit technical at times, they quite enjoyable.  Strock especially has an animated talk and seems truly proud of this film.
There is also a short about the discovery and restoration of the previously lost left side print and it features superstar film magicians Bob Furmanek and Greg Kintz on screen discussing what a major undertaking it was to bring this film to us.  Bob handles the job of talking head quite well I must say.
Other than the 3D presentation of GOG however, my favorite feature on the Blu Ray is Tom's audio commentary with the help of Bob and David Scheter on air and a good bit Dr. Robert Kiss about the films release read by Tom.  Everything I always wanted to know about The A Men (Atomic Men) and the OSI (Office of Scientific Investigation) and the trilogy of films comprising of THE MAGNETIC MONSTER, RIDERS TO THE STARS and GOG is brought out and lit up to perfection with the Weaver information spotlight.
Tom's commentary is so informative and skillfully done that it ranks as one of his absolute best so far.  He just seems to get better with each one. Bob Furmanek's section of the commentary is also delightful.  That he and Greg were able to get the left side print to match the lush color of the right is, in a word, miraculous.  This is state of the art restoration, folks!
Explained on the commentary, the opening credits are and always were in 2D.  One of those things that just delights me is that the credits contain a card not seen since the rare 3D showings of the film which gives the nod to the 3D artists who deserve ample kudos for the work put into this film.
David Schecter's talk on the music of the film left me slightly less enthused as he seems to matter-of-factually belittle the picture here and there.  He does know his stuff and I appreciated the info dug up on the composer and his work, but much of it was over my head.  Music scholars, I am sure, will have a field day with it.
There is so much information discussed here that the film runs out before Weaver had time to talk about and name the episodes of SCIENCE FICTION THEATER that had the OSI making appearances.  I think they should have had the commentary go on for the left side print!
Will 3D aficionados enjoy this Blu ray?  Of course.
However, fans of 50s sci fi with caveman styled 2D TVs will also be able to relish this release since it is so darn gorgeous.
I want to thank Bob and all those at the 3D Archive for a great couple of days and for their untiring work to make this all come to pass for us.  Now it's up to us to go out and support this.  Even with this screener copy, I want to buy a real copy to get the packaging!",1454371200,18,4644,4.264538198403649
4891931,5,B005TMXXX0,"In response to the comments below, it is no longer necessary to purchase the ""made to order"" DVD.  Its is now available in high definition real (field sequential) 3D.  The footage is crisp and the sound is decent although I couldn't get my home theater to emulate 5.1 with the disc. Nonetheless, its a healthy transfer that was painstakingly scanned with hd cameras as opposed to simply porting the film over to a blu ray and leaving it as is. THATS LAME SONY/COLUMBIA. Stop doing that. You already ruined  Ghostbusters. I digress. This is a bizarre little movie but the imaginative sets are an interesting peek into a future that didn't quite materialize but as all film and television, its esoteric meaning is what often gets overlooked.  Gog now sits handsomely on my dvd shelf alongside House of Wax and Creature from the Black Lagoon.

4891946,4,B005TMXXX0,"""Gog"" is a great period piece and was really on the cutting edge of science fiction when it was first released in 1954. The drama unfolds at a secret base in the American Southwest, where preparations for spaceflight are being undertaken. The film stars the great Herbert Marshall, who turns in by far the best performance here, and two robots Gog and Magog, named for Biblical characters. After people start dying in a myriad of mysterious ways, suspicions mount and there is much overwrought dialogue explaining both the high tech (for the time) elements that were much more dazzling in 1954 than they are today, and the investigative mystery of the deaths and potential identity of the killer or killers. The plot features a number of twists, including a satisfying one near the end, but I want to give minimal plot details so as not to spoil the film for first time viewers.

The special effects were excellent by the standards of the day, and remember that in 1954 the concepts of spaceflight and computers were both in their early infancy, so cut the movie some slack. The robots are pretty interesting to watch, though ultimately hokey from our current vantage point, but the film overall is enjoyable if you can take it for what it is: a 1950s sci-fi morality play. It's true that ""Gog"" has its share of clunky acting and bizarre plot elements intermixed with frequently ponderous dialogue, but the film stands the test of time better than most of its peers.",1436659200,4,1466,4.749019607843137

But who was the enemy? Considering this appears to be a 50's era production, I can only make one logical guess.  These ""vintage"" movies generally have a good plot, reasonably good acting, and the special effects are good too, as long as you don't compare them to present day.

4891992,4,B005TMXXX0,"I have a soft spot for GOG because I saw it when I was very young with my parents at a Drive In (not first run, but in some late-1960s re-release).

This is, honestly, NOT some long forgotten great SF treasure. This is not War Of The Worlds, or Time Machine, or Day The Earth Stood Still, or The Thing, or Invasion Of The Body Snatchers-- great films all.

GOG is a second- or even third-rate SF B-picture. It's almost one step away from being a MST3K parody. ( I haven't checked, maybe MST3K actually did parody it).

There's a lot of talk and not much action. The characters are all cardboard. The scriptwriters force the actors to deliver looooooong monolog lectures, 'explaining' nonexistent pseudo-science to an audience they must have thought were imbeciles. The dialog is stilted and chunky and amateurish.

And the zero-budget 'special effects' are GOG and MAGOG, a couple of aluminum-foil-covered-cardboard-box chest-height ""robots"" that don't even move an inch for most of their brief time onscreen.

I mean, this is a painfully awful little film.

I would never spend money to own a copy. But if you're in a nostalgic (and very forgiving, and MST3K-ish) mood, by all means see this on Instant Prime Streaming.
Feel free to jeer and boo at times, and enjoy the cheesy no-budget unintended campiness that is GOG.

Recently, I've been enjoying old sci-fi / horror movies on Friday or Saturday nights.  This definitely fits that bill.  Compared with some of the others I've seen recently, this is a step higher than most, but it's not my favorite.

So my father directed the set staging.  During the filming, Richard Egan kept having trouble in several scenes where he had to turn the dials and flip switches.

4892015,4,B005TMXXX0,"There is something special about Hollywood's hard science fiction adventure stories from the 1950's. They're a charming mixture of facts, naivete, reverence for science, brazen untruths, and unrelenting faith in the brightness of mankind's future - all presented with a kind of didactic bend. GOG is a shiny example from 1954 (originally released in 3D, I've come to learn).

GOG is very science-y. The story is set in an underground 5-level top-secret government facility that houses 150 top scientists and their research. While each scientist specializes in a different area, all are unified in an American effort to put man into space. Their work ranges from robotics to nuclear research to experiments in spaceflight dynamics; some of it is sound and some is ridiculous, but all of it is charming. (There's one scene in particular where each character rattles off information about the sun - effectively a series of data points strung together in a way that sounds more like the script from the Discovery Channel's ""Universe"" series than it does a movie script, yet it beautifully typifies the quaint allure of the period and embodies everything that's lovable about it.)

The main character is an archetypal hunky 50's strong-man adventure movie lead-type who's smart, professional, and smooth with the ladies. He's the kind of man little boys hope to be one day.

Unfortunately, GOG's greatest flaw is its climax. The film builds up to a final showdown between our hero and two experimental robots, Gog and Magog, but the constraints of its low budget make the sequence laughable (probably even in thrilling 3D), which is too bad because the film might have otherwise had more persistence in the list of memorable science fiction films of the 50's. (If you choose to watch GOG, try picturing how different it would be if someone re-worked the ending by swapping in digitally created robots over the original photography [robots not necessarily redesigned, but more muscular in their movements and believable in a fight - ratcheting down the laugh-ability and upping the believe-ability]).

 Having grown up the 70's, I was ever starving for more consumable content aimed at science-fiction-loving-kids like me and was painfully aware of the limited amount that had been produced over time. Somehow I missed this film in my childhood, but GOG would have been an excellent addition to my repertoire of weekend afternoon movie watching. Enjoy!",1397174400,,2446,5.151133501259446

4892027,4,B005TMXXX0,"Interesting, early take on the robot(s) on the rampage Sci-Fi sub-genre. Originally presented in 3D, at the height of that movie gimmick's popularity. Sadly, it's only in plain old 2D here. Who knows, maybe one day they'll release this in a Blu-ray version, set up for today's 3D televisions. The movie is okay but very talky, without much real action or conflict. It's actually more of a cold war spy drama, thinly veiled in sci-fi trappings.

The plot concerns several mysterious deaths at a government think tank research complex situated in a remote desert location. The underground facility is dedicated to working out the complexities of deep space travel. Things there take an ugly turn when, unbeknownst to the humans working there, the mainframe supercomputer programmed to run the place (BAD idea!) experiences a glitch and suddenly starts killing off scientists and their test subjects. (The first murder is a cold-blooded one - literally!) WASPy hero guy is brought in to get to the bottom of the dastardly goings on. Two security/guardian robots, named GOG and MAGOG, are the mobile eyes, ears (and claws) of the main computer, NOVAC. These motorized, multi-armed, tank-like contraptions get title billing but are truly only a small part of the plot. Except for a brief demonstration sequence to familiarize Our Hero with the automatons, they don't get involved in the conflict until the film's climax. I won't spoil it for those of you who've never seen this film.

The film's biggest stumbling block, IMHO, is the bland ""hero"" and his equally bland (re: ugly) girlfriend. What an unattractive pair these two make. Cardboard cut-outs pulled around on skateboards would have had more charm and better chemistry than these folks. Where are Mara Coraday & Richard Carlson (or better yet, John Agar!) when you need them??? Another problem with this film really isn't a problem IF you happen to love techno-babble, as our new kid on the block Hero is taken on a (seemingly endless) tour of the underground labs. You see, each laboratory hosts a different type of ongoing experiment directly related to solving the challenges of sending man deep into space - at least as they seemed to 50's-era sci-fi writers. (Some of the tests are rather silly, some are pretty cool.) Patient viewers might enjoy this film but those who require lots of snappy dialogue and/or lots of action will be bored to tears. Fast-moving this film ain't! I like and enjoy this movie purely for the sci-fi relic that it is.

The DVD for GOG is one of those on-demand jobs, which means zero extras and no remastered video or sound. Even so, I must confess that the print is pretty terrific-looking and the sound is crisp & clean and the mix is even. The DVD box art stinks, but that's pretty common nowadays. Sad, since so many of these old sci-fi & monster films had really awesome theatrical posters & cool promotional artwork that would be easy to crop for DVD / Blu-ray box covers. Oh well... Look up some examples of GOG's artwork on the internet and create your own custom cover to replace MGM's lame red circuit board cover. 4 STARS for this OK but slow moving sci-fi spy drama.",1393718400,2,3166,4.837638376383764

and nice FX leads you into a slow start, but once bad things started to happen in the underground lab, it really rocked and rolled and kept you on the edge of your seat till the last minute. The robots look like something that are in our 21st century. This was well written and could be a reality in today's world. It would pay to go to Wikapedia and look up the robots names: Gog and Magog. Very interesting biblical references. Watched this one 4 times in 3 years.

Not a bad film, for the era. Interesting concepts, and the science portrayed was a  little ahead of its time, but many of the ideas were on the forefront of the time period. Lots of dialogue, scripted well, and the sets were really well done. Typical for its genre, the men were in charge, and the women, although portrayed as 'smart' always took a subservient role in any situation, sometimes to the point of being helpless. The only detraction from the film were the robots whose arms waved about while they moved. Silly, really, but still a fine movie of the time.

4892039,5,B005TMXXX0,Amazon Prime promised GOG and 5 other DVDs 2 days shipping. It took only one day! GOG came from Kentucky to Phoenix in one day and shipping was FREE! I saw GOG in 3-D at the Fox Theatre in 1954 (50 cents plus 10 cents for the Polaroid glasses). The DVD color is great but I find the graininess a bit objectionable. I lowered the sharpness on my 40-inch widescreen from 80% to 25% and the picture looks great! This is another film that should have been transferred in 1.85! If you want to see GOG and many others from 1953 foreward that are transferred in 1.33 just set your TV to ZOOM and it will crop the top and bottom of the frame and fill your widescreen to about the 1.85 aspect ratio. One reason the widescreen films were filmed in 1.33 is that they were ready for sale to television down the road without any lab work having to be done. Some 1.85 films today are still photographed full-frame (1.33) leaving it up to theatres to use a 1.85 aperture plate. A reason 3-D films didn't last long is the film companies had to make 2 prints of each feature which doubled their print cost! Theatre owners didn't like the unions requiring them having to pay 2 projectionists instead of one!

4892041,1,B005TMXXX0,"I had seen this movie noted in reviews a few times while ordering other old sci fi films, had never seen it, and finally decided to buy it.  Error!!  I have to say that this is the worst, most stupid movie I have seen, probably ever.  This DVD of it is a technically good copy, good video and sound quality, but the movie itself really is the most annoyingly stupid film I have ever seen.

One usually gives a movie, especially a sci fi movie, some slack without even noticing it and usually without it detracting from enjoyment, like in Star Wars where space ships rumble through the vacuum of space, or a villain having been created by (you guessed it) being exposed to radiation, and vague gibberish to explain something ""scientific"", but this was so stupid it's beyond description.  I mean, people are dying like flies and the reaction is repeatedly to call Security Control to ""tighten up security"" and tell the base staff to ""be careful"".  They detect aircraft in the area by using an array of tuning forks on a table (they look like an elementary school science project) way down in an underground lab room, and the tuning forks' vibrating can kill those in the room.  Hey, great system!  They investigate a highly radioactive murder site, the lead guy goes in first (in his plastic drop-cloth ""radiation protection"" suit) because. as he cautions, it's so dangerously radioactive, while the others in regular clothing cheerfully follow him a yard behind him.  Good grief!  When they discover an evil aircraft operating above them, they scramble F86 Sabre jets, which once in the air apparently mutate into Starfire aircraft (bye-bye Sabres), who peel off and dive downward to get the mystery plane that's high above them.  Go figure.  The gages have needles swinging back and forth frenetically to show danger.  People trapped in rooms and about to be killed have a hammer in their hand and work on the door latch and run around screaming to show how dire things are while ignoring the glass window next to the door that leads to safety.  Smart folks, sharp as a tack.  Sorry, they deserved to die!  At the end, they launch a space station and so we see footage of a German V-2 being launched.  Aw, c'mon, guys!  I could go on for hours on the egregious errors, stupid stuff, and the endless number of jaw-dropping, completely senseless non-sequitors, but enough.  On top of all this, the acting is painfully lousy.  How did Richard Egan get sucked into doing this one?  Even he just strolls through scenes, showing zero emotion and not much acting.

One can easily forgive the naive science of the 50's, the cliche formula of handsome leading man with beautiful woman partner (with the usual Madonna bra that I guess was considered sexy at the time), scientists are always older men with glasses and pipes and baggy pants, and all that kind of stuff, but I am sooooo sorry that I spent money to get this.  It is not a sci fi classic, it is not a good movie, it is not bad in a campy or funny way, it is not even a home movie, it's truly like a LOUSY home movie made by 9-year old kids in their basement, honestly and literally.  Bad, bad, bad.  The only good highlight I can mention is when they say the mystery plane did not show up on radar because (and no way they could know this at the base shortly after the plane was shot out of the sky...) it was made of fiberglas, a prescient view into today's stealth aircraft that use shape and radar-proof materials (coatings).  Other than that, a complete waste of time that is painful to watch, beyond being even humorously inept.  The words ""painful"" and ""stupid"" dominate my thoughts, sorry.  I wouldn't have watched it beyond a few minutes except I paid for it (duh) and also I kept hoping that the plot or a clever twist in the ending would justify the favorable reviews I had seen.  But nothing good ever showed up.  Nothing.

Can the fragile bodies of human beings tolerate space travel?  That's what we have to find out.

In case outer space turns out to be too dangerous for humans, then the station will need mobile robots to perform certain duties in place of humans.  Two robots have been built and are undergoing testing, however, their tank-tread mobility, their clumsy four articulated arms with simple claws, and their forward flamethrower limits their usefulness.

You know - perhaps better than anyone - the urgency to get our space station in orbit before they do; if we are first, we can secure the peace; if they are first, no one is safe, our cities could be devoured by fire from the sky without warning!  Your progress has been rapid; you are certain we will be first, but then when two researchers are murdered. . . .

When watching this film, remember it was made in 1953.  In one scene, the astronauts and their pressure suits are being tested under high g-force.  Their seats are mounted on a spin table facing the direction of rotation instead of facing the center; this implies the spaceship's seats are mounted sideways: a most uncomfortable way to fly!

4892054,3,B005TMXXX0,"Ivan Tors, the Hungarian writer/filmmaker/producer will be known by his fans for his sci-fi and animal films.  But most of all, using scientific fact rather than focus on scientific fantasy.

In the 1950's, Tors created the Office of Scientific Investigation (OSI) trilogy featuring the films ""The Magnetic Monster"", ""Riders to the Stars"" and ""Gog"".  The third film, ""Gog"" was popular among sci-fi fans because it was shot in 3-D (during a time when 3-D was the fad in cinema in 1953-1954) but also shown normally in theaters.  The film was also well-received by sci-fans.

As part of MGM's Limited Edition Collection, ""The Magnetic Monster"" and ""Gog"" have been released on DVD as part of their made-on-demand program.

""Gog"" is directed by Herbert L. Strock (""I Led 3 Lives"", ""The Crawling Hand"") and a screenplay by Tom Taggart, the film would star Richard Egan (""Pollyana"", ""The 300 Spartans"", ""A Summer Place"") and Constance Dowling (""Black Angel"", ""Up in Arms"").  This film would also introduce the actress to Ivan Tors, which would lead to their marriage two years later.

""Gog"" begins at a top-secret government facility under the New Mexico desert where a space station is being constructed.  Scientist are currently working on a freezing project but something goes awry as the scientists are locked inside the freezing chamber as something mysterious has taken over the controls of NOVAC (Nuclear Operative Variable Automatic Computer), a central computer which controls all equipment in the facility.  And eventually, two scientists are froze to death.

With 150 of the lab's top scientist are killed, Laboratory supervisor Dr. Van Ness (played by Herbert Marshall) calls in OSI agent Richard Egan (played by David Sheppard) from Washinton, D.C. to investigate.  Egan joins OSI agent Joanna Merritt (played by Constance Dowling) to investigate the laboratory. Both Egan and Merritt also happen to be very close to each other.

But as the two try to determine who is sabotaging the lab and killing the scientists, the mysterious enemy manages to kill six more scientists and Chief of Security, Major Howard.

Meanwhile, an enemy plane has been detected overhead but is not registering on radar.  Could this mysterious plane be involved with what is happening inside the underground laboratory?

MOD PLAYABILITY:

Part of the worry of viewers who had bad experiences with MOD DVD's are the printing quality. There are some who can't get them to play and are literally now just coasters.

With ""Gog, its printed quite well with printing on top of the DVD, it's not a plain silver disc with letters. If you didn't know it was MOD, you would think it was an actual DVD release.

As for playability, I played it on my Blu-ray player and DVD player with no problems. I then played it on my Mac and PC, no problems whatsoever.

VIDEO AND AUDIO:

Although presented in 3-D and flat in theaters, ""Gog"" is presented on DVD via 1:33:1 full aspect ratio and in color.  As far as picture quality goes, the film has been manufactured using the best source available. The picture quality for ""Gog"" is actually very good.  There are some white specs that do show up from time to time, I did notice a few frames that had some damage but considering the film's age, ""Gog"" looks quite good on DVD.  There is a fine layer of grain, colors are good.

As for audio, ""Gog"" is presented in Dolby Digital and the dialogue is clear and detected no pops or hissing during my viewing of ""Gog"".

SPECIAL FEATURES:

There are no special features in this release.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Gog"" is possibly among the better 1950's sci-fi films especially one that tries interject actual science into its plot.  Stories that Ivan Tors is known for.

And while sci-fi fans who appreciate older sci-films will be nostalgic with the release of ""Gog"" on DVD.

One must remember that ""Gog"" was before ""Star Trek"", before ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and while sci-fi films have explored aliens landing on Earth, films didn't really explore technology going awry.  Sure, the film looks dated today but back then, I can only assume that the actual science and featuring robots, computers, the use of cryogenics, mirror reflections and high frequency sound used as weapons, may have been quite significant and also exciting to people back in the '50s.  And with the Cold War, the idea of an enemy plane spying on top-secret military facilities probably made this film seem all too real and may have freaked out a lot of people.

For so many decades, many fans of this sci-film have wanted to see Ivan Tors trilogy out on DVD.  And with the release of ""Gog"" and ""The Magnetic Monster"" (via MGM's Limited Edition Collection MOD program), sci-fans should be very happy.

Overall, while ""Gog"" may be nostalgic for many who grew up watching it, for some people, it may seem a bit too-dated or a rather a B sci-fi film.

I personally enjoyed the film but also admit that I felt it was dated and cheesy but as always, I try to put myself in the shoes of the viewer watching the film during that era.  And with the mystery of who is killing all the scientists and who is controlling NOVAC and the robots, there is also an action element as well.  So, I can see how some may have been entertained by ""Gog"".  Where else can you find a film that features a one-on-one fight between a human vs. a robot?  How cool was that?

So, considering the idea of a space station (as the United States was still trying to find ways to get people up into space), spies controlling technology (with the Cold War, anything was possible) and cool technology at the time combined with scientific fact, I'm sure sci-fi fans found ""Gog"" to be an enjoyable sci-fi film and a movie worth owning on DVD.",1335571200,8,5726,4.776422764227642

It was composed for widescreen presentation as well. Like all other early widescreen films, it was protected for the standard academy ratio of 1.37 as many theaters in smaller towns had not yet installed new widescreens. If you look at the composition, you will see a lot of dead space at the top of the frame. That's because the image was intended to be shown 1.85.

4892059,4,B005TMXXX0,"This is a movie I was hoping to find on home video for over 30 years.  It started out as a weekend grade-b matinee for the 1950's pre-teen generation, then ended up being shown on local TV stations because it was cheap.  This is one of the films I grew up with, and as silly as it may seem, I've always loved it.  For those who haven't heard of it before, a secret underground base somwhere in an American desert is readying the first manned space flight to launch from Earth.  The entire base is automated, controlled by a central computer called NOVAC.  Suddenly, researchers and test subjects start dying when the automated equipment begins to function on its own.  One scientist - and his assistant - are locked in a low-temperature test chamber and frozen to death.  In another incident, a centrifuge accelerates to maximum speed in spite of the researchers' attempts to stop it and kills two astronaut training subjects.  In desperation, the base's manager - played by 50's sci-fi great, Herbert Marshall - calls in a scientific investigator played by Richard Egan.  During his investigation, Egan interrogates the designer of the computer, Dr. Zeichmann, who arrogantly denies the possibility that his NOVAC is involved.  During questioning, Egan notices that there are two robots parked in one end of the chamber.  Zeichmann has named them GOG and MAGOG, after characters in the bible.  He claims that he built them as replacements for human astronauts because he believes that humans could never survive the acceleration or other conditions of space flight.  After a few more incidents, Egan discovers that radio waves are being beamed to the central computer from somewhere in the stratosphere.  These signals instruct the central computer to operate the machinery that's been killing the base's occupants.  He runs down to the computer chamber to confront Zeichmann, but before he can reveal what he knows, Zeichmann gives him a chilling piece of information - MAGOG is gone, and no one knows where it went.  Almost immediately, alarms ring out to inform the base that the nuclear reactor that provides power to the installation is starting a chain reaction and threatens to destroy everything.

At this point, I don't want to give away any more on the chance that someone reading this review might be interested in seeing the movie.  Yes, the dialog is clunky and the special effects are amateurish, but the plot of the story - a remote control takeover of a central computer in order to destroy an important American project - is the basis for many other films and stories that followed.

4892061,4,B005TMXXX0,"As an avid collector of 50's sci-fi films, I've waited a long time for this official release of ""Gog.""  It's one of those movies that many of us heard about or read about for many years, but rarely got the chance to actually see.  So was it worth the wait?  For the most part, yes (please note, minor spoilers follow).

Despite being originally screened in 3-D (which was at the height of its popularity in 1953) and featuring a pair of robots, ""Gog"" doesn't really fit in with its pulpy rubber-monster brethren of the same era.  Here's a science fiction film with--gasp!--real science (more or less).  This is both an asset and a liability, depending on how much ""sci"" you like in your sci-fi.  In other words, if you're tuning in to see a lot of killer robot action, you'll be disappointed.  ""Gog"" is a very talky film, although it held this viewer's interest with a plethora of science gadgets and impressive lab sets.

Which is not to say there isn't SOME action.  The film racks up a surpising body count, as the scientists and other workers are exterminated by....well, you'll have to see for yourself.  The production values are also pretty high for a ""b"" movie.  The lab scenes have an almost documentary-like reality to them.  And the robots Gog and Magog, while less believable, are well-made and memorable.

As I said, I've waited a very long time to see a good print of this film.  And MGM doesn't disappoint.  The color scheme is typical for films of the period: Almost saturated in places, but very bright and well-defined.  The mono audio track is clear throughout.  Unfortunately, there are no bonus features at all, not even scene selections.  But if you're a fan of the movie, or just 50's sci-fi in general, you'll want to add this one to your collection.",1325721600,44,1774,4.628205128205129

It's a favorite movie here, and this DVD is far and above the quality of the streamed versions we'd had access to in the past.",1503619200,,274,4.132075471698113

8486425,5,B005TMXXX0,"I've seen this film in many versions - bad B/W tv version, field sequential 3D DVDs created by fans on EBay, color 2D versions, etc. - but NOTHING like this! Thank you Kino, Bob, Greg and everyone involved. Beautiful vivid color! Perfectly aligned, ghost-free, stunning 3D! Like seeing it for the first time! (Played on PS4 via 2.2 compliant HDMI cable to LG OLED65E6P tv in passive 3D.)

Love this movie. Like a time capsule of Cold War America, complete with wild claims of enemy (Soviet) weapons in space, underground nuclear research bunker, crazy (pretty awful) mysogeny of women, rockets, fighter jets, ""futuristic"" dials and gizmos and killer robots! One character is told, ""Nothing to worry about. You just got a bit too much radiation."" (!)

Highly recommended for those interested in a funny, scary, fascinating look into the 50's American mindset. Extras are great. I think I see myself in the photo of a crowd at the World 3D Expo at the Egyptian (shown in the excellent restoration mini-documentary). Haha. This blu ray is my new favorite ""classic 3D"" film. Get it while you can!",1500595200,2,1092,4.865591397849462
