8065110,4,B0009PW3S8,"i could not possibly give the 'Tokyo Pop' versions of initial D a five star rating due to the differences from the original show in japan v/s the 'Tokyo Pop' version. I've noticed that their are scenes that are cut out from the 'Tokyo Pop' version, but understandibly maybe bot suitable for kids and some of weak composure.

then again, i truly love the show, and must support it.",1139011200,,380,4.507246376811594
