3145070,3,B0015I2SKG,"This documentary addresses a small section of the gay community that defines marriage by a very western heterosexual model. This is completely appropriate for those who chose to live by these ideals, but it is by no means the majority of the gay community. The gay lifestyle is quite diverse. That's what makes us so interesting. These ideals will undoubtedly become more common with the approval of government/society recognition of same-sex marriage.
One woman who really bothered me was the aunt of one of these men. She kept saying, ""I don't believe in same-sex marriage, or that gay isn't a choice, but I love my nephew and I accept him. I wish they would've made a different choice."" What a complete hypocrite! She said she was a Christian woman and hoped that same-sex marriage would never be recognized by the law. The scary part is that she was a school teacher who taught social studies. I hope she is no longer influencing the children of our country with her prejudice views.
My favorite couple was the one that had been together for 51 years. There retrospective on gay life since the 1950s was fascinating.",1467676800,5,1120,4.778350515463917
3145071,5,B0015I2SKG,"Very good movie. I hesitated at first if I wanted to really watch it.  I am so glad that I chose to watch it because it is about 4 male couples who talk about their relationship with honesty and candor through an interview style conversation involving either just the two men and or their family members and friends. It was really interesting and wonderful to see such different relationships working and learning about their relationship beginnings and growth and lessons and reflections on their relationship and life together. It was filmed in 2006 and was before, of course, nation-wide same sex marriage. The mature couple, who met in the 1950s was probably my favorite of the four stories.  I could relate to different parts in each story as well as discover something wonderful about commitment from each story. So, I would recommend this to you to watch. I am open to watching it again.",1467590400,2,894,4.798701298701299
3145072,5,B0015I2SKG,"Within a few stories - most of which were very interesting - I found myself going back down memory lane; sometimes laughingly & sometimes almost wiping tears of frustration.

It's this strange dynamic that causes me to give this five stars. This film is well done.  It's the people interviewed who can be a big question mark in terms of helping.

Growing up in a small town in the Midwest, before the internet and surrounded by extremely religious people that were loving yet extremely closed minded, there were moments during this film that made my skin crawl with the feeling of going back into a very negative time.

Occasionally it felt like the family members or friends of the guys were saying, ""I love you, but you're still going to hell"".

That's an extremely painful feeling that may not be the best for younger gay kids to have to grow through, if it can be avoided.  Then again, it may just be the impetus to get families talking in this day and age.

Reality check : For most of us it's not a choice.  It's simply our life.

You the viewer can be the judge in terms of how you feel after watching this very well done documentary.

It may very well help share perspectives in your life.  All the Best.",1467331200,5,1212,4.4389140271493215

8258633,3,B0015I2SKG,"This just is not a good documentary. It has a 1970s feel to it as far as its approach to gay issues, like being gay is something weird and no one understands it. The straights interviewed are straight (so to speak) out of central casting, either Anita Bryant supporters or ""I'll try to understand"" types. Maybe it's because most originally come from red states, but again this is 2006, not 1976. All these people appear to be trapped in some bizarre time warp.

The couples interviewed seem like they are on valium, or bad actors in a porn film. While I don't doubt they're in love, none really seemed like it except for the last ones. The director also spends endless, endless wasted time on useless 'home movies' like watching gay couples do lawn work, play frisbee, have their parrot take a crap on camera (really, this was important to include?), visit a fast food restaurant for 10 minutes, etc. We get it, gays lead normal lives. We got that in 1986, much less 2006. We don't need to spend one third of the film watching it, especially since the couples aren't adding any new insight while deciding where to put new sod.

Overall this film does not deliver anywhere near its promise. Sad, because underneath the monotone interviews and the incessant home life drivel there are good stories here.",1509753600,,1301,4.6521739130434785
8258634,4,B0015I2SKG,Interesting. I loves the older couple at the end...wonderful film.,1501200000,,66,5.7
8258635,4,B0015I2SKG,"This documentary has a lot going for it as is, but there was even more potential there that wasn't mined.  A lot of the interviews spent time with parents that didn't really have a lot to say to the camera that was any different from what so many have already heard their whole lives. Of course, it's a shock or makes one angry or is sad... but the question I wished was asked was WHY? Don't you want your offspring to be happy? Don't you want them to find love? If they are and do, what else matters? It's selfish to live all sad and angry because someone else isn't living their lives as YOU want them to. Who cares what you want? It's THEIR life, not yours. I could have easily gone without the religious Aunt's rants and her terrible views. That part made me angry, I don't know why they gave her that much footage still left in an otherwise great little documentary. We know those views exist, we don't need to hear them.

Other than some very bad sound mix, sound quality, film quality, this is a sweet take on gay relationships. I wish they'd have interviewed a couple in their mid-50s because that is when some really important things start coming into view: mortality, financial security, health, living arrangements, downsizing, the realization that you don't have to take any krap any longer, and more... personally, that's the most exciting time of life, I think. That step into the third triad of life is only for the brave.",1501027200,,1437,4.501915708812261

However, the purpose of these reviews is to help the future buyers. I can NOT recommend paying for this.  There may be important truths in this video but the sound quality and technical presentation is so badly done that it is painful trying to watch. I should be the one being paid!

What a shame this presentation could not have been done by someone with basic skills in technical aspects.  Can not find any competence in lighting, directing, sound, editing, etc. Better videos have been produced on a cell phone.
