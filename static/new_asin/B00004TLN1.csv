8163540,5,B00004TLN1,"A great adaptation of the Oscar Wilde classic. It is a ghost story, a comedy and a romance all rolled into one, starting as mainly a comedy - the American family is more irrtiated that scared of the ghost The very attractive innocent young Virginia Ottis (played by Sarah-Jane Potts) , the 17 year old daughter of Otis the family even throws water at him after being woken by him and muttering how late it is and that his antics are not funny.
Rolf Saxon plays the practical millionaire who buys the haunted mansion, Hiram Potts. Edna Dore plays the wise old housekeeper Mrs Umney and James D 'Arcy is Virginia's toffee nosed suitor Lord Cheshire.
The materialistic mother, Lucy Otis,  played by Celia Imry is quite unhappy at the disruption to the families social standing and the scene in which the ghost (magnificently played by Ian Richardson) is just hilarious.
More romance and a sad departure and happy union at the end.
Well recommended.",1512432000,,945,4.7272727272727275
8163541,5,B00004TLN1,"Of all the versions of this tale, this is the one I like the best.  I find Ian Richardson's ghost to be the funniest.",1414713600,,117,3.875
8163542,5,B00004TLN1,"I caught this on PBS, and while it seems to have a light Disney feel to it, it was still pretty entertaining. The 'modern' American family (especially the terrible twins) versus an Old World weary ghost is both a fun and sad contrast. While penned by Oscar Wilde, the plot and humor reminds me of Twain.
There are many filmed versions, and I don't know if this is the best, having only seen the 1944 Charles Laughton film. In that one, the story was about confronting cowardice and radically changed 'for the war effort'(WWII propaganda), with dated slapstick humor. While viewers like that movie for other merits, it has almost nothing to do with the original story which this movie faithfully depicts.
The out-of-print BFS Carlton dvd looks and sounds the same as the vhs; the change in media is the only improvement, making it more convenient if you only have a dvd player.
While I haven't watched the new release (and thus can't comment on it's dvd quality), it is available in a 3-dvd set:
The British TV Family Collection: Three Historical Period Classics.
Still relatively expensive since you're buying 3 dvds, but much cheaper (and new, not used) than the resellers.",1231891200,7,1174,4.788177339901478
8163543,4,B00004TLN1,This is a classic story in true Oscar Wilde wit and flair.  It's both hautning and funny.  It's a fairy tale for all ages.  In this story a young American girl helps to free the tormented spirit that haunts an old English castle.  It's very well written and a beautiful tale for all ages.,1188172800,7,288,4.277777777777778
