8343282,2,B001UDPA92,"I purchased this dvd not expecting what I saw. I thought I was going to see a movie like blood in blood out or american me. Instead I got a mexican telenovella with luchadores. Rogelio is your typical gang member hustling the streets of Mexico. Rogelio has his famous luchador uncle trying to take him off the streets and become a luchador like him. Rogelio has other plans and hustles his way into the pockts of a rich politician who likes strippers and gets dopped by Rogelios homegirl. The politican goes out to the streets looking for Rogelio and his crew. Along the way Rogelio's sister is raped by an opposing gang and makes the movie move in to many directions at one time. I just sat back and watched the movie since I had paid for it. I noticed there was no review so I decided to let people know that this is the type of film you expect from a novella and not a movie. There is a ton of nudity for no apparant reason but to keep the men from turning off the film. The rape seen is pretty brutal and some of the strippers dancing at the club are pretty tore up. I would only recommend this movie to people who like novellas or movies with tons of nudity and a bad story line.  This is a bad example of a film from mexico go watch something else this is an embarresment to Latin  film. I suggest better films from Latin America like ""Y tu mama tambien"", ""Vidas Privadas"",""Under the same Moon"", or a very good horror film like,""The Devils Backbone"". These movies do justice and many more that I didn't mention to Latin Cinema.",1291420800,3,1533,4.301038062283737
