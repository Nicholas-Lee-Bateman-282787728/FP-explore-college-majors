8001403,5,B0000DZ3BV,Marianne Faithful is in it. Always loved her. Great Irish stuff. A fun movie. Van Morrison instrumentals fill the empty spaces. Makes you nostalgic for a time that you never lived in. A simple time where we are all Irish haha. Good stuff.,1426896000,,238,4.558139534883721
8001404,2,B0000DZ3BV,"This movie asks the viewer never to question anything, just accept the story as it is told...but I can not do this. Dominic around 14 and his older brother anywhere from 19 to 27 live a carefree life. Father is dead and mother is off to Africa. Patrick has no visible job, but they have money...from where no one bothers to ask. Dominic does not go to school, and no adult really presses the issue. I guess Ireland does not have mandatory education and education is not any priority to anyone, including the mother when she does finally shows up. Anya a girl from Germany shows up....I guess she is a relative of the aunt...does not explain how an Irish aunt has a German niece and there is no hint of a german accent. Anya is suppose to be in college but she looks more like 14...I guess this was done to make it more believable that a college age girl will be torn between a 14 year old and his adult brother. She comes across more as a slut than a belivable girl in love with two. Anyways the mother returns to Ireland, so the boys go to Dublin. Anya just happens to have a friend who just happens to have a flat that he is willing to let them have for free. Patrick just happens to find a job selling religious articles is a small shop with two gay? men. And of course that is going to pay so well that he is able to feed the three of them and provide them with booze.  Sorry, but I am going to cut to the end:  Anya decides to go back to Germany I guess because she can not handle being in love with two (personally, I think she is going to find new lovers). Dominic runs off to sea at his age. Guess Ireland has no child labor laws either. Patrick goes back to the store, and the mom is okeedokee with all of this....yeah right.",1126137600,3,1734,4.127218934911243
8001405,5,B0000DZ3BV,"As a fan of Marianne Faithfull you too will be beleiving that Marianne has adopted you into her family.  The ""MOONDANCE"" is truly a treasure and a magical reality check.  Marianne's perormance left me unable to determine if she is acting or truly a genius, the second is an obvious.  This film is too ""cool"" to be mainstream in the ""good ""old"" U.S.""  The masses wouldn't get it.... I did...  Thank you again Marianne Faithfull
BRAVO!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1074556800,9,445,4.802631578947368
