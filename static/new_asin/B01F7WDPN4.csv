8760445,5,B01F7WDPN4,"I don't know anything about ""Serpent films"", but I'm completely satisfied with this Classic Mystery edition. Excellent quality and sounds well. The DVD region is All Regions, it's possible to watch on any region DVD player. About the film, oh ... I love some good old mysteries and ""The Thirteenth Guest"" (1932) is one of my very favorites, a little bit creepy story line, beautifully shot and acted, a young Ginger Rogers shines on the screen and looks absolutely adorable.",1505520000,,474,4.9375
