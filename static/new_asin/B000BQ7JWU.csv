Certainly, but not offense. For Americans purchasing this movie, the DVD allows us to choose English subtitles which are most helpful in following the dialogue. Viva la France! and Viva la Mathilda May!",1479945600,,356,4.933333333333334
8091068,5,B000BQ7JWU,"'Tete and the Moon' is a light-hearted and sensual story of a little nine year old boy named Tete (Biel Duran) who wants to be treated the same as his newborn baby brother. Unable to get his Mother's attention and affection away from her new bundle of joy, Tete decides to go in search of a surrogate Mother.

Tete asks the moon to provide him with a loving female. When a beautiful French dancer (Mathilda May) and her husband arrive in town Tete is certain she's the one he's been looking for. However convincing her won't be easy, not only does he have to deal with her husband, but another local teenager is also in hot pursuit of the enticing Estrellita.

This is definitely not for the prudish, or easily offended. There is quite a bit of frontal nudity in this film. However if you're open-minded and have a good understanding of European humor you will appreciate this erotic little comedy as much as I did. By the way, Mathilda May is absolutely ravishing, I don't know if I've ever seen a more beautiful woman in any film!",1313884800,2,1032,4.48404255319149
8091069,3,B000BQ7JWU,"I just want to start by speaking of this one's title. Now it was originally released as ""Le Teta i la lluna"". When released in English it is known as ""The Tit and the Moon"". The distributors of this Amazon copy obviously have a problem with the word ""tit"" and thus have opted for a half-Spanish, half-English 'compromise' title.

Anyway, onto the film. The chief character is a boy called Tete (played by Biel Durn). Obviously a Spanish pun on the word 'boob' (teta); he's obsessed with breasts and breast-milk. This obsession is manifest in a feeling of alienation towards his mother following the birth of a baby brother. He misses his mother and he envies his brother - and the attention he's getting as he's breast-fed. He also feels alientated towards his father.

Tete sees big boobs everywhere and dreams of the milk they contain. He meets a circus performer Estrellita (played by Mathilda May - anyone who's seen ""Lifeforce"" will know her perfect breasts). Tete fatasises about feeding from her breasts. There's a scene where he asks her for milk and she exposes her breast and squeezes it, shooting a stream of milk into his mouth.

To add further drama the movie is set in the lead-up to the Fiesta de La Virgen de la Salud (Festival of the Virgin of Good Health). This is set in the first week of September, when the town of Algemes (in Valencia) stages one of the most fantastic folklore festivals, incorporating the Human Pyramid Festival. Tete is expected to climb to the top of this human pyramid but his nerve fails. He risks loosing the respect of his father.

Suddenly he fantasies about seeing Estrellita on a high balcony, exposing her breast as an incenentive to climb higher. He then appears on the balcony and she breast-feeds him. From behind them comes his mother and she embraces him and breast-feeds him too - he has at last been reconciled with his mother, and through his bravery, with his father",1222992000,7,1925,4.686390532544379
