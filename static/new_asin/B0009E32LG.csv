2281833,3,B0009E32LG,"For those of you reading who may not be familiar with what this film is, it's essentially a condensed form of the Gundam SEED television series, created, from what I understand, to maintain interest in the series in Japan while Sunrise began work on the sequel, Gundam SEED Destiny. This is not a terribly uncommon practice in anime in general or in the Gundam franchise in particular, as at least two or three other Gundam series have received similar treatment for various reasons.

Going into this movie, I expected something similar to the Mobile Suit Gundam movies, which were also condensed versions of the series by the same name. However, while those films attempted to present a clear story which could be enjoyed without the benefit of the original version (even altering certain aspects to present a new take on the story), the first SEED movie is little more than a quick recap to refresh the memory of already existing SEED fans. A couple of new scenes are added to entice viewers, probably the most famous of which being the new footage of Rusty, the much-lamented but never seen fifth member of the Le Creuset team who dies in the first episode. Some of the early scenes have also been reanimated to give a glossier look to the whole production. Personally, I don't care for some of the new animation. I think it almost makes the characters look like lifeless dolls, destroying the emotion drawn into their faces in the original animation. In any case, while this new material is interesting, at least, it doesn't make up for what the movie lacks.  The first film clocks in at about an hour and half or so, squeezing an immense amount of information into those 90-odd minutes. The entire story arc from the beginning to Kira's final confrontation with Andrew Waltfeld is all covered here. To give an example of how much condensing this is, consider this: most episodes of SEED are about 21-22 minutes, not counting the end credits. This movie encompasses the first 21 episodes of the series. The entire first episode is covered in the first 8 minutes of the movie. The movie loses a lot of character development, cutting some of the side characters, such as Kira's classmates, almost entirely from the story. We also lose much of Mu La Flaga's first battle with Rau Le Creuset, which is a real shame, in my opinion, since I thought it was one of the most stand-out elements of the early part of the series. Since so much of the series is covered here, hopefully that will mean that the second and third movies will feel a little less rushed.

The film also suffers from some sloppy editing. There are several instances where characters make references to events or conversations that were cut from the movie, and a number of important sequences are either cut or edited in a confusing manner. The introductory scenes of several important characters, most notably Mu La Flaga and Flay Alster, are also cut, so that the audience is left without any clear explanation of who these people are and what they're doing when they finally do appear. The end result is a story that is all but incoherent if you aren't already at least passingly familiar with the series itself.

Finally, there's the now infamous sex scene between Kira and Flay. While the series was content to leave this as a wordless moment where Kira runs to the Strike to prepare for battle and we get a brief shot of Flay lying in his bed, the movie version actually gives us a full-blown sex sequence, disturbingly set to the tones of TM Revolution's hyperactive ""Zips"" and interspersed with shots of Kira destroying Waltfeld's attack helicopters in the desert. The scene could, in all honesty, almost be described as soft-core porn. While Kira and Flay are both covered throughout, we see their motions pretty clearly and the sound effects are pretty ""thorough"", shall we say. While I certainly didn't find it offensive myself, I do find it rather pointless, and parents who may have bought this for their younger children, expecting content more along the lines of the series, may be in for a rude surprise. The series itself was pretty clear about what the two had done, if one pays attention, but leaves at least a little ambiguity, given that the show is aimed at teens (and young teens in particular, I believe).

For those of you out there who are, like me, completists, this movie could be worthwhile. If you've seen the SEED series in its entirety, the movie is a reasonably entertaining refresher. If you haven't seen it, though, you're bound to be hopelessly lost and probably bored by the characters who are never explained enough to care about in this version.

One last thing: I understand that the third movie will contain the five minute OVA showing what happens to the characters after the final episode of SEED (which, due to some sort of problems getting the material from Sunrise, were not included in the final DVD of the series), which may make getting that movie worthwhile, even if you don't plan on getting this one.",1125100800,6,5019,4.730285714285714
2281834,3,B0009E32LG,"Fisrt and for most: This movie is not a good movie to see if you haven't seen the series.  It is very choppy and many of the main characters don't see any development at all.  If I hadn't seen the series I would have thought that the movie sucked.

Kira Yamato is thrust into the cockpit of a mobile suit which he dubs Gundam.  He ends up fighting his best friend Athrun in order to protect his other friends that found their way onto the Battleship Archangel, which is fleeing from their enemy forces to make their way to earth.

I do like the extra scenes with Miguel in the beginning (which is the best part).  However, the sex scene between Kira and Flay is totally pointless, as I like the more subtle approach of Kira getting out of the same bed that Flay is sleeping in, which is shown both in the series and movie.  I also don't think that the three shower scenes with Kira, Athrun, and Cagalli were important either. They seem to be stuck in movie to please the fanboys and girls. The only thing that the Cagalli shower scene did was to further prove that Cagalli was a girl (aparently, many people got her confused as a boy) and a very ill tempered one at that.

Athrun, Cagalli, Lacus, Mu and Murrue,  all of Kira's friends, and Athrun's three fighting partners (Izak, Dearka, and Nichol) don't get the proper development that they should.  The movie doesn't do justice to Lacus, who is a pivotal character in the story.

I like the music insert of T.M. Revolution's ""ZIPS"" as it goes well with the flashes of the sex scene and Kira's new found willingness to fight and his ferocity in battle.

All in all, the movie is OK, but could use much work.  Hopefully the second movie works much better than the first.  Warning:  Anyone who as not seen the series, either watch the series first or watch the movie just to get and idea as to what goes on in SEED's story.

2281835,2,B0009E32LG,"Year 70 of the Cosmic Era. Tensions mount...wait, haven't we heard this before? Yes, rather than make a full length motion picture to capitalize on the success of the Mobile Suit Gundam SEED TV series, Bandai and Sunrise chose to make a motion picture trilogy which retells the story that's already been told. This DVD contains the first of the three movies, titled ""The Empty Battlefield.""

  If you're already a fan of SEED, you know what the deal is here. If not, Gundam SEED follows the events of a brutal war between the humans of the Earth Forces and genetically altered humans dubbed ""coordinators"" of Zaft. The story centers around a young, peace loving coordinator named Kira Yamato. When a group of Zaft coordinators invade Kira's neutral colony Heliopolis, Kira finds himself inside the cockpit of the Earth Force's new protype mobile suit, nicknamed G.U.N.D.A.M. With only the desire to protect his friends from Zaft's attack, Kira uses his unnatural abilities to pilot this new machine. But that's just the begining of this complex story.

  The release of the film promised some brand new animation. While this is true, the majority of screen time is animation we've seen before, only now letterboxed. The new animation doesn't really push this release either. In one notable bit of new animation, we get to meet the forgotten member the Le Creuset Team. However, this scene does nothing to tell us of his character, and is rather pointless. The love scene between Kira and Flay is the other notable scene where the viewer is treated to new bits of animation. What was going on between them is now no longer subtle, as we're bombarded with images of Kira and Flay  bumping and grinding flashing between Kira's battle with the BuCUES. Though the idea of sex meshed with war has artistic merit, the scene is ruined with a rather out of place T.M. Revelution song.

  The film suffers the most from the lazy editing. Obviously a great deal of footage needed to be cut to make a 50 episodes series fit into the space of three motion pictures. Though the story is followable, many cuts leave out key points or necessary explanations for the following events of the story. For example, when Zaft makes their second attack on Heliopolis, a Zaft pilot tells Athrun to ""show the spirit that made him disobey orders."" The problem is, the scene of Athrun disobeying order is nowhere to be found in this movie. First time viewers will be scratching their heads wondering who some of Kira's friends are, and why they do a lot of the things they choose to do. Not to mention what in the world ""Blue Cosmos"" is.

The DVD itself is the standard Bandai fair, and that is not a good thing. Though we're treated to a nice flashy cover to stand out from the standard TV series DVDs, the inside features the usual disapointment. Oddly enough, there's no insert cover, which would have been quite helpful if designed like the series insert which featured explanations of key terms of the series. Where they were once nearly useless, now they're almost required. On the only plus side, after seeing the same DVD menu on each SEED DVD, it's nice to have a newly designed DVD menu, flashing the SEED logo each time a sub-menu is selected. The fact that there's even a sub-menu titled ""Special Features"" is a joke. Click on that and all you're brought to is three Bandai trailers (one inclused the Ghost and the Shell: Stand Alone Complex trailer I swear been on EVERY Bandai DVD I've bought this year). However, considering Bandai's track record for a lack of special features, this is not a shock of any kind. Just unacceptable.

Basically, if you're seeing Gundam SEED for the first time, stay far away from this film and check out the TV series. If you're a SEED fan like myself, even still just rent it to check out the scarce new footage. Questionable editing and almost meaningless new footage really bring this release down.",1122163200,2,3920,4.723279648609077
2281836,3,B0009E32LG,"As a huge fan of the Gundam franchise I have already purchased the enitre SEED series and wanted to pick up this movie in order to complete my collection.

  The problem with any of the Gundam movies is trying to compress the storyline and character development even more than they are in a 50 episode series.  I thought they did a good job of still keeping in the development for the Mobile Suit Gundam series three movies, but this one keeps its focus almost entirely on Kira and really doesn't go into the other characters as much.  About the only other character truly developed is Flay, simply because she is a large part of Kira's development at this point in the story.

  While it was great not to have any re-cap episodes taking away from the pace of the story, I did miss the earlier battles between Strike and the Crueze team, the destruction of Artemius, Kira's small trial and alot of the moments with Mu and his tutelage of Kira.  Instead, we are treated to a new opening sequence involving the ZAFT team preparing to invade Heliopolis (which I thought was cool and let Rusty and Miguel have a little more face time) and an intercut scene of Kira and Flay having sex and Cagalli taking a shower.  Neither of these last two scenes, I thought, were necessary to the overall storyline.  Those of us old enough could already have figured out what had happened between the two, but the creators were just filling a battle scene with storyline so as to save time.  It did work, but I still believe was unnecessary, and I think the Cagalli shower scene was only there for her fanclub.

  If your a fan of Gundam then this movie will keep you in the club, whether you have scene the series or not.  However, someone unfamiliar with Gundam or didn't like one series and is trying it out again, will not be swayed by this movie.  The story is simply too fast-paced and significant scenes are cut and placed in battle scenes to keep the pace going, which will lose anyone not used to the series.

  For SEED fans, you'll definitely be disappointed by the lack of character development for favorite characters like Athrun, Lacus, Mu, and Murrue and the interaction between the crew (especially the Mu/Kira and Mu/Murrue interactions).",1121817600,,2236,4.584382871536524
2281837,3,B0009E32LG,"CE 71- War rages in the Earth's sphere between the Earth Alliance and ZAFT. Away from the conflict, student Kira Yamato and his friends lead normal lifes like any other citizen in the seemingly neutral Heliopolis colony. But this peace is shattered when ZAFT launches an attack to seize five new mobile suits which have been developed for the Alliance within the colony, unknown to the citizens. Fate sees Kira as the pilot as the last remaining prototype, a weapon known as 'G.U.N.D.A.M.'...

It's been nearly a year since Bandai began the US DVD release of the popular Gundam SEED series. Whilst that series has now ended  and hype builds for a similar release of the sequel series Gundam SEED Destiny, Bandai are filling the gap by releasing the SEED Special Edition trilogy. A fitting decision, as they served much the same role in their homeland.

The packaging is a standard DVD case with the sleeve being printed on nice holographic paper. The front cover art depicts Kira, Lacus and the Strike whilst the back explains the basic plot and lists the staff. There is no insert included inside the case.

The menu opens with Strike's launch sequence which is intercut with scenes from the 'movie'. The main menu centers a picture of Launcher Strike posing with the Agni cannon whilst in the upper left hand corner zoomed in and faded clips play. Going to another menu sees the 'Gundam SEED' logo fill the screen and gradually fade out. The 'Special Features' is nothing more than three Bandai trailers. Disapointing but expected for a release like this, especially after how far Bandai seemed to have to reach for extras for the SEED series DVDs.

The SE's are a series of movie-like retellings of the SEED story, with some elements removed or changed and at some points completly new footage. This first one covers from the start of the series up to Kira's fight with Andrew. From the get go, it's obvious to anyone who has seen this story in it's original form that you're witnessing a much more sped up take on the story. What took two 22-minute episodes of the series has already been zoomed through by the 15 minute mark of this special alone. Alot of the speeding seems to be a result of the director being eager to get to the next action scene. Having seen the series I knew what was missing so I could link things up but perhaps that's a bad thing as those are new to the story may be left scratching their heads. One of the biggest losses is the focus on Kira and Athrun's friends. Kira and Athrun receive alot of attention whilst the likes of Miriallia and Sai only appear during scenes on the bridge. Since Kira states his reason for sticking with the Archangel is to protect his friends, the decision to cut their scenes is odd. In the show they gave him support, whilst here they often come off as untrusting. Likewise, Yzak, Nichol and Dearka do so little you almost wonder why they're there. Alot of their scenes early on were ""monster of the week""-like battles, an element the MSG compilations likewise cut. Whilst cutting back some of the battles makes sense, it leaves Athrun's friends with little impact on the story and makes Kira's SEED Mode seem odd, as he awakens it in his third or so battle here rather than after a good amount of battles.

The new footage for the most part is basically used to tighten up scenes for the lack of time but there are some which are interesting. For example, when Lacus enters the Archangel cafeteria in the series we see it from Kira and friends point of view whilst here it is presented from Lacus' point of view. Undoubtedly the most talked about and possibly contraversial new scenes is a more graphic representation of Kira and Flay having sex. The show received flack from Japanese parents for a subtle scene which implied this, so perhaps the new footage could be taken as Fukuda mocking such critics. Whilst the scenes aren't too graphic, they're likely to cause unease amongst some and parents buying this for younger children may want to think it over.

Of the battles that remain, Kira's first fight in the desert is notable because it contains an appearance by TM Revolution's 'ZIPS' as an insert song. Whilst a good insert song is always nice alongside a good battle, I feel the song doesn't quite work. It's fast and punchy whilst most of the battle is Kira getting knocked around or falling over. Whilst it may fit given Kira's new savage intensity after sleeping with Flay, I personally more enjoyed the gathering of clips of Kira's various battles which was played to 'Meteor' in one of the series clip shows.

Does this special edition have problems? Certainly. Can I say it's a complete washout? Certainly not. There have certainly been worse DVDs and compilation movies then this. Returning SEED fans may enjoy it and it could be a quick way to introduce new potential fans, though certain important elements will be lost. Buy it knowing you're getting an extended and more coherent clip show with some new stuff for your trouble and you should be fine.",1121817600,11,5033,4.666290868094701
2281838,5,B0009E32LG,"Whether you have seen the original 50 episodes or not, this is an excellent disc! The original footage has a lot of the side stories cut out. It focuses more on Kira, instead of constantly shifting around, from Heliopolis, the descent to Earth, and the time in the desert. The added footage provides us with a look at the students' friendship, Flay's seduction of Kira, and Kira & Athrun's friendship. The battle scenes are well done, and there is still enough of Kira's dilemma included that you realize how he feels about the war. I am looking forward to the rest of the collection.

I thought the animation was fine, sound was good, and blu ray transfer was good (especially taking into account the age of the source material). However, the story drags. It's almost as repetitive as Voltron with the monster/mech of the week format, except Gundam actually uses different tactics every battle instead of using blazing sword every time. And Gundam has slightly more character development, which is necessary, because I wanted to smack Amuro for the first half of the series.

The picture quality is spectacular, you can almost see the cells on the painted background. I love this show and season two is probably a little better than season one. Jaburo, the Black Tri Stars, Kai's episodes, duel in Texas and of course the amazing ending are all in this set.
Not a huge Gundam fan myself but this show hits all the right notes. People knock the animation and while there is definitely poor production quality, the animation is done well. The animation is led by Yoshikazu Yasuhiko, one of the great animators of Japan who really comes into his own with this series. There is reused footage and reused cels on different backgrounds. The backgrounds themselves are the worst parts of the show, important scene backgrounds look good, but the other stuff is barebones. This season also has the better overall animation, with a fewer episodes that feel rushed animation wise.
The mech combat is heavy but its done well and has this realistic quality to it unlike most Gundam shows. This is balanced out with great characters on both sides who you can sympathize with. The saddest part is towards the end when you know some of the later characters were going to be fleshed out more before the show was canceled early.
Finally the music is awesome and well placed. So many powerful moments throughout the show that would not have been the same without the music. The dub is also quite good, the VA's all did a wonderful job.
Cant recommend this show enough for any fan of anime that miss that older, more straight forward kind of storytelling, hand painted cels and not a hint of CG or pretension.

Packaging is minimal, Which is fine with me, but I would have liked a Blu Ray sleeve to go with it, gives the packaging a little class. There is nice extra of the original crew talking about the production, but thats it I think.
Anyone who likes the visual genius behind this show should check out Crusher Joe and Venus Wars, both movies by the same guy.",1464307200,,2051,4.601092896174864

I'm also giving this 5/5 stars due to the quality of the format, audio, and video quality. Being able to watch this classic in such high-definition is truly worth the price.

The final episodes are something special, because I never saw the last 3 episodes air in the US (possibly due to content or time schedule for the network), and until now it was only the Trilogy that had the last parts.

Considering that older version on DVD is out of print, this was the best choice for me. Yes, this new version also has a DVD format, but it seemed to make more sense in my case to get the best quality available at the time of release. My hope is that other series following will be released in BluRay format such as 08th MS Team, 0080 War in the Pocket, 0083 Stardust Memory, and Zeta Gundam which are all out of DVD print now.

Simple and straight-forward menu, not clunky or confusing to navigate.
Superb and clean English and Japanese audio. (English is the same version released on television in the US in the 2000's)

Subtitle font could have been a little better, but not a deal breaker by any means.
*Edit*: Episode 14.5 (15 in JP) ""Cucuruz Doan's Island"" is still missing, likely due to the North America release cut of this episode. This episode is pretty much impossible to find, but doesn't cut that much from the overall storyline.

While there is instances of DNR, the video looks very crisp and clear. It also includes the lossless japanese track in mono and english dub track in stereo. I will also point out that on my BD player, despite it being region A, told me that it was locked for me. I don't know why it was telling me this, but I later found out I could just get around it by hitting the top menu button on my remote. It's very odd, as when i put it in my Desktop and Laptop's Blu-Ray drive, it never popped up there, and it showed the logos like it normally would.

VIDEO:

The video quality is amazing! This is the first time the series is available in high-definition in North America. The colors are vibrant, the image is pretty smooth, as it has been DNR'd, but over all it's a 8.5/10)

No, this is no an upscale, this is an all-new transfer from the 33MM film prints done in Japan. The Japanese released the complete series on 9 discs(about 5-6 episodes per disc), and it seems like Sunrise will be releasing it on 4 discs(about 10-11 episodes per disc) for North America. I compared by Japanese box set to this version and I couldn't see any differences in compression or any artifacts introduced. I can't complain thought! The Japanese set was about 500-600 dollars, while the USA version will end up being under $100 dollars for the complete series( although the USA version is a ""budget"" release, the quality is identical to its Japanese counterpart).

AUDIO:
The audio is in Linear PCM format (lossless audio) 48Hz/16-bit/1536kbps for both Japanese and English dubs (same format as the Japanese blu-ray box set).

The audio for the Japanese track is in 2.0 mono, while the English track gets a 2.0 stereo mix(the OP & ED themes are mono).

I did notice that not all of the sound effects and background music are identical to the Japanese track. Not sure if this is the same for the old Bandai DVD release. I would appreciate if anyone could confirm this.

SUBTITLES:
I believe Sunrise recycled the old BANDAI subtitles. I don't see a reason for them to waste money on a whole new translation. You get a full songs and signs track for the English dub, and you also get a full subtitle track for the Japanese dub.

EXTRAS:
Clean Opening and Ending, and Blu-Ray/DVD commercials.",1444867200,63,2174,5.485029940119761

2282210,4,B0009E32LG,"This is the Gundam that started it all way back in 1979. Overall a fantastic series and introduction to the universal century (U.C.) timeline. I've watched it through 2 times. I'll start with the bad things about the show. It is obvious the show is from the 70's when you watch it, from the animation and the sound effects, judging by today's standards it can be difficult to get past. Almost every episode has a ""freak of the week"" feel to it which can really drag out the main larger story line. The pacing is rough at times, especially in around the middle of the series before they go back out to space. Now, on to what is good about the series. There is a lot of character development and key plot points on both factions that establish a sort of framework for later series and OVAs. The series is essential for background information on the universal century. Even for the 70's, some of the space battles have quite an epic feel. The plot does a good job at showing you what each side is fighting for. We get to see the main protagonist develop from a complete amateur to practically an ace pilot by the end of the series. Surprisingly, for the 1st U.C. Gundam release in '79, there are no contradictions I noticed in this anime to later released animes in the story line, it all fits together nicely.",1415836800,,1307,4.427385892116183

However, there is yet another problem with the price tag.

Today I went on a shopping spree for Gundam series and a movie or two.  What did I get?  Disappointment.

Apparently the western audiences are just going to keep getting dicked over in the quest for greed.  I think it is a sham that these great collections are priced the way that they are.  You could buy a series of this size in America for about $50-$60 for the entire thing of any other series that is made in the west.

Why the hell are these priced so high?  Is the demand not high enough?  These are amongst the first anime shows shown in the States and have a really good following...anything over $80 is a sham and a slap in the face of loyal fans.  I guess it really is just about the money and selling toys.

2282213,5,B0009E32LG,"In 2012 Bandai Entertainment USA went out of business. Since then many bootlegs have hit the market, especially for the popular shows.

These bootlegs typically come in a clear case and are nearly indistinguishable between the retail copy. This particular series was never released with clear casing and came in a thick black box. The DVDs they're using for these are DVD-5's, meaning that the max they can put on the disc is about 4.75 Gigs while the official retail releases use DVD-9's. Due to the fact it's impossible to tell by looking at the DVD set, the only way to know for sure if you have a bootleg or retail copy is to check the disc's properties in your computer.

The only way you will know for sure that you got an official retail copy, will be:
1. If you buy *directly* from Amazon or Rightstuf. Their warehouse stock comes directly from the publisher.
2. If you buy new it will come with a security sticker.
3. The final test to see if it is legit is to put it into your computer and see if the disc is less than or greater than 4.75 Gigs. If it's greater than that, then you should be good.
Example: [...]
(note: the bootleg on the right was not an Anime Legends bootleg, so they may have copied the disc file name for these as well)

I hope you found this information useful. There's not many people who know about this and I'd hate for people to continue falling prey to buying bootlegs.

Before 1979, giant robot anime were all about unique machines fighting evil. But with Mobile Suit Gundam, things changed. Giant robots were now merely another tool of war, and the distinction between good and evil wasn't so clear (a fact many Gundam characters found out the hard way). The soldiers in this war had to figure out just what they were fighting for, and whether or not they were on the right side.

I had to learn more, so I asked a friend in Japan, the great packet capture and network analyst otaku, Megumi Takeshita, and she told me that the Gundam series was the most popular cartoon series in Japan and that while there were many versions, this original, was considered by many to be the best.

I watched and was intrenched. Then in the later episodes, there was something I didn't expect but as a devout reader of Timothy Leary's Future History Series, recognized immediately and was very pleased.

The characters in this show are very likeable (except for kai), from Amuro to Char Aznable the Red Comet.  I guarantee that if you like gundam, you will appreciate this series.

All jokes about the terrible/awesome 1979 theme song aside, Mobile Suit Gundam was a groundbreaking series which changed the future of animation for good. In Japan and also in the world.

Before this series, we had seen some flashes of the giant-mecha-robot-space animations, but nothing to capture international audiences. Fans can point out Mazinger Z (72 - 74), but though the series was amazingly popular with Japanese fans, it was little known in other countries. Gundam was hailed as the first 'real robot' series as opposed to the 'super robot' genre to which Mazinger and others belonged.

The series features Amuro Ray as the intelligent youth that ends up piloting a giant mecha in order to save his friends. It's a beginning repeated in nearly every Gundam series. In fact, Gundam SEED is more or less a remake of this series down to little details like Char's mask being used by Rau Le Creuset and the Newtypes in this being the Coordinators in SEED. Amuro is drawn into a conflict between Zeon and the Earth Federation, Zeon being a rebellious faction claiming independence from the Federation.

In watching this series I am taken aback by just how advanced the theories were for being written in the early 70s and animated in 1979. Little details are impressive, such as the little automated handles that people use to travel down halls in low gravity, the gel used to seal fissures in the hulls of ships, the shielding used for re-entry into Earth's atmosphere, the hints of early genetic engineering of humans, the advanced weapons (again - written BEFORE Star Wars - so the beam sabers were NOT based on light sabers from those films). Even White Base is an advanced spaceship type that looks like it was meant to be a giant Gundam hanger (a model used in an improved form for SEED - the Archangel).

People die in this series, and it's handled realistically. When a particular Zeon Zaku falls into the atmosphere, the pilot pleads with Char to save him. Char responds that there is nothing they can do, it's already too late, and salutes the soldier for his efforts towards stopping Gundam. Then melting occurs. Or in another scene Char is furious because he 'lost 8 good men already'. It's not in line with some other series where the death toll is either extreme or nonexistent. Though I will say that in episode 2, those guys with the laser rifles trying to shoot Char must be extras from the upcoming GI Joe series - 10 or 20 guys all shooting at Char and NOBODY can hit him! But other than a few goofy moments like that, the fighting is somewhat realistic in a science fiction sense. Amuro brings his Gundam around between the sun and the enemy in one scene in order to gain a surprise attack; in the same scene, White Base cannot fire on Char's flagship because the Core Fighter is in the way.

Why should you watch this 30+ year old series? I would say that those saying it's too dated or that the animation is too rough merely need to look at this series with a different perspective. It is like looking at early Renaissance paintings. Yeah later paintings have more perspective and better paints and more updated themes; but watching this series is like looking at the anime version of the first artists to use perspective. In 1979 Mobile Suit Gundam broke ground never before imagined for an animated television series. The depth and complexity of the story, the plausible future situation, the technology, the imagination are all so advanced that even a new series (Gundam SEED) still uses 90% of the themes, stories, and technology and seems in line with modern science fiction theory!

Animation is dated, but impressive considering the era and the lack of technology and the restrictive budget. The series was originally unpopular even in Japan, but Bandai released models of the suits and Gunpla was born. The series received a huge revival and many sequels began to be released (Zeta Gundam and the film Char's Counterattack).

This DVD boxed set contains episodes 1 - 21 of the series, uncut with Japanese audio or the English dub. The English dub is actually not THAT bad. Brad Swaile voices Amuro, he is the voice of Light Yagami in Deathnote, which has the distinction of the ONLY anime I have seen where I overwhelmingly prefer the English dub to the Japanese original. But the Japanese audio is the true way to watch the series. It just seems to fit. But whichever way you watch, it is enjoyable.

Flawed show? Yes. But a piece of history and nostalgia that any mecha anime fan needs to see. I highly recommend it!",1349222400,,4687,4.7003654080389765

The dvd case is the same size as a normal dvd, not a thicker case. The art on the dvds themselves are neat as well. As far as the content, it's pretty bareboned. Basically only play all, scene selection, setup, and extras. Not many extras to speak of. Also, their is no music during the menus. It's just completely silent, which I thought was odd. Couldn't they have just put the gundam theme in?

2282289,4,B0009E32LG,"*Audio*
First, the audio options are Japanese mono and English stereo. I was hoping for Japanese stereo myself, but I can understand that because the series is so old, they could not mix the mono into stereo or chose not to do so. Also, I did not have a chance to watch all of the episodes with both audio options, but I scanned through the episodes with the English stereo audio after reading some of the reviews here. After going through 3 DVD sets, I've come to the same conclusion. Bandai Entertainment messed up the first 4 episodes with English mono, but then fixed the other episodes with English stereo. What other reviewers said about the English audio not being consistent (in other words, audio plays in the other speakers, then breaks up, then returns, or the audio is low in parts of the episodes and high in others) may be true, but I didn't really look into that. I noticed some evidence of this, but I didn't look into it specifically. When I brought this up to Bandai Entertainment to get their thoughts on the matter, they responded very slowly, possibly because of the recent changes to their company here. But that's no excuse. They took close enough to a month to respond. Good thing I returned my defective product in the 30 day window once I learned what was going on with Bandai Entertainment. Although nothing changed, so that was a bummer. Here's the part of their response that might interest you. ""In regards to your situation we had a third party quality control company check the particular problem you were having on your disc and according to their report they have not seen this happen on [their] end. We will have them check the disc one more time and see if the problem can be replicated."" I would advise you to check your DVD set for these issues with the first 4 episodes in English stereo and see if you get the same problem. It would help to test out the audio in your DVD set with a surround sound system. It would probably be very hard to test the audio with TV speakers. I got this collection primarily for the Japanese audio, but I liked the English dub as well, and it's a shame it has this technical problem. Maybe this problem does not exist in all of the DVD sets, but after going through three of them, I'm not getting a fourth. Only if Bandai Entertainment will replace it, but I'm not spending a penny more for this, for shipping or any other part of the return process. I don't mean to sound like I'm rambling, but I waited almost two months now to do this review to let others know what I found out on my own. Maybe they're blowing my off with their ticket system because I'm the only one complaining. Maybe if others reported the same problem, they would take it more seriously and fix it. I will probably get the Complete Collection II in the hopes that it doesn't have the same error, but I will be really mad if it does. Hope this helps people interested in buying the DVD set as well as others who have already bought it.

*Video*
I did not notice any issues with the DVDs sticking in places and/or chapters, but I did not check this out extensively. The audio for the opening and ending is in Japanese mono whether you're watching in Japanese mono or English stereo. The text in the opening and closing (not the subtitles) is the original Japanese text, not the English dub text from Bandai Entertainment if you own/owned earlier DVD (maybe VHS?) releases. The opening and ending have subtitles.

*Packaging*
The DVD case is normal DVD case size, with four DVDs inside that contain 6 episodes in the first disc and 5 episodes in each of the other three discs. Here is someone's video of it. [...]

*Extras*
No special features like character/mobile suit encyclopedias or anything similar, just credits and trailers for other Bandai Entertainment shows.

*Final Thoughts*
I'm a big Gundam fan, and a recent fan of the Universal Century Gundam series. This would be the best release of this series in the US if this audio issue was not present. So if you can live with this error, or only care about the subbed version of the series, then you should be fine. I will update this if Bandai Entertainment ever responds to my consistent and unpleasant results.",1329004800,6,4212,4.5236220472440944

2282350,4,B0009E32LG,"Ten years after it's initial release in America, the original Mobile Suit Gundam finally gets a re-release on DVD. So how does this new set hold up? Pretty well actually.

For those who aren't familiar with the series, the story follows the war between the Earth Federation and Principality of Zeon. During a particular attack on Side 7, a civilian named Amuro Ray quickly becomes the pilot of the new Federation mobile suit, the Gundam. What makes this series hold up so well over the years is the cast; characters like Amuro and Char Aznable, Zeon's ace pilot, have become engrained in anime culture and it's understandable. This set contains the first 21 episodes which follows Amuro and the White Base crew through numerous enemies and obstacles which leaves the viewer hungry for more by the time they reach the end of this set.

The video is based on the 2007 Japanese R2 DVD's and the result is fantastic, this is the best the show has ever looked here in America. While the animation may turn some people off, it ultimately pays off and specific scenes like anytime Amuro and Char fight each other look amazing.

As for the audio, it's a mixed bag. One of the big selling points of this new release is the inclusion of the original Japanese track which was absent from the initial DVD's. For a show that's over 30 years old, the Japanese version sounds great. It's a treat to hear the original sound effects and performances that makes this series so memorable. This release also contains the English dub from 2001 which in of itself is a good dub on its own. The downside is though is that there are several instances where the audio is out of sync, especially during the battle scenes, which can be jarring. I prefer listening to the Japanese version but I can see why this maybe a problem for fans of the dub so that's disappointing.

Another thing to note is the fifteenth episode, labeled over the years as the ""missing"" episode, is still omitted from this release. I wasn't giving my hopes up but it's unfortunate since it's omission also throws off the original episode count. This may not be a big point for some but it's still an unfortunate loss.

Overall, this release is the best the original series has had in America and likely to be in the future. Despite some issues with the English audio and the exclusion of the ""missing"" episode, it's great to finally see and hear the original Japanese version that created the franchise we know and love. Definitely recommended if you're a fan of Gundam.",1314921600,38,2517,4.634529147982063
2282351,4,B0009E32LG,"In the tradition of the original Mobile Suit Gundam that made three films with footage from the series, ultimately re-telling the story with a few new things added the Seed story now gets the treatment. The Empty Battlefield covers episodes 1-21 of the Gundam Seed series.

I first watched this to determine if I'd be interested in the series or not and one of the reasons why my rating is a tad higher than most is because it really reels you in if you haven't experienced the story yet. After watching the series I felt I should view this again before reviewing it and now I can understand some of the negative comments.

To start off the animation is so much better than in the series, especially in the new scenes or the re-done scenes. A new song not heard in the series, Zips by T.M. Revolution is featured and I really loved it. Naturally in the process of making this entire episodes were cut, cutting the whole Battle of Artemis and the Archangel going there in the first place to try to get resupplied was one of the few things I understood getting rid of. The only relevant thing that came out of that was learning that many within the Earth Forces, particularly the top brass are just plain prejudiced against Coordinators and down right cruel. That however is expressed later in the next movies. The only characters that I felt were well represented were Kira Yamato naturally being the main character and his two love interests, Lacus Clyne and Flay Allster. Everyone else could've been dealt with a lot better. The most popular new scene added was the sex scene with Kira and Flay inserted between Kira fighting for the first time in the dessert with the Strike Gundam. I could live with it or without it, but I love hearing the song Zips during the battle. It made it more exciting to watch.

The main problem I had with this feature was the time length. The third Mobile Suit Gundam Movie was Two and a half hours at least. They could've at least inserted more clips to help the transition between certain scenes better like Kira first finding Lacus's life pod and shooting down the mobile suit searching for it to prevent the Archangel being discovered by ZAFT or Kira's four friends puting on the Earth Forces uniforms and first helping out, doing their part like Kira. It also wouldn't have hurt to show things like Rau Le Creuset taking his blue and white bills to help forshadow certain things about his character. That way it wouldn't have felt like things about his character came out of nowhere in the later films. Going further more scenes could've been shown period with Captain Ramius, Mu La Flaga and Natarle Badgiruel. That way Ramius and Mu La Flaga kissing in the second film wouldn't have seemed out of nowhere. I said Natarle Badgiruel because she was one of my favorite characters. Since we hardly see her it would've been nice to see her clash with Captain Ramius more like in the series, being the sole voice of dissent and all.

Many other reviewers commented on the lack of footage featuring Kira's four friends Sai, Miriallia, Tolle and Kuzzey. The only scene I felt that was neccessary to convey the friendship between Kira and his friends was when Tolle spoke for all of them by defending Kira to the Archangel crew when they first learn he's a Coordinator. Just having Tolle raise his arms in front of Kira which we do see in the movie didn't cut it.

Athrun Zala I felt was handled badly for the most part, so no surprise his three comrads Yzak, Dearka and Nicol got the shaft. Yzak didn't come off Hot-headed enough nor Dearka passive enough. We see Rau Le Creuset asking Athrun, ""Will you shoot it down or be shot down?"" Still Athrun telling Rau Le Creuset earlier that if Kira wouldn't join them he'd shoot him down himself should've been featured to. Other things like Kira asking Athrun if he used to hate the whole idea of war then why was he with ZAFT could've been shown as well.

I really felt most of episode 18 should've been featured when Andrew Waltfeld burned down the village of the desert rebels and they in return seek revenge. It really gave us a lot of insight into Cagalli's character. Also we would've seen Kira's first fight with Waltfeld. In the final battle they really should've shown more of it, particularly of the rebels getting defeated. Mind you I'm a little biased since the Dessert Tiger Saga is one of my favorite parts of Gundam Seed.

This movie as well as the others the hatred of the purist (Blue Cosmos) Naturals is expressed well, but the moderate perspective wasn't portrayed at all. Many Naturals are simply jealous of Coordinators because they can do more things and faster. That's why I didn't like that they kept out all of Sai's realtionship with Flay, ultimately making him jealous of Kira for starting things up with her. Sai attempting to pilot the Strike Gundam as well as Kira subdueing Sai when he confronts Flay were both powerful scenes. I also liked when Sai questioned whether the reason why Lacus Clyne sang so good was because her genes were tampered with in front of Kira, but that wasn't featured either.

Unfortunately, it just seemed to be a compilation of several episodes from the series. Since I already own the first six discs of Gundam Seed, I was a little dissappointed.

2282354,4,B0009E32LG,"I was led to watch this because I wanted more of Gundam seed and I hadn't really started watching destiny, I needed something to watch. This DVD has some pretty cool new songs, new scenes made just for the film and of course, plenty of action. Despite the fact that this DVD is pretty cool in terms of the new scenes inserted just for this purpose, it's not as good as the series was. However, it is a good movie to watch if you didn't understand the series or if you're waiting for destiny to come out. The new scenes are worth watching and the rest of the series is continued in the second movie.
There is nothing bad about this DVD,it has language settings, extras, new songs, scenes and more information on some of the more minor characters. I felt that in the begining of Gundam Seed that there weren't enough scenes with Athrun, Miguel and Rusty to make you feel Athrun's pain, but this DVD fills in those few gaps and answers most of the questions you may have form the series. Watch this DVD and see if you want to watch the series, or if you've already seen it, watch and see the new scenes, this DVD has some pretty cool scenes and explains half of the series in about an hour.
Even though it does add some deatail to the series that wasn't there before, it still doesn't have enough new scenes and cool features to get five stars. It lacks some of the details some Gundam Seed fans may have been looking for. This DvD is good but it doesn't go the mile or have enough unique qualities to receive five stars. I was slightly disapointed when I saw it.

The main character, Amuro is a whiny teenager who compared to other series Gundam pilots is terrible. He complains more than Kira Yamato, at one point he wasn't just a deserter, he stole the Gundam. And he's cold as ice to his supposedly close friend, Fraw. Little children are allowed to run around the bridge of the ship like it's a playground. Characters die and really it's hard to care because you didn't know them, and they really didn't matter either. In most cases, I found Zeon characters to be more interesting than the Federation characters.

I suggest watching these episodes, then Part 2, and moving onto Zeta, Double Zeta (ZZ), Char's Counterattack, and then Unicorn. And if you want to like I did, you can get insight from watching the other UC 0079 anime such as 08th MS Team, War in the Pocket (lots of people like it, but it gave me a ""what now"" kind of feeling), and Thunderbolt. Origin is good too, and I watched the first Origin film and 08th MS Team with this almost simultaneously. After watching this series though, although people recommend it, I don't recommend watching the subbed only movie trilogy. The pacing is much more realistic in these episodes and Part 2 of course (same show), and I recommend watching it dubbed since it IS OUR VERSION. Watching it in Japanese is fine though, but if you want to actually see the visuals and watch the uncut show that is marketed to us, the dub most certainly delivers. If you know Japanese like I do, watch it in that language too, or watch it back and forth. The language tracks are both pretty good.
