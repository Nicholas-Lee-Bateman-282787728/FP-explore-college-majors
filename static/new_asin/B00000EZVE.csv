1199638,5,B00000EZVE,"I just saw this movie for the first time. It has a good musical score, decent script and acting. Reeves is great in this role. He looks like a Greek God. For you guys attacking the acting skills and story plot, do you really think Arnold is  a good actor and has mind dazzling plots? Let's get real already! This is actually two movies in one: first, the Labors of Hercules and his role as master of arms for the King of Jolco then the adventure of Jason and the Argonauts and the Quest for the Golden Fleece. Reeves outmuscles Kevin Sorbo by leaps and bounds and has a charisma better than Arnold. I became a fan of Reeves recently by reading his book; ""Building the Classic Physique."" As Hercules, Reeves displays the classic physique. Easy to see why he was a former Mr. America and Mr. Universe. And his book is great. I believe that this is the best natural bodybuilding, conditioning and toning book out there. Great for men and women. My Dad has been a big  fan of Reeves for along time. Looking forward to seeing more of his movies. If you haven't watched Hercules with Steve Reeves, do, you'll love it just like I did. Good movie. Reeves is appealing to men and women alike, bodybuilders and the general public. It's easy to see why he was so popular in his day. I heard that President John F. Kennedy and Winston Churchill enjoyed his movies as well. I know I did. Watch it. You'll love it. And if you can get a copy, I recommend his great book ""Build The Classic Physique""RIP MR. REEVES and thank you for leaving us your movies and your wisdom to inspire.",983750400,17,1566,4.378006872852234

Splendid cinematography, keeping in line with the mythological plot, and casting a crew who really act like they're part of the story.  Several of the films in this collection easily rise above the generic criticism of the swords and sandals genre.

These were mostly television pictures, or so I've read, but they aired during my childhood, and we didn't have a TV in the house.  Consequently, the are all new to me.  These films appear to have all been produced before I was born, while the flamboyant production of Hercules Against the Sons of the Sun, blazes with primeval dance and music and costumes like I'd expect from Cecil B. De mile.  It's quite a spectacle.",1449100800,3,1435,6.185929648241206

1199675,5,B00000EZVE,"I remember this well from when I was a kid. All kids growing up need heroes and Steve Reeves sure was one. I am a retired police sergeant and a highly decorated combat veteran of Vietnam 68/69 1st Air Cavalry Div. I admire Reeves and Gordon Scott very much because they both served their country during WWII. Reeves was a Staff Sgt with the 25th Inf Div in the Pacific theater of operations and Scott was a Drill Instuctor in the Army for Hand to Hand and Firearms training. Of course being a Black Belt in Judo helped too. They both did their own stunts, that is until Reeves severely injured his shoulder but did as much as he could. They remained good friends until Reeves' death from heart problems. Scott even stayed at Reeves ranch for a while when he was down on his luck. I guess that time is gone too, when friends helped friends out!! But all my grandkids love these movies as much as I did when I was a kid.",1429056000,2,918,4.251428571428572

1199678,5,B00000EZVE,"I bought this collection for the sole reason of completing my Steve Reeves collection. The movie  ""The Trojan Horse"" is a bit confusing, the conquered are walking among the conquerors walking in on each others camps, till you get to the fabled ""Trojan horse"" scene and all hell breaks loose. But I enjoy watching Steve's physique, I watch his movies while I work out at home, so overall I'd recommend it.",1419033600,2,404,4.690140845070423
1199679,3,B00000EZVE,"Here was a release that I was greatly anticipating because it was being released by Timeless Media/Shout Factory.  They were responsible for one of the best collections 'THE BEST OF SPAGHETTI WESTERNS' which had 20 movies on 10 DVD's in their original aspect ratios available for a great price.  Now they announced 6 titles of the Sword and Sandal genre a few of which are available for the first time.  The bad news is that  the six films are on two discs three to a disc and that they are full screen and flat as pancakes.  A warning sign should have been the cover of the set being very deceptive showing actor Steve Reeves in Hercules pose but is only featured once in the collection and the only non Hercules film in the set ,Director Giorgio Ferroni's 'THE TROJAN HORSE' aka 'LA GUERRA DI TROIA'-1961 .  For those who do not care about the way their films are presented, you will be very happy in that the quality of the films are excellent with great color and nary a speck or scratch in sight.  The beauty of the images, however, are lost in the pan and scan frenzies that follow and some of the power of the films are greatly diminished because of it.  Although the rarity of some of these titles is apparent. the set is  probably the best we are going to get for now.  For those who need to know the content of the set :  Disc One has the 'TROJAN HORSE' ; Director Carlo Ludovico Bragalia's 'THE LOVES OF HERCULES' aka 'GLI AMORE DI ERCOLI' aka 'HERCULES VERSUS THE HYDRA'-1966 featuring the husband and wife team of Mickey Hargitay and Jayne Mansfield who has a dual role; and Director Alberto De Martino's 'MEDUSA AGAINST THE SON OF HERCULES' aka 'PERSEO L'INVINCIBILE'-1963 featuring Richard Harrison which really loses its beauty due to the flatness of the image.  Disc two has Director Giorgio Ferroni's 'THE CONQUEST OF MYCENAE' aka 'ERCOLE CONTRO MOLOCH'-1964 featuring Gordon Scott ; Director Alberto De Martino's 'THE TRIUMPH OF HERCULES' aka 'IL TRIONFO DI ERCOLE'-1963 featuring Dan Vadis; and Director Osvaldo Civirani's 'HERCULES AGAINST THE SONS OF THE SUN' aka 'ERCOLE CONTRO I FIGLI DEL SOLE'-1964 featuring Mark Forest. It is a shame that Timeless Media did not put the effort as they did in their previous collection in tracking down the widescreen versions. In this period of Streaming and Blu-ray perfectionism , why release yet another set of TV pan and scan prints onto the fans which shows the contempt for the product.  For Sword and Sandal completists only.",1413504000,12,2492,4.6880733944954125

1199706,2,B00000EZVE,"I bought this nicely priced set at a retail store for $15. I took a chance on it because it was distributed by Image Entertainment/Retromedia and I have never had a bad disc by these companies. I however hate to say it but at about the 16.20 mark on Hercules, Prisoner of Evil the film stutter skipped and then froze. I tried it on 3 different DVD players, a portable DVD player and my laptop and got the same problem. I got a replacement and it did it again. My third copy just stutter skipped but did not freeze but what made it worse is that the audio was out-of-sync for the rest of the film. Sick of dealing with the problem I just got my money back. The clerk at the retail store said they have been getting a number of returns on this set and are actually thinking about taking it off the shelf (!?!). I don't know if this is widespread problem but talking to friends and relatives that also have bought the set I have found that theirs at least had the stutter skip.

For the price of this set it is still worth it to many as it is only one film in the set that is defective. Still I just want to warn you that you will likely get a set that has a bad stutter skip in Hercules, Prisoner of Evil or worse it freezes.",1241654400,25,1223,4.053719008264463
1199707,1,B00000EZVE,These are re-releases of the previous RetroMedia titles. Image Entertainment now handles the RetroMedia line. Sad to say all 4 discs are the exact same discs that have been available before. Quality is sadly lacking.,1236211200,25,216,5.2
1199708,2,B00000EZVE,"I was REALLY excited about this release, until I started to go into the details. (1) A Hercules set WITHOUT Hercules Unchained, this has been crying out for an anamorphic transfer for donkeys' years. It's great if the other titles are in 2:35:1, and if Unchained was there, I would have bought it just for that, but alas, it was not to be and (2)a small point, the cover art is actually from Goliath and the Barbarians, which is NOT in the collection. I'm afraid I'll have to pass, it's a pity Image couldn't have tried a little harder on this one, it really would have been worth the effort.",1233878400,16,592,4.390909090909091
1199709,4,B00000EZVE,"Image Entertainment has released the HERCULES COLLECTION, a four-disc DVD set with various Hercules movies, some I have seen and others I haven't heard of & will be watching. My review might not be all that helpful since I haven't seen all of these movies but I can at least comment on what I have seen. I will also say that you really have to be a die hard 1960s Hercules or Sword & Sandal fan to really like every single one of them. None of them are all time classics, but a few do stand out as better than average & can be a lot of fun to watch. Some of them that I have seen (not in this set) can be really slow/tedious viewings, heavy on film padding for 100 minute running times. These can be a little overlong with too much dialog and not enough action. I like the ones where Hercules battles a monster. The English dubbing is ok for the most part although it would be cool to have English subs as an option.
Here is the list of movies in this set..
HERCULES - this is the one with Steve Reeves - not bad - this is better than a lot of the follow ups & offshoots. Hercules goes on a long journey, loses his powers,meets up with Amazon women, fights a monster that sounds like Godzilla for the Golden Fleece. This one had a lot more adventure/good plot than later entries and they seemed to try with this , since it was the first of the whole Hercules series of movies. It isn't bad at all. All things considered,it is decent. This was an MST3K experiement,which was a good episode but the movie was heavily cut so it was hard to follow. I can watch this with or without the MST treatment.
MOLE MEN AGAINST THE SON OF HERCULES - This has Maciste fighting Mole People all throughout the movie non stop. The Mole People are laughable people wearing white with a Christopher Lloyd as Dr Emmett Brown (Back to the Future ) hairdo. It isn't bad when you are in the mood for some campy Hercules related movie. Full frame, looks like a VHS quality print.
HERCULES THE AVENGER - I haven't seen this one , but heard it has stock footage of other Reg Park as Hercules movies
HERCULES AND THE BLACK PIRATE - never heard of this one
HERCULES AND THE CAPTIVE WOMEN - I did a review on this one before and this one is a favorite of mine, very entertaining as Hercules sleeps a lot and had goofy looks on his face. That aside, he fights a monster called Proteus and an army of blond haired men led by Fay Spain. This was paced pretty well and was a decent fantasy - Reg Park as Herc. Fun to watch either in an MST3K or non MST3K format. It is what I would call wild and wooly..
HERCULES, PRISONER OF EVIL - This one was also ok, a little above average. This one Herc (Reg Park) becomes a werewolf..a witchcraft story.
HERCULES AND THE PRINCESS OF TROY - this one was a 1 hour pilot I believe - Herc battles a really cool looking sea monster - but he is not on screen long enough. The monster saves the movie and Herc saves the people from the monster.
ATLAS IN THE LAND OF THE CYCLOPS - this one I found to be really dull where Atlas fights a one eyed monster - it is a tedious going until the fighting at the end.
GIANTS OF ROME - I don't think Ive seen this one.
There are reviews of these titles all over the web. Now that I have this set I can tell you these are all the same exact releases from Retromedia put together to make one box set. This is basically a double dip. There is nothing new to report other than Retromedia released these as singles a few years ago - so if you own those, you can either hold on to them or go for the box set at a great price..
Die hard Herc fans will love this set, and I think those on the fence wondering if they should buy it should actually give it a try. Some are good, some aren't,but the price for all of these movies make this a bargain even it is a double dip. If you don't own them all and want to have them in a cool box set, here is a chance to own a lot of Hercules movies for a low price",1231891200,9,3933,4.063063063063063
