5024005,5,B006WK4YB8,"Dragonheart is one of my favorite dragon movies (the other 2 are Dragonslayer and Reign Of Fire, which is out on BD). This new Universal BD appeared marginally improve over the old Collector's Edition DVD. Picture details improved slightly, but color appear muted. Audio wise, the 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio did offer some improvement with better clarity. Directional sound is good, especially with scenes when Draco flying around! Explosions also appear forceful enough.

It offer the same set of Bonus Features as the Collector's Edition DVD. No new bonus feature. This BD started by playing the Universal 100th Anniversary Celebration trailer (over internet connection, so it may skip if you have poor Internet connection), followed by the movie. No Startup Menu. Access Setup and Bonus Features by pressing the Pop-up Menu button (Instruction is given before start of movie). I'm not sure why Universal fall back to the old Warner BD system of no Startup Menu. Guess this catalogue title is not high on their list, judging by the mastering. And no 100th Anniversary Digibook treatment!

Anyway, still worth the upgrade for fans!",1334102400,2,1129,5.163934426229508
5024006,5,B006WK4YB8,"Dragonheart is one of those rare gems from the early days of CGI effects, when the new technique still offered so much promise, before it became so commonplace and over-used that audiences have come to resent it, and, like Jurassic Park, the work done in this film was and remains spectacular. This was the first film to show us a living, breathing dragon, in a way entirely unmatched by any film before or since.",1332892800,2,413,4.594594594594595

5024010,5,B006WK4YB8,"Love the movie. Only complaint I have (and it's not a big one) is that I bought the multi-format on purpose, however I only received the blu-Ray disk. I was expecting that and DVD copy (although I understand sometimes it can be blu-ray and digital copy)",1464393600,,253,4.521739130434782

5024015,4,B006WK4YB8,"The movie didn't age all that well, and the higher definition definitely shows off the flaws in the CGI, but the story is still pretty fun. Dragonheart has, for a long time, been one of my favorites.  I gained a love of dragons and their lore from this movie.  Yes, that's why my nick on here is Dragon-related.  It's not a classic that must be seen, but I still think anyone who checks it out will be pleasantly surprised.  The acting isn't amazing, but it's definitely good.  The effects at the time were actually pretty amazing, and it's a nostalgic favorite of mine.",1458518400,,570,4.495145631067961

5024021,5,B006WK4YB8,"Loved this film since I first saw it in the theater, and it's still fun. As the voice of the dragon, Sean Connery seems to parody himself, which makes it all that more endearing. Good action, lots of good vs evil, and justice at the end. Great film for kids.

The Blu enhances the colorful settings, costumes, etc., and you're in for a fun ride. Always good to see David Thewlis, Pete Postlethwaite and the enigmatic Julie Christie. Dennis Quaid, as always, is solid.",1435017600,,467,4.559523809523809

5024029,5,B006WK4YB8,"This is a fun movie, though a little violent for younger kids. The best part is Draco the dragon. Draco IS Sean Connery, right down to the facial expressions.

8505649,4,B006WK4YB8,"Ive seen plenty of movies and TV shows depicting dragons over the years. One of those films was DRAGONSLAYER back in the 1980s. That dragon was one that made me believe the creature existed; spitting flames and all that. But I have never seen a dragon like Draco in DRAGONHEART. This dragon is almost entirely CGI in every scene. And in most scenes where he is alongside Dennis Quaid, Pete Postlethwaite, and the other actors he always seems to be the right size in scale. The moment he appears on screen you believe in the dragon 100%

Ive also seen dragons talk, mostly in cheesy TV cartoons, but if you are going to have a dragon talk in an actual live movie and have him interact with human actors I cant think of a better actor to cast than Sean Connery. And were not talking about just giving him the voice. The FX team at ILM who did Draco have perfectly synced this dragons facial movement to Connerys. It was no surprise to me that Connery was videotaped and studied closely while he was recording the voice.

The story is set in 984 AD. Dennis Quaid is Bowen: a knight who was raised to believe in The Old Code: a noble creed of honor, virtue, and courage. He is teaching sword fighting and this code to a kings son: Prince Einon. The king is a sadistic and evil ruler who has gripped his kingdom in fear, tyranny, and bloodlust. When his hatred causes a rebellion of his kingdoms peasants he is soon brought to the end and killed in a fight. At the same time Einon is critically injured. His mother Queen Aislen (Julie Christie, of all people) knows there is one hope. She takes him to the cave home of a dragon, asking for his aid. The dragon makes the boy promise not to continue his fathers evil tyranny and gives him a part of his heart.

Einon turns out to be crueler than his father. Bowen is enraged and thinks the dragon poisoned the boys heart. He makes a vow to hunt down this dragon and spends the next twelve years killing every single one of them until it boils down to Draco. The year is now 986. Einon (David Thewlis) rules his kingdom with an iron fist, and has had a new castle built by peasants who have become slaves. One of them led the rebellion against his father, who had a daughter named Kara (Dinah Meyer). Einon slays the man under a belief that death shouldnt be a punishment, but a release. Bowen soon meets up with Brother Gilbert (the late Pete Postlethwaite), who admires Bowen and the Old Code.

When the knight tangles with Draco he becomes way over his head. The duel leads to a rather neat sequence where Bown ends up in Dracos mouth with his sword against the roof. If Draco closes his mouth the sword will drive into his brain, killing both of them. Its a clever stalemate. Draco points out that this battle is completely pointless. Neither one will gain anything in victory. The two come to a compromise and start a scheme to make money off of it.

This leads to a sequence in DRAGONHEART makes an excellent demo scene for a DTS 5.1 Home Theater. Quaid is on his horse having a conversation with Draco, who is flying around. You can clearly hear Connerys voice traveling from one speaker to another. If your system has a good speaker setup and is properly calibrated Dracos voice and the flapping of his wings will be crystal clear. DTS chose it for its Home Theater retail demo DVD: a very wise decision.

Eventually, everything boils down to Einon, Draco, and the peasants in the village going up against Einon. They are joined by Kara and Brother Gilbert. However, this is not a battle that can be won by killing Einon. He is connected to Draco because of the sacrifice the dragon did. More of this I cannot say. What I can tell you is that this whole movie is in good fun with plenty of action scenes. The plot is not one you can take seriously, but I suppose it was never intended to be. But Draco goes on the list of E.T., Casper, and the dinosaurs in JURASSIC PARK as a great special effects creature. Not to mention the character benefits so much from the voice of Sean Connery.",1479686400,,4035,4.380507343124165
