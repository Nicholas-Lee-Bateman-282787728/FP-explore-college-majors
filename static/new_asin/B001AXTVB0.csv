Like watching a film through thick fog.
You don't get to see much nudity.",1327536000,3,129,4.6521739130434785
3473147,4,B001AXTVB0,great looking gals. funny situations in nice movies for winter watching. well worth the investment. lots of T&A.. thanks to Amazon and all involved..got this item in time so it must not have gone through Phoenix,1326240000,2,211,4.888888888888889
3473148,4,B001AXTVB0,"If you enjoy this type of movie,you will enjoy these. They are truly comedies, unlike the Euro collection which is more drama-(OK but not as much fun). The plots are lightweight and lighthearted (and very thin, but who cares). True there are a couple of technical flaws, but only a couple and they are short. Indeed in one movie the screen actually goes dark for what seemed like 15-20 seconds, but don't panic the picture resumes and the fun continues! Enjoy! For the price you certainly get your money's worth.",1312156800,6,512,4.7
3473149,2,B001AXTVB0,"As a man who has enjoyed the new-found popularity of old grindhouse and sexploitation films, I have to say that the films were excellent examples of German sex comedies.  As is typical, the humor is often juvenile but the nudity is far better that you would ever see in it's American counterparts.  People rarely buy these for the subtle humor, right?  With that being said, I was highly disappointed in the transfer quality.  I am not looking for anything perfect, with these films not exactly deserving of the full shine and polish, but some effort should have been made to reduce the skips and jumps.  There are three or four times that you can see tracking errors from the original shoddy VHS that these were pulled from.  These actually obscure the picture in several places and some jumps can be seen.  I am guessing that the studio never watched the final product....
Otherwise these are fun and sexy, (if not particularly memorable) films.",1286409600,29,947,4.773006134969325

8280036,5,B001AXTVB0,"Pour yourself a stein of Spaten, sit back relax and enjoy the well forested scenery and atmosphere of lovely Bavaria. In the 2-disc ""Bavarian Sex Comedy Collection"" we got 4 films from the prime days of the German sex-comedy. On disc One: first up, from 1974 ""Auf der alm, da gibt's koa sund"" (""There's No Way to Sin In the Alpine Meadows"") AKA ""Bottoms Up"" and directed by Franz Josef Gotlieb. It featured the beautiful flaxen-haired Alena Penz as 'Sally' and luscious Eva Garden as 'Claudia'. It was supposedly one of the most successful films of this genre in Germany. The story was about a stolen formula (that could turn cow dung into gasoline, this was around the time of the Oil Crisis) and a male and female spy (Alena Penz) team, who were hot on its trail that led them to the scenic alpine countryside. The film was all campiness and hilarious jokes with plenty of rigorous chalet and alfresco activity! The frauleins were very pretty and not at all shy about their natural state of undress. I gave this one 4 stars. 80 mins.

Help yourselves to a second helping of Schweine-Schnitzel and potato dumplings, cause it only gets better with our second feature! ""Liebesjagd durch 7 betten"" (""Love Hunt Through 7 Beds"") AKA ""I Like the Girls Who Do"" from 1973 was directed by the father of the German sex-comedy Hans Billian. This randy tale was about a young uninitiated stud ('Thomas' played by Gunther Ziegler) who had to bed his late uncle's 7 girlfriends in 7 days in order to get his inheritance. Once again it featured the lovely Alena Penz as 'Sigrid'. This one was easily my favorite in the bunch, the Bavarian female beauty on display was bountiful. The frauleins were all shapely and lovely and you had your choice of blondes and brunettes. If you're a lover of the 'pubis capillus' (haarige muschi), you're in for a real treat (Claudia Fielers as 'Nicole', she was also in ""Fraulein In Uniforms"")! These healthy southern German specimens are sure to give you a specific muscular discomfort of alpine proportions, maybe it's time to reach for the Jagermeister to help you digest a tasty meal of black forest ham or wild boar for that matter! I gave this one 5 knockwursts! 79 mins.

Our third feature ""Ein echter hausfrauenfreund"" (""A Housewife's Best Friend"") AKA ""Inn of 1,000 Sins"" from 1975 was directed by Kurt Nachmann. I didn't care for this one much, it was kind of a letdown after the first 2 features. Here we had 'Albert' (Peter Hamm), who had the enviable job of looking after the ladies at a plush hotel resort. The jokes here were on the lame side, and the frauleins not as appealing as before (at least for me). I gave this one 3 stars. 72 mins.

On disc Two: our fourth and final feature ""Die jungfrauen von bumshausen"" (""The Virgins of Bumshausen"") AKA ""Run Virgin Run"" from 1970 was also by Hans Billian. The production values were really high on this one. Once again we got a randy tale of oversexed males looking for fertile ground to plant their seed, with the lush verdant scenery of Bavaria as a backdrop! The frauleins on display here, were all exceptionally beautiful. The female nudity was plentiful and glorious to behold! I gave this one 5 strudels. 89 mins. At this point a Schnapps is in order to cap-off our appreciation for our German cultural-exchange. The dubbed voices in all the films were actually pretty funny, but I would still love to get my hands on the original German-language versions. All in all, a great time will be had by fans of the sex-comedy of the 70's. Here we got 5 hours and 20 mins. of pure entertainment. The DVD picture quality by Secret Key Motion Pictures was very good. English (dubbed) no subtitles, NTSC, NR (ignore the 'R' in the description above, these films were not rated is clearly marked on the DVD case), 320 mins. plus extras (and a pullout booklet). Auf Wiedersehen.

Love and Peace,
Carlos Romero",1337644800,14,3886,4.652110625909753
8280037,4,B001AXTVB0,"These are the movies I grew up with staying up late watching skinamax after dark, really fun set and I love it for the nostalgia factor, they are fun sexy comical movies with a real nice amount of softcore skin and for me a good deal of replay value. I also have the Eurosex collection from Secret key and this is the better set of the 2.",1329091200,4,338,4.059701492537314
