8405171,5,B003TKS7FS,"I took a great deal of time browsing the selection of Pride DVDs, and I think I made the best choice. You get to see a good variety of fights throughout a 4-year span, with big time names such as: Fedor, Wanderlei, Royce Gracie, Cro Cop, Rampage, Aoki, and many many more. If you're a Pride fan looking for a good series that is stacked from beginning to end, this is for you.",1364515200,,376,4.164383561643835
8405172,5,B003TKS7FS,"the real deal, the best promotion ever and the most glorius events from them, they are here and you should get it",1355702400,,113,4.181818181818182
8405173,5,B003TKS7FS,"well worth the price. pride is timeless to me. it was on during the time i was into mma and had all my favourite fighters. the fights and the knockouts just seemed so much more brutal in pride than they did in the ufc. add to that that shockwave was prides end of year spectacular event plus the educated japanese audience add something else to the event american fans just can't reproduce.
very highly recommended",1351123200,,414,4.533333333333333

8405175,5,B003TKS7FS,"A great mma dvd, if you want to see great mma action this is a good one to get. Remember the UFC just could not compete with Pride so they bought them out and put them under.
 Dont worry this is mma fighting not like the UFC where guys would just lay on top of each other for the entire match doing minimal fighting,with the announcers telling you how great they are. In Pride they would force the fighters to get up and fight, there isn't the politics and fixed matches that are so common in the UFC.",1309996800,2,501,4.112244897959184
8405176,1,B003TKS7FS,Don't be fooled but this is not Pride FC Shockwave Collection 2003-2006.  Both the 2nd and 4th disc are not events.  They're just extra's disc with nothing but interviews and weigh-ins.  I can't believe they would do this.  I am very dissapointed.  The first package was damaged.  I sent it back and now they sent me this and its all a load of waste.  This is Sad!,1304726400,,364,4.343283582089552
8405177,5,B003TKS7FS,This was worth every penny. It had all the matches for the Shockwave series (a few were listed in the special feaures). I received the dvd the very next day after ordering it and would recommend Amazon.com to everyone!,1298160000,,218,4.615384615384615
8405178,4,B003TKS7FS,"All of these cards are flat out amazing. Great value, great production value, the intro to these are great. Only thing that sucks, is that the '06 version was a Zuffa released DVD, and they cut out a lot of the stuff.

Would be a 5 star without that.

BUY IT NOW.",1293580800,,263,4.038461538461538
