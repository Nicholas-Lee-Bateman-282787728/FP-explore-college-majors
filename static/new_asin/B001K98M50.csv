There is plenty of action, but it wasn't too intense because I didn't care if the main character died and the series ended. All the bad guys are chumps. They are probably related since all of their noses looked like wieners hanging on the middle of their faces. They also have really stupid sounding voices. The series is kinda like James Bond, if he were a cyborg chick with mentally handicapped enemies. I found it impossible to care about this series at all. Out of the many anime series I own, this is the worst. I agree with the review that said, ""at least it was cheap"". If you pay money for this you will probably be very annoyed.",1353196800,2,812,4.313725490196078
8314464,5,B001K98M50,"When I first opened this dvd, I thought that it was going to be more light-hearted than it was. Turns out this is a seriously dramatic and tragic series, not quite as good as Casshern Sins in that department, but there are a few tear-jerker scenes. In a world 140 years from now where the Cold War never ended, Mylene Hoffman becomes a cyborg intelligence agent with enhanced speed and strength...and twin machine guns hidden in her breasts.
  Mylene is more of an assassin than a spy (there IS a difference), and her missions usually involve eliminating some double agent, enemy assassin, or whatnot. Although Mylene performs her missions efficiently, as the series goes on her work begins to take an emotional toll upon her. Many times she finds herself enforcing laws which she herself does not agree with. There is a recurring plot line about mutant humans who in her land are to be killed upon discovery.
  The art style, as well as the fashions worn by the characters, are strongly reminiscent of  the1960's. The animation is usually quite good and fluid, although this can often clash with the somewhat childish art style. This is, however, not a children's show, since there is a lot of bloody violence and strongly implied sex. Mylene winds up in bed with almost every man whom she meets, although the actual act is never shown. Plus, her machine-gun breasts would probably be a bit hard to get onto american children's tv. And there is more than a little r-rated language in this series (probably due mostly to interpretation aimed at adults). There are also a number of other female cyborgs working with Mylene, although they get way too little screen time.
  All in all, if you can overlook it's flaws, Cyborg 009-1 is quite a memorable series.",1346544000,,1756,4.756578947368421
8314465,5,B001K98M50,"From the same team that brought us Cyborg Soldier 009 and Kikaider The Animation,
009-1 is another masterpiece that show us how amazing is Shotaro Ishinomori's work even today.
The manga is from 60s, so... the drawing style is remanescent of that era, but that is not exactly
a bad thing, since every fan of Ishinomori's Style will be amazing with the efforts of Naoyuki Konno
to revitalize the original manga in a suberb mix of digital animation and all the beauty of the post-war
manga. Highly recommendable, maybe not for every anime fan, but to all who enjoys Ishinomori Shotaro as one
of the best comic artist of the 20th Century!",1254614400,,635,4.678571428571429
8314466,3,B001K98M50,"First of all even though at the end of the episodes it says 2006 the animation looks more like 1996. Some of the guys noses look like a poorly formed mans body part. Once you get past that style of anime it is just ok. Most of the episodes are stand alone but the last three tie into the first episode.
  It is a East Block versus West Block with Androids...enhanced humans with machine gun jublies. There is a bit of blood and some serious language meaning they drop the ""F"" word several times. There is a bit of action as well so it does not drag out.
 You get 2 DVDs in a Thin Pak, widescreen format and it's a solid 3 star watch but I could not recommend it.",1239580800,11,662,4.038167938931298
