The main charcater, who is known as ""Tiger"" (Bruce Locke) can not conduct a training sequence or fight in this film without wearing that silly tiger mask.  Understanding that it does hold certain value, as it belonged to his father before he was murdered, but the thing just looks darn silly in this film, and is quite a distraction and well overdone.  As for the rest of the film, its not too much better.  I bought this film mainly because Matthias Hues is in it, and is always a very good B-action villain.  This must be his only movie he is not a villain in, and also barely has any action.  As for martial arts action, there are a lot of illegal gambling fights, but moves are executed too slowly, and make the fights look too rehearsed.  Many of the fighters don't even appear to be in any good physical shape, and are even older guys.  Richard Lynch does a decent job as the greedy boss, but the lead - Bruce Locke - is nothing special.

The only thing left I enjoyed about the film, is that it takes place in Vegas, and we get too see many views of the neon city.  Tiger - who's real name is actually Chuji - arrives in Vegas and lives on the streets as a poor man.  Discovered while fighting in the back alley to protect innocents, he is asked to fight for Rossner (Lynch) to make some money.  Unlike most martial arts films with this storyline, Tiger actually accepts and does some illegal fights for Lynch, but he eventually is pushed too far when asked to kill the men he defeats.  His real motive for arriving in Vegas is finally revealed - to discover the man who killed his father years ago.  By the conclusion, we get to see that the people involved from the murder are much closer than he thought.  The movie actually doesn't officialy end, and its setup like there will be some kind of sequal - ha, fat chance.

This is a basic plot that is a little draggy, as the run time is 1 hour and 45 minutes.  It is rare that martial arts films exceed the hour and half mark.  The action is not exciting and most of the cast is bland and boring.  Matthias Hues looks golden compared to these guys, but barely has any action.  Too many martial arts films out there exceed this one by far - may want to pass this one up.",1184889600,,2258,4.231308411214953
