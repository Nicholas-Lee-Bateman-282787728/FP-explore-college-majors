7793481,2,0939069873,"The first part of the video, examining some new careers like Space Lawyer and Green Architect is very interesting.  The problem is that interviewee Marty Nemko gives some really bad advice.  For example, he suggests that you should ask about salary in the first job interview.  Um...no.  One, you should already have some idea of at least a salary range, had you already researched the company as he suggests.  Second, you run the grave risk of being percieved as ONLY being interested in the $$$$ (I've been a recruiter for over six years, and I've had a number of clients agree with me on this).  Basically, take any of this advice in this video with a rather large grain of salt.",1020384000,4,682,4.595041322314049
