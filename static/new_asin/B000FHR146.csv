8122617,5,B000FHR146,"Fantastic underrated series.  I bought this at Walmart long ago and don't know why the complete set was made available.  Surprisingly it was well written and better than the Men in Black animated series.  There are no cookie cutter characters in this series.  If you enjoy good animation and stories, it's fun for adults and kids to watch.  I just wish this show got the treatment it deserved and was not reduced to this cheap format, and unfortunately the only one available.",1428019200,,476,4.7560975609756095
8122618,5,B000FHR146,"This disc has 5 episodes from the original animated series. It is a fun series, and the characters and story are interesting. There is a running subplot thru the whole series about a secret war between two factions of alien vampires, and a leader of the good guys who can't be trusted. The ultrasecret Global Alliance is a group formed to protect the earth from aliens that have lived on Earth for hundreds of years, while trying to keep it all a secret. In the meantime earthbased creatures such as banshees, the Abominable Snowman, and other all have a role to play. Great animation in the stories, it is a shame it did not last long. There is a box set of 20 episodes that includes the 5 episodes on this disc. Search for ""Roswell Conspiracies Aliens, Myths & Legends Vol 1"", right here at Amazon. I recommend checking out the series, in style it is like a cross between Justice League and X-Files.",1293667200,3,901,4.5

8122621,4,B000FHR146,"I first found this in a bargain bin at Walmart and picked it up due to the incredibly low price. I wasn't expecting much, but it turned out to be a very entertaining cartoon. I'd rate the cartoon itself a four and a half or a five, but the DVD is lacking. There aren't any special features and there's still the commercial break network teaser in the cartoons, which is really unnecessary. Twould be great if they came out with all the episodes in a boxed set, but until then, this is still amusing.",1209686400,2,499,4.319148936170213
8122622,3,B000FHR146,"These are great stories with a new take on Roswell. Fun characters and cool aliens. I've enjoyed every story. But the production of the DVD is strictly amateur, including a TV channel icon in the corner of the screen that makes them appear just taped off TV.  The cover says over 2 hours but with 5 episodes of 22 minutes a piece, that comes to under 2 hours. Each episode is interrupted several times by an annoying commercial break announcement.  Furthermore, whenever I put in the dvd, it plays much louder than normal and has to be turned down. Nothing extra except commercials for other even lower budget dvd productions. There were allegedly 40 episodes produced. I'd like to see them all in one dvd box set, with the mistakes fixed.",1199577600,3,739,4.633587786259542
