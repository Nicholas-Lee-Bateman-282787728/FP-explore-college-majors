5256820,5,B00944V4KI,"This is the eagerly-awaited DVD version of Susie Hathaway's class in strength training for osteoporosis prevention. The DVD has all the content of Susie's class, including the valuable understanding of the scientific basis of what you're doing. I like Susie's training because it's based on scientific research, not ooga-booga, and because it's tailored especially to be safe for women over fifty who are at risk because of low bone density.

About three years ago, I fell and broke my wrist. Bone density tests showed I was on the brink of osteoporosis. Without realizing it, I had lost a lot of my strength over the years. I was tripping and often falling (which is how I broke my wrist), and suddenly I had a bleak vision of a future as an invalid. But I decided to do something, and that's when I heard about Susie's strength training class.

I enrolled, even though I'd never worked with weights before. One year into strength training, my bone density tests showed an improvement, and my strength had increased dramatically. I felt better than I'd felt in ages. I've now been doing Susie's program for over three years. Along with improved strength, which makes everything easier, my balance is so much better that I simply don't fall down any more. I'm physically stronger and more active than I was 15 years ago, and much more optimistic about my health and my future.

The women in Susie's classes have been begging her to put her program onto a DVD, and at last it's available. Now, when I can't make the class, I use the DVD. I get a great workout in my own home, with all the benefits of Susie's tips and pacing.",1351123200,121,1624,4.651567944250871
5256821,5,B00944V4KI,After doing this DVD for 2 years I had great improvement in my spine & my hips didn't get any worse. I was so excited to hear that news. All this with only 2 days a week. If you're looking for something that really works I would recommend this over any other workout.,1498867200,6,267,4.056603773584905
5256822,5,B00944V4KI,I have been using this workout video for almost one year - the longest I have ever committed to a workout routine - and feel stronger now than ever before in my life. Great instructions on how to safely complete the workout and wonderful encouragement from Susie throughout the workout. Looking forward to the release of her next video.,1494892800,2,336,4.711864406779661
5256823,4,B00944V4KI,"Love the video - it's what I was looking for. However, I wish she would talk less and continue with the workout tape. It would be nice to see actual participants - a group workout.  She suggest for first time users to do this strength training workout for at least 3 months then move on to some of her other tape workout exercises - which I plan to do. I am doing the tape 3x week, can't wait until I get my next bone density test to see if this is actually working.",1494633600,4,466,4.010752688172043
5256824,5,B00944V4KI,"I was diagnosed with osteoporosis of the hip and osteopenia of the spine.  I was devastated.  I decided to try Susie's safe strength training for Osteoporosis DVD and I am so glad that I did.  I have been working out to it for 2 months now and already feel so much better.  The back pain I had been experiencing is totally gone!  I feel so good after every workout.  So much so that I ordered her Resistance Band Training for Osteoporosis Prevention and plan to alternate the two DVDs from now on.  I highly recommend this DVD.  Because of it, I now have the confidence, strength and courage to fight this devastating diagnosis.",1494460800,5,628,4.495575221238938
5256825,5,B00944V4KI,"This is an awesome program! Exercises are very well explained & demonstrated. Susie gives extra information about props, where to obtain further information, & YES she does reply to questions you send her. I was very impressed with her & this tape. =)",1493424000,3,251,4.8604651162790695
5256826,5,B00944V4KI,Great video. Very informative,1491004800,,29,6.5
5256827,5,B00944V4KI,Super strength workout for an older woman. Very detailed instructions and information for people with shoulder or knee issues.,1490572800,2,126,5.684210526315789
5256828,2,B00944V4KI,"Purchased a few months ago and recently started using this.  Appears to be for over 50, beginners and advanced, but it has way too many difficult floor exercises for older people especially when using wood floors, and mats do not help.  Recommendation is to use a firm mattress, but that is in a bedroom, not a living area with a TV.  Unfortunately will have to give it away or toss it.",1490227200,2,386,4.408450704225352
5256829,4,B00944V4KI,"Great for people who are looking for beginning exercises and are trying to build up muscle tone, etc.  A little too slow in between exercises for me, but I really like how she comes across as a patient and knowledgeable instructor.  This lady is strong.",1489881600,2,253,4.6
5256830,5,B00944V4KI,"Just a quick testimonial on behalf of this DVD of Susie's. I have been diagnosed with borderline osteoporosis and I have been doing this workout for about 6 weeks now and tho 6 weeks isn't a very long time to begin seeing results, I think I saw some this weekend. While at my daughter's house, which has many steps in a three story house, I was going down stairs and missed the last step. I didn't fall but thinking I was on the floor already, it was quite a distance in steps! I landed with a lot of force on my left foot twisting it. I pass out easily with severe pain and this time was no exception! Ha! So as bad as I twisted it and as bad as it hurt, nothing is broken, only some swelling, soreness and bruising. I'm able to walk fine. I said all of this to say I contribute no broken bones and no worse injury to the few weeks that I have been doing her exercises. I feel like my bones were protected by stronger, healthier muscles surrounding them, protecting me from further injury due to only 6 short weeks of training. What motivation to continue this training even on days that I dread it!
Thank you Susie for your DVDs and simple instructions to help ladies my age (63) and older to get stronger, healthier bones!",1487635200,4,1225,4.239316239316239
5256831,5,B00944V4KI,"This is a wonderful workout, and Susie is a delight to watch and listen to.  I am very active and do a lot of yoga, pilates, and gym stuff, and was recently diagnosed with osteoporosis, early stages.  I am hoping this exercise series will target and strengthen bone density.  This is not a fast paced workout, but rather a slow and methodical series with/without weights.  Very thorough and I highly recommend it, for all stages of exercise levels.",1487635200,2,448,4.705128205128205
5256832,5,B00944V4KI,"As an active and fit 64 year old, I scoffed at the thought of working out to a program designed for older people.  However, I bought this dvd based on the reviews and my desire to prevent osteoporosis.  I figured I could return it if it proved to be too easy.  I was pleasantly surprised when I received an email from Susie shortly after my purchase.  She instructed me to contact her directly with NY questions or concerns regarding the workout.  However, after going through the workout the first time, I found Susie's instructions to be clear and precise.  Best of all, she does not use any annoying chatter.  It was also clear that you can customize the exercises to make them as easy or as challenging as you want.  It works the entire body and  leaves you feeling energized and strong.  I would recommend this program to anyone at any age and look forward to trying her resistance band dvd next.",1486166400,5,901,4.506172839506172
5256833,5,B00944V4KI,This is my go-to video for light weight training every week.,1484956800,,60,4.545454545454546
5256834,5,B00944V4KI,"I really love Susie's DVDs, both the one that uses weights and the one that uses bands. I'm already pretty fit and active, but I was diagnosed with osteoporosis last year. I started looking around for exercise videos that would address the needs of women in my situation and found Susie's DVDs. I've tried a few DVDs made by others, but I keep coming back to hers because they are so comprehensive, easy to adapt to a range of fitness levels, and make sense to me. I make the workout fit my fitness level by using more weight and not taking breaks during a set, such as keeping my lifting leg going the whole time instead of briefly touching the floor.  I plan on giving myself a year to work with these DVDs and then see what happens with a bone density test. I hope that she will be able to make more DVDS like these!",1484697600,5,819,4.25
5256835,5,B00944V4KI,She is truly a great teacher and have both her DVDs.  Really helps and I alternate every day different DVDs.  I exercise for an hour a day.  I have Osteoporosis and know any kind of movement helps your body.,1484179200,2,207,4.256410256410256
5256836,5,B00944V4KI,I've done a lot of exercise tapes over the years (many of which have lots of forward flexion) and I believe this workout is one of the most effective.  Even with light weights I am feeling stronger and stronger with each workout and--better still--I am not afraid of hurting my back!  I also love that the workout is under 1 hour and is very easy to follow.,1481328000,,357,4.313432835820896
5256837,5,B00944V4KI,"I really like this DVD! I'm 53 years old and I was recently diagnosed with osteoporosis and was looking for a strength training program. Something basic that a beginner can do. This fits the bill perfectly. Easy to follow and as I increase the weights I use, I can continue to benefit from it. If you already are doing strength training, this may be too basic for you.",1477699200,,368,4.426470588235294
5256838,2,B00944V4KI,too high an intensity and requires great balance and flexibility. Not for seniors or any disabled persons.,1476748800,3,106,5.294117647058823
5256839,5,B00944V4KI,"The exercises seem to be on point. They seem to the same ones that a personal trainer has you do (lunges, plank...) so I feel really good about purchasing this DVD and performing the exercises.
This is the best DVD I could find for osteoporosis.
My back feels stronger since doing them.

I wish there was another option to play the DVD for non-beginners so that I didn't have to listen to how to do the exercises. This way, I can be done quicker.

Thank you very much Susie Hathaway for this DVD. I'm very appreciative.",1475971200,3,519,4.395833333333333

5256842,5,B00944V4KI,"I've enjoyed Susie Hathaway's dvd 3 times a week for over 3 months now and my enthusiasm, and strength and suppleness, are at an all time high.  I recently  began  her bands workout and find it just as challenging.  These workouts are perfect for women with osteoporosis.  She keeps us safe and moving forward.",1466294400,,310,4.666666666666667
5256843,5,B00944V4KI,I love this workout. It is easy to follow and the reps are perfect. You might not think you will break a sweat but you do . Love it feel great afterwards.,1466121600,,154,3.84375
5256844,5,B00944V4KI,"Amazing results. The training looks easy but is much more effective than other videos. Recommend for anyone wanting to start a fitness program, or adults that have moved past the PX90 program. (means can't do PX90 any longer)",1466035200,,225,4.947368421052632
5256845,5,B00944V4KI,"I watched it today, and really love it. I just turned 63, and am taking a chair-based strength class, which uses weights/resistence bands. It's only once /week, so I need more. Your work-out is PERFECT! Thank you for thinking of us grandmoms. !",1464739200,,244,4.6976744186046515
5256846,5,B00944V4KI,This is an excellent choice for an exercise DVD if you have osteoporosis or osteopenia. I have other DVDs that claim to be safe but feature forward bends and other moves not recommended for people with bone density problems. The coaching portion of this DVD explains everything in great detail so you understand the now and whys of the routine. Susie is upbeat and encouraging and the routine is well-rounded and paced so you move safely and get benefit from your effort. I highly recommend this DVD and already feel stronger after 8 sessions with moderate weights! Do your bones a favor!,1464652800,,588,4.7745098039215685
5256847,5,B00944V4KI,Good information section before you start training.. a good workout and safe.  Easy to follow her instructions.,1464652800,,111,5.529411764705882

5256849,5,B00944V4KI,I love this DVD which I bought to increase my strength and I really love seeing that toned look in my body .,1463875200,,108,3.739130434782609
5256850,5,B00944V4KI,I have just bought the DVD 'Safe strength training for osteoporosis prevention'. I am really enjoying this and find I always look forward to doing this. Thanks for putting together those DVDs- really helpful.,1461888000,,208,5.147058823529412
5256851,5,B00944V4KI,"I was diagnosed with osteoporosis and the doctor recommended that walking would be helpful.  I also knew that I needed to strength my body and hoped it was not too late.  I purchased Susie's first safe strength dvd and became motivated and hooked.  After viewing the introduction, I followed  the 50 minute workout for a month.  I noticed I have become more flexible, energetic, and muscular.  I can pause after each set of moves and still catch up.  I graduated from two soup cans to two 3 lb. dumb bells.  I have scheduled Susie's DVD into my regimen.  I have more energy to take more  frequent walks.  In addition, my new regimen has inspired me to watch my diet and to improve my daily posture.  In about 3 months, I look forward to purchasing the next dvd--and graduating to stretch bands.  Thanks, Susie.",1461456000,4,810,4.580419580419581

5256857,4,B00944V4KI,Received a diagnosis of osteoporosis and need to change up my exercise routine to make sure I am loading the areas that need attention and that I am not engaging in movements that aren't safe for the spine. Susie Hathaway seems to know her stuff and is a pleasant instructor.  You can tell though that she used to be a school teacher - something in her tone of voice gives it away!  Deducting a star because the background music and the set were uninspiring.,1455926400,,458,4.440476190476191

5256862,4,B00944V4KI,This is good for those who prefer a slower paced workout.  I turn off the sound and just follow along according to what I feel up to doing.  The fact that I don't do it often enough is not the DVD's fault.,1451260800,,205,3.857142857142857
5256863,5,B00944V4KI,"I'm so glad I found this video! I contacted 3 personal trainers at various health clubs in my area, by email and by phone. I said I wanted help with strength training to prevent osteoporosis because I'm 58 and petite - a prime candidate for bone loss.  Nobody called me or wrote to me!  So I did some research on Amazon and found this DVD.  I think it's terrific.  Susie gives great instructions and reminders about the correct form to use, and she's very charming.  It's completely unpretentious, and Susie is not selling youth.  She's encouraging health instead.  That's a huge difference.  Something else that's amazing -- this DVD makes me want to exercise.  I highly recommend this DVD.",1450051200,6,691,4.739495798319328
5256864,5,B00944V4KI,This strength training program is exactly what I needed.  It's a safe workout and easy to follow.  I recommend it to anyone who wants to stay strong and healthy.,1449014400,2,161,4.517241379310345
5256865,4,B00944V4KI,"This dvd is nice to use alone or with other routines when I am not in a class or feel too lazy for something more intense.  I appreciated Susie's dvds much more after trying to use a ""bone smart"" pilates dvd by someone else.",1448323200,3,224,4.090909090909091
5256866,5,B00944V4KI,"This is the best DVD on osteoporosis prevention I have seen. Susie Hathaway's directions are clear and concise, yet detailed. She is inspiring, encouraging, comforting, and fun to listen to. The workout seems to go quickly and is suitable even for beginners. I just finished the first week, and so far I think it's great. Unlike other DVDs I have purchased, its moves can be performed even by those with arthritis and knee problems.  My only regret is that I didn't start this years ago, before my diagnosis. In addition to the DVD, Susie has a fantastic website with a blog and lots of valuable information. She will even respond to comments and questions in personalized email, which is remarkable. I highly recommend purchasing this DVD to improve your bone strength and balance.",1445040000,3,782,4.879699248120301
5256867,5,B00944V4KI,"It is another great exercise regime with Susie Hathaway. Just like with Susie's ""Resistant Band Training"" DVD (that I bought at the same time and that is great for times when you are travelling and still want to do exercises) it is like being in a class with her. She explains everything brilliantly while she is showing how to do it and doing it with you. In the coaching part of the DVD she explains how to adapt exercises to your individual condition. I am suffering from severe osteoporosis and have to choose which exercises I can safely do. However, thanks to her explanations I was able to choose the right ones and doing the ones that I can do has resulted in and increase in muscle strength and overall wellbeing - just in a few weeks! I always look forward to exercising with Susie Hathaway!",1443225600,4,801,4.493150684931507

5256871,3,B00944V4KI,"Nice weight DVD ~ but I gets a bit tiring the hear Susie say ""write down the weight you have used"" after EVERY move.  I have other DVDs that keep the exercises moving right along without the constant ""writing down"" after every move.",1436486400,3,232,4.395348837209302
5256872,5,B00944V4KI,I want to take a moment to thank Susie Hathaway for making a dvd for older people with osteoporosis.  So many DVD's are way too fast/advanced for the beginner....not much out there to allow people like me to begin slowly and safely.  I love your exercises and will hopefully gain strength with each session as I seek to strengthen my bones.  I have also purchase your Resistance Band Training DVD and feel sure I will be equally pleased.,1432944000,5,437,4.576923076923077
5256873,5,B00944V4KI,"I purchased this dvd since a long-term diagnosis of osteopenia recently changed into osteoporosis in the hip. At first I thought this was going to be too easy for me (active 63 year old) but it turns out that when I pay attention to doing the exercises correctly and S-L-O-W-L-Y it is just perfect for me!

Since I get bored easily I love that I don't have to do two sets of the exercises as normally required in using weights. The brief stretches in between exercises are just right. I normally do this routine 3 times a week after a walk/jog or bike ride so I don't need the warm-up. I do my own yoga stretches at the end, listening to relaxing music rather than follow Suzie's routine.

I look forward to getting her other dvd's in the future. Thanks, Suzie, for putting together a clear, well-thought out series of movements. I am hoping my next DexaScan will show improvement!",1432944000,7,881,4.5

Susie Hathaway is very knowledgeable and I feel like I am not hurting my spine as I did in many of my exercise classes.  My only complaint is
that the pace of the DVD seems like it is for someone in their 90's!!  I know that these exercises need to be very deliberate, but the tempo
of the narrative is SO painfully slow.  I still would recommend it as a great resource.",1432080000,6,511,4.462365591397849
5256876,4,B00944V4KI,"This is a well-cued routine which other reviewers say has caused changes for the better in bone density.  There is an intro section, as well as the 50-minute routine.  When you get the video, you can download a little chart documenting dates and weights for the exercises.  Time will tell as to whether I will experience any improvement in my DEXA scans.",1432080000,3,354,4.67741935483871
5256877,5,B00944V4KI,Love this video. I can do all of it and I think it's a great one for seniors like me. I use it along with others to have a variety each day. I highly recommend this one as I have osteopenia and appreciate the emphasis she puts on osteoporosis prevention. A good all around workout too.,1431907200,2,285,4.107142857142857
5256878,2,B00944V4KI,"Unfortunately, I bought this dvd several months ago and just recently used it for the first time so I'm sure I can't return it, otherwise, I most certainly would.  First of all, the quality is awful - multiple skips throughout until the latter portion of the disc just freezes  and doesn't play at all. I finally gave up and just shut it off.  Secondly, I'm 60 years old and have osteoporosis and fibromyalgia.  I walk several miles every day but have to be fairly careful with any other type of workout I try because with the fibro, I'll definitely suffer consequences from overdoing, so I try to avoid anything too intense or strenuous.  That said, this workout is just painfully slow and very basic.  She advises ""recording the weight in your journal"" after every exercise. You're not even doing 10 reps  and you're pausing between each exercise to write in a journal?  After about the third painfully slow exercise I just wanted to start screaming in frustration.  If you're 85 and never exercised, maybe this would be just what you needed, but, considering the price of this item, I found it a waste of my time and money.",1431475200,4,1126,4.646464646464646

I believe it's targeted for people over 50, with an emphasis on safety. That's why the exercises go carefully. Its purpose is to build muscle strength, balance, and better neurological pathways between brain and muscle. You increase the intensity of the workout by increasing your weights, but it's not designed primarily to pump up your heart rate.

The introductory section of the DVD describes all the moves in detail and has useful information about improving strength and balance as we age.

I try to do a little strength training every day using exercises a PT gave me. As the tape suggests, it would be good to consult with a physical therapist to get exercises specific to your needs.

The DVD is very well done. I can always hear the instructor and there are different camera angles that focus in on the moves. I'm very impressed with the shoulder blades and upper back exercises. I have never seen these before, and I've taken many exercise classes and used exercise DVDs. Strengthening these muscles makes so much sense, especially for me because my posture could use improvement.

There is only one plank in this DVD, yay! My only suggestion for improvement would be for her to demo it done on the forearms/elbows as the easy position. She does mention you can go down to them instead of using your hands, but doesn't demo this as the easy version. Luckily I was shown this in PT because it's the only way I can do that plank.

I can feel that I worked out the next day. My muscles in my arms and legs feel fatigued- no sharp pain. The stretching after each exercise is great.

5256894,5,B00944V4KI,"With a 30-year history fibromyalgia and ME/CFS (chronic fatigue syndrome), I started Susie's class only after hearing rave reviews of it from a number of people after we moved to where Susi teaches and lives.  I talked to her beforehand about my long history of negative effects and injuries from other exercise programs, and her suggestions to do fewer repetitions of each exercise and stop anytime in the session that I feel I need to have allowed me to continue with her classes twice a week for 2 months without any negative effects.  I sometimes use one pound weights with the exercises, but often just moving my limbs through the exercise is enough for me and avoids post-exercise worsening of symptoms.  The other way that I modify her exercises is to NOT strive to to the maximum repetitions or weights that I'm capable of at the time.  Anyway, I've noticed a steady increase in strength since two weeks into the program (4 sessions), and I'm also noticing that I'm sometimes able now to do the same number of repetitions that other people are doing (although with no weight or just 1 pound).  Susie always does brief stretching with whatever muscle groups were exercised in the previous several forms, and I think this helps me not to set off muscle spasms.  I highly recommend people with fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue try her program (either with weights or bands) and decrease the length and intensity of each exercise and the biweekly sessions - it's really helped me gain strength more than anything I've found.

This DVD is a saving grace for me.  I understand she has another newer DVD using resistance bands, and I will be incorporating that into my ongoing list of DVDs for healthcare also.

I can feel my self growing stronger and my last bone density scan showed slight IMPROVEMENT.  As a 69 year old woman with osteoporosis, I am thrilled.  I also look better-----better posture and muscle tone.

Finally, I found Susie Hathaway's Safe Strength Training for Osteoporosis.  I was leary about trying it but given all the good reviews I took the plunge and I am not sorry.  The program is designed so that you can build to heavier weights as you gain strength, it is very safe, and Susie takes her time in giving instruction and guidance throughout the workout.  I started with three and five pounds weights but have increased to eight pounds for some of the exercises.  I also like Susie's guidance in changing up the strength training every few months with a different workout.

You must remember what you saw more than an hour ago or may end up hurting yourself. A few of the core exercises can put a lot of strain on your back and it would have been better if she gave you more options on what else to do right at that moment, just in case it was a bit challenging. The instructor needs to communicate more with her audience 'you're doing great' doesn't do it, if you are going to end up skipping the exercise. This is one reason I like Leslie Sansone, when doing certain moves, she tells her audience 'if you feel any strain on your shoulder or back try doing it this way'...this is what Susie needs to do.",1393891200,14,798,4.15483870967742

In a short time I went from having to pause the video a few times to rest before continuing to doing the entire video with no problem.  You do have to get the barbells but that is what makes it so great!  Suzie gives very clear directions on using the weights properly. And as you get stronger, and you will get stronger, you need the next higher weight. So, some money is involved but it is much cheaper than joining a gym. I love how Suzie clearly states in each exercise how to tell if I'm using the right weight or if I need a lighter or heavier weight. After each exercize she does a quick stretch.

It is also the only one which hasn't resulted in me hurting myself. Susie is rigorous in keeping the exercises as safe as possible and clearly explains how each exercise should be done for maximum benefit with no pain or injury. I also like that there are approx. 20 exercises with each exercise being performed 10 times and then moving onto the next one. It means I don't get bored. Every area of concern for osteoporosis is targeted, including hips, spine and wrists. Each exercise is performed slowly as it is the loading of the bones and muscles with weight which brings results for slowing down the loss of bone density. I also like that Susie clearly describes how I can tell when it is time for me to move to a heavier weight or when a lighter weight is called for.

The exercise workout starts with a five minute warmup.  I do feel this part of the DVD is rushed and not cued well.  From there Susie gets into the full body bone-loading strength routine.  This is a wonderful workout, well cued and can be as easy or hard as you make it depending upon the weights used.  Doing this workout twice a week as recommended has increased my strength noticably.  The aches and pains I have prior to exercising are gone when I'm finished.

I have been doing her program for 6 weeks now and I've lost 5 pounds (not dieting) and I am stronger and have more energy.  I can even say that I am happier to do something for myself, finally!

This video is WAY too slow for anyone who is already fit (and I am not very fit) and working out.  The video lasts for 50 minutes.  My heart rate was in the zone for 23 of those minutes, yikes!  The format is that Susie leads you in an exercise and then immediately after you finish your reps she has you stretch that muscle you just used.  This would be GREAT for an older person or someone who has never lifted weights.  I did like Susie's style and her calm demeanor and her thorough explanations.

5256944,5,B00944V4KI,"Bought this DVD  in January.  Have been doing it for about 5 weeks now.  I absolutely love it!  I feel stronger and more balanced already.  I was diagnosed with osteoporosis of the hip and osteopenia of the spine in December.  I was absolutely devastated.  I am 62 years old with migraine associated with vertigo-and therefore, poor balance.  I was afraid that with the osteoporosis diagnosis I was going to fall due to my vertigo and break something at any given moment.  Now, with Susie's wonderful DVD exercise program, I already feel stronger and more in control.  I am following her very valuable advice on how to bend, lift, etc.  I do the balance exercises every day--and am seeing tremendous improvement in my balance already.  I need all the help I can get in the balance department due to my vertigo issues.  I am so loving the way I feel now.  I am hopeful that with Susie's program I can at least stop or severely slow my bone loss.  (Dare I hope to even increase my bone density?)  I refuse to put osteoporosis drugs in my system due to many factors, and I am determined to naturally enhance my bones, or at least slow the loss.  I take the appropriate supplements, walk 5 days a week (have for over 5 years now), and do Susie's DVD every 3 days as she recommends.  I also try to eat appropriately, get enough rest, and take some stress reduction measures.  I will get my next DEXA scan in two years, and I simply cannot wait to see my scores.  I know that two years may not be enough time to show improvement, but to show a slowing or stopping of bone loss after two years would be great!  I hope to be one of the lucky ones that can build some bone.  I hope this for everyone out there.  Get Susie's DVD, you will be glad you did.  It will give you strength, balance, confidence and courage to tackle a scary diagnosis.  I am so looking forward to Susie's next DVD's.  Hoping they will be released soon!!!!!!

It is easy to follow and it gives clear instructions and demonstrations on how to do the exercises. It is just like being in class with Susie! I just have to touch a computer button to start my training session-

I have attended Susie's classes and reversed osteoporosis with her strength training program.  My spine had osteoporosis and now I am completely out of the osteoporosis range and so are my hips.  I am thrilled with the improvement in my bone density.  I was able to reverse the osteoporosis with regular strength training classes taught by Susie, along with improvements in my nutrition and NO Fosamax.

I am so happy.  I am going to keep doing everything I have been doing (walking, eating greens, strength training with weights, etc.), and now that I am walking even more, my goal is to get out of osteopenia.  I WILL stay out of the (Nursing) HOME:-).""

5256968,5,B00944V4KI,"On this DVD Susie Hathaway demonstrates a full body workout that can increase bone density by strengthening all muscle groups.  The DVD is designed so that someone new to resistance training can learn an effective workout and those who have done strength training before can learn more about proper form and technique as they follow along with the routine.

The introductory section of the DVD describes all the moves in detail and has useful information about improving strength and balance as we age.  The main workout goes at a comfortable pace so someone can follow along at home without a personal trainer.  I've been doing resistance training for years, yet I found new and useful information on this DVD, and have made adjustments to my technique after watching it.

From her website and blog, it's clear that Susie believes that it's never too late for resistance training. While the DVD may be targeted to an older adult population, a person of any age could easily benefit from her program.

I have osteopenia, and when I started her classes I could hardly carry one metal chair back to the storage room at a time. I had to do most of the moves with no weights at all.  Now I easily carry two chairs at once, and use weights heavier than I even dreamed of when I first began.

My balance has improved, and I actually have 'definition"" - substance, muscles, curves and ripples -  that were not there before in my shoulders, arms and legs. I asked my husband to feel my wrists one day and see if he could tell any difference. He said, ""No, except they are less wimpy."" ""RIGHT!"", I replied, ""They ARE less wimpy!"" They are noticeably larger and stronger than when I began.

Susie's careful guidance makes it clear when to increase weights for every move; and her encouragement is lively, caring and constant. In this DVD, as in her classes, she clearly points out how to adjust the moves for osteopenia, osteoporosis, back problems, knee weakness, etc. She also includes tips and information on the latest research findings in the fields of exercise, weight training, and health.

I recommend this DVD for anyone, whether you are just beginning weight training, or as a guide to continuing an established training routine.",1351382400,54,1330,4.740259740259741

I know that if I continue to do this two times a week, that I will easily be back to where I was when I took her classes!  If you've ever dreamed of having your own coach in the comfort of your home, Susie is the one!!  It was like she was reading my mind!  Every time a question came up for me, Susie was answering it in such a kind and gentle way.  By the end of the year, I'll be getting my personal coach for pennies a day!

 Every time I do the workout, I feel like calling Susie up and thanking her all over again!!  It's perfect for me since I can work at my own pace - make the improvements I need - and all without feeling anyone's watching or judging me!  Twice a week, I'm singing Susie's praises all over again.

However, exercising at home IS something you can actually do to get stronger, and this workout is a really good one.  It's hard work--you'll sweat!--but you can easily modify it, as Susie prompts, to a challenge level you feel capable of performing. I felt better literally the next day after trying this out the first time and have been working out with it twice a week ever since.
