Meenakshi is a talented actress and this role doesn't demand much of her, she does well. Reena Roy does a decent job as well . This movie was a comeback for Reena Roy after three years, she had put on weight but shows her talent. Yet, her character wasn't all that convincing. For example her aunt who keeps trying to get her way keeps trying to brainwash Reena Roy and plant a seed of doubt about Govinda and Meenkashi. Reena Roy ignores but then starts to believe in her aunt because she was hurt when she suggests to Govinda about money for the temple and he suggest it better off going to the children's education. It needed a better reason for the aunt to start her mind games with Reena Roy. The woman who plays Reena Roy's aunt is o.k. It would have been better off Aruna Irani, Lalit Powar or Shashikala doing this role. verall, not a bad family movie. I like it and would suggests it being watched on a weekend when you have nothing better to do.",1304640000,,1092,4.410891089108911
