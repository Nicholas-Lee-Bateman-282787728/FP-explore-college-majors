I like getting the series instead of the random episode DVDs, you get a lot more for your money. I would definitely buy this again. We have all 4 of the sets from volume 1. Kids learn about how plants and flowers grow, the colors of the rainbow, microorganisms, etc without getting too in depth (or boring). If you like the DVDs check out the Cat in the Hat learning library series of books too. Episodes in this set include:
Flight of the Penguin
Let's Go Fly a Kite
You Should be Dancing
Batty for Bats
Maps!
Termite Towers
The Lost Egg
Hold on Tight
Jump
Slow Down for Sloths
Chasing Rainbows
Follow the Prints
A Long Winter's Nap
The Tree Doctor
Incredible Journey

Thump
Squirreled Away
Finola's Farm

8700897,5,B00T7Z5Q1M,"Thank  you Ncircle for making your product available also in Spanish. We are doing all in our power to raise our children trilingual and it was a nice surprise finally to find a PBS product available with Spanish audio.

By the way, I ONLY BUY products available in multiple languages, and pretty much Disney movies were the only option we could go to, until now that more and more studios are making their products available in multiple languages (such as Penguins of Madagascar which are available in French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, etc. ).

As always, The Cat in the Hat is a great option for entertaining and learning. Thank you!!!!",1439683200,,659,4.866071428571429
