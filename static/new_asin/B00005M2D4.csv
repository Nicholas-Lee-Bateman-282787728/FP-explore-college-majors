Once again Retromedia did a fine job releasing this on dvd. The picture quality is good, and we get a few extras.

1623811,3,B00005M2D4,"Eddie Romero and John Ashley are at it again!!  Yup, another goofball Filipino horror flick, this time moving us from Blood Island to an undetermined town in Southeast Asia.
Romero's script is a total mess with a zillion confusing plotholes.  I won't even try to describe it all coz it'll make your head hurt trying to analyze it, and a film like this shouldn't require that kind of thinking.  All you really need to know is that Ashley plays a rich businessman who has made a deal with the devil to more or less do evil things and bring out the evil in everyone he meets.  He starts to develop a conscience about this though.  As an added bonus to his curse, he transforms into a wrinkled gray faced monster at night, and in the Lon Chaney, Jr. tradition, goes about slaughtering and eating folks.  For s**ts and giggles I suppose.  Turning into a monster is a hindrance for Ashley coz it messes up his hair and sideburns.  He meets a blind man who might hold the key to freedom.
That's all the plot you really need.  If you enjoy the Romero/Ashley team(and who doesn't?), most likely you'll check this out.  Unfortunately it isn't as entertaining as the Blood Island films, and tends to drag.  Ashley is supposed to be cold and evil, but John Ashley can probably never come across as evil.
The DVD includes an intro to the film done by B movie extraordinaire, Fred Olen Ray.  This is also available in the bonus features which doesn't make much sense since it already played before the movie.  Plus there are a few vintage Drive-In advertisements and a nice documentary, ""Remembering John Ashley"" that runs about half an hour.",1219190400,2,1628,4.572413793103448

Ashley agrees to possess those whom the devil wishes to destroy. Ashley's spirit ends up in the bodies of different men throughout several decades, before winding up inside a man w/ a beautiful wife (Charlotte Wilcox). Ashley gets tired of his deal w/ satan, who responds by turning him into a hideous nocturnal monster! BOTYN has loads of ultra-cheeeezy gore and a rather surprising sex scene tossed in!

1623813,3,B00005M2D4,"The name John Ashley may not mean a hill of beans towards the general, cinema going public, but to lovers of schlock films, he's the ginchiest...he started his career at AIP appearing in JD (juvenile delinquent) and beach party films like Dragstrip Girl (1957), Motorcycle Gang (1957), High School Caesar (1960), Beach Party (1963), Muscle Beach Party (1964), later transitioning into horror movies like Frankenstein's Daughter (1958) and The Eye Creatures (1965).  In the late 60s he went to the Philippines where he appeared in a series of low budget horror films including Manila, Open City (1968), Mad Doctor of Blood Island (1968), Brides of Blood (1968), and it was in 1971, with this film, titled Beast of the Yellow Night (1971), where Ashley, who not only starred, but also began producing, sharing a co-credit with Roger Corman (did I mention Ashley was also an accomplished rockabilly singer?).  Appearing with Ashley in Beast of the Yellow Night, written and directed by Eddie Romero (Manila, Open City, Mad Doctor of Blood Island, Brides of Blood), is Mary Charlotte Wilcox (Willie Dynamite, Psychic Killer, The Big Bus), Ken Metcalfe (She Devils in Chains, Warriors of the Apocalypse), Andres Centenera (The Big Bird Cage, The Twilight People), Leopoldo Salcedo (Destination Vietnam), Eddie Garcia (Woman Hunt), and Vic Diaz (Night of the Cobra Woman, Black Mama, White Mama, Superbeast).

After a brief introduction from Fred Olen Ray (and Miss Kim), the film begins proper...the year is 1946, and we're in a small town in Southeast Asia.  The military is out and about, and look, there's John Ashley, wandering through the jungle, looking pretty ragged.  Turns out his character's name is Joseph Langdon, and he's about to die of starvation...that is until Satan (Diaz) shows up, in the guise of a fat, half-nekkid oriental man sporting a nice pair of bazooms.  They make a deal (Langdon gets a sack of bloody meat for his soul) , and here's where things get a whole lot more confusing.  Langdon is saved, but apparently he's cursed to inhabit bodies of Satan's choosing, for the purpose of awakening the latent evil of those whom he comes into contact with, making him Satan's tool, figuratively speaking.  Fast-forward in time to the present (the present being the early 70s), and Langdon is now forced to assume the body of recently deceased, prominent American businessman (and all around a-hole) Phillip Rogers.  Well, needless to say, everyone is surprised to see Phillip/Joseph alive, including his wife Julia (Wilcox), and his brother Earl (Metcalfe).  Some stuff happens, and Langdon/Rogers begins to develop an identity, to which Satan punishes him by causing him to turn into a cannibalistic beast, one that feeds on others, and then reverts back to human form.  The authorities are baffled by the recent spate of mutilated bodies popping up here and there, the trail of blood eventually leading to Langdon/Rogers...I think...I'm unsure, as the story was confusing as hell...

If anything, Beast of the Yellow Night did help to illuminate the burgeoning Filipino movie industry to the outside world, as many saw their film dollars would go a lot farther in the Philippines than in the states (the influx of funds certainly didn't hurt the Philippine economy).  As a result, exploitationeers poured in, and soon followed a slew of westernized shlock with an Asian setting, much of it being a strange amalgam of popular genres fused together, creating some really oddball movies, all of which usually had one, common denominator, that being sleaze, which Beast of the Yellow Night has in spades.  Your best bet here is not to focus too much on the story, but just go with the flow.  Certain aspects do clear themselves up later on within the story, but quite a few don't.  The acting, overall, is pretty rotten stuff, especially Wilcox and Metcalfe, with Ashley himself coming across a little better...I think the main problem here was the rancid script...below is a particularly painful exchange between a police lieutenant and a coroner discussing a mutilated corpse, one of Langdon/Rogers first victims;

Police Lieutenant: There must have been some kind of weapon used...nobody could have done that with his bare hands.
Coroner: I don't know Lieutenant, even a weapon has to be handled.  What kind of weapon would you need to rip out a man's heart with a single blow?
Police Lieutenant: You're not sure it was a single blow?
Coroner: I wouldn't swear to it...no, not on something as mutilated as that.

Oh bruther...now imagine nearly an hour an a half of that...actually, the Filipino actors came across much better in the movie than did the Americans, only because the Filipinos seemed much more comfortable with the disjointed, English dialog.  And that's another thing, the running time...the film was way too long.  The filmmakers could have easily cut about fifteen minutes out from various places and had a tighter story, but as it is, the movie feels like a patchwork of material poorly stitched together, about to fall apart at anytime.  The editing is pretty hinky, also as throughout there seems to be quite a bit of confusion as to whether it's day or night.  Various scenes will begin in the daytime, quickly switching over to night, and vice versa.  The movie does have its charms, first and foremost being John Ashley's (who was pushing 40 at the time) monumental mutton chop sideburns.  The monster make up wasn't all that bad, but it did have the effect of making Ashley look like a sickly, gray-faced, middle-aged Eddie Munster.  If you like the gore, there some to be had here...a few face slashes, and one scene where the monster appears to be feasting on animal entrails placed on top of an elderly man.  There's also an strange love sequence where Langdon/Rogers gets his freak on with wife Julia, providing a nice shot of her chestal region, concluding with a not so nice shot of his buttocks...bah...didn't need to see that.

The widescreen (1.85:1), non-anamorphic picture on this Retromedia Entertainement, Inc. DVD release looks decent, but flaws to the source material are noticeable throughout.  It wasn't pristine, but then I wasn't expecting it to be...the audio comes through well.  There are a number of extra features, including drive-in spots highlighting refreshments available at the concession stand, a trailer for the film, a piece titled `Remembering John Ashley' featuring his wife Jan, Fred Olen Ray, along with Steve and Andrew Stevens all reminiscing about Ashley, and a John Ashley photo gallery, featuring photos and promotional material played against one of Ashley's rockabilly tunes.  While I do appreciate Fred Olen Ray and his Retromedia group for digging up these funky, drive-in curios, I wish they'd do a little more with the DVD release in terms of providing time code information on the disc.  Normally when a DVD plays, you can see the time progression displayed on the player, but not here.  Also, if you stop the film (rather than pausing it), it does not remember where you stopped it, and goes back to the beginning.  Perhaps this is an aspect inherent to my DVD player, but I think not.  A minor annoyance, I suppose...

7944676,3,B00005M2D4,"Somehow through all the years I never heard of this one, so thank you Amazon. The most helpful review here covers everything so no need to repeat any of that, but when he mentioned a nude scene (in so many words), I wasn't sure what he was talking about. I went over to youtube and  scanned through the movie there and sure enough there was the scene he was talking about, roughly starting around 20:20. The scene lasts for 35 seconds. Here, Amazon has obviously edited it out for whatever reason, but curiously the youtube version runs 1:23:29, while Amazon's runs 1:23:21, so even the youtube version is cut up. Anyway the nude scene doesn't really add anything to the story and without it, the movie gives off a family friendly drive-in vibe.

One last thing is the soundtrack. It's remarkably better than I would expect for a movie like this. They definitely got more than they paid for.

3.5 stars.

(P.S. Too bad they didn't subtitle the Tagalog.)",1521417600,,953,4.621301775147929
7944677,2,B00005M2D4,"This review is for the standard DVD edition of 'Beast of the Yellow Night (Special Edition)' released by Retromedia in 2005.

The quality of the print is just average. I'm not sure what the difference is between the Special Edition and regular versions. I guess it has something to do with the introduction but I can't say for certain.

'Beast of the Yellow Night' is a movie made in the Phillipines and distributed in the U.S.A. by Roger Corman's New World Pictures in 1971. Corman had started his own company around 1970 after becoming fed up with his movies being edited by AIP. Always looking for cheap ways to make movies he decided the Philipines would be a good place to go.

The movie itself is no better than average and I rate it below average. Like many of Corman's films for New World, it is a rip off of other films.

The movie is about a murderer who makes a deal with the devil. The deal is that the murderer (John Ashley) is to posess the bodies of several people and do the devil's bidding over the years. In the present, Phillip Rodgers (Ashley) wants to end his deal with the devil and control his own body. However, Rodgers turns into a Werewolf like creature and goes on a rampage. There is a police inspector that recognizes Rodgers but doesn't understand how since he hasn't changed in many years. From here the hunt is on for Langdon.

This movie was obviously influenced by Universal's classic Monsters. Rodgers looks like the Wolf Man and encounters a blind man who tries to help him ala Bride of Frankenstein.
The Devil portrayed by Vic Diaz, a Filipino, is kind of unusual but I guess it's something different.

The acting is below average and for the most part the movie is none too exciting.

Recommended strictly for completists or fans of Filipino cinema. I'd save my money and try to buy it in a collection some day. You wouldn't be missing much.",1461801600,4,1879,4.525073746312684
7944678,4,B00005M2D4,"Weird Filipino horror from the director of MAD DOCTOR OF BLOOD ISLAND (1968/1969) and TWILIGHT PEOPLE (1972). At the end of World War II an army deserter (John Ashley) is hunted down for the murders and rapes of a Filipino family. Cornered in the jungle, and running out of time, he strikes up a bargain with a mysterious man (our old friend Vic Diaz of VAMPIRE HOOKERS [1979] and countless other Filipino flicks). Diaz turns out to be the Devil and gives delight in giving Ashley eternal life, letting him occupy other people's bodies to ""release the latent evil in their souls."" In 1970 Ashley occupies the body of a wealthy industrialist who had his face destroyed in an accident. He miraculously recovers (giving Ashley his face back and the attending hospital doctor a heart attack!) and causes considerable confusion for his wife (Mary Wilcox of LOVE ME DEADLY [1972] and PSYCHIC KILLER [1974]). She never expected hubby to pull through and is having an affair with his brother (Ken Metcalfe). Ashley then falls in love with her not realizing that Diaz will not allow him to experience pleasure. Every time Ashley feels amorous he changes into an indestructible monster (in bad makeup) who feels compelled to rip out the innards of the Filipino population. A police detective (Eddie Garcia) assigned to the case notices a resemblance between the industrialist and the army deserter and pieces together the puzzle. As the police close in, Ashley is befriended by a blind hermit (in true FRANKENSTEIN fashion) who makes Ashley realize that the power of prayer may finally release him from his diabolical pact. Ashley had a long relationship with director Eddie Romero, starring in (and sometimes producing) such films as the aforementioned MAD DOCTOR and TWILIGHT as well as BRIDES OF BLOOD (1968), BEAST OF BLOOD (1970), BEYOND ATLANTIS (1973), SAVAGE SISTERS (1974) and THE WOMAN HUNT (1972). Ashley later quit acting (a good thing for mankind) and became a successful TV producer (an even better thing for mankind) of such iconic action shows as THE A-TEAM (1983 - 1987), RIPTIDE (1983 - 1986) and WALKER, TEXAS RANGER (1993 - 2001) before he passed away of a heart attack in 1997. BEAST OF THE YELLOW NIGHT is a mildly diverting time waster thanks to the strange storyline, bloody gore, Wilcox's nudity and Diaz's all too brief performance. Rated R. Available on DVD from Retromedia Entertainment and as a double feature DVD (with KEEP MY GRAVE OPEN - 1973) from Alpha Home Entertainment. UPDATE: Eddie Romero passed away on March 28, 2013.",1442793600,2,2548,4.927906976744186

We are what we eat. It is a beastly movie with a soft porn touch. John Ashley makes a deal with the devil (Vic Diaz) to serve and munch.

On the production side there is too dark of a filter. Stilted dialog not absolutely wooden. This is not really worth suffering through other than an example of Ashley's repertoire.",1419120000,,384,4.550724637681159
7944682,3,B00005M2D4,"This DVD started out promisingly, with movie director Fred Olen Ray in his van at the Drive-In, talking about the essentials for enjoying the Drive-In experience. His girlfriend, the beautiful Miss Kim, emerged from the back seat, and REALLY started enjoying the popcorn she was eating! Then the feature film started.  Filmed in the Philippines, the movie was a muddled mess. I kept looking for a yellow moon in the film to account for the movie's title, but I never saw it. The late John Ashley did a credible job of playing the main character Joseph Langdon, alias Philip Rogers. As for his acting career, it was a really long road for John from Bikini Beach, with Frankie and Annette, to the Philippines, with Vic Diaz playing Satan. Despite its shortcomings, the movie didn't commit the unforgivable sin of being boring. In addition, I found a bit of dialog, spoken by John Ashley's character, to be quite profound. ""There's no such thing as a dead end. You can always get out the way you came."" As you go through life, that's certainly something to keep in mind.  There's nothing like a great movie, and this was nothing like a great movie!",1399593600,,1145,4.691542288557214
7944683,3,B00005M2D4,"After Ashley and Romero parted ways with Hemisphere Pictures International and joined up with Roger Corman to make more movies in the Phillipines they continued their blood and gore films. Designed to make you think it was still a part of the Blood Island series (as was ""Brain of Blood""),.

Ashley played both the hero and the title creature after making a pact with the devil. When he tries to break that pact, he becomes the ""Beast"" at night slaughtering the population. He has a beautiful wife who he has to lie to every night and is the reason he broke the pact. A brand new release but could have used a remaster. The picture isn't any better than the VHS copy of this film I had. So, don't let the brand new SPECIAL EDITION title fool you.

The film isn't as good as the original ""Blood Island"" trilogy, but Ashley is as good as he always was. A 1970's drive-in picture. It plays just as it should. Notice the low price also. It makes this film a minor treasure.",1397001600,2,969,4.377777777777778
7944684,4,B00005M2D4,"Very creative and unique exploitation, basically a faustian tale set in post WWII Phillipines.  The opening scenes are pretty riveting, marred only by a choppy cut to the titles.  Sure the acting is a bit stiff and some of the tech stuff is a little choppy but a moral tug of war between the American interlopers and indigineous people is pretty juicy material. Vic Diaz shines as the devil, appearing in the dress of whatever scene he shows up in (a suit at a funeral, a police uniform at a crime scene) and has some nice nice moments.
(EAT!). Ashley is wooden.  It takes an extraordinary actor to deliver the line ""I am here to awaken the latent evil in man"" with nary the merest glimmer of emotion.  I'm convinced he was dubbed in the opening scenes.",1389657600,,753,4.474452554744525
