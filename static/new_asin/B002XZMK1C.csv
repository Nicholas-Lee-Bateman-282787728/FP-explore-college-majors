Yes I did see the evidence of borrowing from other works but it didn't take away from the beauty of the piece. I've never seen anything like this movie and everyone I know that has seen it says the same. This interview was interesting.  Because I saw the interview first it wet my pallet for the movie.",1274659200,,454,4.404761904761905
8383958,3,B002XZMK1C,"Congrats on getting away with photoshopping a picture of James Cameron onto a montage of Avatar pics. (Caveat, I have not seen this piece from 60 minutes, so if the collage is from CBS, i digress) but having an adaquate eye for photoshops, i gotta call shenangians on the glasses, not calling BS on part of Amazon, because offering streamable content from the web for $17 on DVD-Rs is a great business move, I'm just saying the Amazon product design can't fool us all with those glasses. Next time, look at the shadows from the wrinkles in his face and shirt. thanks :D (Awesome movie and I still love ya Amazon, no hard feelings?",1272153600,,630,4.535087719298246
8383959,1,B002XZMK1C,"Not only did James rip off a already published book & video series called Avatar, he ripped off other movies such as, The Matrix 3, Conan the Barbarian, Alien 2, and King Kong to create this really disappointing film. There are so many details missing from the story, that I lose focus on what I am watching and left with disappointment that James felt I was a 4 year old kid who wouldn't catch his gimmicks. If you want to watch a good movie he did watch Aliens, cause this movie just sucks even with good CGI. You are left asking to many ?'s.",1266537600,3,544,4.240384615384615
