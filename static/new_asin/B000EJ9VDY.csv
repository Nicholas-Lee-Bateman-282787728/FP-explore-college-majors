I thought it was a pretty good collection to introduce someone to this show.  We laughed through almost every episode.

2521696,1,B000EJ9VDY,Well I didn't think to look at reviews for this since I knew my husband liked this show. I figured that by buying brand new there would be no issues but the discs are defective. When my husband tried to watch it for the first time he discovered the problem. He then went online to look at reviews and saw multiple complaints about the same problem. I don't know how they can continue to list this item.,1426723200,7,402,4.233766233766234

2521698,1,B000EJ9VDY,"Great box, cool little toys inside, but the discs don't play, kept freezing up and skipping.  Really upset, had to return and reorder all the disks at a higher cost.  I think it was a packaging issue - the disks are not in individual cases, but in sleeves in one zipper pack - must do something to the disk.",1420588800,8,307,4.186440677966102
2521699,1,B000EJ9VDY,"My husband bought this for my early Christmas. All my discs are scratched. They freeze during playback and stop playing all together.

In fact I own on DVD the Sets up till the Eight Volume, great show.",1386288000,,275,3.5833333333333335
2521702,3,B000EJ9VDY,"The 3 stars are for the product itself, and not the show. If you consider buying this, then you know the show and you know it is good.
What is to be considered here, is that some of the dvds in this set are unreadable. I ordered this set twice and both sets had unreadable dvds in it. (tried on several players) So i returned the first one (it had 6 or 7 unreadable dvds) and i exchanged 2 or 3 dvds from the second set.
All the first 6 seasons are in there. Including the Blue Harvest special, and the untold Stewie Movie. Ther is also some bonus material, that i frankly do not care much about.
Otherwise, the playing stuff in it is kind of cool, but the ping pong set seems cheap to me. But i never played with it. And though the poker chips are of good quality, there is not enough chips to play with this set alone. So you can only had them to a real set of chips if you realy want to play with it. I never opened the cards box.
Overall, it's a neat box set to have in your video library, once you get to exchange the non-fonctional discs.",1378339200,6,1044,4.0

2521709,3,B000EJ9VDY,"Yes... the ""Freakin Sweet Collection"" was definitely made with the intention of an easy buck (a lot of easy bucks) both on DVD and for the PSP, with its target audience being the casual family guy fans who don't buy the seasons. HOWEVER, I'm glad they released something on UMD for the PSP (this and Volume 1 (seasons one and two) as well as The Untold Story (another sheer money maker), and Volume 2 (season 3). THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THIS DISC IS IT HAS NO ""PLAY ALL"" SELECTION - LAME!!!! Maybe this isn't a big deal to every user... they pop in the disc and watch an episode, if they feel like watching another then it is the matter of a couple clicks. I, however, think that on any DVD, UMD, whatever, there should be a ""PLAY ALL"" selection when it is a series of short TV episodes.
True, I am more than a casual FG fan; I have all of the season box sets on DVD, the only one's I do not own are the Star Wars DVDs (AND yet another sheer money maker, however the jerks have finally released the whole series on one DVD). They all have a play all feature, so does the Family Guy Volume One UMD box set, and other UMDs that I own, e.g. Aqua Teen Hunger Force, have the play all function. Same for any TV DVD I have EVER seen under 20 years old. It seems to me like a given to me.
But I give this three stars because it is a fun sampling of episodes. And since it is fairly cheap, especially if you get a used copy, it is an appealing purchase to add to your collection.",1318032000,,1472,4.0793103448275865
2521710,5,B000EJ9VDY,"The video format for this great show is amazing and high quality. although these aren't my favorite episodes, the episodes on this umd are very fun and are a joy to watch. if you want family guy on your psp this is a great buy for that.",1270857600,,236,4.042553191489362

2521712,1,B000EJ9VDY,"This DVD party pack comes with some sweet games, but the discs don't work! We've exchanged it twice and the discs were defected in BOTH sets. We're hoping that three times really is a charm since we'll be exchanging it yet again.

Don't spend money on this unless you want to purchase the DVDs seperately. It really is a bummer since the ping pong set, playing cards and dice and box are pretty cool",1261008000,3,399,4.391891891891892

2521714,1,B000EJ9VDY,"My husband and I bought this 2 weeks ago at a Best Buy in CA. Three of the DVDs would skip, stutter, and then freeze at certain points, like they were dirty or scratched. We tried it on our other DVD player, and on our laptop computer, and it did the same thing, so we knew the problem was the DVDs. We exchanged it for another one, which is doing the same thing. I think it's the master reel of the DVDs, because A LOT of people are having this problem. I love Family Guy, and would have given it 5 out of 5, given the fact that all the episodes in the first 6 seasons are included, and also the Family Guy movies as well, but I have to give it a 1, because I am unable to watch it! I really hope they fix this problem, and SOON!",1236556800,10,730,3.8733333333333335

When my son played the second set it was just a bad he could not even make one complete set out of both. I contacted Amazon again and they e mailed me a return shipping label.  Although I am very unhappy about my purchase I am very satisfied with the way Amazon is handeling the problem and will continue to purchase from them because of this.

2521716,1,B000EJ9VDY,"I love this show : it's really funny, sarcastic and intelligent. It's a very good criticism of politic, religion, and the American way of life.
So I decided to order it to be able to watch the uncut and uncensored episodes ; and also to have the subtitles because I don't speak English perfectly.
The dvds arrived scratched (most of them) and wouldn't play ; so of course I exchanged them. The same thing happened : I'm pretty sure it's because of the poor quality of the packaging. So I asked for a refund (Amazon was really professional and fast by the way).
I'm very disappointed, so I'm gonna try to buy the seasons separately, waiting for a good deal, because right now it's way more expensive compare to the box set.",1234569600,10,722,4.4772727272727275

This was my college-age child's favorite Christmas gift. It contained many nice surprise items..poker chips, ping pong paddles, Stewie DVD holder and more. It has provided endless hours of entertainment and constant laughter. I thought it was pricey, until we opened it and saw the value! Great gift!

2521720,2,B000EJ9VDY,"The shipping package was sub par. There was a hole in the top of the box which I assume is what led to the product packing being damaged. There was a corner dented in. So far, two of the dvds skip all of the way through the disc. I thought it was the dvd player at first but tried on another player and unfortunately not the case. The ping pong is fun. This was a gift and the recipient loves it, but I wish it worked and arrived in good condition!",1231200000,4,448,3.934065934065934
2521721,5,B000EJ9VDY,"i mean this is a great box if u know what ur expecting
u must know that the volumes are already seasoned split episodes and they didn't mess up this set
and that this comes with a fat dvd case instead of individual dvd cases
over all its good for all 6 volumes and stuff

p.s. : they don't give u the American Dad Season 1 PS Bonus Disc",1228953600,23,336,3.869565217391304
2521722,3,B000EJ9VDY,"There aren't a lot of television shows available on UMD, so it was nice to see Family Guy in that format.  As for the show itself, some of the early episodes are uneven as the show tried to ""find itself.""  However, this set does contain ""I Am Peter, Hear Me Roar"" which is a personal favorite and a show that I think better reflects the later tone of the series -- sexist, juvenile, loaded with pop culture references, semi-offensive...and very funny.

I found two problems with the UMD version.  First, the UMDs come in a cardboard and foam tri-fold ""case"" which doesn't hold the disks very well and isn't at all sturdy.  Even with careful use and storage, the edges of the cover will soon get damaged and the discs will come loose.

Second, and probably more importantly, there is no list of episodes anywhere in or on the packaging.  You are left to guess (or memorize, I suppose) which of the five UMDs the episode you are searching for is located on.  Or else you can insert the UMDs one at a time and wait for the menus to load.  Either way, it isn't helpful and I don't know why they didn't include a card insert with a list of the episodes on each disc.",1224892800,,1161,4.337962962962963
