6497564,3,B00LOCLDPY,"2 classic Chuck norris films, one from 1978 the 2nd from 1979
Good Guys wear black & A Force of one courtesy of DVD Distributor Cinedigm entertainment
both films have only Digital remaster transfers in widescreen ratios, not sure of the screen ratio doesn't say on the back cover
but ratios would be between 1:78:1 & 1:85:1 it's widescreen anyway
the picture quality for both films is pretty Good for Digital remaster quality
obviously the picture quality's would look excellent if High Definition transfers were given, but tragically not
i cannot say the same for the Audio quality for either film, both films have 2.0 stereo mixes that's it.
a 5.1 surround sound mix would've been much better at least, but again tragically not no 5.1 option is given
as for the special features
well it says on the front cover art over 2 hours of bonus material, that's Definitely Bull s..t!
that's a marketing suck in for sure, and i fell for it otherwise i wouldn't of bought the dvd
Disc 1- Good guys wear black
has only a 8min retrospective interview with Director Ted post and only Ted post is interviewed
Anne Archer or Chuck norris of course are not interviewed
Ted post talks about getting chuck norris for the film, talks about the script & the casting etc
there's another Ted post interview a extended interview from the 8min retrospect interview
about 20mins of Ted post talking more about Good guys wear black, talking more about chuck norris and other stuff
no Audio commentary by Ted post
and that's all you get for the first movie
Disc 2 is A Force of one
special features
are 15mins if that-retrospective featurette on the making of A Force of one
interviews with mainly the crew from the film only, Director Paul arron, executive producer Michael Leone
and other crew that were involved making the film
no interview with Jennifer o'neil or Chuck norris, However Actor Clu Gulager who played the Chief police inspector is interviewed
but that's about it
Director Paul arron does do a Audio commentary for the film, interesting commentary
gives alot of recollections shooting the film, so some of it is interesting to listen to
another Documentary is included, How America changed cinema forever
which is a small Documentary on Movie Distributor American cinema-a small company from the mid to late 70's
that produced low budget Action films that starred Chuck norris

apart from that no more extras, so ofcourse the 2 hours of bonus material is a Lie
in my opinion this 2 Disc set is only worth $5 or less, if your paying more than $5-$10 your getting ripped off
it's tragic, both these classics deserve Blu-ray transfers with new 5.1 sound mixes, not DVD Digital mastering
2-3 stars for this 2 disc set, meaning it's alright dvd set not worth more than $10
if  a new 5.1 mix was added and more Decent extras, i would give it maybe 4 stars",1435104000,,2841,4.7028112449799195
6497565,5,B00LOCLDPY,it's ok,1434412800,,7,3.0
6497566,5,B00LOCLDPY,This movie was great seen it when it first came to the movies and had to have the Dvd,1433376000,,85,3.526315789473684
6497567,5,B00LOCLDPY,"Before Chuck somehow became more popular and legendary than god, A force of one struggled to portray Norris as a mere mortal with only karate skills instead of the grenade proof, death cheating, NRA/republican/Netanyahu supporting, heaven-bound freak who could bitchslap superman with both arms and legs tied behind his back!  With enough body hair to survive a Russian winter naked, in this film he uses it as armor and even Bill Superfoot Wallace could not penetrate Chuck's lion coils! The bad guy dresses up as a terrorist, and like a ninja, kills some cops and ambushes Norris with nanchakus! Jennifer O'neill graces the screen with her beauty and sexy female magnetism as a cop who crosses Chuck's path looking for the ninja killer. Norris's biggest fans will be depressed at the lack of body parts not flying at the screen (invasion usa, missing in action) A force of one keeps the bleeding internal- no screaming victims, no stepping on testicles, this is Disney Norris! Jennifer O'neil is beautiful in this with her short hair and undeniable presence. Good Guys Wear Black is one of the greatest movie titles ever but too boring. Too bad A Force of One transfer is not as good as the 1st feature. DVD is 16X9",1429401600,,1217,4.795238095238095
6497568,5,B00LOCLDPY,"I grew up in the '70s and '80s in Southern Ca. and I have seen quite a few of Chuck's movies. I love them! These two are a few of his early efforts.

~ GOOD GUYS WEAR BLACK, 1977, tells the story of Chuck's character going back to Vietnam to try and get POW's with a group of fellow agents. What they didn't know is they were set up and one by one, the team is seemingly killed. Norris, being the last member, gets his revenge, of course. (Norris would later go on to do more Vietnam movies with his successful ""Missing In Action"" trilogy).
The movie is on it's own DVD, looks great, (widescreen), and sounds great! The lovely ANNE ARCHER (Fatal Attraction, Narrow Margin, Patriot Games) appears in one of her early roles throughout the movie as Chuck's girlfriend. Look for older actors such as JIM BACKUS (The Millionaire- Gilligan's Island, Don't Bother To Knock, It's a MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD World), DANA ANDREWS (Laura, Airport '75).

~ A FORCE OF ONE, 1978 tells the story of a man that teaches karate and becomes involved with corrupt police officials dealing drugs. Once one of his promising students, Charlie, gets killed in the process of finding out who they are, he seeks them out for swift justice in true Norris style!

For all Norris fans, I think you will love this 2 Disc DVD edition remastered with good picture and sound!
Both movies are in Widescreen and come with special features as follows ~

8667440,4,B00LOCLDPY,"And you owned both these DVD releases for about 15 years ago you're wondering if this new double feature DVD is  and upgrade on what you have or just a rehash.
i'd say it's pretty much even though you don't get subtitles.
 The original DVD release of good guys wear black ones white screen but had no special features. The original DVD of a force of one had special features but was full screen 1:33.
 In this edition both are  Anamorphic 16x9 wide screen and both have special features.
A force of one has the same special features it had before and the good guys wear black has a directors interview and a making of a featurette.
 And you get both for under five dollars!
