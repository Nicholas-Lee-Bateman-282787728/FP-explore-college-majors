8016438,5,B0001UZIJC,"I own a few DVDs featuring Chomsky (as well as several films in which he appears but is not the primary focus). I'd say On Power, Dissent, and Racism, and, of coarse, Manufacturing Consent are, IMHO, the best.

On Power doesn't slow down or draw out. You stay interested and listen effortlessly to the man speak. Great intro to Chomsky for those unfamiliar and most enjoyable for an admirer. Nice presentation visually - a cool shot of planet Earth from space, black and white footage of New York.. and the music is nice too. I'd say it's classy, which in a certain sense is an odd word to use in describing a film starring the world's most famous anarchist thinker (not for a second should I be misunderstood to imply by that that the man is anything less than a ""world-class"" intellectual and all around ""class-act"" and gentleman mind you. Anyway.).

You'll like this film I think, and that's my motivation for writing this. It's available from lots of stores online --check out Alternative Tentacles.

Buy it and share it.",1196985600,3,1025,4.683333333333334
8016439,5,B0001UZIJC,"This is a series of interviews with Noam Chomsky from 2002-3.  The professor always delivers a mighty blow with his words--because they ring so undeniably true.  The viewer has world events explained in terms that anyone can understand.  When presented in this manner, the situation we find the world in today doesn't seem so very mysterious.  It makes perfect sense, sadly.  But, understanding them is necessary if there can ever be change.

The professor is one of today's intellectuals.  His vast understanding of world events past and present support his words.  And, his lecture style is very appealing.

You will begin to question what you are being told.  That's how change happens.",1116460800,5,689,5.071428571428571
8016440,5,B0001UZIJC,"Any fan of Noam Chomsky will find this to be a great addition to their DVD library. He sheds light on topics that are rarely or never discussed truthfully on telvision or other forms of communication. Even those who disagree with his concepts and philosophy on these topics should give it a chance, as at least it gives other opinions rather than those put out by the government and media corporations, and can get some healthy intellectual discussions started. All people I have recommended it to enjoyed it and have since purchased other works by Professor Chomsky.",1116374400,2,567,4.855670103092783
8016441,5,B0001UZIJC,"The mind of Chomsky is daunting to behold in book form, but his cool wisdom is enlightening and disheartening all at the same time. A must see for anybody with a critical mind in a critical time.",1116374400,3,195,4.297297297297297
8016442,5,B0001UZIJC,"On Power , Dissent and Racism gives a clear and thoughtful summary on Chomsky's opinions to present day problems. Chomsky's commentary on anti Semitism and racism are informative and as usual enlightening. I highly recommend this film to Chomsky lovers as well as to anyone who would like to have an introduction to one of the greatest minds of all times. A+!",1079049600,10,359,4.806451612903226
