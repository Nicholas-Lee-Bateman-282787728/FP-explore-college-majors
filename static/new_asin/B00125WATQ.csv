Light on seat cowering tension (i could be desensitized), yet heavy on mouth-agape ultra violence. INSIDE, is unforgettable and will play over and over in your head for days.

They came out to warn us before we go in that this movie is gory and the women in line laugh at the warning and said,"" yeah, we saw THE RING so we will be okay but thanks for the warning.""
30 minutes into the movie, women were running out of the cinema.
The rest of the women who stayed in the cinema turned their head to the projection room throughout the rest of the movie.
What an amazing and daring movie !!!!",1207612800,6,465,3.9574468085106385
3076837,5,B00125WATQ,I watched this film online based on someone's recommendation. I love horror and this was the only movie I've ever seen that I watched through my fingers. If you really want to see a great horror movie - and you aren't completely disturbed by violence and gore...see this.

 This movie has a lot of gore and that's that. Now i'm a horror fan. Not a gore fan. I like more the plot stories the mystery, the suspense, the real horror movies which are not present gore as their main element.
 Gore does not scare me. IT MAKES ME SICK.",1206576000,11,416,4.0
3076839,5,B00125WATQ,"i absolutely loved this film. don't be afraid of the cheesy straight-to-video film company the dvd is being released by. this is actually a french film and the rights have obviously been picked up by dimension for an american distribution. i love how this film doesn't rely on an over-the-top storyline or crazy special effects. the plot is simple, yet it keeps you involved from the very first shot to the last. i haven't gasped this much since movies like high tension and the descent. i'm glad to see the foreigners still get to see the genre live, while us in america are slowly watching it die.",1205107200,4,599,4.607476635514018
3076840,5,B00125WATQ,"Directors Julien Maury and Alexandre Bustillo's INSIDE (original title:  L'INTRIEUR) has proven once again that if anyone has their mutilated finger pressed firmly to the pulse of horror, it's the French. This scribe hasn't seen anything quite this cinematically dangerous since their countryman Gaspar No's gut-punch of a flick IRREVERISIBLE, and like that film, INSIDE proves to be a rollercoaster gone off the gore-drenched rails, as well as a film that, while paying homage to the slasher film, redefines the genre itself. Kudos to LA's Screamfest for helping expose this Euro masterpiece to the U.S. masses.

Written by Bustillo, INSIDE has an opening setup that is familiar enough to horror cineastes: A young married couple are involved in a horrific car accident on a rainy country lane, one which the husband doesn't survive. Four months later, his pregnant widow Sarah (portrayed with astounding commitment by actress and sister-in-law to Johnny Depp Alysson Paradis) is scheduled for induced labor. Still mourning the loss of her husband and in a disconnected emotional state, Sarah decides, much to the chagrin of her mother, to spend Christmas Eve alone in preparation for the following morning's birth. It is here where things shift gears following a simple knock on her door, and while savvy audiences will certainly ascertain the identity of the (soon-to-be malevolent) stranger (this scribe did, even before the visually stunning opening credits rolled by), it's the clever road of carnage leading up to--and after--the reveal that will keep those with strong stomachs in their seats, and perhaps drive those with lesser fortitude to a state of nausea.

Pure and simple, the conceit is that Sarah's visitor wants her unborn baby, and isn't content to wait for its natural birth; the intruder's pair of 10-inch shears prove undeniable testament to that. Portrayed with acute gravity by Beatrice Dalle and billed simply as ""La Femme"" (a nod to John Carpenter's ""The Shape""?), this villainess is an altogether terrifying amalgamation of covetous, bloody and remorseless savagery.

More importantly, both women's emotional states and motivations ring true, and thus so does the narrative. However far Maury, Bustillo and producers Vran Frdiani and Franck Ribire push the envelope (and in fact break it), the proceedings, beyond one or two leaps of logic in the third act, carry the audience along effortlessly. There is something raw, familiar and human here, with each character's respective motivations nuanced and believable, and as a result the already red-lined suspense attains an intensity not seen in many years, with an ending that's entirely unpredictable and unquestionably grim.

Assisting considerably in the tension department are cinematographer Laurent Bares and composer Francois Eudes, who together lend an element of dreadful class to the flick, carrying the audience from the at-first womblike confines of Sarah's home to the charnel house it becomes. Bares channels Carpenter's approach to HALLOWEEN in his framing, utilizing negative space and expressionistic lighting to spectacular effect, while Eudes takes a cue from the minimalist synthesized score of Carpenter's classic and delivers an aural component that is at times lulling and at others entirely unnerving.

As for the carnage on display, makeup FX supervisor Jacques-Olivier Molon and visual FX overseers Rodolphe Guglielmi and Bourdonnay Judikael deliver the goods and then some. A self-induced tracheotomy, a partial decapitation by gunshot, an unsettling homage to David Lynch's BLUE VELVET and various burnings, bludgeonings and stabbings, as well as the pice de rsistance (which I won't give away, and must be seen to be believed) are all delivered with such organic viscera that it's nearly overwhelming. The French have apparently perfected the consistency and palate of stage blood; never before has arterial spray looked so damned...real (which is most likely why Dimension snapped it up for straight-to-DVD release via its genre-centric Extreme imprint; there's no way this flick would garner anything less than an NC-17 from the MPAA).

Vive la France!

See it.

It's rare to have a woman be the villain, but this woman is psychotic and more frightening than most male villains.

3076858,4,B00125WATQ,"Inside was exactly what it was trying to be, an intense, bloody, trapped-in-a-house-with-a-psycho movie.  Thoroughly unpleasant and brutal.  I suppose in a good way.  After watching 4 or 5 of these types of movies lately (High Tension and Martyrs being the high points), I'm really starting to question the sustainability of the genre.  How long can this gruesome, woman-covered-in-blood thing take itself seriously?  I keep waiting for some irony to start creeping into the French horror I've been watching but the people making this stuff seem dead set on an overbearing seriousness that is natural when watching a movie about brutality but seems stretched a little thin when characters can give themselves tracheotomies with (was that a big hair pin or something?), wrap themselves with some duct tape, and do a few more rounds of battle.  Not a bad movie to watch, and I don't see any reason not to check it out if this is what you're into, but don't expect it t be breaking any new ground concept-wise.",1478304000,4,1007,4.894117647058824
3076859,4,B00125WATQ,This movie floored me. I was so not ready for this. I lost my son 3 years ago. He was stillborn. Since then I've been very sensitive to movies about parenthood. INSIDE is brilliant. I found myself rooting for the heroine and the villain--something I can't say I've ever done during any film EVER.,1478131200,,296,4.5
3076860,5,B00125WATQ,"Wow, I was really surprised at how well made this film is.  Obviously, it's French, and their dramas are usually of ""haute qualit"" - but I'm not very well-versed in extreme French horror.  Inside ( l'intrieur) definitely didn't disappoint, and I'm generally a stickler for super gory horror flicks.  The plot is creative, something I've never seen before - something actually scary and more appealing to the fears of women.  I say this because horror is usually much more geared toward male sensibilities.

I love the fact that there is no attempt in this film to provide any comfort or consolation to the viewer, and once the violence starts, it is completely relentless and definitely cringeworthy (in a good way).  This movie gets five stars from me because 1) it's in French and 2) it's totally gross!

And spoiler alert: If you're pregnant, don't call a smoking hospital nurse a ""connasse"" the day before you're due, it could end badly...",1477785600,,943,4.85625

Total gore and some cringeworthy moments but more than anything it was pretty frustrating. There's a difference between helplessness and stupidity and many scenes in this movie just left you being like ""Huh? Why didn't he/she do this instead of that?!"" which makes it pretty hard to sympathetize for anyone in the movie.

3076888,2,B00125WATQ,"My husband and I decided to check this movie out after seeing it on numerous ""Top 25 Horror"" lists. I hate to make comparisons to others, but we have seen gore done right in other films such as Pascal Laugier's superb 2008 film ""Martyrs"" and Kim Jee-woon's excellent 2010 thriller ""I Saw The Devil"". This one looked promising and the reviews were overall positive, so we decided to give it a chance.

This movie could have been a contender if it were not for the sometimes shoddy special effects, the obvious twist that we guessed within 15 minutes, the incomprehensible actions of the main character, and an ending that just came completely out of left field.

If you are in it for pure blood and guts, by all means, rent this. But if you care about plot even a little bit and you like your movies to make sense, skip this and watch Martyrs instead. You will not be missing much.",1456358400,,880,4.459627329192546

The antagonist is a young, pretty, thin woman which conflicts with the fact that she's able to go on a murderous rampage and kill several people including armed cops.  Her victims just make terrible decisions and seem unaware of the environment that they are in.  In the end, there's no satisfying explanation for the antagonist's rampage.  I could go into details about the plot holes but I'm just going to summarize with this: if you like fast-paced horror with gratuitous amounts of gore and disturbing subject matter, you may like this movie, but if you want something that's going to have a bit more suspense and psychological horror, I advise skipping this.",1439164800,2,889,4.946308724832215

3076907,5,B00125WATQ,"WOW WHAT A ROLLER COASTER RIDE! This movie started off with a big bang and kept going right until the very end.  I will say I had forgotten that this was a foreign film with subtitles, not that it mattered but once the movies starts you forget that too as it movies so smoothly with so much suspense and action and gore. A mother devastated over losing her lover in a terrible auto accident and having to care for his unborn child is having a rough time going at it alone and suffering from depression on Christmas eve of all times and now is about to be challenged by one of the most vile people ever to step onto the screen.  A madwoman who for no reason knows all about the mother and will stop at nothing to get her unborn child!

Great visuals, superb editing, the sound production was top notch in this chiller of a movie with so much action and gore you almost find yourself rooting for the villain as much as you do for the young woman because neither will stop at nothing to survive the night.

3076910,4,B00125WATQ,"This movie is not for everyone.  It actually isn't really for ME.  I don't really like extreme gore and violence but I have a sort-of ""must be seen to be believed"" curiosity when it comes to films like this.

When I read a review for Dario Argento's ""Deep Red"" that said, ""One of Argento's best known films is a violent shocker, cut for US release.  Pianist Hemmings attempts to solve gruesome hatchet murders.  Dazzling style makes up for story lapses.  Contains graphic violence."" it left me intrigued.

""How violent could it be?"" I wondered.  Turns out, it's pretty damn violent!  Sadly, it's also just as incoherent.

I don't feel the same about ""INSIDE"".  It's storyline is simple but I found it's imagery to be absolutely stunning!

The words on the back cover of the DVD label for ""INSIDE-UNRATED"" only make ONE promise.  With scene after scene of shocking carnage, INSIDE delivers unbelievably realistic gore that dares you not to look away.

And, true to its word, realistic gore is delivered!  It says nothing about a realistic story.  So, Ive decided to view the film as a sort-of semi-surreal work of art.  An ultra-violent horror fantasy!  Like the absolute worst of nightmares one could ever conceive.

""INSIDE"" is very dark, not just in tone but also in lighting!  There's a scene that has MANY people confused (this was evident from the post on the now deleted message boards at IMDB.com).  Look for tattoo's is the only spoiler that I'll offer here.  Other than that, I really liked the look of this movie!  It's gory scenes are still in my head, nearly a week later, which is not so great, but I did get a thrill out of it's action and it's very, VERY brutal villain!",1431820800,,1685,4.656462585034014

3076916,5,B00125WATQ,"It is VERY RARE indeed after the late 1990's to have a horror movie that is truly worth 5 stars . . . but Inside is one of those few.  I try not to ""spoil"" movies, so I will try to be as general, but as thorough as possible without trying to give too much away.  First and foremost, the mark of a TRULY AWESOME horror movie is atmosphere, and this has PLENTY of it.  There is a true sense of foreboding from beginning to end and it is expertly filmed and directed  to enhance the dread that you feel.  Being a Dimension Extreme offering, you know that you can expect something beyond mainstream, but not all DE movies have been as well made and acted as Inside.  While many good horror movies leave much to be desired with the casting and ability of the actors (and actually enhance the movie - think Italian Giallo from the 80's), all of the players here are masters of their craft, especially the ""villain"" (Beatrice Dalle).  If you are a ""gore hound"", your appetite will certainly be satiated, as the phrase ""buckets of blood"" is very appropriate, but well done.  Suspense is plenty here, and you will be on the edge of your seat by the climax of the movie, which, as a diehard horror fan, I can truly say was beyond satisfying.  The story is well written and ORIGINAL.  In this day and age, when PG13 and remakes dominate the genre, this 2007 gem is a horror movie for the genre's ages.

3076947,5,B00125WATQ,"Inside (French:  l'intrieur) was released under the Dimension Extreme moniker in 2007, and looks every bit like a straight-to-DVD flunker that could not find a proper theatrical run. The cover art perpetuates this assumption, as well as the generic stamp across the top of the DVD case that signifies its licensure to Dimension Studios for distribution in the US. It does not help that the rest of the Dimension Extreme franchise just plain sucks, and is a less successful clone of the ""After Dark Horrorfest.""

The year 2000 ushered in a new wave of French horror films that brought many over-the-top slasher movies to international acclaim. The most famous examples are High Tension (Haute Tension), Frontiere(s), Ils, a.k.a. Them, and Martyrs. With the release of Inside, directors Julien Maury and Alexandre Bustillo crafted the movement's crown achievement. While other directors struggled to outdo one another through higher body counts and more gallons of karo syrup, Inside brings a huge amount of artistic merit to a genre that is still stuck in the early 80's. As with Heath Ledger's performance in The Dark Knight, Batrice Dalle's screen villian is one of the most diabolic psychopaths ever seen on film.

Given that the premise of Inside resides in its exploration of maternal possession, this is not a ""girly"" movie by any means. Inside succeeds because its horror aspect transcends gender boundaries. The vulnerability of a single mother hours before giving birth lends this film a layer of terror unknown to American movies. There are no redeeming qualities to this story, only death. Starting with the opening scene, the directing duo applied great skill to ensure that the antogonist/protagonist polarity is worlds apart. La Femme (Batrice Dalle) is Michael Myers without a mask on, taking full advantage of Sarah Scarangelo's (Alysson Paradis) vulnerable state until she has full control of her mark. Incoming visitors are dispatched one after another, walls are painted red with blood, and there are no heroes that save the day. Ultra scary... 5 stars.",1413244800,,2071,5.176119402985075

3076966,5,B00125WATQ,"More bloody fun than an at-home scissors Cesarean, this film will fill your screen with brutal gore like a sprinkler system in Hell, and the gore is matched by the claustrophobic sense of desperation.  This film is a real winner for lovers of extreme violence.

Shortly after the death of her husband, Sarah wishes to spend the holidays alone away from her family while awaiting the birth of her first child.  But when a strange visitor arrives at her home, alone is the last thing Sarah wishes she was.

This film begins at a somewhat slow but interesting pace.  But once the gore comes into play the effects team, sound editors and actors have their work cut out for them as things turn into a messy shockfest full of impalements accompanied by the most visceral of sounds.  Batrice Dalle does a fantastic job as the gap-toothed nameless menace who obsessively wants Sarah's child for her own while Alysson Paradis (as Sarah) is convincingly tortured and terrified.  They each bring their own brand of desperation and, when they clash, you may want to turn away.

Directed by at-the-time newcomers Alexandre Bustillo and Julien Maury (Livid, Among the Living, The ABCs of Death 2), Inside brings all manner of shocking imagery from car crash victims to nightmare birth sequences.  The brutality knows no end as blood spews from stabs to the throat, face, hand, knee and even crotch.  At one point someone's face is blown off in about as fantastic a manner as I've seen.  But the hits just keep on coming and the shocks continue as kitchen appliance assaults, make-shift flamethrowers, an improvised domestic bayonet and some alternative uses for scissors all contribute to the most blood-splattered movie sets I've seen in ages.

This film may have started out slow, but with each palpable laceration our pregnant heroine becomes ever more speckled and smeared red with the heightening mania.  Moving to the finale, we shift from gory and shocking to absolute bonkers neo-natal insanity complete with an at-home Cesarean birthing scene with blood cascading down the stairs.

This is an absolute win for lovers of extreme violence and intense gore.  So put on your favorite gore bib and dig in!",1396742400,4,2195,4.9105691056910565

Sarah has been in a traumatic car accident that took the life of her husband just a few weeks ago. After the accident, she pushes the people in her life away and plans to spend Christmas Eve and the day before her baby is to be born alone. A stranger comes to her door asking to use the phone, but Sarah refuses, saying her husband is sleeping. The stranger harasses her at her house at first trying to coax her way inside with a sob story, but quickly reveals she knows who Sarah is and that she poses a danger. Sarah calls the police and they don't seem to take it to seriously, but they agree to come back to make sure she's ok later. Then the stranger is in her house, chasing her and attacking her, to steal Sarah's baby right out of her body. A bloody cat and mouse game ensues with a shocking, gory conclusion.

Inside is one of the new wave of extreme French horror films and I believe it to be the best of them. Although the film is incredibly gory and bloody, the writing is quite good, especially in the characterization and portrayal of the two women. It would have been so easy to make both of them one dimensional characters, Sarah as good and la Femme (the stranger) as evil. However, Sarah is depressed and alone after the car accident. She succeeds in pushing everyone in her life away and doesn't seem excited her pregnancy or her life. She opts to stay alone on Christmas Eve rather than spend it with her family. Although it's understandable, she's abrasive, cold, and mean, but not undeserving of sympathy. Even though she seems like she's given up on life, she fights ferociously when she and her unborn child's lives are in danger. Many people go through her house as potential saviors, but Sarah stands on her own and survives when all the others are killed by la Femme. Pregnant women (and oftentimes women in general) are  seen as weak and incapable, but Sarah proves to be resilient and strong.

La Femme is also a strong woman. She dispatches person after person who tries to help or save Sarah. Instead of a flatly evil villain, she also experienced tragedy. The same car accident that killed Sarah's husband killed her late-term unborn child. She wants to replace the child she lost with Sarah's and is willing to tear it from her body. This is the most frightening aspect of the film for me, that she doesn't even view Sarah as a person, only as a receptacle for her to take from. I like that it's never revealed who was at fault for the accident because it ultimately doesn't matter. Both women lost something substantial and basically the same things: people in their lives and their mental health. La Femme is obviously insane, but does garner some sympathy because of her loss. She isn't a mindless killer or an automaton, merely a woman driven mad by grief.

The ending is poignant and powerful. La Femme and Sarah battle it out throughout the film relentlessly. Then, a man attacks Sarah, endangering her child. La Femme defends Sarah and they present a united front because they both value the child's life about their own and each other's. Sarah finally outwardly shows tenderness towards her baby. La Femme cares for Sarah as she tenderly cuts the baby out of her, a complete turnaround from the savagery of before. Even though the moment is violent, the two finally understand each other and work towards the same goal.

Inside is an intense and gory film that features two believable, flawed, and broken women. Both of them are strong despite their losses, but make mistakes that cost them. The film has its flaws, the greatest being the CGI baby scenes and unbelievable decisions and happenings requiring a serious suspension of disbelief. However, the positives outweigh the negatives with the atmospheric score, the dynamic portrayal of the characters, and the intense suspense throughout.",1392768000,2,3848,4.651470588235294

3076970,4,B00125WATQ,"In my attempt to tackle the most violent/controversial films out there, ""Inside"" kept popping up on a lot of the lists I saw out there. So I decided to give a watch. I have to say I was surprised how good this film was. As with most home invasion type films, it had a simple story, with a bit of a twist at the end, which worked pretty well. The production and look of the film was good. The acting, especially by the main protagonist, was very strong. There's a couple of little things, as in the cops making really dumb decisions, that you're going to notice, but that's the case with most horror films in general. One thing that also bothered me a bit was that the last third of the movie is filmed practically in the dark. And it did make it a bit difficult to see what was going on at times. Another minor thing is that the version I watched was dubbed in English instead of just having English subtitles. Personally, I'd rather have the subtitles and the actor's real voices. Perhaps that's an option on the DVD (I watched it by streaming it online) But the strength in this film is the violence, blood, and gore. This isn't for you PG-13 horror fans out there. And though I've definitely seen worse, the film can be pretty brutal at times. So if you can't handle that sorta stuff, I recommend you stay away from this one. Otherwise, if you're a hardcore horror hound, enjoy home invasion films, or just looking for a good, bloody time, this is one I suggest you check out!",1389484800,,1479,4.342960288808665
3076971,5,B00125WATQ,"It's Christmas in Paris. They haven't had a proper Fall and most of the leaves are still on the trees. Young kids are playing in the park, and there is festive peace and quiet as couples walk through the suburbs. An employer is telling off a worker bee, who is pregnant, for being in a car accident which may or may not have been her fault. That evening the pregnant girl is persistently bothered at home by a would-be intruder. She takes flash photos and calls the Police. They arrive, leave the door ajar, compliment her on her neighbourhood, reassure her and leave. They are busy with disturbances in the other suburbs. If you are watching this for the first time an atmosphere of foreboding will have already established itself the moment the screen fills up with blood during the opening titles, and that blood quite quickly spills over into the movie itself. It's difficult to combine suspense and flat out bloodletting, but that's what Inside manages to do, and there is one particularly chilling scene where someone thought long dead turns up in a terrible state and profoundly alters the course of events. It's claustrophobic as well, and all these ingredients work because the Directors have put all the music in the right place according to the action and the script.  If you watch this film late at night you may be glad you got to bed safely. There is an extra ""The making of Inside"" which is worth watching and features actresses practising stunts.

3076975,3,B00125WATQ,"In the 'Making of' feature accompanying the DVD the directors explain that they took a variety of ideas from their favourite movies in what they call a 'thriller/horror' genre.

This works well, as their grasp of the suspense-building nature of the genre is very well achieved - it is literally terrifying at the proper moments and one does not have any desire to start laughing at any point (which can happen if movies in this genre don't manage to pull it off).

The casting is excellent, with Beatrice Dalle quite remarkable as the protagonist who terrifies a pregnant woman.

I won't give away the plot, but the fight sequences are very well executed and difficult to watch.

But, in the final analysis, again without giving the finale away, the film disappointed me - as it turned out to be just another of the increasingly extreme slasher/revenge/blood fests that the French have been churning out in recent times.

With this film, as with another French gore flick I saw recently in which the victim ends up being skinned alive, they seem to be leading the viewer psychologically to something even remotely interesting about the state of the mind, or of existence, of a greater truth, suggesting something deeply anarchic lurking in our souls at a supressed level (this is just a suggestion) - but in both films, in the end they take the easy way out and in a funny sort of way reaffirm the status quo.

This film was so pared back, so sparse, basically consisting of silences interspersed with horrific violence, that I think any claim to making some sort of metaphysical statement, as the French like to think they have the patent for, is fairly silly.

An explanation for the protagonist's extreme actions that would make sense is never provided (I won't spoil the plot), nor are any of the characters developed beyond genre clichs.

The fight sequences, the prosthetics, the makeup team, the direction, the camera work, the acting, set design, music, all is first class. It is as good a production as anything I have seen.

At the final crunch, it just didn't make a whole lot of sense - the all-out violence and gore was difficult to match up against the incident that was ultimately the cause for all the mayhem that ensued.

It would have in my opinion been a far better film if we as the audience had been left wondering who this strange woman was, as the apparent randomness of the stalking in the early scenes together with what followed added so much to the suspense.

I can't say I 'enjoyed' it as it was truly horrific in parts, but not gratuitous, and had me with my hands half over my eyes at some points, so any film that does that has considerable merit.",1377993600,4,2678,4.6525423728813555
3076976,1,B00125WATQ,"I just finished watching ""Inside"". I found it by googling French horror movies and someone recommended ""Inside"". I looked it up and it seemed to have gotten rave reviews so I decided to buy it. It's a story about a pregnant woman who gets into a car accident, she loses her husband but her baby is fine. She is depressed and generally mean. The night before she gives birth a strange woman appears at her house, and things get blood, gory, and violent.

That's basically the entire movie. It is pretty much a mindless gore fest with some artsy fartsy lightening and scenes at times.

Pacing: The pacing was very slow at the beginning, the opening credits were too long and nearly put me and everyone else to sleep. The beginning was also slow and sleep inducing. Only when the stranger appears that the movie begins to pick up and delivers on its promise of ""scary""

Scare rating: Not very high overall. 1 out of 10 and I'll give it a 3 or 4 for when the stranger first appears. The scenes were well done. However, after the stranger is in the house and things get gory the less scary the movie became.

Plot: The movie over all was kind of stupid, the characters did stupid things that just simply made the plot carry on but made no logical sense at all. The stranger drives a pair of scissors through the pregnant woman's hand and she doesn't scream at all despite the police being right downstairs?  One police officer doesn't bother to cuff her right away, he just stands there then lets her grab a weapon? The pregnant woman doesn't cooperates with the police that do arrive. i get it, she is traumatized but seriously she doesn't alert the police to her presence et al even when they are right at the door to get her. A police officer brings a perp into the house with him? wth. But nothing tops the random police offer turned ZOMBIE for no freaking reason!

The police never call for back up, and are pretty much funneled in to be killed.  They leave the pregnant woman alone to find a breaker box while the killer is nowhere to be seen yet all they have to do is escort the victim outside and put her in the police car! Oh yeah and call for back up! suddenly the victim goes to the front door and cannot not unlock it to leave, even though she is INSIDE the house and can just turn the freaking lock and go.

Everyone eventually started laughing at the silly over the topness of this movie and just wanted the pregnant woman to die already so this movie can end.

The only thing that kept us watching was to find out if the movie had any saving grace, it didn't. It's a mindless gore fest, parody like, and nothing more. if this movie was made in the U.S. It would get nothing but one and two star ratings and dismissed as a bad American horror movie with no plot.",1377907200,10,2772,4.335907335907336

3076994,4,B00125WATQ,"This film is basically about a pregnant woman being trapped in her house by the now disfigured driver of a recent car accident that she was a part of.  Unlike most other slashers, the killer is a woman; and the violence is particularly nasty and graphic when she kills whoever enters the house.  There's no nudity in the film, it doesn't have a lot atmosphere because it takes place mostly indoors, and the entire film lacks humor and can be considered dreary and depressing.  The pace is a little slow in parts but pretty fast in others, and the film doesn't have non stop violence from beginning to end; but some of the gore in this film is brutal.  The kills are mean spirited and some may be disturbing to some people.  It's an intense film with a dark and serious tone.  If you are looking for a lighter type slasher that doesn't have a tone that's as dark, like a FRIDAY THE 13TH film, you might not like it.  The directing and acting are pretty good, but I didn't think the replay value matched that of many other classic slashers.

3076995,4,B00125WATQ,"I think directors got to come out with a new formula. The movie was fine and interesting, but something that I am getting a bit tired of, is of being ""manipulated"" in the sense that this movie and others (say like The Human Centipede and the Chaser (Korean movie)) put the characters in situations where they will ALMOST get out, will ALMOST escape, will ALMOST come ahead only to fail miserably at the very last second......I mean, in a sense we all know where the movie is going and what the ending will be. But don't give the audience the ""almost there but NOT really"", kind of scenes because the viewers will learn the gimmick and totally tune out....it is a waste of time and emotion because we already know it will be like The Borg (futile).

The movie was indeed suspenseful and very scary, but not because of the gore or violence, those we already take for granted at these types of movies. Although there are no super powers or super natural forces involved, one is scared at the evil intentions one has and the determination to follow those ways. One is scared not because the other character is bigger or stronger or armed, but because of the evil intentions.

Something that escapes my mind is how a normal woman, who is not a trained killer, is able to leave so much devastation along her way in a few hours?

Something that I did especially appreciate was the fact that when faced with no choice, one will come out with an equal amount of force and determination to survive and to kill as anybody else; yet with totally opposite motivations, and that is when things are even and both sides go at it with everything.",1355270400,,1629,4.496621621621622

3076999,5,B00125WATQ,"There's a moment in ""Inside"" when Beatrice Dalle's character, who is never named, is standing outside of pregnant Sarah's house. She is framed in the darkness, wearing a deep black overcoat and standing absolutely motionless. Sarah is screaming at her, telling her that she's called the police and that they're on the way. Dalle simply lights a cigarette and continues to stare into the room, even as Sarah begins to take flash pictures of her. The shot moves to the outside of the house and all the viewer hears is the ""pfff...pfff pfff...pfff"" of the flash firing. Its the horror that can be felt in that moment that defines what makes the pure, unrelenting terror that comes out of Inside that much different and more intense than anything that has been put on the American stage for years. The horror doesn't come from a killer suddenly jumping out from around a corner, there's no ""oh, thank God its just a cat"" moments, and no characters behave stupidly. The movie plays out as you would expect this nightmare to ever play out if any woman ever went as insane as Beatrice Dalle's character does, which allows the movie to play on a darkly nightmarish level that has been rarely achieved in cinema.

  The plot is simple enough and it is relatively easy to protect a review from spoilers. Sarah is a photojournalist who lost her husband in a car accident and has been left to carry her baby to term alone. And so on Christmas Eve she is planning to spend one more night are home and then travel quietly to the hospital the next day. And then a woman knocks as her door under the pretense of needing help with her car. We quickly learn that what she really want's is Sarah's baby, now, by any means necessary. The rest of the film plays out like an instance of violent domestic war which will leave bodies in its wake. It is one of the most gory things ever filmed and I firmly believe that it would earn an NC-17 rating if it were to be released in mainstream theaters stateside.

  The strength of the film comes from the strength of its acting and its commitment to logic (with one exception near the end, but it's forgivable). Beatrice Dalle, whose early work consisted of roles in which she played a sex bomb, demonstrates an unrelenting commitment to her character that makes me respect her more than most actresses in Hollywood for the reason that the character is so bold that she has put herself at risk to be typecast and this fact would scare away most actresses. And while Alysson Paradis does have to spend some of her role as Sarah crying and blubbering like an annoyingly stereotypical scary movie girl (she is severely injured for the majority of the movie, its forgivable), she reasons logically and does not take her situation lying down, she fights back with a vengeance. As much as I wish that I could speak on the specifics of this, this is a movie that needs to be experienced with a level of surprise. If you can handle the sheer level and intensity of realistic gore played over 90 minutes, then I assure you that this movie is worth your time. It will never lure you into a ""pop out scare,"" but it will leave you deeply horrified.",1350691200,2,3159,4.523642732049037

3077004,4,B00125WATQ,"4 1/2 Stars = Minor Masterpiece

This French film is a white knuckled horror/thriller if there ever was one!

Two women have a terrible car crash. One is pregnant, both her & her baby survive, but her husband dies. The other woman also lives through the accident.

Jump several months a head, & the pregnant woman is close to her time of giving birth. Her life is reclusive, still haunted by her husband's death. Her life is uneventful, that is, until she is terrorized by the woman who she had the car accident with several months earlier. What & why this woman is stalking her like a Shark after a bleeding Seal, is a big question mark??? I won't tell.

What ensues is a taught frightening encounter with a psychotic woman bent on what seems to be simple, but vicious revenge. One may ask their selves, why? People have bad car accidents all the time, without being prey for revenge, & that is part of this movies sadistic charm.

""Inside"" is a relentless exorcise in savage, survival, terror. A film that will have your eyeballs glued & cemented to the screen! Very rarely does a film come out this brutal & vicious, with the suspense of what's going to happen next, almost unbearable! If it was not for a few dumb character moves toward the end of this film, this movie would be a major masterpiece of mayhem! A no brainer for one of the best horror films in years, of the human kind, but unfortunately, there is just enough ineptness in a later scene that knocks this film down a half of notch.

Both are gross films, and I'd be hard pressed to say which is more unsettling. But Martyrs felt hopeless and empty at the end, and while I understand that that was its point, I will never rewatch it. I will almost certainly rewatch Inside, which is just a great, fun horror movie. It has a real slasher sensibility. It's super gross, sure, but it isn't hopeless like Martyrs was. It just feels like everyone involved is having so much fun. The crew, I mean. Not the characters. The characters are decidedly NOT having that much fun. I mean, here's a movie where two women are locked in a house, while one of them tries to TAKE the other woman's unborn baby. It's a gaudy and over-the-top premise and they wring every bit of suspense and horror they can from it!",1316649600,4,870,4.44375
3077008,4,B00125WATQ,"So sick,  gory and creepy I had a hard time watching...

It started off slow but then got nastier and nastier- It's about a pregnant woman who gets in an accident with her husband. The husband dies and she's getting ready to give birth to her baby a couple months down the road. Some mysterious lady shows up knocking on her door. The villain (lady) is an excellent psycho. The lady goes off on the woman whos pregnant and starts killing a bunch of people and anyone who comes to the house.

She wants a baby of her own... Well, let me say when the big secret at the end was revealed I wasn't very impressed. It was like an ""oh yeah"" type of deal. I found the strong point of the movie is the gore and the acting is pretty good.

It didn't take a genius to come up with this concept/storyline but i'd say the whole story was better than a lot of stuff out there. If you're just looking for some really sick/well done horror then this is it.

It's more about the tension, the struggle and the gore than any impressive storyline, in fact I even think its been done before but it's still worth a watch.",1311120000,2,1099,4.18957345971564
3077009,4,B00125WATQ,"Gosh, it seems the French Horror films are really putting us to shame. Somebody better pick up the pace or we can kiss the American Horror films as we know them good-bye. After seeing High Tension & Frontiers, I was convinced that I'd seen the best France had to offer in terms of fright films. Boy, was I ever wrong. Inside is every bit as icky as either & the suspense matches anything were apt to see in theatres lately.

Inside starts out with a very pregnant & bloodied woman by the name of Sarah whose survived a near fatal car crash. Barely alive, the not-so-lucky dead husband sits in the passenger's seat. The aftermath of this accident alone should enough to warn viewers. If you do not like blood, steer clear. You might have to pass this one up.

The next few scenes focus on the young woman who is told by her doctor that labor will be induced on Christmas day. She has already made arrangements to be picked up in the morning from her loft & to be carried to the hospital. Little does she know that an unexpected visitor will be making a special visit that Christmas Eve & she'll spend the next so many odd hours battling off this sadistic creature in a futile attempt to save her unborn child.

This is where Inside becomes interesting & downright creepy. A mysterious woman shows up at the loft & asks to use the phone at an ungodly hour. We then learn she knows more about or protagonist than Sarah could ever hope.

Over the next hour, Sarah fights back to stay alive & each one of her potential rescuers die horrible deaths at the hands of the sadistic woman. Trust me, you will never want to see another pair of scissors again after you see the pain this evil intruder inflicts on anyone that gets in her way.

Inside works well as a great suspense thriller but mainly uses the psychological script as a springboard to deliver the gore in abundance. Fans of Horror films in general should flock to this one & should be happy for weeks after initial viewing. Inside is bleak, brutal, & cringe-worthy in every sense of the word. Horror fans should rejoice once again & hope that Alexandre Bustillo will deliver the goods again soon.",1309219200,4,2150,4.446700507614213

It left you in fear of going into the water, taking a shower ... heckers, it even made you scared to go near a sink hole, by which I mean the drain in the sink for fear that long, black hair tentacles will shoot out of it, not the kind that swallows up your house. Speaking of which, isn't it time for a ""Blood Beach"" remake? Starring Benecio del Toro as Capt. Pearson and Tony Shaloub as Sgt. Royko, directed by Alexandre Aja? ""Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water, you can't get to it.""

Anyway, I'm getting off point. Horror movies even had to have a plot at one time. It was a dark time; humanity could hardly have been referred to as evolved. Thankfully, now you don't have to really think out your ideas before drenching them in dumpstersful of gore. I leave my brain hanging on the coat rack when I go out to catch the latest horror flick.

This is the agony of child birth, done up ""Passion of the Christ"" style so you'll feel like it's something more than the latest Jerry Springer installment, ""I'm Going to Rip That Baby Right Out of Your Filthy Body and Raise It as My Own, You White Witch!""

3077024,5,B00125WATQ,"Far from today's movie trend in unnecessary 3D, nauseating overabundance of (CGI) SFX and appalling and sterile reuse of yesteryear's successes, there is a few excellent horror movies that still succeed at what they are aimed for: creating shock.

`Inside' definitely belongs to this category of movies which favour creativity and audacity to convention and compromise... beyond its very classic storyline: a single pregnant woman is -of course!!- isolated in her house, it's dark and cold outside and nobody cares for her. Outside, a woman lurks around the house and wants to get in. Why? Simple story.

What comes out of the whole product, though, is an absolute, primeval, animalistic violence that breaks the barrier of taboos. The movie's about desperation: how far are you ready to go when you are deprived of your right to give birth? Come on... it's only about the confrontation of two women... well, yes but there's more. Acting's solid. SFX are old-school (ie, no CGI, thank God!). Shooting and picture quality are low-key but efficient. Multiple (unexpected) twists in the story contribute to wanting to see more. But that's the taboo-violating take of the plot that makes the movie stand-out in the constellation of slasher-movies which are way too often calibrated for a teenaged audience with their light gore and free violence and no subliminal message. ""Inside"" is way darker and definitely targets a more mature audience as it spares nothing to no-one, even the unthinkable. Faint of heart parents?

3077029,5,B00125WATQ,"I'd heard about this horror movie from one reviewing fan who suggested it was better than ""The Collector."" When I first read the fan review I thought he had to be joking, something made in France that was better horror than the suspenseful Collector, who ingeniously trapped his victims in a booby-trapped house before killing or ""collecting"" them? No way.

But then I rented the movie ""Inside"" and all I can say to that reviewer now is ""Oui Oui Monsieur!""

The French are fast becoming in horror film making what the Japanese are known for today in automaking; innovative leaders in their field. And their doing it with budgets that appear to be less than generous.

Simply put, the movie ""Inside"" hit a fear nerve in me that few movies of late have even come close to. This movie is not a scary movie in the sense of ""Scary Movie"" Hollywood. This movie...............THIS MOVIE grabs you with its G-O-R-Y intentions and G-R-I-S-S-L-Y assaults.

Unlike the movie ""The Collector"" where part of the thrilling-suspense was the killer's unknown identity and reason for killing, in ""Inside"" you are made well aware of who's doing the killing and what they're after. Its the ""what they're after"" part that makes a grown man like myself jump off the couch and crumble to the floor while watching this movie.

What the movie lacks in cinematography and acting quality it definitely makes up for in raw, in your face horror. The horror becomes even more horrific when you think that the psychotic needs that drive the killer are taken right out of today's news headlines in the real world.

Be warned though, this movie is not for any and everybody. ""Inside"" should definitely come with a Surgeon General's warning printed on the DVD cartridge. But for us already deranged horror movie lover's, its a movie feast we don't wanna miss.

3077030,3,B00125WATQ,"First off, let me say that I'm a HUGE horror fan. I'm a horror fan of all types, be it z-grade oddities, b-grade cheese, exploitation, etc. Hell, I even give the remakes a decent shot at winning me over.

That being said, I'm not entirely sure what to make of this film. I picked it up based on glowing reviews within the horror community; with plenty of ""the foreigners make WAY better horror movies than us Americans!!!!"" to tempt me.

I won't reveal anything plot-wise. But I will say the film is terribly predictable aside from maybe 1 or 2 things. For a film with such a thin plot, I'd at least think that there would be some sort of huge twist at the end. But nope. Once you watch the first 40 minutes, you can pretty much figure out everything that's going to happen.

Now that's not necessarily a bad thing. Like I said, I like z-grade horror oddities (which are generally steaming piles of poop from a critical standpoint). My problem with the film is that it should have been so much MORE than what it turned out to be. It's a terrifying premise, but the film sadly degenerates into an all out gore-fest while leaving the tension and scares...well...in another movie perhaps.

Watch this movie expecting a gore flick. If you expect anything other than piles of gore, then you'll be disappointed.

FYI, for those that are interested, the gore was very VERY well done. If you enjoy seeing heads shredded, eyes punctured, lots of brutal scissor stabbings, and slit/impaled throats with gallons of blood decorating the walls...this is for you.

It was my first French horror so my expectations weren't that high. The first part bored me. If I was watching it at home, I would eject that DVD and find something else to watch. Good thing I wasn't at home when I watched this. Because after the woman was released from the hospital, that dreaded night, I never sat on the chair again. I was standing, pacing around, jumping up and down, while watching!
What worked for the film is that the protagonist is a helpless pregnant woman stuck at home during Christmas Eve. If she was like that Jessica Biel character in Texas Chainsaw Massacre, she would fight back, run around the place and figure out a way to escape somehow. But the trouble is she isn't. And you as a viewer would feel and cheer for poor Sarah.
The effects - the wounds, the slices, the blood all seem real. Good job on that. And what's terrifying is that it happened at home, where most of us think it's the safest place in the world.
There were several 'visitors' whom we thought could help our pregnant victim - the boss from work, her mother and the policemen. They all failed of course, but interestingly, in different ways. I won't spoil it by saying how but it is definitely one of the reasons why one should see this movie -- aside from all the gore and the nail-biting suspense.
I remember asking my friend the whole time why is this crazy antagonist (played brilliantly by the very talented Beatrice Dalle) doing all this... And you will eventually find out why at the end of the film. This is another surprise. You will either understand or hate the villain more.

Sure, we're all pretty much used to blood and gore at this point, but there's an extra squirm factor when the violence involves a pregnant character, especially in scenes where we get flashes of the baby in the womb reacting to the carnage.  An early scene in the film where Psycholady casually inserts a pair of scissors into the sleeping Pregnantlady's bellybutton is sure to get your attention, and more or less sets the tone for things to come.

3077051,3,B00125WATQ,"Inside doesn't disappoint with its gory nature, its violent and extreme portrayal of human turmoil or with its picturesque evilness. The movie is suspenseful and mysterious eough with its dark set, unique camera angles and talented actors. Where Inside fails short of 4 stars is in its premise.

***SPOILERS BELOW***

The movie begins with a car crash where a pregnant young wife accidentally kills her husband and supposedly the passengers in the other vehicle. As the movie progresses, we see the mother-to-be four months later at her ninth month of pregnancy and in deep turmoil. She had lost her husband and by the looks of it she is not very excited about the upcoming birth.

Enter the mysterious woman. On Christmas night (happens to be that same night), while at her house, alone and far away the rest of the world, the young mother is visited and psychologically tormented by a strange woman. And as the mother's fear grows the visitor's violence increases and she ends up braking into the house. To this point, viewers are wondering whether the mother is imaging this woman, or whether there is something seriously wrong with this new character's psyche. And later we find out it's the latter.

As the night progresses so does the depth of violence and gore. While the woman chases the mother, cutting into her with a pair of nasty looking scissors, first the mother's colleague and then her own mother (both somehow end up showing at her house) become victims of the psychotic woman (and in a very gruesome way). Then four more people end up dead (three policemen and one seriously unlucky felon).

The movie ends with the particularly brutal c-section performed by the mad woman and the subsequent death of the mother.

Inside falls short in conveying both the love and obsession of the mad woman (violence doesn't cut it in my book) as we are left to wonder to the very end whether the loss of her own child lead her to a psychological breakdown, or whether she was mad to begin with. Furthermore, the mother fails in establishing a strong character as one is left with confused thoughts about her not wanting the baby in the first place (on one occasion she even held a knife to her womb to prevent the mad woman from killing her) and her depression of being the only survivor of the car crash.

There are a lot of lose ends in the movie that make it a tad incomplete.

I have recommended this film to everyone I can and have gotten no negative feedback yet. Hell, even the making of doc on the disc is fantastic. It really gives hope to all of us that make horror movies on very low budgets.

No CG blood here; just one instance of fire that was the only weird looking part to me, but I was so into it I can't even really complain about it. Fake blood through a hose and pump still work to this day if done with care, as is evident here. To comment on the lighting in the film; some have complained it is too dark at times. Watch the making of and they explain this and I think it will stifle most complaints. They could have put out the making of as it's own disc; it's that good.

It's features innumerable scenes of staring into nothingness and sulking, not to mention the more (abeit) memorable scenes of crawling on the floor screaming. It's poorly acted, poorly concieved (pun intended), hideously paced, and remains nothing but a buildup to an orgasm of gore.

What is a good horror film, you may ask? A GOOD horror film suprises us. It's always pushing our expectations and relies on clever pacing and acting. ""Alien"" is a slow movie, but it's great because we really have no idea what will happen next - each reveal is movement in the plot. Does ""Inside"" have a plot? It's just a woman trying uselessly to fend off some stupid bogeyman.

""The Thing"" used gore as a selling point, but it used it well. The setting was unique, the characters believable, and the violence seemed to come out of nowhere. What good is there when there's only two characters, one irritatingly useless and the other a mute straw-man of evil?

3077055,5,B00125WATQ,"INSIDE is the perfect movie for heartless psychopaths to see with their unsuspecting, pregnant girlfriends! Yes, this movie is all about the truly unthinkable actions taken by an insanely obsessed female of our species. The woman (Beatrice Dalle) is driven, determined, and absolutely relentless in her pursuit. Our impregnated heroine, Sarah (Alysson Paradis) is still devastated by the death of her husband 4 months earlier. She must snap out of her personal depression and go into full survival mode if she plans on protecting what is left of her family. INSIDE makes use of recent, all-to-real news stories about similar atrocities performed on the most vulnerable (I have read or heard of 2 such events). Imagine being a pregnant woman in her ninth month. Now, imagine some nut showing up at your home to take your baby. What would you do? INSIDE is a horror / thriller without limits. Do not expect a Hollywood resolution! In the end, this story is about loss and two very different aspects of motherhood. Maternal drive, vengeance, and the will to protect / survive all combine for one nightmare of a tale! Highly recommended, but certainly not for everyone... P.S.- Personally, I could have done without the most graphic, soul-destroying sequence of the film.

I gave it 2 and half stars for its well produced look and feel.  its definitely uber-production value were dealing with here; pro editing and sound, pro camera work and lighting (or ""atmosphere"" as everyone likes to think of it now daze).. the fx were verrrry realistic (with the exception of the cgi baby; it was obvious that it was in fact a cgi baby)... as far as acting goes, well..pretty good work, that goes for direction too.  all of these things might fool a person into beleiveing they're watching a top notch movie, and as far as production value goes that would be the case.  a person might even be fooled into thinking its a really good movie.. well, thats where i end with the kudos.  actually when you get right down to it the plot is no different than 98% of every splatter/slasher flick youve ever seen in your life (person/people is/are stalked and slaughtered by psycho).  this movie is even complete with bumbling police officers that are just smart enough to get themselves into a situation that they somehow cant seem to handle (surprise surprise!).  there's nothing that interesting going on in this flick really... oh no!  have i forgotten something?! OH WHY OH WHY IS THE PSYCHO WOMAN DOING ALL OF THIS?.. honestly i just thought she was crazy and wanted a baby or something (which is true).  but the final conclusion where you discover the ""truth"" of the matter just makes the movie even more of a farce (come on..think about it).  ok ok, the gorehound is gonna think they're indulging in some high class steak tar-tar when watching this flick.. they're actually going to get the idea that they have some class (sorry i couldn't resist).  but real horror genre patrons out there just might be able to see through the glossy production of all of this only to find a splatter flick that doesnt have anything all that interesting to offer when it comes to ideas and subject matter.  you might say ""well what about all the suspense?"".. what suspense? its a splatter/slasher flick; ALL MUST DIE!!  the suspense might be found in the vehicle for their obligatory deaths..even though you know its just going to be painful and messy.  I can stomach gore, but give me a good reason TO stomach it.  I don't mind the ""ick"" factor as long as there is some interesting subject matter and ideas happening in the movie.  this movie lacks these things.  all ""Inside"" really is is a uber-production value, slick, glossy, vehicle for allot of gore and splatter effects (which are done very well).  if you're a gorehound then this film will be a treat for you; great production and lots of viscera! What a TREAT!  i on the other hand just cant seem to connect what I know as the Horror Genre with this fast tracked trend towards torture and gore (and torture and gore without an ounce of humor in it).  splatter and Horror (Horror as the title given to the genre) aren't necessarily the same thing... and ive always felt that they were in fact seperate, at least ""splatter"" kept seperate as a basement sub-genre.  splatter flicks have always just been unimaginative works used to exploit the ""rubber-necker at a train wreck"" response within human behavior in order to turn a fast buck.. old auteres in this field like herschel gordon lewis and joe d'amato were usually forthright and unapologetic about this truth (which i appreciate).  but anymore this stuff is being pawned off as some kind of high art, which even the likes of loyd kaufman would laugh at.  Im not telling anyone what to enjoy and what not to enjoy..im just trying to say 'be aware of what your enjoying, and don't fool yourself into thinking its something its not'.  i myself enjoy bad b-movies, but i know that they're just bad b-movies and not some kind of high art.  true Art only comes around every once in a very great while; even more so in the Horror Genre.  so don't be fooled by just another French, Nihilistic, ""ohh, life izz sheeet"" splatter flick.. because essentially thats all thats inside ""Inside"".",1239840000,4,4125,4.646005509641873
3077058,4,B00125WATQ,"After losing her husband in a brutal car accident, an embittered young woman named Sarah (Alysson Paradis) on the verge of giving birth finds herself spending Christmas Eve fending off a madwoman intent on violently cutting her baby out of her womb and making off with it. Attempts to help Sarah seem futile, as the insane intruder slays anyone who interferes and would-be rescuers find themselves in the midst of a two woman ""war zone"".

Repulsively graphic and fascinatingly unrelenting, this French horror film from Alexandre Bustillo and Julien Maury is a disturbing and tragic thrillride. The film (also known as &Agrave; l'int&eacute;rieur) starts off a bit slow for my tastes, but once the menacing invader (played by B&eacute;atrice Dalle) comes onto the scene, it kicks into full gear until the finish with its dark and violent story of the madness of motherhood. My only complaint is that the final act is just so very dark at times that it is hard to make out what is happening, even though it seems you are supposed to be able to, and this is a pet peeve of mine actually. Otherwise, it's an excellent work of horror with a lot of well-planned gore and disturbing situations throughout. The DVD comes with an excellent and very thorough making-of featurette and a trailer for the film, and one can opt to watch it with English subtitles, Spanish subtitles, or even an English dubbing.",1239667200,2,1396,4.841004184100418
3077059,5,B00125WATQ,"Once again, an original foreign horror movie puts American horror cinema to shame.  Ever notice how filmmakers in other countries don't remake horror movies?  They make original movies (imagine that)!  Sure, some of those original movies are craptacular, but there are also some gems like this French film.
I had read about this movie (not too much since I didn't want to know too much before watching it), and was skeptical that it would live up to the reviews, but it did and then some.  There were some genuinely creepy scenes toward the beginning, and plenty of violence.  The filmmakers definitely didn't mess around when it came to the violence.
The movie was not perfect - when the police show up, some absurd moments happen - but it's hard to find a movie (much less a horror movie) where that doesn't happen.  It is obvious the filmmakers love the horror genre and, more importantly, knew what they were doing.
My main complaint is with Dimension Extreme/Weinstein Company.  While the company has produced some quality, original horror movies lately (Teeth and 13: The Game of Death, to name a few), why did it sell out to Blockbuster?  They made an exclusive deal with them, so you can't rent their movies from other chains - and a number of people have reported the copies Blockbuster rented were then edited(!).
I digress.  This was one of the best horror movies I have watched in a while, and I'll be interested to see what comes next from these directors.  It is very violent, and has some cringe-worthy scenes, so if you like PG-13 movies (why?), don't bother.  However, if you like horror movies and wonder what happened to originality, or are tired of CGI effects, check this one out - if you can find it.",1239062400,3,1722,4.687707641196013

Beatrice Dalle is probably owed much of the credit in the fear department...her presence alone succeeds in raising hair on the back of the neck.",1237680000,,538,5.195402298850575

The first two-thirds of the film might overwhelm viewers in its gore and relentless horror.  Only towards the end, does the director offer a little comic relief and give the audience a little break.  But only a little break.  Damn, the french love their horror hardcore.

I saw this a year ago at the Walter Reade theater at Lincoln Center and the audience was stunned - but in a good way.  This is one of the best horror movies of the decade, along with The Descent, Them (the French original), and The Orphanage (El Orfanato).  This one is the bloodiest by far, and requires the most suspension of disbelief.  But no matter.  This film succeeds in what it set out to do.  It is meant to be a terrifying, disturbing experience, and it certainly is.  It has all the requirements of a truly great horror movie.  It works both with and against viewer expectations, and I assure you, the final gothic shot will stay with you forever.  This will leave you shaken and terrified.

Fast forward 4 months later, Sarah is released from the hospital after being treated for numerous injuries.  She's in a somber mood, to say the least, after the death of her husband and decides to take up her friend's offer of staying in her cottage to clear her mind.  Alone in the cottage, one night Sarah hears a knock on the door.  It's a mysterious woman who demands to be let in.  She knows Sarah's name and her story.  Sarah refuses to open the door but it's in vain.  The woman wants in to Sarah's house.  And wants her unborn baby too...

This film is very successful at building suspense slowly.  Early on, I almost had the impression I was watching a classic Argento gialli, the suspense was so poignant.  But then halfway through, the film unexpectedly turns into an absolute gorefest.  This is easily one of the most disturbingly graphic and bloody films I've had the pleasure (or displeasure) of witnessing.  It makes ""High Tension"", another French gore flick of recent years, seem like a walk in the park in comparison.

Don't be fooled by Dimension Extreme's insistence on packaging all of their films to look like mindless b-movie gore fests, which annoys me to no end.  ""Inside"" is a very high quality film with good pacing, good effects and yes, great acting.  The pregnant woman is great at conveying simultaneously fear and also a pregnant woman's determination to save her child.  The female villain is also quite something.  I can't remember a female in a serious horror film who's this menacing, this utterly insane, and able to inflict this much damage single-handedly.

In the end, ""Inside"" is definitely required viewing for horror fans but only those who can stomach ridiculous amounts of gore.  The novice horror fan who is safely weaned on mainstream stuff is better off staying away.",1236124800,,1936,4.771084337349397

Call it the 21st century's answer to ""Rosemary's Baby"". One of the elements of its effectiveness as an exemplar of great horror cinema is its methodical stillness that does not feel clinical, but natural and ruminative: like languidly strolling through a horrific car crash accident. The camera looks on with little editing, occasionally emphasizing the spaciousness of the empty big house that is paradoxically claustrophobic with Gothic moodiness and hopeless despair, and all in all, offers a thoughtful examination of its main ingredient: bloody carnage, mostly done with a really sharp pair of scissors. Maternal much? Having seen the outrageously terrifying and philosophical ""Martyrs"", ""Inside"", sadly, seems tame, however slightly, compare to the former's no-holds-barred look at utter human depravity and existential horror. Nonetheless, its ""tameness"" still beats the myriad of unimaginative American horror films that overpopulate the theaters nowadays, and thus, on its own, proves that French filmmakers are some of the best craftsmanships of gut-wrenching and emotionally evocative horror that is gloriously drenched in blood and gore.",1234310400,2,1282,5.824468085106383

3077070,2,B00125WATQ,"If one were to look at Inside on any level other than that of a splatter horror film in the vein of a poor man's Lucio Fulci, it would be a sad response to the current state of horror. Inside is a film that seems like it will only appeal to those who think gore-- no matter how realistic and well executed it may be-- means a film is effective. That would be a falsity. As Inside both lacks in nearly every department aside from conjuring some adamantly gruesome images, and is the antithesis of  both thought and suspense.

Good horror movies for me are not unlike that of suspense or thrillers. In fact they are often much, much better because of their sense of both baroque and dire atmosphere and a feeling of all-bets-are-off bleakness. Whether you are Alfred Hitchcock, Brian De Palma, or Dario Argento you must understand all three of these genres. As Hitchcock put it: ""There is no terror in the bang, only in the anticipation of it.""

Inside is all about the bang. Any sense of anticipation, (with the exception of one humorously ironic scene involving a toaster,) is shoddy and amateur: often being telegraphed long before it happens. Suspense and actual tensions should always be a necessity. Gore without this is simply for pussies. As Inside is a film dependent on startling images, much like the aforementioned films of Lucio Fulci. Yet, in the case of effects, although it may have improved on realistic bloodshed, it sadly lacks the best element of that auteur's Grindhouse output in which the dreamlike and otherworldly whimsy of films like The Beyond is rather traded for nothing of real artistic merit or value.

Though this writer does not have a problem at all with bloodshed, it must be said that after you see a gore scene once, no matter how well executed, you become desensitized; it's just not that effective anymore. It is the bang  without a menacing triggerman--  yet, if you have a scene, gore or not in tact, and have an ample amount of suspense built around character development, pacing, tension and attack and release, then you have a film that will withstand multiple viewings.

Other than bloodshed, Inside tries to make a bleak atmosphere through its use of shadows (doesn't work, by the way) and its angry lead character. Yet, the film does not earn it, rather the character of the pregnant Sarah (Alysson Paradis) feels as static as a walking dead extra in a Romero zombie film. Though the audience knows she is mad at the world and misses her husband, but it falls into telling not showing character development. Inside ""tells"" us to feel empathetic for this character and all the victims due to their ordeal, but it does not establish any sort of relationship with any of them of any worth. Although this may seem intentional, especially involving Sarah's possible more than friendship with her boss,  this sense of mystery certainly doesn't help, rather it just seems lazy.

Of course if one where to really want to they can pick apart many dumb character moves, as well. However, one must know that often you simply won't have a movie without them. Horror, especially this genre, utilizes a narrative that relies on mistakes, often as a commentary--- whether intentional or not, it depicts humans for what they are, flawed animals that often make mistakes when drastic times call for drastic measures. Dumb character moves can be forgiven if they resemble the character. It's again too bad that Inside doesn't have much character depth or layers, which does not exactly help matters when the bad logic comes into play.

The half-twist comes as braindead and unclear as the rest of the movie-- even negates itself in logic somewhat when Sarah mentions that she was told there were, ""No survivors."" A scene involving a believed to be dead character that can be compared to something out of a zombie-movie seems more hokey than anything in context to the rest of this otherwise played-straight film. The final shot of Inside, also, rather feels like it has false feelings of grandeur.

In the end, Inside may have a taboo feel like some of those golden-age horror movies, and possibly can be seen for its no-holds-barred approach with some of its not-easily-shaken images. It's too bad the budget's load was blown on gore shots than a good script.

It starts out with a car crash and then shows a very pregnant Sarah at the doctor's office. Since her husband was killed in the car accident, Sarah seems completely miserable and bitter. I found her unlikeable. She just doesn't seem to care about anything, including her mother and unborn child.

Sarah goes home to wait for the next day when her labor will be induced. It's a rather gloomy evening as it's Christmas Eve and she's chosen to be alone. Not long after she settles in, she has a dream and vomits up a milky substance on the floor. I wasn't sure what this scene was supposed to mean.

The film becomes very scary when the madwoman rings the doorbell and continues to pound on Sarah's door. Sarah calls the police but before they arrive, the woman gains entrance to the house and terrorizes her.

This film is very disturbing and contains the most realistic gore I've ever seen. I gave it 4 stars for that. Some of the characters seem really dumb and there's a scene when Sarah doesn't seem all that concerned about an accident she caused. I can't say more without revealing too much of the film.

The ending special fx are a bit disappointing but when the madwoman's motive is revealed, she becomes a bit of a sympathetic character.

There are several scenes that aren't realistic in the film but the scare tactics and gore make up for them. I recommend this movie for the horror film buff. It had me cringing throughout.",1230422400,,1620,4.511945392491468

The accumulation of eye popping, jaw dropping, and unbelievably sick scenes that occur in a mere 82 minutes are unprecedented, not to mention the loosening of fabric on your couch cushions by clenched fingers.

This French movie creates new standards for big screen visceral anguish, and it sets the bar painfully high. Nothing gets spared here, and you can toss all moral lines out of the window because Inside: Unrated crosses them unflinchingly.

Fair warning, this film is extremely gory, so not for the squeemish at all.  I must say I enjoy watching a movie that actually lives up to its reputation.  The overall plot is excuted well, with little room for wasted moments.  Both actresses are phenomenal, and you as you watch you can't help identify with each of them at one time or another as they are both suffering from tremendous loss, which is an amazing feat considering the brutality being executed on screen.

My only complaints are those annoying little things that hold this back from being a masterpiece.  Most things I can explain away myself, i.e., the cops stupidity is probably due to the exhaustion they are experienceing from combating the ongoing riots.  That bathroom lock is just the best on the market, even if the door itself doesn't seem to be more than paper thin.  And sometimes, that soft spot on your skull just never seems to go away, especially if it is in the front.

I've yet to find an exception to the rule from the past five years. As no French horror film in that time aside from Haute Tension has received as much hype as Inside, I pretty much knew what I was getting going in. It did not disappoint.

Plot: Sarah (The Last Day's Alysson Paradis--yes, she's Vanessa's sister) is awaiting the birth of her baby while grieving the loss of her boyfriend in a car accident. It's Christmas Eve, and she'll be headed for the hospital to deliver her child the next day. Rather than go out and celebrate, however, she decides to spend a quiet evening at home. Not a good idea, as it turns out she's being stalked by a mysterious woman (Beatrice Dalle, probably best known on this side of the pond for Night on Earth) who seems to have murderous designs on her, for reasons unknown. When the woman, who is unnamed throughout the film, tries to get into the house, Sarah calls the police, and the woman vanishes-- until they leave, when she breaks in and tries to kill Sarah, who flees to the bathroom and locks herself in. From there, it's your typical home-invasion thriller (think Panic Room and the like).

One of my problems with a lot of horror movies recently has been their episodic feel, which seems to stem from a lack of pacing in the script; the scriptwriter comes up with a pretty good idea, gets to the end of it ten or twenty minutes in, and has no idea what else to do, so they tack something else on. I can't remember a recent film that gave me this impression more than did Inside. All of the pieces that the film had set up in its first ten minutes were over and done with after forty, less than halfway through the film; the rest is simply a tiring exercise in how long they can drag out their tired formula before culminating the film with a climax so over-the-top gruesome that it raises hilarity rather than disgust. We're treated to set-piece after set-piece of Sarah and the unnamed assailant trying to get one over on each other, people showing up and said assailant having to talk her way out of a jam before dispatching the intruder, etc. And while in the space of eighty-three minutes this could only really have happened a finite number of times, it just seemed to be endless repetition while I was actually sitting through it. And then comes the Big Reveal, followed closely by the climax, and well, I guess it's okay if you're into that sort of thing (which I usually am, viz., say, Baby Blood) and if you're okay with the general badness of the rest of the film (which I am definitely not). If you're simply looking for a gore film, there are many, many better choices than this one. *",1227052800,5,2922,4.457943925233645
3077081,5,B00125WATQ,"Ever since ""Inside"" first hit the DVD shelves, I've heard people praising it's originality, it's suspense and most of all it's gore content. I wasn't sure if I would enjoy a ""French"" horror film after sitting through ""High Tension"" (which was fantastic, except for the ending which made no sense).
As someone who isn't too keen on reading subtitles, I hesitated in watching ""Inside"" for that reason as well. But based on some high recommendations from the good folks found on the horror forum here at Amazon I finally broke down and picked up this DVD.
WOW! It more than lived up to the hype. ""Inside"" is a truly great horror film. The suspense is top notch, the acting is fantastic, and the gore effects are disturbingly realistic. No need to worry about too much CGI in this flick.
The basic story is that one woman is pregnant, and another woman wants the baby....by any means necessary. That's it. No odd psychological twists, no cheap scares, motives are clearly defined for the characters actions, and best of all, it's an ""adult"" horror film. Not meaning it laced with tons of sex or nudity, but that the subject matter is written for adults, not the teen audience so commonly aimed for with the horror genre.
If you want a truly disturbing horror flick, one that will stick with you long after the closing credits, then be sure to pick up ""Inside"" right away.....make sure you see this version before the inevitable American Remake hits the theaters.",1227052800,3,1458,4.7215686274509805

As one reviewer states{Have you ever heard of adoption lady?)This is something a normal person would do,right?There is the issue of the ladies revenge,giving them the reason to make this twisted sick masterpiece of horror.  The emotions run high. The acting was really great. Made me want to look away in the one scene(You know the one)but still,I just had to take it in. If you want horror that disturbs and entertains. Then Inside surely will deliver.  DVD has both orginal french language and english audio dubbed feature along with english subtitles.",1226448000,,582,4.989690721649485
3077083,4,B00125WATQ,"This movie takes you where no horror movie has ever gone before.  It's beyond scary.  One of the darkest, most disturbing, most taboo-breaking of this genre.  And I've seen a lot of them.",1225238400,,187,4.606060606060606
3077084,5,B00125WATQ,"People have wondered lately what's happened to Europe and horror?  Well, wonder no more.  Here it is!  This French-made film may be one of the most horrifying and frightening films to come along in a great while.  Be warned, if you haven't seen Asian extreme films, you may be turned off by this film.  After watching this you'll feel like you were hit over the head by a brick.

The film starts out with a pregnant woman having been widowed after a horrible car accident.  Her unborn child in a sense becomes the memory of her husband, marriage, and dreams.  So though a fighter, there is a sadness around her and her life.  With the setup in place the story begins.  One random evening she's at home watching television and suddenly she gets an unexpected knock on the door.

What we get seems to be just another take of the alone-at-home-at-night film.  But what it turns out to be is so much more.  And when I say this I mean a whole lot more.  This may be one of the most frightening films ever.  Here we have a protagonist who we absolutely care for placed into a dire situation that no one could ever imagine.  The screenplay and directing absolutely has the audience completely fond of the main character and her predicament.

The antagonist is one of the most memorable in some time.  First, it is a woman.  Second, the motivation behind what she has planned is a mystery.  Third, her intensity to get what she wants is spectacular; there's one thing on her mind and nothing is going to stop her.  Topping this, the second antagonist of the film, Murphy's Law (bad luck itself), keep happening to our heroine and in such a realistic and valid way (you won't find any contrived cellphones not working out of the blue or cars not starting here).

Though this film is absolutely a gem filled with fear and terror, it is not perfect.  One character's pre-death scene is absolutely silly when this individual hasn't died right away.  The character's trajedy instead seems too much like B-movie nonsense.  This though can be overlooked since what we have is a tight little horror film great for Halloween!  For the two main leads, both beautiful woman (the antagonist is a former model and very famous in France), there are no gratuitous (or non-gratuitous) nude scenes in this film, something that is usually expected by the horror crowd but shouldn't worry anyone wanting to see this great film.

Last note of interest to any viewer:  the DVD extras are great.  There are some great interviews with those involved with the film.",1225238400,2,2533,4.629213483146067

Meanwhile two truly unnerving French horror films have come out in recent years without attracting much attention: IRREVERSIBLE and I STAND ALONE, both directed by Gaspar Noe.

""Inside"" is a tension marathon that keeps you in a frenzied state untill the wholluping round house kick of an ending. The French take the high road to horror leaving neatly packaged cookie cutter slasher flicks in its wake. The plot is very simplistic, as maternal  instinct is examined to its grimest  possibility. A grieving widow, pregnant and near term, is terrorized by a psychotic woman whos' intent is to cut out her unborn child.

  ""Inside"" is a superb and intelligently written film that will leave you traumatized long after its over. Never before has a film so thoroughly wormed its way into my brain. A rare savage beauty!",1223596800,,784,4.909090909090909

I also found the behind the scenes features very cool.  I normally don't watch a lot of the extra features besides maybe the deleted scenes or alternate endings, but this movie was an exception.",1222992000,,486,4.449438202247191

3077091,5,B00125WATQ,"I just watched this film recently and, as a well-seasoned horror fan, I think that this film must go on my list of the best horror films that I have ever seen.  It is a truely powerful film, but it may not be for you if you are squemish about realistic gore.  There's plently of it in this film.  The filmmakers have sucessfully combined prosthetics and CGI to produce some of the most realistic gore that I have ever seen.

I don't want to reveal too much.  To put it simply, this film is the struggle of a pregnant mother on the night (Christmas Eve) before she is about to give birth and a woman that will do anything, and I do mean anything, to take the child for herself and she is not going to wait for the baby to be born in any natural or regular fashion.  Anyone who trys to stop this woman faces the wrath of someone for whom there is no compromise or reasoning.  The reason why the woman wants this specific child so badly is revealed in a surprising and enlightening twist at the end of the film.  I'll say no more about the plot.

The blood flows thick in this film, literally, and it is unfortunate that this may turn some people away because the two lead actresses, Beatrice Dalle and Alysson Paradis, both turn in excellent, powerful performances.  I don't know too much about French films or actors, but apparently these two actresses are seasoned, well-known actresses and the fact that they both agreed to appear in such an extreme horror film speaks volumes for the quality of the screenplay and that quality is well realized in the film itself.

I've seen many gory horror films, and perhaps I am somewhat jaded about gore, but, to me, this film is one of the few I have seen with a large quantity of gore where I felt that the gore was not, to some extent or in some instances, more extreme than necessary.  The gore in the film is exactly what is necessary to convey the extremity, the instensity, and the absolute horror of the situation.  I congratulate the filmmakers on achieving this balance and on creating such a fine film.

I really regret that the gore in this film may turn some away because, in a time that produces far too many films not worth watching, this is one film definitely worth seeing.  Even if you are squemish about gore, consider watching this film anyway if you like powerful stories, excellent performances, and just-plain-good filmmaking.  You can always close your eyes during the bloody bits.",1222473600,,2445,4.485327313769751
3077092,4,B00125WATQ,"This 2007 French horror film, is surprisingly good.  It has all the gore, but well done and with a good story line.

Briefly, a pregnant photojournalist, Sarah, was involved in a horrible car accident that killed her husband.  Four months later she is ready to deliver the child on Christmas Eve.  Sarah wants to spend the final night by herself.  A knock comes on the door and our ""gap-toothed"" villan appears in the shadows and mutters something about losing her daughter and seems to know a lot about Sarah.  Sarah is frightened and calls the police.  The police find no one outside and promise to send another patrol later that night.  Our villan reappears and gains entry into Sarah's house.  That's where the gore begins...

I loved the use of sissors and knitting needles as a murder weapon for a female villan.  The gore was unbelieveable!

I also liked the camera make that Sarah used for her profession---a Canon EOS!  That's my brand and what I've been shooting with for a few years.  What bothered me about it was Sarah's was a film camera and this is a 2007 movie.  Digital cameras were out for a while and photojournalists were among the first to have them.  So to me it was unrealistic that she had an older camera.  When she needed to enhance the photo of the ""gap-toothed"" villan, it could have been done easily with an up-to-date camera.

The other thing that bothered me was the ""zombie-like"" scene towards the end---what was that about?

All in all this was a good gore fest and one to start off October with.",1222041600,5,1529,4.575645756457565
3077093,2,B00125WATQ,"Beatrice Dalle really delivers here, and the premise is rather unique - too bad it's all undercut by FAR too much gore.

There's a pregnant babe alone on Christmas Eve and due next day
A gorgeous freak who wants to take her unborn child away
There is violence with scissors, guns and even a hair dryer
This film will blow your mind!

There's a car of cops who all get killed in a bloody, ol' display
And a criminal who also gets wasted before the dawn of day

3077099,5,B00125WATQ,"Some time ago I read in a German horror movie magazine about INSIDE (or A l'INTERIEUR in French). The reviewer commented how extreme and tough to watch this film was even for him  as seasoned horror vet.
I have to agree with the reviewer in this magazine. INSIDE is  unbelieveably sick and gory for a mainstream horror film.

Newspaper photographer Sarah is far advanced in pregnancy, but depressed nonetheless, as her husband was killed in a car crash some months ago. She is about to spend a lonely Christmas Eve at home, when a black clad woman threatens her. Sarah calls the police, who can find no trace of the female intruder. The cops leave and Sarah goes to sleep. Her nightmare is only just beginning, as the black clad intruder returns, hell bent to cut Sarah's baby out of her womb...
I will not go into more detail here, but only assure you that it is highly unlikely that you will get to watch an equally gory and disturbing film anytime soon. The movie is sooo sick it beggars belief. And I am an avid fan of horror and gore, of extreme movies of all kind.
The pregnancy of Sarah adds enormous to the unpleasantness. We even get to see the agony of the fetus in the womb! I have not seen something like that before!
And rarely have I seen such insane bloodshed in a film...

INSIDE is no cheapo direct-to-video trash, where rivers of blood should make up for basement production values and gross splatter special effects are laughable due to lack of funds.
No way. INSIDE is a decently budgeted film with top league actors. Beatrice DALLE who plays the vicous killer is an accomplished actress with starring credits in lots of arthouse movies. She may not be a household name in the United States, but DALLE is well known in Europe.
As for the final plot twist and the female killer's identity and motivation (I won't give it away, so don't worry!) I have to say that it did not really surprise me and I am sure that most viewers will expect something of its kind.
Cinematography and score are exceptional and add enormous to the grim athmosphere. The fact that almost the entire movie (except for the lethal car accident and a few scenes in the hospital at the beginning) takes place in Sarah's house (in just a couple of rooms to be precise) give a tense feeling of hopelessness. The close quarters are very cleverly utilized for maximum shock effect.
INSIDE also has some political subtext (if you will), as there are references to the recent mass riots; the cops who return to Sarah's house to check on her, come with an arrested rioter in tow.
Not just in this regard INSIDE reminds one of FRONTIER(S), the
other extreme French horror film (which also has a pregnant heroine!).

As for special features there is the trailer, which sells the film well, and a making-of. The latter runs about 50 minutes or so. I found it very interesting. Beatrice DALLE, Alysson PARADIS and other actors comment on their respective roles and the shot. Both DALLE and PARADIS come across as very likeable women, who had much fun during filming. Much attention is given to the special effects and how they were accomplished. Almost all of the F/X were physical (makeup, props, etc), thankfully there is very very little of the damned computer effects (just a CGI enhanced shot in the head).
This great terror movie comes with the highest recommendation. One last comment: If you like INSIDE, you have to check out the other recent French terror flick, FRONTIER(S) ! It is more conventional and slightly less gory than INSIDE, and while FRONTIER(S) is not exactly a feel good movie either it is not the relentless nihilistic descent into hell like INSIDE. (I still prefer FRONTIER(S).) Anyway, fans of extreme horror need both!",1218844800,,3726,4.647951441578149
3077100,1,B00125WATQ,"!!!WARNING! SPOILERS!!! This movie has got to have one of the most idiotic plots ever. It starts off great. Is quite good through the first 40 minutes or so (though too gory for my tastes). But the moment the cops arrive to check on the heroine, it begins to dreadfully go south. In the last 20 minutes it becomes so absurd and silly that I caught myself wondering whether I was watching a horror movie, or a horror spoof. I'm not a doctor, but I know quite a few, and I'm pretty sure that no one would survive 5 minutes (let alone walk around) after being stabbed with huge scissors in the bellybutton, poked in the throat with a stick, smacked in the head with a toaster, and generally speaking whomped and thrown about the way our heroine does during the course of this movie... While pregnant! No way in heck would an unborn baby survive everything its mother is put through in this film. A woman whose water has broken would be doubled over in debilitating pain every 5 to 3 minutes as her contractions worsen (that I know from personal experience). And didn't they have medical consultants on the set to teach them that C-sections are performed by cutting horizontally just above the mons pubis, not vertically up from the bellybutton? To top it all off, the way the cops behave is totally asinine. What would any cop do upon entering a place that looks like a slaughterhouse? He'd immediately call for back-up. Upon finding the suspect, he'd restrain her and search her. He'd NOT handcuff himself to the perp who's already in his car being brought in for questioning, and drag him along into the slaughterhouse. He'd NOT turn his back to allow the psycho to blow his brains out. He'd NOT leave a pregnant, bloodied victim on her own when the lights suddenly go out while he goes off to look for breaker box.

3077102,1,B00125WATQ,"Oh man, oh man, oh man, what to say about your typical run of the mill modern day horror film?  Not much, as that's what they are, nothing worth noting or remembering.  And Inside is just another one of those, like High Tension, where if the amount of gore a film possessed determined it's brilliance than Citizen Kane and The Godfather would have some harsh competition for greatest film of all time.

But copious amounts of gore do not make a film good, ever; this is the same boring garbage as the Saw films, some of you kiddies will be quick to disagree, but it's true, deal with it.  There's sort of a story, but who cares, because there's tons of blood and stuff.

Inside contains not even the remotest semblance of merit in any regards; there is no suspense, no desire to care about Sarah (whom I'm assuming we're supposed to care about, unless the directors were just doing a poor job of being typically French film makers; here's some people, good or bad, doesn't matter, just watch.)  The use of sharp noises is so redundant and expected that one can't help but let out a laugh at how stupid it is.

Stupid is a keyword when discussing this mess of a film; the story is so unoriginal that it would have taken quite a bit to make it at least seem fresh and interesting, but these boys couldn't even bother with that; hey, here's the same old Argento inspired, but not nearly close to the level of genius in his heyday, garbage.

It's not a horror thriller, because there are no thrills, and definitely no horror; it's a slasher, plain and simple; the lowest level of cinema in it's purest.

The acting is really terrible, and the editing in parts was like rejected footage from a Korn video.

I read several reviews and googled it and thought it might be ineresting since I'm a terror/horror addict. Wow, the movie hooked me in from the very beginning and by the final frame, I wanted a long, hot bath--to wash away the ocean of blood and guts unleashed during the 2 hour running time. The performances by the two main women was simply amazing. One of them is having a baby and the other one wants it. There begins a battle of wits and body. My only questions are minor: why did the victim call the police and they came by to check on an intruder and then left. Why didn't she just move into a hotel for the night. Instead, she goes back to sleep, knowing there's a human monster hiding out somewhere near. Towards the end, when the cops are blown away and the backup comes in, he spends precioius minutes--surrounded by dead bodies--as he tries to get the power back on. Why didn't he race out to his car and call for backup? These questions are minor however since the French cast and crew keep us riveted to the electrifying actions of our two female performers.

This film totally rocks - it has violence and gore to the limit and a suspenseful, well thought-out storyline. I was very pleasantly surprised because being a bit of a gorehound (New York Ripper, Cannibal Holocaust, Aftermath etc.), most films that are meant to be 'disturbing' or 'gory' are neither - take Cabin Fever for instance, so much hype and yet the film was a big let-down. Not so with this French flick - it delivers, and then some. It's well made, very well acted and the violence is just the right tempo for the mood of the piece. Who ever thought that a pair of scissors could do so much damage?

3077105,4,B00125WATQ,"Inside A In'terieur, is a ghastly modern French horror film of the slasher suspense genre. In the more standard films of this kind, there is generally a slow build up as to what the villain might be capable of doing. First, there is the warning signs of their ""off"" behavior. Fallowed by the destruction of inanimate objects, and possibly the murder of Fluffy, the house pet. It is only after a good hour of screen time, when this arch of drama plays out, that we as film patrons get the reward we have been waiting for in this type of story telling. That is when the villain carries out their mission with singleness of purpose, and inflicts harm to actual living breathing human beings before they themselves meet with the iron clad hand of justice. In many ways, Inside still adheres to some of the basic formula to this type of suspense driven story telling. Only in this case, Inside is more like Single White Female on acid. Inside is the very definition of sadistic cinema, so anyone who can't stand the heat better get out of the fire ASAP.

Double your trouble with double mint dreams.

Sarah, played by Alysson Paradis A.K.A., the aunt of Johnny Depp's kids, is a woman who lost her husband in a very bloody car wreck, which she herself survived. Now fully pregnant and waiting out her final days before she goes into labor with her dearly departed husbands baby, she has two very unpleasant dreams back to back. The first starts off like it was lifted from the film Ghost with Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore. While rubbing her distended swollen belly in depressed boredom, her dead husband comes up behind her and joins in on all the caressing, which lovingly leads to a bit of necking. This is fallowed by the sudden jolting image of her husbands head smashing into the windshield, causing Sarah to snap out of her delusion. A moment later Sarah nods off on the couch, only to awake in a coughing frenzy. Suddenly she falls onto all fours and begins vomiting up huge sprays of milk. Then in her agony and turmoil, she manages to fall onto her back and barf up her unborn baby right out of her mouth. She snaps awake this time to the sound of someone knocking on her door. It is at this point in the film that anyone with any common sense in them will have a good understanding of the level of gore and carnage they are bound to witness if they continue to watch this film. In that way, these dreams are pretty much saying "" You've been warned!""

""Will the real Beatrice Dalle please stand up!""

The knock on the door comes at roughly the 20 minute point in the film, and it is none other then the sadistic villain of the film known simply as La Femme. La Femme is played by Beatrice Dalle, an actress who once beat up a meter maid in Paris for daring to ticket her parked car. Beatrice Dalle plays a woman who is, in many ways, beyond mortality. In that she is beyond reason and normal human emotions. Added to this, her whole presence is nothing short of monk like. Cloaked in what seems to be a black bell sleeved ninja robe, she stands and moves with a decisive rigid posture, that is far too severe and driven to be in any way normal. Once in Sarah's house, she fishes for the proper implement to carry out her acts of carnage with the surgical precision of her black gloved hands. While up close, she does nothing to alleviate ones distress of her otherworldy presence, in that her very face is enough to give one a lifetime suply of the ""hebe jebe's"". La Femme has a twisted cruel mouth with big fleshy red lips, containing oversized serrated teeth, that are marked by a huge gap between the front two. She also has an abnormally tall forhead, that peaks out of her parted sleek black hair like a marble shard. She has a near cro-magnon brow which itself drops steeply into deep eye sockets containing steely hard dark eyes. Had this sinister creation been the work of make up artist, it would of been an act of pure brilliance for that department, but as it turns out, This is nothing more then Beatrice Dalle's actual real face. Hell, she is so hideously scary to look at, that I think I might of fallen in love with her. But seriously, if it wasn't for her performance and ultimately her presence in the film, it would not have stood out like it did. No amount of bleak atmosphere or gore, could ever supply the amount of hard edginess that Beatrice Dalle brought to this film. Making the film makers lesson here an obvios one. If you want to make a film that is driven by the brutal acts of carnage of a sadistic mastermind psychotic, then before you do anything else, get yourself a sadistic mastermind psychotic that will make the audience members gnaw their fingers right off.

Sharon Tate is a whimp compaired to Alysson Paradis's Sarah!

To speak plainly, never in the history of cinema has a pregnant character had to suffer so much abuse without surcoming to the laws of death. Fallowing is a list of most of the injuries inflicted on poor Sarah during her brief encounter with Beatrice Dalle...I left out one particular infliction while shuffling the order of the others, in order to avoid spoiling the film.
1) Cuts up her hands using a knife shaped shard of mirror as a weapon and digging tool.
2) Is pulled so savagely by her hair that a sizable handful is yanked out.
3) Gets bashed in the face and head with a toaster that was swung by its cord.
4) Has her water brake on her inducing labor in her attempt to escape from Beatrice Dalle.
5) Gets slashed across both lips by the cutting edge of a pair of scissors leaving a five inch long tear across her face.
6) Cold cocked in the face so hard and unexpectedly that she is slammed into the floor.
7) Has a good one inch of meat above her belly button cut open with the same pair of scissors that were used to slice her face.
8) Is drug across a room by her hair, hit in the face twice and tossed roughly to the floor of the kitchen.
9) Has her face bruitally stomped on twice while already laying on the ground.
10) Has the afor mentioned pair of scissors impaled through her left hand, sticking it to the wall like a beetle in someones bug collection.
11) Is beaten so hard in her pregnant belly by a police baton wielding lobotomized and deranged cop that her birth fluids spill out all over the floor, causing her to slip in the puddle and go flying neck first against the kitchen cabinets.
...And now for my personal favorite...
12) Ruptures her own throat with a knitting needle in an attempt to kill herself, but decides that she wants to live so she duct tapes the bleeding geyser that was her neck on the fly.

I could go into all the emotional torment that Sarah suffers in her one hour of screen time with Beatrice Dalle, especially since Sarah's every rescuer gets grotesquely destroyed by this sadist. From accidentally stabbing her own mother in the throat, to having a cops head get blown off in her face in a shower of splatter, Sarah suffers as much mental distress as she does physical injury. The point here is, that all this brutality goes too far. What gets compromised by all the blood shed is the believability that this could actually really happen. I am not stupid, I do understand that this film is catering itself sylistically, into an endless progression of outdoing its last shock, but such devices come with inherent flaws attached. Had this film not made me utter sentences in disbeliefe like ""Good God woman! Ain't 'cha even dead yet?!""
I wouldn't be here stressing the importance of of doing all you can to not make someone have to suspend their beliefe. Because I am now Beatrice Dalle's newest number one fan after this fair, I would of given this film five stars in a heart beat had it just remained believable all the way through. This to me is the overall flaw of this movie, sadly it came darn close, but just wasn't quite a cigar.
 Nonetheless, it is still a solid bit of sadistic horror entertainment that I can recomment in good conscious to anyone with a soft spot for the sick and unusual. Four stars.",1215993600,,8028,4.441655359565807
3077106,4,B00125WATQ,"It's hard to avoid a horror movie with hype these days. In an age where a successful horror film is either a remake, rated PG-13 or dubbed ""torture-porn,"" we're all a little starved. We all pray for the next classic film to take horror in a new direction and out of the slump it's been in for the better part of the decade. ""Inside"" (or "" l'intrieur"") is an award winning French film, directed by newcomers Alexandre Bustillo and Julien Maury, released here in the states by Dimension home video and if the hype is to be believed, it's the best horror film of the new millennium.

Is that true? Well, no. The film is great, but it's not nearly as scary as the reviews imply, but then again, what movie is? To use a better term, this is possibly one of the most unsettling movies in it's genre, especially given the plot. A pregnant woman, days away from birth who lost her husband in an unfortunate automobile accident four months prior, finds herself alone on Christmas eve and being stalked by a mysterious dark haired woman. What this woman wants at first is unclear, but she stops at no length to ensure that our main character is isolated by dispatching any would-be saviors in some rather grisly ways. Horror movies and pregnancies are always a match made in Hell. Whether it's ""Rosemary's Baby"" or ""Alien,"" it's always a horrible concept that is likely to crawl up anyone's skin. ""Inside"" has an edge where most movie's don't, as our lead is completely alone, trapped and helpless at her most vulnerable at the mercy of a seemingly unrelenting attacker. From the get-go, you feel for her situation and things only get worse as the movie progresses. To say the gore in this movie is over-the-top would be an overstatement, but this is surely one of the most violent and gruesome movies that has come along in recent memory. As new directors, Bustillo and Maury inject a heavy amount of style and intensity into the film. Under diffferent direction, this movie might not have worked as well as it did. Surely, this is a pair to look out for in the future.

The ending leaves a bit open to the imagination, but one thing is for sure: you'll walk away feeling something. As someone who watches a lot of horror, I can certainly say this one caught me by surprise. It's refreshing to know that in this day and age there can be a horror film that manages to have a lasting effect on you. Horror fans will also appreciate references to two classics: ""Halloween"" and ""Psycho,"" obviously massive influences on the making of this film. ""Inside"" is not exactly for the weak of stomach, and surely, like an amusement park ride, if you are pregnant, I would avoid this ride. It might not be all that you expect it to be, but as far as new horror goes, this one is destined to be a classic.",1215648000,,2782,4.5069306930693065

It is perfect from start to finish and never drags.  As another reviewer points out, it makes the Saw franchise look like Disney films.  This is an absolute gore fest and very brutal throughout!

I've seen tons of horror movies and it takes a lot to make my jaw hit the floor but this succeeded a good 3 or 4 times.

If you are put off by subtitles, this is the one horror movie you need to suck it up for!  Besides, there isn't a ton of dialogue, after all it is a slasher movie.",1214438400,,678,4.090909090909091
3077111,4,B00125WATQ,"This is the one exception to the rule, ""Don't judge a book (or in this case: DVD) by its cover."", because if you find the look of this DVD cover gross, disturbing, or haunting...then you've nailed it right on the head.  Inside doesn't hide what it is and from the viewer stand point we can see the labor of love that this movie pours out on screen.

Inside isn't but a simple home invasion movie but what follows is some of the better horror effects and thrills in the genre in some time.  Unlike the recent Strangers, Inside doesn't go for the mental scares but more in-your-face fright.

The movie follows Sarah, a woman whose outlook on life isn't what it once was since she lost her husband due to a car accident.  She is now home alone on Christmas Eve and expecting a baby any time.  Careless of everything now, she is visited by a woman who wants a baby of her own, so much so she is willing to cut it out Sarah's belly herself....and tries she does.

As the movie progress you can't help but feel entranced with its violent and bloody images.  The film doesn't fence nor does it hide its ruthless natured.  You have to hand it to the effects team behind this hidden gem of a movie, to use natural effects rather then CGI nowadays and to make it come off as practical and damn near real, is a feat many people can't pull off.

The movie itself isn't without its flaws.  There's one particular scene at the end of the movie that changes the out come plot.  Since the people involved in that scene were throwaway actors, I felt really disappointed and kind of ripped off at the same time.  Everything before that was almost perfect for what type of movie it is but this just seemed lazy on the writers' part.  Having to put in something that makes people scratch their head only to get the ending they wanted isn't the way to go.  In the end I still enjoyed this flick.

As I said before, depending on your opinion of the cover would I suggest setting down and watching Inside.  Gore hounds will eat this up and people on the fence about it should just jump down and take a look.",1214352000,,2084,4.302564102564102
3077112,5,B00125WATQ,"Forget that, Inside is one of the best horror film of the decade! And certainly one of the best horror films of all time! I picked it up after seeing an ad online, and I was not disappointed at all. From the moment the film starts, your almost on the edge of your seat anticipating the action. And once 'la Femme' shows up... well, things only get more interesting from that point on.

It's a little hard to review horror movies, especially for those who have never seen them, without giving too much plot away, but here we go... The film focuses on Sarah Scaragato, a nine month pregnant journalist who is about to give birth, and her terrifying female stalker who, for some reason wants to cut her open and take her child. With very nasty looking shears. The intensity and horror don't let up for a second either. As various people come to help or check up on Ms. Scaragato, they wind up being killed and/or mutilated by 'la Femme' in various gruesome ways. Yes, a fair word of warning to the squeamish here, there is alot of blood, gore and graphic violence included on this movie, but really they couldn't have done it any other way. It's all quite appropriate to the plot... but no less horrific because of it. And the ending was perfect. I didn't like it, but there was no other way they COULD have ended it. Absolutely brilliant.

On the technical side of things, it was a great movie in general. Alysson Paradis did an excellent job as Sarah, and you really feel for her character. She was cute too... I would definitely like to see her in more stuff. Even the scenes that take place in poorly lit areas were quite well done. The blood, the violence... all of it was scary because it was so believable. I loved it! And it managed to maintain a very strong French character throughout, which is appropriate I suppose, seeing as how it was a French production (and yes, the French culture is very distinctive, even if you can't quite put your finger down on what defines it exactly). If you haven't seen this film yet, I can't emphasize enough that you go out and see it. It is the next step in European horror movies, but much more well done than some of it's predecessors. We have yet to get anything this... intense on this side of the Atlantic, but all I can say is, if this represents French horror films, then by all means keep it up! Great film!",1214006400,,2358,4.405963302752293
3077113,3,B00125WATQ,"OK - in 2003 France came out with a gem of a horror movie called Haute Tension (High Tension in the U.S.). High Tension is one of the best horror films of the decade if you ask me, and a lot of horror critics would agree. It came out swingin' with tasteful cinematography, believable anguish in the wonderfully casted characters, a haunting soundtrack, and the most glorious brutality to grace the silver screen in years.

INSIDE - recommended to me by several people, simply steals the same editor, steals the same music composer (the soundtracks sound almost identical), and then tries to double the gore. Unfortunately, this plan is a little too obvious to me. The majority of the gore feels unnecessary and forced. I began to feel like I was just watching some goons have fun with special effects for no reason at all. I wouldn't be surprised if the director even had his actors watch High Tension and try to copy their expressions of pain and agony to a T. I couldn't help but be turned off by all of this, leaving me feeling like all I have left with the film is an uncreative chain of gory killings, which is no longer anything special in modern horror.

The plot with the car accident and the unborn child starts out seeming like it could go somewhere very visceral and powerful, but instead it stops dead as soon as the villain is introduced and feels trite and pointless. Because of this, the movie loses its emotional aspect and loses a lot of its appeal.

So in the end - What Inside lacks is emotion, depth, and purpose - which unfortunately are probably the most important things in movies! What is strong about the movie and gives it it's 6 out of 10 is in the music, the editing, the violence, and the style - which are all stolen directly from High Tension. See that film instead.

3077114,3,B00125WATQ,"This movie does have a few effective suspenseful moments, and the performances by Beatrice Dalle and Alysson Paradis are truly special. It's just too bad that the whole production is marred by some awful make-up effects (little details that make the blood-n-guts look real were just abandoned here - all too often, Sarah looked like she just needed a towel, rather than a trip to the emergency room.  It really killed the suspense for me in a lot of scenes).  Some silly plot mechanisms also didn't help, and don't get me started on that ridiculous CGI fetus.  However, I still recommend this flick for the performances by the two leads.  While everyone talks about Beatrice Dalle's menacing La Femme (and boy is she menacing), Alysson Paradis' shattered Sarah is what really grounded the movie for me.

If you love your blood and gore and disembowlments to the maximum, then you simply must watch Inside. Yes it is in french, however, since there actually isn't much dialogue in this very short movie, you hardly even notice the subtitles after a while. All I have to say is that I'm glad I wasn't pregnant and watching this. It is the most nightmarish of films and gets under your skin. I haven't seen a film like this in years, maybe never.

3077117,5,B00125WATQ,"I do have to say this movie was quite good.  I had to read the one star people just to see why they even rated this movie one star.  First off this is a gore movie not a horror movie.  If you don't like gore, then don't watch this movie.  Also if you don't like gore then don't rate this movie.  As for all of you that complained about the dubbing, um buy the dvd and it is in French with subtitles.  I mean if you one star people are true horror fans, then you should know this is a French movie.  Watch it in French, unless you can't read then that would explain the reason you complained about the movie.

To give you an idea about how much gore then is in the movie, the ""rating"" people could not allow us americans to watch this movie in the theaters.  Quite frankly after seeing this movie I can see why they would chop this movie up.

All in all it is a great movie about a pregnant women being stalked by a crazy woman.  Once in her house the crazy woman starts trying to get a hold of her.  I can't speak anymore about the movie, I might spoil it for the reast of you.  I can say this, there are a couple of scenes in the movie that might make you turn your head, or make you close your eyes because the directors wanted to do a ""shock shot"", kind of how Hostel did with the eye scence.

3077118,4,B00125WATQ,"Not much I can say about this movie that hasn't alreay been said, but I think a lot of people may have missed out on the element that truly makes this a ""horror"" movie.  Yes, it's got a lot of violence and gore, but there is an element of the supernatural revealed that is never fully explained, and no, it doesn't have anything to do with cops or zombies.

**SPOILER** As for the ""zombie"" cop that another reviewer rhetorically asked about(here's a **SPOILER**, folks):  that cop wasn't killed in the first place.  The Woman did indeed shoot him in the head with his own gun as he was shackled to a handcuffed ""perp"", but the gun she used was some kind of taser gun or other non-lethal weapon.  This was the weapon the ""perp"" referred to as a ""flashbulb"" in the subtitled version of the film.  I also doubt the cop would have given the ""perp"" a lethal weapon to handle in that situation (in fact, I was surprised he gave the kid the taser gun and he gave Sarah a loaded pistol).  So The Woman shot the cop in the head with some kind of taser gun or other non-lethal weapon.  My guess is that when we see him after he turns the lights on, he was disoriented and/or blinded by the shot(s) to his head.  Once the lights were restored I don't know if he could see Sarah, at least not clearly.  When he attacked the heroine, it doesn't seem to make sense at first, but for all we know, he thinks Sarah committed all the murders in the house (in fact, she had earlier told him that she had killed her mother).  Plus, you'll notice he was dragging the lifeless, handcuffed ""perp"" who was still shackled to his own waist.  So I think his part in the movie makes sense.  End of **SPOILER**

Yes, the plot has holes and the film does try to walk a fine line between serious brutal violence and Evil Dead 2-style over-the-top violence that can get confusing at times.  But the performances are top-notch, the pace unrelenting, and it's never predictable or dull.  Trust me, you'll never catch this movie in an American theater.

Inside is a DISGUSTING tour-de-force. It's insanely gory. I think the only other time I have seen this much blood and gore was in Braindead-and I always felt that the gore in that film was done in an almost humorous way.
This is SERIOUS gore.

There's nothing laughable about it. It's unrelenting and flinch worthy.

In fact, I will go as far as saying it's gag worthy at times.

3077125,4,B00125WATQ,"Somebody must be putting something in the Perrier ... there have been a few high-quality French fright flicks arriving on US shores, and INSIDE is the best of those.

Alexandre Bustillo and Julien Maury's film (A L'INTERIEUR in France) is, at it's core, the traditional horror tale: a woman is trapped in her home fighting against all odds to stay alive against a mysterious psychopath.

Been there, right?

Well, not quite.

Bustillo and Maury spice this oft-told story with additional ingrediants: gallons and gallons of blood and gore; a few teaspoons of understated humor; and one special element: a baby only hours from being born.

You see, INSIDE's psycho, The Woman (Beatrice Dalle), is determined to take this baby from our heroine, Sarah (Alysson Paradis), and make it her own. And she is not patiently waiting for the child to be born, thank you. To ensure that she leaves Sarah's home with the child, she's going to perform her own brand of delivery, a sort of murder by midwivery.

INSIDE is completely over the top in several ways: the body count climbs dramatically in what is essentially a duet, and the ways in which each of these victims meet his or her own end are shocking, bloody, and often upsetting. It is no exaggeration to say the movie is awash in blood and gore, buckets of blood and gore. And the violence escalates through to the final scene. Also a word to the wise: use caution with your television volume when watching this flick -- the screaming in several scenes is quite loud ... and quite prolonged. A few of my neighbors were justifiably concerned while I was watching it.

It's not a perfect film ... I thought the few CGI effects of the baby inside the womb were unnecessary, as if Bustillo and Maury had doubts they could bring to life the unborn child as a full-blooded character. And the police officers make decisions which strain credibility ... but some of these actions lead to outrageous, bloody situations that in the long run amplify the suspense and scares.

I would like to point out that I watched the unrated subtitled version of INSIDE. I've seen complaints about edited scenes and poor dubbing in some of the other reviews here. I'm not aware of a dubbed version, and I would guess that an edited or rated version made available by one of the rental chains would be a perfect example of ""missing the point entirely."" My recommendation is to find the subtitled, unrated original.

And lastly, if you are pregnant or considering having a child very soon, don't watch INSIDE. That would make for a whole lot of sleepless nights and future therapy.",1211500800,,2599,4.7196467991169975
3077126,5,B00125WATQ,"I ordered Inside along with Frontier(s) from amazon and both got to my house within a week.  I have to say I was able to see Inside before I was able to see Frontier(s) as the latter was not released for rent or sale at Blockbuster.  Inside, however, was available for rent in it's R rated edited version.  I was satisfied, though a little disappointed.  When the two films arrived in the mail, I was excited to start of with Frontier(s)since I had already seen Inside, and was seemingly excited about it's NC-17 rating.  After Frontier(s) was over, I had about the same feeling I had previously had after viewing Inside's edited version.  Satisfied, though a little disappointed.  So, sunkin', I stuck in Inside's Unrated version I received in the mail, and man!  What a different story.  For me, the Unrated version quite possibly takes the seat as my favorite horror film of all time.  It is also alot more clever in it's use of gore effects than Frontier(s) was.  I know that sounds a little optimistic, but for me, I am fascinated with this new thread of French extreme/shock films.  I have never in my life sat through movies that have created such a sense of tension and terror as these have.  Haute Tension, The Hills Have Eyes Remake, Frontier(s), and Inside are inspiring in my opinion and every bit as good, or better, than even the most acclaimed classic horror films.
Martyrs is supposed to be the next film released in this style directed by Pascal Laugier.  I am captivated by this stylistic and progressive genre of horror encorporating the most striking aspects of all genres of film (Drama, Action, and Exploitation), and combining them into a well produced gem.  Inside does hold the ranks as captain of horror so far in my opinion, but I'm sure there a loads of brilliant ideas begging to be, well, exploited!",1211500800,,1829,4.671875

Horrifying and scary French horror thriller is one of the better and most interesting horror flicks of the new century. It's gory as hell and a little hard to watch at times, i think the acting is well done and the make-up effects are realistic especially the scissors to a person's skull sequence. Director Alexandre Bustillo is now one of the most promising horror directors in recent memory thanks to this unique and ghastly movie, it pushes the limits of violence and insanity to the max in this must see experience for fans of horror and European cinema alike.

It's a really outrageous statement, but it's unbelievabley true,
this is possibly the greatest horror movie ever made!!
(Second only to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre)
A scissor-wielding psychopath(?)
(dressed as the wicked queen from Snow White)
invades a pregnant widows home during the french riots, with the intention of stealing her unborn child.
And she will kill ANYONE who gets in her way. ANY-freakin-ONE!!!
But she's not a villian you hate,
she is silent, queen of her element, but purposeful, pure poker from head to toes.
By the end, you might actually like her, and feel for her.
There's some corny CGI, but it doesn't deter from the horrific experience.
More scares & atmosphere than the original ""Halloween"", (not an exaggeration in the slightest)
as well as an arguably supernatural presence
(which I don't personally buy, but I've heard it argued before.)
and much more gore than ""High Tension"" but with a severely better ending.

3077129,1,B00125WATQ,"This movie was drek.  I can't even begin to describe how awful it was.  But, let's try...

First, the english dubbing was rotten.  The actors-- if one can call them that-- sounded so dry and monotone.

The job of the director and actor is to make the audience feel compassion/sympathy/remorse for the hero/heroine.  To make us care that the protagonist wins in the end.  Thi movie did the opposite.

At the beginning of the movie the protagonist is having a pre-natal examination by her doctor.  She actually cops an attitude with him.  Here is the man who will be ensuring the safety of her newborn and she gives him attitude.  Her acting only gets worse after that.  This supposed heroine annoyed me.  I had NO feelings of wanting to see her win out in the end.  As a matter of fact, I couldn't wait for her to hopefully get killed!

Now, let's talk about the Keystone Cops that show up to help her.  All I have to say is that if these 3 cops are a shining example of the French Police Force then I am SO glad I live in the USA!

WHO THE HECK TAKES AN ARRESTED SUSPECT INTO A VICTIM'S HOME?!?

3 cops are taken out by a woman who had to have weighed 90 pounds at the most.  What cop in his right mind-- knowing he has a killer in custody-- allows that same killer to reach up her sleeve for a knitting needle!?!  And, even after being stabbed in the eye, his training should have kicked in and allowed him to at least put up some kind of struggle.  Anyone ever hear of adrenaline?!  The fight to survive?!

These 3 cops make the cop from the Police Academy movies seem like military strategists.

And, the victim was even more moronic.  She has a chance to escape and she goes to bed WITH THE KILLER STILL IN THE HOUSE!!!!  WTF?!?

This movie only accomplished one thing: it re-affirmed the stereotype that French people are cowards and weak and can't take care of themselves.  The director and producer and actors should be ashamed of themselves that the set back the French image so bad.

If I owned a video store/store/Amazon/etc I would be ashamed and embarassed to allow anyone to see this movie.  This movie should be destroyed.  And, I'm nearly tempted to destroy the DVD right now and just pay Netflix/Amazon/rental store/etc the money that they would be out.  If I can rid the world of at least one copy of this DVD it would be worth it.

My girlfriend and I just wasted-- WASTED-- 1 hour and 19 minutes of our lives watching this drivel.  That is 1 hour and 19 minutes of our lives that we can NEVER get back!  And, the ONLY reason we kept watching was because it was like driving by a car crash.  You knew what you would see would be horrendous, but you had to look anyway.

This movie even set back good horror movies.  It was nothing but a gore fest-- and not even that good-- involving people that were idiots.  And, by that, I mean that if these people in this movie acted this way in real life they would be labeled as mentally-challenged.

Save yourself the time and do NOT rent this movie. It would have been more pleasurable for my to pluck out my own eyeballs so I wouldn't have to watch this to begin with.  Then pouring acid into my ears so I wouldn't have to listen to the even worse dialogue.

I glance through the other reviews for this movie on this Site and I feel disgust that so many people have praised this movie.  My hope for the future dwindles damatically for us as a society.",1211241600,14,3412,4.315457413249211

This bloody, pointless film is about a pregnant woman hunted by a crazy person in her home. She locks herself in the bathroom while the crazy person stabs at the bathroom door with a knife and screams.

But then things get really stupid. The killer is a woman who weighs maybe 120 pounds - she kills four full-grown men! 2 of them are armed cops! One of the cops is in the house when the lights go out, so he goes into the basement to turn the lights back on! Yikes - now THAT'S stupid..

Of course, none of the cops called for help when they were OUTSIDE and they noticed that something was wrong - double Yikes..

In fact it's one of the only flick's made this decade (besides Grindhouse, Girl Next Door and some Japanese stuff) that I really liked. This movie should have definitely had a theatrical release considering some of the other movies that are deceptively passing themselves off as horror films these days. It's got a well written little story (not without flaws, more later), the acting is very good, and it's got so much blood you'll be seeing red for three days. My only minor gripes would be that in the last third of the flick some of the stuff gets a little hard to believe. I could have done without the little bits of CGI (I don't think it really added anything to the movie), and I would have liked a little more depth in the story department.

Haute Tension has absolutely nothing on Inside. Not only is it as gruesome as the other reviews would have you believe, it is absolutely horrifying in concept (pretty much ripped from today's headlines) and technical execution, and wildly unpredictable. The director knows how to create tension with sound and image as well as action - and once the this tension gets built up, we don't get any merciful release via someone jumping out of the shadows. Also probably the most disturbing horror movie I've ever seen - next to this, Argento looks like Disney, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre resembles something off the Travel Channel, flesh-eating zombies seem like the Care Bears. Highly recommended - although I don't really see any but the most diehard horror fans making it all the way through this. It's that brutal.

the acting was good all around, although the english dubbing could've had better voice actors in a couple spots. the camera work was good, helping add to the suspence and shadowy presence of the antagonist.

there really isn't a lot of story here. you can get basically the whole plot minus the villains identity off the back of the case. the main character was in a car accident which killed her husband. now its christmas eve, shes about due to have her baby, and theres a stranger at the door. things are about to escalate far beyond what could've possibly her worst fears, and you are about to enter one of the most tense, bloodsoaked thrillrides of your life.

From French directors Alexandre Bustillo and Julien Maury (rumored to be helming the upcoming new Hellraiser film), Inside revolves around the pregnant Sarah (Alysson Paradis), who is close to giving birth in her condo as Christmas morning approaches.  However, an unnamed, deranged, scissor wielding woman (Beatrice Dalle) arrives, and prepares to wreak all sorts of bloody havoc on Sarah and anyone else that approaches.  While Inside provides heaping amounts of blood and gore, what sets the film apart from all the Saws and Hostels of the world is that the film is actually scary.  The moments of tension and suspense are very well done, and Inside pulls no punches in its moments of brutality and sadism.  For any fan of pure and unrelenting horror, Inside is definitely a must see, but do be forewarned, this is definitely not a film for everyone, and even more so, definitely not a film for the faint of heart.  For everyone else though, gore-drenched films that are actually scary usually don't get much better than Inside, and if this sounds like your kind of thing, you'll be pretty well satisfied with what you get here.",1210377600,,1294,4.828054298642534

don't get me wrong, blood does not bother me, the thing of it is this flick
only worked about two thirds of the time.

it seems to me lately these horror films coming out of france are being made
for the sole purpose of raking in the cash. not only is it obvious, it is BLATANTLY
obvious.

3077141,5,B00125WATQ,"Inside or  l'intrieur is a 2007 French horror film released in the United States just over a week ago.

That would've been nice to see as Inside is definitely one of the scariest and most sick and twisted movies I've ever seen.  I'm 31 years old and this movie actually gave me nightmares but I don't want to overrate the film as your typical bloodthirsty horror-movie goer may be distracted by the actors who mumble enough that you may actually have to read what they are saying (the film is in French of course).  Also, the pace is unnerving and might require some patience from those who appreciate inferior gorefests. This is a very violent film and intentionally so, but it is so much more frightening to watch because it sets you up nicely with great context, writing, and acting.  In other words, if a film was this quality and not a horror film I would still be praising it for these reasons, and fellow cinephiles anticipating good horror know exactly what I'm talking about.  Well, this is the best horror film since Neil Marshall's 2005 film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Descent/dp/B000JBXH8M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Descent</a>&nbsp;and perhaps maybe even Takashi Miike's 1999 film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Audition/dp/B0009WFEDC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Audition</a>.

It is set on Christmas Eve during what appears to be the 2005 riots in France.  I'm not sure those riots continued much into December but it appears to be the backdrop of the film. We follow pregnant Sarah (Alysson Paradis) after her boyfriend was killed in a car accident they both experienced months earlier.  She is stalked by a mysterious woman played by Beatrice Dalle.  Dalle is most famous for her performance in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/372-le-matin-Betty-Blue-to-American-audiences/dp/B0002TSZH4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">372 le matin (Betty Blue to American audiences)</a>&nbsp;over twenty years ago.  She really is a great actress and brings out that fierce psychotic rage again for her role here.  She is dressed in a long black Victorian gown that hides her well in the shadows and gives her a ghostly presence.  This reminded me of some of those great horror films from the silent era and was very effectively used.  It also reminded me of the Hellraiser villain Pinhead, which seemed to connect well with the directors' recent rumored involvement in that remake.  Anyway, Dalle is frightening in this role and absolutely among the most vicious villains to appear onscreen in quite some time.

Other than pushing the envelope in terms of gore, the influences here run deep.  The suspense is effective and we are only gradually given hints about the villain's motives until the end.  How far she will go to get what she wants is another thing we might question, and believe me you cannot even imagine how far she will go.  There are moments at the end of this film that scared me to the point where I felt like looking away.  Moments that rank up there with scenes from great horror films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien/dp/B00011V8IQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien</a>, Audition,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dawn-of-the-Dead/dp/B0002IQNAG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dawn of the Dead</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Suspiria/dp/B00005LQ04/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Suspiria</a>, or even the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Exorcist/dp/B0000524CY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Exorcist</a>, among others.

3077142,4,B00125WATQ,"Having read a lot of reviews on this movie and a lot of the praise it's getting, I had to try this movie out. And boy am I glad I did.

Let me get this out of the way, I do not THINK you will like this movie if you do not like gore in your movie. Cause there is a lot of it in the end. It's not all gore though cause the movie does start off pretty scary also. There was one scene that seriously made me get an uneasy scared feeling. I don't want to ruin it though so I won't mention it here. There were also scenes that made me feel uneasy in a different way... as in a `turn your head and don't look at that gore' way.

Ok now that that is out there, the movie starts out with a car wreck that's already happened. We see a woman, Sarah, bloodied and barely alive. Her dead husband or boyfriend (I can't remember) is next to her in the passenger seat. Sarah is also pregnant.

We see Sarah later at the doc's office. She's getting her baby looked at and is told they'll be inducing labor the next day. She looks miserable, and it's because of her lost love, not her new kid, who I don't think she even cares about anymore.

That night she is visited by a stranger at the door. And we, the viewer, are visited by a really good scary/gory movie. I thought the mood of the movie turned over from a little boring to unnerving to suspenseful to shocking to crazy in exactly the right moments and it was done so well. The atmosphere of the house is so claustrophobic that I constantly found myself having a hard time breathing. You want her to run, but you know she cant just make a break for it for two reason. No room and a big prego belly.

Now there are some things that didn't make sense that might turn some people into haters. For instance...the bathroom door was really easy to pierce with a pair of scissors and a glass shard, but was able to stand up to a bunch of kicks trying to knock it down. Also the cops were pretty stupid. And there are a few other things. But who cares.  The movie was fun and did what I think it wanted to try and do. Scare you... and gross you out.

Scary AND gory. Great movie.

This film will be in the top 100 greatest horror of all time 100 years from now. If this movie was made in the 70s it would have been right up there with the rest of the greats. Being that it has come out after so many other fantastic horror movies, and that its original, in my book makes it a top 20 for sure. I have read alot of the reviews about Inside, and for the most part they are good. My personal opinion noone should give it less than four stars. There is nothing wrong with this film. It gets five stars for everything a horror film has to offer. The gore, the acting, the direction, the atmosphere, the plot and everything else is unbelievably well done. I haven't had a movie scare me in some time now, and this one definitely deliveres the scare tactic.

 I am not gonna go on to tell anything about this movie, because all the other reviews have pretty much stated what the movie was all about. If you want to see a groundbreaking horror film this is the perfect movie for you. Inside deserves every positive review it can get, for anyone who gives it a negative review you might want to steer clear of horror movies for the rest of your life. This film is only for true horror movie buffs like myself that rely on movies like this one. I can not wait to see the next film these directors come out with.",1208908800,2,1818,4.2155172413793105
3077147,4,B00125WATQ,"This for 2000 and up is a very good HORROR movie...Though if you do
not like GORE-or being grossed out stay away from this one....
This is a 7 star movie on GORE level and a 1 and a half star on
story and plot...IN  nutshell you have a pregnant woman who has
survived a terrible car crash but not her husband...Month's later
she is told that the baby is fine and to get rest for her upcoming
birth...We now are at her home and it is late in the evening we hear
a doorbell and our star of the movie comes to the door to see who it
is.  She looks in the peephole and we see a shadowy figure of a girl
(very fine direction I might add) The girl says some line about her
losing her daughter(hmmmm?) And if she could use her telephone.  Our
star is smart and she is SPOOKED out by this person and politely says
no...Well our bad woman does not take no for a answer and here is
when the movie starts.....
I now will point out the bad with the good is this movie..SPOILERS-SPOILERS-SPOILERS-SPOILERS-SPOLIERS
THE BAD.....
1. I myself was confused the way this movie was going? Was it suppose
to take itself seriously or was I watching another DEAD/ALIVE & EVIL
DEAD II(well the movie wants you to take it seriously and sometimes
its hard too) Just read my title and that is what I mean

2. If I saw the baby in the womb just ONE MORE TIME I would have
put my foot through my T.V. That was annoying!

3. Who is the cop turning back on the lights?????? We have ZOMBIES now????
C'MON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

4. Found my self saying are you kidding more than once(NOT GOOD)

5. New the story of the killer right off the bat(so no mystery for me)

THE GOOD.......
1. The two lead actors were VERY good in this(loved the gap-tooth villan)

2. Loved the music in this(always a plus)

3. Special F/X are fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

4. Found myself saying WOW! I can't believe they just did that more than once(VERY GOOD)

5. Funtastic GORE-GORE-GORE and than some GORE!

6. The directing was very good and had some creepiness to it which
you seldom see in a GORE flick

7. One of the top ten grossest movies of ALL time(yaheeeeee bub)

So the good outweigh the bad.  If you love ALL kinds of HORROR
buy this...If your HORROR is more like THE OMEN & THE SHINING
than stay away from this for you will be disappointed.
I am proud I have it and it is right next to THE GIRL NEXT DOOR.
I still feel JU-ON is my tops for 2000(the ghost girl coming down
the stairs says it all for me) but I was very pleased with this

3077148,5,B00125WATQ,"There was a lot of hype behind this movie and honestly, when there is so much behind a film it usually doesn't live up to it. Well, I am happy to say that here it does. I have seen a multitude of horror movies in my life and this is by far one of the most brutal films I have ever watched. The gore is off the charts, and while the movie is bloody as hell, it's realistic and not overdone. And the movie isn't just a one trick pony of amazing gore, it is also very tight and tense thriller. The movie was pulled off perfectly and I look forward to seeing more from these directors. They were slated to direct the upcoming Hellraiser remake but unfortunately dropped out.

And on a side note, if you rent or buy this movie from Blockbuster, you will not be getting the Unrated cut of the movie because Blockbuster forced Dimension to cut 7 minutes from the film. Get your copy of Inside elsewhere for the true experience of unparalleled gore.",1208822400,,941,4.256983240223463

This title certainly didn't do much for me, and in my opinion, certainly didn't live up to other reviews of this title. As far as the 'gore' raved about in this film, it really wasn't anything special with respect to gore type horror films. Really nothing any more, or anything new, than one would expect from this type of film. Certainly even an old film such as the Exorcist far exceeds the 'gore' factor of this film. Sorry I bought it... For those considering purchasing it, rent it first. Oh, and the 'lip sync' or dubbed speech... whatever they did, was pretty obvious.",1208736000,2,699,4.555555555555555
3077150,4,B00125WATQ,"Horror films have been a staple of movies for generations. And each one has had its own film to call shocking, amazing and un-filmable. INSIDE is that film for today's generation.

The story is actually quite simple. The film begins with a car crash in which Sarah (Alysson Paradis) loses her husband yet at the same time finds her in eutero baby remains unscathed. Flash forward 3 months, Christmas Eve, and we see Sarah still a bit battered and emotionally scarred at the loss.

The doctor plans for her having the baby the next day, her mother invites her to her house for the holiday which she turns down and her boss (she's a high profile photographer) makes plans to pick her up the next day to take her to the hospital. It is here that things begin to get twisted.

As she prepares for bed, Sarah hears a knock at the door. Unable to see who it is, the stranger knocking insists she has had car trouble and begs to use the phone. Sarah turns her down, telling her that her husband needs his sleep. The stranger returns retorts by telling Sarah that she knows her husband isn't sleeping because he is dead.

Terrified, Sarah calls the police, moving from the door to the living room where she sees the stranger standing in the window lighting a cigarette and trying to break the glass. The police show and find no one, promising to return later on.

After falling asleep, the camera pans back to reveal this stranger standing over Sarah's bed, a gleaming pair of silver sheers in her hand. As she begins to press these into Sarah's protruding stomach, enough to draw blood, Sarah wakes and the two tussle. While the stranger slashes enough to cut through Sarah's upper lip, Sarah hits her in the head with the table lamp providing enough time to escape to the bathroom, locking herself in.

The claustrophobia is palpable by this time as the stranger continues to beat on the door, calling out to Sarah about how she knows Sarah doesn't want the baby anyway, to let her cut if out.

The night of terror continues with various people stopping in to check on Sarah including her employer and her mother. No one is safe from this stranger who for unknown reasons desperately wants to take Sarah's unborn child. A final confrontation between the two is inevitable. The film doesn't let down on this scene and the final revelation at the film's end is one that satisfies and surprises.

The horror in this film lies in the thought of someone not only wanting to kidnap a child but to actually cut it out of its mother. Never before has such a thing been placed on film that I am aware of and I hope it never comes up again. This truly gut wrenching experience makes for one of the most terrifying nights ever put on film as well as a movie that leaves your skin crawling by the final frame. This gore filled fright fest may not be for everyone, but those willing to sit through to the end, horror fans everywhere, will not be disappointed.

This is the latest in a group of horror films to emerge from France (including HAUTE TENSION and FRONTIER(S)). If it's anything like the wave of horror that we received from Japan over the last decade, expect more nightmarish creations to haunt your dreams.",1208736000,2,3199,4.52076124567474
3077151,4,B00125WATQ,"INSIDE (2007) is a French horror-thriller directed by Alexandre Bustillo and Julien Maury. I've read that these two directors were supposedly poised to direct the upcoming ""Hellraiser"" remake in 2009. I'm not quite sure as to why they are no longer on board for that project, and from what I've seen from this film, the two young filmmakers can definitely repulse even the most experienced movie watcher in the way ""Inside"" focuses in blood and gore. I have a very strong stomach and nothing bothers me; I can stand the most gruesome images and violence as long as there is emotional content. I have not seen a lot of French horror, but one thing I can say is that if this film is any indication, the French can make ""Hostel"" and the ""Saw"" franchise seem like a kid flick. It feels like a homage to the 70's and 80's exploitive gore flicks.

Synopsis partially derived from the dvd back cover:
Four months after a pregnant woman named Sarah loses her husband in a horrific car accident, she is visited on Christmas eve by a mysterious madwoman. Alone and desperate to save herself and her unborn child, Sarah fights to stay alive as each of her potential rescuers dies at the sadistic woman's hands.

Extremely violent, bleak and brutal would be the best words to describe this film. The directors rely on violent imagery to totally immerse the viewer into intense thrills. Blood and gore are omnipresent throughout that gore fans will definitely have reason to celebrate. ""Inside"" definitely tries to push the limits of blood and violence, the subject is focused to give the viewer an uncomfortable sensation. I rather enjoy exploring those places, the dark thematic affairs that make most people turn away. This film may be great for what it is trying to do, but I personally found that it lacked an insightful vision to truly deliver pure effective suspense. It is a straight-forward gore flick that never lets up on the violent graphic details that it felt like a gore show.

Sarah (Allison Paradis) is a woman with little known origins. All I knew about her from the start is that she is pregnant, a photographer, have just survived a car accident and has been widowed by the selfsame accident. Surely, a pregnant woman who had just gone through all these tragedies would automatically promote sympathy and empathy; especially when her one safe haven (her home) has been invaded by a maniacal woman (played by Beatrice Dalle). A pregnant woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown being held prisoner at her own home is truly disturbing and the filmmakers spare no attempts to make the audience feel her pain by visual brutal violence. All the violence that happens to Sarah happens on camera, and on that effect alone, I was more repulsed than impressed. ""Inside"" is a genre film, and to call it a horror thriller is an understatement; it is a sadistic motion picture. It expresses violence against women and what is more disturbing is that the violence is done by another woman. (and others)

Just who is this unnamed woman and what does she want? This is where it gets interesting and quite frankly, the film's best asset. Beatrice Dalle's character is creepy, demented and truly enigmatic. Although in the first half of the film, she seemed to be a little too ""cardboard"" for me, quite a bit ""uniformed"" to be dressed in a black outfit with an unsettling feel. The woman is a ""genre"" character so the success of the villain is all a matter of tone and execution. Dalle's antagonistic character may be more at home with exploitation and highly stylized horror films. Thankfully, her links with Sarah's past may prove to be the film's biggest surprise and will leave folks in awe but it has been marred by a huge plot hole. There are actually some faults in the screenplay such as Sarah's bathroom door; the lock seemed too flimsy that the stalker shouldn't have any problems breaking it open.

""Inside"" is a film that expresses itself through its own bleakness. Unfortunately, suspense is almost none-existent as its tone and execution telegraphs the inevitability of its horrific outcome. The style is bleak, the cinematography is bleak, the film's set up itself is an exclamation point that the worst will happen, but you just have to root for the protagonist. It was the directors' intention; to promote automatic empathy for Sarah. Sadly, they overlooked its dramatic potential and they opted to settle for the use of violent imagery to generate sympathy. There are also some scenes that looked a little too stretched out that made them look like minor ""fillers"" to induce intensity. Actress Allison Paradis does an impressive performance as the character very much in pain and emotional collapse; while Beatrice Dalle's delivers a very creepy, frightening portrayal of our mystery woman .

Overall, ""Inside"" is more successful as a ""gorefest"" than a great addition to horror-thrillers (this isn`t a bad thing). The film is an effective ""gross-out"" feature film that is sadistic, brutal and unrelenting in its execution of violence. If what the directors are looking for is to repulse and shock audiences then they succeed hands down. However, if you are looking for pure, unadulterated suspense that can really get under your skin in a different way, look somewhere else. Folks who enjoy onscreen excessive violence and gore will embrace this film, but sadly it barely made it for me. It had all the dramatic potential but the film just became a vehicle for grim, dark scenarios with a lot of mindless bloodshed. True, the twist at the climax that explains Dalle's behavior may add some ""punch"", but it feels like a throwaway detail because of the huge hole in the plot. It felt like a gimmick that takes a stab at the audience; ""did you see that coming?""...I did, unfortunately.

I do commend the filmmakers that they did have the guts to follow through its very bleak and violent execution; that they knew exactly what they wanted to do and they weren`t pretentious about it at all.

Recommended timidly, rent it first. [3  Stars]

3077152,3,B00125WATQ,"Yes, this film is one of the goriest and bloodiest films I've ever seen.
Yes, the make up is top notch.
Yes, some of the graphic violence here will certainly make most people uncomfortable to say the least.

But after a while, I mean, after the blood bath starts it gets to be just more of the same. Gore and more gore. Blood and more blood. It is all wonderfully done. But the script is boring and predictable. Blood is all you get. (laughs)

A pregnant woman loses her husband in a car accident. Months later, on the day before giving birth to her baby, her house is invaded by a maniacal woman who wants to take the baby from her... literally.

...But what the film is really made up is this: the script is always creating cheap (contrived) ways to put more people in the house for the woman to (over)kill. And after a while, it all gets boring and repetitive.

So, if you are looking for one of the bloodiest rides of your life, climb aboard. This film is for you.
But if you are looking for a great horror story full of new and imaginative insights and twists, look somewhere else.

I gave it three stars because within the ""almost-pornographic violence"" sub-genre where this film belongs to, it deserves five stars... but comparing it to the best things in horror cinema, this deserves one star.

Still it is worth a look... for the eye-popping make up effects. The French know what they do.",1208649600,,1397,4.4375

Okay then, what if I said that this is one of the greatest horror films... ever?  Got your attention now I bet!  Inside is the latest in a line of French horror movies that have provided the goods(the aforementioned High Tension, Them, and the upcoming Frontiers are a few) that American directors should take note of(instead they're too busy searching out their next film to remake and slap a PG-13 rating on).  The premise here is a simple yet incredibly intense one; a pregnant woman very near expectancy, alone on a rainy night, with a madwoman who will stop at nothing to take her unborn baby from her.  The who, how, and why just add to the unrelenting experience... but not before the buckets of blood rain down!  The gorehounds out there will be far from dissapointed, in fact, our lead suffers a brutal attack from a BIG pair of scissors to get the film rolling nicely... leaving a nasty looking gash across her mouth and face for the rest of the film.  Nearly every moment of bloodshed pushes the envelope of not only ""good taste"" but also brutality(the way it should be).  The icing on the cake comes in the form of excellent direction that provides tension as well as some really cool effects(most notably what they do with sound during the kills).  Frightening, gory, and disturbing are all words that fit this movie perfectly, and in the recent horror genre don't find themselves being used as much as most of us would like them to be.  Make no mistake, this is far from ""fun"" horror... there are no sly in-jokes or moments of levity... this is the scene from The Exorcist where Regen uses a crucifix to do the unthinkable to herself, just spread into an hour and a half.  In other words, it's an instant classic that no horror fan should miss(and it gets Dimension Extreme off the hook for a lot of the trash that they have dropped on our laps prior).  *VIEWERS BEWARE*  I heard that the cut of the film that Blockbuster is renting out is edited down by an unbelievable 7 whole minutes so steer clear of that version!",1208563200,44,2304,4.563106796116505

I'm a strong gore hound and this movie actually made me gag.",1208563200,2,375,4.651515151515151
3077156,5,B00125WATQ,"There's a lot of hype surrounding Inside; people are praising this movie as an instant classic. Going into the movie I wasn't sure what to expect. Most of the time a movie with this much hype almost always fails to deliver. But with Inside this movie is well worth the hype and this will go down as one of the greats of the horror genre.

Since 2000 I think there's been a lot of solid horror flicks and despite being in remake hell there are some solid horror flicks, but with that said there are also many problems with the horror genre. For those sick of the typical Hollywood horror film or the angry spirit movie and for those who want a no holds barred movie with extreme violence and not some watered down product, Inside is the movie for you. This is what the horror genre is all about and this is the type of movie Hollywood is far too afraid to produce. Right not France is red hot in the horror genre, and Inside is a movie that shows us why.

Inside starts off a bit slow, but it's never boring. Though I couldn't help, but think it might be one of those movies with all hype and nothing else. But once the suspense kicks in never once does it let up. This is the type of movie that will have you on the edge of your seat until the very shocker of an ending. After you watch the movie the images will be burnt into your head and it's hard to shake.

The screenplay by Alexandre Bustillo was overall quite solid; it's a straight-forward movie and overall quite simple, but very effective. While the characters aren't all that much developed in a movie like this they didn't have to be. The screenplay works well and is always mostly interesting.

Directors Alexandre Bustillo & Julien Maury, deliver one of the most disturbing movies I have seen in ages. Their scenes are well paced and never lag. Inside is a great movie, but there's nothing really ground-breaking. But despite they very much deliver on the thrills and chills and also deliver on some brutal violence. Most of the movie takes place in a house and never once does it get boring. Bustillo and Maury always keep it interesting and eerie.

What makes this work is you never know what will happen next; Sarah played by Alysson Paradis is pregnant and in most movies a character like her is never in danger due to PC Hollywood. But there is some graphic violence against her through out the movie. It's scenes like this that will shock you and you'll be wondering what the filmmakers will do next. Bustillo & Maury don't play it safe just when you think they won't go there they do. They take it one step further and when they do it really shakes things up and you have no idea what these guys will do in the next scene.

Like I said the characters are all that developed, but in a movie like this they didn't have to be. The fact Sarah is pregnant really raises the stakes and makes her sympathetic right off the bat. Seeing what she goes through is just crazy. And seeing some of the violence against her is cringe worthy. This is something you won't see in American horror. Maybe back in the 70s or 80s, but you'll never see anything like this now.

Beatrice Dalle who played La Femme is one of the scariest and most sadistic characters I have seen in a horror flick in quite sometime. Some people were complaining about a female villain. Well make no mistake woman or not she was damn creepy and easily rates as one of the most sadistic this genre has ever seen.

A lot of people talk about how gory this movie is. Well it is quite gory, but not as much as it's being made out to be. It's just that Inside is so brutally violent that people over-do it with the gore level. This movie is quite extreme in the violence and while there is a whole lot of the red stuff to be found it's not as gory as people say it's just that it's so violent. I recommend this movie to any horror fan that wants something a little more extreme. Inside is a deeply shocking, disturbing and violent movie.

Inside starts off slightly slow, but once it gets going it keeps you on the edge of your seat. The suspense and tension never once lags, it's violent and disturbing with a truly twisted ending. Bustillo & Maury push the envelope one step further than any horror film has done in recent memory.",1208476800,7,4255,4.342138364779874

3077160,5,B00125WATQ,"Inside is the story of Sarah, a young woman who on Christmas Eve is expecting her first child. Unfortunately Sarah isn't too happy in the circumstances as a four months earlier she was behind the wheel of her car with her boyfriend when she struck another. She survived with the baby, but unfortunately her boyfriend died. Now months later she's depressed with a bun in the oven. She avoids her supportive mother, gets encouragement from her boss then goes home to spend her last night alone in her home. Unfortunately hours later a woman acting weirdly shows up at her door saying strange things that disturb her. She scares her and brings attention to the police and then settles back down thinking things are alright. Of course this being a horror movie things are very far from alright and later the woman returns brandishing a big pair of shears to cut the baby out of Sarahs stomach. Things don't work out as planned and Sarah is locked in a bathroom while the woman taunts her from outside in the house. Soon people show up to help her and things happen. Horribly violent things.

I had heard a lot of things about Inside before seeing it. Its been called brutal and disturbing which it is. Some said it depended mainly on the killing not interested in a story which in a way it does. But to me I have to admit that this is one of the most brilliant horror films I've seen since catching Audition years ago on cable. It deserves all the praise it gets and to me was leagues better than both Them or Haute Tension. It doesn't sell the story short with characters developed but mostly playing it for the situation. As the first victims fall to the female (only credited as La Femme)  suspense is built up raising tension in the film and actually creating something many horror films don't seem to rely on, actual tension over violence (though like I said thats there as well). The kills are brutal, violent and definitely bloody (this is the first film in a long time that earns its ultraviolent tag) but never sicken in the way they should never making them feel exploitative. And the end is beatifully nihlistic in its tone earning its disturbing finale.

Its a well made horror film that does what rarely happens and actually creates a scary picture. The gore is incredibly well done (more blood flows here than on a Lone Wolf and Cub picture) and the acting is great from Allyson Paradis as Sarah to Beatrice Dalle as La Femme. And the directors do use little techniques to disturb and freak out their viewer (I like one killing that is sad but theres a more disturbing one involving a character who shouldn't be in the situation being cooed by La Femme before being impaled in the head and played with as he dies). This is one of the best horror films I've seen in years. Check it out if you have the heart for it.",1208304000,,2824,4.490272373540856

3311337,5,B00125WATQ,"Directors Julien Maury and Alexandre Bustillo's INSIDE (original title:  L'INTRIEUR) has proven once again that if anyone has their mutilated finger pressed firmly to the pulse of horror, it's the French. This scribe hasn't seen anything quite this cinematically dangerous since their countryman Gaspar No's gut-punch of a flick IRREVERISIBLE, and like that film, INSIDE proves to be a rollercoaster gone off the gore-drenched rails, as well as a film that, while paying homage to the slasher film, redefines the genre itself. Kudos to LA's Screamfest for helping expose this Euro masterpiece to the U.S. masses.

Written by Bustillo, INSIDE has an opening setup that is familiar enough to horror cineastes: A young married couple are involved in a horrific car accident on a rainy country lane, one which the husband doesn't survive. Four months later, his pregnant widow Sarah (portrayed with astounding commitment by actress and sister-in-law to Johnny Depp Alysson Paradis) is scheduled for induced labor. Still mourning the loss of her husband and in a disconnected emotional state, Sarah decides, much to the chagrin of her mother, to spend Christmas Eve alone in preparation for the following morning's birth. It is here where things shift gears following a simple knock on her door, and while savvy audiences will certainly ascertain the identity of the (soon-to-be malevolent) stranger (this scribe did, even before the visually stunning opening credits rolled by), it's the clever road of carnage leading up to--and after--the reveal that will keep those with strong stomachs in their seats, and perhaps drive those with lesser fortitude to a state of nausea.

Pure and simple, the conceit is that Sarah's visitor wants her unborn baby, and isn't content to wait for its natural birth; the intruder's pair of 10-inch shears prove undeniable testament to that. Portrayed with acute gravity by Beatrice Dalle and billed simply as ""La Femme"" (a nod to John Carpenter's ""The Shape""?), this villainess is an altogether terrifying amalgamation of covetous, bloody and remorseless savagery.

More importantly, both women's emotional states and motivations ring true, and thus so does the narrative. However far Maury, Bustillo and producers Vran Frdiani and Franck Ribire push the envelope (and in fact break it), the proceedings, beyond one or two leaps of logic in the third act, carry the audience along effortlessly. There is something raw, familiar and human here, with each character's respective motivations nuanced and believable, and as a result the already red-lined suspense attains an intensity not seen in many years, with an ending that's entirely unpredictable and unquestionably grim.

Assisting considerably in the tension department are cinematographer Laurent Bares and composer Francois Eudes, who together lend an element of dreadful class to the flick, carrying the audience from the at-first womblike confines of Sarah's home to the charnel house it becomes. Bares channels Carpenter's approach to HALLOWEEN in his framing, utilizing negative space and expressionistic lighting to spectacular effect, while Eudes takes a cue from the minimalist synthesized score of Carpenter's classic and delivers an aural component that is at times lulling and at others entirely unnerving.

As for the carnage on display, makeup FX supervisor Jacques-Olivier Molon and visual FX overseers Rodolphe Guglielmi and Bourdonnay Judikael deliver the goods and then some. A self-induced tracheotomy, a partial decapitation by gunshot, an unsettling homage to David Lynch's BLUE VELVET and various burnings, bludgeonings and stabbings, as well as the pice de rsistance (which I won't give away, and must be seen to be believed) are all delivered with such organic viscera that it's nearly overwhelming. The French have apparently perfected the consistency and palate of stage blood; never before has arterial spray looked so damned...real (which is most likely why Dimension snapped it up for straight-to-DVD release via its genre-centric Extreme imprint; there's no way this flick would garner anything less than an NC-17 from the MPAA).

Vive la France!

See it.

After watching 4 or 5 of these types of movies lately (High Tension and Martyrs being the high points), I'm really starting to question the sustainability of the genre.  How long can this gruesome, woman-covered-in-blood thing take itself seriously?  I keep waiting for some irony to start creeping into the French horror I've been watching but the people making this stuff seem dead set on an overbearing seriousness that is natural when watching a movie about brutality but seems stretched a little thin when characters can give themselves tracheotomies with (was that a big hair pin or something?), wrap themselves with some duct tape, and do a few more rounds of battle.  Not a bad movie to watch, and I don't see any reason not to check it out if this is what you're into, but don't expect it t be breaking any new ground concept-wise.",1478304000,4,1007,4.894117647058824

3311357,5,B00125WATQ,"Wow, I was really surprised at how well made this film is.  Obviously, it's French, and their dramas are usually of ""haute qualit"" - but I'm not very well-versed in extreme French horror.  Inside ( l'intrieur) definitely didn't disappoint, and I'm generally a stickler for super gory horror flicks.  The plot is creative, something I've never seen before - something actually scary and more appealing to the fears of women.  I say this because horror is usually much more geared toward male sensibilities.

I love the fact that there is no attempt in this film to provide any comfort or consolation to the viewer, and once the violence starts, it is completely relentless and definitely cringeworthy (in a good way).  This movie gets five stars from me because 1) it's in French and 2) it's totally gross!

This one looked promising and the reviews were overall positive, so we decided to give it a chance.

This movie could have been a contender if it were not for the sometimes shoddy special effects, the obvious twist that we guessed within 15 minutes, the incomprehensible actions of the main character, and an ending that just came completely out of left field.

A mother devastated over losing her lover in a terrible auto accident and having to care for his unborn child is having a rough time going at it alone and suffering from depression on Christmas eve of all times and now is about to be challenged by one of the most vile people ever to step onto the screen.  A madwoman who for no reason knows all about the mother and will stop at nothing to get her unborn child!

Great visuals, superb editing, the sound production was top notch in this chiller of a movie with so much action and gore you almost find yourself rooting for the villain as much as you do for the young woman because neither will stop at nothing to survive the night.

3311407,4,B00125WATQ,"This movie is not for everyone.  It actually isn't really for ME.  I don't really like extreme gore and violence but I have a sort-of ""must be seen to be believed"" curiosity when it comes to films like this.

When I read a review for Dario Argento's ""Deep Red"" that said, ""One of Argento's best known films is a violent shocker, cut for US release.  Pianist Hemmings attempts to solve gruesome hatchet murders.  Dazzling style makes up for story lapses.  Contains graphic violence."" it left me intrigued.

""How violent could it be?"" I wondered.  Turns out, it's pretty damn violent!  Sadly, it's also just as incoherent.

I don't feel the same about ""INSIDE"".  It's storyline is simple but I found it's imagery to be absolutely stunning!

The words on the back cover of the DVD label for ""INSIDE-UNRATED"" only make ONE promise.  With scene after scene of shocking carnage, INSIDE delivers unbelievably realistic gore that dares you not to look away.

And, true to its word, realistic gore is delivered!  It says nothing about a realistic story.  So, Ive decided to view the film as a sort-of semi-surreal work of art.  An ultra-violent horror fantasy!  Like the absolute worst of nightmares one could ever conceive.

""INSIDE"" is very dark, not just in tone but also in lighting!  There's a scene that has MANY people confused (this was evident from the post on the now deleted message boards at IMDB.com).  Look for tattoo's is the only spoiler that I'll offer here.  Other than that, I really liked the look of this movie!  It's gory scenes are still in my head, nearly a week later, which is not so great, but I did get a thrill out of it's action and it's very, VERY brutal villain!",1431820800,,1685,4.656462585034014

3311413,5,B00125WATQ,"It is VERY RARE indeed after the late 1990's to have a horror movie that is truly worth 5 stars . . . but Inside is one of those few.  I try not to ""spoil"" movies, so I will try to be as general, but as thorough as possible without trying to give too much away.  First and foremost, the mark of a TRULY AWESOME horror movie is atmosphere, and this has PLENTY of it.  There is a true sense of foreboding from beginning to end and it is expertly filmed and directed  to enhance the dread that you feel.  Being a Dimension Extreme offering, you know that you can expect something beyond mainstream, but not all DE movies have been as well made and acted as Inside.  While many good horror movies leave much to be desired with the casting and ability of the actors (and actually enhance the movie - think Italian Giallo from the 80's), all of the players here are masters of their craft, especially the ""villain"" (Beatrice Dalle).  If you are a ""gore hound"", your appetite will certainly be satiated, as the phrase ""buckets of blood"" is very appropriate, but well done.  Suspense is plenty here, and you will be on the edge of your seat by the climax of the movie, which, as a diehard horror fan, I can truly say was beyond satisfying.  The story is well written and ORIGINAL.  In this day and age, when PG13 and remakes dominate the genre, this 2007 gem is a horror movie for the genre's ages.

3311444,5,B00125WATQ,"Inside (French:  l'intrieur) was released under the Dimension Extreme moniker in 2007, and looks every bit like a straight-to-DVD flunker that could not find a proper theatrical run. The cover art perpetuates this assumption, as well as the generic stamp across the top of the DVD case that signifies its licensure to Dimension Studios for distribution in the US. It does not help that the rest of the Dimension Extreme franchise just plain sucks, and is a less successful clone of the ""After Dark Horrorfest.""

The year 2000 ushered in a new wave of French horror films that brought many over-the-top slasher movies to international acclaim. The most famous examples are High Tension (Haute Tension), Frontiere(s), Ils, a.k.a. Them, and Martyrs. With the release of Inside, directors Julien Maury and Alexandre Bustillo crafted the movement's crown achievement. While other directors struggled to outdo one another through higher body counts and more gallons of karo syrup, Inside brings a huge amount of artistic merit to a genre that is still stuck in the early 80's. As with Heath Ledger's performance in The Dark Knight, Batrice Dalle's screen villian is one of the most diabolic psychopaths ever seen on film.

Given that the premise of Inside resides in its exploration of maternal possession, this is not a ""girly"" movie by any means. Inside succeeds because its horror aspect transcends gender boundaries. The vulnerability of a single mother hours before giving birth lends this film a layer of terror unknown to American movies. There are no redeeming qualities to this story, only death. Starting with the opening scene, the directing duo applied great skill to ensure that the antogonist/protagonist polarity is worlds apart. La Femme (Batrice Dalle) is Michael Myers without a mask on, taking full advantage of Sarah Scarangelo's (Alysson Paradis) vulnerable state until she has full control of her mark. Incoming visitors are dispatched one after another, walls are painted red with blood, and there are no heroes that save the day. Ultra scary... 5 stars.",1413244800,,2071,5.176119402985075

3311463,5,B00125WATQ,"More bloody fun than an at-home scissors Cesarean, this film will fill your screen with brutal gore like a sprinkler system in Hell, and the gore is matched by the claustrophobic sense of desperation.  This film is a real winner for lovers of extreme violence.

Shortly after the death of her husband, Sarah wishes to spend the holidays alone away from her family while awaiting the birth of her first child.  But when a strange visitor arrives at her home, alone is the last thing Sarah wishes she was.

This film begins at a somewhat slow but interesting pace.  But once the gore comes into play the effects team, sound editors and actors have their work cut out for them as things turn into a messy shockfest full of impalements accompanied by the most visceral of sounds.  Batrice Dalle does a fantastic job as the gap-toothed nameless menace who obsessively wants Sarah's child for her own while Alysson Paradis (as Sarah) is convincingly tortured and terrified.  They each bring their own brand of desperation and, when they clash, you may want to turn away.

Directed by at-the-time newcomers Alexandre Bustillo and Julien Maury (Livid, Among the Living, The ABCs of Death 2), Inside brings all manner of shocking imagery from car crash victims to nightmare birth sequences.  The brutality knows no end as blood spews from stabs to the throat, face, hand, knee and even crotch.  At one point someone's face is blown off in about as fantastic a manner as I've seen.  But the hits just keep on coming and the shocks continue as kitchen appliance assaults, make-shift flamethrowers, an improvised domestic bayonet and some alternative uses for scissors all contribute to the most blood-splattered movie sets I've seen in ages.

This film may have started out slow, but with each palpable laceration our pregnant heroine becomes ever more speckled and smeared red with the heightening mania.  Moving to the finale, we shift from gory and shocking to absolute bonkers neo-natal insanity complete with an at-home Cesarean birthing scene with blood cascading down the stairs.

This is an absolute win for lovers of extreme violence and intense gore.  So put on your favorite gore bib and dig in!",1396742400,4,2195,4.9105691056910565

Sarah has been in a traumatic car accident that took the life of her husband just a few weeks ago. After the accident, she pushes the people in her life away and plans to spend Christmas Eve and the day before her baby is to be born alone. A stranger comes to her door asking to use the phone, but Sarah refuses, saying her husband is sleeping. The stranger harasses her at her house at first trying to coax her way inside with a sob story, but quickly reveals she knows who Sarah is and that she poses a danger. Sarah calls the police and they don't seem to take it to seriously, but they agree to come back to make sure she's ok later. Then the stranger is in her house, chasing her and attacking her, to steal Sarah's baby right out of her body. A bloody cat and mouse game ensues with a shocking, gory conclusion.

Inside is one of the new wave of extreme French horror films and I believe it to be the best of them. Although the film is incredibly gory and bloody, the writing is quite good, especially in the characterization and portrayal of the two women. It would have been so easy to make both of them one dimensional characters, Sarah as good and la Femme (the stranger) as evil. However, Sarah is depressed and alone after the car accident. She succeeds in pushing everyone in her life away and doesn't seem excited her pregnancy or her life. She opts to stay alone on Christmas Eve rather than spend it with her family. Although it's understandable, she's abrasive, cold, and mean, but not undeserving of sympathy. Even though she seems like she's given up on life, she fights ferociously when she and her unborn child's lives are in danger. Many people go through her house as potential saviors, but Sarah stands on her own and survives when all the others are killed by la Femme. Pregnant women (and oftentimes women in general) are  seen as weak and incapable, but Sarah proves to be resilient and strong.

La Femme is also a strong woman. She dispatches person after person who tries to help or save Sarah. Instead of a flatly evil villain, she also experienced tragedy. The same car accident that killed Sarah's husband killed her late-term unborn child. She wants to replace the child she lost with Sarah's and is willing to tear it from her body. This is the most frightening aspect of the film for me, that she doesn't even view Sarah as a person, only as a receptacle for her to take from. I like that it's never revealed who was at fault for the accident because it ultimately doesn't matter. Both women lost something substantial and basically the same things: people in their lives and their mental health. La Femme is obviously insane, but does garner some sympathy because of her loss. She isn't a mindless killer or an automaton, merely a woman driven mad by grief.

The ending is poignant and powerful. La Femme and Sarah battle it out throughout the film relentlessly. Then, a man attacks Sarah, endangering her child. La Femme defends Sarah and they present a united front because they both value the child's life about their own and each other's. Sarah finally outwardly shows tenderness towards her baby. La Femme cares for Sarah as she tenderly cuts the baby out of her, a complete turnaround from the savagery of before. Even though the moment is violent, the two finally understand each other and work towards the same goal.

Inside is an intense and gory film that features two believable, flawed, and broken women. Both of them are strong despite their losses, but make mistakes that cost them. The film has its flaws, the greatest being the CGI baby scenes and unbelievable decisions and happenings requiring a serious suspension of disbelief. However, the positives outweigh the negatives with the atmospheric score, the dynamic portrayal of the characters, and the intense suspense throughout.",1392768000,2,3848,4.651470588235294

3311467,4,B00125WATQ,"In my attempt to tackle the most violent/controversial films out there, ""Inside"" kept popping up on a lot of the lists I saw out there. So I decided to give a watch. I have to say I was surprised how good this film was. As with most home invasion type films, it had a simple story, with a bit of a twist at the end, which worked pretty well. The production and look of the film was good. The acting, especially by the main protagonist, was very strong. There's a couple of little things, as in the cops making really dumb decisions, that you're going to notice, but that's the case with most horror films in general. One thing that also bothered me a bit was that the last third of the movie is filmed practically in the dark. And it did make it a bit difficult to see what was going on at times. Another minor thing is that the version I watched was dubbed in English instead of just having English subtitles. Personally, I'd rather have the subtitles and the actor's real voices. Perhaps that's an option on the DVD (I watched it by streaming it online) But the strength in this film is the violence, blood, and gore. This isn't for you PG-13 horror fans out there. And though I've definitely seen worse, the film can be pretty brutal at times. So if you can't handle that sorta stuff, I recommend you stay away from this one. Otherwise, if you're a hardcore horror hound, enjoy home invasion films, or just looking for a good, bloody time, this is one I suggest you check out!",1389484800,,1479,4.342960288808665
3311468,5,B00125WATQ,"It's Christmas in Paris. They haven't had a proper Fall and most of the leaves are still on the trees. Young kids are playing in the park, and there is festive peace and quiet as couples walk through the suburbs. An employer is telling off a worker bee, who is pregnant, for being in a car accident which may or may not have been her fault. That evening the pregnant girl is persistently bothered at home by a would-be intruder. She takes flash photos and calls the Police. They arrive, leave the door ajar, compliment her on her neighbourhood, reassure her and leave. They are busy with disturbances in the other suburbs. If you are watching this for the first time an atmosphere of foreboding will have already established itself the moment the screen fills up with blood during the opening titles, and that blood quite quickly spills over into the movie itself. It's difficult to combine suspense and flat out bloodletting, but that's what Inside manages to do, and there is one particularly chilling scene where someone thought long dead turns up in a terrible state and profoundly alters the course of events. It's claustrophobic as well, and all these ingredients work because the Directors have put all the music in the right place according to the action and the script.  If you watch this film late at night you may be glad you got to bed safely. There is an extra ""The making of Inside"" which is worth watching and features actresses practising stunts.

3311472,3,B00125WATQ,"In the 'Making of' feature accompanying the DVD the directors explain that they took a variety of ideas from their favourite movies in what they call a 'thriller/horror' genre.

This works well, as their grasp of the suspense-building nature of the genre is very well achieved - it is literally terrifying at the proper moments and one does not have any desire to start laughing at any point (which can happen if movies in this genre don't manage to pull it off).

The casting is excellent, with Beatrice Dalle quite remarkable as the protagonist who terrifies a pregnant woman.

I won't give away the plot, but the fight sequences are very well executed and difficult to watch.

But, in the final analysis, again without giving the finale away, the film disappointed me - as it turned out to be just another of the increasingly extreme slasher/revenge/blood fests that the French have been churning out in recent times.

With this film, as with another French gore flick I saw recently in which the victim ends up being skinned alive, they seem to be leading the viewer psychologically to something even remotely interesting about the state of the mind, or of existence, of a greater truth, suggesting something deeply anarchic lurking in our souls at a supressed level (this is just a suggestion) - but in both films, in the end they take the easy way out and in a funny sort of way reaffirm the status quo.

This film was so pared back, so sparse, basically consisting of silences interspersed with horrific violence, that I think any claim to making some sort of metaphysical statement, as the French like to think they have the patent for, is fairly silly.

An explanation for the protagonist's extreme actions that would make sense is never provided (I won't spoil the plot), nor are any of the characters developed beyond genre clichs.

The fight sequences, the prosthetics, the makeup team, the direction, the camera work, the acting, set design, music, all is first class. It is as good a production as anything I have seen.

At the final crunch, it just didn't make a whole lot of sense - the all-out violence and gore was difficult to match up against the incident that was ultimately the cause for all the mayhem that ensued.

It would have in my opinion been a far better film if we as the audience had been left wondering who this strange woman was, as the apparent randomness of the stalking in the early scenes together with what followed added so much to the suspense.

I can't say I 'enjoyed' it as it was truly horrific in parts, but not gratuitous, and had me with my hands half over my eyes at some points, so any film that does that has considerable merit.",1377993600,4,2678,4.6525423728813555
3311473,1,B00125WATQ,"I just finished watching ""Inside"". I found it by googling French horror movies and someone recommended ""Inside"". I looked it up and it seemed to have gotten rave reviews so I decided to buy it. It's a story about a pregnant woman who gets into a car accident, she loses her husband but her baby is fine. She is depressed and generally mean. The night before she gives birth a strange woman appears at her house, and things get blood, gory, and violent.

That's basically the entire movie. It is pretty much a mindless gore fest with some artsy fartsy lightening and scenes at times.

Pacing: The pacing was very slow at the beginning, the opening credits were too long and nearly put me and everyone else to sleep. The beginning was also slow and sleep inducing. Only when the stranger appears that the movie begins to pick up and delivers on its promise of ""scary""

Scare rating: Not very high overall. 1 out of 10 and I'll give it a 3 or 4 for when the stranger first appears. The scenes were well done. However, after the stranger is in the house and things get gory the less scary the movie became.

Plot: The movie over all was kind of stupid, the characters did stupid things that just simply made the plot carry on but made no logical sense at all. The stranger drives a pair of scissors through the pregnant woman's hand and she doesn't scream at all despite the police being right downstairs?  One police officer doesn't bother to cuff her right away, he just stands there then lets her grab a weapon? The pregnant woman doesn't cooperates with the police that do arrive. i get it, she is traumatized but seriously she doesn't alert the police to her presence et al even when they are right at the door to get her. A police officer brings a perp into the house with him? wth. But nothing tops the random police offer turned ZOMBIE for no freaking reason!

The police never call for back up, and are pretty much funneled in to be killed.  They leave the pregnant woman alone to find a breaker box while the killer is nowhere to be seen yet all they have to do is escort the victim outside and put her in the police car! Oh yeah and call for back up! suddenly the victim goes to the front door and cannot not unlock it to leave, even though she is INSIDE the house and can just turn the freaking lock and go.

Everyone eventually started laughing at the silly over the topness of this movie and just wanted the pregnant woman to die already so this movie can end.

The only thing that kept us watching was to find out if the movie had any saving grace, it didn't. It's a mindless gore fest, parody like, and nothing more. if this movie was made in the U.S. It would get nothing but one and two star ratings and dismissed as a bad American horror movie with no plot.",1377907200,10,2772,4.335907335907336

Unlike most other slashers, the killer is a woman; and the violence is particularly nasty and graphic when she kills whoever enters the house.  There's no nudity in the film, it doesn't have a lot atmosphere because it takes place mostly indoors, and the entire film lacks humor and can be considered dreary and depressing.  The pace is a little slow in parts but pretty fast in others, and the film doesn't have non stop violence from beginning to end; but some of the gore in this film is brutal.  The kills are mean spirited and some may be disturbing to some people.  It's an intense film with a dark and serious tone.  If you are looking for a lighter type slasher that doesn't have a tone that's as dark, like a FRIDAY THE 13TH film, you might not like it.  The directing and acting are pretty good, but I didn't think the replay value matched that of many other classic slashers.

3311492,4,B00125WATQ,"I think directors got to come out with a new formula. The movie was fine and interesting, but something that I am getting a bit tired of, is of being ""manipulated"" in the sense that this movie and others (say like The Human Centipede and the Chaser (Korean movie)) put the characters in situations where they will ALMOST get out, will ALMOST escape, will ALMOST come ahead only to fail miserably at the very last second......I mean, in a sense we all know where the movie is going and what the ending will be. But don't give the audience the ""almost there but NOT really"", kind of scenes because the viewers will learn the gimmick and totally tune out....it is a waste of time and emotion because we already know it will be like The Borg (futile).

The movie was indeed suspenseful and very scary, but not because of the gore or violence, those we already take for granted at these types of movies. Although there are no super powers or super natural forces involved, one is scared at the evil intentions one has and the determination to follow those ways. One is scared not because the other character is bigger or stronger or armed, but because of the evil intentions.

Something that escapes my mind is how a normal woman, who is not a trained killer, is able to leave so much devastation along her way in a few hours?

Something that I did especially appreciate was the fact that when faced with no choice, one will come out with an equal amount of force and determination to survive and to kill as anybody else; yet with totally opposite motivations, and that is when things are even and both sides go at it with everything.",1355270400,,1629,4.496621621621622

3311496,5,B00125WATQ,"There's a moment in ""Inside"" when Beatrice Dalle's character, who is never named, is standing outside of pregnant Sarah's house. She is framed in the darkness, wearing a deep black overcoat and standing absolutely motionless. Sarah is screaming at her, telling her that she's called the police and that they're on the way. Dalle simply lights a cigarette and continues to stare into the room, even as Sarah begins to take flash pictures of her. The shot moves to the outside of the house and all the viewer hears is the ""pfff...pfff pfff...pfff"" of the flash firing. Its the horror that can be felt in that moment that defines what makes the pure, unrelenting terror that comes out of Inside that much different and more intense than anything that has been put on the American stage for years. The horror doesn't come from a killer suddenly jumping out from around a corner, there's no ""oh, thank God its just a cat"" moments, and no characters behave stupidly. The movie plays out as you would expect this nightmare to ever play out if any woman ever went as insane as Beatrice Dalle's character does, which allows the movie to play on a darkly nightmarish level that has been rarely achieved in cinema.

  The plot is simple enough and it is relatively easy to protect a review from spoilers. Sarah is a photojournalist who lost her husband in a car accident and has been left to carry her baby to term alone. And so on Christmas Eve she is planning to spend one more night are home and then travel quietly to the hospital the next day. And then a woman knocks as her door under the pretense of needing help with her car. We quickly learn that what she really want's is Sarah's baby, now, by any means necessary. The rest of the film plays out like an instance of violent domestic war which will leave bodies in its wake. It is one of the most gory things ever filmed and I firmly believe that it would earn an NC-17 rating if it were to be released in mainstream theaters stateside.

  The strength of the film comes from the strength of its acting and its commitment to logic (with one exception near the end, but it's forgivable). Beatrice Dalle, whose early work consisted of roles in which she played a sex bomb, demonstrates an unrelenting commitment to her character that makes me respect her more than most actresses in Hollywood for the reason that the character is so bold that she has put herself at risk to be typecast and this fact would scare away most actresses. And while Alysson Paradis does have to spend some of her role as Sarah crying and blubbering like an annoyingly stereotypical scary movie girl (she is severely injured for the majority of the movie, its forgivable), she reasons logically and does not take her situation lying down, she fights back with a vengeance. As much as I wish that I could speak on the specifics of this, this is a movie that needs to be experienced with a level of surprise. If you can handle the sheer level and intensity of realistic gore played over 90 minutes, then I assure you that this movie is worth your time.

This French film is a white knuckled horror/thriller if there ever was one!

Two women have a terrible car crash. One is pregnant, both her & her baby survive, but her husband dies. The other woman also lives through the accident.

Jump several months a head, & the pregnant woman is close to her time of giving birth. Her life is reclusive, still haunted by her husband's death. Her life is uneventful, that is, until she is terrorized by the woman who she had the car accident with several months earlier. What & why this woman is stalking her like a Shark after a bleeding Seal, is a big question mark??? I won't tell.

What ensues is a taught frightening encounter with a psychotic woman bent on what seems to be simple, but vicious revenge. One may ask their selves, why? People have bad car accidents all the time, without being prey for revenge, & that is part of this movies sadistic charm.

""Inside"" is a relentless exorcise in savage, survival, terror. A film that will have your eyeballs glued & cemented to the screen! Very rarely does a film come out this brutal & vicious, with the suspense of what's going to happen next, almost unbearable! If it was not for a few dumb character moves toward the end of this film, this movie would be a major masterpiece of mayhem! A no brainer for one of the best horror films in years, of the human kind, but unfortunately, there is just enough ineptness in a later scene that knocks this film down a half of notch.

The only irritating part is that once you get used to these horror movies, it gets harder to get shocked.

Last saturday night this movie was on my watchlist. I didn't have a clew about the story or the shocking effect, I thought it was just a standard horror movie. About thirthy minutes later I found myself terrified and shocked behind the television screen. What the hell was this stuff?

She wants a baby of her own... Well, let me say when the big secret at the end was revealed I wasn't very impressed. It was like an ""oh yeah"" type of deal. I found the strong point of the movie is the gore and the acting is pretty good.

It didn't take a genius to come up with this concept/storyline but i'd say the whole story was better than a lot of stuff out there. If you're just looking for some really sick/well done horror then this is it.

Inside starts out with a very pregnant & bloodied woman by the name of Sarah whose survived a near fatal car crash. Barely alive, the not-so-lucky dead husband sits in the passenger's seat. The aftermath of this accident alone should enough to warn viewers. If you do not like blood, steer clear. You might have to pass this one up.

The next few scenes focus on the young woman who is told by her doctor that labor will be induced on Christmas day. She has already made arrangements to be picked up in the morning from her loft & to be carried to the hospital. Little does she know that an unexpected visitor will be making a special visit that Christmas Eve & she'll spend the next so many odd hours battling off this sadistic creature in a futile attempt to save her unborn child.

This is where Inside becomes interesting & downright creepy. A mysterious woman shows up at the loft & asks to use the phone at an ungodly hour. We then learn she knows more about or protagonist than Sarah could ever hope.

Over the next hour, Sarah fights back to stay alive & each one of her potential rescuers die horrible deaths at the hands of the sadistic woman. Trust me, you will never want to see another pair of scissors again after you see the pain this evil intruder inflicts on anyone that gets in her way.

Inside works well as a great suspense thriller but mainly uses the psychological script as a springboard to deliver the gore in abundance. Fans of Horror films in general should flock to this one & should be happy for weeks after initial viewing. Inside is bleak, brutal, & cringe-worthy in every sense of the word. Horror fans should rejoice once again & hope that Alexandre Bustillo will deliver the goods again soon.",1309219200,4,2150,4.446700507614213

This is indeed a 'must watch' for horror film fans who love gore, suspense and a good story line. I am very satisfied with this purchase.

1) Excellent performance by main characters
2) Good picture and sound quality
3) Lots of Gore

3311520,5,B00125WATQ,"There was once a time when horror had to be scary, it made you sit on the edge of your seat so you looked like you were trying to hold in an inconvenient dookie, it made you jump and scream like you were a beehived babysitter at your first Little Richard concert. It left you in fear of going into the water, taking a shower ... heckers, it even made you scared to go near a sink hole, by which I mean the drain in the sink for fear that long, black hair tentacles will shoot out of it, not the kind that swallows up your house. Speaking of which, isn't it time for a ""Blood Beach"" remake? Starring Benecio del Toro as Capt. Pearson and Tony Shaloub as Sgt. Royko, directed by Alexandre Aja? ""Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water, you can't get to it.""

Anyway, I'm getting off point. Horror movies even had to have a plot at one time. It was a dark time; humanity could hardly have been referred to as evolved. Thankfully, now you don't have to really think out your ideas before drenching them in dumpstersful of gore. I leave my brain hanging on the coat rack when I go out to catch the latest horror flick.

This is the agony of child birth, done up ""Passion of the Christ"" style so you'll feel like it's something more than the latest Jerry Springer installment, ""I'm Going to Rip That Baby Right Out of Your Filthy Body and Raise It as My Own, You White Witch!""

3311521,5,B00125WATQ,"Far from today's movie trend in unnecessary 3D, nauseating overabundance of (CGI) SFX and appalling and sterile reuse of yesteryear's successes, there is a few excellent horror movies that still succeed at what they are aimed for: creating shock.

`Inside' definitely belongs to this category of movies which favour creativity and audacity to convention and compromise... beyond its very classic storyline: a single pregnant woman is -of course!!- isolated in her house, it's dark and cold outside and nobody cares for her. Outside, a woman lurks around the house and wants to get in. Why? Simple story.

What comes out of the whole product, though, is an absolute, primeval, animalistic violence that breaks the barrier of taboos. The movie's about desperation: how far are you ready to go when you are deprived of your right to give birth? Come on... it's only about the confrontation of two women... well, yes but there's more. Acting's solid. SFX are old-school (ie, no CGI, thank God!). Shooting and picture quality are low-key but efficient. Multiple (unexpected) twists in the story contribute to wanting to see more. But that's the taboo-violating take of the plot that makes the movie stand-out in the constellation of slasher-movies which are way too often calibrated for a teenaged audience with their light gore and free violence and no subliminal message. ""Inside"" is way darker and definitely targets a more mature audience as it spares nothing to no-one, even the unthinkable. Faint of heart parents?

3311526,5,B00125WATQ,"I'd heard about this horror movie from one reviewing fan who suggested it was better than ""The Collector."" When I first read the fan review I thought he had to be joking, something made in France that was better horror than the suspenseful Collector, who ingeniously trapped his victims in a booby-trapped house before killing or ""collecting"" them? No way.

But then I rented the movie ""Inside"" and all I can say to that reviewer now is ""Oui Oui Monsieur!""

The French are fast becoming in horror film making what the Japanese are known for today in automaking; innovative leaders in their field. And their doing it with budgets that appear to be less than generous.

Simply put, the movie ""Inside"" hit a fear nerve in me that few movies of late have even come close to. This movie is not a scary movie in the sense of ""Scary Movie"" Hollywood. This movie...............THIS MOVIE grabs you with its G-O-R-Y intentions and G-R-I-S-S-L-Y assaults.

Unlike the movie ""The Collector"" where part of the thrilling-suspense was the killer's unknown identity and reason for killing, in ""Inside"" you are made well aware of who's doing the killing and what they're after. Its the ""what they're after"" part that makes a grown man like myself jump off the couch and crumble to the floor while watching this movie.

What the movie lacks in cinematography and acting quality it definitely makes up for in raw, in your face horror. The horror becomes even more horrific when you think that the psychotic needs that drive the killer are taken right out of today's news headlines in the real world.

Be warned though, this movie is not for any and everybody. ""Inside"" should definitely come with a Surgeon General's warning printed on the DVD cartridge. But for us already deranged horror movie lover's, its a movie feast we don't wanna miss.

3311527,3,B00125WATQ,"First off, let me say that I'm a HUGE horror fan. I'm a horror fan of all types, be it z-grade oddities, b-grade cheese, exploitation, etc. Hell, I even give the remakes a decent shot at winning me over.

That being said, I'm not entirely sure what to make of this film. I picked it up based on glowing reviews within the horror community; with plenty of ""the foreigners make WAY better horror movies than us Americans!!!!"" to tempt me.

I won't reveal anything plot-wise. But I will say the film is terribly predictable aside from maybe 1 or 2 things. For a film with such a thin plot, I'd at least think that there would be some sort of huge twist at the end. But nope. Once you watch the first 40 minutes, you can pretty much figure out everything that's going to happen.

Now that's not necessarily a bad thing. Like I said, I like z-grade horror oddities (which are generally steaming piles of poop from a critical standpoint). My problem with the film is that it should have been so much MORE than what it turned out to be. It's a terrifying premise, but the film sadly degenerates into an all out gore-fest while leaving the tension and scares...well...in another movie perhaps.

Watch this movie expecting a gore flick. If you expect anything other than piles of gore, then you'll be disappointed.

FYI, for those that are interested, the gore was very VERY well done. If you enjoy seeing heads shredded, eyes punctured, lots of brutal scissor stabbings, and slit/impaled throats with gallons of blood decorating the walls...this is for you.

3311539,4,B00125WATQ,"Let me start by saying I'm not big with Horror movies, especially not foreign ones. But this one is an exception. I would have never watched this on my own, but since I was sleeping over at a friend's house, I had no choice but to sit through the movie.
It was my first French horror so my expectations weren't that high. The first part bored me. If I was watching it at home, I would eject that DVD and find something else to watch. Good thing I wasn't at home when I watched this. Because after the woman was released from the hospital, that dreaded night, I never sat on the chair again. I was standing, pacing around, jumping up and down, while watching!
What worked for the film is that the protagonist is a helpless pregnant woman stuck at home during Christmas Eve. If she was like that Jessica Biel character in Texas Chainsaw Massacre, she would fight back, run around the place and figure out a way to escape somehow. But the trouble is she isn't. And you as a viewer would feel and cheer for poor Sarah.
The effects - the wounds, the slices, the blood all seem real. Good job on that. And what's terrifying is that it happened at home, where most of us think it's the safest place in the world.
There were several 'visitors' whom we thought could help our pregnant victim - the boss from work, her mother and the policemen. They all failed of course, but interestingly, in different ways. I won't spoil it by saying how but it is definitely one of the reasons why one should see this movie -- aside from all the gore and the nail-biting suspense.
I remember asking my friend the whole time why is this crazy antagonist (played brilliantly by the very talented Beatrice Dalle) doing all this... And you will eventually find out why at the end of the film. This is another surprise. You will either understand or hate the villain more.

But having recently watched Inside I realize that things aren't so bad, and can definitely be worse.  This wacky French thriller about a pregnant woman terrorized in her home by a lunatic woman hellbent on taking her baby(with a pair of scissors no less) aims to kick the viewer in the teeth.  And if you are able to get by some illogical scenes-mostly involving bumbling police officers-it really does.  Sure, we're all pretty much used to blood and gore at this point, but there's an extra squirm factor when the violence involves a pregnant character, especially in scenes where we get flashes of the baby in the womb reacting to the carnage.  An early scene in the film where Psycholady casually inserts a pair of scissors into the sleeping Pregnantlady's bellybutton is sure to get your attention, and more or less sets the tone for things to come.

3311548,3,B00125WATQ,"Inside doesn't disappoint with its gory nature, its violent and extreme portrayal of human turmoil or with its picturesque evilness. The movie is suspenseful and mysterious eough with its dark set, unique camera angles and talented actors. Where Inside fails short of 4 stars is in its premise.

***SPOILERS BELOW***

The movie begins with a car crash where a pregnant young wife accidentally kills her husband and supposedly the passengers in the other vehicle. As the movie progresses, we see the mother-to-be four months later at her ninth month of pregnancy and in deep turmoil. She had lost her husband and by the looks of it she is not very excited about the upcoming birth.

Enter the mysterious woman. On Christmas night (happens to be that same night), while at her house, alone and far away the rest of the world, the young mother is visited and psychologically tormented by a strange woman. And as the mother's fear grows the visitor's violence increases and she ends up braking into the house. To this point, viewers are wondering whether the mother is imaging this woman, or whether there is something seriously wrong with this new character's psyche. And later we find out it's the latter.

As the night progresses so does the depth of violence and gore. While the woman chases the mother, cutting into her with a pair of nasty looking scissors, first the mother's colleague and then her own mother (both somehow end up showing at her house) become victims of the psychotic woman (and in a very gruesome way). Then four more people end up dead (three policemen and one seriously unlucky felon).

The movie ends with the particularly brutal c-section performed by the mad woman and the subsequent death of the mother.

Inside falls short in conveying both the love and obsession of the mad woman (violence doesn't cut it in my book) as we are left to wonder to the very end whether the loss of her own child lead her to a psychological breakdown, or whether she was mad to begin with. Furthermore, the mother fails in establishing a strong character as one is left with confused thoughts about her not wanting the baby in the first place (on one occasion she even held a knife to her womb to prevent the mad woman from killing her) and her depression of being the only survivor of the car crash.

There are a lot of lose ends in the movie that make it a tad incomplete.

) Funny Games",1244246400,,2474,4.655963302752293

I have recommended this film to everyone I can and have gotten no negative feedback yet. Hell, even the making of doc on the disc is fantastic. It really gives hope to all of us that make horror movies on very low budgets. Now that is not to say it is of low quality; it's just amazing how they got it to look so good using good old fashioned old school horror tech. No CG blood here; just one instance of fire that was the only weird looking part to me, but I was so into it I can't even really complain about it. Fake blood through a hose and pump still work to this day if done with care, as is evident here. To comment on the lighting in the film; some have complained it is too dark at times. Watch the making of and they explain this and I think it will stifle most complaints. They could have put out the making of as it's own disc; it's that good.

It's poorly acted, poorly concieved (pun intended), hideously paced, and remains nothing but a buildup to an orgasm of gore.

What is a good horror film, you may ask? A GOOD horror film suprises us. It's always pushing our expectations and relies on clever pacing and acting. ""Alien"" is a slow movie, but it's great because we really have no idea what will happen next - each reveal is movement in the plot. Does ""Inside"" have a plot? It's just a woman trying uselessly to fend off some stupid bogeyman.

""The Thing"" used gore as a selling point, but it used it well. The setting was unique, the characters believable, and the violence seemed to come out of nowhere. What good is there when there's only two characters, one irritatingly useless and the other a mute straw-man of evil?

I gave it 2 and half stars for its well produced look and feel.  its definitely uber-production value were dealing with here; pro editing and sound, pro camera work and lighting (or ""atmosphere"" as everyone likes to think of it now daze).. the fx were verrrry realistic (with the exception of the cgi baby; it was obvious that it was in fact a cgi baby)... as far as acting goes, well..pretty good work, that goes for direction too.  all of these things might fool a person into beleiveing they're watching a top notch movie, and as far as production value goes that would be the case.  a person might even be fooled into thinking its a really good movie.. well, thats where i end with the kudos.  actually when you get right down to it the plot is no different than 98% of every splatter/slasher flick youve ever seen in your life (person/people is/are stalked and slaughtered by psycho).  this movie is even complete with bumbling police officers that are just smart enough to get themselves into a situation that they somehow cant seem to handle (surprise surprise!).  there's nothing that interesting going on in this flick really... oh no!  have i forgotten something?! OH WHY OH WHY IS THE PSYCHO WOMAN DOING ALL OF THIS?.. honestly i just thought she was crazy and wanted a baby or something (which is true).  but the final conclusion where you discover the ""truth"" of the matter just makes the movie even more of a farce (come on..think about it).  ok ok, the gorehound is gonna think they're indulging in some high class steak tar-tar when watching this flick.. they're actually going to get the idea that they have some class (sorry i couldn't resist).  but real horror genre patrons out there just might be able to see through the glossy production of all of this only to find a splatter flick that doesnt have anything all that interesting to offer when it comes to ideas and subject matter.  you might say ""well what about all the suspense?"".. what suspense? its a splatter/slasher flick; ALL MUST DIE!!  the suspense might be found in the vehicle for their obligatory deaths..even though you know its just going to be painful and messy.  I can stomach gore, but give me a good reason TO stomach it.  I don't mind the ""ick"" factor as long as there is some interesting subject matter and ideas happening in the movie.  this movie lacks these things.  all ""Inside"" really is is a uber-production value, slick, glossy, vehicle for allot of gore and splatter effects (which are done very well).  if you're a gorehound then this film will be a treat for you; great production and lots of viscera! What a TREAT!  i on the other hand just cant seem to connect what I know as the Horror Genre with this fast tracked trend towards torture and gore (and torture and gore without an ounce of humor in it).  splatter and Horror (Horror as the title given to the genre) aren't necessarily the same thing... and ive always felt that they were in fact seperate, at least ""splatter"" kept seperate as a basement sub-genre.  splatter flicks have always just been unimaginative works used to exploit the ""rubber-necker at a train wreck"" response within human behavior in order to turn a fast buck.. old auteres in this field like herschel gordon lewis and joe d'amato were usually forthright and unapologetic about this truth (which i appreciate).  but anymore this stuff is being pawned off as some kind of high art, which even the likes of loyd kaufman would laugh at.  Im not telling anyone what to enjoy and what not to enjoy..im just trying to say 'be aware of what your enjoying, and don't fool yourself into thinking its something its not'.  i myself enjoy bad b-movies, but i know that they're just bad b-movies and not some kind of high art.  true Art only comes around every once in a very great while; even more so in the Horror Genre.  so don't be fooled by just another French, Nihilistic, ""ohh, life izz sheeet"" splatter flick.. because essentially thats all thats inside ""Inside"".",1239840000,4,4125,4.646005509641873
3311555,4,B00125WATQ,"After losing her husband in a brutal car accident, an embittered young woman named Sarah (Alysson Paradis) on the verge of giving birth finds herself spending Christmas Eve fending off a madwoman intent on violently cutting her baby out of her womb and making off with it. Attempts to help Sarah seem futile, as the insane intruder slays anyone who interferes and would-be rescuers find themselves in the midst of a two woman ""war zone"".

Repulsively graphic and fascinatingly unrelenting, this French horror film from Alexandre Bustillo and Julien Maury is a disturbing and tragic thrillride. The film (also known as &Agrave; l'int&eacute;rieur) starts off a bit slow for my tastes, but once the menacing invader (played by B&eacute;atrice Dalle) comes onto the scene, it kicks into full gear until the finish with its dark and violent story of the madness of motherhood. My only complaint is that the final act is just so very dark at times that it is hard to make out what is happening, even though it seems you are supposed to be able to, and this is a pet peeve of mine actually. Otherwise, it's an excellent work of horror with a lot of well-planned gore and disturbing situations throughout. The DVD comes with an excellent and very thorough making-of featurette and a trailer for the film, and one can opt to watch it with English subtitles, Spanish subtitles, or even an English dubbing.",1239667200,2,1396,4.841004184100418
3311556,5,B00125WATQ,"Once again, an original foreign horror movie puts American horror cinema to shame.  Ever notice how filmmakers in other countries don't remake horror movies?  They make original movies (imagine that)!  Sure, some of those original movies are craptacular, but there are also some gems like this French film.
I had read about this movie (not too much since I didn't want to know too much before watching it), and was skeptical that it would live up to the reviews, but it did and then some.  There were some genuinely creepy scenes toward the beginning, and plenty of violence.  The filmmakers definitely didn't mess around when it came to the violence.
The movie was not perfect - when the police show up, some absurd moments happen - but it's hard to find a movie (much less a horror movie) where that doesn't happen.  It is obvious the filmmakers love the horror genre and, more importantly, knew what they were doing.
My main complaint is with Dimension Extreme/Weinstein Company.  While the company has produced some quality, original horror movies lately (Teeth and 13: The Game of Death, to name a few), why did it sell out to Blockbuster?  They made an exclusive deal with them, so you can't rent their movies from other chains - and a number of people have reported the copies Blockbuster rented were then edited(!).
I digress.  This was one of the best horror movies I have watched in a while, and I'll be interested to see what comes next from these directors.  It is very violent, and has some cringe-worthy scenes, so if you like PG-13 movies (why?), don't bother.  However, if you like horror movies and wonder what happened to originality, or are tired of CGI effects, check this one out - if you can find it.",1239062400,3,1722,4.687707641196013

Beatrice Dalle is probably owed much of the credit in the fear department...her presence alone succeeds in raising hair on the back of the neck.",1237680000,,538,5.195402298850575
3311558,4,B00125WATQ,"I really can't add much to the fine reviews already here.  But I have to say that this movie is truly mean-spirited.  The first two-thirds of the film might overwhelm viewers in its gore and relentless horror.  Only towards the end, does the director offer a little comic relief and give the audience a little break.  But only a little break.  Damn, the french love their horror hardcore.

I saw this a year ago at the Walter Reade theater at Lincoln Center and the audience was stunned - but in a good way.  This is one of the best horror movies of the decade, along with The Descent, Them (the French original), and The Orphanage (El Orfanato).  This one is the bloodiest by far, and requires the most suspension of disbelief.  But no matter.  This film succeeds in what it set out to do.  It is meant to be a terrifying, disturbing experience, and it certainly is.  It has all the requirements of a truly great horror movie.  It works both with and against viewer expectations, and I assure you, the final gothic shot will stay with you forever.  This will leave you shaken and terrified.

Fast forward 4 months later, Sarah is released from the hospital after being treated for numerous injuries.  She's in a somber mood, to say the least, after the death of her husband and decides to take up her friend's offer of staying in her cottage to clear her mind.  Alone in the cottage, one night Sarah hears a knock on the door.  It's a mysterious woman who demands to be let in.  She knows Sarah's name and her story.  Sarah refuses to open the door but it's in vain.  The woman wants in to Sarah's house.  And wants her unborn baby too...

This film is very successful at building suspense slowly.  Early on, I almost had the impression I was watching a classic Argento gialli, the suspense was so poignant.  But then halfway through, the film unexpectedly turns into an absolute gorefest.  This is easily one of the most disturbingly graphic and bloody films I've had the pleasure (or displeasure) of witnessing.  It makes ""High Tension"", another French gore flick of recent years, seem like a walk in the park in comparison.

Don't be fooled by Dimension Extreme's insistence on packaging all of their films to look like mindless b-movie gore fests, which annoys me to no end.  ""Inside"" is a very high quality film with good pacing, good effects and yes, great acting.  The pregnant woman is great at conveying simultaneously fear and also a pregnant woman's determination to save her child.  The female villain is also quite something.  I can't remember a female in a serious horror film who's this menacing, this utterly insane, and able to inflict this much damage single-handedly.

In the end, ""Inside"" is definitely required viewing for horror fans but only those who can stomach ridiculous amounts of gore.  The novice horror fan who is safely weaned on mainstream stuff is better off staying away.",1236124800,,1936,4.771084337349397

This isn't a horror movie where teenagers are partying and having sex and being off'd one by one.  It's a pregnant lady, alone on Christmas, being stalked and attacked.

Call it the 21st century's answer to ""Rosemary's Baby"". One of the elements of its effectiveness as an exemplar of great horror cinema is its methodical stillness that does not feel clinical, but natural and ruminative: like languidly strolling through a horrific car crash accident. The camera looks on with little editing, occasionally emphasizing the spaciousness of the empty big house that is paradoxically claustrophobic with Gothic moodiness and hopeless despair, and all in all, offers a thoughtful examination of its main ingredient: bloody carnage, mostly done with a really sharp pair of scissors. Maternal much? Having seen the outrageously terrifying and philosophical ""Martyrs"", ""Inside"", sadly, seems tame, however slightly, compare to the former's no-holds-barred look at utter human depravity and existential horror. Nonetheless, its ""tameness"" still beats the myriad of unimaginative American horror films that overpopulate the theaters nowadays, and thus, on its own, proves that French filmmakers are some of the best craftsmanships of gut-wrenching and emotionally evocative horror that is gloriously drenched in blood and gore.",1234310400,2,1282,5.824468085106383

3311567,2,B00125WATQ,"If one were to look at Inside on any level other than that of a splatter horror film in the vein of a poor man's Lucio Fulci, it would be a sad response to the current state of horror. Inside is a film that seems like it will only appeal to those who think gore-- no matter how realistic and well executed it may be-- means a film is effective. That would be a falsity. As Inside both lacks in nearly every department aside from conjuring some adamantly gruesome images, and is the antithesis of  both thought and suspense.

Good horror movies for me are not unlike that of suspense or thrillers. In fact they are often much, much better because of their sense of both baroque and dire atmosphere and a feeling of all-bets-are-off bleakness. Whether you are Alfred Hitchcock, Brian De Palma, or Dario Argento you must understand all three of these genres. As Hitchcock put it: ""There is no terror in the bang, only in the anticipation of it.""

Inside is all about the bang. Any sense of anticipation, (with the exception of one humorously ironic scene involving a toaster,) is shoddy and amateur: often being telegraphed long before it happens. Suspense and actual tensions should always be a necessity. Gore without this is simply for pussies. As Inside is a film dependent on startling images, much like the aforementioned films of Lucio Fulci. Yet, in the case of effects, although it may have improved on realistic bloodshed, it sadly lacks the best element of that auteur's Grindhouse output in which the dreamlike and otherworldly whimsy of films like The Beyond is rather traded for nothing of real artistic merit or value.

Though this writer does not have a problem at all with bloodshed, it must be said that after you see a gore scene once, no matter how well executed, you become desensitized; it's just not that effective anymore. It is the bang  without a menacing triggerman--  yet, if you have a scene, gore or not in tact, and have an ample amount of suspense built around character development, pacing, tension and attack and release, then you have a film that will withstand multiple viewings.

Other than bloodshed, Inside tries to make a bleak atmosphere through its use of shadows (doesn't work, by the way) and its angry lead character. Yet, the film does not earn it, rather the character of the pregnant Sarah (Alysson Paradis) feels as static as a walking dead extra in a Romero zombie film. Though the audience knows she is mad at the world and misses her husband, but it falls into telling not showing character development. Inside ""tells"" us to feel empathetic for this character and all the victims due to their ordeal, but it does not establish any sort of relationship with any of them of any worth. Although this may seem intentional, especially involving Sarah's possible more than friendship with her boss,  this sense of mystery certainly doesn't help, rather it just seems lazy.

Of course if one where to really want to they can pick apart many dumb character moves, as well. However, one must know that often you simply won't have a movie without them. Horror, especially this genre, utilizes a narrative that relies on mistakes, often as a commentary--- whether intentional or not, it depicts humans for what they are, flawed animals that often make mistakes when drastic times call for drastic measures. Dumb character moves can be forgiven if they resemble the character. It's again too bad that Inside doesn't have much character depth or layers, which does not exactly help matters when the bad logic comes into play.

The half-twist comes as braindead and unclear as the rest of the movie-- even negates itself in logic somewhat when Sarah mentions that she was told there were, ""No survivors."" A scene involving a believed to be dead character that can be compared to something out of a zombie-movie seems more hokey than anything in context to the rest of this otherwise played-straight film. The final shot of Inside, also, rather feels like it has false feelings of grandeur.

In the end, Inside may have a taboo feel like some of those golden-age horror movies, and possibly can be seen for its no-holds-barred approach with some of its not-easily-shaken images. It's too bad the budget's load was blown on gore shots than a good script.

It starts out with a car crash and then shows a very pregnant Sarah at the doctor's office. Since her husband was killed in the car accident, Sarah seems completely miserable and bitter. I found her unlikeable. She just doesn't seem to care about anything, including her mother and unborn child.

Sarah goes home to wait for the next day when her labor will be induced. It's a rather gloomy evening as it's Christmas Eve and she's chosen to be alone. Not long after she settles in, she has a dream and vomits up a milky substance on the floor. I wasn't sure what this scene was supposed to mean.

The film becomes very scary when the madwoman rings the doorbell and continues to pound on Sarah's door. Sarah calls the police but before they arrive, the woman gains entrance to the house and terrorizes her.

This film is very disturbing and contains the most realistic gore I've ever seen. I gave it 4 stars for that. Some of the characters seem really dumb and there's a scene when Sarah doesn't seem all that concerned about an accident she caused. I can't say more without revealing too much of the film.

The ending special fx are a bit disappointing but when the madwoman's motive is revealed, she becomes a bit of a sympathetic character.

There are several scenes that aren't realistic in the film but the scare tactics and gore make up for them. I recommend this movie for the horror film buff. It had me cringing throughout.",1230422400,,1620,4.511945392491468

The accumulation of eye popping, jaw dropping, and unbelievably sick scenes that occur in a mere 82 minutes are unprecedented, not to mention the loosening of fabric on your couch cushions by clenched fingers.

This French movie creates new standards for big screen visceral anguish, and it sets the bar painfully high. Nothing gets spared here, and you can toss all moral lines out of the window because Inside: Unrated crosses them unflinchingly.

First off, I really wanted to give the film 5 stars, but 5 stars is a masterpiece, and while this film is very very close, a couple of stupid plot points keep it just shy from getting there.

Fair warning, this film is extremely gory, so not for the squeemish at all.  I must say I enjoy watching a movie that actually lives up to its reputation.  The overall plot is excuted well, with little room for wasted moments.  Both actresses are phenomenal, and you as you watch you can't help identify with each of them at one time or another as they are both suffering from tremendous loss, which is an amazing feat considering the brutality being executed on screen.

My only complaints are those annoying little things that hold this back from being a masterpiece.  Most things I can explain away myself, i.e., the cops stupidity is probably due to the exhaustion they are experienceing from combating the ongoing riots.  That bathroom lock is just the best on the market, even if the door itself doesn't seem to be more than paper thin.  And sometimes, that soft spot on your skull just never seems to go away, especially if it is in the front.

3311577,1,B00125WATQ,"Inside (Alexandre Bustillo and Julien Maury, 2007)

It has seemed to me ever since the terrible Haute Tension scored an American theatrical release that the quality of any French horror film is in inverse proportion to the amount of hype it receives on this side of the pond. I've yet to find an exception to the rule from the past five years. As no French horror film in that time aside from Haute Tension has received as much hype as Inside, I pretty much knew what I was getting going in. It did not disappoint.

Plot: Sarah (The Last Day's Alysson Paradis--yes, she's Vanessa's sister) is awaiting the birth of her baby while grieving the loss of her boyfriend in a car accident. It's Christmas Eve, and she'll be headed for the hospital to deliver her child the next day. Rather than go out and celebrate, however, she decides to spend a quiet evening at home. Not a good idea, as it turns out she's being stalked by a mysterious woman (Beatrice Dalle, probably best known on this side of the pond for Night on Earth) who seems to have murderous designs on her, for reasons unknown. When the woman, who is unnamed throughout the film, tries to get into the house, Sarah calls the police, and the woman vanishes-- until they leave, when she breaks in and tries to kill Sarah, who flees to the bathroom and locks herself in. From there, it's your typical home-invasion thriller (think Panic Room and the like).

One of my problems with a lot of horror movies recently has been their episodic feel, which seems to stem from a lack of pacing in the script; the scriptwriter comes up with a pretty good idea, gets to the end of it ten or twenty minutes in, and has no idea what else to do, so they tack something else on. I can't remember a recent film that gave me this impression more than did Inside. All of the pieces that the film had set up in its first ten minutes were over and done with after forty, less than halfway through the film; the rest is simply a tiring exercise in how long they can drag out their tired formula before culminating the film with a climax so over-the-top gruesome that it raises hilarity rather than disgust. We're treated to set-piece after set-piece of Sarah and the unnamed assailant trying to get one over on each other, people showing up and said assailant having to talk her way out of a jam before dispatching the intruder, etc. And while in the space of eighty-three minutes this could only really have happened a finite number of times, it just seemed to be endless repetition while I was actually sitting through it. And then comes the Big Reveal, followed closely by the climax, and well, I guess it's okay if you're into that sort of thing (which I usually am, viz., say, Baby Blood) and if you're okay with the general badness of the rest of the film (which I am definitely not). If you're simply looking for a gore film, there are many, many better choices than this one. *",1227052800,5,2922,4.457943925233645
3311578,5,B00125WATQ,"Ever since ""Inside"" first hit the DVD shelves, I've heard people praising it's originality, it's suspense and most of all it's gore content. I wasn't sure if I would enjoy a ""French"" horror film after sitting through ""High Tension"" (which was fantastic, except for the ending which made no sense).
As someone who isn't too keen on reading subtitles, I hesitated in watching ""Inside"" for that reason as well. But based on some high recommendations from the good folks found on the horror forum here at Amazon I finally broke down and picked up this DVD.
WOW! It more than lived up to the hype. ""Inside"" is a truly great horror film. The suspense is top notch, the acting is fantastic, and the gore effects are disturbingly realistic. No need to worry about too much CGI in this flick.
The basic story is that one woman is pregnant, and another woman wants the baby....by any means necessary. That's it. No odd psychological twists, no cheap scares, motives are clearly defined for the characters actions, and best of all, it's an ""adult"" horror film. Not meaning it laced with tons of sex or nudity, but that the subject matter is written for adults, not the teen audience so commonly aimed for with the horror genre.
If you want a truly disturbing horror flick, one that will stick with you long after the closing credits, then be sure to pick up ""Inside"" right away.....make sure you see this version before the inevitable American Remake hits the theaters.",1227052800,3,1458,4.7215686274509805

3311581,5,B00125WATQ,"People have wondered lately what's happened to Europe and horror?  Well, wonder no more.  Here it is!  This French-made film may be one of the most horrifying and frightening films to come along in a great while.  Be warned, if you haven't seen Asian extreme films, you may be turned off by this film.  After watching this you'll feel like you were hit over the head by a brick.

The film starts out with a pregnant woman having been widowed after a horrible car accident.  Her unborn child in a sense becomes the memory of her husband, marriage, and dreams.  So though a fighter, there is a sadness around her and her life.  With the setup in place the story begins.  One random evening she's at home watching television and suddenly she gets an unexpected knock on the door.

What we get seems to be just another take of the alone-at-home-at-night film.  But what it turns out to be is so much more.  And when I say this I mean a whole lot more.  This may be one of the most frightening films ever.  Here we have a protagonist who we absolutely care for placed into a dire situation that no one could ever imagine.  The screenplay and directing absolutely has the audience completely fond of the main character and her predicament.

The antagonist is one of the most memorable in some time.  First, it is a woman.  Second, the motivation behind what she has planned is a mystery.  Third, her intensity to get what she wants is spectacular; there's one thing on her mind and nothing is going to stop her.  Topping this, the second antagonist of the film, Murphy's Law (bad luck itself), keep happening to our heroine and in such a realistic and valid way (you won't find any contrived cellphones not working out of the blue or cars not starting here).

Though this film is absolutely a gem filled with fear and terror, it is not perfect.  One character's pre-death scene is absolutely silly when this individual hasn't died right away.  The character's trajedy instead seems too much like B-movie nonsense.  This though can be overlooked since what we have is a tight little horror film great for Halloween!  For the two main leads, both beautiful woman (the antagonist is a former model and very famous in France), there are no gratuitous (or non-gratuitous) nude scenes in this film, something that is usually expected by the horror crowd but shouldn't worry anyone wanting to see this great film.

""Inside"" is a tension marathon that keeps you in a frenzied state untill the wholluping round house kick of an ending. The French take the high road to horror leaving neatly packaged cookie cutter slasher flicks in its wake. The plot is very simplistic, as maternal  instinct is examined to its grimest  possibility. A grieving widow, pregnant and near term, is terrorized by a psychotic woman whos' intent is to cut out her unborn child.

3311588,5,B00125WATQ,"I just watched this film recently and, as a well-seasoned horror fan, I think that this film must go on my list of the best horror films that I have ever seen.  It is a truely powerful film, but it may not be for you if you are squemish about realistic gore.  There's plently of it in this film.  The filmmakers have sucessfully combined prosthetics and CGI to produce some of the most realistic gore that I have ever seen.

I don't want to reveal too much.  To put it simply, this film is the struggle of a pregnant mother on the night (Christmas Eve) before she is about to give birth and a woman that will do anything, and I do mean anything, to take the child for herself and she is not going to wait for the baby to be born in any natural or regular fashion.  Anyone who trys to stop this woman faces the wrath of someone for whom there is no compromise or reasoning.  The reason why the woman wants this specific child so badly is revealed in a surprising and enlightening twist at the end of the film.  I'll say no more about the plot.

The blood flows thick in this film, literally, and it is unfortunate that this may turn some people away because the two lead actresses, Beatrice Dalle and Alysson Paradis, both turn in excellent, powerful performances.  I don't know too much about French films or actors, but apparently these two actresses are seasoned, well-known actresses and the fact that they both agreed to appear in such an extreme horror film speaks volumes for the quality of the screenplay and that quality is well realized in the film itself.

I've seen many gory horror films, and perhaps I am somewhat jaded about gore, but, to me, this film is one of the few I have seen with a large quantity of gore where I felt that the gore was not, to some extent or in some instances, more extreme than necessary.  The gore in the film is exactly what is necessary to convey the extremity, the instensity, and the absolute horror of the situation.  I congratulate the filmmakers on achieving this balance and on creating such a fine film.

I really regret that the gore in this film may turn some away because, in a time that produces far too many films not worth watching, this is one film definitely worth seeing.  Even if you are squemish about gore, consider watching this film anyway if you like powerful stories, excellent performances, and just-plain-good filmmaking.  You can always close your eyes during the bloody bits.",1222473600,,2445,4.485327313769751
3311589,4,B00125WATQ,"This 2007 French horror film, is surprisingly good.  It has all the gore, but well done and with a good story line.

Briefly, a pregnant photojournalist, Sarah, was involved in a horrible car accident that killed her husband.  Four months later she is ready to deliver the child on Christmas Eve.  Sarah wants to spend the final night by herself.  A knock comes on the door and our ""gap-toothed"" villan appears in the shadows and mutters something about losing her daughter and seems to know a lot about Sarah.  Sarah is frightened and calls the police.  The police find no one outside and promise to send another patrol later that night.  Our villan reappears and gains entry into Sarah's house.  That's where the gore begins...

I loved the use of sissors and knitting needles as a murder weapon for a female villan.  The gore was unbelieveable!

I also liked the camera make that Sarah used for her profession---a Canon EOS!  That's my brand and what I've been shooting with for a few years.  What bothered me about it was Sarah's was a film camera and this is a 2007 movie.  Digital cameras were out for a while and photojournalists were among the first to have them.  So to me it was unrealistic that she had an older camera.  When she needed to enhance the photo of the ""gap-toothed"" villan, it could have been done easily with an up-to-date camera.

The other thing that bothered me was the ""zombie-like"" scene towards the end---what was that about?

All in all this was a good gore fest and one to start off October with.",1222041600,5,1529,4.575645756457565

3311596,5,B00125WATQ,"Some time ago I read in a German horror movie magazine about INSIDE (or A l'INTERIEUR in French). The reviewer commented how extreme and tough to watch this film was even for him  as seasoned horror vet.
I have to agree with the reviewer in this magazine. INSIDE is  unbelieveably sick and gory for a mainstream horror film.

Newspaper photographer Sarah is far advanced in pregnancy, but depressed nonetheless, as her husband was killed in a car crash some months ago. She is about to spend a lonely Christmas Eve at home, when a black clad woman threatens her. Sarah calls the police, who can find no trace of the female intruder. The cops leave and Sarah goes to sleep. Her nightmare is only just beginning, as the black clad intruder returns, hell bent to cut Sarah's baby out of her womb...
I will not go into more detail here, but only assure you that it is highly unlikely that you will get to watch an equally gory and disturbing film anytime soon. The movie is sooo sick it beggars belief. And I am an avid fan of horror and gore, of extreme movies of all kind.
The pregnancy of Sarah adds enormous to the unpleasantness. We even get to see the agony of the fetus in the womb! I have not seen something like that before!
And rarely have I seen such insane bloodshed in a film...

INSIDE is no cheapo direct-to-video trash, where rivers of blood should make up for basement production values and gross splatter special effects are laughable due to lack of funds.
No way. INSIDE is a decently budgeted film with top league actors. Beatrice DALLE who plays the vicous killer is an accomplished actress with starring credits in lots of arthouse movies. She may not be a household name in the United States, but DALLE is well known in Europe.
As for the final plot twist and the female killer's identity and motivation (I won't give it away, so don't worry!) I have to say that it did not really surprise me and I am sure that most viewers will expect something of its kind.
Cinematography and score are exceptional and add enormous to the grim athmosphere. The fact that almost the entire movie (except for the lethal car accident and a few scenes in the hospital at the beginning) takes place in Sarah's house (in just a couple of rooms to be precise) give a tense feeling of hopelessness. The close quarters are very cleverly utilized for maximum shock effect.
INSIDE also has some political subtext (if you will), as there are references to the recent mass riots; the cops who return to Sarah's house to check on her, come with an arrested rioter in tow.
Not just in this regard INSIDE reminds one of FRONTIER(S), the
other extreme French horror film (which also has a pregnant heroine!).

As for special features there is the trailer, which sells the film well, and a making-of. The latter runs about 50 minutes or so. I found it very interesting. Beatrice DALLE, Alysson PARADIS and other actors comment on their respective roles and the shot. Both DALLE and PARADIS come across as very likeable women, who had much fun during filming. Much attention is given to the special effects and how they were accomplished. Almost all of the F/X were physical (makeup, props, etc), thankfully there is very very little of the damned computer effects (just a CGI enhanced shot in the head).
This great terror movie comes with the highest recommendation. One last comment: If you like INSIDE, you have to check out the other recent French terror flick, FRONTIER(S) ! It is more conventional and slightly less gory than INSIDE, and while FRONTIER(S) is not exactly a feel good movie either it is not the relentless nihilistic descent into hell like INSIDE.

Is quite good through the first 40 minutes or so (though too gory for my tastes). But the moment the cops arrive to check on the heroine, it begins to dreadfully go south. In the last 20 minutes it becomes so absurd and silly that I caught myself wondering whether I was watching a horror movie, or a horror spoof. I'm not a doctor, but I know quite a few, and I'm pretty sure that no one would survive 5 minutes (let alone walk around) after being stabbed with huge scissors in the bellybutton, poked in the throat with a stick, smacked in the head with a toaster, and generally speaking whomped and thrown about the way our heroine does during the course of this movie... While pregnant! No way in heck would an unborn baby survive everything its mother is put through in this film. A woman whose water has broken would be doubled over in debilitating pain every 5 to 3 minutes as her contractions worsen (that I know from personal experience). And didn't they have medical consultants on the set to teach them that C-sections are performed by cutting horizontally just above the mons pubis, not vertically up from the bellybutton? To top it all off, the way the cops behave is totally asinine. What would any cop do upon entering a place that looks like a slaughterhouse? He'd immediately call for back-up. Upon finding the suspect, he'd restrain her and search her. He'd NOT handcuff himself to the perp who's already in his car being brought in for questioning, and drag him along into the slaughterhouse. He'd NOT turn his back to allow the psycho to blow his brains out. He'd NOT leave a pregnant, bloodied victim on her own when the lights suddenly go out while he goes off to look for breaker box.

And Inside is just another one of those, like High Tension, where if the amount of gore a film possessed determined it's brilliance than Citizen Kane and The Godfather would have some harsh competition for greatest film of all time.

But copious amounts of gore do not make a film good, ever; this is the same boring garbage as the Saw films, some of you kiddies will be quick to disagree, but it's true, deal with it.  There's sort of a story, but who cares, because there's tons of blood and stuff.

Inside contains not even the remotest semblance of merit in any regards; there is no suspense, no desire to care about Sarah (whom I'm assuming we're supposed to care about, unless the directors were just doing a poor job of being typically French film makers; here's some people, good or bad, doesn't matter, just watch.)  The use of sharp noises is so redundant and expected that one can't help but let out a laugh at how stupid it is.

Stupid is a keyword when discussing this mess of a film; the story is so unoriginal that it would have taken quite a bit to make it at least seem fresh and interesting, but these boys couldn't even bother with that; hey, here's the same old Argento inspired, but not nearly close to the level of genius in his heyday, garbage.

It's not a horror thriller, because there are no thrills, and definitely no horror; it's a slasher, plain and simple; the lowest level of cinema in it's purest.

The acting is really terrible, and the editing in parts was like rejected footage from a Korn video.

The performances by the two main women was simply amazing. One of them is having a baby and the other one wants it. There begins a battle of wits and body. My only questions are minor: why did the victim call the police and they came by to check on an intruder and then left. Why didn't she just move into a hotel for the night. Instead, she goes back to sleep, knowing there's a human monster hiding out somewhere near. Towards the end, when the cops are blown away and the backup comes in, he spends precioius minutes--surrounded by dead bodies--as he tries to get the power back on. Why didn't he race out to his car and call for backup? These questions are minor however since the French cast and crew keep us riveted to the electrifying actions of our two female performers.

Not so with this French flick - it delivers, and then some. It's well made, very well acted and the violence is just the right tempo for the mood of the piece.

3311602,4,B00125WATQ,"Inside A In'terieur, is a ghastly modern French horror film of the slasher suspense genre. In the more standard films of this kind, there is generally a slow build up as to what the villain might be capable of doing. First, there is the warning signs of their ""off"" behavior. Fallowed by the destruction of inanimate objects, and possibly the murder of Fluffy, the house pet. It is only after a good hour of screen time, when this arch of drama plays out, that we as film patrons get the reward we have been waiting for in this type of story telling. That is when the villain carries out their mission with singleness of purpose, and inflicts harm to actual living breathing human beings before they themselves meet with the iron clad hand of justice. In many ways, Inside still adheres to some of the basic formula to this type of suspense driven story telling. Only in this case, Inside is more like Single White Female on acid. Inside is the very definition of sadistic cinema, so anyone who can't stand the heat better get out of the fire ASAP.

Double your trouble with double mint dreams.

Sarah, played by Alysson Paradis A.K.A., the aunt of Johnny Depp's kids, is a woman who lost her husband in a very bloody car wreck, which she herself survived. Now fully pregnant and waiting out her final days before she goes into labor with her dearly departed husbands baby, she has two very unpleasant dreams back to back. The first starts off like it was lifted from the film Ghost with Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore. While rubbing her distended swollen belly in depressed boredom, her dead husband comes up behind her and joins in on all the caressing, which lovingly leads to a bit of necking. This is fallowed by the sudden jolting image of her husbands head smashing into the windshield, causing Sarah to snap out of her delusion. A moment later Sarah nods off on the couch, only to awake in a coughing frenzy. Suddenly she falls onto all fours and begins vomiting up huge sprays of milk. Then in her agony and turmoil, she manages to fall onto her back and barf up her unborn baby right out of her mouth. She snaps awake this time to the sound of someone knocking on her door. It is at this point in the film that anyone with any common sense in them will have a good understanding of the level of gore and carnage they are bound to witness if they continue to watch this film. In that way, these dreams are pretty much saying "" You've been warned!""

""Will the real Beatrice Dalle please stand up!""

The knock on the door comes at roughly the 20 minute point in the film, and it is none other then the sadistic villain of the film known simply as La Femme. La Femme is played by Beatrice Dalle, an actress who once beat up a meter maid in Paris for daring to ticket her parked car. Beatrice Dalle plays a woman who is, in many ways, beyond mortality. In that she is beyond reason and normal human emotions. Added to this, her whole presence is nothing short of monk like. Cloaked in what seems to be a black bell sleeved ninja robe, she stands and moves with a decisive rigid posture, that is far too severe and driven to be in any way normal. Once in Sarah's house, she fishes for the proper implement to carry out her acts of carnage with the surgical precision of her black gloved hands. While up close, she does nothing to alleviate ones distress of her otherworldy presence, in that her very face is enough to give one a lifetime suply of the ""hebe jebe's"". La Femme has a twisted cruel mouth with big fleshy red lips, containing oversized serrated teeth, that are marked by a huge gap between the front two. She also has an abnormally tall forhead, that peaks out of her parted sleek black hair like a marble shard. She has a near cro-magnon brow which itself drops steeply into deep eye sockets containing steely hard dark eyes. Had this sinister creation been the work of make up artist, it would of been an act of pure brilliance for that department, but as it turns out, This is nothing more then Beatrice Dalle's actual real face. Hell, she is so hideously scary to look at, that I think I might of fallen in love with her. But seriously, if it wasn't for her performance and ultimately her presence in the film, it would not have stood out like it did. No amount of bleak atmosphere or gore, could ever supply the amount of hard edginess that Beatrice Dalle brought to this film. Making the film makers lesson here an obvios one. If you want to make a film that is driven by the brutal acts of carnage of a sadistic mastermind psychotic, then before you do anything else, get yourself a sadistic mastermind psychotic that will make the audience members gnaw their fingers right off.

Sharon Tate is a whimp compaired to Alysson Paradis's Sarah!

To speak plainly, never in the history of cinema has a pregnant character had to suffer so much abuse without surcoming to the laws of death. Fallowing is a list of most of the injuries inflicted on poor Sarah during her brief encounter with Beatrice Dalle...I left out one particular infliction while shuffling the order of the others, in order to avoid spoiling the film.
1) Cuts up her hands using a knife shaped shard of mirror as a weapon and digging tool.
2) Is pulled so savagely by her hair that a sizable handful is yanked out.
3) Gets bashed in the face and head with a toaster that was swung by its cord.
4) Has her water brake on her inducing labor in her attempt to escape from Beatrice Dalle.
5) Gets slashed across both lips by the cutting edge of a pair of scissors leaving a five inch long tear across her face.
6) Cold cocked in the face so hard and unexpectedly that she is slammed into the floor.
7) Has a good one inch of meat above her belly button cut open with the same pair of scissors that were used to slice her face.
8) Is drug across a room by her hair, hit in the face twice and tossed roughly to the floor of the kitchen.
9) Has her face bruitally stomped on twice while already laying on the ground.
10) Has the afor mentioned pair of scissors impaled through her left hand, sticking it to the wall like a beetle in someones bug collection.
11) Is beaten so hard in her pregnant belly by a police baton wielding lobotomized and deranged cop that her birth fluids spill out all over the floor, causing her to slip in the puddle and go flying neck first against the kitchen cabinets.
...And now for my personal favorite...
12) Ruptures her own throat with a knitting needle in an attempt to kill herself, but decides that she wants to live so she duct tapes the bleeding geyser that was her neck on the fly.

I could go into all the emotional torment that Sarah suffers in her one hour of screen time with Beatrice Dalle, especially since Sarah's every rescuer gets grotesquely destroyed by this sadist. From accidentally stabbing her own mother in the throat, to having a cops head get blown off in her face in a shower of splatter, Sarah suffers as much mental distress as she does physical injury. The point here is, that all this brutality goes too far. What gets compromised by all the blood shed is the believability that this could actually really happen. I am not stupid, I do understand that this film is catering itself sylistically, into an endless progression of outdoing its last shock, but such devices come with inherent flaws attached. Had this film not made me utter sentences in disbeliefe like ""Good God woman! Ain't 'cha even dead yet?!""
I wouldn't be here stressing the importance of of doing all you can to not make someone have to suspend their beliefe. Because I am now Beatrice Dalle's newest number one fan after this fair, I would of given this film five stars in a heart beat had it just remained believable all the way through. This to me is the overall flaw of this movie, sadly it came darn close, but just wasn't quite a cigar.
 Nonetheless, it is still a solid bit of sadistic horror entertainment that I can recomment in good conscious to anyone with a soft spot for the sick and unusual. Four stars.",1215993600,,8028,4.441655359565807
3311603,4,B00125WATQ,"It's hard to avoid a horror movie with hype these days. In an age where a successful horror film is either a remake, rated PG-13 or dubbed ""torture-porn,"" we're all a little starved. We all pray for the next classic film to take horror in a new direction and out of the slump it's been in for the better part of the decade. ""Inside"" (or "" l'intrieur"") is an award winning French film, directed by newcomers Alexandre Bustillo and Julien Maury, released here in the states by Dimension home video and if the hype is to be believed, it's the best horror film of the new millennium.

Is that true? Well, no. The film is great, but it's not nearly as scary as the reviews imply, but then again, what movie is? To use a better term, this is possibly one of the most unsettling movies in it's genre, especially given the plot. A pregnant woman, days away from birth who lost her husband in an unfortunate automobile accident four months prior, finds herself alone on Christmas eve and being stalked by a mysterious dark haired woman. What this woman wants at first is unclear, but she stops at no length to ensure that our main character is isolated by dispatching any would-be saviors in some rather grisly ways. Horror movies and pregnancies are always a match made in Hell. Whether it's ""Rosemary's Baby"" or ""Alien,"" it's always a horrible concept that is likely to crawl up anyone's skin. ""Inside"" has an edge where most movie's don't, as our lead is completely alone, trapped and helpless at her most vulnerable at the mercy of a seemingly unrelenting attacker. From the get-go, you feel for her situation and things only get worse as the movie progresses. To say the gore in this movie is over-the-top would be an overstatement, but this is surely one of the most violent and gruesome movies that has come along in recent memory. As new directors, Bustillo and Maury inject a heavy amount of style and intensity into the film. Under diffferent direction, this movie might not have worked as well as it did. Surely, this is a pair to look out for in the future.

The ending leaves a bit open to the imagination, but one thing is for sure: you'll walk away feeling something. As someone who watches a lot of horror, I can certainly say this one caught me by surprise. It's refreshing to know that in this day and age there can be a horror film that manages to have a lasting effect on you. Horror fans will also appreciate references to two classics: ""Halloween"" and ""Psycho,"" obviously massive influences on the making of this film. ""Inside"" is not exactly for the weak of stomach, and surely, like an amusement park ride, if you are pregnant, I would avoid this ride. It might not be all that you expect it to be, but as far as new horror goes, this one is destined to be a classic.",1215648000,,2782,4.5069306930693065

It is perfect from start to finish and never drags.  As another reviewer points out, it makes the Saw franchise look like Disney films.  This is an absolute gore fest and very brutal throughout!

I've seen tons of horror movies and it takes a lot to make my jaw hit the floor but this succeeded a good 3 or 4 times.

If you are put off by subtitles, this is the one horror movie you need to suck it up for!  Besides, there isn't a ton of dialogue, after all it is a slasher movie.",1214438400,,678,4.090909090909091
3311608,4,B00125WATQ,"This is the one exception to the rule, ""Don't judge a book (or in this case: DVD) by its cover."", because if you find the look of this DVD cover gross, disturbing, or haunting...then you've nailed it right on the head.  Inside doesn't hide what it is and from the viewer stand point we can see the labor of love that this movie pours out on screen.

Inside isn't but a simple home invasion movie but what follows is some of the better horror effects and thrills in the genre in some time.  Unlike the recent Strangers, Inside doesn't go for the mental scares but more in-your-face fright.

The movie follows Sarah, a woman whose outlook on life isn't what it once was since she lost her husband due to a car accident.  She is now home alone on Christmas Eve and expecting a baby any time.  Careless of everything now, she is visited by a woman who wants a baby of her own, so much so she is willing to cut it out Sarah's belly herself....and tries she does.

As the movie progress you can't help but feel entranced with its violent and bloody images.  The film doesn't fence nor does it hide its ruthless natured.  You have to hand it to the effects team behind this hidden gem of a movie, to use natural effects rather then CGI nowadays and to make it come off as practical and damn near real, is a feat many people can't pull off.

The movie itself isn't without its flaws.  There's one particular scene at the end of the movie that changes the out come plot.  Since the people involved in that scene were throwaway actors, I felt really disappointed and kind of ripped off at the same time.  Everything before that was almost perfect for what type of movie it is but this just seemed lazy on the writers' part.  Having to put in something that makes people scratch their head only to get the ending they wanted isn't the way to go.  In the end I still enjoyed this flick.

As I said before, depending on your opinion of the cover would I suggest setting down and watching Inside.  Gore hounds will eat this up and people on the fence about it should just jump down and take a look.",1214352000,,2084,4.302564102564102
3311609,5,B00125WATQ,"Forget that, Inside is one of the best horror film of the decade! And certainly one of the best horror films of all time! I picked it up after seeing an ad online, and I was not disappointed at all. From the moment the film starts, your almost on the edge of your seat anticipating the action. And once 'la Femme' shows up... well, things only get more interesting from that point on.

It's a little hard to review horror movies, especially for those who have never seen them, without giving too much plot away, but here we go... The film focuses on Sarah Scaragato, a nine month pregnant journalist who is about to give birth, and her terrifying female stalker who, for some reason wants to cut her open and take her child. With very nasty looking shears. The intensity and horror don't let up for a second either. As various people come to help or check up on Ms. Scaragato, they wind up being killed and/or mutilated by 'la Femme' in various gruesome ways. Yes, a fair word of warning to the squeamish here, there is alot of blood, gore and graphic violence included on this movie, but really they couldn't have done it any other way. It's all quite appropriate to the plot... but no less horrific because of it. And the ending was perfect. I didn't like it, but there was no other way they COULD have ended it. Absolutely brilliant.

On the technical side of things, it was a great movie in general. Alysson Paradis did an excellent job as Sarah, and you really feel for her character. She was cute too... I would definitely like to see her in more stuff. Even the scenes that take place in poorly lit areas were quite well done. The blood, the violence... all of it was scary because it was so believable. I loved it! And it managed to maintain a very strong French character throughout, which is appropriate I suppose, seeing as how it was a French production (and yes, the French culture is very distinctive, even if you can't quite put your finger down on what defines it exactly). If you haven't seen this film yet, I can't emphasize enough that you go out and see it. It is the next step in European horror movies, but much more well done than some of it's predecessors. We have yet to get anything this... intense on this side of the Atlantic, but all I can say is, if this represents French horror films, then by all means keep it up! Great film!",1214006400,,2358,4.405963302752293
3311610,3,B00125WATQ,"OK - in 2003 France came out with a gem of a horror movie called Haute Tension (High Tension in the U.S.). High Tension is one of the best horror films of the decade if you ask me, and a lot of horror critics would agree. It came out swingin' with tasteful cinematography, believable anguish in the wonderfully casted characters, a haunting soundtrack, and the most glorious brutality to grace the silver screen in years.

INSIDE - recommended to me by several people, simply steals the same editor, steals the same music composer (the soundtracks sound almost identical), and then tries to double the gore. Unfortunately, this plan is a little too obvious to me. The majority of the gore feels unnecessary and forced. I began to feel like I was just watching some goons have fun with special effects for no reason at all. I wouldn't be surprised if the director even had his actors watch High Tension and try to copy their expressions of pain and agony to a T. I couldn't help but be turned off by all of this, leaving me feeling like all I have left with the film is an uncreative chain of gory killings, which is no longer anything special in modern horror.

The plot with the car accident and the unborn child starts out seeming like it could go somewhere very visceral and powerful, but instead it stops dead as soon as the villain is introduced and feels trite and pointless. Because of this, the movie loses its emotional aspect and loses a lot of its appeal.

So in the end - What Inside lacks is emotion, depth, and purpose - which unfortunately are probably the most important things in movies! What is strong about the movie and gives it it's 6 out of 10 is in the music, the editing, the violence, and the style - which are all stolen directly from High Tension. See that film instead.

3311611,3,B00125WATQ,"This movie does have a few effective suspenseful moments, and the performances by Beatrice Dalle and Alysson Paradis are truly special. It's just too bad that the whole production is marred by some awful make-up effects (little details that make the blood-n-guts look real were just abandoned here - all too often, Sarah looked like she just needed a towel, rather than a trip to the emergency room.  It really killed the suspense for me in a lot of scenes).  Some silly plot mechanisms also didn't help, and don't get me started on that ridiculous CGI fetus.  However, I still recommend this flick for the performances by the two leads.  While everyone talks about Beatrice Dalle's menacing La Femme (and boy is she menacing), Alysson Paradis' shattered Sarah is what really grounded the movie for me.

If you love your blood and gore and disembowlments to the maximum, then you simply must watch Inside. Yes it is in french, however, since there actually isn't much dialogue in this very short movie, you hardly even notice the subtitles after a while. All I have to say is that I'm glad I wasn't pregnant and watching this. It is the most nightmarish of films and gets under your skin. I haven't seen a film like this in years, maybe never.

3311614,5,B00125WATQ,"I do have to say this movie was quite good.  I had to read the one star people just to see why they even rated this movie one star.  First off this is a gore movie not a horror movie.  If you don't like gore, then don't watch this movie.  Also if you don't like gore then don't rate this movie.  As for all of you that complained about the dubbing, um buy the dvd and it is in French with subtitles.  I mean if you one star people are true horror fans, then you should know this is a French movie.  Watch it in French, unless you can't read then that would explain the reason you complained about the movie.

To give you an idea about how much gore then is in the movie, the ""rating"" people could not allow us americans to watch this movie in the theaters.  Quite frankly after seeing this movie I can see why they would chop this movie up.

All in all it is a great movie about a pregnant women being stalked by a crazy woman.  Once in her house the crazy woman starts trying to get a hold of her.  I can't speak anymore about the movie, I might spoil it for the reast of you.  I can say this, there are a couple of scenes in the movie that might make you turn your head, or make you close your eyes because the directors wanted to do a ""shock shot"", kind of how Hostel did with the eye scence.

3311615,4,B00125WATQ,"Not much I can say about this movie that hasn't alreay been said, but I think a lot of people may have missed out on the element that truly makes this a ""horror"" movie.  Yes, it's got a lot of violence and gore, but there is an element of the supernatural revealed that is never fully explained, and no, it doesn't have anything to do with cops or zombies.

**SPOILER** As for the ""zombie"" cop that another reviewer rhetorically asked about(here's a **SPOILER**, folks):  that cop wasn't killed in the first place.  The Woman did indeed shoot him in the head with his own gun as he was shackled to a handcuffed ""perp"", but the gun she used was some kind of taser gun or other non-lethal weapon.  This was the weapon the ""perp"" referred to as a ""flashbulb"" in the subtitled version of the film.  I also doubt the cop would have given the ""perp"" a lethal weapon to handle in that situation (in fact, I was surprised he gave the kid the taser gun and he gave Sarah a loaded pistol).  So The Woman shot the cop in the head with some kind of taser gun or other non-lethal weapon.  My guess is that when we see him after he turns the lights on, he was disoriented and/or blinded by the shot(s) to his head.  Once the lights were restored I don't know if he could see Sarah, at least not clearly.  When he attacked the heroine, it doesn't seem to make sense at first, but for all we know, he thinks Sarah committed all the murders in the house (in fact, she had earlier told him that she had killed her mother).  Plus, you'll notice he was dragging the lifeless, handcuffed ""perp"" who was still shackled to his own waist.  So I think his part in the movie makes sense.  End of **SPOILER**

Yes, the plot has holes and the film does try to walk a fine line between serious brutal violence and Evil Dead 2-style over-the-top violence that can get confusing at times.  But the performances are top-notch, the pace unrelenting, and it's never predictable or dull.  Trust me, you'll never catch this movie in an American theater.

Inside is a DISGUSTING tour-de-force. It's insanely gory. I think the only other time I have seen this much blood and gore was in Braindead-and I always felt that the gore in that film was done in an almost humorous way.
This is SERIOUS gore.

There's nothing laughable about it. It's unrelenting and flinch worthy.

3311622,4,B00125WATQ,"Somebody must be putting something in the Perrier ... there have been a few high-quality French fright flicks arriving on US shores, and INSIDE is the best of those.

Alexandre Bustillo and Julien Maury's film (A L'INTERIEUR in France) is, at it's core, the traditional horror tale: a woman is trapped in her home fighting against all odds to stay alive against a mysterious psychopath.

Been there, right?

Well, not quite.

Bustillo and Maury spice this oft-told story with additional ingrediants: gallons and gallons of blood and gore; a few teaspoons of understated humor; and one special element: a baby only hours from being born.

You see, INSIDE's psycho, The Woman (Beatrice Dalle), is determined to take this baby from our heroine, Sarah (Alysson Paradis), and make it her own. And she is not patiently waiting for the child to be born, thank you. To ensure that she leaves Sarah's home with the child, she's going to perform her own brand of delivery, a sort of murder by midwivery.

INSIDE is completely over the top in several ways: the body count climbs dramatically in what is essentially a duet, and the ways in which each of these victims meet his or her own end are shocking, bloody, and often upsetting. It is no exaggeration to say the movie is awash in blood and gore, buckets of blood and gore. And the violence escalates through to the final scene. Also a word to the wise: use caution with your television volume when watching this flick -- the screaming in several scenes is quite loud ... and quite prolonged. A few of my neighbors were justifiably concerned while I was watching it.

It's not a perfect film ... I thought the few CGI effects of the baby inside the womb were unnecessary, as if Bustillo and Maury had doubts they could bring to life the unborn child as a full-blooded character. And the police officers make decisions which strain credibility ... but some of these actions lead to outrageous, bloody situations that in the long run amplify the suspense and scares.

I would like to point out that I watched the unrated subtitled version of INSIDE. I've seen complaints about edited scenes and poor dubbing in some of the other reviews here. I'm not aware of a dubbed version, and I would guess that an edited or rated version made available by one of the rental chains would be a perfect example of ""missing the point entirely."" My recommendation is to find the subtitled, unrated original.

And lastly, if you are pregnant or considering having a child very soon, don't watch INSIDE. That would make for a whole lot of sleepless nights and future therapy.",1211500800,,2599,4.7196467991169975

So, sunkin', I stuck in Inside's Unrated version I received in the mail, and man!  What a different story.  For me, the Unrated version quite possibly takes the seat as my favorite horror film of all time.  It is also alot more clever in it's use of gore effects than Frontier(s) was.  I know that sounds a little optimistic, but for me, I am fascinated with this new thread of French extreme/shock films.  I have never in my life sat through movies that have created such a sense of tension and terror as these have.  Haute Tension, The Hills Have Eyes Remake, Frontier(s), and Inside are inspiring in my opinion and every bit as good, or better, than even the most acclaimed classic horror films.
Martyrs is supposed to be the next film released in this style directed by Pascal Laugier.  I am captivated by this stylistic and progressive genre of horror encorporating the most striking aspects of all genres of film (Drama, Action, and Exploitation), and combining them into a well produced gem.  Inside does hold the ranks as captain of horror so far in my opinion, but I'm sure there a loads of brilliant ideas begging to be, well, exploited!",1211500800,,1829,4.671875

She is all alone in her house with just herself and the unborn child within her, a strange maniacal woman breaks in wanting to kill her and wants the unborn child as guests come in but they get killed off, can Sarah fight off this insane woman?

Horrifying and scary French horror thriller is one of the better and most interesting horror flicks of the new century. It's gory as hell and a little hard to watch at times, i think the acting is well done and the make-up effects are realistic especially the scissors to a person's skull sequence. Director Alexandre Bustillo is now one of the most promising horror directors in recent memory thanks to this unique and ghastly movie, it pushes the limits of violence and insanity to the max in this must see experience for fans of horror and European cinema alike.

3311625,5,B00125WATQ,"I know, I know,
It's a really outrageous statement, but it's unbelievabley true,
this is possibly the greatest horror movie ever made!!
(Second only to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre)
A scissor-wielding psychopath(?)
(dressed as the wicked queen from Snow White)
invades a pregnant widows home during the french riots, with the intention of stealing her unborn child.
And she will kill ANYONE who gets in her way. ANY-freakin-ONE!!!
But she's not a villian you hate,
she is silent, queen of her element, but purposeful, pure poker from head to toes.
By the end, you might actually like her, and feel for her.
There's some corny CGI, but it doesn't deter from the horrific experience.
More scares & atmosphere than the original ""Halloween"", (not an exaggeration in the slightest)
as well as an arguably supernatural presence
(which I don't personally buy, but I've heard it argued before.)
and much more gore than ""High Tension"" but with a severely better ending.
This flick is absolute perfection in every horrific way.
It comes subtitled,
but there is an option for English dubbing as well, for those who can't tolerate subtitles.

3311626,1,B00125WATQ,"This movie was drek.  I can't even begin to describe how awful it was.  But, let's try...

First, the english dubbing was rotten.  The actors-- if one can call them that-- sounded so dry and monotone.

The job of the director and actor is to make the audience feel compassion/sympathy/remorse for the hero/heroine.  To make us care that the protagonist wins in the end.  Thi movie did the opposite.

At the beginning of the movie the protagonist is having a pre-natal examination by her doctor.  She actually cops an attitude with him.  Here is the man who will be ensuring the safety of her newborn and she gives him attitude.  Her acting only gets worse after that.  This supposed heroine annoyed me.  I had NO feelings of wanting to see her win out in the end.  As a matter of fact, I couldn't wait for her to hopefully get killed!

Now, let's talk about the Keystone Cops that show up to help her.  All I have to say is that if these 3 cops are a shining example of the French Police Force then I am SO glad I live in the USA!

WHO THE HECK TAKES AN ARRESTED SUSPECT INTO A VICTIM'S HOME?!?

3 cops are taken out by a woman who had to have weighed 90 pounds at the most.  What cop in his right mind-- knowing he has a killer in custody-- allows that same killer to reach up her sleeve for a knitting needle!?!  And, even after being stabbed in the eye, his training should have kicked in and allowed him to at least put up some kind of struggle.  Anyone ever hear of adrenaline?!  The fight to survive?!

These 3 cops make the cop from the Police Academy movies seem like military strategists.

And, the victim was even more moronic.  She has a chance to escape and she goes to bed WITH THE KILLER STILL IN THE HOUSE!!!!  WTF?!?

This movie only accomplished one thing: it re-affirmed the stereotype that French people are cowards and weak and can't take care of themselves.  The director and producer and actors should be ashamed of themselves that the set back the French image so bad.

If I owned a video store/store/Amazon/etc I would be ashamed and embarassed to allow anyone to see this movie.  This movie should be destroyed.  And, I'm nearly tempted to destroy the DVD right now and just pay Netflix/Amazon/rental store/etc the money that they would be out.  If I can rid the world of at least one copy of this DVD it would be worth it.

My girlfriend and I just wasted-- WASTED-- 1 hour and 19 minutes of our lives watching this drivel.  That is 1 hour and 19 minutes of our lives that we can NEVER get back!  And, the ONLY reason we kept watching was because it was like driving by a car crash.  You knew what you would see would be horrendous, but you had to look anyway.

This movie even set back good horror movies.  It was nothing but a gore fest-- and not even that good-- involving people that were idiots.  And, by that, I mean that if these people in this movie acted this way in real life they would be labeled as mentally-challenged.

Save yourself the time and do NOT rent this movie. It would have been more pleasurable for my to pluck out my own eyeballs so I wouldn't have to watch this to begin with.  Then pouring acid into my ears so I wouldn't have to listen to the even worse dialogue.

I glance through the other reviews for this movie on this Site and I feel disgust that so many people have praised this movie.  My hope for the future dwindles damatically for us as a society.",1211241600,14,3412,4.315457413249211
3311627,1,B00125WATQ,"Inside is a tribute to the ""Idiot Plot"" - that is a plot that wouldn't work unless everyone in the film is a halfwit. This bloody, pointless film is about a pregnant woman hunted by a crazy person in her home. She locks herself in the bathroom while the crazy person stabs at the bathroom door with a knife and screams.

But then things get really stupid. The killer is a woman who weighs maybe 120 pounds - she kills four full-grown men! 2 of them are armed cops! One of the cops is in the house when the lights go out, so he goes into the basement to turn the lights back on! Yikes - now THAT'S stupid..

Of course, none of the cops called for help when they were OUTSIDE and they noticed that something was wrong - double Yikes..

A movie from 2008 that's doesn't suck? I know it's hard to believe but it's actually true. In fact it's one of the only flick's made this decade (besides Grindhouse, Girl Next Door and some Japanese stuff) that I really liked. This movie should have definitely had a theatrical release considering some of the other movies that are deceptively passing themselves off as horror films these days. It's got a well written little story (not without flaws, more later), the acting is very good, and it's got so much blood you'll be seeing red for three days. My only minor gripes would be that in the last third of the flick some of the stuff gets a little hard to believe. I could have done without the little bits of CGI (I don't think it really added anything to the movie), and I would have liked a little more depth in the story department.

Haute Tension has absolutely nothing on Inside. Not only is it as gruesome as the other reviews would have you believe, it is absolutely horrifying in concept (pretty much ripped from today's headlines) and technical execution, and wildly unpredictable. The director knows how to create tension with sound and image as well as action - and once the this tension gets built up, we don't get any merciful release via someone jumping out of the shadows. Also probably the most disturbing horror movie I've ever seen - next to this, Argento looks like Disney, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre resembles something off the Travel Channel, flesh-eating zombies seem like the Care Bears. Highly recommended - although I don't really see any but the most diehard horror fans making it all the way through this. It's that brutal.

3311631,5,B00125WATQ,"it took a while to finally check this one out, despite all the hype, but im glad i finally did. in the relm of horror, this has it all. theres tons of suspence at times, while the killer stalks and sneeks. she has a very ghost-like presence, fading into the shadows. plenty of awsome kills, with a cringe worthy moment or two. they did a really good job on the blood and gore. i was wandering what all could really be done with a pair of scissors but.. ill just say she's creative. plus a couple other items are used throughout the movie.

the acting was good all around, although the english dubbing could've had better voice actors in a couple spots. the camera work was good, helping add to the suspence and shadowy presence of the antagonist.

there really isn't a lot of story here. you can get basically the whole plot minus the villains identity off the back of the case. the main character was in a car accident which killed her husband. now its christmas eve, shes about due to have her baby, and theres a stranger at the door. things are about to escalate far beyond what could've possibly her worst fears, and you are about to enter one of the most tense, bloodsoaked thrillrides of your life.

3311633,4,B00125WATQ,"In this age of Saw, Hostel, and the rest of the torture horror sub-genre, its easy for one to think that they've seen it all.  Well, Inside will prove different.  From French directors Alexandre Bustillo and Julien Maury (rumored to be helming the upcoming new Hellraiser film), Inside revolves around the pregnant Sarah (Alysson Paradis), who is close to giving birth in her condo as Christmas morning approaches.  However, an unnamed, deranged, scissor wielding woman (Beatrice Dalle) arrives, and prepares to wreak all sorts of bloody havoc on Sarah and anyone else that approaches.  While Inside provides heaping amounts of blood and gore, what sets the film apart from all the Saws and Hostels of the world is that the film is actually scary.  The moments of tension and suspense are very well done, and Inside pulls no punches in its moments of brutality and sadism.  For any fan of pure and unrelenting horror, Inside is definitely a must see, but do be forewarned, this is definitely not a film for everyone, and even more so, definitely not a film for the faint of heart.  For everyone else though, gore-drenched films that are actually scary usually don't get much better than Inside, and if this sounds like your kind of thing, you'll be pretty well satisfied with what you get here.",1210377600,,1294,4.828054298642534

you are being conned.
too often i was pulled out of the flick due to excessive blood (& some other things that didn't work.)

don't get me wrong, blood does not bother me, the thing of it is this flick
only worked about two thirds of the time.
bottom line: interesting premise that was mishandled.

it seems to me lately these horror films coming out of france are being made
for the sole purpose of raking in the cash. not only is it obvious, it is BLATANTLY
obvious.
""them"" is another horror flick that comes to mind, although slightly better than this one.

these guys here can't touch alexandre aja and gregory levasseur.

want to see a great horror flick? check out maniac with joe spinell; see the original texas chainsaw massacre (1974); see carnival of souls (original, directed by herk harvey);  the original night of the living dead (directed by george romero); see henry: portrait of a serial killer (directed by john mcnaughton.)

3311638,5,B00125WATQ,"Inside or  l'intrieur is a 2007 French horror film released in the United States just over a week ago.  It is directed by Alexandre Bustillo and Julien Maury, who apparently were mentioned as possible directors for the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hellraiser/dp/B000UVV23I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hellraiser</a>&nbsp;remake.  That would've been nice to see as Inside is definitely one of the scariest and most sick and twisted movies I've ever seen.  I'm 31 years old and this movie actually gave me nightmares but I don't want to overrate the film as your typical bloodthirsty horror-movie goer may be distracted by the actors who mumble enough that you may actually have to read what they are saying (the film is in French of course).  Also, the pace is unnerving and might require some patience from those who appreciate inferior gorefests. This is a very violent film and intentionally so, but it is so much more frightening to watch because it sets you up nicely with great context, writing, and acting.  In other words, if a film was this quality and not a horror film I would still be praising it for these reasons, and fellow cinephiles anticipating good horror know exactly what I'm talking about.  Well, this is the best horror film since Neil Marshall's 2005 film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Descent/dp/B000JBXH8M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Descent</a>&nbsp;and perhaps maybe even Takashi Miike's 1999 film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Audition/dp/B0009WFEDC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Audition</a>.  In other words, you really have to look all over the world for a good horror movie and the French deliver big on this one like they did with Aja's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/High-Tension/dp/B000ARFPMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">High Tension</a>&nbsp;and the amazing Gaspar Noe film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Irreversible/dp/B00009W0U4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Irreversible</a>.

It is set on Christmas Eve during what appears to be the 2005 riots in France.  I'm not sure those riots continued much into December but it appears to be the backdrop of the film. We follow pregnant Sarah (Alysson Paradis) after her boyfriend was killed in a car accident they both experienced months earlier.  She is stalked by a mysterious woman played by Beatrice Dalle.  Dalle is most famous for her performance in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/372-le-matin-Betty-Blue-to-American-audiences/dp/B0002TSZH4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">372 le matin (Betty Blue to American audiences)</a>&nbsp;over twenty years ago.  She really is a great actress and brings out that fierce psychotic rage again for her role here.  She is dressed in a long black Victorian gown that hides her well in the shadows and gives her a ghostly presence.  This reminded me of some of those great horror films from the silent era and was very effectively used.  It also reminded me of the Hellraiser villain Pinhead, which seemed to connect well with the directors' recent rumored involvement in that remake.  Anyway, Dalle is frightening in this role and absolutely among the most vicious villains to appear onscreen in quite some time.

Other than pushing the envelope in terms of gore, the influences here run deep.  The suspense is effective and we are only gradually given hints about the villain's motives until the end.  How far she will go to get what she wants is another thing we might question, and believe me you cannot even imagine how far she will go.  There are moments at the end of this film that scared me to the point where I felt like looking away.  Moments that rank up there with scenes from great horror films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien/dp/B00011V8IQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien</a>, Audition,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dawn-of-the-Dead/dp/B0002IQNAG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dawn of the Dead</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Suspiria/dp/B00005LQ04/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Suspiria</a>, or even the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Exorcist/dp/B0000524CY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Exorcist</a>, among others.

3311639,4,B00125WATQ,"Having read a lot of reviews on this movie and a lot of the praise it's getting, I had to try this movie out. And boy am I glad I did.

Let me get this out of the way, I do not THINK you will like this movie if you do not like gore in your movie. Cause there is a lot of it in the end. It's not all gore though cause the movie does start off pretty scary also. There was one scene that seriously made me get an uneasy scared feeling. I don't want to ruin it though so I won't mention it here. There were also scenes that made me feel uneasy in a different way... as in a `turn your head and don't look at that gore' way.

Ok now that that is out there, the movie starts out with a car wreck that's already happened. We see a woman, Sarah, bloodied and barely alive. Her dead husband or boyfriend (I can't remember) is next to her in the passenger seat. Sarah is also pregnant.

We see Sarah later at the doc's office. She's getting her baby looked at and is told they'll be inducing labor the next day. She looks miserable, and it's because of her lost love, not her new kid, who I don't think she even cares about anymore.

That night she is visited by a stranger at the door. And we, the viewer, are visited by a really good scary/gory movie. I thought the mood of the movie turned over from a little boring to unnerving to suspenseful to shocking to crazy in exactly the right moments and it was done so well. The atmosphere of the house is so claustrophobic that I constantly found myself having a hard time breathing. You want her to run, but you know she cant just make a break for it for two reason. No room and a big prego belly.

Now there are some things that didn't make sense that might turn some people into haters. For instance...the bathroom door was really easy to pierce with a pair of scissors and a glass shard, but was able to stand up to a bunch of kicks trying to knock it down. Also the cops were pretty stupid. And there are a few other things. But who cares.  The movie was fun and did what I think it wanted to try and do. Scare you... and gross you out.

 It has been so long for an instant classic to make an appearance in this generation of hollywood remakes. For a film to be considered a classic it needs to have the same effect now as it would have in the 70s, 80s, and the 90s. This film will be in the top 100 greatest horror of all time 100 years from now. If this movie was made in the 70s it would have been right up there with the rest of the greats. Being that it has come out after so many other fantastic horror movies, and that its original, in my book makes it a top 20 for sure. I have read alot of the reviews about Inside, and for the most part they are good. My personal opinion noone should give it less than four stars. There is nothing wrong with this film. It gets five stars for everything a horror film has to offer. The gore, the acting, the direction, the atmosphere, the plot and everything else is unbelievably well done. I haven't had a movie scare me in some time now, and this one definitely deliveres the scare tactic.

 I am not gonna go on to tell anything about this movie, because all the other reviews have pretty much stated what the movie was all about. If you want to see a groundbreaking horror film this is the perfect movie for you. Inside deserves every positive review it can get, for anyone who gives it a negative review you might want to steer clear of horror movies for the rest of your life.

This is a 7 star movie on GORE level and a 1 and a half star on
story and plot...IN  nutshell you have a pregnant woman who has
survived a terrible car crash but not her husband...Month's later
she is told that the baby is fine and to get rest for her upcoming
birth...We now are at her home and it is late in the evening we hear
a doorbell and our star of the movie comes to the door to see who it
is.  She looks in the peephole and we see a shadowy figure of a girl
(very fine direction I might add) The girl says some line about her
losing her daughter(hmmmm?) And if she could use her telephone.  Our
star is smart and she is SPOOKED out by this person and politely says
no...Well our bad woman does not take no for a answer and here is
when the movie starts.....
I now will point out the bad with the good is this movie..SPOILERS-SPOILERS-SPOILERS-SPOILERS-SPOLIERS
THE BAD.....
1. I myself was confused the way this movie was going? Was it suppose
to take itself seriously or was I watching another DEAD/ALIVE & EVIL
DEAD II(well the movie wants you to take it seriously and sometimes
its hard too) Just read my title and that is what I mean

2. If I saw the baby in the womb just ONE MORE TIME I would have
put my foot through my T.V. That was annoying!

3. Who is the cop turning back on the lights?????? We have ZOMBIES now????
C'MON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

4. Found my self saying are you kidding more than once(NOT GOOD)

5. New the story of the killer right off the bat(so no mystery for me)

THE GOOD.......
1. The two lead actors were VERY good in this(loved the gap-tooth villan)

2. Loved the music in this(always a plus)

3. Special F/X are fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

4. Found myself saying WOW! I can't believe they just did that more than once(VERY GOOD)

5. Funtastic GORE-GORE-GORE and than some GORE!

6. The directing was very good and had some creepiness to it which
you seldom see in a GORE flick

7. One of the top ten grossest movies of ALL time(yaheeeeee bub)

So the good outweigh the bad.  If you love ALL kinds of HORROR
buy this...If your HORROR is more like THE OMEN & THE SHINING
than stay away from this for you will be disappointed.
I am proud I have it and it is right next to THE GIRL NEXT DOOR.
I still feel JU-ON is my tops for 2000(the ghost girl coming down
the stairs says it all for me) but I was very pleased with this

3311645,5,B00125WATQ,"There was a lot of hype behind this movie and honestly, when there is so much behind a film it usually doesn't live up to it. Well, I am happy to say that here it does. I have seen a multitude of horror movies in my life and this is by far one of the most brutal films I have ever watched. The gore is off the charts, and while the movie is bloody as hell, it's realistic and not overdone. And the movie isn't just a one trick pony of amazing gore, it is also very tight and tense thriller. The movie was pulled off perfectly and I look forward to seeing more from these directors. They were slated to direct the upcoming Hellraiser remake but unfortunately dropped out.

And on a side note, if you rent or buy this movie from Blockbuster, you will not be getting the Unrated cut of the movie because Blockbuster forced Dimension to cut 7 minutes from the film. Get your copy of Inside elsewhere for the true experience of unparalleled gore.",1208822400,,941,4.256983240223463

This title certainly didn't do much for me, and in my opinion, certainly didn't live up to other reviews of this title. As far as the 'gore' raved about in this film, it really wasn't anything special with respect to gore type horror films. Really nothing any more, or anything new, than one would expect from this type of film. Certainly even an old film such as the Exorcist far exceeds the 'gore' factor of this film. Sorry I bought it... For those considering purchasing it, rent it first. Oh, and the 'lip sync' or dubbed speech... whatever they did, was pretty obvious.",1208736000,2,699,4.555555555555555
3311647,4,B00125WATQ,"Horror films have been a staple of movies for generations. And each one has had its own film to call shocking, amazing and un-filmable. INSIDE is that film for today's generation.

The story is actually quite simple. The film begins with a car crash in which Sarah (Alysson Paradis) loses her husband yet at the same time finds her in eutero baby remains unscathed. Flash forward 3 months, Christmas Eve, and we see Sarah still a bit battered and emotionally scarred at the loss.

The doctor plans for her having the baby the next day, her mother invites her to her house for the holiday which she turns down and her boss (she's a high profile photographer) makes plans to pick her up the next day to take her to the hospital. It is here that things begin to get twisted.

As she prepares for bed, Sarah hears a knock at the door. Unable to see who it is, the stranger knocking insists she has had car trouble and begs to use the phone. Sarah turns her down, telling her that her husband needs his sleep. The stranger returns retorts by telling Sarah that she knows her husband isn't sleeping because he is dead.

Terrified, Sarah calls the police, moving from the door to the living room where she sees the stranger standing in the window lighting a cigarette and trying to break the glass. The police show and find no one, promising to return later on.

After falling asleep, the camera pans back to reveal this stranger standing over Sarah's bed, a gleaming pair of silver sheers in her hand. As she begins to press these into Sarah's protruding stomach, enough to draw blood, Sarah wakes and the two tussle. While the stranger slashes enough to cut through Sarah's upper lip, Sarah hits her in the head with the table lamp providing enough time to escape to the bathroom, locking herself in.

The claustrophobia is palpable by this time as the stranger continues to beat on the door, calling out to Sarah about how she knows Sarah doesn't want the baby anyway, to let her cut if out.

The night of terror continues with various people stopping in to check on Sarah including her employer and her mother. No one is safe from this stranger who for unknown reasons desperately wants to take Sarah's unborn child. A final confrontation between the two is inevitable. The film doesn't let down on this scene and the final revelation at the film's end is one that satisfies and surprises.

The horror in this film lies in the thought of someone not only wanting to kidnap a child but to actually cut it out of its mother. Never before has such a thing been placed on film that I am aware of and I hope it never comes up again. This truly gut wrenching experience makes for one of the most terrifying nights ever put on film as well as a movie that leaves your skin crawling by the final frame. This gore filled fright fest may not be for everyone, but those willing to sit through to the end, horror fans everywhere, will not be disappointed.

This is the latest in a group of horror films to emerge from France (including HAUTE TENSION and FRONTIER(S)). If it's anything like the wave of horror that we received from Japan over the last decade, expect more nightmarish creations to haunt your dreams.",1208736000,2,3199,4.52076124567474
3311648,4,B00125WATQ,"INSIDE (2007) is a French horror-thriller directed by Alexandre Bustillo and Julien Maury. I've read that these two directors were supposedly poised to direct the upcoming ""Hellraiser"" remake in 2009. I'm not quite sure as to why they are no longer on board for that project, and from what I've seen from this film, the two young filmmakers can definitely repulse even the most experienced movie watcher in the way ""Inside"" focuses in blood and gore. I have a very strong stomach and nothing bothers me; I can stand the most gruesome images and violence as long as there is emotional content. I have not seen a lot of French horror, but one thing I can say is that if this film is any indication, the French can make ""Hostel"" and the ""Saw"" franchise seem like a kid flick. It feels like a homage to the 70's and 80's exploitive gore flicks.

Synopsis partially derived from the dvd back cover:
Four months after a pregnant woman named Sarah loses her husband in a horrific car accident, she is visited on Christmas eve by a mysterious madwoman. Alone and desperate to save herself and her unborn child, Sarah fights to stay alive as each of her potential rescuers dies at the sadistic woman's hands.

Extremely violent, bleak and brutal would be the best words to describe this film. The directors rely on violent imagery to totally immerse the viewer into intense thrills. Blood and gore are omnipresent throughout that gore fans will definitely have reason to celebrate. ""Inside"" definitely tries to push the limits of blood and violence, the subject is focused to give the viewer an uncomfortable sensation. I rather enjoy exploring those places, the dark thematic affairs that make most people turn away. This film may be great for what it is trying to do, but I personally found that it lacked an insightful vision to truly deliver pure effective suspense. It is a straight-forward gore flick that never lets up on the violent graphic details that it felt like a gore show.

Sarah (Allison Paradis) is a woman with little known origins. All I knew about her from the start is that she is pregnant, a photographer, have just survived a car accident and has been widowed by the selfsame accident. Surely, a pregnant woman who had just gone through all these tragedies would automatically promote sympathy and empathy; especially when her one safe haven (her home) has been invaded by a maniacal woman (played by Beatrice Dalle). A pregnant woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown being held prisoner at her own home is truly disturbing and the filmmakers spare no attempts to make the audience feel her pain by visual brutal violence. All the violence that happens to Sarah happens on camera, and on that effect alone, I was more repulsed than impressed. ""Inside"" is a genre film, and to call it a horror thriller is an understatement; it is a sadistic motion picture. It expresses violence against women and what is more disturbing is that the violence is done by another woman. (and others)

Just who is this unnamed woman and what does she want? This is where it gets interesting and quite frankly, the film's best asset. Beatrice Dalle's character is creepy, demented and truly enigmatic. Although in the first half of the film, she seemed to be a little too ""cardboard"" for me, quite a bit ""uniformed"" to be dressed in a black outfit with an unsettling feel. The woman is a ""genre"" character so the success of the villain is all a matter of tone and execution. Dalle's antagonistic character may be more at home with exploitation and highly stylized horror films. Thankfully, her links with Sarah's past may prove to be the film's biggest surprise and will leave folks in awe but it has been marred by a huge plot hole. There are actually some faults in the screenplay such as Sarah's bathroom door; the lock seemed too flimsy that the stalker shouldn't have any problems breaking it open.

""Inside"" is a film that expresses itself through its own bleakness. Unfortunately, suspense is almost none-existent as its tone and execution telegraphs the inevitability of its horrific outcome. The style is bleak, the cinematography is bleak, the film's set up itself is an exclamation point that the worst will happen, but you just have to root for the protagonist. It was the directors' intention; to promote automatic empathy for Sarah. Sadly, they overlooked its dramatic potential and they opted to settle for the use of violent imagery to generate sympathy. There are also some scenes that looked a little too stretched out that made them look like minor ""fillers"" to induce intensity. Actress Allison Paradis does an impressive performance as the character very much in pain and emotional collapse; while Beatrice Dalle's delivers a very creepy, frightening portrayal of our mystery woman .

Overall, ""Inside"" is more successful as a ""gorefest"" than a great addition to horror-thrillers (this isn`t a bad thing). The film is an effective ""gross-out"" feature film that is sadistic, brutal and unrelenting in its execution of violence. If what the directors are looking for is to repulse and shock audiences then they succeed hands down. However, if you are looking for pure, unadulterated suspense that can really get under your skin in a different way, look somewhere else. Folks who enjoy onscreen excessive violence and gore will embrace this film, but sadly it barely made it for me. It had all the dramatic potential but the film just became a vehicle for grim, dark scenarios with a lot of mindless bloodshed. True, the twist at the climax that explains Dalle's behavior may add some ""punch"", but it feels like a throwaway detail because of the huge hole in the plot. It felt like a gimmick that takes a stab at the audience; ""did you see that coming?""...I did, unfortunately.

I do commend the filmmakers that they did have the guts to follow through its very bleak and violent execution; that they knew exactly what they wanted to do and they weren`t pretentious about it at all.

Recommended timidly, rent it first. [3  Stars]

For contrasting opinions on the film, check out Dave K. and D. Wilson's reviews, they both have written excellent reviews of the film.

3311649,3,B00125WATQ,"Yes, this film is one of the goriest and bloodiest films I've ever seen.
Yes, the make up is top notch.
Yes, some of the graphic violence here will certainly make most people uncomfortable to say the least.

But after a while, I mean, after the blood bath starts it gets to be just more of the same. Gore and more gore. Blood and more blood. It is all wonderfully done. But the script is boring and predictable. Blood is all you get. (laughs)

A pregnant woman loses her husband in a car accident. Months later, on the day before giving birth to her baby, her house is invaded by a maniacal woman who wants to take the baby from her... literally.

...But what the film is really made up is this: the script is always creating cheap (contrived) ways to put more people in the house for the woman to (over)kill. And after a while, it all gets boring and repetitive.

So, if you are looking for one of the bloodiest rides of your life, climb aboard. This film is for you.
But if you are looking for a great horror story full of new and imaginative insights and twists, look somewhere else.

I gave it three stars because within the ""almost-pornographic violence"" sub-genre where this film belongs to, it deserves five stars... but comparing it to the best things in horror cinema, this deserves one star.

Still it is worth a look... for the eye-popping make up effects. The French know what they do.",1208649600,,1397,4.4375

It's just a good old fashioned cat and mouse game with seriously bloody set pieces.  And to thin, this is based on a true story!!!  Frenchmen are the new gods of horror.  Watch out Argento.

3311651,5,B00125WATQ,"I suppose I'll start the praise mildly by saying that this is probably the greatest horror film of the new century(Session 9, High Tension, and The Descent being it's only real competition)... to which you reply, ""horror since 2000 has been terrible anyway so big deal.""  Okay then, what if I said that this is one of the greatest horror films... ever?  Got your attention now I bet!  Inside is the latest in a line of French horror movies that have provided the goods(the aforementioned High Tension, Them, and the upcoming Frontiers are a few) that American directors should take note of(instead they're too busy searching out their next film to remake and slap a PG-13 rating on).  The premise here is a simple yet incredibly intense one; a pregnant woman very near expectancy, alone on a rainy night, with a madwoman who will stop at nothing to take her unborn baby from her.  The who, how, and why just add to the unrelenting experience... but not before the buckets of blood rain down!  The gorehounds out there will be far from dissapointed, in fact, our lead suffers a brutal attack from a BIG pair of scissors to get the film rolling nicely... leaving a nasty looking gash across her mouth and face for the rest of the film.  Nearly every moment of bloodshed pushes the envelope of not only ""good taste"" but also brutality(the way it should be).  The icing on the cake comes in the form of excellent direction that provides tension as well as some really cool effects(most notably what they do with sound during the kills).  Frightening, gory, and disturbing are all words that fit this movie perfectly, and in the recent horror genre don't find themselves being used as much as most of us would like them to be.  Make no mistake, this is far from ""fun"" horror... there are no sly in-jokes or moments of levity... this is the scene from The Exorcist where Regen uses a crucifix to do the unthinkable to herself, just spread into an hour and a half.  In other words, it's an instant classic that no horror fan should miss(and it gets Dimension Extreme off the hook for a lot of the trash that they have dropped on our laps prior).  *VIEWERS BEWARE*  I heard that the cut of the film that Blockbuster is renting out is edited down by an unbelievable 7 whole minutes so steer clear of that version!",1208563200,44,2304,4.563106796116505

I'm a strong gore hound and this movie actually made me gag.",1208563200,2,375,4.651515151515151
3311653,5,B00125WATQ,"There's a lot of hype surrounding Inside; people are praising this movie as an instant classic. Going into the movie I wasn't sure what to expect. Most of the time a movie with this much hype almost always fails to deliver. But with Inside this movie is well worth the hype and this will go down as one of the greats of the horror genre.

Since 2000 I think there's been a lot of solid horror flicks and despite being in remake hell there are some solid horror flicks, but with that said there are also many problems with the horror genre. For those sick of the typical Hollywood horror film or the angry spirit movie and for those who want a no holds barred movie with extreme violence and not some watered down product, Inside is the movie for you. This is what the horror genre is all about and this is the type of movie Hollywood is far too afraid to produce. Right not France is red hot in the horror genre, and Inside is a movie that shows us why.

Inside starts off a bit slow, but it's never boring. Though I couldn't help, but think it might be one of those movies with all hype and nothing else. But once the suspense kicks in never once does it let up. This is the type of movie that will have you on the edge of your seat until the very shocker of an ending. After you watch the movie the images will be burnt into your head and it's hard to shake.

The screenplay by Alexandre Bustillo was overall quite solid; it's a straight-forward movie and overall quite simple, but very effective. While the characters aren't all that much developed in a movie like this they didn't have to be. The screenplay works well and is always mostly interesting.

Directors Alexandre Bustillo & Julien Maury, deliver one of the most disturbing movies I have seen in ages. Their scenes are well paced and never lag. Inside is a great movie, but there's nothing really ground-breaking. But despite they very much deliver on the thrills and chills and also deliver on some brutal violence. Most of the movie takes place in a house and never once does it get boring. Bustillo and Maury always keep it interesting and eerie.

What makes this work is you never know what will happen next; Sarah played by Alysson Paradis is pregnant and in most movies a character like her is never in danger due to PC Hollywood. But there is some graphic violence against her through out the movie. It's scenes like this that will shock you and you'll be wondering what the filmmakers will do next. Bustillo & Maury don't play it safe just when you think they won't go there they do. They take it one step further and when they do it really shakes things up and you have no idea what these guys will do in the next scene.

Like I said the characters are all that developed, but in a movie like this they didn't have to be. The fact Sarah is pregnant really raises the stakes and makes her sympathetic right off the bat. Seeing what she goes through is just crazy. And seeing some of the violence against her is cringe worthy. This is something you won't see in American horror. Maybe back in the 70s or 80s, but you'll never see anything like this now.

Beatrice Dalle who played La Femme is one of the scariest and most sadistic characters I have seen in a horror flick in quite sometime. Some people were complaining about a female villain. Well make no mistake woman or not she was damn creepy and easily rates as one of the most sadistic this genre has ever seen.

A lot of people talk about how gory this movie is. Well it is quite gory, but not as much as it's being made out to be. It's just that Inside is so brutally violent that people over-do it with the gore level. This movie is quite extreme in the violence and while there is a whole lot of the red stuff to be found it's not as gory as people say it's just that it's so violent. I recommend this movie to any horror fan that wants something a little more extreme. Inside is a deeply shocking, disturbing and violent movie.

Inside starts off slightly slow, but once it gets going it keeps you on the edge of your seat. The suspense and tension never once lags, it's violent and disturbing with a truly twisted ending. Bustillo & Maury push the envelope one step further than any horror film has done in recent memory.",1208476800,7,4255,4.342138364779874

The best way to describe this movie is a cross between ""When A  Stranger Calls"" and ""High Tension"" with the brutality level being somewhere in the middle of the two. Personally, I don't think it even comes close to the SAW or Hostel franchises in terms of brutality and gore. ""Inside"" wasn't a bad movie, but I think it's being extremely over-hyped as brutal and gory.",1208390400,,573,4.509615384615385

3311657,5,B00125WATQ,"Inside is the story of Sarah, a young woman who on Christmas Eve is expecting her first child. Unfortunately Sarah isn't too happy in the circumstances as a four months earlier she was behind the wheel of her car with her boyfriend when she struck another. She survived with the baby, but unfortunately her boyfriend died. Now months later she's depressed with a bun in the oven. She avoids her supportive mother, gets encouragement from her boss then goes home to spend her last night alone in her home. Unfortunately hours later a woman acting weirdly shows up at her door saying strange things that disturb her. She scares her and brings attention to the police and then settles back down thinking things are alright. Of course this being a horror movie things are very far from alright and later the woman returns brandishing a big pair of shears to cut the baby out of Sarahs stomach. Things don't work out as planned and Sarah is locked in a bathroom while the woman taunts her from outside in the house. Soon people show up to help her and things happen. Horribly violent things.

I had heard a lot of things about Inside before seeing it. Its been called brutal and disturbing which it is. Some said it depended mainly on the killing not interested in a story which in a way it does. But to me I have to admit that this is one of the most brilliant horror films I've seen since catching Audition years ago on cable. It deserves all the praise it gets and to me was leagues better than both Them or Haute Tension. It doesn't sell the story short with characters developed but mostly playing it for the situation. As the first victims fall to the female (only credited as La Femme)  suspense is built up raising tension in the film and actually creating something many horror films don't seem to rely on, actual tension over violence (though like I said thats there as well). The kills are brutal, violent and definitely bloody (this is the first film in a long time that earns its ultraviolent tag) but never sicken in the way they should never making them feel exploitative. And the end is beatifully nihlistic in its tone earning its disturbing finale.

Its a well made horror film that does what rarely happens and actually creates a scary picture. The gore is incredibly well done (more blood flows here than on a Lone Wolf and Cub picture) and the acting is great from Allyson Paradis as Sarah to Beatrice Dalle as La Femme. And the directors do use little techniques to disturb and freak out their viewer (I like one killing that is sad but theres a more disturbing one involving a character who shouldn't be in the situation being cooed by La Femme before being impaled in the head and played with as he dies). This is one of the best horror films I've seen in years. Check it out if you have the heart for it.",1208304000,,2824,4.490272373540856
