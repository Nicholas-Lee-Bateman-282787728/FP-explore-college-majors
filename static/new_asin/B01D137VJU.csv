8754618,5,B01D137VJU,"This is by far one of the best movies I have seen in quite a some time. I never write reviews for the movies since it is quite a subjective topic. I checked few reviews before watching this movie and to say I was quite astonished with the comments, specially for a movie with almost unknown star cast.
Coming back to the movie, the story is good, well written with glimpses of real world. The stars are unknown to me but have justified to the role. Even though movie portrays a common story of a typical Indian family, their perspective on girls marriage etc., the story is well knit to form a nice love story with an unconventional ending. Get ready to feel some emotional roller coaster rides, few boring songs but some really good performances from not so known actors and finally a movie worth a watch in long time.",1516320000,,819,4.430463576158941
8754619,5,B01D137VJU,"This movie does not have English subtitles, but I watched it anyway.  Even though I didn't understand what was being said, it was so beautifully acted that I had to watch to the end.  I will definitely watch this movie again.",1515369600,,225,4.463414634146342
8754620,5,B01D137VJU,"Let me start by saying I have a deeply ingrained dislike of sad movies (isn't life sad enough?) and a particularly deep hatred of anything of the Nicholas Sparks variety-is there anything more cliche or grating then his books and the subsequent horrific films that are then spawned? I think not. I'm not saying this to vent, tho I do enjoy taking every opportunity to share my disgust of Sparks overwrought trash machine, but mostly so you'll understand where I'm coming from when I admit to loving this movie. Is it pandering to those of us who dream that hot misunderstood ""bad boy"" will ignore the hot flirty girl and fall desperately in love with us? Sure. But the trick is is that it does it so well. Harshvardhan is heartbreaking as Inder and gives him an aching brooding vibe reminiscent of Mr. Rochester in Jane Eyre, that desperate need for something pure and sweet that he knows he doesn't deserve. And Mawra is perfect as Saru the mild librarian who wins his heart. And so I pronounce it worth your investment of tissues, for you will need many tissues.",1490832000,,1064,4.605263157894737
8754621,5,B01D137VJU,"I loved this movie. It was sad at the end, and I hate sad endings, but it was still good.",1486684800,,89,3.5

8754623,5,B01D137VJU,"One of the most beautiful Hindi love stories I've seen in a long time. On the line of the greatest love story, Devdas. I cried the whole time. Excellent acting, great story. Will watch it again and again. Can't say enough about it. There are no words... Get your hankies ready because it is a real tear-jerker!",1479859200,,310,4.456140350877193
