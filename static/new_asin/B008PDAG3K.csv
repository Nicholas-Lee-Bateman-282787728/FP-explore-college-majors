5178412,5,B008PDAG3K,"Very interesting, entertaining & well written crime drama.  Multi part episodes for each of the 2 series.  British dramas are typically very well performed/written, & are among the best on television.",1447718400,,200,5.419354838709677
5178413,5,B008PDAG3K,Two engaging Britsh legal mysteries.  Interesting to see how different their legal system is compared to America.  Loved them both.  But was the series cancelled?,1422489600,4,162,5.4

5178417,5,B008PDAG3K,Held your interest and had a surprising ending. I would recommend this for anyone that likes the British shows. My favorite kind.,1399161600,11,129,4.909090909090909
5178418,3,B008PDAG3K,"It did not realize that there was no closed caption and I had trouble hearing and understanding what was said, otherwise the stories were fine, heartrendering, almost too painful to watch.",1391299200,14,188,5.096774193548387
5178419,3,B008PDAG3K,the plot seems great even if a little downer.  But the sound quality is terrible.  It should enter the 21 century and add close caption. the angst of all the actors dominates the entire production,1383177600,2,196,4.571428571428571
5178420,4,B008PDAG3K,Cannot say much about this as I have not watched it. But having said that my wife did and said she enjoyed it very much.,1366416000,2,120,3.84

8529510,3,B008PDAG3K,"This is a review of Criminal Justice - Season 2 only. I have only just finished watching this long and torturous mini-series. I gave it 3 stars for the storyline and the all-star cast. However, this mini-series was sooo s-l-o-w to watch. It could have been made, easily and more watchable, in 2 hours instead of 5. If you have nothing else to watch and a few hours to waste, then this is the show for you - otherwise, avoid it like the plague.",1499299200,,443,4.285714285714286
8529511,2,B008PDAG3K,I thought it was different court cases and not following one person - eh,1488585600,,72,4.214285714285714

8529513,3,B008PDAG3K,"I expected better after seeing such great reviews. It is okay, but it seems like Ben Whishaw only knows how to play one character, from Richard II to London Spy, to Lilting and this series, same expressions and gestures and same disrobing for effect. Not bad, just kind of tiresome.",1484438400,,282,4.66
8529514,3,B008PDAG3K,Liked the actual stories but was disappointed neither had CC (closed caption).  I suppose I should have checked that before I purchased the DVD.  My bad.  My husband is hard of hearing and both of us need CC for British films.  Sometimes it is hard to understand the English accents.,1474588800,7,283,4.6
8529515,3,B008PDAG3K,"I enjoyed what I could hear, but without subtitles half was loss due to my hearing disability and poor audio quality. I also enjoyed the newer 2016 series on HBO with subtitles (The night of).",1473206400,3,192,4.514285714285714
