7479943,3,B016UTP1MQ,"As I post this review there are three others that go into some depth about the film. I received an advance screening copy from the studio for an objective review and watched it last night, As noted by others, this is an independent film distributed by Sony Picture Classics. Its an autobiographical film by the writer/director who was a daughter of a man with Bi-polar disorder (hence the title  as a child she called it polar bear disorder). She cash her own daughter in the role of her own character. The major name in the cast is Mark Ruffalo, playing the father. And he gets the most screen time.

I have to say that  honestly  I was not as thrilled with the film as the other reviewers before me. Yes, Ruffalo does have to do some method acting to show the manic side of Cam, the father. But most of the film is wondering how the two daughters are going to handle it. And its the two girls that really impressed me. The film takes place over a two-year period and Cam has his ups and downs (mostly downs). He has no job  he cant work  and we are never sure what he does all day when his girls are in school (His wife takes off for a year to go to college. And, I don't think I missed it but the family was poor before the wife left and  though she got a college scholarship, we don't know how Cam can raise two girls with no income. Oh, yes, its important to mention that Cam is a chain smoker. You will NEVER (really) see Cam without a cigarette in his mouth. I realize the film is set in the late 1970s.. but cigarettes cost money. And, if watching people smoke in films bothers you, this is not going to help your enjoyment.
I don't like spoilers and won't tell you how the film ends but some folks may get it while others will feel a lack of conclusion.

There is no cure for Manic Depression (except to pop Lithium pills). I wondered if there was a restriction on alcohol when taking the pills  Cam does drink almost as much as he smokes. A quick google showed that you can drink in moderation along with lithium.

The BD has a few bonuses. There is a full length commentary with the writer/director, the producer and Ruffalo (which I have not listened to) 5 deleted scenes (lasting a total of two minutes and a Q&A with the cast and production crew at Sundance showing (it runs 10 minutes), There is also the films trailer. There are subtitles in English plus 14 (!!) other languages, including Serbian, Slovak, Polish, Hindi and Icelandic!

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7479944,5,B016UTP1MQ,"Written and directed by Maya Forbes (The Larry Sanders Show, Monsters vs Aliens), Infinitely Polar Bear is an engaging, well-acted film about a family coping with the usual problems of life that have been complicated for them by one member's mental illness.

Cameron ""Cam"" Stuart (wonderfully played by Mark Ruffalo) is a complicated man. Back in the 60's, he was a typical free-spirited rich kid who got kicked out of both Exeter and Harvard but didn't really care because he came from money.  On the plus side, his free-thinking devil-may-care ways and boyish charm attracted the interest of Maggie (equally well-played by Zoe Saldana), who ended up marrying him and having two daughters with him.  But that was then and this is now (1978) and Cam, who's smart and gifted but unable to hold onto any job for very long, has been diagnosed as having bi-polar disorder.  After a particularly stressful manic episode that truly scares Maggie and the girls, Amelia (Imogene Wolodarsky) and Faith (Ashley Aufderheide), Cam has to go into treatment and stay at a halfway house. Adding to all of this stress is that the family is essentially broke and Maggie's job can barely keep them treading at poverty-level water.  Although Cam came from money, his parents Murray (Keir Dullea) and Pauline (Beth Dixon) can't help because their money is all but gone and his other relatives who still have money won't help for various reasons.  When Cam is finally released from the halfway house and comes home, the family is faced with some very difficult decisions.

With Cam unable to find work and the girls ending up having to go to a problematic school because of the lower-income neighborhood they now live in, Maggie decides the only hope they have for improving their situation is if she goes back to school and gets her business degree. The problem is that they're in Boston and the only school she can get into is in New York.  Which leads to the next difficult decision:  can Cam keep himself together enough to be a functional stay-at-home dad and look after the girls while Maggie is away in New York?

A lot of Infinitely Polar Bear's intimate feeling comes from Forbes' drawing on her own personal experience growing up with a bi-polar father and her mother's having to be absent while going to business school.  The ""Polar Bear"" reference in the title comes from her father's joking nickname for his condition.  In an added element of intimacy, Forbes cast her own daughter, Imogene Wolodarsky, as Amelia, the older daughter in the film who is also Forbes' counterpart from her own childhood.

But what really makes Infinitely Polar Bear work as a film is Forbes' seamless direction and insightful script combined with superb performances from the entire cast. Forbes does not give her characters any easy outs from their problems and brings out how even the smallest things can become mountain-like obstacles to be dealt with.  Some of the best scenes occur between Cam and Maggie where Ruffalo's Cam desperately wants to repair things but Saldana's Maggie keeps a cautious emotional distance, not because she doesn't love him anymore - she does, very much - but because she's seem him relapse too many times. And the other best scenes occur between Cam and his daughters where Amelia and Faith are kids needing their father to be the mature one but half the time find themselves having to be the mature ones when Cam's manic impulses threaten to get the better of him. There is a sequence of scenes between Cam and the girls that are nothing short of brilliant as we see them switching roles and reactions, first with Cam being childish and the girls being mature, then with the girls being childish and Cam forced into being mature, and then with both Cam and the girls being childish at the same time and finally with all of them being mature at the same time. It really drives home just how complicated family relationships are, particularly at that age. Wolodarsky and Aufderheide are truly convincing as Amelia and Faith, not only as simply being young girls and daughters but also as being older and younger sister to each other.

But although everyone in the film delivers excellent performances, Mark Ruffalo still stands out for his portrayal of Cam. It is a very layered performance, which it has to be in order to bring out just how complex of an individual Cam is and how much he has to struggle to be, if not actually normal, at least functional enough to do what his wife and kids need him to do. Ruffalo walks that very fine line magnificently, showing what Cam is like when he's handling things well and what he's like when he isn't. And how it's a struggle for him to know when he slipping across the line, giving into impulses that make sense to him but unable - or sometimes unwilling - to see or comprehend how people are reacting to his behavior.  Ruffalo truly deserves an Academy Aware nomination for his performance, and if there's any justice in Hollywood he'll get it.

On a side note, the musical score by Theodore Shapiro (The Devil Wears Prada, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty) is well done, enhancing the mood in various scenes without distracting from what is taking place on the screen. And the cinematography by Bobby Bukowski (99 Homes, The Stone Angel) gives all of the scenes in and around Boston and in all of the interior scenes a very natural un-staged feel.

Highly recommended as a finely delivered story about the complexities of mental illness, of family and of small victories can matter as much as big ones. And about how love, while it may not in fact be able to solve all problems, can at least make them endurable.",1446163200,17,5664,4.744659206510682
7479945,5,B016UTP1MQ,"I love movies and I'm a clinical social worker, who happens to have bipolar disorder.  I recommend and adore this movie on every level. I saw it with a dear friend who also has bipolar disorder.  When it was over, we knew that not only was it a loving beautiful film, but that someone involved in it's creation had intimate knowledge of bipolar.  We were not surprised to learn that the director is paying a loving tribute to her father, who had bipolar disorder and the daughter in the film is played by her own daughter.

While not everyone who has bipolar will express the condition in the same manner, all of the indicators of mania and of depression demonstrated in the film were spot on.  Mark Ruffalo brought a powerful degree of warmth and humanity to his stellar performance (but, doesn't he always?).  The entire cast and direction are fantastical! I think what I loved most is that it is not a film about bipolar, it is a film about a family and love, that happens to have a leading character living with and working through his bipolar.  Set in the '70's it is also historically accurate in the treatment options and medications available.  (Happily, for those of us in the field and living with bipolar now, great gains have been made in that area.)

""Infinitely Polar Bear"" instantly became my TOP PICK of the year as a film that accurately, compassionately portrays bipolar and helps destigmatize an often misunderstood and misrepresented illness. While, not incidentally, not sacrificing an ounce of entertainment value.  Hurray for ""Infinitely Polar Bear!""  I so wish more film makers would be as responsible in their depictions.",1445472000,34,1646,4.801418439716312
7479946,4,B016UTP1MQ,"""Infinitely Polar Bear"" (2014 release; 90 min.) brings the story of Cam Stewart (played by Mark Ruffalo) and his family. As the movie opens, we get a clever montage of 8 mm. footage from 1967 (how Cam and Maggie met in Boston and eventually married) on to the present (i.e. 1978). Cam is a manic depressive and he just got fired (again) on the first day of his latest job. It leads to an outburst and eventually Cam is put away. We then move to ""six weeks later', where Cam is in a halfway house. Maggie is desperate to improve their financial situation and decides to do an MBA on a full scholarship at Columbia, leaving Cam to take care of their 2 daughters Amelia and Faith. At this point we're about 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this movie is a labor of love from writer-director Maya Forbes (best known for her work on The Larry Sanders Show). She bases the story on her own upbringing and as such the movie is pretty much autobiographical. To make things even more authentic, she cast her 12 yr. old daughter (Imogene Wolodarsky) as her younger self (Amelia). I noticed in the movie's opening credits that J.J. Abrams is one of the executive producers. Second, I don't know to what extent the portrayal of the Cam character is an accurate reflection of being manic-depressive or bi-polar. Yes, there are the highs and the lows, and yes, there is the habit/need to never throw out anything and instead collect like hamsters do, but is that enough? I do not know. But it all looks quite innocent on the big screen, and no 'bad' things happen to anyone in this. Third, the four leading acting performances (Ruffalo, Wolodarsky, Zoey Baldana as Maggie, and Ashley Aufderheide as Faith) are all enjoyable, and the interaction between them feels authentic. Fourth, the movie, set in the late 70s, contains a treasure trove of period cars from the 60s and 70s. Check out the Peugot station wagon Cam has at some point, but that's just one example. Truly a eye candy for car aficionados. Last but not least, there is a terrific soundtrack, including both the original score (by Theodore Shapiro) and a bunch of songs (best of all, George Harrison's Run of the Mill, which plays at the conclusion of the movie and over the closing credits; and also China Forbes (of Pink Martini, and sister of Maya Forbes) bringing an excellent new tune called ""The Northern Line"", also playing over the closing credits). The soundtrack is available here on Amazon.

This movie made quite a splash at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival. No idea why it took another 18 months for this to get released in theaters. ""Infinitely Polar Bear"" opened in August at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and appeared to have enjoyed a good run. The early evening screening where I saw this at was attended nicely. If you are in the mood for something that could be quite heavy but in fact is brought with a light touch and a smile never far away, and you want to see something light years away from Hollywood's standard fare of comic book action heroes, I might suggest you give this a try, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.",1445212800,28,3267,4.582905982905983

7479957,2,B016UTP1MQ,"Mark Ruffalo is so talented that he can out act anyone (the reason for two stars), but even his talent is not enough to make this film worth watching.  The film focuses on a dad's battle with bipolar disorder, which was known as manic depression at the time that the movie was set in.  So this film is about watching a depressed person live through the depressing 70's.  They make a lot of montages to attempt to garner audience interest (translation: keep us awake), but the montages are just a delay for what the viewer is sure to hope for - the end of the movie.  The movie doesn't really have any plot or goals.  It just shows a dad who ties to manage both his mental health issues as well as his kids.  He often does not do a good job at either, which makes an unsatisfying movie even less satisfying.  Overall, the characters just seem so disconnected from each other and the audience, that the film is just a long convoluted story that isn't compelling or worth seeing.",1500940800,,976,4.388888888888889

He even gets the infinitely complex look in his eyes, of the different phases of a manic episode.....euphoric, scary, childlike, endearing, heartbreaking.
Zoe Saldana and the girls are outstanding as a family living with the hardships of severe mental illness.
Despite the unpredictability and total chaos Ruffalo creates, Saldana teaches their girls compassion and understanding, allowing them to live with their dad's illness in a more matter-of-fact way, especially uncommon for that time period.
They are able to look back on their childhood as happy, appreciating a dad who battled a relentless illness, and his often misguided, but consistent focus on being a dedicted, loving father. He left an unmistakeable legacy of love and pieces of wisdom brought from the wreak age of a terrible illness.",1497571200,,889,5.35

7479982,5,B016UTP1MQ,"INFINITELY POLAR BEAR is a color movie of an upwardly-mobile middle-class family.  The family includes a husband (Mark Ruffalo), wife (Zoe Saldana), and two young daughters.  Mr. Ruffalo plays a man with bipolar disorder, which manifests itself by occasional outbursts of anger, and excessive attempts to be friendly and sociable with neighbors in his apartment building.  One of the reoccurring themes in this movie is Mr. Ruffalo's failure to take his medication (lithium tablets) on a timely basis.  Although the characters played by Mr. Ruffalo and by Zoe Saldana are college-educated, the family's living situation is bogged down by the fact that Mr. Ruffalo is rendered non-employable because of his mental illness, and because Ms. Saldana has only a low-paying job as a filing clerk.

FATHER/DAUGHTER and FATHER/MOTHER interactions.  A superlative aspect of this movie is the frequent and accurate depictions of interactions between the father and daughters and mother and daughters.  In particular, the viewer will find intriguing the episodes where the daughters try to correct the weird and inappropriate behaviors of the father.  One scene in this movie, is that the daughters refuse to bring their friends home, because they are ashamed of the ramshackle state of their apartment, and are ashamed of the father's strange behaviors.  But this movie provides an optimistic twist to these adverse situations.  For example, the viewer will enjoy the generous scenes where the daughters make hand-drawn signs and post them throughout the apartment, tell the father to STOP SMOKING CIGARETTES because of health hazards.  Also, the viewer will very much enjoy the scene near the end of the movie, where the daughters finally bring their friends home, and where the friends meet the father, and where there are NOT any embarrassing consequences.

STRUGGLE TO ACQUIRE CAREER SKILLS.  A reoccurring theme in this movie, is Zoe Saldana's motivation to gain career skills, by applying to business school.  SPOILER ALERT:  We show Zoe Saldana filling out applications to business school, and we find out that she was accepted to an MBA program in New York City.  Much of the movie takes place during Zoe Saldana's weekly commutes from New York City to visit her family in Boston.  We see Zoe Saldana going on a job interview at a financial company in Boston, and many adults in America will sympathize with the awkward scene where Zoe Saldana is harassed by the hiring manger during the job interview, because of the fact that she is a mother with two children, and thus will not be expected to devote enough time to her job.  To repeat, the job interview scene, which shows the harassment of Zoe Saldana, and Zoe Saldana's attempts to save face, take the form of amazingly excellent examples of acting.

EASY ON THE EYE.  Zoe Saldana, who is one of the more prominent and wealthy actors in Hollywood, is abundantly easy on the eye.  Even if her dialogue consisted entirely of gibberish-sentences, such as, ""Woofer-dingle, muffy-pool, hummuna-hummana-hummuna,"" or other such nonsense, the viewer would still enjoy the movie because the actress is so beautiful and easy on the eye.  Child actor Ashley Aufderheide is even more beautiful, and her various facial expressions are infinitely charming.  Ms. Aufderheide has also acted in the movies, Going in Style (2017) and Preacher (2016).  Even if Ashley Aufderheide's dialogue consisted of typical pre-teen gibberish, her appearances on screen would still be intriguing, because she is so beautiful (at least, in terms if childhood standards) and easy on the eye.  Regarding the acting and dialogue itself, there is not one false step in the acting or in the script, throughout the entire course of this excellent movie.

CONCLUSION.  INFINITELY POLAR BEAR has a happy ending.  In passing, I might note that the film that seems closest to this movie is RIDING IN CARS WITH BOYS, starring Drew Barrymore, Steve Zahn, Brittany Murphy, and James Woods.  RIDING IN CARS WITH BOYS also stars an upwardly mobile, and highly educated female (Drew Barrymore as a budding author), and Steve Zahn, who plays her husband, who is a social misfit. He is a social misfit in a way similar to the social misfit played by Mark Ruffalo.  The character played by Drew Barrymore has a child ""Jason,"" played by Adam Gardia.  FIVE STARS for INFINITELY POLAR BEAR.",1472947200,,4389,5.096503496503496

7480021,3,B016UTP1MQ,"Writer Maya Forbes (Monsters vs. Aliens and The Rocker) makes her directorial debut with this autobiographical story based on a few years of her childhood.  Imogen Wolodarsky (daughter of Maya Forbes and producer Wally Wolodarsky) plays Maya from the approximate ages of 9-12 and Ashley Aufderheide plays her younger sister, Faith.  Both girls are terrific as they deal with their manic depressive father Cam (Mark Ruffalo, Spotlight) who is left in charge for 18 months while mother and wife Maggie (Zoe Saldana, Avatar) heads to New York City to acquire a masters degree.

Just before all of this, Cam is admitted for psychological rehabilitation as a result of a scary breakdown in front of his family.  After a stint at a halfway house, he is allowed to come home and shows progress.  Enough that Maggie can pursue her degree.  Shes unable to find good work in Boston where they live, thus the career change.  She returns home on weekends, but most of her time is spent reconnecting with the girls and keeping Cam on his meds.

The film has some frightening episodes, especially when Cam leaves the girls alone.  Drinking and playful carousing is another characteristic he must learn to control.  The film as you might expect is seen mostly from the girls perspective.  And quite frankly had it not been for their wit and wisdom the film would just be another film about dealing with depression.  Ruffalo is excellent as the father who clearly loves his wife and children, yet must constantly fight the manic urges and not always successfully.  Forbes keeps things movie through its brisk 90 minutes and shows compassion for all the characters, especially Cameron.  The look of 1970s Boston is realistic and the photography is well done.  I did think we were left hanging at the end.  I wanted to know what happened next.  FYI: The title refers to what Faith calls her dad's malady.

The Blu ray comes with a 1080p video resolution and a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  The transfer looks great.  Nice clean digitally shot images with strong coloring and textures.  These are most evident in the various items of clothing and smaller artifacts within the familys apartment.  Good skin-tones throughout.  The audio includes a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track which is also excellent.  With a dialog-centric film like this you want a clear presentation and that is what you get.  Surrounds and the LFE channel are well modulated and properly directed.  Numerous subtitle options are available including English SDH, French, Russian and more (but no Spanish??).  Extras include a commentary track with Ruffalo, Forbes and Wally Wolodarsky, a Q&A at the L.A. Film Festival, some deleted scenes, Sony previews and a theatrical trailer.",1457568000,,2721,4.975609756097561

7480037,5,B016UTP1MQ,"my husband & I watched this together. We LOVE this movie. It's so real. And a happy ending. Thank God. Too many films about people with ""different brains"" that end in suicide or other bad events.
 I diagnosed myself with manic-depression in the  60s when I was 15. Was reading a book about Lord Byron. I told my father (who had a brain like mine, only he got raging angry depressions & I mostly had/have the hyper euphoric manias) ""Daddy, I have what Lord Bryon had. It's manic-depression."" Dad said ""you're not crazy, you're a poet.""
I have had numerous poems published in various journals but am not ""just a poet.""
 after Many wrong diagnoses (schizophrenia, ""being artistic,"" ""needing a dance studio,"" ETC) I was diag. at age \
46 with manic-depression (bipolar disorder) began the Long trip of trying various medications. Most made me More hyper/manic. Finally got on the right combo.
Anyway, this film is so so real & beautiful. Great acting (the kids are wonderful) by all. Director lived this life so she knows whereof she ""speaks."" My husband stuck with me through all the ups & downs for nearly 30 years & still going. Just like the wife in this Lovely movie!
Mark Ruffalo is just Genius! Watched it two times in a row. Yes, I'm a little manic right now but am on my meds. ha",1455667200,,1284,4.54978354978355
7480038,3,B016UTP1MQ,"There are two reasons to go out of your way to see this movie. One is its focus on the effect of mental illness in a family setting. It's openly autobiographical - the father of writer/director Maya Forbes and her sister suffered from bipolar disorder - which lends it a sense of authenticity. On the other hand, I wonder whether Ms Forbes might have gained something by putting the story a little more at a distance from herself, perhaps updating it to be a contemporary piece. I expect her mother would still have a tough time getting the kind of job she wants: that kind of sexism is still very much with us, equal rights acts notwithstanding.

The second reason to see the movie is Mark Ruffalo, who is amazing as the afflicted father, Cameron. That sounds as if it might be a flashy performance. Not the case. The reverse, in fact. Mr Ruffalo IS Cameron for the duration of the movie. He really is one hell of an actor. Line up his work here with that in Foxcatcher, or The Kids Are Alright, or You Can Count On Me: all related, but subtly different and completely convincing.

He is very well supported here by Zoe Saldana as his wife, along with Imogene Wolodarsky and Ashley Aufderheide as his daughters. They make a convincingly troubled but loving family unit.

I wish the film held together better than it does. It doesn't feel as satisfying as I suspect Ms Forbes set out to make it. I don't really know why. Maybe there's an uncertainty of tone: the story follows the facts, and maybe that isn't helpful in helping us understand the issues. Maybe it needed, as I said above, a bit more distance. All the same, it is a commendable movie in many ways, certainly worth seeing, especially for Mr Ruffalo.",1455667200,2,1713,4.519354838709678

I left town before his big breakdown that begins this movie, so my memories are of a gifted and intelligent man capable of poor decisions, and a brilliant, stable, but challenged wife in the Harvard Square area.  Most of this movie showcases amusingly creative and manic episodes, and there is nothing really dark, which is cool for me, because dark stuff is hard for me to watch.  I never saw any in real life in this family and would not have known of the diagnosis except for being told.  This is for me almost like watching home movies of old friends.  I find this very true to life.

7480097,3,B016UTP1MQ,"Wish I could have given it a better rating (I'd like to give it a 2.5) but I was thrown by the character Cam's full-on manic personality, with no depression thrown in. Shouldn't there be at least one scene or two of his being overwhelmed by disabling depression, which is a characteristic of bipolar? Even his outbursts of anger, which can emanate from depression, of course, also seem to come from his out-of-this-world manic personality. He is constantly on, which isn't exactly a true-to-life portrayal of this illness, from what I know of it. And I am a fan of Mark Ruffalo's. He's an amazing actor and is very good in this role, but I just wanted to see more of the downs and a little less of the ups to make the character appear more realistic.

And while we're on the subject of not seeming realistic, Zoe Saldana's character, Maggie, seems much too passive. She is always OK with everything. She never appears to be as disturbed as she should be when Cam goes and does something stupid or potentially dangerous to himself or while with the girls. She doesn't go beyond ""oh-well"" to me. I guess if she felt the girls were at all threatened by their dad she wouldn't have left them in his charge, but I just wasn't convinced she was that concerned even during the times she voiced doubts. I mean, with all the smoking and drinking and flying-off-the-handle behavior of Cam's, Maggie should be a little more concerned, don't you think?

Anyway, the girls are adorable (the elder girl being the daughter of the writer and director of the film) and quite good in this film. But for a more realistic portrayal of bipolar disorder cue up Silver Linings Playbook.",1452988800,2,1663,4.614864864864865
7480098,5,B016UTP1MQ,Thought it was a good portrayal of one mans experience with bipolar and how his family unit dealt with it.,1452988800,,106,4.35
7480099,5,B016UTP1MQ,"I highly recommend this movie. Infinitely Polar Bear is heartwarming, well acted, and has a good story line. Quite an in depth look into one family's life. No car chases...no violence.....no sitting on the edge of your seat moments. Just a great Friday feel good at home movie.",1452988800,2,277,4.791666666666667
7480100,3,B016UTP1MQ,"Semi-interesting at times, and a decent commentary on mental illness and struggles - but it's too plodding overall.

It's not great, but I might possibly recommend it under the right circumstances.",1452816000,,197,5.354838709677419
7480101,5,B016UTP1MQ,"I looked this up because I'm bipolar, and I admire Mark Ruffalo. It's a good, small family drama. Great star performances. I didn't really learn much about mental illness , but I liked the way the film shows a mentally ill person basically having a life. That's unusual.",1452729600,,270,4.645833333333333
7480102,5,B016UTP1MQ,"As the movie opens, Maggie Stuart is faced with a very tough decision.  Despite having married into one of the oldest and most venerated of Boston families, she and her children are living in poverty.  Her husband is bipolar and unable to hold down a job.  She applies to MBA programs at several prestigious universities but is accepted only by Columbia University in New York.  For the good of the family and her children's future, she decides to trust her mentally ill husband to look after the children during the week while she attends grad school in New York.

Thus begins this little gem of a film about what it means to be a family.  It is based on the childhood memories of the director, Maya Forbes.  Mark Ruffalo plays the father, Cam Stuart. Zoe Saldana is Maggie.  Both are excellent.  The daughters,  played by Imogene Wolodarsky (the director's actual daughter) and Ashley Aufderheide, are outstanding.

The film is humorous and heart-wrenching but always life affirming.  Even though there is a good bit of profanity, it is a worthwhile film for older children to see because it shows how even a wounded family can be a loving one.  And more importantly perhaps,  how children can thrive even in challenging situations.",1452384000,3,1234,4.814285714285714
7480103,4,B016UTP1MQ,"I gave this movie 4 stars because I adore Mark Ruffalo and every role (including this) that I have seen him in. and I think the younger daughter is an comedic actress beyond her years. I also enjoyed the story, which at times was very funny.
  But I do have two BIG criticisms. First,  I am not sure that the seriousness of bipolar disorder was accurately conveyed. I wonder why Ruffalo's character was always in some level of a manic state? I had a friend who was bipopolar, and he would suddenly have long spells of deep depression.
  The second criticism concerns the casting of the older daughter. I am sorry to say, but, despite her acting skills, this girl really stands out. In this film, she does not look anything like her parents. I  found this to be distracting.  This led me to wonder (as I have many times before), why would casting agents go out of their way to cast a not-so-attractive child in a role with movie star good-looking parents? Then, (as usual in these situations) I thought, ""Who are this kid's parents?"" This time, thanks to IMBD trivia and a quick online search, my suspicions were confirmed. The older daughter's mother is THE DIRECTOR and her father is a prominent director and producer!
  This movie is all about the relationship between father and daughters, and Miss Wallodarsky gave a fantastic performance that made me laugh many times. But when it is this noticeable, nepotism is not a good avenue for casting.",1452297600,,1448,4.647058823529412

Reminds me of ME! Kids and husband agree. They are allowed to laugh too because they live with, and put up with me!! Dad is Oscar material for sure. Watch this if you are bipolar and if you are not, then watch it with someone who is! OMG!!!

7480106,5,B016UTP1MQ,"This was a sweet movie that chronicled a period of time in a family where they had to choose how to deal with the reality of one member's mental illness, while moving forward with their own lives.  The details of the story are already explained in other paid reviews on this site, so I'll just say that I loved the message, and the way the movie doesn't sugarcoat things, but does keep a positive perspective.  I loved the way the husband and wife didn't become enemies, but still came from a place of love, while the struggle of the wife (and I'm sure it was very difficult) was still evident.  The way that the girls idolized their father (at first, with the buffer of their mother to keep things together) was tempered by the fact that daily life with him (and without her) was very different, but ultimately they still loved him and cared about him.  It was just a really touching film, and I enjoyed watching it.  Mark Ruffalo's performance was really good, as was Zoe Saldana's, and the two girls.  Heartwarming, sweet, but it kept it real.  I loved it.",1452038400,3,1059,4.484375
