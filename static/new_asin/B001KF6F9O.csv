8314903,5,B001KF6F9O,"This animated version of The Vixen is just about perfect.  At times, it is beautiful beyond belief: the dream sequence about the Vixen's mother and the forester's music at the end can cause tears of elation.  The music in the sequence when the Vixen meets the fox who will become her husband rivals any love music in  Puccini.  Though slightly abridged, this DVD  presents the essence of the opera in all its glory. In addition to being a musical delight, it is a profound statement about the human world and the world of nature, about life and death, about the power of sex and love, about the natural order of life and death and subsequent  generations repeating the process.  For those who already know Janacek and for those new to his music, this is a highly recommended: a superb achievement.",1471910400,,797,4.65
8314904,5,B001KF6F9O,"This is a beautiful work, carefully edited from the entire opera to fit into a DVD one hour product. The BBC production is flawless, witth superb soloists, clever cartoon designs and movements. I use this for my introduction to Opera with my Yr7 and Yr8 students in a Girls' school. They love it!",1362009600,,296,4.60377358490566
8314905,5,B001KF6F9O,"My 2-year-old daughter loves this video and being a classical music lover I was extremely excited to have the opportunity for her to be exposed to such quality music. There are a couple scenes when the fox kills the chickens and also when she gets shot that I fast-forward through, but otherwise she loves looking at all the animated animals and the music of course is wonderful. I'm hoping it will be something she will watch for many years to come and start the process of music appreciation.",1357084800,,494,4.625
