It begins with a flight of WW I biplanes flying over enemy lines. Anti-aircraft cannon and machine guns fire at them. One pilot wakes up in the hospital. Afterwards he walks until a horseman gives him a lift to town. Ted meets an old friend; Ted was reported killed one year ago.

Teds father is shocked to see him!

Ted wrote letters but the addressees never got them. They will start over. Ted meets Mary, the embrace. A crook reveals himself and shoots Teds father! Its a case of revenge for an old family feud. Kent worked in the local post office. Ten straps on a revolver. Kent hides the fathers body. But hes not dead! Ted reports his missing father to the Sheriff. Ted discovers the missing letters and tells the Sheriff. Will it be reported to the government? Ted calls Mary to tell about the letters found in Kents safe. Kent writes a note to Mary, his henchman will deliver the note in secret. Teds father tells who shot him and why! The doctor treats Teds father, hell be all right after resting.

Teds father has a plan to get a confession from Kent about his lost ranch. It works! But Kent jumps out a window to escape! Ted learns about Marys capture. Kent tells his henchman to get Ted. Slippery Gerns reveals his true identity to Mary and takes her away. Harrington tells the Sheriff about the planned bank robbery in town. They have a plan to catch Kents gang. There is a chase and shooting for action. They will take the old road and head them off at the pass. It works, but Kent has the money. Kent arrives at the shack, he notices the horse outside. Ted fights Ken with bare hands and wins. Later Teds father sees his ranch with cattle. Ted and Mary are together too.

This is an interesting and complex story that is different from the usual Western stories. Setting it after WW I made it relevant to the 1930s compared to setting it after the Civil War.",1507766400,,2221,4.331730769230769

8178838,4,B000NJWOAM,"Poverty Row Pictures presents ""LAST OF THE WARRENS"" (10 May 1936) (56 mins/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) -- Bob Steele was an American actor --- He was born Robert Adrian Bradbury in 1907 in Portland, Oregon, into a vaudeville family --- Bob's career began to take off for good in 1927, when he was hired by production company Film Booking Offices of America (FBO) to star in a series of Westerns. Bob--who was rechristened Bob Steele at FBO--soon made a name for himself, and in the late 1920s, 1930s and 1940s starred in B-Westerns for almost every minor film studio, including Monogram, Supreme, Tiffany, Syndicate, Republic (including several films of the Three Mesquiteers series) and Producers Releasing Corporation (PRC) (including the initial films of their ""Billy the Kid"" series)

In the late 1940s and early 1950s, that ""new medium"" television had many hours to fill and few dollars to fill them --- They re-discovered the B-Western, still a popular mainstay of Saturday afternoon matinees and many cowboy stars thrilled a new audience --- Taking advantage of this rebirth in popularity, publishers brought to the marketplace comic books featuring these western heroes of ""Bob Steele"" Westerns --- These bimonthly issues were copyrighted in February and April of 1950 by Fawcet Publications --- His career which included nearly 200 feature films, serials and TV appearances --- Steele in his twilight years at the age 59 when he got the part of the cantankerous ""Trooper Duffy"", in the western comedy series ""F Troop"" (1965), who at the drop of a hat would give his rendition of fighting ""shoulder to shoulder with Davy Crockett at the Alamo"" --- Steele retired from the screen in 1973 --- Bob's long career, spanning more than 50 years came to an end in 1988 when he passed away.

Under the production staff of:
Robert North Bradbury - Director / Screenwriter
A.W. Hackel - Producer
Bert Longenecker - Cinematographer
Roy S. Luby - Editor

Our story line and plot, our hero Ted Warren (Bob Steele) returns from WW1 to find that everyone thinks he was dead --- The culprit is Kent (Charle King) who intercepted his mail, rustled the Warren cattle, took over the Warren ranch, and is now after Ted's girl friend Mary Burns (Margaret Marquis) --- When Kent's henchmen fail to kill Ted, Kent shoots Ted's father and leaves him for dead --- But only wounded, the plan is to have Warren appear as a ghost to get a confession from Kent --- Last of the Warrens was written and directed by Steele's father Robert N. Bradbury --- Steele once again plays opposite one of my favorite badmen Charles King.
