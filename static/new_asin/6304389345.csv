7870276,3,6304389345,"SLEEPY EYES OF DEATH: SWORD OF ADVENTURE, 1964 (aka SHOWDOWN) is the 2nd entry in the Kyoshiro Nemuri/""Son of the Black Mass"" series of Japanese swordplay films about a wandering outcast red-haired swordsman whose mother was Japanese and whose father was a European missionary.
In this one, Nemuri meets a local Finance Commissioner who runs afoul of the Shogun's high-living daughter when he cuts off her allowance. Nemuri is impressed by the old man's integrity and saves his life, thus making himself a target of assassins. It's an interesting tale relating the delicate dilemmas faced by public officials in old Japan trying to maintain public order yet not offend powerful interests. However, it gets quite convoluted as it involves a growing cast of characters, including at least five men who want to kill Nemuri, all for varying reasons, including one who just wants to test his swordplay skill against Nemuri's ""Full Moon Cut"" technique. Unfortunately, there's surprisingly little action until the big fight at the end, where Nemuri takes on all of his opponents.
It's all very well acted and beautifully photographed in color and widescreen (showcased well in this sharp letter-boxed video transfer). It's a proficient work by director Kenji Misumi, whose later films, most notably the ""Lone Wolf and Cub"" series, are less polished and less formal, but leaner, bloodier and more action-packed and more memorable to fans of the genre.",988675200,2,1443,5.197424892703863
