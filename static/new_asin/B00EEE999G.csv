5909955,3,B00EEE999G,"An alien vs. earth film that doesn't take place in L. A. Two software developers go to Moscow to present their software only to discover the Russians already have an exact copy. Unfortunately the beginning and their talents don't factor later into the film. They meet a couple of other Americans at a nightclub and when it looks like they are going to score aliens attack the planet (story of my life).

These are not ordinary aliens. They are mostly invisible and like Predator seem to hunt by infrared. They kill humans and barking dogs using some kind of microwave beam that causes living things to explode (the cool part). Our focus group of 5 young adults hide in a large storage closet that has food.

Now what? Do you A) stay put until all the food is gone, then maybe venture out to get more food, hoping that the aliens have killed enough humans. And if captured all they would want to do is probe you?

or B) Try to find the US embassy so they can get you back home. Personally I would go with ""A"" because I know for a fact the US embassy does not have contingency plans for an alien invasion. Perhaps they need to advertise that more.

** mid point Plot SPOILER? but not ending**

Our group chose option ""B"". Later they discover the aliens can be killed with a ""Ghost Buster"" looking weapon and there is a Russian sub in the river awaiting survivors...but not for long. They meet people along the way. They gain a few and lose a few.

To be honest I got a bit bored during the alien hide and seek part. There were no monsters to see, so they saved a ton of money on make-up and special effects. I didn't feel much intensity. The acting was okay considering the lack of a script. They needed to add a little humor, maybe a love scene with an ""exploding"" ending.
Asylum dull.

2 f-bombs. No sex, or nudity. Some hip-hop song lyrics were suggestive.",1325980800,33,1857,4.3652173913043475
5909956,4,B00EEE999G,"The only exciting thing about this movie is seeing the hot actresses running around. I'd give 5/5 stars for that, less 1 star for the anti-climax. At the closing scene, I'm still left wondering if the aliens will ever be defeated. While it may be inferred that the aliens will meet their match sometime in the future, we've yet to see if the survivors will even make it safely to shore! I don't really like endings like this that leaves too much room for speculation.

There isn't enough action or suspense in this movie, just a handful of humans running around, trying to hide, and figuring out how to outwit alien invaders.",1325289600,21,625,4.580357142857143

5909963,3,B00EEE999G,"Logics new hip-hop album Bobby Tarentino II was recorded on March 9th, 2018, under the DEF Jam/ Ral Records label. This Album strays from his usual style of music that touches on controversial issues, like his biggest hit 1-800-273-8255, that addressed the issue of suicide. There are twelve songs on the album, not including the opening monologue called grandpas Spaceship, which features characters form the hit show Rick and Morty. We can hear the two arguing about whether to listen to logics classic emotional songs or his newer party music. Rick even says Im not in the mood for a message where I can be whatever I want. After the bantering between the two characters, the First song, Overnight, commences which is incredibly catchy. The lyrics resemble a lot of other popular hip-hop songs because he speaks about his endeavors as a rich and famous rapper, but the interesting part about this song as that he mentions maintaining his values on his journey to stardom. One line in the song says I treated people with respect and now Im rich, which I found to be honorable and set a great example for his listeners.
The sound quality is good in this album, but the songs all do have a very similar sound. The album could use a lot more diversity with beats, each songs beat has a similar rhythm and none of them have any particularly catchy hooks or interludes, which is quite disappointing. His lyrics are heavily centered around his hard work and success, which is worth rapping about, but can get boring after the 10th song. He mentions being married in a lot of his music, which is one aspect of the album that differs greatly from other popular hip-hop, but is one of the few things in this album that bank off of Logics identity.
The most popular songs on the Album are Overnight, Contra, Midnight, Indica Blue. The thing these songs have in common is one catchy line that is repeated throughout the song or the chorus, for example Bitch Ive been blowing up, in Contra. This seems to be a common theme in a lot of popular hip-hop music, so Logic may have been using this formula in an attempt to create a more generic sound that separates him from his stereotypical sound.
The song Everyday resonated with me because its lyrics were empowering and slightly more positive than the rest of the songs. The tone for he majority of the album was relatively dark throughout the album, and adding a few lighter-sounding songs could have benefited the popularity of this album. The consistent feeling I got while listening was rather negative and would be something Id listen to while I am sad, rather than something Id listen to out of sheer enjoyment. Logic uses a lot of minor pitches rather than major pitches, which added to the dark sound of the album. In my opinion, adding some major pitches and happier sounding beats could have benefitted the album as a whole.
The album features 2 Chains, Big Sean, Young Sinatra and Whiz Kalifa, all of whom are incredible artists. Adding these rappers definitely helped the albums popularity and quality by including some diversity. This might have had some negative effects on the album as well, because it made the songs stray farther from Logics identity that people love so much.
This recording was overall enjoyable, but lacked a lot of the uniqueness that makes Logics music so special. Many of these songs seemed mildly forced because of their simplicity and the similarity within a lot of the songs. Each of the songs discuss his journey and success, which is a bit tedious. Most of the music is good quality, and as someone that writes his own music it is worth nothing that each song probably did take a long time to put together. These songs are heavily rap-centered, creating a more rhythmic timber rather than melodic, which in my opinion lessened the quality of the songs as a whole.
The album started out on a great note but quickly became boring towards the end. I think the decision to try and rebrand himself may have been to obvious within his music, being less effective in turn. The lyrics were impressive at times, but straying too far from his controversial musical style made him seem distant and gave him a weaker identity. I admire logics choice to change up his style, but I believe the quality of his music suffered in his decision to do so.",1521417600,,4318,4.675427069645203

The Darkest Hour may not have had a blockbuster budget,  but it puts what it has to great use.  I didn't expect near as much as I got.  Compared to most of the SyFy movies this is far more thrilling and re-watchable. Great story, directing, casting, acting, F/X, locations, sound, and music.  Be sure to catch this gem.

A group of tourist visiting Moscow have to use their wits to survive when an alien invasion wipes out most of the city. As they try to stay hidden they meet other survivors and try to find a way out of the city.  One such survivor they meet gives them hope with a discovery of an alien weakness.

5910131,3,B00EEE999G,"Mankind faces an unusual and intriguing alien threat, in The Darkest Hour (2010), a film that features some often impressive special effects.  Set in Russia, and centered on the activities of a group of young adults, the situation may be dire, but the tone of this adventure seems to have a light Disney type flavor.

Americans Sean (Emile Hirsch,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lone-Survivor/dp/B00HEPEBWC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lone Survivor</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Girl-Next-Door/dp/B0029XFN8A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Girl Next Door</a>) and Ben (Max Minghella), come to Moscow on business, and learn that they have been cheated by their associate Skyler (Joel Kinnaman,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robocop/dp/B00JL6L4WC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robocop</a>).  All three are in a night club when an alien invasion occurs, and they become trapped with tourists Natalie (Olivia Thirlby,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dredd/dp/B005LAII80/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dredd</a>) and Anne (Rachael Taylor,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Transformers/dp/B000NTPDT6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Transformers</a>).  The group later emerges to find that most of the population has been wiped out by the aliens, who continue to roam the city, disintegrating any living creatures they find.

Shot in Moscow, the various Russian locations in featured in the film are a high point, as are most of the special effects related to the aliens, which include some cool and often unexpected deaths.  While the movie looks slick and is quite entertaining, the story aims at rather juvenile level, and mostly eliminates the inclusion of local population.  When some Russian rebels are finally encountered, they become very convenient allies to the survivors.

The opportunity to shoot in Russia isn't completely squandered, and some of the elements work well, but The Darkest Hours had the potential to be much more.  Taking a decidedly ""western"" slant, and with some cartoonish elements, the film is a fun watch, if your expectations are not particularly lofty, and the talented cast of rising stars, has gone on to bigger projects.",1402185600,,2358,7.0479452054794525

The special effects are mediocre at best, the actors have all the charisma of a bowl of oatmeal, with none of the acting talent, and all tension is repeatedly resolved at every turn through deus ex machina.

5910159,3,B00EEE999G,"As a lifetime fan of science fiction movies and books, I picked up this DVD (The Darkest Hour) at a bargain price.  However, I should have been more suspicious because I did not recognize any of the actors in this film.  Nevertheless, I did film interesting at times.  This movie revolves around five young people who are visiting Moscow when an attack comes from aliens.  These invaders are unique in that they are electrical creatures who completely destroy anything they touch.  Unlike good science fiction movies, which I love viewing over and over, once is quite enough for this film.

In conclusion, if you like science fiction movies like Cloverfield you may want to check out this film, but just keep in mind that it is no Star Wars or Star Trek.

personally, it doesn't get much better than that
pretty cut and dry plot, mysterious aliens show up intent on raping our planet for resources, average joes, and jane's must survive, and figure out a way to beat them. kinda like independence day in a way, but from the street level. the devil is in the details on this one though. although a couple of the characters are tired old stereotypes (aka crazy russian scientist) most of the characters are surprisingly well developed. it's not winnin any oscars anytime soon, but once again, if you've read any of my reviews before,  excellent way to kill a couple hours with your girlfriend when she's buggin you to spend some time with her and watch a movie.",1383523200,,733,4.638461538461539

And that is what TDH is.  Characters you barely care about, if at all, trying to survive an alien invasion, in Moscow.  For what it is, it is a solid film, because I didn't go into it expecting much in the way of thinking.  I must admit the alien concept is creative.  Invisible balls of death that uses light tentacles to grab you and gives off enough electricity to light up nearby light bulbs, or car alarms.  The CGI work with the baddies alone makes watching worth it.  They did extremely well with the aliens and how they interacted with environment and their prey.  I did not appreciate how they approach the ""alien sight"" moments, where you see what/how the aliens see.  Seemed ill-fitting in such a film.

5910170,4,B00EEE999G,"This is just a no-brain fun, ""people in peril"" kind of movie. I end up watching it whenever it is on cable.  Good mindless fun!
The premise is that some alien life in the form of energy-absorbing creatures land in Russia and seem to enjoy killing people (presumably to absorb our energy). Two young American businessmen had just landed in Russia and are the lead characters, along with two beautiful girls. The action centers around trying to avoid the creatures while finding their way out of Russia. The humans finally discover that they can tell when the creatures are near because anything electrical will turn on (such as a car's headlights or streetlights). Otherwise, they are almost completely invisible.
It was actually good enough that I've watched it twice when it was on cable. Decent-to-Good acting really helps this movie. There is enough action and character sympathy to keep your interest in the movie. This, and a bowl of popcorn, would be fun with a friend.",1374883200,,975,4.873493975903615

I bought this movie for a couple bucks to satisfy my own curiosity.  I really wasn't missing much.  The story development just kind of speeds right along without much deliberation.  The characters were able to figure out quite a bit about these alien creatures that nobody knew anything about, in a pretty short period of time.  Also, it's sooooo convenient that apparently, EVERYBODY in Russia speaks fluent English, especially the electrical engineer who has already managed to build a weapon that these creatures are vulnerable to, unlike bullets.  Otherwise, it would have been a lot tougher to communicate with so many foreign strangers.

Like most alien movies, this one just falls apart towards the end.  Perhaps it's harder to write a sci-fi story that's not completely ridiculous, than I had previously thought.",1373760000,,967,5.0

5910177,3,B00EEE999G,"I really don't get the visceral reaction to this film by so many - precisely *because* it's a standard sci-fi apocalypse pic.  I hear no such groans over the studio-produced tropes of the SyFy Channel, yet somehow this particular film ""fails"" for following the same trajectory. It's a potboiler plot with the standard clique of characters in a survivalist struggle of the quickest. The special effects were interesting, if not of blockbuster quality.  The ""unseen alien"" is an old low-budget gimmick, but as they go this one *was* creative. There are certain Russian touches: the urban partisans holding out a la Stalingrad, fighting for the Motherland, etc. I suspect one reason the film is ""offensive"" is precisely due to this, while the ability to film a standard sci-fi in a world urban center with such cooperation made a convincing stage normally lacking in Hollywood efforts.

One reviewer took its producers to task because at one point the aliens could crack glass, while at another they were blinded by it. This all depends on the force of the electromagnetic wave, hence the ability of Sergei's Farraday cage to deflect individual alien predators.  All in all not bad for the buck. Its unique  features in an English-speaking production - the Muscovite landscape and characterization - seem to have made it ""truly alien"" for some viewers in their over-reaction to this one.",1370649600,3,1384,5.026200873362446

It's perfectly terrifying in parts and not only uplifting but inspiring in others. The acting seems completely natural to all parties involved and the special effects are amazing.

The plotline is pretty simple, a group of survivors in the wake of an invisible electricity alien invasion are making their way across Moscow in hopes of getting to a submarine that has other survivors. They have to rely on stealth, wits and a ridiculous amount of courage to get across the landscape that's filled with seemingly invincible and almost completely invisible aliens.

This movie was such an insane amount of fun to watch that I almost watched it immediately again after it ended. It's perfect to watch by yourself or with a group of friends.

5910192,3,B00EEE999G,"The Darkest Hour is your standard alien invasion fair we've become accustomed to seeing. Aliens descend to earth and we go along with the survivors as they deal with the threat.
The first third of the movie is great,as well as the final act. I think what holds this film back is the middle mark which is mostly filler that might draw a few yawns.
For some reason The Darkest Hour seems to have this strange combination of placing a Final Destination cast with what almost (I dare say) looks like Ghostbuster technology,but it works very well. The Russian landscape is great for this type of film and it really shines in 3D. Which leads me to the next point.............

The 3D here is pretty solid. Theirs only one really good ""pop"" out effect but the 3D depth is fantastic and really adds to the experience here. If you have the chance to watch The Darkest Hour in 3D I highly recommend it.

Another great thing about this Bluray is the added special feature, entitled ""Survivors"" which shows us the worldwide impact of the alien invasion. The Japanese are broadcasting how to defeat the alien threat and we are also shown  US soldiers fighting alongside Taliban resistance in Afghanistan against the off world threat. That's pretty neat if you ask me. The Survivors feature last about 10 minutes in total but adds quiet a bit to the depth of the main film.

In conclusion The Darkest Hour is nothing special,but it's a decent ride with a good cast. It's worth a rental and worth keeping around in a 3D library.",1361664000,2,1513,4.592592592592593

This time the story is set in Moscow, where five young people including two Americans, Sean (Emile Hirsch) and Ben (Max Minghella), struggle to survive after the massive attack from the invisible aliens. Co-produced by Timur Bekmambetov known for ""Night Watch"" and ""Wanted,"" ""The Darkest Hour"" has at least one good thing about it: its location. Watching the streets of Moscow in a sci-fi movie is a refreshing experience, even though the film itself is a generic and uninspired one.

I said ""Massive attack,"" but don't expect eye-popping special effects of ""Independence Day"" or Steven Spielberg-directed ""War of the Worlds."" Made with $ 30 million, ""The Darkest Hour"" is a comparatively low-budget sci-fi thriller with modest special effects. What is disappointing is the film's run-of-the-mill survival story and flat characters we don't care.

After the initial alien attack, the story quickly loses momentum and gets dull, eventually turning into nonsense. And I enjoy watching Roland Emmerich's sci-fi action movies, whose stories are often incredibly silly (Godzilla hiding in New York City, etc.), but never boring. With badly executed ideas (that seem to have been borrowed from somewhere else), ""The Darkest Hour"" is after all an unexciting and unoriginal sci-fi film.",1360195200,,1312,5.364077669902913

It is as movies should be--very entertainig. The budget must have been low which only proves that even with minimal budget a good and entertaining movie can still be made. Disclaimer: I never review movies and I always try to keep what I say at the level of I liked or disliked it. Renting this movie will not be a waste of time if you admire that actors can bring alive an almost totally CGI rendered world destroyed by an alien invasion. Thus, what I am saying is this: enjoy the craft of actors as they bring to life a completely imaginary world very convincingly. It is an action movie with little time wasted on exploring human reaction to a destroyed world. In my opinion the human reaction part of post apocalyptic movies rarely stikes true because who really knows what post apocalyptic human reaction would be. I especially object to post apocalyptic movies which paint mankind in stark black and white--good versus evil--contrast. What people might do to survive is the only element which rings true anything else is questionable. Bottomline: I liked this movie, finding it entertaining.

5910235,2,B00EEE999G,"I like B-movies, I like Sci-Fi B-movies and I even generally like the not-so-good Sci-Fi B-movies (I actually rated ""Skyline"" three stars) - but this thing was too much even for me. As one of the precedent reviewers very accurately noticed, this is basically a perfectly useless and less succesful remake of ""Skyline"", just with a lesser budget and without US Air Force vs. alien bionic fighters moments. This review contains limited SPOILERS.

The general idea of the film was pretty good - let's throw a handful of young Americans in the middle of an alien invasion, but instead of an US location (New York, Los Angeles, Hawaii, as those are the places usually invaded by extraterrestrial villains) let's place them in Moscow! It could have been such a great and full of humor film, but the whole idea was COMPLETELY wasted by the archi-idiotic scenario. Do not expect any humor or smart dialogs and the very limited action scenes are pathetic. Every time anybody seems to have a potential to do or say something interesting he/she is immediately eradicated.

The reasons for which I still give this film two stars, are following:

- there is aproximately 10-12 minutes which are watchable - but just so we are clear it is BEFORE the alien invasion begins...
- even if all actors were completely unknown to me and even if after watching their ""performance"" I believe they should remain so, all the girls were still very cute...
- there is one smart one-liner at the very beginning and another one at the very end of the film
- this is the first Sci-Fi film ever in which I saw humans engage alien invaders with cavalry and Molotov cocktails made from vodka...)))
- last but not least, there is a kind of an ""alternate geography"" lesson in this film (it concerns the Moskova river) which made me laugh like a hysterically drunk hyena - although I am certain that such was not the intention of the scenarist...

So all in all, this film is a huge failure, only watchable if we consider it as a kind of stupid joke - but it will work only after ingestion of a huge quantity of beer. Otherwise, avoid it if possible...",1353283200,,2116,4.61968085106383
5910236,2,B00EEE999G,"Emile Hirsch, what happened to you?  You're playing a douchy wannabe software entrepreneur whose best lines involve flirting with a flight attendant over airplane-cell phone propaganda.  We're only a few minutes into this movie and I already finding myself disliking your protagonist.  I've seen you quiet and soulful in Into the Wild (2007), humorously innocent in the amazing The Girl Next Door (2004), credibly authoritative in Alpha Dog (2006)...and now this?  Did you lose a bet or just piss off one too many directors with vegan, gluten-free, organic catering demands?  Simply accepting this role and this script was a failure before the cameras even started rolling.  We'll call this strike one.

Anyway, this software designer and his partner are on a business trip to Moscow to market a social networking app for navigating the club circuit in any major city in the world.  [Why did they need to go to Moscow for this?  Because it was cheaper to film the movie there.]  Hirsch plays the more laid back, carefree partner who is always telling his business-oriented friend to relax.  Not even ten minutes into this flick they are double-crossed by a third party and ousted out of their own deal.  This really deviates from the standard formula.  The Hostel series, The Chernobyl Diaries, Wrong Turn, Wolf Creek and The Cabin in the Woods rely more simply on a group of friends going on a vacation.  It's simple but it works.  You never find yourself saying ""what's the point in them being in Moscow for this business deal"" and the movie's credibility is maintained until the real fun starts when the players begin to drop one by one to whatever the random malevolent force the writers dreamed up.  That's strike two.

So our boys go out clubbing to drink away their failed business venture and meet up with two cuties.  They seem to get along when suddenly there's a world-scale power outage and countless energy-based life forms fall from the sky like snow-flaky embers aglow with Tinkerbell's fairy dust.  They start incinerating people like vampires to Blade's silver katana, people start running and screaming, and we're only fifteen minutes into the movie.  Well, at least we didn't have to suffer through the business deal plot any more.

As people scream and turn into aerosol compost our heroes, now numbering five with the addition of the shark who screwed them over on their app idea,  hide in a restaurant store room. A week after the invisible, incinerating invasion began, they emerge to go to the US Embassy...because they wouldn't have been charred, right?  Oh, and the slick douchebag has turned into an annoying high strung coward.  Those characters are so annoying and they never get killed off as fast as you'd like.

The streets of Moscow have turned into an I Am Legend, soulless dust bowl of abandoned cars and ghostly edifices.  Hirsch leads the way as they remain ever vigilant.  Because these energy-based aliens activate electronic devices (i.e., lights) when they are present, our heroes learn to travel when it's safest: night.

At one point Hirsch avoids detection by standing perfectly still as the creature just strolled by unaware on the other side of a window.  Considering that these things see lifeforms like glowing fireballs of infrared, making them extremely obvious, I think that moment of idiocy makes for strike three.  They can't see through glass or metal cages?  Whatever!  Now I have to watch these idiots walking around like glass shield-bearing knights.  Just stupid!
Along the way their group grows by two, one of which is an annoying Russian girl with such memorable lines as ""It's okay, I'm tough"" and ""I am not a kid!""  Barf!  I hope she dies next.  But luckily the other addition, a wacked out electrician, invented a Ghostbusters microwave gun to combat our electric invaders.

I guess the effects were tolerable.  But how many times can you entertain me with people getting jerked into the air for a second and then getting turned to spiraling cinders by some invisible dust devil alien?  They shatter glass and detonate doors--boring.  After they disintegrated the first few people and a dog the kills got boring.  Our heroes start freaking out every time a breeze kicks up some debris and then the ""dumb"" really hits the fan.  They meet dumber tough-talking characters who fight the aliens in dumb ways wearing dumb outfits amid ridiculously dumb scenarios and give dumb speeches about preserving every human life they can.  Just truckloads and truckloads of dumb!  Oh, and eventually you get to see these aliens and, you guessed it, they look dumb!  The worst effects in the movie were dedicated to showing us what the aliens truly look like without their invisibility shield--they look like some weird floating head monster from Doom.  It's most upsettingly dumb when Hirsch kills an alien by throwing a charred piece of another dead alien at it.  One throw?  Really?  Climax-fail!  Sorry, we're out of strikes.

In the end I wished everyone died.  The quality of this movie actually decreased as the running time wore on and, accordingly, I turned on the characters more and more with every passing scene.  I won't say skip this movie.  But if you choose to watch it, watch and mock it with friends.",1351468800,,5265,4.909297052154195

This was not meant to be an ultra action film. More of a ""what if..."".
The effects are good, acting is good. Plot is plausible, in the situation as it was presented.
The Science behind the sci-fi was equally good. Electric fields and Faraday cages are plausable as well.

I can't say I enjoyed the movie right from beginning and here's why. While the plot is simple, the beginning looks too much like typical american movies. I couldn't get rid of that feeling through the whole movie. I know the movie was ALSO meant for English speaking audience, but I would love to hear less or no English. It would make the movie much different in my opinion. I think of Korean, Chinese or Japanese movies that I see with subtitles and still enjoy. They either have little or no English and it proves that they can still be very enjoyable. I've seen American actors right from the beginning 'til the very end of the movie. What's new? They are pretty much like other american young actors I've seen. Some are good, some are bad, those from ''the darkest hour'' are pretty much like the rest. There are a few likable characters, and guess what? I think those were ''soldiers''/defenders of the city. Electrician with his cat is a funny type of guy, likable character as well. Another good thing about the movie is that beside of that ''business guy'' who spoke Russian with an accent, the rest spoke real Russian. Unlike MANY american movies, where Russian is actually spoken by Czechs, Ukraininans, Estonian people, etc. It's a fact that many can't see or hear any difference. I was glad to see something new in ''the darkest hour''. Overall, graphics and the city in this movie like everything else, look good. I still wish that half of the movie had no typical american beginning. I've seen it all, I've seen too much of it. Last  but not least, the trailer for the movie is worse than an actual movie.

As has been pointed out, the movie follows the adventures of four young people who are visiting Moscow, Russia for assorted reasons.

Their agendas are violently disrupted when aliens attack several major cities on earth including Moscow. From then on it becomes the story of just trying to stay alive while all around you are dying. The special effects are fairly good and there are some clever plot twists as the story develops. I was amused by the early warning devices they created and started wearing to warm them of the approach of the invisible aliens.

One thing I can say about the movie is it did provide some degree of resolution and left the viewer with hope that humanity might still survive. This is likely a film only the sci-fi buff will tolerate and I can't say for sure how many times they will want to see it more than once.

5910265,4,B00EEE999G,"A novel twist on the alien invasion trope.  Spoiler alert: It doesn't break out of the boilerplate arithmetic of survival/horror movies, wherein new characters can only exist for a short period before the character list gets trimmed down again to a comfortable number.  This leads to scenes of avoidable death after improbable survival.  However, I felt it created a true sense of post-apocalypse and the absolute devastation that would be wrought if spacefaring aliens decided to invade.  The plot was suspenseful and characters were likable and more fully realized than a collection of tropes.  It didn't really impinge on my enjoyment of the film that (a) aliens would be able to find lots of metal-rich spacerocks without travelling to an inhabited planet (unless they need oxygen for their machines or something) and (b) Given the aliens are engaged in planetary core mining (and spacetravel, of course), it doesn't seem likely that a few hundred survivors in each city would be able to dampen the aliens' operations on earth, even after we find out ways to survive.

5910277,3,B00EEE999G,"When a movie receives this many middling to negative reviews, curiosity gets the better of me and I just have to see for myself how bad it is.

It was obvious at the outset what was wrong with this movie, a decided lack of conviction on everyone's part.  The actors didn't seem to believe in their roles and gave lack luster performances.  The dialog was painfully witless.  The circumstances involved were all rushed, checked off like a to-do list.  The aliens were less than awe-inspiring.  The special effects were few and far between and limited in scope.  Everything was so distant, including every shot in the film.  Did someone fail to remember that close-ups serve the purpose of drawing us in; distant shots put everything out of reach?  If even only one ""kill"" shot was done with a close-up, there might have been a better sense of the brutality involved.  We'd at least see an expression on a face instead of a few nameless people literally being snuffed out of existence.  The deaths were all remote and removed, most done off-screen.  People weren't kept around long enough so few personalities stood out, which meant that no deaths were mourned.  I forgot everyone's name within minutes.  Nothing in this film mattered, that's the point they were missing.  They made that plain from the instant those two idiots walked into a boardroom and failed to confront the guy who stole their idea.  ""You stole our idea?  Oh, okay, whatever, let's go to a club.""  And even when the thief shows up at the very same club (there must be only one in all of Moscow), they still failed to hash out their grievances.  No swearing, no coming to blows, instead, they all trooped outside to watch the pretty lights!
No sense of urgency, no sense of awe, no suspense, no horror, no thrills; everything was handled in a perfunctory manner.  It ended with a whimper rather than the stirring battle cry it required.  Even the score was plain and unmemorable!

It takes an awful lot of incompetence to screw up an intriguing concept like this one had going for it.

Unfortunately for them, the idea is stolen (poor Max, two movies in a row) and the characters have a very bad start to their weekend in Moscow. Well, problems arisew when an alien species descends like electrical impulses from the sky. Playful fireflies the size of your head float down innocuously... until they start zapping randomly and turning people into confetti.

More character driven than anything, The Darkest Hour presents likeable, relatable characters in the face of danger. The unseen is more terrifying, and, like The Mist, nearly undetectable movements from something meaning to kill you - particularly when accompanied by a creepy childlike giggle - are absolutely frightening.

Special Effects for this film are obviously superb. Scene design as well. Seeing a crashed jet inside a Moscow mall is a complete gut-bomb, a wonderful precursor for foreboding post-apocalypse existence. Although, the surrounding scenery of Moscow - if it was really Moscow - could have been filmed a little less obviously; it's as if the filming followed a Fodor's guide to Moscow.

The problem with this movie is the Swiss cheese script and Deus Ex Machina. The aliens can destroy entire buildings, but can't break through glass or penetrate a Faraday Cage? Really?! The aliens can't go over water, even though they have clearly mastered the art of flight? (This just in, they came from outer-space) The fact that Hirsch is just a nobody who gets saved, but the movie ends with him acting like a pseudo-John Connor who wore his daddy's BDUs and pretended to play soldier for a day.

I enjoyed the movie somewhat, but mostly when shutting my mind off. The script is far too easy to pick apart if one were so inclined.

If I may be allowed to add a crowning failure to trump them all, it would be that the audience does not care about the characters at all.

5910299,4,B00EEE999G,"NOTE: THIS CONTAINS NO SPOILERS!

I really liked ""The Darkest Hour.""  In fact, I am surprised at the number of negative reviews here on this site.  While I do not feel it was a five-star movie, I do feel this movie did exactly what it had to, as well as it could.

To be honest, when I first heard that an aliens-invade-the-earth movie was going to involve two American ""aliens""--that is, two Americans visiting Moscow on a business deal--I found the notion intriguing but not compelling.  I mean, why Moscow, right?

But the movie takes off very quickly.  Once Ben and Sean, the two Americans, are double-crossed by their Russian ""partner"" Skyler, several things are set in motion: their two personalities are clarified in crisis, they have a need to go out and burn off steam (and meet Natalie and Ann), and the audience is ensured that Skyler's gonna die.

All of that takes no more than five to ten minutes of screen time.  And when the aliens do arrive, they do so in noteworthy fashion: as little Aurora Boreali that drift to the streets.  As it has been typical of aliens ever since ""War of the Worlds"" did it on the radio 70 plus years ago, the intruders somehow zap! people into nothingness.  It isn't until sometime later we begin to understand how (through some kind of electrical disintegration).

And, as we find out after the five of them spend an unspecified number of days hiding in a food storage room, there are apparently precious few human beings on the planet left alive.

What really made this film enjoyable was the clever use of its characters, particularly Sean, played by Emile Hirsch.  I hesitate to use the word ""plucky"" except it describes him to a T: resourceful, creative, resilient, he becomes the backbone of not only their twosome, but also the film.  I found Hirsch to bear a resemblance to a more cheerful ""Bourne"" as he noodles his way through situations that are making others crumble.

Indeed, this characteristic is echoed throughout the movie, a thing we are fond of calling The American  Spirit, but its appearance in this movie proves it does not belong to us alone.  A likewise spirit among surviving Moscovites helps prove human tenacity is a worldwide human characteristic.  Not that everyone has it--and this film doesn't mind killing off its central characters, mind you--but those that do are like little islands within the desolate streets of a ruined city...and, we suppose, world.

I loved ""The Darkest Hour.""  I thought it did what good sci-fi movies without a blockbluster cast or budget do: package its product with good, clever special effects, but never forget it is character and story that drive a movie.  Emile Hirsch and the rest of the cast (Olivia Thirlby, Rachael Taylor and Max Minghella, among others) created compelling personalities who were always interesting.

Credit also goes to the special effects team for not only dreaming up a clever representation of a menacing alien presence, but also for giving its characters interesting ways of dealing with it as well.  The film never feels stale, never drags, never becomes unbelievable.

And the proof of the fact is that, given the fact that we are left in the perfect position for a sequel, it is one I definitely want to see.",1337385600,20,3246,4.784560143626571

Then the aliens start floating down to Earth, at times they glow orange, but they are mostly invisible to the human eye. These aliens are not interested in communication, they simply want to eliminate humans from the planet so that they can harvest the Earth's resources. This is a decent adventure story. Some of the special effects are interesting, for example, when we get to see the alien's perspective. It has a decent amount of action. Due to its larger budget, it is slightly better than a SyFy prime time apocalypse movie, but the acting and plot is mediocre at best. Don't expect The Darkest Hour to blow your mind, but it will serve as entertainment if you have a couple of hours to kill and nothing good is on tv.",1337126400,,932,4.520710059171598
5910307,1,B00EEE999G,This movie was terrible!! So predictable. It could have been such a good concept too. Very disappointing. Save your money and skip this one.,1337126400,,140,4.875
5910308,3,B00EEE999G,"Forget the cowboys/alien movie, this one offers more entertainment. THE DARKEST HOUR begins with two young inventor/businessmen traveling to Russia to make a deal for the newest internet craze they've come up with, a hook up site that offers directions to the hottest nightclubs and more for anyone joining. Unfortunately their idea was stolen by their Russian partner, Skyler (Joel Kinnaman) and they've been tossed aside. After traveling halfway around the world to find a failed business adventure what do they do? What all twenty somethings do, head to the local clubs to hook up!

Ben (Max Minghella) is the smart one who came up with the program while Sean (Emile Hirsch) is the one with the supposed business savvy that got them there. Having used the program earlier in the day they're at the hottest spot and hoping to meet two fellow Americans, Natalie (Olivia Thirlby) and her friend Anne (Rachel Taylor). While partying hard a noise outside drives the crowd to the doors to see what the commotion was. They discover what they first think is a lightshow in the sky. In reality it's an invasion of aliens hurtling to the Earth.

The first encounter they all witness is a policeman walking up to a fluctuating, glowing mass that looks like a holographic image floating in the street. When he pokes it, the alien wraps around him and disintegrates the policeman before the eyes of the crowd who immediately panic and begin seeking shelter. As they run various members of the scene are disintegrated one by one and our heroes only escape with luck by hiding in the backroom of the club. Along with them and necessary to help them translate is none other than Skyler.

After several days they travel out to see what has happened. It's basically the end of the world as we know it with no one in sight. They learn how to tell if the aliens are nearby since the energy that flows from these creatures brings light bulbs to full glow. Using this method they travel the city in hopes of finding other survivors and to see what's happened.

They do find others and join with them in hopes of finding help. A radio signal lets them all know that a Russian sub will be located in a pier on one of the main rivers running through Moscow but only till a certain time. It seems the aliens can't see through the water or through glass which reflects light. They head out encountering other survivors fighting back and taking the chance of being picked off one by one before they can make it to the sub.

The movie does have a rather simplistic plot at use here but it works. This is a classic sci-fi low budget flick produced with a much larger budget and a bit of creativity. The concept used for the aliens is cost effective yet works, giving us something we haven't seen before. As the heroes find a way to somewhat short circuit the alien's force fields we get a crude glimpse of them and don't have the need to see more.

But its not just sci-fi being used here. While I watched I thought back to films like RED DAWN (amusing since this film takes place in Russia) where we had a group of teens trying to take on an enemy far advanced than they are at that age. The combination of sci-fi and action make this film work.

Perhaps what made this movie more interesting yet for me was the fact that it was actually shot in Russia, something that would have been unheard of 10-20 years ago. Times have definitely changed, but movie perhaps not as much. The locations take center stage much of the time as we get a glimpse of a country we've not been privy to for long. And after the history the U.S. and Russia have shared, it's also nice to see characters from both countries uniting to take on a common enemy.

Don't get me wrong, this film is not an Oscar contender but it doesn't pretend to be that either. It is what it is, a simple sci-fi film that tells a story and tries to get us involved with characters in the shortest amount of time possible. This is Roger Corman with the chance to play in the big boy's sandbox and it offers a nice evening's entertainment.",1336953600,,4066,4.485135135135135

5910314,3,B00EEE999G,"The United States is known for creating their fair share of alien invasion films but this time around, with producer and filmmaker Timur Bekmambetov (""Wanted"", ""Night Watch"", ""Day Watch"", ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"") involved, his goal was to create a Russian alien invasion film through a perspective by Russians.

But to make it a global film and with only a budget of $30 million, Bekmabetov would enlist Chris Gorak (art director for films such as ""Minority Report"", ""Fight Club"", ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"") to direct and Scott Kevan (""Underworld: Awakening"", ""The Losers"", ""Fame"") as cinematographer and the film woud utilize Bekmabetov's studio and filming would take place in Moscow.

The film would star American talent Emile Hirsch (""Milk"", ""Into the Wild"", ""Speed Racer""), Olivia Thirlby (""The Wackness"", ""Juno"", ""No Strings Attached""), Max Minghella (""The Social Network"", ""The Ides of March""), Rachael Taylor (""Transformers"", ""Shutter"", ""Bottle Shock""), Joel Kinnaman (""The Killing"", ""Easy Money"", ""Safe House"") and Russian talents Veronika Ozerova and Dato Bakhtadze (""Wanted"", ""Crash"").

""The Darkest Hour"" would earn $64 million in the box office and is now available on 3D Blu-ray, Blu-ray and DVD.

VIDEO:

""The Darkest Hour"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  The cinematography definitely showcases the beautiful structures of Moscow, there is a good amount of detail when it comes to structures, clothing and because of the CG extra-terrestrials emitting this glowing orange, there are times of beautiful vibrant colors and for the most part, a good balance of digital cinematography with CG effects.

Black levels are nice and deep, skin tones look natural and I did not detect any banding or artifacts during my viewing of the film.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""The Darkest Hour"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and Espanol Dolby Digital 5.1.  When it comes to audio, although this is not directed by Timur Bekmambetov, because it was produced by him, you expect a lot of action scenes and immersive audio.

The film utilizes the surround channels and LFE throughout the film, may it be the music and its bass, the sounds of disintegration courtesy of the aliens or even the many machine guns or shots at the aliens to the collapse of structures, the biggest positive of this film will be its lossless audio track.

Subtitles are presented in English SDH and Espanol.

SPECIAL FEATURES

""The Darkest Hour"" comes with the following special features:

  Survivors - (8:10) A short film showcasing survivors from different countries using radio broadcasts from Tokyo in destroying the aliens.
  The Darkest Hour: Visualizing an Invasion - (12:09) A featurette about the visual effects of ""The Darkest Hour"".
  Deleted and Extended Scenes - (4:48) Six deleted and extended scenes with optional commentary by director Chris Gorak.
  Audio Commentary - Director Chris Gorak talks about the cast, shooting in Moscow, using CG the challenges involved in the making of the film due to the Russian Wildfires of 2010.

EXTRAS:

""The Darkest Hour: Special Edition"" comes with a slipcover.

JUDGMENT CALL:

As a sci-fi fan, especially fan of alien infestation films, there have been films that captures the horror of an alien infestation, may it be the 1996 film ""Independence Day"" or the 2011 film ""Battle: Los Angeles"", part of the reason why these films succeed is the use of star power and a large budget dedicated to the films visual effects.

While there are alien infestation films that have been shot in a low budget and without star power such as the exciting 2011 UK film ""Attack the Block"", at least the pacing of the film was consistent, it was funny and it was going somewhere.

Unfortunately, ""The Darkest Hour"" doesn't seem to be going anywhere and the characters don't grab you at all.

Part of the challenge that filmmaker Chris Gorak and Timur Bekmambelov had when making this film were scheduling delays (due to the Russian Wildfires), a budget of $30 million and the lack of major star power.  While Emile Hirsch has received attention for his roles in ""Milk"" and ""Into the Wild"", unlike American alien infestation films with American bravado, this Russian film focused on survival of weak Americans who survived thanks to the Russian people.

The film is supposed to be a Russian perspective, a Russian version of an alien infestation film and while I didn't mind the weakness and whining of the American characters, the film had forced dialogue that made things seem too unnatural and thus produced spotty acting.

But where the screenplay fails the viewer is that the storyline and its characters are not really going anywhere.  It's a survival film that seems more like ""Cloverfield""-Lite and because the characters are not so captivating, you just wonder to yourself of ""how they will die?"".

There are also some problematic issues such as a blast that throws Sean and Natalie, who were standing next to each other, could have kept everyone within the same vicinity but for Natalie, somehow she has ended a half mile away.  There are scenes that showcase the relationship between Natalie and Anne and why they went to Moscow.  There are times you think the two are hiding something but yet nothing is ever mentioned.

Where the film does work well in a Russian perspective is showcasing the beautiful structures of Moscow, showing the CG devastation of Moscow, showing Russian heroes who will do what the can to help these Americans get to safety. If anything, the Russian characters seem to be much more intriguing and personally, ""The Darkest Hour"" could have been a much more enticing film if it was a full-on Russian alien infestation film utilizing an all Russian cast.  It's one of the things that I have loved about Timur Bekmambetov's ""Night Watch"" and ""Day Watch"" films, it's Russian sci-fi with Russian talent.  It seemed more plausible, much more exciting.

But I can understand the producers wanting to make their money back by making this film more International by using an American cast with English dialogue.

As for the Blu-ray release, ""The Darkest Hour"" no doubt looks wonderful on Blu-ray and the lossless soundtrack is fantastic!  There are a few special features including the short story ""The Darkest Hour: Survivors"", showcasing people of other countries fighting against the aliens.

Overall, ""The Darkest Hour"" is a popcorn alien infestation film with uninteresting characters, spotty acting and lackadaisical pacing.  There was too much sacrifice into making this film set in Russia to appeal to an American or International audience that the film would have been best being an all Russian film, as the characters and the us vs. them storyline would seem much more plausible and exciting.

While I can recommend this film to those who love alien infestation films, it's simply not one of the better alien infestation films to be released in the U.S.",1336176000,2,6946,5.085537918871252

At the closing scene, I'm still left wondering if ... { CENSORED since some prospective viewers prefer not to know how a movie ends ... sorry! } ... The last scene leaves too much room for speculation on possible future events relating to the characters.

There isn't enough action or suspense in this movie, just a handful of humans running around, trying to hide, and figuring out how to outwit somewhat invisible alien invaders.

This is an unfinished film it is as though they just ran out of money before they could finish the story.  The story doesn't conclude - it just stops in mid stream (quite literally in a sense).  I did not feel too robbed at the 3.99 I spent, I was very disappointed at how they just dropped the story at the end, but it is not without some entertainment value. This movie is much better than say a typical Syfy channel production.  In fact that is how I would describe this movie - as a bigger budget SyFy Channel movie.

5910321,3,B00EEE999G,"The Darkest Hour has some of my favorite younger actors in it. Emile Hirsch has surprised me regularly with his talent and Max Minghella is a very promising up and comer. Also being a big fan of sci-fi and end-of-the-world type movies, I naturally assumed this would be a winner.
The first half of the movie sets up a very interesting premise. Invisible invaders who hunt humans by detecting their body's electric current. There's even a few really great ideas here an there, like a microwave gun that stuns the aliens. Sure, you have to be a little forgiving with the science of it all, but I preferred to think of it as a little more serious Ghostbusters weapon.
The problem with this movie isn't the nonsense explanations for why the aliens invade or the ridiculous microwave gun or really anything to do with the general story. The problem is there's ZERO reason to care. The characters interact in the most dull way 90% of the time, and the rest of the time they're being completely unreasonable. You start to realize that any time the movie needs to create some drama, they'll have a character run off for the most ridiculous reasons. Besides the first 10 minutes of the movie, I don't think a single character dies from something besides their own stupidity.
Correction- it seems half the characters die because the russian girl doesn't know which way is up. In fact, The Darkest Hour has some of the most vapid female characters I've ever seen in cinema. They're simply there to get into trouble.
Overall: I loved the concept. The special effects were neat and there are some genuinely intense moments. This may have been a decent movie if the actors could have sold their performances better. I guess that's the problem with sticking the entire cast in front of a green screen for the majority of a movie.",1335916800,2,1814,4.671875

At first, I thought perhaps it might be like Cloverfield (which was, surprisingly, a good sci fi movie, slow start, great finish) but it was not. If you do not mind watching a movie with low budget special effects, tons of unanswered questions, and rather average to poor actors, this movie is for you; however while watching, I suggest you sit comfortably and have a fluffy pillow handy cause your gonna need it.",1335916800,4,652,4.629310344827586

5910324,1,B00EEE999G,"And that's definitely saying something, especially when you consider that I am far more lenient and open-minded with certain movies than most other people.

No, trust me and all the other one-star reviewers who've all said pretty much the same thing, this was a BORING and altogether poorly-made waste of time. If I had paid top dollar to see this in a theater, especially on Christmas Day when it opened, I would have been angrier than words could express. This film, as somebody else here has already iterated, belonged in a late-night slot on the SyFy Channel.

Emile Hirsch, who portrays one of the few leads here, has appeared in far better films in the past. So I completely fail to see why he accepted a part in this travesty. Yes, this story DOES involve an alien invasion of sorts; that, alone, was enough to snag my interest initially because I happen to enjoy those types of films. This one, however, just never got off the ground. The character development is non-existent, it just isn't there. And the pacing? It had me nodding off after the first half hour; the plot, what little there is of it, moves slower than a snail! I never thought that was possible, but ""The Darkest Hour"" has certainly proven me wrong.

I wasn't even able to finish the film and, just so you know, that has NEVER happened to me. I always see a movie through to its end, but I just plain and simply could not do that this time. This movie bored me to tears.

I took it back to the video store to trade it in for something else and, it would appear, I wasn't the only person to do that in recent days. The clerk told me he'd had many other customers doing the same exact thing.

If that doesn't tell you how bad ""The Darkest Hour"" really is, nothing will.

Proceed to watch it at your own peril.",1335657600,,1783,4.404255319148936
5910325,2,B00EEE999G,"""The Darkest Hour"" has potential. The premise is pretty darn interesting (although it's borrowed from other science fiction novels that have been around for at least twenty plus years)--what if an alien invasion occurs by creatures that we just can't see and appear to be electrical in nature? How do we fight something like that much less survive?

When a website designer Ben(Anthony Mingella) and his best friend Sean(Emile Hirsch)travel to Moscow to pitch their new design to a company they are greeted with disappointed--the head of the company Skyler (Joel Kinnaman)has ripped off the design and has no plans on paying them (his advice--""next time include a PDA""). The angry and disappointed duo end up clubbing where they meet Natalie (Olivia Tirlby)and Anne (Rachal Taylor). The attack occurs while the four and Skyler are at the club. Everyone who comes into contact with the aliens are vaporized and the quintet are on the run for their survival.

There's all the best elements for a thriller here but the writers (including Jon Spaihts who worked on an early version of ""Prometheus"")and director Chris Gorak (who directed a fascinating Indie thriller&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Right-at-Your-Door/dp/B000YIGNCW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Right at Your Door</a>where he does everything right that he gets wrong in this movie)do very little to develop the characters or the premise beyond your standard invasion movie. In fact ""The Darkest Hour"" borrows liberally from other recent invasion flicks (including Spielberg's version of War of the Worlds (Widescreen Edition)).

The Blu-ray release of this looks extremely good. Shot on digital video it almost looks as good as film in terms of its presentation here.

The 5.2 lossless soundtrack sounds terrific with strong presence but still maintaining clear dialogue.

The special features are actually in some ways better than the feature film itself. ""Survivors"" a short film based in the same ""world"" manages to be a stronger examination of the same themes.

""Visualizing the Invasion"" gives us the behind-the-scenes nuts and bolts of creating the interesting visual effects used throughout the film.

We also get deleted and extended scenes with commentary that gives us a bit of context as to why they were not used.

Finally we get a feature length commentary track by the director focusing on everything the challenges of shooting for a 3D exhibition (knowing eventually it will be shown without the 3D effects as well), shooting on location in Moscow and the various changes that were made to the script prior to shooting.

It's a pity that the director and writers didn't take a more unusual approach to the material as the premise itself it fascinating but it is developed into a VERY conventional invasion thriller with few surprises in the film.

""The Darkest Hour"" might be worth a rental (which is what I did)but I really couldn't recommend purchasing it unless you temper your expectations and get it for a decent price.",1335657600,,3041,5.316666666666666

The main cast in the film are regular civilian characters that in the beginning are far from being hero-types and react like everyone else in their situation with initial shock and fear not knowing who or what is attacking them and why. But as the story progresses they begin to learn about their new enemy and start adapting to survive being less and less victims and turning into fighters from the experience of now having to face the horrors of war. The character development was great for me at least for this particular reason. The special effects aren't amazing but it wasn't a big deal for me, I really enjoyed this flick and feel that it deserves a little better reception from critics because I really don't feel like this is a flawed film and Id think it be great if they made a sequel. So if your a sci-fi or alien invasion film fan I would suggest giving it a shot and rent it (at least to try and satisfy your appetite until The Avengers hits theaters next week), for anyone else I would recommend this too, but If your not into these kinds of movies then you should probably pass but I leave it up to you.

You couldn't say that there is a high body count here, because the aliens vaporize every living thing, leaving only a few ashes.

The characters are marginally believable, but the action is not very realistic, and the suspense is mostly about who is going to get toasted next. Although the aliens seem hopelessly high tech, impervious to firepower, equipped with wonderful sensors, they seem unable to hear our heroes talking, unable to react as a group, or come to the aid of other aliens.

I wasn't expecting reality, but I was hoping to get into the story, to be caught up in the action. Movies like Independence Day, or War of the Worlds were equally preposterous, but they had enough realism to fire my imagination, and I was completely enthralled by them. The Darkest Hour failed in that respect. It was ok, mildly entertaining, but essentially a disappointment.",1335052800,,1105,4.903743315508021

The acting was good and not as fake as other movies on the same subject.  I watched it through Amazon Instant Videos but did not buy the DVD or Blueray.

I know there will be some people who will have a better opinion on this movie but it was not one that I would want to have around all the time.",1334966400,,416,3.8588235294117648
5910339,1,B00EEE999G,"This movie makes no sense at all and it seemed like the writers were just pulling plot point out of their butt. First the lights can go over water then at the end they won't cross water. Glass blinds them yet they have broken glass PLENTY of times to get to their target. Metal shark cages...""just work"" WTH?!? So the lights can tear down buildings made of glass and metal yet these things are weaknesses whenever the writers need an excuse to keep the main characters alive for a while longer. One of the main characters is a douche bag who for some reason is able to say just the right thing that would make total strangers risk their lives for his whims.

Example, he and his group get saved by some strangers, then they ask them to take them to the submarine that is just randomly waiting for any survivors. Of course the strangers would say no. However, he's says ""What's the point in saving people if you won't see them home."" LOL!! yeah he actually says that and of course the strangers are fine with risking their lives just to escort them to their way out. Then they get to the sub and the man in charge is ready to leave...naturally as the lights are coming and already destroyed another boat. The main guy begs and pleads about how *he* can't leave his girlfriend of three days and of course the NAVY soldier is okay with that and risk his sub and the lives of his crew for one girl.

Then at the end the main douchebag character is with his girlfriend of three days on the sub with their steampunk like weapons looking over military maps like they are in charge. LOL! All around stupid movie.",1334966400,17,1604,4.361204013377926

I never went to the theatre to see it because of all the negative reviews. Finally, once it was available here, I went ahead and took a chance. Partly, to be honest, because I am a HUGE fan of Joel Kinnaman.

Well, I was pleasantly surprised. I really liked it. It's not a movie I'm watching because it's going to be Oscar nominated (besides-I usually don't care for those anyway). It gave an explanation for why the aliens are on Earth, how to kill them and the end left you with hope.

It actually reminded me a bit of Red Dawn or the Australian flick, Tomorrow, After the War Began; everything is not wrapped up in a bow but the end leaves you with hope.

5910344,2,B00EEE999G,"The Darkest Hour offers a new take on the alien invasion film with mixed results.  This American-Russian co-production finds two software developers Ben (Minghella) and Sean (Hirsch) traveling to Moscow where they hope to sell their new social networking app to a group of Russian investors.  However when they arrive at the meeting they find that their Swedish partner Skyler has stolen their idea and has already made a deal with the Russians.  Seeking to drown their sorrows they head to a nightclub where they meet a couple of women: Natalie, an American and her Australian friend Anne.

The city suffers a total blackout and as the curious partiers head outside they see hundreds of wispy, glowing lights floating down from the sky.  Then lights turn out to he a hostile race of aliens who can disintegrate a person with a mere touch, leaving behind only a pile of ash.  The four, along with backstabbing business partner Skyler take refuge in a basement storeroom where they remain for a full day until its safe to venture out.  However they find the city almost completely devoid of any life with ashes strewn about.  Keeping an eye out for the near-invisible aliens, the group somehow must try to survive and make it out of Moscow.

The aliens in The Darkest Hour are certainly original.  The glowing balls are mere shields protecting their bio-mechanical forms but this is about as far as the film goes with original ideas.  In the end it falls back on plot contrivances that have been used in every alien invasion film from War of the Worlds to Independence Day, often blatantly ripping off both of those films.  There's even the Deus Ex Machina moment when they figure out how to kill the aliens. The film is muddled with confusing and contrasting uses of the aliens powers.  Ben and Sean turn out to be typical film characters who are much smarter than anyone should be about an alien life form they've never encountered. After hiding behind a glass display in a clothing store, they determine that the aliens ""see"" using a kind of radar that detects a human's electro magnetic signature.  I mean, that exactly what I would have thought, too.

Yet it begs the question that if glass somehow blocks this ability then why aren't the people who were in their cars safe at the time of the attack.  As they explore the city they encounter an electrician who has covered the floors and walls of his apartment in metal grates which can somehow keep the aliens out.  Later however, we learn that they are mining our planets metals which they feed on.  So is metal good or bad for the aliens?  I still have no idea.

The film is essentially the same scene played over and over...move to a new place, explore it, encounter aliens, and run.  At no point does Director Chris Gorak stop long enough to offer anything remotely resembling character development.  I mean what was the point to having the Swedish partner steal their idea only to turn around and have them all act like nothing happened.  Sure, an alien invasion might tend to make you forget the rest of your problems but why toss that sub-plot in there anyway?

I mean it gets to the point when you actually start rooting for the aliens.  At least a little energy is infused in the last third of the film when they meet a gung-ho group of Russian soldiers who've found a way to hurt the aliens.  By this time though the film seems far longer than its 90 minute runtime.  There was a great idea here for a new and original type of alien but the filmmakers didn't seem to know what to do with it.

Another cheap ripoff of the recently popular scenes of aliens slowing descending in mass numbers onto Earth to wreck havoc. Another cheap ripoff of the vamp movie genre CGI showing people disintegrating into swirling ashes. Dumb physics that would embarrass a high school science student. A cheap prop of something called a microwave gun that was probably borrowed from '50s scifi. Surprisingly, the quickest/easiest solution in killing the aliens, shown at the beginning, was to throw some booze on them - specifically it's the alcohol, and they self immolate. The usual scattered cars and other trash on the streets. The usual small enclaves of humans fighting to the end and the usual submarine waiting to rescue some survivors.

5910349,1,B00EEE999G,"It's one thing these days to be bombarded with great looking CGI laden effects movies at the multiplex, but Chris Gorak's ""The Darkest Hour"" is something else, the CGI that this movie relies so heavily on is bad, it's not cheesy fun bad, it's just real bad. Every year it seems one of these type of C-grade shlock escapes and hides in the movie houses, in 2010 it was a little cinematic turd called ""Skyline"", in 2011 it's ""The Darkest Hour."" You may know these types, then again if your lucky or just smart, maybe not, these are the kind of movies with tawdry special effects and poor scripts which you wouldn't watch on the Syfy Channel for free, let alone shell out some hard earned greenbacks for.

The movie just plain looks awful, not just the poor effects, but bad editing, a static camera and some poor lighting don't help. The script by Jon Spaights, from a story by Spaights, Leslie Bohem and M.T. Ahern, is so paper thin that you could be forgiven for believing the actors are just running around shooting at things or running away from things without the benefit of having any script to follow, this is one of those movies they edit more than they direct. The cast is mostly capable, Emile Hirsh, who's career seems to still be reeling from the flop that was ""Speed Racer"" a few years back, Olivia Thirlby, so good in ""Juno"", and Max Minghella do the best they can with these flat, uninspired, one-dimensional characters, who you don't even particularly like. The late George C. Scott used to say that the way to judge good acting was by the joy the actor has in his performance, these kinds of movies live or die by their standards of fun and these actors are having no fun, there is no joy to their performances.

This is the kind of movie that doesn't get screened for film critics in advanced, in fear that people actually listen to film critics and don't see bad movies, fat chance. I know this because it's listed on the Darkest Hours's IMDb page under trivia, as though the filmmakers and/or distributor of this movie are proud of it, then again, I suppose that may be the most interesting thing about this turkey. I don't want to say anymore, I have already wasted too much of my life on ""The Darkest Hour"", but one thing I know is that I had no fun here, not a minute, not a moment, not a second of enjoyment, I left with a headache. However, just like the surviving characters of this movie, and possibly the actors and filmmakers, I feel like I survived an ordeal.

Yeah, this is a really bad movie, and it's absolutely not worth renting or owning. The effects are workmanlike, but nothing ""special."" The plot is all over the place, and many sequences don't make any sense. You'll find yourself yelling or groaning at the characters' every decision.

The special effects stand out, but the premise doesn't. It seems far less grand than most alien action movies that pull in the entire planet if not the entire country. There is a very narrow scope that focuses on these five people trying to find a way out of Moscow. If a bigger movie director did this, it would incorporate families seperated, whitehouses and monuments blowing up, presidents and armies fighting the menace and other big budget fluff. Instead this is five people going through empty streets.

The aliens are invisible for the most part and vaporize people for the first 60 minutes of the movie, before they can teather people with an electrical lightning like arm that pulls them in. That change seemed jarring. The movie really dragged in the middle which is saying a lot for a 89 minute movie.

This could have been done on SyFy Network.",1334448000,,996,4.818713450292398

5910357,3,B00EEE999G,"My wife and I like to see alien movies.  Darkest Hour is more understandable than Cowboys vs Aliens, and the characters are more likeable than Skyline.  The steady camera work also makes it less of a nausea fest than Cloverfield.  The movie is entertaining, even though it has a few tropes.

Unfortunately most of the time in Darkest Hour is consumed by the heroes running from glowing shadowy angel things.  All the running really showcases how nicely Moscow is filmed.  Oddly the movie takes the heroes through all the famous tourist spots in Moscow.  A nightclub, the highway, Red square, The Kremlin, Moscow GUM(mall), the US Embassy and the famous metro are all setpieces.  Perhaps without all the shadowy ghostly things, all of these places in Moscow would be fun to see.

If you are looking for over the top violence, sex, or drama, there is none here.  That isn't the fault of the young and unknown actors and actresses, its because you can't really script a movie about running from invisible angel things.  The movie has more Deus Ex Machina than the average Star Trek: The Next Generation episode. It's a better movie than Cloverfield but it is begging for some closure.

These are not ordinary aliens. They are mostly invisible and like Predator seem to hunt by infrared. They kill humans and barking dogs using some kind of microwave beam that causes living things to explode (the cool part). Our focus group of 5 young adults hide in a large storage closet that has food.

Now what? Do you A) stay put until all the food is gone, then maybe venture out to get more food, hoping that the aliens have killed enough humans. And if captured all they would want to do is probe you?

or B) Try to find the US embassy so they can get you back home. Personally I would go with ""A"" because I know for a fact the US embassy does not have contingency plans for an alien invasion. Perhaps they need to advertise that more.

To be honest I got a bit bored during the alien hide and seek part. There were no monsters to see, so they saved a ton of money on make-up and special effects. I didn't feel much intensity. The acting was okay considering the lack of a script. They needed to add a little humor, maybe a love scene with an ""exploding"" ending.
Asylum dull.

2 f-bombs. No sex, or nudity. Some hip-hop song lyrics were suggestive.",1334016000,,1857,4.3652173913043475

5910378,3,B00EEE999G,"""We take one step outside and we're dust, we can't even see these
things."" Sean (Hirsch) and Ben (Minghella) are on their way to Moscow
to become rich. They have an idea for a website that will make them
millionaires, but when they get there they are surprised to see someone
steal their idea. They decide to forget all that by going to a bar.
There they meet two other Americans and they think their luck is
changing until they witness an alien attack. Now the small group of
survivors must find a way home safely. I wasn't sure what to expect
from this going in. The preview looked OK but I also thought it could
be lame. I have to say I got exactly what I thought. The movie was
entertaining enough to keep me interested but the big problem was that
the longer it went on the cheesier and more far-fetched it got. I would
call this a little like ""Day After Tomorrow"" with aliens. Overall,
there are worse ways to spend an hour and a half. Entertaining but a
little laughable the longer it went on. I give it a B-.",1333843200,2,1016,4.242268041237113

5910380,2,B00EEE999G,We were really looking forward to this one after seeing the previews which made it seem as if it was going to be a winner. There was very little 3d at all. The plot was so so. Was mostly a let down,1333670400,3,197,3.7142857142857144
5910381,2,B00EEE999G,"This film was a terrible disappointment, mainly as I expected much more than what it was.

The story itself is probably passable for a movie. Some Americans in Moscow are caught up with aliens invading Earth for its mineral. Nothing terribly original in the story. Although I thought some of the lines of dialogue were interesting.

So it is all up to the characterization, acting and the filming to make the movie something. Unfortunately, nothing like this happened. I did not think any of the characters were particularly interesting. The acting was poor as was the filming.",1333411200,3,577,4.938144329896907

I watched this movie, after seeing how ""cool"" the previews were however...do NOT think for ONE minute this movie will be good....it was horrid. I mean, a week hiding and no one grows facial hair, nor does the dead body give off a bad odor...? Come on...the movie was made in a rush, everything crammed into it to make it seem worthwhile. They make dumb choices throughout the entire movie that people facing actual extinction would definitly not make. It is VERY predicatble and about 45 minutes in, I was checking to see how much longer the movie was... I mean, another issue was the guy and his girlfriend fall into the water, and when he comes up he cannot find her, then when he climbs onto the submarine, a flare comes up, and she is ten blocks away on land...What the heck?!?!?

5910385,2,B00EEE999G,"I won't go into the level of detail as to who was in Darkest Hour nor who made it. I will tell you that in my, and my family's opinion... this film was bad. The effects were great up until the Aliens were actually revealed... then they looked like a bad SyFy channel rendering.
I loved the fact that it took place in Russia. The characters who seemed to be ""in the know"" as to how to avoid, and deal, with the aliens were too conveniently placed leaving the main cast really nothing to uncover for themselves. I would have much rather seen these people figure it out on their own... vs hiding out in a bunker... while others figured out everything before these people decided to come out of their cave.

I realize that if the story followed the people who are in the thick of it all... the ones who developed the ""Resistance"" and the ""electrician""... the budget goes up... but, this is, or rather was an original idea... and shudda been better.

I will tell you this, as well, LOL I really wanted to like this film! Maybe the sequel if there is one will do better, because you can only go up from here.",1330992000,16,1102,4.293269230769231
5910386,4,B00EEE999G,"In this movie, four young Americans (including Emile Hirsch, from Speed Racer, and Max Minghella, from Art School Confidential, among others) get stranded in Moscow when an alien invasion (represented initially, intriguingly, as a lethal form of electromagnetic waves) attack Moscow, leaving almost everyone dead. Our friends hide in a sort of basement, and when a few days later, they emerge from inside, they find wholesale destruction, and the news that the aliens have attack planet wide, but also intriguing hints that there maybe other survivors. And soon enough, they find that some Russians have banded together to resist the invaders.

Produced by Kazakh filmmaker Timur Bekmambetov (from the interesting Nightwatch franchise) this movie is nothing special but is surely an entertaining outing. Among the plus: the survivors escaping from the aliens in a desolate Moscow, including empty landmarks like The Kremlin and Moscow State University. Among the minus: some of the special effects are really cheesy.",1329436800,73,1016,5.471337579617835
