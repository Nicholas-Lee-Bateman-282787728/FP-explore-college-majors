8359997,5,B002APTN4C,"As one of those old Woodheads, I must admit that all the other reviews are correct IF you correspond to one of those prejudices.  We were all WARNED !  I enjoyed this DVD because of how it illuminates the socially-relevant Plan 9 plot at a new angle, uses delightful recognizable sound cuts from the original, and takes a deep-cutting swipe--don't blink, watch the lower right hand corner--at a former dumb president.  I reward hard work when I can, and pay whatever is asked to watch it.  I love work; I can watch it for hours.",1447113600,,528,4.526315789473684
8359998,5,B002APTN4C,Remember Hardware Wars? Ernie Fosselius rides again in this suspenseful yet cheesy tribute to Ed Woods. I'm buying several DVDs as gifts for those hard-to-please folks. They'll love it!,1436400000,,185,5.413793103448276

8360001,5,B002APTN4C,"Not much to say but this puppet show is fantastic. Ernie ""Hardware Wars"" Fosselius did an amazing job fitting this 17 minute movie into the original PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE. The bloopers were funny especially of Tor Johnson, so dumb but hysterical. The wife of Gregory Walcott was so funny looking but I know it was a tribute to Ed Wood. I know I did not give much word but it is what you expect, PLAN 9 in puppet form. 5 out of 5 star rating!",1267488000,3,443,4.103448275862069
8360002,1,B002APTN4C,"When we ordered this disc, we expected the movie ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" redone with puppets. It sounded hilarious but what a waste of money it ended up being. The puppets do look funny but the feature runs only 15 minutes and the disc is 15 dollars!! There are ""out takes"" included but they are so painfully bad that we took the disc out after only a few of them... and we actually enjoy Plan 9. Do yourself a favor and stay far away from this disc. Plan 9 the movie is included as an extra, but you can but that on Ed Wood collections for about 10 bucks.",1265500800,11,558,4.081818181818182
