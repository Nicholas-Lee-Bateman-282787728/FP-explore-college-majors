8070601,3,B0009YNSOM,what I mean by the headline is the movie plays well except when it gets to the episode of barney happy birthday ending it skips right to the next thing right after the Hebrew birthday song plays.,1397088000,,195,4.297297297297297
8070602,4,B0009YNSOM,"Let me begin by saying the Hebrew production of Barney is very different (not a dub) from the US one, by having exclusive kids, a modern (by 1997 anyway) Barney costume and the Barney Bag was current too. Despite that, the episodes are based off the original scripts from Season 1. In this episode based off the episode ""Happy Birthday Barney"", it's Barney's birthday and Yanah, Aviv, and the others (yes, I know their names, despite not being jewish) want to plan a birthday party for him. A few songs were cut and script changes were made (there are no piatas in Israel), but nothing much has changed. If you are curious about getting this DVD or any other hebrew Barney DVD, I highly recommend it.",1232150400,3,700,4.563492063492063
