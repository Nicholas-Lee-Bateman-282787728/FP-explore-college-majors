8247834,4,B0012UHYG0,"This video is useful as part of the curriculum for a class on U.S. history in general, on Mexican-American history (all the men profiled are Mexican or Mexican-American by birth), or in conjunction with a Spanish class, particularly as part of a lesson related to Veterans' Day or Memorial Day. While I wouldn't necessarily go as far as a previous reviewer in declaring the video a recruiting tool, I would agree that the descriptions of battle action are consistent with the tone used in conferring the honor; that is, all descriptions of battle are focused on bravery and accomplishment, with no discussion of related moral questions or issues connected to war in general, the specific wars mentioned, or prejudices encountered by any of the people highlighted in the video. This is not to say that the video is not of high quality. My students found it fascinating and compelling, and I think viewing it was worthwhile.

The content is entirely in English, so nearly as I could tell; if there were any Spanish subtitles available, I didn't find them. It has been a week or so since we watched it, but I seem to recall there were not English captions either, at least not that were accessible using the DVD drive on my computer. I know that sometimes material for television has captions that only show up when the television's captioning feature is turned on. Also, the video does have one factual error in the introduction: It states that Hispanic Americans received X number of medals (the figure is slightly larger now) and that this figure is ""the most of any ethnic group"" (or minority group, or similar term). This statement is incorrect, as the number of African-American recipients is roughly double the number of Hispanic recipients. The disc menu has a chapter break for each servicemember, which is particularly helpful for classroom uses where it is desirable to divide viewing over two days or if time constraints make it necessary to omit one of the five profiles.

As a notetaking aid, I would recommend a chart including columns for ""name, origin, conflict, notable facts"" and asking for three notable facts per serviceman. I also raised with my students the points that there were Hispanic medal recipients from other origins, such as Puerto Ricans; that like African-Americans and Asian-Americans, many Hispanic servicemembers experienced discrimination during and after their service, as in the noted case of Felix Longoria; and that there were Hispanic MOH recipients going back to the U.S. Civil War. For classroom use, the video should -- like all videos -- be given context for better understanding. Nonetheless, I definitely would use it again in my classroom and am glad that it is available.",1332892800,,2720,4.975824175824176

8247836,4,B0012UHYG0,"This work interviews LatinOs who received the Medal of Honor and details their heroic deeds.  Since it shows many harmless old men, many viewers may be reminded of their fathers or grandfathers, regardless of race.  This may be a great thing to show during a Hispanic Heritage Month or Week.  Still, the dove in me fears that the military could use it as a recruitment tool.
The work shows no female Honor recipients.  This is probably due to bans on women in some or all combat areas.  All of the interviewees are of Mexican ancestry and those non-Mexican Latinos may feel excluded here.  This work is almost about disability as much as it is about race.  These men recall how they lost body parts or functions.  Regardless of race, some may relate to the ability politic here.
Lots of law professors chide, ""Don't play the oppression sweepstakes!""  This means, never say, ""Group X is mistreated in the US more than Group Y.""  However, throughout this work, these soldiers say nothing about racism.  The work is filled with white military buddies or white wives who embrace these men of color.  This is in sharp contrast to documentaries on African-American soldiers and Japanese-American soldiers who recalled that the military was a hotbed of racism.  I salute all the veterans here, but it does make me wonder if the military, and the larger American society, embraces LatinO men much more than it would other men of color.  This work did make me think that maybe majority-raced soldiers feel that LatinOs are ""like us"" while other men are dismissed as ""Others.""
This could be a great Father's Day gift for LatinO veterans/dads.",1243468800,2,1632,4.823741007194244
