4109817,4,B003CN97YW,"I bought and watched this video thinking I would hate it after reading the other reviews, but I ended up enjoying it for the most part. The sets are very sparse, the costumes are modern dress, and much of the choreography is new, although done in a classical ballet style, so it is still very beautiful.

Odette/Odile has traditional choreography (her actual dancing will not seem any different than a traditional production), and Semionova is marvelous. She holds some wonderful balances, and her characterization is very good. Her Odette is very sad and hoping for some help from her situation. Her Odile is deliciously naughty. This is a great dancer, and I urge anyone who is a fan to buy this dvd just for her.

Stanislav Jermakov is a nice, hunky Prince Siegfried. He partners Semionova well. He is given some new choreography and does it all well. He is a very beefy looking Siegfried, and he comes down hard and loudly on the stage at times, but overall he is nice.

There is a strange subtext or story between Rothbart and Siegfried that I have not figured out at all. This is a Rothbart who is a combination of Benno and Rothbart....a friend of Siegfried's, but also up to no good. I am not sure what Spoerli was trying to depict between the two of them.

Personally, I did not mind the sparse stage or modern dress or even the new choreography (some of which is lovely). I think even if you hate all that but like Polina Semionova you will not be disappointed when you see this. She is terrific and worth the price of this dvd!!!",1341100800,,1540,4.508960573476703
4109818,2,B003CN97YW,"My friend bought this DVD recently at Amazon and showed it to me. He was very upset over his disappointment with the production and wanted me either to commiserate with him or to help him find some sort of redeeming qualities here. I entered upon the prospect of viewing this DVD with a completely open mind, as I really had no emotional investment. Unfortunately I came to be just as disappointed as he was, in the end.

My friend first had me read choreographer Heinz Spoerli's essay included in the DVD's booklet. Even though I am a professional classical musician who has extensive experience performing the works of contemporary composers who, I have discovered, can sometimes be self-absorbed, pompous asses, I was in an exceptionally charitable mood on this occasion, and I was entirely willing to give Herr Spoerli the benefit of the doubt: He writes like a self-absorbed, pompous ass, but maybe he has something worthwhile to say in his choreography, once the toe shoes actually hit the boards.

Spoerli tells us his aim in this production was to give us a Swan Lake for our modern times. As I was to discover when I watched the DVD, this apparently means a lot of walking around on stage. (Is this ballet or walking aerobics?) There seemed to be interminably long stretches with very little for the clearly accomplished dancers of the Zurich company to busy themselves with.

(By the way, I don't much care who was flown in to dance the Odette/Odile role in a production like this that is touted as a rethinking or reenvisioning of a classic. This production either stands or falls as an ensemble event, and in my opinion no amount of star power trotting out the steps for the lead role is going to have any real relevance to the whole unless her part is also reimagined. It isn't really, so if you want a balletomane's detailed account of how the lead acquitted herself, look elsewhere.)

Spoerli also seems to believe that Tchaikovsky's music can safely be ignored or even defied. We are hearing some of the most danceable music on earth, but when Spoerli is not having the dancers walk around the stage aimlessly or configuring them in tiresome grid patterns (arms thrust out in an almost windmill-like formation -- mechanical, ""modern"" swans?), he is at other times deliberately nullifying Tchaikovsky's musical storytelling. Case in point: Tchaikovsky gives us a series of trumpet volleys introducing guest dancers at the ball, who dance their bit and then move on; and after the final volley, the low brass of the orchestra violently interrupt with an abrupt, descending scale landing on a massive percussion ""boom-CHICK"" -- emphasis on the ""CHICK"" because it is syncopated (after the beat) and extremely attention-grabbing. This is meant to be the most dramatic moment in the entire ballet, the entrance of the black swan. But where is she? For ten or more agonizingly tedious seconds we are forced to watch members of the corps de ballet AND the prince WALK AROUND THE STAGE until the musical cue for our ballerina has faded into memory. She deigns to show up only after any remaining suspense has been drained from this sad little production.

This is the greatest music ever written for the ballet, and what does Spoerli do with it?

This choreographer doomed the good efforts of these dancers (and of the orchestra), and he did the unthinkable and rendered the music irrelevant. Good players and a divine musical blueprint do not necessarily make for a good play. Don't waste your money here. I wish I could get back the time I spent watching this ill-conceived production.",1327190400,13,3594,4.835772357723577
4109819,2,B003CN97YW,"Polina Semionova is one of the greatest ballerinas in the world, and so this production has one thing going for it.
Otherwise, it is boring and sterile, danced on a bare (and sometimes darkish) stage, with a reduced number of
swans.  Inexplicably, the evil magician Rothbart is also a friend of the Prince's and is present in most of the
court scenes as well as lakeside. The choreography is merely competent.  Semionova deserves better and so do we.",1294099200,5,450,4.756410256410256
4109820,3,B003CN97YW,"I feel a bit guilty about giving this DVD only three stars. After all, a new production of Swan Lake is always welcome. Most of the choreography for the Zurich Ballet's Swan Lake is by Heinz Spoerli, and his intention to give us a modern version (but with classical ballet's vocabulary) is certainly to be applauded. So why only three stars?
Heinz Spoerli seems to feel that he has to defend classical ballet in general and Swan Lake in particular against those who believe that the 19th century repertory is dusty and old fashioned (tutus, tights and tiaras, silly I-you-love-Pantomime etc). So in order to avoid these accusations most of the potentially embarrassing elements have been eliminated (but not the tutus), leaving us with a very modern, minimalist stage and gloomy atmosphere that could have been interesting had the dancers been given the opportunity to do something with it. But the ballet as a whole looks strangely dry and bloodless, the dancers like neutral bodies, not characters. The Zurich Ballet company apparently has not had much experience with this kind of repertory - they dance mostly neoclassical works, which probably explains why this performance looks so abstract. I was disappointed to see the corps de ballet dancers on this DVD dancing to some imaginary metronome instead of the music, but maybe Mr. Spoerli's own choreography and the orchestra playing were encouraging them to do so (the orchestra is very good, but plays in a rather straight way).
Polina Semionova as Odette/Odile is guesting from Berlin. She has wonderful Russian schooling and plastique and an elegiac style.
Although I did not like the production as a whole, there are some beautiful details: for example at the end Odette disappears in some sort of rain and Siegfried follows her, which looks much more subtle and poetic than jumping in a lake which we don't see and striking a pose at the back of the stage to demonstrate that she and Siegfried are united in death. The lighting design is very good as well.
All in all I think this should maybe not be anybody's first Swan Lake - it is not a good introduction because it is so weak in the acting department and there is not much left of the original choreography. On the other hand this is a rethought and rechoreographed Swan Lake, presented with cool elegance. It is definitely interesting for people who have already seen a more traditional version or who do indeed think that ballet is anachronistic nonsense.",1280793600,13,2473,4.876484560570071
4109821,4,B003CN97YW,"This production is anything but standard. Even the music compilation is not exactly the usual part heard in regular productions. The picture is good but could be better. The group dancing doesn't form the beautiful scenes usually seen is other swan lakes.

Regarding individual and small group dancing, this is a completely different story. There is much here to enjoy and admire, and I have news for you, it is not only semionova. A very refreshing part is in the third act when delegations come to the pallace. The dances are named ""variations"" and are followed by a ""russian dance"".

Opposite to the other review I wish there are more close-ups scenes to appreciate these dances",1280793600,3,681,4.862068965517241
4109822,5,B003CN97YW,"If you are like me--and you may well be--, your interest in this dvd and in this review can probably summed up in two words:  Polina Semionova (Odette/Odile).  I was thinking that this production might be a star-turn for her, but that is not the case.  This is not your father's (or mother's) ""Swan Lake"", as it turns out.  Semionova is just as wonderful as you or I would expect, and is the most swan-like and sad Odette that I have seen, but this production is more than she.

""Choreography by Heinz Spoerli after Marius Petipa"" the enclosed booklet states:  We shall aver that it is WELL ""after Petipa"".  I shall describe the choreography as ""Petipa infused with Balanchine"", and to fine effect.  But I am getting ahead of myself.  Spoerli has rethought this ballet from the ground up, especially the role of Rothbart, whom we see right away as, in fact, Siegfried's mentor.  He still possesses his magical powers but is no swamp creature, rather a magician who seems to be jealous of Siegfried:  a relationship similar to Iago's with Othello.  (And that is all I shall explore here about the dramatic structure.)  This is an exceedingly elegant production and realization thereof, very atmospheric.  All the colors (basically blues with some red) tend to be muted, giving a dream-like effect; and perhaps that is the intention here: that this entire drama is a dream of Siegfried's in which he explores his complex relationship with Rothbart and his love for someone perhaps unobtainable.  Or perhaps, if this indeed be a dream, Rothbart is but Siegfried's own dark side, with whom he wrestles, as he explores his own complex feelings and fallibility surrounding Odette:  could be--you decide for yourself.  I am much impressed with Spoerli's choreography, especially in ensemble scenes.  (The second and fourth acts are bathed in a soft blue light from top to bottom that gives the swans a mesmerizing effect.  Excellent corps work by the way, complimenting the choreography.)  Both the lighting and sets (semi-abstract) enhance this understated elegance.

As for the dancers:  Semionova, with her physical allure and elegance of movement, is, in my thinking, an unapproachable choice for this production.  I love how her Odette is never mechanical in the least and never in a hurry:  She makes the most out of every gesture, every step, and embodies the role at the emotional level.  She draws you into the drama. Her Odile is certainly not as flashy as some others nor as sexy, but entirely appropriate to this concept.  We can easily see how Siegfried is convinced that she is indeed (somehow) his beloved Odette.  (And in one of those places where Spoerli accedes entirely to Petipa, Semionova easily pulls off her thirty-two fouettes, with the first ten of them or so being doubles--just to let us know that she is as capable of as much bravura as anyone you could name.) I will say pretty much the same for Stanislav Jermakov as Siegfried:  never mechanical, and although not, apparently, the world's greatest bravura dancer, this is not a bravura-centered concept and his technique is certainly strong.  He too is convincing at the emotional level while still understated.  I think that Arsen Mehrabyan is exceedingly well-cast as Rothbart:  menacing and enigmatic.  I am going to repeat myself here:  Great choreography for the corps and excellently danced.

This is a film of a live production (hooray!), filmed in HD (hooray again).  I wish to express my appreciation to the cinematographers and the editor:  Many interesting camera angles and cuts and a few well-chosen close-ups.  This ""technical"" crew seems to have a fine artistic sensibility for filming ballet:  much appreciated, as I said.  Oh yes, Vladimir Fedoseyev, the conductor:  Very obvious attentiveness and sympathy for the music and dancers (though I would have preferred some faster tempi in some of the bravura variations).

In sum, a dark and dream-like emotive rethinking of this classic, superbly danced.  I highly recommend it.",1278201600,29,4015,5.003021148036254

8394316,5,B003CN97YW,"the negative reviews made me hesitate but i am very glad i rented it not only for semionova, for there are also some other very fine dancers including yen han doing the russian dance.  the choreography was quite altered in the party scenes, with pairs and smaller groups of dancers being allowed to dance more intensively.  definitely a ""non-traditional"" production, but i personally found it refreshing.  the orchestration is exceptionally good also.  for me the music can be as important as the dancing and i have to say the first violin is superb in this.  i do understand others' disappointment - it's easy to become attached to a certain overall mood and choreographic approach to each piece of the music.  i must say finally that since i rented this i didn't have an opportunity to read the insert and so understand how rothbert was portrayed, but it didn't seem to matter in the end since the dancing was so terrific.  and the corps de ballet had quite a bit of altered choreography as well which i enjoyed.",1491868800,,1014,4.694915254237288
8394317,5,B003CN97YW,I love this Company its so creative and the dancers are amazing!,1436572800,,64,4.416666666666667
8394318,4,B003CN97YW,"Picture Swan Lake as an abstraction, reduced to essentials. Eliminate stage sets to indicate time or place. Rely on lighting to supply design. Prohibit simple props such as crossbows. Forget mimed gestures to explain plot. Dress everyone, except for the mythical swan maidens, in contemporary costumes. Focus on Prince Siegfried's development by cutting the cast so the same dancer portrays both his mentor and his antagonist.

Bring in Tchaikovsky expert Vladimir Fedoseyev to draw forth glorious sound from the Zrich Opera Orchestra. Keep key elements of the 1895 Petipa/Ivanov choreography, but spice it up a bit. Cut, splice, and re-order a few dances just enough to keep complacent viewers alert.

Add a young ballerina who runs off with the show, a vivacious and well-drilled corps de ballet, an ending that suddenly chills the spine, a Blu-ray recording of vivid color and detail, and you have a production well worth the experience -- although that endorsement comes with two major reservations.

First, this undertaking presumes an audience thoroughly familiar with Swan Lake. I can't guess what someone who didn't already know the story would think was happening, from beginning to end. Even after having seen 12 or 13 other Swan Lake productions before this, I felt off-kilter throughout Act I.

Second, the Rothbart-like hostility that Siegfried's mentor displays toward the young prince from the outset doesn't work and cripples what could otherwise have been a refreshing modern vision of a classic. Pointless posturing between the two in the first act distracts from the lively corps de ballet and evokes the more questionable elements of Nureyev's Swan Lake. Fortunately, the Nureyev touches are not carried out to the degree that they are in the Paris Opera disc&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tchaikovsky-Swan-Lake-Blu-ray/dp/B0019MQBJW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tchaikovsky: Swan Lake [Blu-ray</a>]. And later on, the Siegfried-Rothbart relationship is depicted in a more conventional attitude, if remaining less conventional in style.

Despite the marred Act I, much of great value shines through, there and in what follows. The dancing is marvelous. The corps de ballet, its soloists, the beautifully depicted swan maidens, Stanislav Jermakov as Siegfried, Arsen Mehrabyan as Rothbart -- all acquit themselves well. There are no weak links. But rising above the rest is Polina Semionova, who appeared as the Black Swan with Roberto Bolle&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tchaikovsky-Gala-Blu-ray/dp/B001FRNOUU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tchaikovsky Gala [Blu-ray</a>] in La Scala's Tchaikovsky Gala.

Born in Moscow and now principal ballerina with the American Ballet Theatre, Semionova has all the technique in the world, but doesn't use it as an end in itself. Rather, she employs her skill to animate character. Unlike the stereotypically aloof prima ballerina who remains enclosed in a world of her own, seemingly oblivious of her fellow dancers and distanced from the audience by the proscenium arches, Semionova actually acknowledges the theater crowd's applause by making eye contact ... and smiling! She looks as though she's really enjoying herself, despite the rigorous effort her dual role demands.

Establishing contact with the audience doesn't damage the onstage illusion when action resumes, but instead makes Semionova more sympathetic as Odette, more alluring as Odile. Only 25 at the time of this 2009 recording, she triumphs. Not yet to the level of Svetlana Zakharova in La Scala's Swan Lake&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Swan-Lake/dp/B0040Y7EME/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Swan Lake</a>, but heading in that direction. Semionova's performance by itself justifies acquiring this disc.

So does the ending, which I won't ruin by describing. It delivers a more powerful frisson every time I see it.

The first act is beyond all repair, and because of its flaws, I cannot give the Zrich production an unqualified recommendation. It shouldn't be anyone's first or only Swan Lake. But it's one to which I will return and that I hope lovers of this ballet will consider.",1408492800,5,4237,5.843042071197411

8394322,2,B003CN97YW,"Polina Semionova is one of the truly great ballerinas of our (or, I suspect, any) time.  Her wonderful long line, the
vivacity of her attack, and her sense of lyricism make her an enormous pleasure to watch even in an otherwise
awful production.  The plot as been altered beyond belief (Siegfried's friend Benno has become his real lover!), and
the choreography for the ensemble is mediocre at best.  There is an overwhelmingly blue color throughout, as
you can see in the jacket image, and the stage is shadowy during much of the performance.  Much better to
invest in ""Tchaikovsky Gala,"" where you can see Semionova as the Black Swan partnered by one of the very few
male dancers who is as great as she is, Roberto Bolle.",1376870400,2,723,4.669291338582677
8394323,2,B003CN97YW,"This is a Swan Lake for the 21st Century.  The sado-masochistic undertones in the relationship between Siegfried and Rothbart have a Robert Mapplethorpe visual quality, with Siegfried down on his knees cowering before an arrogant Rothbart who keeps his groin in Siegfried's face and is naked to the waist under a dull red tuxedo jacket, with his chest dyed red.

If you like traditional costuming and sets, this is NOT the Swan Lake for you.  The costumes in the birthday scene in the first act and in the ballroom scene are severely modern.  Only the swan scenes are done in traditional white tutus.  The drab costumes and sets make Tchaikovsky's music seem too lush for the production.  On the plus side, the corps de ballet in the swan scenes is exceptionally well-disciplined.  As for Semionova, if you like scrawny, long-limbed, masculinely athletic ballerinas, this is the Swan Lake for you.  I found her VERY unfeminine in both appearance and style.",1369699200,2,956,4.93125
