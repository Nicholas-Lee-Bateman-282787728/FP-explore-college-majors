1730986,5,B000068UXG,"I read some reviews before purchasing this dvd, and wasn't sure to do it, specially when i have the superb production from deutsche oper on VHS, and the opinions here were not favorable at all. Then i found a great sale, and i got it.

I would say is not the Salome i was expecting by the production itself. specially because Salome don't get naked (for my point of view, this is kinda necesary to perform) and then a couple of things.

But after watching the opera, i found an expert Malfitano giving all herself to the role. I enjoyed Terfel's performance, wich i find superior than Deutsche oper's Estes. And after all, The production deserves 5 stars. I liked very much the mixture of ages. Every character wears different centuries, and all mixed up. the settings are dark and enigmatic.

But above all, i recommend Malfitano's performance. Is by far a great experience to see this dvd.",1159401600,5,891,4.6265822784810124
1730987,5,B000068UXG,"Director Luc Bondy turns up the heat on Richard Strauss'Salome by framing the action as a scorching family drama in this Royal Opera production conducted by Christoph von Dohnnyi and starring the ravishing American soprano Catherine Malfitano. If you're a fan of hers, this DVD will be a delightful experience, though even this performance is inferior to her other performance with the Berlin Opera. The sets are minimalist and the production rather avant-garde, focusing on the sexual aspects of the story. Malfitano sings the role with the perfect mixture of girlish curiosity and sexual depravity. Her Dance of the Seven Veils is supremely erotic to say the least, without being overtly sexual. John the Baptist is sung by Bryn Terfel, the famous Welsh baritone, and he is the only baritone to date who makes the role noteworthy and on equal grounds with the Salome of Malfitano. A good production of Salome lies in the chemistry between Salome and the mysterious mystic Jochanaan. Kenneth Reigel sings Herod, though his voice is rather light, grating and completely wrong for the part, which calls for a bigger, meatier voice. Reigel is mostly a lyric tenor and he appeared in a 1979 film version of Don Giovanni starring Ruggero Raimondi. When you compare his performance as Don Ottavio with Herod, you'll see how this part is out of his league. The Queen Herodias of Anja Silja is particularly cold and leonine, with strong vocal power, only surpassed by Leonie Rysanek on studio recordings and on live recordings. The look of this Salome is symbolic and expressive, and if you're into modern interpretations this is for you. Malfitano's Salome is a revelation. Not only does she look the part (as oppossed to brilliant singers like Birgit Nilsson who sang the role with great acclaim but didn't look the part) but provides her voice with enough power and lyricism to master the role. Malfitano's acting abilities served her well and she has appeared in other films as well, such as the 1991 Tosca with Placido Domingo and Ruggero Raimondi. This is an overall great production and is highly recommended.",1132790400,4,2109,4.977337110481586
1730988,5,B000068UXG,"Can highly recommend this equisite production of Strauss's Salome.  Malfitano in my opinion is the most gifted artist to ever play the role of Salome; her dramatic ability, dancing and voice are unparalled. She completely assumes the role as Strauss would have wanted.",1125273600,7,268,5.232558139534884
1730989,3,B000068UXG,"What's the use of buying a DVD version of an opera if you have to close your eyes to enjoy it?  The cast in this production is excellent.  However, the sets by Erich Wonder, costumes by Susanne Raschig, stage production by Luc Bondy, and choreography by Lucinda Childs are all awful!  When you think about it, you have to wonder how hard it must be for the Royal Opera to find people who understand the opera LESS than any street amateur.  My three stars all go to the wonderful cast; none to those who directed them.",1117065600,11,517,4.354166666666667
1730990,5,B000068UXG,"Despite Dohnnyi's bureaucratical approaches to many orgasmic bars of the opera,I think this the best Salome on DVD at the present time. The Convent Garden Orchestra was perfectly catched in translucent audio. Soloists was superb and I disagree completely previous rewiews on Catherine Malfitano because I was stupefied by her evolution on this character after Berlin performance. Her breath is enormous,her voice is fertile and brilliant,invencible to the most huge orchestral tutti just like a trumpet,and that incredible stamina on final scene. Of course she isn't a great actress but her conception is analysed at the most intelligent frame. Surely her Salome,if was naked or not,is a commanding one. Terfel sings his most imposing Jokanaan,almost cripple the setting floor when he overflows in rage and determination. In this recording I can hear fully character's off-stage imprecations against Herodias like I never heard before on cd's. Very fine Herodes by Riegel. However,I prefered this if more notes are tuned up than all but speaked. Why this ""over-and-over again-sprechgesang""?.Anyway,Riegel is great here. Thus,I think many performers to Herodias elapsed too much time tied on overvibratos and untuned histerical aspects of Salome's mother,just like Anja Silja sings that(of course,Rysanek was that stupendous Herodias in Berlim).However,audiences on Royal Opera gives her an astonishing ovation. Habsburgs sets and costumes and waltzistic seven veils dance will be contested. But,if you want a well sunged DVD,not simple theatre,listen me;no Maria Ewing. This is your Salome.",1091836800,17,1590,5.684873949579832
1730991,5,B000068UXG,"I own this DVD of Salome, along with the rival version from ROH with Maria Ewing. They are both excellent in their own way. Let's hope that Malfitano's earlier attempt of Salome from Berlin will be released soon by NVC Arts",1088035200,7,223,4.463414634146342
1730992,2,B000068UXG,"Gorgeous soprano Cathy Malfitano delivers a tour de force performance of Salome which graphically depicts the Hebrew princess's journey from curiosity, through infatuation, and culminating in insanity in her amorous pursuit of the ultimate party pooper John the Baptist. Her Dance of the Seven Veils was sensual, erotic, revealing, and mesmerizing. But, unfortunately, that's not the performance on this DVD. Her stellar performance was with Deutsche Oper Berlin and that is available only on VHS and Laser Disk. This DVD recording of a Covent Garden performance has some artistic merit but just isn't in the same league.
The Dance of the Seven Veils in this London performance is simply called Salome's Dance which was appropriate since we are shortchanged about 5 veils. Cathy spends a great deal of time running on and off the stage reminiscent of the Peter Sellers movie After the Fox in which Sellers directs Britt Ekland and Victor Mature to run aimlessly up and down the beach in a search for the meaning of life. At one point she was writhing on her back like a bug that had just been hit with insecticide. Not content to just watch, King Herod decided to join in and attempt to help her remove a veil. This pointless experiment with modern dance was tepid and lackluster compared with her Berlin performance.
I have no regrets about purchasing this DVD. First, the audio is excellent. Second, Bryl Terfel is superb as John the Baptist. And, I adore the delectable Ms. Malfitano and would gladly purchase a recording of her singing the phone book. The regret is that since this version is on DVD her real gem probably won't make it and it's worth whatever it costs.
If you want to see a first rate Salome on DVD get the one with Maria Ewing. When she drops the seventh veil you will join with King Herod and shout Wundervoil!",1064016000,53,1833,4.767295597484277

7965272,5,B000068UXG,"Malfitano and Bryn were wonderful together - as Jochanaan and Salome - and she also was electrifying in the dance of the seven viels and the final scene where she kisses the head of Jochanaan.

7965273,5,B000068UXG,"Catherine Malfitano was one of my favorite sopranos in her years at the Met. I missed her very much when she left there to sing more challenging roles. She is a trenchant Salome. Terfel has no rivals as a singing actor. I really like the Met Salome with Mattila, but Catherine is more exciting and daring.",1368057600,,305,4.464285714285714
7965274,5,B000068UXG,"This Salome is a terrifying and emotionally exhausting experience. Catherine Malifitano owns this role. Her acting is superb, both sexy and frightening and, as usual, she looks great...writhing around like a snake throughout. Vocally she rises to the demands of the final scene in spades. Part of this is due to the sensitive conducting of Dohnanyi and the wonderful ROHCG Orchestra. Terfel is the best John the Baptist on disc. His singing, as always, is powerful and his characterization of the half-mad prophet is spot on. He also looks the part...like a big, dirty fellow who spends all his time in the desert. All of the other singers are fine with a bit of luxury casting in Robert Gambill's Naraboth (the last time I saw him he was singing Tristan!). I also loved the production by Luc Bondy. Dark, creepy and totally humourless. Sets, costumes, and choreography are stellar. I know I'm in the minority, but I prefer this production to the German Opera Berlin version (even with Sinopoli's amazing conducting). The sound and picture are also very good. Enjoy.",1293408000,4,1066,4.927777777777778

7965276,5,B000068UXG,"Others have praised this Covent Garden Salome for its dramatic impact, and with good cause. The direcotr, Luc Bondy, has translated the opera into tortured terms that the painter Egon Schiele would recognize; the sexuality is masochistic, frenzied, and self-destructive. John the Baptist is no solemn stick of wood -- Bryn Terfel makes him as agonized and writhing as Salome herself. But the brunt of the Expressionist labor falls on the cat-like Malfitano, whose descent into madness is neither campy nor stagey. She's a great actress, and she adapts to the stylized movements straight out of Nosferatu with total conviction. (Only the opening scene is weak, since her girlish figure can't completely disguise that she is considerably too old to be the Judean princess.)

On the musical side, I'm willing to forgive a lot. Terfel is magnificent and dominates the stage with sheer vocal prowess. He may look like a  truck driver wrapped in a bath sheet, but all doubts disappear when he turns on the vocal charisma. Malfitano works from the opposite direction. Her voice, let's face it, is completely inadequate to the role except in terms of daring and stamina. She attacks every note fearlessly, even though her voice lacks the gleam, heft, and seductiveness that the role requires (as a result, the accompanying CD set from Decca, made with the Vienna Phil., cruelly exposed her vocal shortcomings). Without her petite frame and superb acting abilities, Malfitano wouldn't stand a chance. As the odious Herod and Herodias, Kenneth Riegel and Anja Silja (aka Mrs. Dohnanyi) are reliable, hammy stage veterans.

As for the conducting, Dohnanyi makes the Covent Garden orchestra play like gods -- he has always been strong in the opera pit -- but he draws back during the orgasmic outcries of Salome, in both the first and last scene. I imagine part of his reticence was an attempt to make things easier for Malfitano, but we the listeners are the losers.

With all these musical reservations, I sitll give five stars because of Terfel and the utterly convincing stage direction. This was one of the most gripping opera DVDs I've seen.",1207440000,14,2135,5.005633802816901
7965277,1,B000068UXG,"Please just watch the dance scene and tell me what is this? Here is the worst possible choreography and dance and design. Salome-Malfitano is rather a poor dancer girl or a Carmen than a princess! And she can't dance. She is almost comic with her awkward figures. It is a very very bad performance. If Salome would have danced like that, I think Herod would have died with dissapointment.",1202601600,3,388,4.63768115942029
7965278,4,B000068UXG,"5star highlights of this Covent Garden production are the closing twenty minutes of American Catherine Malfitano's singing of the title role -merciless intensity and voracious singing! - and the magnificent performance of Bryn Terfel as Jokanaan. We enjoyed seeing Malfitano's Cio-Cio San in Butterfly in San Francisco in the late nineties, and her singing here is even more engaged, more opened - a real success. There are aspects to her singing that can be bothersome at times; a lack of extravagant vocal reserves creates a sometimes monotonous approach to color, a feeling that she is always using everything she has, although she finds vocal color and drama aplenty in the closing scene. In general, however, It's hard to fault her Salome in this production - she's up to the task vocally and is a superb singing actor, one of the best around. Made for the camera (and the camera work here is unfailingly fine), Malfitano delivers a non-stop performance that exposes every nerve of Strauss' insane Princess. Terfel is as compelling a Jokanaan as I've ever heard - wild and devout and determined, plenty of physical braun and as musically committed a John the Baptist as might be possible. His singing is perfect, and his presence compelling. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, Dohnanyi's disengaged conducting and the formulaic blandness of the Covent Garden orchestra leaves a lot to be desired. Some of it seems to be the recorded sound which never rises to compete with the stage action, but I sense a lack of direction on Dohnanyi's part, surprising since I'm an admirer of his orchestral conducting in general. The evocative tension of Strauss' orchestral writing of the last half hour never materializes. Can't explain this misstep, but it noticably diminishes the vibrancy of the production. In contrast to some reviews on this page, Riegel's Herod is ardently sung - the arrogance of Herod's cravenness is striking and convincing, indicating not only acting chops but a bountiful, solid singing technique. If only the orchestra didn't sound as if it were on vacation! All in all, one of the best filmed Salomes available, superior by leagues to the redoubtable Maria Ewing's shouted version at the same house, and in my view, better than the Malfitano/Estes Berlin version, especially in the art design department. Here, the focus is completely on the singing drama, and is the better for it. After Deborah Voigt's very recent Chicago triumph in her first staged Salome, we can hope she will commit a performance to video disc. Don't hesitate with this one, however. It delivers the goods.",1167177600,13,2603,5.06993006993007
7965279,5,B000068UXG,"The performances are truly magnificent, most especially that of

Miss Malfitano. Well, I had no idea that John the Baptist could be

intensely fascinating and (pardon the word) SEXY as played by Terfel.

Highly recommended!",1163462400,4,223,5.314285714285714
