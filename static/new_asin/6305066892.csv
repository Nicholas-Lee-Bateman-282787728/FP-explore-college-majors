3417776,4,6305066892,Truly a film that stays with you for many years.  In my late teens I found this to be a very inspirational film.  It encouraged respect and discovery of native peoples and their ways and dealt with the often difficult issue  of faith communities and their relations with aboriginal peoples.,945820800,11,290,4.76
3417777,5,6305066892,"This is a wonderful story of finding faith. Beautifully directed and acted, it is one of the most unforgettable movies I've seen. I saw it first on television when it was shown in the 70's and it has stayed with me for  the past 20+ years. How many films does that? Forget the junvenile reviews  listed here. This is a mature and heartwrenching storie for adults with  dignity.",939772800,16,377,4.514705882352941
8270144,4,6305066892,"In 1973, the year of its American release, the book by Margaret Craven was adapted to the screen  as a CBS television movie of the same title, starring Tom Courtenay and Dean Jagger.  I remember seeing it then and being emotionally moved so that I have never forgotten this film although the book is much better.

It is the story of an Anglican priest ( played by Tom Courtenay (Now Sir Thomas Courtenay) who is sent by his bishop ( played by Dean Jagger) to a parish in an Indian village on the coast of Vancouver Island in Canada.  The lessons learned and challenges met by the priest are both  profound and chaotic. The bishop  hopes the villagers will change the priest and show him how to live a life  he has not not yet experienced.  How it plays out is both beautiful and sad.  Well acted by Courtenay the most memorable scenes are with Jagger as the bishop who wants the priest to experience meaning in living before ""time runs out.""  and the ""owl calls his name.""

I thought some of the natives were not good actors, but the village itself seemed real enough, and the scenes with the children hold our interest and warm our hearts.  All in all it is a story about how different cultures look at life from different viewpoints so that bridge building is needed so to better understand and share the earth with one another as well as all aspects of the life our environment provides. To me the best part of the movie is when one of the young village men tells the priest about how an eagle swooped down to catch a large fish.  The eagle could not get it's claws loose as the fish dove back in the water,  and so the eagle drowned.",1518048000,,1637,4.342105263157895
8270145,3,6305066892,It was pretty good for a low budget film. It had meaning to me.,1484956800,,63,3.5714285714285716
8270146,5,6305066892,"""I Heard the Owl Call My Name"" is a marvelous film that imparts an unforgettable story by way of an inside look at another culture. The scenery off the coast of Vancouver Island in Canada is fabulous. The characterizations are superb. After a viewing I feel grateful to the talents and humanitarianism that brought me the opportunity. So adult, so real. It's not for the comic book  aficionados.",1479945600,,395,4.8088235294117645

8270148,5,6305066892,Wonderful old film!,1408233600,2,19,5.666666666666667
8270149,4,6305066892,"The title deals with an Native American tradition that if you hear the owl call your name, you are going to die.
The priest who has been sick but is recovered is given a parish in an Indian village in the North Western fisher culture of Native Americans.
There he learns that the Western European culture may not be best
for everybody while developing a heart for the land.
The movie is a lot about dealing with life and with death in the modern world. While at times a little slow moving, I'll take this movie over
""The Bucket List"" any day for acting and understanding of the meaning of a life.",1230681600,17,596,4.330357142857143
8270150,5,6305066892,"Having lived in Alaska for 7 years after moving from Europe, I was pleasantly surprised when I found this film recently.  The film portrays the needed sensitivity to other cultures and shows how misguided we can be to judge cultures with our own values.  the simplicity and realism found in the story's plot makes for a moving experience as it is easy to relate to the priest's perspective.  As the film progresses you find your own feelings and prejudices are revealed and altered.

Definately recommended, prepare to be stuck by the elegance of this film.",1108684800,11,557,4.831578947368421
8270151,4,6305066892,"I'm an Alaska Native and grew up in a small town in the Southeast.  I'm in my early 50's now, and many times I moved to ""the lower 48"" to work or live with family.  Very strange-- There is an urging when you're younger to move outside of Alaska because it's so remote compared to Stateside.  You miss all the malls and variety of places to eat and things to do.  After living south for a while, I would start missing the trees, mountain, streams and water where I grew up.  When I would become fed up with living south, on some channel on tv, I would find this movie!  I would see the trees, all the water and beauty, and within a short time I'd be packing to return to Alaska!  This movie became my signal more than a few times to return home.  Anyway, I enjoyed the movie and listening to the older people in the village reminded me of my own elders as I grew up in Alaska.  I love this movie, the only reason it got one star less is because I wish they would have put out the mini series copy instead of the movie length version.  Hoka Hey!  And enjoy!",1087948800,12,1055,4.072815533980583
8270152,2,6305066892,"""I Heard The Owl Call My Name"" was shown as a television mini-series in 1973. It was wonderful, and I'm afraid the tape I just received is a chopped up, over-edited and miserable version. The events, characters and dialog are the video less-than equivalent of Cliff Notes. Wish I hadn't wasted my money  No quality with this release, that's for certain.",1055635200,7,353,4.786885245901639
8270153,5,6305066892,"My wife and I live in a primarily Native Alaskan Communmity far north of where this movie took place.  But the setting and the people and the rich profile of a primarily-subsistence, Native community seems to be right on  target.  All of the actors do a first-rate job, and the movie is a fine  blend of aspirations,and idealism with the realities of Bush Alaska life.  We watch it every Christmas and often times inbetween.  Enjoy!",946080000,36,432,4.693333333333333
