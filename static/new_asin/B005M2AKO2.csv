4834006,5,B005M2AKO2,This was a gift for my folks. They are very pleased and they call me to thank me after watching each movie.,1361404800,,107,3.909090909090909
4834007,5,B005M2AKO2,"There are so many movies to choose from!  My nephews were delighted with their gift. When they are happy, I am happy.",1360022400,,117,4.318181818181818
4834008,5,B005M2AKO2,"I love it because you get a lot of movies inexpensively.  They sound like they'll be pretty good movies; however, I've not had a chance to watch any as yet.",1359676800,,156,4.2
4834009,5,B005M2AKO2,I liked these movies very much .They give every one something they would like .The movie set is also economical with top of the line movies.. I would recommend these movies 100% for all.,1358899200,,186,4.5
4834010,5,B005M2AKO2,"the quality of these movies are not great for a large screen due to so many being on one disc, however, we have enjoyed them on our 20 inch just fine",1358294400,,149,3.838709677419355
4834011,4,B005M2AKO2,"We have watched all of the movies and found only 1or2 that were not quite as good as all the rest
not bad when you get them in such a big pack, would reckamend to any family",1357689600,,173,3.7027027027027026
4834012,3,B005M2AKO2,"This collection of mostly made-for-TV movies is a lot better than you'd expect for the price. (That said, you can pick this up at any Walmart or K-Mart for $5, so don't buy it here.).

The standouts, each of which is worth the $5 alone, are ""To Brave Alaska,"" with Alyssa Milano and Cameron Bancroft as a couple stuck in the freezing Alaska wilderness, ""Rugged Gold,"" with Jill Eikenberry and Art Hindle as a couple stuck in the freezing Alaska wilderness, and ""Snowbound: The Jim and Jennifer Stolpa Story,"" with Neil Patrick Harris and Kelli Williams as a couple stuck in the freezing American wilderness.

Noticing a pattern here? Good. That's just what prolific movie repackager Echo Bridge wants you to notice. EB is very good at two things: Grouping similarly themed movies, and doing it over and over again in different packages, so you have to sometimes own three copies of the same movie in order to get copies of all the movies you'd like. How annoyingly douchy of them.

Anyway, enough of the movies in this collection, including those named above, are engrossing enough that you won't feel bad for shelling out the fin for them, nor for investing the time to watch them.

Alyssa Milano is a much better actress here than you'd expect. And it's nice to see someone cast Jill Eickenberry in a movie simply because she can act, instead of finding someone less talented, but more attractive. And Art Hindle will remind you enough of Robert Redford that you'll wish they actually cast Robert Redford, except we all know that Robert Redford would never appear in a movie as the love interest of Jill Eickenberry, because, really, in Jill's dreams, know what I'm sayin'?

The other movies in this collection are OK, but nothing to tweet about.",1347321600,23,1748,4.755775577557756

4834018,3,B005M2AKO2,"Most of the movies are ok, though most are definitely LOW budget.  White Fang is probably one of the better films in this pack.
""Red Fury"" is very poor quality and blurry.  ""Tom Alone"" is also not well made--the night scenes are very hard to see, and thus make
the story hard to follow.",1422230400,,286,4.277777777777778

4834020,4,B005M2AKO2,"Bought for the wife, this 10 movie series is an epic of wholesome entertainment.  Great stories, not full of extreme violence and sex like most everything that is produced today. I enjoy the fact that you can actually sit back with a bowl of popcorn, with the family, to watch movies that were made to entertain and portray some moral values.  Recommend it for families with young kids.",1421366400,2,386,4.661764705882353
