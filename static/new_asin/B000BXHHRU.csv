8093747,5,B000BXHHRU,This video was very helpful to develop my goalie last year.  Lots of simple straightforward drills that help develop goalie skill and conditioning.  By the end of the season I was able to see notable gains in my goalie's awareness and reaction time to shots on goal.  I definitely recommend this to development of middle school level goalies though I would say that it may require some personal tweaks to fit certain practice conditions.  Scaffolding to the experience level of goalies is key as well.,1414195200,,501,4.858823529411764

8093749,4,B000BXHHRU,"34 SOCCER GOALIE DRILLS is a quality video about 36-38 minutes in length. I took it out of my local library and went ahead and purchased the DVD from Amazon based on the strength of the content. Each drill is described by a voice over narrator.

The drills have names like: Soft Hands, Sit Up & Catch, Circle Drill, Fundamental Diving and One Fisted Box to name a few. Each of the drills descriptions are done very well as it is synched perfectly with the visual action you are viewing. I would recommend this program for soccer teams from ages 8-18. Each of the drills can be adjusted to the age and skill of the players. An excellent residual benefit of this program is some of the drills the teams are doing to test the goalie. Have your remote ready to stop, replay and slow motion.",1397692800,,786,4.383561643835616
8093750,1,B000BXHHRU,"I am right now doing research to find some good DVDs for my youngest son, who plays soccer in a U9 Academy team, and loves to play goalie.

I am finding out that practically all positive reviews for this product, and for all Marty Schupak products, are fake. The techniques used are pretty interesting. First, the basic shills: 5-star reviewers who review positively all Marty Schupak products. Then, to make it more believable, reviewers who only give 4 stars, but still spend their reviewing careers positively reviewing Marty Schupak products.

Where you reach real hutzpah is when Marty Schupak uses some of his shills to actually comment on *REAL REVIEWERS* who pan his products, by criticizing the actual reviewer! Now that's a beauty. Another interesting approach (see Peter Ramos below) is to have a shill comment on how there are good and bad reviews of the product, but he personally finds is quite good, although not quite as good as the 5-star reviews say! But, if you check Peter Ramos, he also has the track record of a Marty Schupak shill :-)

Here is the list of reviewers that I believe to be shills for this DVD: Midwest Book Review (50,000 reviews, all positive...), Sports Spirit, Rita Derosa, Robert Scott, Peter Ramos, Carl Smith, Louis Trent, Mark Depeter, Victor Green, Mark Wilson, and E. DeRosa - that's practically all the good reviews for this DVD.

On the other hand, the bad reviews are all Amazon verified purchases...

So far, the best reviewed DVD I have found is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Keeper-Soccer-Safekeeping-with-Coach-Tony-Waiters/dp/B00030A69C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Keeper!

8093751,4,B000BXHHRU,"Well rounded excercises and drills in a fast pace viseo. Intructions are short and to the point, drills are executed in a back yard making any grassy area a place to practice. Very good.",1291680000,,186,4.5
8093752,5,B000BXHHRU,"Reading mixed reviews, I first went to Amazon's Video On Demand
program and paid $1.99 for a seven day download.  It was the best two
bucks I ever spent. I then went out and bought 2 copies for my brother
who coaches goalies in a Division Three college in the Northeast. He loved the program and insists
the positives outweigh any negatives. His goalies were already familiar with
a few of the drills but used the others and even improvised to create some new ones.
Our goalies on our youth level team also practiced the drills and techniques
and we saw improvement throughout the season.  If you have any doubt, do what I did
for the $1.99 then you decide.
VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

8093753,1,B000BXHHRU,"I have been coaching and playing keeper for over 30 years I have been researching video's for training goalkeepers and coaches and this one is not very good.  First you need to have all players involved in proper equipment.
They have one keeper in tennis shoes.  It is shot and put together very shoddy. When a keeper makes a mistake in technique and there are many they don't correct it.
It is designed to give you a set number of drills that is it.  The drills are very basic.  It shows some technique correctly but I would not recommend it for any coach or player learning to train or play keeper.",1258416000,6,600,4.378378378378378
8093754,1,B000BXHHRU,"Unless you are desperate for new drills, don't waste your money on this DVD. The drills are OK, but that's about it. Ball handling is terrible. Who wants to watch drills, where the technique is wrong.",1254182400,3,200,4.583333333333333
