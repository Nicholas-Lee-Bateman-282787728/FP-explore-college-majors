You will not be feeling that way as it progresses. The movie tells a fictionalized account of the building of the technically remarkable Qingzang railroad across Tibet that reaches altitudes of over 16,000 ft in places. There are serious political issues about why China devoted so much to this task, and about its consequences for Tibet.  The movie ignores this, promoting the idea of a unity between the Tibetan and Chinese people, as it focuses almost entirely on the commitment and determination of the average worker. There clearly is a message being sent here to promote the virtue of the project.

The movie tells its story through a few characters whose lives are wound up in the 50 year struggle to build the railway. It is certainly melodramatic to western eyes, but because the movie is by the Chinese and not a Hollywood depiction of China, it feels a lot more like you are seeing something real. The dimensions of honor, family, sacrifice, stoic endurance of hardship, and loyalty to the larger duty are front and center. Yes it is different, at wouldn't work as a U.S. movie, but then, it isn't a movie from the U.S.

The high, remote scenery is awesome. The characters emerge as human and appealing and there a surprising intensity of emotion. The overall effect is endearing.
