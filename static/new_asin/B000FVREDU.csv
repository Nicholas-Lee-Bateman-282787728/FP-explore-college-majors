Bought two of these for my grandson at Christmas, started watching the first one, God made light, and all the adults were staring at the tv in utter shock, me in embarrassment and the 15 month old left the room. I didn't even open this one. So very disappointed. Luckily, the 15 month old didn't really know to be excited in order to be disappointed. Turned on a baby cartoon and he stopped his crawling and turned to watch. That was ""attention grabbing"".",1482105600,,595,4.518518518518518
