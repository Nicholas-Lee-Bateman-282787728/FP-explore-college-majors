7516583,5,B017RYWWXE,"Kym Johnson's 5678 Fitness DVD is a fun dance workout for anyone! There are 4 different dance styles Cha Cha, Jive, Paso Doble, & Salsa/Samba Fusion to choose from that allow for a variety in the workout. It is a Great Cardio workout when all 4 dance routines are done back to back. Kym also included a Total Body Workout if you want some bonus exercises. Kym is great at teaching dance and fun to follow along throughout this DVD.  I highly recommend 5678 Fitness to anyone wanting a fun workout. This is great for beginners of dance and fitness too. I hope her next Fitness DVD builds on this DVD by building on the skill level from this DVD to a more advance level in dance routines in regards to new dance steps or extending the length of the dance routines. I Love this DVD!",1454630400,4,779,4.335616438356165
7516584,5,B017RYWWXE,"If you ever wanted to learn how to Cha Cha, Salsa or other Latin dances this is the DVD for you. I love coming home to practice my dance routines.  Kym's video shows you how to dance using fun steps and you burn calories. The video also includes a total body workout.  So start your year on the Right foot and DANCE.  5-6-7-8",1454630400,,325,4.126984126984127
7516585,5,B017RYWWXE,"I loved taking Kym's classes on DWTS: at sea and I have purchased the other DWTS work out DVDs. This is easy to follow along and she is a great instructor. The DVD is broken into dance modules so you can mix-and-match workouts so you don't get bored.  My only complaint is that there isn't a compilation of the whole workout like her class is designed.
Otherwise a great addition to your workout dvd collection - especially if you love to dance!",1453593600,3,445,4.426829268292683
7516586,3,B017RYWWXE,"Love that Kym Johnson created an exercise video! Fans will totally get a kick out of this!

This is set up into different sections, a warm up, different dances, a cool down, and some extras like ab work.
The warm up and cool down are different moves like the grapevine, which she teaches if you do not know, to help warm or cool, whatever you need at that moment. The moves are pretty easy and are the perfect setup for getting ready to begin, or end, your exercise.
The dances are all quite fun. A bit slow for my taste. My normal is kick boxing but I still really enjoyed the different dance moves. The music goes with the dances, the Paso Doble was my fav!

Definitely has a few fun routines. Would suggest this be for beginners or someone trying to supplement another harder workout. I don't think I will use as my go to fitness routine.",1453420800,16,841,4.3164556962025316
7516587,5,B017RYWWXE,Love Kym on Dancing with the Stars and now she brings her dances moves to your home! I love how the segments are short so if you don't have time to dedicate to a full workout you can still get some exercise in!,1453334400,4,210,3.9069767441860463

8740431,2,B017RYWWXE,"I purchased the download version from her website. Kym is a nice person, but I found this DVD quite boring.  Moderate workout, music is so-so only and the 2 people dancing behind her look totally uninterested.",1494547200,,209,4.805555555555555
