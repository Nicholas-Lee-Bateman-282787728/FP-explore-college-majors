3912933,5,B002DU39IU,"This is my favorite Nora Roberts movie!  It is wondefully done and is not to be missed. Whether or not you believe in haunted southern mansions or not, when you watch this movie, you have to consider the possiblity.  What a beautiful southern mansion.  The main charactors, have great actresses and actors behaind them.  Bravo for the screen play!",1277078400,2,347,4.830508474576271
3912934,4,B002DU39IU,"I actually really liked this one, suspensefull, interesting and compelling. I would recommend this movie over any of the other Nora Roberts Movie.",1266192000,,146,5.391304347826087
3912935,1,B002DU39IU,I love most Nora Roberts' books and have thought several of the movie adaptations were ok.  But this one seemed really to left field of the book what with active ghosts and fortune tellers.  I could have handled that if there had been some believable sparks between the main characters.  I most likely won't be buying more of her movies.,1264550400,,337,4.583333333333333
3912936,4,B002DU39IU,"I like all of the movies in the Nora Roberts collection!  If you're a woman, it's almost sacriligious not to.  I especially liked this one as it is set in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina.  That being said, the crazy ""plot twist"" of the male lead being reincarnated as a woman and the female lead being reincarnated as man, was a little off-putting -- hence, the four stars instead of five.  Faye Dunnaway is superb as the spooky grandmother.",1264464000,3,445,4.594936708860759
3912937,5,B002DU39IU,"This is a great mystery/ghost story of the old South.  It was filmed in New Orleans and at Oak Alley which is one of my favorite plantations on the Old River Road in Louisiana.  The setting is New Orleans as it is now, still struggling to rebuild parts of the city since the Hurricane.  The plot includes some of the history of life on the old plantations,  intertwined with the lives of two modern lovers, with a real twist toward the end.  The scenery is beautiful and the plot keeps your interest all the way through.  After seeing the dvd myself, I invited my whole family over to see it.  Very enjoyable Gothic suspense.",1259884800,2,625,4.4298245614035086
3912938,5,B002DU39IU,Loved Nora Roberts' 2009 collection..all great movies!! Would recommend to anyone!!! Definitely a must see!!!,1258329600,,109,6.333333333333333
3912939,3,B002DU39IU,"This is certainly an odd movie. It is a romance/thriller - not particularly scary, but maybe not a date movie either. Much of the plot is driven by historical events and pseudo reincarnation. Despite that, the movie is somewhat entertaining. The plot takes a few interesting twists and turns. The acting is passable, if not great. Obviously, the whole ordeal requires you to suspend disbelief (spirits, love at first sight, etc.), but if you do this movie turns out to be not so bad.",1256601600,,483,4.761904761904762
3912940,4,B002DU39IU,"This movie is based on a Nora Roberts novel, I believe of the same title.  It is set in modern day New Orleans, although, there are some antebellum elements as the two lead characters encounter spirits of the past.  The lead romantic interest is a Boston lawyer who decides to move into an antebellum mansion down South.  And the girl is a descendant of the original family who lived in ""the big house"" back in the day.  Her heritage seems to haunt her and that of her family.  As her Mother is very much troubled.  Eventually things get resolved, but not before some spooky events take place! The ending leaves the fate of the Mother unresolved which is one of my main complaints of the movie.  Also, there is some mild cussing and a very passionate love scene that I could have done without.",1256515200,,793,4.465277777777778
3912941,5,B002DU39IU,"This was a great movie! I love a good ghost story, especially with a love story involved...and it was set in the South! It can't get much better! As a Southerner myself, I can't help but be drawn to any movie/story that takes place in the South. The chemistry between the two main characters is great! No, there is no Oscar winning performance and it is a little cliche at times, but it's a good Sunday afternoon, curl up on the couch kinda movie. I enjoyed it tremendously and can't wait for the dvd!",1254268800,2,501,4.340425531914893
3912942,5,B002DU39IU,"THIS MOVIE IS A REALLY GOOD MOVIE, REGARDS OF WHAT THE LAST REVIEW WAS. IT IS A COMMON MOVIE LIKE THE REST BUT IT WAS PLAYED REALLY GOOD.

3912960,4,B002DU39IU,"To be honest I am fascinated with the plantation house in Louisiana where this was filmed so when I found this movie I signed up. The scenery was beautiful but I thought the story line a little disjointed. I suppose if I'd read the book I would have known what was going on but as it was, I had the feeling that I'd missed something and in general felt ho-hum throughout. I've read some of Nora Robert's books so I'm fairly certain the book was better than the movie. Sorry..... but this is my opinion so there you have it.",1479254400,,523,4.24

3912992,5,B002DU39IU,"LOVE Nora Roberts, #1 favorite author.  This story has everything:  romance, mystery, ghosts; her characters, as usual, are bright, witty, intelligent, humorous, moral, intense, and fiercely loyal to their relationships, courageous, with a huge capacity for love and willing to accept things and people outside of their experience.  I purchased this through my Prime, but the quality of the picture was not at all good, not sharp or clear.  Amazon, of course, having EXCELLENT customer service, refunded me because of the poor quality of the picture.  I would highly recommend purchase of this movie on DVD, however, as the story is wonderful and the quality is great.",1440633600,4,668,5.205607476635514

That being said, it is not as good as the book and of course things were left out of the movie that were in the book, however, unlike some of the other reviews that were mixed because it was not exactly like the book, I believe the adaption was done well.  You could never fit a whole book into a 2 hour movie and some things just do not adapt well from book to movie so they must be left out. To rate a movie solely on the fact that it was not exactly like the book would be unfair.  All in all it is an excellent movie to watch.",1401235200,4,599,3.814516129032258

Legend has it that the house is haunted, and shortly after Declan moves in he starts hearing voices and seeing things. Declan is also distracted by an undeniable attraction to Cajun local Lena Simone, who grew up on the bayou with her grandmother Odette and has her own deep connection to the manor.

Living in the house, Declan begins to have visions from a century past and details of events that took place in the mansion. With the help of Odette, Declan and Lena realize that they are inextricably linked with Manet Hall and uncover a shocking secret that has been hidden there for more than 100 years.",1392681600,,802,4.804347826086956

3913051,3,B002DU39IU,"Although this movie was ok it didn't do the book justice.  For anyone who has watched this movie I would highly recommend reading the book.  The book is very well written as only Nora Roberts can do.  This screenplay was lacking, lackluster, and they have changed a couple of things that shouldn't have been changed.  I was excited to see this on amazon then after watching I was somewhat disappointed.",1365638400,,402,4.7

3913062,5,B002DU39IU,I found this movie to be very entertaining and it's one of the few I've purchased.  I plan on seeing it again and recommend it to others.

I only wish I know how to find out the name of the song that was playing when Lauren Stamile was driving out to see her grandmother in the opening of the movie.,1347408000,,370,3.9864864864864864

Especially those that love nora roberts books.",1317600000,,187,4.5
3913069,5,B002DU39IU,"I just got through watching this on Lifetime and, not the hugest Nora Roberts fan, I was impressed with this film adaptation.  Not only was it a good made-for-TV story, but the cast was actually TALENTED!  I don't believe in reincarnation but, a lot like the movie Dead Again, I found the story line riveting and was glued to it in both a romantic and haunted house way.  It was a cool twist to have the romantic leading man once having been a woman and vice versa, because that was a curve ball definitely not foreseen.  Faye Dunaway was cool as spooky grandma; also, there are some beautiful shots of New Orleans that are virtually like an appealing travel brochure.  If you want to get a man to watch something ordinarily considered a chick flick, pick this movie out.  You may find that, for once, he's not cringing at the end.",1308441600,9,831,4.470198675496689
