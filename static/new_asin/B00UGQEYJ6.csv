8706430,5,B00UGQEYJ6,"This episode of America's Game The Superbowl Champions brings you the story of the 1977 Dallas Cowboys. With an imaginative, high-scoring offensive and a crushing defense, Dallas cruised through the regular season, the playoffs and the Superbowl.

The story of the 1977 Cowboys is told by Tony Dorsett, Thomas Henderson, Charlie Waters and Drew Pearson and each relate contribute to the story of their championship season. Each former player is able to offer insights (often humorous!) into their championship run.

Tony Dorsett, Heisman Trophy winner, was the super-rookie that everyone expected to be the final piece of the puzzle in Dallas' return to championship form. It took him a while to learn the complex Dallas offense, but when he did, he was exciting to watch! Thomas Henderson was the maverick who gave himself his own nickname of ""Hollywood Henderson"" and rubbed everyone the wrong way!

Charlie Waters was the safety who was the leader of the ""Doomsday Defense"" anchored by a defensive line composed of Harvey Martin, Randy White and Ed ""Too Tall"" Jones. Waters was the brain behind Doomsday who kept all the ""personalities"" working. Drew Pearson was Mr. Clutch because when team leader Roger Staubach needed a pass completion, he looked for the man who gave clutch performances when the game was on the line.

These very different men talk about the struggles, the successes and the eventual victory in Superbowl XII in which the often hated Dallas Cowboys rode to victory with a powerful defense and a well-executed offense. This is an excellent DVD that goes beyond the usual highlights to the stories behind the scenes that affected the team and, in the end, drove them to victory.
