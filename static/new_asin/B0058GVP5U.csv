With the release of the superb 'A Separation', director Ashgar Farhadi has done much to open peoples' eyes that Iran is a much more complex society than has generally been perceived in the West. The film's title might lead one to believe that this story is merely about the separation of a husband and wife but it's much more than that--at times I felt I was watching a Hitchcock-like thriller, with all the attendant twists and turns associated with the suspense master himself.

In a sense, the separation between Nader and Simin, the secular middle class couple who are seen at the beginning of the film in a divorce court, is the catalyst for all the stunning developments to come. Because the judge rejects Simin's application for a divorce, she returns to her parents' home and leaves Nader, along with their eleven year old daughter Termeh (magnificently played by Sarina Farhadi, the director's real-life daughter) to care for Nader's Alzheimer's-stricken father.

Nader is the film's protagonist and should be seen as an admirable and complex character. Some may view him as foolhardy to continue taking care of his father, virtually on his own, but his decision is a testament to the strength and nobility of his character. Note the subtle scene where he orders Termeh to return a tip to a gas station attendant, after the attendant fails to perform a required service, thus teaching his daughter not only the value of hard work but also to be assertive (especially in a society where women are not always encouraged to be like that).

The film's antagonist, Razieh, is also a complex character. She shows up at Nader's house with her young daughter, having agreed to work as a domestic, taking care of Nader's father. Razieh is from a lower middle class background, dresses in a conservation Chador and ends up consulting a religious phone hot line, asking for advice whether it's against Muslim religious law to wash Nader's father. Even when the Iman tells her that she's permitted to do so, she understandably has a very hard time performing such unsavory work.

Nonetheless, Razieh uses remarkably poor judgment by tying up Nader's father and leaving the home to keep a doctor's appointment. Perhaps it's her unfamiliarity with elderly people stricken with Alzheimer's, that leads her to believe that such a senile man will be okay on his own, while she leaves the home. It's also quite understandable that Nader ends up quite upset to find Razieh gone and his father on the floor, hardly breathing. When Razieh returns, he berates her, discovers money missing and concludes that she was responsible for stealing it. What Nader wasn't aware of, was that Simin had earlier paid movers with the money. Now it's Razieh's turn to become upset as she's been falsely accused of stealing the money and then makes things worse in Nader's eyes, for requesting her day's pay. We break into Act 2, when Nader pushes Razieh out the door, leading her to accuse him of causing the miscarriage of her baby.

The ensuing complications are too detailed to list here but let me say that director Farhadi has done a masterful job in chronicling the day to day operations of the Iranian justice system. Again, it's a nuanced portrait of a Judge who seems almost bored by being forced to sit through one conflicting domestic situation after another as well as revealing an attitude of inflexibility in applying the vagaries of the Iranian penal code. Nonetheless, it's not a complete kangaroo court, as investigations do seem to be ordered and there is a modicum of an attempt to ascertain the true facts.

While we do learn Nader is found to have lied to the court when he denies knowing that Razieh was pregnant, even Termeh realizes that sometimes 'white lies' are necessary and perjures herself before the Court, to ensure that her father doesn't go to prison and his life is not ruined.

Equally fascinating is Razieh's husband Hodjat's machinations in his quest for justice, which ends up more like a thirst for revenge. Hodjat represents the dark side of the Iranian populace. He's a hothead, who will take extra-judicial steps including threatening Termeh's tutor, who testified in Nader's defense. Hodjat is so menacing that the tutor even changes her testimony which jeopardizes Nader's case. Hodjat still is operating under the mistaken belief that his wife's claims are legitimate but when we learn that Razieh lost the baby because she was hit by a car (while outside looking for Nader's father who had wandered out of the house), Razieh's honor becomes much more questionable than that of her husband. After all, Razieh refuses to swear on the Koran, not because she's ashamed of accusing an innocent man, but because she fears that by testifying falsely, Allah may seek revenge on her and her daughter for her sins.

It's up to Simin to finally convince Nader to compensate Razieh's family. While Nader earlier casts Simin as someone who too easily runs away from difficult conflicts, he realizes the only way out is to compromise and pay compensation to Razieh's family. Of all the characters in the film, Simin is perhaps the most thinly drawn. Why does she want to leave Iran? Is it because she's tired of taking care of Nader's father? We don't find out that much about her but when she and Nader argue, the scenes are electric.

Justice is finally served when Razieh refuses to swear on the Koran. As the legitimacy over Razieh's initial accusation and Nader's debt to her family is resolved, the subplot concerning the pending custody of Termeh is not. We're left to guess which parent Termeh chooses to live with at film's end.

'A Separation' is a superb film which, if it only could be, should not only be nominated for Best Foreign language film but for the Academy's 'Best Picture' as well.",1327708800,15,5852,4.859578736208626
4598273,5,B0058GVP5U,"The Iranian film ""A Separation"" will most likely win this year's Oscar for Best Foreign Film, and has already won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film as well as best film at the Berlin International Film Festival. ""A Separation"" is writer and director Asghar Farhadi's fifth film, and it's the one that will establish him as one of the world's most brilliant storytellers.

The title ostensibly refers to an urban middle class couple who have separated from each other; English teacher Simin has gotten a visa to emigrate to the West, but her husband Nader, who works in a bank, refuses to leave his father who has Alzheimer's. They have an 11-year-old daughter Termeh (played by the director's daughter) who doesn't want her parents to leave each other, and so chooses to stay with her father, knowing that Simin won't leave Iran without her.

But the title also refers to the rural-urban, traditional-modern, moral-utilitarian divides that coalesce to form the main conflict in this movie. After Simin leaves to live with her parents, Nader hires a villager named Razieh to look after his father. Looking after a male patient with dementia is too much for the pregnant Razieh, who must commute three hours to work. When Nader's father soils his pants, the profoundly pious Razieh has a crisis of faith, and seeks religious counsel to see if God will permit her to change the poor man's pants. She's underpaid and exhausted, but ultimately she's bound to the family's misfortunes by her own: her husband has lost his job as a cobbler, has to take medication for the consequent depression, and is in and out of debtors' prison. One day, Nader returns home to find Razieh absent and his father tied to the bed, and he becomes so distraught and angry that he fires Razieh by pushing her out the door. Then Nader and Simin find themselves in a hospital where they learn that Razieh has had a miscarriage. The two families entangle themselves in a legal fight to determine who was culpable for Razieh's miscarriage, and in the process dig themselves deeper and deeper into a moral conundrum.

Farhadi manages several neat tricks with this movie. ""A Separation"" is morally complex without being morally confusing, is dramatically tense and emotionally powerful without being melodramatic and emotionally overwhelming, and is sympathetic to all characters and viewpoints while affirming the power of truth and love.

Farhadi accomplishes this by building strong contrasts and comparisons between the three sets of characters. There's the two wives Simin and Razieh, while standing with their husbands and across from each other, nevertheless are devout to the ""truth"" (Simin to a modern and metaphysical ""truth,"" Razieh to the Koran), and thus stood together throughout the film.

Then there's the two families' daughters who live in different worlds. One scene in a court of law outside the judge's chambers captures how irreconcilable this chasm really is: While waiting for their parents, Termeh is pre-occupied studying for her final exams with the help of her grandmother, while Razieh's 6-year-old daughter looks on with sad bright eyes, having never been inside a classroom and knowing she'll never get into one. But despite their differences they're both united by a child-like attachment to what is right, what is fair, and what is true - an innocence that makes them equally suffer as the film sinks into its moral murkiness.

What ultimately drives the plot of the film is the conflict between the two husbands, who are tragically alike. Razieh's husband Hodjat is consumed with anger at his poverty and powerlessness, and he becomes more volatile and violent as he seeks justice for his wife and his unborn child, but feels helpless against a modern middle class urban society that seems to have united against his family. Simin's husband Nader is consumed by pride, which ironically makes this secular man a fanatic, as he seeks to prove his innocence, even if he has to lie, conspire, and abandon his wife to do so.

Besides using vivid characterization, Farhadi also manages to balance the complexity, contradictions, and conflicts by filming minimally in interiors. Every scene is either shot inside an apartment or a hospital or a court or a school or a car. He doesn't use wide angles to allow the audience to breathe a bit, nor does he attempt to control mood with music, color, and lighting. But the film's claustrophobia works to the story's advantage, magnifying and reflecting the tension and the anxiety in the characters themselves.

What ultimately makes this movie work so well then are the individual performances of all the actors. In his book The Ends of the Earth, Robert Kaplan argues that Westerners have a misconception of Iranians as cold and aloof Muslims, while in reality they're poetic and passionate Persians - which is perhaps why they often make such gifted actors.

Towards the climax of the movie, Simin has negotiated a truce with Hodjat to pay ""blood money"" for the miscarriage so that the feuding can stop its downward spiral. Simin and Termeh, who is now living with her mother, go tell the good news to Nader in his apartment. Arguing that by paying he would profess his guilt, he refuses, and Simin walks out angrily. She attempts to take Termeh with her, but Termeh refuses. The 11 year-old fears his father's lies and equivocations, but above all she fears losing him, and so she tries to convince his father to take the deal. Then Nader says to her in that cold calculating manner only he's capable of: ""If you think I'm guilty go get your mother, and I'll do what she wants.""

Termeh's facial response powerfully captures so many hues and shades: It's at the same time loud and numb, stunned and aware, hurt and empowered. That one-second facial expression, caught between crying and laughing, reveals that if no one else has changed, she at least has. And she now knows that no matter how much she loves her father he's lost to her and to himself.

""A Separation"" is a bold masterpiece of Iranian film-making.",1327622400,135,6061,4.920743639921722
4598274,5,B0058GVP5U,"Assalam-u-Alaikum to all,

This film has become one of my all times favorite. From the plot to the directorial point of view, Asghar Farhadi's approach in explaining the painful process of achieving divorce is concrete and solid. Climaxes are breathtaking and heart pounding, and the acting is just phenomenal. I hope to add it into my collection as soon it is available in consumer market.

4598296,5,B0058GVP5U,"An extremely well-made film, a riveting story line,  superb acting.  It was like being dropped in the middle of a family dispute and then a dispute with another family that was other kinds of problems.  One family is well-educated and upper class while the other is working class and debt-ridden.  Their lives become entangled in a criminal court case.  The husband of the wealthier family is accused of  pushing the wife of the other and causing her to miscarry.  The scenes before the judges are fascinating both for the similarities in the kinds of disputes but also at how close the judge is both in physical presence and in his intense questioning in trying to get to the truth.  The laws and customs are different but that doesn't mean they are not designed to achieve the same goals of justice and social order.  It appears more direct with everyone making their own case without the lawyers in the middle dragging things out.

The  case between the two families is finally resolved but we were left hanging without a resolution to the situation of estrangement.  By the end, we could see how much they all cared for each other and wanted them to find a way to stay together and be happy.  This  film does what any good drama does.

This film is about the separation of a couple, one who wants to leave her country for her daughter, and a man who feels compelled to stay and take care of his ailing father, who has Alzeheimer's Disease.  The husband needs to hire daytime help for his father.  He then settles on a woman who is pregnant and an accident at the home occurs when an accusation of theft begins.  We see the stress filled caregiving to his father, who does not speak anymore.  One can feel the pressure of tension and build-up.

The movie, by writer and director, Asghar Farhadi,  is fast-paced, tension-filled, complex, mysterious, and dramatic.  There is a lot of dialogue here, so read quickly.  The scenes are vivid, and they depict the story's background in a compelling way.

This is a lengthy movie, with a great storyline, excellent characters, and keeps one on his toes watching this.

Mainly, I found great similarities of life in Iran  to life in the U.S. in an unanticipated way, since little is known of everyday life in a major Iranian city.  During the very frequent flare-ups and shouting matches of a young family that has become recently dysfunctional because of problems with in-laws, home care aides, and children, my attention began to wonder.  I started to notice trivial details in the sets while waiting for the Farsi shouting to cease.  I began to feel that this Iranian middle-class apartment seemed as if it could be in an ethnic enclave in any major American city.  (They had refrigerator magnets, and reproductions of classic Western art on their walls.)  Frequent scenes took place in bureaucratic offices manned by overworked minor officials who tried to be sympathetic, like real human beings, not zealots shouting anti-U.S. slogans.  The plot was easily universal and reminded me of past experiences with elderly parents, divorce, and child care.  And that of course means that the Iranians had no better solution to unsolvable problems than we have.",1414972800,,1166,5.06282722513089

4598386,4,B0058GVP5U,"I'd been meaning to see this film ever since I'd found out that it'd won the 2012 Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film.  After seeing the trailer -- i wasn't sure that I'd find it interesting.  But once I started watching -- I found it to be completely absorbing.  There are two sides to every story -- And getting to the bottom of each individual's notion of truth, and consequently examining the relevance of resentments that arise during interpersonal conflicts -- Ends up being the main theme of this movie.  What at first appear to be lies -- Often disguise deeper truths that can't be readily revealed -- Due to potential collisions with real life institutions / bureaucracies that frequently disregard personal integrity.  One also wonders how anyone would be able to get justice by means of a chaotic court system such as the one depicted in this film.

I was impressed with the intricate plot development of this movie which keeps one on the edge of one's seat.  In the conflict between the two husbands -- Nader (Peyman Moaadi) and Hodjat (Shahab Hosseini) -- The threat of violence and personal retribution looms and the two men struggle to remain rational.  Due to his longstanding unemployment & considerable debts -- Hodjat is at the end of his rope and ready to snap.  Each of the characters has to make tough decisions about how to set aside their own ulterior motives and to ultimately ""do the right thing"".  Each has to see through their own justifications and instead defer to the ""higher versions"" of their respective selves.  Fortunately -- The inherent honesty and goodness of the characters comes to the forefront.

I hadn't been previously familiar with any of the actors in this movie.  Suffice it to say that the cast was uniformly excellent.  Noteworthy was the performance of Sareh Bayat (Razieh) -- Who despite having the chance put her husband's finances in order with ""blood money"" -- Decides that to do so would saddle them with negative karma.  This movie offers no easy solutions regarding ""the game of life"".  As the closing credits roll by -- One of the characters is faced with yet another tough decision.  Thus the film ends with the message ..... That life is full of endless problems waiting to be resolved.

4598388,5,B0058GVP5U,"THE FILM: This is my first film from the Middle East (Iran, specifically), and I am amazed at the dramatic complexity and commitment to realism that Asghar Farhadi created in A SEPARATION. The story concerns a couple who divorces when the mother wants to leave Iran, but the father decides to stay behind with his Alzheimer's-suffering father. What follows is a compelling drama about divorce and its effect on the people involved, even how it can reach beyond the immediate family. There are many other complex issues discussed, and all of it is through the lens of Muslim culture, which I found fascinating. Thematically, the central issue is about making tough decisions in the context of a culture where religion and government are so intertwined. As far as acting is concerned, it was some of the best I've ever seen. Every performer gave their all, and it felt like I was watching a documentary with real people. This tone was also reinforced by the handheld camerawork and (until the closing credits) a lack of music. Overall, this is not just one of the best foreign films I've ever seen, but one of the best period. The only minor issue I take is the rather ambiguous ending, but after watching the problems that the characters go through for two hours, it's probably just my personal desire for a more clear-cut resolution. Overall, if you love foreign films or complex, realistic dramas then give this a try.

THE DISC: The audiovisual quality of the movie on Blu-ray is immaculate, and the color palette, though limited, is reproduced wonderfully. There is also a small, but significant, amount of special features. The most valuable is a full-length audio commentary by writer/director Asghar Farhadi. There was also a 30-minute discussion panel with him in which he discusses his inspirations for making the film, its themes, and thoughts on his career. What is refreshing is his refusal to pinpoint a specific meaning of the film, leaving it up to the viewer to decide for themselves. There is also a short featurette on Asghar Farhadi's career with some clips from his previous films.

OVERALL: This is a morally complex, gripping drama that demands multiple viewings. It is also a great window into an oft misunderstood culture that is under-represented in film overall. The extra material also offers additional valuable perspective. Ultimately, this film would be an excellent addition to anyone's collection.",1411257600,,2428,5.007425742574258

Well thats not going to win any Oscars, lets release it after the big show. This Means War, no thanks.
Journey 2, couldn't pay me to see the first one. Ghost Rider 2? Really? There was enough support to
green light a Ghost Rider 1? Pass. Yes, I took a little hiatus from the big screen that ended with A
Separation, an Iranian film that took this years Oscar for Best Foreign Film. The film is playing in
Northfield, but might not be in theaters for long.

A Separation tells the story of a man named Nader who struggles with an ailing father, pre-adolescent
daughter, and absentee wife. Trouble comes when he needs to hire a caretaker for the father while he is
at work. From the beginning the woman who takes the job would rather not have it (but needs the
money). Her apprehension becomes evident as she leaves the father alone, tied loosely to the bed, as
she leaves the house. Nader comes home early to find his father lying on the floor near death, and he
becomes enraged with the neglect. When the caretaker comes home to explain, Nader pushes her out
of the house. Then major trouble begins!

This film gives a very candid and in-depth look at modern day Iran. Beyond what little we see on
television or in newspaper articles, this movie is steeped in the culture with its laws and lifestyles,
struggles and humanity. Still, the films themes are universal--caring for elderly parents, conflicts in
marriage, and anxieties facing a child caught in the middle. So although this story is best told in a setting
like Iran--with its chaos and fair share of machismo (which Im certain is not what its called in Iran)--it
could also have been told in any country.

Clearly the Oscar here was well deserved, as the acting was superb (especially by the children) and the
story well told. Forget that the courtroom drama for a murder trial is played out in an office
resembling that of an assistant principals office; you will appreciate the texture of this film. The
emotions are as genuine as the settings, the drama as palatable as the characters. This film gets high
marks for gutsy and genuine storytellingand for, well lets says it, not sucking when most of the other
films out right now do exactly that. Cant wait for next weeks releases!",1408406400,2,2347,4.583333333333333

4598401,4,B0058GVP5U,"I was about halfway into ""A Separation"" when I noticed that the fim was unrelentingly claustrophobic. Many scenes took place in hallways, or were shot through doorways, and there was almost always a wall or some other barrier present, even if it was just the back of someone's head. The outdoor scenes offered little relief, with the same walls or other enclosures, and any vista of sky reduced to a mere patch. If the point was to emphasize how the characters' lives were circumscribed by the limitations imposed by the old man's condition, the culture, the religion, and the legal system, then the filmmakers succeeded, albeit in a heavy-handed and obvious way. I'm not sure it would have been possible to have directed the film in this manner without the motif being so apparent.

Another interesting choice was to not show the divorce court judge at the beginning and end of the film - the camera is from his POV, but we never see him the way we see the criminal court judge. This communicates the idea that this particular aspect of the Iranian legal system is impersonal, all-seeing, almost godlike, while the criminal courts are just another bureaucracy.

Other reviewers are praising the ending for being ""un-Hollywood"" in that it is unresolved; I would say that the ending is a cop-out. The girl repeats several times that she has made her decision, but we never learn what it is - like Schrodinger's cat, the situation is ambiguous as long as it remains unknown to us. There's no deep philosophical message here - it's just a refusal or inability to end the film, and ultimately unsatisfying, as if the filmmakers couldn't decide themselves what they wanted. A tidy ""resolution"" isn't necessary. Ending it with the girl saying that she had decided to stay with both parents, forcing them to work out the details without specifying exactly how this would be accomplished, would have finished the film with sufficient ""un-Hollywood ambiguity.""

Overall, well done in that for a dialogue-driven film, the characters' interactions were believable, and a good exposition of the effect that caring for a sick, elderly parent can have on a family.",1403308800,,2150,4.917355371900826

4598405,4,B0058GVP5U,"This Oscar-winning (Best Foreign Film) drama from Iran is every bit as good as one of you JayFlix.net folks insisted it was! Persistence pays (AND backing a highly acclaimed film). Thanks for all those reminders. Part of what makes this so convincing is the unfamiliarity of the faces, but the rest is excellent direction, wonderful acting and an unpredictable story.

An elderly man is slowly sinking into the oblivion of Alzheimer's while his over-wrought son tries to provide care for him, hold a job, be an involved parent for his only child and, in his spare time, save his marriage. His wife has worked diligently to get visas so she, her husband and their daughter can leave Iran. The husband is adamantly opposed; he can't leave while his father (who no longer recognizes him) needs his help. The central issue is his father's disease and its disastrous effects on his family. It doesn't matter if we are in Tehran or Toledo, the ripple effects of Alzheimer's are the same.

Here are the players:
  * Peyman Moadi (""About Elly"") Nader is dynamic, impatient, arbi- trary and loving. He cannot yield one iota, for fear he will lose everything. He feels his pride, his honor and his duty are in jeopardy, so nothing must interfere: not a wife, not a caretaker, not a daughter.
  * Leila Hatami (""The Deserted Station"") Simin is smart, deter- mined and organized; she is the wife who wants a better life else- where. Even though she can't say so out loud, she is stifled by her world and doesn't want her daughter to grow up in it.
  * Sareh Bayat (""Devil's Take"") Razieh is devout, obedient and desperate. She has been hired secretly (she is a woman) to care for the Alzheimer's patient. When he soils himself she has to call a Muslim help line to see if it is a sin for her to clean him up with no male in attendance.
  * Shahab Hosseini (""Final Whistle"") Hodjat is the furious husband of the caretaker; she failed to get his permission before going to work. His rage fuels the last half of this film.
  * Sarina Farhadi in her screen debut, is Termeh, the teenage daughter who is caught in the tug-of-war between her parents.

I found the legal battles to be extremely interesting. All the parties convene in an office with what appears to be a magistrate. Each person presents his or her side of the story, amid interruptions and distractions from others, and the official tries to ascertain the truth. The part I really liked: NO LAWYERS! What an interesting concept.

It is the caretaker's deeply held religious conviction that provides the turning point on which all the other issues hinge. The DVD is available from Amazon in Blu-Ray and standard DVD.",1398470400,,2663,4.662393162393163

Life goes as well as it can for a typical Iranian family until the wife decides to get a separation .
The movie begins with both of them stating their reasons to the judge :
We don't see the judge, they are speaking to us the viewers , this technique used most effectively on Rashomon , 1950  celebrated Akira
KUROSAWA film , is brilliant and from there on the linear but fast cinematic approach takes over like a hurricane and never stops. There aren't enough words to describe the human emotions so well depicted by all the characters, my favorable is the daughter ( which happens to be the directors own ) she is quietly suffering and trying to get her parents together as they all go thru this traumatic experience , the story told as I mentioned before is so dramatic the screenplay so elegant that at the end which contains the most harrowing personal cruel moment for the daughter as the judge asks to decide whose parents she wants to stay with and she keeps saying yes yes yes as the judge keeps asking?????

Arabic movie, takes place in muslim culture and its about a couple who is separated and their difficulties.

Razieh is hired to take care of the father but when she leaves in the middle of the day and leaves the father alone, Nader gets upset and pushes her. Later in the day she has a miscarriage which unfolds the second part of the story dealing with Razieh and her husband who wants blood money for the death of their child. Seimin is adamant he didn't hurt her and Raziehs husband is unemployed and needs money to pay his debts. The story is complex and deals with the role religion, class differences, and family plays. At the end no one is happy with the result, Razieh isn't certain if Seimin caused the miscarriage; Raziehs faith makes her torn about this doubt but her husband wants the money; Nader is upset that he cares more about being right than to end the case and protect their daughter; The dad debilitates even worse and stops talking; the couple divorce and their child is left to decide who she wants to stay with.

A Separation is a heartbreaking drama of a crumbling relationship between a man and his family and his community as he tries to take care of his father who suffers from Alzheimer's Disease.

This intense drama really captured my interest from the outset. It is acted in Persian language with English subtitles, so you have to pay close attention since the dialogue moves so fast. The most compelling part of the film was the realization that regardless of where we live and the language we speak, we are all facing the same family pressures. This upper middle class family in Tehran faces marital troubles and struggles with the care of an elder parent stricken with Alzheimer's, while trying to raise their 11-year old daughter and maintain their careers. The plot is quite simple, but the dynamics of the relationships between the family members and the woman they hired to care for the elderly parent creates a lot of tension and drama.

Simin wants to go abroad, but Nader feels himself unable to follow as he has to look after his father (Ali-Asghar Shahbazi), who has Alzheimer's.  Daughter Termeh (Sarina Farhadi) stays with Nader, but still wants her parents to be together.  Nader hires Razieh to come and look after his house while he (Nader) is out at work, but things do not go according to plan.  Razieh loses her unborn child, and her husband Hojjat (Shahab Hosseini) accuses Nader of contributing to the tragedy.  The conflicts between the two families - those of Nader and Hojjat - end up in the courts, involving issues not just of justice but religious and social traditions as well. Asghar Farhadi's film is shot in documentary-style, with no musical accompaniment.  Its structure can be described as elliptical; the end mirrors the beginning, depicting the difficulties of family life in a society where women have to act according to certain prescribed social and moral guidelines, while their male partners often allow belief in tradition to influence their judgment.  Such attitudes are not peculiar to Farhadi's context; they prevail in other territories as well.  A SEPARATION is a study in non-communication: both families are articulate, and can express their feelings through well-crafted dialog, but they do not listen to one another.  The action unfolds with passionate intensity, sustaining the viewer's attention throughout.",1390348800,,1501,5.2468619246861925

As the story unfolds, it picks up complexity.......each character sympathetic at some point, less sympathetic in others, and as such, true to life.  Where justice demands villains, there are none to be had.

(Once again it is difficult to imagine how the Academy Awards and Golden Globe can justify separating ""foreign films"" from American-made, unless American films would be so outclassed as to be disqualified.  Could anyone honestly say Leonardo diCaprio is a better actor than Peyman Moaadi?  The nuanced acting, directing and script of this film so far and away out-ranks any home-grown films I can think of, I can't even see a comparison.)

4598429,5,B0058GVP5U,"the legal system in this film left me aghast. i have never seen anything like it.  we open in one legal proceeding where the wife is trying to obtain a divorce.  then about a half hour later the film is engrossed in yet another legal system, this time ""murder"" of a 4.5 month old fetus via the mother's miscarriage.  that proceeding segues into a charge of mistreating the elderly and then we discover one guy has been sitting in debtor's prison the whole time. during all of these ""proceedings"" both plaintiff and defendant talk all at once and at the same time to the judge.  the judge just basically finds them guilty of more and more crimes as they do so.  no rules of evidence are followed.  no attorneys are used. there is no order in the court.  and their mounting ""crimes"" are not going to help matters. yet the social ills are so manifest yet no one is interested in those: an incompetent senior with alzheimer's; a pregnant woman who already has one child who is pregnant again while her husband remains in debtor's prison; a couple who have separated because the wife wants to leave all the ills of this land and move elsewhere where there might be a future for her daughter.  there is lots else going on in this film but primarily this gave me a look at the retrogressive laws and untended social ills of the middleast and it was an eye opener, unlike anything else i've read or seen.  the legal system in the usa was not this retrograde two hundred years ago.  an astonishing film!  i was THERE!

update: i just saw this director's PAST which is up for the Oscar in the March 2014 ceremony. this film also involves use of the legal system and courts for a married couple.  in SEPARATION we see the Iranian legal system which is extremely chaotic and unlike any courts i've ever seen.  in PAST we have the french legal system which is not all that different from the orderly process one experiences in the USA or UK courts. i had a law professor decades ago who said, ""show me a country's legal system and case law and i'll show you the country and the people.""  seeing couples getting divorces in Iran vs France was a MAJOR eye opener for me as to the validity of this maxim.

Note: this film was made in 2011 yet everywhere they went in the film i didn't see any technology.  in most movies, even those set in other countries, you see most people carrying around laptops, ipads, tablets, cellphones.  if you go into any place of business or any institution, the technology is everywhere, such as schools, courts, hospitals, the family's homework spot and so on.  I saw NONE of that in this film.  maybe i missed one somewhere but it was isolated if i did. as to the dress, although we typically notice all the women are veiled, this time i noticed that virtually everyone was wearing blue jeans and shirts, both men and women.  the women put veils on top of that.  there does not seem to be much in the way of wearing business clothes by anyone. even the judge was dressed like this. the halls in the court were jam packed with people dressed like this, waiting, and it didn't look like much was being accomplished, if one had cut the movie to America while watching, it would seem like the film was also cutting to a different time period. this film looks like it is set in the 1970s by the time you visit all of these places in the city.  UPDATE: in the most recent film PAST, i saw only one computer in use. one of the children was using a laptop to while away the time while he was left on his own in a corner of his father's dry cleaning store. i did see cell phones in use but these characters used them as phones. there is also the mention that email was used to harass a character's wife but that is mentioned not seen. as to clothes, the woman who was French was dressed simply but beautifully whereas the other characters were in the usual blue jeans and shirts.

The Artist was fun, beautifully acted and clever in it's demands, but has none of the power of A Separation. Hugo, likewise, was amazing to watch and heartfelt. But the energy and tension, the feeling of loss and ill communication here is substantial. I loved Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy for it's tension and vision of Europe in the mire of the menacing, brain crushing anvil of the Cold War. With the same authenticity, A Separation brought me in to Iran, into a family and a society even more so than Tinker, Tailor expressed Europe in the 70's. I will probably never get to Iran, to see it's streets or it's architecture or it's judicial system. Some of these things may best be steered clear of. Easy for me to say, American as I am, though any justice system is going to have it's labyrinthine dark corridors. The same goes for a country and a people; though Iran today represents a grave threat not only to it's neighbors, but the West as well, it is the priceless role of Art that reminds me, thousands of miles away from Iran, that the world is full of people, individuals and families and small moments, lifetimes of angst and dreaming, mistakes and violences. This was a striking vision of the possibility of anyone's life being thrown upside down when social compacts between men and women, small communication breakdowns building on one another, the problems of individual lives intersecting; accidental interactions, faith, pride, family.
A beautiful vision of the difficulty of getting along. A Separation is the kind of film, a modern masterpiece that succeeds as a neo-realistic courtroom family socio-political thriller. Students can watch this; There is no gun play, no blood, no graphic violence and no explosions. There is a world of education and art here.",1370563200,2,1857,4.824451410658307

Even watching ""free"" DVR recorded movies, our response is almost always either to bail out within the first half hour, or share an ""eh"" response when do we watch one all the way through.

""A Separation"" gives hope to those who appreciate real adult situations depicted in movies.  And it has to come from an alien, often demonized culture.  What it does is to immediately yank you in to a situation where everyone's trying to make the best decisions they can, but because they're imperfect human beings, every decision winds up causing great harm in one way or another and dragging everybody further in to the maelstrom--with even the innocent eleven year old daughter who is constantly demanding truth not spared from being human.

4598452,5,B0058GVP5U,"WOW!!! This film was DYNAMITE! A combination of original cinematography and a gripping storyline that leaves the audience guessing and then blows them away. I LOVED this film!!! It is a family drama that develops into a legal thriller all of which offers a glimpse into the intersection of class, gender, age, power in the Islamic Republic. I highly highly recommend this to anyone who wants to get closer to understanding Iranians as more than boogeymen and appreciating the diversity within their society. The message I come away with from the film is that their system is as bad as the US. The filmmaker does a great job creating a expansive cast of very different characters who are intriguing and making each character amaze the audience in his/her own way. Each actor is fantastic in driving home the drama and tension and the filmmakers open a door for us into a society we don't experience but is so maligned. Kudos to the entire cast and crew of the film! After I watched the film I was certain they deserved the Oscar without a doubt!

4598453,5,B0058GVP5U,"There are two good reasons to see this film:

First, it's wonderfully well made and fully deserving of its 2011 Oscar as the ""Best Foreign language"" film. {Foreign Language? Sooo condescending!} The actors have an edge in plausibility by NOT being familiar to English-language audiences from other roles, but even so their dramatic control of face/body/voice could hardly be improved. Editing and camerawork are outstanding, and the script is deep, both emotionally and thematically. A powerful film, in short, and several orders of magnitude more intelligent than any ""American Language"" film I saw in 2011.

Second, it seems to be profoundly revealing of Life in contemporary Iran. I write ""seems"" because I have not visited Iran and have no first-person experience of Life there with which to compare what the film portrays. That portrayal is clearly NOT a whitewash of social problems in Iran; in fact it has the grit of honest realism. The depiction of the Iranian justice system in action could not have pleased Iranian authorities, but there it is on screen! The gender relations are not as simplistic and uniform as many Americans shallowly assume. The two principal women characters could scarcely be more different, one of them impoverished, uneducated and burqa-clad, the other an ambitious ""modern"" woman from a well-off family who dyes her hair and wears the least ""devout"" scarf possible. Attitudes toward Islam are likewise not uniform or simple; the lives of both couples in the film are permeated by religion but the four characters plainly hold their ""faith"" in different compartments of their minds. The mere fact that such a film could be made in Iran and shown to the World makes me think that Iran is not as rigidly supervised by Ayatollahs as the western press portrays it. Few American dramatizations of contemporary society are as honest and insightful as ""A Separation.""",1358121600,4,1896,5.112903225806452

4598460,5,B0058GVP5U,"Iran has come to be seen in the West as a perpetual rogue state and political pariah because of its commitment to promoting hard-line Islamic fundamentalism and creating a nuclear weapons program. The makers of this film want to offer their audience another more disturbing view of Iran that goes inside the country and looks at how the institution of the family fares when it is under attack. The picture it presents is one of very divided society along the lines of conflicting religious and social values that cross generations and speak to a country that may not be united behind its political leaders and their rigid ideology. The main characters in this film are Nader and Simin, typical modern Iranian parents who unfortunately have fallen out over how to raise their daughter, Termeh. While the father wants to keep her in Iran so she can be educated according to the Quran, the mother favours taking her abroad for a western education. These two irreconcilable views invariably lead to the break-up of their marriage and a chain of nasty events that even the mighty autocratic regime of Iran, with the help of the Quran, is unable to resolve. While the family institution represents some of the strongest links in any society, when they begin to break apart, like in this story, its individuals become very vulnerable to outside attacks. Children suffer from the lack of parental nurturing; elderly parents don't get the help they need; outsiders step in and exploit people's emotions; and individuals ultimately turn inward and become self-centered. While Islamic law attempts to resolve these troubling situations by imposing rules, it cannot overcome the fact that Iran is a society made up of individuals who have not yet learned to put the interests of others before their own. Come to think of it, this is a human failing that dogs most of the human family with one exception: the Iranian regime papers over it with a facade of morality that is supposed to hold the family together even if it is clearly dysfunctional. People just don't understand each other in this film, right down to the very children who are the real losers.",1354752000,,2144,4.876712328767123

4598462,4,B0058GVP5U,"Earlier this year,  the 2011 film ""A Separation"" (Jodaeiye Nader az Simin), written, directed and produced by Asghar Farhadi (""About Elly"", ""Fireworks Wednesday"", ""Beautiful City"") became the first Iranian film to win an Academy Award for ""Best Foreign Language Film"".

The film has achieved success in other countries, winning the ""Golden Bear"" for Best Film, Best Actress and Best Actor awards at the 61st Berlin International Film Festival, winning a Golden Globe for ""Best Foreign Language Film"" and other awards around the world.

Also receiving a nearly unanimous favorable rating from film critics internationally, including voted #1 by Roger Ebert for ""Best Film of 2011 and placing #2 in the annual ""Best Film of 2011 by Sight & Sound's critic poll.

VIDEO:

""A Separation"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1 aspect ratio).  Despite being a low-budget film, the clarity and detail of the film is very good.  The film is colorful, warm and for the most part, considering the majority of the shots are indoors, picture quality is very good.  I didn't notice any artifacts, banding or any problems while watching this film.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""A Separation"" is presented in Persian/Farsi, French LCR DTS-HD MA (Discrete Surround). Because the film is a lossless stereo track, while the film is primarily dialogue driven, the dialogue is crystal clear along with the music by Sattar Oraki which sounds wonderful.  While it would have been nice to have a 5.1 lossless track for ambiance and better dynamic range especially in scenes featuring crowds or traffic noise, but because the film is primarily within close quarters, dynamic range is limited, but yet dialogue and music are clear.

Subtitles are in English and French.

SPECIAL FEATURES

""A Separation"" comes with the following special features:

  Commentary with Writer/Director Asghar Farhadi - Featuring a detailed audio commentary by filmmaker Asghar Farhadi (note: commentary is presented with English subtitles).
  An Evening With Asghar Farhadi - (30:42) A post screening Q&A with director Asghar Farhadi.
  Birth of a Director - (7:52) An interview with director Asghar Farhadi discussing his films.
  Theatrical Trailer - (2:03) The theatrical trailer for ""A Separation"".

JUDGMENT CALL:

Asghar Farhadi's ""A Separation"" is an amazing and cleverly written film.  A film that captivates an audience and you become emotionally invested in it because not only is it a family drama, it's also an emotional drama in which you sympathize with all characters, who each have their own personal motivation.

Is it philosophical?  There are tangents within each human connection that there is no way anyone can pick one side.

Simin is a mother who puts her daughter's future ahead of her own marriage.  She is not being selfish, knowing how life is in Iran, all she wants is the best for her daughter and knowing that moving to a better area can lead to a better life for her family.  In her mind, her father-in-law is alive, but he rarely speaks and is just a person with no future as he had lived his life and now, no longer has any recollection of it.  He doesn't even know his own son, that is how bad Alzheimer's disease has consumed him.  So, can you blame Simin for now wanting to make a move on life?  It doesn't mean she doesn't love her husband or her father-in-law but for most parents, to invest in your children's future and making sure they have a  better life than their parents is important.

For Nader, he is the evocative character.  A loving son, a caring father, but his wife is forcing him make a choice...father or family?  This is a difficult choice because perhaps for Nader, his father is what made him to become a man.  It appears that his father was a big part of his life and it shows as Nader gives all he can to take care of his father within reasonable means.  And there is no way his wife is going to destroy that important father and son relationship.  His father may not be the same man as he once was, but he feels that he owes it to him, to care for him while he is alive.  And the fact that his wife leaves him, his feelings towards her is no longer the same.  And there is no doubt that his argument with Razieh, the woman hired to care for his father was fueled by anger.  By tying his father up and his father close to dying, it's hard to be angry with Razie and why he reacts the way he does towards her.  Pushing her is wrong, but did he know she was pregnant or not?

For the 11-year-old daughter Termeh, she represents the blood connection to Nader and Simin.  The only connection to keeping the family together.  She knows she can go with her mother and leave, but she would never do such a thing because she loves her father as well.  And as long as she stays with her father, she knows that her mother will never leave far away from her.  But as Termeh is a smart girl, the court case revolving around her father begins to take its toll, as she starts to learn how different they towards each other.  But all she wants is for her parents to be married...but will she have any power to keep them together or will they remain separated.

And as you have the family drama persisting throughout the film, you now deal with the supporting characters.

Razieh, the very religious woman with a daughter, pregnant but must deal with her husband's financial problems and temper.  She takes on a job, far from her home in order to make money to help the family.  But having been shamed by Nader and accused for stealing money, which she argues that she didn't, to make things worse, she loses her baby because of Nader.

And now this becomes the focus of the story as she wants Nader punished for the loss of her child.  Her husband Hodjat has a hot-temper but he also would rather see Nader punished for the loss of his baby than take any financial payment.  But because of his temper and troubles, when it is used against him, he feels that its unfair to him and his wife.  For Razieh, because they are poor, because their is no official papers to show employment, because her husband's hot temper is becoming a hindrance, the audience begins to question.  Is Nader responsible for her miscarriage?

There are many situations which we may feel are implausible and ineffable, but once you start to feel yourself straying to one side and supporting a character, situations start to make you reverse and question that decision.  Is Nader genuine?  Is he telling the truth or is he lying?  Is the religious Razieh lying?  Will Termeh be dragged into this as well?  It's all part of the wonderful pacing and buildup of the film, which I found captivating!

""A Separation"" is a Blu-ray release that looks great via HD.  While the lossless audio is primarily dialogue and is front channel driven, there are careful shots that are employed in the film.  Facial reactions, well-planned editing that compliments the film's pacing.  And there is also a few special features included as well, that introduces us to the work of filmmaker Asghar Farhadi.

What I enjoyed about Asghar Farhadi's film is that it's not polemic, it's not forcing religion or any belief.  It's a film that makes us sympathize with every character, as they all believe what they are doing is right.  The film is character-driven and what Farhadi was able to create are moments that make us feel we know the facts, when we really don't. Each person has their own personal motive.

But it's their genuine actions, their own personal convictions that keep them separated.  Its strong storytelling and character development is what adds to the efficacy of Farhadi's masterpiece!

""A Separation"" is a film that is very deserving of all the awards it has won, it is deserving of its Academy Award for ""Best Foreign Language Film"" and its a rare film to see in today's world.  Yes, the film is made in Iran and gives us a perspective of how law is served, how religion is important to certain people of society but it's also a modern film that strays away from what people think about films being created in the Middle East.  Nader and Simin are among the upper middle class in Tehran, their daughter is educated and no matter how much media tends to portray Iranians, for those of us in the west, it's important to have films such as ""A Separation"" showing audience of a modern society but also their culture, laws and no matter where you are in this world, problems exist not only for the poor but even people with money.  Life's never perfect and for marriages, there are sacrifices that need to be made.  But how far will one go to make a sacrifice for their family?

Overall, Asghar Farhadi has written and directed a pure cinematic masterpiece. Captivating, compelling and wonderful! ""A Separation"" is highly recommended.",1354320000,3,8798,4.705497382198953

Also, after you watched it, you still have some days left to watched again before Amazon retired it from your queue . You can start watching it, stop it, then you can start to watch again at the same point where you were before.

4598468,5,B0058GVP5U,"When I read about an Iranian movie winning a Best Foreign Language Oscar, I figured that this was a gesture of world peace or something.  I had watched an earlier Iranian Oscar nominee that was pretty good but I was not really prepared to expect a sudden series of 5 star movies from Iran.  However, ""A Separation"" IS a five star movie.

From the beginning, the film seems to hold back enough details that we are never quite sure what is happening or about to happen.  There are scenes that seem to be brief and unimportant yet, later in the film, things seem to depend on those earlier scenes.  I was watching a rented movie and I could have rewound to double check certain scenes (and one in particular).  However, I realized that the film challeged me to make the same kind of on-the-spot decisions that we have to confront in real life and real time.  I still have only watched the one viewing start to finish and I am realizing that to see the film another time would probably both add and take away from its' impact.  The ending is wonderfully left open to interpretation.  In between the beginning and the end is a lot of very good acting that involves us as ourselves confronting real and important issues of relationships.  This is a film that will stay with you for quite a while.  I'm still not sure if I'll watch it again.",1353369600,5,1334,4.426229508196721

4598471,5,B0058GVP5U,"I love films like these... Many Americans will not watch 'a movie you have to read' as they usually put it, but I find that foreign flicks give the viewer more than what Hollywood pumps out.
'A Separation' was excellent. The storytelling was universal in a way that rarely comes along. The acting by the old man was phenomenal, tears welled up in my eyes while thinking of an aged old man, barely there anymore... the actor portrayed it perfectly. Also the father and daughter were terrific, along with the old man's aide, who really was the best of them all. When she was on the bus going to work after the old man was wondering outside the day before... the look on her face was downright heartbreaking... One big drawback, for me, was the mothers acting. She kept pulling a face like she was on the verge of smiling. Almost making herself look as attractive as possible because there was a camera in her face. I found it distracting and was glad she wasn't in the film that often... When she was supposed to look disappointed or frustrated, she didn't pull it off in the least. The other actors made up for her amateurish attempt to act.
The first half of the film was fast paced.. The second half was slower which made it drag on in a way I'm not used to. If a film 'drags on' its usually a negative thing, but I don't mean it in a negative way, I'm not sure really how to describe it. It set the pace sort of thing.
(no spoilers) The ending... I really liked it, but can see how people would be disappointed because the conclusion didn't really come. It wasn't like the movie just ended in the middle of a scene though. The viewer is supposed to use their brain to decide what happened. Much like one of my favorites '2001: A Space Odyssey' you are supposed to be thinking and not simply have everything in the movie explained.
Getting on to the blu ray. Sound was good, but it's a dialogue driven film (it was in 3.0 not 5.1 or 7.1) Picture was sometimes great, sometimes not. It looked a little fuzzy at times (I don't think it was the transfer, rather the look that was intended by the director..)

From what I say below some of you may judge me as a boorish person, and not someone who actually watches many international movies and enjoys catching the color of different geographic and social landscapes.  But I'm going to tell you what I really thought of this movie.

""A Separation"" annoyed the crap out of me.  People in Iran frequently do STUPID things, in my judgement.  Their behavior is quite COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE and to watch it in dramatic form can be a frustrating experience.  I have seen movies from Iran that I loved and liked, that brought home universal truths.  And I can certainly appreciate a film about people making bad life choices - ""Trees Lounge"" is a favorite, actually.  But to me this movie just didn't bring much of anything home, didn't get me to care about its characters, and didn't entertain or enlighten me in any way.",1349827200,3,937,4.77639751552795
4598476,5,B0058GVP5U,"""A Separation"" is a brilliant film out of Iran and given today's political climate I'm afraid I have to wonder when we'll see another fine Iranian film again. After reading the fine reviews posted here already, there is little new information I can give you about the general plot and the way the film portrays life. I will say, however, that I agree with the reviewers who write that this stunning film explores separations between parents, classes in Iranian society with all that that implies; the separation between the devout religious Iranians and other Iranians who live a more secular, modern day world life; the contrast between the past represented by Nader's elderly father and the future represented by Simin and Nader's young daughter--and more. Interestingly enough, despite all the dichotomies, the principle characters all come in shades of grey; there are no clear cut heroes or villains and that's quite something!

The plot moves along well and despite its two hour length things never progressed too slowly. Indeed, I was fascinated by the story as it unfolded. The acting is superlative; all of the actors, both experienced and not so experienced give nuanced, convincing and passionate performances that I won't forget anytime soon. The choreography and the cinematography reflect great forethought and the musical score enhances the film as well.

When the action starts we quickly meet Simin (Leila Hatami) and Nader (Peyman Moadi). While Simin wants to leave Iran with their daughter Termeh (Sarina Farhadi) for a better quality of life, Nader wants to stay in Iran and take care of his father who has Alzheimer's disease. Things are so bad between Simin and Nader that they go before a judge for a divorce but the judge will not grant them a divorce. Simin pretends to leave the country to manipulate Nader and Termeh but in reality Simin goes to stay with her mother. Termeh stays with Nader knowing that Simin would never leave the country without her--thus Termeh tries to keep her parents together.

Now that Simin is living elsewhere, Nader hires a highly religious woman Razieh (Sareh Bayat) to look after his father while he is working; but after Nader's father soils his pants Razieh feels she can no longer look after Nader's father because of her religious beliefs. While there's more to this that you'll discover when you watch this film, essentially Nader accuses Razieh of stealing money and tying his father down to the bed while she goes out on what was supposedly an errand; and he fires her. In the ensuing argument Nader literally throws Razieh out and things become very complicated and serious after that. Razieh and her infuriated husband Hojjat (Shahab Hosseini) file a criminal complaint against Nader for not paying Razieh and more; and Nader states before the same judge that Razieh stole money from him and almost killed his father by leaving him alone tied to the bed. The rest of the plot reveals how all this works out although there is a plot twist at the very end of the film that will leave you watching the ending credits with baited breath!

In addition, look for excellent performances by Ali-Asghar Shahbazi as Nader's father; Shirin Yazdanbakhsh as Simin's mother; Merila Zare'I as Miss Ghahraii; Kimia Hosseini as Somayeh and Babak Karimi as the interrogator/judge.

There is little this reviewer can add to the reviews already on this website without repeating what has been said. This work is an inspired masterpiece. It hosts a well-written and constructed script;  full dimensional characters which  are not cardboard caricatures given to us by Hollywood; real-life situations that are totally believable and to which anyone can identify; the acting is; perfectly executed and convincing acting; and strong direction.

 This is an amazing film by any standard. The fact that it was made at all is a miracle. The Iranian government initially would not allow the film to be made, for political reasons. Deft diplomacy by the director allowed the green light for this film to be made.

 On a deeper level this film underscores that differences in politics or government or society in the present age are largely irrelevant. This is a couple everyone can identify with; the situations faced by this family could have happened in Europe, North America, or the Far East. This film tends to contradict a saying attributed to Leo Tolstoy, That happy people are happy for the same reason, but unhappy people have their own individual reasons for that unhappiness. Here, the cause of the family tension in Simin and Nadar's marriage could have existed in California, yet the locale of the movie is in Teheran. The anguish experienced by their daughter Termeh could be shared with any adolescent. Simin's and Nadar's use of Termeh as a bargaining chip to leverage control in their divorce is sadly not uncommon in dissolution matters. Add to this mix issues of integrity, pride, personal responsibility and honesty, and the final result is a compelling family drama.

 This movie is not meant for casual viewing. While a fine film in its own right, Bergman's Scenes from a Marriage is far too cerebral and rarified, even though the subject matter is completely different. In that movie you can fall asleep listening to Liv Ullman and Erland Josephson talk. Here, the story of Nadar and Simin will grab you and pull you in. Scene after compelling scene will force you to pay attention and watch the drama playing out before your eyes. This movie won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film for 2011. It should have been nominated and won the Oscar for Best Picture.",1348531200,3,2426,4.943488943488943

Its insights into Sharia law, Iranian culture, forms of argumentation, family life, to name just a few, would be enough to justify watching this film over and over. But it is so much more: intelligent, if sparse, filmmaking, complicated, believable and engrossing story telling, flawless acting. Most of all, the film's story, its characters, and its themes all transcend the particular and give us a heart-breaking but oh-so-real window on life with all its joys and its difficulties.

4598484,4,B0058GVP5U,"Going strictly by its press releases, one might conclude that the Oscar-winning ""A Separation""  is mainly about the difficulties Iranian couples face in procuring a divorce. But that turns out to be a fairly small part of the movie, actually.  In fact, on a political level, the film is more of an indictment of a legal system wherein a person who inadvertently causes a woman to have a miscarriage can be charged with the murder of that child.

But politics and social reform take a back seat in the movie to its human drama, as writer/director Asghar Farhadi provides us with a naturalistic tale of ordinary, decent people trying - but often failing - to lead ordinary, decent lives in a world too often ruled by the cruel exigencies of random chance.

Simin (Leila Hatami) is seeking a divorce from her husband, Nader (Peyman Moaddi).  It's not that she really wants a divorce; it's that she wants the two of them to move out of the country with their 11-year-old daughter, Termeh (Sarina Fahadi), to seek a more promising future for themselves somewhere else, but Nader wants to stay in the country to take care of his father who is suffering from Alzheimer's.  However, the judge deems that there are not sufficient grounds in this case to grant a divorce.  When Simin moves back in with her parents, Nader is forced to hire a woman (Sareh Bayat) to take care of his father during the day while he's at work.  It is at that point that the real trouble begins.

I don't want to give much more of the plot away than that; suffice it to say, the movie is a realistic drama made up of characters who are neither heroes nor villains, sinners nor saints.  There's plenty of blame to go around for what happens in the story - and at times it feels a bit like an episode of Adults Behaving Badly - but Farhadi always make us aware of just how flawed but well-intentioned these wholly recognizable figures are.  Their customs and religious beliefs may seem a bit foreign to Western eyes, but the issues of marital discord, of caring for an elderly parent, of trying but often failing at being a role model for one's children, and of refusing to accept the consequences of one's actions are universal in their scope and nature.

There's a certain redundancy in the narrative and an occasional flatness in the storytelling, but excellent performances and a bravely inconclusive, lady-or-the-tiger fadeout hold us in the movie's thrall.",1348358400,,2429,4.676056338028169
4598485,5,B0058GVP5U,"Well acted and written script dealing with how devotion can lead to separation. What is surprising is the degree of freedom in legal and personal rights that women have in Iran from what is customarily found in most centralized Islamic nations. That is probably due to the historic value placed on education for both genders in that country. What is not surprising is that women must still kowtow; be servile and submissive to males because of an abusive and manipulative misinterpretation of the Quran. This is most visibly symbolized by their restrictive clothing while the man wears his freedom openly.

My extracted simplistic theme for this particular social setting is that devotion results in separation:
Son devoted to father. Wife to husband. Parents to their child. Child to parents. Muslims to the Quran (the separation is from others; from freedom; from naturalness of life). Do blind devotions contribute to, if not primarily cause, separation? Can we attribute a value-judgement to this process? Is the end result good, bad, both, neither?",1348272000,,1053,5.194117647058824

4598487,5,B0058GVP5U,"The story of Oscar-winning Iranian drama ""Separation"" (""Jodaeiye Nader az Simin"") starts out slowly, but be patient. Once it picks up speed, the film is a cinematic page-turner that does not let up until the end, like a first-rate courtroom thriller. The ""mystery"" to be solved here is the human heart, or the conflicting mind-sets of believable characters writer/director Asghar Farhadi has created.

""Separation"" starts with a married couple in divorce court. The woman Simin (Leila Hatami) wants to leave Tehran for their only daughter Termeh's education while the man Nader (Peyman Moaadi) wants to stay in the country with his father with Alzheimer's disease.

As the court rejects Simin's application, she moves out of her husband's room. Left alone, Nadar hires a housekeeper Razieh (Sareh Bayat), whose job includes take care of Nadar's father while he is working. One day a heated argument breaks out between them over the way Razieh treats Nadar's father and the money he thinks is missing. Then Razieh falls down the stairs of his apartment building - an incident that triggers a chain of events including murder charge.

""Separation"" is a tour de force of powerful storytelling. The intriguing drama is also about credible characters divided by class, Nader and Simin representing the city's middle class, and Razieh and her husband Hodjat (Shahab Hosseini) as working-class parents. Ultimately the film's English title is not just about divorce.

""Separation"" is a multi-layered domestic drama with a compelling portrait of families on the verge of breakdown. But the film's serious theme should not put you off, because ""Separation"" is really a fascinating drama with its skilled and confident storytelling and characters you care. You should not miss it.",1347494400,3,1769,5.26241134751773

Her husband, who she sees as honest and good wants to remain in Iran in order to take care of his father who has Alzheimer's disease.  During their initial separation, wife moves out to live with her family while her 11 year old daughter remains to live with the father in hope that her parents will reconcile and stay together.  In order to take care of the ill father while at work, husband hires a woman to be his caretaker.  Her devout religious convictions cause conflict in her on how to take care of him at times when the old man needs to have his clothes changed.  One day, tragic turn of events puts into motion series of events that lead to serious law suit that can lead to a long prison sentence or expensive settlement between various parties.

At times unnecessarily protracted, this film provides a look at society in Iran.  It shows class difference within society; complicated relationship between man and wife when their loyalties split between his desire to take care of his father and her desire to secure her daughter's future.  Both people have noble ideals for their family, but their loyalties to these two very different causes are irreconcilable considering the circumstances.  In the end, it is obvious that the two of them cannot stay together and that it will be their daughter, not them who will make a decision which parent she will remain with.",1346889600,5,1528,4.62962962962963

It is above all else a window into how little difference there is living a middle class life in Iran today vs. here.  I was constantly surprised at the creature comfort (mod cons) level of what I assumed are a typical Iranian family.  The problems of dealing with government justice and day to day moral issues in a Muslim society mirrored themes familiar to us here.

4598491,5,B0058GVP5U,"A SEPARATION is a profoundly moving film from Iran, written and directed by Asghar Farhadi, acted by a truly gifted cast of artists, and a film that dares to dig deeply into so many issues that are not only serving to enlighten the world about conditions in Iran, but also to make us each reevaluate our feelings about family, faith, love, responsibility, parenting, and surviving in a world that often seems incompatible with life as we once knew it. One of the reasons the film works so intensely well is the directors ignoring the outside influences of musical score and cinematic effects, instead relying on person to person communication in claustrophobic confines that drives the story in an almost breathless pace that heightens the drama.

Briefly, the story deals with husband and wife Nader (Peyman Moaadi) and Simin (Leila Hatami) who are arguing about living abroad. Simin prefers to live abroad to provide better opportunities for their only daughter, Termeh (Sarina Farhadi). However, Nader refuses to go because he thinks he must stay in Iran and takes care of his father (Ali-Asghar Shahbazi), who suffers from Alzheimers. So committed is Simin to make this escape from the confines and turmoil of Iran that she decides to get a divorce and leave the country with her daughter. Nadar must work at the bank to support his father and Termeh who has decided to stay home in Iran with her father, so he hires a caregiver Razieh (Sareh Bayat) who comes to work with her 6 year old daughter: Razieh is pregnant, her unemployed cobbler husband Hodjat (Shahab Hosseini) is in and out of debtors prison, and in general Hodjat and Razieh represent the agony of the struggling lower class. Razieh cannot cope with caring for the Alzheimer victim, stressors occur, Nader throws Razieh out of his house when he discovers his father's lack of care, and in the struggle Razieh has a miscarriage.  The remainder of the film is the struggle between the two couples - middle class Nader and Simin and poverty lower class Razieh and Hodjat.  The audience is placed in the `courtroom' (actually a simple confrontation with a judge) concerning divorce, the accident that turns a miscarriage into an accusation of murder, and the battle between the two couples, which is a battle between classes. Religious issues are raised: philosophical issues are in focus. From all of these incidents we learn more about the current standards of life in Iran than any book has shared.

It is rare when a film leaves the audience speechless.  This one does. In Farsi with English subtitles.  Grady Harp, August 12",1345593600,7,2594,4.89749430523918

As human beings, if we look deep enough into our own thoughts and motives, one can find them pretty easily as ignorance, anger, delusion, etc.... This movie portrays the way we treat each other extremely accurately in a way that we might actually be in the movie itself.  It's such charged intense controlled drama, that should be seen by couples with issues.  The story begins quite innocuously with ignorance, which is basically the inability of people to be moved or ""bothered"" with.  Ignorance is so easily undetected, but one has to remember, that the biggest trick the devil ever played, was to make it look like it didn't exist, but it does indeed, in people's hearts.  This innocuous ignorance is in fact the birthplace of the rest of the kleshas that so accurately portrayed in this show.  After the initial ""not caring,"" a whole slew of other things emerge, starting from anger, fear, etc.  The development of all these highly charged emotions and situations is impeccable and highly relevant to today's relationships.  Even the childlike wish that if the mother did not leave, things would have been perfect is ignorance.

The Iranian-made picture, which won the 2011 Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, was produced, written and directed by Asghar Farhadi.

Set in contemporary Iran, the film begins with the wife, Simin, wanting to leave the country with her daughter, Termeh, but meeting resistance from her husband, Nader, who refuses to leave his Alzheimer-suffering father.  The judge refuses the divorce, but Simin moves out of the house anyway.

With Simin gone, Nader hires a young married woman to stay with and care for his father while he is working.  However, after Nader comes home one day to find the caretaker gone; his father tied to his bed and unconscious, emotions and events escalate to the point where the lives of all parties are put into jeopardy and changed forever...not necessarily for the better.

A SEPARATION is an engrossing drama with some surprising story twists.  It is filled with exquisite performances from a remarkable Iranian cast.

The DVD from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment includes audio commentary by director Farhadi, plus two featurettes, ""An Evening with Asghar Farhadi"" and ""Birth of a Director"".

The Artist was fun, beautifully acted and clever in it's demands, but has none of the power of A Separation. Hugo, likewise, was amazing to watch and heartfelt. But the energy and tension, the feeling of loss and ill communication here is substantial. I loved Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy for it's tension and vision of Europe in the mire of the menacing, brain crushing anvil of the Cold War. With the same authenticity, A Separation brought me in to Iran, into a family and a society even more so than Tinker, Tailor expressed Europe in the 70's. I will probably never get to Iran, to see it's streets or it's architecture or it's judicial system. Some of these things may best be steered clear of. Easy for me to say, American as I am, though any justice system is going to have it's labyrinthine dark corridors. The same goes for a country and a people; though Iran today represents a grave threat not only to it's neighbors, but the West as well, it is the priceless role of Art that reminds me, thousands of miles away from Iran, that the world is full of people, individuals and families and small moments, lifetimes of angst and dreaming, mistakes and violences. This was a striking vision of the possibility of anyone's life being thrown upside down when social compacts between men and women, small communication breakdowns building on one another, the problems of individual lives intersecting; accidental interactions, faith, pride, family.
A beautiful vision of the difficulty of getting along. A Separation is the kind of film, a modern masterpiece that succeeds as a neo-realistic courtroom family socio-political thriller.

It's my favorite type of film.  It gives the viewer a deep slice of life of a country outsiders don't understand very well.  And, behind the curtain, we find its citizens living extraordinary lives in difficult circumstances.  We empathize with them and celebrate their humanity and dignity.  In that regard, let's put 'A Separation' into the league with two recent brilliant films of the same ilk:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/4-Months-3-Weeks-and-2-Days/dp/B00151QYE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lives-of-Others/dp/B000OVLBGC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lives of Others</a>&nbsp;- depressing tones, repressive or faltering governments, beleaguered citizens placed into extreme circumstances with the most difficult of choices.

4598500,5,B0058GVP5U,"As a rule, I make an effort to see those films that are awarded an Oscar of best foreign language film.  These are often films of the highest calibre although they are invariably deemed to be ""arthouse"" and fail to garner a wide audience.  This is certainly the case with ""A Separation"", an unlikely film from Iran.

""A Separation"" is a comparatively straight forward drama.  It involves a couple where the wife would like to emigrate but the husband will not do so as he has an invalid father for whom he must care.  In the process of providing this care, a woman is hired to manage the elderly man during the day when the husband is at work.  This creates certain frictions that quickly escalate into the possible application of a murder charge.  I shall say no more as I do not wish to spoil the film for subsequent viewers.  Nonetheless, the drama is quite intense and absolutely captivates the viewer.  The audience with which I saw the film was totally hushed.  At times one could side with one party, at later times with another.  In the middle is the couple's daughter, the innocent bystander.

None of the actors is known in the west.  However, they all play great roles.  As individual's they are thoroughly compelling characters.

""A Separation"" is a film that might present difficulties to Hollywood.  It is not a film of action but, rather, interpersonal relations often at their most raw levels.  Tension mounts without any resort to gimmicks.

I strongly commend this film.  Under no circumstances be put off by having to read sub-titles. As with all good foreign language films, these seem to almost disappear as one is drawn into the drama.",1332201600,2,1657,4.690972222222222
4598501,5,B0058GVP5U,"I think most people have experienced in life at least once the law of unintended consequences, where a number of moves, seemingly small and harmless in themselves, end up in an explosive and desperate situation when they add up. In this wonderful Iranian drama (I WILL DISCLOSE SOME SPOILERS), Nader and Simin, a middle class, westernized couple in Tehran, are divorcing. Nader, the wife, wants to leave Iran for abroad with their daughter; Simin (an extraordinary performance by Peyman Moaadi) wants to stay to take care of his Alzheimer disease ravaged father. Nader moves out of the house, and to take care of his father, Simin hires Razieh, a religious, working class woman, who is clearly out of her depth in having to take care of an incontinent, senile man. In her second day at work, she leaves for a moment the apartment, leaving the father tied at the bed. Simin soon arrives and finds his father has fallen from bed and is unconscious. Razieh returns, Simin angrily confronts her, he accuses her of negligence in caring for his father and (it turns out falsely) of stealing money, they start arguing and he ends up shoving her from the apartment. She falls and ends up losing her four months pregnancy. When her unemployed husband Hodjat learns of this, he pushes charges of murder toward Simin, and soon there is a huge legal confrontation between the couples. I will not reveal more, but we are less than half ways into the movie, and in the course of the trial, many things would turn out not to be what we supposed at first.

Director Ashgar Farhadi intelligently does not take sides, and refrains from portraying one couple as good and the other couple as bad. Nevertheless, I think Western audiences will tend to sympathize with Nader and Simin, whose lives they would find easier to identify with. And Hodjat is such a hothead that is hard to feel any sympathy for him. But almost every character in the movie acts in a very selfish way (starting with Nader, wishing to leave Iran and her family without establishing a good reason). And almost every character would eventually lie to the judge when it fits their need. And it is the working class couple who has suffered the most grievous loss (though whose responsibility this was is not clear until the very end), and it is Simin who is probably the most smug character in the movie, though the movie makes clear that no one meant bad to anyone, and that they ended up up here due to an extraordinarily improbable chain of events.",1331856000,3,2500,4.681818181818182
4598502,5,B0058GVP5U,"It's a strange feeling walking out of the theater after watching the movie.. it's almost like don't know what to say. Witnessing the breakdown of a family's dynamic and how people deal with situations that could change their lives is somewhat familiar but at the same time touched.

""A separation"" is an Iranian film depicting the divorce of two individuals who were married for over 10 years and had one daughter together. The film was tactfully presenting each individual's situation but not a solution. You kept on watching to see what really happened and tried to understand why they did. You started thinking about yourself and the situation that you have gone through and the decision that you have made.

Simin and her husband were fighting with each other because she wanted to leave for a foreign country in order to give their daughter a better future while Nadir did not share the same thought. He had a father who had Alzheimer and there was no one taking care of him in Iran. They could not live together. He told her to go if she wanted to but she could not take their daughter with her. It was the beginning of all the things that happened. Never once did he ask her to stay.

Nader hired a maid to take of his father now that Simin had left for her parents home. Razieh was a very religious woman and had found it difficult taking care of Simin's dad. She however had a husband who happened to owe others lots of money making it impossible for her not to work to take care of things. Despite the difficult work, she stuck through until one day, Nader went home and found his Dad tied to the bed and fell down to the floor.

From here..the wheel of consequences started to turn... from one misunderstanding leading to another misunderstanding... from one lie leading to another lie...and it spread like fire, from one person to another person. An innocent girl was put to lie against her will to protect something precious to her. An innocent girl was asked to witness the breakdown of her family and couldn't do anything to protect it. An innocent girl looked up only to see that hope was no where to be seen. The final stare at the adults in the big room was powerful and almost scary.

Some said the movie was about class separation and how they conducted their life. Some said the movie was about the morale of people living in the situation that they were in. It's obvious that the movie embedded with meanings that each individual finds and figures out. As to what is the most important, it's up to the viewer because each of us values different things and for us, those are more important than others.

Despite setting in Iran, I can find myself sitting in and witnessing similar situations. Despite our different decision, it's hard to judge why he/she did what he/she did. The flaw of human nature is that we know our flaw but sometimes we couldn't do anything about. We do certain things for certain reasons and to us those reasons are dear and more important than others. One can't compare whose children are more important. One can't compare whose life is more important. In the end, we often decide what's best for us whether one has to lie to get what one wants. It is after all human nature.

""A separation"" is a wonderful movie but it is not without flaw. I would suggest you forgive the flaw while watching it. Then you would be able to enjoy it a lot more.

In the end, you might have to make some decision ;-)",1331424000,,3443,4.4976
4598503,5,B0058GVP5U,"""A Separation"" (2011 release from Iran; 123 min.) brings a complex family and morality drama, set in Tehran, of all places. The movie starts off with the 2 main characters, Nader and Simin, in front of a family judge to hear Simin's request for a divorce if her hysband doesn't want to move abroad along with their 11 yr. old daughter. Nader refuses, and knowing full well that Simin will not leave the country without her daughter, Simin moves out and back in with her parents (hence, the ""separation""). This necessitates Nader to hire someone to take care of his ailing father who suffers from Alzheimer's, while Nader is at work during the day. The woman he hires to help is pregnant and for reasons too long to explain here, at some point he and the woman get into a heated argument, he shoves her out the door of the apartment, she falls and she miscarries (another ""separation""). The woman's husband files a complaint and a court must determine who is at fault, who knew what when, and what the penalty should be.

It takes the movie about 25-30 min. to set the table for the unfolding drama, and while I was a bit unsure in that first half hour what direction the movie would take, once it all started clicking I have to say I was blown away at all levels.  Let's start with writer-director Asghar Farhadi, who has a clear vision for the film, and maps it all out. But wait, there is much more. The acting is simply superb, starting with the wife who leaves, played by Leila Hatami (I don't think I've ever seen a redhaired Iranian woman before), her husband (played by Peyman Moaadi), all the way to their 11 yr. old daughter, played by Sarina Farhadi, who is an acting revelation (just wait until you see the very last scene of the movie, it will amaze you).

""A Seapartion"" won this year's Oscar fro Best Foreign Movie, and deservedly so (even though there were other strong contenders, check out also Belgium's ""Bullhead""). I read somewhere that the production budget for ""A Separation"" was a mere $500,000, proving once again that it doesn't take mega-millions to make an engaging and terrific film (by contrast, Disney's new movie ""John Carter"" has a rumored production budget of $250 million). Most interestingly, while the Iranian government did not provide any financial assistance to ""A Separation"", it did not ban the movie from being made or from being shown in local theaters. Last but not least, one of the pleasures watching this movie are the glimpses one can detect of the ""ordinary"" life in Teheran. In all, ""A Seperation"" is a must-see for any foreign movie buff, or for anyone interested in an intellectually challenging movie. Highly recommended!",1331337600,,2674,4.697228144989339
4598504,4,B0058GVP5U,"I watched both Separation and Fireworks Wednesday by Asghar Farhadi. Both movies are very good. They are very much alike too. In part it's because of Farhadi's recognizable style, but to an extent the characters in the movies are very similar, young working couples, city dwellers, pretty much like Manhattenites in Woody Allen movies, probably more so.

Even though there's no adultery and jealousy  in Separation (which are prominently present  in Fireworks Wednesday), still one cannot but see these movies as parts of one single story of life in an Iranian city. Married couples, small kids getting involved in their parent's complex relationships, in-laws and neighbors - these people are present in both films.

Yes, the story in Separation is more tragic and even has some detective/whodunit line, definitely more convoluted and has some more or less unexpected turns, maybe it even has certain philosophical dimension, but... to my taste, Fireworks Wednesday is more subtle and poignant.

I won't say either film is so much better than the other, they're both good, but I don't think either of them deserves this much of acclaim the're getting. One only needs to compare them with Distant by Nuri Bilge Ceylan to see that we probably can expect a bit more subtlety from modern cinema than is present in Asghar Farhadi's films.",1330992000,3,1334,5.073059360730594
4598505,4,B0058GVP5U,"(WARNING: SPOILERS)

The title of the movie itself, ""A Separation"", is akin to a curve ball: While apparently about a divorce (i.e. a separation of a husband and wife from each other), Asghar Farhadi's film is easily about many other kinds of separation.

First, there's the separation of truth from what people believe to be true, the degree to which truth 'attaches' itself to what individuals think or feel (i.e. is truth independent of us?). There are many points in the movie in which a tense oscillation occurs not only among the characters but also on the viewer. Inevitably, I found myself wanting to 'shout' at the screen to 'explain' the 'true' meaning of what someone was trying to say, what 'actually' happened (and were you counting the number of commas'?). Of course the genius of Farhadi is that real soon I found myself thinking oh crap maybe I'm NOT sure what that person means anymore...and that maybe another voice has to be brought in...and can I say for sure I wouldn't do it?...etc, etc.

Not only is this movie - like many great movies - 120% unpredictable, it also - like some super movies - holds a mirror to us in a way that makes less eager to point a finger at other folks (or, failing that, to point it less confidently).

Which brings us to the separation of principle from reality. Virtually every character in the movie, at some point, has to put up a defense of his/her actions or words. Such a defense naturally includes the specific circumstances of the given problematic scenario, the persons' 'stress-level' at a certain time, what the person knew or didn't (and, most importantly, what he/she chooses not to know), the ethical obligations operative, how others reacted ad infinitum.

The movie could be described as a ""tragedy of errors"" in which people suffering their unique forms of pain have to deal the whirlwinds that arise from even the smallest step in a questionable direction. To me, this helps explode a fundamentalist view of 'absolute principle' and reinserts the messiness of reality as a struggle to remain continually - albeit very vulnerably - TRUE to principle.

The paradox here is that every character in the movie is trying to abide by strong (and noble) principles (e.g, commitment to family, honest work, religious devotion, truth-telling, reconciliation, even 'sticking to principle' as a principle!), yet what does reality do? It smashes it all away. The saddest thing, though, is that our frail human hearts can't help but play a part in the destruction of our best efforts to avert disaster.

A final separation to think about would be that of splitting the questions themselves from the logical requirement of an answer. Farhadi (or the film) seems to be implying that maybe the world has too many answers - that answers contribute to the problem! - and how there is value in pondering longer. Below are a few questions which may (or may not) be worth thinking about, some of which are already posed in the movie, but not all:

a) Was there another reason why Simin wants to leave Nader? Doesn't Nader's refusal to leave the country (because he wanted to take care of his father) strike one as a somewhat odd reason to end a 14-year marriage? And was taking care of his dad Nader's true reason not to leave? Really, did Simin truly want to leave Nader at all?

b) What does or doesn't Nader's father know about the 'truth' of the situation?

c) Why didn't Simin tell Nader that she was in the one who took the cash, and not Razieh? Given her generosity in helping to pay off Hodjat, why couldn't she own up that she was the one who stole from Nader in the first place?

d) Did Razieh fall down the stairs as she claimed? How did Razieh lose her baby? Why did Razieh and Hobjat even want another baby given the latter's huge debt problems and is this a factor or not?

e) Why did Termeh's tutor swear by the Koran (to Hodjat) that Nader didn't hear her in the kitchen talking to Razieh about her baby only to later change her testimony?

All of which hovers over one of the first questions asked : Why would anyone want to leave Iran (or any other country) in the first place? Is there something wrong with the society which isn't reducible to fallen humanity and thus will haunt us wherever we are, no matter how 'comfortable' or democratic a country we finally settle down in (assuming we do)?

And of course there's the final question EVERYBODY asks at the end: Who did Termeh eventually choose to be with, her dad or mom? Termeh, the quiet/hidden preventer of the matrimonial separation (a situation which led to all the other kinds of tearing apart) is finally required to STOP separating the separation - surely a fitting end to the film.

That Farhadi left this question hanging attests, maybe, to a philosophy of life whereby, yes, whilst some critical questions must be answered, nevertheless what's just as important is that space before the answer. (Notice, too, how almost everyone is in the movie seems to be in haste, moving fast, talking even faster, judging fastest, etc.?) That our personal and national trials require a logical pause before action, a few bars of nothing before the violins or drums come in, a few minutes before the ship lifts anchor, a formal gap between problem and resolution without which we could be repeating the problem, reliving it in the form of the solution i.e. our rushed mindsets may embody failure to separate the problem from the solution.

""A Separation"", then, begs us to make those separations we haven't yet done or even thought about. Because who knows maybe a fresh separation now and then is needed to put things (and life) back together again?",1330992000,8,5666,4.708080808080808
4598506,5,B0058GVP5U,"A SEPARATION is a film about a group of good, decent people who fall into enormous, soul-shattering ethical and legal dilemmas in part because they are trying to do good.  To be righteous.  To be free from sin.  To take care of their children.  And it all falls apart so easily, right before our eyes.

Set in modern day Iran, the issues of the film are very much rooted in that society...and yet they are universally understandable.  It's a tiny story and it's a big story that speaks to everyone.  It's important that the film is set in Iran, because of the laws and culture that will weigh so heavily on the main characters.  But it feels surprisingly relevant and very close & credible.

The film begins as the main couple of the story, Nader & Simin, are appearing before a judge of some kind.  They are intelligent, attractive, educated and fond of each other.  But their lives are about to take divergent paths.  Simin is asking for a divorce from her husband, because she wants to be able to leave the country with her teenage daughter, who is a bright, studious girl with a great future ahead of her in a country that doesn't put so many obstacles in front of women.  Nader does not want to leave, because he feels he must stay and take care of his Alzheimer's -ridden father.  Simin advocates that the father go into a home, because he doesn't know his son...and because the welfare of their daughter comes first.  Simin seems both callous to her husband's desire to tend to his beloved father, and she seems completely right too.  Her daughter NEEDS a chance to fulfill her promise.

The parents dote on their terrific girl.  She loves them.  She loves her wretched grandfather.  They are a terrific if troubled family.  But Simin moves out of the house, and Nader must hire a woman to tend to his father while he is at work.  Razieh comes to the job from a long commute away, accompanied by her small daughter.  She is likely from the country, and wears more traditional, conservative clothing.  She is lower class, devote, shy and frightened by the job she has undertaken.

From this simple setup develops a complicated story of misunderstandings, cultural roadblocks, honor betrayed, legal machinations and the sickening realization that everyone is digging themselves into holes from which they cannot emerge unscathed.

I don't want to tell you anymore, because the joy of this film lies in part in discovering its secrets.  All the characters, even Razieh's hot-headed husband, are mostly good people who make some small but unfortunate choices.  It's a chilling film in many ways, because while the passions run hot in these characters as they fight for their souls, they must maintain a mantle of politeness and respect.  Their culture demands manners, even as it prevents them from expressing what is REALLY on their minds.

This is a small story, as I said.  It involves primarily two families and their troubles.  Nothing that happens would ever make the news, even on a small scale.  The world churns on around them, completely oblivious to their plight.  And yet, for the viewer, the film quietly grabs your attention in its opening moments, and simply does not let go.  In part, this is because the script (Oscar nominated) makes each and every person a distinct, fleshed-out and understandable character.  If you've ever wondered what folks mean when they decry a movie's lack of character development, check out A SEPARATION.  You'll understand what true characters are.

The film is brilliantly acted, as well.  Every part offers juicy moments for the actors and they tear into their work.  Peyman Moadi as Nader and Leila Hatami as Simin are fantastic, but no one really lags behind.  Young Sarina Farhadi as the daughter Termeh is heartbreaking, and special notice must go to Ali-Asghar Shahbazi as the elderly father.  He's so immersed in his role, you forget utterly that this is an actor portraying a man with Alzheimer's.

For me, 2011 was not a great year for movies.  Very few moved me.  THE ARTIST and THE DESCENDANTS were delightful and excellent...but did not make me lean forward in my seat in utter engrossment.  Finally, A SEPARATION (even though I saw it in 2012) came along and in its subtle power, made me remember how worthwhile the wait is for a truly great movie.",1330819200,12,4311,4.764864864864865
4598507,5,B0058GVP5U,"A Separation, an Iranian film written and directed by Asghar Farhadi, is an intricate family drama set in current-day Tehran.  It won both the Golden Globe and Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film for 2011, and was also nominated for Academy's Best Original Screenplay Award as well.

The film begins with a couple explaining to a judge why they want a divorce.  Simin (Leila Hatami) wants to emigrate to another country where she feels they can have a better life for themselves and, more importantly, for their daughter, Termeh (Sarina Farhadi). They had filed the needed paperwork months ago and recently it finally came through. But her husband Nader (Peyman Mooadi), who had previously been agreeable to the idea, refuses to go, ostensibly because of his father who is suffering from Alzheimer's and now needs someone with him at all times.  Simin, fearing the opportunity may never come again, is determined to go regardless and wants to take Termeh with her. But under Iranian law, she needs Nader's permission for that and he refuses to give it.  So they feel that divorce is the only option left to them.  The judge says that this is insufficient grounds for a divorce and refuses to approve their request, leaving them without any resolution to their problem.  Simin, who had been looking after Nader's father, leaves their home and moves in with her family, while Termeh, who is in school, stays.

Their conflict becomes further complicated when Nader tries to find someone to look after his father while he is away at work.  He cannot afford a professional caretaker, so he ends up hiring a woman named Razieh (Sareh Bayet) who is a friend of a cousin of his wife's.  Complications arise almost immediately. Razieh, who has a young daughter and is pregnant with her second child, is reluctant to take the job but she desperately needs the money due to her hot-headed husband, Hodjat, (Shahab Hosseini) who is not only seemingly incapable of holding a job but is also being pursued by creditors.  But it is soon clear that Nader, unwilling to see just how bad his father's Alzheimer's has become, has underestimated the level of assistance his father now needs, and on the first day Razieh has to contend with Nader's father soiling himself because he no longer realizes when he needs to go.  The situation quickly deteriorates over the next couple of days and ends up in an argument between Nader, who comes home and finds his father alone and tied to the bed from which he has fallen, and Razieh who had left because she needed to go to the doctor. The argument ends up with Nader forcing Razieh from his apartment, and Razieh then falling on the stairs and ending up miscarrying.  This escalates the conflict between the two families, with charges and counter-charges being filed and both husbands faced with being jailed.

What makes A Separation really work is the level of complexity that Farhadi brings out in the characters.  There is no black-and-white here, no simplistic good-guys vs bad guys, only ordinary human beings having to deal with the kinds of problems that people all over the world have to deal with.  For the most part, all of Farhadi's characters are people who are trying their best to do what they feel the right thing is, but who nonetheless are all too humanly flawed - pride and stubbornness being first and foremost - and who are not above trying to twist things in their favor even when in their heart of hearts they know they're doing the wrong thing.  In lesser hands this would have been dealt with a comedic fashion, but in Farhadi's we are presented with realistic drama that everyone can relate to from their own lives.

There is also a subtleness present in A Separation which makes it both distinctly Iranian and yet universal at the same time.  The dynamics of culture permeate the film and one gets a sense of just what it means to be an ordinary Iranian without the skewing political bombast and rhetoric which is all that most people ever see.  The way in which the two families end up resolving their dispute in particular illustrates how different their culture is from ours. But at the same time, the characters in A Separation are universal in their lives, their situations and their human frailties as they try to cope with the same kinds of problems that people all over the world have to contend with.  In Farhadi's characters, we see ourselves and/or people we know.

Nader is, as Simin says to the divorce judge at the beginning of the film, a decent man and a good father to their daughter, the latter illustrated in scenes where he pushes Termah to be confident and stand up for herself.  And you can sympathize with Nader as he finds himself increasingly crushed by the need to try and care for his father.  Two brief scenes are particularly poignant.  In the first, where Nader and Simin are arguing before the judge, Simin tells Nader ""Your father does not even know you!"", to which Nader responds ""But I know him!""  And later, when he is alone and trying to get his father to change his clothes, and his father is no longer even aware enough to do anything but just sit like a lump, Nader struggles with the task, his father being too heavy even for him to handle alone, and finally he just breaks down weeping, realizing the impossibility of his situation, yet holding on to his father, unwilling to let go.  But for all of his good intentions, Nader is all too humanly fallible as well. In the conflict over his possibly having caused Razieh's miscarriage, he makes statements which he knows are not true, most particularly claiming not to have known that she was pregnant. And when his daughter, Termeh, catches him on this, he puts the moral burden on her, asking if she wants her father to go to jail. And later, when Termeh ends up lying to the judge to support his lie, and Nader sees what his unwillingness to admit the truth is doing to her, he still gives in to weakness and lets the lie stand rather than risk the consequences of telling the truth.

But Nader is not the only character with human weaknesses.  Simin tries to use Termeh as a way of getting Nader to go along with emigrating, just as Nader is using Termeh to keep Simin from emigrating.  And at the same time, Termeh tries to manipulate the situation to keep her parents from breaking up.  Hodjat, who is more flawed than any other character, tries to maniuplate the situation to get the money he needs to pay off his creditors. And even Razieh, who is the only one who is truly religious, is not above telling half-lies, partly out of pride and partly out of not wanting to admit being in the wrong.

In many ways, Razieh is one of the most intricately drawn characters in A Separation and serves to counter the common perception most people have of religious Iranians. Far from being the kind of militant shouting hard-liner we are presented with in the news, Razieh is simply someone who is devout in her faith and who is truly concerned with her everyday actions being proper within Islamic tenets.  In an early scene where Nader's father has soiled himself, she calls her imam to ask whether or not it is proper for her to clean him up and change his clothes (to which the imam responds that yes, given the circumstances, it is proper for her to do so).  Razieh is a person for whom sin is a very real thing with very real consequences, and this matters to her, even when doing the right thing comes with a heavy price.  She reminded me very much of an aunt of mine who was a very strict Catholic.  Again, this works for A Separation's universality, for even in secular societies we still have people - often in our own families - to whom this sort of thing still matters, and the film presents them in a way that we can relate to.

All of the actors give excellent performances, to the point that we feel that we're watching real people going through these crises in their daily lives rather than actors following a script. Payman Mooadi's Nader reveals much through his eyes and his expression, and while he works to keep his feelings under control, we see his inner turmoil on his face, particularly in the scenes where he knows he's setting the wrong example for his daughter, and worse, allowing his own weakness to emotionally blackmail her into doing what he's always tried to teach her is wrong.  The same goes for Sarina Farhadi's Termeh, whose eyes show the hurt and disillusionment she feels after she lies to the judge to support her father's lie. And Shahab Hosseini's Hodjat is a subtle performance, making an unlikeable character at least somewhat sympathetic as he rails about, blaming everyone else for his troubles, by showing him to be a man who simply has no control over himself and is constantly being undone by his emotional impulses and bad judgment.

To his enormous credit, Farhadi  does not give any of his characters easy outs for their problems. They do not get sudden magical insights, nor do they receive providential rescues. They must wrestle with them the way real people do and accept that the resolution, if it comes, may be far from satisfactory. We are reminded of this as the film ends, with Nader and Simin again outside the divorce judge's office, left waiting to find out which of them Termeh will decide to go with. The audience is left not knowing any more than they do.  No tiy resolution, no neat Hollywood ending, just life the way it really is for most people.

Highly, highly recommended.",1330732800,30,9496,4.6447761194029855

4598509,5,B0058GVP5U,"Bergman's Scenes from a Marriage inspired the opening scenes of the soon-to-be-separated husband and wife,Nader and Simin. They are shown in Iran talking into the camera in the position of the unseen judge in a divorce trial. The audience becomes the judge. The film is shot like a documentary,so the presence of the director/writer and camera crew are invisible. The director is able to skim over the details without focussing on them. These details,did the father know Razieh,the cleaner-help,was pregnant?Did he push her down the stair forcing her to have a miscarriage?Did he hear the tutor of his daughter give Razieh the doctor's telephone no?Did he brief her what to say?Did Nader know Razieh didn't tell her husband she was working at Nader's?These details later trigger critical situations forcing the audience to recall a scene to extract the importance of each detail. Razieth's scrupulous piety prevents her swearing on the Qur'an for money if it's not true. Termeh gets her father to confess.

The film is constructed like a Hitchcockian whodunit,a moral maze casually revealing the relativity of `truth', no one getting the moral high ground. This gives the film suspense. Little clues are given(as in a detective film)so the spectator or character puts these clues together to solve a mystery. The spectator leads his own inquiry. Apart from the static opening shots,the camera is constantly moving,framing and reframing tight groupings of people in confined spaces,shifting perspectives,not privileging any one viewpoint. The camera doesn't show all the details explicitly. Some angles prevent the viewer from seeing this,without the viewer suspecting the camera is hiding anything. To show everything would give the game away. Farhadi doesn't overwrite,we read between the lines,forcing the audience to think back to earlier scenes to understand better what is happening. The characters underplay the feelings,allowing the camera to pick up their intentions from their expressions and gestures.

The children are given pivotal roles,they are the real judges. Between the old man,Nader's father,who doesn't remember the past and the children who haven't had much life experience,what links the characters is they have no control over their own destiny. It is other people who tell them how to live their lives. Language and words exist for better communication between people,but they are also the source of misunderstandings. We see a separation between the middle-class secular couple and the working-class devout couple who are financially struggling. The film is less interested in probing the emotions of a fracturing marriage than in using the situation to question the ethical and moral dilemmas and issues of class and religion that face Iranians today. The relationship between the father and daughter is the central one. Nader's daughter Termeh emerges as the film's moral focus. She has to choose who to live with,her father or mother. She must already at age 11 decide her own fate,her 1st step as a grown-up. A film of great ambiguity and self-awareness stripping away all our prejudices about Iran and Iranian women.",1330387200,4,3146,5.353535353535354
4598510,5,B0058GVP5U,"Yes, I agree with all the others that this is a wonderful piece of work.  The two couples' unwanted entanglement in the judicial system, the strong emotions involved, and the shifting mix of truth-telling and concealment make for a strong story, masterfully told.

Other reviews outline the events very well. Some thoughts beyond the story itself:

How warm and real the relationships are. Nader has unconditional love for his old and senile father, who hardly even recognizes him. Both Nader and Simin adore their daughter, so much so that Nader knows as long as Termeh stays with him, Simin will never go the West. When Simin and Razieh talk, woman to woman, there is mutual respect that transcends class differences.

The Islamic clothing for the women didn't bother me - in fact the omnipresent headscarves looked quite attractive. It rapidly came to seem quite natural and suitable, not in any way ""suppressing"" them but in fact making one see them more fully as persons. I began to see why Muslims are bothered by the West's more revealing dress. Of course, we're not talking burkas here - these go way too far!

The sessions with the judge - very reminiscent of the French ""juge d'instruction"" - were fascinating. I could see the merits of a process that is absolutely dedicated to finding out the truth, not in creating the most plausible story. However, it would depend on all the judges being as steady and perceptive as the one in the film - is that possible? Hmm....

But finally the film's overriding merit is to remind us, vividly, that the people of Iran are just trying to live their lives, raise their children, get through their problems, just as we are. Something that some of the more demagogic politicians would do well to remember when they push for drastic and irreversible  actions.",1329609600,11,1806,4.806451612903226
4598511,4,B0058GVP5U,"A divorce in Iran isn't easy.  However, if both parties agree to everything, it's possible.  In this heartbreaking story, a couple has reluctantly agreed to part ways.  The woman, Simin (Leila Hatami) wants to leave the country to have a ""better life"" for the family, especially for their beyond-her-years smart 11 year old daughter Termeh (Sarina Farhadi, director Ashar Farhadi's daughter).  The husband, Nader (Peyman Maadi) is conflicted but refuses to move due to his elderly father's Alzheimers.

Termeh decides to stay with her father which then puts the brakes on Simin's departure.  Simin moves in with her family leaving Nader responsible for his father.  He hires a young mother to care for the older man.  The woman (Sareh Bayat) brings along her own young daughter to the man's apartment.  In one scene she is morally conflicted as to whether she is allowed to change the old man's pants when he soils himself.  In a clarifying point of her confliction she feels she must call the ""religion"" police to get a ruling.  Although barely showing, Razieh is also pregnant.  This is also hidden beneath her numerous layers of clothing.  This becomes an important issue in the story as to whether Nader knows of her condition.

On one day, Razieh must leave for a medical appointment, so locks the old man in the apartment and ties one hand to the bedpost to keep him from wandering around.  Before she can get back, Nader and Termeh return early and find the old man slumped on the floor unconscious.  This leads to an ultimate confrontation.  During the argument, Nader physically forces Razieh out of the apartment.  While we don't see everything that happens after that, she ends up in the hospital suffering a miscarriage.  Razieh and her husband inform the police and Nader is charged with murder.  Interestingly in Iran this doesn't appear to be a big deal for the police and the justice system.  A little ""blood money"" will fix everything.  Well, everything but pride and the truth.

This is a complicated film full of sympathetic characters.  All isn't what it seems and eventually young Termeh carries all the moral weight which she applies to all with a deft touch.  The pacing of this film is a bit tedious early on, but the second half is a riveting portrayal of rifts based on age, genders, religious beliefs, class distinctions and domestic struggles.  A wonderful movie and probable Oscar winner.",1329609600,9,2417,4.877149877149877

This dramatis personae is a witty metaphor, a cry in the darkness about the human condition, and the conflict between the ethical patterns inside a crude social reality that even takes place in a world forged by laws and the dramatic facts tht surpasses the spirit of the jurisprudence.

There are many dramatic situations apart the main one and that's precisely what it makes the film worth to watch it. Don't even leaves aside this monumental masterpeiece that must be chosen as the Best Foreign film within a week at the Academy Award. Watch it before awards ceremony takes place ud and judge for yourself whether it deserves this distinction or not.

If you have doubts, ultimately, make a clck on Gooogle and give yourself a tour about the countless number of awards that this film has received worldwide.",1329609600,8,1428,4.864197530864198

Many reviews have already given away the plot, but in essence this film is about the difficulties of life in Iran told through the misfortune of a split family who get into a bad situation that enables the director to tell the story of lower middle class Iranian life.

The wife wants to move abroad, the husband wants to stay because of his demented father. The daughter is caught in the middle. The family struggle with home help.

There is a twist in the story, which I shall not reveal, but when I saw this film, it was the only film I have ever seen where the entire audience waited through the WHOLE end credit sequence to witness the twist.

Brilliant, educated cinematography.",1329609600,41,713,4.546875
4598514,5,B0058GVP5U,"This is a masterful, unblinking, documentary-like description of the incredibly delicate relationships that exist between the members of any family. It should appeal to any adult who has ever a) been married; b) been a parent; c) cared for an elderly person; d) had a serious difference of opinion with a mate; e) tried to be a good person and do the right thing but was thwarted by circumstances and dilemmas; and f) tried to keep the peace at home by telling a white lie that eventually had unintended consequences.

In other words, the very mature subject matter and plot should be of interest to just about any adult anywhere in the world.

I wonder why Hollywood is incapable of making similar films.  The cost is minimal, but Hollywood would have to imagine a good story, write a realistic and intelligent screenplay and refrain from explosions.

[""The Kids Are All Right"" did an excellent job addressing the drama of family dynamics, but it seemed unable to move the focus away from sex and lesbianism.  ""The Kids..."" addressed only one tenth the number of adult issues that ""A Separation"" does. I wonder if Hollywood is still capable of complex adult family drama.]

The subtitles were not distracting at all.

The sympathetic depiction of Alzheimer's and its effects on all family members is very real, but not at all ""in your face"".

When living in Cairo for five years our family resided in three separate apartment buildings similar to those in this film. From time to time we'd hear a domestic dispute underway somewhere in the building, and, because the raised voices were in Arabic, we could only imagine what the dispute was about. This film showed me that what was going on in those Cairo apartments was similar to what happens in just about any American home at some point in time.

Strangely, after the movie ended, the entire audience remained sitting watching the lengthy credits which were in untranslated Farsi.  Clearly the audience was stunned by the intensity of the story.  You will be stunned as well.",1329004800,55,2029,4.818443804034582

8461527,5,B0058GVP5U,"The film is excellent. However, unless we were missing something, the film is not English dubbed and only offers English subtitles. This was hard since they speak so fast and Amazon states that it is in the English language. While this was offered for free from college professor, I chose to pay for it to make it easy and it sucked that it was not English dubbed.

Nonetheless, an unexpectant fun night watching this entertaining film.",1525564800,,436,4.7368421052631575
8461528,5,B0058GVP5U,"Excellent slice-of-life characterization.  The protagonists' human drama transcend their differences with a Western audience; yet we see how Iranian and Islamic culture entwine with and impose upon their actions and choices.  One notable difference between this story's Western counterpart is the notable lack of lawyers manipulating choice and outcome.  These people settle issues based on their own conscience.  All redeem themselves by eventually doing the right thing, much to their pain and suffering.  The emotional twists take a constant left turn until the final waiting scene in the hall.  Happy or not, it says, the story cannot really end with the closing credits but will haunt the rest of their lives.",1525305600,,714,5.387387387387387

8461532,5,B0058GVP5U,This is the 2nd Leila Hatami film I have seen. The first bring LEILA in 1996.  These Iranian filmmakers should be proud of this film.  It has all the qualities of the Hollywood films of the 1930s and 40s before Hollywood discovered special effects.  What is astonishing about this film is that it was well made under the censorship guidelines put on the film industry by the religious authorities.  The film is also a good look at contemporary Iran and day to day lives of Iranians.,1521244800,,482,4.569767441860465
