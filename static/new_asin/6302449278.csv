7826600,5,6302449278,"Amazing footage of Tejanos in daily life: breaking their backs in the fields, and enjoying family time at home. Great interviews and stories. Flaco teaching his young son how to play the accordion. And the final sequence with Los Alegres de Teran singing Volver Volver in a field - unforgettable! Touching film.",1483747200,,311,5.0
7826601,5,6302449278,"Chulas Fronteras is THE documentary ne plus ultra on tex-mex (norten~o) music, combining wonderful, authentic music past and present with up-front dialogue with the musicians who play it and the Tejanos whose roots are so  deeply intertwined with it.  Timothy Harding, an incredible and well-known  scholar of Mexican folk and art music, once told his class: ""I  sometimes think that if I had made that film I would die happy without  having done anything else...""  Dr. Harding is right.
