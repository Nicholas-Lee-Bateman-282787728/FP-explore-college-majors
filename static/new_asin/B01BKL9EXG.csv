7659040,5,B01BKL9EXG,"Watching this miniseries reinforced my desire to read the actual novel by Tolstoy. I'm a character development junkie and I loved watching how the characters grew and developed (or failed to) over time. The war, while devastating and violent, provoked change in the characters that might not have happened in the peaceful, wealthy Russian society, and the miniseries does an excellent job depicting this change in so many characters even though there are only 8 episodes. By then end, I found that I had compassion for characters that I started off disliking, and was happily surprised by the redemption and resolution by the final episode. The cinematography is gorgeous, and I'm not normally a big movie crier, but I loved these characters so much that I sobbed multiple times. My heart is full and ready to face the world with a little more empathy and courage, and if that doesn't make a good movie experience, I don't know what does. Thank you, BBC for this treasure.",1517875200,,972,4.86144578313253
7659041,5,B01BKL9EXG,"I liked this series a lot, altho, according to another reviewer, this wasn't the UK version, so it's a few minutes shorter than the UK version. I have not read the book. I didn't have any issue with Lily James being blond in this role, altho I understand Natasha was dark haired in the book. I guess I was used to seeing Lily as a blond because she was blond in Downton Abbey. James Norton as a dark haired Andrei was a little startling. Norton plays a light haired guy in another PBS series. The light hair seems to suit him better. I was glad the series included the epilogue from the book. I thought that was a more fitting ending than the one in the Audrey Hepburn movie.",1514851200,3,675,4.24031007751938
7659042,5,B01BKL9EXG,One of my favorites for this year. Fascinating (even more than the book). I bought it else where (I think Target) but I would cretainly recommend it.,1513728000,,149,4.555555555555555

7659044,5,B01BKL9EXG,Excellent production!,1510358400,,21,10.0
7659045,4,B01BKL9EXG,"I have a couple of confessions to make:

1) I watched this because I had heard good things about this production and because I didn't really want to spend the time reading the book
2) The first couple of episodes bored me, but I forced myself to keep watching

Truth be told, by the time I got to the end of the fourth episode, I was hooked and couldn't wait for the next one.

The final scene was a bit of a departure from the previous episodes. I suppose it mirrors the epilogues you'll find in the full novel. The final scenes are a glimpse into the lives of the Russian families who had survived this tumultuous period in history and is a clear jump into the future by a few years. It seemed as if it was shot with a different camera and at first I didn't like it. It seemed too modern, too fresh. But then I realized that perhaps this was the very statement the director intended to make  for these Russian families and Russia as a country. The novel War & Peace, a novel with various themes to include reaching an understanding of the various elements of life by experiencing their opposites, is set in Russia during a period of time that spans 15 years  1805 to 1820. During this time period, Russia is invaded by France with a force twice the size of the Russian regular army. Perhaps it is no coincidence that the novel (or at least this television adaptation) ends with a scene of bright, airy optimism and like stark contrasts of life and death, imprisonment and liberty, suffering and joy, sometimes a stark contrast is needed for the full weight of a message to be heard, felt, or seen. If you watch it with that perspective, I think youll enjoy this version of War & Peace from beginning to end. But even if that isn't your bowl of borscht, you may like this story (and this production) for the period costumes, the love affairs, and the scandals alone.

Also: For any Spanish speakers out there (or Spanish language learners), this does also have Spanish subtitles which I found to be quite good.

P.S. I watched this long before the Weinstein scandal broke. I don't watch a lot of film, so when the letters W E I N S T E I N flashed across the screen at the beginning and end of every episode, I thought to myself, Who is this Weinstein? Whoever he is, hes behind some great productions if this is any indicator. Well, guess what? I know who he is now. (Weinstein actually refers to The Weinstein Company, a company founded by Bob and Harvey Weinstein.) All I can say is this: Dont let that scandal taint your opinion of this production or keep you from seeing it. To do so would punish all of the wonderful actors, costume designers, and other hard-working individuals who gave their time and talent to this production. I don't know if this makes it any easier for you to consider purchasing in the future, but talks are already underway for the sale of the Weinstein company.",1509148800,,2901,4.411214953271028

7659063,1,B01BKL9EXG,"This has to rank as one of the worst BBC adaptations of a great novel. I think what is happening is that the BBC is going through all the great novels and trying to update them with pornographic themes. For some reason, the novel cannot be allowed to stand on its own merit, but it must be ""updated"" in the image of the idiots at the BBC. Well, this one failed abysmally. This was one of the most boring films I have ever watched. I could not stand it for longer than 30 minutes. I bitterly regret wasting 30 minutes on it that I can never get back.

7659064,5,B01BKL9EXG,"I absolutely love this production of War & Peace.  When I first heard that Paul Dano was cast as Pierre, I was doubtful, but his soulful portrayal of the main character has proven to be my favorite of the many actors who have played the part.  Lily James is magical as Natasha and all the actors are spot on, bringing the men and women of Tolstoy's novel to life.  The music is so moving, the dancing delightful, the palaces glittering and the battlefields horrific.  I laughed, I cried, I was brought to anger and fear.  The marvelous writing, the memorable scenes that stay with you long after viewing, the exquisite costuming, the atmosphere of Old Russia, invites all who watch to participate in something both grand and terrible.  It is the opposites that stay with you.  The beauty of place and the ugliness of violence; the good people and the bad; the wealth and the poverty; the catastrophe and the contentment.  Just finished watching for the third time and it never grows old.  Ah, Tolstoy, what would you make of today?",1495584000,2,1031,4.651933701657459

7659066,5,B01BKL9EXG,"This is a wonderful series. It was such a find for me, as I love historical drama. I found some scenes to be gratuitous, specifically the Count's decadent wife with her lovers.  The series didn't need these scenes to work and they seemed to be there just to please modern audiences. Nevertheless, the story is so beautiful and the end so hopeful, though not without its flaws - think of poor Sonya and her demotion from love of his life to maid to his children with another woman, that it perfectly accommodates the human condition in its disappointment. Loved it.",1494201600,,564,4.64
7659067,1,B01BKL9EXG,I threw this in the trash before I finished the second episode. It should have been rated TV-MA. I see no reason to watch a movie with graphic violence and sex scenes based on classic book without either.,1493164800,9,204,4.394736842105263
7659068,1,B01BKL9EXG,"I had high expectations of this miniseries. I have seen very good dramatizations, have read the book many times, and like several members of the cast.
Don't believe these silly rave reviews. I'm honestly wondering if someone got paid to write those. Pay attention to details. This is a highly anticipated BBC drama, starring popular actors, based on one of the greatest novels ever written, screenplay by the notable Andrew Davies, references the famous Napoleon Bonaparte etc etc. What a recipe for success, right?
But...
Almost immediately after it comes out, the DVD is super cheap on Amazon. I even found my copy at Goodwill! Viewers are getting rid of it and won't say why.
I will explain why.
This movie only has 3 things in common with the book: a very realistic character called Pierre ( excellently cast and well acted), tedious self conscious military sections ( Tolstoy was not at his best with that theme and neither is Andrew Davies. All these areas feel pompous and forced), and a very believable princess Mary Bolkonsky who never gets much attention from anyone, even the writers.
Other than that it's nothing like the book. All scenes felt rushed, and the presentation of the Kuragins was out of control crude. BE WARNED: this movie is disgusting. In the book, Helene is the Regency era equivalent of a brainless, greedy supermodel. This movie focuses on showing her as a scheming demon who makes out with her brother every chance she can get ( the screenwriter took ONE suspicion in Pierre's mind from the book and went WILD with it.) Anatole Kuragin in the book is a sexy irresponsible party guy. This Anatole was a homely pig who got almost no lines. Not sure that guy could successfully seduce even a birdbrain like Natasha.
Dolohov in the book is a ruthless soldier who hurts Pierre out of pure malice ( later gets enamored with the saintly Sonya ). This Dolohov was two- dimensional and gross.
Natasha and Nicholas are both blonde and neither did much with their roles. Sonya was well cast but had little screen time. Prince Andrey was good enough though the actor seems to labor under an idea that Andrey's main character flaw isn't so much pride but physical vanity. He marches everywhere with a self conscious smirk, as if he's recommending himself for working out and not being a chubby nerd like Pierre.
Ok, and one final comment: the music is TERRIBLE. Perpetual howling groaning monks in the background does not = a soundtrack. It's distracting from the story and doesn't fit most scenes. I haven't heard worse music since I watched Star Trek the original series. The only explanation I have for this ridiculous direction they took is they feel this story is not an epic about a war-- it is merely the tale of how a dimwitted geek finds himself married to a promiscuous psychopath, and feels like every day is his funeral, complete with groaning dirges.
Do not watch this movie. The bad outweighs the good. Not worth your time or your money.",1492732800,7,2970,4.7466150870406185
7659069,5,B01BKL9EXG,this is the best English language version. The 1972 BBC version with Anthony Hopkins looks like a filmed stage play and the sound quality varies from scene to scene. The 1972 version was obviously recorded on videotape instead of film. In the 2016 BBC version Lily James is the best screen version of Natasha as she is more age appropriate to the character than any other actress who played the role. One problem with this version is the difference in running time between the US & UK versions. Wikipedia says the BBC broadcast it in five 60-minute and one 82-minute episodes for a total of 382 minutes. But the US version as stated here on Amazon is 354 minutes - a difference of 28 minutes! For dvd purposes why edit out any minutes at all? Unless I am missing something the US dvd version is essentially a half-hour shorter than the BBC/UK dvd version.,1492214400,,855,4.558441558441558

I am familiar with many of the actors yet they were ill used here, barely meeting their potential.  The actor playing the main character is annoying, the musical soundtrack drones on and on (and on) and there is nothing interesting about any of the characters in this story.  As for films about Russia, give me something like Young Catherine with Julia Ormond who provided energy and power to her role, as well as her lover the Count.  Also loved Bleak House, Little Dorrit and Wives and Daughters.  Any film with any story in any location can include engaging performances.

7659085,5,B01BKL9EXG,"This TV version of War and Peace was so beautifully done--both visually and aurally absorbing. The use of the Russian Orthodox chants during some of the most emotional scenes, such as Pierre's duel with Dolokhov--and Lily James was absolutely lovely as Natasha Rostov. James Norton was well cast as Prince Andrei, but the dark dye on his hair was kind of a distraction. I don't understand the reason for it, and it looked fake. The standout actor, to me, was Paul Dano as Pierre. He perfectly conveyed the combination of idealism, confusion, awkwardness, and sweetness of that character.  However, I also loved Jessie Buckley as Princess Marya, and I don't like the fact that the American version of the series excluded the scenes when Prince Vasily and his son Anatole go to Bald Hills to try and woo her, only for Anatole to screw it up by flirting with Mme. Bourienne. I thought at least this and other annoying omissions would be rectified in the DVD, where the scenes that were shown in Britain but not in the U.S. could be either reinserted or at least on the DVD as an extra feature, but sadly, the DVD was a disappointment in that regard.

I should be given that War and Peace has been called one of the greatest novels ever written. The cast is certainly qualified, and no expense was spared on backdrops and costumes. So why does it feel so flat? I've been watching this for two and a half weeks and am only on episode 4. It's what I watch when there is nothing else appealing.

When I am watching this, I feel as though I am peeking in the window of a party watching people that I don't know, don't care about, and have nothing in common with. I am never drawn in. They never feel like they have flesh and blood or even feelings. It's  really cold feel.

Gratefully, unlike the 2007 version, there were no major changes in the plot.  Though there was a disproportionate amount of time spent on Helene, her portrayal was accurate.  The one criticism is that it failed to convey the enormity of the battle of Borodino where 250,000 battled for one day with 70,000 casualties. Though I  wish Lily James could cry some real tears, she was still an excellent Natasha.  Paul Dano's Pierre was excellently acted, but he did not look the part.",1483056000,,827,4.655172413793103

7659096,5,B01BKL9EXG,"The BBCs 2015 production of War and Peace meets the challenge of condensing Tolstoys 1,000-page epic novel containing 500 named characters down to six hours of watchable screen time by focussing on 14 main characters at the core of the story. Through their eyes we experience the machinations of the Czarist aristocracy in the early 1800s struggling to increase family wealth through status-enhancing marriages, and the cataclysmic invasion of western Russia by Napoleons Grande Armee. These dramatic backdrops are used to frame the core characters personal development and interactions as they undergo deep, transformative, life-changing experiences.

Tolstoys novel is renowned for its discursions on philosophy and social justice, the relationship of the individual to society and our place in the universe, but the heart of the story is about family and the resultant bonds of love & duty. This 2015 production focuses on three of the five families central to the action: the Bezukhovs, the Rostovs and the Bolkonskys. Comparisons have been made with the much longer 1972 BBC series (20 episodes covering 17 hours of screen time), the earlier production a more stretched-out epic offering space for the characters to develop slowly in the framework of a longer narrative and for a larger cast of minor characters in the novel to play meaningful roles, whereas this shorter six-hour 2015 production inevitably forces severe pruning of the peripheral narrative threads in Tolstoys book.

Cinematically the 2015 production is magnificent: the costuming, the opulent 18th century interiors, the stunning landscapes covered with snow or summer flowers, the banquet tables, carriages and sleighs, and a thousand fine details is a continual feast for the eye and the mind. The state-of-the-art CGI is flawlessly integrated into the action and particularly effective in the battlefield scenes.

The casting is faultless: American actor Paul Dano conveys all Pierres innocence, idealism and goodness (with an impeccable British accent) plus his social awkwardness and naivety, James Norton the introverted, dutiful and courageous Andrei, Lily James nails the best-ever onscreen Natasha Rostova and Tuppence Middleton as the conniving, self-serving Helene is superb in a difficult and complex role (Tuppence finally gets her come-uppance in a very nasty way). Gillian Anderson is excellent as Anna Pavlovna Scherer; Jessica Buckley impressive as Andreis pious & devoted sister Marya; Aisling Loftus, Stephen Rea, Brian Cox all deliver fine, compelling performances. The screenwriting, editing and pacing are also very good.

My only gripe is that due to the constraint of six hours screen time, this otherwise excellent production feels too rushed. A longer production (like the BBCs 20-hour 1972 production) does Tolstoys novel better justice and enables the deeper themes to be explored, with more time for the character developments at the heart of the book. As an example Pierres prolonged encounter with the simple but wise Platon Karataev when both are prisoners of the French Army, so vital to his enlightenment and character transformation in the book, is skipped over in five minutes before the plot again races onto the next scene. However, this production is what it is: a fine piece of work with a coherent narrative & a great introduction to the book for younger viewers unfamiliar with Tolstoy. While too short, this 2015 production is nevertheless another notable triumph for the BBC drama department.

The picture and sound quality of the Blu-ray release is superb, the menus basic but functional and easy to use. The brief extras include scenes deleted from the finished edit, a feature about how the orchestral music was integrated into the film and how Count Rostovs folk dance was designed & choreographed.",1482364800,3,3820,5.381270903010034

7659109,3,B01BKL9EXG,"My copy of this dvd was audibly ""wobbly"" at points, so I will give this rendition of War and Peace  a bit of a pass for that shortcoming. The sets, settings and battle scenes are first rate (hence my 3 star rating!). My quarrel is with the casting of 2 of the main lead actors. Lily James is shockingly amateurish - never do we feel she is anything but the lucky recipient of a high school drama tryout. Her portrayal of Natasha is woefully amateurish. Nor do we feel Natasha is a young woman yearning for life to begin. She either pouts or grins throughout the production. Yet we are told she is irresistibly beautiful and wonderful by everyone.

As for James Norton as Andrei - he is a handsome guy, unhappy with life and determined to end it as soon as possible fighting Napoleon in 1815 Russia. He also pouts and seems like a moody, spoiled twenty-something. When he finally gets his ""wish"", I felt nothing - except relief my suffering as well as his was over!

Only Paul Dano gives anything like a modulated performance as Pierre. He is the only one with any real ""issues"" to be unhappy about. The ending is unctuous and trite. My advice? Don't be lazy; read Tolstoy's War and Peace or even latch onto the old film starring Audrey Hepburn.

7659128,5,B01BKL9EXG,"When reading about Napoleon, French historians portray him as a glorified war hero. Tolstoy presents the other side, how the war impacted the Russian people, and their preoccupation with him. Their anxiety and fear of sending loved ones off to possible slaughter. Happier times were filled with festive, lavish dinners and ballroom dances. The dynamics of intriguing relationships with likable, kind (Pierre, Natasha or Tasha, and Marya) and not so likable, scheming self-promoters (sister and brother, Helene and Anatole). ""As long as there is life, there is happiness"" - Pierre. What humanity this great literary work captures!",1472688000,10,629,5.494845360824742
7659129,5,B01BKL9EXG,"I have seen all of the movies/TV adaptations of this masterpiece. Tom Harper's last rendition is the best of all, by far. It concentrates on the human factors and just touches on the slaughter of conscripted morons under the command of the demented Napoleon or, the unfortunate Kutuzov. A superior screenplay and direction. Elegant and fresh casting makes it a truly beautiful piece to watch. Comparing it e.g. with Bondarchuk's epic, Harper's actors are 10-20 years younger and 10-20 kg lighter. King Vidor's ""Pierre"" (Henry Fonda) doesn't cut it at all and, Bondarchuk's ""Pierre"" is even worse.",1472601600,5,596,5.154639175257732

I absolutely loved this. I was a little hesitant starting off, but I love Paul Dano so I figured I would give it a go. It draws you in, and even though it's only 8 episodes, it feels like a whole 22 episode season with how much happens. Do not watch this if you are not prepared to cry. The scenes of war are very graphic and slightly disturbing at times. It really is a beautiful story and definitely a timeless one. If you are hesitant, I urge you to at least watch the first episode because I guarantee you it will suck you in.",1471478400,,788,4.116883116883117

Takes a couple of episodes to get past the 'veddy' English accents (and one American) of 19th century Russian characters, and occasionally the acting is a bit overwrought, but Andrew Davies' script - while not especially lyrical or reminiscent of Tolstoy - delivers a moving, well-told version of this long, complex story. Beautifully filmed - especially the battle landscapes and countrysides - gorgeous costuming, an excellent and diverse cast, and a film score that energizes the plot.

7659173,5,B01BKL9EXG,"WAR & WOW. War & Peace is one Leo Tolstoy classic. This adaptation by writer/producer Andrew Davies (Little Dorrit South Riding House of Cards much more) is masterful. Every aspect, costume, set, location, music, props, action, cinematography, writing, choreography it is all impressive, worthy of the historic book of 1869. Much of the success is also due to the astonishing high level of the large cast. Too many major players to mention but here are a few:
Paul Dano perfects the Pierre role in his most stellar performance to date.
Andrei performed by James Norton (Grantchester).
Rostov cousins Natasha (Lily James Downton Abbey) & Sonya (Aisling Loftus -Mr Selfridge) play off of each other like they were real cousins.
Jim Broadbent with his career of great roles tackles Andreis father more than successfully.
Rebecca Front (Death comes to Pemberly Insp Lewis) plays menacing Anna.
Gillian Anderson (Bleak House) marries Andrei, birthing a son.
Brian Cox (The Slap) is Russian Gen Kutozov.
Even several small single episode parts are huge; like Adrian Rawlins (Harry Potter Dickensian) as Platon, a prisoner.
Too many more to mention them all.

SDH SUBTITLES for all episodes & bonus. There is much discussion on length. My purchased DVD box (cover left black, right white, and portraits of Pierre, Natasha, & Andrei) states 357 minutes and has 8 episodes.
&nbsp;1805 Russia warring with Napoleon. Illegitimate Pierre and social misfit defends Napoleon. Friend Andrei enlists to fight the French.
&nbsp;Winter 1805.  Pierre weds Helene . . . but! Andrei and his brother-in-law Nikolai survive the 1st battle.
&nbsp;Pierre duels over wife Helene. Natasha and Sonya get marriage proposals in Moscow. Marya assists Andreis labor.
&nbsp;Spring 1809 to Winter 1810. Relationships come and go. Pierre having joined the Masons, works for bettering others. De directs Andrei to quickly propose. Natasha attends her first grand ball, the Tsars Ball.
&nbsp;Natasha is frustrated that a marriage is not at hand, leading to temptation. Pierre tries to mend woes. Napoleon marches an army to Moscow.
&nbsp;Summer 1812. Russia is under attack by the French. Nikolai assists Marys family exit. Pierre cares for ill (depressed) Natasha.
&nbsp;Battle of Borodino, biggest Napoleon vs. Russia battle, and Pierre and Andrei are on the front line. French enters Moscow causing Natasha & Rostovs to flee as Pierre plots to personally assassinate Napoleon.
&nbsp;Russian winter sets in and Pierre remains a prisoner. War, nay peace, continues. Russian aristocrats find need to adjust. Napoleon retreats Moscow. War & Death. War & Survival. War & Love. The unforgettable climax of War & Peace.
As long as there is life, there is happiness.

7659182,2,B01BKL9EXG,"Sadly disappointed. I had really looked forward to this miniseries. However, for me, it came up very short in comparison to the 1972 BBC series. Yes, on the surface, it was much prettier to look at. The colors were richer, the outdoor shots, and many of the indoor ones, appear to be on actual Russian locations, notably in St. Petersburg. The costumes were gorgeous, although I cannot judge their historical authenticity. Still, somehow the characters lacked depth and never really came to life for me they way they did in the earlier series. That earlier series was over twice as long, and this may have allowed the character development I found so lacking in this version. I also thought there were some dubious casting choices, notably Paul Dano as Pierre Bezukhov. Nothing really wrong with Dano's acting, but I thought he just looked too much like a Hogwarts student who had wandered into the set from an adjacent studio filming a Harry Potter movie. Anthony Hopkins was much superior in the role. I also liked 1972's Alan Dobie much better than a rather wooden James Norton as Prince Bulkonsky . My final casting nit is that neither of the actors playing Napoleon and Czar Alexander( the ""kings"" on the opposite sides of the chessboard of national conflict), looked  the part. In particular, the actor playing Alexander looked absolutely nothing like the very tall, golden-haired Czar  portrayed in contemporary paintings. And yes, yet again, the 1972's Donald Douglas did very much look the part.
 This newer version does have more skin, and moves more rapidly. I think it will be reasonably entertaining to many. Still,  if you haven't figured it out yet, I am going to strongly recommend the earlier series over this one. The pace will be slower and the first episode, like the first chapter of the book, will be a bit difficult. Hopefully, in the end,  you will find the experience as rewarding as I did.",1462060800,39,1915,4.826219512195122

7659184,5,B01BKL9EXG,"This latest adaptation of WAR & PEACE, Leo Tolstoys classic novel, is absolutely magnificent; visually stunning with a engrossing screenplay by Andrew Davies, and a flawless cast under the impeccable direction of Tom Harper.

In the interest of full disclosure, I must admit that Ive never read Tolstoys book and the only other version of WAR & PEACE Ive seen is the 1956 movie with Audrey Hepburn and Henry Fonda, which, at 208 minutes in length, required a considerable amount of streamlining from the massive novel.

The new (2016) eight-part mini-series from the BBC and The Weinstein Company runs a total of 357 fascinating minutes, thus it is able to explore the characters and situations with more depth.

Without going into a full synopsis of WAR & PEACE, but for the benefit of those people who are totally unfamiliar with the work (Sadly, a growing number in todays world), the story is set in Czarist Russia during the early 1800s as Napoleons armies edge closer to that countrys borders.  The key characters are members of or aligned with three aristocratic Russian families.  Love affairs and illicit liaisons abound in the often soap opera-like plot.

Paul Dano, Lily James and James Norton head the cast, which also includes Gillian Anderson, Brian Cox, Stephen Rea, Greta Scacchi, Tuppence Middleton and Jim Broadbent.

The two-disc DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment includes six Behind the Scenes featurettes.

7659185,4,B01BKL9EXG,"Leo Tolstoy's ""War and Peace"" is a true historical epic -- it's well over a thousand pages long, spans several years, and fearlessly tackles subjects from warfare to social reform, from love to loss.

So it's hardly surprising that the BBC's adaptation of ""War and Peace"" requires six hours to tell the sprawling story, which follows three passionate young Russians through the travails of war, love and beliefs (both religious and political). It's a polished, gilded affair that shows all the beauty and decadence of tsarist Russia, mingled with the blood-spattered ugliness of war -- it sometimes gets a bit bogged down in the complexity of its story and cast, but the sweeping scope of the story cannot be denied.

The story takes place in the early 1800s, when Napoleon has invaded Austria and was preparing to invade Russia. Three young Russians are coming of age at the time -- the sweet and romantic Natasha Rostova (Lily James), who desperately wants to fall in love; Andrei Bolkonsky (James Norton), a young man dissatisfied by the shallowness of his life, and determined to go to war; and Pierre Bezukhov (Paul Dano), a kind-hearted and idealistic (but easily led) young man, who is the illegitimate son of Russia's wealthiest noble.

When Pierre unexpectedly inherits his father's fortune and title, he finds himself suddenly the target of the cruelly mercenary Hlne Kuragina (Tuppence Middleton), even as Natasha is entranced by Hlne's dissolute brother Anatole (Callum Turner). Andrei is wounded during his brief stint in the war, and his craving for a life with meaning leads to a terrible loss for himself and his family, as well as a burgeoning love for Natasha. As the French invade Russia, these three and their families will be forced to face the perils of war, and the broken world they must rebuild.

Obviously a lot more than just war and romance is going on here -- there is a vast web of characters living in light-filled palaces, whose lives and fates are all bound up together through affairs, social-climbing, money, class, favors and secrets. With so many people woven into the story, there is plenty going on, including duels, gambling, saving kids from burning buildings, an incestuous relationship, and the occasional policeman tied to a swimming bear.

It's a credit to screenwriter Andrew Davies and director Tom Harper that the luminous purity at the book's core is still here, represented by the flawed idealism of the three lead characters. And through them, the story takes on an appropriately epic scope, from elegant balls to the pale-skied, snow-encrusted fields -- and even more important, we witness the dazzlingly smooth interplay between the different layers of a society (religion, political strife, personal kindness... and yes, war and peace). If there's a problem, it's that ""War and Peace"" sometimes gets bogged down in its own complicated subplots, of which there are MANY.

And visually, this miniseries is a truly beautiful experience -- the camera lingers just long enough on vast vaulted rooms filled with light and silk gowns, but brings equal luminosity to simpler places and people (such as the kindly Marya). Even in the darker moments (a woman draped across a silken bed, with the camera panning to reveal that her flowing white dress is drenched in blood), it often feels like we're watching a series of paintings come to life.

It also has a very solid cast -- Dano and Norton perfectly embody a shyly earnest boy-man who seeks to better the world, and a world-weary proto-hipster who grows noble and heroic. They revolve around Lily James for much of the story, and she does an excellent job as well -- she initially plays Natasha as a wide-eyed teen waif, and gradually matures into an elegant lady, and then a powerful young woman. These three are backed by an even more solid supporting cast, including Middleton, Gillian Anderson, Jessie Buckley, Jack Lowden, Turner, and many more.

The adaptation of ""War and Peace"" is a dazzling affair, full of visual beauty and a fair amount of fidelity to the original novel. Harrowing, luminous and powerfully written -- and the people who made it deserve plenty of praise.",1459209600,6,4179,4.977077363896848
7659186,4,B01BKL9EXG,"War and Peace is one of the greatest novels of all time, a rich and stunning evocation not just of its title themes but also of love, family, duty, economics, politics and patriotism. On publication its vast-ranging story and topics confounded and dumbfounded critics. In the 20th and 21st centuries, the novel's startling length and breadth has likewise stymied countless scriptwriters and would-be adaptations. Although the book has been filmed for the cinema and the television at least eight times, compromises have always had to have been made for expense (the Battle of Borodino, the bloodiest battle of the Napoleonic Wars, plays an important, central and budget-annihilating role), length (at 590,000 words the novel significantly outlengths even The Lord of the Rings) and, well, boredom (the book features massive and digressive essays by Tolstoy about numerous facets of Russian society).

The BBC's latest tilt at Tolstoy's windmill is lavish, with massive, CG-enhanced battle scenes and huge party and ballroom scenes. Crucially, the series was able to film scenes in Russia, Latvia and Lithuania where some of the real events took place to add some authenticity. However, this is compromised by brevity: the BBC adaptation clocks in at just six episodes and approximately six-and-a-half hours of screen time. Excellent for those whose patience is in short supply, but dubious for those hoping for a faithful recreation of the book.

Against the odds, the result is a highly watchable drama series. Andrew Davies is one of the BBC's oldest, most reliable and steadiest hands at adapting massive 19th Century novels for the screen and he came to War and Peace fresh, not having previously read it. This may cause howls of outrage from some quarters, but Davies' lack of previous experience with the book works in his favour in this case, as it allows more ruthless but practical paring back of the book's colossal cast (the novel has over 500 named characters) and subplots to focus on the book's core.

At its heart, War and Peace is not really about the war or the peace, but about family. The three central figures of Pierre (Paul Dano), Natasha (Lily James) and Andrei (James Norton) have their own struggles as they try to satisfy their families and their hearts, making compromises or decisions for the greater good that they later come to regret. One of the reasons the book has endured is that it is possible for anyone from any time or place to empathise with this central trio's life problems, such as feeling trapped by society into a role or job for which they are ill-suited, or trying to help their family survive a period of financial hardship. Both Davies' lean and economical script and the excellent performances from the central trio keep these elements intact on the screen. Dano, in particular, gets across Pierre's frustration and befuddlement across without it dipping into annoyance. Careers have been made on getting Pierre right (a role played by a very young Anthony Hopkins in the 1970s BBC mini-series) and Dano pulls it off well.

Where the show falters is its handling of the over-arcing political storyline. The novel features an early meeting between the Tsar and the Emperor which sets the tone for how the French and Russians relate to each other subsequently (later mirrored in a scene where Pierre - reluctantly - plays host for a French officer during the occupation of Moscow). However, the TV series dispenses with this scene, gives the Tsar only a couple of very brief scenes but then has Napoleon showing up to mutter pithy statements every now and then. It feels like either the entire high political/military story should have been ejected (save perhaps Boris Drubetskoy coming face-to-face with Napoleon briefly) or the TV series should have embraced the book conceit of featuring the historical figures more prominently. As it stands, Napoleon's invasion of Russia comes out of nowhere for the less historically astute viewer. Another slightly awkward element is the substitution of English for Russian (French stays in French), which becomes a bit bizarre when Russian songs are then sung in Russian.

More laudably, as it's an element that is easy to eject from the story, Davies tries to get to grips with Tolstoy's musings on serfdom and the betterment of the people. Tolstoy himself spent a lot of time trying to improve the lot of the serfs and peasants on his estate and Pierre can be seen as something of an author-insertion character in this sense. Although it's not a major storyline, it does provide two of the best moments of the series: Pierre stacking a couple of bundles of wood and then sitting down to enjoy the sun, apparently believing he is now a hard-working outdoorsman; and Pierre as a prisoner bonding with a poor peasant-soldier and his dog on the devastating retreat from Moscow.

Ultimately, the BBC adaptation of War and Peace (****) cannot hope to match the power and scope of the novel. But it does provide six and a half hours of watchable drama, well-played and with the core themes and storylines of the book kept intact.",1459036800,45,5112,4.973099415204678

I had not read the novel, so cannot comment on any unfaithfulness to the plot, but I can say unequivocally that this interpretation is a riveting tale. Central to the story is the character of Pierre Bezukhov, sensitively portrayed by Paul Dano. Pierre, an innocent and trusting soul, has his romantic illusions of war shattered through battlefield experiences and his subsequent imprisonment by the French. Yet through the trauma he retains his sweetness and faith in his fellow man, growing wiser without bitterness. The sets, the costumes, the acting, are all superb. Special mention must be made of Lily James in the role of Natasha Rostova, who learns the meaning of growth through pain. Also impressive is Adrian Edmondson, who plays her dithering but kind father Count Ilya Rostov. Warning - the battle scenes and treatment of war prisoners are intense and not for the faint of heart. But Tolstoy's theme of enduring love and redemption shines through it all. The scope and power of this story lends itself to the large screen, which makes its successful adaptation to the smaller one even more impressive.",1531872000,,1271,5.115384615384615
