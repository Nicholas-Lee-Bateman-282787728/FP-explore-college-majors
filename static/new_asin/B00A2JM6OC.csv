8546257,3,B00A2JM6OC,"This is a solid version of Les Mis and if you watch it then you will most likely not be disappointed - unless you are a hard-core fan of the book version, in which case you will be appalled.

Pros:
Good acting all around
Quick and fast-paced movie version
Excellent scenes between Neeson and Rush (especially Javert's death at end)
Cosette and Marius interplay is well done

Cons:
Lots of liberties taken with Hugo's actual story from the book
Very short and lots of characters missing (where are the Thenardiers?!?)

Summary:  As a big fan of the book and musicial I am on a quest to see all the versions. This was one of the better movie versions and while it was short, it is still a worthwhile view",1419120000,,702,4.4186046511627906
