8652916,4,B00JPPKAG0,"I am a big fan of older movies and bigger fan of the older ""Gangster era"" movies. I have watch several George Raft movies and enjoy most of them but not a big fan of him personally. As far as this movie it is one of his better ones. The movie moves along at a decent pace and keeps you interested and waiting to see what happens. The acting is above average but again Mr. Raft's acting is still just ""a little stiff"". As I mentioned I do enjoy watching his movies but his acting just appears like he is going through the motion. I have it in my collection and will watch it again and again but I still have others by him I enjoy more. Would buy it again if needed.",1449964800,3,664,4.0
8652917,5,B00JPPKAG0,"I love film noir movies!  Movies made in an era when Men and Women REALLY acted!!!  It's nice to see movies with class and character instead of sex, nudity, blood and gore!",1443744000,4,172,4.34375
8652918,5,B00JPPKAG0,"I was very excited when I received this DVD in a timely manner.  Race Street is a very difficult movie to find, either on DVD or VHS.  I recorded on VHS years ago, and of course the quality is not as clear as I am certain it will be on DVD.  George Raft is one of my all time favorite actors. I am looking forward to watching the movie on DVD",1437436800,,342,3.788732394366197
