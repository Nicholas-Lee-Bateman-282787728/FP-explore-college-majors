7498846,4,B017CGWJ7G,"This was one of the best Royal Rumbles I have ever seen, definitely an improvement from last year. However, I'm sure that I'm not the only one who was disappointed with Triple H becoming world champion. Other than that, best royal rumble in the last few years.",1455235200,,260,4.553191489361702
7498847,4,B017CGWJ7G,"Last Man Standing Match: Intercontinental Champion Dean Ambrose vs. Kevin Owens - Both men started trading fist at the bell with Ambrose begging Owens to give him everything he delivered a suicide dive that temporarily took out more than just Owens as things got more physical using the ringside environment & weapons from a chair to tables along with sacrificing themselves just to keep their opponent down with some of their plans with the weapons not working to their advantage as they had various counters & reversals to each other's trademark offense in a match that can only be described in one word: PHYSICAL!

Tag Team Champions New Day vs. Usos - The Usos were dominate early before New Day were able to use a distraction & their numbers to get the advantage with both teams executing their trademark offense from the Usos going aerial from not just the top rope but outside as well & doing moves resembling their samoan family while New Day utilized Big E's power & Kofi's athleticism while with their usual entertaining antics in another good match between these two teams.

United States Champion Alberto Del Rio vs. Kalisko - The rubber match between these two after trading the championship in the past month with both men pulling off some big moves early from the suicide dive to top rope enzinguri kick as Kalisko attempted some past paced lucha libre influenced high risk moves which didn't always pay off as Del Rio was able to catch & use his momentum against him on more than one occasion while Del Rio also used his superior size & strength in a good back & forth encounter.

Divas Champion Charlotte vs. Becky Lynch - Becky took control early on working over the arm with a series of armdrags that were straight out the playbook of a former rival of Charlotte's dad causing Flair to do something straight out of one his classic trademark catchphrase as a distraction for Charlotte to take advantage using her legs to work her opponent over as they traded momentum hitting big moves & countering others with Flair getting physically involved from the outside in a good match but was more memorable for the aftermath when someone made their intentions clear towards both divas & the championship.

WWE Championship Match/Royal Rumble Battle Royal - The WWE Championship is on the line for the second time in history in the Royal Rumble match but the first time that the champion comes in the match defending the championship in Roman Reigns with him also given the task to having to last the entire match from start to finish being the first entrant.  Various highlights throughout the match include who were the first two entrants & the irony behind it when it came to the year before, a ""phenomenal"" debut, R-Truth's ""My Bad!"" moment, how Kofi Kingston avoided elimination this year, one man being taken out of the action, Kevin Owens' past coming back to haunt him, one group's complete domination for several moments, ""The Beast"" vs. ""The Buzzards"", which entrant decided to do double duty as a commentator, Triple H's return & eventual victory (and for those complaining out spoilers, just look at the DVD cover!) but the surprising person he finally eliminated to do so.  I'll say without a doubt this was the best actual Rumble match in years as they eliminated things that have drawn negative criticism & backlash in the previous years.

The pre-show match was a fatal four way tag match in Dudley Boyz vs. Mark Henry & Jack Swagger vs. Darren Young & Damien Sandow vs. Ascension where the winning team earns two spots into the Rumble match.  Overall I enjoyed the Rumble from top to bottom & definitely a strong show to start out the calendar year & ""Road To WrestleMania"" that I would check out",1454803200,3,3724,4.753869969040248

7498849,4,B017CGWJ7G,"The Last Man Standing Match For The Intercontinental Title: Dean Ambrose vs. Kevin Owens was an awesome match where both guys put their bodies on the line and there was a decisive conclusion to it. The final bump by Owens looked a little risky, but he was able to land safely. It sounded painful! I like how they had some outstanding spots for the near finishes. Ambrose hit Dirty Deeds twice yet Owens was able to avoid losing. Owens nailed his Popup Powerbomb and Ambrose was able to get to his feet too. Stuff like Owens rolling to the floor to break the count is so clever. Then Owens countering the suplex with one of his own to drive Ambrose through the table. Then there was the decisive ending that was the kind of massive bump by Owens that you don't see very often. This was also the third PPV in a row where Ambrose beat Owens. I would say that ends the feud and I hope that Owens isn't hurt by it. The good thing is that Owens is such a good talker that will always get a reaction. He does need to be booked stronger, though. With that said, a match like this helps to legitimize the Intercontinental Title. Two awesome wrestlers put on a very entertaining match that is already an early match of the year contender. No complaints from me when you can start a PPV off with a match thats over four stars out of five. The Tag Team Titles: The New Days Big E & Kofi Kingston vs. The Usos was the usual very good tag match from two teams that are familiar with eachother. What an awesome finish with Big E showing up as a surprise to Jey to nail the finisher. It was the right call to keep the titles on The New Day because they're the best team in the company and there wasn't that much of a build up to this match. There wasn't any point in the match where I thought The Usos might win the titles. The crowd reactions were telling. As great as The New Day are as champions, they are getting cheered a lot more and The Usos were booed, so I hope it doesnt lead to a turn for The New Day. They won't be as entertaining as faces because faces get less promo time and aren't allowed to be as creative as when they are heels. Im not sure who The New Day might feud with after this. Perhaps its time to call up the Enzo & Cass team from NXT because that would be an awesome feud. The US Title: Alberto Del Rio vs. Kalisto was a good title match to put over Kalisto again. If this was the first US Title win for Kalisto then it would be a huge moment. The problem is theyve done three title changes in about three weeks now. It doesnt feel like a big deal because the title loses its value with all of the title changes. I think some of their other matches were better, but maybe Im just tired of it after writing about four of their matches in the last few weeks. Is he going to lose it again? I hope not. I picked Del Rio to win, but I have no problem with the change because this show needed a change in one of the undercard matches and this one was the best choice. Kalistos had a lot of momentum since his big spot at TLC last month, so it is as if WWE is rewarding him for that. The Divas Title: Charlotte vs. Becky Lynch was a really good match full of action and some awesome near finishes as well. I liked the intensity of both women and the way they built it up. While I expected Charlotte to win, they did a good job of building up some big spots for Becky as well. The crowd really wanted her to win and they were pissed off when Flair cost Lynch the match. The jacket spot was unique, thats for sure. I thought Flair was pretty hilarious outside the ring and his presence gives Charlotte a lot of heel heat. The Royal Rumble for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship was a pretty good Rumble that was better than the last couple of years, so thats a positive at least. It was entertaining at times, but the ending didn't excite me much at all. I know a lot of people predicted it. I figured it was a very possible choice too. I just didn't want it to happen because to me putting the title on Triple H again is a step backwards. Hes 46 years old. Whats he gonna do, put over Roman for the WWE Title at WrestleMania? Thats nice, but Roman is already a two-time champion and a match like that feels predictable. Reigns got screwed at Survivor Series and then he lost clean here. If Triple H was going to win, it should have been a lot cheaper than this. In WWEs defense, injuries forced their hand with this booking. They weren't left with that many options. Doesnt mean this was the best choice. I just kinda shrug my shoulders and move on. I look forward to other feuds. I give this PPV 7 out of 10.",1454112000,5,4616,4.141425389755011
7498850,4,B017CGWJ7G,"1.) Intercontinental Championship Last Man Standing Match: Kevin Owens vs Dean Ambrose (c)

For the 3rd time in Royal Rumble history, a Last Man Standing Match would be taking place at this event. This was probably the most hyped match on the card that people were looking forward to---aside from the Rumble match. Ambrose and Owens tear into each other the moment the bell rings. Michael Cole's glasses even get broken after Ambrose sends Owens crashing over the announce table with a suicide dive. Minutes into the match, lots of weapons get brought out. Kendo sticks, chairs, and tables. This match practically had it all. We see Owens do his running cannonball into Ambrose against the barricade that breaks it down, a DDT on a steel chair, two table crash spots, and a final one that sees Owens pushed off the the turnbuckle through 2 tables at ringside. Owens is unable to answer the 10 count and Ambrose retains. This match was everything people expected it to be. It's very rare in this modern age of WWE that you can find 2 opponents that have tremendous chemistry with each other, but it's so clearly visible with Dean and Kevin. Amazing and violent opening bout and one of the best Last Man Standing matches in recent history

2.) WWE Tag Team Championship Match: The New Day (c) w/Xavier Woods vs The Usos

The New Day cut a promo on the way to the ring with Xavier debuting Francesca 2 after the first Francesca was shattered at the hands of Chris Jericho. It's truly amazing to see how over New Day is with the crowd now compared to this time last year when they were getting booed as the generic babyfaces. This was a good match and the first 2 on 2 Tag Team Championship match The Usos have gotten since their return. Solid match overall, but everyone knew the Usos weren't going to win. I don't know what it is about Jimmy and Jey but they're not as exciting as they used to be. I'm not sure what happened, but they've lost some of what they used to have. Big E catches one of the Usos mid-air after a failed crossbody and counters it into the Big Ending for the win

3.) United States Championship Match: Kalisto vs Alberto Del Rio (c)

Kalisto gets a rematch after Del Rio won back the championship that Kalisto beat him for 2 weeks ago. Decent, basic match. Not as good as the one they had on Raw. Kalisto gets the win with the Salida del Sol to become a 2x United States Champion. WWE should do themselves, Kalisto, and fans a favor and give him a longer title reign this time. He's earned it and he's quickly becoming over with the fans

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

4.) Diva's Championship Match: Becky Lynch vs Charlotte (c) w/Ric Flair

This was probably the best Diva's Championship match to happen ever since Charlotte won the Diva's Championship. Not only was this a feud about a broken friendship, but an underdog as well. The underdog story is a bit overplayed in this day and age, but Becky's been booked perfectly as one since this whole Diva's Revolution began. Becky starts off the match in control with a strong offense, never giving Charlotte a chance. Ric Flair, the dirty old crazy man, forcefully kisses Becky on the outside, living up to the ""kiss stealin' "" part of his nickname and putting the ball in Charlotte's court. Charlotte dominates the match for most of its duration. Just as Becky looks to have the match won with the Dis-arm-her, Ric provides the distraction, throwing his sports coat on Becky's head. Charlotte takes advantage with an eye poke and spear for the win. Charlotte lays a beat down on Becky after the match. Suddenly, Sasha Banks makes her return after a one month absence from TV to a thunderous ovation from the crowd. Not even AJ Lee got those kinds of reactions. Sasha confronts Charlotte in the ring and the 2 look as if they're going to reform their NXT alliance with each other. It proves to be a trick as Sasha attacks Charlotte and gets her in the Bank Statement before raising up the championship. The match itself was really good but the post-match segment is the talking point. The Diva's Championship picture--all NXT girls I may add is about to heat up. It looks like we'll be getting Sasha vs Charlotte at Fast Lane and/or a 3 way between Charlotte, Sasha, and Becky for the title at Mania. No, not that kind of 3 way you sick freak!

5.) 2016 Royal Rumble Match

There were 5 favorites going into the Rumble match this year: Roman Reigns, Triple H, Brock Lesnar, Bray Wyatt, and Chris Jericho. Of those 5, Reigns, HHH, and Lesnar were the only 3 that really seemed to have any true chance of walking out with the championship. It was an interesting Rumble to say the least. It was the first time the WWE Championship was being defended in the Royal Rumble match and the second time it was up for grabs, the last time being at the 1992 Royal Rumble. The first 2 in the match were the final 2 from the 2015 Rumble, Roman Reigns and Rusev. Entering at #3 is AJ Styles making his WWE debut to the second loudest ovation of the night (the first going to Sasha). Reigns looked baffled and Styles goes right after him. Reigns gets taken out by the League of Nations at Vince McMahon's request, putting him out of the match for pretty much most of its duration. The Rumble match this year was pretty good for the most part. Certainly better than previous years'. AJ Styles hung around for a good little while, crossing paths with the likes of Jericho, Kevin Owens, Kane, and Reigns. Sami Zayn makes a surprise entrance at #20 and gets an elimination in on Owens. Bray Wyatt looked to possibly have the match won before he even entered as the Wyatts cleared most of the ring....until they were all eliminated by Lesnar--Lesnar in turn being eliminated by the Wyatts. Reigns returns in the latter of the match and comes face to face with Triple H *surprise surprise* making his return at #30. HHH manages to toss Reigns over with the final 2 being him and Ambrose. HHH eliminates Ambrose to win his second Royal Rumble and 14th World Heavyweight Championship. This wasn't the greatest Royal Rumble match, but compared to the last 3 or 4 we had, it was plausible. Jericho had an amazing performance, as he competed the longest in the Rumble this year, 10 minutes short of an hour in 50:50

Overall: The 2016 Royal Rumble was surprisingly well laid out. The only match that really didn't bring much to the table was the US Championship Match. Ambrose and Owens stole the show with their brutal, opening Last Man Standing bout; we have a new US Champion, Sasha Banks is officially entering the Diva's Championship picture, A Styles made his highly anticipated debut, and Triple H is once again World Champion. Sasha Banks and AJ Styles undoubtedly got the biggest cheers of the night from the Orlando crowd. It's also interesting to note that this was the first time since the 2010 Royal Rumble in which WWE had no legend surprise entrants. Perhaps they were confident in their booking of the match this year that they felt they didn't need legends? I mean, AJ Styles was pretty much the focal point of the match. Overall, the 2016 Royal Rumble was a vast improvement from previous years and it's for sure got a lot of questions going into Wrestlemania 32 this year",1453680000,5,7677,4.895384615384615
