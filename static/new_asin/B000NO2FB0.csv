Combining the mundane realism of home and office with sumptuously rendered landscapes of postindustrial ruin, ""The Cracked Man"" traces the journey of a 40-year-old family man and corporate drone from middle-class comfort to exile to an eventual (though disturbing) redemption in a community of freakish outcasts perched on the edge of the world.",1172620800,,466,5.577464788732394
