5714707,5,B00CCC3PTM,"What a treat to witness such inspiring ""girl power"" exuding from female comedians who shared their experiences and perspectives about the industry!  I got a little teary-eyed near the end acknowledging the huge contributions female comics have made collectively in their endeavors to hone their uniquely presented crafts within this diverse genre and to make a difference!  I enjoyed this very enlightening and witty documentary immensely when it aired in 2013 and was compelled to watch an encore presentation on Showtime recently after learning of Joan Rivers' passing!",1413331200,,571,5.4772727272727275
5714708,4,B00CCC3PTM,"Gave this to my assistant, who aspires to be on the comedic stage. This is a primer for any female with dreams and a drive to make people laugh.",1413072000,,144,4.0
5714709,4,B00CCC3PTM,A lot of varied opinions from a diverse group of comedians.  They pretty much covered the whole gamut.,1412294400,,102,4.666666666666667
5714710,4,B00CCC3PTM,It is a great video for those who want a laugh and learn history behind female comedics as they are laughing. It was amazing except for it's missing ONE of the main female comedians right now and I was disappointed about. Ellen degeneres should have been one of the main to talk.,1406678400,,279,4.384615384615385
5714711,1,B00CCC3PTM,"I received this item, which appeared to be authentic and properly labeled.  However, when I inserted disc, I received a message that the disc was blank and upon further inspection, I was able to verify that the disc was indeed void of digital media! I contacted the distributor Lionsgate for assistance, but they ""passed the buck"" to the seller.  The seller never responded, so I'm left to deal with Amazon, which is a protracted undertaking.  Why wouldn't Lionsgate simply authorize a digital download of this media I've paid to receive, in the name of efficiency and speed?",1393027200,,575,4.907216494845361
5714712,5,B00CCC3PTM,This is a great watch for those like me who love female comics...but also for those who don't! If you don't come away with a greater like for the profession...I bet you come away with a greater respect. The best line to me was in regard to what brings about a great sense of humor... I've got to add it to my collection!,1389484800,,320,4.095238095238095
5714713,5,B00CCC3PTM,"Great interviews with fantastic comedians and goes through the gamut of why these ladies went into comedy, how hard but rewarding the path is, and dips into the ""Are Women Funny?"" controversy. I'd say this would be a great watch for anyone who is either a fan of comedy or who wants to pursue comedy as a career. This was educational and also entertaining - the women are very open and honest - and of course, funny!",1386633600,2,416,4.415584415584416
5714714,4,B00CCC3PTM,"I love the comedy genre and these ladies gave real insight into what it takes to survive as a female comic artist.  I have watched some of these ladies for years and am never disappointed with their style of comedy.  There is not a lot of foul language, just funny stories and good laughs.  The only reason I gave this Video 4 stars was because when I rented it, I thought I would get to see more of their performances, not just commentary.

Maybe they will get together and show case more of each of their talents.  A pretty good review of their left struggles though.",1386115200,,569,4.330188679245283

8580215,5,B00CCC3PTM,"Beautiful insight from our fore mothers of comedy. I am just starting out, and having access to such open and honest advice from true road warriors who fought for their voice to be heard is priceless. I'm lucky that my local scene is quite evolved as far as gender is concerned, and I have no doubt its largely due to these women. RIP Joan, thanks for the laughs.",1463875200,,363,4.352941176470588

8580217,5,B00CCC3PTM,"This is a fabulous documentary about the joys and challenges of female comedians and comedy writers. Many familiar faces and wonderful insight. Have watched it several times! BTW, I don't understand these reviewers who gave it a low rating because ""it wasn't funny"".  It's not a comedy showcase....thank goodness.",1452384000,,313,5.387755102040816

8580221,5,B00CCC3PTM,"This is a really great movie about funny women.  Joan Rivers is terrific. She was extremely talented and under appreciated. If you enjoy ladies in comedy, this is worth seeing.",1446940800,,176,4.866666666666666
