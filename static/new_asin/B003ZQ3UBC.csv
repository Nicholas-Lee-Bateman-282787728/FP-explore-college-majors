8410706,5,B003ZQ3UBC,"After being lovers, the fate seems again to set in motion for a new reencounter, although in this opportunity, the chances are not so good. He is in prison due a passion crime. And she once she has realized he is convict goes to visit in order to make his life much more comfortable into that hellish ambiance.

He is a disturbed man with suicide tendencies and she is is an obsessive woman, tired and bored of his trivial husband. Both attitudes conform a dramatis personae that will ignite the screen sooner or later.

Minimal dialogue love story that gradually will be involving the viewer until an unexpected finale.

Mature and claustrophobic film that will shock you. No doubt about it.!

One of my one hundred cult movies of this decade.",1299196800,,744,4.656488549618321
8410707,4,B003ZQ3UBC,"A rather phantasmagoric movie of a wife taking revenge over husband's deception by being deeply involved with a convinced murderer during his last days, while personalizing his wife murdered.

Strange, rather a philosophically-allegoric work, in which a totally silent role of a prisoner played by an actor from ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Happy-Together/dp/B001O2UTRC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Happy Together</a>"" has logically been contributed with in-jail same gender affair motive.

A mix of socio-political fiction, sexuality and moral is well presented.",1290816000,,603,7.135135135135135
