8449129,5,B004Z0T0G6,"Do Dooni Chaar, which translates as ""Two Twice Equals Four, follows an underpaid, under-appreciated school teacher struggling with family squabbles as he putt-putts to work every day on a broken down scooter.

His lame but lovable efforts to impress relatives, deal with his adolescent children and later scrape together enough money for a small car (even buying boxes of detergent and, using the law of averages, get a winning prize ticket inside one of the boxes) are amusing and just far out enough to be funny but not so outlandish to be ridiculous.

The film is pretty stark and unsentimental, yet it ends on a very sweet, believable note. Along the way, there are some songs. Music and songs are a staple of Bollywood films, but rather than songs stopping the action and the cast singing and breaking character, the songs are heard on the soundtrack much as they are in American films and TV shows.",1314230400,,904,4.788461538461538
