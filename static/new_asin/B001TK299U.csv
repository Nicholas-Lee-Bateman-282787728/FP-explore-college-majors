3790891,4,B001TK299U,I liked this movie.  Florence Henderson was-as always- great.  Parts of it were really corny and probably not very realistic but an enjoyable entertaining movie.  Like it enough to watch it twice.,1360713600,4,196,5.0625
3790892,5,B001TK299U,"This was a very cool surprise. My friend suggested we watch it. I thought I was going to see a movie with an emphasis on religion. But I was immediately caught up in the story. To coin a cliche' ""I laughed, I cried, I loved it!""

Written by the very talented Ann Marcus ""For Heaven's Sake"" is a story about a Grandmother who makes a promise to be at her granddaughter's birthday party. At a moment when the grandmother discovers that her deceased husband may have had an extra-marital affair, she has a heart attack and dies. She finds herself in heaven. But it is nothing like she would have imagined. It is a bureaucratic monolith, hugely unorganized. She finds out that her husband, who is also there, may be seeing the woman he may have had an affair with, but she can't just catch up with him yet. Instead, she insists on being able to go back to keep her promise to be at her granddaughter's birthday. The bureaucrats in heaven try to accommodate her. Meanwhile, she is able to use their computers to go back in time and relive moments of her past with her husband.

Marcus craftily weaves the serious with the comedy. It is a high wire act in screenwriting and Marcus pulls it off fantastically. This is the same Ann Marcus who won an Emmy Award for the cult TV classic, Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman.

Director, Nat Christian handles the clever material with a sophisticated hand of a very accomplished filmmaker. He skillfully unfolds the story, also weaving the story lines together so that the laughs do not get in the way of the very touching moments that grab your heart.

Florence Henderson stars as the grandmother, and I have never seen Ms. Henderson better. She is both real as an actress and plays the comedy in a real way, which works famously.

Allison Lange plays a ""younger"" Florence with great skill. Lange is a very talented actress who has an amazing screen presence.

Handsome David Paetkau brings truth to his role as Lange's husband.

Yaani King is adorable and quite good as an aide in heaven.

Kathryn Gordon is excellent as Florence's daughter.

Cameos by Joseph Campanella and Newell Alexander remind us of what treasures we have in Hollywood with such wonderful talents as these two actors.

A knockout performance is given by young Stephanie Patton.

Editing by Jeff Gove is fluid. Music by James Barth is just right for the moods. Camera by Michael Hardwick and Production Design by Dolores Piazza contribute nicely to the look.

Marcus has done a marvelous job of writing a very clever take on heaven. And Christian craftily delivers this vision for a most enjoyable time.",1237680000,4,2605,4.663755458515284

3790898,1,B001TK299U,Very unBiblical. People do not die and go directly to Heaven or hell. The Scriptures say they sleep. I did not watch it all because it was so incorrect. Its not even close to what the Bible teaches.,1446076800,,198,4.2368421052631575

3790903,1,B001TK299U,Terrible film under Christian movies. Total misrepresentation of heaven.,1440979200,,72,7.111111111111111
3790904,3,B001TK299U,A little bit confusing if any portion were missed. I do not feel as if it portrayed the accuracy of Heaven as believers know it through the teachings of the Bible.,1439769600,,163,4.290322580645161

3790908,1,B001TK299U,"I wish it could be lower or maybe 0.  This is not a Christian movie.

I had to stop watching after Florence Henderson's character, which had already stated she was somewhere between an agnostic and an atheist when it came to God, dies and goes to heaven.  There the guy checking her is tells her this is a more accepting heaven that takes both believers and non-believers.  I must have missed that one in the bible.

What is just as disturbing the scene before Florence Henderson's character is on a roller coaster ride with two other people supposedly going to heaven.  The roller coaster then takes a down turn and goes down into the flames of hell where one of the other two passengers gets dropped off in hell.  Florence Henderson and the other lady continue on to heaven.  According to this movie, if Florence Henderson and her rebellion against God makes it into heaven then just what did the guy on the roller coaster do to warrant being dropped off in hell?  According to the bible, Florence Henderson should have been in hell with the guy on the roller coaster.

Like I said, there is nothing Christian about this movie.",1435104000,3,1129,4.5721393034825875

3790926,1,B001TK299U,"Thinking that this was a christian related movie I purchased it, I on the same day I recieved it could not stomach more than 30-45 minutes of the film. I dumped this piece of garbage due to several factors. 1.) Florence Henderson's character professes to be agnostic or aethist, and 2.) when greeted by an individual who states he an processor send those whom have been accepted in to heaven to an orientation classes. Then further states everyone is accepted believer, non-believers and so on. 3.)The lanugauge. 4.) the entire tone reeks of a movie made to undermine true christian beliefs.",1401840000,22,591,4.861386138613861

3790928,1,B001TK299U,Poorly written and worse acted. Henderson was Ok but she could have  done better. The movie only makes sense if you've had a martini or two.,1400284800,,140,4.384615384615385

3790931,3,B001TK299U,"This movie had such potential, and I wanted to rate it higher, but several aspects made that impossible for me to do. It was listed as a Christian movie, and  I expected to watch this with my 11 year old granddaughter but when I previewed it, it included scenes of Katie's ""Nanny"" in bed with her future husband before marriage. Not acceptable or necessary for the plot, and not what I expected from the ad. Also, the explaination of ""heaven"" was just too comical and silly. If handled more tastefully, this movie could have been priceless because many of the sentiments and wisdom given during parts of the movie, plus the relationship between both Nanny and Katie, and the younger version of Sara and her husband were very touching. I will still watch it, but could have been so much more sensitive and meaningful.",1395792000,6,816,4.666666666666667

3790933,2,B001TK299U,It was ok but not what I was expecting. Very slow pace and it jumped around. It had great appeal on the cover but fell short,1393718400,3,124,3.8076923076923075
3790934,5,B001TK299U,Great movie for all who are grandparents.  My granddaughter are very close like the characters in the movie so this really got me thinking of how my granddaughter would handle my passing.  The sadness is equaled out with humor.

3790936,1,B001TK299U,Definitely not for children and too absurd for adults.  I am not sure what the point of the movie was.  I was not able to finish watching it.  Not for those who respect the Lord.,1385337600,9,178,4.0285714285714285

3790941,1,B001TK299U,This movie was terrible.  It was so stupid.  The writers are not Christians and have NO IDEA or Knowledge of Heaven.

The flashbacks to WWII era were interesting and the costuming fun, but as this film is evidently aimed at a children's audience, I do not think the portrayal of pre-marital intimacy was appropriate.
