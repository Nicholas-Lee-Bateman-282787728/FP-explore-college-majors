A lot of people said the second one was so bad because it was unbelievable, what was the first one a documentary on the public transportation system?  Please, they were both fun and give it up to Sandra Bullock, she didn't like the script for Speed 2 but said the director gave her her start so she owed him, that's professionalism and loyalty, and that's why we love her.",1369872000,,529,4.217821782178218
7947436,5,B00005NKTC,"I thoroughly enjoyed the plots of both of these films. Speed and Speed 2 are two of the best action thrillers ever made!
Speed was a five star film with lots of action and great acting from Sandra Bullock, Keanu Reeves and Dennis Hopper.
Speed 2 starred Jason Patric, Willem Dafoe and Sandra Bullock reprising her character from the first film.
However, these films both stand out on their own.
The first takes place primarily on a bus...and the second on a cruise ship.
The villian in the second film is portrayed by Willem Dafoe and his performance was as good as Dennis Hopper's performance in the first film!
Both of these movies provide tongue-in-cheek action and loads of edge-of-your-seat suspense!
These movies have a permanent place in my collection and have major rewatchability!
Don't discount Speed 2...it's just a similar story in a different atmosphere.
The tense moments are still present...as well as the escapist action that we all expect!
Both films were exceptional and very well done.
It is hard to improve upon Speed because it was excellent...but Speed 2 has as much to offer as the first!
Highly Recommended!",1267056000,,1131,4.895833333333333

7947438,5,B00005NKTC,"Speed is my favorite Sandra Bullock movie. She is just...phenominal in it. And Keanu Reeves...what a hunk!!
The way they put this film together was great: the stunts, the action, the suspense and thrill of it all! Jan DeBont needs to get back together with Sandra to do another action movie. That would be cool!! I CANNOT think of another movie that is better that Speed! It's definitely #1 on my list.",1067558400,,402,4.597222222222222
7947439,4,B00005NKTC,"Let's face it, Speed(5 stars) is a wonderful Action movie, problably the best Action movie of the year, but Speed 2(3 stars) doesn't live up to the original as well as I thought it would. The movie would be so much better if Keanu Reeves reprised his role as Jack Traven. Dennis Hopper was a great villian in the original.",1039824000,,322,4.383333333333334
7947440,4,B00005NKTC,"Ok, let me guess ... You saw Speed and thought it was a great movie? Or at least you heard it was  great movie. Well, it is - bet ya! And now you heard people talking - Speed 2 is a terrible movie, the winner of the golden raspberry (the worst movie of the year). So, why buy it, especially when it is a set?
Ok, let me set it straight. Speed 2 isn't a bad movie - it just isn't as good as Speed 1. The story of Speed 2 is dumb (as in every other action movie - take Eraser, or M:I-2), but it makes a nice background for the action and nobody ever goes to see an action-flick for the story. And if we are honest than even Speed 1 didn't have that much of a great story - it isn't so much better than the stroy of the second movie.
What counts is action, and you get plenty of it here. It's the same class of action as in Speed, with a different playground. You get even the cute Sandra Bullock and a cute Jason Patrick (instead of Keanu Reeves). In addition you get a little bit of romance, 'cause the character of Jason Patrick wants to marry the character of Sandra Bullock ...
Ok, so, are missing anything for an action movie? I am not! Just 'cause Speed was such a surprise and a overaverage action-flick, was everybody expecting the same from Speed 2 ... And it was impossible to fulfill, or at least it didn't work out. So in this packet, we have a great action movies on DVD (Speed = 5 stars) and an average action movie (Speed 2 = 4 stars). And 'cause it's just the two normal DVDs you can buy separately in one box, the rating is 4 stars! Buy it, if you love Sandra Bullock/Jason Patrick and if you love good action!!!",1003622400,13,1627,4.037151702786378
