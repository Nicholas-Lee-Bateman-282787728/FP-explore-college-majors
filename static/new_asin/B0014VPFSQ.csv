3135202,5,B0014VPFSQ,"2 very good movies. One great movie. Firefox and The Rookie are very good movies,but The Gauntlet is great. Yea they are old movies,the newest being The Rookie,which also stars Charlie Sheen,in the beginning of his career,it is a typical season cop mentors rookie cop,but when you add Clint Eastwood into it,it shines. As with Firefox,which would of bomb with anybody else but Clint doing it. And then you have The Gauntlet with Sondra Locke as a targeted hooker,and of course Clint comes to save the day,Clint Eastwood is a great actor,but a even better director,and he makes this movie great as both. If you love Clint Eastwood,as I do,then these titles belong in your collection,but if your just a casual fan,I think you will find these movies to be good,and just make you start to appreciate him better..",1346803200,,808,4.820143884892087
3135203,5,B0014VPFSQ,"I bought this 3-in-one DVD from a private party.  Although each movie and dialogue is older than today's Clint Eastwood movies, the action is great in all three! I consider all three my favorite Eastwood movies!

3135204,4,B0014VPFSQ,Clint Eastwood is one of the best actors in the business.  As far as I am concerned he was in only one movie that was no good and the was The Bridges of Madison County.,1264291200,,168,3.8
3135205,5,B0014VPFSQ,Two of the movies are average except for Firefox which follow the outline of the book very well. I recommend reading the book FIREFOX for additional information. After reading FIREFOX also read the second book FIREFOX DOWN.,1258329600,3,223,5.054054054054054
3135206,5,B0014VPFSQ,I loved the movies - and what can you say about a DVD? Works fine. The only shortcoming in my opinion is that to lower the price and save money they crammed two movies onto one double-sided DVD. That adds difficulty when handling. No more complaints - just sheer fun.,1237248000,,267,4.36
