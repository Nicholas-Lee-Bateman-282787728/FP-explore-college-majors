7812686,5,6301574613,"Fright Night - Shemp's first Columbia Three Stooges 2-reeler and it's a great one. Shemp had no trouble reasserting himself back into the act & I'm sure he had a treat filming this one since it dealt with his favorite sport of boxing. Shemp's antics in the boxing ring are hysterical and who could forget the ""little brother this high"" gag during the chase scene.
4 1/2 stars

Hold That Lion - Another great one & maybe an unintentional anniversary short since this was 2-reeler #100 and as I'm sure every stooge fan knows, Curly Howard makes a cameo on the train as a snoring passenger. Dudley Dickerson has a great part as a porter who's scared to death by the lion on the train (help, help, I'm losing my mind). 5 stars

Who Done It? - What can you say about this one? One of the all-time greats and in my top 5 of Shemp films. Every stooge is on top of his game here and Shemp & Christine McIntyre make a fabulous duo. Their onscreen chemistry is amazing. The detective themed episodes with Shemp were almost always classics and this is the best. Highlights include Shemp's camera that gets distracted by Christine's finer assets (the niece is nice), Larry's smile at the camera, the poisoning scene, the chase from the goon and of course the ""light to dark"" fight sequence at the end. This short is stooge heaven. 5 stars

Definitely the best Shemp Howard tape you can come by.",1358035200,,1382,4.476190476190476
7812687,5,6301574613,"FRIGHT NIGHT (1947) - A great short. It involves Shemp as a boxer. Before he was a stooge, he actually was a boxer! The warehouse chase scene at the end was simply hilarious.
HOLD THAT LION! (1947) - A stooge classic. The whole thing is laugh-out-loud hilarious! This particular short is also special. It has a cameo appearance by Curly....WITH HAIR!
WHO DONE IT? (1949) - This short is a true stooge gem. The scene where Shemp gets wacked-out from poison is fall-out-of-your-chair funny! As well as the end, when Shemp says his last lines.
FRIGHT NIGHT, HOLD THAT LION!, WHO DONE IT?: All stooge gems. This would have to be one of the best stooge tapes to own!",1014422400,5,661,4.563025210084033
7812688,5,6301574613,"A great tape, with some excellent, fast-paced shorts.
FRIGHT NIGHT is Shemp's first Stooge short, and a very funny one at that. The chase through the warehouse is hilarious. Shemp's boxing scenes are excellent. This is actually Shemp's favorite Three Stooges short because it involved boxing, a sport he admired a lot.
HOLD THAT LION is a hilarious short, with Kenneth MacDonald at his best, as I. Slipp. There is also a cameo by Curly in this short, with a full head of hair. The Stooges pull up a hat off of his face and see Curly. He barks like a dog a does his famous ""woo woo woo"".
WHO DONE IT? is another great short. The Stooges are all very funny here, and this short has a great supporting cast. According to the back of the box, this short was planned by Edward Bernds as a Curly short. Shemp does the Curly shuffle in his own wonderful style. A great short, even if it does hardly have a plot.
A great tape needed to make a Stooge collection complete.",1012348800,5,962,4.35
7812689,4,6301574613,"FRIGHT NIGHT (1947) - This was Shemp's debut short with the Stooges, and he fit right back in perfectly. Since he already had experience with the Stooges in their vaudeville days, he was familiar with the act, and was an original Stooge. This short is one of Shemp's best (and his personal favorite short, since it dealt with his favorite sport - boxing), and features some of his best work, like the scenes with him in the boxing ring. This also has a hilarious chase/fight sequence at the end.
HOLD THAT LION! (1947) - A pretty good short and features Kenneth MacDonald in his best role, but what really makes this special is a cameo from Curly.  This was filmed after he retired due to his second stroke, which partially paralyzed him, and he has a small role as a snoring passenger. He's almost unrecognizable with a headfull of hair, and a loss of weight (he almost resembled Joe Penner), but once you hear that familiar snore of his, you know who it is! A brief but great cameo role for Curly, and the only time we see brothers Moe, Shemp, and Curly in the same scene.  This is also the boys' 100th short.  I wonder if this being their 100th short has anything to do with Curly's special cameo (a possible celebration?), or was it just coincidence?
WHO DONE IT (1949) - One of the best shorts ever made. Everything here was EXCELLENT! The writing and direction (excellent double duty job from Edward Bernds), the great supporting cast, and each of the Stooges are at their best here, especially Larry with his zany, subtle facial expressions. This had many hilarious, fast-paced scenes and lines, and one of the funniest endings. My favorite Shemp short.",994377600,2,1660,4.620338983050847
7812690,5,6301574613,"In ""Hold That Lion"", watch for a scene where the three are on a train -- the guy that they wake up is Jerome Howard (aka Curly) in his only post-stroke appearance",960163200,3,162,4.09375
7812691,5,6301574613,"As a huge Stooges fan in general and a Shemp Howard fan in particular, I can safely say that this video encompasses the zenith of Shemp's career!  Three shorts, all laugh out loud funny.
For starters, there is  ""Fright Night"", which is Shemp's debut with the Stooges in short  features.  Imagine, if you will, the Stooges as trainers of a boxer (one,  Chopper Kane).  The boys have the misfortune of betting their life savings  on their protege, only to be threatened by the local mob boss to have  Chopper throw the fight!  It goes without saying that hilarity ensues once  the Stooges formulate a plan.  The short contains numerous hysterical bits,  especially the fight scene at the end in the warehouse, which is sheer  brilliance.  Speeding up the camera and the sounds it elicits was never  used to better effect.
Next is ""Hold That Lion"", which is  notable for at least two reasons.  First, Curly Howard has a cameo.  Second, one of the greatest characters ever created, Ickabod Slipp (played  by Kenneth MacDonald), is prevalent throughout.
The boys inherit money  from their uncle, but the unscrupulous Slipp intends to cheat them out of  their fortune.  Seeking to supoena the elusive Slipp, they follow him onto  a train and then all hell breaks loose!
The antics are simply masterful,  starting with Shemp and Larry's, ""we're gonna get the filthy lucre/the  moolah/the geedous (sic?)/No slippery guy named Slipp/Is ever gonna cheat  us ..."" singing routine.  Add to this the train scenes and finish it  off with Shemp's insistance on getting the bonds (""that's what I want  'em right now this minute [tick,tick!]).  The flood of youthful memories is  overwhelming ...
The best is saved for last with ""Who Done  It?"".  This might very well contain the most laughs per minute of any  Stooge short.  Every scene is a laugh riot.  The boys are detectives,  investigating the disappearence of old man Goodrich.  Turns out to be an  inside job (aren't they all?) with the butler (natch), his neice and  others, including Nico aka ""the Goon"", joining in.
Too many  scenes to mention, but the standouts are the initial investigation/photo  scene, the chase through the house and the climax, the fight in the dark.  Shemp, wielding his ""trusty little shovel"", lays waste to  anything that moves (unfortunately, this includes his buddies, Moe and  Larry!)
Larry Fine, in particular, shines in this short.  His faces,  reactions, slapstick, delivery, you name it, are all superb.  Larry is on  his game.  Moe and Shemp are great, as always, as are supporting players  Christine MacIntyre and Emil Sitka.  Quite possibly the greatest short the  Stooges ever made (and my personal favorite).
One final note.  These  shorts all contain clever plots, great gags and wonderful performances.  Fifty-odd years later, they still stand the test of time.  Run, don't walk,  to get your copy!",919728000,9,2882,4.959915611814346
