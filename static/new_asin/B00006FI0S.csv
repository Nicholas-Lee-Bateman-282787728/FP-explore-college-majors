1746522,5,B00006FI0S,"Next year the friday the 13th franchise will turn 22. For series of films that is universally panned by critics, they proved quite profitable. we the fans love this stuff, low brow or high art. We all have varying tastes. I dig the angle New Line cinema has thrown at the franchise in order to keep Jason a viable commodity. Jason X looks fresh, fun and boasts the highest bodycount so far. The film pokes fun at the conventions of the horror genre. Jason X was shot digitally so it will look great on DVD. Slasher films, horror films are our modern twist on tall tales and mythology. Plus gallons of blood being spilled in zero gravity is probably pretty cool too. The only problem is where do we go with jason fom here? Well,it's a double edged machete. Now that Jason has been brought to outer space, following installments will have to stay within some sci-fi continuity. In other words: give us what we really want...Jason versus aliens,cyborgs and Freddy Krueger.........  Justice X",1007164800,2,988,4.67816091954023
1746523,5,B00006FI0S,I own Friday the 13th 1-9! I'm looking foward to this one!,1006387200,,58,3.9166666666666665
1746524,4,B00006FI0S,"this movie is awsome have to trust me i saw the demo version in England is good this film is totally difrent from the other jason movies is about the future but a scary future,well actually if you like ALIENS the James Cameron film u would like this jason x. or infact if you play ALIENS V.S.TERMINATOR THE VIDEO GAME and love it u will like JASON X  is that theres jason first starts as the killer but on half of movie JASON IS THE HERO YEAH HE STARTS KILLING THESE WEIRD ALIENS FROM THIS PLANET CALLED HELLFLOWED.ITS BETER IF THEY CALLED IT JASON v.s.

1746525,3,B00006FI0S,"I like some other lucky fans have seen advanced screenings of this film, unfortunatly any horror movie that takes place in space is absurd, exceptions being Alien and such. It seems horror has taken a tech-spin, (the new Halloween revolves around the internet,) The Film is good Jason kills people like its going out of style, which is good for gore fans, however I much prefer killers in the woods, in the basement or lurking the streets where I feel they are most scary!",1002067200,5,472,4.630952380952381
1746526,5,B00006FI0S,"It has been a while since Jason was last seen being dragged into hell by Freddy Kruger, an ending I frankly didn't like to ""Jason goes to Hell."" I've always been a Jason fan and I think his movies should stand alone,he doesn't need any help slicing and dicing his way across the screen. I'm glad they didn't go with the Jason vs Freddy angle here. And I have a message to all the critics who I'm sure are readying their pens to dump all over this latest installment, DONT BOTHER! We know the acting will probably be horrible and the story line won't be poignant and meaningful and it DOESN'T MATTER! If it's Oscar calibur performances you want, go see ""Captain Corelli's Mandolin"" (somebody has to.) Leave us and our slasher film alone, it doesn't need to make sense or even tie into part 9. All we need is 1) Jason and his Hockey Mask (wouldn't be right without it) and 2) Nudity and Blood (wouldn't be right without those either) and that's it. I've been a fan of Jason's since 1982 and I plan to be here til the bloody end (pun intended.) I'm looking forward to this movie and wish they would have released it this year, around October would have been good. In closing let me just say load up the Spacestation Fodder, Jason's back and it's about time!",999216000,6,1254,4.386266094420601
1746527,5,B00006FI0S,"Just saw Jason X in the unrated version in a world premiere in Cologne, Germany...and it`s awesome. This is the best part of the Friday the 13th series, believe me! The best thing is, how Jason looks this time, his costume( after he mutated) is very cool. The gore factor is very high, Jason kills as many people as never before( hopefully you`ll see the uncut version of this movie!!!). The film is indeed impressive in its use of special effects. In one scene, you even get to see a virtual reality, reproducing the old Camp Chrystal Lake.  So, wait for Jason X...you won`t regret it!!!",997228800,20,588,4.547169811320755
1746528,5,B00006FI0S,"I have to admit I was the first to say: ""Aww man, here's another Leprechaun 4 or Hellraiser Bloodline"", but I was completely blown away that this movie was really good. Even without the biggest effects placed (I saw a preview in which most FX hadn't been done yet) this movie still rocked. The best thinkg is that even though it's in space it still maintains the ""Friday the 13th"" feeling of 1-4 and 6 while giving it a new spin and even makes fun of itself at some points. The cameo by David Cronenberg is pretty cool too. I think the best thing about this movie is that it doesn't mention a thing about what happened in ""Jason Goes To Hell""  which completely destroyed the franchise. It also gives space for future sequels in modern time too, I just hope that if they do make other sequels they are as refreshing as this one.",996451200,10,827,4.335483870967742
1746529,5,B00006FI0S,"I haven't even seen this movie and I already know it's going to kick something. As for that guy who said Jason 7-9 sucked. I agree in part 8 the guy got his throat slashed with a machete and no blood came out,but Friday the 13th Jason Goes To Hell I totally disagree that was a great movie, but if you didn't like the rrated version try unrated. The only thing that sucks about that is it is not on dvd.",993513600,2,403,3.9876543209876543
1746530,5,B00006FI0S,NOW WHAT? JASON 10 IS IT ENOUGH? WELL I LOVED ALL THE FRIDAY THE 13TH MOVIES 1 THROUGH 6. NUMBERS 7 TO 9 WERE NOT GOOD. THEY SHOULD HAVE NEVER MADE THEM. JASON GOES TO HELL FRIDAY THE 13 THE FINAL FRIDAY REALLY BOMBED! I REALLY DID THINK IT WAS GOING TO BE THE FINAL FRIDAY. I THINK THE BEST PART WAS WHEN FREDDY PULLED JASON'S MASKED DOWN INTO HELL.

1746721,1,B00006FI0S,"If you're a fan of the ""Friday the 13th"" films and the horror genre in general""Jason X"" is not the movie for you, even if we overlooked that the plot is like an overcooked stew of the worst elements of early-00s movies.  No, the real problem is that there was virtually no creativity involved, creating a boring movie in which the action was boring, the deaths were boring, and even the ending was boring.

The one non-boring bit was merely slightly baffling  conjuring a couple of seemingly-underage campers who giggle, ""how about premarital sex? we looove premarital sex!"" at Jason in unison, strip to the waist and jump in their sleeping bags was just...weird. That a minute later Jason was somehow murdering them by swinging one camper-filled sleeping bag into the other wasn't a whole lot more logical.  Yes, the idea was to distract him to buy the good guys time, but in that case, it would've bought a lot more time if he'd had to actually chase the campers.  (Besides, it would've been much funnier to have Jason distracted by a gaggle of little kids pestering him to buy magazines so they could go to Disneyland on a class trip or something else annoying from IRL.)",1501200000,,1174,4.6521739130434785

1746724,5,B00006FI0S,"This movie was well written, and it is a fitting sequel to the Jason Legacy. But, this falls under the ""trope"" i guess you could call it, of the un-killable evil character. No matter how many people say ""Oh, but no one knew of this secret, the one that will surely end this nightmare!!!"" they always come back somehow. Just like Freddy, Michael Myers, Chucky, and countless others, they always come back. I miss slashers that had an end.

1746725,5,B00006FI0S,"Probably one of my favorites of the Friday the 13th movies. I don't think it being ""Jason in Space"" made it go too overboard.

The look he started out with in this movie I liked, it was an updated look, but was still true to the Hockey Mask look has has had since like Part 3.",1493251200,,365,3.945945945945946

This one, although different being set 2455, still mainly stayed a Jason movie while making fun of other horror movies that were out at the time,like Scream, I Know What you Did last Summer and even sci-fi films like Species.

1746919,1,B00006FI0S,"Easily the fifth or sixth time Friday the 13th has jumped the shark, this time pulling a double corkscrew backflip along the way. Following in the hallowed footsteps of Leprechaun 4, Hellraiser: Bloodline and Critters 4, this installment finds Jason cryogenically frozen for four hundred years and defrosted aboard a lightly-staffed spacecraft. No explanation is offered for his abrupt return from the depths of the nether, where he was unceremoniously dumped at the end of Jason Goes to Hell, though I'm not sure that really would've made a difference. This is a willfully stupid playground for half-baked science fiction ideas, terrible wardrobe choices and budget special effects; a cut-rate production that would feel right at home on the Sci-Fi Channel at 3am. Predictable to the end, it touches all the bases with gratuitous nudity, shallow characters, mysterious returns from certain doom and a truckload of dismemberments / decapitations / deaths. The only thing we're missing is the trademarked screeching cat fake-out, presumably because no self-respecting animal would be seen in such a production. Apart from one fleeting moment of self-deprecating parody near the end - which is totally out of place, but admittedly had me howling - there's no reason for this to exist. It's the kind of thing that would've thrived on the bootleg circuit, akin to Roger Corman's unreleased Fantastic Four, but by actually sending it to theaters, New Line took the wind out of those sails. The best thing I can say here is, hey, at least it's better than the last one.",1477872000,,1563,5.109375
1746920,2,B00006FI0S,"Terrible movie, totally unnecessary sequel, ridiculous plot.  I only have it to complete my ""Jason"" collection.  The ""Friday the 13th"" series is already not the best, but this one...",1477699200,,182,5.241379310344827

A group of college students consisting of Tsunaron, Janessa, and Azrael all being lead by  Professor Braithwaite Lowe and his Android robot, KM-14, are preparing to return to the remains of the old earth to study the rusting artifacts that caused the planet to become uninhabitable.

Upon visiting the Camp Crystal Lake facility, they discover 2 cryogenically frozen bodies. One belongs to the voluptuous hottie; Rowan LaFontaine and the other belonging to your boy and mine, Jason Voorhees who was captured and placed in a frozen stasis by the U.S Government in the year 2010.

1747161,5,B00006FI0S,"The Detailed Gist:  It opens with a really cool CGI fueled effects showing doctors doing an autopsy on Jason while you see inside of Jason, showing his blood stream, his nerves, they even did a CGI effect for the needle used to take his blood. The opening song is effectively earnest and tense.  It starts out in 2008 at the Crystal Lake Research Facility involving a beautiful scientist named Rowan, who is keeping Jason chained and hanging. Rowan is about to put Jason in frozen stasis after there have been countless failed attempts to execute him.  The plan was to keep him frozen until they can find a more effective way to execute him while he's frozen.  The plan gets interrupted when a greedy slimebag scientist named Dr. Wimmer( Played by Canadian film director, David Cronenberg) is intending to study Jason to get to the bottom of Jason's regenerative capabilities.  It isn't long before Jason breaks free and makes quick work of Dr. Wimmer and his soldiers.  Rowan grabs a shotgun from one of the soldiers after he lets her know that she'd better get out of there as quickly as possible.  Jason chases after Rowan until shee sees him enter the room that she's in that has a cryogenic machine, she stands up and shoots Jason back and then knocks a table his way and causes him to fall into the machine.  As Jason is starting to freeze, he sticks his machete through the door and stabs Rowan.  Due to a breach that that causes the place is puts on lockdown and both Jason and Rowan are frozen as a result.  Let's flash forward to the year 2455, some scientists and students are on a field trip.  As they skulk about they find both Jason and Rowan in frozen stasis.  They bring Jason and Rowan to their space ship the Apache.  It isn't long before two scientists are having sex and Jason wakes up and is ready for action, when he was believed to be dead. Rowan is also awakened.  There's plenty of sci-fi carnage to be experienced here.  Jason truly has some brand new killing grounds to work with this time.

Harry Manfredini returns yet again to do the musical score.  The director is Jim Isaac.  The producer is Noel Cunningham.

The concept proved incredibly brilliant and unique.  This is a must see for sc-fi fans, action fans, Jason fans, slasher fans(of course), and fans of comedy.  The special effects are awesome, the action is exciting, the imagination behind the worlds, the space armadas, and the technology is truly amazing.  Putting Jason in a new environment added a great new touch to the franchise.  The humor wasn't frequent, but it was effectively well written and added more entertainment to it all.

Harry Manfredini's score proved a true maturity above all is his long career.  I love how his score goes from atmospheric and blending well into the background, especially with it calm mood setting tones, to all out state of emergency, you better run for all you're worth, kind of sounds and tones.  His best score yet.

The script was remarkably well written for the most part, with a couple of awkward lines here and there.

The scientist women in this movie are all hot and gorgeous beyond compare.  Janessa, Adrienne, Rowan, and especially the robot woman Kay-Em 14.  She's unquestionably the hottest, most beautiful, and just plain coolest of them all. They ware some really hot outfits in this one.

The gore what you get of it is quite good.  The kill scenes are quite gripping.  My most favorite will always be Jason shoving one of the sexy scientist girls heads in liquid nitrogen to the point of freezing her face and then smashing and breaking her face on the counter.  That was truly brilliant.  But I also love the sleeping bag bashing scene reminiscent of part 7.

There's not much nudity, but what there is is definitely worth sticking around for.  The movie's quite solid all the same anyway.

The Star Trek Hollodeck like computer they use to play game simulation was one truly awesome element to be included in the movie.  It also proves cool later on when they use it to create a virtual Camp Crystal Lake used to fool Jason.  I love that part!

SPOILER ALERT:  Two big special surprises and changes come about and if you haven't seen this movie, then you might not wish to read this.  Just when you figure this movie's offered all that it can, it gives you more to enjoy.  The scene with beautiful and smokin' hot robot girl Kay-Em 14 is wearing this super sexy outfit and not only that, but, she kicks Jason's a** using big vicious guns and martial arts.  She eventually kills Jason, but of course only temporary.  More awesomeness is when in the aftermath, their machine that they use to revive people unintentionally revives Jason to the point of making him super tough, in fact way tougher than ever, and it even allows him a new metallic mask.  He then becomes UberJason.  Two truly awesome parts of the movie that allow the audience some new and special surprises.
END OF SPOILERS

Overall, if you're looking for a unique sci-fi/horror experience, if you like to look at attractive and decidedly sexy people, if you're into Jason and Friday the13th, but need something different, if you like super awesome special effects, if you like action, humor, sex appeal, in your horror movie, and if you want to see Jason in a whole new way well then this movie is definitely for you.  Anyway,what with this movie being made at a higher budget of $14,000,000 which surpasses Jason Takes Manhattan's $5,000,000 budget, making this the highest budget for the franchise at the time of this movie and also Kane Hodder being back in top form and back to basics in his performance from where he was in part 7 this one is furthermore a can't miss.",1444953600,4,5689,4.6343656343656345
1747162,5,B00006FI0S,"Weird.  Wacky.  Wonderful.  It's my favorite Jason film.  It totally ignores the series, allowing Jason to take a road trip in outer space.  Sure.  Why not.  Makes perfect sense, all things considering.  They had to do something with him while they were waiting for Freddy to show up.  Hey, it worked for Critters............sort of.

In the future the Earth goes to pot.  Jason is on ice, he's found by students on a field trip.  They take him onboard their spaceship along with a woman they find near Jason's ice pod.  They thaw them for plot sake.  And soon Jason is wandering around killing off the crew.  An android robot makes short shrift of poor misunderstood Jason.  They leave him a heap of body parts.

This is the best of that genre mix, IMHO. I'll watch this film before watching Terminator, Alien*, even Pitch Black (though not as good as Chronicles, IMHO)  Lots of interesting ways to be killed and to die with effects to back it up.  Some of the writing isn't great, but I can watch Lexa cooking rice and be happy. I don't know why.

Just finished watching with the director and writer commentary.  They talked about all the other drafts more than what actually happened in the movie.

1747312,4,B00006FI0S,"As others have pointed out, this isn't a horror movie.  It's an action comedy, with a futuristic setting.  For Jason fans it's quite enjoyable.

At some point, after his battle with Freddy, the FBI had captured Jason.  After several failed attempts at executing him, they'd finally decided to contain him in a cryo unit.  Unfortunately some pencil pushers didn't agree with that plan. They saw a creature that couldn't die, as research worth a fortune.  Their attempt at moving Jason set him free.

The facility's director, Rowan,lured Jason to the cryo unit.  The unit was in a tiny room, and had it's own power supply.  Once locked inside Jason breached the the unit's seal.  The cryo fluid leaked out, turning the entire room into a freeze chamber.  Putting both Jason and Rowan into stasis.  They'd sleep for about 450 years.

During those centuries the human race would be busy.  They achieve space flight, and find an Earth like planet - that they name Earth 2.  They also pollute the original Earth, to the point where it couldn't sustain human life.  So they'd abandon it, and relocate to Earth 2. They'd also created nanotechnology, cable of repairing injuries at the cellular level.

Jason and Rowan's story resumed, when they were discovered by archeology students, and taken aboard their space ship.  Their nanotechnology easily resuscitated Rowan. They believed Jason was dead beyond reviving.  Unfortunately their sensors couldn't tell the difference between dead and undead.

Once Jason thawed out he proceeded to slaughter anyone he found on the ship.  When most of the crew was dead, Rowan had to take charge of the survivors.  Their only hope was to abandon ship.  When that failed they were forced to wait for rescue.

They came close to stopping Jason, by modifying an android.  The Kay-Em unit wan't designed for combat, but she had inhuman reflexes and strength.  Once uploaded with battle skills and armed, she became a formidable weapon.  She used fully automatic weapons as surgical tools - amputating Jason's left leg and right arm.  Then used high caliber weapons to blow apart part of Jason's chest and his head.  It's unclear if Jason could have pulled himself together,  he didn't need to.

What nobody had considered was that Jason had collapsed onto a medical table, and the computers had been shot up.  The malfunctioning nanobots proceeded to repair Jason.  With insufficient tissue available, they fashioned cybernetic replacement parts from a bullet proof allow.  Prosthetics replaced his missing limbs and reinforced his chest.  The nanobots pieced his head back together, and garbed his remaining organic tissue in a bullet proof black bodysuit.  They also extrapolated his hockey mask's shape, and forged a close approximation out of the same allow as his prosthetics.  They even polished his machete.

Jason's crude mind couldn't have comprehended what had happened to him, and didn't need to. All Jason needed to know was ""He was more powerful than ever, and there were people to Kill"".  He slaughters several more, and has an dramatic battle with the ships finest soldier.

At the end Rowan, Kay-Em, and her creator are rescued.  The ship explodes and Jason falls out of orbit.  He lands in a lake on Earth 2.",1424736000,,3251,4.9888059701492535

1747449,4,B00006FI0S,"I like the Friday the 13th films because they typically involve a group of youths on vacation in a camp-like environment and the fun antics thereof; the presence of an unstoppable killer who becomes more of an infernal monster as the series progresses adds an air of suspense to the dramedy and adventure. Add loads of gorgeous females and various shooting locations around North America and you have a fabulously entertaining series that has yet to end. With the exception of the 2009 remake, none of these films really scare me, although they contain jump scares, of course; they're sometimes creepy, sometimes suspenseful, sometimes exciting and always fun & entertaining, but seldom truly scary. In fact, when the killer inevitably slays someone I usually bust out laughing.

2001's ""Jason X"" starts in the year 2010 where the government decides to finally stop Jason by putting him into frozen stasis. He and another person are revived in the year 2455 by a professor and his students who are on a field trip Earth Two to Earth One. Jason is unleashed on their spaceship and havoc ensues.

As you can see, this entry is like 1979's ""Alien"" except with Jason as the monster and a sense of humor. You'll also notice that it's a great departure for the series putting Jason in space in the future. Most Friday fans look down on 1993's ""Jason Goes to Hell"" and ""Jason X"" because the producers tried something new. It's obvious they felt the series had become stale and formulaic with an incredible eight installments from 1980-1989. I felt ""Jason Goes to Hell"" had a refreshing concept (ripped off from 1987's ""The Hidden"") and a great intro & opening act, but then it started to spiral out of control from there; still, it features a couple of the best women in the series (Agent Marcus and Deborah), which should be commended.

I heard negative comments about ""Jason X"" over the years and finally got around to viewing it in 2012. My impression is that the first half is sci-fi at its best. I was stunned at how well the filmmakers handled the sci-fi aspects of the plot and F/X. The second half becomes too cartoony for my tastes as Jason systematically annihilates most of the crew, particularly when he gets his new futuristic look (rolling my eyes).

This installment features an impressive assortment of women, but it's only Kinsa (Melody Johnson) that I find appealing, except for the cameo of the campfire teen #1 at the end, played by the stunning Mika Ward. Needless to say, the latter should have been in the main cast.

To be expected (in light of the spaceship plot), the film was shot mostly on sets in Toronto with some Ontario outside sequences.

The film runs 91 minutes.

1747593,3,B00006FI0S,"Infamous mass killer Jason Voorhees was apparently sent to hell at the conclusion of Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday (1993).  Although an adventure featuring Voorhees and Freddie Kruger had been discussed, the future of the Friday the 13th franchise remained in limbo for some years.  To keep the possible Freddie/Jason collaboration viable, writer Todd Farmer came up with a scenario to send Jason Voorhees far into the future.  Released 8 years after Jason Goes to Hell, and set in deep space, Jason X (2001), the tenth entry in the series, may not make much logical sense, but is still entertaining, as a quirky anomaly in the Friday franchise.

In the year 2010, Jason Voorhees (Kane Hodder) escapes captivity in a government facility, but is trapped in a cryo-chamber by scientist Rowan LaFontaine (Lexa Doig), who is also frozen.  In the year 2455, Professor Brandon Lowe (Jonathan Potts) and a group of his students, discover the frozen bodies, and bring them aboard their spacecraft, the Apache.  Both Rowan and Jason are successfully reanimated, and the masked killer soon resumes his homicidal ways.

The setting is vastly different, but the results are mostly the same, as Jason slashes his way through most of the crew, and elevates the violence to an epic scale, as he contributes to the destruction of a space station, as well as the Apache.  Voorhees is eventually pitted against KM14 (Lisa Ryder), an android that has been modified for combat.

Borrowing elements from the Alien and Terminator franchises, there is much about Jason X that seems familiar.  Providing a radical change of scenery that not all fans will appreciate, Jason X has a kind of a polarizing effect, as Jason Voorhees enters a whole new universe.

1747648,1,B00006FI0S,"Oh me oh my... The Jason series hit rock bottom and started digging. Right off the bat this barely feels like a Jason movie. Even in Friday 8 when it is not in Crystal Lake anymore it *felt* like a Jason movie, albeit with some horrible writing. This Friday looks like it was made using worse special effects than from the 90's Star Trek show. It's insulting to the eyeballs.

Then there's the sad excuse of a story set up. Jason is in captivity, presumably after his victory over Freddy Kruger, and is incapable of being executed to death. I could have sworn the FBI blew him up in the last movie. Anyhoo, he wreaks havoc at the detention facility and gets frozen in cryostasis. Flash forward to the far future when a space shuttle full of teenagers arrives on a field trip where they explain how Earth had to be evacuated due to toxic pollution. So let's see - in between Jason being frozen (surrounded by the corpses of missing military and science personnel) and the complete exodus of every human being on the planet no one else investigated what happened there? >>facepalm<<

At least take the effort to have Jason's last Earthbound murders to occur during the exodus. Everyone is scrambling like all hell to get to the great Space Ark, or whatever and Jason and his victims just get written off. Some kind of logic bridge like that would have been easier to swallow.

The rest of the movie is just preposterous garbage, even for a Friday movie. So very little effort comes across. Devoid of any real scares and only a few notable original kills, I have to say this should be avoided. Maybe if it's on TV and you really want to see all the Fridays.

Jason X is on a space ship.  He kills the researchers one by one.  One ridiculous aspect of the movie is that one of the researchers is a super powerful robotic woman with combat skills who is basically the only chance the human researchers have of surviving against the new and improved, extra resilient Jason.

She gives Jason every single bit of aggressive combat she possesses... so the question now becomes, is it enough?  Is it enough to take out the hockey mask wearing invincible freak?  You know it's not!  Anyway, the movie liked to tease whether she was human or not.  It was honestly really dumb and unappealing the way she would STILL communicate with everyone even after her head popped off.  It's not terrible because it didn't make sense; it was terrible because it made viewers question it and ask themselves ""Why is THIS crap in a Friday the 13th movie?""

Anyway, on to other things.

The storyline takes place hundreds of years into the future.  Oh boy- a space ship AND a time machine plotline.  This is pretty dog on bad, folks.  You'd be better off not even acknowledging any of this.  It's all about ""When will Jason attack?  How strong will he be?  How will he brutally murder the poor researchers?"" and not even concern yourself with anything else.

You will get your fill of sex, sex, and more sex.  Alright it's not *that* much this time around, and the nudity is severely reduced to only a couple scenes surprisingly enough.  The sex is frequent but the nudity has been kept hidden for the most part.

Overall, enjoy Jason X for one reason and one reason only- to find out how Jason will massacre everybody.  There's plenty of boredom in between the killings which is why I lowered the rating one point.  The other reason I lowered a point is because the setting takes place in outer space, of course.

I'm not saying that's a bad thing but it's like a interesting idea to move Jason away from the typical of what we've come to know about his character, still killing people even in space.

Actually, it would've, I thought this movie sucked too. Its pretty much a group of kid students, researching in space, and theres something about the end of the Earth, so the whole world is being transmitted to this new planet, this wa so stupid, and in my opinio, hard to watch for me.

1747721,1,B00006FI0S,"After his supposed demise at the end of Jason Goes to Hell, Jason once again makes another return in a tenth movie. How he gets out of hell is never explained. He's just there.

As for the movie itself, it's downright silly. At the beginning, Jason's all chained up in a research facility at Crystal Lake. Surprise, surprise, Jason gets out and kills everyone except for one rather attractive woman who manages to lock up Jason in a cryogenics chamber, but ends up getting wounded and frozen herself as well. Now flash forward a few hundred years into the future. Earth is burnt out and no longer habitable. A group of students from ""Earth 2"" discover both the woman and Jason. They bring both onto their ship in space and Jason gets loose. Now I didn't expect that at all...

Honestly, other from the change of scenary, there's really nothing new here. Jason kills and kills. Plus, the whole movie was just cheesy. The sets are really fake looking, which resulted the movie appearing like a bad sci-fi show. The acting was not very good, but what do you expect from a Jason movie? Also, Jason himself didn't look very good. He even looked better in Jason Goes to Hell(although he's not in that one very much). What I'm saying is that Jason didn't look very intimidating in this film. He had quite a bit of hair on his head this time, and he even seemed kinda human. He goes through a transformation later, and his new look makes him look even more stupid. As if the idea that he could possess bodies in Jason Goes to Hell was not stupid enough, they practically make him into a robot/mutant later in this movie. Plus, that whole bit about how he could regenerate was just lame. He wasn't able to do that in the other movies.

The characters in this film are utterly forgettable. Just about all of them get killed. There are even space marines in this too and Jason manages to kill them all as well. The kills are not very impressive either. At least the other Jason movies had some interesting kill sequences. But the ones in this movie seem tame in comparison to those movies. The only kill that was sort of cool was when Jason kills that woman by freezing her head and smashing it to pieces. Other than that, there's really nothing else.

This is not something I'm going to keep watching over and over again. In fact, I may not watch it ever again! Let's just enjoy the Jason we know and love from the Friday the 13th films. Some of them, the first four for example, were actually creepy, and the sixth one was pushing it a little bit because that's where Jason was brought back to life, but it was actually pretty good in my opinion. Jason X didn't have that feel. Jason X is a joke. Just stay away from it. If you like Jason Vorhees, stay AWAY from Jason X.",1255478400,,2762,4.409803921568628

They are found 450 years later and brought on board a space craft where a scientist and his team of teenage students revive them and mayhem ensues.

I thought the premise to get Jason to space and catapult him ahead a few centuries was kind of clever and there are some moments of humor throughout the movie that worked, but otherwise it's the same old same old. No one can act, they all do stupid things that no one not in a horror movie would do and Jason just walks around slaughtering everyone.

1747724,1,B00006FI0S,"I just finished watching Jason X.
I waited this long (about 7 years since its release) to watch this movie. I already knew it was going to be horrible, but I seriously had NO IDEA it was going to be this bad!

First off, I am a huge fan of the horror genre, and a HUGE Friday the 13th / Jason fan. I own every Friday the 13th film (except for this one). They have ranged from great to so-so or even cheesy. But overall, I have always enjoyed seeing one of my favorite Horror icons on the screen, causing mayhem, and sending people running with terror, and leaving us viewers watching and waiting for more.

Friday the 13th part 8 and 9 (jason takes Manhattan , and Jason goes to hell) are probably the worst of the series I had seen, until today. Now, instead of taking Jason out of his Crystal Lake woods and thrusting him onto a party ship, then the city streets of Manhattan, or even taking Jason out of the picture as he possesses bodies like he a virus or spirit, Jason X has taken him into space for a tacky, low budget, desperate attempt to be original while cling onto something from the original vision of Jason.

First, Jason himself, looks and feels ""C-grade film'. The costumes are tacky, and look like Halloween store rentals.  The failed attempts to paint a futuristic 2400's through cheesy sets and horrible costumes, look in fact very ""present day"" and very ridiculous. The space ship looks of plastic and tacky flashing lights. Also, there is NO character development. When Jason attacks, you really don't know who the victim is, nor do you care. Not to mention, it seems the fellow crew members don't care either. The acting is so bad, that the exploring soilders or students find bodies and react so artificially, or non emotionally, you wonder if they are fresh out of acting school or even went. There's a (typical) android humanoid who is a kind of ""sex bot"" and the typical money hungry villian whose selfishness allows for a shallow plot to turn to mayhem. But he ends up getting his! (Surprise Surprise.) Just as you realize this is predictable, and you feel really uninterested.. then it gets WORSE!!!!  Jason goes from his already horrible attempt to look like the original Jason Voorhees, to a new, Cyborg Jason, stomping around in a HORRIBLE robo-hockey mask, and robotic arm complete with cheesy robo muscles on the biceps and chest. And we're not talking believable Cyborg looks here (like terminator etc) We're talking plastic and foam with cheap paint ridiculous prostetics. Absolutley pathetic. Additionally, the movie itself isn't even decent. Setting aside my love of Friday the 13th and of Horror films, the movie had no flow, no climax, nothing interesting about it. Its poorly done. Plain and simple. The look, feel, script, acting, sets, costumes, and ""scare factor"" are on par or even lower with a Sci-Fi Channel original movie. (Emphasis on the 'Lower').

Any fan of horror, or the Friday the 13th series, or even of a good movie in general... BEWARE! The only thing that's scary about this movie, is how it got signed off on, and how you got stuck watching it. Rental movie for sure! You'll want your $4 back afterwards.

Jason is finally caught and cryogenically frozen for hundreds of years (along with a young female who was about to become his victim) but is regenerated by a bunch of students (it's not really clear what they are studying, but it's not really important either) on a spaceship in the year 2455, where he immediatly proceeds to kill them off one-by-one in his usual gory/creative ways.

Although only rated 15, this movie is deffinatly not lacking in gore and is probably more gory than some of the more heavily cut Friday the 13th movies. I thought that there was a lot of suspence, too, as you know Jason is ALWAYS near the charatecters as they are all trapped together. The character development was great in this movie, too.

1747860,2,B00006FI0S,"The thing about this movie is this:

- as a Friday movie, it sucks big gorilla fingers. There's too much wrong with it to be consistent.

- step aside from all you know about any other Friday movie, and it sort of works.

I'm a huge Jason fan, but the last 2 films (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jason-X/dp/B00006FI0R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jason X</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jason-Goes-to-Hell/dp/B00006FDBT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jason Goes to Hell</a>), seem more like side projects and not actual Friday the 13th films. Jason X disregards many aspects the diehard fans cannot possibly look over.
For example:
- Why does Jason have so much hair? It's so frizzy, almost like an afro.
- When is it supposed to have taken place, after coming back from hell, from the sewers of NY? It seems to be some time around now (2010?) but it isn't clear.
- Why is Jason's mask so new, so intact (especially after getting split and destroyed in previous films), yet still have the split in the forehead from part 3?
- Why is Jason so clean, so un-rotted? In part 7 & 8, he skin was brown, almost black (even in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Freddy-vs-Jason/dp/B0000VCZMK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Freddy vs. Jason</a>&nbsp;his skin is black). Here, you clearly see pinkish, flesh colored skin, especially around the face and hands. They explain it that he can regenerate new tissue, but that's just weak. He wouldn't/couldn't have rotted so much in part 7 if he could regenerate new tissue.
- Why is everyone on the ship so freaking hot? Why is the professor the only adult on there, surrounded by a bunch of ""college"" kids?

These questions aren't answered, and don't really expect them to be. This is why so many people hate this movie. And I, as a hardcore Jason fan, agree with them.

But as a spin-off of the Friday the 13th series (alah, the many paperback novels spun from this series), it definitely works. Forget all you know about Jason and Crystal Lake and let this story fill you in on whatever fits to the plot.

That being said I have to make one more statement: any series that takes the plot in space (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leprechaun-4-In-Space/dp/B000055WFU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leprechaun 4 - In Space</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hellraiser-Bloodline/dp/B00004Y633/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hellraiser - Bloodline</a>) is definitely hurting for ideas and it's time to kill the franchise. Until we can really see ourselves in space, please don't take our favorite characters we've grown to love and commit the ultimate abortion by sending them in space. No matter how plausible you try to make it seem, it's just pathetic and ridiculous.",1201132800,3,2886,5.8108747044917255

It was terrible when they tryed to send Leprechaun into space and it was even worse when they tryed to send Jason into space! This is by far the lowest point in the series. This series should've ended years ago, But filmmakers saw that they could make a lotta money producing sequels to these movies so, The series continued and continued and the inevitable result of that is movies like this.

Back to Jason X though before I get some negative comments. This movie was fun to watch but the story line is stupid. The movie is what every Friday the 13th should be- high body counts with some very cool deaths and sex, but I didn't fawn over the new Cyber Jason. I think the problem with the movie was computer graphics. I the like Friday the 13th series to be naked; Meaning a place that looks like somewheres where you've been and scenes without computer graphics. Sure its easier to make a movie today with computer graphics but some movies don't need computer graphics. Friday the 13th is one of those movies.

1747864,3,B00006FI0S,"It took almost a decade to dust off this old chestnut of a series and bring us its tenth installment.  It has the highest budget of any of the Friday the 13th films and managed to just break even worldwide. It is the least successful of the series but that certainly doesn't make it the worst.  Then again, Jason X would have some really difficult competition if it wanted the title as worst in the long running Friday the 13th series.

It is the year 2010, Jason Voorhees has been captured by the government and he is to be executed.  After many failed attempts they decide he is indestructible and must be cryonically preserved.  Now we fast forward to the year 2455.  Of course even then there is a population of young people on a field trip with their teacher.  They are touring the area where Jason and some girl were frozen.  They decide to take the frozen bodies to their spacecraft.  The bodies are studied in space and Jason of course wakes up after being thawed and kills many.  The girl who was frozen with Jason acts as the primary heroine and of course she knows all about Jason from way back in 2010.  Jason gets shot up pretty bad by some hot looking android girl with detachable areolas.  Somehow, some technology transforms Jason into a cyborg and it makes him even tougher than before.  Jason decapitates the android girl.  Jason then gets distracted by a virtual reality of Crystal Lake (where he simulates killing some partially nude campers in their sleeping bags in an absurdly hilarious scene).  Just then the survivors take off; Jason is sent spiraling into the Earth's atmosphere where he and his ship are quickly turned to dust.

Jason X comes off as more of a nostalgic celebration of the series as a whole.  It pokes fun at how ridiculous it is to have gone as far as it does.  At the same time it still remains a guilty sequel.  Of the movies after part 4, I really appreciate Jason X the most.  It is clearly comedic and has so many great murders (28 deaths in all) that you cannot possibly hate this movie if you are a fan of any of the films after part 5.  It is what it is though, a guilty pleasure.  But this time the tongue-in-cheek film makers do not need to feel as guilty as the audience.",1185321600,4,2226,4.404411764705882

There is some humor in this series now more than in the first couple of installments. Ever since ""Jasons Lives"" there is almost a tougue and cheek approach to these films. ""Jason Lives"" is where I really started to notice the difference in these films.

It is not that ""Jason Lives"" is the best Friday it is the first time I realized that Jason was here to stay! The James Bond homage in the beginning of that film says it all. ""Jason X"" is a welcome edition to the franchise after the awful ""Jason goes to Hell"".

Subject: Jason Voorhees.

Status:Awaiting Cryogenic Suspension.

Indestructible mass murderer Jason Voorhees (Kane Hodder), who is thought to be responsible for over 200 murders, has been captured and is being held prisoner. Dr. Rowan (Lexa Doig) is planning to freeze Jason as all attempts to execute him have failed. Dr. Wimmer (director David Cronenberg) however has other ideas and insists that because Jason can regenerate any damaged tissue he is far to valuable to freeze. Before long Wimmer and his soldiers are all dead and Jason is again on the loose. Rowan manages to trap Jason into the freezing pod and start the process. Jason sticks his machete through the pods door, stabbing Rowan and causing a breach, they are both cryogenically frozen.

The film then fast forwards over 400 years into the future to 2455. The Earth can no longer sustain life and is just a barren lifeless wasteland, a bit like some of the UK is now really. Humans now live on Earth 2. Professor Lowe (Jonathan Potts) and four of his students, Janessa (Melyssa Ade), Stoney (Yani Gellman), Kinsa (Melody Johnson) plus Azrel (Dov Tiefenbach) and a babe of a android called Kay-Em 14 (Lisa Ryder) find both Rowan and Jason while on Earth 1 for some reason I can't think of right now, and take them back to their spaceship called the 'Grendel'. They revive Rowan and introduce her to everyone including the other characters we haven't seen yet who are Waylaner (Derwin Jordan) and Kay-Em's programmer Tsunaron (Chuck Campbell). They take Jason to a laboratory so a blonde babe of a student (why were none of my fellow class-mates as beautiful looking as her?) named Adrienne (Kristi Angus, if you ever need a date Kristi drop me an E-mail!) can conduct some experiments on him, and his eyeball. Soon enough Jason is up and walking around and kills Adrienne, shame that I thought she was a real babe and very easy on the eyes! Jason then kills Stoney and sets his sights on everyone else on board! Luckily it just so happens that besides a bunch of students there are also a platoon of heavily armed soldiers on board! But can even Sargeant Brodski (Peter Mensah) and his team of 'grunts', Kicker (Barna Moricz), Briggs (Dylan Bierk), Dallas (a cameo by screenwriter Todd Farmer), Condor (Steve Lucescu), Sven (Thomas Seniuk) and Geko (Amanda Brugel) stop the seemingly invincible Jason?

Directed by Jim Isaac. I had a blast watching this. There are lots of sequences that I had fun with. The script by Todd Farmer never seems to take itself too seriously and moves along like a rocket. The space setting is different for the Friday the 13th films and overall I really liked it. The interior of the spaceship looked suitably futuristic with plenty of computers and bright neon lighting, the props were cool as well with some great over-the-top looking guns and I especially liked Jason's new shiny chrome ultra sleek medical machete. There are some cool kills as well, someone is impaled on a large drill and spins round as they reach the bottom, the total babe Adrienne who I wanted to survive or at least make it further into the film has her face frozen and then smashed to pieces and in a yucky scene she also cuts Jason's hockey mask off his face with a scalpel which reveals Jason's rotting face beneath, there are slit throats, people cut in half, decapitations, mangled bodies and someone has their arm cut off with a machete.

This Friday the 13th delivers more gore than most of the previous instalments. I loved the scene where Lisa Ryder dresses up in skin tight PVC, arms herself with some serious firepower and battles it out with Jason, a scene that looks like it could have come straight out of the Matrix (1999), but it's more fun here. The special effects are good, the CGI isn't always brilliant but it more than satisfactory for a relatively low budget film. The acting is OK, at least everyone manages to keep a straight face, and did I mention that Adrienne is a seriously hot looking young lady? David Cronenberg's cameo at the beginning is also rather cool. On the down side it becomes a little too silly for the last 20 or so minutes. I mean Jason flying through space and talking decapitated robotic heads?

Overall I think this is a highly entertaining film that I had an absolute blast watching. As long as you don't take it too seriously this is a lot of fun. I'm a huge fan of Friday the 13th (1980) and it's numerous sequels and this is a good one. Highly entertaining, and definitely recommended if you're in the right mood.",1161043200,2,4582,4.72

New Line realized that they needed to shape up the series again and make a movie about the Jason that we know and appreciate from his classic incarnations.  Jim Isaac obviously respects the series enough as a fan to make a movie for the fans, which is what this is.  If you're a casual moviegoer, don't watch this movie, you won't get it.  Friday the 13th fans, you're in for an awsome journey.  Jason has been captured and executed multiple times to no avail.  Well, throw logic out the window folks, cuz there's not much left after the opening credits.  First of all, the main female protagonist managed to survive ""over 400 years"" by lying on the floor in a frozen room.  Thankfully, in 2455 they have the technology.  They could make her better than she was before.  Anyway, a group of students on a field trip to the ravaged Earth bring Jason and his female nemesis back to the Grendel, their school ship.  Jason wakes up and...kills almost everyone.  Relax, it's a fun ride for us fans.  The only thing that bothers me is that the sets, music,  and CG make the movie seem a little too much like a crappy Sci-Fi original, but if you start thinking that, just remember that it's Jason X.  There are some things I don't like.  One of them is how the characters make too many wisecracks and jokes when they are clearly in a life or death situation.  ""Why don't you stick your head out and have a peek?"" or ""This sucks on so many levels!"" right before she gets sucked out into space.  I'd yell something like, ""Help me!"".  I wouldn't refer to my own death.  There is a good line though: ""It's ok, guys!  He just wanted his machete back!""  That was genius.  The other thing I don't like is how Jason and Sgt. Brodski manage to survive the massive explosion of a space ship in one piece, and how Brodski comes out of nowhere and pushes him away.  It'll make more sense once you see the movie, but it seems like a cheap cop-out.  Jason's design is cool, but his mask doesn't seem right.  It's not the same as it used to be, and he has too much hair, which is never how he looked.  ""Uber Jason"" as they call him looks pretty awsome, but I'm not really getting how he came to be.

Compared with the downright awfull part 9, i.e., Jason Goes to hell this sequell has a better script, dialogue, acting and plot. Part 9 was the first time New Line owned the rights to the movie (it was prior to this owned by paramount) and there first crack at making the sequells, was if one is kind less then stellar and if one is honest, one of the worst movies I have ever seen. This time they put a little bit more time and effort into the sequell and yeah it is not a quality movie but compared to the rest of the friday the 13th franchise this is one of the better entries. Even so it is not as good as part 4 or part one and it might sound like a paradox (since I have written that it was so much better then part 9 which I gave one star) that I only give the movie 2 stars. But being the 10 part in the series, the budget, and special effects are on the level of mediocre sequells. The dialogue is yes better then part nine but it is still pretty awfull and it sounds like the script and dialogue writers just barely finished community college.

1747935,2,B00006FI0S,"I'll get this out of the way: I never liked the 80's slasher films. Stuff like the Halloween series, Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th just never entertained me all that much. The idea of slow walking killers going after Olympic sprinters and still get caught felt really ridiculous to me. Of course the major draw was the death scenes: elaborate moments of viciousness. Flinging Jason into the future is of course going to elicit unintentional laughing but it's a good kind of laughing for some reason.

Jason is in the future in a facility on a planet, except he escapes(of course). Disposing of scientists, including The Fly and Scanners director David Cronenberg, he ends up getting cryogenically frozen, along with another scientist. Flash forward 400 years and a ship discovers them and founds out, ooh, a nice reward for Jason. As usual he comes to life and does what he does best: kill attractive looking hotties.

You don't go to these movies to expect well-written dialogue, character depth or anything, you come for the kills and to tell you the truth, they're slightly disappointing. Besides one kill, which answers the question of what happens when a frozen face hits a hard surface, the kills are kind of been there/done that. It's basically stab here, impale there, it seems kind of unimaginative. A few even happen off screen with the yelling off in the distance.

Characters are just there to be taken care of brutally and some are. However, Jason does what I'm starting to hate is kill off the very cute girls. One girl, wearing a top with a belly showing gets disposed off(off screen) and I'm like ""damn guy, let one cute girl live for once!"". Dialogue is of course stupid but there were some funny lines. A self-deprecating parody about the sex teens have in the film is referenced. ""We love premarital sex!"" is so classic, as well as ""it's okay, he just wanted his machete back!"". Granted they won't make an AFI list but they made me laugh.

For those of you wondering just how the hell Jason Voorhees manages to get his moldy ass shipped out into space, here's the scoop.  Set in the near future, Jason has been captured and kept alive by a research team who want to study his amazing ability to keep regenerating himself after being (supposedly) killed so many times.  But not long after the opening credits are over, Jason escapes and wipes out a whole crew of people.  He is finally forced into a cryogenic chamber where he and a lovely scientist, Rowan, are frozen.  Flash forward some 400 years later and a team of space scientists set down on the now desolate planet Earth to find the two bodies, still perfectly frozen.  They take them on board and set back out into space, eager to take their new specimens to Earth II.  Actually, this is a team of science students, so you know what that means, right?  That's right, lots of young very attractive people in skimpy outfits to fill the screen with.  This also means that there will be something stylish on board for Rowan to wear (something to showoff a little cleavage) once she's unthawed.  And most importantly, it means that once defrosted himself, Jason has a team of horny knuckleheads to slay.  HOORAY!  But also traveling with the students and their instructor is a team of gruff, heavily armed military types, I guess to guard the kids in case anything funky should happen.  And you know what that means too, right?  That's right, there's even MORE people for Jason to kill.  DOUBLE HOORAY!!  So of course, Jason gets defrosted and goes on a non-stop killing spree like you've never seen before, not just because he's in space now, but because the body count in Jason X is at least double that of any of the other Friday the 13th films.  That right there should be initiative enough to go out and see this flick.

It may be hard to believe, but strip away the goofy sci-fi backdrop and what you have here is a traditional Friday the 13th movie.  You have your bubbleheaded teens concerned mostly with getting laid, in the Rowan character, you kinda have your crazy old man crying ""YOU'RE ALL DOOMED!"" as soon as she finds out that Jason has been set free, you've got your little weird side characters like the pilot of the ship and an overweight maintenance type guy who are just waiting to buy it and you have a pretty healthy amount of gore, way more than was seen in the last few Friday films.  But of course, a high-tech spaceship pales in comparison to the dark woods of Camp Crystal Lake as Jason's hunting grounds.  Oh well, but as I mentioned before, the body count makes up for this shift in gears.

This is also perhaps one of the meanest Jason's I've ever seen.  He seems incredibly threatening this time around and once he gets his hands on his pray, he has no qualms about thrashing them around a bit before skewering them or ripping limb from limb.  This Jason is PISSED and I love it!  Voorhees is back in true form, which brings me back to my next point.  I was dismayed to find out that Jason was gonna get an ""upgrade"" and not a very good looking one at that.  It looks like something out of Captain Eo.  But for those who also find the thought of their horror hero being needlessly tampered with, do not worry, as this change only takes up the last fifteen minutes of the film.  Everything before that is prime Jason, just as we know and love him.

Also, do not let the trailer fool you into thinking that this film is overflowing with tunes from the nu-metal cess pool as there is not a one, at least not until the end credits anyways.  Nope, you get to kick back and enjoy the soothing music of Henry Manfredini as Jason goes to work.

Besides supplying Friday the 13th fans with an abundance of sex and violence, I think the major key to the film's success is that the filmmakers ran with the ridiculousness of the idea instead of trying to take it seriously.  This film gets more regoddamndiculous as it goes on, but it's so fun that by the halfway mark, I was willing to buy anything they wanted to throw at me, just keep the fun coming.

So if you're down for a silly hack-and-slash flick, you can do no wrong with Jason X.  But now that Jason has conquered Manhattan, burning hell and outer space, how 'bout we get him back to his old stomping grounds of Camp Crystal Lake, huh?",1141948800,2,4541,4.3964071856287426

The person in charge of overseeing the freeze is Rowan (Lexa Doig), but unfortunately she is overruled by men who wish to take Jason as he is.  Bad choice on their parts, for Jason soon kills the whole group.  But Rowan manages to lure Jason into the cyro chamber.  However, something goes wrong and Rowan is frozen along with Jason.

Now fast-forward 400 years into the future.  A group of science students on their way to ""old earth"" find both Jason and Rowan in perfect cyro freeze.  It was originally thought that Rowan was the only one of the two still alive, but Jason soon proves them wrong.  Soon, Jason is up to his old machete-wielding tricks, proving that his blade is still as sharp as ever.  The body count begins to rise under Jason's blade, but a few of the students, along with a military sergeant, Rowan, and a cool female android have managed to survive.  The android proves to be up to the task of fighting Jason, and soon he's nothing but a dismembered clump on the floor.  But is this the end for Jason, or will he re-awaken to continue his most recent blood bath?

I thought this was a very good film.  I'm a big fan of the ""Friday the 13th"" series, and this movie contains some of Jason Voorhies at his grisly best.  The fight scenes with the android are some of the best of the movie, and the flashbacks to the 1980  camp Crystal Lake are really cool as well.  It was nostalgic to see the two female campers in their sleeping bags and how Jason disposed of them.  I give this movie my highest recommendation.  Fans of the series will surely enjoy watching Jason take his killing spree into space against some more unsuspecting victims.",1140307200,,2012,4.46027397260274

1747973,1,B00006FI0S,"I usually try to be fair with reviews, but this is probably the worst movie I've ever seen.  In a movie series with basically no point, this one takes pointlessness to extremes.

I generally enjoy horror movies--even stupid ones--but this is completely empty.

It's a huge budget failure:

The action is boring as hell, even when a dumb cyborg character is kicking the crap out of Jason.  Jason's new look was completely dull, cheesy and unconvincing.  Hell, it doesn't even add a new level of horror, or of amusment.  At least a B-movie can get a few laughs and enjoyment for the cheese factor, but not Jason X. The story is annoying, let alone dumb, and was obviously just an attempt to cash in on folks who can't smell a fraud.

Jason certainly did go to hell, and he took me with him on this one.",1136937600,2,800,4.431506849315069

Certainly it's not as moody and scary as previous Fridays were, but it's definately a nice entertainment, interesting to watch and it's funny! A vast field for experiments for Kane Hodder's Jason meaning the quantity of characters to kill. When I first saw all those people (much more than in usual Friday serie), I thought: wow, the body count would be immense. And, indeed, the number of murdered characters and the ways of killings will impress you. Jason's rampage looks really brutal.

The idea of putting Jason in space might be a bit stupid, but on the other hand this is not the kind of film you need to concentrate on the plot. I was just trying to watch and have fun, that's all.

If to compare ""Jason X"" to ""Freddy VS Jason"" I'd pick the first one. Because many people from previous Fridays were involved, I'd call them "" franchise spirit keepers"" - Sean Cunningham, Harry Manfredini, Kane Hodder...

The edition itself is pretty good, among extra features there are ""jump to death"" option, ""making of"" featurette and a half-hour documentary ""Many Lives of Jason Voorhees"".

When we last saw Jason the killer die again in JASON GOES TO HELL: THE FINAL FRIDAY (1993), a beam of light from outer space had occurred exploding him.  We also saw the knife-hand of Freddy Kruger (from the Nightmare on Elm Street film series) grabbing the hockey mask.
  Well, that idea of bringing Freddy Kruger and Jason together was put on hold for awhile due to years of negotiations.  They decided to make JASON X (2001) first.
  This is the tenth film in the Friday the 13th film series and it is Kane Hodder's fourth and last outing as ""Jason""---the killer.
  It has been eight years since the last movie Jason Goes To Hell: The Final Friday (1993) and Sean S. Cunningham takes the production helm again.
  Jason Voorhees is currently ""Awaiting Cryogenic Suspension"" in 2008.  He is alive all right.  The military comes to claim him with Dr. Wimmer (David Cronenberg).  I won't tell you how, but Jason escapes and kills seven people in 2 minutes.  Now he is after Rowan (Lexa Doig) who manages to coax him into the freeze chamber.  Suddenly lockdown occurs and Rowan is trapped.
  It is now the year 2455. 447 years have gone by. A space crew from Grendel discovers the spaceship Jason and Rowan are frozen in and they both are brought back aboard to thaw and bring back to life.  They think Jason is actually a humanoid museum piece.  Well, he is going to thaw out grumpy and as sex is going on in Spaceship Grendel, Jason finds a whole spaceship of people to kill as it makes its flight back to Earth 2.
  Body count: 24  (26, if you count the hologram girls).
  Next film: Freddy Verses Jason (2003).

1748026,4,B00006FI0S,"Judging by the reviews, it seems that people's opinions about this movie are quite bipolar.  Maybe not love-it-or-hate-it, but ""that was fun"" vs ""what were they thinking?"".  I'm in the former camp myself, but my situation might not be typical.

By no criteria could I be described as a Fri-13th fan.  Sure, I went through a slasher-movie phase when I was in middle school, but I haven't appreciated much out of the genre for over a decade.

What I do like, however, are ""good bad movies"", and in this regard, ""Jason X"" serves itself up quite well.  To be pedantic, I wouldn't describe this as a ""true"" bad movie, in that most of the laughs aren't coming indeliberately.  From the writer on up, ""Jason X"" was created with the sole purpose of being tongue-in-cheek, and that means prioritizing entertainment/amusement over thrills and chills, and I belive they did a fine job.

I mean, really ... ""Guys, it's okay! He just wanted his machete back!""  How can you interpret this as anything but silly fun?  From the opening shot -- with the location-subtitle, ""Camp Crystal Lake Research Facility"" -- this movie is poking fun at itself.

You don't need to know about the plot.  It's a rehash of ""Alien"", when you get down to it.  Think:  the story from ""Alien"" -- with a few military bits and big guns from ""Aliens"" thrown in -- starring ""Jason"" and having the self-deprecating humor of ""Scream"".  There are also a lot of interesting/weird/occasionally funny computer/tech references sprinkled about to amuse the geeks in the audience (including myself); while I don't understand why that recurring theme was there, I appreciated it anyway.

All that said, here's my theory:  with ""Jason X"", New Line has redefined the Fri-13th franchise from ""campy thrillers with moments of comic relief"" to ""gory comedies featuring Jason"".  And as a result, those who were disappointed in this movie were either (a) those who were anticipating a Fri-13th thriller of old, or (b) those who were taking the movie too seriously.

It's easy to pick apart ""Jason X"" for it's poor sense of suspense, character development, originality, dialogue delivery, (add whatever traits you want here), but this is a movie that doesn't take itself seriously, and it's not meant to be compared with ""Citizen Kane"".  Turn off your logical centers, watch ""Jason X"" with a group of good-natured friends after a few inebriants -- and most importantly, don't expect a scary movie.  You'll have a great time.

(Enough about the movie itself; the DVD stands out from others for having some really noteworthy extras.  Namely a feature that shows you only the ""kill scenes"" from the movie, plus the ability to displlay a ""random kill"".  How hilarous is that?)",1132444800,,2714,4.888402625820569

1748028,1,B00006FI0S,"this movie is totally stupid.  stupid.  stupid.  i LOVE horror movies, and the friday the 13th movies are a lot of fun.

this is not a friday the 13th movie.  it comes across as though the worst studio in town got the worst director, with the dumbest taste, and tried to create something in the niche of the current STUPID trend in horror movies:  stupid jokes at times when no one would ever make a joke.  this one moment says it all:  a girl is about to get hacked by jason, and on top of that, a hole in the space ship is sucking her out into space, where she will float around, dead, for all eternity.  she yells, hilariously (?), ""this sucks on so many levels!""  yuck yuck. it comes across as if a really bad movie was made about a killer on a space ship.  they realized they needed more of a gimmick, so they licensed the use of jason as the killer.  i'd bet money that is what happened, whether they claim it or not.  again, this is not a friday the 13th movie.  there is no similarity, in terms of style or tone.  imagine dumb and dumber, but jason is the 3rd character.  that would have about the same similarity to friday the 13th as this movie does.",1128902400,2,1160,4.157657657657658
1748029,1,B00006FI0S,"I've tried watching this movie twice. I just can't pay attention. It's stupid, boring, bad actors, you name it. Don't waste your time.",1127865600,3,134,4.869565217391305
1748030,3,B00006FI0S,"If the question is how far can you push the ""Friday the 13th"" series, then ""Jason X"" answers that question.  Actually, it answers that question where you are talking distance (because it takes place in deep space) or if you are talking time (it takes place in the far future).  Of course, there is now an entire sub-genre of horror films in space, that is to say, where a horror franchise suddenly puts its monster in space.  Here we have Jason Voorhees, but there is also Pinhead in Space (a.k.a. ""Hellraiser: Bloodline"") and Dracula in Space (a.k.a. ""Dracula 3000: Infinite Darkeness"").  Put all these films together and they are not as good as ""Alien,"" but you know that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and flattery is a high art in Hollywood.

The fact that this movie went from the working title ""Friday the 13th Part 10,"" to ""Jason 2000,"" ""Jason 2000: Friday the 13th Part X,"" and ""Jason X: Friday the 13th Part 10,"" simply reflects the idea that the people putting together this movie were never quite sure what they wanted to do.  In the prologue Jason (Kane Hodder back again, for all that it matters) has been hanging around in a security complex, breaks free, and before he can wreck too much havoc is cryogenically frozen, as is Rowan (Lexa Doig).  More than four hundred years later a research vessel run by Professor Lowe (Jonathan Potts), visits the contaminated Earth and retrieves both popsicles.  Aboard their spaceship Lowe's students thaw out Rowan, whose first concern is whether Jason is restrained and not that everybody she ever knew and her music collection are now dead and gone respectively.  Of course, her warning comes too late and Jason comes up with a most impressive futuristic way of dispatching his first victim.  Unfortunately that is also the best of the many deaths to come in this 2001 film.

There are some interesting ideas here, and I do not mean the replaceable nipples on the robot (that got your attention, I bet).  We have gotten to the point where Jason's ability to take a lickin' and keep on tickin' is now explained as a unique ability to regenerate lost and damaged tissue.  Whether the explanation for this can be turned into scientific terms is never quite clear, but in the brave new world in which Jason thaws out science is capable of reattaching arms that Jason severs and cutting off a head is not necessarily cutting off a head.  Jason might have a little tiny brain, but they still manage to play with it now and then in this movie.  There are some moments when characters drive their own tongues through the side of their mouths without any assistance from Jason, and then the movie tries to play things straight so that you end up thinking they have spliced outtakes into the film for the laughs.

The best special effects are in the title sequences, which suggests something better is to come, but it does not.  This movie has Sgt. Brodski (Peter Mensah) and his Marines as part of the ship's compliment, so that this movie tries to ripoff off ""Aliens"" as well as ""Alien.""  Not that there is anything wrong with that, because the charm, so to speak, of this movie is that it takes the approach of throwing in everything including the kitchen sink.  ""Jason X"" proves that in the world of horror movies there are two universal constants.  The first is that serial slashers will never, ever stop slicing and dicing, no matter where (or when) you put them.  The second is that teenagers will always be more interested in having sex than staying alive.  That explains why there have been (to date) eleven movies featuring Jason (with ""Jason vs. Freddy"" following this one).",1127001600,,3643,4.686028257456829

THE WHO'S WHO: Starring Lexa Doig, Lisa Ryder, Chuck Campbell, Jonathan Potts, Peter Mensah, Melyssa Ade, Melody Johnson, Phillip Williams, Derwin Jordan, Dov Tiefenbach, Kane Hodder, David Cronenberg. Score Composed By Harry Manfredini. Co-Executive Produced By Sean S. Cunningham. Co-Executive Produced and Directed By Jim Isaac. (R) For Violence, Gore, Profanity, Drug Use, Brief Nudity and Mild Sexual Content; 91m.; 2000.

WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?: The latest installment in New Line Cinema's ""let's see how we can toy with true 'Friday' fans"" film series arrives. The year is 2455 and a school science expedition has uncovered a surprising find on the wasteland that was once Earth...a frozen man and woman. Taking this newfound cargo on board their spacecraft, they find that evil still exists. After reanimating the woman (Lexa Doig), they find that the male life form is none other than mongoloid murderer Jason Voorhees (Kane Hodder) who's been patiently waiting for another group of unfortunate people he can mangle his way through. So how did New Line foul this film up? It's hard to pick only one place to begin. Dealing with outer space horror is always a hit or miss affair. Both ""Leprechaun in Space"" and ""Hellraiser: Bloodline"" were noble attempts to craft sci-fi terror from existing storylines. Poor abused Jason doesn't fare half as well as those comparisons. For starters, Jason's appearance has undergone more modifications since we last saw him in ""Jason Goes to Hell"". He's sprouted an almost full head of hair and he looks more human than he has since his inception in ""Part 2"". Most of the cast members seem like they're only along for the ride, and most couldn't act to save their lives. The teen scholars aren't even up to the standards of most generic characterizations. The grunt soldiers seem like nothing more than a cheap knock off of the Colonial Marines from James Cameron's ""Aliens"". The only standout performances come from Lexa Doig as Rowan and Lisa Ryder as the android Kay-Em 14, and even those two have to strain to make their characters appear important in the development of the story. Even if there were more likeable, believable characters, the pace of the film moves too fast to develop any substantial connection. The dialogue is overly corny in its attempts to justifiably portray a high tech future and the half-cocked wisecracks are nothing more than a pathetic attempt to display the fact that the filmmakers have no sense of humor. The film is also too proud of its science fiction trappings, foregoing any real suspense in favor of a flashy, big budget actualization combined with an explicitly dull, low budget mentality. Even composer Harry Manfredini submits to the turgid futuristic atmosphere by turning in a weak, commonplace score that strives to sound like a horror version of the old ""Star Trek"" themes. Overall, this is a jumbled affair that would have found a greater promise if it employed a better cast, a less technologically enthusiastic crew and an entirely different psychopathic focal point.

THEY SAY THEY'RE SPECIAL BUT...: The 1.85:1 widescreen presentation for this film is a prime example of how some DVDs can come off as too digital in their appearance, which hampers the enjoyment of the movie. The composition of the film seems uneven while the general underlying tones are overly grey and sparse and have been interspersed with some truly garish upfront color schemes. Also, remember the annoying blue line running down the right hand side of ""Friday V"" on high definition monitors? Well, now there's an annoying green line running vertically down the left hand side of the screen on this DVD. There's a 5.1 surround sound accompanying the film which is certainly loud but lacks definition and clarity, often times overshadowing the dialogue and lower key effects. Gunfire leaves the only lasting impression on the avid surround sound junkie. There's also a DTS surround sound and a 2.0 stereo surround sound for the film. ""Jason X"" also has English subtitles which are white, easy to read and have been placed within the frame of the movie. The front cover is a space-aged half and half of Jason's hockey mask. The left side is a scratched and dented version of Jason's original mask while the right side is the shiny new metallic version he gets when he is resurrected as ""Uber Jason"". The halves are separated by a knife that reflects a screaming woman covering her naked breasts. The back cover continues the space age motif while the two page insert further intensifies the futuristic fantasy. The two page insert also displays the twenty-six chapter stops for this ninety minute movie. The disc itself has been painted with a smaller representation of the front cover. As they did for ""Jason Goes to Hell"", New Line Cinema packaged the film with some potentially interesting additional material. These include the ""Jump to a Death"" option which was carried over from the ""Jason Goes to Hell"" disc, the original theatrical trailer, two documentaries and a commentary track from director Jim Isaac, writer Todd Farmer and producer Noel Cunningham. The trailer (1:59) has a nice glossy sheen to it, but immediately displays the radical changes to the ""Friday"" formula that would unquestionably doom the film. The addition of Drowning Pool's overused dud ""Bodies"" as a backdrop doesn't help in the slightest. In the first documentary, ""The Many Lives of Jason Voorhees"" (29:53), horror heavyweights Robert Shaye, Joe Bob Briggs, Sean S. Cunningham, and Kane Hodder himself weigh in on the popularity of the ""Friday"" franchise. We're given the chance to see a few still photographs that surrounded some of the earlier entries in the series, but all of the film footage is taken from the New Line produced sequels. There's a lot of congratulatory patting on the back stuff but nothing that makes the documentary worthwhile for anyone outside of the most hardcore ""Friday"" devotee. ""By Any Means Necessary: The Making of Jason X"" (17:30) is another example of overly contented filmmakers spouting off about the joys of their accomplishments. Instead of offering an illuminating portrait of the entire production, space in this documentary is mostly limited to the technical aspects of the film...such as lighting, set design and the use of green screens. The commentary track is a bit choppy and feels longer than it actually is. The three players on the track may be knowledgeable, but they're not very entertaining. There are some drawn out spots with a lot of repetitive overemphasis and unnecessary chatter, leaving the listener with a lackluster, disinterested feeling. The high spots arrive early on in the track when they briefly discuss the seven year (at that point) development of ""Freddy vs. Jason"" and also make another comment about a semi-serious sequel entitled ""Jason Takes L.A."" which director Adam Marcus touched on in the commentary for ""Jason Goes to Hell"". As an added bonus, New Line has thrown in trailers for ""Blade II"" (1:58), ""Final Destination"" (2:22) and ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" (1:51), just to remind fright fans what real horror is supposed to look like. DVD-ROM users also have access to a script-to-screen option and a link to the film's website.

THE YOLK'S ON YOU: New Line has packed this release with enough special features. You're more likely to live after being speared through your stomach than you are of finding hidden easter eggs on this one.

THE LEWD AND NUDE ALERT: The opportunities were presented in this outing for some wondrous nudity but almost none of those opportunities were cashed in. We have a brief glimpse of the stunning Lexa Doig in her grey underwear just before she's reanimated. However, before her underwear is cut off, they switch scenes. Kay-Em 14 (Lisa Ryder) is seen showing off her nipples, but before any profligate viewers out there could get excited, they fall off (implements of a proposed android expansion). Professor Lowe (Jonathan Potts) has a BDSM interlude with Janessa (Melyssa Ade) who shows off her little black panties and big dominatrix attitude, but the moment is too brief to be effective. Kinsa (Melody Johnson) and Stoney (Yani Gellman) have a sexual encounter but the lovely Melody doesn't bare her ravishing physique. The only real nudity comes in the form of two Crystal Lake campers, Kaye Penaflor and Tania Maro, who bare their supple breasts in what is doubtlessly the best scene of the entire production...the virtual eighties' simulation.

THE GORE REPORT: Most of the gore, much like the film itself, has been glossed over for a ""new millennium"" feel. One cast member has his arm hacked off by Jason's machete early on in the film but there's surprisingly little bloodshed. We're treated to a small view of Jason without his mask just before he comes back to life, however his hockey mask is replaced too quickly. It would have been a more interesting film if the hockey mask had stayed off. One of the girls has her face frozen in cryogenic liquid and then Jason smashes her head on a table. One guy receives a fairly graphic gut shot. One character is sliced in half and another has his head chopped off in a virtually simulated game sequence (meaning there's virtually no gore). One of the soldiers is cut in half at the waist and tries to crawl away. There are a number of nice shots of Jason's corpse before he gets his ""upgrade"" that rank as the best gore scenes in the entire film, but with the exception of those corpse scenes, most of the gore seems a tad sterile and, dare I say, boring. Maybe fans were given an overabundance of gore in ""Jason Goes to Hell"", rendering the vestiges seen here obsolete.

SAY AGAIN: ""I don't think he's out there."" - Rowan (Lexa Doig). ""Why don't you just stick your head out and have a peek?"" - Janessa (Melyssa Ade).

THE FINAL SAY: Yes, I recommend buying this DVD. It's a hard recommendation to make, but this film had the potential of being a sci-fi megahit if the filmmakers had been on the ball. Spend a little bit of time reworking the film's dialogue, stop concentrating so much on the spaceship designs and switch the antagonist from Jason Voorhees to some random serial killer. If they had done that, the filmmakers could have easily stretched the concept over a trilogy of new terror films, in essence creating the first consequential horror villain of the millennium. As it stands now, this film is a must for Voorhees completists but has little to offer the casual observer. The movie is good for a few laughs, if only to see how far New Line has taken Jason away from his roots since they took the series over from Paramount. One honest question, however, is why did it take New Line two years to release the film? The end credits of the movie list the production date as 2000 yet it didn't hit theaters until 2002.

Ok so I wasn't looking for an explanation of the universe when I started watching this series of films. And yes, Jason totally messed camp up for me, I admit it. But nothing prepared me for this installment in the original slasher flick genre of films, Friday The 13th. Jason Voorhies went absolutely nuts in this film. His usual kill because he came in his sight type of killings goes all out, with some death scenes sometimes hard to believe, although the liquid nitrogen death got my vote as coolest frickin death scene yet. The neatest thing about this DVD isn't just the latest yuck it up Jason goes on another slashing spree, it's the extras that are on it. The best of all is the retrospective of ""The Many Lives of Jason Voorhies"". It covers a complete history of the series from beginning to end, and you get to meet the actor that has played him the longest. Just one look in his eyes and you cringe with fear, those are the eyes that stared back at you as you died a horrible gruesome Jason death. It includes 2 second commentaries by stars and former production crew, including a director that was an 11 year old boy on the original set. My buddy Joe Bob Briggs (He did TNT's Monster Vision) even adds his delightful views on how screwed you were if you even farted in front of Jason. For true gore fans

None of the movies were meant to be taken seriously, I mean, comn, most of the time people were having sex or smoking pot or being a complete ass that was a magnet to Jason to come and filet them until they bled dry.",1119484800,,1708,4.252307692307692

Over 400 years later a team of space scavengers find CLRC look inside and find none other than Jason Voorhees and that lab girl then when they open the door jason falls over and cuts one guys arm off(even when he's frozen he still tries to kill people)and as soon as he gets on the ship the killing starts again.it's a great movie and anyone who thinks about buying it should at least rent it.well that's all I've got to say about this movie.",1118880000,,1117,4.190697674418605

1748099,2,B00006FI0S,"Jason X (James Isaac, 2001)

Jim Isaac was the guy who did some of the creepy special effects in eXistenZ, but you'd never know it from watching this particular piece of silliness.

Lexa Doig and Lisa Ryder (of Andromeda semi-fame) head up the cast of youngsters ready to get picked off by the uberslasher in the tenth installment of the series. You know the drill: sexy young things wander around and get killed by Jason Voorhees. There's no more of a plot to it than that. This one's set four hundred years in the future, on a spaceship, but still, the plot does not manage to thicken. Alien with Jason Voorhees this movie is not.

Part of the problem with the Friday the 13th series has always been that while it's originally derivative Nightmare on Elm Street franchise allowed its villain to develop and its story to take on some much-needed humor value, the Friday the 13th films (with the notable exception of the underrated, highly amusing Jason Takes Manhattan) have always been humorless, plodding affairs. The suspense died out after the second film, but there wasn't anything to take its place. The attempts at humor and self-parody in Jason X only serve to underline this, coming off truly pathetic rather than witty.

For completists and fans of the various flesh on display. The rest of you can safely ignore it without feeling like you missed much. * ",1115856000,,1367,4.726890756302521
1748100,3,B00006FI0S,"There's been quite a lot of outrage over this movie from various hardcore 'Friday the 13th' fans, and I can't help but laugh.  I enjoy the series as much as the next guy, but it's just a bloated, souless and workman-like cashcow.  It has no grand morals or rules or traditions to violate.  I suppose people get offended when movies start to try to be jokey intentionally, rather than just being so by accident.  (Though it wasn't *always* by accident in the prior films)  And, what can I say, most of the humor is pretty damn stupid, but some of it's actually kinda funny, and it's nice traditional humor rather than smarmy post-slasher referential crap with no actual humor in it.  (I'm not actually wholeheartedly opposed to such films, I just think their notion of cleverness is, well... not very clever)

Well let's see here, 'Jason X' is basically like the other 'Friday the 13th' films, except this one takes place on a space ship.  Sure, it's got sci-fi embellishments, and some silly cyborg stuff at the end, but at it's heart it's just a simple slasher movie.  Sure, there isn't any real suspense of any scares to be had, but it's pleny fast paced with some amusing kills and a reasonable amount of gore for a mainstream film.  (The liquid nitrogen, sleeping bag and giant screw kills are all completely priceless, and easily worth the price of admission)  As for the characters, well they're less obnoxious then they sometimes are in this sorta film, so A+, I say.  And, again, some of the humor is actually kinda funny.  I particularly like the cross-cutting of the scenes of Jason returning from the dead with the various students' lecherous activities, clearly implying that that is what made him arise.  Kane Hodder's performance as Jason is quite great too.  It adds to the whole light-hearted feel as his basic method in this one is too seem vaguely bored and disinterested in the situation.

The movie does lose some momentum as it goes along, as virtually everyone gets killed pretty damn quick, and some of the later plot developments are kinda lame.  But, it's all watchable enough.

Yeah, this movie is fun.  Check it out.

Fast forward many many many years in the future.  Earth is now a polluted wasteland.  Futuristic sex crazed teens bring lead actress and Jason aboard their space ship to thaw them out.  Jason almost immeadiatly begins slicing his way through the new crop of teens.  The soldiers aboard the ship ineffectively hunt him down, and find themselves hunted (oooh.  I didn't see THAT coming).  A sex crazed female android manages to put Jason down so the remaining teens can escape to safety.  Jason, however, thanks to the ship's technology, manages to survive.  In a darkly humerous scene, he is slowed by virtual-reality images (young teens in sleeping bags at Camp Crystal Lake).

I'm not really giving anything away here by saying that Jason is killed seemingly for good, once again (burned up in reentry to Earth's atmosphere).

Jason X is a far more creative entry to the series than the last several tries but still falls a bit flat.  Did there really need to be another Firday The 13th film?  At least this one was sort of good, in a sort of cartoony manner.  Humor was a much needed addition.  A lot of the most effective humor manages to make fun of the series itself!

You can also call this movie Friday the 13th part 10 as well. I really like the part where these two guys are in a virtual reality simulation, but they don't realize their playing with a very deadly competitor, Jason Voorhees. That part was really scary, and funny at same time. This movie has all the common elements of horror/slasher film: It had bad acting, an unrealistic(even if it is a horror movie)plot, nudity, stupid teenager, sex, drugs, and horrible computer effects.  This  movie really is the end of the Jason/Friday the 13th saga. One part that was really cool is when Jason turns into Uber-Jason, a robotic killing machine.  The whole premise of the movie is pretty interesting, this time the unstoppable killer is in space, not at Camp Crystal Lake. It's set in the future, Jason Voorhees gets cryogenicly frozen in a capsule with another person a woman. Planet Earth is no longer inhabitable, so human beings have colonized in outer space. While on a field trip, a class and few marines find two cryogenically frozen bodies. The team is not aware of the unspeakable evil that they are about to release. After defrosting the two bodies, Jason Voorhees soon comes back to life, and starts stalking and murdering the crew one by one. The other person that was thawed out is a young and very beautiful asian woman. The woman tries to warn the other crew members about Jason Voorhees. But most of them are not concerned until people start getting killed. That's when the trouble starts, and he wreaks total havoc on the spaceship. In the end everyone dies apart from Kay-Em, Rowan and the geeky robot guy. Sgt Brodski dies riding uber Jason into earths 2's atmosphere. Jason's mask is seen at the end in an Earth 2 lake.

1748149,4,B00006FI0S,"In 2001, director James Isaac had given horror fans around the world, a new upgrade in horror: Jason X, the tenth installment to the Friday The 13th franchise.

  Taking place in the year 2010, a beautiful young woman named, Rowan (played by Lexa Doig) works for the Camp Crystal Lake Research Facility. The facility has hold of Jason Voorhees (again played by Kane Hodder). Jason is still alive. He was resurrected actually in Freddy Vs. Jason, which supposedly takes place before this film. The facility has tried killing Jason, but they had failed each time. So, they figured that they could freeze and contain him until the can figure out a way to kill him for good. But Rowan's supervisor is all too concerned with money and decides to keep him alive, but Jason kills him off and chases Rowan. Rowan runs into the cryogenic area and waits for Jason. He shows up, where Rowan locks him in the cryotube, readying him for freezing. But Jason stabs the cryo door, poking his machete through the door, stabbing Rowan. The cryogenic room locks Rowan inside, as the freezing mist freezes both Rowan and Jason.

  In the year of 2455, just 445 years after Rowan was cryogenically frozen with Jason, a team of college students, including Adrienne (played by Kristi Angus), Janessa (played by Melyssa Ade), Waylander (played by Derwin Jordan), Azrael (played by Dov Tiefenbach), Stony (played by Yani Gellman), Kinsa (played by Melody Johnson), and Tsunaron (played by Chuck Campbell) enter the cryogenic tube and find Jason's body. Accompanying the students are their college professor by the name of Prof. Lowe (played by Jonathan Potts) and Kay-Em (played Lisa Ryder), Tsunaron's hand built Android. They find Rowan's body as well. They take both Jason and Rowan, and they plan to recreate Rowan, since the cryotube preserved her perfectly. They leave Earth, since the planet has been destroyed and head for Earth 2. They successfully recreate Rowan. She meets the whole gang, as Jason is suddenly resurrected and kills off Adrienne, Azrael, and Stony are killed off. Prof. Lowe hires Sgt. Brodski and his combat team to kill Jason, but he kills of each and every team member, except Brodski. Prof. Lowe and Brodski take the remaining kids to safety, but Jason finds them and kills off Prof. Lowe.

  Tsunaron, Kay-Em, Rowan, Kinsa, Waylander, Janessa, and Brodski are the only ones left to battle Jason. Kay-Em seemingly destroys Jason, by blowing 85% of his head off. They then try to find a rescue ship that can take everyone to Earth 2, but Jason has a little upgrade and is brought back again to finish what he started. With a new look, he kills off Janessa, Waylander, and Kinsa. Leaving Rowan, Kay-Em, Brodski, and Tsunaron. A rescue ship arrives and attaches itself to the kids' entrance, letting them enter the rescue ship, but the doors won't open. Brodski goes outside to fix the electric works, as Rowan does so from the inside. They fix the doors and head into the rescue ship, as Jason appears outside and battles Brodski. As Tsunaron, Rowan, and Kay-Em head to Earth 2 in the rescue ship, Jason flies down really fast onto Earth 2 after killing Brodski. Jason's mask falls down into a new version of Crystal Lake, claiming that Jason is dead. Jason is dead. Or isn't he?

  Now, this film wasn't bad, but I was disappointed in the futuristic special effects, since I am so used to seeing these films take place in the 20th century and in camp grounds. But it is not a bad follow-up.",1108857600,,3495,4.777777777777778

All i hear is people complaining about how jason is in space and all that crap. Well there's allready 9 Jason movies, so the development team had to think of something quick to tide fans over before FreddyVSJason was to arrive.

In short, this film is a good addition to any slasher film fanatic's collection. It never takes itself seriously which is actually a good thing (do people even get scared of Jason anymore?lol). It provides the audience with some eye candy special effects, some GREAT gore scenes, and some eye candy boobies.

Definately a ""no brainer"" type of film. Is it a good movie? Nope. Is it an entertaining and gory flick you can sit back and enjoy on one of those lazy sunday afternoons? Oh heck yeah.

I'm giving it 4 stars because even as a huge horror fan and Jason fan, i think the whole ""oooh, i'm in space"" type thing is pretty retarded. But then again, like i mentioned at the beggining of this, the development team had to do something new.

There is somewhat of a plot here, but FF13th is not about story, or characters for that matter. It's just about Jason hacking up a bunch of teenagers in outer space. When compared with the other films, the gore effects in FF13th pt. 1 and pt. 2 were better done and more imaginative. It's pretty dry on the nudity and sex and it proves that stupid teens are still dumb despite the technology.
The main problem that I had was with this film was that they were overly involved in the plot and passed on any explanation of anything. When watching this there are temptations to try and relate it to Alien, but that is a poor comparison. Actually, if they took the plot from Alien and put Jason in it's place maybe it would have been a better film. Considering that it's a rehash of FF13th, it would better just to rent the first three and watch them instead of this. There is less plot to get in the way of the fun, the teens are only slightly dumber, and the kills are far better.",1107561600,2,1094,4.214285714285714
1748152,3,B00006FI0S,"Though this movie still has Jason at his best, here are the things I find wrong with this movie:

1. Hockey is outlawed in 2024, probably because of Jason's relations to it.

2. The humor, sex scenes, and such are no different than in this current time period (such a surprise).

3. The time when Jason is in the lab defrosting switches for no reason at all to two people in the middle of a 20th century intercourse.

4. The ""Lovebot"" looks like a ravaged Cosmopolitan model.

5. Jason simply shouldn't have hair, no matter what ""body repairs"" he can do to himself!

6. They talk about getting ""beamed off"" the ship after the professor is killed--unacceptable for the new time period!

Now that that summary is over, I must give the film credit for never failing to carry on Friday traditions such as the unmasking scene, the nothing-but-dispatching scene, and the assurance that there will have to be a continuation.

So, while it's not the best, it shows us that anything could happen today or tomorrow.",1107561600,2,1005,4.638418079096045

""Jason X"" is the best of them.  I actively enjoyed this film ... so much so that I just purchased the DVD at Amazon.

First, the premise is solid, even if it has been done before.  Jason's retrofit is plausible -- well, maybe not plausible, but you know what I mean -- and scary.

Second, there are many in-jokes, like David Cronenberg getting the shaft early.  Similarly, there's a clear homage to Cameron's masterpiece ""Aliens"" going on, and it really does feel like an homage, rather than like a rip-off.  The screenwriter didn't manage to match the effortless banter between the Colonial Marines in ""Aliens,"" but then again, neither has anyone else.

Third, the special effects are decent.  Not just the gore, but all of the science fiction trappings are pretty good.  I especially liked some of the throwaway shots, like a piece of tumbling space-debris that reads, ""Lunar Estates ... if you lived here, you'd be home now.""

Fourth, the directing and acting are actually pretty good.  By far the best of the movies.  That's not saying a whole helluva lot, but it is what it is.  Lexa Doig is a very good screamer.

Fifth, and speaking of Lexa Doig, I only wish I had first-hand experience with her as a screamer.  She is one of the most beautiful women alive, no question.

Unfortunately, I can't speak to how scary the film is, since I don't find slasher flicks scary in the least, but I imagine it's about like the others in that regard.

However, the movie does have its good points and I'm going to try to concentrate on a few of those in addition to its shortcomings.

  Jason's new look Is very impressive, although I wish they could have come up with at least a semi-credible way of having him arrive at it.  Either that or don't explain at all, just have the movie start out in the future with him already in this incarnation, drop a couple of ambiguious hints, and let viewers come up with something in their own minds to explain it.  Unlike a lot of people, I don't mind the general idea of setting this way in the future and transferring Jason into space; it was from the get-go a risky manuever that could easily have turned out accidentally campy, but if they wanted to try it I say give it a go.  It turns out accidentally campy wasn't a problem because campy (to the extreme) is exactly what the filmmakers were going for.  On going for a self-parody, I can't really judge how well they succeeded; you'd have to ask someone who enjoys horror spoofs like ""Scream"" or ""scary Movie"" to get an insight on that; it may well be that many fans of that style would enjoy ""Jason X"" a great deal too, both fans who also liked the ""Friday the 13th""s and those who didn't.

  Back on the plus side - the Fridays have always excelled in having very beautiful girls in its entries, and here at least ""Jason X"" steps up to the plate well.  Quite apart from looks, many of the characters are quite likeable (both female and male) and a number of the performers are quite talented, especially considering they didn't have the best material to work with (in my opinion).  I was very impressed by the Melissa Ade performance; judging by the way her character was scripted she maybe shouldn't have come off as particularly memorable (sure, she was hot but so were all the female performers) but something about her voice and quirky facial expressions charmed me.  I also liked the female android, whose 'android-trying-to-seem-more-human' moments, while nothing new in futuristic movies, gave the show some much-needed charm.  Kane Hodder as Jason Voorhees does the best possible job any thespian alive or dead could have done with what he had to work with, and against all odds sometimes actually manages to make Jason the valid danger he is in the other films.  I would have liked to have seen a number of people - characters/performers alike - lifted out of this and transplanted into a whole different ""Friday The 13th"" where their potential could have been better realized.  Something else - this may seem like a small point, but Jason X needs all the pluses it can get - I really liked the costume design on the female outfits.  They weren't even any more revealing than normal clothes, they just looked neat and like something somebody might actually wear some time in the future.  Not radically different but different enough so they're not dressed exactly the same as people in modern times.  Like I said, it might seem minor, but...

  The ending is, I'm sorry, just plain ridiculous - it's like something out of ""The Naked Gun"" but more absurb.  But I guess that's what they were going for.  A 'hologram' scene in the latter portions of the movie, without giving anything away, could have been profound and actually added to the Jason character instead of detracting from it like almost the entire rest of the film.  In fact it strode right up to the line of impressiveness and even briefly crossed it, before backtreading and returning to farcical territory.

  I hope this isn't all too harsh.  Spoof fans or casual Friday fans might like this, and if you're a deep Friday fan you'll probably want to see it anyway.  I'd been warned that this was pretty campy, but nothing was going to stop me from giving it a try anyway.  Although there's nothing average about this - parts are really good, and others...not, but nothing in the middle. Nevertheless on a ten-point scale I'd probably be generous and give this a five or at least 4.5  On a five-star system though it's either 3 stars or 2, and 3 stars would be the same rating I gave ""FridayThe 13th Part 3"" and ""Jason Takes Manhattan"", which I thought were clearly better than this, so 2 stars it is.  Sorry.  I do acknowledge the movie's good points though.",1098921600,,4626,4.537997587454765

After he rampages for a little while, he goes into a room with an upgrading machine to ""take a 'lil nap,"" as he says in the movie.  Somehow, the upgrading machine turns on and out comes Jason, covered in metal like EVERYTHING in the future.  He kills more people, falls to earth (right by Crystal Lake, actually) and, predictably, doesn't die...he does skin his knee a little though.

1748213,4,B00006FI0S,"This, the tenth film in the apparently infinite Friday the 13th franchise, gives us what so many satirists have expected for years...Jason in Space.

As slasher films go, this one is actually pretty cool. The irrepressible Mr. Voorhees is frozen in suspended animation with his last victim (after slaughtering a cameo present David Cronenberg, no less). A century later, they are both unthawed by a team of students researching our version of Earth (due to inhospitable environmental conditions these students and their teacher now reside on ""Earth 2""), and before you can say ""machete"", everyone's favorite hockey masked zombie is back in action.

This is cinema fluff to be sure..a simple throwaway intended to fill the coffers of New Line Cinemas, who purchased the rights to this character from Paramount a decade earlier, but its a fun movie nonetheless. The visuals are excellent, and there are many amusing and equally horrific moments (a death by way of liquid nitrogen is particularly memorable, as is a virtual reality recreation of the original Crystal Lake..a scene peppered with some genuinely terrific in-joke dialouge).

While this certainly will never qualify for a ""best-of"" category on any of the AFI lists, ""Jason X' is a fine addition to a series that had nowhere else to go. Bravo to all involved for bothering to inject some life and humor into this franchise. Besides, the uber Jason is worth the price of a rental alone.

SIDENOTE: interestingly..the tone set by ""Jason X"" is a legitimate precursor to the same feel that was established by the subsequent outing  ""Freddy vs Jason.""  If you've seen ""FvJ"" and disliked it,but have not watched ""Jason X"", then I advise you to steer clear of the latter. However, if you enjoyed ""FvJ"" (as I admittedly did), then by all means, watch ""Jason X"" as soon as possible. You won't be dissapointed.",1098489600,,1859,4.980645161290322

1748256,4,B00006FI0S,Jason x is a new generation of horror. This moive combines a futristic space movie with the old camp crystal lake killing movies.

Jason also takes on a new appearence that fits the ships enviroment i hope you all enjoy this movie becasue it is the first real horror movie I ever rented and i wonder where my life would be now if i hadn't.,1095292800,,517,4.18
1748257,1,B00006FI0S,"I'm a fan of the Friday The 13th franchise, but Jason X is by far the worst in the series.  I mean, it's the tenth in the series, so what more do you want?  The whole camp thing was getting old.  It's nice to see that they were trying to go in a different direction, but it just wasn't pulled off right.

The year is 2455.  An archeology class is visiting the remains of the Crystal Lake Research Facility on Earth, which has been abandoned for centuries.  They discover two cryogenically frozen bodies.  One belongs to a woman who worked there, named Rowan (Lexa Doig).  The other is the now-509-year-old rotted corpse of Jason Voorhees, still clinging on to his beloved machete.  This leaves the crew asking one question: ""How does he function with a brain that small?""

Kane Hodder is back again as Jason, for the fourth time in a row.  He is the only person to play Jason more than once.  He also plays the upgraded Uber-Jason, which was pretty stupid.  I'd rather have old Jason any day.  Either way, Hodder is the best part about this movie.

The plot sounds kind of interesting at first, but as the saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words.  Seven people get killed in less than five minutes from the movie's start.  Sounds like a good begining, right?  Well, it all goes down hill from there.

There are a couple cool kills in this movie and the body count (twenty-eight) is high.  However, more kills doesn't mean that it's a better movie.  There is one really creative kill that is probably the best scene in the movie, but other than that, nothing is really memorable.  The only other good scene is during a virtual sequence, when Jason is on Earth at Camp Crystal Lake, but it doesn't last long.

The view of the future portrayed in the film was pretty lame.  Earth being uninhabitable in less than five-hundred years?  More importantly, Earth 2?!  Also, a lot of the computer effects looked very fake for a film made in 2002.  Another con is that there is hardly any character developement.

Jason X was basically made for the sole purpose of making more money.  Freddy Vs. Jason was already in production while this was being made, so they couldn't make a direct sequel to Jason Goes To Hell: The Final Friday.  This is why the storyline completely avoids the fact that the previous movie existed.

New Line has been trying new things since they bought the rights to the franchise, which is nice for an interesting change, but this movie was just a miss.  It had too much of a sci-fi feel to it for my liking, and that took away from the horror theme.  Jason Goes To Hell had an decent good plot, so it worked out.. whereas this is like a cheesey combination of Alien, Terminator, and Star Trek.

I would only recommend this movie to completists, like myself, who have to see the entire series (although it has little to do with the other movies, except for the fact it's still Jason killing people).  All in all, I think the entire movie can be summed up by one of Tanessa's (Melyssa Ade) lines: ""This sucks on so many levels!""",1094428800,7,3050,4.473684210526316

1748259,4,B00006FI0S,"""Uh, Jason has gone into space, my favorite horror series is definitely doomed!""  That was my true opinion as I stood in a very short line to see this movie on opening night.  Fortunately for me (and I'm sure for New Line), I left this movie with a newfound hope for this seemingly dieing franchise (no pun intended).  Jason X definitely follows the successful equation to this series while still bringing it up to date (although I still think space was too far)!

Jason is finally captured somewhere around the year 2010 (which in the timeline of his movies means that the average human ages five times faster than normal) and frozen in a containment unit to never be heard from again.  Then sometime in the mid 2400's (2455 I believe) an expedition of ""Earth 1"" puts a group of young researchers discovering our frozen mass murderer.  As they thaw him out, Jason proves himself to be very much alive.  Once the killing start, it never ends in this new and (almost) improved addition to the Friday the 13th Series!

This movie brought back Jason (played still by Kane Hodder) to do the killing, which immediately made it twice as good as Jason Goes To Hell in my book!  The death scenes are still inventive (even if they are a little far fetched) and gory as ever!  The fact that it's in the future and in space doesn't really make the plot that cheesy and by the end of the movie they set it up so that Jason can go back to his roots in future movies (however I'm pretty sure he'll only be doing battle with rival movie franchises from now on).  The characters are decently developed for any movie, let alone a Jason film, and they really did go with a decent budget.  The acting is pretty decent as well and save that wierd looking guy who loses his arm in the beginning, the cast is also pretty decent looking as well (especially the young ladies).

This DVD delivers just like New Line's other release, only this time it was much more redeeming because this movie was much better.  We don't get any cut scenes or unrated edition, but I think that's because there really weren't any.  The specials seemed interesting, but they were a little boring to me (however for non-avid Jason fans the information may be more new and interesting).  I loved the surround sound formats with a 5.1 DTS, 6.1 Dolby-Ex, and 2.0 for those without surround sound.  All in all, this DVD is worth picking up because it's a good update of the series, a great DVD packed with worthwhile features, and Uber-Jason is a sight to see!",1092096000,,2511,4.495594713656388
1748260,4,B00006FI0S,"The colors and lighting in this DVD are quite good.  No negative comment to make on that, and I never comment on the sound system because I don't have a good sound system at home to really judge it.

However, I can comment on the DVD extras, which were quite good.  There is a fascinating 30-minute-or-so documentary about the entire Friday the 13th legacy.  That would be extremely enjoyable for any Friday fan to watch, casual or hardcore Jason freak.  There is also a commentary that is entertaining to listen to.

As far as the movie goes, it's a fun flick.  I find it entertaining that Lexa Doig, who plays Rowan, the heroine, is playing a human while Lisa Ryder plays KM-14, an android, while on Andromeda, Lisa Ryder plays a human and Lexa Doig plays an android/ship/etc.  But that has no bearing on this film.  I just find that interesting.

Good special effects, although hardcore Jason fans may be quite disappointed by Uber Jason who shows up near the end of the film.  It made it a bit more comic-book-y than it perhaps should have been, but if you can put everything else aside, seeing a super Jason is kind of cool.

This film also has some great references to previous Friday fans in a ""holodeck"" spoof of two topless girls who use every horror movie cliche in the Friday the 13th bible.",1091836800,,1302,4.517094017094017

1748324,2,B00006FI0S,"I used to like this movie. I remember seeing Jason X in theaters 2 years ago and actually enjoying it (If you want, you can go check out a review I made 2 yrs ago for this movie. It is titled ""He's back and better then ever""-4 stars, 29 July 2002). I liked Jason X so much that I bought it right away when it came on DVD. I thought this was pretty good. After all, it does have good kills, decent action, and certainly is not the worst in the series. However, now being 2 years, I have come to realize that this movie is not all that great. I used to think that the reason why this film had gotten so many bad reviews was because nobody ever gave it a chance. I thought if people just accepted the idea of Jason in space, they could like this movie. However, now I have realized that the reason why this movie was so negatively reviewed was not because people do not give it a chance, it is because it just simply a bad movie. What is up with this movie anyway, why was even made in the first place? It had nothing to do with the f13 series in anyway besides having the character Jason in it. It totally ignores the rest of the films, nor makes any reference to them at all. New Line was already having a good Jason movie in the works; Freddy vs. Jason (which is one AWESOME flick!!), so why make this wannabe Friday the 13th movie? Were they just trying to make money because I highly doubt that was case. This movie seriously had bombed at the box office, it also known to be one of the worst films of 2002. So New Line probably lost money for making this film. Were they just trying to get Jason back on the big screen? If that was so, they should have just waited one year more till they released Freddy vs. Jason. Even if they were too impatient about getting Jason back in theaters, they should have went with a better story line. Why Jason in space, did they just want to try something different? Correct me if I am wrong, but did not New Line already try something different with the Jason Voorhees character in a movie called Jason Goes to Hell, and wasn't not so good either. The bottom line is that is just one completely random movie with Jason and New Line cinema should not have wasted their time making this movie. Here is the plot.
Jason Voorhees (Kane Hodder) is now a prisoner in a laboratory where scientists test experiments on him to find out why he never dies. It has been decided that Jason should be cryogenically frozen till anybody else can figure out what do with him. But of course things go wrong, Jason starts to escape and kills anyone in sight. The only person who he had not killed was a woman named Rowan (Lexa Doig) who had managed to get him trapped in the cryogenic freezer. However, she had gotten hurt in the process and also got frozen.
4.5 centuries later in the year 2455, earth is now a place that cannot sustain human life. Humans now live on ""Earth II"". A team of students exploring the remains of old earth discovered them both and bring them both on their ship. They were able to bring Rowan back to life but they concluded it was impossible to bring Jason back to life. They have no idea that Jason is a psychopathic killer. However, what they don't know is that Jason's body is regenerating on its own and Jason soon comes back o life. Now everybody on the ship find themselves running for lives.
I used to think any f13 fan will like this film if they give it a chance, but now I have realized any TRUE F13 fan will see that Jason X is a disgrace to the Friday the 13th series. Sure there are a few F13 flicks that were worse then this (Friday the 13th parts 5 and 8 come to mind) but at least they had something to do with the series. Sure Jason X does have some good qualities. They're quite a few good death scenes. Some of the chicks were pretty hot. Plus Uber-Jason looked really cool. However, Jason is not supposed to look like that. The hockey mask should have been kept throughout the entire movie because that is the true Jason. Besides those few good qualities, Jason X is not worthy of being an F13 flick. I am glad Freddy vs. Jason ignores this film.  Do not buy this movie. I now seriously regret that I own it and I'll do anything to get rid of it. If you want to see this film, please just rent it.",1088294400,5,4264,4.2
1748325,4,B00006FI0S,"By many standards, even for the slasher film, Jason X sounds questionable.  A part ten, of any series.  Set in space(!)  A long break from the previous films.
Yet, Jason X is easily one of the best Friday sequels, period.  The movie is fun.  The attitude is consistent, and it's contagious.  The filmmakers were having fun, they're doing a movie for the fans, and everyone wins.
This is easily one of the best Friday DVDs; actually, it is the best, even better than the 2-disc Freddy vs. Jason.  For one, there are two documentaries that go a long way toward framing the film as a fun exercise by series fans, for series fans.
For obvious reasons, the 'traditional' slasher film can no longer be made, having been done so many times with such minimal effort (including several Friday sequels), as well as spoofed and spiced up (the Scream films).  A healthy dose of self-reflexivity and some other elements are needed to make the formula watchable.  Jason X is also a kind of one-off in the series; since it's mostly set in the future, it hardly fudges the 'continuity' of the series, which is largely incoherent by now anyway.  They've got free reign to do whatever and have a ball with it.
Hundreds of years in the future, high school students from Earth 2 come across the cryogenically frozen body of Jason Voorhees along with an injured female.  Using `nanotechnology' (the newest buzz technology for sci-fi and video games), they thaw them out and 'reconstitute' them.  The female protagonist remembers she was overseeing the 'handing over' of Jason to military for experiments since it was impossible to execute him (a funny bit of dialogue).  Of course, it's not long before Jason is up to his old tricks, dispatching hapless students and 'Aliens'-tough Marine grunts on the ship (named Grendel, of course).
The film really works on its own terms as a low budget but stylish, whimsical continuation of a series that ran out of gas a while back (witness the nadir, Jason Takes Manhattan).  The director is Jim Isaac, who has a great background for this stuff since he was an effects man on several of David Cronenberg's films, and Cronenberg himself has a cameo in the beginning.  The film is low budget but stylish; the lighting is pleasant and creatively colors the sets to look like more than they are.  The acting is often hammy, but those involved (especially the scientist) seem to be having a good time.  Harry Manfredini does the score, and it's his first Friday score ever released on CD, and for good reason.  For one, it's pretty damn good.  The earlier Friday films (up to V) featured recycled cues from the previous films.  Parts VI and VII featured more proper, expansive scores (still very servile to the genre, of course).  Jason X has plenty of different elements ranging from traditional 'stalking' music, to action cues, to cheesy, triumphant, space music, to eerie suspense.  It's a great disc for fans, and does hold up on its own.
As for Jason, Kane Hodder is back and clearly loves his role.  Just watch him in the documentaries, he likes playing Jason, he loves the stunts (his original vocation) and he loves the whole fan boy element of these films.  There's also plenty of gore.  The MPAA butchered most of the Friday films, after the original became a hit and a backlash began because of the gore.  Not the case here, so we're treated to at least two of the best Friday kills ever: the liquid nitrogen bit, and the giant screw(!)  Of course, the film is not scary.  It's a hybrid of horror, sci-fi, action, and comedy, very aware of its own cheese.
Again, the DVD is excellent.  The film looks and sounds great, with a good commentary by the director, writer, and producer.  There's a trailer, two docs, and a particularly demented 'Jump to a Death' feature.  Perhaps Paramount, owners of the first eight Friday flicks, will get the hint and put out some decent DVDs of those films.",1087948800,,3916,4.706314243759178

Ultimately, the movie is a waste of time, and it is certainly not a serious horror film.

Basically, it is watchable, but one has got to see the farce of it, or I would start worrying about that IQ level.

Many reviewers here say that this film is only for fans of the series, but I'd like to know exactly which series they're talking about because I'm a fan of the FRIDAY THE 13TH series and I certainly did not enjoy this horrendous film. I'm a huge horror film fan and I've stood by this series through thick and thin and have defended many of the films in discussions, but I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy. I never thought I'd say it, but I'd rather watch Jason stalk the streets of Manhattan than watch him embark on a killing spree in a space ship several hundred years in the future! The problem that I have with the story is that it makes no sense. After the original film, Jason was supposed to stalk campers and counselors in and around Crystal Lake. The series began to stretch a little too thin when in the eight and ninth films he took Manhattan and then went to Hell, but entering into space and killing people aboard a ship!?! Come on, what's the point?
Bottom line: This film is an absolute senseless piece of garbage that was completely unengaging and was an insult to the series. I found only 60 seconds of this film to be enjoyable-- when, during a virtual sequence, Jason had returned to Crystal Lake, on Earth, in the present time.

The special effex are very well done, and the use of holograms is neat and different.  It just seems that they haven't improved much in the casting department; most of the victims were people we never got to know, so their deaths were rather meaningless.  Lisa Ryder as the android was lively and an asset to the cast; David Cronenberg's cameo is effective.  Jonathan Potts as Professor Lowe was too hammy without ever being threatening, as Paul Reiser was in Aliens.  They needed somebody like Bruce Dern or Bill Paxton.  Anyway, there's little new in this movie, Jason runs around killing people and the end has two or three climaxes.

1748333,4,B00006FI0S,"Jason certainly isn't a great movie when considering the overall movie entertainment industry output.  However, for fans of the genre, it has more than enough to hold your interest.
I saw Parts I through III during their original release at theaters, but I hadn't seen any of the sequels since.  I rented this on a whim to see in anything had changed.  While the general theme remains intact--Jason slices and dices a group of young adults--this movie certainly throws a lot at the viewer.  You've got cryonics, nanotechnology, space travel, androids, and holodecks.
The makers of the film obviously spent a great deal of money in putting it together.  The special effects are pretty convincing and the sets are reasonably impressive.  The acting is what you would expect in the series.  Still, I found the KM android character, played by Lisa Ryder of Andromeda and Forever Knight fame, to be endearing.  I especially liked the gleeful, and throughly macho, manner in which she dispatches the original Jason.  Kane Hodder was...well...Kane Hodder.
I know traditionalists didn't like Jason's uber look after the nanites got ahold of him, but I rather liked it.  The makeup and suit were visually impressive.  I also liked the soundtrack.  The music meshed quite well with story and flow.

Really, I enjoyed the film, but it shouldn't be something anyone puts a lot of thought into. It's fun, mindless and entertaining. Nuff said. If you like sci-fi and horror this film is great. It's no Aliens, but come on, what is?
The other funny thing was one reviewers comments on not wasting your money on this film and getting a good film like Freddy vs Jason instead. Strangely enough, I can't tell the difference. They're exactly the same type of film. If you can accept people coming back in dreams and from the grave/hell then why can't you accept them existing in the future? Bizarre. I guess if you don't like sci-fi AT ALL, don't watch this, but otherwise, don't miss it, it's a lot of fun.",1081641600,,830,4.54

1748370,4,B00006FI0S,"There are those fans that want a slasher movie where Jason just hacks people up, and those fans that enjoy seeing the traditional slasher film (you know, the one that's been done nine other times already) with a new twist. Jason Goes to Hell was a throw away attempt that was semi-successful in its creativity. This time, Jason X gets a juiced up budget and a serious attempt at doing something new with everybody's favorite hockey masked serial killer.

It's telling that Jason X doesn't have Friday the 13th in the title. Jason's killings were only loosely connected to Friday the 13th anyway. Now, Jason has taken his rightful throne as the lead character. This movie is for fans that like Jason.

Just as Jason Goes to Hell took the ludicrous and made it sane by having a SWAT team blow Jason away in a trap, Jason X does the reverse: Jason has been captured, a logical outcome given that the government is aware of him, and sentenced to death. But he doesn't die.

Thus, two different government factions attempt to deal with Jason in their own way. One group, at the Crystal Lake Cryogenics Facility, wants to freeze him and ""shelve him away."" The other group, led by the military, want to examine Jason for his regenerative capabilities. Of course, the government gets the upper hand and Jason escapes, only to be locked into cryogenic hibernation Rowan. But Jason is unstoppable and manages to shove his machete through the steel door, wounding Rowan and causing a leak that cryogenically freezes her as well.

In 2455, the Earth has gone to crap. Exploring this barren wasteland are an archeologist and his class of attractive students, who discover Jason and Rowan and bring them back aboard their ship. Using nanite technology, they revive Rowan. Using Jason technology, he revives himself.

Slice, kill, repeat.

By moving Jason into space and using futuristic technology, there's a lot more possibilities to spice up the film. In fact, there are so many possibilities that the movie turns into a parody of Alien, right down to the EX-Grunts (Colonial Marines) and oily bureaucrat who wants to sell his find to get rich. If you're going to mimic a horror movie in space, Alien is the one to copy.

The EX-Grunts die first, then the adults, then the students. Along the way, we see more nanite technology in action, witness a female andriod's nipples fall off, see a holodeck in action (like Star Trek: The Next Generation), watch really big guns have no effect on Jason, and see spaceships crash into each other.

By far the most hilarious part of the movie is when the resident techie uses the holodeck to slow Jason down by creating an illusionary Camp Crystal Lake, complete with two naked teenage girls who proclaim ""we love pre-marital sex!"" as they climb into their sleeping bags. You know what happens next...

Ultimately, Jason gets an upgrade, when nanite technology rebuilds him into a bigger, stronger, nastier version of himself. And then he falls through the atmosphere into Earth 2. And you know what happens next...

I haven't seen all the Jason films, but I do know that they long stopped being scary and turned into campy fun at least around Jason Goes to Hell. Jason X is no different, with humorous nods to the genre and homage to Alien. The only movie that has more fun than Jason X is Freddy vs. Jason. If you're a fan of Friday the 13th or a fan of Alien, it's well worth the rental.",1079913600,2,3417,4.698996655518394

1748372,1,B00006FI0S,"""New Line Cinema"" continues to beat this series like a wounded dog & the fat lady is still singing. For anyone who cares, Jason is finally captured by the U.S. Government and is under biological study for his superhuman recuperative healing abilities. Jason, the big mouth that he is, has his say by killing all the guards and agents in the room. A female agent, however, lures Jason into a cryogenic freezing chamber & tries to freeze him. Of course this doesn't fit well with old hockeypuck and as he tries to break out of the chamber the room goes into automatic lockdown freezing everything in the room including the female agent and Big J. Fast forward to the year 4255. A group of high school students on a galactic field trip find the frigid female and the Jason-sicle intact. Things turn grim when its decided that both ""specimens"" should be brought back to their starship and thawed out for examination.
This installment has the most special effects in any of the previous ""Friday the 13th""'s  but, the film as a whole just plain sucks. No character developement (like there was any in any of the earlier films with the exception of say, ""Friday the 13th Part 3-D"", where Jason donned his hockey mask). The last half of ""Jason X"" is just plain ludicrous (Uber-Jason?!, come on, people) The problem with the ""Friday"" films is this - with all the sequels & all the imitations (""Nightmare on Elm Street"", ""Hellraiser"", ""Scream"", ""Cabin Fever"", etc.) it gets harder and harder to make a scary film. Because, its all formualic (kids go to destination to get layed, high, whatever + killer on the loose + gruesome deaths - character developement + scary ending = original ""Friday the 13th""). In other words the films are getting old & some not all (""Friday the 13th"",  & ""Halloween"" are still great movies) do not stand the test of time. However, this film shouldn't have been given a chance. Avoid like a scorching, chaffing case of V.D.",1078358400,15,1941,4.689149560117302
1748373,2,B00006FI0S,"Popular bogeymen Jason Vorhees terrorizes a group of nubile astronauts five centuries into the future in this sci-fi update of the Friday the 13th franchise. Early in the 21st century, Jason (actor/stunt man Kane Hodder, filling the role for a fourth time) is experimented upon by army technocrats who hope to turn his supernatural invulnerability into a military application. Most of them meet a swift and bloody end -- except Rowan (Lexa Doig), a beautiful functionary, who traps the killer in a cryogenic stasis chamber. Unfortunately, she takes a machete blow in the process, gets frozen herself, and wakes up on a spaceship in the year 2455. The earth has long since been rendered uninhabitable, but the survivors include a group of archaeological students headed by Professor Lowe (Jonathan Potts), who hopes to make a quick buck by selling the corpse of the historical serial killer. The kids re-animate Rowan with the help of nanotechnology. Little do they know that a mere thaw job is enough to resuscitate Jason and reawaken his bloodthirst. Soon, the comely students and their space-marine protectors are being dispatched one by one. Help arrives in the form of a holographic chamber and an android named Kay-Em 14 (Lisa Ryder). Soon, though, Jason himself gets an upgrade -- just as the spaceship is getting ready to self-destruct. Try on another ""Friday the 13th"" flick for fun, this one is simply a pathedic attemt to make more cash. Don't be fooled, this entry is terrible.

The deaths are very well done, but I'd of killed them a lot more gruesomely.  You have the MPAA to thank for not having extremely gory films nowadays.  This title is great to add to your collection to watch with friends or just see some dumb teens and adults getting killed.  Why ain't that fun?  Pop some popcorn and sit back with your friends and/or your girl/man and just watch the blood fly.  I felt great after this.

1748425,3,B00006FI0S,"Collectivly, I'd like us all for a moment to reflect on the irony that the very minute this franchise stopped taking itself so seriously, we get two wildly entertaining movies in 'Jason X' and 'Freddy vs Jason.'
Is this reinventing the wheel?  Oh god no, not by any stretch; but there's MORE then enough tongue-in-cheek humor to keep things entertaining.  Although it's extremely violent, I'd still probably argue that this is more of a satirical look at the ""Jason franchise"" then it is a horror movie.  You could tell the tone of the movie in the first ten minutes when director James Issac killed off David Cronenberg (Issac spent years as an assistant director and understudy to Cronenberg).
It's just a refreshing movie, it really feels like someone finally breathed a little life into what had been a horribly stale franchise that really had damn-near nothing left to offer.  The only drawback is that this seems to be a movie that was made for fans of the Friday the 13th series.  Some of the people I've spoken to, who weren't firmilar with the franchise, didn't really ""get"" a lot of the fun that was poked at the horror movie cliches that Jason help to establish.

It seems like the creative team behind this basically answered the question ""what would happen if you put Jason in the future, in space, with cutting-edge technology?"". Sometimes you almost forget you're watching a slasher movie (except for the kills, which are plentiful and fun). There are, inevitably, elements of the Alien movies threaded throughout the film, as well as nods to the franchise history.

As for the acting and awesomely bad dialog not to mention the  Alien franchise rip offs (ex.. Jason wasting well trained grunts while people listen in. Remeber Bill paxton in Aliens? Game over man.

One of the guys looked a lot like Laurence Fishburne and I thought he was until I found out he wasn't. Some people think that it's now just Jason on a spaceship but I find that this plot seemed like it wasn't really a Friday the 13th. For anybody that didn't know the X in Jason X means it's the tenth one. It's the longest horror series but there's a new Halloween coming out but Friday the 13th will still be the longest. I can see Jason getting boring but I have watched this movie three times in one week. The actors did a good job and the one girl actually took the dead guy's gun.

I think that because Pinnhead's final film took place in space, Producers in Hollywood thought Jason should go out with a bang by going to the stars as well. But at least the Pinnhead film had a backstory  to it that explained how he got to space.
""Jason X"" has no explination other than Jason got frozen.

I promise you, if you do those two things: turn the light off and keep an open mind, you will have a load of fun with this 10th installment of the legendary Friday the 13th saga.
Here are short reviews for the whole series:
Friday the 13th- 3rd best in the series.
Friday the 13th part 2- slow, but it has it's moments.
Friday the 13th part 3- pretty bad, but he gets hockey mask!
Friday the 13th part 4- 2nd best in the series.
Friday the 13th part 5- Best of all of them!
Friday the 13th part 6- Better than some...worthy sequel.
Friday the 13th part 7- Very bad. Telekinisis girl sucks. Why? I don't know.
Friday the 13th part 8- Worst in the series. Need I say more?
Friday the 13th part 9- Okay I guess, but it's still pretty low.
Jason X- 4th best in the series. FUN!
Freddy vs. Jason- Very good. Best slasher film in years.",1068163200,3,1522,4.127946127946128
1748553,5,B00006FI0S,a great movie for all horror movie fans. i always enjoyed horror movies but this is a very very cool movie. two thumbs way way up.,1067817600,,130,4.038461538461538
1748554,3,B00006FI0S,"I know that this was supposed to be scary, but it was really hillarious.  With tons of gratuitous violence and a little bit of plotline, this movie was pretty fun to watch.
The story of Jason is developed a little more, making the other nine installments a little better in retrospect.  There really wasn't too much in the way of suspense, just a lot of people getting chopped up and brutalized.  Of course, plenty of people fell down while trying to run away.
Sorry, I hope I didn't spoil it for you.",1067644800,,501,4.423913043478261
1748555,4,B00006FI0S,"Oh boy was this movie fun!  Jason X is the quintessential guilty pleasure; so campy, so cheesy, so absurd that it's damn cool.  Jason X was definitely made with the intention of satisfying the long-time fans, with plenty of homages and inside jokes. All the classic ""Friday"" signatures are back; references to Crystal Lake (now ""Crystal Lake research facility"", ha ha!), the trademark Jason music, and yes, plenty of horny, half-naked teenagers ready to get hacked by our favourite machete-wielding goalie.  The man himself, the indestructable Jason Vorhees is back in top form as the bad guy we all love to cheer on.
  The movie makes a very good choice in not taking itself seriously, and is deliberately cheesy to the extreme, almost to the point of being a parody of other Jason films, and of slasher films in general to a lesser extent.  However, in the end it worked for me.  I particularly enjoyed KM14, the sexy female android that dueled against Jason and had almost as much attitude as Vorhees himself.  (I said almost).
  The only thing that weighed Jason X down were the unforgiveable number of plot holes.  I could ignore a few, but the writers really pushed it with absurd events.  I mean, I know this isn't exactly Shakespeare, but give the audience some credit!  Why was the only rescue ship 4 parsecs away when ""Earth 2"" was right nearby?  Couldn't they have sent a rescue craft from Earth 2?  Also, the bionically enhanced Jason was NOT cool.  Fortunately we only had to endure it for the very end of the film, but the filmmakers need to realise that Jason Vorhees is only cool when he's ""practically"" invinicible; we like to see the bullets actually penetrate him, then watch him continue to walk towards his victim.  It's no fun with the bullets just bounce off him.  Give the teenagers some chance!
  Other than minor flaws, if you are a fan of the man in the hockey mask, you shan't be disappointed.  It's great, machete-hacking fun.  If you're not, just try to take the movie with a grain of salt, and enjoy the extreme cheesiness, and maybe you'll get it into the franchise too :-)
P.S.  Jason can whup Freddy any day of the week!  (Especially Friday)",1066521600,,2175,4.663157894736842
1748556,1,B00006FI0S,"I got bored easily with the crappy dialouge and the stupid killings. man this franchise has gone on way to long and when they bring Jason back with all metal and stuff. I just wanted to stop it and rewind it and bring it back right there. horribly directed. I mean the Freddy series is better then this hunk of dung. theres a couple in the series I like but that was way back when. obviously I thought where Jason went into the Crystal Lake reality and hit those 2 girls against the tree while they were in that sleeping bag, that was the only good part. fo people who don't have brains or the smart knowledge",1066089600,,609,4.213675213675214
1748557,2,B00006FI0S,"The Friday the 13th series clearly has it's moments.  Part 1 back in 1980 was a horror classic.  A few sequels with horny teens geting stalked by Jason were well done as well such as part 4 and 6.  Jason X is just too unrealistic.  Don't get me wrong I could understand that all Jason fans would really like this movie, but thr FT13 series killed it with the sequels.  I know atleast this did not take place in the woods , but Jason in a spaceship is like an alien series movie, with a killer on the loose in a spaceship.  It had horny teens making love in a spaceship rather than a cabin or tent.  It is a bloody movie just like the others with a lack of suspense.  Kane Hodder does a solid job playing Jason but these FT13 movies are the same old thing all the time, we have seen Jason kill in the woods many times but this time he just does it in a spaceship.  All Jason fans will still be entertained, but this movie is well not the worst of the series but one of the worst in the series.  Beleive me Part 1 and 6 are the two best of the series, all true Jason fans should watch this as part of the series which was dieng slowly untill Freddy battled Jason, the series will contine to live with a Freddy Vs. Jason Sequel Written all over it, especially if Jason also battles Michael Myers In a three way.",1065830400,,1308,4.054474708171206
1748558,5,B00006FI0S,"Unless gore scares you, Jason X is not frightening. I would label it as more of a bloody/action movie. It's highly enjoyable, of course. Lexa Doig (as Rowan) did a great job with her role and I really enjoyed Lisa Ryder's Kay-Em 14, my favorite of the whole crew.
Believe it or not, I have never seen ANY one of the Friday the 13th movies, yet I saw this one. I loved it so much, I had to buy it!
I really enjoyed Jason X. There's some comedy here and there. The dumbest scene in the movie would have to be the campers in the virtual sequence - so stupid. Oh well.
Use the Jump to a Death featurette and go to the two most sickening deaths in the movie: Adrienne's and Janessa's. A shattered skull and metal grating...eww. It doesn't show Janessa being sucked through the metal grating, but it sure is implied when you see some bloody pieces of her stuck on it. And Adrienne's death, well, you'll just have to SEE that one.
If you're a fan of the series, I recommend you see this one. Not a fan of the series? SEE IT ANYWAY!",1065398400,,1024,4.1767676767676765
1748559,4,B00006FI0S,"I haven't seen the other friday the 13th movies, but this one was great! At first I just wanted to see it because Lexa Doig and Lisa Ryder from Andromeda was in it (they're really good) but when I saw it, I absolutely loved the film. The only minus was that it was a bit too short and too much time was lost on Jason murdering different people. If you're sensitive about people getting killed in really nauseating ways you probably shouldn't see this movie, but I still think it rocks!",1063497600,,485,4.34065934065934
1748560,2,B00006FI0S,"I hate the Friday the 13th series with a passion, but I actually enjoyed this movie to a limited extent because it is really a spoof of the Jason movies and not a serious slasher film. I don't think that it would be possible to take this piece of junk seriously. I mean, come on! Look at the plot! The big smelly Jason Voorhes gets cryogenically frozen at Camp Crystal Lake and is discovered in the Star-Trek-like future, which seems to be populated by characters from the movie ""Aliens"". Jason reawakens when he is on a ship in outer space and starts killing people. Think of it as the Jetsons meets the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It's a comedy. At least, I think it is. The guy who thought up this movie probably sat down with the rest of the film crew and said ""Okay guys, we've made nine crappy Friday the Thirteenth movies that are really just the same thing over and over again, now what do we do? What the hell, let's send Jason to outer space!"" They spoofed all of the cliches from the earlier Jason flicks so that when people see this movie they'll say ""Well, at least they KNOW that their movie sucks.""
Overall, it isn't as funny as it is horrible. It isn't scary enough to be a real horror movie (actually it isn't scary at all), and it isn't quite corny enough to fall under the ""So bad it's good"" catagory.  But it does have some redeeming values: 1)It is funny at times, and 2)Hot chicks (which are a redeeming value in any movie). There are several very lovely ladies featured in this movie; my favorite was Kristi Angus (who gets killed early in the movie and should have had way more screen time. The scene where she dies is pretty cool, though). Of course, the humor and the hotties are not enough to save the film. There are only three good scenes in the entire movie: 1)When Jason first wakes up, he grabs a cute female doctor by the hair, freezes her face in liquid nitrogen, and then smashes it on a counter. 2)The scene in witch Jason gets his butt kicked by a robot. 3)A hilarious scene where Jason finds himself in a VR Camp Crystal Lake. Besides these really cool scenes, there is hardly anything worth watching. In fact, you could fast forward to the face smashing scene and then fast forward to the robot scene, and then to the VR scene and you wouldn't miss anything good. Take my word for it, unless you are one of those Jason fanatics who is so in love with the crusty zombie that you have to see everything he does. This movie is definitely worth taking a look at if you are in the mood for something stupid, but not buying on DVD.",1062892800,,2561,4.335416666666666

1748592,4,B00006FI0S,"Yet another entry in the hoary ""Friday the 13th"" series, ""Jason X"" really had nowhere to go except up-to space, that is. After sending our hockey masked anti-hero to New York and the underworld, the individuals who own the rights to this franchise decided to send Jason four hundred years into the future so he can wreak havoc on a whole new crop of young airheads. As I watched this movie, I couldn't help but think how far this franchise has gone in its twenty-three years of existence. Who among us would have thought that a low budget film about a killer at a summer camp would achieve such longevity? Moreover, that it would encompass such bizarre plot elements as sending a killer into space? O.K., they did give us Leprechaun and Hellraiser in space, but still-JASON? Sheesh.
You know before even sitting down to ""Jason X"" that there's going to be a mess of killings. That's a given. What I look for in new ""Friday the 13th"" films concerns imaginative plotlines. How are they going to pull this off and still make it interesting? Several entries in the series became so tedious that watching them is a titanic struggle to avoid looking at your watch. Remember the one with Corey Feldman in it? That's one of my greatest fears while watching a Jason movie: child stars. I'll probably hang up the towel for good if I see one with Todd Bridges or Adam Rich fighting the masked crusader of carnage. Well, ""Jason X"" managed to hold my attention; it even attained a level of ""goodness"" not seen for some time. Sure, the dialogue still sent up waves of unpleasant odors, but the ladies never looked better and the special effects and techniques used to film this movie make this title the slickest looking entry in the franchise. One of the best things about ""Jason X"" is that it obliterated that age-old groan about why the people stalked by the killer just don't leave when confronted by danger. Well, they can't leave here because they're on a space ship! There isn't anywhere to go.
In the year 2455, a team of archeology students leaves ""Earth 2"" on a mission to recover valuables from the decimated planet Earth. They just happen to land at Camp Crystal Lake, where they find the remains of a research facility loaded with all types of goodies. One of the discoveries is Jason Voorhees, still holding a machete while preserved in a cryogenic tank. The team also discovers a young woman safely frozen as well, although this person has a stab wound in her abdomen. Needless to say, the amateur archeologists take Jason and the woman up to their space ship, called ""Grendel,"" with the idea of returning to Earth 2 with this precious cargo. But the professor leading the team discovers that the woman is still alive, and after some cool nanotechnology special effects, revives her just as Jason awakens and begins his bloody killing spree. Of course, repeated warnings about the murderous powers of Voorhees fall on deaf ears until so many bodies stack up that it's impossible to ignore the fact that everybody is in serious danger. Various efforts fail to stem the tide of mayhem until Jason takes a BIG fall at the end, but even then, we see he may reemerge to continue his reign of terror.
The cast of ""Jason X"" is largely forgettable, with the exception of the delicious Lexa Doig who plays Rowan, the survivor from the Crystal Lake Research Center. Rowan's role is that of a warning siren sounding ominous notes about Jason and the danger he poses. There is a team of grunts onboard who die in particularly grisly ways as they hunt down Voorhees, but only the leader of the soldiers gets any real screen time. The student archeologists consist mainly of young woman in scanty attire, which really surprised me. It is, after all, 2455. Who knew Britney Spears's fashion sense would last nearly five centuries? The other notable member of the crew is an android, played with hammy effectiveness by Lisa Ryder. The android gets an ""upgrade"" by her creator in order to battle Jason. At this point, Ryder emerges decked out like Trinity from ""The Matrix."" It's laughable, but Ryder's one-liners and snarky emoting (nose twitching, exaggerated smiles) helped me through the movie. Look for David Cronenberg in a short lived (ahem) role as Doctor Wimmer, a sleazebag who wants Jason for his own sick research plans. By the time Jason gets his own ""upgrade"" thanks to nanotechnology, you know you're watching truly brilliant cinema.
""Jason X"" isn't the best ""Friday the 13th"" movie, but it still entertains. The DVD contains a slew of extras, including a documentary about the franchise including interviews with Sean Cunningham, a couple of goofball fans of the series, and Joe Bob Briggs. There's also a documentary about how they made this installment, and it is one of the best ""making of"" extras I've ever seen. Throw in a trailer for the film (along with three others for movies like ""Nightmare on Elm Street""), a ""jump to a death"" feature, and a commentary with the director, producer, and writer, and you've got a nice disc. I'm still miffed to learn that cuts made to insure an R rating carried over onto the DVD. Why, oh why, can't we get those cuts restored on a DVD release? Even if they don't put them back in the picture, they could still add them as deleted scenes. This has been a major problem with nearly every entry in the ""Friday the 13th"" series, and it's about time fans of the movies saw all of these gory cuts.",1062028800,2,5433,4.67816091954023
1748593,5,B00006FI0S,"Frozen at the beginning of the movie a la Demolition Man, Jason stands frozen for over 400 years before being discovered by a space team on a training mission. After awakening in the future, he has fun. After being blown apart by a sexy android, everyone thinks he is dead. He gets reconstructed thanks to some kind of machine as an unstoppable half man, half metal very mad dude. If you don't watch this movie, Jason will come for you. Tonight!",1062028800,,445,4.506172839506172
1748594,4,B00006FI0S,"Believe it or not, this proved to be a pleasant surprise.  After seeing ""Freddy vs. Jason"" I felt it was time to finally see the Jason movies once and for all.  I have watched all 10 of them this weekend.  Some were great... others were horrible.  I was dreading the day I'd finally give this one a chance as I thought it would be terrible.  Surprise, surprise, ""Jason X"" proves to be an entertaining addition to the Jason series that dishes out a bloody good time.
We've seen Jason in all sorts of periods of time... except for the future.  That's right.  The date is 2455 and a group of students stumble upon the body of Jason Voorhees.  They take him to their ship hoping to find out more about him.  Big mistake, as they have awaken the beast.  Now he's controlling the ultimate bloodbath in space where nobody can save them now.
Like I said, I really did not expect this to be good.  I was really surprised by how entertained I was by the movie.  It is TEN TIMES better than ""Jason Goes to Hell"" (which in my mind was a complete disaster).  Let's face it, when you go to see a Jason movie you're not looking for Shakespeare.  You're not looking for an Orson Welles masterpiece.  You want to see Jason brutally tear people apart with an assault of various weapons.  And that's what ""Jason X"" accomplishes.  And it even does it in a neat way.  It sounds like it could be a mess, but the ""space"" setting is actually a neat and different approach to the already ""legend"" Jason movies.  After all, you can only have Jason attacking campers at Crystal Lake so many times before it becomes old and tired.  My hat is off to the originality that went behind the script.
The DVD has some really cool features.  First, the movie looks AMAZING.  A crystal clear picture quality all the way.  The sound is impressive as well, as you can watch it in DTS if your system allows it.  Special features include commentary, ""Jump to a Death"" option, a behind-the-scenes featurette, trailers and so much more.  The best feature is the ""Jump to a Death"" feature which enables you to watch certain killings from the movie separately, at random, or all together.  A very cool DVD that is more than impressive.
""Jason X"" is what it is; a slasher flick with a new idea behind it.  You're not going to watch it for the great acting, the in-depth plot or storyline, or to be intrigued and intellectually stimulated.  You see it to watch Jason kill many, many people.  You see it for the mayhem, the chaos and the brutality behind this masked fiend's bloodlust.  While it's not the best one in the series, it definitely surpasses the bad ones in every way (mainly naming parts 3, 5 and ""Jason Goes to Hell"").  I have to admit it, it is a very enjoyable addition to the Jason series.  If you're a fan of the hockey-masked killer, then I recommend it.  You may be surprised.  I know I was.",1061596800,,2863,4.411089866156788

Vorhees is frozen, waking up after 400 years!
The plot is much more simpler then in JASON GOES TO HELL,but the deaths are much more amusing. And to be honest with you, that's what I seek from this kind of movie. There is no horror in the movie,at least not for the horror fans.

This movie doesn't even rate B-flick status (and I like B movies).  I hope they stop with the Jason movies, as it is completely obvious that they are running out of ways to bring him back.

While other mad serial killers, almost all of whom I like, worry about finding more innovative ways of inducing horrible death to those around them, killing only when they have a good dumb cliche to accompany the coup de grace, Jason prefers the good, old-fashioned, traditional methods of murder.  Sure, he has been known to use some innovative implements of horrible death, but only because they happen to be handy.  Jason's hands, even after being cryogenically frozen for four and a half centuries, still quiver for the feel of his trusty machete.  Jason doesn't waste any time, either; he just kills people.  Yep, with a total body count now exceeding 250, Jason Voorhees is an unstoppable killing machine that refuses to let such silly things as countless bullets, drowning, body-ripping explosions, head-obliterating kill shots, or anything else man can think of stand in the way of doing his job.  Somewhere, even in the future, there are young people having sex, acting silly, or delivering sometimes awful dialogue in bad acting performances; adults are planning to sell him to the highest bidder in hopes of studying him like some lab animal; or Terminator-aspiring androids are making fools of themselves and just begging to be taken to his school of hard knocks; and Jason is there.  He can't be stopped; he can't be reasoned with; he can't be bribed; he can be sidetracked, but nor for long; he is here to kill, without remorse, without any sign of emotion, and that is why some many of us love him so much.
Let's forget the script for a moment and look at what is really important.  Jason kills a lot of people in this movie, as only he can do it.  After a Houdini-like escape and quite satisfying instant bloodbath, he finds himself cryogenically frozen; he breaches the hull of his little unit in an attempt to kill again, leading our intrepid group of future student researchers into believing he is far beyond the help of the nanotechnology that revives his last intended victim.  Yet, after 455 years of inaction, he has no trouble whatsoever adapting to the futuristic technology of the spaceship he finds himself on, making one of his most satisfying kills immediately after arising from his metal slab.  Soon afterward, the ship's grunts are after him, hauling around the type of goodies that as yet exist only in the world of Duke Nukem and Quake, but we laugh for Jason (since he can't laugh for himself) as he makes mincemeat out of the tough men and women.  That leaves only a disgusting professor, his silly and horny students, an android, a few of the ship's essential nobodies, and his cryogenic travel buddy Rowan left alive.  You never have to worry about waiting long for each death, as the filmmakers rightly decided not to let some of the awful plot elements get in the way of the carnage.  Eventually, Jason is upgraded to uber-Jason, and that only adds to the fun.
The special effects are generally quite impressive here; some of them are a little silly plot-wise, but they look pretty darn good.  The super android whose upgrade goes to her head is a pretty stupid character, yet she does bring some new toys to the party, forcing Jason to rise to the occasion of upstaging her.  It was quite interesting to watch the DVD featurette on the making of Jason X.  This movie is fully digitalized, and all of the cutting edge work that went into this film makes me think I should have been a little more impressed than I was, but everything definitely looks and sounds pretty darn good.  The acting ranges from the good to the bad.  Lexa Doig is great as Rowan, Kane Hodder is perfect as Jason, and Peter Mensah wins high praise from me for his portrayal of Sgt. Bronski; he is the only worthy foe Jason faces here, and the man knows how to make an exit.  The professor and students are just plain silly characters one and all, but since all that really matters in this type of movie is that they all die as quickly as possible, I have decided not to let the cliched, silly dialogue of these folks detract from my five-star rating.
Not only is the featurette on the making of this film a great addition to the DVD, the half-hour documentary on The Many Lives of Jason Voorhees is wonderful.  It does my heart good to see both knowledgeable folks from the actual movies and horror fans express the true joys of watching slasher films.  Best of all, the documentaries introduce us to the man behind the mask, the only man to ever play Jason in more than one movie, Kane Hodder.  A former stuntman reveling in the role of horror's most productive serial killer in the last four franchise movies, Hodder is a credit to the character he so enjoys playing, boasting a special tattoo on his inside lower lip to prove it.  Jason X is not a good movie script-wise, but don't let that stop you from watching Jason Voorhees do what he does best in this final sparring practice before his impending, highly-anticipated showdown with Freddy Krueger.",1058572800,3,5214,4.679431072210066

Anyway, Jason X contains a list of kinda unknown actors, who do an ok good of getting killed. The only good thing about this movie, is that it has a nice arrange of deaths. Ranging from Jason Freezing a women's head frozen, then busting against the counter, to beating two topless women wrapped up in sleeping bags against the tree, and against each other.
This movie is your average horror movie, with no real good plot, but lots of killing. If you are into this types of movies, please rent this movie right now. If your not, then stay far away from this movie. Very..very...very far away.
Overall, Jason X is an OK movie to watch ONE TIME, not one to have on your shelf for future viewing. This movie is very decent, but not an Oscar winning movie.

Same with this movie, except he is in space killing the same type of people that show up in just about every other Friday the 13th movie! The acting is terrible, they were obviously just there to have fun and get killed. Also, wouldn't Jason have noticed the change in the setting? He did in Jason Takes Manhatten. It doesn't even look like a spaceship. It looks Farscape inspired (another series I don't care for) and just fake looking.

Wastefully knocking off gorgeous female scientist students, professors and military grunts.  Jason X is a lot of fun.  I may have enjoyed it just because I was expecting something so much worse.

Some may call me a purist, but Jason X is nothing like the rest of the series.  I know this is not the first time that the writers tried to take a departure from the played out story line, but why not stick with what works.  Perhaps if I lived under a rock for the last 25 years and had never heard of Friday the 13th, maybe I would have seen some light at the end of the tunnel for this movie.  But I haven't and I didn't.
The one thing that always brings me back to the Friday the 13th series is the feeling of dread that I get when I watch them.  You know what I mean, a house full of teenagers, never knowing where Jason is or what he is doing.  Jason X didn't have that at all, and totally ruined the movie for me.  It was more 'predictable' than the others and they showed far less gore than any other Jason movie.
Redeeming Qualities:
 - The holographic camper seen (Hell Yeah! That was cool)
 - Jason's first killing when he wakes up (creativity, I like that)
Other than that the movie was lackluster and uninspired.  There is nothing wrong with taking a departure and trying something new, but never forget your roots.",1053734400,2,1292,4.173387096774194

I must admit that when I first heard of the premis of the film I was at least interested becouse I finally thought that some time and effort was going into the script. Well no such luck. This is just stupidity in space.
  The plot surrounds the indestructable killer Jason Voorhees
has finally been caught and is now being sought after by the millitary to find out just what makes him the way he is. Well of course Jason kills everyone but one women who freezes herself and Jason solid. Well hundreds of years later Earth is now a barren wasteland (much like this series has become) and is only visited. On one mission a group of explores (Kids mostly) come to earth and find both Jason and the women. Well of course Jason gets unfrozen and he is now free to go hunting ...teens as he wants and in some very inventive ways (which is more than I can say for anything else in this movie).
  This movie is so insulting that you find yourself rolling your eyes very early in the film. I have become very irritated when I see people making jokes right as their about to die and people acting in ways that are so unrealalistic that you can't help but be both bored and angry at the same time. The movie could have been at least entertainimg if they just tried a little but I guess that is way to much to ask for. I have often thought that in the right hands the last of the 13th movies could be somthing entertaining if not even scary. So I and sending a plea out to good horror directors like Wes Craven, John Carpenter, George A Romero, Sam Riami, Tobe Hooper, or Steven Spielberg (remember he did Duel and Jaws the man knows suspense) to please take over the next Friday the 13th project and try to save it.

This was the first of the Friday 13th films I saw, but certainly wasn't the last.
I had seen a lot of the classics by the time I saw this one, including one of the benchmarks, Halloween.
Let's just say I was already getting a little sick of the horror cliches and predictable formula most directors use. Ever wondered why the villain has to walk when pursuing someone, yet the intended victim gets to run? Why the victim happens to be a complete moron with know idea how to protect her/himself?
Well I was hoping to find something different with few disappointments to enjoy. My friends, Jason X has definately upped the ante.
The story is great and breathes new life into the aging saga. The special effects are simply the best I have seen in a horror movie. Fans of Event Horizon who were disappointed by how the SFX detracted from an otherwise exceptional horror film will not feel the same way about the 10th Jason flick. Jason has always been about 'creative kills' and one of the absolute best I have ever seen is when he plunges a woman's face into liquid nitrogen for a few seconds and then smashes her crystalised face into a million shards on the bench.
Pure Class :)
Halfway through the film there is another great surprise...but I don't want to spoil it. Let's just say the cyborg Jason manages to do something pretty cool with the new technology available in the future...
The fun continues right up until the end where for me the only disappointment of the film comes in. The ending is just a little too cheesy. I mean points for thinking of something different (and yes, leaving open the possibility of another sequal) but ummm, well, judge for yourself.
The other brilliant thing about this DVD is the absolute top class special features. When you hear the makes of the film talking about what went into their vision of this film you will understand why they managed to realise that vision so well. But the best feature is the interview with the actor, actually a stunt man, who has played Jason in the last 4 films. He really loves playing Jason a little too much, to the point where he actually scares the other actors when in costume. It's all method acting or so he says, but I think he's got a little of the psycho killer in his personality personally :) Have never seen an actor talk about a role with such relish or seem so committed to it.
Anyway if you like horror and want to see something new, especially if you liked Event Horizon, then buy this DVD!!! It's a keeper.",1046476800,3,2627,4.452282157676349
1748820,4,B00006FI0S,"i like the plot to this movie, however this movie couldn't outdo the original flcks originally from paramount. that's because jason is in space rather than crystal lake. anyway, it takes place NOT AFTER JASON GOES TO HELL I REMIND YOU, since that would make this movie not make sense, but the upcoming freddy vs. jason takes place right after jason goes to hell. So, Jason starts out as a prisoner held captive at Crystal Lake research facility, where he is awaiting cryogenic suspension. Then so goverment people want to move him too a new facility, since jasons ability to regrow lost tissue, and have super human strentgh, is a quest for more research. Jason escapes his chains, and starts chasing the secretary, Rowan, who plays a big part in the movie. she develops a plan, leading jason down to the basement. she leads him into the crystasis unit, and pushes him in a freezer, and shuts the door. but unluckily for her jason won't give up that easy, so he stabs a hole through the unit, which causes leakage. over 400 years later a routine training mission to earth, they find Rowan and Jason frozen in time. they bring their bodys to a space station, thinikg they can bring back Rowan. when it looks like jason would be unable to be brought back, he just suddenly awakens on the ship. it's too late though, when they discover who they are really dealing with when they bring back rowan. she warns them of jasons past, but its too late. jason is well rested, and ready for action.

1748821,5,B00006FI0S,"Sometimes, when you've tried just about every methodology to solve a problem of homicidal proportions (hanging, stabbing, slicing, dicing, bullets, and blowing to bits), there is only one of two things you can do. You can either deal with the blight in the here and now, trying to perhaps reason with or recondition it so that it wants to be nice and play well with all the other boys and girls, or you can freeze it and leave it for future generations to contend with. Well, in the case of Jason Vorhees, training in the art of daisy harvesting and the coloration of pretty pictures was never much of an option, so its off to the cyrochamber he goes. Along the way, however, the military decides that he, with his ability to sidestep death with a swan's finesse, is too valuable to toss away and that they can control him while reaping those benefits. Ultimately, however, they prove that this is far from the case, costing them many a life in the process and keeping some trace of him still dormant behind that frozen antiquity of a mask he wears. So, when people come looking at the now abandoned Earth1 450 years later, space finds itself a new occupant and Jason finds himself a new killing field.
In this installment of the Friday the 13th saga, all theories of Jason being stoppable in a conventual sense have been thrown out the window. Instead of worrying over silly notions like being shot multiple times or stabbed to death, he can simply shrug off barrages of bullets as if they were nothing more than a laughtrack to play by and find ways to keep getting up even when movement should no longer be an option. Still, in many respects, that's part of the endearment that this movie, while mocking other parts of the Vorhees movement, showcases for its beloved audience. Instead of the Jason that has been toned down in the last portions of the struggle against the machete-toting madman, we are now faced with something akin to a cunning (yes, silent and cunning) killing machine. The actors, in many a B-movie way, add to the fun within this film, keeping you entertained as Jason plays his twisted game of tag as well, some dying in horrid fashions and some playing a good game of chase while running before meeting fate's open hands. Added to this is the ending, which is funny as well, making it a Friday the 13th that was, in so many ways, fun of ridiculously gore-filled fun.
For anyone that's followed the series up until this point, I would ask why you wouldn't take another step forward? In fact, you might find it funny in many a right, plus dismissive of those horrid chapters that should have never existed to begin with. Even people who don't like the slasher genre itself but like playful horror might have fun with the campiness herein, knowing full well that Jason will kill, that you will laugh, and that the future will never be the same again.

After seeing ""Jason goes to Hell"" and 9,8,7 I was truley convinced there wasn't any hope for this franchise. But I have to honestly say this was done very well and was alot of fun to watch. This movie contains 28 interesting funny creative kills! The special effects are really cool and colorful to look at. This is a fun movie people,we all know who and what Jason is! I think people are abit hard on Jason because they expect to much. I think considering how horrible the past 3 efforts were, the did wonders cleaning it up. If you are not a Jason fan, or if you are going in to this to critique the film? This is definitley not for you! But if you are going into this with an open mind and to laugh at the kills and the quirky characters ? This is definitley going to be an enjoyable experience for the non serious watcher. I think even the producers of the movies are beginning to not take it so seriously. ""Jason's character every since the early 80's was basically a uproarious character. But back then there wasn't mush out that was scary so people took the creative kills more seriously. Now generations have changed and all od these cheesy teen slasher films have taken over which makes ""Jason"" silly in most peoples Eye's! But I would have to say that ""Jason X"" is definitly a step above all other slasher films, like it or not! This delivered a extreme creativity plot wise and some nice scenery to look at. And it was written to be funny to add some comic relief to the horrible murders that take place. On the DVD it even has a section/option where you can just watch the kills and there all labeled..can you believe that? I feel the only thing that really messed this film up plot wise was the whole Uber Jason Idea ! That was abit over the top being that Jason was already invincible and couldn't be killed. That takes alot of fun out of him being somewhat human..ya know! Then the way he changed was completely unbelievable. I can understand if he was experimented on and he was given this gift. But for this to just natural happen after he was destroyed for the 50th time, was a bit more than I could swallow. Then the whole thing with the ship blowing up and him floating through space. Then he was coming back toward the ship to and another just so happen astronaut knocked him away? That was just really silly and then the astronaut was riding on Jason's back? Anyway other than the ridiculious hard to believe ending this is a entertaining film to watch take nothing from it. The Dvd is well put together it has great Audio, a beautifully crafted Menu! The documantary's and Commentary's are well put together. Actually this movie is better on Dvd than it was at the theater. You actually get a chance to look at behind the scene footage with ""Kane Hodder"" the guy who plays Jason. Also they go into the history of the other films and the original creater ""Sean Cunningham!"" Also they go into the making of Jason X , and they explain abit about who JAson is why he is hard to kill. They also touch on the Jason vs Freddy movie coming very soon! This is a good package, If you are a true Jason fan. I have to honestly say ""Jason Lives"" was basically the last one I actually thought was decent before this! Personally people I don't think they could have done better than this, there back was against the wall! There really wasn't much left to bring Jason back! He was really ruined with ""Jason Takes Manhattan"" and the Horrible ""Goes to Hell!"" They really made a huge effort and I respect it and I am glad they made the decision they did. I don't think another boring day at the lake would have cut it. I think the only reason this movie was ridiculed and critiqued so bad because it was Jason. You took Jason out of this and put some lame Alien aboard the ship killing everyone..then it would have been excepted better. That is just the way the world is when people have an opinion made up about a person or something they stick to it. The world is full of myopic individuals that it why we are so behind other countries in Music etc.

1748823,4,B00006FI0S,"Jason Vorhees has been slashing and hacking his way through nubile female teens and geeky boy ones for so long that fans probably thought that there were no more fertile grounds for the hockey-masked killing machine to wander. In JASON X, director James Isaac proves yet again that in the hands of sufficiently talented cast and crew even shop worn lumbering behemoths can take on a shiny new gloss.  In the previous Jason films, Jason (Kane Hodder) was all business as he dispatched legions of screaming extras with his trusty machete.  A high body count, rather than humor or even style, was his goal.  In the first Jason film in nearly a decade, Hodder manages to imbue his character with more than a liberal dose of both.
In the film's start, Jason is a captive of the military, who admit that he cannot be killed due to his penchant for regeneration.  Instead, he is cryogenically suspended--along with a lovely female scientist--only to be reanimated in the year 2455 on New Earth II, the previous earth (our earth) having been rendered uninhabitable in the previous century. Beginning with Jason's reanimation, director Isaac borrows liberally from other films like THE THING and ALIENS.  When a group of scientists discovers his true nature and identity, one of them, just like Robert Cornthwaite from THE THING and Paul Reiser from ALIENS decide that Jason's scientific and financial value counterbalance his potential for harm to all concerned.  The second half of the movie is a lightning and thunder blast kaleidoscope of what a thing-versus-victim opus should be. Except for Kane Hodder, none of the other cast is well-known.  Lisa Ryder,however, has a future in action slug-fest films though.  Here she is an android who, like Lance Hendricksson as ALIENS's own android, offers effective opposition in a manner that is both exciting and amusing.  By the time the closing credits hit the screen, the audience has seen enough of Jason's latest go-round to hope that the teasing end which closes the final reel will lead to another sequel but only if someone takes the trouble to realize that an abundance of gore without the leavening effect of style and humor will alienate even the most fanatical of fans.  JASON X delivers on all counts.",1045267200,,2252,4.9338624338624335

I have seen every film in the series once and have enjoyed them all.  They're entertaining movies, and with the exception of the original Halloween, better than the Halloween series ever was.
  Jason X succeeds in taking the series in a new direction.  Jason Voorhees is resurrected in the future on a spaceship and finds various sharp objects on board that he uses to wipe out the crew one by one.  Okay, so the formula isn't radically different from the other movies in the series but I admire the filmmakers for trying.  Still, towards the end of the film, the emphasis is clearly on action, and there is a fiar amount of gunplay and explosions, two things typically not seen in this series.
  This was a fun movie, and I am now looking forward to the upcoming Jason vs. Freddy, which pits Jason Voorhees against Freddy Krueger the villain from the Nightmare on Elm Street series.

I must say this movie is the funniest I have ever seen.  Seeing Jason beating ..two holographic women that just won't die.  Or a droid switching into Rambo mode and beating ...Jason is hillarious.  This movie is really trash, but it is very enjoyable.  The DVD has excellent features you can watch all the murder scenes one right after another without worrying about the storyline inbetween.

1748876,5,B00006FI0S,"When you think about all of the things Jason Vorhees has been through in the 10 sequel span of the Friday the 13th series, you have to laugh. He drowned, he got a machete in his shoulder, he got an axe in his head, he got hung, he got a machete through the head, he drowned again, he got set on fire, he drowned again, he got splashed with toxic waste and transformed into a little boy (!), he was blown up and he was even sent to the pits of Hell! Boy, you would think it ends there, but nope. Good old Jason, everyone's favorite unhappy camper is back for yet another sequel! Jason X is not what the average F13 fan would expect. The wilderness setting is ditched for (like you didn't know already) outerspace. The movie opens up with a very sad looking Jason locked up in the Crystal Lake Research Facility, sometime in the very near future. Now, if you're like me, three questions will spring to mind: 1.) How did Jason get back from Hell? 2.) Why would a small, insignificant town like Crystal Lake have a high-tech research facility? and 3.) What exactly is a research facility? It doesn't matter. The movie doesn't waste time in trying to explain it. Jason kills most of the people in the ""research facility,"" except for the head scientist, Rowan, who is cryogenically frozen with Jason to return to a time where free love no longer reigned and greed and corruption ruled again (sorry, wrong movie). The rest of the movie takes place in the year 2455 aboard a space ship full of students from Earth 2. Yes, you heard me. Earth 2. As one of the characters briefs us in the beginning, Earth 1 is dead, The water and the soil is forever tainted. Yes, 453 years in the future the teenagers are still horny, still do dumb things when in danger and still have really corny lines. Which means Jason has plenty of good morgue meat to serve up, and believe me, this one has the highest bodycount of all the F13 movies. One thing I noticed about this movie, as opposed to the previous entries, is that the gore is not as restrained as usual. This was noted by director James Isaac on the commentary, where he states the the MPAA went easy on this movie because they understood what the purpose of the movie was. This movie is not just another Friday the 13th entry. It injects a lot more humor (not the wink-wink nudge-nudge type, it's the kind that when it's making fun of itself, you'll know) than previous sequels and it isn't just an excuse for an 80 minute gore/special effects extravaganza. This movie is a labor of love. Everyone involved is either related to the series or is a fan of the series. First time screenwriter Todd Farmer, a writer from Texas (He also plays Dallas in the movie, a nod to his hometown) wrote an excellent script for this movie. He is said to be a huge F13 fan, and it shows. Sure, the dialogue is corny, but that's not the point. Together with David Cronenberg understudy, James Isaac (Cronenberg has a bit part in this movie), they created a nice change in the Friday the 13th pattern and some very memorable moments. Who can forget the Crystal Lake flashback? The ""Screwed"" death? Any Friday the 13th fan who is willing to let themselves have a good time will not be disappointed. The DVD also delivers, giving us audio-commentary, a half hour documentary on the series and it's impact on pop-culture (quite interesting), a documentary on the making-of Jason X and of course, the excellent ""Jump To A Death"" feature where you can cut out the fat and just watch all of the murders, one after another.",1043798400,7,3533,4.4621329211746525

I admit the death scenes are pretty cool and the cinemotography isn't real bad but the score, the special effects, and especially the acting is real bad.

A research team studying on jason find out hes more powerful then they think and he escapes and kills everybody except for a girl who lives to cryogennicaly freeze him and herself as well while 300 years in the future college students find Jason and defrost him and the girl on their spaceship when jason comes alive and starts killing people.

1748879,1,B00006FI0S,"Who's idea was it to make this movie and why haven't they been tarred, feathered, and then shot in the head in retaliation? If you read that sentence and still have the urge to watch this movie, please go rent it, instead of purchasing it. Also if you haven't seen this movie and plan to, please do not read the rest of this review because I talk about key plot points, and they may give away what little (and that is an overstatement) suspense this movie has.
O.K back to my review. First of all why did they only have one guard to guard Jason in the beginning? Also why is only wrapped in chains? They attempted to kill Jason a bunch of times and they decide to keep Jason wrapped in chains in a warehouse with one guard. Come on now that is just idiotic.
Then in the future he is revived and after they kill him, he is reginerated by a broken computer. But wait I thought they tried that in the beginning of the movie and failed. That's why he was frozen in the first place. Jason can't be killed, he can only be knocked out. No matter what you do he is still alive even if it is just a piece of his brain. But somehow a stupid robot can destroy him. It makes no sense.
Why is it when Jason is reginerated he is ""upgraded""? Why can't the producers of the Jason movie can go back to the basics? A bunch of stupid kids that go into the woods to get laid, drunk, and stoned. Then they are killed one by one by Jason.
That brings to me to another part of the movie that made no sense. What the heck were the writers of this movie thinking when they put the scene at the end with the hologram. The guy commands the computer to put up a hologram of the 1980's. Then a hologram appears with two girls by a Camp Crystal Lake cabin. They are half naked, with sleeping bags, and ask Jason if they want to smoke some weed, drink some beer, and have some unprotected sex. That is just the most idiotic plot twist in a movie since, well I have never seen a plot twist that idiotic. It also makes absolutely no sense. The writers are going to rot in Hades for what they have done to the Friday the 13th series.
The last thing that annoys me is the lack of good death scenes and nudity. All of the death scenes were way too predictable. Not that I am complaining that I knew who was going to die (I can tell with all of the Jason movies, who is going to die), but I knew how they were going to die. And that just takes all of the fun out of a Jason movie.
If the producers ever decide to make another installment of the Jason series, they better go back to their roots. Stupid teenagers, crazy old man that warns the stupid teenagers, rain, Camp Crystal, rusty sharp objects, nudity, drugs, alcohol, and a not upraded version of Jason. If they make a movie that contains all of the above, then maybe, just maybe I might rent it when it goes to the Favorites section of my local Blockbuster. But I will never forgive the producers of the last two Friday the 13th installments. Jason X and Jason Goes to Hell will never be added to my collection of Friday the 13th DVDs, and I hope that you will do the same.",1041811200,2,3094,4.124172185430464
1748880,5,B00006FI0S,"For all of the fans out there for Friday the 13th and all of the sequals that came afterward, this is what you've been waiting for. Jason Voorhees, the living, breathing embodiment of mankinds most evil sins and psycho madness, is here in his tenth film, where his murderous rampage of human butchery rockets to the stars over 400 years into the unknown future.
Upon claiming the life of his 200th victim, Jason is captured by the scientists of Crystal Lake Research Facility. Up to this point in the saga, Jason has been put through what would kill pretty much anyone else; gas-poisoning, impalement, hanging, drowning, electrical shock, over 200 bullet wounds at one given time, and even being blown apart, and still he keeps coming back. And each time he's been put down, he comes back even more psycho and dangerous than ever, gaining new abilities each time. It's pretty clear to everyone that Jason is not just a disfigured retarded killer. He's a supernatural entity that defies all the laws of death and reincarnation known to man, either natural or supernatural. They have decided to freeze Jason so that he can't kill anyone else. But, as usual, there is someone who just happens to let Jason out of his cage. He says that Jason's inhuman ability to regenerate lost and damaged tissue is too valuable and that it must be researched. Like most scientists in movies, he's willing to risk the lives of innocent people if Jason manages to get away, even though he is very confident that the grunts with him can handle the task. Well, transfering Jason without getting killed just isn't that easy. The scientist and his men end up getting slaughtered without getting a chance to deliver a blow in return. The clever and witty researcher who told these guys that Jason is just too dangerous to be kept soft manages to lure Jason into the cryogentic suspension chamber, but there happens to be a breach and they both end up getting frozen. Finally more than 450 years later, when Earth is no longer the life-giving planet that it used to be, they're brought on board a spaceship as relics. Some crazy professor says to Jason that he can have fame and fortune. Apparently, money and a place in the history books are of no interest to Jason Voorhees. Once Jason is out of the fridge and thawed out, he starts just where he left off. Even advanced weaponry and space soldiers arn't enough to keep Jason from getting back up. And when he's considered to be very dead for about the millionth time, he becomes a cross combination of reconstructed living tissue and cyborg technology, becoming a totally indestructable half machine Uber Jason, even stonger and more powerful than he ever has been at anytime in the series.

1748881,5,B00006FI0S,"I read a lot of editorial reviews in papers and online about horror movies, and notice that they always knock the movies for the same reasons: plot, acting, etc...  WHY??
THIS IS A FRIDAY THE 13th MOVIE!!!  Not Monster's Ball or Forrest Gump.  Yes, the acting isn't great..  No, the plot is not too deep...  This is simply a great genre movie from a great series.  Period.
There are a lot of great innuendos to other films in the series, some thoroughly impressive death scenes, and the usual cast of young hot people.  The story gets to the point pretty quickly and Jason makes his entrance early and nicely.  There's no plot twist, no extended periods of dialog, no excessive drama.  Just great action; some decent, well-timed scares; and an overall fast pace.  So overall this not a ""critic's film"" or a ""think piece"", and critics can spare me the teardown of the theatrical elements of the plot and acting.  It is a film with an awesome nemesis, great setting, plenty of blood, and at least a little sex.  What more do you want as a horror fan?",1040860800,,1048,4.51595744680851
1748882,4,B00006FI0S,"I am convinced there are two camps of movie-goers: Camp 1 thinks that the goal of cinema is to explore the human condition, create an epiphany in the viewer, and make the audience better humans for having watched the film. Camp 2 just wants to have fun.
Jason X is the ultimate Camp 2 film (to say nothing of Camp Crystal Lake), perfect for a weekend night with beer, chips & salsa, and a few good (Camp 2) friends. And if sheer entertainment is the mark of a fine film, then Jason X approaches high art.
Jim Isaac helms the Friday the 13th series' 10th outing; this time the series' eponymous machete-killer is under military guard at the Crystal Lake Research Facilty. Naturally things go wrong, Jason slaughters the Army squad sent to transport him ""elsewhere for study"" (he even impales horror master David Cronenberg in an amusing walk-on), and it's up to nubile scientist Lexa Droig to lure him into a cryogenic freezing tankand contain him for future mayhem. Alas, Jason's machete pierces the tank and her ribs, freezing her as well.
Jump ahead 450 years; a salvage/research crew from the starship Grendel recover Droig and her hockey-mask wearing companion from the Cryogenic facility, and rescue both from an Earth which has become a burned-out, dead husk. What happens next isn't exactly the stuff of Roman Polanski: Jason is taken aboard the ship, Jason thaws out, Jason slaughters with abandon!
Of course, where director Jim Isaacs succeeds is by having fun with his dialogue, with the actors, and with the movie's far-future setting. Worried that Jason X is just Alien with a machete and a hockey mask? Fear not. Director Isaacs plays with space walks, the destruction of a space station, nanotechnology gone wrong, and even a holodeck scene---the funniest scene in horror movie history, in which the crew re-create Camp Crystal Lake to distract Jason, even conjuring up two toke-smoking, bikini-clad, topless teenage girls who just ""love pre-marital sex.""
Better still, Jason X underscores why guys like K. Eric Drexler, Bill Joy, and Mike Crichton are worried about nanotechnology----who cares about grey goo destroying the world, when nanotech makes Jason a better serial killer! The scene where an army of little nanites rebuilds Jason is worth the price of admission alone.
Set design is cheesy but workable, acting is---well, we don't watch Jason flicks for acting, but a sexy android and cute victims in spandex make up for that---and the deaths are cruel even by the standards of the franchise's typical sadism. Victims get their necks snapped slowly, decapitated, dipped face-first in liquid nitrogen and then have their faces shattered, impaled on an industrial screw, sliced to death by machete, and even pulled through a grate.
DVD extras are amusing as well---you can use the ""Jump to a Death"" to instantly access your favorite Jason kills, the director/write commentary is amusing, and the two documentaries are enjoyably done. The only misfire is the soundtrack by Henry Manfredini, which sounds like a South Park-style parody and loses the movie one star; a heavy-metal soundtrack with some Rob Zombie and Manson would have been more fun.
All in all, Jason X doesn't change the world, address the human condition, or reinvent cinema. That said, with the exception of the first Friday the Thirteenth, it's easily the best in the series; if this is your sort of thing, this is the sort of thing you'll like.",1040860800,9,3434,4.973913043478261

Its like no other Jason movie in that concept. But if you want to buy a movie that is more fake than Harry Potter don't buy Jason X. He then turns into a Uber Jason like Shredder did in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2. Give me a break. This was just plain fake and pathetic. As i said the murdering rocks but the plot sux.

It was both poorly acted and poorly written.  The actors would blurt out cheesy lines that no one would ever say in a time of crisis.  The actors were very unemotional and you could tell they never were in another movie.  In my book the only thing that saved this movie is that the kills where highly original and highly gorey.  The uber jason has to be one of the worse parts.  you shouldn't have to give an unstoppable killing machine an 'upgrade'.  this movie [stinks] its highly un recommended.

1748935,3,B00006FI0S,"Nine years ago was Jason's supposed ""Final Friday"", but the folks at New Line decided otherwise, and thus we have Jason X: the tenth entry in the long running slasher series.  Though this installment spent nearly two years on the shelf, and it seems many a death scene was either re-filmed or edited, Jason X is still loads of fun due to the fact that writer Todd Farmer, director Jim Isaac, and the cast take none of this seriously.  After finding no way to kill Jason (the film seems to ignore anything that happened in Jason Goes to Hell), military autorities and scientists decide to cryogenically freeze the immortal killer, and naturally the blood starts to flow.  Jason (Kane Hodder returns once again) and the beautiful Lexa Doig (TV's Andromeda) are both frozen together and awaken in the year 2455 by a team of students on a training mission through space.  Jason gets loose once again, goes on one of his good 'ol killing sprees, and gets a new look as well.  Some other horror franchises that take a chapter to space have not fared well at all, examples are Hellraiser: Bloodline and Leprechaun in Space, but Jason X is a fun thrill ride.  Jason X is nowhere as gorey or violent as some of the other films in the series, and like I said before it seems some things were left on the cutting room floor.  The acting is pretty crummy for the most part, which has come to be expected by now with this series, but for the most part Jason X is fun when not taking itself seriously, but those who do take this film seriously (which will most likely be the same people that took From Dusk Till Dawn seriously) will absolutely hate it.  All in all, Jason X may not be the best in the series, but it is a good addition, and for the most part delivers the goods.  The DVD features are worth noting as well: the commentary by Jim Isaac, writer Todd Farmer, and producer Noel Cunningham is nice, while the original documentary The Many Lives of Jason Voorhees is very insightful and is a treat for older horror fans.  Look for acclaimed director David Cronenberg in an ill-fated cameo in the beginning of the film.",1039737600,2,2113,4.479166666666667
1748936,4,B00006FI0S,"Some movies have to be judged entirely on their own merits.  You can't watch them and expect them to be anything other than what they are and fairly comment upon them and this is one of those movies.
As the name indicates this is the 10th movie in the series and here we find Jason Voorhees, the unstoppable killing machine, being cryogenically frozen along with one of his captors.  His captor is awoken hundreds of years in the future on a transport ship.  Her pleas to have Voorhees dumped from the ship are ignored and before you know it Jason has thawed and is making up for lost time killing people left and right.
I have never really been a fan of this series.  I saw the first one and found it confusing and have periodically seen parts of the others and found them a waste so I viewed this one with some fear.  I knew a friend gave it to me but was I wasting my time?  Not really.  The movie is actually fairly well written.  Sure the plot is overall silly but within it's own context it works.  The jokes are funny and the killing scenes are new and unusual (the sleeping bag had me fall off my chair laughing).  Some of the dialogue is amusing and the introduction of the android is a treat.  It's not the greatest movie I have ever seen but it certainly isn't the worst and fans of the series shouldn't be at all disappointed with this entry.",1038182400,,1354,4.270588235294118

This is the tenth movie in the Friday the 13th series, and as usual Jason just won't die--and he's in space this time.  The DVD extras are great!  One extra is a behind-the-scenes look at Jason X, but the best extra on the DVD is a look at the Friday the 13th series and how Jason has evolved.  That is about a half hour long and extremely interesting and could have been longer.  There's also a feature where you can see every kill Jason makes in this movie.  The DVD shows them all in sequence, one by one.  This movie is fun and creepy, scary at times.  Kane Hodder plays Jason again for the fourth time and let's hope he's back for the next, he's really good.",1037750400,3,750,4.152777777777778
1749010,5,B00006FI0S,"At first when I heard that Jason was going into space, I thought Oh No!!!  How cheesy!!!  Then after so many delays in the release, I broke down and did the unthinkable...I downloaded the movie online to watch.  I couldn't take the wait any longer.  Now when the movie was FINALLY released, of course, the thrill was gone but I went to the theaters and saw it anyway.  It was still worth it.  The idea sounded silly at first but it was different for sure.  The movie started quickly with the action with more than 5 deaths in the first 10 minutes. I knew from that point that the movie was going to be fast paced and action packed.  Jason was at his best,especially with the whole crew not knowing exactly what they were dealing with.  The virtual reality scene was hilarious and took us back to the Crystal Lake roots.  I didn't exactly buy the ending but hey, it was still pretty cool.
The DVD release of ""Jason X"" along with the release of ""Jason Goes to Hell"" on DVD, put the previous Friday DVDs to shame.  I think the first eight movies released on DVD are probably the worst produced DVDs ever released.  The best part of most DVDs is the bonus features and the first eight have nothing worth mentioning.  The last two ""The New Blood"" and ""Jason Takes Manhattan"" don't even have the trailers.  ""Jason X"" has a couple of documentaries (which were great to watch), the trailer, bonus commentary and even a ""jump to a death"" sequence.  Paramount should take note of New Line's features and do a re-release of the first eight with many bonus features and for effect, release them in a nice boxed set.
Jason X is an excellent DVD and the bonus features alone make it worth every penny.",1037232000,3,1687,4.431818181818182
1749011,3,B00006FI0S,"The ""Friday the 13th"" series has gone through a major transformation since the series was first introduced to film audiences in 1980. While many might remember Jason Voorhees demise in the last Friday movie, ""Friday the 13th, Part IX: Jason Goes to Hell,"" many might be surprise to see that filmdom's most famous hockey mask-wearing slasher is back to no good in this film.
In ""Jason X,"" Jason Voorhees is transported a ship hundreds of years in the future after a crew of scientists land on a now desolate Earth. Stumbling upon Jason and the body of a scientists, the crew members are able to revive both bodies using modern technology. Reviving Jason was the worst mistake of this crew as Jason slashes and kills the unbelievably young scientists on board this ship.
I remember seeing this film in 1986 when it was called ""Aliens."" The producers of ""Jason X"" decided to rehash the original storyline of James Cameron's classic sequel to 1979's ""Alien"" and use a mass murderer brought back from the past to wreck havoc in the future. Starring a large, unknown cast of Canadian actors, ""Jason X"" which was filmed in Toronto can be funny at times, and has its' moments but like most of the later sequels in the ""Friday"" franchise, the series is losing its' strength.
Now might be a good time to retire the franchise or revive it with a legendary match against Freddy Kreuger. Whatever New Line Cinema (the studio bought the rights to the ""Friday"" series from Paramount Pictures over a decade ago) decides to do, I hope they make Jason's future killing sprees much more interesting and less unconvincing when it comes to who Jason will hack next.",1037145600,4,1644,4.7317073170731705
1749012,5,B00006FI0S,"Quite simply, this is the most intelligent ""slasher flick"" since...well...probably ever. This tenth installment of the Friday the Thirteenth series culminates the best parts of the series and pokes fun at itself for the worst. The plot is as deep as necessary, but not insultingly shallow as horror movies typically are. The teens being stalked are not as mindless as the genre's predecessors, and the stuntman-turned-actor Kane Hodder shows where his cult following comes from as Jason.
  For those looking for new, creative death scenes, Jason X certainly delivers, with not one scene change leaving you wondering how Jason killed the last victim.
The writing doesn't worry with such matters as ""How is Jason back from Hell?"" or other trivial thoughts...he's just here, and he's not very happy about it.
  From the horror fans, to the ""I only watch at Halloween"" buyers, Jason X is certainly deserving of ownership, because let's be honest, we all take pleasure in horror movies at one time or another, and this movie is just fun. If it was worth looking up a review on, you have enough interest for this movie to all out entertain you; not to mention there are a healthy amount of bonus features actually worth watching, including a history of the character Jason, and a making of Jason X.",1037145600,29,1292,4.885844748858448
1749013,4,B00006FI0S,"Jason X is no work of art that's for sure. The basic stalk 'n' slash formula is loud and clear but this time round there is so much more color and invention that provides decent distraction whenever big J isn't onscreen doing his murdering thingy.
The idea of setting it in space is sure odd but Crystal Lake was seriously overdone and although it seems very eccentric Jason seems to fit in with the spaceship location. As long as there are enough people for him to slaughter anyway.
It may lack the menace and dread of the previous films but at least it has a credible sense of humor and touch of irony. This film does a good job of re-inroducing Jason to a 21st century audience. And we will be getting even more of him soon when Freddy vs Jason is released next year.
The direction and imagination in previous installments were pretty amatuer but Jim Issac proves he's got some skill in this 'un. The SFX are flawless and the digital quality of the film really gives a futuristic sparkle. Which is well represented on the DVD.
New Line put Paramount to shame with this DVD. The extras are very cool ('especially the 'Many lives of Jason Voorhees' documentary) and the commentary is ace. THIS is how the franchise should be treated on DVD. The 1.85:1 anamorphic picture is superb and the DTS 5.1 sound rocks.",1036195200,8,1310,4.508403361344538

1749015,2,B00006FI0S,"After Jason Goes to Hell, my expectations were pretty low for this one. ""At least it can't possiibly be as bad as the last one"" I thought to myself as I popped Jason X in. And it's true, it was better than Jason Goes to Hell...in a way of saying it is better to be shot and killed instantly than to be stabbed and slowly bleed to death. One may be less painful than the other, but both sure do suck. That is the case here. This is the gunshot to Jason Goes To Hell's slow death. By now you probably know the premise of the movie. Jason kills a bunch of people on a spaceship some 446 years into the future. As is the tradition with the past few movies, no tie in to the movie before it(at the end of Jason Goes To Hell, Jason goes to, well, Hell). Also in Jason Goes To Hell it is explained by creepy actor Steven Williams of 21 Jump Street fame that only a Vorhees can kill Jason. No Vorhees on board the space ship, but needless to say, Jason is killed yet again at the end. Some of the things in the movie are REALLY bad, the acting being the first thing to come to mind. The characters themselves are very unlikeable. I have seen countless hundreds of horror movies, but this is the ONLY one I can remember where I wanted ALL the hapless victims to die. Anyways, the whole outer space thing adds too much sci-fi to the horror based film. The special effects are horrible, but really cool if you are into old horror(think Ed Wood here). And Jason's new look, which thankfully only came at the end of the movie, is laughable. BUT, there are some good things here. The timing of Jason's revival is hilarious, and the first kill on the space ship is a classic. The scene towards the end with the campers is awesome as it will remind true FT13 fans of one of the most popular killings ever. And the VERY end is cool as a throwback, retro effect. All in all, it is a lot of bad stuff to sit through to get to a few bright spots. Other than a few cool death scenes, nothing great here. If you need this for your collection, then get it. If you don't already have the previous 9 movies, don't bother buying this.

1749016,3,B00006FI0S,"I am going to  say different to the other reviews,but  this is just my view. I thought this film was not too bad,if you do not take it seriously. The crazy plot revolves around cryogenic freezing,outer space and worst of all ants that heal human tissue!(really)And so Jason ends up aboard a spaceship in the future doing his usual thing. You can see why Kane Hodder is so popular to fans as Jason,he looks like he really wants to do some damage and he does! as a DVD the picture is really good,and it has a choice of surround tracks to boot. I would have thought the jump to a death feature plus the many lives of Jason Voorhees featurette which details the many incarnations of the decaying serial killer nut would have been of interest of fans,but maybe not. All in all I found it a silly but quite entertaining horror flick which seemed to be quite tongue-in-cheek humour,for example when the survivors think they have escaped and left Jason in the exploding ship,you just know what's coming when a peice of 'debris' comes hurtling toward the escape  ship! I was laughing anyway. Also when  a digital recreation of Jason's old homeplace complete with teenage girls offering pot,alcohol and pre-marital sex comes up it seemes like a good mickey take as well. I have certainley seen a lot worse horror/comedy flicks anyway. Judge for yourself,rent it if you think it might be a dissapointment first.",1035676800,,1400,4.678861788617886

One reason is that the blood and guts looked ---------FAKE! I hate to put it that way but it's true. The violence looked very fake. If you put Jason Voorhees in a boring edition of Star Trek then you've got the idea of what this movie looked like. In the last sequel, Jason Goes To Hell - The Final Friday, Jason went to hell (duh!) But in the beginning of this movie, his body has somehow been discovered and brought to a lab or something. They think he's dead but guess what? HE ISN'T! WOW! The plot was O.K. and a lot different from the other Friday the 13th films, and the action is poor, the gory killing scenes are rather cheap, and the characters are just as terrible.

1749088,3,B00006FI0S,"The FT13 films have never been the mark of quality, and this is no exception. The scripts for these movies couldn't have been written by anyone over 12 years old, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't love them. I do like this one in the most cornball kind of way, but it's one terrible movie.  Remember, increasing the budget doesn't increase the quality of the film.  What made the Paramount Jason films good was their simplicity, and the fact that they were made in the 80s.  Jason doesn't translate well to modern film, coz in this post-Scream movieworld, any film like this has to be a self parody(Part 6 already accomplished that much better). First of all, the title; They totally threw away the FT13 title(it really had nothing to do with the plot anyway), and now it's just ""Jason"". Wouldn't it be ""Jason 1"" then since none of the others are called ""Jason""? Jason looks bad in this one. In the later films he was all decomposed and greyish, now he looks young again. His skin is normal, his eyes aren't all yucky and cruddy like they have been in the last few movies(since 6 actually). The film makers expect you to believe that Jason has been in captivity for some time and has been ""executed"" numerous times with no result. Didn't anyone think to incinerate him? And if he's been locked up for so long, why is he still wearing the hockey mask and the same clothes? Don't you think they would have removed the mask?  He's been incarcerated for five years, but five minutes into the film he just feels he's fed up with the whole prisoner thing and just waltzes out of his chains and attacks everyone.  Yes, this is yet another installment that pretends the previous film didn't exist. He gets aboard the ship with all the usual stereotype characters: evil, corrupt money grubber, nerdy computer geek, horny couple, wisecracking pilot(with cowboy hat), android chick(ever since Alien, if you have a movie that takes place on a spaceship, you have to have an android). The crack team of scientists and engineers are all hot women parading about in sexy attire. Yeah, right! There are no unattractive women on this ship. So, after Jason is thawed out, it's the same ol, same ol. Immediately he knows the layout of the ship better than the crew and has mastered the art of magically teleporting himself from place to place. Don't get me started on the fight scene with the android woman! This makes Power Rangers fight scenes look convincing. I could go on and on about every detail, but that would take me all night to write.

1749090,4,B00006FI0S,"Let's face it, no movie involving Jason Voorhees is going to win an Oscar for best picture, nor will Roger Ebert ever give one a thumbs up.  But these movies aren't really watched for their plots, its for the kills!  Jason X is supposed to have the highest body count of any Jason movie (I'm taking this on what I've read elsewhere 'cause I'm not gonna go through and count each kill myself) so there's a plus right there.  There is also a lot of humor in this film and I think its more of a satire than people realize.  Here's the basic premise of the film:  Jason Voorhees is being prepped to be cryogenically frozen because there is no known way to execute him (what happened to the whole theory in ""Jason Goes To Hell"" about a Voorhees having to kill him?  I guess they were wrong) (and no, there is no explanation of how Jason returns after the end of ""Jason Goes To Hell"") but some government-types realize that someone who can't be killed could be quite valuable.  Big mistake, because Jason kills almost all of them.  One woman, Rowan, manages to get Jason in to the cryogenic freezer but she is trapped in there with Jason.  400 years later, Earth is inhabitable and all the humans live in colonies in space.  Explorers return to Earth and discover Jason and Rowan and bring them aboard their ship.  They manage to revive Rowan but ignore her pleas to get rid of Jason.  Of course, Jason wakes up and starts killing everyone (and when does he wake up?  When the ship's passangers start getting frisky, of course).  From this point on, its a fight to stay alive.
  So there's your plot, but the real plus to this DVD is that it has what fans wanted and never got from the ""Friday the 13th"" DVDs from Paramount:  special features!  There are no deleted scenes, but there is commentary from director Jim Isaac and writer Todd Farmer with clips from producer Noel Cunningham woven into their conversation.  There are also two specials, one on the making of Jason X, and another on the history of Jason.  Plus, there are trailers and that stuff.

To summarize the plot: Jason (rejected from Hell) is captured and frozen in cyrogenic preservation. Many years go by, and Jason is thawed out by a band of scientists in the future. He is taken aboard their wicked-cool spaceship and his healing powers awake him. His rampage begins and eventually ""evil gets an upgrade""!!!!!
Dispite having a low budget this movie makes the most of Jason. All but the smartest scientists are killed and even they have a tough time escaping. The last ten minutes reminded me of ""Alien"" which was a cool way to pay respect to another great movie. Jasons new look is very scary and he is not happy to be in the future!

That, for one, got high marks from me. Admittedly, we've seen other horror icons in outer space before(i.e. Pinhead, Leprachaun) and that idea has worn thin through the years but we've never seen Jason there. Til' now.
Not only that but he gets a bold new look. Gone is the white hockey mask. Now, he sports a sleek new metal one, with demon red eyes to boot. Even his machete gets a sleek new design. It's about time that some of our favorite horror icons get a new facelift and are dusted off for a new generation. These guys had the guts to do it and I admire that.

1749095,2,B00006FI0S,"Jason X, the first Friday the 13th film in several years, tries to reinvent the classic serial killer. It's successful by having some good ideas, but it's a Jason Voorhees movie, how good can it possibly be?
Obviously I wasn't expecting anything phenomenal when I sat down to watch this film, just a fun slasher flick with my old buddy Jason. Not that I'm a big fan of the murderer, but I do, from time to time, enjoy his films on the guilty pleasure level. For the most part, though, I found this film to be sub par of most of his earlier films. Maybe it's just the slicker special effects and clearer picture that makes it seem like it's supposed to be better, but has the same bad acting and lousy plot as the others.
Of course, this one isn't meant to be quite as serious as most of his other films, just some of the corny acting, especially at the end, goes a little too far for my taste. There are some pretty cool moments though, such as when a female android gets tough and wails on Jason, when the monster becomes Uber-Jason, and a particular funny bit in a holographic-produced Crystal Lake. But these good moments take too much wading through uninspired scenes that have already been done to the umpteenth time in other slasher movies.

To me, the highlight of this series was parts 1 through 4. These movies just flowed together. part 5 came out, and it was different... they all continued to be different. I did enjoy part 6 and 7, but they were a completely different style. Jason x goes beyond this! This is right up there with ""Jason goes to hell"". It is sickening how much the writers tried to appeal to teens with the writing style. This screenplay is so bad!!!

After the incredibly poor ""Jason Goes to Hell"", the series gets back on track, and finds the titular mass-murderer slicing up teenagers in space....It may sound lame, but the self-mocking tone of the movie actually gives the whole premise some support.
After being chrogenically frozen, the fiend that is Jason Vorhees (Kane Hodder) is thawed out hundreds of years later, by a space crew. But he isn't the only person they discovered. Cue incredibly gory death scenes, and some flashy interstellar warfare (you certainly won't be missing Camp Crystal Lake).
Mayor fans of the series will no doubt dislike the space setting, but newcomers probably won't mind. Like any true 'Friday' film, the deaths are imaginative, and this is arguably the goriest entry since the original.

There's NO plotline continuity whatsoever that the older movies had! They should have stuck with the Crystal Lake Mythologies instead of the ...plotlines of 8 9 and 10(X).

Part 5: Jason wasn't the killer, Part Seven: Brought Back to Life & Killed by a girl with Telekinesis (Remember Carrie), Part 8: Jason takes on NYC. But Jason X is different, it sets out to take Jason to Space in the year 2455.  Sounds Corny, but in Jason X you'll find there's something different about the teenagers themselves.  They actually have a sense of purpose, an agenda, a reason for being out in the middle of nowhere. Not only that, but they have real problems that go beyond Jason.

His legacy and blood soaked cliches continue in this volume of the series, but unfortunately what was once a low-budget creepshow, has become a digital EFX showcase.
That's not necessarily a bad thing especially if any cash has come out of your wallet to watch it.
Your money, believe it or not, is on the screen. But great set designs, CGI effects and costumes can't save the novice cast, or us, from ""Jason X"".",1034121600,,601,4.733333333333333
1749200,4,B00006FI0S,"Jason has come, gone, come, gone, come, gone....you get the idea. He is the most slaughtered and most frequently resurrected maniac in movie history. Each time he came back for more, I felt like coming back for less. I found that even with Kane Hodder's increasingly good performances as Jason, the movies were lacking in any element that makes a movie worth watching.
""Jason X"" fixed that. It isn't like it has much more plot than any of the others. It isn't like it has any crucial scenes that make the whole ""Friday the 13th"" universe seem any more intense. It is simply a good film. The acting isn't bad. The plot is fun. The action is incredible. Jason is actually dynamic (see the virtual-Crystal Lake scene, you'll get it). It isn't really scary, but it is fun, and that is more than you would expect from the 10th installment in a series that hasn't shown us much in about 15 years (or 20, depending on your POV). I thoroughly enjoyed this flick and I don't see why any horror fan wouldn't.
Big bonus: This DVD actually has special features worth watching. The History of Jason is like watching a documentary on slasher films. And commentary tracks! Finally. Dimension Films could take a hint from the New Line crew (ahem, Halloween films).",1034121600,3,1248,4.626126126126126

1749203,3,B00006FI0S,"With what I thought JASON GOES TO HELL would be the FInal Friday, there is nothing ""final"" in horror movies anymore.  And in the 1990's horror films, only the relatives of the ""killer"" could successfully kill the killer.  That trend has now been lost and the best example of that would be this movie, JASON X !!!
  This is the tenth film in the ailing Friday the 13th film series and a film I was not very pleased with at all.  When I found out there would be a tenth film, I was outraged in that another film would be made.  This is not to say that I am not a fan of the film series, which I am a fan, but I enjoyed the first four films better along with Parts 6, 7 and Jason Goes to Hell !!!
  JASON X features Lexa Doig as Rowan, Kane Hodder as Jason (for the fourth time) and a cameo appearance by David Cronenberg.  JASON X takes us to 2008 where Jason is kept in a Research Lab to be frozen, but our hero kills a few workers, gets frozen with Rowan who are found four centuries later in 2455 by a spacecraft crew.  Jason kills the members of the spacecrew one by one and ends up where the whole thing started, back at Camp Crystal Lake.
  This unimaginative film was written by Todd Farmer, who script was unbelievably stupid with such stupid dialogue, it makes me wonder if he was somking cheap acid when he written JASON X !?!?!?  This film offered no new surprises, we still have sex crazed teens and we basically learn that nothing much has changed within four centuries.
  Although this film is as bad as Part 5 - A New Beginning and not as bad as Part 8 - Jason Takes Manhattan, JASON X, in my opinion is NOT one of the best films in the film sereis but is definitely a film that stands out on its own.  This film also has an ending that would lead into many unwanted sequels.
  JASON X, being a flop at the boxoffice and a flop by the general public is more proof that today's audiences are no longer interested in Jason and no longer interested in any more Friday the 13th films.  This also has proven that Jason has lost his prime ... a long time ago .... in Manhattan perhaps ?!?!?!
  JASON X is great in DVD as the picture and sound quality are in top form.  This film is presented in standard widescreen (1.85:1) format.  The film score by music man Harry Manfredini is not the greatest but suitable for this movie.
  JASON X has a great animated Menu Board and loaded with lots of Extra Feautures that would put Paramount to shame.  Feautures include a commentary by the writer, producer and director of the film.  ALso, A Jump to a Death which was quite cute but a slick move by New Line.  Theatre trailers are included along with other New Line theatre trailers.  Also, two documenturies, The Many Lives of Jason Voorhees (which is great to watch) and The Making of Jason X (which I still have to watch but am sure it is good), but the DVD packaging, presentation and its Extra Feautures are things I would give high marks for JASON X on DVD.  The film, I think was quite bad.
 ...P>  JASON X is a film for younger fans of the film series but not for the older fan of the film series.

1749204,5,B00006FI0S,"After the disappointing ""Jason Goes to Hell"", I was anxious to see someone -- ANYONE -- step up to the plate and revive the ""Friday the 13th"" series.  Not only did director James Isaac step up to the plate, he hit it the ball out of the park!

The movie starts out with our pal, Jason Voorhees, held captive in what appears to be an army research facility.  Hoping to learn from Jason's unstoppable powers, the researchers probe and analyze his mangled body for clues.
Silly researchers.
Everybody knows that Jason can't be killed... well, he was killed by his ""sister"" in ""Jason Goes to Hell"", but let's just pretend like that never happened.  Okay?

So, Jason tolerates the researchers for awhile, but then he decides to strike, when they least expect it.  Carnage here - death, pain and injury there.  One researcher survives, and manages to freeze Jason, and herself, saving the planet from certain doom.

Skip ahead 450+ years.

Jason is now traveling through space on an intergalactic cruise (space) ship.  The oblivious crew toys with Jason's frozen ""corpse"", unaware that their actions are about to create an intergalactic morgue!  Of course, Jason thaws-out, and quickly starts disposing of the troublesome passengers and crew.

Up to this point, there is nothing terribly exciting about ""Jason X"".  It's the same old Jason, and the same old killings, just in a different setting.  The movie really doesn't really get interesting until Jason steps into a machine that regenerates lost tissue and muscle.  Over the years, Jason has had his fair-share of battles, so it's safe to say that the man has some wounds.  The machine works overtime, repairing what it can, replacing what it can't.  What steps out of the machine is a Super Jason, if you will.

Half man.  Half machine.  All Jason Voorhees.

If you thought Jason was unstoppable before, just wait until you see him now.  Strengthened by armor, angered by vengeance, Jason becomes a true killing machine, in every sense of the word.

The highlight of the movie for me, is when two of the ship's passengers battle Jason in a virtual-reality Crystal Lake.
I won't ruin the mildly comical ending...

""Jason X"" is an intense thrill-ride that leaves you gasping for breath from beginning to end.
Let the bodies hit the floor!",1034035200,,2285,4.844961240310077
1749244,5,B00006FI0S,"Forgoing the events that unfolded in Jason Goes To Hell, Jason X, the latest in the long running Friday The 13th series, breathes fresh new life into the walking corpse known as Jason Voorhees.
From the very beginning of the film it is apparent that much care and thought went into the production, and that the nearly two-year wait for the film, was well worth it.
Much debate has been heard about whether this movie should have been called Jason In Space, but the space setting in reality only adds to the excitement of this film, as it doesnt provide an escape for the soon-to-be victims.  It almost plays out in a Ten Little Indians fashion, as unlike in the previous installments of the series, the cast knows that Jason is present.  The goal is to see who will get away and survive.
Kane Hodders presence as Jason has never been better and those that felt cheated by the last installment will be happy to know that Jason gets an awful lot amount of screen time.  Jason this time seems to be the most pissed that we have ever seen himthis of course is to our benefit. Though some of the kills do occur off screen, in most cases, you are able to view the full wrath of Jason.  (As a side note, for those of you that don't care for the new mask, it doesnt stop you from knowing for a single moment who is behind it.  After a few moments, the mask is nothing more than simply a different maskkeep in mind it has always been a different one before, this is no difference.)
Lexa Doig, whom plays Rowan, serves up the best performance of a hero in the series since Amy Steele as Ginny in Friday The 13th Part 2.  Not only is she strong, but smart and tries, yet to deaf ears, to warn them of the danger of Jason.  Three other standouts in the cast include Lisa Eyder, Chuck Campbell and Peter Mersah.
Todd Farmers script is quick with a wonderful blend of humor and horror.  Though the script is littered with humor throughout, the humor doesnt stand as something added without purpose.  Being a fan of the series, Farmer has been able to add onto the horror of Jason without adding unneeded details about his mythology.  The movie never lets up and provides something at least every ten minutes and it is because of this that I feel that he will stand to be one of Hollywoods great screenwriters in the work.  (For those that feel that there is too much humor in the film, there is not more humor in this film that was included in Friday The 13th Part 6: Jason Lives.  In fact, in Jason Lives, the laughter seemed a little more stressed than in this effort and adds to the joy of the film.)
Director Jim Isaacs vision is not only crisp and clear but very solid as well.  He shows much growth as a director from his previous efforts such as House 3.  Jason X is by far the most visually appealing out of the series and it is due much to his direction.  The combination of Isaac and Farmer is a highlight to the entire series and the money that it took to make the film shows well on the screen.  There isn't much fat to this film at all.
The only drawback to the film, and it is a small complaint, is the score from Harry Manfredini.  Though he has worked on the entire series, this score, while good, simply doesnt feel that it compliments the final work.  There are moments that bring back moments of Friday past, but it simply lacks something that you have a hard time putting your finger on.
(Also, for those of you that have seen the bootleg...you didn't see the entire film as some elements have been improved upon, it was an unfinished version, and therefore is an even more satisfying film.)
In all, the movie was a very fulfilling testament of what happens when true fans of the series give their heart and soul to a project.  It comes across in every frame of the film just how much respect they have as well for the fans that have made this series what it is.
I don't believe that every fan of the series though will appreciate their vision, but I believe that in time, Jason X will become a classic genre piece in its own right.
I personally loved and enjoyed every moment of it and I look forward to what adventures may lay in store for our favorite hockey masked maniac.
The DVD release from Newline is very solid.  Looks wonderful as well as sounds awesome.  This DVD is everything that the series lacks in the Paramount releases.

1749245,4,B00006FI0S,"I always hated the original films because I thought they were REALLY stupid. Well, after watching part 3, I didn't watch any more until part 8, which my friend dragged me too. It [was bad], to put it mildly. Then Jason Goes to Hell came out and I went and saw it with another friend. It was a whole new studio, and I had been impressed with the coverage offered by Fangoria and had been looking forawrd to it. There was maybe 10 people at the show. It was great and I was in love with Jason as a character, although I had wished he was in it more. Now, many years later, Jason X comes on the scene. This time I went with my girlfriend. Again, there was about 10 people at the show. We all LOVED it! We all laughed at the right times, particularly the whole last half hour. This is a sci-fi comedy with horror added as spice, not as a central element. Anyway, we all thoroughly enjoyed it and everyone applauded at the end, it was fantastic! So why did this movie bomb? Well, frankly I don't know. I thought it was spoofing Hellraiser: Bloodlines and Leprachaun in Space, but I think some people took this film seriously. This film was never meant to be taken seriously. When one character says ""It's ok, he just wanted his machete back."", it's a joke people. That's not bad acting, that's not bad writing, it's a joke. A funny one at that.
That being said, I do have some complaints. First, the editing. This film was completed and on the shelf for 2 years, why couldn't they fix the editing?... Also, the score just stinks. I believe I read somewhere that they hired the guy from the first one to also score this one. Why? Cheesy sythesizers [were bad]then and they [are] even worse now. My girlfriend maintains that they are spoofing those old scores, but I found it annoying. It wouldn't be so bad except the trailer was pumping with cool heavy metal music and it was certainly missed here. I also didn't like the Tomb Raider inspired robo-chick. She can't act, she didn't really further the plot and her wise-cracks got old real fast. I can overlook all of this though because this movie just rocks! The effects are great, but the real hero is the story that doesn't pull any punches and just GOES FOR IT! The film ends pitch perfect and sets up for a sequel, although that's pretty doubtful. So it looks like Jason X is the swan song of the series. There's a chance it could come back if Jason Vs. Freddy gets off the ground and is successful, but I'll believe it when I see it. Short of that, Jason X is a good bookend to the series, and shows off what all these films could have produced with a little more tweaking and more time to develop the scripts.

as a jason movie, and a fan of the F13 series, i admit i liked it. it had some good attempts at being scary and it was fun. the beginning of the film, up till the upgrade sequence, played like an old friday movie, just in space. the last 15-30 minutes were just plain old silly fun. it turned into a self-parodying action/comedy.
the gore content is high, even when you don't see the kill, the after kill is excellent. the space ship's pilot kill comes to mind. and like an 80s horror film, and jason film, the nudity and [word] is back in horror. acting is actually capable, nothing stand out, but capable. the set desgin and special effects are nice. and old jason is definatly nastier looking then cyber-jason. but he is just eveil looking, so either way you win.
is it great, no. is it a good addition to the series, yes and no. it has it's moments, but nothing beats the first seven. five may not have had jason, but neither did one. as an action/entertainment/pop corn flick, 5 stars. this movie delivers. just not a horror movie, which is where this movie loses a star and could be improved. it shows that the old horror films are still the best and that jason is better then anything out there today as a villian, but they could have made it a true horror film and made it one of the best horror films in a long time.",1033776000,2,1420,4.262962962962963

1749295,4,B00006FI0S,"I hear many complaints about ""Jason X.""  It's not scary, some say, and it's true though some part of the film actually is.  And some say it borrowed, probably unashamedly, many things from sci-fi classics like you know what (yeah, a spaceship full of soldiers? And a super-android?  Or virtual reality?).
The story, if you need to know, is set in ... 2455 (wow!).  After they somehow succeeded to freeze Jason Voorhees with unlucky scientist Rowan (Lisa Doig), the unsuspecting crew of a professor and his students (who are mostly females with scanty clothes ... oh, not again!) bring the bodies of them into a spaceship, where the bloody killing soon starts.
The truth is, ""Jason X"" knows what it is doing -- it has ""Don't-take-me-serious"" attitude with its definite intention to entertain us -- and it works, as long as you accept the film as it is.  Look at the whole premise: Jason in outer space.  That's it.  And he chops, hacks, slashes, without any particular reason, but this time, he even makes us laugh sometimes intentionally.  The final 20 minutes are truely, genuinely, (and awfully, perhaps) outrageous, with ""Uber-Jason,"" Jason becoming an upgraded killer-machine.
They are right in making those rather cheesy special effects, because we don't need ""Episode 2"" here.  You may think this film looks like an episode from ""Star Trek,"" and with good reasons. The main two characters are from TV-series Gene Roddenberry's ""Andromeda,"" and provide good acting, particularly Lisa Ryder's Kay-Em character, whose riot-like fighting against Kane Hodder (with his always reliable menacing physical presense) is a real fun.  Wynona Ryder should have been like that.

1749297,4,B00006FI0S,"Friday The 13th is now 10 films in, and it's still going strong... to most people, not all. For example, many Friday The 13th fans have been turned off lately by the extreme the films have been taking... but they have a point. Jason Vorhees in outer space?
The story is quite simple. Jason once again is captured and is being held at the Crystal Lake Research Facility. Guess what happens? You guessed it. Jason breaks free and is on the loose in the facility, and the killing begins... for a short while. He is lead by one of the main characters into the downstairs of the facility where he ends up being trapped and cryogenically frozen. After hundreds of years he is discovered by a exploration team, and is brought back to their ship (space ship?! How lame... this is Friday The 13th not Star Wars). The crew leader plans to make serious money on the well preserved Jason Vorhees, but his plans are foiled when Jason is reanimated and has the run ofthe ship to start killing again...and again... and again.
There are some great special effects in this film, as well as some nice sound effects as well. However the ship looks kinda cheesey though...but what do you expect? This series still appears to be low budget in many areas.
The music? It's a joke. It sounds like an old episode of Star Trek.
There is some nice variety in the characters in Jason X. You'll find characters you'll enjoy and characters you just won't be able to wait for Mr. Vorhees to slash.
Returning again is Kane Hodder (my personal favorite Jason actor)... but he's looked better in previous Friday The 13th films (such as 7,8, and 9). They obviously didn't take as much time for the makeup as they did before.
Gore lovers, don't fear, there is PLENTY in this one. There is some clever death scenes as well... but I won't spoil any for you.
This DVD is loaded with special features. It includes 2 documentaries, theatrical trailers, commentaries, and more.
If you can get past how far fetched this film is, you are in for an entertaining Jason film. The loaded special features will also keep you occupied (2 documentaries and more). Long live Jason Vorhees! Long Live Kane Hodder!

1749298,2,B00006FI0S,"If you really aren't picky about the quality of film you're watching and a fan of campy horror flicks and sci-fi spectaculars, then you might really enjoy this movie. If you yearn for a film with fine taste and high intelect, you will simply wanna forget this movie was ever made. However, there are those of us in the middle who didn't find this movie to be a complete waste of time and rather enjoyable on occasion. The special effects (namely Jason's upgrade) were quite decent in a very tight budget sort of way, some of the deaths were rather clever, some of the characters weren't too annoying and it's always fun to see our fave hockey masked psycho killer slicing and dicing no matter where he's at. Sadly though, the bad points of the movie completely out weigh the good ones. Some of the same explosions seemed to be used multiple times which is a sign of a super low budget (note for future reference: don't make films with explosions if you can't afford them), the actors were all terrible and most of the characters totally unlikable, Jason seems to act like a lost puppy in a strange part of town on the spaceship in this sequel, the prettiest girl (and one who shows most potential) in the movie is killed off first, the script and dialogue are BAD, the concept is cheesy and unoriginal and loyal Friday The 13th fans are all but forgotten in this film which was obviously made to cash in on the horror craze which ended years ago. It's evident in the theatrical trailer which features Drowning Pool's hit song Bodies (a great song btw) that this film is trying to bring in a whole new audience. Those of us who long for the Jason Vorhees of the 80's who stalked helpless campers deep in the woods of Crystal Lake while making the infamous kill kill kill ah ah ah sound will have to wait for the 11th outing. On one final bright note, I'm sure the DVD will please some people with lots of special features and documentaries not currently found on any other Friday The 13th DVDs. If you liked the film which I only sort of did, buy it. If you haven't seen it, I urge you to rent it first.",1028332800,,2102,4.392307692307693
1749299,4,B00006FI0S,"Seeing this movie twice is a luxary for me yet I have to admit that this movie is totally different from Jason Goes to Hell.
I am sorry to that this flick did less cash than its other predecessors and I have to admit that it was a little better than some of the FT13 flicks in the long run. The technology in this flick was unbelievable! I only wish that whatever technology that is what we see in the movies can only be applied in real life.
KW, man she kicks serious butt and I give that fight scene a 10 on the martial arts frontier. Look out Sigourney Weaver! Other than that if the producers of Halloween need someone to get rid of Micheal Myers, hire KM, she'll do the job real well (just avoid any emergency rooms or state of the art recupe facilities while you are at it).

While waiting, I had the opportunity to check out the script, and I started to think this is not going to go over well. It's just a rehash of everything else: SEX, LANGUAGE and KILLINGS. But I still went and saw it, and was surprised! I thought it was cool with the opening of the film with that girl getting cryogenically frozen with Jason, and then many years later getting thawed out. Once Jaosn was thawed out, he started killing and there were some pretty good killings. In closing, with the way the film ended, I'm hoping that they don't do a Part 11. It's time to put this franchise to rest.",1027296000,,716,4.311111111111111

1749339,5,B00006FI0S,Whatis there to say about a brilliant think piece on the danger of cryo genics? First of all it was the single most brilliant piece of work to ever hold a very special place in my heart...it has touched me in a way that in many sttes is illegal and when the movie ended it took a little piece of my heart with it. Second of all if JAson Voorhies doesn''t belong in the future than nobody does... a future without Jason is no future at all. THe story was brilliant and the plot could not have developed in a better way. The dialog was beutifully written and the character development really helped me to relate and for those few hours in the theater I was gripped by the same fear that held the herooine of the story until she thankfully triumphed. I will leave you with one last piece of advice: get in as much hockey as possible before the year 2025 arrives.,1026950400,,859,4.2439024390243905
1749340,5,B00006FI0S,"Let me start off by saying I do alot of reviews for cds instead of movies but, when it comes to Friday The 13th I have got to review it. I am a big Friday The 13th fan and I have been one ever since I saw Part 1 on television! I saw this the day it hit theaters! The plot is a space team have recovered Jason's body at Camp Crystal Lake and he is now locked up. He has killed 191 people or more. Some idiot goes up to him and he breaks out! Yes! He then kills everyone in the room except for a girl. He then looks in a frezzer to see if she is in there. She locks him in and pushes a button to frezze him. Him stabs her through the door and she dies. Then a few years into the future a team find her and have equipment that can bring her back to life. They said that there was no way to bring Jason back. They bring that girl back to life but, Jason unfrezzes and kills a woman in the room in a cool way! Then Jason kills almost everyone on the ship but, there is a robot that has all kinds of guns. She beats Jason up and she eventually blows his head off. This is where you think he is dead but, not for long. One of those machines brings him back to life and gives him an upgrade. He is unstoppable! The team get out in a pod and the leader or somebody flies into him in an astronaut suit. They land in Crystal Lake which is where the next film should take place! This is an excellent Slasher film and on of the best Jason films around go see it! I can't wait for DVD to come out because, I'm getting it!",1026950400,,1507,3.787301587301587
1749341,1,B00006FI0S,"I'm one of the biggest Friday the 13th fans, but this was completely ridiculus. I went into the theater thinking, ""wow, I think this is going to be the best one yet"". After 45 minutes I left. Yes, the way Jason Voorhees (Kane Hodder) sliced up people was diffrent. But that doesnt make a horror movie. The aliens, the time travel, the rebuilding of a human body, its all pathedic. Well, this franchise should be fed to the dogs now. Considering I loved 'Jason Goes To Hell', which most people hated, then you must agree with me here. This sinks quicker then it starts! Avoid this and rent the original nine previous volumes of the Camp Crystal Lake horrors.",1026691200,2,657,4.529411764705882
1749342,5,B00006FI0S,"Could this be the best movie ever? No, not really, but when you go to see a movie called ""Jason X"", your expectations have to be mighty low. So to see such a brilliant piece of film just shattered my beliefs on badness of a movie.
I think badness in movies runs in a circle. Toward one direction [clockwise] is goodness of a movie. Toward the other direction is badness. ""Jason X"" goes counterclockwise so much that it winds up on the good half. THAT is how beautiful it is. That song ""Let the Bodies Hit the Flo"" is awesome as well. NOT!",1026604800,,538,4.233009708737864
1749343,1,B00006FI0S,"OMG!!  this was absolutely the dumbest movie I've ever seen. What a piece of [pooh](Kane hodder should be ashamed of himself)
Too much humor I thought. The uber-jason section was ok, but also dumb. The costume is not creepy, it's more cyborg-ish. Best part was the Crystal lake hologram. That was meant to be funny and it was. If they do another one (and I hope they don't) Make it horrific, scary as hell. no humor(or a very small dose of it) Use back story. I fear the series is really over.",1026432000,2,493,4.358695652173913
1749344,2,B00006FI0S,"As a great fan of the Friday series, I got a big kick out of the trailers for ""Jason X"". When all long-running horror series seem to have run their course, where can you possibly go with it? Duh. Space. Fine. I saw ""Leprachaun In Space"", and I wasn't horribly disappointed by that. But the Friday people really [messed up] on this one. And it was a no brainer: lots of gory and creative murder and mayhem--that's all they needed. It is a horror sequel, and the rules state it must have more of this gore than any previous installment to earn its kudos.
In the trailer, my favorite moment was when one character shouts back to the rest, ""It's okay! He just wanted his machete back!"" I paid my nine bucks to see that guy get his head chopped off by the looming Jason Vorhees. Did I get that visual? No.
Sure, the plot made no sense, the acting was awful, the direction would have been better executed by a sickly monkey. But this wasn't why I was so aggravated with this movie. Why didn't I get to see that guy's head go flying? They didn't have the budget? They had to trim the violence for an ""R"" rating? Why?
You make a Friday movie, you've got to have all the gore and then some. Yes, there were two creative killings (one with a giant corkscrew and the other involving some liquid nitrogen) but that does not a ninety minute movie make. The people at New Line Cinema should be ashamed of themselves.

1749345,3,B00006FI0S,"I'm a person that usually doesn't explain the movie since a lot of the reviews already explain it, instead i tell my thoughts about movies! Jason X was ok, not great not bad. I did have my hopes all the way up for this movie and left my computer somewhat dissapointed. The first thing that i did not understand was how they got him back from hell... that was the most important question i was looking for. The acting is pretty bad but also funny not to mention some of the killing scenes they are hilariouse. i personally enjoyed the ultimate Jason (looks more like a robot) but i hope if they make another they will not keep the look he had, it was not scary it was just more like ""WOW he looks awesome!"" instead ""Oh my god he's so ugly and scary!"" So to put it this way Story = Ok, Acting = Horrible, Blood = Good, Killings = Good, Jason = Pretty Good besides the look somewhat!!! Just rent it when it comes out or if your a big Jason Fan watch it in theatres",1025481600,2,961,4.117021276595745
1749346,2,B00006FI0S,"Like a lot of movies out there, there are people who will like the movie, or have total distaste for it. Jason X is one of those movies. After nine sequels, it's got to be pretty hard to think of something to keep a franchise fresh and new. Especially if your last sequel was almost a decade ago. Todd Farmer (writer) came up with the idea to place Jason in space and put a group of scientific teenagers up against him. Sounds entertaining enough yes? Of course! If it wasn't already done in Leprechaun In Space or that very bad Hellraiser movie that also took place in space. But, me being the movie lover I am and being a fan of the Friday the 13th films, I gave Jason X the benefit of a doubt and saw it on opening weekend. I was only half pleased.
 The first half of the film actually had me wanting to leave the theatre. I can count on one, well, with one finger how many entertaining moments there was for me in the first half. I began to get into Jason X when android girl, Kay-Em 14 (Lisa Ryder), found out she could kick Jason's butt. Their duel made for quite an entertaining watch. But she makes a mistake, by throwing him into a machine that makes him Uber-Jason. For me, this is when the film picked up as the remaining live ones run for their lives from the unbeatable Uber-Jason. Among the many disposable characters, I believe I found 2 that I could generally like. Or well, I absolutely loved Melyssa Ade's Janessa. She was full of spunk and had many good lines. I believe she and the last 40 or 30 minutes of the film is what's going to have me buying the dvd when it's released. I must make note that James Isaac did make good of use of shadows and spaceship lighting in the stalk scenes. That made for a bit more suspense.
 Jason X will undoubtedly become a forgettable part of the Friday the 13th series, and that's such a shame. It could have been better. Or not . . .",1025222400,2,1890,4.218232044198895
1749347,2,B00006FI0S,"After originally hearing the plotline of Jason X about a year ago, the idea of having Jason Vorhees in space striked me as very idiotic.  How did they sell this plot, honestly? Jason became a pop culture icon in the early 80s and was known worldwide for stalking and killing horny teenages at Camp Crystal Lake.  While all the sequels weren't exactly stellar movies, the formula seemed to work well enough to pave the road for another sequel.  They didn't all contain a great cast, or great storylines for that matter, but they did provide somewhat satisfying entertainment.  Jason X, didn't hardly have that.  After hearing the plotline, I immediately thought of how ridiculous it sounded and how horrible it would be.  Then, I decided to keep an open mind.  At least they were attempting something new with this very dead and exhausted franchise.  And I couldn't help getting excited when I thought about the 80's Slashers possibly making a comeback.  I allowed myself to develop hopes for this movie, and actually started anticipating its release.  When I first saw the trailer, it looked amazingly good.  My hopes for this film became very high.  Jason in Space?  Heck, it may actually be good!  Shame on me.
What was I thinking?  This movie was hardly watchable.  My friends and I were competing on who could release the most yawns during this snoozefest.  It starts off as Jason in the year 2010, and he is cryogenically frozen alive only to be found several centuries in the future.  His frozen body is then taken aboard a spaceship where he thaws out and starts stalking people once again.  It was hardly believable, but then again, the whole series wasn't believable, so I didn't hold that against it.  The series contained some of the worst acting, worst storylines, and worst dialogue ever produced.  But most of them were at least enjoyable and considered by many as 'classics'.  But, there was something very different and wrong about this movie.  I don't know if taking him into space was overdoing it or what, but this movie is just plain bad.  Not ""guilty pleasure"" bad as were its predecessors, but this was just bad all around.
There were a few saving points however.  There is one flashback type scene that is a somewhat of an ode to Camp Crystal Lake.  It was certainly a joy and refreshment to see this scene, but it didn't last long, and it's one of the only saving points of this movie.  However, there are also maybe one or two characters that you actually develop emotions for in this film.  But, ultimately, this movie has got to be the worst film in the series.  If you're going to do a Jason movie, do it right.  Take him back to Camp Crystal Lake where he belongs.
I wouldn't waste much money on this movie.  It may not be bad to shell out a few bucks at the rental store when it's released if you're a loyal fan of the franchise, and want to see how it's continued, but I definitely wouldn't recommend it for multiple viewing.",1025136000,2,2956,4.605363984674329

1749423,5,B00006FI0S,"Well, any entry in the FRIDAY THE 13TH franchise is welcome by me!  I am not very picky when it comes to movies of a genre/premise that I like, particularly these.  However, from a critical point of view, they really blew it.
They tried to too hard to make it a self-parody.  For all you directors out there who are making horror films, let me give you some free advice: don't EVER make them satires!  They don't call them horror movies for nothing.  They are supposed to be scary, not funny.  Also, the acting was pretty poor.  When the crew members on their walkie-talkies found out that someone had been killed, they were more like ""oh well, that's life"" instead of being genuinly grief-stricken.  Also, some black dude in this movie amazingly retains his sarcasm, even when he has a spike in his ribs.  ""It's going to take more than that"", he says.  He then gets another spike and says, ""Yep!  That oughta do it!""
As far as Harry Manfredini's score goes, it started out very well in the beginning credits, but it went downhill from there.  In parts where the music should burst to life, it doesn't.  It also sounds more like a video game soundtrack.  For those that have heard the JASON GOES TO HELL soundtrack, just imagine the corniness multiplied by 2, then you got JASON X.  His last great FRIDAY THE 13TH score was FRIDAY THE 13TH PART VI: JASON LIVES, but he just can't seem to get away from them synthesizers and back to traditional orchestra.
They made this movie seem like it was going to be a unique entry in the series, and I loved it!  I am just saying, whatever those pesky critics say this time, I can't really blame them.  But from my P.O.V., it was pretty good.  Some of the satire parts were not even that bad, especially when Jason goes to virtual reality Crystal Lake.  I laughed myself silly, even though they made Jason looked like a clown.  It's too bad Betsy Palmer turned down the part to appear in a cameo in that scene, because it might have redeemed the whole movie a little.",1021852800,4,2006,4.443835616438356

In Jason Goes To Hell, Jason well duh goes to hell, so I was hoping for some sort of explanation to him no longer being in hell, how did he get out of hell?  No explanation at all.  He just ends up being chained up at the Crystal Lake Research Facility.  Ignoring that, I really enjoyed the movie.

The sript and the acting were the stuff of straight-to-video. The moive starts out with an interesting concept and a very cool visual style - but once we get Jason unfrozen on the ship, it all goes to hell. Lets' see - in outer space with an android, a strong female lead, a man whose main focus is money and a creature hell-bent on killing everyone. Sounds familiar? Belive me, the formula worked much better in Alien than it does here. Save your money - if you really need to see this, it should be on video and dvd next month.",1020470400,,692,4.1716417910447765

The first death was really cool, but after that it got pretty bad.  umm I'd go to see it again just because Lisa Ryder is in it playing an android. She's awesome and funny in this.  This horror movie is made 70's style 400 years in the future. it's pretty cheesy, but you're gonna hear more pathetic laughs then frightened screams this time around.",1020470400,,425,4.423076923076923

There was absolutely no attempt at creating suspense or characters anyone gives a damn about.  Jason as a money making prostitute.  Now this is a new concept.  Jason in space reduces him to nothing more than this.  I'm a fan, or at least I was.  Jim Issac should never, ever be allowed to direct a horror film again.

THis is a VERY good action/horror movie. It starts in 2010 in Crystal Lake where Jason is being held captive and is about to be transported by the Army. Jason escapes but is frozen with a girl in a chamber. THey both are discovered more than 400 years later, by a spaceship of earthlings. Earth 1 is uninhabitable and they are to be transported to Earth 2. THis is great imagination and some very fresh story-telling. As expected Jason thaws out and runs amuck. THe kills here are spectacular! Jason kills one girl by freezing her head and then shattering it!! The directors and producers of this film did a magnificent job in giving new life to this over 20 year old franchise. THey didn't just make another sequel, they wove a great story with some great action and some good old-fashioned stalker horror thrown in. ANd this is after all a Jason film so at the end as a bonus they tie in the Crystal Lake origins to the film. THe ending is really over the top and I won't give it away because its THAT good! GO see this film in the theater if you get a chance, its a great movie for all us old-time Jason fans to get into, lets hope they make more Jason films!",1020124800,9,1338,4.21011673151751

1749576,5,B00006FI0S,"I saw ""Jason X"" in the theater a couple of days ago, and I found out that this was better than the disappointing ""Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday"" and the so-called ""Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter (Part 4)"" from a few years back. To me, this is the best Jason film of the entire series because you get to see a side of Jason that you've never seen before...as an upgraded cyborg which makes him more stronger than ever! ""Jason X"" takes place in the year 2455. Jason Voorhees (once again played by Kane Hodder) has been cryogenically frozen 500 years ago. But now, when a group of students finds him and takes him and another woman named Rowan (Lexa Doig) aboard their ship, they think that Jason and Rowan are the finds of the century, etc. But when Jason is all thawed up, all hell breaks loose aboard the ship as Jason goes back to what he does best...slicing and dicing and then some! And basically, it is up to Rowan and the students to fight back, etc. But they weren't prepared for what they had in store when Jason was transformed into a cyborg, aptly named ""Uber-Jason""! And the movie goes on from there! All I have to say is that ""Jason X"" still delivers all of the thrills and chills that you'd expect from a Jason movie, but with a bit of a comical side as well(you'll know what I mean when Uber-Jason is inside of a hologram of Camp Crystal Lake circa 1980 involving him and two girls). With a great cast (including Lisa Ryder as a [kickin'] android named Kay-Em 14), and lots of suspense, and a few unexpected laughs, you'll agree that ""Jason X"" is truly one of the best horror flicks of 2002! A great DVD addition to the other ""Friday the 13th"" films!",1020124800,,1674,4.334394904458598
1749577,5,B00006FI0S,"SOme may say that this old dog is dead.  However movie makers and fans seem to disagree as Jason Voorhees returns and badder than ever.
The story starts off with Jason Chained up awaiting his punishment.  He is to be crygenetically frozen for all time, or until they can find a way to destroy him (like never).  However the GOvernment has other plans and decide to take him away and discover why his cells can recreate themselves so incredibly rapidly, making him virtually immortal.  Jason Kills them but ends up in the cryogenic chamber by the skills of female scientist.
Flash Forward to 2452 where a team of student scientist are visiting the ruins of the laboratory seen in the beggining.  Earth is a vanquished wasteland, however there is Earth 2.  Inside they discover both Jason Voorhees and the Scientist Frozen.  They take the two back to their station and revive the girl and decide to experiment on Voorhees.  Due to some unlikely assistance from a couple having sex Jason is revived and continues his killing spree.
All of that is in the first half hour.  Now what makes this movie truely great is how funny it is.  I am dead seriouse this movie is hokey, full of silly cliches, one liners, and over the top goofeyness.  What is even funnier is that this was done on purpose.  the producers and writers purposl;y made this hokey and funny just because they didn't want the same old same old.  Despite the fact that this chapter has the highest body count (15-20 easy) this is so funny, enjoyable, and of course gory that you can't resist but loving this movie.  A cult classic all the way, and easily one of the best in the series.",1020124800,,1644,4.566552901023891

I'm a HUGE friday fan and I was wary about the space setting, but trust me, it doesn't take away from the movie at all.

1749580,4,B00006FI0S,"Jason X is a very entertaining and somewhat stylish horror movie. It's not exactly ""true"" to the long running series, but the movie is fun, none-the-less. Overall, the killing scenes were very cool this time around. A little more inventive than the usual Jason hack and slash. The acting was decent for a movie of this type and the charcters were, for the most part, believable. One of the real winners here is the set designs. For a movie that would thought to have a very low budget, the sets and visual effects were quite impressive. One of my fav. scenes in the movie is the virtual flashback to Camp Crystal Lake circa 1980. (Although I think they could have expanded that scene and made it a little better.) But it contains one of the best scenes in the movie. The sleeping bag scene (you'll know it when you see it! Very funny) I was about half and half on the humor. Some of it made me laugh and some was just stupid. You'll have to judge that for yourself.
There was also some very nice eye candy in the film. The lead actress who was frozen with Jason in the beginning is absolutely stunning and I hope to see her in some more films soon.
I also liked the idea of Jason being upgraded. It was a nice little twist on the film and it gave us a chance to see Jason in a somewhat different light after 7 films of the ""same-old"" Again, this is something, I think they could have expanded on, but it wasn't bad the way they did it either.
As far as suspense and ""jumps"" go, there wasn't that much of that, which is where I feel, Jason X runs short. One of the greatest things about the previous Friday the 13th films is all of the ""jump"" scenes. There wasn't much of that all and the overall ""fear"" atmosphere left a little to be desired.
Looking at the movie in a whole, I give it 4 stars. As it was entertaining, fun to watch, had some nice eye candy, a different twist on the Jason legacy and the first time we've gotten to see good ol' Jason in a decade or so. So Welcome Back Jason!",1020038400,2,1991,4.201044386422977
1749581,2,B00006FI0S,"Though this film is better than the last two sequels, there just isn't much to recommend here.  Sure, the change of setting is nice and the spfx are generally well-done. However, Jason has become such a gooey lump of bone and rotted flesh that he just isn't scary anymore.  He looks like a walking meatloaf, not too scary of an image unless you just really hate meatloaf.  Also, I hated the fact that the same horny, brain dead teenagers were still running loose all of those years into the future.  Perhaps that's part of the F13 formula but, the intention to revamp the series with a sci-fi setting just doesn't jibe too well with cliched characters and situations that grew stale almost two decades ago.  Some of the action is okay (excepting the colossal plot hole that allows 300 LB Jason to sneak up on people and disappear like some kind of undead Shaolin monk.) but, can't compare to Cameron's work in Aliens, a major influence on this picture.  Even the score sounds tired, lacking the pervasive creepiness of previous Friday scores.  All in all, this is one tired entry in an increasingly decrepit series.",1020038400,,1115,4.687179487179487
1749582,4,B00006FI0S,"Tossing all sorry attempts at serious criticism aside (if I didn't this entertaining piece ...would get one star), I have to say that Jason X may well be the greatest Friday the 13th sequel ever!  Just keep in mind that between the words greatest and sequel ever is the title Friday the 13th, so you know what kind of quality to expect.  Plot?  The unkillable Jason Voorhees is frozen, along with his almost ""final"" victim, for some 455 years before getting thawed out on a spaceship filled with saucy babes and tough grunts.  Well rested from his 455 year ice nap, Jason quickly gets up and gets to business killing anyone unfortunate enough to get near him.  The movie itself has moments of wit and a few nice in-jokes sprinkled throughout its first hour (choice moments include cameos by David Cronenberg and Robert Silverberg, and references to Alien), but it really gets cooking in the final half hour.  Friday fans will find this a tough act to dislike, serious horror fans will no doubt shake their heads and wonder why this ... is still getting produced.  My answer?  Why ask why, just have fun with it!  Recommended for Jasonites everywhere.",1020038400,,1150,4.71
1749583,1,B00006FI0S,"I have been a fan of this franchise for quite a while.  I didn't expect much with this movie, and I didn't get much.  It has some of the worst acting in the series.  Jason does not offer anything new, just the same old stuff, only in space.  Oh by the way, I walked out of the movie at the 1 hour mark.  I dought very much if I missed anything of value.",1019952000,,353,3.780821917808219
1749584,5,B00006FI0S,"To be honest, I have to admit I have a soft spot for the good old Jason Days of the 1980s, when he stayed primarily in the shadows and leapt out only to scare the life out of his chosen victims, that lovely hockey mask in full view. That said, when I went to see this movie with my brother on opening day, I tried to tell myself that a new take on old Mr. Voorhees could be a good thing; breathing life into a tired old franchise and all that. Well, I was not disappointed, and in fact I was pretty amazed at how good this movie was. Before going to see it, I had checked out some reviews on the Rotten Tomatoes website and most of those people said it was horrible! I really can't see why. Jason in this film may not be as terrifying as Final Chapter Jason, but he more than makes up for that in brute strength.
Also, the main characters in this movie - really, every character - are not nearly as annoying or tremendously stupid as most in a splatter flick. In this movie, if you're wondering why they simply don't flee into the woods and head for a local highway once Jason explodes onto the scene, (or through your bedroom door) it's because there simply isn't anywhere to go on this Alien-like spaceship. They're trapped in a cage of their own making, and Jason has a grand old time. Of course this movie isn't Shakespeare, but that can be said of most Hollywood movies these days. What this is is a good movie that actually - gasp! - pays genuine tribute to the horror movies of the 1970s and 1980s: not by throwing in scantily clad young women, though there are a few, or endless referrences to alcohol (note the scene when Jason gets a taste of home circa Crystal Lake Data File, Summer 1980) but by the 1980 camp scene complete with two girls who have perfect Ginny Fields/Chris Higgens hairstyles and an ominous cabin in the background or the laugh out loud ending, which you'll have to see to believe.
Rowan (Lexa Doig) is a sympathetic and attractive lead girl, and it seemed she actually cared enough about her role in this movie to use some acting talent and not her vocal cords. In the opening scenes of the film, when Jason is about to be transported to another facility by some destined-to-be-doomed military thugs, we see that she is being set up to assume the role of lead Jason killer later on.
Here's something else you should appreciate: all referrences to the infamous Hell Baby of Jason Goes To Hell have been eliminated, thank the lord. Jason is no longer an alien hiding in a hulking man's body but a human being who is just a complete bad[guy] The abuse he takes in this movie while the survivors of the spaceship Grendel try to escape is wicked. He gets messed up in this more than any movie since the last one of almost ten years ago, (Whoa...it hasn't been that long, has it?) when the SWAT team took him down.
In closing, this being the first time I've seen Jason's adventures on the big screen, I must report that the people involved in making this really seemed to care about producing something more than just a mindless Scream clone, of which there is ample supply. The script holds your attention, and while there is no grand finale chase scene ending in a spooky old barn, the many kills and sometimes funny dialogue (Gonna have to hurt you now, baby) make this a real treat. Go see it and munch some popcorn. Take your brother and then talk about it with him on the ride home.
Five out of five stars just because I really don't think any Friday the 13th movie has ever gotten that, ...
P.S. Look for the tense scene toward the end when Rowan, relying on her knowledge of 20th Century popular sci-fi entertainment, asks one of the future guys why they can't just Beam Away! His response: WHAT?
It's classic, or as close as the movie business can come in this post-creepy atmosphere, grainy picture horror world.",1019865600,,3848,4.3983169705469845

Guess who gets thawed and goes on a killing rampage? 10th entry (!) in this very long running slasher series is played almost entirely for laughs, and while it takes way too long to get going (half-way through is when it gets really funny), this is hilarious, fast-paced gory fun for the last forty-five minutes. Kudos to Peter Mensah for a decent performance as the likeable head soldier and a sexy Lexa Doig as the heroine (who, unfortunately, doesn't get the chance to kick that much ...).

It would have been one thing if the latest installment of Friday the 13th could've at least made fun of itself, but that couldn't even be achieved.  The only good things about this movie was the quality of female cast members, and some reasonably decent killings done with practical effects.  For a time when CG in movies has gotten so good, Jason X failed in that department as well, with horribly executed CG scenes and simply bad design.  If there are any plans for a part 11 in this series, they should take a serious step back and re-evaluate, as well as shoot Farmer who wrote this [awful] script.",1019865600,2,640,4.587719298245614
1749627,1,B00006FI0S,"In every horror series there is a sequel that hard core fans ignore. A Nightmare on Elm Street 2, Halloween 3 & 6, Friday the 13th Part 8,9, and now Jason X. I went into this with low expectations expecting to like it a little. But I was so wrong. Ignore this film at all costs.
Why did this utterly horrible script get greenlit by the powers that be at New Line?
Here is the story, They decide since they can't kill Jason they should freeze him until they can find a way to kill him. After a sequence that rips off ""The Silence of the Lambs"" the chick from Andromeda gets to freeze him, but not without getting stabbed in the process and getting freezed herself.
They are found by a group of students in 2455. And the morons bring them on board their ship The Grendel. They revive Andromeda girl and experiment on Jason. Of course Jay wakes up and kills again.
A few things about the future, Teens are sex hungry, there must be an Urban Outfitters Super-Store on moon base 2, because the girls have their bellys exposed, and the guys look like freestyle dancers in a male disco club with their tank tops and leather pants. The wardrobe was horrible.
The flim flam that other people have been spewing about inventive deaths is a sham. Jason hacks with no suspense and for the most part you don't see anything. A girl gets her head frozen and smashed, big deal it was wack. A guy impaled on a spiral and spins down, oooh that was exciting. Of course you can tell I'm being sarcastic. There were no innovative deaths what so ever. ""Final Destination"" had more inventive deaths. Jason X doesn't. And he kills so many people that you are bored.
The music by Harry Manfredini, a Friday veteran was awful. You don't hear the signature Friday music until the VR Crystal Lake sequence toward the end of the flick.
The editing was jumpy and looked like a first year film student edited the flick.
The special effects also seemed to be done by the SFX team from Hercules and Xena: Warrior Princess.
The actors seemed to have taken lessons at the Markie Post school of acting. Horrible. Oh and did I mention they were annoying too.
The scene where that other chick from Andromeda beats jason up was so corny. She looked like Lydia's mom in ""Beetle Juice"" with a leather dominatrix outfit. It was so bad that at this part people started walking out the theater.
Now to the UBER Jason everyone has been talking about. This is when the series was shot straight to the land of fire and brimstone. He looks like Lord Zed from ""The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers."" He's not at all scary and I was ready to leave the theater at that part.
The only good scene in the entire movie comes in the flicks last ten minutes. Jason is distracted by a hologram of Crystal Lake, and in this scene you wonder aloud why the movie did not stay in Crystal Lake to begin with.
Finally, the movie ends with a silly epilogue. Jason landing on Earth 2. This is when the audience booed aloud and left the theater upset.
The bottom line, to me the Friday series was not a cinematic gem. But they were enjoyable. Part 1 through 4 were the best, Part 5 was ok, and Part 6 marked the begining of Jason becomming a supernatural character. Part 6 was good, Part 7 tried something new, and for the most part the story of Tina Shepard vs Jason was refreshing. But The New Blood was the last good Jason flick. The producers have become so concerned with breathing new life into the series that they jacked up the franchise in the process.
Friday 8 was a waste of a good Idea with Jay going to New York, but that wound up being horrible. And Jason Goes To Hell: The Final Friday turned Jason into some parasitic demon, horrible. When will producers and writers learn to keep things simple. Do we always have to over explain why Jason keeps comming back. I bet if you tell the real explanation, The producers wanted more money, the audience wouldn't care.
When was the last time a flick about a killer in a camp came out? They should have sticked to the Jason formula. Jason does not belong in outerspace.
Another thing that killed the flick out side of it being horrible, was the trailer for ""Halloween: Ressurection"" that preceded it. The trailer had the audience amped.  Thankfully Michael Myers won't be stalking his victims with a lightsaber in that flick.
Poor Jason, he has been reduced to a big joke. Note to the producers, If the script to Jason vs Freddy is this bad, don't make that film and destroy the ""Nightmare"" franchise. Please don't taint Freddy's Image like that, it would be wrong.",1019865600,2,4550,4.442583732057416
1749628,5,B00006FI0S,"I have entertained the possibility that the proceedings are an internal criticism of the parody horror (ie Scream), but it is far more aimed toward the goal of fan indulgence.  Honestly, there are practically no people who enjoyed the series to this point who actually wanted Jason to die, much less genuinely terrify them...fright, and its ideal aftermath are far more lucrative, anyway, as a means to get laid as opposed to emotional betterment.
That being said, the film is actually more successful as a comedy as opposed to a traditional gorefest.  There is plently of gore involved (think of an outspread incarnation of the suicide-booths from Futurama), but the tone of the film is like a blend of Event Horizon and Scary Movie - it uses its own traditional emptiness of ""proper"" film elements - the most overrated of which is character development - to make sport of the continuing barrage.  Those of you who are fans of the series should be advised that while the dialogue has by no means slacked from the older films (it has a bit more ""youthful punch""), there is a slight, though noticable level of corniness in its brevity.  However, it just makes the show more of an escape from any responsibility we endure in the standard world.
That, essentially, is what any film worth the stock its imprinted on can do - transport you away from the annoyance you have to deal with.  On that note, and not to further annoy anyone whose expectations were prematurely harvested by the MASSIVE amount of spoilers out there, the show does exactly what it set out to do:  have a bunch of hot chicks and equally superficial guys screw (and get screwed), jog around with pointless yelling, and ultimately, die in adrenalinic applause from the devoted crowd...

1749629,3,B00006FI0S,"I am a huge fan of the Friday The 13th Movies and own every one of them. Jason has been around since i was a little kid. Now it was over nine years since the last Friday The 13th (Jason Goes To Hell) was out in 1993. Tonight I saw JASON X which takes place mostly in space in the year 2455. I have to say this is not my favorite movie in the series. Jason X is an entertaining and a funny film as well, but it is just to far fetched. I thought going in to see it that it would be a refreshing change from the older films, but this movie was just to future-unrealistic and out there for me. Jason X goes in the same direction that The Nightmare On Elm ST series went in to. In the first 2 or 3 Nightmare on Elm Streets Freddy Krueger was a scary guy, but from the 4th through the 6th part the series made Freddy in to a wisecracking joker with super hero like powers and less of a scary being. Thankfully Wes Craven put Freddy back to his horror roots with Wes Cravens New Nightmare. Jason X suffers this same flaw. In this new film Jason seems like some king of comic book hero when he has his body upgraded and goes through all the Virtual Reality elements. The film is not scary when compared to all the other Friday The 13ths, but it is more original but in s strange way. It's like a cross between The Matrix, The 6th Day and, Star Trek. Just to far fetched and the jokes seem like something right out of the comedy Scary Movie. This film did have some original (and attention getting) gross killing scenes and at times made you look away, but the film made me and the audience laugh with all the jokes more than it made us scared. From The funny sleeping bag scene, to the robotic women who fights Jason then gets her head cut off and carried by her creator, this was just a bit to over the top even for JASON. I will not give away the ending as it gives me much hope. I can say that with the ending in this one JASON will be back for sure but this time he will be where we all love him best, Camp Crystal Lake and on Earth. For the sake of me being a huge Friday The 13th and a huge Jason fan I will give this movie 3 stars. They intend to make a total of 13 Friday The 13th films, and I can only hope the rest take Jason back to a horror icon, rather than a comic like character in space. When it is released I will get this DVD just to add to my collection when it comes out but man was this Jason movie differant.",1019779200,2,2422,3.9448979591836735
1749630,5,B00006FI0S,"As I write this the date is April 26th and I have just returned home from JASON X.  What an awsome movie!  I've been a long time and hardcore fan of the series and JASON X is without a doubt the best sequel since JASON LIVES.  The characters are nothing special, but who cares?!  We come to a Jason movie to see Jason!  The death scenes are mind blowing and the movie is loaded with gore!  Harry Manfridini gives his BEST score to date and Jason looks sweet both as normal Jason and Ubber Jason.  The movie gets even better towards the end when it starts making fun of itself, and the virtual reality scene in camp crystal lake is pure cinema magic!  JASON X proves that even a Part 10 can still re-invent a franchise!  Did I also mention that JASON X is actually scary?!",1019779200,,771,4.226027397260274

1749632,3,B00006FI0S,"Well...thi movie certainly was interesting.  I found it fairly entertaining, i mean, its Jason Voorhees killing people, right?  But it was weird for me, being a long time Friday the 13th fan, seeing this one, him being all ""upgraded"" and stuff.  It just didn't follow the old ones in that aspect.  But if your new to the series, and have seen few/none of the original movies, than im sure you would enjoy this.  It VERY action packed, and theres much blood and gore.  I really didn't find myself becoming scared at all in this movie, which is definately a downside.  Although i did find one certain scene in this movie EXTREMELY funny, he has a girl in a sleeping bag and hes swinging her like a sack of potatoes onto another girl in a sleeping bag whos on the floor screaming, then he throws the sleeping bag into a tree, and the sleeping bags cease to move...that scene i found really really funny.  The sound in the movie i found AWESOME, so thats a plus. But it is definately worth the money to see it in the theatres, but im not so sure about the [price] for the dvd. I'm going to buy it though just becuase it's still technically Friday the 13th part 10, so i need it in my collection.  Hope this helps!",1019347200,6,1209,4.337777777777778
1749633,4,B00006FI0S,"Just got my hands on a copy of Jason X, coming out next week.  And as a fan, this doesn't disappoint in the least.  You want gore?  You got plenty.  Some of the most creative deaths happen here.  How about sex?  Sure, you got it.  Even the sex has a little extra spin on it, thanks to Todd Farmer actually giving a damn about the quality of the script.  Farmer and director Jim Isaac compensate for any obviously lacking common sense by making sure their audience is entertained through the whole 90 minutes.  And for that, they definitely succeed.  The clincher has to be the hologram scene that comes near the end.  I won't say what it is, but it's a reminder of how far Jason Voorhees has come.
I tell the fans this.  Please go into this movie with an open mind.  Dont think that this is gonna be the worst out of all of them and disregard it as SpaceCamp Crystal Lake.  And please don't demand the old Jason.  Weve had the old Jason for eight movies, for Christs sakes!  Its time to move on.  Its time to give the man something new.  Enough of the I hear something in the pitch black basement, so I better light a candle and see what it is.  Been there, done that.
The worst thing you can do is bore your audience, and the best way to do that is to keep telling the same story.  This is not a continuing saga anymore.  Paramount did that.  But this is New Lines baby now, and they should be applauded for caring about the character enough to want to do something new and exciting with him.  Think of this now as an anthology series with the same character in the center of new situations, and you should be okay.",1019347200,4,1616,4.209150326797386

Obviously Jason X seems to be set long after that.. but who knows? If Freddy and Jason met in hell prior to this film it seems that Jason was the victor. but it still could go either way.

The movie starts off quite well despite the whole thing about lack of continuity. Jason is in chains, gets loose, and kills people.  It is at this point in the movie that David Cronenberg can be seen in a cool cameo.
400 years after being tricked into a cryogenic freezing chamber, Jason and his would-be victim are thawed out by some students on a spaceship visiting 'old earth'.  The majority of the kills take place here on the ship.
The deaths are at times entertaining but some are pretty straightforward.
I agree with some of the statements about the rotten acting in this movie.  It isn't that great.  I don't suppose that is the point though.
I won't mention any specifics but the good does outweigh the bad in this movie.
The action heats up towards the end after a bit of a slump in the middle and things get interesting.  Jason's new look is a pretty nifty idea but I can't say I'd like it to stay that way if they decide to make more of these movies.  It was fun to see though.
Overall, this is worth seeing but it is more in line with parts 3, 7, 8, and 9.  If you're a Friday fanatic that won't make any difference to you.",1018396800,4,1140,4.25

When it was finished downloading, I immediately watched it and didn't get what i wanted from this film.  I mean, Kane Hodder was excellent in this film, but the other actors needed alittle more work, though. I liked watching it, but later when we get into the end, it kind of goes downhill. So, if you like just slasher, horror flicks, this is the movie for you.  I have seen all the Jason's and i think this is by the most entertaining, not scary, but entertaining.",1018310400,,633,4.25

1749679,3,B00006FI0S,"I viewed a advance of this movie a couple days ago, and watched it again today. Ive now seen it twice and decided to write a good things bad things list for potential viewers.
Good Things: High Body Count, this movie features death's at a almost non-stop pace. It will probably rival the highest body count in movie history. New unseen before kill-types, some of his kills were just plain cool. With the futuristic flow and plot of the movie, it offerd alot of chances for high-tech kills and they took advantage of just that. New background, although  part 8 took place on a ship and Manhatten it was still nice to get out of the woods and into a new setting. New outfit, although you don't get to see much of this new outfit it was still nice to see a new high-tech mask and suit.
Bad things: Unbelievable stuff, yes I know its a horror movie and its a slasher flick, but normally its the slasher performing these unbelievable feats, in this movie even the regular human pray performed just outrages feats. For example: A man is cut in half by Jason, after they show the remaining crew's reaction of this grusome sound they cut back to where he was cut in half, and to the surprise of me he(the man cut in half) is crawling across the floor with no lower half. It left me thinking how in the heck could you do that??? Bad acting, in this movie the actors didn't seem like they were that scared of Jason. I mean this guy is coming to kill you, and they just didn't act like they were that scared. Lack of continuents, as in part 9 the directors/plot offer no explanation of how Jason was resurrected. The movie simply starts with Jason standing in chains, on a stand-up bed. And through out the movie, they don't offer any explanation of how he got that way. Boring middle of the film, although the beginning and end were exciting, the middle got slow. Maybe a result of so many kills, I mean watching someone get slashed with a blade is only interesting about 4 times in 1 movie. The whole middle of the film was basically kill after kill, I found myself sitting there thinking when is the ending going to come only a hour into the film. To sci-fi, I understand this is a movie supposedly based in the future, and at times this setting really helped the film however at times it hurt it. Sometimes the plot cut away from the ""get away from Jason"" theme to a ""Deep space"" theme. You'll find yourself wondering what to be more worried about, Jason or Space itself.
Because of these flaws it will only recieve a vote of 3 stars. Although it wasn't the best movie of the series which remains to be (1,2,4,& 6), it definetly wasn't the worst which remains to be (5,8,& 9). Jason X falls in the middle of the pack with part 3, and part 7. A couple things here and there it could have easily been up there with best in series, in same breath a few more mistakes it could have been in back of pack with worst. There were a couple things that saved this film, a great sceen that involves Crystal Lake. Without this sceen I believe it probably would have fallen to worst of the series. And of course the new Jason, without this change into ""Super"" Jason it probably wouldn't have gotten such a high mark. But you do come out satisfied, you weren't going into this film believing it was the second coming of ET or Titanic anyways. It is what it's advertised to be, a Horror/Sci-Fi slasher film for the hard-core horror fans. Even though, it lacked in the scare department as the last couple installments have done. My suggestion is to go see it for yourself, because no matter what I or any other film critic or fan says, the only person that can tell you for sure if you like it or not is you. Hope this review helped.",1017100800,,3710,4.338129496402877

Big mistake he gets loose kills people and then get trick by some woman who cryogenicly freezes him and herself by accident.
Then is goes forward to around 2450 where some students find both bodies and of course bring them on there ship to unfreeze them well the woman anyway. Then Jason regenerates and hell breaks loose, they try using marines but no chance. I won't reveal anymore because this movie is well worth watching. ...the movie has tons of great one liners my favourate being ""It's OK guys he just wanted his machette back""
So when this movie comes out be first in line, it's appropriately subtitled ""Evil Gets An Upgrade"" which indeed it does.",1016668800,,924,4.606060606060606
1749682,1,B00006FI0S,"I went to see the very entertaing Resident Evil and sat down with a couple of friends just in time to catch the previews. I love to watch the previews, a sample of the movies to remember to see. The Jason X preview appeared and the whole audience went wild. Not with fear but with laughter. ""Scary Movie 3"" I thought silently in my head. After about a minute or two of this sad excuse for a movie I realized that this was not a spoof but a real movie. ""Jason in Space"" you've gotta be kidding me! It's a sad thing these days when a horror movie can be confused with a spoof. For all that it's worth, this trailer was one good laugh!",1016323200,,632,4.064
1749683,2,B00006FI0S,"For those who haven't yet seen a pre-screening or bootleg of this movie, and are F13 fans... don't expect any more than the standard F13 formula. Yes, even though this time it's in space.
I won't run down the overall plot, because if you're a friday fan, you probably already know. But essentially it just takes the crystal lake setting, and replaces it with a space ship,- ala the cruise liner in part 8: Jason takes Manhattan.
I haven't seen the pre-screening or some version you can download off the net, I've seen the actual VHS bootleg that's been floating around Europe for several months now.
Overall... it's a mediocre affair, bordering on POOR which is why I give it 2 stars. Here's a quick rundown on why it gets 2 stars...
Acting: Acting is abysmal is this movie. It's passable, but NONE, not one of the actors either gives, or is given the chance to really stand out. Call it bad acting, or call it bad script... but what it translates to is stupid, paper thin characters you don't give a hoot about.
Plot: The plot, as usual... has the required resurrection of Jason, followed by numerous Jason style killings. Some funny, some gross, some not-so gross. This is the standard formula for Friday films, if you're okay with that, then fine, if you've been believing the hype that this is going to propel the series in a quantum leap foward, you're dreadfully mistaken... especially considering the end of the film virtually puts Jason right back where he started.
Originality: Originality is non-existent in Jason X. The imagery, action, atmosphere, special effects and pyrotechnics are all DIRECTLY derivative from science fiction movies we've all seen over the last 10-20 years.
Continuity: Continuity is YET AGAIN completely ignored. No proper explaination was given for the progrssion from part 8 to part 9, and the same has happened again with part 9 and part 10 (X).
These major flaws are why it gets 2 stars. So what are the good points? Why am I giving it 2 stars instead of 1? It doesn't have many good points, but there they are...
Cyber Jason: Jason gets a cyber upgrade, which makes him look like an extremely evil version of Robocop. This was a really nifty idea, but unfortunately, nothing was done with it. You only see Cyber Jason for about 10 minutes before he ""dies"".
Change Of Setting: Despite it's extreme lack of originality and montage of rip-offs, the change of setting is a welcome change. It will effectively change the series from ""slasher horror"" into ""slasher sci-fi horror""... but that's cool, after 9 films in 1 setting, a change is a good idea.
...So that's it. When it comes out at the movies, don't see it unless you're the insatiably curious type with nothing to do. Wait for it on video. It's not that crash-hot.",1015977600,,2757,4.698347107438017

I recommend if you can't take gore then don't watch this because there is plenty of gore and blood. It had a great ending that I wish to tell, but won't because it would ruin the whole ending.

1749727,3,B00006FI0S,"I saw this movie today, at 1:30 in the morning. And I was very excited.'Cause I love Jason and his Friday the 13th movies.
I always liked them,and watched them since I was very little, I got scared like a baby with Jason(Of course that was many years ago.
The movie starts with a great slasher beginning. Rowan(Lexa Doig) and Jason(Kane Hodder) are in the same room and only one of them will survive...No. Rowan and Jason get both frozen in time when she suddenly tryes to scape from him(The year is 2010).
After, like 400 years, this two frozen bodys are found by a goup of students. The take them to their ship and bring Rowan back to like with the new technology.
But she's not the only one that wakes up, Jason begins his large(Very large, I dare you to try to count them) body count, just after he gets up from bed.
Jason X is a real well done movie. It's visually amazing, the athmosphere it's creepy, and it's a real big step for the Friday the 13th movies.
Acting was pretty good for a Friday movie, I specially enjoyed Mellysa Ade's(Jannesa) and Lexa's(Rowan) performances.
Jannesa was like the funny character, always making sarcastic jokes.
And Rowan is the main character, she's very pretty.
But they were nothing compared to the master of Friday the 13th, that's right, I'm talking about Kane Hodder. He's perfect for Jason, he was born for becoming Jason. He's a real horror king.
What I really loved here was Crystall lake 3-D version, I mean, it was like and old Friday the 13th movie mixed up with a new one. It was just great. Uber-Jason looked awesome, but I just wanted a longer part with him.
What I really hated here was KM-14, it was so stupid!!!.
I rate this with 3 stars out of five, 'cause the movie was a little too stupid and sarcastic for a Friday movie. But I have to say that is one of the best sequels in the series.
The go like this(From great to bad)
1-Part 6(Awesome)
2-Part 4(Tommy rules!)
3-Part X(Cool)
4-Part 1(The original, but not the best)
5-Part 7(Really cool kills)
6-Part 3(Just liked it 'cause it was 3-D and Jason gets his mask in there)
7-Part 8(Loved the Manhattan secuence, the rest of the movie sucked)
8-Part 2(Not bad sequel, not great either)
9-Part 5(There's no Jason, so ther's no more to say)
10-Part 9(What a BAD movie)
JASON X it's a real horror movie for fans, but it's true. If your not a Jason fan, you'll never like this movie.
But I did, it's pure fun, I mean it doesn''t make any sense, but It was an hour and a half enterteining flick.

1749731,4,B00006FI0S,"It's been too long since a ""Friday the 13th"" film stalked the theatres, with this in mind, it gives me great pleasure to announce to all the hardcore Jason fans out there that ""Jason X"" is worth the wait.  While this isn't the best entry in the long running classic series, this film serves up enough gore and violence to entertain horror fans for 95 minutes.  Unfortunately, there's some bits sprinkled throughout this movie (and a few terrible characters too) featuring some truly stupid humor that does detract from the proceedings, but overall, there's enough to like about ""Jason X"" that should please all Friday fans out there, as well as people just looking for a fun, popcorn crunching way to enjoy an evening at the movies.
The film beings roughly around 2010 at the Crystal Lake Research Facility where Jason (Kane Hodder, returning to the role for the fourth time and giving what's probably his best turn as the killer) Voorhees has been caught and awaits cryo freeze under the supervision of Rowan (Lexa Doig).  During one of the film's best sequences (with an amusing cemeo from director David Cronenberg), Jason is freed and several bloody deaths later, he's stalking sole survivor Rowan through the facility where she outsmarts the hulking madman and traps him in a cryo freeze chamber, only to be accidentally trapped herself.
It's here that the film jumps 400 years into the future, a group
of science students on a research field trip back to what is now referred to as ""old earth"" (an uninhabital place) discover both our hero and villian still frozen and well preserved.  They are brought back onboard the ship Grendel where Rowan is thawed out, but it only takes minutes before Jason too is thawed and before long, he's off, stalking the Grendel; racking up what is sure to be the highest body count of the entire series.  As the group of people on board the ship quickly dwindle beneath Jason's blade, the remaining students and single military soldier attempt to escape the ship, Jason's terror refuses to yield, and the masked maniac has one more surprise in store for the heros...
""Jason X"" is far from the best ""Friday the 13th"" film, but it moves along at a fast enough pace and has enough moments (and some very attractive females) to keep viewers interested. Among the positive moments included are some very innovative kills and some particularly good special effects, not to mention a new although at times, refreshingly familiar, score from Friday alumni, Harry Manfredini.  There are some beautiful women in the cast (especially Lexa Doig in the lead, whose also a very good actress) and a likable soldier, the leader of the squad played by Peter Mensah.  One scene that will stand out for fans, is the virtual reality scene taking Jason back to Camp Crystal Lake during the summer of 1980.  Although the scene never lives up to its full potential with the silly actresses spouting stupid, unfunny dialogue (an attempt to poke fun at the formula these films went by in the 1980s-but failing miserably), the scene is scored with the original music from 1980's ""Friday the 13th"" and is accompanied by a murder scene which is really quite funny.  While it could've/should've been better, this scene is still one of the best, most nostalgic of the film.
Where ""Jason X"" flounders is the humor.  Aside from one really funny line describing previous attempts of kill Jason over 400 years ago, this film drops the ball in the comic reflief department.
Overall however, ""Jason X"" works.  It was fun and refreshing to see the big guy back on the screen after so many years and despite the above mentioned faults, it's a good time.  This is the tenth entry in the ""Friday the 13th"" series, while it's not the best (that honor belongs to Fridays 1,2,4 and 6) film in the series, it's at least a good time, with an ending which is VERY entertaining, and one I wouldn't dream of giving away.  When this film hits theatres (whenever that may be), it will surely provide moviegoers with a good solid 90 minutes of slasher movie fun, good and gory, like the ones they used to make!",1011484800,38,4098,4.73876404494382
1749732,5,B00006FI0S,"I was very lucky to see this film in advance of it's theatrical release and I must say that Jason X is a great movie.  At first I was skeptical because Jason in space didn't sound like a good idea.  Well, my fears are put to rest.  This movie has so much going for it!  First of all, it has a very high body count.  Someone's buying the farm every couple minutes.  This movie has action from the very beginning and never lets up.  I can't really say too much without giving away anything.  Just take my word for it.  Although Jason X may be a big change from previous Friday the 13th films, I think that any TRUE Jason fan will be very happy with this movie.  There's even a point in the movie where we actually see Jason back at good old Crystal Lake.  Go see this movie when it comes out and then you'll understand what I mean.  Even though I've already seen it I'll still see it in the theater just for the sake of seeing it on the big screen.  It'll also be great to see how other people react to the movie.

7967749,4,B00006FI0S,"This is bad in all the ways I like. Despite ignoring almost everything that ever mattered in the franchise, this was gory, had good pacing and energy, funny and clever death scenes, and was self-aware in its own raunchiness and style

This movie is the now 17-year old 9th sequel of a true slasher classic yet a classic it most certainly is not. But a guilty pleasure it was in 2001, it is in 2018, and it will be in 2118such a joyously bad movie!  So, this classlessic begins on the Crystal Lake Research Facility in space!  Yep, you heard that right.  Coming from a special effects background (e.g., Gremlins, Enemy Mine), director James Isaac (Skinwalkers, Pig Hunt) follows in the late 90s path of Hellraiser: Bloodline (1996), Leprechaun 4: In Space (1996) and Event Horizon (1997), and decides to take the Friday the 13th franchise to outer space.

Not only that, but we find Jasonwho used to become ever more grossly decomposed with each sequelperhaps in better shape (putrefaction-wise) than hes been in a while.  And not just that, but we find him ALIVEand with no electrical Frankensteinian resurrection to be witnessed.  So, for those of you keeping track at home
Jasons death and resurrection SIDEBAR:  Jason Voorhees (Kane Hodder; parts VII-X, Hatchet) has been electrically (or telekinetically) resurrected and subsequently drowned (in Crystal Lake or a NYC sewer) in parts VI-VIII.  Then Jason Goes to Hell (1993) broke any sense of rules and decided that Jason was a deadite that possessed new bodies either by heart-ingestion or wriggly mouth-to-mouth demon parasite transmission.  In that movie, he was permanently killed by his sisters daughteryup, Jason apparently had a niece.  No clue how he ended up on a space ship.

So, yeah.  Jasons back and alive and chained up on some sort of space station named after the very lake where he killed about 200 people (if we include his Manhattan graduation trip).

Franchise Timeline SIDEBAR:  So when does this movie take place???  Part 1 took place in present day (1980), parts II-IV all occur in rapid succession 5 years after the events of part 1 (so 1985), part V jumped forward 5-6 years (so 1990-1991-ish) and (probably more of a writing flaw than anything) part VI took us questionably another 10-ish years yet further into the future (soooo, 2001?).  Part VII provides no time statement, but could just as well occur in the same year as part VI.  I guess it makes sense that too much time hadnt past, or the fish and freshwater bacteria wouldve whittled him down to nothing.  So, parts VI-VII could have taken place in the same summer, and VIII is about 10 months later (into the next year; so, 2002???) since our victims are on a high school trip around graduation.  No clue on part IX, but if it was also in about 2002, then the sequels have caught up within a year of present day!  And now were going to the future. So, who even cares anymore?  Oh, right, skip to the year 2455!

Jason has greater martial prowess than weve ever seen before it must be the weaker gravity.  Hes trapped in cryofreeze in a machete-swinging attack pose (pretty sure freezing doesnt work out like that).  Then a group of space students open up his chamber and decide to thaw the huge masked mongoloid holding a machete in an attack pose!!!!!

Incontinuity SIDEBAR: My past comments (see the sidebars in my reviews of part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan and Jason Goes to Hell) about franchise inconsistency get Hulk-smashed by the nonsense transpiring before my eyes as I watch with a sort of child-like wonderous glee.  Ever since part VII: The New Blood (1988), things have grown ever more exponentially bonkers and I couldn't be happier.  Continuity out the windowfrom deadite destroyed by prophecy in IX to whatever he is now, Jason X and Freddy vs Jason violate the rules and timeline that perhaps once mattered to filmmakers and fans.  So, I guess the timeline really ends with IX, right?  You know, after his niece killed him when he vaginally (yes, I meant to type that word) possessed the dead body of his sister (and yes, they just decided he now had a sister).

Rather than playing off themes from A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (1987), NOES 4: The Dream Master (1988), NOES 5: The Dream Child (1989), The Hidden (1987) and  The Evil Dead (1981, 1987) movies, this sequel decides to pull from an appropriately different genre.  The sci-fi honoraria run rich as we have a David Cronenberg (Nightbreed, The Fly, Videodrome) cameo, Aliens-esque Colonial Marines and sinister financial motives, they're from Earth 2 and en route to the Solaris space station (after the 1972 film), we have Trekkie jokes about beaming to safety, the Bishop-ish Kay-Em 14 (Lisa Ryder; Andromeda, Forever Knight) wants to be more human (like Star Treks Data) and has nipples and makes out with her inventor (not at all like Star Treks Data), and theres even a gory little callback to Alien: Resurrection (1997; airlock scene).

The action, death scenes, special effects, make-up and gore are all adequate and entertaining.  We have a juicy slimy gooey behind-the-mask scene during another messy Jason autopsy (as in Jason Goes to Hell), the sleeping bag kill (during the Crystal Lake simulation) harkened all that was good about the sleeping bag death in part VII: The New Blood (1988) and feistily played on tropes about as well as The Final Girls (2015; based on this franchise).

Overall this movie looks cheap as in way cheaper than any of its predecessors.  Sure, we have some wonderful Jason pose shots.  But everything else is direct-to-DVD quality; like porn quality down to the ultra-cheap sets (in some cases).  And don't even get me started on the CGI spaceships. Geez.  But with cheap can come funny.  In a somewhat pinnacle moment of Bad Movie Glory, the ships repair nanites create an upgraded Jason that smacks of The Guyver (1991)basically hes a demonic zombie cyborg.

The spaceships are called the Tiamat and the Grendel (do we have some Dungeons and Dragons-mythology geeks among the writers?) and this sequel was hypersexualized (because Dungeons and Dragons fans).  Theres an S&M mid-term sex party, a scantily clad autopsy, a sexy resurrection in skimpy chainmail, sex scenes (Lexa Doig; V, The 4400, Continuum, Andromeda), and a love bot with magnetic robot nipples.  Kay-Em reminds me way too much of Alice (Resident Evil; which actually came out after Jason X), all dolled up in a saucy tight black leather outfit, doing cartwheel kung fu, and playing superhuman gunfighter against Jason.  But the real highlights are the liquid nitrogen head-crush kill, the crawling torso, and Jasons second punch decapitation (since Jason Takes Manhattan).

In an elegantly graceful swan dive into a lake of clichs, Jason is ejected from the spaceship only to burn up re-entering the atmosphere of a presumably Crystal Lake-like camp. And while this was the last wed see of Jason until the 2009 reboot, I thought it was a pretty fun ride worthy of my time (again).",1515628800,,7024,4.859781696053736
