8000803,5,B0000DEYV5,"For the money, among the best defending videos ever made. No BS. It gets right down to business regarding individual, small group, and large group defending. This video is actually several years old but the concepts and basics are covered. I bought the DVD because my VHS finally gave out.",1409961600,,289,4.8
8000804,3,B0000DEYV5,"The primary content of the DVD is live footage of players participating in an extensive collection of drills aimed at improving defense technique. For a coach coaching players at more advanced levels, the DVD is likely to prove a useful source of ideas for drills. For the individual looking for a comprehensive overview of individual defending, including substantive discussions of the techniques and underlying theory associated with different aspects of individual defending, the DVD is likely to prove a disappointment. Tactical and technical discussion is pretty minimal, although some insights may be gleaned from the background commentary and slow-motion footage of the drills.",1240012800,,684,5.650485436893204
8000805,5,B0000DEYV5,"This is a great, great DVD.  Like the title suggests, this disk is all about individual defending techniques.  TEAM PLAY, MARKING, AND ZONE PLAY IS NOT, I REPEAT, IS NOT COVERED.  It was shot during an individual defending practice of an English youth league club. The young players shown on this disk are very very advanced, playing at almost pro levels.  All the moves are shown many times, often in slow motion, with the commentary telling you what to look out for.  This disk focuses a great deal on movement, body position, 'the scoop tackle' is explained, defensive heading is explained,  and there are many, many tackles shown to give you an idea of how physical and aggressive you need to be in order to play good defence.  I understand that many instructional soccer videos suffer from bad production, but this is not one of them.  The production is crisp and clear, could ask for better.  Get the DVD version of this as you can slow it down and play it frame by frame if you have any questions.",1104883200,17,1004,4.564245810055866
