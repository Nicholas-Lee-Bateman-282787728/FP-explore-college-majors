4552673,4,B0053XGSZU,"""Does that make sense"" my new fav phrase (you'll see when watching the DVD).

Damian does a good job of explaining the basics with simple classroom and flying demonstrations. I give this DVD a 4 star rating because it is the best of what is available out there (not much competition) but I believe at too high a cost so that knocks off a value star. The DVD covers CG, Ground Loops and basic Land Techniques. Would have felt this a better deal if both DVD 1&2 were combined into a single offering for $49. The production style is home brew and cute.",1327017600,4,549,4.330097087378641
4552674,5,B0053XGSZU,"Got both 101 and 202. Definitely learned a lot.

Instructor did a great job of explaining why ground loops happen - and how to avoid them.

The instructor had a great point that you can use taildragger techniques on a tricycle gear plane, but you can't use tricycle gear techniques on a taildragger.

Describes the logic behind choosing a 3 point landing or a wheel landing.

This is a long training video, where everything is explained and demonstrated in detail - enough so you'll be able to do it yourself. It's the most detailed aviation training video I've seen.

Oh. And this ain't your father's cub they're using. It's a pretty neat plane.",1307923200,3,646,4.68141592920354
8455826,5,B0053XGSZU,Excellent overview of tailwheel flying. I'll be doing my tailwheel endorsement with Damian and his team in about a month and now I have a really good idea of what to expect from both the training and his teaching style.,1525478400,,219,4.5

8455828,5,B0053XGSZU,The content of this DVD is put together in a way that allows you to go from the ground school straight out to the plane to put it to practical use.  Nice job,1450915200,2,157,3.757575757575758

8455831,4,B0053XGSZU,Needed more training info and instructions... Not really informational.,1415491200,,71,7.0
8455832,5,B0053XGSZU,"One of the most powerful DVDs I have watched along the times. I was having some issues regarding the correct operation from a tailwheel airplane, mainly during the 3 point landings. Watching this DVD several items were clarified. The blend between the ground school and the practical training was very useful and understandable. The images were very well made, becoming  the DVD pleasant in watching.

I believe this DVD is useful both students and instructors. I recommend strongly for who wishes to improve his/her performance in flying tailwheel airplanes.",1391731200,2,559,5.269662921348314
8455833,3,B0053XGSZU,"Very clear, well written and good video demonstrating concepts.
My only complaint is the excessive amount of video shooting the student's face while flying when I really want to see the horizon or bank angle of the plane.",1390780800,3,221,4.842105263157895
8455834,4,B0053XGSZU,Flying the Tail-wheel plane is a BLAST! Damian provides the knowledge for you to learn techniques how beyond the basics.,1363824000,,120,5.05
8455835,5,B0053XGSZU,"This is a great CD.  Five Stars for well done.  Great editing, sound, video, and set up for each move.  It's all this and a sack of chips.  A must see !",1335916800,,152,3.65625
