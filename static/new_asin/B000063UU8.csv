7959766,3,B000063UU8,"The other reviews here are for a different film. You will note they are referencing Humphrey Bogart and the Dead End Kids - all of whom had died a long time before this film was made. This is the 2001 vehicle with David Carradine and Richard Moll. I find the fact that there are people who found those reviews useful somewhat humorous. I liked the Bogart film, too, but this isn't it.",1257379200,,384,4.347222222222222
7959767,5,B000063UU8,"I first saw this movie close to 50 years ago and thought back then it was the coolest movie ever made. Today in 2008 and now entering my Sr Citizen years I still think it's one of the best. Over the years after Billy Halop (Frankie Warren in this movie)left the kids many new faces came and went and I think they really lost a lot that they had in the late '30s starting with the great movie ""Dead End"". The six original kids were a force to be reconed with. Even when they were brought out to Hollywood in 1937 they were out of control from the begining. But the combination of Billy Halop,Leo Gorcey,Hunts Hall,Gabrial Dell, Bobby Jordon and Benard Punsley(the last to die just a couple of years ago an a Medical doctor)had something togeather that will never again be seen on the silver screen! Out of the 5 or 6 movies that this original group did togeather this will always be my favorite. It would be great to one day see this on DVD as this is real old school Hollywood.
