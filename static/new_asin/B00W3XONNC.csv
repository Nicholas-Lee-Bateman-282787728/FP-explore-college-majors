8712038,5,B00W3XONNC,Set up a small TV in front of our non usable fireplace.  Run the CD every night.  Makes us feel like we have a real fire.,1516838400,,121,3.6153846153846154
8712039,3,B00W3XONNC,"Good start to finish with the burning process and the flames didn't overwhelm the fireplace opening and you could always see the top of the flames.
Could have done better ""sound quality"" on the video  had to really turn up the volume to hear the wood crackling.  There are two postes on either side of the fireplace opening which annoyed and distracted me and could have done without these all together.
I would have given this a 5 star review if not for these things.  Not annoying enough though to return it.",1515456000,,510,4.521739130434782
8712040,4,B00W3XONNC,"This is my second fireplace DVD. I thought I was ordering the first one I bought. However, this one is a good one because you see the logs actually being burned, (consumed). The first one added logs like osmosis and the crackling was louder. Almost too loud as if bubble wrap was being popped. This one is more realistic.",1481846400,,321,4.4576271186440675
