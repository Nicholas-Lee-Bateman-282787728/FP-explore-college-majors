7968875,3,B00006HB50,"I have been practicing various types of yoga for 12 years.  I was hoping for something more in depth, so I was a bit disapointed in this video.  I'll keep it around to loan out to friends who ask me about yoga, rather than loaning out my David Swenson Short Forms video I'd been sending out on loan. OK, but not great.  Not what I'd hoped for in a video.",1308441600,,354,4.0285714285714285
7968876,3,B00006HB50,Not near as good as the other yoga tapes I have of Baron Baptiste.  I was disappointed as I was looking for a really intensive workout.,1303776000,,135,4.1923076923076925
7968877,4,B00006HB50,"Transform Your Life follows a group of 42 yoga students during one of world famous yoga instructor Baron Bapiste's week-long ""boot camps."" Over the course of the week, participants are exposed to several hours of yoga daily, meditation and other centering activities, a 3-day all-fruit ""fast,"" and more. It was extremely interesting to watch people of different ages and various walks of life come together to share this intense, life-changing experience. Furthermore, the documentary does a nice job of balancing Baron's class teachings with reflections by individual participants. Each day is highlighted separately, with Days 1 through 4 being covered more in-depth and 5 thruogh 7 moving a bit more quickly. Following the documentary portion of the video, there is a 20-minute, beginner's level power yoga practice which appears to have been taken from one of the boot camp classes. Although this practice doesn't have enough specific instruction for those brand-new to yoga, the practice--along with the documentary--would perfect for those just starting to practice power yoga and wanting to learn more.",1218067200,5,1109,5.453488372093023
7968878,5,B00006HB50,"I have several of Baron's yoga dvds and both of his books.  This man is inspirational, sincere, and humble in my opinion.  The Transform your life dvd is motivating and a joy to watch.  I highly recommend this dvd to those interested in transformation.",1193011200,4,252,4.681818181818182
7968879,5,B00006HB50,"I have this in VHS but can't imagine there would be much different in the DVD.

I originally bought it out of curiousity but it has proven to be quite valuable to me. I have many of Baron's videos and his book so I am very familiar with his work. I find Baron to be a breath of fresh air in the yoga world in that his approach to yoga is very down to earth and practical. As he says ""This is yoga for Real People"".....

This video has 42 of students of all different levels of experience with yoga, some complete beginners, going thru a seven day bootcamp in Hawaii. It's very inspirational to see them go thru not only the intense yoga practice but how they respond to the diet (including a fruit only detoxifying diet for a couple of days).

I have read Baron's book ""Journey Into Power"" several times already and continue to read it still. The section on the cleansing diet was particularly fascinating to me. Somehow watching the students on the tape go thru that diet made it seem more approachable to me and I have since modified my diet more along the lines of the books recommendations.

I noticed immediate benefits and have been able to break a plateau weightwise not to mention that I just feel better overall (and I am a person who had a pretty clean vegetarian diet for about 15 years and have been doing yoga seriously (daily in fact) for the last 6 years. This video really provides additional inspiration to help implement what I've learned from Baron's book.

This is not a teaching video per say, more of a mini-documentary of one of his bootcamps (though there is a wonderful ""Power Yoga Basics"" 20 minute instructional routine at the end which is a nice addition and worth the price of the entire tape).

Also it's wonderful to watch how the combined practices of asana, diet and meditation (plus group discussions)really impact on the students lives in a very real and deep way in such a short period of time. I hope someday I'll have the opportunity to do one of his bootcamps myself:)

Baron truly has an approach to teaching yoga in a way that is incredibly relevant to modern folks. It's just as deep as more traditional practices but it's put in language that speaks directly to folks who want the transformative power of yoga without the eastern trappings. As he says, the power is in the process!

Highly inspirational and Highly recommended!!!!

7968882,5,B00006HB50,"The documentary portion is very 'MTV Yoga"" great music, quick cuts, participants breaking the ""fourth wall"".  Set at a seven day bootcamp in Maui, it focuses on those who are new to yoga.  It's great to see all the various types- men,women,younger,older, fit, not so fit.  It made me want to go to a bootcamp, or at least try one at home.  The bonus 20min. routine is a terrific compact practice.  As always a winner from Baron.",1042243200,4,428,4.5064935064935066
