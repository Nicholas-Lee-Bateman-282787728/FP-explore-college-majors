8095991,5,B000C6NP9A,"Picture rappers rewriting the dialog to old kung fu movies.
That is exactly what this is and it's really funny.
Definitely for adults.  Not for children at all.
None our friends think it's as funny as i think it is but it makes my laugh a lot each time I watch.",1398556800,,261,4.117647058823529
8095992,3,B000C6NP9A,"There's no doubt that you will almost die laughing while watching these Kung Faux DVDs. They're smart, witty, and so unexpected. However my main complaint is that there are COMMERCIALS! Yes, commercials! Advertisements for various products run  two to three times within one episode and then there's about 5-10 minutes of commercials between each episode. Another problem is that there is only two episodes on each DVD, which would be extremly pricey if you paid the full $17.99 Amazon asks for each of the 5 DVDs. I suppose you could say the many extras on the disc make up for there only being two episodes but spending $90 to own the complete series is outrageous!",1176163200,6,667,4.8
8095993,5,B000C6NP9A,"When I was first introduced to this DVD, as a birthday gift, with the disclaimer: 'You're going to really dig this', I was instatly hooked the moment the first episode started. After the first 2 minutes I was laughing so hard, tears streamed from my eyes. The hip-hop element and street slang, wrapped around a kung fu movie is brilliant! This is the MOST ""original"" display of cinematography I have ever seen. The video game setting, mixed with a comic book style and the re-telling of classic karate flicks is something to see! I'm hooked! The first episode ""Ill Master"" is so funny, that I have watched this no less than a dozen times; only to see/hear something I missed previously. THANK YOU Tommyboy Films for an awesome product!",1150761600,3,735,4.705426356589148
8095994,5,B000C6NP9A,"Man if you love comic books, classic cuts of music from the golden age of hip hop, kung fu flicks, & video games,

this TV series will put you on seventh heaven for real.

The dialogue is so fresh and so funny and so fly with bumping tracks, it feels like something that has been around for years while also feeling somehow new each time I watch it, and I can't say that about much of anything except maybe the movies ""Sin City"" or ""Kung Fu Hustle"", but ""Kung Faux"" kills them when it comes to scoring with massive tracks from artists like ""De La Soul"", ""Grooverider"", & ""Stetsasonic"".

I can't wait to own the whole seires on dvd and I love that is finally being released.

Now they just need to start releasing some soundtracks on CD from the series for me to be ready to die happy.-chuuurch!",1132876800,3,794,4.308724832214765
