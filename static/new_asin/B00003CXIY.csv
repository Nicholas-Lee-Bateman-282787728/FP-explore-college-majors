1313725,5,B00003CXIY,"This DVD actually does feature some nude footage thatw as cut to avoid an NC-17. The basic plot is that Josh videotapes himself cheating on his girlfriend. He and his buddies Seann William Scott(E.L.), DJ Qualls(Kyle) and Paolo Costzano(Rubin) take a trip from New York to Boston to get the tape back. The film is very funny and has great acting. All of the actors stael almost every scene there in. But the standout is Tom Green, I don't want to spoli it for those who haven't seen it, but it's a great comedey to watch with your boys or your girl.",975715200,2,549,4.392156862745098
1313726,5,B00003CXIY,"Road trip, in my opinion could not have been made any better, it is simply fantastic. It creates a similar feeling of young carelessness, madcap antics, and sex as American pie, whilst not being so outrageous that it seems un-believable. It is a film in which your teenage fantasy can become reality. There is something for everone is this movie, if it doesnt make you laugh you must have had your brain removed! I would say it is more of a movie for the male sex, but is equally enjoyable by both sex`s. If you like teenage movies don`t hesitate buy it now! you will watch it again and again! I will say no more, just watch it and see for yourself! Simply brilliant!!",973036800,2,668,4.395161290322581
1313727,5,B00003CXIY,"Wow! What a movie. A lot of people have compared this movie to American Pie, but it is much better than that. I laughed from the opening line to the end credits. Tom Green was brilliant, as usual. Not only was the dialogue very funny, but all the actions going on in the background made the scenes even more hysterical. Anyone that has been to college can identify with the ""Road Trip"" and the antics while on a road trip. Another definate positive is the lack of a ""cheezy"" lesson to be learned at the end. Definately a DVD title to buy.",972518400,,538,4.284313725490196
1313728,5,B00003CXIY,"Forget the witty antics of a Kevin Smith film, leave your logical side at the door, and just enjoy the ride.
Tom Green's appearance in the movie, though more of a cameo, adds a subtle and twisted feel as only he can.
Viagra, pot, sex, love, fat jokes, blind jokes... by the time you leave, if you haven't been offended once, you need to get out more.
Definitely a rival to American Pie, I give this movie 5 stars enthusiastically. Deliver this movie already!!  ;)",972432000,2,463,4.447058823529412

1314686,4,B00003CXIY,"This was one of the movies that tried to capture what American Pie had, including casting Sean William Scott in a ""Stifler lite"" role. The premise is pretty basic. A guy going to college in NY is in a long distance relationship with a girl in TX. He cheats on her, tapes it, and the tape is accidentally sent to her, so he and and his friends drive to Texas to intercept the tape. Along the way pretty much everything goes wrong.

Like many of the comedies from the late 1990s on it has the drug jokes, sex jokes and gross out humor. DJ Qualls plays the awkward nerdy kid to perfection, and is really the highlight of the movie. It is not the greatest movie by any means, but it is a funny way to kill an hour and a half, if you are into the genre.

For those who get the DVD there are a few extras, but nothing special. About 10 min of deleted scenes, cast bios, trailers, and a behind the scenes feature with Tom Green. Nothing that would really making the DVD a must have over just streaming it.",1403913600,,998,4.139175257731959

1314812,4,B00003CXIY,"""Road Trip"" (2000) is a school comedy and road trip movie about a likable college guy who wants to stay faithful to his long-time girlfriend. Unfortunately he gives-in to temptation and accidentally sends her a video of him making out with another girl. He and a group of friends rush from Ithaca, NY, to Austin, TX, to recover the evidence before his girlfriend receives it.

I initially saw ""Road Trip"" on TV while on vacation a few years ago and liked it enough to purchase the film recently. Viewing the uncut version, I was turned off by the crude humor (in the manner of, say, ""American Pie""), but have to admit that I busted out laughing numerous times, plus the characters are really fleshed out, like the protagonist (Breckin Meyer) who really does want to stay true to his long-distant girlfriend; the ""I'm only in college for sex"" dude who you can't help but like for some reason (Seann William Scott); the geek whom the 'cool' dudes befriend for selfish purposes (DJ Qualls) and more.

Amy Smart also co-stars as the protagonist's new girlfriend.

FINAL WORD: The only thing that prevents ""Road Trip"" from achieving A-grade status like, say, ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" is the unnecessary crude parts. If you can look past this flaw, it's consistently funny and has great characters. The women aren't all that great, although Amy Smart is solid.

The film runs 95 minutes and was shot mostly in Georgia & Tennessee, but also includes an aerial shot of Harvard (Massachusetts), as well as footage from USC and the University of Texas in Austin.

1314816,2,B00003CXIY,"I just took a look at Road Trip, comedy from way back in 2000. I bought it because it came with a free ticket to see The Hangover Part III and I had a passing interest in seeing it. I am now starting to regret that decision, twofold.

The plot is fairly straightforward, with no real surprises in terms of the narrative, but the premise offers plenty of opportunities for funny scenes and characters. Road Trip, unfortunately, misses most of those opportunities. This film was clearly meant to be in the same vein as American Pie, a raunchy college comedy, but it doesn't quite reach that level, nor that of something like Animal House.

Like I said, the plot isn't too complicated. College slacker Josh Parker (Breckin Meyer) has a girlfriend named Tiffany (Rachel Blanchard), his childhood sweetheart, but they attend different colleges, with Josh at the fictional University of Ithaca in New York State and Tiffany at the University of Austin, Texas. He has a tryst with classmate Beth (Amy Smart), which she lets him videotape. Said tape is accidentally mailed to Tiffany as part of Josh's ritual of him sending her video journals, or something like that. Now Josh and his buddies have three days to drive from New York to Texas to intercept the tape before Tiffany sees it. It's pretty straightforward, no real problems plot or narrative wise, with one glaring exception. The plot is set in a frame story, a set of flashbacks narrated by Tom Green's character, which I'll go into detail with later. This framing device is pointless. If taken out, there is no loss to the plot. In fact, he could've just as easily been narrated by Meyer's character.

During this trip, there are a decent variety of scenes and environments given the road path that the friends take. The cinematography is decent, but nothing special. The soundtrack is typical of the late 1990s early 2000s era, mostly mellow college rock; again, nothing to write home about. The shenanigans that the characters get into, typical of this ""crazy adventure"" type story, are hit and miss, mostly miss. Thankfully though, a lot of the unfunny jokes don't last very long, and are typically scene-enders. The gross-out type comedy that is prevalent in this genre is kept to a minimum without any real loss of the comedy, or this case, lack thereof. The fan-service scenes are gratuitous, of course, but that's the point in this genre; they serve their purpose. The dialogue between the characters is a natural and believable, given the characters and the situations that they find themselves in; most of it isn't pointless, but there are some hiccups.

The acting and the characters are really were this film drops the ball. It's hard to remember, but these actors seem a little bit too old for college kids, even for back then, but for suspension-of-disbelief's sake, I'm willing to forgive that. First of all, not everything is bad. Amy Smart is nice and likable, the girl-next-door type. She does okay, with a good and believable mix of strength and vulnerability. DJ Qualls as Kyle is squirrelly and vulnerable, but not wholly feeble. His friends do take advantage of him, but it all does seem to be in good fun, and he takes it in stride well enough. He is the ""pathetic loser"" type typical of teen films, not unlike Cameron from Ferris Bueller's Day Off (played by Alan Ruck), right down to the overly strict father. Unlike Cameron, Kyle does eventually confront his father directly, rather than it being implied, and although this particular plotline's resolution is not terrible, it's not particularly satisfying either. Breckin Meyer is barely passable. He almost delves into blandness, but not quite enough to destroy the performance, but he does straddle that line a little too closely for my taste. Paulo Costanzo as Rubin is boring, emotionless, and uninteresting; if he obviously doesn't care about what's going on around him, why should we? He's the stoner/slacker stereotype, and he doesn't diverge from that trope at all, and much of the plot can take place without him without any real loss. Sean William Scott plays . . . somebody. I forget the actual character name, but let's face it, he's just playing Stifler from the American Pie films again. Seriously, the character is no different, essentially a copy-and-paste with no discernible changes whatsoever. But I suppose that is the point, as Sean William Scott was typecast for that character type. If you found Stiffler funny, you'll find Stifler 2.0 funny in this film too. Anthony Rapp's character of Jacob is a stock psycho/stalker type; he's clich&eacute;d and lame, and only serves to poorly fill the ""bully"" stereotype, but he doesn't really look the part. There are some funny cameos, however. Horatio Sanz, from Saturday Night Live fame, has one of the few really funny parts in this film. It's of the gross-out variety, but not too bad and hilarious nonetheless. Jimmy Kimmel also has a cameo that's pretty funny; see if you can catch it. There's also a brief appearance by John Ross Bowie, whom you probably know as Barry Kripke of The Big Bang Theory fame. Of course, Andy Dick is an unfortunate blemish on an otherwise good cameo list. But all of this, good and bad, is nothing compared to the true horror of this film, the un-equally terrible Tom Green.

Tom Green is abysmal in this film; by far, he is the worst thing about it. He is annoying and unfunny. For the life of me, I cannot remember or understand why we as a nation ever found him funny, and frankly, I'm ashamed of it. Like I said before, he's the narrator for the frame story, but I already went over how pointless that was. In fact every scene he's in is pointless and goes nowhere. Not one bit of it is funny, just annoying and obnoxious. Everything about this character is painful. His name is Barry Manilow, something that I believe that the real Barry Manilow regrets immensely. Tom Green's scenes are painful in every sense of the word to watch. The only good one is where the snake tries to eat him, and man, do I wish it did, but then again, Tom Green is nearly impossible to stomach.

The ending, which I won't give away here, is kind of anti-climactic, in the sense that it just sort of happens without any real tension or build-up. I will give the film credit for this though: the way the situation resolves is unconventional and unexpected, and even grown-up in its own way. The standard epilogue for this type of film, that being the ""what happened to them afterward"" footnotes are uninteresting for all the characters, and don't do any of them any real justice, what little there was to be done.

The DVD extras are standard, mostly trailers. The trailer itself is mostly more Tom Green, so it's just annoying. He also hosts the making-of documentary, so that's also worthless. The deleted scenes were left out for reason, as they are even less funny than what made it into the film, and many of them are just mean-spirited. Skipping the DVD extras will most likely do you more good than otherwise.

Overall, this film is boring, forgettable, and only slightly funny in some rare parts. That being said, it's not outright terrible, but it comes darn close, almost too close for comfort. There could've been some genuine comedy here, but the opportunity is mostly missed out on. Unless you're really a fan of just this genre of raunchy college comedy films, you're better off passing on it.",1372291200,,7418,4.771806853582555

1314992,3,B00003CXIY,"If you just want to sit back and laugh at the most ridiculously insulting and rather audacious attempts at trashy humor, then this film is for you.  In the long line of teenage romp/coms, this one is certainly not the worst.  I don't understand why these senseless sex comedies are so popular (or at least WERE so popular back in the late 90's, early 00's) but for whatever reason they were being released regularly every three months or so.

I blame `American Pie', which in retrospect isn't really all that funny.

The thing with these films is that they go absolutely nowhere and serve absolutely no purpose.

This film centers around a group of guys who take a road trip (thus the name of the film) from Ithaca to Austin when one of the group accidentally mails a sex tape (with another chick) to his girlfriend.  Along the way they have some outrageous (and yes, comical) adventures.

This was the birth of DJ Quails brief fame.  He is actually pretty funny in that ""OH MY GOD HE IS FUNNY TO LOOK AT"" kind of humor.  Everything he does has an extra layer of hilarity because he is so unattractive.  This was also made when Seann William Scott was a hot commodity (thank god that is over) and when Amy Smart was the hot young thing (where is she now?) and Tom Green was famous.  Yes, Tom Green was famous.  Breckin Meyer is the real star here, and he has that suave quality about him that makes him likable and watchable.  Sadly, his career went nowhere either.

Andy Dick is gross, but he always makes me laugh so I'm glad he's here.

Anyways, this will entertain, even if it won't stay with you.  You won't remember this tomorrow, but you'll laugh pretty hard tonight.  What else could you hope to want from something as ridiculous as `Road Trip'?

I was planning on giving this film a D (which would have been two stars) but I kept hearing Seann William Scott whispering in my ear...

1314995,5,B00003CXIY,"Road Trip is just that - a wonderfully complex adventure, a road trip shared between four college dorm-mates where incredible hijinks and comedy occurs from beginning to end.

Josh (Breckin Meyer) is a student at the University of Ithaca (NY), and has been sending tapes to his girlfriend of many years.  They've been sappy, with bad singing and lame poetry.  Unfortunately for his girlfriend Tiffany, who attends college in Texas, she had a death in the family and went incognito for a few days.  Josh began to doubt their relationship, and took the opporunity to bed Beth (Amy Smart), a cute co-ed who is infatuated with Josh.  In a case of incredibly bad and good luck, Beth decides to film the session, but Josh accidentally sends the tape to Tiffany.  What follows is a race to beat the tape, save the relationship, and avoid humiliation.

Along with his roommate Ruben (Paulo Costanzo), his friend EL (S. W. Scott), and a nerd (DJ Qualls) whose car they need for the trip, they start the journey from New York to Texas.  On the way, a car explodes during a Dukes of Hazzard reenactment, a midget and a nerd are in a step show, a Klan hood shows up, a sperm donor situation takes an unexpected turn, someone steals a bus from a blind school, a snake named Mitch makes a mistake during feeding time, and a dog demands blueberry pancakes.

The only downfall to this movie is Tom Green's moronic schtick; it almost kills the movie.  He's the human speedbump in a highway of laughs.  Otherwise, it's a laugh riot nearly the entire movie.",1202256000,,1538,4.617647058823529

It is also the changes in the guys girlfriend that he is getting the tape from and how thier relationship has changed too.

This movie was recommended by my good friend, Bobby Asslong.  In most cases his recommendations are a bunch of [...], but he hit it right on, with this one!  I detest Tom Green.  He is one of those guys, who that when he fails at something (Talk Show, most of his movies, life) I actually feel happy.  And this is actually contrary to my normal personality.  I normally automatically love all Canadians.  Just kidding. I normally want people to succeed, and feel bad when they fail.

But Tom Green is so annoying.

Great news!  He is in only about 4 or 5 scenes in this whole movie, so you should be able to get through this movie, with little to none hatred for Mr. Green.

I love all the characters in this movie, especially the main protagonist, who accidentally sends the videotape to his girlfriend at a far away college.  He is very likeable, and you're pulling for him the whole time.  Another thing I like this movie, is that it pulls a lot from other ""gross out"" teen and college flicks, but it doesn't go overboard in the gross out department.

Wise a**."" he starts the story of Josh (his roomate) going out with the same girl since he was five then them going to different colleges then josh cheating on her on video tape then the tapes gets accidently sent to her ""It was  a journey that would change their lives forever, the end"" Tom Green says before starting the main part of the movie. I won't give away the ridiculus but funny ending though there are some parts which had my friends and I practically laughing non-stop. One of which is throughout the movie it switches back to Barry (Tom Green) feeding Mitch (Boa Constrictor) a mouse. He's uncontrollably obseessed with 'feeding time' and at one point says ""he tastes good Mitch, he tastes good"" Then puts the mouse in his mouth right before having the boa constricor swallow half of his arm. He starts yelling and swinging his arm around then the boa constrictor flys off and hits this professor in the neck. I won't give away the scene where they stay at Barry's grandparents house though I will says it involves marajuana, talking dogs, and medicine. Its been a long time since i've laughed this hard and that was probably when I first saw Old School (Will Ferrel) and Blazing Saddles (Mel Brooks) which are also really funny movies. I have to say though Tom Greene and Sean William Scott often steal the show with 'feeding time' and ""what? for this? Bob Hope can jump this bridge in a wheelchair so we can do it in a car""

This movie isn't alot different from the rated version but it has some worth owning deleted scenes and trailers.

This movie isn't really a 'family movie' but it will appeal to anyone who likes sometimes outrageous and bizarre humor. There is nothing too over the top that you wouldn't see in an R movie. Well then again Barry's grandparents...

This is a great movie and I hope this review will influence your decision. But parents, I reccomend watching this before or with your kids because there are some scenes that might be deemed inappropriate but it all depends on how easily you can be offended.

I could go on for about a page and and half talking about this movie but i've got other stuff to do. So take my advice, rent or buy it(I think its worth buying) relax and watch this keeping in mind to view it as a comedy and enjoy some of the craziest scenes ever to glaze the often somewhat smudged screen of the fabulous world of comedy.",1094947200,2,2898,4.450094161958568
1315267,4,B00003CXIY,"This movie lived up to its hype of ruanch and laughs.  Its not on the caliber of Old School or the first American Pie, but it does a damn good job.  The dialogue in this was much smarter than some would expect for a gross out comedy.",1092096000,,233,3.9361702127659575
1315268,2,B00003CXIY,"The plot of this story is revolves around a college student, Josh Parker(Meyer) who recruits a group of dorm buddies to help him get from New York to Texas in order to intercept a mistakenly mailed video tape of himself having sex with another girl, before it falls into the hands of his girlfriend.  On paper, it looks like a winner and I expected to see something like a cross between Vacation and Van Wilder.  However, while you might expect this kind of movie to be loaded with side-splitting high jinks, I found the humor highly predictable and the characters flat at best.

There are 3 main characters besides Parker and they are all pretty cliche.  First there is E.L. (Scott), as the obnoxious instigator.  There is Rubin Carver (Costanzo), as the eccentric pot-smoking A-student.  Of course, there is also the pathetic 98-pound straw man virgin Kyle Edwards (Qualls), who is the butt of everyone's jokes.  As the plot progresses: the pathetic virgin is deflowered; Carver smokes pot with an old man, and E.L. steals a short-bus and discovers the joys of prostate stimulation.  Like I said, it sounds good on paper, but every gag is telegraphed from a mile away.

On the upside, while the humor is flat, the plot is kind of engaging.  The main reason that you will keep watching this movie is to find out whather or not Josh gets to Texas in time to intercept the videotape.  You will appreciate the consistency and linearity of the storyline, which is not diluted by the inclusion of too many subplots.  It really is a good road movie, if not a good comedy.

On the downside (except for Scott and Smart) the actors in this flick have about as much screen presence as a rock.  While the characters might have been written as one-dimensional stereotypes, at least they could have played thier roles with some enthusiasm.

Still, Road Trip is a fairly engaging movie but only because of the main plot.  As a comedy, however, it is pretty flat.",1091318400,3,1949,4.671554252199414

The results are laugh out loud funny. They go through several detours including a blown-up car and mishaps with stereotypical people. Tom Green is the funniest member of the talented cast by ""narrating"" his story to us.

An accidental genious, if you will, and I am glad America has woken up from their hypnotized state that he had over them.  All the other characters are unlikeable.  The pot head kid is an arrogant, self-serving, character that is too smart for his own good.  DJ Qualls is too whiny in the beginning and then is too full of himself at the end.

1315272,4,B00003CXIY,"From the outside looking in, Ithaca University seems to be traditional in every aspect; however, nothing is farther from the truth. ""Road Trip"", a crude spin-off of National Lampoon's ""Animal House"", collided with viewers in 1998. Ivan Reitman, producer of Animal House and now executive producer of ""Road Trip"", injects his entertainment style into this action packed, comedy loaded with extra flavor. Directed by Tod Phillips, creator of the award documentary ""Frat House"", and scripted by Scot Armstrong, ""Road Trip"" takes a glimpse at the precarious nature of college life.
Compliments of Canadian comedian Tom Green, the cast ignite as Barry (Tom Green), a professional college student, leads a campus tour on an expedition of erotic proportions. Barry encompasses the college experience by demonstrating experiences gained at Ithaca University. Shock and scrutiny ravened the affixed pupils of the audience for one hour and thirty-four minutes as four college aged coconspirators hit the highway in lei of heading off a catastrophe. Josh (Breckin Meyer), who played in ""Clueless"", ""54"" and ""GO"", is the films central character. Josh and his long time girlfriend, Tiffany (Rachel Blanchard), of TV series ""Clueless"", have been nurturing their infatuation since fifth grade.
Keeping their long distance romance kindled proves even harder when Beth (Amy Smart) of ""Varsity Blue"" fame, begins enticing Josh and his unsatisfied desires. Desire turns into disaster when an intimate moment ends up on VHS and is mistakenly mailed to Josh's distant girlfriend. In a desperate rage of hormones and humor, Josh along with the outgoing and catastrophic comedy of E.L. (Seann William Scott), of ""American Pie"" fame, rustles the dorm dweeb into letting them take his car. Balancing out the ensemble is Rubin (Paulo Costanzo), who adds intelligence along with an intrinsic quality to the cast. With finals approaching, relationships in Jeopardy, and love on the line, the four comrades take off in pursuit of adventure and eventually humility.
I'd give this crude comedy four stars for accelerated laughter. If you are looking for intelligence in higher education, register for ""Road Trip"". ""Road trip"" is just that, a trip!",1068163200,,2216,5.389048991354467

1) The plot is very simple: a guy and his friends try to catch a videotape, wrongly sent to his girlfriend, in which he had recorded by mistake a relationship with another chick. This journey will bring them into many illogical situations. I wonder who was in charge of making the screenplay.
2) So stupid and boring. Is it supposed to be funny the vision of a man being bitten by a snake or eating a hamster? And what about the foolish teacher who wants the guy to fail? I didn't know that making stupid faces was enough to create a comedy, as Tom Green does all the time. But there are even worse scenes, theoretically invented in order to entertain the audience.
 3) All the time I was trying to laugh a little and enjoy it, in vain. I couldn't find amusing anything. American Pie, another movie which also belongs to this genre was at least supportable, but this rubbish isn't even that. This is the typical teenager movie easily made to succeed.

There are a few good belly laughs in this movie, but overall it is a forgettable experience and just a ho-hum movie. The unrated version really doesn't enhance the movie at all.

He then decides to go down to her college on his spring break to stop her from seeing the video. So he and a few friends get together and have the Road Trip of a lifetime.
O.k. I have to say in some respects, yes it's kind of like American Pie but it's still different enough to be it's own movie and it's not bad at all. There are a lot of funny scenes in this movie from Tom Green eating and playing with the mouse, to the sperm bank (you'll see) of course when one of the guys is sitting out on the porch smoking pot with a dog.
Another great thing about this movie is that Tom Green is nowhere near as annoying as he was in Charlie''s Angels or Freddy Got Fingered. For me personally, Tom Green had one of the funniest scenes when he was playing with the snake.
My advice to anyone interested in this movie is to NOT compare it to American Pie because if you do, 9 times out of 10 people will say they hated it. Road Trip is truly it's own movie and the brand comedy used in this is way different in comparison with American Pie.

In this movie, each guy learns an important lesson or experiences some type of self-discovery that many of its viewers can relate to.  Besides being a plot that most college students or teens can associate with, Road Trip is also a hilarious, perverted comedic experience.

1315479,3,B00003CXIY,"Road Trip, while having quite a handful of hilarious scenes and being entertaining leaves me a bit lukewarm mainly because of the basic premise of the movie...
THE STORY:
Josh (Breckin Meyer) succumbs to temptation and has a one-night stand with a lovely classmate who's had the hots for him, Beth (Amy Smart), an encounter that they taped.  When Josh's sex tape is accidentally mailed to his near lifelong girlfriend Tiffany (Rachel Blanchard), Josh and his posse of dorm buddies (lech E.L., nerd Kyle and stoner Rubin) pack up for a Road Trip to intercept the tape before Tiffany receives it.
THE ANALYSIS:
The movie is full of humorous (and some quite disturbing) moments.  The clear star of the movie for me was Seann ""Stifler"" William Scott who portrayed Josh's best bud E.L. who single-handedly had THE BEST SCENE in the movie at the ""donor clinic.""  The humor value is right up there with most other movies in the ""teen comedy"" genre as of late, ...
The main problem that I have with the movie though is actually the basic plot of the movie.  Call me old-fashioned but I find it disturbing that the movie is basically about a guy who cheats on his girlfriend and goes to ANY and ALL lengths (including using and abusing a ""friend"" to aid him, lying, stealing, etc.) to cover his tracks.  It further bothers me that he actually has friends willing to back him up on it.
Equally disturbing was Tom Green's character and his maniacal obsession with killing mice.  Where's the humor/entertainment value in that???
Aside from those two criticism's the movie was pretty funny and entertaining.  The many misadventures that the crew encounters as they travel from Ithaca, NY to Austin, Texas are pretty hilarious and should keep you laughing and amused.
...THE VERDICT:
Again, the film was hilarious and entertaining ..., but still the overall plot and Tom Green's character may leave you with a bit of a bad taste...

The storyline is pretty good. Josh goes to Ithaca college in New York while his lifetime girlfriend, Tiffany, heads off to Austin, Texas to study vet. science.

1315487,5,B00003CXIY,"Despite many hints throughout the movie pointing to classical philosophy, no one seems to have picked up on that.  Its not surprising, given the fact no one knows what satire is anymore, let alone finds it funny.  The most amazing thing about this movie is the seamless blending of classical humor with pop culture buffoonery.
The best part of this movie however is the obviously funny scenes that are either raved about or ripped on are obviously poking fun at mainstream culture.  The movie ends with the main character having to pass a test on the Republic and Phaedo.  As these were the two works where Plato outlined his conception of the forms, it comes as no surprise that this movie is entirely basing its humor on the absurdity of the close minded masses.  Just as the cave dwellers were incapable of perceiving reality, only shadows, most of the humor as well as the point of this movie is entirely missed by those who have never laughed at anything but buffoonery and insults.  It is unfortunate, because for those who laugh at the absurdity of life, we have little mass media art available to us.  This is a movie you can really laugh at with your friends, instead of shaking your head with dismay at the repulsive humor of most movies.  Of course, you won't be laughing at the same things as them really, but they won't know the difference.
Everyone raves that Green is the only funny character...  This movie very very closely follows the Greek theatrical form.  All the main characters are archetypes of a particular personality type you would find in a top 500 university.  Green plays the role of the chorus, mirroring what the average audience is likely to be thinking.  Of course, he is the one with whom most identify.  They don't realize he is really making fun of HIM.  For those who critique the sexual content of the movie, most of it is presented in an egregarious fashion to point out how absurd sexual obsession is.  When the movie ends, you will find the refrain of the song is something to the effect of ""Now I know love and happiness are not the same"".  Even though philosophers have for ages proven time and again that our relationship-love-sex oriented lives are hollow, 98% of Americans focus their entire life on one of those things virtually all the time.  This movie ultimately tries to shatter that irrational view.
This movie will make you laugh about the absurdity of sexual monogamy, love and religious obsessions, rule based ethics in general, racial cliques (ie the black frat scene), asexual old people, aggressive meatheads, drug laws, you name it...  This movie covers so much ground.  But sadly, you have to be an atheist to enjoy this movie.  Otherwise, you will be deeply offended.  Theists, be warned.",1013558400,,2750,4.723270440251572

""Road Trip"" is not.  B-list actor Fred Ward is no hilarious Eugene Levy, whose well-intentioned advice all caused great laughter in ""American Pie,"" but it is no surprise.  For ""Road Trip"" is rude, crude, mean, and made by the people who don't believe in such words as love and friendship.  You may laugh or resent seeing four stupid college students doing politically uncorrect things, but it is all intentional.  You may laugh a lot, depending on state of mind or intelligence, but one thing is clear: none of the cast is going to get noticed to have a bigger chance, like Jason Biggs or Chris Klein from ""American Pie,"" because the film itself is like junk food or chewing gum.  It is easily digested and disposed.  Buy it, taste it, enjoy its flavor, and throw it away.  And as for Tom  Green, I have nothing to say except that his weird mannerism is getting unfunny.

And E.L. (played by the great Seann William Scott) is hilarious. His way of acting is incredible and I can't stop laughing at him. Of course not all scenes in this film is good, but I can't really find any terrible ones. Except one scene which makes you puke everytime you think of toast. Also hilarious in this film is Tom Green.

1315763,2,B00003CXIY,"There it was.....the preview of Road Trip at my cinema. A great trailer; a good collection of up-and-coming actors, and looked similar to the entertaining American Pie. My favourite genre of movie; the road trip.
How it all starts......Josh (Breckin Meyer) makes a sex tape of himself and his 'dream girl' (Amy Smart). It all goes horribly wrong in true predictable style when the tape he made gets accidentally mailed to his girlfriend (Rachel Blanchard). Cue the gathering of comedy-stereotyped buddies and the 'one left at home to mess up the plans', mix with an 'evil jesus freak' and you have a beginning of a comedy adventure.
The pace of the movie is slow at the beginning; but you think that the talented young cast will soon end up in frenzied hillarity. Wrong.
Breckin Meyer is well cast as the 'faithful' boyfriend gone misled; but his character is very weak and as the viewer, you really don't care what happens to him. Seann William Scott is once again brilliant as E.L., but he looks like making a career out of playing the same character and will always be 'Stifler' to most of us. Paulo Costanzo has been brought in to play 'stoner genius'. Although he does it well; it seems, as with many of these movies these days, that stoner humour is just brought in for automatic laughs from the less cultured among us (don't take that the wrong way guys!). DJ Qualls plays a very timid character in Kyle that begins humourous but ends up irritating. Finally media darling Tom Green is brought in to play the 'zany' guy. 'The Salmon Song' is great but the rest of his act is too stupid. It's also a shame that View Askew regular Ethan Suplee has a small part.
In conclusion, many people out there probably loved this film; I was ultimatley disappointed by something that just looked like it came out of the 'teen comedy formula' box on sale at local supermarkets. The laughs are too far apart; and even then they result in barely more than a smile and you can almost tell the story before you are 15 minutes in.
I loved American Pie, even loved Dude, Where's My Car? (I know!) but this really didn't do anything for me. At all.",986688000,3,2133,4.557291666666667

RT was definitely overhyped as being ""hilarious"" and ""the funniest movie of the year.""  I finally decided to rent it because I figured anything with Tom Green in it had to have some laughs.  I was right, RT is without a doubt a funny movie, although Green is not in it for the better part of the film.  The other characters are pretty damn funny, especially Seann William Scott who is hilarious.  Typical road movie fare with some funny detours along the way (Frat house scene and Andy Dick in the motel).  Tom Green is his usual self, putting live mice into his mouth and mooning the camera.  The funniest thing about RT is Barry's (Tom Green) obsession with feeding his friends pet snake.  The french toast scene in the diner is also really good, and Seann William Scott's dancing to ""I Wanna Rock"" on the bus is great.

1315768,4,B00003CXIY,"This movie was alot funnier than I thought it would be. I had seen the previews and checked out the box, but was not expecting to like it all that much. The plot is standard teen movie fare, Josh (Breckin Meyer) gets freaky with Beth (Amy Smart) and a camera records it all, then instead of his usual video that he sends to his long-distance girlfriend Tiffany (Rachel Blanchard) the sex tape gets sent to her. Josh and his friends set off to make it to Texas before the tape, and unleash a bevy of comical moments. Tom Green plays Barry, the narrator of the story, with a bizzare obsession with feeding Mitch, a python. His scenes are some of the funniest the movie has to offer. Scenes featuring E.L. are hilarious too, played by Seann William Scott, especially the ""milking the prostate"" scene.
Alas, some parts however, are just plain gross. The scene in the restaurant is sickening and makes you not want to eat out again. Even though I am male, and am 14 years old, I still found the amount of nudity in this film to be a little much. Some of the parts (namely the shower scene) show nothing on the screen but a female's breasts. That brings me to another thing, the unrated footage is a joke, all of about 10 seconds of ""unrated"" footage was included, and is only close-ups of breasts.
One thing this DVD is not lacking is special features. It has deleted scenes, some of which are downright hilarious while others are rather dumb, an Eels music video, cast bios, and a trivia game and screensaver for DVD-Rom. The menu setup is very well done, and looks very put together.

1315821,2,B00003CXIY,"Borrowing much of it's plot from the 1997 film ""Overnight Delivery"", ""Road Trip"" centers around four college friends embarking on a cross-country race to intercept a package.
Josh (Breckin Meyer) is trying to cope with his long distance relationship, having phone conversations, and sending video-taped messages to the girl he has been dating since grade school, played by Rachel Blanchard.
While being urged by his buddy (Seann William Scott), Josh, succumbs to temptation and has a wild one-night stand with Beth (Amy Smart).  What started as a night of passion ends in disaster, as a video tape of his encounter is accidentally mailed to his girlfriend at the Univeristy of Austin...so begins ""Road Trip"".
Being a huge fan of this type of comedy, I have to say I was extremely disappointed, most of the gags in this movie are tasteless and gross (the breakfast diner scene being the worst).  Breckin Meyer does not come off believable as the campus stud, and Tom Green...how does anyone find this guy funny? The only saving grace of this movie is Seann William Scott, given the best lines, and the only funny scenes in the movie(the sperm bank scene is hysterical), he steals the show.  If you are looking for laughs in a teenage setting look elsewhere, possibly ""American Pie"", or ""Porky's"" for that matter.

The movie is about a guy named Josh, who has a girlfriend that he's known since he was five years old. Then, at the start of the movie, he has a fling with another girl, makes a videotape of the night, and accidentally mails it to his girlfriend Tiffany days later. His girlfriend lives in Austin, Texas (which Tom Green gets confused with Boston, Massachusetts, a hilarious running joke through the movie). Josh lives in Ithaca, NY. Josh, realizing that his relationship with Tiffany could be in jeopardy, travels from Ithaca, NY with three friends, to Austin, Texas to intercept the tape before she does. Along the way, they get into a series of hilarious disasters, like the car exploding after they jump a bridge; staying overnight in an all-black fraternity with scrawny, stuck-up Kyle being the hit of the party; killing a snake (Green takes care of that), midterms, stuff like that.  This is the Vacation of college movies. It's hilarious, rude and crude. I was laughing almost the whole time. As for the DVD, there's some nice features. The deleted scenes were OK. There's also the standard trailers, a director's commentary, and standard making-of feature. On top of that, there's a very nice transfer. Oh, and the unrated part?

If you don't like the recent comedys that have been aimed at teenagers then you may not want to watch this one. I thought Road Trip was one of the better comedys of 2000 (Better than most but not as good as Little Nicky and on par with Meet the Parents). The DVD isn't that spectacular though.

His character added nothing to the movie....and he is not even that funny.

Many may perhaps consider the plot lacking or immature.  Not true.  The plot is simplified, but what teen movie isn't?  The key to this movie's success is its subplots and intertwining timing.  The director provides the movie with great pacing and a wonderful sense of timing for scenes and jokes.  Tom Green's character is great for a change of pace and his scenes with the snake is NOT to slow the movie, but to provide the essential subplot.  Road Trip is so entertaining that there is no lost moment.  All the scenes are vital to the movement of the plot.  And there are enough scene changes and storyplot twists that keep the audience interested.  The director and screenwriter did a fantastic job. Why buy this movie?  This is a great movie to watch whenver you're bored.  The DVD version has nothing special, but I believe you are paying extra for the picture quality, not the added nudity scenes.  Plus, this movie was produced with 15 million and made over 70 million in the theatres.  That's pretty impressive considering the lack of star power, lack of advertising, and Zero overseas gross.  No special effects, no overuse of foul language and pretty much no expectations to do well whatsoever.  But it DID gross nearly quadruple it's investment.  This movie will prove to be a classic down the road.  We need more movies with great pacing and great subplots like this.

When I went to see it in the theatre, my gut hurt from laughing so hard. When I got the DVD, I laughed just as hard watching it the 2nd time. OWN IT!!",979171200,,510,4.214285714285714

1315916,2,B00003CXIY,"I think Road Trip had the potential to be as good as American Pie had it not included the painfully unfunny Tom Green.  His scenes with the mouse and the snake were grating, long-winded and utterly worthless to the plot of the film.  For the first time that I can recall, I actually read through the credits to see if Drew Barrymore (Green's fiancee) was an executive producer.  I figured that would be the only way he would be cast in a film.  Tom Green is a Pauly Shore wannabe (and that, my friends, is not saying much).
Other than Tom Green, the other characters were fun to watch and the story was pretty good and oftentimes funny.  Seann William Scott again plays a character similar to his ""Stifler"" role in American Pie (the oversexed smart aleck), but he plays it very well.  DJ Quills, who plays the nerdy character who, reluctantly, lets his friends use his car and credit card is a big hit.  And all the women are beautiful!
If you can ignore Tom Green, you may enjoy the flick.  But there is too much of this unfunny actor to give Road Trip any more than two stars.",978393600,6,1078,4.355

However, don't be swayed with this ""unrated"" DVD b.s.  It is seriously bogus.  There is nothing new or different than the theatrical version to see.  The seven deleleted scenes are ones that should have been cut because they are so redundant and unnecessary.  Buy this only if you love the version you've seen and will be happy with that.  You get nothing more than 5 mins. of fluff.

1315918,4,B00003CXIY,"I found this video to be much funnier then I thought it would be.  Most of the humor is very juvenile but I could not stop myself from laughing out loud during several scenes.  I can only take Tom Green in very small doses and the movie does not spend to much time on his character which can get very annoying (like Tom Green himself) after more then a couple of minutes.
You do need to be in a lighthearted mood to really enjoy this film.  If you are a very serious person or like more sophisticated tongue-in-cheek humor then you will be very disapointed in this movie.  However, if you are looking for a good silly movie then this one will make you laugh.",978220800,2,658,4.24
1315919,4,B00003CXIY,"Picture this, you are leaving the safe surrounds of high school to enter the unknown realm of university, being wise you decide to visit what could be potentially be your place of study, partying and security for the next three years, so you take the campus tour to get acquainted with the grounds as well as meet some new people. Sounds perfect, right? Wrong! Your tour guide is non-other than MTV shock jock and crazy man Tom Green, who in this case is actually named Barry Manilow. What results is the telling of a tale of the most time honoured campus tradition, the ROAD TRIP. So begins the story of four guys who embark on a three-day ROAD TRIP to retrieve a video containing highly sensitive material before it lands into the wrong hands and creates total havoc. Their journey is riddled with numerous encounters of both strange people and incidents that will ultimately affect/scar them forever, even if merely on a superficial level.
Whilst the film is aimed at a predominately teenage audience, it will prove to be thoroughly enjoyable to an audience of 15 to 50years of age. However those offended by course language, sexual references and gratuitous female nudity are advised to steer clear, as the unrated dvd edition of ROAD TRIP goes that little bit further than its theatrical version.
On that note, let me give you a rundown on the dvd itself. The film is featured for the first time in its complete uncut, uncensored and unrated edition, which basically breaks down to a few scene extensions and alternative shots not contained in the theatrical release actually incorporated into the movie itself. As this is the US import, you have a choice of either a DTS 5.1 soundtrack or the standard Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack (my preference as I got a DD 5.1 set-up at home). The picture remains in its original theatrical ratio of 1.85:1, which some will consider to be quite a bonus during one particular sequence in the film (ie. the obligatory shower scene). In terms of special features, the disc contains seven deleted scenes aptly titled `Road Kills', a behind the scenes featurette hosted by Tom Green called `Ever Been On A Road Trip', a music video by the Eels `Mr E's Beautiful Blues' and two theatrical trailers, all this in addition to the standard cast & crew bios and production notes. An audio commentary by with director Todd Phillips, executive producer Ivan Reitman and comedian/star Tom Green would have been awesome but you've to be grateful for what you get and all in all its an awesome package.

1315920,3,B00003CXIY,"""Road Trip"" is sometimes funny, occasionally hilarious, but mostly puerile and sophomoric.  It is yet another boorish lampoon of college life that relies on heavy doses of outrageousness, crassness and crudely sexual jokes to lure its audience.  It was successful in this regard, grossing (no pun intended) close to $70 million on a meager $15 million budget.  The film clearly targets MTV males and it knows its audience, offering plenty of gratuitous female nudity and chauvinistic aphorisms like, ""It's not cheating if you're not in the same area code.""  I really don't have a problem with nudity, but having half a dozen scenes that linger gapingly on topless women who don't contribute anything to the story is nothing more than tasteless voyeurism used to pump up the testosterone factor.
The story itself is a flimsy and predictable excuse for a sitcom.  Writer/Director Todd Phillips throws so much outlandish foolishness at the audience that he can't help but get a laugh every few minutes.  In this regard, I have to give him credit for a job well done.  He manages the actors and the comedy bits well and keeps the pace up.
The acting is probably the best part of the film.  Breckin Meyer is excellent as the tortured hero trying to beat the videotape of his indiscretion to his girlfriend's dorm room.  Meyer has a dry and deadpan wit that works well with all the inanity around him.  MTV veteran Tom Green is so far around the bend in this film that he can see his own derriere.  Green is a master of shock comedy and will do or say anything to get a reaction, including eating a live mouse.  My favorite newcomer was DJ Qualls who played Kyle, the bashful geek whose looks alone provide continual physical comedy.
I usually enjoy lowbrow slapstick comedy but this was zanier than even I could handle.  I rated it a 6/10.  Add two points if you are in college and another two points if you are a male 25 or under.  This film is not for the genteel or for those offended by vulgarity, nudity or promiscuity.",977443200,9,2019,4.647887323943662
1315921,5,B00003CXIY,"Road Trip is one of the funniest movies I have seen this year. Breckin Meyer, Tom Green and Sean William Scott are the main characters and are very funny.
The DVD has some nice extras such as a video by the Eel's and some deleted scenes that didn't make in the final cut of the film.
Overall, its a very funny movie, and will likely appeal to those that loved the American Pie movie.
Laugther is the best medicine, and you will get a lot of laughs from Road Trip.

1315986,3,B00003CXIY,"Let me begin by saying that this is a good movie, with a huge amount of laughs intact.  I was a huge fan of the theatrical release and saw it twice with yes, good intentions.  The DvD itself does not have a whole lot of extras, but the deleted scenes are very amusing.  They easily bring up the question, ""Why weren't these included in the theatrical version?"".  Some of the deleted scenes are side splittingly funny, some just strange.  Either way, they are enjoyable.  The transfer is not the absolute best in the world, but it is good for our non-pesamistic dvd viewers. The ""Unrated"" classification for the movie makes me think....there really not that much different from the movie than from the theatrical.  Still good though.
So, if you liked the movie, definately pick it up.  It will sit right next to American Pie in your collection nicely.",977356800,,850,4.657718120805369

1315993,3,B00003CXIY,"Tears pages from a ton of different movies successes, but it is still pretty funny.
The movie's concept is a definite rip - a movie I just saw about a week ago documents the same thing - a guy sends his college girlfriend the infamous 'sex tape' and then tries to get to her to get the tape back. The movie starred Paul Rudd and Reese Witherspoon and was called ""Overnight Delivery.""
This movie's unique quality would be the diversity of its actors - it seems to be a much more diverse casting than the 'teen dream' castings of American Pie (which featured some of the most attractive teens in America 'stuck' as virgins) and She's All That (which pinned Rachael Leigh Cook as the 'ugly girl' - are you kidding????). This movie features an 'ugly guy' who - apologies to DJ Qualls - is actually not that attractive. The movie also seems to try and capitalize on Tom Green's popularity - it almost seems like they expanded his part, or even added his part, due to his growing popularity due to his hilarious MTV show. Breckin Meyer was great as Josh and Seann William Scott continues playing the jerk/jock role very well. Andy Dick is absolutely hilarious as well as very unrecognizable, hotel clerk.
The script isn't that creative, but it does have some highs, but with the highs come some lows. There were some parts that dragged - Green's character Barry telling the story - although essential to the story, seemed a bit more than necessary. The movie was quick - less than an hour and 20 minutes - but it worked in most parts, but the ending could have been expanded at the end. I don't want to spoil the ending, but if you watch the film, you'll notice that everything seems to change in the blink of an eye.
There was great deal of nudity - which surprised me - and I've heard Amy Smart was not very well briefed for the extent of her nudity. But she said that later she understood and it worked with the role.
Overall, it was definitely a better teen movie than the past few months have seen (Whatever It Takes) - but still didn't have that classic element that American Pie truly grasped.",976579200,3,2094,4.455729166666667

If you're looking for some sort of amazing movie that was incredibly well done in ""Road Trip"", then all I have to tell you is that you're a complete idiot.

I believe if my count was correct that approximately 4 or 5 profane words are uttered. I mention this because I felt the Director Todd Phillips did a wonderful and insightful job of finally portraying college students as being more than just absurd and weird individuals. He also helps to portray most of the students in this film as being decent fun loving people with a good perspective on having fun.
