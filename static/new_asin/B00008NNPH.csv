1854242,4,B00008NNPH,"I guess I'm a Mira Nair fan.  I saw her Mississippi Masala (1992) and thought it was a great success.  I believed her to be an ethnic director, dealing with Indian matters.  I was wrong.  The girls of Bayonne, NJ are authentic to their nails and accents.  Uma Thurman gives it up, not the glamour girl we're used too, but a thirty something bar fly unable to land a man.  It's not that she's unattractive, this is Uma we're talking about, but she is socially retarded because her daddy ran out on the family.  Consequently, she hits all the wrong notes in interaction with the local Jersey Guys.  The stress has caused symptoms, hysterical blindness, as her tone-deaf social antics at the local nightspot resemble the antics of immature high school girls.  Her friend, beautifully played by Juliette Lewis is just a little bit smarter, but not much.  They dream about being really hot when they were sixteen.  Lewis' grade school daughter, April Autumn is crying out for a responsible mother.  Meanwhile, Ben Gazarra, still suave after all these years, is romancing Uma's mom, Gina Rowlands.  This is a slice of life movie.  The pill freed women back in the 50's, but one wonders if it did them any good.",1117497600,,1204,4.671428571428572
1854243,5,B00008NNPH,"I sought out this movie because 1) It was made by Mira Nair, and 2) I am an ex-patriot of New Jersey. After viewing the delightful ""Monsoon Wedding"", I have taken an interest in Ms. Nair's talent, and ""Hysterical Blindness"" expertly captures the character of its environs. This movie is to New Jersey what ""Fargo"" was to Minnesota. (Yes I know that Fargo is in North Dakota, but who wants to call a movie ""Brainerd""? Or ""Bayonne"", for that matter?)

""Hysterical Blindness"" features spot-on acting by the cast, portraying lost and lonely characters. Uma Thurman captures the high-strung and neurotic Debbie with an inspiring performance. Here is a beautiful young woman whose utter cluelessness and total inability to be spontaneous prevent her from making any sort of real connection to anyone. Some of the scenes are truly cringe-inducing, reflecting the sheer desperation of the situation.

Perhaps to the reader, this doesn't sound like ""entertainment"", but don't lose me yet. There is much humor in the friendship of Debbie and Beth (Juliette Lewis), and Beth's adolescent daughter. Then there is the sweet love story between Debbie's mother, a waitress, (Gena Rowlands) and one of her customers at the diner (Ben Gazzara). The couple's grace at falling in love contrasts starkly to Debbie's attempts to force it, making it all the more painful.

After viewing the movie on DVD, I immediately watched it again in the version which includes Ms. Nair's commentary, which further cemented my respect for her and that of the players of this performance. If we are honest with ourselves, it will be easy to empathize with these characters, even as we may think we are laughing at them. Don't judge this DVD by its cover; it looks like a piece of trash, when in fact Mira Nair has created another fine piece of work.",1114387200,15,1814,4.921568627450981
1854244,3,B00008NNPH,"While Ms Lewis and Ms. Thurman are both fantastic, I didn't enjoy the film. Simply too depressing, and I just did not see the point.

The girls did not even look very good in their eighties get-ups.",1091577600,2,198,4.351351351351352
1854245,5,B00008NNPH,"This movie was unsettling and hard to watch...I mean that in the best way. Uma Thurman in particular was so pathetic, so clueless and vulnerable....just desperate for acceptance...it was hearbreaking. Watching her character feign happiness and mold herself and her ideals to whatever man happened to be paying attention to her at the moment had me riveted. I have never been so impressed with Uma Thurman...FABULOUS STORY...watch it.",1080172800,23,433,5.382352941176471
1854246,5,B00008NNPH,"The performances in this movie are brilliant, but, it also gave me the creeps. I say this because it was so dead-on accurate in portraying the neighborhood I grew up in, and, the lives of ""quiet desperation"" that many there lived. At the time in which this movie takes place, I was working in a factory in upstate New York. The mentality displayed in this picture, of  ""you're born, ya work, ya party...."" is how most of the people I was around at that time unquestioningly and comformingly lived their lives. I am not crazy about most actors today, but, Uma Thurman and Juliette Lewis have always been two of the few exceptions. In this made for HBO film, they immerse themselves so totally in their co-dependant characters that there is not a sign of a *star*, nor that they are performing...they simply ""are"" the two lost, searching souls with nowhere to go, and no way to get there if they did. The '80's were such a tacky decade, and these girls have it all ""down"". Watching them flounder, knowing that they want more out of life than their circumstances have thus far allowed, but not having a clue as to how to begin change, is painful to behold. As are their sad attempts at intimacy and self validation with disinterested men who want nothing more than quick sex. Watching Uma Thurman almost beg a creepy, cavalier one night stand  who's just using her to ""talk to me..."" is heartbreaking. When she asks the bartender ""what's wrong with me?"", it is not a casual comment, but, a cry from the depths. Gena Rowlands is wonderful also as Thurman's waitress mom, who probably was an early training ground for her daughters bad habits, and lack of self esteem. These are not bad people, but, they want desperately to connect, and just don't know how. Also watching Thurman's character, after another night of rejection, crawl into bed with her mother in a desperate and pained reaching out for unconditional comfort, is a very emotional moment. This movie is about depressing lives, but, is ultimately hopeful, and shows that change, growth, and possibilities can sometimes begin with something as simple as a new living room set. And, the slow realization that, while we're all vulnerable,  true happiness begins from within, and, with knowing thyself. I happened upon this movie by chance, and it surprisingly and completely cast its spell on me. A wonderful character study, made into something very special because of the portrayals of Uma Thurman and Juliette Lewis. Watching actors like this is almost an honor. If this sounds like a too extravagant appraisal, it is also because it is so rare. A wonderful experience.",1062806400,77,2627,4.78193832599119
1854247,4,B00008NNPH,If you grew up in the 80s and want a little nostalgia this movie is it. The girls in this story makes you feel ashmed to be watching them they are so out of touch with anybody else in this world. We all know people like this and wonder how they keep existing. The acting is excellant. The story gets a little slow at times but you won't be able to stop watching.,1062720000,,362,3.9726027397260273
1854248,5,B00008NNPH,"No, its not the most fascinating story, or the best 80s nostalgia movie. But it is well directed, and the acting is fan-freaking-tastic! I think that is why HBO hyped it. Uma's character, you just want to smack, her, hug, her , grab her and shake her! She is AWESOME in this role. Juliette Lewis played her part well. The actress who plays Uma's character's mother (forgive me I don't know her name) is also very very good. If you watch this movie, get by the fact that it is kind of boring, you see just how sweet the stars were in their roles. All totally convincing and perfectly getting the message across. Uma's character has serious issues and no shame. Lewis's character is a sweetheart who has over the years gotten used to her shameless, issue-laden friend. Uma's mother in the film is sweet and smart. I cant get over the acting in this movie, good direction too. Worthy of five stars regardless of the boring plot. DO NOT watch this is you want an 80s nostalgia flick (If you did, you are probably one of the people who gave this movie a bad review). Watch it for bitchin' performances and you will not be disappointed.",1056067200,4,1130,4.463768115942029
1854249,3,B00008NNPH,"Uma Thurman, Juliette Lewis and Gena Rowlands star in this small, constrained indie drama about three womens' lives unfolding in a desparate, bittersweet way.  Thurman and Lewis (playing a single mother) are two circa 30-ish women who frequent their local bar, ""Ollies,"" trolling for love, affection, and men with relationship potential. And boy are they fishing in the wrong sea! But they don't quite realize it, at least not for most of the film. The film's title ""Hysterical Blindness"" is a play on words which reflects the searching mostly in vain of the two young women in the film to find real love in a mostly deserted place, and also a description of an ailment which Thurman's character struggles with: under severe stress, she loses her vision, literally, and becomes 'hysterically blind.' Rowlands plays Thurman's mother, a woman whose husband left her suddenly when Thurman's character was 13, a sad and defining moment in both women's lives, and one which they both have yet to fully come to terms with. Solidly working class, Thurman works in a sewing factory of sorts, and Rowlands' character is a waitress in a diner.
When I say that the film is about lives unfolding, that isn't entirely true, because these lives threaten to never really unfold at all. One worries that the lives of these characters will never really take flight or emerge in the way that they could, should, or are supposed to. It's like watching a starting-to-unfurl cocoon, that never really keeps unfurling. These women are stuck, in their habits, their jobs, their way of thinking, their 'place' in life, and though they are beautiful and kind and have things to offer, one gets the feeling that somehow they will likely never get where they should be going, that the greyness and dusty shroudedness of their cocoons will never really fade away or change. Although they *could* go somewhere, maybe not ""far,"" whatever that would be, but at least somewhere new in their lives, somewhere meaningful, in all their colors and glory and vibrant wings, the fact that they don't seem headed in that direction in any significant way that makes it a bit of a downer of a film. As much as the end would like to have you believe it is hopeful, or that the characters have changed to a significant enough degree that their lives will have more meaning and clarity and beauty, the ending is too small and short and ordinary, and it hasn't been properly built up to enough to really get where it needs to, or is trying to, or seems to think it is going.
As typical indie fare, the film has a character-driven plot (though really there isn't much of a plot, over-all), with some symbolism strewn in here and there, and some definite emotive moments. But the film doesn't add up to much really, in its scope or storyline or message. What really shines here I guess is the acting. Both Juliette Lewis and Uma Thurman truly inhabit their characters and, especially in the case of Thurman's character, really convey her sense of desparation and loneliness, her utter need and unhappiness.
I recommend it as a look at some really amazing acting, but not for too many other reasons. There are just too many other indie films that are better or more well-rounded or have a greater scope. All that being said, I'm glad I saw it, and the idea of being 'hysterically blind' due to the utter desparate notion of relying entirely on others, specifically men (if you are a woman) for your happiness, and how much of a mistake that is, does come through loud and clear. And it was nice to see two beautiful and elegant Hollywood actresses really going no-holds barred in portraying somewhat hopeless, hapless and not very intelligent characters (not to mention entirely unglamorous.. though Thurman is beautiful despite herself here.. it just makes you wish she Knew how much she had to offer, and how little sense it made for her to act as desparate as she did in this film. At least one gets the sense that as the film went on, she was starting to get the idea, which made it bearable.) Gena Rowlands, in her role as Thurman's mother, also does well, but not spectacularly. All three women have done better work in better pictures, but this is one is on their filmic resume, so fans should still make a point to see it.",1053302400,6,4282,4.7017310252996

Gena Rowland is wonderful, as always.  It's basically a story of two women who hit the bars, both hoping to find a decent man. One of them (Juliette Lewis) is a mother who should really have her young child taken away from her by the courts.  She has no business running off nights and leaving her little girl alone while she looks for ""Mr. Goodbar"".  Uma Thurman has a pitiful role as a real bar slut, who wants to meet Mr. Right but she never will because of her dress and her demeanor.  She is easy, and the men know it.

Debbie and Beth are a pair of 30-ish singles, seeking 'true love' and trying to recapture past glory days of effortless beauty and the possibilities that come with being 16 with a whole life yet ahead.

 Though some dynamics have evolved, the social scene of much of 1980's New Jersey was claustrophobic and limited. Particularly in some cultures of that era, such as Italian, young people often paired off very young, many girls engaged or married around 21. In contrast, Beth and Debbie seem to have 'missed the bus' somehow. Though both women are attractive, their overall approach and demeanor serves to effectively limit their choices. In that time frame, by the time a woman was 30, there just weren't a lot of quality single men left. It might seem ludicrous that someone who is on the cusp of 30 would feel like a has-been, but in their specific time and sub-culture, Debbie and Beth's wistful loneliness is plausible.

Certain scenes in the film are unforgettable, ""cringe inducing"" as other commentators have noted, and some scenes heartbreaking. When Beth describes almost finding love and marriage with her child's father, while she and Debbie are in a grocery store, her regret and loneliness is palpable. Though Beth is trying too hard and making some serious parenting mistakes along the way, she seems to realize that for her child's sake she must begin making better choices.

It is Debbie who is pathological, and possessed of a truly disturbing desperation. Debbie displays an appalling lack of self-respect, and such poor comprehension of adult relationships that she offers herself sexually to a stranger who is obviously exploitative. Debbie's pick-up, a 20-something man named Rick, treats her with such barely revealed disdain, almost disgust, that he refuses to let Debbie sleep on his bed, insisting they remain on the floor. When her pathetic prodding causes Rick to 'allow' Debbie to sleep on his bed, her smile is tragic. In her deluded manner of thinking, which has become habitual, Debbie comes to the inane conclusion that Rick may be 'the one,' that she could ""wind up getting married or something."" Even gullible Beth recognizes Debbie's 'relationship' with Rick for what it is, and gazes at her friend with worried expressions.

 One thing that can never be said about the Rick character, is that he ever leads Debbie on. It is quite the opposite; he sends barely concealed messages of his distaste for Debbie repeatedly. He refuses to allow her to make breakfast for him, and later cruelly stiffs her on a dinner date at her place. But when the viewer watches the interplay between them, it is clear that he is telling Debbie loud and clear that she is nothing but a one-night-stand, and a sleazy one at that. Where most women would be completely repulsed by Rick's shoddy behavior, and vow to have nothing again to do with such a person, Debbie doesn't even begin to 'get it.' Or does she?? For when Debbie experiences the worst of Rick's treatment, a ray of pain bolts through her head and she squeezes her eyelids tight seemingly hoping to block out the unbearable reality in front of her.

While the Debbie/Rick story is playing itself out, a drama driven and created almost entirely by Debbie, her mother, played by the still stunning Gena Rowlands, is falling genuinely and beautifully in love with a kind gentleman of a guy played by the charismatic Ben Gazzara. However, in this love affair, Gena will find truth in the saying, ""It was too good to be true."" But her loss will not be due to any character defect in Nicky, as he turns out to be a true prince. It is a different sad reality of life that will endanger Mrs. Miller's new and wonderful love affair. The results are nothing less than shattering, and will break the viewers heart.  Ultimately Debbie realizes just who Nicky was, and that the loss is hers as well, and staggeringly painful.

However, Mrs. Miller will take from her lovely affair a new lease on life, so to speak, and puts in motion a few small but precious lessons that her gem of a man has taught her. Through intense mutual pain and loss, mother and daughter do find each other. They discover that sometimes all that one can offer is silent understanding, and simply being there to hold someone who is grieving.

Debbie's miserable Rick debacle comes to a horrid conclusion one night in the bar she frequents. Already very depressed, she is drinking heavily and quickly spirals embarrassingly out of control. Wildly dancing around the bar, Debbie practically slams into Rick unexpectedly. Raw with grief and emotion, a drunken Debbie spills her brokenness all over the unsuspecting Rick. He responds without a trace of empathy, only intensely angry that Debbie has embarrassed him, and cruelly rejects her with an ugliness that is painful to witness. Debbie's debasement is so humiliating that a female acquaintance who clearly dislikes her is embarrassed for Debbie and expresses concern. As vile as the moment is, and certainly one that Debbie will remember for the rest of her life, it seems to serve as a wake up call, a catalyst prompting Debbie to turn to those who love and value her. Though extremely painful, her mother's broken heart, and Rick's rejection serve to get Debbie off the desperate ride to Hell she has been on.

1854328,5,B00008NNPH,"There is something about the desperation of these characters that just draws you to love this film. You cannot help but fall in love with Debby and Beth. Although I was a kid in the 80s, I remember those times and seeing so many people act this way. My older sister had many friends just like these two girls and I am sure she did similar things to have a good time and became wrapped up in the moment of a guy with ""Patrick Swayze eyes"". The music is awesome as I am huge fan of 80s music which made it such a memorable decade.

The story of two ""white trash"" girls looking for fun and love in the 80s and an older woman finding love once again. Uma's character is so needy that she believes so strongly that sex on the first date could leave to a real, loving relationship. Juliette's character of being a single Mother who just wants to keep ""herself"" is understandable. You can really see in this film that Debby has some jealousy of her friend, possibly because Beth has that extension of life (a child) and the fact that men find Beth desirable because she is not needy. If you have not personally experienced this, you most likely know of someone that has therefore this film is relatable to many people. I could watch this movie over and over and never get tired of it. I always tell people about this movie and they can't wait to see it.

Uma Thurman grabs this character with the tightest grip and brings you into the film with her. Juliette Lewis is such an amazing actress, smooth, carefree and often quite crazy.

This HBO movie is a fun, sort of tragic tale of 3 women finding love and companionship in the late 80's in Jersey. Uma is a little over the top (fantastically) as desperate Debbie trying to find a boyfriend, while her mother (Gena) finds one, but things turn tragic. Beth (Juliette) has had one, lost him, (not explained how) and now has her companion, a 9 yr. old daughter.
 The bar scenes are terrific, especially with the throwback music pumping loudly in the background, just as you remember it when you were there in great old 1988!
 You root for Debbie, yet she never really wins, however, the ending of the film is sweetly subtle; giving off a message that these three gals are totally content being each other's companions, fending off the fear of loneliness.",1303776000,,809,4.572413793103448
1854345,3,B00008NNPH,"This movie actually hits base for alot of girls.  Girls can be so dumb sometimes when they think they have to find a man to make them happy.  Thank God, most girls end up OK and have successful marriages but the things they do when young is sad.  I liked the movie, mostly because of Uma Thurman and Juliette Lewis. They make the movie.",1290988800,,336,4.21875

1854348,4,B00008NNPH,"A fine, albeit grim, and realistic portrait of two young women in the 1980s who are not among the lucky ones. Rings true. I found the story and performances engrossing. Uma Thurman's character is complex and leaves an impression, like someone you have known in your life. The chaos of a desperate and hopeless fog developing into a partly cloudy day, with just the slightest glimmer of hope, is the paltry emotional pay-off of this film. Not enough for everyone I think. If you greatly value answers, closure, and/or happy endings in a film, I think you'll want to bypass this one. Only hopelessly serious drama fans need apply.",1250640000,2,628,4.770642201834862

1854371,5,B00008NNPH,"Sure, it's essentially a soap opera, but the acting and writing are superb. HBO does it again. Uma Thurman is great, so is Juliette Lewis and so are Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara. Everything works here. The cheesy DVD cover doesn't do this justice.",1230422400,,248,4.659090909090909
1854372,4,B00008NNPH,"This is a movie made for HBO TV, but the cast is great: Uma Thurman, Juliette Lewis and Gena Rowlands all three fine actresses who deliver great performances in this film by Mira Nair.  We meet two young women who are life long friends.  One has a child by her first love, while the other one has never been married or had a meaningful relationship.  Both are desperate to find love, get married and have a real family.  The problem is that they are trying too hard and they are going to the wrong places such as ""Ollie's Bar"" where guys care only for one night stand, not for a commitment.  As film is progressing, we learn that they are really searching for their fathers since that seems to be the common thread for all of them.  They have fathers who have abandoned families when these women were young teenagers and that experience has definitely left an emotional mark on them.  The mother-daughter relationships are also complicated and director is not afraid to explore that side too.  This is not a ""chick flick"" but rather a movie about complicated inner lives of cross generational women.  Great cast and acting.",1214179200,2,1123,4.603015075376884
1854373,5,B00008NNPH,"I cannot say enough about the performances of Thurman and Lewis in this wonderful character study set in the late 1980s.  Thurman nailed her character -- a lonely working girl who spent her nights in a bar looking for love.  I ached to hear her struggle to connect on any level with the guy who took her home for nothing more than sex on his living room floor.  In desperation to hang onto this man, Thurman heartbreakingly begs to make him breakfast, which he refuses, then asks to make him a dinner of fillet mignon.  Lewis is pefect as the too-young mother whose sense of socializing is stalled at age 16.  Kudos to the make-up and stylists, too.  The raccoon-smudged eyeliner and stringy hair punctuated by overcurled bangs was perfect.  Thurman and Lewis are two very gifted actors",1185148800,4,786,4.6521739130434785
1854374,4,B00008NNPH,"This movie shows a side of human behavior I've never seen in cinema before, but have indeed in life. Uma Thurman, Juliette Lewis, and Gena Rowlands give nuanced, believable performances that suck you in to what is essentially a character piece. The story is thin, but that doesn't matter because we can all relate to what the characters are going through. It concerns 2 best friends (Uma and Juliette) and their quest for love at their local hangout, the neighborhood bar. We all know how hopeless, futile and tragic that is. Great slice of life film.",1180224000,,551,4.75
1854375,5,B00008NNPH,"I just cannot understand how this movie didn't get critically acclaimed. It is an amazing piece. At times cringingly reminiscent of my own mistakes in my youth, but an extraodinary script and the most amazing acting story.

It is about two women, 'pushing thirty' as it says in the blurb above. The difference here is that they have never grown up into adult relationships, they are searching for something which they think is an adult relationship, but searching in the same places, the bar the have always gone to. The men are all just the same, and everything is towards a casual one night stand.

It is set in the mid 1980's, the hair is Jersey-big, the jeans skinny stretch stove pipes and the accents nasal whines. But Juliette Lewis and Uma thurmas utterly pin their characters down. They are helped along but an extraodinary script and great direction. The neediness Uma Thurman's character, at once picky and judging, the next whining and needy, and then in another moment, coquettishly naive. I am not normally a fan of Juliette Lewis but she absolutely takes this character, the lost dreamer, and makes it her own. She is almost stifled by her need to help Uma's character, and support her own daughter, that her own life becomes crushed (willingly it seems) beneath everything else.

I bought the DVD in the end because I found it so powerful and multilayered that I wanted to see it a few more times and watch the extraodinary relationships and subtle subtexts of the movie.

If you want to watch something that really show cases these talents, and yet does it without grandstanding you will enjoy this. It is very much a story of hope, and if nothing else it has a great 80's sound track!",1169856000,6,1702,4.682274247491639
1854376,5,B00008NNPH,"""Hysterical Blindness"" Is such a good movie because its so accurate  and honest plus the performances are amazing.

Uma Thurman Plays Debbie an insecure young woman whos life revolves around the neighborhood bar ""Ollies "" She and Her best friend Beth played by the equally talented Julliett Lewis haunt Ollies  looking for mr right only to find that he isn't there.

Thurman's portrayal of the desperate, promiscuous Debbie is heart wrenching but amazing to watch. .The always wonderful Gena Rowlands  who also gives an exellent and endearing performance as Debbies mom Virginia, a waitress at the local diner with love woes of her own.

Some of the scenes with Debbie ""Uma"" and Rick played by the sexy  Justin Chambers ""whom she meets at Ollies"" are painful to watch and make you feel embarrassed for her because of the way she throws herself at him and almost begs him to love her.

The reason I love the movie so much besides the script and cast are the soundtrack and the dead on accuracy the film captures of the mid 80's also it reminds me of myself and my best girlfriend  when we would go out and run straight to the ladies room check our selves, spray our hair, apply more make up then dance the night away. I highly recommend this movie it has something for everyone ,I watch it  often.",1167177600,3,1296,4.595652173913043
1854377,5,B00008NNPH,"This movie is emotional and real. The characters are ones that you can understand and at times seem to be the mirror image of you. Uma's drive to be in a relationship clouds her mind to what is going on around her. As the movie progresses you see how low and desperate this drive can be and when she hits rock bottom it is a pain that you can emphasize with. The end show that you have to enjoy life for what you have and not for what you don't have. Her desperation and jealousy lead her to be ""blind"" to what is going on around her. She doesn't share the joy that is around her and as a result she is bitter. This movie is a must have for anyone that has ever been though this or felt that way. By watching her mistakes one can see how damaging those feelings and actions are.",1166572800,,778,4.025806451612903
1854378,5,B00008NNPH,"She , Debby, could have used some good advice.  Borrowing from Jacqueline Carey, you can't find love where it isn't and you can't hide love where it is, this film tells a story of a pathetic woman who just doesn't see too clearly. She has bouts of blindness and the doctor has told her it is caused by stress.  She is absolutely desperate, completely so, and so blind to her own circumstances that it takes a bartender to tell her that she ""don't see things to good"".  She's just pitiful throwing herself at, what her dumb friend can plainly see, is a mean guy, just because he has ""Patrick Swayze eyes"".  She throw's it all out in front of him, making a total and complete jerk of herself, and he uses her and proceeds to  get rid of her right away and she's so wild with desperation that she actually thinks there is something there.

Debby's proud of her special parking spot by the bar, like that makes her special.  She's proud of her Camaro, like that makes her special.  She pulls out all the stops to get what she needs, but the problem is, she's grasping like a drowning person. EVERYONE CAN SEE IT!  BUT HER!  SHE'S HYSTERICALLY BLIND!  Uma does such a fine, painful job of portraying this character, that it just makes you ache for her.  I wanted to have a talk with her and explain to her what everyone else can plainly see, I wanted to be her friend, and then I remembered this is a movie! I love it when a movie can make me forget I am watching a movie.

I found it odd when Ben Gazzara's character told her he could see that she was smart.  She really liked that but she seemed pretty stupid, so I don't know if that line was meant to show that Gazzara's character's kindness or if it meant something deeper, but if it did it was lost on me. Maybe she was a smart woman trapped in an emotionally blind woman's body.  Another thing I wondered was the bridge in the background.  I looms over the characters like a dark cage trapping them all into this dismal existance, at the same time being the only way out.

Some people found this movie humorous but I didn't find it funny at all.  I thought it

was dark and painful but the honesty of it simply overwhelmed me.  Uma and Juliette, two of my favorites, deliver powerful performances.  If it was a budget movie, they certainly didn't waste their money on stars.  Gena Rowlands may have been a little too classy for the role, if there was any problems at all with casting. I think she had a hard time bringing it down, which I know Gena can do because I've seen her do it in other films.  Her clothes were a little too expensive looking  to represent most old waitresses I have known, but that isn't her fault, is it?

This is a great movie if you're interested in serious acting talent.",1148515200,8,2751,4.30544747081712
1854379,5,B00008NNPH,"This has to be one of Uma's top performances, ever. Her part has to be one of the most real characters ever written about. You saw her not as a role, but as a real person. You may have saw yourself in her, or you may have you seen thousands of other girls in her. In reality, all she wants is love. Just to feel love, and to be loved. She is willing to go to any depths possible to find it. Desperation, so to speak.

When watching 'Hysterical Blindess' you almost forget you're engaged in a film, it seems like you're watching the world around you. Because this is it...this isn't some fiction story that you know is impossible to ever happen..this is what goes on in the real world that surrounds us.

Definitely check out this film, I do believe you'll enjoy it. Juliette Lewis & Gena Rowlands also give all-star performances.",1126310400,2,829,4.376623376623376
1854380,3,B00008NNPH,"There will always be females who can't be alone. We've all known at least one of them.  They're the ones who sit at the bar night after night hoping that this time, Mr. Right will walk in and make all their dreams come true.  Hysterical Blindness is a movie about two lifelong friends who are so oblivious to what's really going on around them that they became that clich.

Uma Thurman and Juliette Lewis are consummate actresses.  Perhaps that's why this film was so painful to watch - they both did very well portraying twentysomethings with little self respect. Debbie's (Uma) father left her and her mom when she was 13; her motives for bar slumming are classic, obvious, and sad.  Beth (Juliette) has a daughter whom she leaves at home alone to go bar hopping with Debbie nearly every night. They repeatedly trade their dignity and their sexuality for that very temporary illusion of closeness with a guy (aka, ""one night stands"").  Neither one of them knows how to not flirt with any eligible male that shows them the slightest interest.

As you might expect, this outlook on life leads them into some bleak situations.  Debbie imagines that a guy she meets one night is much more into her than he really is and starts throwing herself at him in a lot of embarrassing stunts to get and keep his attention.  Beth nearly loses her daughter.  There's a very pointed moral to this story about appreciating your friends and loved ones, not looking for something that isn't there and facing reality - all very true in my opinion.

What really didn't grab me about Hysterical Blindness was the fact that it was paced so slowly that it seemed to take forever to get around to making its point; meanwhile, I can relate to Debbie all to well on some level, which is a painful thing.  It drags me back to that time in my own life where I was just as insecure in my own way.  Not a nice place to revisit, even if honest.  And I was bored even then.

So, if you're really into Uma and Juliette, this is a brilliant showcasing of their talents.  Otherwise, I'd skip Hysterical Blindness in favor of any of the more upbeat chick flicks like 13 Going on 30.
