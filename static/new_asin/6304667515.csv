912263,5,6304667515,"The three movies in this MST collection are an interesting assortment of the things Americans used to fear most: juvenile delinquents, evil scientists, and commies. Plus farming and bad posture (in the shorts accompanying two of the movies).
I've commented on each episode more thoroughly on the individual videos' listings pages. As a combo-pack, these three episodes -- shows 507, 518, and 619 -- are great examples of MST3K in its mid-series years. They also include both Joel (507) and Mike (the others) as host, so nobody should feel slighted. In all, an excellent investment for bargain-minded MSTies.",1006905600,3,607,5.204081632653061

The film quality is horrendous and there are better plots in home movies than in this Coleman Francis stinker. Mike and crew somehow managed to riff this cinematic root canal into an entertaining experience, which is a minor miracle in my opinion.

The guys were really ""on"" for this one and did a terrific job, which was the only reason I could sit through this movie.  Recommended only with the crew's comedic buffer and lots of adult beverages.",1408060800,,545,4.666666666666667

I'm a huge fan (I even like Manos), but this and 'Batwoman' are off my list.  The movie is the usual Coleman Francis, including his infatuation with small planes, but this one's not campy or funny-bad, it's just bad.

912382,5,6304667515,"Shout! Factory has been kind enough to re-issue single DVDs of some MST3k eps that have previously been available from Rhino, but have since fallen out of print. This particular episode is, in my opinion, one of the best they've done, easily in my top 10. That said, the movie is awful. But I'll get to that.

This episode starts with an educational short demonstrating the importance of posture when you're speaking publically.  Like most of these educational shorts, some of the advice is okay, some suspect, most of it presented in a way that's truly goofy to see nowadays.  Mike and bots do fine, its not the best short ever, but its solid.

The movie itself, well, its a Coleman Francis flick.  You may remember him from ""The Skydivers"" and ""Beast of Yucca Flats"", films which he also wrote, directed and appeared in, and which have also gained some fame from being exceptionally good episodes of Mystery Science Theater.  Its amazing to think that in three films one can develop a signature film style.  They call Francis an ""autuer"" in this one and they're not wrong.  Like any other Coleman Francis film, you will find in Red Zone Cuba: scenes of people parking cars, close ups of ugly people, shots of people listening while people off screen speak, women being hurt either emotionally or physically, someone in light aircraft shooting and killing someone running in a dessert, Tony Cardoza, characters that are evil and corrupt at worst or morally ambivalent at best, terrible editing, dialogue so unconnected it borders on being surreal, and non-stop continuity problems, all filmed so poorly in black and white that it's more accurate to say its filmed in light gray and dark gray.  Yes, if depression were a director, its films would look like Coleman Francis'.

Red Zone Cuba is probably his most depsressing film, but its also notable as being his most out-scaled.  Sometimes low budget filmmakers will try to make something big and meaningful when they have no talent, time or resources to pull it off.  Ed Wood did just that with Plan 9 From Outer Space.  Coleman Francis does the same thing with Red Zone Cuba.  While Franci's The Skydivers was still a complete failure, it was a small movie, chronicling the love, heartbreak and betrayal of a few people in a small town.  Red Zone Cuba attempts to show a US Military invasion of a foreign country, using about 15 guys, a jeep, and nothing else.  It fails in its artistic goals the same way my car fails at being a spaceship.  But its not THAT it fails that makes it exeptional, its HOW it fails.

Here's the plot:  Two drifters named Landis and Cook meet an escaped fugitive named Griffin (Coleman Francis himself) in the desert and wander around.  They hear that the military will give you a thousand dollars sign up bonus for enlisting, so they trade their truck for an airplane ride to a military base by Cherokee Jack, a mentally handicapped man who loves declaring his own name, and, luckily for our three hobos, can fly better than he can spell.  Upon arrival at the base, they easily enlist, as the military of the 1960's apparently never runs any background checks to see if anyone enlisting might be an escaped convict.  At the base they meet Sgt. Justine, a vaguely latino guy who has a tungsten and uranium mine.  After much small talk (culminating in Griffin partially strangling Landis for talking about Griffin's wife), the soldiers train for about two minutes by climbing hills and tossing people over their shoulder.  Griffin, when asked to play craps with a random soldier, responds by jamming the mans head into his crotch, then walks away.  The three men try to escape their military duties by just walking away from the base, but are quickly corraled by the commanding officer, who debriefs the men for their invasion of Cuba using what looks like a map he drew in about 5 seconds on a dirty cocktail napkin.  End of Act 1.

We now move to the invasion itself, which is so unbelievably pathetic its hilarious.  About 6 soldiers run around on a beach in fast motion, climb ropes, and run right up Castro's front yard.  Castro is just Tony Cardoza in a terrible fake beard.  Our three protagonists get captured almost immediately by a guy walking out of an outhouse.  They're put in a POW garden shed with a few other soldiers, the Frito Bandito and Sgt. Justine, who had gotten shot in the leg during the invasion.  They watch as their commanding officer and another guy get executed by firing squad, the commanding officer apparently getting paintballed at the same time.  Justine is dying, so they ask for water about 300 times, and upon getting close to the guard, Griffin snaps his neck.  Had to be pretty easy to kill him, since the guard was being played by the guy who was just killed by the firing squad.  They escape from the garden shed and run to an airstrip while Castro and some soldiers are following in a jeep so broken down, it apparently can't catch up to two hobos on foot, followed by a lightly jogging 300lb man.  They look for a plane with fuel to escape from Cuba in, since one of the guys is apparently a pilot.  End of Act 2.

The final part of the film takes place back in America, though the way its edited leaves you guessing where they're supposed to be for the first five minutes, as the escape from Cuba is so incomplete and poorly filmed (not to mention Cuba looks just like everywhere else in this movie) that the movie just smashes into the next scene with no coherency whatsoever.  The three bums wander over to a diner where a depressed skeleton of a man has scrawled his entire menu on the surrounding buildings.  They talk to him and listen to his blind daughter (""She's been blind since her husband was killed in the war,"" the skeleton man informs us) play horrible clomping dirges on a piano in the other room.  Eventually they get fed up with the diner guy, attack him, and throw him down a well.  Griffin goes back and steals the single penny that was in the cash register.  They walk around some more, Griffin whips Landis so he can have Landis' ring, which they trade for a used car.  Then they drive to Justine's wifes house (!!!) where they tell her that her husbands dead while stuffing their faces on all her food.  They take her with them to mine some tungsten when the cops finally catch up with Griffin and a chase happens.  Griffin kills Justine's wife, a farmer picks her up and brings her body back to her house in the back of his pick up truck, right when Justine comes limping back home from Cuba!  Because this is a Coleman Francis film, the movie ends with Griffin getting gunned down in a field by a guy in a helicopter.

This movie is so wonderfully incompetent and weird.  The grim, serious tone just adds to the ubelievable madness of this film.  It would probably be pretty punishing movie without Mike and the bots, but they really do a fantastic job on this one.  The riffing is fast, furious, and so very funny.  As MST3k goes, this one is top shelf, easily in my list of top 10 episodes.  The DVD is just the episode, no extras, but that's fine.  This is one of their best, own it today!",1364601600,4,7141,4.567949725058916
912383,4,6304667515,"As MST3k is sort of show within a show within a movie (with a short for this one) format, it is better to review the individual parts in order to grade the episode.

The Movie: After running into and protecting a recent escape convict, two ex-cons take the trip of the lifetime and become involved in a historical moment.  I won't ruin this movie but it makes the history changing events in ""Forrest Gump"" look extremely plausible.  Don't like historical movies?  Don't worry because the last third completely ignores all previous plots as our ""heroes"" go on a killing spree.  Be prepared for constant close ups, smoking, a very lively soundtrack, smoking, the longest execution in movie history, smoking, and the most depressing scenery ever captured on film.  The only redeeming item of this movie is the really cool opening song.

Riffs: Between the acting, scenery, plot, - well everything, Mike and the bots have a lot to mock.  The riffing was constant and there were some really great zingers.  The fact I made it through this movie is a testament to the power of MST3k's riffing greatness as no one could sit through this mess.

Host Segments: I really did not enjoy any of the segments.  The continued Dr. Forrester story was predictable and I did not know the person Mike was impersonating.

Other: The opening is a short on posture and appearance that was probably shown at schools.  Apparently even back in the 50's, people were judged by their appearance so the movie shows the correct posture for the Eisenhower years.  The riffing is pretty funny and this is one of the better shorts.

Overall: Sometimes a movie is so terrible that it supplies its own ammunition - and that is the case with this one.  Thankfully the riffing is very funny and sort of merciless in its shredding.  I would consider this one of the better riffed MST3k episodes and I give the MST3k team kudos for selecting a non-sci fi / non-horror genre film.  Just please be aware that the movie itself is poorly made and the segments are not that good.",1353974400,3,2036,4.671348314606742

7875843,5,6304667515,"Well, as Lena Lamont said, ""I liked it,"" though more for the riffing than the film itself.  RED ZONE CUBA (also known as NIGHT TRAIN TO MUNDO FINE), is the third and last of director Coleman Francis' feature movies, and the second to be sent up by MST3K. (THE BEAST OF YUCCA FLATS, starring the incomparable Tor Johnson, would follow just two episodes later.)  Francis also wrote and starred in this thing, which at times seems almost a willful exercise in non-continuity (day goes to night and day again, all in one scene), stalled narration (drinking endless cups of coffee and smoking take precedence over action), and unconvincing exposition (the semi-arid landscape in the American sequences would pass for tropical Cuba later on).  Mike and the Bots swing wide and hit hard on this one, attacking everything from Coleman Francis' resemblance to Curly Howard of ""Three Stooges"" fame to the utter absurdity of the ""Cuban"" locales:  ""The Bridges of Madison, Cuba!""  Said Crow at one point, I want to hurt this movie but I can never hurt it the way it hurt me.  He may never have gotten total revenge, but he, Servo and Mike did well enough. What sweetens the deal for me is the hilariously condescending short aimed at adults, ""Speech: Platform, Posture, and Appearance,""  as goofy in its own way as ""Posture Pals"" was for grade-school children.  A good addition to any Mistie collection.",1488153600,,1391,4.839662447257384

7875847,5,6304667515,"RED ZONE CUBA (1966) is the emptiest and most incoherent film of the Coleman Francis trilogy, and that's saying something. An escaped convict and two bums receive 25 minutes of military training and are sent to fight in the Bay of Pigs invasion; when that doesn't work out, they fall back on murder, robbery, and tungsten mining. The End.

If you manage to avoid getting whiplash from all the jump cuts, there's the mind-numbing attention to trivial detail to relax you, along with the usual Coleman Francis trademarks: trigger-happy cops in helicopters, obsessive coffee drinking and smoking scenes, mismatched day and night exteriors, dialogue out of sync with anything happening onscreen, light aircraft galore. It's filmmaking like this that makes Francis the greatest of Ed Wood's disciples, because he took nothing from Wood except for his DIY aesthetic; Coleman Francis is an outsider artist whose passionate belief in his work informs every frame of it, while completely lacking the technical skill (and the money) to achieve even basic moviemaking competence. RED ZONE CUBA is his nihilistic masterpiece, and his three movies, made through little more than sheer willpower, are the glory of MST3K's sixth season (not that I'd want to do without ZOMBIE NIGHTMARE or THE CREEPING TERROR, though).
