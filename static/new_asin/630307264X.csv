7837937,3,630307264X,"I've always considered it very strange why Wayne's westerns of the 1930's are not given the same sort of revered status that other western stars like Hopalong Cassidy and Roy Rogers received. Sure they're B movies but so were the films by Cassidy and Rogers. They might not have been as good from a pure technical standpoint, but they weren't awful either.

This was released by Vitagraph pictures which quite frankly was a new one one me.  I cannot find anything from this company after 1933 so they obviously were not around very long.  But this is actually a pretty well plotted starring vehicle for Wayne as he stars as John Drury who sets out to track down a villian known as the Hawk with the aid of Henry Sims.  Well Sims turns out to be the Hawk himself and soon fraoms Drury for murder.  This film would mark the first time that Wayne rode ""Duke"" the devil horse.  A good little film although quite rough from a visual and sound standpoint.  Decent action.",1114041600,5,965,4.511494252873563
7837938,3,630307264X,"John Wayne's first starring ""B"" Western  and the first of a series of six made by Warner Bros. may be the best of his ""B"" Western output. Good direction and production make this one and the entire  series a good one. The studio dressed him like Ken Maynard and put him on a  horse similar to Tarzan, so they could use action footage from Maynard's  old films. ""Ride Him Cowboy,"" for instance is a remake of the  1926 ""The Unknown Cavalier.""",964224000,7,440,4.382716049382716
