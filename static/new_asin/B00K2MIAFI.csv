8655347,5,B00K2MIAFI,"I have seen this movie before and really liked it.  In fact I put a review of this movie on IMDb.  As to the quality of the DVD I would give it a 4 out of 5.  Sometimes in black and white movies of this age the whites come out too bright and the whole picture is washed out, at least in part.  On the DVD I received the whites were at times a little too dominant but fortunately not so bad and the quality was on the whole acceptable.",1419379200,2,434,3.7888888888888888
8655348,5,B00K2MIAFI,"This is the English version of an Austrian film featuring a very young Oscar Werner and Maria Schell. It spans two wars and follows a woman through time. Eileen Herlie who I had never had the pleasure of seeing perform was top rate. It's not a film for everyone, but if you are interested as I am about the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand and his wife, and the roots, absurd as they were, that triggered world war I, you might like it. It plays a little loose with the Mayerling incident, but who cares? A great movie for me.",1392508800,,529,4.353535353535354
