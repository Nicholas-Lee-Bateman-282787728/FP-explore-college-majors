3846250,4,B0024FADBA,"Will the real John Carpenter step forward?  Is he the diabolical, masterful horror trailblazer who made Halloween and The Fog, or the sardonic, self-aware b-movie cheese-slinger who made Escape From L.A., Ghosts of Mars, and Body Bags?  What makes this collection so good is that it not only represents some of his biggest and best, but you can almost see the transition take place.  Carpenter is in top form with The Thing, a gripping, atmospheric feat of pure horror.  Prince of Darkness is somewhat of an experimental film, with little in the way of special effects, a relaxed and naturalistic pace, and perhaps even heavier on the atmosphere, complete with a strange, somewhat elliptical tale.  While it has its moments, Village of the Damned seems to be a misstep, and while Carpenter seems to handle this movie with a straight face, the subject matter is ultimately too meager and silly to make it a worthwhile watch.  Thankfully, Carpenter remedies this disjunction with They Live, helming a far out, 50s pulp era story and giving it both the seriousness it needs for us to connect with it while also ensuring hammy performances and exaggerated visuals as a counterpoint.

The four movies are collected on two DVDs, and thankfully, they're one-sided discs with artwork instead of those abominable flippers.  We get The Thing and Prince of Darkness on the first disc, with They Live and Village of the Damned on the second.  All four movies are in Widescreen, but that's all you get here.  There are no special features of any kind, not even any trailers.  In fact, there aren't even chapter selection options on the menu screens, so if you want to get to a certain point in the movies, you have to play them from the beginning and then skip chapters from there.

Thankfully, the packaging makes up for the threadbare content.  This four movie set is contained in a standard size, clear 2-DVD case with 2-sided artwork, although the inner artwork is pretty plain.  This is topped with a slipcover that has the same cover art but highlighted with iridescent ink that lends some beauty to the horrible images imposed there.

So, is this set worth it?  Chances are, if you're a fan of the man, you already own most of these, and the lack of any special features really degrades the value of this set.  But, if your Carpenter collection consists of The Thing and Halloween, this inexpensive, compact, varied array of movies housed in a handsome package is too good to pass up.

Thanks for reading.",1253750400,77,2499,4.785547785547785
3846251,4,B0024FADBA,"For this to be the ultimate JOHN CARPENTER HORROR COLLECTION, you'd have to replace the insipid VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED with the underrated IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS.  The other three flicks in this worthy set are sterling examples of CARPENTER's work.
THE THING rocks.  A great, slimy alien infestation nightmare of truly eerie proportions with CARPENTER fav KURT RUSSELL taking a flamethrower to his infected bunkmates with gusto.  An excellent movie and an even better horror movie.
The ten minute wrestling brawl between KEITH DAVID and RODDY PIPER is just the cherry on top of the THEY LIVE sundae.  A superb paranoia sci-fi action flick that has earned its cult status and then some.  Not really a horror movie, but great none the less.
PRINCE OF DARKNESS birngs some interesting ideas to the mix; Jesus was an alien, the devil's kid is living in a massive jar of green Gatorade in the basement of an old church, and ALICE COOPER's possesed bum feasting on maggots, to name a few.  A creepy movie with lots of chills and some good laughs.
The selections are all from the UNIVERSAL vault so no wonder VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED made the cut (MOUTH OF MADNESS is WARNER BROS.).  Not bad for a collector's set, but CARPENTER really deserves a set of all his films on DVD like the KUBRICK one.  That would make a prime collective of great DVD's.",1065744000,18,1338,4.639830508474576

3846323,5,B0024FADBA,"My review is biased because I bought this item for $5 at a local FYE. For that price, it gets 5 stars. Otherwise, I would give it 4 for two reasons.

First, Village Of The Damned is not as good as the other three movies. I saw this movie in the theaters when it first came out in the mid-90's. I must have been the only person in the theatre and by the end of the movie I understood why. Despite some big-name actors such as Chris Reeve, Linda Koszlowski, Mark Hamill and Kirstie Alley, and the assistance of KNB for gross-out make-up and ILM for some spooky visual effects, everyone including Carpenter seems bland and uninvolved. There is a very intriguing motif of self-mutilation that runs throughout the movie, but it's never really developed. Viewers are left to guess at Carpenter's meaning. Easily it's the worst movie in the pack.

The other movies are worth your time and money. The Thing is a classic. Next in order of merit is They Live. There's nothing scary about it, but it features clever visual references to B&W sci-fi movies from the 50's. Roddy Piper is no Kurt Russell, but he gets by here. Finally, Prince of Darkness comes third. Carpenter's material is more derivative than usual here--the British Dr. Quatermass movies--and you might find yourself laughing because it's all so bad. Fun bad, but bad nonetheless. I will say Carpenter puts a lot of energy into his Grade-B material. Most effective are the shots of all the grad students setting up in different areas all at the same time. That's a tricky thing to get right.

Picture quality is good but never great. The DVD with Village and They Live makes a slight buzzing noise in my player but the noise stops once the movie starts.

If you can find this 4-pack for 10 bucks or less, grab it!",1466035200,,1769,4.553459119496855

3846328,5,B0024FADBA,"This is a collection of four films. The best by far is ""The Thing"" with Kurt Russell. But two lesser known films are really excellent. ""They Live"" with surprisingly good actor ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper is a creepy allegory about a surveillance state and waking up to soft tyranny. The best lines are ""put the glasses on"" and ""I'm all out of bubblegum"". Funny and yet profound, it is a creepy film with modern resonance relevant today. The next gem is ""Prince of Darkness"", about the return of the antichrist. If you buy into the premise, you'll enjoy the film. Suspenseful and dark, the film features a cameo of Alice Cooper. The last film is a remake of ""Village of the Damned"". I saw the original and it is better. This newer version has Superman Christopher Reeve and Kirsty Alley. It's an ok film, but definitely the runt of this litter.",1456444800,,835,4.573333333333333

3846399,5,B0024FADBA,"This set is a great introduction to John Carpenter's work, and a great value in general. The Thing and They Live are basically mandatory viewing for horror and science fiction enthusiasts, and Prince of Darkness and Village of the Damned (while certainly not perfect films by any means) are certainly interesting examples of Carpenter's style of film making, and certainly worth watching.
Also, thank you so much for the movies being on single sided DVDs! I HATE double sided DVDs, they get scratched up easier, it's often difficult to identify which side is which, and they're just a pain to handle in general. This collection contains two single sided disks with two movies per disk, both of which are clearly labeled, perfect!
I presume they're able to fit two movies per disk due to this collection's lack of special features, however as someone who's never cared about DVD special features, and probably never will, this is not a big drawback for me.

3846465,3,B0024FADBA,"The 4 films (2-discs) included in this collection are very good (especially The Thing and They Live). All of them are science fiction/horror films with great casting, special effects, creative ideas and a wonderful score. This is the only John Carpenter collection on DVD or Blu-ray so it would be nice to see a Blu-ray collection with more of his films. All four movies are in widescreen but there are no special features (not even trailers).

The Master of Fear collection works as a value pack because the price is right. Buy this set if you want The Thing and Village of the Damned otherwise check out the Blu-ray versions instead. Prince of Darkness and They Live got deluxe Blu-ray releases but The Thing BD was disappointing. Village of the Damned is stuck on DVD. Overall, I rate the films 4.5 stars and this DVD collection 3 stars. If they released this collection on Blu-ray with more films and 6 hours of deluxe content it would be worth additional stars. Fans of Carpenter should check out his other Blu-ray releases including Body Bags (reviewed below).

This movie's anthology format reminds me of Creepshow. You get 3 audio commentaries and exclusive content in this release. My favorite segment was The Gas Station. Robert Carradine (The Player) and David Naughton (Witchboard II) pump-up for high-octane horror when a satanic serial killer stalks ""The Gas Station."" Stacy Keach (False Identity), Deborah Harry (Videodrome) and rock superstar Sheena Eston wig-out in the hair-raising tale of tonsorial terror, ""Hair."" And special guest director Tobe Hooper (Poltergeist) takes the reins when Mark Hamill (Star Wars) and Twiggy (The Boyfriend) set their sights on the supernatural and stare Evil right in ""The Eye."" So zip yourself up tight and chill out with host John Carpenter in the shock-around-the-clock scarefest that will keep you coming back for morgue! This film features many great horror directors. John Carpenter director of Halloween (1978) plays ""The Coroner"" and introduces each segment as well as directs two of the stories, ""The Gas Station"" and ""Hair"", Tobe Hooper director of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) plays ""Morgue Worker # 2"" and directs the last segment, ""The Eye"", Wes Craven director of A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) plays ""Pasty-Faced Man"" at the gas station, and Sam Raimi director of The Evil Dead (1981) plays ""Dead Bill"".

3846466,4,B0024FADBA,"The Thing is a remake of a now classic minor film first made with Jim Arness as The Thing from Outer Space. Less interesting than the original because of omission of the debate between scientific investigation and need to suppress possible evil, it has a more contemporary look and  will keep you interested to the end.
Prince of Darkness is also circumscribed in its setting. The Thing was set in a camp in Antarctica,  Prince in an abandoned church. Modest horror but high death list. Can't live up to what its lofty goal-to save mankind from evil- suggests, but will probably hold you to the end.
They Live, while having the same goal, saving mankind, has more of a bang 'em up and shoot 'em down quality, and is generally lighter in tenor than the other three films.  A sort of thoughtless, rather good-natured violence, which resembles hundreds of Westerns and Growing up in a tough Neighborhood type of film.
Village of the Damned is one of those films one is expected to have seen. If you haven't  done so. this is a relatively inexpensive way of doing so, with additional entertainment from the three other works.",1372809600,,1121,4.675126903553299
3846467,4,B0024FADBA,"I bought this mainlyf or ""They Love"". The other three were excellent extra's.
Some early and more mature work by him. A great contrast of his work.",1361232000,,147,4.481481481481482
3846468,5,B0024FADBA,I was very pleased with my purchase of this dvd. Its a great collection of his best movies. I highly recommend buying this item.,1359072000,,128,4.375
3846469,4,B0024FADBA,"Pretty cheap selection of B movie flare by a great film maker.  With the exception of The Thing, these film's are not among Carpenter's best, and generally represent a string of low budget films he did at Universal.  There are no special features and there are two films on each disc which is one sided.  I have since bought the Thing on Blu Ray for picture quality and features, but the rest I am content with a simple DVD version, though They Live is coming to Blu Ray soon.  Village of the Damned and Prince of Darkness are among his worse films but I still get a kick out of them.  I'm glad this was an option to obtain these films for a cheap price and glad to have the Thing on DVD to travel with so it plays on my laptop.",1352937600,,728,4.098591549295775
3846470,5,B0024FADBA,"Prince of Darkness: Alice Cooper as a zombie bum! This is more surrealistic than literal; there is some sort of evil godforce in a glass tube beneath an old Catholic church that turns a group of college ghost hunter types into zombies; Donald Pleasance plays a jittery priest, and as always is a joy to watch. An eerie little horror flick with gruesomely fun music.

They Live: Don't trust the media because they're aliens! Yeah, not a surprise there. Roddy Piper is our delirious hero with his special glasses that let you see the disguised aliens as they truly are and reveal subliminal meesages peppered throughout society to stay subservient to the aliens. Wish we had some of those glasses, especially when watching today's mass media spin their Wonderland news. The music here is a bit jaunty but catchy.

Village of the Damned: Christopher Reeve and Mark Hamill star in this nifty remake of the 1960's classic about a town that collapses into unconsciousness and nine months later all the women give birth to blonde-headed, telekinetic terrors that were possible inspiration for Charlie in Firestarter. I think it's the last movie before my favorite Superman had his spine injury that left him paralyzed for the last five or six years of his life. The music here is slow and lethargic, the worst of all four films.

The Thing: Kurt Russell starred in five Carpenter films (Elvis (1979), Escape from New York (1981), The Thing (1982), Big Trouble in Little China (1986)and Escape from L.A. (1996)) and owns this flick; not as much of a remake of the 1951 classic as it is a sequel (just as the recent prequel isn't a remake; watch them in order, The Thing from Another World, The Thing (2010) and The Thing (1982) and hope that an actually sequel gets made); a shapeshifting, flesh-consumming alien horror counts its coup on a scientific exploration team in Antarctica. As a hormone-driven teen in 1982 I loved it and hadn't even noticed that there were no females in the movie at all. Incredible music that I'm hearing in my head riii-ght now.

All four movies ARE John Carpenter and all four have pessimistic endings, but if you're a Carpenter fan then you already know that, don't you?",1351296000,14,2194,4.781002638522428
3846471,4,B0024FADBA,"I bought this 4-pack mostly to watch ""They Live,"" a classic guy movie that I remembered from years before. It turns about memories were better than reality, ""They Live"" was kind of hacky. The pleasant surprise of the set was ""Village of the Damned,"" which I remembered as hacky but everyone in my household actually loved it on the DVD. If you haven't seen that film it is definitely worth watching.",1348099200,,399,4.633802816901408
3846472,5,B0024FADBA,"Yes , each film has English subtitles . Now , if you are deaf or hard of hearing or just like to read the script dialog while you watch (like me) , you have that ability to do so here . Perhaps you have to keep the volume low ? Besides , if you are a TRUE horror fan , how many Anchor Bay or other film distribution companies have made you pay through-the-nose for pictures , but have failed to provide subtitles or encode closed captions ? I won't extol the various virtues of these films (all presented in their proper aspect ratios) , as that's subjective . Read um and don't weep though . Less than 4 dollars a film ? Wow . Great-value-fun .",1341532800,12,645,4.086614173228346
3846473,5,B0024FADBA,"Even if you only like one of these movies, this still isn't a bad deal since I've seen The Thing alone often sold for a similar price. However, liking all four of these films is a great deal and a must for any horror fan. They Live and The Thing are both classic and underrated films, I strongly recommend watching both of these because they are the two best in the collection. The other two films aren't bad but not up to the level of my two favorites in the collection in my opinion.",1331856000,,485,4.170212765957447

3846475,5,B0024FADBA,"As the DVD format slowly meanders it's way toward the tar-pits of extinction, I've been consolidating my collection w/ these multi-packs. JOHN CARPENTER: MASTER OF FEAR is a worthwhile addition. THE THING is a gooey, crawly masterpiece, as good, if not better than the original. PRINCE OF DARKNESS is a grab-bag of possession, Satan, homeless zombies (led by Alice Cooper!), and physics! THEY LIVE is an alien invasion tale w/ those fantastic, special sunglasses! VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED is the weakest of the bunch, giving us a rather cheeezy 90s-take on the 60s classic. Worth owning for the Carpenter nut (like me)...",1322956800,,618,5.068627450980392
3846476,5,B0024FADBA,"This set is fantastic to get out if you want to experience the chill that older movies can send down your spine without the use of all the special effects that are currently used today. The best of the set, in my opinion, was Village of the Damned. Let's face it... any film about scary, evil children is flat out freaky. I am crossing my fingers for a remake of this movie.",1313020800,5,374,4.208333333333333
3846477,5,B0024FADBA,"If you want a great sampling of John Carpenter at his best,get these.

Let me be clear I love John Carpenter's movies. Nothing else feels like his gritty mix of mild gore,cheese and sense of impending doom. Everything from the score to the camerawork contributes to this,but it is the story that keeps me coming back. I really think these are not true horror flics,but there is not really a genre to squeeze them into,they dabble in sci-fi,horror,action but don't really fit into any single frame. In essence they are Carpenter,and you really can't say a nicer thing!",1309737600,2,567,4.785714285714286

3846479,4,B0024FADBA,"I consider The Thing & Prince of Darkness masterpeices & cult classics. The other 2 movies on this dvd are good, but don't rise to the level of the before mentioned titles.

3846481,4,B0024FADBA,"This contains four of John Carpenter's films, all which I enjoyed watching. The Thing is simply an amazing movie, and even today I'm impressed by the effects used. I also happen to love Prince of Darkness, and it is one of my favorite horror flicks. Village of the Damned is probably my least favorite out of this collection, though it's still somewhat entertaining. And who can forget They Live? The movie has some of the most memorable lines that you'll find yourself quoting again and again, despite the poor acting and the mullet.",1256256000,6,534,4.752688172043011

8350573,4,B0024FADBA,"Though he has directed a number of non-horror films, John Carpenter is never going to shake the label of ""horror director."" Perhaps he doesn't want to. Horror is the well he keeps returning to over and over again throughout his career, and never mind the excursions he's taken into romance, comedy or dystopian sci-fi. The ""Master of Fear"" collection, while lacking two of his most famous horror films, HALLOWEEN and THE FOG, does a pretty effective job of showcasing Carpenter in all senses -- good, bad and ugly. It's a neat little collection that is well worth your time and money.

Just to get this out of the way, there are no special features on these two discs, nor are there any type of ""extras."" For the price, that would be unreasonable to expect. The good news is that the picture quality, which I was a little worried about, is excellent and does a fine job of demonstrating Carpenter's eye for visual beauty. All films are presented in widescreen format, too, so you lose nothing of the cinematic experience via the atrocity known as pan-and-scan.

Now, to the movies themselves:

THE THING (1982) - Arguably one of the greatest horror movies of all time, THE THING is John Carpenter's remake of the 1951 classic sci-fi/horror film, and it is a rare case of the remake being superior to the original. Set in a lonely Antarctic research station, it is the story of a group of scientists (and one ornery helicopter pilot, played by Kurt Russel), who discover an alien life-form buried in the ice, and -- unfortunately for them -- allow it to thaw. A masterpiece of mystery, mounting unease, paranoia and ultimately, fear, THE THING is Carpenter at his very best: casting, writing, production design and music all unite to create an atmosphere of genuine horror -- ""horror"" meaning literally ""the anticipation of a terrifying outcome.""

PRINCE OF DARKNESS (1987) - This is the story of a priest (Donald Pleasance) who discovers that a run-down church in downtown L.A. is the home of an embryonic, all-powerful ""anti-God"" whose time to enter our universe has finally arrived. The priest arranges for a group of doctoral candidates from a local university to come and study the ""embryo,"" and no sooner have they arrived than they are trapped in the church by a group of homeless people under its demonic influence: meanwhile, the ""egg"" is hatching, about to give birth to the Antichrist. Sluggish and cerebral, PRINCE OF DARKNESS is not a scary film, nor is it particularly well cast -- Jameson Parker, who was so charismatic on SIMON & SIMON in the 80s, is a bit inert as the hero. What's more, the writing is clunky and expository and there is a feeling of silliness at many key moments which undermine the mood. But for all that, it's actually worth watching, if only because it is truly a ""thinking man's"" horror movie, and also contains more than a few glints of Carpenter's old moviemaking charm.

THEY LIVE (1988) - Like many of Carpenter's movies, including THE THING, this one has grown in reputation over time. When I originally saw it in the theater in high school, I spent most of my time laughing at the jokes and the satisfying outbursts of violence: it wasn't until many years later that the brutality of the social commentary really began to resonate with me. A paranoiac's fantasy, THEY LIVE is about a nameless drifter (Roddy Piper) who stumbles upon a staggering secret: mankind has been infiltrated, and is being corrupted and controlled, by a race of greedy, ghoul-like aliens whose true nature can only be seen through lenses of specially-manufactured sunglasses. Not one to take these things lying down, Piper's character ""Nada"" goes on an anti-alien rampage which culminates in him trying to destroy the satellite dish which allows the aliens to hide in plain sight. More action-comedy than horror, this is a scathingly anti-materialist film, which the actor Peter Jason (Gilbert) described to me as ""a primal scream of rage against the Reagan era.""

VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED (1995) - Carpenter supposedly said to an interviewer that he made this movie out of a contractual obligation to the studio, and indeed, it lacks the passion he brings to even his worst films. Having said that, it is by no means his worst film: it's actually quite entertaining, if one just swallows it whole and doesn't ask too many questions. VILLAGE is a strange tale about a small NorCal town which literally falls asleep one day, only to wake up and discover that ten of the women have become mysteriously pregnant while unconscious. All but one of the babies are born live, and quickly begin to manifest telekenetic powers, which they use violently when threatened, thwarted, or just plain bored. The town doctor (Christopher Reeve) and a chain-smoking government scientist (Kirstie Alley) struggle to deal with the creepy, menacing children while trying to unravel the mystery behind their birth, leading to an extremely violent climax. Like DARKNESS, this film is decidedly unscary, but it is interesting and has that strange charm I referred to earlier, that Carpenter is often able to achieve even when he achieves nothing else.

As I said, this is not really a collection of Carpenter's best horror -- that would have to include HALLOWEEN, of course, and probably THE FOG as well -- but it is a very watchable group of movies that tells you a lot about Carpenter's fancy for sacrificial themes, social commentary, jump scares, and off-the-wall casting. The price is incredibly modest and you could do worse than fire ""Master of Fear"" up on Halloween -- after you watch HALLOWEEN, that is!",1511395200,,5603,4.860732984293194

8350575,3,B0024FADBA,"The Thing
Yep we are confronted by a dog-splitting being from the great beyond. Being isolated we must evaluate track and kill this most obviously menacing ""Thing"". But what, who, and where is it?

In an attempt at graphic surprises we have sacrificed character and mood of the book (""Who Goes There"" by John W. Campbell Jr.), and the original movie (""The Thing From Another World.}"". Ah you say what if you do not compare? Still it is a sticky blob story that has no personality of its own.

This movie is fun to watch and say, ""don't look there"" but it is far from extraordinary.

They Live
Turns out that some economic entrepreneurs are in the process of exploiting people. (All people. O.K. the world.) They seem to have a different physical appearance than you or I and for the sake of keeping the exploration covert, have electronically masked themselves to appear normal.

All is going well until the presents of this drifter come to LA looking for work. He finds himself in an unbelievable situation. Evidently malcontents have devised a way to spot these interlopers and are threatening exposure. He is skeptical at first then after a bout of fisticuffs will be forced to see the truth. Subsequently he becomes the most radical in a plot to blowup the masking devise and exposes this cabal to the world. Will he succeed or are they clever enough to catch him at the last moment? A more sinister thought is will anyone care?

In a world where you cannot tell the good buys from the bad without your glasses there is also a quasi love interest between the vigilante and a worker (Meg Foster) at a local TV studio.
-------------------------------
Village of the Damned
This movie, which holds it own, is a remake of the 1960 film classic, which in turn was based on the book ""The Midwich Cuckoos"" ISBN: 0899683878.

The small town of Midwich one-day falls inexplicably asleep. Many accidents occur due to the sudden narcolepsy, which is exaggerated in John carpenter style. The result is that several of the village females including a virgin are in a motherly way. They all have their bouncing white hair babies the same day and as with the cuckoo eggs, they are too in love to notice the little quirks about having to control or punish everyone. Compound this by other villages that fall to the same fate and you have an epidemic that threatens to wipe out the human race.

What action can be taken? Is it too late? If he/she were your child what would you do?",1503792000,,2512,4.710706150341686
