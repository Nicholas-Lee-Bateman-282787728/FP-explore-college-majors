3891087,5,B002ARZ0E2,"excellent movie, watch cold prey 1 and 2 together for a night of thrills in the cold norwegian snowlands. i find foreign horror movies to be amongst the best so these are a must.",1288569600,2,178,4.264705882352941
3891088,4,B002ARZ0E2,"I actually liked Cold Prey 2 better than it's predecessor.
In this sequel a lot of things that didn't make sense in the first came to light ,such as, The real origin of the killer. Specifying that he's not just some kid with a birth mark that gets left behind to die in the snow and gets pissed off.

 They go on to explain that he was was stillborn and then after 5 minutes his heart started beating. He also mutilated animals and exhibited psycho like behavior as a child.

This time around it's Halloween 2 meets Shredder because most takes place in a hospital where Jannicke the only survivor from the original is taken after she is found in the snow.
This movie is very (Girls Kick A**)times 2.

The kills were pretty good and inventive .They say it's a bootleg and I'm inclined to agree because there are no special features or any way to fix the audio or subtitles,

You have to watch it in Norwegian with English subtitles ,that is already set for you.
Anyway ,that's cool because it didn't take anything away from the movie in my opinion.
seeing as there is no American release date.",1275696000,,1092,4.412935323383085
3891089,5,B002ARZ0E2,"Wow Wow Wow is all i have to say!  this movie blew me away. I watched part 1 on DVD which is currently out at your local BlockBuster. It was a better than average slasher film with some likable characters. Some nice scenery and gore. It was, i would give it a 3 1/2 stars... you really don't need to watch Part 1 to watch Part 2. All you need to know is a bunch of kids go snow boarding (i know it sounds boring) and they get picked off one by one by a mysterious killer wearing an AWESOME SCARY WINTER PARKA so you never see the killers face (which is great)... anyhow, Part 2 is so well directed and the tension builds up quickly. The main survivor of Part 1 is now in a hospital, that is pretty secluded mind ya (which we all love to hear right??) and Its sort of like Halloween 2 where she is stuck there.  I won't tell you anything else but when the cops return to the hospital/morgue with the bodies of all her friends they also return someone or something that NOBODY EXPECTED!!!  WATCH IT. I DOUBT ANYONE WILL TRASH THIS MOVIE... IT'S very very enjoyable and and any slasher fan will LOVE THIS.  PS i have this on DVD and NOT BOOTLEG. its around. just keep searching for it.. and you'll find it!",1257206400,7,1203,4.150214592274678
3891090,5,B002ARZ0E2,"Do not pay attention to the negative post.  They obviously didn't purchase this item and didn't witness its magnificence, as I did.  This is exactly as described, in excellent condition (plus super fast shipping!).  Great movie!",1249257600,7,228,5.277777777777778
3891091,5,B002ARZ0E2,"A truly dramatic and well thought out thriller. Definitely a must-see. Don't any attention to the reviewer who says this is a poor quality ""bootleg"". Its not. This is the official singapore release that is all-region NTSC and will play in the USA. It is anamorphic widescreen and comes well packaged in a nice glossy slipcase. Whether or not you saw the first installment, this is a good movie, and a good DVD.",1246665600,13,410,4.63013698630137

3891101,4,B002ARZ0E2,"Plot - IMDB
Jannicke wakes up in the hospital. All of her friends are dead. As she walks through the dark corridors, she thinks she is left alone. But the nightmare isn't over yet.

Review - 4/5
Much more intense, more action, and an all around better film than the first one. Almost reminds me of the original Halloween II when Michael Myers comes to the hospital to try and kill Laurie Strode. Just like that film, it mostly takes place inside a hospital. The bad guy here is even more menacing than he was in the first one, and the survivor Jannicke is also back. If you're a fan of the first one definitely pick this one up.",1399766400,,628,4.277310924369748
3891102,5,B002ARZ0E2,This is one of the few horrors that doesn't over do it with gore and guts. The killer isn't supernatural and it sticks to basics that make horrors good from the get go. I have watched at least 4 times already.,1384905600,,209,4.121951219512195
3891103,5,B002ARZ0E2,"One oh the best foreign horror movies I have ever seen.  Cold Play l was great too.  It's one of those movies that keep you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end,  Great job to the directors, film crew, and the actors!!!",1370649600,2,229,4.044444444444444
3891104,4,B002ARZ0E2,"Jannicke (Ingrid Bols Berdal) survives Cold Prey to return to the sequel as does our killer (Robert Follin). Jannicke is located on a highway. The bodies of her friends are brought to the hospital which doubles as a morgue. Along with her friends, is the killer, a Jason kind of guy who just won't die.

If you like the Friday the 13th type of slasher and don't mind the subtitles, it is a fairly decent film. The Norwegians don't speak much or fast. I found the subtitles easy to follow. The obligatory nude shower scene just gave us a ""side butt"" view. The major scare factor was designed to make us jump by sudden screen movements. It works as a slasher that holds your attention.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, no sex or nudity per se. 3 1/2 stars",1369526400,,745,4.430656934306569
3891105,5,B002ARZ0E2,"This movie starts with the ending of the original movie, COLD PREY, and never stops. It is very creepy, very atmospheric, and the acting team is spot-on! If you liked Cold Prey, you will love this one! If you want to watch a really good horror movie, I strongly recommend this one!",1367884800,4,281,4.423076923076923
3891106,4,B002ARZ0E2,"There's just something about the country of Norway that lends itself to being the perfect location for a horror film. Maybe it's the image most people have of it being desolate, cold, dark, and isolated. It might also have something to do with the fact that 90 percent of the music we hear coming out of the country is death or black metal. ""Cold Prey II"" definitely doesn't help give movie audiences an alternate view of what to expect if you plan a ski trip to that part of the world.

After surviving a horrific killing spree at an abandoned ski lodge, a college girl named Jannicke (Ingrid Bols Berdal) is taken to a remote hospital for treatment. She tells her story to the local police who decide to investigate her claims. They return hours later with the bodies of her four friends and the mountain man responsible for the massacre. Unfortunately, the monstrous murderer isn't dead and begins slaughtering the patients, nurses, and doctors in his mission to finish what he started with Jannicke.

""Cold Prey II"" is the perfect example of a modern slasher film done right. Although it brings nothing new to the table, it manages to keep up a level of suspense and delivers some legitimate jump scares at the same time.

I couldn't shake the feeling that director Mats Stenberg and writer Thomas Moldestad were doing their own version of ""Halloween II"" and ""Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter"" for a Norwegian audience. Like those classic 1980s films, much of the action takes place in a hospital. The vision of the giant killer in ""Cold Prey II"" standing at the end of a corridor with the lights blinking reminded me of the same type of scenes in the sequels to John Carpenter and Sean S. Cunningham's iconic originals.

As far as special features are concerned, the DVD of ""Cold Prey II"" contains several deleted scenes and a trailer for the film. It would have been interesting to see a ""Making of"" featurette with clips of the production and interviews with the cast and crew.

""Cold Prey II"" is a welcome addition to the slasher genre. It's not doing anything new, but continues passing the torch to a new generation of horror fans and filmmakers. It will give viewers a sense of hope we don't get much anymore when it comes to these types of movies.",1363564800,4,2261,4.6425
3891107,5,B002ARZ0E2,"Just as good as the original with a bigger bodycount and even more suspense. A must own for any slasher fan.

The DVD is Region 0 (not Region 3) and is worth the money.",1299974400,,168,3.9411764705882355
8360124,4,B002ARZ0E2,"Better than the first one!  I had mixed feelings after the first one. It took too long to get going leaving our characters to do some stupid things just to move the plot a long and fill time, like not checking on their friend that they hadn't seen all night and all morning, one even said ""maybe i should check on her""... yeah you probably should! They also probably should have noticed that puddle of blood on the stairs. My main issues were actually with ""final girl"" when she had been caring for her badly hurt friend the entire movie and then she just abandons him towards the end knowing he'll probably die.  It made it hard for me to root for her after that... This movie was a little bit better, it's more fast paced and reminded me a lot of Halloween 2. Our killer is a little more inhuman in this one, and I'm glad they didn't take his face cover this time! The hospital was creepy but not as creepy as the ski lodge. I liked that there were two women working together- you don't see a lot of that in slashers!",1518134400,,1019,4.220512820512821

8360127,5,B002ARZ0E2,"I really liked the first Cold Prey, and had put off seeing the sequel until recently. I really wish I would have picked this up when it came out. Loved the Halloween 2 style sequel immediately following the events of the first Cold Prey, and set in empty hospital. Just all around a great tense watch, and a definite recommend.",1503360000,,327,4.466666666666667
8360128,5,B002ARZ0E2,I loved it. The only thing is it's some other language but still has English subtitles. So it was ok,1499126400,,100,4.05
8360129,4,B002ARZ0E2,"Well, we have here the very rare sequel to a movie that i did like with a sequel that I did like too. I will have to admit though that this reminded me very much of Halloween part 2 and that's okay because there were enough differences to not make me think....ripoff. It had enough to stand by itself. I did like the cast and even though we got the usual story of the cops not believing a word of her story and think that she killed all of her friends from the first film and she has to save the day once again with an assist from another survivor. Take my word for it, if you liked or even loved the first Cold Prey, you will certainly like or love this one too.",1483488000,,663,3.955223880597015
8360130,3,B002ARZ0E2,"I haven't seen the first Cold Prey movie but I watched Cold Prey 2 and thought it was pretty decent. Ingrid Bolso Berdal was excellent as Jannicke and the whole Mountain Man thing was pretty cool. I thought he was a bit more like Jason Voorhees in that he's indestructible like a spirit but he was bleeding heavily from the pick axe and then was supposedly killed.

 All up not a bad movie at all.

 Interestingly Cold Prey 2 had the most successful opening weekend in Norwegian film history.",1463702400,,492,4.49438202247191
8360131,4,B002ARZ0E2,"Pretty great for a remake of the BEST slasher flick made since the 70's! I like how it starts at the end of the original ""Fritt Vilt"" or ""Cold Prey"" as it translates and the progression of Jannicke from victim to hunter... Unfortunately, as with any 2nd installment, it it not as good as the original, but still worth the watch!",1445990400,,328,4.39344262295082
8360132,4,B002ARZ0E2,"I loved this sequel, it reminded me of Halloween 2, which was great too.  Strong women!!  The first movie Cold Prey was so great i knew i would like the sequel.  I wasn't disappointed.  The lead actress was really good, now i try to watch her movies.",1435276800,,250,4.25531914893617
8360133,4,B002ARZ0E2,"This sequel takes place immediately after the first film.  Jannicke (Ingrid Bolso Berdal) is rescued and taken to hospital.  Unfortunately, it is a place with few doctors and nurses and even fewer patients.  All five of the bodies are also brought in and placed in the morgue.  The police are entirely unsympathetic to Jannicke's ordeal.  She's soon bound to her bed after she witnesses the hospital staff attempting to revive the killer and understandably freaks out.  Apparently, they're all idiots and unable to understand the concept of danger and death at the hands of an unrelenting killer.  Live and learn, die and lose the importance of the lesson altogether.  Yes, he goes on another killing spree doing just what you would expect from this type of movie.  Thank goodness.

I quite liked the expectedness of it, following so rigidly the rules of slasher flicks.  I found it very satisfactory but nothing original.  I counted on it sticking to the formula and wasn't disappointed with the results.  Loved the ending.

(Apparently, there is a Cold Prey 3.  It is a prequel to the first film, dealing with the missing boy and some campers in the national park near Jotunheimen.)",1429574400,,1184,4.909090909090909
