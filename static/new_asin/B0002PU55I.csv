8030232,1,B0002PU55I,"Don't be fooled by the mature photo of Tommy Lee Jones on the cover art; this film is 30+ years old; a young Tommy Lee plays a bitter Amer. Indian who lives in a slum apartment while plotting to destroy a bridge; ""Eliza"" moves into the same building while searching for a true love.  Despite the synopsis, this movie fails to deliver anything coherently resembling a storyline in all of its excruciating 2 hours.

It suffers from bad writing, bad directing and bad editing; the sound quality is equally miserable, although this doesn't matter much as the dialogue is often nonsensical and amaturish. The film inflicts frequent closeups of leering, laughing, overly made up faces or people prancing in and out of frames in a nonsensical manner, all of which add NOTHING to the story. Not even Jones can save this Titanic.

If you're looking for early Tommy Lee, try ""Jackson County Jail"" (aka The Innocent Victim), ""The Eyes of Laura Mars"" or ""Back Roads"".  His talent can shine through in these, and he doesn't have to battle a constant backdrop of ridiculous claptrap masquerading as an ""art"" film.",1195948800,,1099,4.798941798941799
8030233,3,B0002PU55I,"This is a curio from the annals of Canadian film-making. Almost no plot, apart from Eliza's search for her true love according to her horoscope. Hmmmmm.

Tommy Lee is as you might expect as something of a drifter, for whom Eliza (Elizabeth Moorman) falls. Fans of the Band (like myself) will search out this film for a sighting of Richard Manuel as Richard the 'Composer'. Well, we don't see him compose - unfortunately, he doesn't sing or play piano either. It's kindest to say that as an actor, he made a terrific singer. Probably fair to say that Manuel was playing himself, just dressed smarter. Handsome and smilingly, he offers Eliza wine in his Rolls Royce and takes her to his Astrology Club.

Wierd people. Wierd film. Patience is required. Audio pretty poor.",1154908800,,768,4.7669172932330826
8030234,3,B0002PU55I,"Somewhat of a period piece, using experimental techniques that seem both dated and creative. The narrative is loose, the imagery is dreamlike and some of the shots are amazingly beautiful. The story line is fragmented concerning a young woman's search for love and her destiny using aspects of her astological chart. A frustrating film that i mulled over like a puzzling dream, Tommy Lee Jones appears as a construction worker with a mind for revolution and a heart full of unrequited love.

This movie made me realize how tame Hollywood pictures are circa 2005. A good movie to watch with some film geek friends late at night and mull over mythologies of the world and the elasticity of reality. Also check the late Richard Manuel of the Band in his role as a rich composer; he cuts a rakish form.",1135555200,2,798,4.7
