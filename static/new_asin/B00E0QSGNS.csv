5883073,5,B00E0QSGNS,"We love this series of Sicilian murder mysteries! The plots are excellent. There is intrigue,  humor, culture,  and insight into the daily lives of a very interesting people.  We can't wait for the next release!",1383868800,3,211,4.9714285714285715
5883074,5,B00E0QSGNS,The casting in these series is excellent. If you are a follower of the books you can appreciate how the cast brings the characters to life.,1383004800,,139,4.384615384615385
5883075,5,B00E0QSGNS,"another great DVD  love them all  and am slowly catching on to the Sicilian dialect.
I will be sorry when the last one is written",1382832000,,129,4.12
5883076,5,B00E0QSGNS,"Best detective series and you can learn Italian as well, although it is the Sicilian Italian! Spicier!!  With this one and the 25-26 I complete the series!",1382486400,,155,4.7407407407407405
5883077,5,B00E0QSGNS,"Montalbano is a series for serious detective fans. Each episode begins with two quite different mysteries. Montalbano prompts them to unravel themselves, sometimes with a little unorthodox detective work. Episodes also continue the stories of relations between the Sicilian policemen, their wives and friends and are set against a background of modern day Sicily, the Mafia and societal corruption. They are superb in every regard.",1381968000,,431,5.6461538461538465
5883078,3,B00E0QSGNS,I have watched all of this series.  These last two episodes are nearly the same story in both 23 and 24.  Both revolve around women seducing Montalbano.  It seems the author has given up producing a real story that intrigues and holds interest and is playing around with the attraction of the main Character.  Livia is no where to be seen.  The other characters are tiny parts.  Both these episodes are very disappointing.  Not worth buying frankly.  No where near the level of the other stories.,1380844800,10,496,4.686046511627907
5883079,5,B00E0QSGNS,It's our favorate series...Good acting...Good plots...Hope they keeping making more...Luca Zingaretti is an appealing character...The scenery is interesting and unusual,1380758400,,168,7.45
5883080,5,B00E0QSGNS,"It's a lot of fun watching this series, and helpful to hear the language spoken in a conversational way. If, as one actor said in an interview, they are speaking with a ""Sicilian accent"", I am not skilled enough in Italian yet to notice the distinction. They speak clearly, and I find it easy to follow.",1380672000,2,303,4.428571428571429
5883081,5,B00E0QSGNS,"Episodes 23-25 have just run on French TV dubbed in French. Sicily is still gorgeous, Mimi has a silly mustache, A different but tall, thin and blonde lady plays Livia, the interchanges with Catarello border on slapstick but the series remains completely delightful, although, to me, it doesn't work in French.  I've bought all the episodes so far and certainly will purchase these . . . .and be glad for the Italian with English subtitles.",1379203200,7,440,4.866666666666666
5883082,5,B00E0QSGNS,"I haven't received these subtitled episodes yet, but expect them by the end of September.  But, I have watched the unsubtitled episodes on YouTube, and own all of the previously released episodes.  This is the best detective series bar none, even those from Masterpiece Theatre and it is hard to top those.  Luca Zingaretti has captured all of the quirky features of Montalbano (from the Andrea Camilleri novels), and his cohorts against crime are perfectly cast.  The Italian/Sicilian is ""rapido"" so I like to check my understanding with the ""sottotitoli"" which are very well done and are translated beautifully.

I hope this is not the last of the Italian produced series, as Camilleri is still writing at 86 or so years!!!",1379116800,11,725,4.958677685950414

5883091,5,B00E0QSGNS,Wish Rai would put out more episodes of this detective series.,1404950400,,62,4.7272727272727275
5883092,3,B00E0QSGNS,"Episodes are great as usual, but quality of these dvds is very poor. It looks like these were copied very quickly to save time/money, and resolution is awful.",1404259200,,158,4.678571428571429
5883093,5,B00E0QSGNS,I feel so happy when I watch these episodes. wish I lived in Italy or Sicily and could watch them for free. It is my gift to myself. I do miss the original main actress who plays livia.,1399075200,,185,3.8947368421052633
5883094,5,B00E0QSGNS,"The Montalbano series presents a different point of view to ""policing"". The strong philosophical bent to the stories(like the books) makes them complex and thoughtful. Interactions between Catarella and Montalbano are an amusing contrast and create light moments in the arc of the story. Plus who minds looking at handsome Italian men, especially Luca Zingaretti?",1398988800,,363,5.618181818181818
5883095,5,B00E0QSGNS,"Every episode of this series delivers a complex, multi-leveled story that entertains from the first scene to the last. I've watched the entire Montalbano  series more than once, and I never tire of it. The stories are fast-paced, and the sub-titles are good, especially for those who are learning Italian language.",1396483200,,314,5.1568627450980395
5883096,5,B00E0QSGNS,"It's an exceptional series, this Detective Montalbano.  I'm even learning some Italian.  Francois has grown into a beautiful young man and is searching out his roots in Tunisia. Montalbano is as reckless as ever, and sly as a fox.  He has no problem lying and making up stories to get at the truth.  Fazio is super in his role as aide to Montalbano.  Kirk and Spock, Batman and Robin, Holmes and Watson, Montalbano and Fazio.  Dynamic duo teams.",1395532800,,445,4.641025641025641
5883097,5,B00E0QSGNS,"read the books, and the films are not disappointing.  Recommended for the background and local characters alone.  see them all.",1392595200,,127,5.3
5883098,5,B00E0QSGNS,"Great story telling, a must for Italian speakers. Sicilian dialect and great style, plus Montalbano is really cute and funny.",1390348800,,125,5.3
5883099,5,B00E0QSGNS,"This is an addictive series! The stories are well told and characters become part of your family. With humor and compassion, in addition to mystery and oftentimes murder, what's there not to like about this series?",1387497600,,214,4.972222222222222
5883100,5,B00E0QSGNS,Watching Detective Montalbano get the bad guys without all the high tech wizardry shown in the American CSI productions is refreshing. Casting for these movies is excellent. Serious stories mixed with the right touch of humor to make them very entertaining and easy to understand.,1387238400,,280,5.2444444444444445
5883101,5,B00E0QSGNS,Really different.  I don;t like detective stories but these are fun. I think we Americans don't pay attention to the rest of the world much.  Watching  Montalbano and his crew find the bad guy gives you insight into the European mind.,1386892800,3,234,4.658536585365853
5883102,5,B00E0QSGNS,This is a terrific series with actual stories rather than just car chases and violence.  Detective Montalbano is so cool.,1384041600,,121,5.05
8599882,5,B00E0QSGNS,Montalbano is my favorite detective!,1515024000,,36,6.4
8599883,5,B00E0QSGNS,Comissario Montalbano is a breath of fresh air.  I love to hear my native language spoken.,1501718400,,90,4.625

8599889,5,B00E0QSGNS,"The Sicily and stories of acclaimed writer Andrea Camilleri, plus an outstanding director, DP, cast, and crew, together for over 15 years, movie-length adventures, subtitles expertly done by the BBC... What's not to love? This DVD has the last two episodes of the original 24-episode series. Seems like there was less time and budget for later #'s 25 & 26, but everyone is still there. Actually best to start from the beginning -- #1, The Snack Thief -- so you can gradually get to know and savor this world of Commisario Montalbano and the people, places, food, and culture of his/Camilleri's beloved Sicily. Enjoy! -JM",1455926400,,620,4.914285714285715
