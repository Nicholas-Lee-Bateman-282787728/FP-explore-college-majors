6854653,4,B00Q5LAH2E,"This is a fun set of all the Boston Blackie movies all rolled into one set.  It comes in a nice sized CD sized case.  However, there are a few things that need to mentioned.  The quality of all of the movies is not great, The second film is very dark.  One movie actually had a TCM logo bug in the corner.  This set comes from a company called OneMedia, and for the most part the films are fine and most definitely fun to watch. An example of the changing times is the relationship between Blackie and The Runt. While in the 1940's they were just pals, but watching with 2015 eyes, example Blackie and the Runt share the same bedroom in their lavish apartment, not the same bed, but then in the 1940's man and wife didn't share the same bed.  But it does make you wander about their relationship.  But ignoring all of that, they are fun movies to watch and re-watch!",1423612800,4,866,4.2439024390243905

6854663,2,B00Q5LAH2E,"OK so I got this release hoping for the best. Well, this is a bootleg edition culled from home recordings off of TCM. Some titles have old VHS tapes as the source material. Quality is horrible, avoid until Columbia Tri-Star finishes putting out the collection.",1500854400,2,260,4.8
6854664,5,B00Q5LAH2E,"Pulp writer Jack Boyle's most famous creation was Boston Blackie, the former thief-turned-amateur-sleuth who, together with his sidekick The Runt, keeps one step ahead of the police when it comes to solving a crime - usually one for which he is wrongly accused of. The film rights to the character were bought by Columbia Pictures, who cast square-jawed tough guy Chester Morris as Blackie - a role for which the actor became closely associated with, starring in a total of fourteen films from 1941-1949.

The Boston Blackie series was strictly B-movie fare with each installment running either just over or under an hour, but all are consistently entertaining crime mysteries with a breezy mix of action, intrigue and humor. In addition, many classic era stars show up opposite Morris. Along with series regulars George E. Stone as The Runt and Richard Lane as the exasperated Inspector Farraday, other notable supporting players include Rochelle Hudson, Three Stooges heavy Kenneth McDonald, Ann Savage, Lloyd Corrigan, Steve Cochran and a young Lloyd Bridges who shows up as a bus driver. The films sport some decent directorial talent with the likes of Robert Florey and Edward Dmytryk, and even flirt with noirish shadings, particularly in the moody black and white cinematography which belies the fact that these were modest productions.

Onesmedia offers all fourteen Boston Blackie films in one nicely packaged set of seven discs with two films per disc in chronological order: MEET BOSTON BLACKIE (1941), CONFESSIONS OF BOSTON BLACKIE (1941), ALIAS BOSTON BLACKIE (1942), BOSTON BLACKIE GOES HOLLYWOOD (1942), AFTER MIDNIGHT WITH BOSTON BLACKIE (1943), THE CHANCE OF A LIFETIME (1943), ONE MYSTERIOUS NIGHT (1944), BOSTON BLACKIE BOOKED ON SUSPICION (1945), BOSTON BLACKIE'S RENDEZVOUS (1945), A CLOSE CALL FOR BOSTON BLACKIE (1946), THE PHANTOM THIEF (1946), BOSTON BLACKIE AND THE LAW (1946), TRAPPED BY BOSTON BLACKIE (1948), BOSTON BLACKIE'S CHINESE VENTURE (1949). The prints are complete and with great quality, certainly well worth the reasonable cost as this is the only edition that brings you the entire series in one fell swoop. Sony has released a few titles from decent transfers, but good luck waiting for the entire run. There are also some gawdawful bootlegs floating around out there. Onesmedia's Boston Blackie Film Collection rivals Sony's quality, so it turns out to be the better deal. There is even a bonus disc with two SAINT films starring George Sanders - THE SAINT TAKES OVER (1940) and THE SAINT IN PALM SPRINGS (1941).

You really can't beat this enjoyable collection for quality and price. Pick it up and run your very own Boston Blackie marathon.

My highest recommendation.",1500768000,8,2713,5.2298850574712645
6854665,5,B00Q5LAH2E,"Although these movies were made a long time ago, they are still well worth watching because of the humor in them, humor resulting from Boston Blackie outwitting the police who are portrayed as quite dumb. In the 1942 black and white film "" The Chance of a Life Time,"" for example, the former theif - 14 years ago - who became a crime fighter, wants the governor to parole about a dozen convicts who performed bad acts and served some time in prison. It is during world War II and these prisoners had skills that would help the war effort. The inspector of the police is against the idea. When the governor agrees with Blackie and releases the prisoners, the inspector looks for a way to show that Blackie is wrong. He gets a chance when one of the ex-convicts accidentally kills a man.",1498953600,,785,4.458333333333333

6854667,5,B00Q5LAH2E,"I love Chester Morris AND his Boston Blackie movies.  I think Morris is an underrated actor, nearly forgotten today, and was overlooked by MGM following his great performances in The Big House and The Divorcee (with Norma Shearer) in 1930.  They relegated him to B-movie status in the 1940s, but the films of his great Boston Blackie series were a triumph as far as I am concerned.  Then, of course, he hung in there as a steadily working actor right up until his death in 1970, but one that lacked star status and the recognition for his talent that he deserved.

ISome of the plots of Boston Blackie are better than others, for sure, but as a rule they are witty, clever, and just plain fun!  Think William Powell's The Thin Man (whom I also love!) minus the booze and cigarettes--and Myrna Loy.  Boston Blackie isn't as sophisticated and debonair as Nick Charles, but he has a lot to offer as a savvy reformed crook-- and he is sober.  (Note:  More suitable for kids to watch with parents. Boston Blackie is a blast!  And a GOOD GUY.)

The dialogue is witty and fast, and the characters play off one another very well.  The bulldog-like Detective Farraday and his dimwitted sidekick are perfect foils for each other, and sharp-as-nails Blackie takes good care of his little buddy Runt while using him to help solve cases.  The dames are there for window dressing but not to be trusted.  The stories include Blackie adopting disguises, playing any number of clever tricks on their adversaries, and performing some pretty incredible feats of derring-do to gain their ends.

That's another contrast to Powell's character:  While Nick Charles is a cerebral detective only, Boston Blackie provides an action figure to watch.  He doesn't hesitate to charge right in there and tackle the bad guys, often while the cops look on or are dazed from being banged around by same bad guys.  What a guy!  Not that Farraday isn't a smart cop:  He's right in there pitching.  But Boston Blackie has tricks up his sleeve that are just plain astounding, and Farraday is hampered by his dumb partner, so it's sometimes just not possible to beat Blackie to the punch.

So many '40s cliches; so little time.  You'll have to watch Boston Blackie to believe--and appreciate--him.",1497657600,,2258,4.750642673521851
6854668,5,B00Q5LAH2E,The story lines are so cute.  It's gentle humor.  I've only watched 3 cds so far.  The quality of the film is fantastic.  The sound is good. I recommend The Onesmedia Company that put this collection together.,1496880000,,209,4.5675675675675675

6854688,3,B00Q5LAH2E,"Meet Boston Blackie, 1941 film

Ship passengers arrive at a port. A man warns Miss Howard to avoid departing. Boston Blackie helps her. Then he meets Inspector Faraday, who questions him. What does he know about the Mansfield Pearls? Faraday wants him at headquarters. Blackie goes to his stateroom and finds that mans body! Now he must find Miss Howard fast. Blackie visits a carnival [a form of entertainment that is almost obsolete today] and meets Miss Howard. She explains what happened. Two men follow them in a ride. One throws a dart to kill Miss Howard. Blackie flees, the two men chase him! But he escapes. There is a car chase, but Blackie escapes in the car of Miss Bradley. They hide in a freight car. The train leaves with them, but they are followed. Why do they want to kill him? asks Miss Bradley.

At home Blackie meets Inspector Faraday, who later sends out an alarm for Blackie since his fingerprints were on the dart that killed Miss Howard (a known spy). Blackie returns to that sea-side carnival. Blackie sees a ship at sea that flashes lights, like a signal. He calls Runt and gives him a message. Blackie adopts a disguise to search for a lighted sign. He observes an event, but Faraday shows up to arrest him! Blackie eludes this in a clever trick (for comedy). Blackie hears a Morse code transmission by these spies. He makes a deal with Faraday, then leaves with Miss Cecilia Bradley. The police noted the license plate. Runt returns to that carnival and visits the freak show, but is sapped. The police tracked Cecilias address in Brooklyn and go there. They then go to the carnival, find Blackie, and stop the spies. The Navy bombsight was saved from foreign spies. The charges against Blackie are dropped, he is free for now.

Note how all the men wear hats. The US had a very accurate bombsight, but it required daylight conditions. Fog and clouds affected it until a radar bombsight was invented.",1469232000,,1929,4.651026392961877

6854695,5,B00Q5LAH2E,"The Boston Blackie film collection consists of sixteen movies on eight disks. Grant there were only fourteen Boston Blackie movies made, also include are the final two movies from the Whistler movie series. The entire series in fourteen hours and fifty  six minutes; if you and the two movies from the Whistler series then it is seventeen hours and two minutes. First let me tell you what you don't get. You don't get any scene selections, languages, coming attractions and\or commentary. I would of like one of them to had a commentary to find out why actor George E. Stone who played the Runt in movies two through thirteen but not the first movie or the last. I understand George was sick and could not do the first movie, but I do not know why he was unable to do the last movie. Also the company logo the created this box set Onesmedia show up in each movie. Chester Morris who plays Boston Blackie and Richard Lane who plays Inspector Faraday are the only two actors to play the same role in all movies. When Chester Morris was once asked why he did all the Boston Blackie movies his response was that he got to play the lead. Overall the Boston Blackie films are great to watch though once you get to the few movies in the series the plot start to get week. And before I forget the transfer to DVD with the two Whistler movies are horrible. Overall the Boston Blackie film collection gets an AAA+++.

6854722,5,B00Q5LAH2E,"Pulp writer Jack Boyle's gentleman thief Boston Blackie had made his screen debut during the silent era and popped up on an irregular basis until the early talkies. Then in 1941 Columbia Pictures released the first of what totaled a 14-episode series ending in 1949. Chester Morris imbued Blackie with an outwardly cocky, humorous, energetic personality but with an inner core of toughness when called for - and always called for throughout the series. In the premiere we ""Meet Boston Blackie,"" once a very successful thief, caught, imprisoned, released and now a sort of free-lance trouble shooter. He is aided/hindered by The Runt, a loyal sidekick: actors Charles Wagenheim in the first, George E. Stone (the most memorable) in the next 12, and Sid Tomach in the last. Blackie's main threat throughout the series is NYC Police Inspector Farraday, ably played by Richard Lane, the only actor besides Morris to appear in every title. Though containing a set-piece formula - Blackie helps the underdog while avoiding arrest by the forever suspicious Farraday - the films were not produced like the unforgettable ZIV 50's cheap two-per-week syndicated TV series. Released a couple times per year, each Columbia film had production values, and seasoned character actors ably performing the make-believe cinematic murder, mayhem, mystery and mirth packed into each plot. Ironically, Chester Morris was a star on Broadway in the 1920s and an Academy Award nominated lead in big budget MGM movies in the 1930s, but about appearing in the low budget Blackie pictures, which made a fortune for Columbia, he said, "" After that a producer wouldn't put me in an 'A' movie even if I paid for the privilege. The only thing I could do was get out and go back to the theater."" Now, instead of Columbia, One's Media has packaged the series in order of original theatrical release in a dazzling black and white DVD at a reasonable price for fans of older movies.

Chester Morris played Boston Blackie in fourteen Hollywood films between 1941 and 1949, all produced by Columbia Pictures.
Basically a rip-off of The Saint, but great fun nonetheless.
And Boston Blackie was not the only rip-off of the Saint in the 1940s - He was not even the only rip-off of the Saint produced by Columbia Pictures.
I am a sucker for B-Movies about reformed jewel thieves turned private detectives:

- George Sanders as the Saint (RKO Radio Pictures)
- Warren William as The Lone Wolf (Columbia pictures)
- Chester Morris as Boston Blackie (Columbia Pictures)

Class Distinction:
The Saint and The Lone Wolf were pretty much indistinguishable: Swanky upper-class reformed jewel thieves turned detectives.
Boston Blackie was more of a Common Man reformed jewel thief turned private detective.

OnesMedia has produced the only available collection of all fourteen Boston Blackie movies, and is selling them at a very nice price.
Seven DVDs in a CD-size plastic clamshell case with soft plastic sleeves (the same packaging this company uses for CDs of old radio shows).
Picture quality ranges from OK to pretty good, but OnesMedia did a heroic job of cleaning up the sound.
No subtitles, but I wasn't expecting any at this price.
These are DVD-Rs, but I had no problem playing them.
Finally, THERE IS NO COMPETITION.

GUIDE TO B-MOVIE DETECTIVES ON DVD
A-Movies had bigger budgets and stars, and were top-billed in a double-feature.
B-Movies occupied the bottom of the program.
Some of the longer-lasting series started out as A-Movies, but ended up as B-Movies (Philo Vance began at Paramount and ended up at PRC)

PART ONE: REFORMED CRIMINALS TURNED PRIVATE EYE
- Boston Blackie, the Lone Wolf and the Saint are reformed jewel thieves. Still viewed with suspicion by the police.
- The Falcon has a shady past (never quite explained).
- Arsene Lupin is an unreformed jewel thief who sometimes helps the police if it serves his ends.
- The Crime Doctor used to be an Organized Crime Boss. He never actually reformed, but was conked over the head and woke up with amnesia.

PHILIP MARLOWE / SAM SPADE
These two detectives were the most famous Private Eyes of all time, but they don't really belong on this list.
They were A-Movie detectives all the way:
- 1931 The Maltese Falcon: Ricardo Cortez as Sam Spade
- 1936 Satan Met a Lady: Warren William as Sam Spade - adapted from 'The Maltese Falcon' by Dashiell Hammett
- 1941 The Maltese Falcon: Humphrey Bogart as Sam Spade
- 1944 Murder, My Sweet: Dick Powell as Philip Marlowe - adapted from 'Farewell, My Lovely' by Raymond Chandler
- 1946 The Big Sleep: Humphrey Bogart as Philip Marlowe.
- 1947 Lady in the Lake: Robert Montgomery as Philip Marlowe.
- 1947 The Brasher Doubloon: George Montgomery as Philip Marlowe - adapted from 'The High Window"" by Raymond Chandler

But two Philip Marlowe novels were adapted as B-Movies for other detectives:
- 1942 Time to Kill (Lloyd Nolan as Michael Shayne) - adaptated from 'The High Window' by Raymond Chandler
- 1942 The Falcon Takes Over (George Sanders as The Falcon)) - adapted from 'Farewell My Lovely' by Raymond Chandler

6854736,5,B00Q5LAH2E,"These are fast-paced and witty b-movie mystery/thrillers from the 1940s.  The actors are all very good in their parts and the stories are engaging at about an hour long each.  One's Media's $32 set is very-reasonably-priced and they offer excellent customer service (the best I've experienced from an Amazon seller).  The film prints are a bit soft (comparable to a copy from a good T.V. broadcast or the studio archive collections), but the soundtrack is clear, and fourteen films for $32 is a steal.  I had trouble with a few of the films initially -- two of them were in the wrong aspect-ratio, one had aliasing problems, and some had the soundtrack all in the left channel.  However, One's Media responded very quickly and courteously, and immediately sent me a complete replacement set at no charge -- with the problems corrected.  I'm purchasing more of these collections from them.

The One's Media b&w logo appears on every film in the lower left corner for about thirty seconds every twenty minutes or so, and that's unfortunate, but not terrible.  The discs are packaged in a multi-CD clamshell case, with linen-lined plastic sleeves on a ring binder.  The lining on the sleeves keeps the discs from getting scratched and makes them easy to slide in and out.

I highly recommend these enjoyable movies in this attractive and economical collection.",1424304000,45,1357,4.938325991189427

I even received a ""Bonus Gift"" - this seller is most generous.  Despite the fact that there was a 'caution' to change the aspect on my television to view the movies better, that was totally UN-necessary - the movies were clear and clean and no skipping or anything like that.

We're very pleased and think that this seller is very good.  The packaging was secure and it arrived in great condition.  No problems at all.  Highly recommend! :-)",1520380800,2,569,4.529411764705882
8690458,3,B00Q5LAH2E,"I love these old black and white mysteries from the 30's and 40's. But, i have two major complaints about this set. One, I have a hard time rooting for an admitted jewel thief who has a wiseguy smile on his face all the time. And two, the packaging of this set leaves a lot to be desired. The discs are contained in a cheap plastic square held together with two cheap plastic rings, one of which was broken on arrival. Also, the discs are separated by a thin tissue like cloth which makes for difficult removal and insertion. My advice, if you are a die-hard Boston Blackie fan, then go for it. All others, there are better movies out there.",1520294400,2,641,4.305785123966942
