2221005,5,B0007N1BBC,"In this adaptation, a former clergyman uproots his family from their bucolic Southern existence and transplants them to the Northern industrial town of Milton. His daughter, Margaret, is a proud Southerner whose scorn for tradesmen initially causes conflict and insult as she acquaints herself and interacts with the hardworking Northerners, both the working class as well as the masters who own the mills. In particular, she finds John Thornton, a mill owner and her father's new pupil, to be the most offensive after witnessing his brutal treatment of an employee.

Thornton, however, finds himself drawn to Margaret's strong will and decidedly firm opinions. He seeks to overcome her contempt of him through reason and words but her longing for the South makes it impossible for him to verbalize his thoughts in a way that will appease her. When she begins to sympathize with the mill workers, conflict between the two of them creates a schism that seems almost impossible to bridge.

The television adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's North and South bears no reference to the Civil War that took place in the United States. Rather, the setting of the story takes place in England and the title refers to the contrasting outlooks that were brought about due to the Industrial Revolution. And while Margaret and Thornton are constantly at odds with each other over the plight of the workers, their war is limited to verbal sparring. The conflict between Thornton and the workers, on the other hand, touches upon the developing power of the union workers and does border on the violent though it never escalates into a full-fledged war.

Because Thornton is truly at the heart of this adaptation, it is reasonable to say that Richard Armitage's portrayal was essential to the success of the miniseries. It is fortunate that he gave such a powerful performance that displayed his character's role as a respected business owner and a man beset by love for a woman who clearly disdains him.

Also of note is Daniela Denby-Ashe's performance as Margaret whose Southern sensibilities are the catalyst for change regarding the workers as well as Thornton. Strong support comes from Sinead Cusack, whose portrayal of Thornton's proud and protective mother gives heart to a character who initially seems to have none and Brendan Coyle, who gives a powerful and sometimes painfully humorous performance as Nicholas Higgins, the third character who is key to putting Thornton in touch with his own humanity.

The BBC did a fantastic job with this adaptation despite the liberties it took with the book. I greatly anticipate its availability in the United States come November.",1125273600,15,2666,5.091533180778032
2221006,5,B0007N1BBC,"I was one of the lucky few who caught this amazing miniseries on the BBC America channel and I immediately fell in love. A million and a half times better than most of the regular movies out there, I went out and bought the book because of how much I loved this movie. Every single person in this miniseries is cast perfectly. When books become movies, there are always one or two casting choices you disagree with. That is not the case here. Seriously, they could not have possibly done a better job. I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS MOVIE!!! Everyone should buy this!",1125187200,10,559,4.384615384615385
2221007,5,B0007N1BBC,"I knew nothing of either ""North and South"" or Richard Armitage when I first sat down to watch this wonderful 4-part series.

But I sure did once I got up four hours later!

I knew that I'd discovered one of the best working actors I'd ever seen.

All of the other reviews have pretty much covered the overall excellence of the production itself, the other actors, the music, etc.  I just want to wax on about this amazing man who so totally infused John Thornton with his energy and talent.

Aside from his general ""swoon-ability,"" he never hit a misstep.  Every look, line delivery, and body movement was spot on!  From the first time he opened his mouth to scream, ""STEPHENS!"" at the top of his lungs to his soft, boyishly joyful ""Coming home with me?"" at the end, I simply couldn't take my eyes of him.

He's not handsome in a traditional way.  At first glance, I was rather dismissive of the much-heralded ""Darcy"" factor.  He looked autocratic, harsh featured, and snarly as he was seen through a cloud of cotton fluff surveying the workers in his cotton mill.  Two or three scenes later, when he smiled, I nearly fell onto my floor in a swoon.  And I am not particularly given to giddy swooning as a general rule.

Unfortunately, the BBCA cut out nearly 14 minutes from each episode, so it wasn't until I watched the region 2 DVD that I bought from amazon.co.uk, that I saw some key missing scenes which explained the story development better.  And of course, included with the ""goodies"" is a post-production interview with RA himself.

I think that one of the main reasons that I enjoyed RA's portrayal so much was because he really brought a fully-developed male character to life in a Victorian drama.  So many times, the stories are told solely from the female aspect.  The viewer is left with only the brooding exterior of the male to watch.  This character of JT had such growth in his personal philosophy, his inter-personal relationships, as well as his professional dealings, and I found myself excited about sharing those growth steps with him.

By the end of Episode 4, I was torn between wanting to see some resolution between the lovebirds and wanting to stay with them on their endless search for an uninterrupted conversation with each other.  But, if it had to end...WOW!!!  What an ending!  It was the most romantic ending I could have desired.  It was so sweet and tender that I had tears in my eyes.  I probably looked a loony goon sitting there grinning at my TV but I didn't care.  And I still don't care each time I sit and sigh as they embrace.  The light feathery kisslings [made up word] elicit sighs even though I'm working on high double digit viewings of this DVD right now!

If you loved Colin Firth as ""Mr Darcy"" in ""Pride and Prejudice,"" trust me you'll be ecstatic over the amount of screen time RA has as ""JT"" in ""N&S.""  And what excellent use he makes of that screen time!

RA Rulez!

2221008,5,B0007N1BBC,"Although Mrs Gaskell is not my favourite author - it's Jane Austen forever!! - I find her novels quite nice and entertaining. It was some years ago when I read the novel N&S. I liked it but it did not make a lasting impression. I roughly remebered the storyline and that was all. So knowing the novel in itself wouldn't have moved me to purchace the film, but having read the reviews I felt intrigued - better than Mr Darcy/Firth ??!! - and thought I'll give it a try.

So yesterday afternoon I thought I'd watch an episode, maybe two, in-between some ironing and ... I ended up watching the whole series in one and didn't do too much ironing.

The 1st episode started like a typical costume drama with a wedding party, gossip and dancing: nice but nothing special really. However, when I got to the scene where Margaret is meeting John Thornton for the first time - a dark angel in the ""white hell"" - I was completely absorbed by the story.

Richard Armitage as Mr Thornton intrigued me from the first (actually I remember preferring this character to Margaret Hale's in the book). He is absolutely wonderful: charismatic, brooding and brutal (ok, I know it's female drooling over him, but I simply can't help it!). And as his character gained more and more dimensions I simply fell in love with him myself. He is upright, honest and despite strict discipline passionate and sensitive. One of my favourite scenes with him - all his scenes are my favourites when I come to think about it! - is when he is watching Margaret depart in the carriage and concetrating his whole being on making her look back ... OOOOHHHHH, his sheer force of concentration/compulsion sent shivers down my spine. I think his character is wonderfully elaborated: starting from the ""brute"" beating one of his employees cruelly (though it turns out he has his reasons); the loving son the mother is devoted to; the man suffering to control his unreturned love and passion; the rejected man in love helping Margaret (although he is risking his credibility and reputation as a magistrate) despite his hurt feelings; the employer getting closer to his workers (dining with them together)and a future family man (treating the little orphan kindly). The happy smile (SIGH, SIGH) at the end is as becoming as his brooding before.

Richard Armitage (son) and Sinead Cusack (Hannah Thornton, the mother) are simply wonderful together. The strong bond of affection, based on their absolute trust in each other, is almost tangible between them. I think my top favourite scenes are their pas de deux before and after the proposal. They really took my breath away.
Daniela is a lovely, sensitive Margaret, though a bit pale and monoton besdide Richard Armitage and Sinead Cusack. However she succeeds in displaying the gradual change of her character: from prejudiced, sophisticated Southerner to a person appreciating people for their true worth not for the (country)sides they represent.
Fanny, Thornton's sister is harshly colourful in clothes and vulgar and hilarious in character very suitingly opposed to both her mother & brother and Margaret. Her light touch is very welcome.

The minor characters - Margaret's parents, Nicholas & Betsey Higgins, Mr Bell, the other mill owners - play their parts very convincingly.

The strong contrasts are everywhere: in scenery, coustumes, colours and music. I think the costumes suited the characters very well - dark, strict colours for John and Hannah Thornton, light and feminine for Margaret, harsh for Fanny. The music is also very moving. The Edinburgh scenery for Milton suits the atmosphere of the series wonderfully.

BUY THIS! You will not regret it!",1124928000,24,3668,4.93517017828201
2221009,5,B0007N1BBC,"I kid, I kid-I love Mr. Darcy and Colin Firth just as fervently now as I did when ""Pride and Prejudice"" first came out.

But I have to give huge props to BBC for doing the near impossible-of being able to pull off yet another literary adaption that can just pull the viewer in as well as ""Pride and Prejudice.""

I won't bore you with synopsis details, but you will care about these characters immensely and root them on 'til the end. The gal who plays Margaret is just perfect-she's a nineteenth century I-am-woman-hear-me-roar and you just want to high five the gal as she insists upon doing the right thing, even when it costs her. She's a 'lil spitfire, don't let the drab dresses fool you!

And of course, let's get to Mr. Thorton. Armitage is just flawless, you can't deny it. His Mr. Thorton can smolder with the best of them(aka Colin Firth) and yet his doesn't let the smolder obscure his character, warts and all(and even those come off attractive in some odd way)..

And the ending scene? Geesh, talk about a big payoff for us modern viewers! I know some have criticized the ending for the ""payoff""(I won't spoil it for you folks) for not following the eitquette of the day or the book, but who cares! Let's just say I'm buying my husband one of those hot little white poet-like shirts asap and making him meet me at a train station this weekend...

ps-I have a sister who HATES Victorian and Regency literature and  thinks most of these period dramas are too corny etc. I actually got her to sit down and watch the first episode, and the girl was hooked. She loved Margaret's spunky spirit and social commentary, so this really is a crowd pleaser in alot of ways...",1124841600,24,1676,4.478688524590164
2221010,5,B0007N1BBC,"Well, most of what I could say has been said by others, so...

Suffice it to say that this is one of the best productions--if not the best--ever to come from the BBC.  Strong acting, great tension, and a compelling storyline all combine to make what's become one of my favorite movies.  If you're a fan of quality historical drama, you really can't go wrong with this one.",1124668800,11,372,4.4411764705882355
2221011,5,B0007N1BBC,"When I stumbled across an upcoming DVD entitled ""North & South"" on Amazon UK's website earlier this year, I had no idea what was in store...I bought the DVD sight unseen, taking a chance that the BBC would do a good job as always: man, was I surprised!  This BBC series is absolutely fantastic!!  I have always been a huge fan of 1995's ""Pride & Prejudice"", as well as other BBC (and other companies') period movies: ""North & South"" has endeared itself to my heart, and is quickly becoming my favorite period film in at least a decade!

Margaret Hale's world is turned upside-down when her minister father gives up his Southern ""Helstone"" parish and moves her and her mother to the Northern industrial town, ""Milton.""  Her first encounter with mill owner Mr. Thornton leaves much to be desired and leaves her feeling that ""the North"" is an untenable place to live.  After spending time getting to know the plight of the various poor mill workers and taking care of her beloved and now-ailing mother, Margaret begins to warm to her new town: but can a ""Southern"" gal as she ever truly feel at home in such an alien ""Northern"" place?  And will she ever be able to get past her initial dislike of Mr. Thornton?

This is a fantastic, beautifully-filmed and well-done series (aired on BBC USA in July)!  The cinematography is so excellent and compelling, and the scenes wonderfully acted: Daniela Denby Ashe as Margaret Hale and Richard Armitage as Mr. Thornton are completely wonderful.  If you have seen this series, let me just say the train scene is one of my favorites of all time!  The content is kept to mild violence (of angry mill workers) and little else: clean and family-friendly, this great TV series will endear itself to your heart as much as mine, just give it a chance...

If you can find the time, read the book by Elizabeth Gaskell: I just finished it, and let me tell you, it is absolutely amazing!  BBC did a good job of adapting it (although some storyline and characters have been altered for the sake of time).

Again, this is a wonderful series and well worth the time, effort and money you will spend!",1124668800,506,2122,4.596816976127321
2221012,5,B0007N1BBC,"This recent 2004 BBC production of Elizabeth Gaskell's North & South is a stunningly romantic vision of repressed love between two charmingly stubborn people and introduces Richard Armitage as the broodingly handsome John Thornton.  Mr. Armitage breathes fiery life into this magnificient character, in turn creating for himself a legion of adoring fans around the world.  Aided by an excellent cast, the story unfolds in a mesmerizing and totally addictive manner, drawing the viewer back again and again to relive the experience.  You will not be disappointed in this DVD.",1124409600,13,574,5.355555555555555
2221013,5,B0007N1BBC,"I give high recommendation for you readers to see this exceptional production of BBC, based on the novel by Elizabeth Gaskell. I have a number of BBC productions here, but this one is remarkable and quite different.

  To begin, this four-episode film has a darker shade than the rest of them; for good reasons, too, since the story is set in the industrial town of Milton in northern England, sometime during the mid 1800's, if I'm not mistaken. As one of the characters puts it: ""a God-forsaken place where people breathe smoke and eat money!"" Pollution, death and class distinction between workers and their masters are much evidently played out here. Even the message about unions and strikes are unashamedly laid out on the table. BBC's renditions of ""David Copperfield"" and ""Our Mutual Friend"" were never this dark, brooding and straightforward.

  Another merit this film has is its fiery intensity and passion. Just the scene where Margaret rejects Mr. Thornton is proof enough. People may say that this scene is just another ""Pride and Prejudice"" in another packaging, but still Director Brian Percival did a very good job of distinguishing this one from the former, even topping it out, as many testimonials in Amazon. UK and here will point out.

  Many reviewers will say that this and that character steals the screen, but in my point of view, they are all scene stealers. The performances are top-rate, especially by the two mothers, who seem to symbolize opposite ends of disposition to me. I love both of them. Just watch as the soft-spoken Mrs. Hale (Lesley Manville) scold her husband for dragging them into ""this God-forsaken place!"" Watch, too, for the scene where tough Mrs. Thornton (Sinead Cusack,) in a surprising turn, counsels her son to pursue Miss Hale. As for the two younger leads, they are marked for their likability and attractiveness. Miss Denby-Ashe is simply beautiful as Margaret Hale, our sweet-natured but surprisingly head-strong female protagonist. Her belief in other people's good is what won me over. As for the uncommonly handsome Mr. Armitage, well, I read a review at Amazon. UK where the reviewer commented that she ovulated everytime the guy popped into the screen. Now although it is impossible for me to ovulate, I can at least give weight to her praises. I don't ever recall seeing such a strong male screen presence before. This may be the reason why the ""rejection scene"" was pulled off perfectly.

  Hey, isn't that the adorable Pegotty (Pauline Quirke) from ""David Copperfield"" in another role as household servant?

  I do admit that this production has at least one misfire: the ending was a bit maple-syrupy. After all the fiery intensity the movie went through, the ending seems a bit out of place. Mr. Thornton became quiet and subdued and happy all of a sudden, after much scowling and smouldering throughtout. I wondered whether Margaret doubted his intentions since she had come into a considerable fortune. But ladies, I don't believe any of you will care about what I just said here. All you will care about is Richard Armitage, and Richard Armitage alone, plus his kiss!! And guys, isn't Daniela Denby-Ashe simply adorable? So who cares about that tiny misfire, right? And anyway, Margaret could not have had thoughts of doubt regarding Mr. Thornton's character, since it was she who believed in him first and foremost.

  All in all, the production values are exemplary, the performances top-notch. The electricity and romance are to die for. E. Gaskell's message is truthful enough, I just wished that the world we live in nowadays could solve its problems by simply understanding the other side, and dialogue. This film teaches something about giving way to others.

  Finally, special mention to the magnificent score by Martin Phipps. Here, I wish to gain the attention of BBC: kudos for including ""Deleted Scenes"" into the Special Features. But it would have been more interesting if you didn't dispose of ""The Making Of..."" and ""The Music Of..."" that were normally mainstays of your DVDs. These are things I have come to love in a BBC DVD. I'm sure there are a lot of people out there who share my views on this matter.

  A note to would-be viewers: one particular death scene (there are four in all!!) might disturb younger viewers.",1124409600,28,4308,4.934903047091413
2221014,5,B0007N1BBC,"""North & South"" was released in the UK in November 2004 and in the US in July 2005. Since its first broadcast, viewers across the globe have hailed it as one of the best - if not the best - British period miniseries ever produced. It was voted BBC's ""Best of 2004"" in drama, actor and actress categories, among others.

Many in the US will probably confuse Elizabeth Gaskell's ""North & South"" to John Jake's civil war drama of the same name.  While Jake's tells the story of America's north and south, Gaskell's story is rooted in Victorian England. John Thornton, a handsome, stern, passionate manufacturer from Milton represents the north. Margaret Hale, an outspoken, beautiful and spirited young woman from Helstone represents the south.  When the Hales move from the idyllic village of Helstone to the bustling, industrial city of Milton, Margaret and Thornton's lives collide.

John Thornton is instantly attracted to Margaret while she is repulsed by his haughty demeanor and the way he treats his employees.  She develops a disdain for the wealthy 'masters' (manufacturers) and strikes a friendship with the daughter of the local union leader, much to Thornton's dismay.  As Margaret becomes better acquainted with Mr. Thornton, she gradually comes to admire him.  She discovers that he is hardworking, a devoted brother and son, generous and kind to Margaret's parents, and is loyal and honorable.  However, when the workers in Milton strike, the turn of events that follow drive a wedge between Margaret and Thornton and eventually threaten to pull them apart.

""North & South"" is produced by the excellent BBC and the screenplay was written by Sandy Welch, who also penned the outstanding ""Our Mutual Friend.""  Everything you would expect from a topnotch BBC production is here - locations, sets, costumes, casting, direction, cinematography.  The story is an adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's little known but well loved 19th century novel.  Mrs. Gaskell also wrote ""Wives & Daughters"" which was turned to another superb miniseries starring Justine Waddell, Keeley Hawes and Francesca Annis in 1999.

I would be very remiss in writing a review for this miniseries without applauding the exemplary cast.  The little known Richard Armitage has earned a throng of fans overnight because of his unforgettable portrayal of John Thornton.  He has since replaced Pride & Prejudice's Colin Firth as my favorite brooding hero and infuses so much passion and charisma into his role.  Daniela Denby-Ashe is wonderful and charming as Margaret Hale.  Also excellent are Brendan Coyle as the gruff but good-hearted Nicholas Higgins, Sinead Cusack as John Thornton's haughty but devoted mother, Joy Joyner as the funny and superficial Fanny Thornton, Lesley Manville as Mrs. Hale and Tim Piggot-Smith as Mr. Hale.

""North & South"" has since replaced 1995's ""Pride & Prejudice"" as my favorite miniseries.  It tugs at the heart and sweeps the viewer off their feet.  The relationships that develop between its main characters (notably, Thornton and Margaret; Thornton and Higgins; Margaret and Bessy Higgins) and the journey that Margaret and Thornton go through are truly unforgettable.  In fact, you will wish that the ending didn't come so soon!

""North and South"" went through a sad process of editing when BBC America aired it in July 2005. A full hour was cut from the miniseries to make room for commercials.  Finally, with this dvd release US viewers now have a chance to see this instant classic as it was meant to be seen - with a 233 minute running time and with all the scenes intact.  The dvd also includes a delightful interview with Richard Armitage, a handful of deleted scenes (including an extended 'proposal' scene), commentaries and cast biographies.

If you are an anglophile or a fan of high-quality period drama, you owe it to yourself to see ""North & South."" Fans of ""Pride & Prejudice,"" ""Wives & Daughters,"" ""Middlemarch,"" Dickens / Austen adaptations and the like should not miss this.  I have no doubt that most of you will fall in love with this miniseries as many of us have. Everyone whom I have recommended this miniseries to have at least liked it (and at most, are completely obsessed with it).  This dvd is a keeper and deserves a place in any period drama fan's dvd collection.",1124323200,902,4307,5.029577464788733

2221104,3,B0007N1BBC,"There are some interesting elements to the story which remind me of Pride and Prejudice in that the romantic leads are at odds yet the male lead, Thornton, falls for Margaret, despite her disdain for his behavior and actions. However, it stops there in tone, mood and characters. In a gloomy, northern England mill town with the workers at strike,  Margaret Hale, a clergyman's daughter, is caught between her empathy with strike workers and the stern mill owner, Thornton's, pursuit of her affections.  There are many fine, familiar British actors in this series however, the series suffers from an ill-chosen lead actress whose only acting technique is to stare, cow-like or hold her mouth in a permanent  mouth-breathing pout. The script forces dialogue which frequently refers to Margaret's  great ""beauty"", however the actress Gabrielle Denby-Ashe, is not one and exudes no charm or spirit.

2221108,5,B0007N1BBC,"I had seen the first few minutes of ""North and South"" and set the movie aside as a little fluffy. The frenetic wedding scene is very different from the rest. But I had time one day to watch more - and finished the whole series in one sitting. My view changed as Margaret Hale's vision of Milton and Mr. Thornton changed. Then I read the book - and it's my favorite period romance, with everything from social commentary to romance. After writing ""Mary Barton,"" and hearing flack from the leaders of trade, I think author Elizabeth Gaskell sat down and said, ""Okay, how do I present a mill owner who is positive? Who would be an ideal master?"" And there she went. And the female saves the day - she doesn't sit pining for her love (though there is painful pining on both sides); she keeps moving and doing. I can't emphasize this enough - these are two characters we would like to be like. We would like to have Margaret's bravery, responsibility, and generosity, and John's determination, passion, and morality. We can look up to both of these people.

The primary setting is Milton (Manchester). Margaret moves from a place of golden beauty to one of gray industry. Her entrance into the cotton factory never happened in the book, but it's a gorgeous Narnian opening of a heavy door into another world. The introduction of Thornton (he beats a smoking worker) was not in the book other than the phrase ""it's a word and a blow with Thornton,"" but I think the filmmakers would have a hard time conveying the different classes and divide of gentry and trade workers. Margaret is horrified and takes sides. She adjusts and finds ways she can help others - from a mill worker with cotton in her lungs and Bessie's union-leader father. Through the book and movie, she grows into a person who can finally embrace the true worth of a person, as Thornton grows toward becoming a better master from his experience with the Hales - Margaret removing her former ideas of ""shoppy,"" ""trade,"" and ""gentleman""; and Mr. Thornton replacing ""hands"" with ""men."" In the end, each character exchanges best pieces of each other.

The acting is excellent. Richard Armitage and Daniela Denby-Ashe make the film. Armitage is simultaneously and believably the controlled and principled master, and also the kneeling son and vulnerable lover. All of the minor characters are wonderful: Mr. Bell, with his gloss and dancing moves; Bessie, who is funny and not so woeful as in the book; Higgins, who is humorous and helpful; Mr. Hale, with his faults of cloudiness but his love for Margaret; Mrs. Thornton, with her rigid love for a good son...just on and on. I would encourage anyone to read the book; there is such gorgeous pathos - I've never felt my heart actually hurt when reading something, but it did during the prolonged period of longing. In both book and film, I came away with the satisfaction of love realized, more awareness of the changes the industrial revolution wrought, and aspiration to hold similar values to those of Margaret Hale and John Thornton. I highly recommend this film.",1502409600,3,3072,4.7401869158878505

If this is from a book, I've never read it so I don't know if his character was intended to be as explosive as it's portrayed here. As a gently brought up minister's daughter, the girl he is in love with is simply a desire he should forgo as it's shown that he  is prone to violent (even if his anger is justified) outbursts. He is more fearful than romantic in my opinion. When his character shows improvement at the end, I'm skeptical.

I was rewatching it so much on Netflix, I decided to buy the DVD so I can enjoy it on my theater system. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SHOW!!! If you're a fan of BBC period dramas/ love stories, this may be your cup of tea.
However, somewhere on its journey, the case was damaged. I heard what sounded like the DVD sliding in the case. I was concerned, but this happens at times in shipping where the DVD pops out of the snap-holder. I opened the package gingerly, trying not to cause any more scratches than what had probably already occurred. As it turned out, the first DVD was on one of the flippable disc holders that snap into the case, while the second was in the molded niche on the back.
Both DVDs were still fastened in their spots, but the top clip that held the flipping case snapped in half. The top DVD was sliding around in the case! I still have the broken piece of clip, so I'll see if it can be super-glued back in place.

It's a little disheartening to buy New and receive damage, but this seems an easy fix. I love this show so much I paid for Two-Day shipping, and this tiny piece, I don't believe, warrants a return.

2221276,3,B0007N1BBC,"I'll start off by saying I am a huge fan of BBC miniseries.
The movie itself had excellent supporting actors and for that alone, I couldn't rate this below a 3. But the heroine, Margaret Hale was very painful to watch.
The actress, Daniela Denby-ashe portrayed her as someone who had a semi-confused stare throughout the film. She would stare for about 20 minutes while going about her business and then suddenly, snaps at others around her and promptly goes back to the stare for another 20 minutes or so. Yet, the people around her marvel at her integrity, mannerism etc.
I also believe Daniela-D-A lacked the beauty that Miss Hale was required to possess, (judging by how often we're reminded of it by supporting actors). Despite her wearing the most makeup and flattering outfits, Miss Denby-ashe, in my opinion, seemed to have been out-shined by almost every female cast on the set and so the endless praises concerning her beauty started to feel hollow and awkward to watch.
While DDA was pretty in her own ways, this character called for an actress with the striking beauty of Keira Knightley, Rachel Weisz or someone else, obviously beautiful in the eyes of all viewers. And unfortunately, DDA was not that, at least in this production. That is not something I blame the actress for but I do blame the casting.
I really believe Richard Armitage, who played Mr. Thornton, (along with great supporting actors) is what resulted in this movie being rated 5 stars. He gave a great performance and had to pick up the slack for the lack luster performance given by DDA.
It was difficult to tell when and what exactly attracted Mr. Thornton to Miss Hale.
I haven't read the book but this production lead me to believe that Miss Hale was an unlikable character. The more I watched, the more I increasingly became annoyed by the heroine. She was snobbish in her demeanor but the integrity she supposedly possessed had to do with snapping at others and making judgmental assumptions. She seemed minimally affected by everything that was happening around her. Even her mother's death, best friend's death, and father's death, failed to affect Miss Hale in a moving way. She had a somber expression and that was it. No conveying of pain, emotions, sadness, nothing. Miraculously, Mr. Thornton was attracted to her and even proposed marriage but she brushes him off with that same ""semi-confused"" stare of hers.

What awesome acting and fantastic chemistry between Daniela Denby-Ashe and Richard Armitage. They have the most beautiful and expressive eyes. I know, no one looks as good wearing a cravat as Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy, Richard Armitage as Mr. Thornton, and Rupert Penry-Jones as Captain Wentworth.

2221288,4,B0007N1BBC,"Can't help but love the chemistry between these two as the story develops.  It made me want to read the original - which I did after watching (and regretting) the Patrick Stewart '75 tv series (it's just tooooo dated) - and discovered how well this mini-series was put together.

Chemistry of the leads aside, I am still mesmerized by the excellent performances of Brendan Coyle (Higgins), Sin&eacute;ad Cusack (Mrs. Thornton), Anna Maxwell Martin (Bessy Higgins) and the quirks Jo Joyner gave to her character (Fanny Thornton).  So much so that I will occasionally skip over story to watch particular scenes - over and over again.  They are just that good (Thornton & Higgins, for example)!

Richard Armitage, Daniela Denby-Ashe and Brendan Coyle made this movie come alive as their acting is superior. The music in this film was quite  good and the secondary characters had a lot to add keeping the story lively.

It is a marvelous piece of work. The lead actors in the show are very compelling in their pretrial of the characters. The music that introduces each episode is compelling and hits the heart strings beautifully. The snow and wonderment of the mill in the opening scene was almost a wonderland for Ms. Hale then to be abrubtly stripped away to the harsher realities which she was plunged into.

It is very raw and full of unspoken emotion. Unlike Pride and Prejudice and so many other beautiful works of literary art this one goes into the depths of human suffering beyond those of a young woman from a parishioners family. It delves into the periods lack of dignity towards the lower classes of the time. The starvation, child labor, and so many more things.  I have never cried so much for the main characters. Not just for the love that was kindled but their change of attitude. I highly recommend this series.

2221330,1,B0007N1BBC,"After watching several other period regency dramas and enjoying them very much, North & South was recommended to me by someone.  Naturally, all the rave reviews led me to look forward to this mini-series with great anticipation.  Now, after watching it, I cannot for the life of me understand all the fawning over this awfully flawed story and awkward production.

In all honesty, I struggled to get through even the first hour of this four-hour series.  That's because the biggest problem with this story is evident almost immediately, and it's the heroine, Margaret Hale.  This story suffers from committing one of the fatal errors in fiction storytelling, creating a ""Mary Sue"" for the protagonist.  Margaret Hale is perfect in every way.  She always stands up for what's right, never makes a mistake or does anything wrong, is virtuous beyond reproach, is always offering her moral opinions, a loyal and loving daughter, feeds starving peasants, takes care baskets to the ill, pleads on behalf of the disadvantaged...  You get the picture.  In short, she suffering from terminal ""loveliness"".  I had to grit my teeth each time the camera shot an extreme close-up of her empathic eyes gazing into the distance.  This is no fault of the actress.  It's the way the character of Margaret is written.  With absolutely no flaws, her character comes off as completely unrealistic and unsympathetic.  It was the brooding John Thornton and his cold, stern mother that the viewer ultimately sympathizes with and can relate.  These are multi-dimensional characters with conflicted priorities, feelings and struggles, and the viewer certainly feels that.  With Margaret, she's already perfect, therefore, her character has no development arch.  There's nothing for her to learn and nowhere for her grow as a person.  Because of that, her character has a very static and unrealistic feel, like a cardboard cutout.  When not spreading goodwill and cheer everywhere, she comes off as impetuous and self-righteous, always pointing out other people's flaws and telling them how they should be running their lives.  I haven't seen such an unlikable character in many years.

This is why there's absolutely no energy to any scene she's in and zero chemistry between her and John Thornton.  In what's essentially a love story, the lovers' feelings for each other should be made apparent to create tension against the forces that are trying to keep them apart.  That doesn't happen here and therefore, tension and suspense don't happen either.  This so-called love story falls very flat with no energy.  That's because Miss independent, prim and proper, always perfect Margaret shows absolutely NO, ZERO, NONE WHATSOEVER regard for John Thornton--not a tear or batted eye--for the first three hours and 50 minutes of this production.  She makes it VERY clear that she couldn't care less about him.  It's only in the final 10 minutes that she returns his affections with, of course, absolutely no explanation as to what caused her change of heart.  Naturally, this highly contrived moment only adds more implausibility to this unconvincing, poorly written, maudlin melodrama.

The other big problem here are all the implausibilities and coincidences in the story itself.  The reason given for Margaret's father leaving his parish and taking the family to Milton is beyond miniscule and would never justify such an action.  He might as well have said, ""Oh, I just felt like moving my family from the idyllic countryside to the wretched industrial city of Milton because it sounded like a good idea.""  I actually felt the same way his wife did when he told her he'd quit his job and that the family was moving.  She says in the film, ""You gave up everything on a formality?!""  My sentiments exactly.  She didn't believe it; neither will you.

With regard to coincidences, I've never been to Milton, but the city must only be about four square blocks.  That's because people just so happen to run into each other over and over again to see things at the most opportune times...all because the author couldn't think of a better way to reveal information and to keep the barely-there plot moving.

On the flipside, Richard Armitage as John Thornton is excellent.  Whenever he's on screen, you can't take your eyes off him.  When he's not, the film becomes inert.  Skip this and watch something really great with realistic characters and a fantastic plot like BBC's 2009 Sense & Sensibility or the 2005 Bleak House.",1452902400,7,4491,5.039348710990502

Its manly about Mr. Thornton that owns a cotton factory and he runs it with pride and he don't like people that slacks off on the job or making hard for people and kids to work their. This is how he is . NO CRAP ATTITUDE.
Ms. Hale she lived in the South all her life than her father packs the family up and moved to the North. Ms. Hales meets Mr. Thornton over disagreement over the house her father wanted to rent out while they where their. But the men they didn't want to talk to her because she was a woman. However they meet over a worker smoking in the factory by Mr. Thornton Ms, Hale didn't like how handled it .
As the story goes she grows somewhat fun of Mr. Thornton but she keeps her distance from him, but she couldn't help her self . A riot was breaking out at the factory she shows up wanting a wooden bed for her mother . the people came hitting on the door she made Mr. Thornton go outside to talk to them but she notice one of the protesters was picking up a rock and goes side tried to reason with them.

2221340,5,B0007N1BBC,"I had viewed this movie a couple of years ago and forgot all about it.  I just got done watching it again and I can't believe how great it is.  I've been re-watching it constantly because I can't get enough of it.  The viewer really got an inside look into the compelling and disparate attitudes that John Thornton and Margaret Hale had and how it caused strife between them for a long time.  John was good at giving a reasonable explanation for his actions and he was hard but honest in his dealings with his employees.  John had a lot of financial stressors on him in trying to keep the mill running and you could see the tension in his face.  I found his sister, Fanny, to be quite amusing at times.  The Higgins family added a nice contrast to the upper class life of the Thornton family.  The ending is highly romantic and touching but incomplete for me.  I wanted to see John ask Margaret to marry him again and to see what his mother's reaction would be upon their return home after she hears their news.  But, aside from that, it was one fantastic movie.  I wish today's writers and publishers would emphasize a full bodied story with strong characterizations like this movie had and hold off on the sex until the end, although there was no sex in this movie at all and the lack made it all the better.  The kissing scene was so tender and poignant and far better than the overly aggressive kissing and groping scenes of today's cinema.  John showed his respect and love for Margaret by his tender kissing and I'd like to see more tenderness in the romance novels.  I'm going to be watching this movie over and over again for quite a long while before I get my fill of it.",1448582400,16,1680,4.360128617363344

2221362,5,B0007N1BBC,"Having read the book, I was surprised that the beginning was changed a lot. However, I feel like the BBC adaptation added its own spin to it that worked well. The two meet when Mr. Thornton violently attacks one of his workers, who is caught smoking in the mills. If it were to catch fire, the whole thing would go down. Of course, Margaret doesn't realize this, and she goes after Mr. Thornton in order to stop him. And from then on, their meetings progressively get more awkward, conflicting and tension filled.

A huge round of applause goes to all the actors, especially Richard Armitage and Daniela Denby-Ashe, the two leading roles. The story was very well done and matched the book closely, though liberties were taken, as expected. The commentaries regarding masters and hands, strikes, social class, gender roles and death are in here just as in the book. And the chemistry between Mr. Thornton and Miss Hale is present. I could feel the chemistry as these two glanced at each other or shook hands or argued.

The proposal scene was worded differently but still left an impact, and I'm not sure which proposal I liked better, the book or the adaptations.

If you're looking for a period drama, this is something you need to check out, especially considering how strangely unheard of this is. I had never heard of North and South before. If you liked Pride and Prejudice, you will most definitely like North and South.",1441411200,25,1426,4.718875502008032

2221367,2,B0007N1BBC,"Many things just don't add up.

The male lead is portrayed as too cruel and harsh to be lovable beyond his good looks and passionate stares. They try to make him dynamic by him yelling things like, 'you think I enjoy watching my workers starve!?' and similar sentiments that are somehow suppose to convey that he secretly cares, yet he takes no action to do anything for the benefit of his workers. The logic of his compassion is so thin that you just can't fall for it unless you just blindly ignore it for the sake of his handsomeness. The female lead is also annoyingly one note. She spends way too much time starring into the distance squinting her eyes and parting her lips. Yes, she's beautiful, but the close ups of her beautiful face are not enough to carry her character through the whole miniseries.

Also a problem was that quite often you could not understand the dialogue. I had a particularly hard time understanding the lead males mother. It was like she couldn't enunciate properly. And all of his family had different accents which was odd.

Regarding the scenery, I understand that they were trying to convey dark and dreary but the coloring was so monotone at times it made all the scenes blend together.

You just really don't care about any of the characters that much. I think the people that like this film so much were just dying for another go around of pride and prejudice push and pull type romance. But the two main characters are so unpleasant to each other so regularly that why you want to see them together at the end is beyond me.

I sometimes wonder if it is because women are treated so poorly by men so regularly that it becomes a fantasy that secretly the disrespect and coldness they are shown are really just the secret hidden passion of broken men. And that is a bit sad.",1440374400,2,1811,4.509146341463414

Which means that to view it properly, the best solution would be to either buy a Region free DVD player or to download a free software called VLC player. A wonderful software which has allowed me to view on my computer or laptop movies from all over the world.

It was only last year that I heard of this series BBC produced and broadcasted in 2004. An adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's novel North and South, which was edited under the hand of Charles Dickens, this story offers another take at the ""Conflicting point of views falling in love"" concept the novel ""Pride and Prejudice"" made so popular. So it was last September that I took the time in watching these four episodes, loving them, though I never took the time in reviewing them until now.

Occurring in the 1850s in a large city called Milton (shot in Edinburgh for the sake of the series), North and South is the story of Margaret Hale who, with her family, has moved from the South of England into this northern city due to various conflicts their family has experienced. First, a question of belief involving her father's religious work, the other an incident which her brother Frederick has experienced years ago, and which has always been boiling up for years due to its legal context and has stained their reputation.
Therefore, it is through a very heavy and tense climate that Margaret has to adjust herself to another view of life and reality. That of the social fights between employees of cotton factories and their bosses. Poverty versus comfort, rights versus profit, life versus death. A chance for Miss Hale to reconsider what her London education has made her take for granted. While encountering the intransigent John Thronton, one of her father's students and the owner of the Mallborough Mills, who soon falls in love with her.

Now for romantic stories, each must have a perfect cast. One with the right talent and chemistry to work between each actor. If not the adaptation will become a catastrophe. So as the production notes revealed, the production crew did numerous readings, eventually falling on what I think is the best casting. First, Daniela Denby-Ashe as the headstrong, but compassionate Ms. Hale, and two, Richard Armitage as the hot-tempered but very intelligent John Thornton. A latter casting that made such an impression on viewers that the message boards for the BBC went down due to the enormous dialogue over Richard Armitage's charismatic presence.
Which I quite agree as he exhibits a sex appeal, an empathy, and a human factor that add layers to John Thornton. That make us hope he and Ms. Hale will get their happy ending, but also learn from one another. Especially when during one episode, Thornton and Hale confront a massive riot at the factory and one can feel the tension each has for another. And with the end of that particular episode, things take a new turn between them.

Now as for the rest of the cast I found it as excellent as the two main actors. Everyone had the right energy for their roles and I didn't feel any performance dragging or hurting the series. Why, it was even a pleasure to see Anna Maxwell Martin and Brendan Coyle before doing their most popular series (For the former, the perfect Bleak House with Gillian Anderson, and for the latter, the popular Downton Abbey). And with the success ""North and South"" had, it is evident this recognition influenced their careers' progression, including Brian Percival who ended up working again with Brendan Coyle on Downton Abbey. However, I need to mention the wonderful soundtrack Martin Phipps has composed. Its tunes are memorable, stay with you after the viewing, and are perfectly used in the series as important events occur between Hale and Thornton. Indeed, this soundtrack was a pleasure to listen to, unlike Nicolette Sheridan's and Greg Wise's ""Honeymoon for One"", a Hallmark production which had, from the first frame to the last, a deafening soundtrack that suffocated and killed their movie. Therefore, I wish that the BBC could release on CD or on MP3 (Itunes, etc.) North and South's soundtrack as I've seen people talking about it with praise and wishing to purchase it.

For its bonuses, we have a nice interview with Richard Armitage, deleted scenes, and production notes on the series' making. Nice treats for those who would want something their information on the series. On another note, we also have subtitles which can be quite useful for those with hearing issues or might have trouble understanding the northern accent from certain characters as apparently some people had issues understanding their words. By the way, it is nice to see BBC production taking the time to clearly present UK cultures rather than give a ""everyone-must-talk-with-a Londoner-accent"" by fear viewers won't understand the characters, which is a trait I've seen in certain French television series where everyone speak with Parisian accents, even in the countryside.
In conclusion, this series is the proof that an audience's good reception is the better judge than the press as it was the viewers who talked about it either on the Web or the street or at work, that gave North and South the success it got. And for that, I wish for BBC to re-release the series in Blu-Ray with even more bonuses. Such as one describing the series success's worldwide, another on the novel, on its author, or even on the production design.
The perfect continuation to a series that fuelled its actors' careers, its channel's dramas, and its original novel's recognition.",1438819200,2,5594,4.88421052631579

2221390,5,B0007N1BBC,"OMG. Yes, I need to say that. Let me also say that I just rented ""Pride & Prejudice"" with Cara Knightley and I had really had expectations because of all the rave, but the lead actor who plays ""Mr. Darby"" is terrible, it seems that he's an apprentice.
Perhaps not! I am sure if I had not seen ""North & South"" first my opinion would have been different, maybe....
Richard Armitage as ""Mr. Thornton"" forever raised the standards of acting, in such a complex character.
His role similar to Mr. Darcy is meant to be forceful, arrogant, mean, to inspire rejection from viewers but also complexity and then understanding. Matthew Macfadyen on Mr. Darby is fake, unreal, forced, obvious, empty.

The two leads and their chemistry are 100% believable - Richard Armitage manages to out-smoulder Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy by a landslide.  Daniela Denby-Ashe is the perfect mix of strong-willed and vulnerable/flawed.  They both are, and that's what makes their eventual turnaround gratifying in the extreme.  All the other supporting roles are beautifully cast and played as well.  Anna Maxwell-Martin, Brendan Coyle, and Sinead Cusack are all absolutely at the top of their game.  Music: totally effective and beautiful.  Cinematography and sets: fantastic, recreate the industrial ""Milton"" (read: Manchester) to a T.  This miniseries will suck you in and leave you completely elated at the end.  The story is complex, and pretty dark, but that's as Gaskell wrote it and the writer manages to inject moments of levity here and there, as well as showing some of the better sides of human nature, that shine like hidden gems in the dark and smoky streets of Milton.

Students of history and literature (Catherine Gaskell) will appreciate this movie.  It gave us an understanding of how the Industrial Revolution was truly a ""Revolution"" in Great Britain.  The class warfare between the north and south of England was so accurately and dramatically portrayed.  The story line was mesmerizing and kept us interested from the first minute until the last.  Every actor was carefully chosen and was outstanding in his or her part.  The passion and the tension and the emotions in this movie were profoundly moving.  My wife and I both cried during certain scenes.  Not little sniffles, but real tears as we were emotionally drawn into this.  And we never, or rarely ever shed a tear when watching a movie.  At the first of the movie, we wondered why they chose Daniela Denby-Ashe for the part, but as the movie progressed and her character developed, we realized that she was a brilliant choice.  My wife was totally carried away by Richard Armitage!  That man is a tremendously talented actor.  He can convey a wealth of emotion with just a facial expression or by the lift of an eyebrow.  The supporting cast all were spot on.  Brendan Coyle from ""Downton Abbey"" gave a wonderful performance, as did Anna Maxwell Martin and Sinead Cusack.  This is the best DVD we've bought in a long time and will be watching it many times.",1431043200,3,1527,4.8301158301158305

2221424,5,B0007N1BBC,"What a beautiful adaptation. I cant believe I have only discovered it now after a decade of its release. As many comparisons have been made between this glorious adaptation and that of the 1995 P&P, I stumbled across N&S on Netflix as I was googling period dramas to stream after viewing Firth and Ehle for the umpteenth time. I was a little skeptical at first, reading all the positive reviews for N&S, considering P&P has held a long standing place in my heart. I gave N&S a go. Wow. It has replaced P&P. Period. Thinking I would simply watch one episode, I started my viewing around midnight; I finished the series just as the sun was beginning to rise.

The entire adaptation was beautifully made; casting, cinematography, soundtrack. I was made speechless during several scenes- namely, when Margaret first opened the door to the mill; the proposal scene; Thornton uttering his look back at me line; and of course, the ending. The train theme was brilliantly and creatively executed. Sandy Welch replaced Andrew Davies as one of the best screen writers for period dramas.

Since viewing the series on Netflix, Ive purchased the DVD so that I could watch all the commentary and special features, and Ive read the book. The Netflix version is slightly different, having excluded some scenes to fit production timeslot. Owning the DVD is worth these extra scenes. The adaptation does an excellent job of translating the books themes; however, it does not follow the story line exactly as compared to the 1995 P&P. In some regards, this translation is even better than what the book conveys. For example, given that the book was published in a serialized format, some of the story line pacing is not aligned with what we expect: deaths occur in such rapid succession in the book, and other key elements (i.e Thornton discovering the identity of the late-night train character) are drawn out. The adaptation is able to pace these. It is helpful, however, to read the book and understand the inner thoughts of characters (especially the expressions crafted by the lovely and talented Richard Armitage).

It is a shame that N&S is not as widely known as P&P. Martin Phipps is also a genius with the soundtrack. Comparatively, it has replaced the 2005 P&P soundtrack as a piece of moving lyrical work in period adaptations. There is just something so heart wrenching listening to Thornton/Margarets motif, repeated at key moments of their interactions.

If you are still deciding whether to view this mini-series, I can assure you that the 4 hours you spend will be time well spent. I am sad that I will never have the opportunity to experience the magic that occurs during the first viewing of this series. I hope that you will.",1428883200,4,2726,4.843347639484978

2221428,3,B0007N1BBC,"This adaptation is a wonderful production with tremendous acting.  Had I watched it a few months from now, having forgotten character subtleties and motivations, I probably would have been among the five star rankings.  I was excited to watch this, being a huge fan of the earlier ""Pride and Prejudice,""  which could almost be watched with the book open in front of you.  Having heard such high praise of this as a faithful adaptation, I expected the same.  Instead, I shut it off in frustration halfway through episode two and I'll watch the rest in a few months.

The rushed beginning threw me off, but it's a long book-- I assume with an adaptation there will be cuts and that was judicious.  I started to sour, however, when Mr. Hale began to explain why he left the church.  It made his motivation one of silly stubbornness rather than deep conviction that began an emotional unraveling that ultimately leads to his demise.  This misunderstanding of the novel's characters impacted almost all of them, from Mr. Thornton's introduction to the violent revolutionary Nicholas, to the intentionally rude and catty Miss Hale.  There were numerous vignettes that did not occur in the book, all of which made caricatures of rich, multi-dimensional characters.

Hopefully with some distance from the book, I'll be able to enjoy the wonderful action and perfect production value.  Or at least be able to accept it like the Kiera Knightly version of ""Pride and Prejudice""-- that is, an audience friendly, superficially accurate version of a phenomenal book.",1427587200,3,1552,4.996108949416342
2221429,5,B0007N1BBC,"North & South is one of my favorite BBC costume dramas. The story is based on a novel by Elizabeth Gaskell, whose stories tend to feature strong independent women. The story is set in England's industrial north during the 1850s. Gaskell based the city on Manchester, where she lived as the wife of a Unitarian minister. Like Charles Dickens, Gaskell had a social conscience. During the 19th century, Manchester was transformed by the Industrial Revolution. It was a hot-bed of new technology, Manchester built the first modern railway. Although Britain was the richest country in the world during the 1850s, its northern cities were grim, polluted places with dreadful slums. Manchester was the center of England's cotton industry and was dubbed ""Cottonopolis"".

The hero is John Thornton (Richard Armitage) a self-made mill-owner, who initially appears to be an aloof and brutal tyrant (Mr. Darcy with a Northern accent). The heroine is Margaret Hale (Daniela Denby-Ashe) a clergyman's daughter from Hampshire  who finds it difficult to fit into Northern society. Hampshire is in the South and was never industrialized. Hale is a genteel young lady and is often shocked by her new surroundings. Her family does not have a lot of money and they seem out of place amongst the Northern nouveau riche. She befriends the family of a union leader and this causes controversy, especially when she speaks her mind about the working conditions in the mills.

Miss Hale initially dislikes Thornton but she grows to appreciate his good qualities. There are some misunderstandings before the inevitable romantic happy-ending. The BBC is very good at this sort of thing. The story is well told with excellent acting. I bought the DVD as a present for my wife and we were both gripped immediately. We watched the whole thing in one sitting - all four hours. A great series, highly recommended.",1427500800,2,1880,5.058064516129032

2221433,5,B0007N1BBC,"IMO, this is THE best romantic period drama in existence.  Not the only one (there are many great ones, to be sure) but N&S is absolutely fantastic!  The plot is wonderful and complex without being overly ""twisty"".  It's also very respectful and frank about it's time - early  unionizing (without vilifying either side) and showing the intense hardships of that era.  It's a wonderfully thoughtful romance - not sappy, silly, or flippant.  The love story is center stage, of course - but it's a slow ""burn"" (the best kind, I suppose).  The casting is absolutely perfect - each character represented beautifully.  Denby-ashe and Armitage have great chemistry and tension - and Mr. Armitage nails the tricky balance of intelligence, brooding, stoicism, principle, and passion (much like Matthew MacFayden in Pride and Prejudice and Toby Stephens in Jane Eyre).

I especially love Mr. Higgins and Mrs. Thornton-- aside from my main favorites Margaret and John of course. Richard Armitage just makes you melt in this role and Daniela Denby-Ashe is magnificent as Margaret-- she portrays her spirit and determination as well as her vulnerabilities and softness. I can't say enough good about this. The deleted scenes- especially the extended proposal scene are great too. I also love that this includes scenes that are not on the Netflix version.

He totally nailed this character to me, and the other actors are wonderful as well. I'm usually not one for romantic films, but the drama and the chemistry between the two leads was phenomenal.

Mr. Armitage will be playing a serial killer on the show ""Hannibal"" but I'd love to see him play more romantic leads!",1421884800,,565,4.957446808510638

2221495,5,B0007N1BBC,"North and South is an excellent dramatization, and, in my opinion, the best work BBC has ever done in period drama. It is based off Elizabeth Cleghorn Gaskells romantic novel, which I read after I watched the film, and this is what I think:
The book is not half as good as this film.
I dogmatically believe that.

  Daniela Denby-Ashe and Richard Armitage are both brilliant, aesthetic performers and act out the main characters, Margaret Hale and John Thornton, faultlessly.
  The story is entertaining and worth watching seven times, which, of course, anyone who watches it will do. It is unavoidable.

I loved this film.",1420675200,,623,4.885714285714286

This is a great love story, a depiction of issues with the industrial growth and worker's lives, view into the different social classes, and a period piece built around England's industrial north. The cast is superb, but our favorites include Anna Maxwell Martin (Bessy Higgins) and Richard Armitage (John Thornton).

The supporting cast is just superb and Downton Abby fans will be thrilled to see Mr. Bates, the fabulous Brendan Coyle, in a major and fiery role as a union organizer who bedevils John Thornton's haughty mill owner with his strikes and work stoppages. There are many familiar faces here that American audiences and PBS viewers will recognize immediately.
The grey and gloomy atmosphere of a Victorian mill town is perfectly captured and you keep rooting for Thornton, even though he is flawed.
 Richard Armitage fans will love this, as well as all those who enjoy English period dramas.",1419984000,,813,4.83453237410072

I love P&P and this romance has some similar obstacles to overcome.  I think the review said they are alike because North and South gives you the same feeling of complete satisfaction as P&P1996.  Well casted and acted. Plus a great musical score.  I was wonderfully shell shocked first time I saw it.  I couldn't believe it was that good.

Spinners didn't have altogether long and fruitful lives what with working & living conditions.  The story of the two head-strong, mostly independent lead characters carried the series along.

2221632,5,B0007N1BBC,"Love, love this series! It had been on Netflix forever, and I thought it was the Civil War film. I read somewhere that Thornton is like Darcy from Pride and Prejudice, and wanted to see it.

This is much better than the Pride & Prejudice movie, if you're looking for romance. The train scene at the end is the most anticipated, and the best romantic scene I have watched. The scene makes your heart flutter and fall more in love with Thornton and Richard Armitage.

Highly recommend it.",1416614400,,486,4.511363636363637
2221633,5,B0007N1BBC,"I chanced upon North and South from my Netflix's suggested list.  I was not prepared but I clicked to watch it anyway. I was wary, in the first 10 minutes, of another BBC melodrama until the scene where Margaret's first meeting with Mr. Thornton inside the mill. Needless to say, I was mesmerized and could not sleep until I finished the four episodes in the wee hours. Truly, BBC's 2004 production of North and South ranks as first in my period drama list.

I'm also an avid fan, like millions of people like me, of Jane Austen's novels.  I treasure her Pride and Prejudice (P&P) and its 1996's production for ages.  However, I think my feelings for North and South are much stronger.  Richard Armitage's portrayal of the protagonist, Mr. Thornton, is incredibly relatable and enthralling. He could be despicably ruthless but could also be vulnerable.  I also like the fact that Margaret Hale is not played by a perfect beauty, let's say a Rosamund Pike or a Felicity Jones, but by Daniela Denby-Ashe.  Daniela's  drab clothes and severe hair styles illuminate brighter the sensitive expression of her eyes and the anguish in her shivering lips.  The world of Austen in P&P seem to encompass pretty gentlemen and ladies , the pursuits of good catch among the gentry, the perfect comedy of manners play in parlors, manors and grand estates. Her main preoccupation was the domestic drama and omitted the shocks of the Napoleonic war, only referenced in her description of the colorfully uniformed  militias.  In contrast, North and South drills through the assaults of industrialization, the squalid conditions of the poor,  the callous rise of the newly rich,  the class war in the struggle of the means of production. The realism and the stuffs that mobilize societal change.

One of the hallmarks of North and South is the incredible production set.  How disgusting really is the look of Margaret's working class neighborhood of chicken being slaughtered and pig carcasses scattered along the streets?  The poor in Princeton's Street where the Bouchers and Higgins live is awashed with dirt and dilapidated makeshift houses. Milton is filtered in depressing gray, the air is smog, you could inhale the pollutants.  The scene when Margaret entered the mill with thousands of cotton fluffs were floating and where faceless workers move the engines in hypnotic motion in contrast with the real frantic rhythm of production.  Margaret writes, ""I have seen hell. And it is white, white as snow.""  Martin Phipps' music invokes the haunting and longing ache of Thornton's and the desperate feelings of the Hales' being stranded in a place like Milton. The coda at the Northbound Station is more haunting than any coda I have heard before.  In my estimation, Phipps superb music surpasses P&P 1996, but second only to Dario Marianelli's score of the 2005 Joe Wrights' production of P&P.

Richard Armitage's smoldering eyes did it for me but most of all, the story lines resonate much more to my sensibilities.  It calls the realities of lives in the turbulent times of the industrial revolution and the harsh societal and class struggles.  The realism of that age does not mar it as a vehicle for us to escape the drudgery of our everyday lives. Either thinking of meeting your company's sale goal, finishing a thesis paper, doing your laundry in between yard work,  North and South allows us to see ourselves in a different world.  In our time of internet dating and quick hook-ups, the sexual tension of propriety of the Victorian era trumps all in making our hearts beat and our heads spin faster when it comes to the affairs of the heart.  And yes, the kiss at the end is the best I have ever seen!",1416614400,4,3696,4.8548644338118025

2221639,5,B0007N1BBC,"""It's difficult to find the words..."" North and South is completely riveting throughout; actors, sets, scores, and costumes combine to deliver you with this classical romance. And, it may be classical but delivered to us, a contemporary audience, with dramatization in ever scene and relationship. The tale evokes a deep understanding of the era and location, but also the central couple, Margaret Hale and John Thornton, with intense or subtle interactions that resonate with the audience. Daniela Denby-Ashe gave a capturing performance full of innocence, shock, denial, and grief; the two main leads (Armitage and Denby-Ashe) have great chemistry with each other and the rest of the cast. Also, the acting is stunning and I won't be surprised if more and more people watch this as the years pass, reflecting on how amazingly some of the cast has continued; the movements, tones, facial expressions, and emotional reflections are phenomenal!

  Stunningly, the story gives you two deep and developing characters through Margaret and John, which is hard to find because usually we only see the female perspective(I thoroughly enjoyed seeing Thornton as whole character). Truly, this building tension-filled attraction is engaging through the characters mistakes, assumptions, misunderstandings, or denials. The ability for our two protagonists to finally understand the beauty in each other and people in general, whether from the industrialized North or slow-paced South, is profound. And, the last scene with the Northbound Train is so consuming with the dialogue moving over for these transfixing actors to grasp the audience and the heavenly score to capture the mind. Honestly, the best romance I have ever seen or probably will see!

""It's difficult to find the words"" is a phrase Thornton says, but Margaret catches herself repeating(Or rather ""I cannot find the words""- she finds herself parallel to Thornton's thinking). It is just one of many phrases, looks, or actions that make you laugh at or ache for these characters. Darcy who anyone?
This show is a hidden treasure! So, spread the word! (Suggested to read the book, it's amazingly refreshing thank you!)",1416355200,4,2171,5.3391812865497075

All of the performances are very good and the Margaret Hale character shows female independence during a time period when this went against the grain in society.  Margaret stays the course and John Thornton begins to soften as a mill owner improving hi character.  Brendan Coyle (Bates from Downton Abbey) plays Nicholas Higgins and idealistic mill worker with a big heart.

2221755,5,B0007N1BBC,North and South is the story of contrasts: Northern English mill town vs Southern English countryside vs London society; business owner vs union labor; achieving goals through kindness and honesty vs achieving goals with disregard for the human spirit. The main characters all learn to understand and accept points of view different from their own. Nicely articulated. Brendan Coyle from Downton Abbey plays the leader of the union strike.,1410998400,,439,5.3768115942028984

2221768,4,B0007N1BBC,"This is a beautifully played version of one of the most enthralling novels I have ever read, Elizabeth Gaskell's North and South.  All roles, both primary and supporting, were spot-on realizations of their characters as written for the screen and magnificently delivered.  Although I hesitate to make distinctions among the uniformly appealing cast, I found Anna Maxwell Martin's Bessy brilliant, compelling, and, if it's not an oxymoron to say so, breathtakingly understated.  At times I could not make out Richard Armitage's words (as John Thornton), but his face said what I could not hear, and other reviewers do not mention the problem.

I did have some difficulty with the translation from text to screen, not because I was looking for a faithful rendering, but because I felt some of the changes did the screen version a disservice.  I mention these next, giving a ***SPOILER ALERT*** for those who do not know the story:

In the movie, the meeting of Margaret Hale and John Thornton is changed from the drawing room to the factory, where Thornton roughs up and fires a worker for smoking.  Although his motives are depicted as worthy--the safety of everyone else--physical violence is not in the character as developed either in the book or on screen.  More integrally, Gaskell's scene in the drawing room provides a more apposite premise to the early stages of Margaret and Thornton's relationship than the factory scene does.  As Gaskell depicts the situation, these two cannot communicate with one another--about mere trifles.  To have instead Margaret's outrage at Thornton's treatment of his workers at the factory is heavy-handed, especially when her noncomprehension of his positions and policies can be easily shown in other ways, as Gaskell demonstrates.

The movie evidently opted to eliminate the dialect in which Gaskell had the working class characters speak.  I think retention of at least some dialect would have helped to accentuate the class divide and portray it as it existed, as well as to highlight the openness of the characters on both its sides to reaching across it.

The movie's final scene is again changed for the worse from the book. ***SPOILERS*** In the book, Margaret and Thornton meet again at a dinner party that segues two days later to a private meeting in a closed study, where all comes clear and their feelings for one another are gently and humorously acknowledged.  In the movie, they meet, improbably, at a railway station during the simultaneous (!) stopovers of trains traveling in opposite directions, each character coming from a simultaneous (!) visit to the place associated with the other one.  Then, although it's the 1850s, they kiss publicly on a bench--about which another reviewer has commented.  The story doesn't need the contrivance.  Line by line, Gaskell's quiet ending brings tale where it needs to be, providing the natural next step of what has been developing all along, such that the reader can imagine the contented life these two will lead together.  The movie's end was less well prepared, in addition to being contrived, and as it faded I imagined the discord between the two continuing after the honeymoon.",1410048000,2,3183,5.076775431861805

2221815,5,B0007N1BBC,"The best endorsement I can give this serial is that I chose it on a whim on Netflix (I love British period pieces) and watched the whole series that same night. Each time I started the next episode, I said, ""Okay, this is the last one,"" but by the time it had ended, I decided to watch the next one. Then I watched the whole series AGAIN the NEXT DAY. I am also interested in reading the novel on which it is based.

It seems to be true that I can watch Richard Armitage's wonderful, wonderful scowl for hours on end....... :) His smile is not so bad, either, especially the scarcity of it in this series. To see him go from being so stiff, gruff, and cold to having rare, missed or misinterpreted (by Margaret) moments of softness/kindness, to him completely softening by the end of the series was fascinating to watch.

Films and series like this have such a huge payoff for me in ways that modern based films/modern stories do not. Nowadays, with modern stories, it's a rare thing (in the West) to have two people slowly fall in love and grow to know/understand each other, overcome obstacles of circumstance and character, in particular without having so much as shared a kiss beforehand. I can stay more interested in a story like this (and have omgee! moments) than the paint-by-numbers stories that say ""characters meet, then jump into bed, then start fighting, break up, then get back together again."" I guess that's why I love a lot of Asian love stories (including anime), as well as classic Hollywood films, and British period pieces. If you're looking for a meaningful love story, this is one to watch.",1407715200,2,1614,4.581314878892734

2221891,5,B0007N1BBC,"I love period drama, especially English period drama, and this is one of my top 3! An excellent story with all the conflict, misjudgment, slow realization, forgiveness, worry of loss, and reconciliation of a great period drama romance. I really enjoy Austen and always will, but the greater depth of this story makes it more meaty and realistic. There are great losses - death of loved ones, serious conflicts with injury, and greater reality portrayed of the difference between economic classes of 19th century England. The unionization of workers vs the manufacturing business owners is very gritty and real. It clearly depicts how difficult that time was for England's history, and is a great lesson for us as well, learning to work together, seeing both sides, and finding solutions. And the romance? Unforgettable! The cast is superb and Richard Armitage gives the role the intensity, thoughtfulness and simmering vulnerability that makes the character of Mr. John Thorton irresistible. And I digress, but his deep bass voice is... well it's... it's um.... okay, I could listen to it all day. And he's easy on the eyes as well.

The real measure of this picture comes, however, from my experience with my mother. She had watch an Austen movie with me and was, shame on her, but she was bored. I loved it, of course, but she doesn't enjoy watching something that is, in her words, too fluffy. Though I disagree that Austen is too 'fluffy', I will admit that they rarely address real suffering of societies with any sufficient depth. So I was careful about inviting my mother to watch any period drama with me. North & South, however, was different and I thought I might brave her opinion once again, knowing I'd probably not get the result I hoped for, but still I was not deterred. She agreed with apprehension, but with lots of time and a crochet project to complete, she watched. I tried to read her reactions throughout the first two hours, but her face remained the same expression of concentration on her crochet project. At the 2 hour half-way point it was late and she needed to go to bed. The next evening I asked if she wanted to finish the next 2 hours, not sure she would, and she enthusiastically answered, she would! I asked if she liked it? And she said it was very good and she needed to see all of it. FINALLY, I'd found a period drama my mother and I enjoyed together!!!

If you love period drama, it's one of the best! PG rated material and a story with serious subject matter and depth. It's not as heavy as Dickens, but not as light as Austen. I love 'em all, but this is just the right mix!",1404777600,4,2616,4.623655913978495

2221908,5,B0007N1BBC,"I have watched this mini series 4 times and will watch it many, many more.  Richard Armitage is so good in portraying his
character and makes you love him even though he starts out as such a hard and unforgiving man.  This is a beautiful period
piece and takes place in the 1850's, I believe.  It's a clash of cultures between John Thornton and Margaret Hale, he being
from the North and attempting to keep his cotton mill running and she from the prim and proper South.  I don't want to say
anything about this series because I think one needs to just watch it.  It's probably more for women than men, but one never
knows.  My favorite movies are 2 romantic period pieces and were #1 and #2 on my list, ""Pride and Prejudice"" and ""Sense
and Sensibility"" BUT they are now #2 and #3 because North and South has now moved into the #1 position!!!!",1404000000,5,843,4.337579617834395

2221921,5,B0007N1BBC,"As a recent Pinterest post put it, ""I [Mr. Darcy] invented the smoulder; and I [Mr Thornton] perfected it."" Indeed. Richard Armitage smoulders magnificently as John Thorton in a well-done look at factory life in 19th-century northern England. Brendon Coyle is his usual excellent self as a factory worker intent on striking. Many fine, familiar British actors enhance this film version of Elizabeth Gaskell's novel. Oddly enough, I found the leading lady to be one of the weaker performances, but it is not a poor performance. But it's worth watching if only to get to episode 4 and hear Mr. Thornton plaintively utter,""look back at me.""...(you have to watch to see why!)",1403568000,,671,5.0

2221943,5,B0007N1BBC,"Superbly written (even though Ms. Welch finds it necessary to give Mr. Thornton another love interest), directed, acted, and designed. The time flies by while watching it. The final train station scene, despite not being in the novel, is one of my favorites in television. And the score is fantastic. There is simply a lot to love and admire with NORTH AND SOUTH. Highly recommended.",1402358400,2,383,4.907692307692308
2221944,4,B0007N1BBC,"This is a very good adaption of the book North and South by Elizabeth Gaskell. I really enjoyed it, and all the actors were wonderful. The only complaint I have is that I felt Mr. Thornton should not have been made so harsh. He's very intense in the book, but he didn't beat anyone up. (A worker had lit a pipe in the factory, which was extremely dangerous, and Thornton over reacted). Other than that, I really enjoyed it, although I like the book better.",1402099200,,456,4.376470588235295
2221945,4,B0007N1BBC,"The series itself is well done, but I am amazed (not) how able to ignore the foundation of British wealth, slavery in the United States and Caribbean, these stories are. Yes these workers had it hard, but try being a slave, working for nothing and still starving too. It's a nice fantasy.",1402099200,,288,4.5576923076923075

2221949,5,B0007N1BBC,"I watched this series as the result of a recommendation that I might see a different side of Mr. Armitage's acting. What I discovered was a richly developed BBC series that has captivated me and a number of my friends. Daniela Denby-Ashe is absolutely beautiful. She perfectly plays the part of an intelligent young woman living a life where intelligence and involvement in the ""real world"" were neither wanted nor appreciated. She is caught between so many conflicts and struggles more within herself than with others as she lives strives to balance her strong opinions and ideals with characters firmly rooted in the standards of society. This was my first encounter with Sinead Cusack. I was quite impressed with her role as Mrs. Thornton. How stiff and unyielding, yet how kind beneath that tough, protective exterior. Mr. Armitage was as brooding and complex a character as I've seen in ages. He and Ms. Denby-Ashe can portray more character with a slight twitch of the mouth or a sharp glance than most actors I've ever seen. This is an excellent period piece and one I expect to watch again and again.",1401840000,5,1108,4.836842105263158

2221951,5,B0007N1BBC,"I love NORTH AND SOUTH.  I love the book and I love this video version of it.  The story is in some ways similar to PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, except NORTH AND SOUTH is a far more serious tale with more depth and with a greater overall message.

This mini-series version is mostly faithful to the original story, but if you have time, you should read the book first before you watch the movie.  There is so much in the book that enriches the movie, and the love story will be SO much more emotionally satisfying when you get the details of how much Margaret really endured during her 18 months in Milton.  Usually people who know and love a book are disappointed when they see a film version, but not here.  While a cinematic productions always has it's little deviations, this particular one is so absolutely faithful the the spirit and intent of the book that there was nothing that left me feeling unfulfilled when I saw it.  Still, I think that having read the book made me appreciate the movie more than if I didn't already know the story.

The end of this movie version is somewhat changed - the story itself has not been altered, but the setting has been changed to enhance the romance of the end.  Usually, I am a purist and hate when moviemakers deviate even a little bit from a book that I love, however, I have to say that this is one of the VERY RARE cinematic alterations that actually improves on the original by enhancing the original story without changing the outcome.

I could go on and on about how well this movie was cast (nailing the spirit of the characters in a way that I seldom see onscreen), the first rate acting (from the most incidental extra all the way up to the lead parts), the great directing, lush scenery, costumes, musical score, and reasonably accurate screenplay.  But if I go on and on, you will have less time to enjoy this  masterpiece.

SO.  If you are a sucker for intensely moving romance, with more depth than is ordinary, then you will love NORTH AND SOUTH.  This production is spot on and is great all on it's own, but for maximum enjoyment I recommend that you read the book before enjoying the movie.",1401667200,5,2145,4.436224489795919
2221952,5,B0007N1BBC,Thoroughly enjoyable series which prompted me to read Elizabeth Gaskell's novel on which it is based.  This series has a much more satisfying and thrilling ending than the novel.,1401667200,,178,5.137931034482759

2221956,5,B0007N1BBC,"Ok, add me to the list of folks in line to be a huge fan of Richard Armitage! This is truly one of the best, if not THE best, series I've seen to date. I initially ordered this for my Kindle; but when I got the DVD for a separate device, I discovered a number of additional scenes, as well as ""special features"" that I really enjoyed.

I read a previous review by someone who pointed out that the Margaret Hale character is one of the few who was never portrayed in a sexist way, or treated as ""less than"" in any scenes. So true. Her character again and again spoke her mind; and then she lived with the results. And the results were not the typical slap-in-your-face or insulting to your intelligence. Her life and how she lived was thoughtful and real. (well, as real as a period drama gets)

This series honestly presents the many conflicts of industry vs. social concerns. That they did it in a love story made it quite genuine and touching. As grownups, we know that everything is a shade of grey--or we do if we've experienced any kind of tragedy in our lives. To see that same shading in a costume drama is so wonderful. So many things presented as entertainment today are stupid, vapid, misogynistic, and just garbage. It's wonderful to watch something that has realistic, complex characters respectfully and fully acted by talented folks...to get all that in a heartfelt romance is such a treat. I loved it.",1401408000,5,1416,4.505836575875486
2221957,5,B0007N1BBC,I loved this movie. It gives a great view of northern Industrial England.  People were intense. Story like was captivating,1401321600,,122,5.1
2221958,5,B0007N1BBC,"This is officially a favorite! A wonderful drama full of strong performances and brave social commentary.

Gorgeous, gorgeous story.",1401321600,2,286,5.239130434782608
2221959,5,B0007N1BBC,"Heck yes this met my expectations and exceeded them! I bought it because I'm in love with Richard Armitage and he is MAGNIFICENT in it. He outdid himself. And I really loved Daniella too. The whole cast was fantastic, especially Tim Piggot Smith and Sinead Cusack. It's a wonderful love story, a sad and poingant story about how much people suffer with poverty and a fantastic period piece. I really felt like I was in a  time machine living with these wonderful people. Even if you don't know anyone in the cast or don't normally like period piece I would watch it. The costumes were really well done, excellent script, really moving cinematography and a wonderfully happy ending. ADORED IT!!!",1401235200,4,694,4.783333333333333
2221960,5,B0007N1BBC,"Elizabeth Gaskell wrote some great English Victorian historical novels.  I loved the book Cranford and Wives and Daughters (though I loved the BBC versions better.)  I tried to read North and South, but found it a bit difficult to slough through..  I'm not sure how I missed this the first time it was on television, but I was so glad to see that it was on video and doubly glad to see that it was on Prime!  I think I've watched it once a month since Amazon put it up there for us.

This story has it all -- love, relationships, politics, history, the human condition.  Daniella Denby-Ashe and Richard Armitage were absolutely perfect in their roles, but I think that Sinead Cusack (Mrs. Jeremy Irons!) was stunning and really did a bunch of scene stealing.  Additional hats off to Brendan Coyle (Downton Abbey's enigmatic John Bates.)

Very highly recommended.",1401235200,,862,4.7

2221963,4,B0007N1BBC,"This series is quite similar to Pride and Prejudice in the sense that both Hero and Heroine discover the good qualities of the other over time and in both cases, each is forced to reverse their original judgments.

The setting of the Northern mill town embroiled in labor disputes and union battles only serves to make the romance more realistic and less self-important.

In Austen's classic tale, the supreme importance of society's opinion-even to the point of dictating matches-is replaced in North and South, by more practical measures. Status is seen not in terms of who's family is the oldest in the realm, but who's purse can sustain the many possible hits of an unpredictable market and labor strikes. In both the classic novel and this more realistic TV series, love triumphs over all other considerations. Very interesting to watch.",1401148800,,842,5.007142857142857

This one is one of my absolute favorites. It's a mini-series of I believe 4 episodes. Each one will leave you wanting more until the final scene (sigh). Not only does it have an outstanding story, but it also depicts how people adapted as industry began to take over in England.

Sometimes I need a little fix and go back to the final scene of episode 4 and watch it over again, only to want to restart the series over!

I read on a Darcy vs Thornton blog that people were calling Thonrton the poor/working man's Darcy  and I have to agree. While I will always love Mr. Darcy, John was a self-made man.

2222026,5,B0007N1BBC,"I've left comments about this mini-series under others' reviews, I watched it again and just had to leave my own rave review.  This review contains no spoilers.  FANTASTIC, so poignant, romantic, both heroine and hero WONDERFUL and complex (I originally watched it for free on Prime and immediately ordered the DVD).  It's not frothy, no comedy of manners, it's a drama, slower-moving but portent with meaning, existential, life or death issues, the tension between values in southern and northern England, and those of the moneyed vs the working class.  Also about the love within families, between friends, within our human family, just wonderful.

I loved it SO much I downloaded the kindle version of the book (published 1854) by Elizabeth Gaskell, which, although very different, I also adored.  Sort of like Jane Austen (less scathing wit, more vision and heart) plus the Industrial Revolution and a social conscience (and intimacy, must've raised a few eyebrows in its day).  SO romantic- ""every age is the same, it's only love that makes ANY of them bearable..."" (to borrow a line from Malcolm McDowell in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Time-After-Time/dp/B001BLM15O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Time After Time</a>).

I also downloaded the evocative, haunting musical theme (link below).  The cinematography is stunning, atmospheric, every shot portent with meaning and beauty, punctuated perfectly by the exquisite music.  I bought the DVD as well, had to have it.  Brendan Coyle (Downton Abbey, Lark Rise to Candleford, etc), a favorite actor, has a prominent role as a union leader.  Sinead Cusack, another favorite (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hoffman/dp/B00007AJE8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hoffman</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Passion-of-Mind/dp/B00004W5UC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Passion of Mind</a>), is great too, along with the leads.  Sublime, in every way, don't miss it!

ADDED later: I saw the 1975 BBC version with Patrick Stewart, plan to write a separate review, but I loved it too:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NORTH-SOUTH/dp/B00CEBJC20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NORTH & SOUTH</a>.  It more closely parallels the book (though there are a couple of profound issues in the book left unexamined, even misrepresented, in both versions), and Stewart is phenomenal as Thornton.  Note that it's made for TV, has the look of a soap opera, small sets, etc.  It's not the stunning thing of beauty the 2004 version is, but many points glossed over in the 2004 production are detailed here (e.g., Boucher's character, discussions of capitalism and the role of religion in people's lives).  I very much liked the depiction of Higgins, more nuanced.  Anyway, it really rounded out my North and South experience.

2222028,4,B0007N1BBC,Funny how the exchange of power seemed to coincide with the final attraction between the two main characters. Maybe it was destiny.,1396656000,,131,5.0
2222029,5,B0007N1BBC,"I would give this BBC production ten stars if I could. It tells a complex story between Margaret and John and how their love moves forward with so many twists and turns. The characters who people this series are very realistic and cover a broad sample of English society. The stories of the working class characters are drawn in sharp contrast to the elite members of the upper class.
The developing emotional struggles that give vitality to relationship between Margaret and John are interesting to watch and are the central theme of the series. But the story of the beginnings of the unionization of the cotton mills is an important ingredient to this series also. The series captures a period of time when there were sharp divisions in England's history. The performances of each character are superb, the cinematography is beautifully executed, the screenplay was done with thought and precision to detail............the production was almost perfect. The only minus is the fact that you need to control the volume of the music with so many scenes or the dialog is lost.
I enjoyed the series so much that I purchased the DVD set for my own collection.",1396656000,2,1155,4.868020304568528
2222030,5,B0007N1BBC,"This is one of the best made period mini-series I have ever seen.

HIGHLY recommend.",1396137600,,282,4.6
2222031,5,B0007N1BBC,What a beautifully done work of art.  I thought the acting was wonderful and the story kept me on my toes.  I only wish there had been more past the happy ending.

2222032,5,B0007N1BBC,"A beautiful and elegantly told story with characters richly drawn and actors performing brilliantly.  More of this caliber of series could redeem the entertainment industry (esp. in USA) from the overwrought, crass slop we are routinely offered!

2222035,5,B0007N1BBC,"A grayer, grittier version of ""Pride and Prejudice,"" ""North and South"" by Elizabeth Gaskell had everything I look for in a story. Margaret Hale is much like Elizabeth Bennet - she is from a gentle family that has fallen on hard economic times, but has a strong, uncompromising personality. She is not afraid to speak up to the ""North and South"" version of Mr. Darcy - Mr. Thornton. He is not a gentleman, like Darcy, but he is not a capitalistic monster, either. He cares about the workers in his factory; he cares deeply about his mother. His sister is in contrast for Margaret, as she is a spoiled rich girl, unloved and irritating as well. And of course, ""N & S"" has ""the-too-early proposal"", just like Austen. After Margaret throws herself into Thornton's arms during a worker uprising to keep him from being hit with a stone, his mother convinces him that Margaret must love him to make sure a public display. He proposes, using some of the same excuses as Darcy in Austen's classic, but of course she rebuffs him. Like Elizabeth, Margaret also has other suitors, but she is too principled to accept a proposal just to support herself and her family, or is she? Watch it and see how it ends! Gaskell is much more liberal than Austen, as Margaret ends up kissing someone quite passionately! Austen fans will love this movie... despite the fact that it's no longer a Regency romance, but has the grit of the Victorian era mixed in.",1395878400,3,1434,4.60546875

The industrial setting and time period added to the drama, and the realistic struggles among each of the characters captivated me throughout.

2222043,5,B0007N1BBC,"I'm afraid the heading North and South brings up the thought of the American North and South, which fills me with an overwhelming urge to sleep. This series however, is a fine British look at England when Industry was just starting to rise. It is a very pleasing view and has a romance along the lines of Pride and Prejudice or any of the better known Jane Austen books made into movies. I've watched it more than once and probably will watch it again.",1394928000,,452,4.392857142857143

2222046,5,B0007N1BBC,"I missed this some years ago when it was broadcast on PBS and probably had it confused with the Civil War series of the same name. It is very informative in terms of the impacts of the industrial revolution on the working classes in England. But, of course, some romance and intrigue is thrown in. I was quite dismayed that it was only 4 episodes and much of the story was left hanging. I may have to read the book to find out if it gives an additional ending.",1394841600,,460,4.179775280898877

There are many good quality ones out there, and so far in my experience, all with a touch or more of comic relief and very entertaining.  But this story, with brilliant acting and musical score, outshines all the rest.  Be ready for very little humor, but such beautiful and real people, so touching, that is does more than entertain!",1394755200,2,400,4.378378378378378
2222049,5,B0007N1BBC,"If you love Darcy and Elizabeth, you will adore John and Margaret. Richard Armitage and Daniela Denby-Ashe star in this adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell' s book about the industrial region in the north of England in the mid-nineteenth century. Margaret Hale (played by Denby Ashe) moves from the south of England to Milton, a factory town of cotton mills, gloomy weather, hard people and gray buildings where she meets cotton mill owner John Thornton ( played by Armitage) when he is beating one of his workers in the mill. Thorough worker's riots,  strikes, and meeting in society, they become better acquainted and Thornton falls in love with Margaret who refuses him because she doesn't like him and he is in trade. When both of her parents have died, she returns to the south where she begins to appreciate him and Milton.. After inheriting a fortune, she goes north to invest in the mill and returning to the south by train, she spies Thornton on the northbound train. They meet on the platform and come to an understanding. A wonderful love story with great locations and a bit of English history. I highly recommend this film, but be careful, it could be addictive.",1394755200,2,1171,4.797029702970297

I finished and sterted reading the novel and then i become more in love with this series. It is the best adaptation of a novel I have ever seen. And what I like about it is that it is not a girls story. Anyone can watch it and love it. Go! Buy it! And be amazed!,1394582400,3,435,3.898876404494382
2222053,5,B0007N1BBC,"Not only an unforgettable love story, but an engaging, thought-provoking picture of the social milieu of that time. As I've stated in some other comments, I find this more Dickens than Austen, but it combines the best elements of both to create a relatively brief saga (under 4 hours) that you will want to watch over and over again.  Richard Armitage steals the screen whenever he's on it, of course, but the whole production deserves high kudos for both style and substance.  Keep this on Amazon Prime!!!",1394582400,,506,4.804597701149425
2222054,5,B0007N1BBC,"One of the complaints from many viewers is that DDA was not the best Margaret, but I loved her.  I loved her bemused expression, she was a great foil to all the various characters whose expressions were more animated.  She was clearly a deep, thoughtful person, and I loved that about her--and so did Mr. Thornton, obviously.  I also found the last scene extremely touching, and I loved that she looked out the window at the end.  Great cinematography, totally in character for her, very measured personality, but it all showed on her face.  Her expressions were subtle, but very powerful.  She displayed a great internal assurance that showed in everything.",1394323200,4,658,4.882882882882883

2222057,4,B0007N1BBC,This movie differs a great deal from the original Elizabeth Gaskell novel but ignoring that fact it is a very good film except for the scene where Thornton beats up the mill worker for smoking which is so out of character.  Richard Armitage and Brendan Coyle do a great job.,1394236800,,274,4.48
2222058,4,B0007N1BBC,"I enjoyed this adaption of ""North and South."" It's not as good as the novel, of course, but I liked the two main characters (although I would have liked it better if the actress who played Margaret had spent less time looking bemused and more time expressing actual emotion). I think my favorite portrayals were the Thorntons. The actress who played Fanny was hilarious, Richard Armitage was appropriately intense, and Sinad Cusack managed to turn the deeply unsympathetic role of Thornton's mother into a sympathetic one.

I'm not sure I understand why they chose to rework the ending. The novel's final scene is quite romantic enough without transplanting it to a train station for a highly coincidental encounter. (And why was he traveling in shirtsleeves?) Overall, though, I enjoyed the miniseries and especially appreciated its gritty portrayal of the mill workers' lives.",1393977600,,878,5.183098591549296

2222070,5,B0007N1BBC,"Love Elizabeth Gaskell!  She is like a female version of Charles Dickens, we have watched this series over and over because of the excellent story line and the complicated characters.  Another great BBC production.",1393804800,,214,5.264705882352941
2222071,5,B0007N1BBC,"I wasn't at all familiar with this story until someone recommended it.  Then I rented it and sat and watched it straight through.  It's a beautifully told story on so many levels, not technically perfect but whatever the imperfections, they were minor enough for me not to pay much attention to them.

The cast is stellar all the way around.  Daniela Denby-Ashe adeptly captures Margaret's pride, gentle heart, wistfulness and confusion over Thornton.  Richard Armitage is unforgettable as Thornton - tough but heart-breakingly vulnerable with Margaret, he could be by turns gruff and yearning.  Sinad Cusack plays Thornton's mother masterfully - prideful, with steely determination and the protective instincts of a lioness when it comes to her son.  Thornton's sister Fanny is a vain and annoying character but I delighted in actress Jo Joyner's portrayal, from her sly confession that she loathed Milton to her low-voiced reflection that ""Mother doesn't approve"" when talking about the faddish things she buys to cure her minor ailments.  Brendan Coyle is superb as Nicholas Higgins, a man who risks all by being known as a union leader but is just trying to make a decent life for his family. I thought the casting of Margaret's father and brother was especially spot on: in that late-night kitchen scene, Tim Piggot-Smith and Rupert Evans, as father and son, looked amazingly like older and younger versions of the same man.

The story, briefly: Margaret Hale views the village of Helstone, where her father is a vicar, as paradise.  But her father decides to leave the clergy and he moves Margaret and her mother to the industrial town of Milton in northern England.  The contrast couldn't be more stark - from the rolling, sun-kissed meadows of the South to this hazy, dirty mill town in the North.  Margaret's father seems to happily adjust to teaching and tutoring but her mother almost immediately goes into a decline.  Margaret makes friends with Bessie Higgins, a mill worker whose father Nicholas is a union leader.  She also meets but takes an instant dislike to John Thornton, one of the mill owners who falls in love with her.  Without getting too analytical, Thornton and Margaret seem to personify the contrasts between the North and the South - he's the hard-headed businessman, pragmatic and direct; she's cultured and refined and everything genteel.  Against the backdrop of unending struggles between mill owners and mill workers, Margaret only gradually comes to see and really appreciate John Thornton for what he is - honorable, hard-working and deeply caring in his own rough way.

I didn't always understand Margaret's character but I really liked her.  She was tough, she didn't complain about the change in her circumstances, she tried to be supportive of her father's new venture and take up the slack in the household caused by her mother's failing health.  I especially loved the scenes where her letters to her cousin Edith, well-married and comfortably situated in London, are read in an overvoice as the viewer sees Margaret walking the hills and streets of Milton, the reality of her life in glaring contrast to the rosy picture she paints for Edith.  Which made all the more powerful a scene at the end of the first episode, I think - Margaret asleep at the desk in her bedroom, a voiceover of the letter she really wanted to write telling Edith that she's seen Hell ""and it's white, it's snow white"" as the scene segues to Thornton's mill workers working the looms amidst the haze of cotton motes that continually permeate the air.

Boucher, the mill worker who's caught between a rock (the need for steady income) and a hard place (the necessity of joining his fellow workers in a union strike), is heart-breaking, especially when things go wrong and Nicholas casts him out.  But this is one of the strengths of the movie, that neither the mill owners nor the workers are painted as wholly in the right.  There were greedy, conscienceless mill owners and selfish, self-serving workers, and union members were indeed having to choose sometimes between the tyranny of their employers and the tyranny of their union.  The solution to the impasse in this story ultimately relies on the best of both sides, John Thornton and Nicholas Higgins, coming to terms with each other.  And without really intending to be, Margaret is the bridge that makes that possible.

There were some scenes that were especially moving or noteworthy, aided by the judicious use of theme music and effective camera work.  Like the whole sequence that starts with Boucher's body being brought home, Margaret's father and Nicholas cringing away from the prospect of breaking the news to Boucher's wife and Margaret having to do it.  Very reminiscent of Ma Joad's observation that women were better able than men to withstand the adversities and tragedies of life.  Boucher's solitary burial on the hill is also powerful, especially overvoiced as it is by Margaret's prettied-up letter to Edith.

Another: Margaret reading her father's letter from Oxford and watching his old friend Mr. Bell through the window as he approaches the house.  Then, shortly after, Thornton's reaction on hearing the news from Higgins, when he realizes Margaret will probably be leaving Milton.

In an earlier funeral scene in the church, Margaret looks back behind her to see the Higgins family in the back pew, there to give her emotional support.  When she turns back to the front, the camera focuses on her for a moment then refocuses beyond her, to capture Thornton's face as he observes this exchange.

And, of course, the final scene where John and Margaret meet by chance on the railway platform where the north and south trains meet.  I know it was anachronistic, given the time period this was set, but damn, who cares it was one of the most beautiful love scenes I've ever seen and the perfect ending for this movie.",1393804800,3,5914,4.951417004048583
2222072,3,B0007N1BBC,Was really looking forward to this series. however disc 1 wouldn't play either on computer or in Blu-ray player.  Region problems. however disc 2 played on my computer perfectly.  Could there be a fault with the first disc as my computer wasn't even registering a disc was loaded?  So while I loved the last two episodes and extras it's a little weird not seeing the beginning to make sense of the last.  is there anything I can do to make the first disc work?,1393632000,,460,4.440476190476191

2222077,2,B0007N1BBC,"I don't know if this is the director's fault, the editor's fault, or the actress' fault, but seriously, the lead actress displays the same wide-eyed, lips-slightly-parted, gaze through the entire four episodes! Thornton and Miss Hale have zero chemistry. How the heck did they fall in love? I don't see it. Mr. Bell doesn't get enough screen time through the bulk of the series to justify him being the source of tying everything up neatly in the end.

I've never read the book so I can only speak to the movie. None of the characters are likeable. NONE OF THEM.

This thing was basically a dark, poorly directed, poorly edited, and poorly acted version of Pride and Prejudice.

I give two stars here only because Thornton is hot.",1393545600,4,730,4.6875

Daniella Denby Ashe's performance as Margaret Hale was wonderful, as was Richard Armitage's as John Thornton. This is one of those films you reach for when in need of comfort. I generally watch a lot of horror and thrillers, but this one is like a favorite blanket when I need stillness in my life, but want to watch a movie. It's quiet, soft and gentle in its richness, wrapping itself around you and making you care about all of the characters. It's a brief look at the socio-economic climate of the period through the eyes of the main characters who transform through to meet a new world--and each other. It's really a very lovely story well told.",1393459200,7,738,4.641221374045801
2222080,5,B0007N1BBC,Endearing  strong characters.  The story is told through Margret's eyes but you are also given the chance to see Thorton's side too. The actors portrayed their characters wonderfully I got lost in the story several times,1393459200,,220,5.083333333333333
2222081,4,B0007N1BBC,I was surprised that I ended up liking this show. The British just do a lot better job at period pieces. The actors in these drama seem more real than American period drama's. This one captured the conflict between management and workers in the early days of textile manufacturing.. plus a pretty good love story with some intrigue.. so I recommend it..,1393372800,,353,4.709677419354839

2222087,5,B0007N1BBC,"I enjoy many costume dramas by the BBC but this one stand out, in my opinion, because of the realistic depiction of the social struggles and living condition in post industrialized England in the second half of the 19 century. It really surprised me, and for the better - I was expecting to see a sappy love story, presented in period costumes and sprinkled with some British upper crust accent, but found it a much more down to earth and engrossing drama that doesn't just deal with romance but with the real lives and challenges of the people of that time.  And as far as accents go it's refreshing to hear  some beautiful English northern accents, and when spoken with Richard Armitage's intoxicating baritone they sound even better.
Many viewers have compared this mini series to Austen's ""Pride and prejudice"" because of the resemblance in the main character's relationship, but as a whole piece, those two don't even live in the same universe.

Forget about all those Jane's Austin's adaptations you've seen of green english country side . This story takes place in the industrialized north, and there are factories, and child labour, poverty and despair, and the color you'll see most is grey.  In fact, it is so bleak and hopeless, it has put me off at first, and I had to make myself keep watching (of course, I'm very happy I did).

I would say that the comparison I would make between ""North and south"" would be to Dickens, and not Austen. You see so much misery and sickness related to the work in the cotton mills and death is so present in the this story, it feels like a Charles dickens book, only without all the many grotesque characters with bizarre names. I have to say it was both moving AND depressing, as you see people trying to break free from their  poverty and despair, they almost succeed, but it's just beyond their reach. Still, to my modern eyes, it is far better to see people trying to take charge of their future and make something of themselves than to watch All those Austen characters just waiting for a good marriage or an inheritance to lift them up from their dire situation.

If you're just in it for the romance - you will not be disappointed. The love story of the two main character is also moving and worth watching. Though it's not the most original romantic plot ( He wants her, she thinks she doesn't want him, but then realizes she was wrong )  it's fun to watch because of the two wonderful actors and the great chemistry between them. Richard Armitage is brooding and handsome and just perfect for this role as a man of action who speaks little and unable to show his softer side. And did I say an intoxicating baritone?",1392940800,5,2670,4.571129707112971

This is not usually my genre of choice, but my best friend got me into the Pride and Prejudice series with Colin Firth and this series popped up as ""something similar.""  So I gave it a shot.  I will admit that I have never read the book, nor was I previously aware of it before this series.  Again, this is usually not something I would pick out to watch, but I got hooked pretty quick.  Because of this series, I plan on reading the book.
I won't reiterate the synopsis of the story, but I will say that the emotional tension between characters was fairly intense.  Through Margaret, you get pulled into the lives of all the characters and the struggles they face each day.  There were plenty of opportunities where if the staging/acting had been done differently, I could have lost interest pretty easily.

Somehow, women are easily attracted to the type. Richard Armitage is Mr. Thornton (just like Colin Firth is Mr. Darcy). I don't know how it was possible to make the mill scenes so realistic. In short, I recommend wholeheartedly.

The main roles of Mr. Thornton and the Miss Hale are quite well done.

2222142,5,B0007N1BBC,"Although this bears some resemblance to various elements of the Pride & Prejudice plot and characters, it far exceeds the themes of P&P in terms of strength and weight. I found myself fascinated by the backdrop: the cultural transition from a predominantly agricultural economy (taken for granted in the background of Pride & Prejudice, which was set about 70 years earlier) to an industrial one. All of the old order is being upended; this change is happening faster in the north of England than in the south; there is tension between the old privileged classes and this newly-rich entrepreneurial one; women's position in society is changing because suffrage has made inroads and women go to work alongside men in the factories; the environmental upheaval is having a terrible effect on public health; the beginning of labor disputes between factory owners and the unions is going through birthing pangs, with a great deal of volatility on both sides. I was engaged by the romance, definitely, but I was fascinated by all the forces acting on the lovers, and I was caught philosophically between these two main characters, because I was given enough information to understand both of their perspectives and to see that there was no easy resolution to their conflict, because their conflict was larger than themselves. They couldn't just ""cut through all the crap and sort themselves out, already,"" because they both had excellent reasons to be doing exactly what they were doing and to continue doing it. So the real question became: could they sort themselves out at all? The gap seemed unbridgeable unless both of them gave way, at least somewhat.

Unlike with Mr. Darcy and Lizzy, there was never any doubt in my mind that Mr. Thornton had fallen pretty thoroughly in love with Margaret very early on, in that doomed, ""Of course I'm attracted to the one person I can't have"" sort of way, so despite his initial status as a villain, he was simultaneously a tragic figure that I found myself rooting for. This is a powerful, riveting combination, and the force of it drew my attention so thoroughly that I found myself utterly fascinated by him. I must admit: this was not true of Mr. Darcy the first time I encountered Pride & Prejudice. Without picking up on all the character subtleties in Mr. Darcy (which Colin Firth played so skillfully that I missed most of them on first viewing but I now see them as glaringly obvious), we have no reason to believe that he cares a whit for Lizzy until he suddenly shows up almost out of nowhere with an awkward proposal that leaves you thinking, ""WTF?!"" Of course, once you know the plot and characters of Pride & Prejudice well, it's easy to read between the lines and figure out that Mr. Darcy is in the same position as Mr. Thornton (although Darcy is perhaps less of a true villain and more of just a shy, misunderstood, stiff sort of personality). Mr. Thornton, on the other hand, is plenty hot-blooded and outspoken, and his very lack of gentility is one of his strengths in the life he's made for himself. Being a self-made man, not one who's inherited a mansion and tenants and a life of leisure traipsing from one country estate to another, he's a lot harder and more pragmatic than Mr. Darcy. Although Mr. Thornton doesn't hide his feelings as much as Mr. Darcy does, the task of portraying him requires no less subtlety, and Richard Armitage is no less skillful than Firth in doing so. What Firth does is keep a lid on Darcy until we get a wild explosion that reveals just how much has been silently going on underneath. By contrast, Armitage starts Mr. Thornton off without any visible restraint and then has the similarly difficult task of convincing us that Thornton is not the vicious brute that he initially appears to be, without refuting our first glimpse of the character: in Thornton's eyes, his actions are entirely consistently throughout the story, although by the end of it we don't seem him as a villain at all.

The secondary characters in North & South are stronger than those in Pride & Prejudice, I must admit. Mrs. Thornton and Nicholas Higgins stand out, and I absolutely love Mrs. Thornton: there's a strong female character for you! The only secondary characters in Pride & Prejudice that leave an impression (e.g., Mrs. Bennett, Mr. Collins, Lady Catherine) are all somewhat caricatured. By contrast, Mrs. Thornton and Higgins feel just as real and intelligent and reasonably motivated as the two main lovers do. These secondary characters of course serve a purpose in the plot, but they have their own rich tapestry of lives and histories and are compelling in and of themselves.

The quality of the acting in North & South is easily at the same level as that in Pride & Prejudice; there is not a single off-note and there are plenty of notes that tug you towards the characters. They really did assemble a fantastic cast that had plenty of chemistry, and not just between the two leads (who have it in spades). The final scene at the train station is my all-time favorite romantic resolution scene.

2222154,4,B0007N1BBC,"But, this truly  is a well done adaptation.  Initially, I didn't know this though - I only knew that I liked the movie and was interested in the  time period.  The movie actually inspired me to read the book (which I found online in both print and audio versions for free).  For those who care to know, Elizabeth Gaskill's novel North and South is quite lengthy.  The writers and director did a good job of condensing this long book into the four episodes.  I much preferred to book's ending to the movie's but that is not unusual for adaptations.
To give you a time reference, Gaskill was a contemporary of Charles Dickens.  In North and South, she explores issues like class distinctions and social justice.  I will admit that  the Industrial Revolution has previously been of little interest to me.  This movie-and then the author's books - has piqued my curiosity.

If you are a fan of movie adaptations of Jane Austen novels, I believe you will also find North and South worthwhile and enjoyable as well.

2222181,5,B0007N1BBC,"When it comes to period dramas and classic literature, I always read the book before watching the movie. While some, especially the BBC, do a good job of bringing literary classics to the screen, I've found that the book is usually better. However, that is not the case with ""North and South"". This time, the BBC wins over author Elizabeth Gaskell in what is the ""best"" version of this story.

""North and South"", originally published in 1854-55, is a type of Dickensian take on Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"" crossed with the industrial revolution. After her clergyman father's crisis of conscience, Margaret Hale (Daniela Denby-Ashe) and her parents move from Helstone, an idyllic village in Hampshire, to the northern town of Milton, where they live among cotton manufacturers and their workers. This new world is so different from the old one that the family is initially unsure where to begin, and Margaret, so well-adjusted to life in the South, struggles to find her place in this culture that seems so strange.

One of her father's pupils is John Thornton (Richard Armitage), the owner of Marlborough Mills, and a well-respected master in the town. Thornton and Margaret do not exactly hit it off; she is repulsed by his behavior towards his workers, while he is perplexed by her arrogance and lack of knowledge of how things are done in Milton. However, the more the two are thrown together, the more they begin to understand each other. When a strike hits the town, Margaret is torn between the two sides - understanding both Thornton's point-of-view and that of his workers, particularly union leader Nicholas Higgins (Brendan Coyle).

What makes this movie work in a way the book didn't is its pace. Granted, at four hours, it is long (though shorter than some BBC adaptations). However, it cuts out many of the false starts of the novel and, because it is a visual medium, can show in a glance what took Gaskell multiple pages to describe. Is the film an exact replica of the novel? No, it isn't, but the changes work in enhancing the storyline rather than detracting from it. Overall, the casting is fantastic - there is little doubt that the two leads play well off each other, and with other major roles being well-cast (especially Sinead Cusack as Hannah Thornton), it comes together.

My only real issues are minor; first, the casting of Brendan Coyle is something I find questionable given how the character was described in the book, though if you haven't read the work you probably won't notice. The other blemish is the lack of production value. When ""North and South"" hit television screens in November 2004, it wasn't highly-publicized and was regarded by the BBC as a rather low-budget production. Therefore, when watching, it becomes obvious that less care was taken with this than with other adaptations done by the network. This, however, is not the fault of the series but rather the BBC, and it still stands the test of time.

Here in the US, ""North and South"" is overlooked, both as a novel and as a period piece. However, in the UK, it is regarded as one of the greatest costume dramas of the decade, and if you are in the mood for something well-acted, well-written, and making a big improvement on its source of inspiration, look no further.",1388275200,8,3279,4.806737588652482
2222182,4,B0007N1BBC,"This was a good story - I won't dispute that. Overall, I liked it very much. It was an excellent drama.  However, I turned off the....second (?) episode because of several instances (to the best of my memory) of the word d---. I didn't like hearing the language scattered throughout it (the second episode), though by most standards, there wasn't much. It was what would probably be referred to mild language, and not strong language at all. However, it is a personal preference to avoid even mild language after a point. However, if this doesn't bother you, the story is quite good and the acting is done very well. I also intend to read the book in the future.",1388188800,,662,4.563025210084033

2222189,3,B0007N1BBC,"I am a fan of British drama, and this one attempts to portray the cultural differences between the genteel south of England and the more industrial, gritty north. It succeeds on some levels, but fails to deliver as it draws to a conclusion. The two main characters, a young woman from the South and a self-made cotton mill owner from the North, embody the conflicts between the two cultures. The acting is good, but the story is somewhat contrived. The cotton mill owner is first seen beating the crap out of one of his employees, but we are asked to believe he is a basically a considerate boss and a kind person - a bit of a stretch. My main take away is that the story that develops between Margaret and John is based rather obviously on Jane Austen's Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy  -- right up to the dramatic proposal when John/Mr. Darcy declares his passion and Elizabeth/Margaret haughtily rejects the offer of love and marriage -- and the subsequent change of heart as the hero's true character is revealed. North and South is entertaining and has it's moments, but it's no Pride and Prejudice.",1387843200,,1103,4.627551020408164

Her descriptions of situations and places are so real, you feel as though you are standing right there experiencing the story with everyone else.

social differences and find love.  The differences are played against
the backdrop of the industrial North of England, with a Dickensian
moral of helping those less fortunate, the laboring poor.  Richard

his workers are people too.  Daniella Denby-Ashe is beautiful as

I like that period of time as my ancestors are from England and I studied the decor, compassion or lack of toward the mill workers.  My ancestors worked in a sewing mill making fancy cloths.
The storyline is a typical ""class"" differential, but the heroine helped anyone in need and caught the ""eye"" of the mill owner.  His mother and sister are class snobs and disapproved of the liaison between the two.
I'm a sentimental person and enjoyed the story line.  I learned recently that the war between the states was also about the cotton being shipped over to England.  Who knew?",1386979200,,718,4.6141732283464565

Daniela Denby-Ashe is spectacular and very endearing. the perfect heroine for the brooding gorgeous Armitage.  The chemistry is undeniable between these two.  Brandon Cole (Mr. Bates of Downton Abbey) portrayal of Mr. Higgins is outstanding.  He lends a warmth and intelligence to the character, making it easy to see why our main characters find it easy to have him in high regard.

Daneilla Denby-Ashe is magnificent as are Richard Armitage and the women who plays his mothercan't spell her name. Also the union guy who I've seen in so many NPR productions. The final scene is just perfect but I'm a hopeless romantic so I am totally prejudiced! Love the costumes and the scenery, the editing is excellent.

She strongly believed that women have specific and definite opinions and that expressing them in the proper venue should be appreciated and valued by all.  However, the reactions that young Miss Margaret Hale receives form those around her shows us just how unequal women were in former times.  Despite the fact that Ms. Hale didn't even recognize how much she admired the strong male lead character and took a long time to discover her real feelings for him, only added to the mystery of the times and the complexity of the female mind.  I love that these 2 had such a hard time connecting with each other thru communication, misjudgements, stereotypical thinking, etc. still there was something so attractive about each of them that made the other never give up hope of something more. Romance, maybe?  Even when they both thought they despised each other, they couldn't even commit to that.  This portrayal of Gaskell's work is so on target as far as the author's creative expression, that I truly see the clash between the sexes at these times as the back drop of all the failures of that era.

The local cotton mill pollutes the air, reinforcing the dark atmosphere of workers laboring for long hours in exchange for low wages. There's no warmth or fun on the horizon, as the climate is colder than in the south.  So, there are no beautiful flowers or pastoral views.  There's a lack of educated society, so Miss Hale takes tea with the mill owner's sister, while her father offers educational sessions to the mill owner whose father died when he was quite young.  Miss Hale is outspoken in front of John Thornton, the mill owner, because her father was a clergyman who has raised her with a strong sense of right and wrong.  Miss Hale dislikes Thornton in the beginning, but begins to notice that John is a fair boss who tries to makes good decisions for his workers.  There's also a labor leader who plans a strike for better conditions, whose daughter becomes one of Miss Hale's best friends.  Sadly, the strike talk leads to violence. When Miss Hale bravely stops the violence, she gets injured in the head by a brick, so John feels obligated to offer her his hand in marriage.  She turns him down, because her mother has just died and she doesn't want to leave her father alone.  She also can't let Thornton in on a family secret, that her brother is hiding from the law, since Thornton is a magistrate for the courts.  Sadly, Thornton sees her hug her brother goodbye, deciding incorrectly that she is behaving shockingly with a lover.  As time goes by, Miss Hale's best friend dies, as well as her father.  While steeped in grief, she finally inherits a house, plus some money.  She decides to offer John capital to re-start his mill, so he can re-hire all the starving workers.  John finally finds out that the man Miss Hale was hugging late at night was actually her brother.  The gentle climax to this love story is that Thornton takes a train down to her old southern town, hoping to re-connect with her.  She, going north to help re-open the mill, ends up at the same train station.  She first offers him money as a business proposition; he offers her a flower from her home town while opening his heart to propose to her again.  What follows is one of the most poignant scenes in the history of love stories.  Instead of him grabbing her aggressively and taking charge of this meeting, he gently slides his hand across to cover hers, and starts to kiss her sweetly by leaning towards her.  She starts to wake up to the thought that he really does love her, that she is finally free to decide to marry, and that it's allowed for her to lean towards him.  John next sees her run back to the man escorting her on this trip -- so we worry she'll ruin everything by turning him down again -- but she's only gone back to the first train to collect her luggage.  By joining John on his train going north, she signals that she is prepared to sit side by side with him for life, and that they are going ""home"" as an engaged couple.  This ending is carried off brilliantly by actor Richard A., who conveys an uptight, brooding man longing for the hope and happiness love can bring better than any other actor working. (While he loves to play villains, he is a tall, dark, and handsome leading man who is perfectly cast as a romantic hero.) He appears to be a great kisser, and a patient lover who will wait for a woman's full consent.  Women in the audience will like the way Miss Hale finally achieves a marriage which includes equality and partnership, instead of her having to marry a wealthy man in order to gain a position in society.  The recent deaths of so many key characters allow both Thornton and Miss Hale to realize that life is short, so any possible happiness must be seized, or lost forever.  This is a very soft, very romantic, very satisfying ending.  (USA directors would have made John's character use a John Wayne accent, grabbing Miss Hale and forcing her on to the correct train, saying something like, ""Get your ass on this train; I'm planning to marry you... NOW, bitch!"" etc.)",1380067200,,4145,4.493333333333333

Some of the movie had technical difficulties, and did not come through.  If I had not watched it about a few years ago on my dvd, I would not have known that some of the really good scenes were cut off.  The only reason that I watched it here was because I saw it on your list of movie unlimited streaming, and thought that I would save myself the trouble of getting up to change the disc.

2222266,4,B0007N1BBC,"Mrs Gaskell's novel deals with a young woman who moves from rural Helstone in the south of England to Milton, a gritty industrial town in the north. Her father refuses to sign the bishop's declaration of conformity with the Common Book of Prayer, thus making him a dissenter. As a result, he loses his position in the church and moves the family lock, stock and barrel to Milton, far enough away, he thinks, to make his disgrace a secret. There, they live on his wife's meager income while he ineffectively tries to make money giving ""lectures"" and taking private pupils. In this booming industrial town, an Oxford education is a rarity. One of his pupils is Mr. Thornton, owner of a thriving cotton mill. Mr. Thorton is a self-made man, intelligent but not educated.

The daughter, Margaret, is first repulsed, then attracted to Mr. Thornton (very like Pride & Prejudice.) A series of reversals and sudden deaths changes the fortune of both Margaret and Thornton.

The problem with Gaskell's writing is that it is less skillful than Bronte or even Dickens. She has a good eye for the milieu but uses a broad brush and her novelistic machinations are rather jarringly unlikely--or handled less skillfully than the same ""unlikely"" occurrences would be by Bronte or Dickens. But the drama makes for a good miniseries, and the script is quite faithful to the book, except the initial chapters where Mr. Hale pretty much destroys his family is played down a lot. This is in my opinion Mrs Gaskell's best novel and it was a good read--and it makes a good dramatic series. However, Wives and Daughters, a weaker book, made for a better series, in my opinion.",1379376000,,1652,4.7727272727272725

2222268,5,B0007N1BBC,"This story was a total surprise.  I had never read the book, so I had no expectations, but it couldn't have been better.  I read the book immediately after seeing the series, and I think the TV version was actually better!!  The changes/improvements made by the screen writer were perfect and made me like many of the characters better than I would have just reading the  book.  Even if you are a big fan of the book, you should love this version.  This is almost a Pride & Prejudice in reverse.  Margaret is poor, but her father is a clergyman and considered upper class.  She is somewhat ""prejudiced"" against Mr. Thornton, who is a manufacturer, lower class.  (Oh No!  He as actually works for a living!)  In all fairness to her, he does act somewhat bad at the beginning,  but hang in there, he gets better.

He falls for her immediately, but unlike Darcy (P&P) who feels he is too good for Elizabeth, Thornton believes that Margaret is too good for him.  The love story is set in the manufacturing town of Milton, a rather dreary place in the ""north"" compared to London and her home in the ""south"" of England.  Manufacturing, mills, workers vs. masters, and strikes all interact to make Margaret's and Thornton's love-life complicated and challenging, and to make each of them grow in understanding and character.

Some American reviewers complained about the DVD being the English version which didn't play in their DVD players.  I am a USA viewer (California) and did not have any trouble with my DVD.",1379289600,2,1507,4.669201520912548

The setting is just not pleasant, unfortunately, and there is a great deal of ugliness in the scenery and in some characters' behavior.  It's not as ""feel good"" as Wives & Daughters, but it is very well done.  The casting is excellent, the acting perfect, and it does have a happy ending, for all the misery that you have to see throughout the story.  It was written to draw attention to the misery of the working class in mill towns, and it certainly does the job.  So, even thought it's less fun to watch than Cranford or Wives & Daughters, it is a very well done movie.",1379289600,,649,4.2439024390243905

2222287,4,B0007N1BBC,"I am in love with not only this movie but the soundtrack as well! The actors were very well casted, and the plot was very compelling. So compelling I wish it would have gone more 'in-depth'. The main characters remind me a lot of the main characters in Pride and Prejudice but with a more Bleak House feel. It's not a funny and light-hearted movie like pride and prejudice- instead  it has that angsty,and cold feeling throughout which makes you really understand the characters.

My only complaint would be the relationship between Thorton and Margaret. It was more of a 'love at first sight' type of romance. There was no real reason as to why they loved each other- after all every time they spoke  they ended up bickering. I would've like to see their feelings 'blossom' more rather than just already be there. On the other hand maybe it's because of the strong repression of feelings by these two really stubborn people that makes me really cherish this couple.

The end felt rushed but I hear the ending was rushed in the book as well. BBC's version seems to be slightly more favored, though I haven't read the book myself.

This is a much harsher story than the usual Jane Austen fare and strongly illustrates the Victorian English dichotomy.

2222314,5,B0007N1BBC,"North & South proves once again that BBC is the master of period dramas, and quality TV for an intellectual audience. Their programs remain consistently good, their casts do not succumb to the A-list Tendency, which is to cast actors for their name and fame only. Their production values remain very high, no matter the budget, and they consistently choose good subjects.

Let us first speak of the acting. Richard Armitage is absolutely electrifying in his role as John Thornton, the stern and brooding mill owner who may seem cold on the outside, but is revealed to be an good and honourable man inside. His performance is absolutely phenomenal! Armitage, actually, is always phenomenal, and brings to his role charisma, gravitas, drama, and his piercing gaze and excellent voice. I recommend seeking out his excellent roles as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/John-Porter/dp/B008U504JE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">John Porter</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thorin-Oakenshield/dp/B00BWJARHO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thorin Oakenshield</a>. His presence on the screen is noticeable, and helps carry the miniseries by lending it his dramatic weight.

The rest of the cast is brilliant, too. Daniela Denby-Ashe plays a pretty-faced but complex Margaret Hale, a worthy counterpoint to Armitage, Tim Pigott-Smith is typically excellent as her bookish father, and Brendan Coyle (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Downton-Abbey/dp/B00AXVHHTI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Downton Abbey</a>) steals the scenes as the leader of the uprising worker's unions. Sinead Cusack, wife of Jeremy Irons, plays in a strong performance as Thornton's mother. This show of excellence does not stop at the leads, but carries down even to the minor characters and extras. BBC, I tell you, is unrivalled in excellence.

The production values, set design, and costumes are rich and realistic. The air is smokey and grey, the streets dark and muddy, the costumes rich, period-accurate, and lived-in. The sets feel real, mostly because they ARE, - lit by candles and smokey gas lamps, the wallpapers fading and the chairs perhaps a little scuffed. This is not the shiny, almost story-bookish unreality that plagues so many soap operas. The result is an engrossing and involving adaptation.

The story does not disappoint, an effective mystery of romance, drama, character study, and political pronouncement on worker's leagues and fairness of rank. Gaskell's work is not as comedic as Austen's, nor as classic as Dicken's, but is still excellent, and a must-read for fans of the miniseries, or any of the aforementioned authours.

I highly recommend North & South as both an engrossing character study and drama, and a showcase for some of the BBC's finest acting (courtesy of Richard Armitage and Co.) and excellent production values. Five stars!

2222328,4,B0007N1BBC,"Very good... if you like English 18th/19th century stories... but this is not Austen!

I was not wild about the lead female although she did a good job... and definitely not horribly cast... she is attractive... but not to the degree the the script requires or... kept referring to her as.

The male lead was perfect... .
The movie itself is obviously a retelling of the birth of industry and horrible working etc. conditions BUT... it gives a good and surprisingly fair assessment of the real problems of both the small industrialists at the time... always at the mercy of the marketplace and another class of bankers etc. above them.

Especially the movie deals superbly as a study in a man who pulls himself up within this cauldron... after the standard family fall... whose heart is good, which realities make it impossible to indulge...  who too can only go forward in the realities which he finds himself and prides himself on doing just that.

Our introduction to him is witnessed by the female lead while the man is beating a worker brutally and it is filmed that way... this is where the movie and story soars... no BS here... but there is a reason... . He makes no apology at any time for his actions and in fact one is won over to a degree to the potions of both labor and ownership learning again that... technology driven changes are selective forces for the human race... and that there are times when our humanity fall far behind our race's inventions.

I ended up likely and respecting the man.

The Romance itself is believable. The lead male character's mother is extremely well cast and acted... even her... I warmed to as a women.

The sister of the male lead is the only flaw in the movie. I have not read the book but she is played here as a ditzy blond... something that clearly too often comes from Jewish sensibilities in politics and in comedy. Before you react think about the statement no matter you background Here this character is overacted, that is... not well directed. You could have cut her dullness and selfishness in half and made the point better... as Jane Austen would have done... .

A long evening if you watch all of them but highly recommended... for the male lead and the themes not often seen in the cartoon propaganda of 20th and now 21st Century political corralling. Males will like it I predict too.

One other thing... the comparison to Jane Austen... a later period of course and revolutionary changes have befell... the social contract of England; technological changes are fracturing the agrarian social mix of nobility/middle classes/gentleman's families... and those that keep them in the lives they love. The ""poor"" in Austen are barely dealt with and it is a weakness of her stories. But that was not her theme.

So although it is still England in North and South of course...and Jane's England at around 1800 was changing... they are very different countries... cut apparently by a 'north south' sensitivity. The latter is an aspect that I was only vaguely aware of... so another reason to watch the movie... and its very strong historical theme is a great attraction to an American not aware of some of the particulars of region in England.

NO... Jane Austen is better, BUT again the writer is good too and should be congratulated for a more even handed treatment of a far more difficult period socially... and a period that contemporary propaganda allows us all... rarely a forum... to discuss evenhandedly, with wisdom so loaded is the lore of Marxism/Capitalism et. al. .

Much of the appeal of Austen is her subtle, biting but empathetic... observations about human interaction and real motivations... of classes specifically but also how people are victims of personal circumstances more often than their cartoon political representations allow... and that the real nobility of the soul... no matter where one finds it is what all humans long for... that and a ""fortune!""

The absolute gulf between landed classes, gentlemen... and peasants... no matter their circumstances... and prejudices that ARE falling to the realities of the time, this too of course, is all Austen. For Jane's England is changing... and what is on the horizon... which... we see here in ""North and South,"" will fracture much of what we love about Jane Austen's world. But it too is a period when people are segmented into ridged classes based most often still... on birth.",1374883200,2,4413,4.804749340369393

2222383,5,B0007N1BBC,"Elizabeth Gaskell is as good as Jane Austen any day - and this mini-series of her work doesn't disappoint!  In addition to a love story that you won't forget, there's the forefront of the cotton industry and labor problems of England in the mid 1800s to contend with.  The dark feeling of the story is a world with gray skies, gray buildings, and smog, it's a portrait of the haves and have nots, the masters vs. the workers, and misunderstandings.  Yet, the last five minutes of the mini-series will make your heart sing and become a favorite with the staying power of Pride and Prejudice!  I can't recommend it more highly.",1371081600,2,625,4.603603603603603

2222388,5,B0007N1BBC,"Can't believe I hadn't seen this mini series before. It is a beautiful story with superb acting. The backdrop of the industrial revolution (here specifically the cotton factories) in a Northern town juxtaposing the quiet agrarian life of the South, sets an interesting tone for the entire show.

The depressing part is where the common man has to live, the conditions they live under, and the terrible health conditions.  Still, I enjoyed the story.  Now comes the romance and business success ...or does it?",1370390400,,345,4.5

2222393,5,B0007N1BBC,"A wonderful, visually stunning adaption of Elizabeth Gaskell's 1855 novel of the same name.  Starring Richard Armitage, Daniela Denby-Ashe, and Sinead Cusack (among others), this production is a must-see for fans of period drama.

Book synopsis via Wikipedia: ""Forced to leave her home in the tranquil rural south, Margaret Hale settles with her parents in the industrial town of Milton where she witnesses the harsh brutal world wrought by the industrial revolution and where employers and workers clash in the first organized strikes. Sympathetic to the poor whose courage and tenacity she admires and among whom she makes friends, she clashes with John Thornton, a cotton mill manufacturer who belongs to the nouveaux riches and whose contemptuous attitude to workers Margaret despises. The confrontation between her and Mr Thornton is reminiscent of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr Darcy in Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen, but in the broad context of the harsh industrial North.""",1370131200,,979,5.35064935064935
2222394,5,B0007N1BBC,"This is a masterful production of the rivalry between the North and South of England;  the latter is all lace and finery and gentle living, and the former is the cente of manufacturing, made of crude businessmen and hard living, like child factory work.

From the pen of Elizabeth Gaskell, it's a moving story of people and their strengths and foibles... what good literature is all about.  Historically apt, the film captures the contrast between the two sections of the country ably.

No word here about the plot, so no spoiler alert needed.  Enjoy performances by Daniella Denby-Ashe, Sinead Cusack, and Richard Armitage.  Supporting cast is peerless:  Brendan Coyle, Pauline Quirke, Jo Joyner, to name only a few.

The conclusion is so touching I wanted to cry.  And that's all I will say about that.  Don't miss this one.",1370044800,,826,4.877697841726619

Superb performance of the main and secondary characters, especially John Thornton's mother.

2222405,5,B0007N1BBC,"I can only add my recommendation of this production. Everything from the music to the cinematograthy is quite simply stunning. All the performances are excellent. I love period dramas and think I must have watch most of them in my time but none of them can compare with North and South.

I love the story, but I think the main reason I personally love so much is down to the character of John Thornton himself who, for me, is simply the most wonderful period drama hero of all time, both in the series and the book. For me he definitely beats Darcy hands down. OK he isn't perfect, but I like that. He is however passionate, honest, kind, loyal and hard-working. Who wouldn't want to be loved by a man like that, and his steadfast love for Margaret is just wonderful and heart-warming.

I can't imagine any one else playing the role except for Richard Armitage, who is simply sublime.  He is an incredible actor and conveys a lot in his expressions. He conveys his love, angst, passion and sadness through his face and eyes so well in so many scenes. In the ""Look back at me"" scene, you can literally see the hope dying in his eyes as the camera stays fixed on his face as she leaves. It is quite incredible. And the expression of tender love on his face at the train station at the end, when Margaret is explaining her ""business proposition"" had me literally melting.

I would also like to add my appreciation of the extras on the DVD such as the deleted scenes including the extended proposal scene. Also the interviews and the wonderful commentaries on episode 1 and 4 which are very interesting and informative.",1368662400,3,1615,4.52054794520548

2222411,5,B0007N1BBC,"The reviews speak for themselves and there is not much more I can add. This mini-series is my ultimate favorite and let me say that it is not only for the ladies but men would like it as well. The men in my life really liked it and actually said that they would watch it again. They all said that they would love to have Mr. Thorntons accent. It would help them in drawing in dates. I love costume dramas and my collection is vast...THIS IS MY NUMBER 1! Yes, even befor P&P and Jane Eyre.
Watch it and you WILL agree.

UPDATE: Like most, I did not want this storyline of this mini series to end and I just got done reading one of the many continuations of the story that has been written. There was so many to choose from and can say I made the right pick. I am in the process of writing a review for this continuation and will post it soon but it takes off from where the mini series left off--on the train with John and Margaret. IT IS SO GOOD! You can see the actors clearly continuing their story. The continuation is called John & Margaret: Coming Home With Me by M. J. Schrauben. I went to Smashwords and downloaded from that site in pdf(cheaper) but I loved it so much, I came back to see how much it would cost me to order in print (I will wait until it comes down in price). Don't listen to the review which says it is disgusting and has explicit scenes. UNTRUE and a obviously a troll! I am going to read some of the onther continuations but this one is going to be hard to top.

I recommend you watch this mini series and right after, pick up this book. Their story continues in Ms. Schrauben's book and it is just beautifully done. She loves these characters just as much as hundreds of others and stays true to the actors who played these roles. Yes ladies, you clearly hear Richard A. voice and see his actions in this continuation.  Make a day of it, buy this DVD, watch it straight thru and read the rest of the story in this book. You will do what I did, smile and sigh contently.",1368144000,,1997,4.141752577319588

Its not a very long series, only four episodes.  Don't expect the grandeur of Downton Abbey because this takes place in the industrial north and with the working class.  The sets and costumes are dark and dreary but they match the place and time.  The story is not dreary though, it centers around a young woman who has moved to another way of life and how she adjusts to it.  It gives you lots to reflect on in regards to class and gender issues from that time.  Overall, a must see for those that love this type of drama/romance.",1367452800,,706,4.4186046511627906

2222421,5,B0007N1BBC,"My wife and I are fans of English period dramas and have seen many of them over the years.  In the last 15 years, the BBC has produced quite a few such dramas, many of which are excellent.  Even among these, North & South is thoroughly outstanding.

The character development is wonderful and truly satisfying, a rarity indeed.  We see the characters portrayed as humans and rejoice as we see them change, grow, and adapt their worldviews via these experiences.  Most all of the characters, certainly the main ones, are shown as complex individuals of depth with both good and bad qualities including kindness, love, loyalty, service to others, prejudices, anger, and mistrust.

There is a wonderful lack of bias in the storytelling.  Although there are multiple conflicts presented, the filmmakers do not tell us how to think about any of it.  The film manages to completely avoid a simplistic good vs bad paradigm.  Instead, the portrayal is much more real.  Just when it seems Thornton will be characterized as a rich, evil businessman who would do anything for profit, you see his devotion to his mother and his efforts to treat his workers fairly in a highly competitive industry and often unforgiving world.  Just when it appears the union workers will be portrayed as saints, we see Margaret pointedly challenging the union leaders on their tactics and behavior.  There are many moments of unexpected dialogue which alter the perceptions of both the characters and the viewer.  It creates a brilliant examination of the issues which yields complexity and depth rarely found in any film.

I only wish they would release this on Blu-Ray.",1366934400,,1642,4.945255474452555

2222431,5,B0007N1BBC,"I stumbled across this series by chance and was hooked within the first few minutes. The Industrial Revolution and its effect on people of all classes is shown with an uncanny realism that really brings the message home, how unprepared society as a whole was for the changes that machines brought to production of goods. So yes, there is plenty of (impeded) romance in this series and Brendan Coyle is starring as well, but what impressed me the most was the realistic depiction of early industrial England. But not just the Industrial Revolution is realistically shown. The series also paints a clear picture of societal differences.  London Society is shown as blissfully unaware of how goods are manufactured and what it entails. By contrast, the Northern industrial class of manufacturers and workers has to deal with the burgeoning union movement and the overall modernization of their environment.

The actors do outstanding jobs in their respective parts. Brendan Coyle, while not playing a butler, but a simple worker, shows traits that fans of Downton Abbey will easily recognize in Mr. Bates. Richard Armitage plays the repressed, but also proud mill owner John Thornton. While Sinead Cusack does an outstanding job of portraying the mother of the mill owner John Thorton; portraying her as caring, but also hard. The major character, young Margaret Hale is portrayed by Daniela Denby-Ashe and we see how she comes into her own and grows up through the four parts of the series.

I can only highly recommend that people watch this series. If I could, I would make this a mandatory viewing about the Industrial Revolution and the societal changes it brought about.",1365897600,,1673,5.0324909747292415
2222432,5,B0007N1BBC,"I would recommend this mini-series to anyone who enjoys period films. Very good dialog. While I preferred the acting of the leading man more, the leading woman's acting improved over the episodes. She started out a little deadpan.",1365897600,,230,5.078947368421052
2222433,5,B0007N1BBC,"This is a wonderful adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's classic novel. A fantastic period drama with really top notch performances. This romance is along the lines of Pride and Prejudice but set among the gritty background of Northern England during the industrial revolution. Be prepared to fall in love with Richard Armitage who smolders as John Thorton the Northern mill owner. Daniela Denby-Ashe plays opposite him and gives a very nuanced performance as Marget Hale, the newly arrived parson's daughter who does not understand Mr. Thorton or the Northern way of life. A must see for period drama lovers.",1365811200,,606,5.1938775510204085
2222434,5,B0007N1BBC,"The story held my attention and showed a part of England's history that I've not seen before. It shows people as imperfect, which is what we are.",1365638400,,145,4.407407407407407
2222435,5,B0007N1BBC,I loved the plot and the way it was made as a film. I liked the act of the actors. So five stars to BBC.,1365638400,,104,3.2
2222436,5,B0007N1BBC,This has got to be one of my favorite love stories. It's fascinating to see people's lives in the start of the Industrial Revolution in Britain. Excellent story that's well told and well acted. And very romantic in spite of the gritty environment they live in.,1365465600,,260,4.673913043478261
2222437,5,B0007N1BBC,"I am new to the work of Richard Armitage, but his talent really draws you in. I love the fact that the characters are not one-dimensional. Everyone has their flaws and their virtues. It makes the relationships a little more realistic. Mrs. Thornton, for example, could easily be played as a crusty, bitter old woman, and nothing more. But some of my favorite scenes are the ones where she is speaking privately with her son, because you get to see how deeply her affections run, though hard times have made her a little prickly. I have not read the book, so can offer no comparison. But the adaptation is worth seeing if you're a fan of literature.",1365379200,2,648,4.547008547008547
2222438,5,B0007N1BBC,I'd say this movie is kind of like Pride & Prejudice during the Industrial Age.  The actors are wonderful and have very good chemistry on screen. I have watched it many times and absolutely love it.,1365292800,,198,4.5
2222439,5,B0007N1BBC,"This movie is so BEAUTIFUL. My only regret is that I should have bought the entire series of Elizabeth Gaskill Collection. It would have been cheaper. I bought The North and South and I say this DVD is for keep. I rate it better than the Pride and Prejudice BBC Series. The production of North and South is excellent .The casting  and cinematography is just so beautiful And of course the leading actors is perfect. I don't want to repeat the same rave of admirations written by others and I agree with them 100% . The last chapter I must have seen at least 20X , I might as well use it for my screen saver. Richard Armitage is so gorgeous and sweet and Daniela Dendby Ashe is so beautiful- both their acting is superb. This movie is better than Pride and prejudice and I love it as well. I will bring down Colin Firth one notch down  against Richard Armitage. Mr Thornton is hot and passionate. Mr Darby is a bit too cool and cautious . But , of course Sandy Welch ( The person responsible for Screenplay) took the liberty to update the romantic scene in the train station and bring it to modern day . This is a proof that a movie can be made beautifully without violence and nudity. Very  classy movie.",1365206400,3,1204,4.31858407079646
2222440,5,B0007N1BBC,"Once again, I purchased this DVD while waiting for my next Downton Abby fix.  It is only a short series but well worth viewing.  The story line moved along nicely, the characters were well done and I found it engaging.  Not a complicated or involved drama, but still it managed to keep me captivated.  Sorry that it was not longer.  I had also purchased the ""Lark Rise"" series and did not finish that as it was too much like watching the British version of Little House on the Prairie, but North & South had a more adult story line that I found entertaining.  If you are looking for some light, but enjoyable summer viewing while you wait for the Downton saga to continue, give North & South a try, I believe you will be pleased.",1365206400,,729,4.362962962962963

2222444,5,B0007N1BBC,"I really like this movie.  I enjoy movies that go back in time, threading bits of history into their story.  The acting was great, the people were real people, in the sense that they were believable characters. I have watched it many times over since purchasing it and have yet to grow tired of it.  There is much to learn about history, about the North and the South's views of life, the way the people relate to each other, how views can change when we take the time to get to know the people on both sides of a situation.",1364774400,,524,4.22
2222445,5,B0007N1BBC,"One of my favorite movies.  I bought the DVD and have watched it several times. It's like visiting old friends. Superb acting, intense plot with surprising twists and turns.

When it went off Netflix Instant Play, I knew I had to buy it. More expensive than other dvds, but worth it. If you're a history person like me, I think it was an accurate portrayal of the working and social conditions of industrialized cities. The characters and storyline are interesting and engaging.

Original book of the same name and written by Elizabeth Gaskell is akin to Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. The movie is informative of the living conditions in cotton mill cities of that period and very romantic as well. This is A MUST SEE for all BBC mini-series and PBS Masterpiece lovers!

2222474,5,B0007N1BBC,I've seen this about 3 times and each time I've seen it I like it more. The characters are well developed and acting is great.

2222475,5,B0007N1BBC,The BBC adaptations of the British literature classics are always excellent and this one is no exception. Everything is perfect about it.,1361577600,,137,5.2727272727272725
2222476,3,B0007N1BBC,"I love English literature and I feel as though this screenplay adaptation let some of the characters down by changing stories about their demeanor, changing dialogue and story lines where it did not need to be changed. It always disappoints me when this happens to great literature.  If the screenplay writer wanted a different story, they should have written their own. I'll provide some examples without trying to give too much away.

Thornton was portrayed as more severe than he was.  His entire introduction to the story was completely changed and thus ruined some of the appeal.  Higgins wasn't as rough around the edges as he should have been and Mary was portrayed brilliantly but a little more educated than a person of her class would have been.  Mr. Hall's exit from the story line was appalling and made me want to throw the book at the writer(s) and tell they disrespected one of the best English authors of all time by the changes they made.

I have a feeling Ms. Gaskell would have hated this movie.  Not for the production (it was the brilliant part of this series) but for the way the story portrayed some powerful characters and the extra weakness it provided to others (Margaret's mother, for one).  There were missed opportunities with dialogue and I would be remiss if I weren't honest about it.

This is an example of what happens when horrible writing (re-telling) happens to a superb production and when one feels they can abuse good literature for the sake of their own story telling.",1361491200,7,1509,4.75095785440613
2222477,5,B0007N1BBC,"I haven't read the book yet, but you can bet that it will be my next read! However wonderful the book may be, I believe that this adaptation lived up to it. The screenplay, the actors, and all the supporting work (sets, costume, etc) were tremendous.

What a wonderful love story, the feeling of inadequacy from Thornton to deserve the love of a lady like Margaret was heartfelt. Margaret, on her part, is a strong female character and her dislike for Thornton was real - she didn't get caught up in his wealth, but in the person. Then when he proved to her that he was good, she didn't throw herself at him but maintained a respectful front. I believe she did so because she didn't want to belabor the fact that she hurt him when she rejected him and he has moved on. Then there was the misunderstanding with Frederick that kept Thornton at a distance upon her departure, but he did decide to after her when he realized that there wasn't another man in the way. I could watch the scene in the end at the train station over and over..so romantic!

I didn't care too much about the whole strike deal, but I did like the personal story regarding Margaret's friendship with the Higgins family and also the future dealings between Nicholas and Thornton. The two men are intelligent, hardworking, pragmatic workers with similar backgrounds - they would make for good friends and I'm glad they saw that in each other.",1361232000,,1411,4.551181102362205
2222478,5,B0007N1BBC,"I expected (and was looking forward to) something cozier/safer like Pride and Prejudice. This is a far grittier experience, raw and provocative. There are no easy answers in this story. Complex issues are tackled deftly and with a surprisingly even hand. And these characters show real weaknesses, make truly bad decisions, make you question whether or not you can root for them.

That said, the romance in this story is also just incrediblethe very best kind of slow burn. Richard Armitage is one of the most compelling leading men you'll ever encounter.

I cannot recommend this highly enough. I watched all four episodes back to back and then couldn't sleep. I've been thinking about it and preaching about it ever since. WATCH. IT. NOW.",1361145600,4,740,4.959677419354839

better than any of the J. Austen mini-series .  I just loved it and consider North and South almost a work of art : you never tire of it .  - But , just like the book ,  I wish the final scenes had been a better match for the rest of the production .

2222490,5,B0007N1BBC,"Captured the problems of industry and labor while throwing in a real romance in the style of wonderful Jane Austen. I especially appreciated the fact that the author took into account the fact that a true lasting love has to have two partners and friends to form a lasting relationship.  Whenever I read/watch a story now, I want to believe that the two characters are looking beyond the ""love"" of the moment and thinking about what it would mean to spend every day ""living"", working, playing, being silent, and loving just one person for the rest of their lives.  I replayed the ending several times.  I was touched by the simple gesture of her finally taking his hand and holding it in her own - now that is true romance.  A simple, gentle touch that says so much while so simple; if only other film makers could realize the power of a sweet gesture!

2222495,5,B0007N1BBC,"First off, period dramas are definitely my favorite genre of movie.
Up until I viewed this series, ""Pride & Prejudice"" '95 easily took top honors as my all-time favorite!  Now I'd say, it's pretty much a tie between N&S and P&P!

After all these years, I've finally decided to write a little review...

I found this at my local library back in 2006, and promptly took it home to watch.  (At the time, the authors name didn't jog my memory.  I hadn't realized that she wrote ""Wives & Daughters""-- which had previously been turned into a miniseries, that I enjoyed when (PBS) Masterpiece Classic aired a few years before.)

Being as I hadn't read the book prior to viewing, I had nothing to compare it to.
I can't remember exactly if I watched the whole series in one sitting or not, but I distinctly recall my reaction to the ending-- I was in utter tears!  Never had an ending (a happy one at least) moved me so much as this one had!!  Of course, the classical score (""Northbound Train"") softly playing in the background packs quite the emotional punch as well!

As far as initial impressions go-- I don't think anyone in the cast disappointed me with their performance.  The whole thing was expertly acted; in particular by the leads Daniela Denby-Ashe (Miss Hale), and Richard Armitage (Mr. Thornton)- both of whom were entirely unknown to me at the time.
The locations, scenery, script, and musical score are all top notch!

Last year I was able to finally read the book, which brought fresh understanding to its characters (especially Mr. Thornton).
..For anyone inclined, I strongly urge you to read the book; you'll get so much more out of the story if you do! (Or perhaps the audio-book if you don't want to read all 400 some pages.)

Beyond just a tale of romance, and social etiquette-- the book and movie really gives you a glimpse of the great change that the industrialized age was bringing to not just England, but the rest of the world. Which in turn had an impact on society in general.
It really goes without saying that life back then was extremely hard; death came at a much earlier age than nowadays!
The conditions the industrialized working class had to endure obviously led many to an early grave. Workers unions were created to ensure proper working conditions, and fair wages.
Also, instead of being born into privilege, one could insure their own financial independence, and social status.

Just like her contemporary (and friend) Charlotte Bronte, Elizabeth Gaskell wrote strong female characters.  Like ""Jane Eyre"" I would imagine that ""Margaret Hale"" was not typical of the average woman of that period (or how they were expected to behave).  These characters were ahead of their times, and obviously so where the real women that wrote them--or at least aspired to be (much like Jane Austen)!

**POSSIBLE SPOILERS**
If I had to have one little quibble about the film verses the book, it would be the way in which the leads met.  Mr. Thornton although a ""bulldog"" never did that to a worker (in fact, as both later portrayed, he actually struck up a friendship with Nicholas Higgins)!
One hit would have gotten the point across- instead he ended up beating him! While it's entirely possible that an owner/overseer could have done that back then for the reason stated in the movie, it just wasn't in line with his character. But I guess the writers/producer/director felt that the novel's reasons Margaret took a dislike to him maybe wouldn't translate to film well; especially since societal views have changed so much since then, and they had to get the point across right away by having the character do that.

Although the film ending is different than the book, I have no qualms with it.  Perhaps it's not the way things would have been done back then (at least in public), but in my opinion, it does convey more emotional depth than the actual book ending (which has an abrupt, almost unfinished feel to it).

If you desire further understanding of the Victorian era/life, here are a few things I can recommend to view: ""Who the Dickens is Mrs. Gaskell?"" (found on disc 3 of ""Wives & Daughters"" in ""The Elizabeth Gaskell Collection"" dvd collection).  Historical (reality) documentary shows: ""Victorian Farm"", ""Victorian Pharmacy"", ""The Supersizers Go...Victorian"", and ""Turn Back Time: The High Street (1st Episode: Victorian Era)"".

**P.S.** There is a new (mini) series called ""The Mill""; based on factual accounts/documents of the Quarry Bank Mill in Cheshire, England.  Set in the year 1833, during the height of the industrial revolution.  There are 4 episodes total; and a second series/season has been commissioned.  All I can say is, if you desire to know how  mill workers of the time lived, you will find it in this series.  It's very much in the vein of ""North & South"": very realistic, no glossing over (also comparable to recent Dickens adaptations such as ""Little Dorrit"", and ""Bleak House"").  It air's on Channel 4 in the UK, but Acorn Media UK will release it on dvd in August (2013).  FYI, it's also been picked up for a second series (season).
Another mini (2 episodes) documentary series recommendation is ""How The North Was Built (with Robson Green)""-- about the 18th/19th century industrial revolution!

In conclusion, I feel this series definitely did the book justice, despite the 2 discrepancies.  And highly recommend this miniseries to those that enjoy period dramas (particularly those by Charles Dickens, the Bronts, Thomas Hardy, William Makepeace Thackeray, Anthony Trollope, Catherine Cookson, etc.)!

I have such a better, deeper understanding of both the North & South (esp. during the industrial revolution), because of the historical value of this movie as well.

Most importantly, though, the last 10 minutes of this movie are my favorite romantic minutes of ANY movie, ever! :) I often watch them when other romantic movies leave me unsatisfied...",1358985600,3,479,4.759036144578313
2222501,5,B0007N1BBC,"This miniseries...oh, man this miniseries. Brilliant, simply brilliant. Many, many years ago I fell in love with 1996's version of Jane Eyre and thought I would never find a period film that I loved as much. I was wrong. Dead wrong.

I'd been putting off watching North & South for a long time but yesterday afternoon I gave in and was glued to my television from the very beginning to the very end.

Margaret Hale is a beautiful, head strong, opinionated woman who's family has just been uprooted from the green lushness of the south by her father who's decided to leave the clergy. He takes Margaret and her mother north to a place that could not be more different than Margaret's beloved Helstone. The northern industrial town of Milton is dirty, busy, smoke-filled, rough and the air is constantly full of cotton fluff that comes from the cotton mills. To say that Margaret doesn't like Milton would be a bit of an understatement, and when she meets mill owner John Thornton her opinion of Milton only goes downhill.

Okay, let's talk about setting. The setting was almost visceral. Milton made me feel cold, wet and grimy while Helstone left me feeling like I wanted to lay down in some grass and nap in the sun all afternoon. The people of Milton are overworked and hungry. I felt like I was walking the streets of Milton with Margaret. I was thrown back in time and it was all so authentic the way a period film should be.

Characters. Richard Armitage who plays the mill owner John Thornton was the standout in this film. His brooding, strong and fair but tortured hero was a performance that everyone should see. The other characters were played excellently as well but Richard Armitage was simply divine.

Daniela Denby Ashe as Margaret Hale did stubborn but sympathetic so well. She may be my favorite female character that I've seen in every movie I've yet to see. She had beliefs and compassion. I admired that.

The love story. The train scene had me swooning and you'll know what I mean if you've watched the movie. I was rooting for Margaret and John to find their way to each other. I loved, loved, loved John and Margaret and I believed in their passion and love for each other.

One thing that I adore about period films is that the little things in the movie mean so much. The fleeting brush of fingers, the secret looks, the way a wealth of feeling can be expressed with one whispered word. North & South does that beautifully. Beautifully.

There is so much more that I want to say about this film but I would hate to ruin it for anyone else. So, the only other thing I will say that you should watch it. Forget any doubts you may have and watch it because it is an experience you won't soon forget.",1358812800,4,2721,4.516260162601626

2222507,4,B0007N1BBC,"The 4-part film adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's novel, North & South, is like Pride & Prejudice meets Hard Times and done almost effortlessly. In the same tradition of Jane Austen and the Bronte Sisters come John Thornton and Margaret Hale. Two different people from two different worlds who collide in industrial 1850s Milton, Manchester, England in the gritty, fast paced north versus Margaret's slower, insulated and utopian way of life in the south. Where first impressions are lasting but not forever.

John (brilliantly, wonderfully, acted by Richard Armitage) has come up from the dregs to build his cotton business in Milton but at the cost of being purely business minded and nothing else. He knows nothing else and because of it, is hard and harsh but bluntly honest and is as he appears. There is no artifice, no ego, only a will and his way--and to Margaret, at times unforgivable, especially his brutal treatment of his mill workers, who some she befriends. Margaret, though not rich by any means, is perceived as spoiled and haughty but in reality, she is just a young woman trying to accept her new lot in smog-tinged Milton and trying not to lose herself in the process. As a strike threatens the livelihood of John's business and family, so too does grim strife and struggles hit Margaret. Through interactions that color their understanding of each other, they battle in words and actions, and as a result, begin to truly learn more about each other and who each really is. And that they may have more in common than not.

What I loved about this eloquent BBC mini-series is the intoxicating, electric and smoldering tension between the leads, Richard Armitage and Daniela Denby-Ashe, as well as the supporting cast who lend exegetic information about our leads as well as give depth and richness to the overall story. Armitage is simply sublime in his nuanced rendering of a commanding, driven, secretly terrified but passionate John Thornton. His intense and brooding acting makes John Thornton a class in his own, as most want to compare him or declare him the 'New Mr. Darcy', when he is in fact a fantastic John Thornton. In Denby-Ashe, we have a Margaret who is both spirited, independent, vocal yet naive and just as terrified, but an equal match to John. While Denby-Ashe did a marvelous job, hands down, Armitage is clearly the one everyone will talk about.

Now, I have not read the novel (YET) and I prefer to read the book before seeing the adaptation, especially in classic novels though most productions tend to stay more true to the storyline than not. Because of that, reading the novel FIRST tends to enhance the experience of watching the movie because you know the little things that were left out and fill them in yourself as you watch. Also, seeing how actors play these characters, how production meets up to standards and how the director holds up his/her end of the bargain and doing the book justice is fun. The only issue I have with this adaptation is that the subcontext that exists in the book that wasn't present in the film. It seemed, at times, that the director and screen writer were relying more on us the audience to be familiar with the style (i.e. ala Austen) and romantic plot rather than fully showing us the development of their romance. The romance is predictable--that's the whole point. We know how it'll end, that's not the point, the point is how they get there and all the subtle ways they reveal their emotions toward each other. That said, the directing and editing was somewhat abrupt, especially in last two episodes, showing not enough but 'almost there' of their romance. I felt like I'd missed some key moments between John and Margaret that I should have seen, that is, their growing affections toward each other and WHY they begin to relate to each other and what bonds knit them closer to each other. We don't really see that. In some respects,  John's affections were much more clearly conveyed, developed and explained, and shown, than Margaret's, which sort of 'happens' for her in the last forty or so minutes of the fourth episode. The secondary plot about Margaret's brother wasn't neatly woven into the rest of the story and was sort of obvious, and as a result, rendered a bit useless and ineffective.

Am I being too picky? Maybe but I still LOVED this movie and it has become one of new favorites and must see/must haves. In terms of the social and industrial changes represented in the novel/film, it was fascinating and was a character in and of itself as well as part of John's personae too. However, I know very little of those times, especially the social aspect, but felt there was enough about it without overpowering the rest of the story. Don't judge this to Pride & Prejudice. North & South deserves its own cult following purely for the fact of a great movie and wonderful actors who brought rich, multi-layered characters to life. It was worth every penny, and the extras, including commentaries and interviews, were a delight. I will now be reading the book, then watching the movie again and seeing it in a whole other light...sigh.",1357862400,3,5133,4.782412626832018
2222508,5,B0007N1BBC,"Intrigued by reviews that promised this was more than a period-fluff piece, I thought this might aid in getting through the travails of the holiday season. But the first scenes featured ballroom dancing and several heaving bosoms; I had to tell myself and the other resident curmudgeon to give the thing a chance. We were amply rewarded. This is so densely packed with excellent acting and writing that it seems longer than it is, in a good way! Richard Armitage is perfection as John Thorton, the dour proprietor of Marlborough Mills, and Daniela Denby-Ashe strikes a fine balance as self-righteous young Margaret Hale. Sinead Cusack is remarkable as John's demanding, indomitable mother, wary of Margaret's misguided judgements. Edinburgh is a splendid backdrop as the northern mill town Milton, where Margaret and her hapless parents are exiled to. The landscape of steep, coal-stained streets and ghost-ridden graveyards lend depth to the story.

I do prefer the book's - more subtle, but more intense at the same time.

The story is very similar to Pride and Prejudice, except she seems to have all the pride and the prejudice. However, it tells so much more about what was going on at the time and has a good storyline going on with other characters.  I would call this more of a historical fiction, as it tells about the industry and strikes, and P&P (which I do love, as well)more of a classical romance story.",1356134400,,765,4.314685314685315

There have been male leads that have been excessively grumpy in a lot of movies, but few who showed the intensity of feeling here. Although I am not a 65 year old woman who becomes a groupie, Richard Armitage came as close as any man has ever done. In this movie, he did ALL his acting with his eyes and a tightly held knowledge that he was not whom he appeared. Under that harsh exterior beat the heart of a man deeply in love with no way of knowing how to show it. Daniela Denby-Ashe, who played a very loving and caring character, did an exceptional job of not quite knowing how to feel about him. Armitage's mother could have been any movie's nasty step-mother except little snatches kept showing through that showed she was actually doing what she thought was best for her son and to save their struggling business.

Being a great fan of British period dramas, I am surprised it took me this long to discover ""North and South"".

The story of ""North and South"" is both a love story as well as a story of class and industrialization. Margaret Hale (portrayed by the beautiful Daniela Denby-Ashe) is the lovely daughter of a clergyman, Richard (Tim Piggot-Smith) and his wife, Maria (Lesley Manville who also played Mrs. Rose in ""Cranford""). When her father breaks with the church over an issue of conscience, Margaret is forced to uproot from the idyllic southern town of Halston in Hampshire and move to the industrial town of Milton in Northern England. There the Hale family try to adjust - father Richard finds a job as a tutor and teacher, but mother Maria and Margaret find it more difficult to come to terms with the customs of the Northerners who seem a much coarser lot than the genteel Southerners. Plain speaking and independent-minded Margaret chafes at the strictures placed upon her sex and also comes to learn about the inequalities between the working classes and the mill owners.

This sets the stage for the clash between John Thornton (Richard Armitage in a magnificent performance), owner of a cotton mill and Margaret, whose first impression of Thornton is of a cruel and insensitive man who treats his employees abysmally. Sparks soon fly between the two though it is Thornton who feels the initial strong attraction to Margaret. Margaret is too overcome by her first impressions to really feel much for Thornton, and her developing friendship with a young mill worker and her father, Nicholas (played by pre-Downton Abbey's Brendan Coyle) further fractures the fragile relationship between Thornton and Margaret (Thornton becomes Richard's pupil, studying the classics and the two men form an affectionate friendship, despite Margaret's animosity towards Thornton). When Nicholas becomes a union leader, calling for a strike at all the cotton mills to fight for a raise and better working conditions, Thornton and Margaret clash even more.

Richard Armitage's performance as the brooding, proud cotton mill owner John Thornton reminded me of both Mr. Darcy of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pride-and-Prejudice/dp/1612930425/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pride and Prejudice</a>&nbsp;and Mr. Edward Rochester of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jane-Eyre-Signet-Classics/dp/0451526554/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jane Eyre (Signet Classics)</a>. Armitage delivers a credible and magnetic performance and the natural chemistry between Armitage and Daniela Denby-Ashe makes for riveting viewing! I could not take my eyes off the screen, especially when these two were engaged in heated conversation.

There's so many layers to this wonderfully-written production. There's romance, family tensions, class and gender issues, and many more. All of these are masterfully weaved into a production that not only looks beautiful (with a haunting score to boot) but also flows seamlessly. I watched all four episodes (Prime members get free streaming) in one sitting and plan to re-watch it again. There's much to savor here, and the love/hate relationship between Thornton and Margaret Hale anchors the story, making for a compelling and engaging viewing experience. This is truly a wonderful production and I am purchasing the DVD to add to my period drama collection.",1353801600,4,4348,6.427350427350428
2222531,5,B0007N1BBC,I absolutely loved it!  Highly recommended! Richard Armitage is great; I'm a big fan now. I understand why this is top rated.,1353801600,,125,4.681818181818182
2222532,5,B0007N1BBC,"""North and South"" is the powerful story of a sheltered clergyman's daughter uprooted from an idyllic home in the south of England to the gray and gritty north. There she clashes with a stern factory owner and befriends several millworkers as they protest the poor conditions and pay.

This mini-series has so much to recommend it, especially its leading man. Deep-voiced, hawkish Richard Armitage (who, I predict, will become the next Official British Dreamboat when ""The Hobbit"" is released) is masterful in his role as the industrialist. Even when his character, John Thornton, is inflexible, Armitage gives glimpses of the conflicted and honourable man beneath.  When he finally shows his tender side, it's swoonworthy.

(For a real appreciation of Armitage's range--and to see his great, cheeky, Daniel Radcliffey grin--I highly recommend viewing ""The Holy Wholly Happy  Ending"" episode of ""The Vicar of Dibley.""  He is the ideal Tall Handsome Stranger. He and the brilliant Dawn French are marvelous fun together).

While Armitage is a standout, he is backed by an amazing cast.  Tim Pigott-Smith and Sinead Cusack are excellent, as always, and Brendan Coyle--now best  known for his role as the valet in ""Downton Abbey""--brings real fire and contained fury as a union leader.

Sandy Welch (who wrote the fabulous Toby Stephens/Ruth Wilson version of ""Jane Eyre"") works wonders with the script, as do all involved in creating this 19th-century world. The scenes in the mill are especially beautifully photographed and haunting--the cotton fibers drifting through the interior look simultaneously like a magical blizzard and a white hell.

The one aspect of this series that wasn't superb is its lead, Daniela Denby-Ashe. While I liked her more on a second viewing, there is still something lacking in her perfomance. She physically looks the part--she has a dairy-maid complexion and a curvy, Victorian figure--and there are times when some spirit shows through.  However, there are several key scenes--including holding a dying girl and the grand finale--when she seems to just check out emotionally, and her reactions are bewilderingly placid. We need to see Margaret's spark and sparkle, even when she is subdued or contemplative, but sometimes Denby-Ashe just seems blank.

Despite Denby-Ashe's occasional tepid acting, I'm giving this production 5 stars because the series succeeds so beautifully in every other way.",1353801600,,2426,5.355263157894737

I especially enjoyed the intelligent and outspoken, for her time, Margaret Hale.  Not only does she recognize social injustice, she tries to do something about it by taking a stand and befriending some of the mill workers. She is a very modern woman for her time.  The man who gets in her way is cotton mill owner, John Thorton.  It's fascinating to watch how, little by little, she influences him, and he becomes a better man.  These are two complex characters that you will not tire of watching. I purchased the DVD so I could watch it whenever I wanted.  Sadly, it was stolen out of my mailbox before I could.

However, this ""dark"" backdrop makes the beauty of this love story even more brilliant. I was totally captivated by the storyline and superb acting. Even the annoying sister (of Mr Thornton), Fanny, played her role so well that I dislike her very much. There are so many interesting aspects playing out, from class divide & business, to religion & friendships. And sometimes, with surprising twists. Above all, the tension between Mr Thornton and Margaret is the most intriguing element of North and South, climaxing to a beautiful ending! I thoroughly enjoyed this mini series and will probably watch it again and again.",1350432000,2,795,5.03030303030303

I had already seen Mr. Armitage in other things--""Robin Hood"" and The Vicar of Dibley's ""Wholly Happy Ending"" and felt he was an astonishing talent (little did I know), but after watching this series, the only thing left for me to try to understand was why he wasn't already the biggest star in the world.  His portrayal of John Thornton reaches all the emotional levels one could wish, far surpassing the performance of Daniela Denby-Ashe in my humble opinion, and his scenes with his mother, played by Sinead Cusack, are pure magic.  One of the all time best of the British miniseries and makes me wish that we in America could do this kind of thing even half as well.",1348617600,4,816,4.575342465753424

I think she was wonderful in the character she played as Margaret Hale. I was disappointment that the episodes did not continue in season 1 past the forth episode four because I would have enjoyed more. Mr. Thornton shows also how easy that fortune can be lost.

This film had my interest from the beginning, however when Margaret walks into the room with cotton fluff floating through the air and sees Thornton severely overseeing the works. I was caught. The filming is breath taking. The director allows a relationship to develop between the actors and in turn as a member of the audience, I believed. The film feels more real than Pride and Prejudice, perhaps this is due to John Thornton's hard work and determination.  His love for Margaret seems more poignant as nothing comes easily to him. Like Margaret I grew to admire the difficult life and spirit of determination that prevails in the ""North"".  Also, like Margaret I fell in love. This breathtakingly passionate film has an ending that took my breath away with its gentle touch. It has left me yearning for more.

2222550,5,B0007N1BBC,"From the first time seeing this movie I was in love. The characters of Margaret Hale and John Thornton are intriguing and wonderful to see. The music is perhaps my favorite part of the movie. I am a huge fan of Martin Phipps and it is sad to see that not many of the movies for whom he composes have available soundtracks. North & South is a beautiful story of a young woman whose father moves the family to a northern town in England where she is confronted with the many differences between her former home and where she now finds herself living. At first she sees Milton as a cruel, cold and harsh place filled with money-loving people who care nothing for the workers in their workshops. But as her friendship with one of these men progresses, she is able to see some of the beauty of the town, and she begins to understand the character of the man she first knew to be unworthy of her friendliness.

I cant tell you how much Richard Armitage was made for the role of Thornton its like Gaskell reached into the future and based John Thornton on Richard! This movie was awesome and the chemistry between Richard and Daniela Denby was awesome!!! Its a win win for me because you get Richard Armitage and Downton Abbey's Brendan Coyle in the same movie!!

I fell in love with the book right after reading it- and then was skeptical if the film could live up to my expectations. But I think the movie was so well done- the character so well cast, the romance and the drama so deeply felt, that it improved on the book and has made this period film one of my favorite of all time. The story is not just romance- it is about character, principle, about making sacrifices to do the right thing, and is about what it means to be a truly worthy, and noble human being. Mostly, it is about love- with the strongest message being, that in a place where there is no love or sympathy for another human being, it is like the death of the human soul.  One of my favorite lines- at the end of episode one in Margaret's letter to Edith- after she has made a visit to the Miserable white-filled toxic, cotton-infested factory: ""I believe that G-d has forsaken Milton. I think I have seen hell, and it is White, Snow White."" The mention of G-d and hell in reference to the working conditions also help underline the central question of faith in the book, and seem to suggest that faith is less about following a doctrine than it is about moral character.

The acting, the story, the music, the use of the different color filters to depict the differences in the locations. A blue-grey filter for the harsh, hardness of Milton, and the rich full  spectrum filter for Halston and London. Perfect!  The story was wonderfully done and was realistic in the realities of  life in an industrial English town, but yet it wasn't overboard to bring a sense of depression and gloom to the entire production. I first saw that this was listed as a 'first season' type thing, then happily realized it really isn't a SHOW, just a mini-series of sorts. The movie is closed up beautifully at the end of the 4th installment. LOVED it, highly recommend it!  =) I'm going to look in my local library for the book, although I've heard the movie follows it very closely, and some scenes they added actually make the story smoother then the book originally had.

I am actually considering buying it!  And I only have boughten one other (well 3 actually) films - the Stieg Larsson trilogy.  I do have to point out, however, how closely the scene where Margaret refuses John is a direct take on the scene with Darcy and Elizabeth in P&P. I will now have to read the book to see if it is the same in the book, although as she lived almost at the same time as Jane Austen she can't have copied it, so it must be a popular theme of the time. Or another explanation is that the film production lifted the scene and dialogue for P&P. At any rate, it is very good. I love this film.",1337126400,,753,4.013333333333334

2222565,4,B0007N1BBC,"No, this is not about the United States vs. the Confederate States. This is the north and the south of England. Specifically, Margaret Hale, a vicar's daughter from the south, moves north with her parents when her father resigns his position over a matter of conscience. They move to Milltown, which is to say a cotton mill town, where lint from the cotton fills the air and the place is decidedly dreary. There her father takes up teaching.

John Thornton, tall, dark and handsome, owns and operates one of the mills. But he and Margaret get off on the wrong foot when she witnesses him beating up on a man who lit a pipe in the mill. Clearly, smoking is extraordinarily dangerous in a cotton mill, with all that lint in the air, but Margaret sees him as having an unreasonable temper.

Life in the north is drastically different from what Margaret knew in the south. But she never really liked London, and is open to learning to love the people she finds in Milltown. Specifically, her tender heart is touched by the plight of the workers, and becomes involved in their attempts to form a union.

One interesting aspect of the story is that Thornton is as pressured to conform by the other owners as the workers are by the union workers. Both sides insist that they must ""stick together."" Thornton is more enlightened than the other owners, but that's not saying much. He tries to get them interested in the idea that caring for the well-being of his workers is good business, as they work better and last longer. But there is also pressure from suppliers of cotton (America, Egypt, I don't remember it all) and from buyers.

This a four-part BBC miniseries, totaling about four hours, so there's lots of time to develop detailed sub-plots. Most of them add up to repeated misunderstandings between Margaret and Thornton. Of course they fall in love, and of course they both deny it.

There are also a lot of deaths in this story. Don't get too attached to any of the characters except Margaret Hale and John Thornton; they're dropping like flies!",1336694400,,2049,4.649171270718232

2222567,5,B0007N1BBC,"I watched this mini series last night and I was so disappointed when it was finished. Story is amazing in developing the characters, their personal growth, and the struggles and progress towards a modern future.

I think I fell in love with Mr. Thornton. He's a man of morals and righteousness. He's such a contrast to the other men in his station because his own struggle to get to the position where he is today. He's a man who respects his employees even though he sometimes struggles to see them as equals. But he knows that their happiness and ideas are the key to his success and their livelihood.

Can't help but adore Ms. Margret Hale. She's somewhat naive but of pure heart and good intentions. She struggles not to place judgment on the methods on the North but learns that there's much to be learned from them. After the loss of her mother and father she finds out that she has to let go of the South and its blissful ignorance. And in doing so, she finds love.

And then you Nicholas. A man who gives voice to those of the lower class in society. He's a honorable man who does not want to take advantage of the wealthy but fights to be given the chance to work hard, earn fair wages, and be respected as men. And he wants to dispel the belief that the lower class of society are uneducated savages. He fights with non-violence and smart strategies. Throughout the movie you can't help but root for him.

2222569,5,B0007N1BBC,"I bought this miniseries as part of the Elizabeth Gaskell Collection as a way to own all three cheaply, but I definitely want a North & South box on its own if ever there's a blu-ray release.  You know Mr. Thornton deserves to be seen in HD.  The first thing that struck me when I saw it is how it reminds me of Pride & Prejudice, yet being very different at the same time.  Biased preconception, culture clash, botched proposal - these are the similarities.  But the similarities quite end there.  North & South happens in a grittier, more tumultuous and progressive era.  People actually have important things to do and conflicts carry graver consequences.  Margaret's a less endearing character compared to Lizzy, but interesting nonetheless. And Mr. Thornton can rival with Mr. Darcy any day.  It's dark and moody, and yet it's incredibly romantic.  I also like it that the heroine does the rescuing at the end of the day.  Big big plus.
I've since read the novel as well and I can say the adaptation actually elevated Gaskell's writing.  No offense to Mrs. Gaskell, but I sure as heck did not formulate such vivid images as seen in the show when I read her words.  I sometimes felt swept away inside a scene due to the beautiful cinematography and haunting scores.  There are several little romantic moments from the book I wish I could see, but I think the script did a really good job of cutting and adding where it did to enhance the flow on screen (The genius line ""Look back, look back at me"" wasn't from the book).",1334102400,4,1525,4.542124542124542
2222570,5,B0007N1BBC,"Based on the book by Elizabeth Gaskell and set in the 1850s of Victorian England, North and South is a story with some strong similarities to Pride and Prejudice. After losing his faith, Margaret's preacher father moves his wife and daughter form bucolic south England to its industrial north, where he earns his living teaching. Initially the transition is hard on Margaret, but though she doesn't have Elizabeth Bennet's sense of humor, she does have her intelligence and determination, and she begins to make the best of her situation. When she first meets factory owner John Thornton she's shocked by the roughness of his actions and the haughtiness of his demeanor, but that gradually changes as she learns more about him, and about the manners and customs of the north. As in Pride and Prejudice, there's a badly botched marriage proposal and both characters ultimately have a positive effect on each other.

2222572,3,B0007N1BBC,"A triple D series.  I found North and South to be dark, dreary, and depressing.  Colors, scenes, were all in dark colors.  The acting was great, characters mostly developed, moral plot was contradictory.  I won't be keeping this to view again.  The best part was the ending.  It did end on an upbeat note, but did not make up for the hours of dark, dreary, and depressing.

The Socialist movement for fairness has taken the poor worker from grinding poverty to a place with perks and pensions that could not have been imagined 100 years ago.",1332547200,3,541,4.572916666666667
2222573,5,B0007N1BBC,"I just loved the miniseries! Although I have not read the book, I trust BBC to have created a historically true and accurate adaptation. The romance story line I enjoyed the most - it reminded me of Jane Austin's eternal novel Pride and Prejudice. The last minutes of the film are unbelievably emotional, I had to watch it several times! The actor's play is very good and I greatly enjoyed the character's presentation by Richard Armitage and Daniela Denby-Ashe.",1332201600,,462,4.860759493670886
2222574,5,B0007N1BBC,Reminds me of Pride and Prejudice which is also a great BBC movie.  I find I need to watch these kinds a movies several times to understand the meaning behind some of the actions.,1331683200,3,179,4.264705882352941
2222575,5,B0007N1BBC,"I've watched many period dramas, and this one stands out in its appeal for people whether romantics or not.  This one is based on Elizabeth Gaskell's novel _North and South_.  It has romantic elements without having romance as the singular basis for its appeal.

For viewers not so sold on romance, there is drama involving life's stages; social complexity of rich magnates vs. poor working class; questions of justice and fairness in legal situations (i.e. Fred's situation of having to live in Spain for fear of being hanged).  There is humor with the characters of Dixon and Fanny.  There are true to life transitions of two people overcoming their differences for the reward that is in their sameness.  All of these and more contribute to the opportunities for relatedness in this story.

Other favorite aspects of this movie are the screenplay and the casting.  If I look too closely at the direction of some scenes, I notice that there is usually filming either very close to the subject or very far away, not as much in between.  My personal opinion is that more ""in between"" would've made the movie even better, but I do make it a point not to be distracted by something like that.  The story is easy to get lost in, and I always do.

Special features include deleted scenes, an interview with Richard Armitage who plays Mr. Thornton, commentary etc.
Clearly this already has a lot of recommendation.  I will add my comment to agree with all the others, and to record the approval of movies well made.",1331596800,4,1509,4.717557251908397
2222576,5,B0007N1BBC,"I just discovered this 2004 BBC television adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's novel.  The actors are superb and the story is told truthfully, but eloquently!  Highly recommend this DVD set.  Richard Armitage and Daniela Denby Ashe have the best chemistry and you will not be disappointed.",1331424000,2,287,5.333333333333333
2222577,5,B0007N1BBC,"This is a magnificently put together production. After watching the series, I decided to read the book, and while I thoroughly enjoyed it, I gained a real appreciation of script writer Sandy Welch's talents. Elizabeth Gaskell never had the opportunity to develop North & South to the extent that she wanted, but I have no doubt that she would have been extremely pleased with Welch's interpretation. She adds so many wonderful elements to the story, with the most remarkable being the ending, of course. I must admit that I was a bit disappointed with the novel's conclusion, as it ended rather hastily, making it seem unpolished, whereas the end of the miniseries brings the story full circle in such a spectacular way. Sure, some have criticized it for being un-Victorian, but it is intended for a modern audience. Had the ending been in keeping with Victorian traditions, it would not be as memorable, and I certainly don't think I'd want to watch those last 5 minutes over and over again, as I have countless times already.

Whoever did the casting for this production is a sheer genius. Everyone was cast absolutely perfectly. Of course, what is there left to say about Richard Armitage as John Thornton? The man is a brilliant actor and it is easy to see how he has amassed an army of loyal female fans. I am certainly looking forward to seeing more of him onscreen. I thought Daniela Denby-Ashe was exquisite in the role of Margaret Hale, and the more I watch the movie, the more I appreciate her fine acting talents. I looked to see what else I may watch her in, but unfortunately I could not find much accessible. I have just started watching Downtown Abbey and was delighted to find Brendan Coyle, who plays Nicholas Higgins in North & South, in it. He is simply a joy to watch. Of course, Sinad Cusack was fabulous as Mrs. Thornton, and I can just go on and on. I actually feel a bit guilty not naming all of the fine actors in this miniseries because everyone brought some magic to the table. The behind the scenes folks should also be applauded, from the director and producer, to the set designers, to the costume designers and make-up folks. A lot of love and thought went into this miniseries and it shows.

In summation, this miniseries is a must-watch, and I do think that many men would enjoy it as well, as this story has so many layers beyond its evolving love story. As for the DVD itself, I definitely recommend it. I received it one Christmas, but never found the opportunity to watch it. I was reminded of this series again when I finally saw it was available on Netflix, and a few days after watching it through, I finally cracked open my DVD because I wanted to soak it all in again. I am glad that I did. The version that streams on Netflix cuts out or shortens a few scenes. While this does not necessarily detract from the story, you do miss out on some interesting scenes and perspectives. The DVD also has some nice bonus features, including a narrated first and fourth chapter, where you gain interesting insights into how and where scenes were shot and what transpired during filming. You also have access to the deleted scenes and an interview with Richard Armitage.",1331337600,4,3201,4.604203152364273
2222578,5,B0007N1BBC,"This is a great film about the cultural clash between the land owning nobility and the rising merchant class. The love story was also very enjoyable and gives you that Jane Austen feeling of ""longing."" The acting was great too.",1330905600,2,227,4.7
2222579,5,B0007N1BBC,"In my opinion this should surely go down as one of the great classic period pieces.  I loved this mini series.  It is well rounded with true to life conflicts.  It deals with relationships between parents & children, siblings, friendships, trust, strengths, weekness and of course love.  It does not contain a lot of mushie gushie romance, so I can't classify it as only a chick flick, I believe men will enjoy it too.  The only thing I would have different is the last look on the leading lady's face.  I'm not giving anything away, it is a must see if you like period piece films...",1330473600,4,584,4.462264150943396

2222581,5,B0007N1BBC,"I bought this in 2006, when I was a freshman in college, and it arrived the day before a psychology test. Needless to say, I watched all of this, the second half on my computer in my dorm's ironing room because it was after midnight and my roommate insisted on getting to sleep. Forget the psych test, I was doomed. I was in love! I watched it again and again...and was able to convince a few friends to watch it with me, including a rousing 4th of July marathon.  These days, I don't watch it as much as I used to watch it, but I still love it.

Now, let me tell you why...It is a beautifully adapted story with excellent acting.  The story reminded me a lot of Pride and Predjudice, but it was different enough to love its uniqueness. John Thornton is a very interesting character with a lot of pride and Richard Armitage is not only delicious as Mr. Thornton, but he excellently portrays this sort of dark but not really character. As for Margaret, Daniela Denby-Ashe does a great job showing all the qualities and changes of this characters.  The supporting cast is excellent.  The story seems a lot darker and somewhat political compared to Pride and Predjudice, and it has very depressing parts, but it shows a very believable and passionate story.

That last scene...oh my! One of my favorites of all times!",1330128000,4,1314,4.5
2222582,5,B0007N1BBC,"I watched this series a day after finishing the book. Although it did change some parts of the book and skip others, on the whole it sticks very close to the book, both in its portrayal of the scenes in the book and in its preserving the book's mood and messages.

Daniela Denby-Ashe was certainly not how I imagined Margaret physically, but she did a superb job of playing her exactly as she was personality-wise in the book. Richard Armitage was also a great (and handsome) Mr. Thornton. Sin&eacute;ad Cusack was also great in portraying a mother who above all else loves her son and cares only for his happiness, no matter what enemies she has to make.

The music was also good and some scenes were absolutely brilliant. The ""I believe I have seen hell, and it's white. Snow white."" from the ending of episode one, for instance, was so haunting and beautiful that I know it is a scene I will always remember. It is an example of where the series, when departing from the book, mostly added to the story. I strongly suggest youtubing ""North and South white hell"" and watching the scene. Hopefully watching it will encourage you to watch the rest of the series as well.",1328313600,,1170,4.540284360189573

This movie shows what true love, romance and passion really is. It comes form the heart and soul.  John Thornton falls in love with Margaret Hale for exactly who she is flaws and all.  Even when he is not pleased with her you can still see his love for her in his eyes.  Every women would love to have a man look at her like that through the good times and not so good times.  John Armitage is PERFECT as John Thornton.  Mr. Armitage is very handsome and has ""Presence"".  His facial expressions are priceless.  Even when Mr. Thornton is brooding he looks sexy.  I now have a huge crush on Richard Armitage.  There is not a single sex scene in this movie but to me it is one of the sexiest movies ever.  It proves that you don't need to strip down naked to show a movie about love and romance.  Daniela Denby-Ashe is perfect as Margaret and I jump for joy when she finally falls in love with John Thornton.  I wish the movie did not ened when it did though.  I would have loved to see John and Margaret getting married.  I liked John's mother very much even though she was so stiff and hard.  She did have heart underneath all that toughness.  Someone needs to start a BBC North & South fanclub and a bunch of us can start calling for a continuation of this beautiful love story by the BBC.",1327276800,6,1413,4.174074074074074
2222587,5,B0007N1BBC,"If you have read the book NORTH AND SOUTH, you know it is a complex story with unusual characters that has a spirit about it that might be hard to capture on film.  The book also highlights issues that could easily be too melodramatic or reductive when portrayed in a movie.  Even the character of John Thornton, the mill owner who is tough but tender, or Margaret who is compassionate but steely, are so nuanced they could easily be portrayed incorrectly.  However, this film captures the layers and nuances of characters and issues without being maudlin.  It also reflects the spirit of the book.  You felt as if the book had come alive in many instances.

Rarely do I fall for the leading man.  Clark Gable in GONE WITH THE WIND I think is the last one and have been looking for another ever since.  John Thornton in this movie is amazing.  If you like love stories, he's a character worth falling for.  But this movie is so much more than a love story as it talks about social issues: factory workers, mills and the challenges of being a mill owner.  It has a Dickensian-cast highlighting these relationships and it's not all black and white.  You LIKE the mill owner.

This is a delicious film which successfully brings a book to life and is worth watching.",1327276800,4,1262,4.530973451327434

2222590,5,B0007N1BBC,"I added this to my Netflix queue on a whim. I was hankering for some period drama/romance and craved something new aside from my go-to Austen. I went into North and South completely blind. I popped in the DVD on a random week night and stayed up to watch the first two episodes, then wanted to tear my hair out because I couldn't watch them all in a row. I have since seen all 4 parts (I made my friend watch it with me)and it was the most beautiful, tragic, moving love story I have seen in years. The last 15 minutes makes watching all of the painful struggles and hardships the characters go through worth it. The train scene made me cry more than once. It is one of those gooseflesh inducing scenes that you'll never forget. The soundtrack (which is equally beautiful and haunting) will get stuck in your head.

North and South is a must for any period romance fan. It now holds a special place in my heart and on my DVD shelf. Richard Armitage is handsome, brooding(much too good for Miss Hale) and  quite possibly my new *movie boyfriend*, while Daniela Denby-Ashe is the perfect Margret Hale, idealistic, bold, likable and flawed. The supporting cast is wonderful and the scenery manages to make the dirt and grit of an industrial town seem poetic.

I thought it might be a girly 1800's romance but there was so much depth to the story, so much more going on then just two people falling for each other. There was gloom, and hardship, and oppression and heartbreak and struggle and everything you could imagine in an industrial town. And then mixed in were politics, and social rules, and then love.
I simply can not praise this piece enough. When it was over I felt like I had sat in the Sistine Chapel for four hours, it really is art on every level. Film art, music art, story art. It really has everything.
I've been listening to the soundtrack for 2 days now and started the book last night which is so far just as good.

I haven't read the book (though it's now on my list of books I want to read) but my daughter-in-law has.  She says this adaptation changes the original story pretty radically. It sounds like the people who made this novel into a movie took all the charm out of it by assuming modern viewers wouldn't understand a woman who couldn't love a man because he wasn't a ""gentleman"".  Of course, it is the historically accurate details that make novels like these so wonderful--such as the BBC's ""Cranford"" (2007), which is another E Gaskill novel adapted for television.  I had hoped this would be like ""Cranford"", but it is nothing like that quality.  Or, like the adaptations from the Jane Austen novels, which are filled with references to beliefs and behavior that are now archaic, but since the adaptations are true to the novel, the novel's great truths come through.",1325030400,6,1068,4.927374301675978

2222616,4,B0007N1BBC,"The first time I watched this I LOVED it. The second time, it was good. The third time, Margaret really got on my nerves. She is cold, doesn't take responsibility for her actions, strings men along, and doesn't seem to mind hurting her parent's feelings. I almost think the relationship between Higgins and Thornton is better written. You at least understand why they like and respect each other.

The cinematography is great and so is the acting. The music is pretty. Thornton is such a hearthrob (move over Mr. Darcy), but the Hale family dynamics are not well done and it really is a sticking point after the first viewing. The ending scene at the train station is romantic until you start to wonder why Margaret is looking out the window instead of at the man she loves. It was anachronistic, yes, but that can be over-looked.

It's still a good mini-series, but it could have been a great mini-series by having less deaths, and a heroine who lightened up at the end. You would think everything that happens would be humbling to Margaret, but she is just as superior and arrogant at the end as at the begining.

2222617,5,B0007N1BBC,"So I popped NORTH & SOUTH into my DVD player, and imagine my surprise when scenes of the American Civil War failed to appear on the screen. This is instead the BBC adaptation of the classic novel by 19th century author Elizabeth Gaskell. And while there are no Johnny Rebs or Patrick Swayzes lurking about, there is a union. There is even a skirmish of sorts engaged between calculating factory owners and despairing laborers on strike. Nothing about any of that would lead you to believe that this is one of them timeless romances over which girls tend to swoon. But I haven't yet mentioned Margaret Hale, brought to life vividly by a marvelous actress named Daniela Denby-Ashe.

Temporarily put aside the love story, and the central theme would revolve around the bridging of the social divide in the Victorian era. Margaret Hale, our young heroine, finds it difficult to adapt to her unfamiliar new environs. Torn from her priveleged life in bucolic southern England, she eyes the booming industrial northern town of Milton and sees much that disgusts her: the squalor, the furor, the common folk's open hostility, that air of desperation. Absorbing her particular scorn is sullen local mill owner John Thornton (Richard Armitage) whose abusive treatment of an employee instantly prejudices Margaret against him. Imagine her distaste when she learns that John Thornton is her minister father's new pupil in the Classics. Right about now, you're perhaps sensing echoes of Austen's PRIDE & PREJUDICE. And there is a parallel to how the romance in both novels plays out. Except that NORTH & SOUTH commands even more of an investment into the story. PRIDE & PREJUDICE is fraught with wit and lightheartedness. NORTH & SOUTH is bleaker and more somber and offers deeper insight into the socioeconomic and cultural conditions of its time and place. Side characters such as Thornton's stern Yorkshire-accented mother (Sinad Cusack) and Nicholas Higgins (Brendan Coyle), the passionate union leader, are crucial to plot development.

Period dramas aren't normally in my wheel house. To me, a Bront is a kind of dinosaur and a Hawthorne is a cancelled show on TNT. But I think Jane Austen crosses all barriers, and I find her more accessible than Dickens. Somewhere in the ether, Elizabeth Gaskell may resent hearing this, but if not for Jane Austen, I wouldn't even come near a Gaskell adaptation. The BBC teleplay, told in four episodes, somehow draws me into its tale of labor strikes and factory closures, elements which in any other story would render me not giving an ef. But the union stuff works because it serves as a backdrop to Margaret and Thornton's tempestuous yet understated romance. Class distinction is pretty much the crux of the conflict between the two central characters. That, and a misunderstanding involving Margaret's fugitive brother.

Margaret is someone who doesn't bow down to conventions. An outsider to Milton, she doesn't hesitate to befriend those beneath her social status. Her ties to both the ruling and working classes lend her a unique perspective. Her outspoken nature incenses Thornton. But it also intrigues him. Thornton's mother isn't so conflicted. She straight up loathes Margaret.

One step forward. Two steps back. That sums up Margaret and Thornton's relationship. Daniela Denby-Ashe and Richard Armitage strike a spark and keep it lit. Denby-Ashe breathes life into Margaret, a modern girl trapped in a Victorian era corset, a restricting happenstance she shares with the equally independent Miss Elizabeth Bennett. Margaret doesn't shy away from speaking her own mind. As Denby-Ashe comments in the DVD's production notes, Margaret boldly looks people in the eye when she converses with them, an act which women in those days generally tend to not do. Meanwhile, Richard Armitage's superpower must be scowling. He lends a brooding intensity to his character, and first impressions would dictate that his character must be a tyrannical master who subjects his worker to abuse. Except that each progressive episode peels away another layer of his character, reveals his sensitivity and innate decency and awful loneliness. The moments in episode 4 in which Thornton shares the dinner table with Mr. Higgins and his other employees are understated but pretty moving. NORTH & SOUTH runs for four hours, not that you feel the length. I haven't read the book, but I venture to say that this is one of the finest adaptations ever put to screen. The production values are convincing and immersive. The screenplay is absorbing. The acting is stellar. In a bloody face-off between these two NORTH & SOUTH mini-series, Patrick Swayze just wilted under one of Richard Armitage's unconvivial scowls.

Special features: audio commentary on episodes 1 & 4 with producer Kate Bartlett, director Brian Percival and screenplay writer Sandy Welch; an interview with Richard Armitage (00:11:30 minutes long); 5 Deleted Scenes, including an extended proposal scene (00:11:38 minutes long); cast biographies with an in-depth look into the actors' roles in NORTH & SOUTH; and production notes.",1315785600,14,5115,5.1727053140096615

2222620,5,B0007N1BBC,"Before I watched this series, I had no idea that passing a tea cup or shaking someone's hand could be so romantic, but man was I wrong!
Daniela Denby-Ashe is very beautiful and she plays her role perfectly, when I think of North and South, I picture (besides the ending scene) her laying in a field of grass with the sun on her face looking positively peaceful; her view of Helston is the image of innocence, and this scene fantastically captures that feeling.
Richard Armitage has got to be the most handsome man alive! The book makes John Thornton sound near-perfect but BBC made the best possible choice when casting Armitage. He plays the role of a hard, chiseled factory master who has a soft side for philosophy and history. When Mr. Hale and his family move to Milton, Thornton begins having lessons with him and the two become friends; Margaret sits in on these lessons and she and Thornton have numerous arguments because they cannot see eye-to-eye with another.
This story is not only the most romantic movie I've ever seen, but its message to the viewers is powerful. We grow to love the characters as if they were actually friends rather than stars on a movie screen.
Once you have watched the movie and you love it (and you WILL love it) you must check out the book by Elizabeth Gaskell, it's even better than the series, which is saying a lot!

This movie had a terrific balance in regards to several social issues. Unions and its affect upon both the workers and owners was handled with great care to both sides of this controversial issue.  Even the issue of the parson's stand against doctrines he felt he could no longer support was handled with great integrity.  These social struggles make John and Margaret the characters they are and they antagonize each other, mostly unintentionally, as she struggles to fit into this new town of manufacturing and the people who live there.  Armitage and Denby-Ashe have a charisma on the screen that has the viewer captivated through all four episodes. The supporting cast also added great depth.

2222626,5,B0007N1BBC,"I watched this not really knowing what to expect.  All I knew was that it was a BBC historical drama/romance.  I am SO GLAD that I watched it.  I love it just as much as the BBC production of Pride & Prejudice (the one with Colin Firth)-and that is saying something since I LOVED LOVED LOVED that miniseries.  Well, this one is a bit more dramatic.
  Basically, its a love story that takes place between two people who are very very very very different.  Margaret Hale goes with her family to the North to an Industrial town filled with factories.  There she meets John Thornton (played by the swoon-worthy Richard Armitage).  She dislikes how he runs his cotton mill, and doesn't hesitate to tell him.  Over the course of the miniseries he starts to fall for her and thinks he isn't good enough for her high morals and values.  As their relationship changes, so does the town.  The mill workers go on strike.  There is some violence on both sides.
  I just LOVE this miniseries.  The acting was fantastic.  This miniseries brought the amazing actor Richard Armitage to my attention.  So now Mr. Thornton has a place right next to Mr. Darcy (sigh).  Okay, no more gushing, but seriously, this is amazing!  I definitely recommend it.  Don't be put off by the slow pacing in the beginning, it gets so much better and the pace does pick up.

ENJOY :)",1313971200,4,1347,4.525
2222627,5,B0007N1BBC,"North & South is a tale of people shaped by a time and place. There is first Margaret Hale, the compassionate, strong willed daughter of a country churchman; Mr. Hale, the aforementioned former pastor who, moved by doubt and conscience, resigns his post in the rural south of England and moves his family to the bleak, northern industrial town of Milton; John Thornton, stern-faced master of a cotton mill who, driven by family tragedy, strives to maximize the ever important bottom line without destroying his workers in the process -- all for the sake of the business, of course; Mrs. Thornton, John's mother, who is as fierce an advocate for her son as she is a ruthless capitalist; Nicholas, the determined union boss who sees the need -- and opportunity -- for improvement; his daughter, Bess, who has paid the ultimate price for the industrial revolution; etc.

This is very much a human story, a story of people separated by a vast chasm of varied experience and situation, who must, through bitter trial and even at times against their will, come to recognize at least a modicum of virtue in their fellow man's opposing viewpoint. Thus, as it begins, to Mr. Thornton the smoker who endangers the entire mill and its hundreds of workers by smoking amidst highly flammable conditions, is a threat who must be dealt with expeditiously and fiercely; to Miss Hale, he is an unarmed man who daren't defend himself, and the beating of him is an exercise in excess and cruelty. To Nicholas and his fellow mill workers, the master's claim that there is no money to meet their demands is proof of duplicity and further abuse; and, to Mr. Thornton, it is the reality of his world. There are at work in this film several competing factors -- the generous nature of slow, easy-going rural life contrasted with the cold realities of a fast, hard industrial world; the bottom line for a business as opposed to the comfort and welfare of its employees; even the moderate climate of the south versus the chill of the north.

As these many, competing themes come into play, friendships are formed, lives are destroyed, hearts are broken, and life goes on as it always has. This is a story of people in the midst of turmoil. It is bleak, terrible and hopeless at points; and for all that it probably ends on too optimistic a note to ring wholly true. But that is not a bad thing -- after portraying so much suffering and pain, it is a relief to have a happy ending (or as happy as one can expect, given the circumstances).

This is a phenomenal series; the story is, as you may have guessed from my description thus far, agonizingly good, but the screenplay, acting, costumes and settings are all perfect. The two main stars are phenomenal, but so too are the supporting characters; everyone becomes who he or she is supposed to be. 5/5 stars -- a great story perfectly executed",1313452800,5,2867,4.66205533596838

The two leads are very natural, and really own their characters. Especially the lead dude, who is refreshingly more than a cliche handsome guy insert. He's an intelligent, intimidating business man who starts off giving the worst first impression in history, which makes it so much harder for the heroine to come around to him. There is also a political sub plot about unions and working conditions of that era. This created a big philosophical rift between the heroine and hero. It was also intriguing, because it's a look at a unique place and time in English history. Overall, it's an impressive, entertaining accomplishment.",1312416000,2,809,4.827338129496403

2222632,5,B0007N1BBC,"I'm not sure what I can add to the overwhelming response to this film that hasn't already been said other than I wish I could give it more stars. I felt compelled (because I've never written a review on Amazon before) to add my voice to the chorus of overwhelming praise for this production.

Like many, I have never read Elizabeth Gaskell's book (but plan to do so in the future) and like many I was up one night searching for a movie to watch since movies are my passion. I had just finished watching Wives and Daughters on Netflix and felt it was a decent production. I kept seeing the cover for North and South on Netflix as well and for some reason wasn't interested in viewing it even after reading the summary. I finally broke down a few nights ago and all I can say is Wow!! I love great storytelling above all else but especially coupled with a love story. This movie is the blueprint of what a great production should be on every single level. Every actor was perfectly cast, the music was so romantically beautiful, the costumes were superb and the cinematography and production design were outstanding. This is definitely the benchmark for every production to work towards.

But if you need more convincing, then by far the one single reason to view this movie is to watch Richard Armitage bring the character of John Thornton to life. The moment you see him on screen he commands your attention. He was so very powerful in his performance that I believed he really was John Thornton living and breathing, just like Clark Gable was the embodiment of Rhett Butler. RA is what truly puts this movie in the stratosphere of greatness. Needless to say like everyone else I am a huge Pride and Prejudice fan (especially Colin Firth and Matthew MacFadyen versions). But, RA's portrayal of John Thornton puts him almost in a class by himself, which is saying something. I'm now trying to consume everything Richard Armitage appears in, because I know without a doubt he will be faultless in his performance.

So, to sum up, if you love period pieces and love stories, this movie is truly a no brainer on all levels. If you are someone who takes great pains to avoid watching costume dramas or love stories all I can say is, I strongly suggest that you take a look at this production you will not be sorry. It's storytelling at its best!

On a final note, I wish there were more avenues to see all the wonderful British productions that I always seem to stumble upon one way or another. Every time I do, they are usually superb and different from what we experience here in the U.S. If it wasn't for Netflix I would probably never have seen this marvelous production.",1312329600,5,2670,4.544698544698544

2222651,5,B0007N1BBC,"Richard Armitage makes this series. He is  the perfect choice for the character who, in the book, is forceful, masterful, hard, and capable of great love for one woman. He is also a loving son and a kind brother.

I felt that many people could have played Margaret Hale, and was not too enamored of the actress. She did an okay job acting wise but the character she portrayed to those who read the book is not up to par.  In the book, Margaret, eighteen or nineteen, is often described as queenly, noble, dignified, restrained; she is the softened female version of the masterful Thornton.  You can see her in her middle age becoming like his mother, loving and tough (of course, not as tough as he is). I don't see those qualities in this actress. But it's not a terrible choice. It works. The actress does have the large expressive eyes that Gaskell refers to, and the beautiful mouth.

I was not quite sure why she refused his proposal.  The series did not make it clear enough. The book, of which I have read about half, makes it plain. After she showed her love for him in front of all the world by throwing her arms around him to protect him from the mob, she was ashamed and embarrassed. For those times, that was forward and un-maidenly conduct. So when he came to propose, she felt that he was presuming. She wanted to show him she was not so easily gotten. That's not how she puts it to herself, because she does love him. Her conscious rationale is that she does not love him and that she would have thrown her arms around anyone.

Armitage is perfection, as he stalks about frowning. When we and Margaret first meet John Thornton, he is beating the you know what out of some worker. That is not in the book, but it is a master stroke by the series' producers. At one point in the series, Margaret is feeling that Milton is ""hell"" and then we see John, as if there is a link between him and that place. Thornton, in the series, continually has an air of suppressed violence and restrained passion. Seems like he could do anything at any moment - but he won't. And therein lies the secret of the attraction of the alpha male in fiction. Edward could drink Bella's blood, but he won't. What we want is restrained violence. Why such a character is so devastatingly attractive even in this feminist age (and the more liberated we become, the more the fictional male becomes like that, it's the secret to the success of British historical dramas), I will leave to psychologists to explain.",1306972800,8,2495,4.458333333333333

I can only say I added this DVD to another purchase (which was Pride & Prejudice 2005) because it kept popping up--period drama, BBC...reviews kept saying it wasn't about the Civil War. I could not figure out how North & South BBC could have 5 stars in the majority of the reviews. I mean really!  Didn't watch it for 2 months. Then one night at 10:00 pm I dropped it in the dvd player.  I had no idea it was 4 hours long! Thought I would watch about an hour and a half and watch the rest the next night or when I had time.

The first 20 minutes or so I'm thinking why is this so great.  Then, It happened. I was hooked and 3-1/2 hours later, and several rewatches of key scenes I had to tear myself away from the tv to go to bed.

I can't tell you how many times I've watched N&S.  The story draws you in. It is better not to watch clips on the internet, rather get the whole effect, like I did, from beginning to end. At the first viewing I had reservations about some parts and interpretations and it took two or three times watching the full dvd to absorb and think about the story line.  North & South is not just a love story, it has depth, complications, social tension, winding several stories around life during the industrial revolution in the mid 1800s in England. There is so much that goes on in the 4 hours of viewing that one needed the end for closure.  It blew P&P (all of them) out of the water!

2222653,5,B0007N1BBC,"I've always admired the way Victorian England is used so effectively in British TV series and nowhere is this more evident than in NORTH AND SOUTH, the story of relationships between different classes in British society during the 1850s.

The story itself bears a strong resemblance to Charlotte Bronte's work, SHIRLEY, a novel that dealt largely with strikes and mill owners. Since Elizabeth Gaskell was a good friend of Charlotte Bronte, it's no wonder that her story deals with some of the same customs and values as Bronte's work.

RICHARD ARMITAGE, whose very image conjurs up remembrance of Laurence Olivier's Heathcliff in ""Wuthering Heights,"" has a glowering presence and uses it to portray the hard-working mill owner who has to bear down on his workers when it looks as though his cotton mill is about to face a strike. He makes an unfavorable impression on the heroine of the story, played assuredly by DANIELA DENBY-ASHE, who has come north with her family to relocate in a climate and atmosphere not particularly to her liking.

The story delves into the conflicts in many relationships, but keeps the central focus on the intense attraction between the two main characters despite their differences. SINEAD CUSACK as the man's shrewdly possessive mother gives a sharp characterization and TIM PIGOTT-SMITH as the girl's dignified father and BRENDAN COYLE as a rough mill worker are excellent in colorful supporting roles. The entire cast gets into the spirit of the drama and contribute to the uniformly fine quality of the acting.

For romantics who pine over Victorian romance, surely this is one of the best of its kind with production values in costumes and settings that cannot be bettered. A viewer is certain to want to see more of Gaskell's work brought to the screen after the successful transition of this full-blooded character study.",1306108800,5,1859,5.045602605863192

I would give this movie 10 stars if I could -- the story is superb, the acting is wonderful and oh my, Armitage is such a hunk! I fell in love with the characters and there was no boring moment. There was even one very tender scene near the end that I had to go back to over and over (at the train stop when finally his love was reciprocated by a sweet kiss on his hand)... it makes you remember that love is such a beautiful thing. I never thought there could be another movie I could love as much as Pride and Prejudice, but this one is definitely in that level. If you love Jane Austen's stories, this comes highly recommended! Of course, the ending is a HAPPY one. :)",1304467200,6,785,4.103896103896104

Richard Armitage, Made this movie.. Its so hard not to fall in love with him. Daniela Denby-Ashe looked almost angelic.

2222663,5,B0007N1BBC,"I have become addicted to BBC dramas because they always deliver quality entertainment and I get to see real actors and not these surgically enhanced nitwits who so many of today's filmgoers love and admire.

This four part adaption of an Elizabeth Gaskell novel stars Richard Armitage as John Thornton and from the moment this man shows up on screen you are mesmerized with his character, who starts out very austere and cold, yet as the story progresses he changes and it is amazing to watch the transformation. The heroine Margaret Hale lives a quiet idyllic life in the Southern part of England until one day her father who is a minister decides to uproot Margaret and her mother and their servant to the industrial Northern part of England to settle some internal anguish he is dealing with regarding his faith. The mother and servant can not acclimate to the gritty and impoverished village where the main employer is John Thornton and his mother who run the cotton mill. Sinead Cusack is brilliant as the no-nonsense mother who loves and supports her son yet barely tolerates her frivolous daughter. The initial meeting between John and Margaret is during a beatdown where he is shown thrashing an employee for smoking in the cotton mill which was apparently quite a dangerous thing back then. The next several interactions between them only create a further wedge and it seems that they will never agree on anything much less connect as a couple.

Previously, Pride & Prejudice (1995) was the miniseries I held above all others, but North & South is just extraordinary. It has a richer, more gritty backdrop than P&P and the romance (though similar in arc) is more realistic and sensual. Daniela Denby-Ashe & Richard Armitage give perfect, passionate performances and the supporting cast is wonderful as well. And the music! I'm sorry to hear that there is no soundtrack available for purchase, because this score is truly powerful and epic. Just a brilliant production in every way.

The liberties that were taken for the movie somewhat diminshed the story for me, I hate when that happens.",1299801600,2,368,4.318840579710145
2222670,2,B0007N1BBC,"This miniseries let me down. My friend recommended ""Wives and Daughters"" to me, which I watched and LOVED, and then she told me about this one, claiming it was even better. I highly disagree with that. Maybe if I had gone into it unprejudiced and with a more open mind, it would have been better. I haven't read the book yet. Also, I watched the whole thing in one sitting; not saying that's a better or worse way to watch a miniseries, but I'm sure it contributed to my frustrations which are [spoiler alert!!!!!!]:

1. While I definitely think Ms. Denby-Ashe is a beautiful woman, I must say that it felt like at least half the shots in the film were closeups of her being pensive and mystical. I don't know whether I should critique the character, the cinematography, the directing, or the acting - because honestly it could have been a combination of all those factors. All I know is that I got sick of looking at her looking melancholy.

2. I don't ""get"" why Thornton is so dreamy. He's almost literally scowling the entire time until the very last scene! Not to mention he totally beats a man! It was hard to get over that for me, and start liking him as a person. I ""get"" that he did it for the good of the mill, but still.

3. I don't ""get"" WHEN Thornton falls in love with her. I really couldn't tell that he was interested in her, until suddenly poof, he's smitten. I thought he was being honest when he tells his sister and mom that he's totally indifferent to her. And then he wants to marry her? WHEN did this happen? She didn't lead him on AT ALL. In fact, it makes it seem like she really dislikes him almost until the last scene!!

4. Anachronisms ruin period dramas. What is up with her getting in trouble for being seen at the train with her brother, and then going ahead and kissing - and then returning home with, and unchaperoned at that! - Thornton in the final train scene? Would this really have happened? It seemed highly inconsistent, a scene clearly tailor-made for 21st century viewers to swoon. But all I could think was, ""yeaaaaaah...suuuuuure...""

5. I don't ""get"" the redeeming qualities of the North. The way it is portrayed in the series, it is a damp, gloomy, lonely place. The only friends Margaret has there are either extremely cold, or secret mill worker friends. I actually found it interesting how she grows to like the Thorntons, but the series was way, way, way one-sided in its portrayal of the places. The South was a sunny, green paradise, while the North was all gloom, doom, and poverty. And suddenly at the end, she likes it? Tell me Margaret, WHAT did you like? WHAT are you defending? Because the series didn't leave much to like about the North at all.

6. The series tried to show multiple viewpoints, from mill owner, to pro-union mill workers, and one anti-union mill worker. This was the interesting part of the film. I think I get what they were trying to say: that labor and unions and class divisions are not black and white. But when my husband walked in and asked me, ""So, why are the workers striking?"" and I couldn't answer beyond, ""well, I think they want more money."" - that's when I realized the miniseries left some gaping holes in the plot. WHY did the strike happen? I still can't say for sure. If it's not in the scope of the film to explain WHY, then why include it at all? Anyway, it was a major part of the plot, not just a secondary thing they included!

7. I agree with what another reviewer wrote about the director seeming to want to kill everybody off in one section. I really didn't feel anything when the anti-union mill worker dies, to be honest. And his death was supposed to be a climax??

8. Talk about a deus ex machina ending! By this point in the series, it just made me laugh to find out that [OKAY SERIOUSLY SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!] the only way things were going to end up working out happily ever after was that her dad had a wealthy AND dying best friend. How convenient. And so the moral of the story is: ""If you're rich, you can afford to be happy."" Great moral, not.

9. So many reviewers, and people I've talked to, have said they enjoy it when he professes his love to her in the end because it's so romantic. Well, apparently they were watching a different version than me, because there is no lover's profession! I watched the end again to make sure! ""Proposal Scene""? WHAT proposal? He says, ""You're coming home with me!?"" and that's the entiiiiiire extent of it. Okay, sure, that's romantic, but a proposal? Wow. Maybe you all know something I don't know from the book, but standing alone, the miniseries' ending was a huge let down because nothing really gets explicitly resolved! She holds his hand, okay, but do they get married? Do they live in Milton? Is she happy?

10. This will be an unfair criticism, and I'll get angry comments by die-hard North and South fans, I'm sure. But it was one of the main reasons the film was not as fun for me. One of my favorite things about watching period dramas is enjoying the pretty clothes and hair. There were some pretty clothes, Margaret does have pretty hair, but for me, the costumes did not get even close to the amount of attention that they do in ""Wives and Daughters"" (okay, so maybe that's a bad comparison because I'm sure that at least half of THAT series was about the clothing!). I get that this was not an important aspect to this film's theme. But it was a let down for me nonetheless.

I will say that I found it entertaining, interesting, and fun to watch, and I would recommend period drama lovers see it. But don't have high expectations or you could be disappointed, and watch ""Wives and Daughters"" AFTER.",1299801600,17,5677,4.46480231436837

My previous experience with Elizabeth Gaskell was the BBC version of ""Wives & Daughters,"" which is fabulously done, except I lost respect for Roger when he begins to moon after Cynthia, never mind Osbourne's spending money that is not his in pursuit of ""true love.""

Now, THIS, on the other hand . . . it was not until this point that I realized the ending of P&P was rather wanting. A marriage proposal as they plod along a dirt path behind another couple. . . meh.

In no way did N&S disappoint. I stopped watching Charles Dickens' adaptations because I usually can guess all the mysteries, but with this, the plot unfolded without ever giving me a hint, and the ending - I did not see that coming.

2222674,5,B0007N1BBC,"I enjoyed this BBC movie version much more than the book.  Richard Armitage was stellar as Mr. Thornton.  And, something unusual in a romance, his interactions with supporting characters were as interesting as those with the heroine. Acting, directing, filming all very good. Some striking cinematography of cotton floating through the air in the working mill scenes, the green paradise of Helstone, and the bustling manufacturing town of Milton. This film should have won a cinematography award for use of light and shadow. It was an interesting change for a period piece to show the darker, grittier side of life in that era. As far as romances go, this is one of the best- the kind you revel in rewinding. If there are any flaws, I would say they consist of some overly long strike speeches, and to some extent the heroine herself.  She's a strong-willed character but not always likable, and the voice of the actress was a bit annoying at times.  The ending train scene, in spite of being too far ahead of the time period, was so moving that it now makes the list as one of my favorite screen moments.",1298937600,3,1105,4.680412371134021

Almost four hours later I was still curled up on the sofa and quietly cursing the fact that the series was at an end. I think I thought about replaying it all right then and there! The casting in this movie is beyond superb. Daniela and Sinead shine... the real star though is Richard Armitage. This was the first I had ever seen of the actor and he was perfection personified in this role. I am not easily wowed by actors but Richards incredibly passionate performance in North & South was truly inspired. Beautifully filmed and eerily atmospheric, the mood of the picture is bleak and fitting for a story taking place in a northern, industrial English town. Elizabeth Gaskell doesn't hesitate to make a keen social statement with her story, a commentary that runs seamlessly through the romance. Moreover, the soundtrack sets the tone perfectly.

This is a story set in 19th century England, based on the classic novel by Elizabeth Gaskell. It is a story of a young woman, Miss Margaret Hale (Daniela Denby-Ashe) and her parents who, although not wealthy, come from elegant society south of London. At the beginning of the film they relocate to the northern industrial town of Milton where cotton mills feed the town's population of poor workers and the wealthy and powerful families are those owning the mills. One such mill owner, Mr John Thornton, (Richard Armitage) first meets Miss Hale in a way that puts him in an unfavorable light which only time and Mr Thornton's honorable character can overcome. Miss Hale befriends a working family during this time and is torn between sides when unions clash with mill owners.

2222698,5,B0007N1BBC,"This is an extremely well-produced and well-acted period drama.
I'm sure the plot and characters have been summarised many times already.
In comparison to other works by the same author, I think this a bit more serious and perhaps of interest to a wider audience. (To me it's a drama, with a bit of harsh reality, not just a romance story.)
The mini series is rich and complex enough to merit watching more than once. I liked the way things slowly transition from drab grey to more colourful as the story proceeds.
I particularly enjoyed watching Daniela Denby-Ashe in role of Margaret, in such stark contrast to the snarky trampy teenage Janey Harper she portrays in the sitcom ""My Family"". In fact, the only thing I didn't like was Sinead Cusack, but I never like her in anything.",1289606400,,782,4.673913043478261
2222699,5,B0007N1BBC,"Oh, but it is. A foreign, glorious planet that makes me want to sign up for my corset fitting and venture forth in one of those new-fangled locomotives. Set in the middle years of the Victorian Era, North and South is based on Elizabeth Gaskell's novel of genteel Margaret Hale (Daniela Denby-Ashe) and her hate-respect-admire-love relationship with John Thornton (Richard Armitage, soon to be Thorin Oakenshield in the upcoming big-screen version of The Hobbit), a self-made cotton mill owner from the northern city of Milton, Gaskell's stand-in for Manchester. Repulsed from their very first meeting by Thornton's brutal beating of a mill employee, Margaret refuses to let go of her idealized vision of the people and manners of the South and accept Thornton for the blunt, ambitious, yet also honest and hardworking industrialist he is (Pride? Prejudice? What?) Supporting characters involved in Margaret and Thornton's tumultuous relationship include her well-bred and supportive parents (Tim Pigott-Smith and Lesley Manville), his haughty yet totally devoted mother (Sinead Cusack, brilliant) and an idealistic but grounded union leader (Brendan Coyle), whose daughter (Anna Maxwell Martin) Margaret befriends.

Numerous comparisons have already been made between 1995's BBC/A&E production of Pride and Prejudice and North and South, and while I'll not venture to explore which 19th century hero is more swoon-worthy (Landed country gentlemen? Hardworking industrialist? Oh, decisions!), there is a clear resemblance between the plot of Austen's novel and the plot of Gaskell's. That might be putting it lightly--I think it entirely possible that Ms. Gaskell opened her works of Jane Austen and said, ""Hmm, how can I make this about industrialism?"" They're that similar, right down to the--SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER--failed first marriage proposal. But who cares? It's such an engrossing plot that I daresay no one will mind, and the pacing is different in any case (If Pride and Prejudice is a lovely amble through the countryside, then North and South is a brisk trot through the cobblestoned streets of Milton.) Also, the world of Milton is far starker than anything Austen wrote about--in these cotton mills, you could lose dearer things than your reputation. For all the elegance and lovely period costumes, North and South never lets us forget how the other half lives, and that it was the toil of the ""ordinary"" people that made England prosperous during the golden years of Victoria's reign.

Whatever the outside similarities--or differences--are, if quality of production and overall excellence are your main concerns, then N&S is definitely on par with P&P (this in itself is a recommendation.) The production values are of the highest caliber, and there is not a weak spot in the cast. Sandy Welch (who did 2006's Jane Eyre, also very good) has crafted a breathtaking adaptation that is undeniably Victorian in nature while still being comfortably accessible to modern sensibilities. Oh, and did I mention the cast? Richard Armitage and Daniela Denby-Ashe deserve all the praise they receive here and more. Savor these performances--this is acting to remember. If you are a fan of Austen, Dickens, Victorian literature in general, or Elizabeth Gaskell, get thee to a library/video store/Netflix and immerse yourself in this impeccable production.",1289260800,5,3361,5.4

I have watched this video probably five times since I bought it and still enjoy it just as much as I did the first time I watched it. Though there is much one may contemplate as the viewer is exposed to the differences of life in northern and southern England during the early manufacturing years, there is an element of simple storytelling that makes this movie both delightful and enchanting. The heroine is smart and like-able (unlike so many empty-headed ""beauty queens"" of most movies today)and Richard Armitage has a voice that makes my three daughters swoon (and even me at times!) His character, Mr. Thornton, displays an unbending strength and sense of honor that is admirable (and lacking in most heroes today) yet an underlying vulnerability that makes him irresistable. The filming is poetic at times - especially in regard to the cotton mill as is depicted in my favorite line, ""... I have seen hell, and it is white...""  Other than a few low necklines in the ladies' party dresses, common for the time, a clean and wholesome movie. A must see.",1288656000,2,1197,4.777777777777778

2222704,5,B0007N1BBC,"Is there a period piece that BBC hasn't done well?

I thoroughly enjoyed all the performances, from Tim Pigot-Smith's  Mr. Hale with his gentle but sometimes awkward approach to dealing with his wife, to Sinead Cusack's no-nonsense staunch support of her son.  The show was stolen by Richard Armitage whose performance swung from harsh to stunningly emotional.  His scenes with Daniela Denby-Ashe never left me in doubt of good chemistry between them as they portrayed Margaret Hale and Mr. Thornton.

The production values were excellent, showing the contrast between Margaret's idyllic life in the south to the harsh atmosphere of a northern industrial town. It was highlight by the difference in mannerisms and speech between the characters as well.  It wasn't hard to pick out the class system of the times.  The scenes shot in the cotton mill itself were a good use of how harsh it must have been, relying on the almost automatonical movements of the machines and the contrast of the white of the cotton and the black of their attire.

The screenplay was a good adaptation of Gaskell's story, and the use of windows and the train platform at the end was a very good example of how the characters belong in separate worlds until, finally, Margaret and Thornton meet, exiting trains to speak on a middle ground that they had strove to find, but previously failed at.",1284854400,,1369,4.870689655172414

2222706,5,B0007N1BBC,"Bliss. This is the feeling I was left with after watching North & South. It's a long, hard journey to that complete satisfaction, but it is one that is both necessary and wondrous.

From the very beginning, the music of this movie swept me away. It is grand and hauntingly beautiful, and it seems to echo long after the movie is over. The sounds truly capture the emotional depth of the various scenes. They emphasize the authenticity of the feelings and make them that much more moving and real.

But it wasn't just the music that stood out to me. It was a combination of a great many things, especially the acting and the cinematography. I was both drawn into the story and drawn close to the characters. The pain that they felt, the struggles they faced, and the hope that somehow endured . . . all of it was inspiring.

I simply loved how this movie portrayed real life--including the raw anger, the aching need to survive, the longing for justice, and the blossoming of passion. I was reminded of so much that I'm sure no matter how many times I watch it I still won't completely grasp all that I can learn from the movie. I was shown, not simply told, the importance of not judging others, of having compassion and being willing to seek understanding. Through the contrasts between the North and the South, I saw how people have different perspectives based on where they come from. Through the growth of John Thornton and Margaret Hale, as well as some of the workers, I saw how people could learn to respect each other and truly show love. And I loved every minute of it.

This is a movie that will stay with you and leave you with an ending and overall impression so beautiful, you will be in a state of bliss.",1284768000,8,1719,4.447619047619048

2222709,5,B0007N1BBC,"I had rather low expectations of this miniseries, and was only going to watch the first few minutes to see if I liked it enough to watch the rest.  Hours later, at one in the morning, I had somehow managed to watch the entire series!
This is the best miniseries I have seen on the small screen.  The production values are top notch and feels close to the quality of a feature film.  The cinematography is beautiful at times (e.g., the iconic scene where John Thornton is walking swiftly thru his mill with bits of cotton in the air resembling snow) the sets are wonderful, and the score is haunting.  It's too bad the BBC isn't selling it.
The pacing of the plot leaves no areas where you're confused about the direction or point of certain scenes.  The acting is wonderful and really tugs at you heart strings.  Cusak's proud mother role steals any scene she is in, and Richard Armitage gives a performance that will be remembered along side Colin Firth's Darcy.

""I wish I could tell you how lonely I am. How cold and harsh it is here. Everywhere there is conflict and unkindness. I think God has forsaken this place. I believe I have seen hell and it's white, it's snow-white.""

It was an absolutely wonderful series.  Richard Armitage was broodingly dreamy! Daniela Denby-Ash was a perfect fit for Margaret.  The pair made a great iron-upon-iron relationship, that finally melted together in perfect harmony.  The heartache of the poor, the mixture of class, the struggles of life in a time we often wish we could be part of, was done very well.

Needless to say, I loved the series.  The ending was heartwarming, and the final relenting kiss of Margaret's lips upon the hand of the man she loved was priceless indeed.

I highly recommend this series.  The book is just as good too!",1282953600,3,1057,4.790055248618785

This was so much richer than the book.  It filled in the story line so very much, and I think it is better than the book by far.  The great choices of Mr. Thorton and Miss Hale were inspired.  The cinematograpy was excellent as was everything about this film.  Many scenes were so memorable they are forever etched in my mind.  One closeup of Mr. Thorton with  his failed mill in the background was spectacular as was the one when Miss Hale opens the factory door for the first time, and there were many many more.  The music was haunting and beautiful and forewarned you of what was to come.

If anyone is thinking of doing another remake of JANE EYRE, I suggest Richard Armitage for the part of Mr. Rochester--no one can brood like he can.  Buy this DVD you won't regret it.",1282348800,,1054,4.21
2222712,5,B0007N1BBC,"This BBC costume drama is like ""Pride and Prejudice"" with guts and muscle. It tells the story of Margaret Hale, strong-minded daughter of a village vicar and John Thornton, tough northern mill owner. Hale's father refuses to sign a pledge of Church loyalty and is forced to leave his post. His family is uprooted from the beautiful countryside of the south of England, where life meanders on as it always has, to the tough, grimy, polluted northern mill town of Milton where Mr. Thornton and other masters are busy running the engine of the Industrial Revolution.

The author, Mrs Gaskell, who herself lived in both North and South, is unblinking in chronicling the hardship and cruelty of the ""dark Satanic mills"" including the degradations of child labor, dangerous machines, excessive hours, low wages and air polluted with cotton that coats the workers' lungs and sends them to early graves. She is remarkably fair mediating between workers trying to form a union that will protect some of their rights and ensure a fair wage and the owners engaged in cut-throat competition.

The acting is wonderful, especially by the two principals who have real chemistry. There is a kind of Pride and Prejudice about their affair, which begins as in Austen with a botched proposal and proceeds through a process in which they learn to respect and then to love one another. The secondary roles are also great, especially the redoubtable Sinead Cusack as Thornton's no-nonsense mother.

The first two movies I thought were very good, but North and South is one of the best (if not the best) movies I have ever seen.  I couldn't help when watching it (and my daughter thought so too) of the comparison between 1995 Pride and Prejudice.  I noticed the comparison especially in the proposal scene.  Let me tell you I was mesmorized by this movie from beginning to end.  I loved all of the characters, especially the relationship between Margaret and Thornton, Thornton and his mother, and Thornton and Higgins.  I think that I have watched it in the short time I have owned it about 5 times straight through.  The train scene is breath taking.  How Thornton's whole demeanor changes when he sees Margaret in the train station and how he looks at her with such love in his eyes.  I have watched that scene about a couple of dozen times so far and it has now become the favorite ending of any movie I have ever seen.

2222724,5,B0007N1BBC,"This is a top notch adaptation of an often overlooked British author that had wonderful social commentary about the time of the industrial revolution in Northern England set amidst a Victorian style drama with romantic inclinations.  The actors are very good. The cinematography is stellar. Richard Armitage's portrayal of John's restrained passionate nature is stirring.  I was fascinated every minute he was on screen.  Brendan Coyle as wonderfully intuitive (when it comes to Margaret) Higgins was a joy;  I loved that the blue collar wrker union guy single father with grown children from the wrong side of the tracks that understood the privileged young girl (Margaret) better than any other character.  Sinead Cusack as Mrs. Thornton is a scene stealer. Daniela Denby-Ashe does a good job portraying Margaret's conflict as a somewhat privileged girl that tries to be a lady and fit societal expectations at the same time has steel in her spine, decided opinions, and a sense of social justice. Mrs. Thornton and Margaret are both made of the same stuff.  The series script deviates from the book by Elizabeth Glaskell, but stays true to the basic story and feel, and in my mind improves on the book in condensing so much of the trivial meanderings in the book.  One of the things I find most glorious that it never takes sides in the labor disputes, it shows both sides, two groups, dependent on each other for survival. This female author while employing the strong taciturn type male lead, is incredibly kind to men in a repressive age, creates admirable male characters.  They are loyal, and loving, and strong, and have ethics, and they do what they do for their families, and for what they believe is right.  And when they are wrong, they say they are wrong.

They shortened the early events of the book, and slightly altered the ending sequence of events, but I do not believe anything was lost.  By shortening the beginning, the movie glosses over her deep attachment to her home.  It also cuts out the explanation of Margaret's relationship to her parents and Mr.&Mrs. Hale's relationship with each other.  (Most of the explanation is from thoughts in Margaret's head, so I'm not sure how the writers could portray it.)  The actors do a good job of acting out these relationships later in the movie, so again I don't believe anything was lost.  The middle of the book and movie are very similar.  The movie ends the same as the book, with a different location for the scenes.  I actually preferred the scene location for the movie over the book.

2222727,5,B0007N1BBC,"The words of the title for my review are uttered by Margaret Hale, the heroine of the lush BBC miniseries, North and South, when she described the cotton factories in the fictional town of Milton, in the industrial north of England. The South in the title refers to the prosperous and more 'refined' south of England, including London.

There are 454 reviews of this wonderful miniseries as I write this.  I'm sure somewhere in those 454 reviews, there is at least one or two synopses of the plot.  So I won't go over well-trod soil.  But I will comment on the acting, the cinematography, and the art direction.

The acting is superb.  Richard Armitage plays John Thornton, the owner of one of the vast, busy, and almost inhumane cotton mills in Milton.  Armitage has a extensive background as an actor, primarily in British television, most notably 'MI-5'.  Daniela Denby-Ashe plays the aforementioned Ms. Hale.  She's a capable actress, and lends a solid presence to the role.  Also notable is Hale's father, the disillusioned preacher who leaves the Church of England on a matter of conscience, played by veteran actor Tim Pigott-Smith (Robert Merrick in the excellent 'The Jewel in the Crown).

The cinematography is second-to-none.  It captures the grime of the city, the bleak working and living places of the masses (and that is an apt word to describe how those unfortunate souls are treated), and the fine clumps of cotton that float ever-present through the factories.  (The 'snow white of hell' that Hale describes at the end of the first episode.)  The art direction is also excellent.  It's just as you'd imagine a Dickens city to be.

This is a superior effort, with lots of money to back it up.  Milton does look like an Earthly version of Hades, with the exploitation of workers, extreme poverty and widespread child labor.  It's also a very interesting look at English history, lightly covered in other films, regarding the fantastic changes in the lives of the English as the industrial revolution took full hold. These are issues that Charles Dickens would tackle in many of his own works around the same time as the novel by Elizabeth Gaskell, upon whose novel this miniseries is based.

It's hard to believe that the life portrayed in Austen's novels is only a couple of decades prior to this gritty work.

Very Highly recommended.  This is the type of work you look forward to watching, and sad when it ends.  It's a winning effort, and I give it a full five stars.  I look forward to watching it again.  Bravo!",1275523200,2,2533,4.783410138248848
2222728,5,B0007N1BBC,"This is a beautifully rendered adaptation of the novel, ""North and South"" by Elizabeth Gaskell.  I had read the book first and had no idea it had been made into a BBC miniseries.  While looking for other books by Elizabeth Gaskell I stumbled across the DVD - I had to have it - now!

The DVD arrived in a couple of days and I watched it immediately.  I have since watched it several times and have become more and more enchanted with the story, the actors, etc.  The miniseries ends differently than the book, but I must say, the new ending enhances the story and is perhaps one of the most romantic moments on film.

2222730,5,B0007N1BBC,I think this time in british history is not well known and this story brings to light a different side of british history. We know all about the monarchs but what about the working class outiside of London and Jane Austin. This story reminds me alot of pride and prejudice but still is unique. I recommend reading the book as well. This dvd is a must have for anyone that is a fan of british romance similiar to jane austin,1274054400,2,423,4.3
2222731,5,B0007N1BBC,"This bbc production of ""North and South"" is wonderful.  I feel that I am taken to another time and place.  It is romantic, yet it is not a light fluffy romance.  This mini series shows the family relationship of two vastly different families, their struggles and their love for each other.  Richard Armitage is ""darkly handsome and sexy"".  I can't wait to finish it tonight.

I would not have purchased this dvd had I not read the reviews first on the amazon discussion boards.  Thanks amazon!",1273968000,2,493,4.662790697674419
2222732,5,B0007N1BBC,"OK I'll admit I didn't read the book so I cannot complain that it does not closely follow the book.  However, I have read many books made into movies and have yet to find a movie that can do the book justice.  I read someone complain about the kissing at the end.  It is a nearly closed mouth, not-in-any-way disgusting kissing scene.  Puh-lease people love this movie for what it is.  I watched it in full the first time, then I started only watching the parts with Margaret and John.  Now, I'm watching parts of John without Margaret.  Richard Armitage makes this movie what it is!  And his mom, and Nicholas Higgins (Brenden Coyle).  The little things Richard does just add so much -- his eyes the way they cut to the side when Mr. Bell has called for Margaret from across the street, the crinkle in his forhead when Mr. Slickson calls him away from Margret at the dinner party, the smile after his mother tells him Miss Hale will never have him and he admits she is right and, oh my goodness, even when he yells ""Never"" to the striker who asks about sending the Irish home.  The first time I watched it, I didn't catch all of the little things that John had done to help his workers.  But if you pay attention, he is quite a forward thinking, honest master.
  When I first read of someone comparing this to Pride and Prejudice, I was in full agreement.  I'd consider myself an expert on that movie (the 2005 Keira Knightly one).  But once you think about it, the only similarity is that the women are strong.  We never dove into Mr. Darcy's business affairs and he didn't have an overprotective mother.  I would continue to compare, but I don't want to spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it.  I think I'm drawn to these movies because I am a strong woman and I wonder how I might have lived back in those days.
  If you are considering buying the 3-series set, please rent or borrow first.  Cranford is too slow for my tastes and Return isn't much better.  Poor Miss Matty just has no luck.  I've started watching Wives and Daughters but quite honestly it hasn't captured my attention and I seriously am watching North and South daily right now.",1273622400,,2157,4.405063291139241
2222733,5,B0007N1BBC,"This is an excellent film adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's masterpiece North & South, the story of a woman who moves from a lovely, countryside existence to a English textile mill town due to her mother's health concerns.  The film is not the typical English garden, cottages, everything is lovely atmosphere but instead reflects the overall atmosphere of a mill town:  many dark, rainy days, little grass, views of factory areas, dark colors for costumes, and very impoverished characters.  Even the leads are not ""hollywood handsome"" in the typical sense....yet this is the beauty of the film in that the setting is realistically reflective of a mill town, prior to unionized labor, when mill workers were not protected by health laws, or child labor laws, and where illness and want were a matter of course.

This is not a happy, wappy, let's go to the ball sort of movie...but one that deals with the serious socioeconomic issues of life in such a town between the mill owner and his desire to keep the people employed and his mill working, the workers who are underpaid and undernourished and want the mill owner to pay more, and the main character who wants things to improve for both sides.  There is a slight romance, characters in general are low key, and the focus is on relationships as well as the economic realities that affect those relationships.  Overall it is not a cheery film but a poignant,worthwhile, entrancing one, with a feel good ending.  An excellent, serious film, as you can see from all the other reviews. (G-rated).

If you are looking for a film of similar superlative quality with a less serious, somber slant,  the same author wrote ""Wives & Daughters"" which is more Jane Austen like, in that the emphasis is on social interactions in a small English village, beautiful costuming, a romance as well as an intriguing plot and many wonderful characters.  You can purchase it or borrow from a library, but it is superb. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GIXLUC/ref=cm_cr_mts_prod_img",1273449600,,2017,5.0119760479041915
2222734,5,B0007N1BBC,"I must admit that I kept ignoring this film,even though Netflix insisted I would enjoy it. Finally, on a rainy Sunday night I caved in and watched it. Boy, was I happy I did.

This production is right up there with the best of BBC's mini-series, including, as many have already mentioned, Pride & Prejudice (1995). I loved it so much I went out and bought it the next day.

Mr. Thornton, played by the BEAUTIFUL and DELICIOUS Richard Armitage is to die for.
The ""Look back. Look back at me"" alone was swoon worthy.
Armitage/Thornton is the epitome of a broody, romantic GOD! Unlike Darcy, Thornton has a back story. And the viewer learns the reasons behind his being so serious and stern.

The series is beautifully shot.
The story tugs at the heart strings.
The sound track is amazing!
And there is not one moment where the viewer becomes bored or wishes to fast forward.
The entire supporting cast-- especially Brendan Coyle who play Nicholas Higgins and Sinead Cusack who plays Hannah Thornton-- is absolutely outstanding.

The great thing about the DVD is includes subtitles (even the special features), which I have to admit, I needed, especially with all the different dialects!

The only thing that bothered me was that it ended. Four hours was not long enough! I didn't want it to end. But alas, it had to. I'm just so happy I have it on DVD so I can watch it over and over again!",1273017600,3,1388,4.5582329317269075
2222735,5,B0007N1BBC,"One of the best BBC productions I have ever watched. Normally in a mini-series I become bored, confused, bored, annoyed, bored, and embarrassed. The costumes are always ridiculous (not BBC just in general) and the hallmark card section has better scripts. This movie/mini-series breaks the mold in all areas. First off they hate each other (Pride and Prejudice) but unlike P and P Ms. Hale witnesses Mr. Thornton acting cruel to one of his worker and ultimately judges him based on this. Not yet understanding that Northern England and Southern England have different values. Needless to say this movie is full or heartbreak, learning, love, and ultimately friendship. Both of these two strong characters (and unlike P and P there are no cheesy moments I promise) go through a wonderful journey and end up discovering how much they actually have in common. If that didn't persuade you, the music will! Best soundtrack ever!

Watch the damn movie! Thank you that is all. : )",1272499200,4,973,4.932926829268292
2222736,5,B0007N1BBC,"If you like period dramas, this miniseries is a MUST HAVE.  Fantastic characters who are portrayed by top-notch actors.  With Richard Armitage as John Thornton and Daniela Denby-Ashe as Margaret Hale, you have wonderful chemistry and a very believable love story.  The setting is 1850's, northern England cotton manufacturing with all the hardship and strife of that period (think Charles Dickens).  The supporting characters/players are equally superb.  Sinead Cusack as Hannah Thornton (John's mother), Jo Joyner as Fanny Thornton (John's sister), and Brendan Coyle as Nicholas Higgins (union leader), to name a few.  I thoroughly enjoyed the character of Fanny who adds great humor to a somewhat dark story.

Equally magnificent is the score by composer Martin Phipps, who also wrote the score for the 2008 version of Sense and Sensibility.  The music is both beautiful and haunting with its cello, violin, bass and piano usage.  The score at the end of the film in the train station is the loveliest piece I've ever heard (and that's saying a lot for I adored his work in S&S 2008!).  Sadly, neither film's score has been released by the composer.

2222737,2,B0007N1BBC,"I must be the dissenting voice here. I love a good British drama, but was disappointed here. I found it melodramatic and terribly predictable, a wanna be Pride and Prejudice with a dollop of Heathcliff thrown in. And it felt far too modern in some specific scenes- does the book have it's protagonists passionately kissing in the train station at it's conclusion? I wonder. Maybe it's a generational thing, but give me the old Masterpiece Theater productions, which to me feel much truer to the time.",1271980800,7,500,4.825581395348837

I admit I'm disappointed I didn't give this a chance sooner because it's so wonderful I could have watched it five times by now. Like the other reviewers as I said I passed it by and like those reviewers I'm glad I finally gave it a chance. I had been so disappointed with other period pieces lately that I didn't want to be so again. I was very much the opposite. Mr. Thornton rivals Mr. Darcy from Pride & Prejudice for my affections. The character was so scary at first but as you get to know him from a new point of view you respect and admire him for his determination and honesty. His faults only serve to make him human which makes him all the more wonderful. The chemistry with Margaret was undeniable. Every meeting was charged with an electricity I'd not seen in some time. You can't help but love them both and their follies. As other's have said, if you loved Pride & Prejudice (preferably with Colin Firth) then you will love North & South (2004).

Some comments have been made at Daniela (Margaret) being dry or not showing emotion BUT that is how she is in the book!

Richard Armitage who plays the leading man does a beautiful job and playing the responsible and brooding John Thornton. (I like him better than Colin Firth's, Mr. Darcy!!)

This movie is a moving love story which also interweaves the industrial revolution in Northern England during the 1800's. I could watch the very end of the movie again and again! Great ending!

My mother & sister did not like it. They said it was too ""dark"".

Was it perfect?  Was all the acting dead on?  No, but I don't expect that out of any movie.  This movie holds so much more to it then just the normal period pieces where the girls sit around stitching all day and the guys have nothing better to do than go visiting and quail hunting.  This movie touches on poverty, the industrial revolution, class struggle, unions, working conditions, suicide, politics, religion, and it has a killer love story to boot!

John Thornton is a character worth admiring.  I wish I had read the book North and South so much earlier in life because then I wouldn't have wasted so many years holding a literary crush on Darcy when there was a man like Thornton waiting in literature.  Thornton has all the same character as Darcy, but Thornton has the added layer of a hard life that adds to him that silver-spoon-in-the-mouth Darcy could never have.  Richard Armitage did an excellent job with the role.  Many of the other actors did an excellent job with their roles as well.

The movie is beautifully shot, even if the subject mater isn't always beautiful.  I could listen to the musical score all day and the costums are believable.

But where Mr. Darcy was secretive, Mr. Thornton makes no attempt to hide why he acts the way he does and is even very patient in correcting Margaret's assumptions about the Northern industrial towns.

Much of the charm of the movie comes from the two leads: Daniela Ashby and Richard Armitage.  You're outraged at the treatment Mr. Thornton deals his worker right along with Margaret, but soften just as she does when he explains.

Richard Armitage and Daniela Denby-Ashe have FANTASTIC chemistry and the story is not only beautiful itself (based on the novel by Elizabeth Gaskell) but it is acted and produced perfectly. This is a million times more amazing than any movie/BBC production I've ever seen (INCLUDING Pride & Prejudice- both the Firth and McFadyen versions.) The scenery is believable and brilliantly incorporated and the music also adds to the enchanting effect of this movie. Armitage certainly comes off as a callous and sometimes unfortunate looking man in the beginning, but by the end of this movie I would have just as easily married him. After seeing his softer side, I realized he is GORGEOUS! Funny how that happens, huh? ;D

All in all this review is short and sweet because my opinion is short and sweet. I bought this movie one week ago and have since watched it three times (Despite it being 4 hours long.) I also showed it to several relatives and friends who said it was one of the best movies they'd ever seen.

2222767,5,B0007N1BBC,"Plot Details: This opinion reveals minor details about the movie''s plot.
If you're a fan of Pride and Prejudice, I highly recommend you check out North & South!!! Netflix kept recommending it to me because of my tendencies towards BBC romances. I've always been a die hard Jane Austen fan.

Originally I was a bit confused, because I'm familiar with North and South, the American Civil War miniseries. I couldn't figure out why Netflix kept saying I should try North & South because of my previous interest in movies like Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice. I never read the synopsis for movies, because I hate ruining the plot. I added it to my watch instantly queue and gave it a go.

Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised! North & South consists of 4 ""episodes"" which tell the tale of Margaret Hale (played by Daniela Denby-Ashe) and John Thornton (played by the spectacular and oh-so-gorgeous Richard Armitage). After being uprooted from her home, Margaret and her family settle down up north in Milton, an industrial city known for its production of cotton. Margaret meets Mr. Thornton, a tough cotton mill owner, under less that desirable circumstances and takes an immediate dislike to the man.

The story from there follows Margaret's efforts to feel at home in a foreign and unhappy place. She misses her life in the south, her home which she often called 'paradise' and London, where she spent so much time with her beloved cousin and friends. You watch as she gains new friends, learns about herself and the realities of life, and undergoes great joys and tragedies.

If you love romantic movies and BBC, you have to check out North & South! Not to sound obsessive, but I bought the movie the same day I saw it on Netflix watch instantly, and have watched it at least a hundred times since! I know the movie by heart, and even made an epic search of tracking down the soundtrack (which was never released). I can watch it again and again!

I'm not sure why, but they felt the need to take away a lot of the strength of the main character, who in the book is managing so much and all without anyone knowing how much she bears.  I suppose that's hard to show in film?  At any rate, read the book, then watch the movie - it throws a very nice little addition on at the end that promises to please.",1253750400,2,526,4.178217821782178

I especially like the special feature showing the tour of Mrs. Gaskell's home and travels.  This is not ""Pride and Prejudice,"" but I know I will re-watch the video numerous times.

2222776,5,B0007N1BBC,"I have to say that this BBC series left me with tears streaming from my eyes. Partially because my eyes were thoroughly irritated but also because this was such a well told story which came out splendidly on screen. Many of the characters left a bold impression upon me from Dixon the servant to Lennox Margaret's forlorn suitor. The cinematography was excellent and the detail was exquisite.
I'm really surprised how much ground the story covered from a historical perspective. I'm not a history buff so I don't know much about it other than the basics but they hit issues with the union, speculation, exhibitions... It was quite educational so I don't feel so bad about enjoying the romance. ^_^",1250035200,2,697,4.816666666666666
2222777,5,B0007N1BBC,"I actually know someone who has read all of Elizabeth Gaskell's novels.  Apparently Gaskell was a 19th century social reformer who saw her work more as advancing the causes of the poor working man and the formation of unions for same.  So she may well be turning in her grave if she were to discover the legions of females panting over Richard Armitage, who plays the male lead character, cotton weaving mill factory owner Thornton.  However, Armitage has not provoked this reaction in me with his star turns in VICAR OF DIBLEY or SPOOKS (called MI-5 in the USA).  So Gaskell must have put a very solid love story to sell what otherwise would have been a very hard to sell novel.  To further demonstrate exactly how good this was, I was flat on my back in the hospital recovering from surgery when I watched this on a dvd player.  I loved it despite all the other hospital activity going on around me, including being poked and prodded.

As I've previously stated, I don't think the make or break factors in romance works are the heroines.  I think it is the hero. Thus, Armitage's brooding, smoldering performance as Thornton I think will rank with Colin Firth's playing Darcy in ""Pride & Prejudice"".

The reason for the title is that the heroine moves from the south of England, which was still quite bucolic, to the much harsher north.  The north is newly industrialized and all the focus is on profits to be made in factories with little thought towards the welfare of the working man.  The heroine is a preacher's daughter and finds most of this treatment inhumane.  She is rather newly poor herself as her father had a falling out over church dogma so has foisted this move upon them.  However, she has a very rich godfather who looks after her and is estate planning with her in mind.  This will lead to some very surprising twists in the tale.

The director incorporates many artistic flourishes throughout in the filming.  There is one beautiful scene where the cotton in the mill is floating through the air as if it were snow and for a moment you think it is winter but it is not.  The ending is filmed in summertime at a railroad station where the two leads are on trains going in opposite directions, one north and one south.  They both briefly get off the train and run into one another.  The filming of this sequence is absolutely lovely.  (The reader of the Gaskell novels told me this scene does not exist in the novel.)

The key roles, all beautifully acted, are the male and female leads, the mother of the male lead, the father of the female lead and the union organizer who deals with both of the leads.

2222778,5,B0007N1BBC,I am freaking out because this is so good.  I love BBC's period dramas.  This is by far the best I have seen in a long time.  Richard Armitage takes a great turn from a villian in BBC's Robin Hood to the sexy Mr. Thornton.  This is a must watch.,1249171200,3,245,3.84
2222779,5,B0007N1BBC,"There could be no better imaginable adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's novel than this 2004 mini-series. Sandy Welch, who is the best of all BBC adaptors of great Victorian novels (despite the claims made for Andrew Davies), kept exactly to the spirit of Gaskell's great love story that explored the rise of the Northern manufacturing centers in the North of England and the shift of might in the country from the milder agrarian South. Intriguingly, Welch actually cut quite a bit from the novel's early chapters that explain in greater depth how Margaret Hale (Daniela Denby-Ashe) was transplanted with her family to the Northern city of Milton (meant to be a stand-in for Manchester) when her father (Tim Piggot-Smith), a mild-mannered reverend in the Southern counties, has a crisis of conscience and leaves his congregation. In Milton the Rev. Hale becomes the tutor to a wealthy self-made mill owner, the Byronic John Thornton (Richard Armitage), who falls for Margaret despite the disapproval of his steely mother (Sinead Cusack). But Margaret fears Thornton despises her for her family's loss of fortune, and Thornton worries that Margaret holds his trade in contempt...

Really, Gaskell's story has much in common with PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, although it has none of the humor but much more of a richer sociohistorical texture to it. Very wisely Welch emphasized the Austenian aspect of the love story while also adding some wonderful scenes of the inside of the Thornton factory, Marlborough Mills, which are presented stunningly (in an actual old textile mill with the original machines) as saturated with the choking fluff of cotton in the air. The cast is terrific, with Denby-Ashe, Piggott-Smith, and the finely nuanced Lesley Mandeville as the Hale family, although the greatest standouts are Cusack as the flinty Mrs. Thornton and the dashing Armitage as her proud son. (The popularity of this miniseries, which caught BBC executives by surprise, was attributed to Armitage making the same sort of splash in his role that Colin Firth did a decade earlier as Mr. Darcy; in a winning interview extra of the DVD set Richard Armitage notes that the comparison has been made and is charmingly humbled by it, and by the greatness of his role.) It's hard to imagine an even better Gaskell adaptation than Andrew Davies's WIVES AND DAUGHTERS a few years earlier, but this superb DVD miniseries accomplished exactly that.",1249084800,5,2424,5.121212121212121
2222780,5,B0007N1BBC,"If you like Pride and Prejudice, then you will enjoy this film. It's one of the best BBC novel adaptations out there!!!",1247875200,,119,4.454545454545454
2222781,5,B0007N1BBC,"This movie rocked my world!!! So much so that giving it five stars simply does not do it justice.

I stumbled on to the ""Instant Play"" version of North and South on NetFlix a few weeks ago.  Within a week, I'd seen it at least 5 times--all four episodes, start to finish, on my computer screen.  This doesn't include the countless times I've watched the final train station scene.  I finally had to get the DVD, which I soon discovered contains many additional scenes that the NetFlix Instant Play version edited out (I think to fit within TV time slots).

I, too, first confused this movie with the John Jakes Civil War saga and avoided watching it for several weeks.  In fact, when I first started the movie (knowing absolutely nothing about it but expecting it to be about the Civil War), I was perplexed that the actors were speaking with British accents. :)

This movie is just superb.  While all of the lead and supporting roles are very well acted, Richard Armitage (John Thornton) and Sinead Cusack (Hannah Thornton) are stand outs.  As many times as I've viewed this movie, I never tire of their performances--and the scenes between mother and son are as memorable as those between John and Margaret.

I admit that I am a huge fan of Pride and Prejudice and all things Austen.  While I love Colin Firth's performance as Darcy, what I feel for Richard Armitage's John Thornton can only be described as an utterly stupid, infatuated lovesickness the likes of which I haven't experienced since my adolescence (I'm forty-something now, in case you're wondering).  It takes a special man indeed to make an otherwise jaded, old broad feel like she's sixteen again.  And I am not alone I've discovered--Armitage appears to have had a similar effect on women of all ages around world with this performance.  Aside from being tall, dark, blue-eyed, husky-voiced, and broodingly handsome, the man can act like no one's business. He perfectly embodies the complexity of John Thornton and does a superb job of revealing the many layers of his character--one moment seemingly cruel and unyielding, the next astonishingly vulnerable and tender, but always with a core of decency and integrity that never wavers. This is HIS movie.  What an amazing performance!

As someone else described, this movie feels like a cross between Austen (romance) and Dickens (social commentary).  I have not read Gaskell's novel yet but will certainly do so now.

It's always a pleasure to watch a romance between equals--two strong characters as passionate and principled as any you'll find on screen.  To watch them slowly come to understand and respect each other is pure delight, and to have it all conclude in what has to be the most romantic and emotionally satisfying (if anachronistic--but who really gives a darn anyway after that final kiss?) ending is...well, I haven't enough words or enough stars to describe it...",1247616000,15,2903,4.887755102040816

Margaret Hale (Daniela Denby-Ashe) is uprooted from her beloved home in the south of England by her idealistic clergy father to the industrial town of Milton in the north. There she meets John Thornton (Richard Armitage) the owner of a cotton mill struggling with labor problems. When Margaret meets John she immediately takes a dislike to him because he is in the process of brutally dismissing a worker who is smoking in his factory. Unaware of his motives-he's concerned about the factory burning and killing his employees-she marks him as dark and brutish. John begins taking lessons from Margaret's father and slowly develops a crush on her. He proposes marriage, she refuses. She overcomes her prejudices against John after learning more about him, but he succumbs to gossip about her and convinces himself he no longer loves her. And so the back and forth of missed connections continues through five titillating episodes of will they or won't they. Will they overcome their pride and confess their affection? Will they listen to gossip or follow their heart? Will Margaret learn to love Milton and come to understand John's values? The romantic push and pull is played out most interestingly against the backdrop of turn of the century labor struggles in England.

2222796,5,B0007N1BBC,"I truly love North and South.  This film has replaced Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility as my favorite.

I have always loved Jane Austen, and had read Gaskell's North and South some years ago and loved it as well.  I somehow missed the DVD when it first came out, and only saw it by chance on netflicks.  It was wonderful, so I immediately ordered this DVD.  I am so glad I did.

First of all, it is beautifully filmed.  Secondly, the DVD has much more of the story (cut from the netflix version).  I was also very happy to find the commentaries on the first and last hour.  I would have preferred commentaries focused less on architecture and technical details and more on the acting, but I am glad that they existed.

The DVD has first and last scenes with Margaret and Thornton that are quite different from the novel.  I thought the fight scene that introduces Thornton was well done, and did - for a modern audience - better explain Margaret's initial dislike.  The last scene of the two of them at the railroad station is quite good. I see the anacronism and am willing to suspend disbelief in the cause of a good romantic ending.  As with the book, I wanted more.  I wanted to know what happened after the ending - but that is the sign of an excellent drama.

The acting was wonderful, particularly the excellent Richard Armitage as Thornton.  He is an actor I have not seen before, but one I hope to see again.  Daniela Denby-Ashe was a lovely Margaret, while not as expert an actor.  Sinead Cusack, Brendan Coyle and the actress who played Bessie Higgins were all outstanding.",1240617600,5,1597,4.486111111111111
2222797,5,B0007N1BBC,"Excellent - right up there with Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle in Pride & Prejudice in acting, directing, scene location, costumes and story line with the book.",1239753600,2,155,5.24
2222798,3,B0007N1BBC,"I haven't read Mrs. Gaskell's book, so I was able to watch this DVD with no reader's pre-conception about how the story was adapted and/or the changes to its plot.  I was willing to enjoy what I hoped, from everything I'd heard and read about it, was a typical high-quality British TV production.

And there are qualities about this production that I did enjoy, very much.  Tim Piggott-Smith's performance as Rev. Hale; Sinead Cusack's performance as Hannah Thornton (where has this actress been? one never sees her enough and she's so good), and Richard Armitage as John Thornton, are excellent.  The attention paid to the Victorian-era details - the costumes; the household furnishings; the contrast between the damp and gloomy northern mill town as opposed to the flowering southern vicarage where the Hales come from.  And I loved the soundtrack - what perfectly suited-to-this-story music.

But, I had some problems with casting choices, the first one (relatively minor) being the actor who played Paul Hale.  With his shaggy hair falling into his eyes and certain mannerisms, this actor struck me as a bit too 21st century to be playing a young man of the 19th century.  More seriously the biggest problem I had was the performance of Daniela Denby-Ashe as Margaret.  I still don't quite know if it was the actress playing her, or the character of Margaret as written, or a combination of both factors, but by the second episode and as the story continued, I was experiencing an increasingly negative feeling toward her.  Certainly the actress's nearly-chipmunk cheeked, pudding face with its pink-lidded eyes and usually vacant expression and blank stares (only ever fully awake during exchanges or arguments with Thornton), gradually began annoying the heck out of me.  I admit that by the last episode, I would have hoped Margaret and John didn't reconcile, if only one couldn't see it coming a mile away... All my sympathies at that point were with Mrs. Thornton, especially when she criticized Margaret to John Thornton.  I felt exactly the same way.

Thus, unfortunately, the very romantic ending to the series, at the train station, didn't find favor with me, the way it seems to have affected so many other female viewers.  That last glimpse of Margaret's face, turned away from John to look out the train window, was the last straw.  Turned away to look out the window, from the man who's just pledged his undying love for her!  Why would a director choose this ending?  The only thing that saved that scene, for me, was the music welling up in the background.

If I were to purchase anything regarding this production (the DVD was a library loan) it will be the soundtrack, if it's available.  I did enjoy the production for the majority of the performances and for its attention to detail, but because I just didn't have the overwhelmingly positive reaction that most viewers seem to have had for Richard Armitage/Daniela Denby-Ashe's so-called chemistry, I personally can't speak to fully enjoying this adaptation.  Obviously many viewers felt much differently!

****
This is my third, and last, attempt to leave a review of this particular television mini-series.  I would appreciate if certain of the 370+ positive reviewers of this DVD, some of whom left borderline hostile/rude comments which unfortunately got deleted (and no, this was not my intention), and who thought this series was a five-star-or-even-more, utterly wonderful and fantastic viewing experience, would take into account that my review actually was not written to thoughtlessly ""bash"" this TV miniseries.  I've stated one major problem I had with it which affected MY total enjoyment of the production.  I agree 100% that any other viewer of ""North and South"" might think Daniela Denby-Ashe is fabulous as Margaret, but I, personally, didn't find her performance that great.  There are a few reviews on Amazon.co.uk that concur with my opinion about her performance.

Let me just say that being a movie buff, I am yet to see this kind of sensuality and romance between two protagonists with just expression and eyes! I am left speechless!
For those of you who have not seen this you don't know what you are missing!!
Every cast is optimum. I cannot say that anyone gave less than 100%
""Bot"" :) this film belongs to Richard Armitage (I am again joining in the chorus here). I am a big Colin Firth fan, Darcy or no Darcy, but RA is indescribable. He oozes sex appeal with that voice and that smile and oh those eyes!!
Five stars! can I give a thousand more? Oh by the way the other technicalities (you know- cinematography, background score, aesthetic value etc.) are excellent too, but it is Richard Armitage...here I go again :)

As someone who read the book first, I have to say that they both have their strong merits. The book is rich in detail, and the writing itself is outstanding, and worth reading out of context just for its style. However, I must say that the music and visuals of the BBC film bump it past the book on my list. This is easily one of the best films I have ever seen. I would recommend reading the book first, just so you have an idea where some things come from (ie the sudden move to Milton, which isn't immediately clear in the film), but the film is definitely worth seeing over and over again. What a timeless tale! My thanks to Elizabeth Gaskell and BBC!",1238112000,4,798,4.15483870967742

It jumps right into the soup of life with the characters and situations surrounding them. The acting is superb, setting you up to dislike the ""villan"" in the beginning...and then warming to them. The heartwrenching nature of living life like a slave in textile mills was brought home by getting to ""know"" them.
It was long enough to become fully engaged in story and characters lives. By the end I knew I need to watch the ending a second time. It is a new family favorite.",1237852800,,575,4.58252427184466

2222808,5,B0007N1BBC,"My hubby and I just happened to sit down and start watching this last night after having gone to the films for a date since our toddler had just finally gotten to sleep and we ended up staying up and watching all 4 57 minute episodes as we have this as part of the Elizabeth Gaskell collection.  It was THAT good.  Richard Armitage's Thornton, as someone else mentions, just smolders on the screen - his deep, soul-piercing looks at the actress that plays Margaret just sent thrills up my spine.  The story is very much a Pride and Prejudice type tale, with some reversals - Thornton has Darcy's pride and reserve and is misunderstood by the 'Lizzie' type - Margaret - in some ways, but unlike P and P, he is the one who is socially 'below' Margaret, who is a gentleman's/parson's daughter, and the daughter of a member of the nobility/society, and has lived amongst the social belles of London.  Margaret has not been exposed before going to the industrial town of Milton to the extreme poverty and dreariness of the early booming industrial revolution, and the exposure/comparison to that environment compared to the idyllic countryside and flower-filled scenery around her beloved parsonage home of Hellstone are a shock to her and her mother.  Margaret, however, is a strong, independent woman, the equal in many ways to the temperament and strength of Thornton, though his violent treatment of one of his employees repels and shocks her when they first meet, and sets the stage for her hate which eventually turns to love.  The proposal scene is also very much like Austen's between Darcy and Elizabeth.  I have not read the novel so cannot compare to how this production differs from Gaskell's book, but I have loved all the Gaskell novel adaptations by the BBC and so far this is over and above my favorite, as the love story is so engrossing alongside the historical details of the early cotton mills.  The sets and costumes are also amazing, as well as the acting by the rest of the cast, particularly the lady who plays Thornton's mother - incredible.  Really, top notch all the way.",1235260800,3,2093,4.728021978021978

I have to say I was a little dubious at first: the DVD is a little expensive, but ultimately very worth it! All the praise is true: this film adaptation is beautifully acted and filmed. I dropped everything and watched the whole thing in one sitting. Certainly on par with my all time favorite A&E P&P adaptation w/ C.Firth and J.Ehle.

Ofcourse I thought at first it wouldn't be a good film and would just be boring. I was wrong.....Since many reviews talk about the story, I wiill not do so but the story is amazing. I laughed, I cied, and I was shocked watching it. Despite that, the scene of the industrial revolution was very real. Based on a novel of the same name written in 1855, 5 years after the peak of the industrial revolution, the settings are almost identical to our history text book.

2222815,5,B0007N1BBC,"I love this BBC series!!!  I am a fan of English historical movies and this has become one of my favorites.  The photography, costumes and scene work of this movie are breathtaking.  The range of emotions portrayed by the characters is a tribute to their skill in the craft of acting.  The time period of this movie creates a wonderful clash between the need to modernize versus the beauty of simple, rural English life.

The subtile romance between the two lead characters that develops throughout the movie is acted to perfection and very romantic.  In the movie, she transforms him from an ill tempered man/boy into a more compassionate man and he transforms her into more of realist but yet does not break her spirit.  As is typical with English romance, they both battle their pride and love until they are finally completed by each other.

If you like ""Pride and Prejudice"" with Kiera Knightly(sp) or ""Emma"" Gweneth Paltrow, you will love this mini-series.",1233878400,3,962,4.823170731707317

Good character devlopment, brilliant sets and staging, engaging characters and situations--thoroughly enjoyable. I think I liked it better the second time around because (plot spoiler--maybe--) I knew the two main characters WERE going to get together in the end (in a very nice way :^)) and I was able to sit back and enjoy the ride more instead of getting annoyed with all their misunderstandings. :^)",1233273600,2,820,4.623287671232877

Gaskell's tale is wonderfully told (read the book if you haven't already) and the acting is excellent.

2222825,4,B0007N1BBC,"Other reviewers set my expectations very high by comparing this series with Pride and Prejudice, so I was a little disappointed. Had I not expected Pride and Prejudice or better, I wouldn't have been disappointed at all. The acting is great but I wasn't crazy about the actress playing Margaret, I couldn't detect much emotion on her face, mostly that same blank stare she keeps through the whole thing. My main problem with it are all the changes from the book, I guess they ran out of time and a at some points the story gets disjointed and some parts do not make sense to me. I read the book after watching the series which helped a lot making sense of the whole thing, I wished they had not changed the story so much from the original.
If I compared this to Pride and Prejudice I would only give it 2.5 stars, P&B was much closer to the book and the story and characters more developed, Jane Austen's wit is far superior in my opinion as well. By itself, I'll give it a 4 since I love those period series and the DVD was good enough to get me to read the book.",1231200000,2,1064,4.246305418719212
2222826,5,B0007N1BBC,"North and South is a powerful narrative about two people, separated by class and culture, and the larger social issues that keep them apart but ultimately unite them. The story is supported by a ridiculously talented cast; brilliant, subtle direction; and a sumptuous, soaring score. While some may feel that the largely industrial setting detracts from the overall appeal of the film, director Percival ""pastoralizes"" the ""dirty, smoky"" town of Milton, and the viewer finds beauty in the pride and work ethic of many of Milton's people, transforming it into a natural world of sorts, amplified by the snowy appearance of the bits of cotton that drift about the mill, and the daily ""country walks"" Margaret (Daniela Denby-Ashe) takes through the local cemetery. There are other wonderful juxtapositions, like the dark-haired, black-clad John Thornton (portrayed to perfection by Richard Armitage, a new favorite), as he strides masterfully amid the white cotton drifts at Marlborough Mills. Positively delightful. If you appreciate literary adaptations, period dramas, or, simply, a story well told, North and South is definitely the sort of film you want in your personal collection.",1230595200,2,1184,5.405405405405405

2222828,5,B0007N1BBC,"What is there left to say that has not already been written in the previous 300 odd posts? Nothing. So I'm just going to say simply, that this is the best period piece and the best BBC miniseries I've ever seen (and I've seen them all). The story is beautiful, the actors are fabulous, there is not really a single misstep in the entire production. But with that said, I do think that parts 3 and 4 of the series are a bit rushed, I think the series would've benefited from 5 parts instead of 4. Especially with part 4, so much was condensed and covered into 45 minutes that it didn't quite match the pace of the first two parts, and because of that felt a bit fragmented.

Anyway, if you're thinking about buying this, than I couldn't recommend it more. Just do it. Everyone that rents it I'm sure ends up purchasing it.

The cinematography is beautiful, artistic and effective and really conveyed that period in time, while the score perfectly captures the mood of the piece. And of course, it goes without saying that all the acting is superb. They really chose the right people to play each and every character. Without knowing anything about this piece, I found the storyline to be completely compelling and engaging, with humor, tragedy and drama taking place in an uncertain and exciting time in British history.

It is truely a classic love story,of two people who are both stubborn,but love each other and won't give in until it is almost too late. Margaret does not understand the ways of the north in manufacturing and Thornton does not understand the ways of the south, which is more of a carefree lifestyle and not so harsh.

The original story, written by Elizabeth Gaskell, has a lot to recommend it. I learned something about the culture of the times, the prejudices that existed and the friction that developed as the result of the industrial revolution.

I think she goes way beyond Jane Austen and actually more closely resembles Dickens in that she was a social critic, a writer who was not totally focused on romance and the social restrictions inherent in the English ""caste"" system of the time.

Not to suggest she didn't care about romance; the ending of this series, that scene at the train station, is the single most romantic movie moment I've seen in many, many years. It brought tears to my eyes. Women will absolutely melt.

As is typical of these BBC series, the acting is uniformly excellent. I was familiar with the luminously beautiful Daniella Denby-Ashe from the British soap EastEnders. Richard Armitage is a revelation as the factory owner, and as his mother, Sinead Cusack is outstanding in the role of a seemingly cold and unfeeling widow, who demonstrates a fierce loyalty to her son.",1223856000,5,1009,4.7272727272727275

And the mother - has the most captivating accent and dark demeanor.

The story features two characters from different levels of society, set against the background of the industrial north of England in the 19th century.

Margaret hates the north, to which she has been forced to move, and especially the privileged mill owner, John Thornton, whom she sees as exploiting the working class.

The story follows them as they both change their minds about many things and as Margaret becomes accustomed to her new locale and its needs. Both rise above their prejudices.

The exploration of this time and place was very well done and interesting. The casting was very good, the sets were convincing, and the production was powerful.",1221350400,4,819,4.706293706293707

It took me a little time to adjust to a couple of the accents.  Especially that of Mrs. Thornton.  There are one or two spots where clips of a scene are re-used.  But overall, this is one of the absolute best adaptations of a novel ever done.

2222870,5,B0007N1BBC,"I am a huge BBC period miniseries fan.  Okay, to be honest, I'm a huge BBC series fan, but period miniseries are always my favorites.  I watched ""North and South"" based on an automated 'if you like this then watch this' feature on a website, and boy, was I wowed by what I saw. This is probably the best BBC miniseries since the mid-90s ""Pride and Prejudice"" with Colin Firth--if you like that series, go watch this NOW.

""North and South"" is a captivating mix of romance and industrial strife. The miniseries is set in Milton an industrial mill town in northern England (played beautifully in the series by Edinburgh, Scotland--if you've ever been there you'll recognize the familiar crags in the cemetery scenes), where the Hale family has moved from their home in Hampshire. Margaret, the Hale daughter, is taken aback by the grit of industry.  She quickly meets Mr. Thornton, a local mill owner. After a good deal of clashing (think Elizabeth and Darcy), a mill strike, and lots of drama, a love develops.

I think what makes ""North and South"" so wonderful is that combination of romance and political intrigue.  Margaret does not sit idly or wander around the countryside all the time--rather, she is engaged with the mill workers and the owners, and learns enough to engage in interesting debate about workers rights. It's her intellect that softens Mr. Thornton as much as her looks, and it's wonderful to watch her in action.  The entire cast is superb--I especially love Daniela Denby-Ashe--I hope I see her in something else soon!

As I said at the beginning of this review--if you're a P&P fan, or a Dickens, or Bronte fan, go see this miniseries immediately.  The four hours will be well worth your time--I can't wait to watch it again!",1219276800,4,1748,4.742574257425742

2222873,5,B0007N1BBC,"Though I love many of the BBC products, Elizabeth Gaskell's North and South a top 2 favorite of anything I've viewed.
  The characters are so well portrayed.  They brought you to believe in their causes, even on opposing sides of the issues,  and you could tangibly feel their emotions in various scenes.

  The three lead characters, John Thornton, Nicholas Higgins and Margaret Hale were strong in their ideals and communicated these  effectively. Yet very interestingly, in their personal relationships, specifically the proposal scene, John Thornton and Margaret Hale are  communicating on seemingly different 'frequencies' and misinterpreting each others words at every statement. You literally feel the frustration of their conversation.  You can however, understand their previous communications and feelings lend themselves to these statement misinterpretations.

  One reason I was so drawn to this story were the high ideals and morality of  Thornton and Higgins to do 'the right thing' regarding workers/co-workers and to be men of their word with great integrity.  The  great mutual respect they end up having for one another is so well deserved and fits with their character portrayals.  Their integrity and morality makes them two of my favorite characters of all time and one reason N&S is in my top 2 pick.

  Margaret also has ideal of trying to do 'what is right', yet her character at times seems to hold on to a bit of a grudge.  She also seems 'sleepy'/dullish in faculties at times(very limited though).

  As for feeling the emotion, (SPOILER ALERT) Margaret's departure scene from Thornton's mill - you feel it inside!  Also as she says goodbye to the Higgins'. Other spots, when Thornton finally gets she has a brother in Spain- you go ""YEAAAAH"".  And there are others.

  When I got this dvd, I literally watched it 4 times in 1 week.
There are so many nuances and fine points to the characters and scenes, as well as the repeated yellow roses which I only noticed in half the spots till about the third time.

  This story comes more alive each time I watch.  I won't easily tire of it if ever.

2222881,5,B0007N1BBC,"What a fabulous series. I spent the 4 most amazing hours watching it. I did not want it to end!

The cast is unforgetable with Richard Armitage as the stern, proud but compelling John Thornton,(he's so darn gorgeous!) and the lovely Daniela Denby-Ashe as the headstrong and forthright but charming Margaret Hale.

There's many similarities between, this series and Pride and Prejudice but it stands out brilliantly.
It's about a woman, Margaret Hale, from the South who moves from her romantic, sleepy laidback village, with her family, to the North and whose life collides with that of an intemperate if misunderstood industrialist, the charismatic mill-owner, John Thornton, in a bustling, northern city of Milton.

Instantly she gets into a dispute with him over his harsh treatment of an employee.
What she doesn't notice is Thornton's deep sense of responsibility for his employees' welfare. On the other hand, he misinterprets some of Margaret's own actions and intentions. But he is instantly attracted to her, while she has only the deepest contempt for him.
 Later, she refuses his offer of marriage, only to realise far too late the kind of man he really is. Hard and harsh he may be, but he's also a man of stength and intergrity but it seems he no longer feels the same way he did about her, after catching her in a compromising situation... but despite it all, he still protects her reputation.
And that's another tangled web to watch unravel.

Like in most period drama's, they both are stubborn and drag out their obvious attraction over many painful months and events, and I loved every bit of it.

This series rates right up there for me along with Pride and Prejudice, and Jane Eyre... perhaps ever higher. It's beautifully filmed and has some heart-wrenching moments that causes a tear or two.
 I think John Thornton is the most romantic hero and he definitely beats Darcy, hands down. And I LIKE Darcy!
A definite keeper for me.",1214956800,9,1948,4.867069486404834
2222882,5,B0007N1BBC,"This is by far one of the best BBC dramas I've seen.  I was disappointed when I found out it was not aired on PBS Masterpiece Theater, but I'm glad to have the DVD copy.  It's truly a classic from Elizabeth Cleghorn Gaskell (also the author of ""Cranford"" and ""Wives and Daughters"") that shows the simple and complex dimensions of personal and societal struggle after a rural family moves from Hampshire to Milton in the north of England.

Daniela Denby-Ashe is very unwavering as the heroine, Margaret Hale.  Her performance is superb in her simplified, yet gracious manner.  Richard Armitage is also wonderful as mill owner, John Thornton.  Their on-screen chemistry is fantastic.  Most of all the series episodes are so riveting that I had to get up to put in the next DVD right away!  If you love great stories with depth and humanity, not just costume dramas, then check this one out and buy it.",1214784000,3,899,4.681528662420382
2222883,5,B0007N1BBC,"I enjoy Mrs. Gaskell's books, so I was surprised to find myself agreeing with the many liberties the screenwriter took here.  In the book, much of Margaret's dislike of Thornton hinges on his being in trade rather than a gentleman, which just made her seem like a snob to me. The dramatic fight scene created a real tension and reason for her antipathy. I was glad to have one less death, and the way other information was doled out made much more dramatic sense, too.  The technical aspects of the production are amazing and the actors are just incredible, particularly Richard Armitage and Sinead Cusack.

My one complaint is the proposal scene, which was cut to shreds, apparently, to the point that it doesn't always make sense from moment to moment. Also, in the book Margaret's vigorous refusal is motivated in part by what she has overheard Fanny Thornton saying about her behavior during the riot, but in the movie it's not clear whether she overhears Fanny at all.

The train scene is anachronistic, but so well done, who cares?  It's wonderful to imagine Mrs. Thornton's reaction when the two of them get back to Milton.",1214352000,5,1130,4.744897959183674

It features an extremely talented cast, stunning costumes and cinematography, and a message that truly touches the heart. I highly recommend this title both for entertainment and instructional purposes. I believe it relates to modern times as the economy of America is on the brink of Depression. The sufferings of the poor can be seen throughout this film at the cotton mills and can be seen today with rising gas prices and food costs.

The relationship between John and Margaret is also amazing. The chemistry felt between Richard and Daniela is truly mind boggling. You can feel their pain, their loneliness, and their love. It is truly amazing.

Noteworthy are the leads especially Richard Armitage who embodied John Thornton.  This man can act!  I agree that ""He really does manage to convey his character's thoughts and feelings without saying a word"".  The body language, those expressive eyes (WOW!!!).  Many powerful scenes that are unforgettable:
  1. Margaret's entry into the Carding Room of the Mill.
  2. Thornton's ""Look back at me"".
  3. Margaret's ""I think I've seen hell, It's white, snow white""
  as Thornton's silhouette glides through the ""fluff"".

2222887,5,B0007N1BBC,"I'm a fan of Victorian-era movies in general, but this is one of my favorites for several reasons.  First, it's more like Charles Dickens than Jane Austen, which is a welcome plot/theme change.  It's nice to see people with real struggles other than getting married, and it's nice to see more than just upper middle-class and upper-class people portrayed.

Second, the characters are good people, but far from perfect.  John Thornton brutally beats a man for smoking in his factory.  Margaret Hale has a number of rude moments with Thornton and lies to cover up her brother's involvement in a man's death (though the circumstances of course make it more understandable).  I don't like seeing movies that portray completely dysfunctional or depraved people, but I also like characters to be realistic and human.  I think the portrayal of characters in this movie struck a very good balance in that area.

Third, the political issues in the movie are very fairly presented for both sides.  The union workers are portrayed as honest, hard-working men who are only trying to earn a fair wage to support their families.  I do have to say that most of the mill owners are portrayed as greedy fat cats, but Thornton not so much.  He's portrayed as being tough but fair with his workers, and in some cases even generous.  And throughout the movie he makes some very good cases for capitalism.  Overall, it shows that neither side is perfect, and that the biggest problem affecting relations between the workers and masters is not greed or grumbling, but a refusal (at least at first) to understand each other.

Overall, this is an excellent movie.  I do have to agree with those who have bashed the closing scene--it would have been absolutely scandalous to kiss in public in Victorian society.  As far as I'm concerned, other than that scene, it's pretty much a perfect movie.

2222889,3,B0007N1BBC,"Whenever a movie or book is universally acclaimed, there are two possibilities: either it is the greatest thing since The Iliad or it appeals to a particular interest strongly felt by a number of people.  This movie is not The Iliad.

Most BBC miniseries period dramas have a number of different things going on and offer a number of appeals.  They should, with four hours to play around with.  North & South, by contrast, is a one-note movie.  Even though it begins with a sympathetic view of the plight of the heroine dragged away from the beautiful countryside to the smoke and dirt of the Midlands, this occupies only a few minutes.  For the next two hours, the movie drums away at the plight of the workers.

It does TELL the management side in brief quick dialogue that most people will not understand if they are not in business themselves.  The labor side, however, is SHOWN in grueling detail.  About 1% of screen time is devoted to stating management's side, about 60% to showing labor's side.  If management's side had been dramatized (cheap American cotton driving down profits, threatening the survival of the English cotton industry, etc.), there would have been conflicting feelings on the part of the viewer and real drama.  As it is, we ""know"" that management is the bad guy.

Much of the time, the leading lady is wandering around the dirty streets (which gives the camera more time to show the miserable living conditions of the workers) or lamenting with her family.

In the second half, characters drop like flies one after the other.  ""That takes care of the deaths,"" the screenwriter seems to be saying, ""Now, let's get these two together somehow.""  Deus comes riding out of the machina and does the job.

Bottom line: recommended for Laborites, Leftists, and Marxists.

Not recommended for anybody else.",1213142400,14,1827,4.823151125401929
2222890,5,B0007N1BBC,"I first stumbled upon ""North and South"" on Youtube one night and I was instantly captured by the beauty of this film. Before I was done watching it, I ordered the DVD from Amazon and (because of its length) it actually arrived before I had the time to finish watching it online (Amazon's delivery on this was fast thankfully).
If you are a fan of period films or the adaptations of Jane Austen's work, you will LOVE North and South. It has all of the heart of your favorite period film but with a touch more realism; its characters don't spend their lives going from tea with friends to balls in pretty gowns. Instead there is a real story here with the undertones of different classes clashing, the emergence of new wealth with the industrial revolution, and best of all a hero to perhaps (gasp!) rival the beloved Mr. Darcy. Richard Armitage and Daniela Denby-Ashe do an awesome job as the two main characters and there is a real chemistry between them.
My only complaint is plot wise, I could have done with some more interaction between Margaret and Mr. Thornton besides the wonderful ending. Otherwise its a great movie to watch on a long quiet afternoon or whenever you're trying to procrastinate on that darned never ending homework!",1212883200,5,1240,4.666666666666667
2222891,5,B0007N1BBC,"Excellent!  A bit grittier than is typical in many period pieces such as those by Jane Austen, but that only made it more believable.  In addition to enjoying a great drama, I also feel like I learned a bit about the divisions geographically in England during this time period with the up-and-coming innovative and industrial North (and Northern ""ways"" as it's put in the film) and the more pastoral South where money is made more in financial deals than in industry (in which a 'gentleman' would only ""dabble"" for entertainment, not something as crude as money, etc). Also, a great star-crossed romance around which all of this drama occurs.  I highly recommend this.

The film also highlights the incredible differences in class structure in English society of that time. The relationship between John Thornton and Margaret Hale smoulders with sexual tension throughout. Richard Armitage plays the role of a lifetime reminiscent of Colin Firth's, Mr. Darcy.",1211328000,3,502,4.988095238095238
2222897,5,B0007N1BBC,"I actually found this movie while shuntering around youtube, laughing through someone's silly period film montage. Upon investigation, I learned that the movie was called North and South, a 4-hour BBC production of Elizabeth Gaskell's love story of the same name, set during the 1850s industrial revolution. Having never read Gaskell's novel myself BUT having seen various clips of a handsome leading man I, of course, had to see this movie. And I am so glad I did because it is now one of my all-time favorites.

  I am not going to give away the story by providing an extensive summary of the movie. I will say, though, that the collaborations in this film -from the screenplay, music, the performances, direction, cinematography, all the way down to the set design- just absolutely work, and you don't see many made-for-television movies that can do well in all those departments and that, furthermore, compliment each other as this one has done. It all seamlessly comes together to make North and South one of the best TV movies I have ever seen. It could certainly rival some of the best feature-length films I've seen as well, and I have seen A LOT of movies.

  For lack of a more praising word, the acting is superb. All the supporting actors bring great depth and feeling to their respective roles. But no other characters in the film have such on-screen chemistry as the two leads, Daniela Denby-Ashe and Richard Armitage, who both give excellent, award-worthy performances. Since my first viewing of the movie, I have read and appreciated the novel and, looking back on it now, Denby-Ashe was fabulous for the part of Margaret; she had just the right amount of sauciness and spirit. But she also gave the character a bit of feminine grace that I think greatly improved the headstrong Margaret by making her appear warmer and more empathetic. In the novel, Margaret seems unreasonably cold and snobbish at times, and I didn't particularly like her, although I did admire the fact that Gaskell had created a rather modern sort of heroine in an era when women were restricted by their gender.

  Obviously, Richard Armitage's portrayal of mill owner, John Thornton, is one of the most passionate yet tortured performances ever, and he undoubtedly has the best smoldering capabilities out there; he is, in a word, fascinating to watch. He really does manage to convey his character's thoughts and feelings without ever saying a word; he is a very detail-oriented actor. I've read several reviews that compare his performance to Colin Firth's in Pride and Prejudice. While I personally haven't seen this adaptation that made Firth a sex symbol, after seeing Armitage in John Thornton's rolled-up sleeves and vest, I honestly neither feel the need, nor the desire to. Thornton, in print and on-screen, is a more intriguing, more complex character than Darcy, and I would take North and South and Richard Armitage, with his lofty height and brooding, dark good-looks, over Colin Firth and his Pride and Prejudice any day.

Devout followers of the novel should have very little to complain about with this version, as it is a very faithful adaptation. Sandy Welch has interpreted the story in a way that retains the novel's essence and romanticism very well. Obviously, some scenes in the book had to be adjusted for timing purposes, but instead of detracting from the course of events, as it could easily have done, it actually fleshes them out. Fans of the book may be outraged by what happens in Thornton's first scene (which was not in the book). But if you listen to the commentary the writer explains her reason for creating it and it's a valid reason because it really was necessary to initiate that kind of drama. But what people have to realize is that with any film adaptation you've got to be able to take it with a grain of salt. This one does not veer from the original source too often, so to see this new scene and the final scene of the movie, which was also rewritten for the screen, works for the kind of film that you've been watching for the last 3 and half hours.",1211241600,15,4087,4.784397163120567
2222898,5,B0007N1BBC,"Thank you BBC for a movie worth watching! (there are so few out there these days). This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It reminded me a little of Pride and Prejudice, but with a new twist, giving it a feel of its own that kept the viewer captivated the entire 4 hours.

It highlighted characters of differing social spheres and put them all together in a way that gave the viewer a unique insight into that particular time period. I'm not a big history buff, but even so, found it very interesting to watch the workings of the cotton mill and all of the politics involved between the ""masters"" and workers, and so forth.

And the love story was very nice - the thread that held it all together. It was a rough road, but it was heart-warming to see how the two main characters evolved and softened towards each other as the film went on. I also thought the heroine was cast a little differently from what you usually see in these movies, adding more interest overall. A movie definitely worth seeing!",1210723200,4,1012,4.377659574468085

I liked both the movie and the book for their own qualities, although I have to complain about making Mr. Thornton look meaner in the movie than he actually was in the book.  He was way too good looking to stay mad at, though. The storyline reminds me strongly of ""Pride and Prejudice"" and the evolution of feelings the lead characters have to go through to find their love for each other.

Acting in this series is just superb!  It's amazing how much Richard Arimatage was able to convey so much of tormented psych of Thornton so accurately.  His subtle glances, facial expressions and the slight movements all are just John Thornton himself (5 stars for Richard Armitage!!).

2222911,4,B0007N1BBC,"First I must say that I have not read the book (yet), nor did I go into viewing this with any expectations of any sort.

I found the beginning of the script's plotline very choppy -- it didn't make sense to me, nor did it give a good introduction to the characters, particularly the two lead characters -- Thornton and Margaret.  She came across as careless of her poor suitor's feelings, and a bit cruel -- Thornton as far too brutish in his opening scene.  It was clear without even reading the book (or knowing anything about it) that a huge amount was being hacked out of the story.

I also felt that the editing left a lot to be desired in many places -- the extended proposal scene in the dvd extras is much, much better than the chopped up scene in the actual program, where the character's responses to each other don't even make sense in some spots.

Ultimately, what finally saves this production from mediocrity is the acting.  Richard Armitage and Sinead Cusack in particular were simply brilliant.  Armitage captured the essence of the pain and longing of unrequited love in his every look.  Cusack took what could have been a very cliched overbearing mother and made her strong, warm, loving and protective.  I also felt that Brendon Coyle added a lot in his part as Nicholas Higgins.  And though I found it hard to really like Margaret, I cannot fault Ms. Denby-Ashe's technique in any way -- I feel that a bit better writing might have made the character more sympathetic.

Still well worth viewing, just for the strong performances by nearly all of the cast.  Just have a little patience with the plotline, and scripting.",1207008000,6,1638,4.610344827586207

2222918,5,B0007N1BBC,"North and South is fantastic! There have been many comparisons between this and Pride and Prejudice -- and there are indeed many parallels -- however North and South is more gritty and raw then the refined P&P. I love Jane Austen and worship all her works, but I was captivated by this story. Richard Armitage plays a tempered, passionate John Thorton, whose outward cruelty towards his mill-workers softens as he begins to fall in love with the indomniable Margaret Hale, who is kind and gives her opinions as freely as her cares. Where Thorton is ruled by a strong sense of reason, Margaret is guided by her firm moral compass; both, like Darcy and Elizabeth, are proud and prejudiced. The viewer will be frustrated as every opportune moment for the characters to reveal their feelings are cut short by an interruption or a distraction -- be it Thorton's sister, the death of close family members or a mill-strike. Touching too, is the chemistry between the leads and the absolute ardent innocence of them -- Thorton's face softens and glows when he encounters Margaret; Margaret becomes coy and moved by Thorton. Set against a gritty class-struggle, industrial might, and the change of times (brilliantly metaphored by the Exhibition scene), North and South is perfect, in its portrayal of a deep romance between two very different -- but very good -- people as they overcome the impedances of assumption, spurned love, priorities, death, life, the pride of regionalism, and the prejudice of the heart, to fall into one of the greatest love stories ever told.

Outstanding preformances by all the leads, particularily the malicious but oddly-endearing Mrs. Thorton played by Sinead Cusack. I found this and bought it on a whim because I love the composer (Martin Phipps) and wanted to hear more of his music. The score absolutely elevates this film and I loathe that it has not been released. What a wonderful whim that I bought it! I highly recommend that anyone see this.

When watching for this for the first time, I was so engrossed in the film that I didn't stop watching until it was finished. Having never read the book, I didn't know what to expect and there were many delightful surprises along the way. I now plan to read the novel and hope to fall in love with it as much as I have this movie.

The character of John Thornton is so incredibly beautiful and poignant, and was handled just right by the wonderful Richard Armitage. Not only does he bring the necessary hardness to the role, but he brings a rare vulnerability to the role, that makes him such a diverse individual. He grabs you in with those eyes of his, and makes you want to know all there is about him. In many ways he is similar to Mr. Darcy, but I found him to be almost, more real if that makes and sense. The depth and diversity that he puts into the character makes him so unique to these types of films and you'll find it hard to resist his charms. I daresay he is probably the sexiest man (and character) in these period novels that I have ever read or seen a movie of.

The heroine, Margaret is also one of great character, and Daniela Denby Ashe pulls it off with great poise and sensibility. While I was angry when she rejected Mr. Thornton (how could she???), the beauty of the scene is that the two play off eachother so well, and make you believe what's going on is real. His I do not with to possess you, because I love you line is one of the most heart wrenching things, and her refusal of him is so heartbreakingly good, that it will leave you eagerly anticipating the next episode.

Overall one of the greatest period pieces ever, and probably one of the most beautiful films as well. The simplicity in the main theme is so breathtakingly beautiful, that you will be humming it days after seeing it. And the image at the end of the first episode, of Thornton walking through the mill with all the cotton in the air will also be etched in your mind as well. The music and that image blend so beautifully together, and really create one of the most mesmerizing and memorable scenes in television history.",1205107200,11,2375,4.330337078651685
2222928,1,B0007N1BBC,"I was expecting this to be a sappy chick flick.  It was better in some ways, and much worse in others.

What it lacked in vapid emotionalistic romance, it made up in a heroine who is horribly self-centered, feministic and manipulative, a story in which the heroine doesn't take responsibility for her questionable actions, has a very egocentric morality and behaves reprehensibly, lying to police investigators, luring a mutinous brother to town which causes the death of a man, insulting her apostate father's successor at his vicarage, stringing along an obviously still-smitten former suitor while it suits her needs.

Add to this the BBC's relentless socialist touches to the film, sloppy modern additions like the ridiculous kissing scene in the train station, and cardboard characters on par with the later Star Wars movies, and you have a real mess.

There's much, much more to dislike.  Don't waste your time.

It takes us through the life of a woman who lived in the southern rural part of England with her parents.  He father abruptly moves their little family to the northern urban part of England, with a faster-paced city life, which takes its toll on the family.

In the process, however, much good happens to the family, and they are able to change their ways and also end up changing their attitudes on things that they had before prejudged.

2222943,5,B0007N1BBC,"""North and South"" : a BBC miniseries.
Magnificent.
Not what I first thought when I opened this gift for Christmas. Having never heard of the series, I raised an eyebrow at the handsome man on the cover and put it among my other gifts.
Tonight, my family and I watched the complete series without interruption. How else could we have watched it?!
After each of the hour long episodes, I was literally screaming in frustration/agony at the happenings in the episode.
Well-crafted with a deliciously dark reality concerning cotton-filled air of the Industrial Revolution's cotton factories in England and the cultural, occupational differences that can divide citizens even of the same country.
Certainly makes ""Pride and Prejudice"" seem a walk in the park, not to demean that wonderful series at all.
Character development: excellent. It was both terrifying and relieving to see what turns the plot took for the characters. The soundtrack added immensely to the series, the soaring theme in the background reinforcing the action on the screen. I'll be looking for that one to add to my collection.
Though it may seem that Miss Margaret and Mr. Thornton will never be together...the implications and growing romance (and outright refusal of such feelings) are tantalizing. The series keeps you  twisting in painful suspense up to the very end, which elicited applause and general joy from my family members watching.

Definitely, definitely will re-watch.",1199404800,8,1452,5.200854700854701
2222944,5,B0007N1BBC,"If you want to know what happens, see ""Most Helpful Review"" and others following it--I'll save you time by skipping any recounting of the plot.
I love a good romance more than most. But let's get beyond the romance to the nitty-gritty.
SALIENT POINTS:
CASTING--The production is perfectly cast--one comes away with the conviction (as with ""Pride and Prejudice""--(Firth/Ehle version) that no other actors could possibly have filled any of these roles half so well. Whoever cast this should be knighted.
STANDOUT PERFORMANCES--Others have commented so thoroughly on the portrayal of Margaret and Thornton--and Mrs. Thornton--nothing more need be said.
I want to highlight--
 (1.) actor Brendan Coyle's portrayal of Higgins, the mill worker.  His family's painful poverty make the Cratchits in  Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"" appear flush by comparison.  Coyle brings Higgins to life with a melding of gritty determination, mischief and wit--see if he doesn't remind you of Bruce Willis (yes, Bruce Willis) in ""Armageddon""--going up against impossible people in authority, yet outwitting them all. Coyle gives Higgins layered dimension.  In so doing, he makes the workers' plight all the more affecting. The viewer confronts the painful truth that these people on the bottom of society have much to offer, but being locked into their station in life, their gifts and talents are lost.  Higgins will become one of your favorites.
(2.) With a score of characters of such depth, it might be easy to overlook Higgins' daughter Bessie. Played by the actress who endeared herself to everyone as ""Esther"" in another BBC standout production, ""Bleak House,"" she gives another heart-wrenching performance.
SPEAKING OF ""BLEAK HOUSE""--Steel yourself, this production is bleak. But the subject matter requires it to be exactly that. In Pride and Prejudice, no one dies.  N& S isn't as bad as the death scene in Hamlet where almost no one is left standing, but by Episode Four, one begins to wonder who'll be next. I'm not surprised to learn of the close professional relationship the author had with Charles Dickens---her book is truly Dickensian in theme, characters, setting and mood.  I felt his influence in every scene. This is not a criticism--her purpose, much like his, was to expose the tragic non-life of those who went unnoticed, almost unseen, by the upper classes in England.
NO, IT'S NOT P&P--But buy it anyway, as I'm about to do, since my college-age daughter, who brought it home this Christmas claiming it was the best thing she'd seen since P&P, wouldn't let me slip it out of her suitcase when she packed to return to grad school today. (sigh) I must now buy my own.
COMPARISONS--You will be tempted to compare N&S in almost every aspect to P&P. Those who are P&P purists (I am one) will find the comparison to be unfavorable--but also unjust.  The subject matter is so much darker, such comparisons are apples and oranges.  If P&P is the Rolls Royce of period novel productions, N&S comes in at least as a Bentley.

You have a serious (no pun intended) treat in store.",1199318400,6,3071,5.025590551181103
2222945,5,B0007N1BBC,"I bought this right after it came out on DVD without knowing at all what I was getting.  It was probably the most worthwhile purchase I've made in years.  North & South is the best period piece I've seen, better even than well-beloved adaptations of Jane Austen.  It's beautifully scored and beautifully filmed-- some of the best scenes are those within the cotton mill, really otherworldly and wintry and gorgeous.  I love the story-- it deals not only with the society and the romance and the family dramas, but quite a bit of the social commentary and class conflicts that typify Elizabeth Gaskell's novels.  It's just a pleasure to watch.

If you like this you would probably also like another recent BBC miniseries-- Dickens' Bleak House.  A lot darker and about twice as long but well made.",1199145600,9,796,4.766423357664234

The only negative part is to note the immodesty in which the women in part 2 of the four part series are dressed.  The rest was so tastefully done that this inclusion was a downright shame.

2222955,5,B0007N1BBC,"I've long heard about this British television series and finally ordered it for myself.  What followed was one of the finest times I've spent watching the TV.  This is a wonderful adaptation.
It tells the story of two people, John Thornton and Margaret Hale, who overcome prejudices and learn the world is more than they thought.
John Thornton is a mill owner from the northern town of Milton.  Margaret Hale is a parsons daughter from the southern town of Helston.  When Margaret and her family first move to Milton, she is horrified by what she sees.  She is appalled by the rough ways of John Thornton.  But over time, she comes to see he is an honorable man who truly cares about the people he has working for him.
John Thornton is a man who has risen out of the ashes of what his father did to the family and is a man of integrity and honour.  He is immediately drawn to Margaret though he feels he is not worthy of her affections.
The casting in this series is brilliant; the barely contained passion portrayed by the oh so handsome Richard Armitage and the ethereal innocent beauty of Margaret played by Daniela Denby-Ashe.  Sinead Cusak as John's very protective mother and Brendan Coyle as the admirable union leader Higgins - each brings a richness to this production.
Also of note is the fascinating clashes between rich and poor; between the mill owners and the people who work for them.
The scenery itself, from the hauntingly beautiful but deadly mill, to the idyllic countryside of Helston becomes an important backdrop to this romantic tale of two people who fall in love.
I can not recommend this series highly enough and I've already watched it numerous times myself.  Each time has been a treat and I've grown to love it even more with each viewing of this incredibly romantic tale.",1194825600,7,1801,4.638364779874214

2222958,5,B0007N1BBC,"I'm a Bronte fan. The dark love stories and Byronic characters in their books are so compelling compared to Austen's characters and their simplified lives, although entertaining as they were. So North and South is appealing as it is neither Bronte nor Austen but lies somewhere in between.

It must be said that Elizabeth Gaskell and Charlotte Bronte were friends and Mrs Gaskell was also much respected by Charles Dickens. Her stories reflected realities of life at the time. This is a story for all ages, of love, prejudice, class struggle and loss in changing times.

While the film stands well on its own, there were a few decisions I thought were difficult to agree with completely.

First, the decision to make John Thornton appear brutal when he and Margaret Hale first met was quite harsh on the character. Thornton was a sensitive gentleman, no matter how hard he was on his workers. He was also a doting son, a responsible brother and a fair master who had had his fair share of hard times but had always returned with his integrity intact. However the film makers explained there was no better way to show why Margaret had disliked him so much from their first meeting. In the book, he was rather timid when they met.

Secondly, Mr Bell's and Thornton's relationship was not cold at all in the book. Thornton showed him kindness and it was Mr Bell from whom Thornton had learned of several important things including Mr Hale's passing. All this was due to their mutual respect which did not come across in the film.

Last but not least, the kiss. No, I have no problem with it except it had taken place at a train station in broad daylight in the Victorian era. Yes, surely they had kissed in the book (""...some time of delicious silence"" didn't mean they were checking their mail quietly) but imagine how delicious it could have been had it been in private in each other's arms as it was in the book! And it would've still maintained Victorian decorum. Well, as least Victorian decorum away from public eyes.

Having said all that, Richard Armitage was perfect as Mr Thonton, from his oh so tall, dark and handsome looks that drove women to completely jam up BBC website to his John Thornton demeanour.

This is a story of a strong-willed woman named Margaret who's a vicars' daughter. She befriends a poor, sickly woman & her father and gets involved with the factory workers union strike (and her friends' dad works at the factory). The factory is owned by our hero John and we see throughout the story the stressful struggles he goes through to maintain the family business. We also see the growing feelings that Margaret and John have for each other as they bump heads and they are enjoyable to watch. The drama of the factory workers was very interesting as well.

There was one part in this movie when our two main characters first meet and having never heard or read the original story, I kept saying ""This is our hero?!"" and that was because of his shocking, off-putting opening scene. But as you keep watching you understand why he did what he did.

All in all I enjoyed this movie enough to add it to my collection. It was fun getting involved with each character and the story was good.

It was packed with tension and passion and I fell in love with all the characters in the story.  Unlike many period piece dramas of the same time period they were not concerned as much with shallow and material things as they were about more significant things such as other people and overcoming poverty with hard honest work.  The author made the characters seem REAL still having their flaws but all the while still not being quite as silly and trivial as you will find in other such movies.  I definitely recommend this movie to all BBC period piece lovers and was very glad to find the movie Family friendly as well!!!",1190851200,7,1073,4.741935483870968
2222968,5,B0007N1BBC,"I was so hesitant simply because I couldn't find a good plot summary for it. I decided to see it after reading the rave reviews on amazon. I agree completely with everyone this is THE BEST miniseries in a close tie with Bleak House, Pride and Prejudice (The Colin Firth version),and Wives and Daughters. This is a definite alternative to Jane Austen's miniseries. The only thing I to complain about is that the girl who plays Margaret has moments where she has this blank look on her face. Maybe thats her character, but I didn't get it in places. Fortunately that doesn't take away from the very well done miniseries.",1190764800,3,618,4.627272727272727

2222970,5,B0007N1BBC,"I purchased this movie as a birthday gift to myself a few months ago, mistakenly thinking I was getting the American Civil War mini-series, and was terribly disappointed to realize my mistake.

This past Monday I finally got around to watching it, and have watched it for hours every day since then.  Every special feature, director's commentary, cast bio's, everything.  I think I've seen it all the way through four times in less than a week!  I haven't been this taken with a movie since Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth over a decade ago.

North and South drew me in from the first scene onward, and didn't let me go.  I'm glad I didn't read the book first (though I am NOW),  if it would have ruined anything about this movie for me.  I'm in love with Richard Armitage, Brendan Coyle and the whole rest of the cast.  The directors deserve all the kudos in the world for this beautifully rendered classic.

I've never been more grateful for making a mistake in my life!  I'll still buy the OTHER ""North and South"" miniseries, but this one is destined to be my favorite always.",1190419200,12,1084,4.536082474226804
2222971,2,B0007N1BBC,"After reading the novel and greatly enjoying the story and characters, I was excited to find that there was a BBC production. It was extremely disappointing, however, when I realized that great liberties were taken with the plot. Many scenes are placed in completely different settings; many of the important philosophical dialogs are omitted; Nicholas Higgins is portrayed as much more refined and good-natured than in the novel; the final scene with Margaret and Mr. Thornton would have been much less Hollywood-like had the film faithfully followed the novel; and the list goes on. The one part of the movie that I actually did love, though, was Richard Armitage's portrayal of Mr. Thornton. It was on par with Colin Firth's amazing representation of Mr. Darcy in the Pride and Prejudice BBC production. Overall I think this film adaptation was disappointing, which is almost entirely due to its failure to accurately represent the novel. Had I not read the novel first, I probably would have enjoyed the movie much more.",1190246400,25,1024,5.06508875739645

The ""background"" characters hold their own and you are just as interested in them as the main characters. There is also quite a bit about unions and working conditions in this day and age of industrial revolution. No, it is not Marxist, it is ""Smithist"" in it's portrayal of masters and workers. Bottom line: it's four hours of pure enjoyment. Great movie, great cast, great music, great everything.

2222975,5,B0007N1BBC,"Always been a Jane Austen fan and I bought this video on spec. What a find - a gem of a film so wonderfully crafted. Was glued to it and viewed it continuously at least 6 times [viewers may think me crazy] Bought a second DVD when first one started skipping scenes. the ending I thought was abrupt- so to satisfy myself I started on a sequel which turned out beautifully [Margaret's marriage - having twins-almost dying in the process, John's passion and steadfastness- Henry marrying but yet being Margaret's lifelong friend- his wife's death and John and Margaret bringing up his children, Mrs. Thornton's death, John unable to accept her death and gradual deterioration and death at 55 years. Childrens marriages, Margaret's love for the downtrodden enabling her to spend her monies on a hospital and school and finally Henry marrying her when she is 55 years and a widow, thus realising his one dream and making Margaret's life come full circle right to the beginning where Henry first proposed to her at 19 years of age[I jsut felt he deserved to win her affections at whatever time in his life] I concluded the sequel in 2 days as the story just kept un-rolling itself in front of my eyes. I was so obsessed with North and South.

I got the book only thereafter and noted that the first chapter had been deleted completely as is expected in films. If it had been included even minutely it would have given more substance to the film. Incorporating Richard's dilemma in leaving the Church and the need to escape humiliation etc and Maria's and Margaret's own desolation at leaving their beloved Helston. Also throughout the book John undergoes so much pain of mind, confusion and a sense of inadequacy in making his intentions clear to Margaret. The absence of sufficient scenes I feel deprived him of showing this side of him.  However, the silent brooding and unspoken words [ facial expressions did the job very well indeed] John's role as the overbearing master was perfect. I also preferred the ending in the book which appeared to be more realistic than the train scene. But all in all a truly remarkable and breathtaking film. Lovely themes and the music was superb with an equally stunning cast.  Each supporting the other, enabling them to give of their best. I enjoyed Richard Armitage's  interview . Such a charming actor [ no airs and graces- hope he retains this quality throughout his career] I would rate it 10. Hats off to the cast. I hope BBC will contemplate doing a sequel to North and South. This film deserves one and perhaps the time is right. The same cast, director, producer and all would do it more than justice, I am sure.

Viewing this film made me also purchase the novel Ruth and the DVD Wives and Daughters and I was truly fascinated by viewing "" Who the Dickens was Elizabeth Gaskell ""[ special features ] It confirmed my view of Mrs. Gaskell.  Only a person who has experienced all the feelings and trials of life or witnessing  these first hand, could write such novels which are so relevant to this century as well. More fact than fiction.

My advice to period lovers- Buy it -you won't know what you have missed until you have seen this wonderful drama. You are sure to watch it over and over again.
Finally, if anyone would like to edit or improve on my maiden attempt in penning a sequel may do so via Amazon.com if they have no objection .",1189382400,6,3383,4.6173044925124795

2222977,5,B0007N1BBC,While looking for another Jane Austen film to buy for 'Girls Movie Night' for my 17yo daughter and I - I came upon North and South.  We watched one episode a night and anxiously awaited the next!  When we finished the entire movie we were ready to restart it again!  Wonderful shots in the mill........good characters.

2222978,5,B0007N1BBC,"I was sitting there, watching him watching her. Hoping that she would look back. I even repeated the same words he did. (I know that sounds funny but I love the character of Mr. Thornton). I didn't think I would love him especially when he beats a worker for smoking inside his mill at the beginning, but that just shows how much he cares about his workers that he doesn't want innocent men, women and children to die recklessly (especially after the way his father died, he understands suffering and loss and doesn't want a stupid,reckless, and unnecessary fire to take lives of innocent people trying to make a living and survive as best they know how.
After this scene, I knew that Mr. Thornton would have to work overtime for me to like him or even sympathize with him. Boy was I wrong! I could not keep my eyes off of him. Who knew that seriousness and brooding was so sexy?? And the precious moments where Mr. Thornton actually smiles are PRICELESS!! I could not watch only one episode. I was glued to the spot and watched all four episodes in one night. And until the end, i was keeping my fingers crossed for the two souls that had to meet and then part to understand what love is and that THEY had IT!

Richard is amazing in this as is Daniela. The chemistry between them is very believable. I got goosebumps when their fingers touch for a brief moment. It is moments like those that take the viewers breath away and transport you to their world. A world divided by differences,pride, misunderstanding but united by one strong tie- LOVE!!

If I could give North and South more stars, I would! It is absolutely amazing..riveting. The scenery is so dark in the North and so lively in the country yet i find myself favoring and loving the North, perhaps because of a certain jewel of a man named John?! ;)This movie is a jewel itself. A priceless one at that so please please see it. It will become a favorite for you, I'm sure of it! Watch their story... Experience their love!

Even the clothes of the characters is dark.  Plus I had a difficult time understanding some of the characters speech and what was going on.  This movie is was not what I expected at all.

Almost all of the characters are developed enough that I understood what drove them. I could also see a visible evolution of several characters throughout the movie as they were exposed to new people, cultures and ways of thinking.

I thought it portrayed fairly both sides of the workers and masters of the mills of the time.  I felt the awful struggle of the poor workers as well as the varying attitudes of the masters.

2222990,4,B0007N1BBC,"~~~""North & South"" is a period drama set in the 1800s in both the north and south of England. The story centers around Margaret Hale, a passionate southern belle; John Thornton, a strong-willed northern tradesman; and their respective families.  Margaret has grown up in country Helstone, surrounded by comfort, beauty, and society; now a young woman, Margaret's father decides to move to the north of England - much to the shock of all around him. In the move to the new town Milton, the Hale family comes in contact with the life of industrial mill workers and masters. It is here that we meet John Thornton, a wealthy, handsome, cotton mill owner; but he and Margaret are as far apart as east and west - at least on the surface. Yet the longer the Hales stay in Milton, the more they like it, and the more John and Margaret are attracted to and repulsed by one another; until the excellent ending.

~~~""North & South"" is a wonderful drama of two people caught in a web of misunderstanding and love. The characters are very much believable and the wardrobe was excellent. The cast is great for the movie; from moodily handsome Thornton, to hardily-built persistent Higgins. Personally, my favorite was Thornton, for he was much more complex than Margaret and a very interesting character.
~~~The setting of Milton might be a bit dark for some, with no brightly colored backdrop except in London and Helstone, but the characters themselves are very colorful with a very realistic multi-dimension to them.
~~~There is some issue with cleavage and corsets in this movie, both being in full use. Although most of Margaret's clothing is modest, I wouldn't recommend anyone under 10 years old to watch this movie (also the plot is a little confusing for younger ones).
~~~Anyway, besides what I mentioned above I sincerely enjoyed this movie!  A lot of people compare ""North & South"" to BBC's ""Pride & Prejudice"" but in P&P the main characters have both pride and prejudices, while in N&S, the line is more clearly drawn.  For, Hale has her own ideas and prejudices against ""the north,"" while Thornton has his own pride to deal with concerning his continuing attraction to Hale (just as an aside: Daniela Denby-Ashe was made for this part, she isn't what one might immediately declare as 'pretty', but there is something about her that is very sweet and endearing). Yet it all ends very sweetly after the four hours are up and I will definitely be adding this movie to my own video collection alongside ""Sense & Sensibility"", ""Persuasion"", ""Pride & Prejudice"", ""Emma"", and ""Wives & Daughters"".",1186012800,10,2589,4.837471783295711
2222991,5,B0007N1BBC,"Set in a gritty north England industrial town this excellent four-hour BBC mini-series adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's 1854 novel is nonetheless an outstanding period romance.

Margaret Hale, the protagonist, is forced to move with her parents from an idyllic country parsonage of Helstone to the gritty industrial town of Milton after her father leaves the ministry. There Margaret meets one of the leading men of the city, the mill owner Mr. Thornton.  This first meeting shows the hot tempered side of Thornton and sets up a Pride and Prejudice style misunderstanding.  It is good to remember that this is not a miniseries about the Victorian era; it is a largely faithful adaptation of a Victorian novel.  Elizabeth Gaskell was Victorian and she was writing about Victorians.  These people were more reserved, at least in public, than we are today.

Northern-born Gaskell must have been wicked smart, as she worked for Charles Dickens and was the first to rework Pride & Prejudice! Gaskell cleverly reverses Darcy and Elizabeth's characters, Mrs. Thornton acts as Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Thornton's sister Fanny substitutes for all the Bennett sisters, and the industrialized north is as desirable or even more so than Ms. Austen's beloved pastoral southern England.

Her protagonist is Margaret Hale (Danilea  Denby-Ashe) an educated, refined, virtuous young woman from the ""unmercantiled"" South who is thrust into the ugliness and conflicts of Milton, an fictionalized industrialized Northern city (meant to be Manchester). Our heroine is transformed by her life in a Northern town, both as an individual and as a woman.  The backstory of the Industrial Age, English textile mills, speculative ventures, unions and labor/management relations illuminates that era very well.

The four-disc series displays all the BBC hallmarks: uniformly good cast, thoughtful locations, authentic costumes and great set design. However, the cinematography has a more modern feel than many of the period dramas. The authentic mill interior with the white cotton floating through the air is stunning, especially with our dark haired hero striding through it like a Northern snow storm.

Richard Armitage is mesmerizing as John Thornton, with his lethal combination of piercing blue eyes, soft voice and explosive temperament. RA can convey more in a glance than most actors can in a fifteen minute exposition and his subtle use of his hands and mouth subtly convey inner emotions in this break-out role. Supporting cast members Tim Pigott-Smith (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Jewel-in-the-Crown/dp/B000053VA4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Jewel in the Crown</a>) and Sinead Cusack (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eastern-Promises-Blu-ray/dp/B001EIOOWC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eastern Promises [Blu-ray</a>]) are right up there with him every step of the way. The scenes between Armitage and Cusack are just amazing as they possess a familial resemble in coloring and the tenderness and pride between mother and son is palpable and deeply affecting.

N&S relies on the same general plot as Pride & Prejudice so in the second half of story-Margaret spurns Thornton's marriage proposal but then is compelled by his moral character/actions to reconsider. Thornton always acts honorably but has a quick temper and an inferiority complex. When he is brought low by circumstances beyond his control, he reacts by becoming more humane and compassionate which works to his advantage on many levels. This is a keeper, just go ahead and buy it and place it on the shelf next to BBC Pride and Prejudice so you can watch it at any time.",1184544000,2,3455,6.3382978723404255

Mr. Thornton and Margaret tell a tale of a man and woman who come from two literally different worlds.  Their lives collide and you can tell from the moment they see each other that there is a definite attraction.

I think the best part is watching the love unfold - not through sex or innuendo but rather through gentle touching of the hands and looks in their eyes and on their faces.

You fall in love with the characters immediately and become part of their world - you laugh with them and cry with them and you love them.

This is a movie for any woman who has romance in her heart and a man in her life she knows belongs to her.  Because that is exactly what North and South epitomizes.",1182816000,7,965,4.195652173913044

2223004,5,B0007N1BBC,"My sister and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  The acting is top-notch and the adaptation is generally faithful to the book.  However, given that I knew that Gaskell was a Unitarian and an early feminist, I knew that one of the early scenes could not have been in the book; Gaskell would never have had her heroine become romantically attached to a man who could behave in that way. Sure enough, when I read the book, I discovered that I was right. This scene is not in the book and the eventual outcome makes much more sense without it. This is the major divergence from the text.  The others are minor and don't affect the plausibility of the plot. If you want to know what the false scene is, scroll to the end of the review.

Partly due to Margaret's influence, Mr. Thornton evolves from an employer who resents the workers' demands and can't see their point of view to an employer who begins to try to understand and help them.  This is not to say that he does a 180.  Rather, he comes to have some empathy for them. For her part, Margaret starts out as a crusader, but when the workers' strike turns ugly, she too starts to see that the moral issues are more complex than she had thought.  In a sense, the two challenge each other to take on an enlarged moral perspective. Both Margaret and Mr. Thornton are also changed by having to face serious obstacles. As the story progresses, their growing attraction (first his, then hers) becomes evident.  Mr. Thornton, as played by Armitage, is compelling.  Margaret is beautifully portrayed by Denby-Ashe.  The actors who play Margaret's parents and Mr. Thornton's mother do an excellent job. All in all, this is a very satisfying movie.

(SPOILER ALERT:  Here's the false scene.  Margaret sees Mr. Thornton beating one of his workers.  In the book, Mr. Thornton never physically attacks or even threatens to attack his employees. I just remembered another false note - in the book, one does not get the sense that Margaret's father's college chum is romantically interested in her. In the movie, there's an implication that he might be so interested.)",1182297600,7,2104,4.666666666666667

I don't regularly writte reviews, but after seeing such a wonderful movie I had to do it.

2223019,5,B0007N1BBC,"It was a fortunate thing indeed when my professor for Intro to British Lit ordered North and South to be bundled with the 3 pack Norton Anthology I was suppose to have. I bought my books before my spring break and thought it would be nice and relaxing to read a good book after my finals. I started the first chapter but because I was on break with my cousin, there were other things I needed to do and didn't have the time or the pleasure to leisurely read North and South at my own pace. So I did a little searching because I vaguely remember that there must be a BBC adaption for it. I was right. I went to Le Video straight away to rent it.

As I popped in the DVD in my laptop, wonderful music began playing (I'm the type who likes background orchestrated music). Then the wonderful story began to unfold and I fell in love with the characters...especially Mr. Thornton and the actor Richard Armitage, hahahaha *blush*. Anyway, the real factory scene was amazing, the cotton looked like snow (but it's hazardous to breathe it in), and the cramped living spaces in Milton was actually a refresher for me after seeing so many other scenes of country houses in other BBC productions. Now that I am back in school and reading North and South, I find the book equally interesting because Gaskell describes the characters in great detail which I can't really see on the screen.

In my opinion, I think North and South (which portrays the industrial society) is much better than Pride and Prejudice (which has more fluff and decadence). So if ever one is in a British Drama mood, one must see North and South which has become my all time favorite BBC mini series EVER!!",1177545600,10,1667,4.462295081967213
2223020,5,B0007N1BBC,"There are so many things I could rant and rave about, but I should probably just choose a few because otherwise I'd be here all day. First, the acting/choice of actors. Let's start with the most noteable (and most fun to talk about :)). Richard Armitage as John Thornton is now one of my favorite 19th century heroes. I love his raw emotion! His acting has such a genuine quality to it. Daniela Denby-Ashe is a wonderful Magaret Hale. I can't put my finger on what, exactly, is so good about her performance, it just fits. I like that both of these actors are good looking, but not so attractive that it makes the rest of us feel intimidated. It's their personalities that draw me in, not their looks. Although their appearances do help... especially in the case of Mr. Armitage, whom I can't help noticing is incredibly fine, me being a mortal female.
Also I have to mention Fanny Thornton. I don't know the name of the actress who plays her, but she did a fantastic job. She cracks me up. And (forgive me if I misspell it) Sinead Cusack, who plays Fanny and John's mother, did a very noticeably good job.
The story of course is wonderful. I love the plot turns! And the score is perfect. The music is almost haunting; it fits the story quite well. For those of you have read the novel by Elizabeth Gaskell, this adaption stays fairly close to it. There are a few liberties taken but all in all it's a very accurate adaption, much of it word-for-word with what happens in the book.
I could go on for days, but that most likely would not be received well by anyone reading this. So, I will finish by saying that this is an AMAZING film,  it's one of my very favorites! I highly recommend it.",1177459200,14,1691,4.385350318471337
2223021,5,B0007N1BBC,"Top Twelve Reasons ""North and South"" is a ten:

PRODUCTION VALUES: Historic looms weave again. Lemon-yellow sunlight floods a garden's translucent petals and leaves. Made me cry. Gave me chills.

MARTIN PHIPPS' HYPNOTIC SCORE: reminiscent of Gorecki; minimalism that drills past the kapital-K-krap of the last hundred years of pop culture and reaches something as fundamental as the beat of a human heart, the lungs' breath. Honors both one of the most wrenchingly intimate onscreen moments ever and yet also the sweep of the Industrial Revolution.

SINEAD CUSACK: breathtaking as a ruthless matriarch; better, even than Nancy Marchand as a Mafia queen in ""The Sopranos.""

POSTURE: Never has so much drama been milked out of actors' vertebrae. Helen Hayes' czarina pose in ""Anastasia"" was good, but Sinead Cusack's carriage and Richard Armitage's spinal column earn special Academy Awards.

PLOT TWISTS: I did not know where this one was going until the very last moment of the very last scene. Twists pulled me into the issues the plot engages, and made me engage them myself.

IT'S COMPLICATED: Leftist academics' pinko-tinged glasses depict the workers as beautiful and bosses as diabolical. But tycoon Andrew Carnegie, who brutalized his workers, was an epic philanthropist; workers scabbed, drank, and beat their kids. N&S depicts historical complications with its heroic/brutal workers/bosses. All characters are sometimes sympathetic, and sometimes utterly alienating -  just like real life! A complex script works to earn our understanding, and our love, for complex human beings, the service, art, at its best, performs.

CHICK FLICK: ""Fight, flight, or fix it"" is a male response. Guy flix: explosions, chases, gadgets. ""Tend and befriend"" is a female response. We restore the world by ministering to its root: human hearts. N&S presents its heroine and its viewer with misunderstandings she must address; doing so, she matures, and we mature with her. Margaret's blossoming is an integral cog in a shock striking the world even today: the journey from tradition and pastoral beauty to sharp-elbow competition and industrial ugliness. Margaret's flailing culture shock and attempts to find, remain, and cultivate her best self under a rulebook she hasn't yet seen mirrors millions' struggle. Daniela Denby-Ashe limn's Margaret's triumph with honesty and grace. She's not afraid to be unlikeable; she's not even afraid to be noble.

MISOGYNY-FREE ZONE: We are so awash in misogyny, often fed by women themselves -  who can forget the blow struck for women's dignity by celebrities who go out without their underthings? -  that N&S is almost shocking in the respect it shows women. Margaret Hale has a front-row seat to one of the greatest upheavals in human history: industrialization. She takes on its rewards and woes. She makes decisions, engages with the powerful, grows and changes. And she does all this without once trivializing herself, or allowing anyone else to trivialize her. *And* she's accompanied by interesting women and girls, both rich and poor. That, alone, makes N&S worth more than a hundred critical darlings in which misogyny is an inescapable ingredient.

MORALITY. CHRISTIANITY. HOPE. REMEMBER THOSE? Gaskell's book and this adaptation take on really hard challenges: workers v. capitalists, traditional rural life's poverty and its beauty v. laissez-faire capitalism's new opportunities, ugliness and anomie. N&S could have just exploited the Industrial Revolution as colorful backdrop; it didn't. N&S attempts to offer solutions and hope, based on fundamental Christian values like non-violence and sharing. Gee, what if the folks who had made the nihilistic downer film ""Syriana,"" about our dependence on petroleum, had tried something similar? When the N&S boss and his workers sat down to a meal together, I cried cynicism-free tears. But . . . what WERE they eating? It looked like sludge. The redemption in the movie's key kiss is not just about eros, it's also about agape. And that made me cry. (Cried many times.)

BRENDAN COYLE AS NICHOLAS HIGGINS: Let's import Higgins, making sure he keeps that snazzy, puffy-sleeved shirt that displays his chest hair. He'd be a greater boost to the trade union movement than locating Jimmy Hoffa.

NOT A SINGLE WASTED CHARACTER, PERFORMANCE, OR SCENE: A bereaved husband converses with his late wife, as a maid looks on, her facial expression speaking volumes. A desperate man gazes at running water dyed purple. The most amazing scene of all, every bit as stunning as the famous crane shot in GWTW: a woman, her straw hat and bumpkin gait rendering her an agrarian silhouette in an industrial landscape, drawn by a seductive, menacing, thrum, walks up to a large wooden door, pulls it back, and steps into the Industrial Revolution. ""I have seen hell, and it is white, snow white."" Mebbe so. But that scene is cinematic heaven-on-earth.

RICHARD ARMITAGE: I don't even want to go there. Let's just say that I've just purchased the latest ticket to his crowded harem of adoring fans, and this: even if I had watched N&S with the sound turned off; Armitage's performance was so exquisitely articulate I could have transcribed pages of dialogue and backstory just from studying his face. But if I watched with the sound turned off, I would have missed the most arresting screen voice since Orson Welles, and the dreamiest since Ronald Coleman . . . Ladies, cave.

2223022,4,B0007N1BBC,"North and South co-mingle the beauty, elegance and virtue of one part of England's past, with the cruel reality of it's industrial other side. On the one hand you have the godly, chaste and beautiful Miss Margaret Hale, and on the other, the beast, in the person of John Thornton. I love the display of reality that was present during the cruel days of Englands inner city life, with the hardships of life in it's poverty stricken areas. But I also relished in the beauty, the scenery and manners of the middle and upper classes, where civility reigned. The only reason I couldn't give this excellent film a 5 star rating was because it was a little long, it was a little too focused on the harshness of the Mill and their workers. The love story and juicy parts came towards the middle and end of the film, where you know the beauty and the beast just had to break their respective independent hard shells, and start falling for each other. I also liked the fact that the Parson of the story was not presented in a negative light, but just as another bloke that was struggling to make ends meet. The female character of North and South Miss Margaret Hale, occasionally showed the cracks of her humanity but overall, she was articulate, beautiful, chaste, and very lady like. The character of John Thornton was steely, hard, and at times mean. But once you get to the point of discovering why he was that way, and what he had to go through to pick himself up by his bootstraps, your opinion of him will gradually change. But throughout the whole film, you want these two to get together, but only when the conditions are right.

The credit goes to Miss Gaskell, of course, but Richard Armitage and Daniela Denby-Ashe do a fantastic job interpreting their characters.  I was enthralled from start to finish and cared as much for the peripheral characters as the leads.  It's not better than Pride and Prejudice - it's equal to it, at least production-wise.

2223025,5,B0007N1BBC,"Another review by PD's Daughter :

The reason I bought this DVD is because I heard all about how wonderful it was and how it was deemed ""the best BBC production ever."" Well I have to agree!! (actually I really love most of the BBC productions)

After I watched this 233 minute program all in one sitting way past by bedtime (I just had to know what happened!!) I couldn't resist reading the novel by Elizabeth Gaskell (which is a really good book, it's now one of my favorites)... the movie is kinda like the book, although the production is (i confess) much better because of the modernization for us younger female watchers.

The story begins with Margaret Hale (Daniela Denby-Ashe) at her cousin's wedding in London where she is talking to a young man (who would later propose to her but she would refuse) about how wonderful her country life is where her father is parson and her mother is a sweet yet delicate woman.

Mr. Hale moves the entire family (including the maid Dixon) up North to the mill town of Milton (for a reason I won't tell!!!) and they are set up in a little house.

Country girl Margaret absolutely hates the dirt and noise and the utter gruffness of the millworkers in Milton and the town itself.  But there is nothing Margaret hates more than the handsome, intellegent, lovely, mean, handsome mill owner John Thornton.

Being an obsessed P&P watcher and reader, Mr. Thornton really reminded me of Mr. Darcy (accept much meaner) and well Richard Armitage is such a great actor and such a good looking man that I was very happy with the choice of him for Mr. Thornton.

The choice of Margaret was a dissapointment.  In the book Margaret is suppose to be a strikingly beautiful young woman but I felt that Daniela Denby-Ashe was a little bit too Eastern European looking and tough.  I knew that she was making her voice sound very ... delicate... but I just felt that Margaret was not presented in the way that she should have -- strong willed, intelligent, and beautiful buuuut I did get over that by the end, the wonderfully romantic ending.

In the romance department (which I'm quite aware of since I did a huge project on romance novels and I'm in love, literally in love, with Barbara Cartland) there were parts that just made me ... sigh.

I especially loved how the writers of the script put in the ""looking over the shoulder at Mr. Thornton"" and added that part in the swirling snow where Mr. Thornton squints his eyes and hoarsly whispers ""look back..look back at me"" ... sigh

but the end... what can I say.. my heart flutters just thinking about it.  I won't tell you'll just have to watch it.

The plot of the movie has a lot of twists and turns, and I feel is quite accurate to the time period of mills and unions, where the worker had no right and could only hope that their demands would be met through striking.  For some reason though, Mr. Thornton and Margaret are always in the right places and the right time to see the wrong things about each other.

The entire story is a relationship built upon misunderstanding and confusion and about the supression of truly passionate feelings.  North and South is such a good movie and novel. I would HIGHLY recommend watching this incredible BBC production!",1175990400,7,3242,4.569948186528498
2223026,5,B0007N1BBC,"Have watched P and P (Firth/Ehle) probably 10 times, thought it was the best ever.  Bought this because of other reviews mentioning it.  Criticism of Austen for lack of social conscience is clearly reflective of time of writing; this- written a generation later, like most enduring writers of that time (Hugo, Dickens, et al) was loaded with intelligent social comment.  Interesting to observe that at the same time the US was having North/South division, so was the UK (less bloody, thankfully).  The lines were somewhat different and may explain subsequent cultural variances.  In the UK the north was industrial but lower in the class system, not the educated elite; in the US, the north was industrial but was the intellectual and social ""upper class"".  Roots of value differences between US and UK are here,  That closing scene of North and South is the most wildly romantic I have ever seen.

The very first hour of the series had me alittle skeptical and semi-hooked, but then it got really intriguing and I thoroughly enjoyed the whole series!  The tension between the two main characters reminded me so much of Pride & Prejudice ... I just loved it.  If you're a fan of either of those aforementioned series, you will love this one too ... maybe not as much, but it's well worth your time to watch & find out!",1175817600,2,706,4.246268656716418

Circumstances make the family move up north, where she meets a cotton mill owner who was formerly rather poor. The perennial struggle between the haves and have-nots brings this couple into an interesting ideological battle that results in great love.  There is intrigue, passion, pain, but in the end... love conquers all. Again...  BBC provides another EPIC mini-series, which we sincerely hope you acquire, especially if you have teenagers at home.

There is much prejudice at play in the world they inhabit... the bucolic south verse the hardscrabble north, the old impoverished wealth verses the new industrial rich, the union workers verses the factory owners, but most especially bad first impressions verse growing respect.

2223032,5,B0007N1BBC,"I viewed the recent BBC production of Jane Eyre. Then I heard about another well reviewed series North and South. I read Elizabeth Gaskell's noveland purchased and viewed the DVD of the 2004 BBC production. It's a wonderful story of love, reminiscent of Darcy and Elizabeth from Austen's Pride and Prejudice, in a backdrop of the changes being wrought by the Industrial Revolution. The BBC production stays mostly faithful to the overall themes of the novel, although it does take a major leap of dramatic license at the end. What makes this work so interesting is instead of the closed world of landed gentry portrayed in Jane Austen's work or the gothic psychological inwardness of Charlotte Bronte, Gaskell through her characters (especially the interaction between the Hales and Thorntons) explores how the Industrial Revolution was overturning the last remnants of the old feudal/aristocratic order -- to be replaced by commerce and money. At first, Mrs. Hale and Miss Margaret Hale look down on the mill-owning Thorntons because they are engaged in trade, while Mr. Hale is an educated ex-clergyman of the Church of England. The females in the Thornton family look down on the Hales because they are relatively poor while they have achieved great financial success in textile manufacturing. The BBC series reinforces this societal tension when Mr. Thornton meets some relations of Margaret's -- who live in London -- at the Great Exhibition (no such scene took place in the novel), and one of them in a condescending tone mentions his brother wants to ""dabble"" in the cotton trade; Mr. Thornton as his usual brooding self responds, to paraphrase, that 'he does not dabble.' Also, as a Yank I was captivated by the different accents of the southern Hales versus the northern Thorntons. On top of this conflict between the old and new elite, labor strife is personified by union leader Nicholas Higgins, who organizes a strike against the cotton mills -- including Mr. Thornton's, with the hope of improving the lives of downtrodden mill workers.

The production value of this mini-series is tremendous. In scenes in the Hales' old residence of Helstone one sees an idyllic rural setting where the sun always shines. In contrast, in the industrial city of Milton (Manchester) it's always gray, and I do not remember ever seeing the sun come out. The scene where Miss. Hale meets Mr. Thornton for the first time is spectacular, another departure from the novel, as she is shocked to see the workings of a cotton mill as particulates of cotton float around her as if it is snowing. The overall feel of the mini-series is rather grim, appropriate for an industrial setting, with sorrowful music dominating the score.

There are many great acting performances. Among them is Richard Armitage as John Thornton. He fits Gaskell's portrayal of the self-made man who underneath his proud, brooding exterior has inner self-doubt about his worth because he is not a gentleman based on Margaret's standards. His mother Hannah Hale played by Sinead Cusack steals the scenes she's in. One can call her the original Iron Lady but underneath a hard as nails exterior is a mother devoted and proud of what her son has achieved. One sees a beautiful portrayal of a mother's love for her son when she consoles him over Miss. Hale's rejection of his proposal of marriage. Of course, immediately after that she growls her indignant hate of Miss. Hale for rejecting her son. Brendan Coyle is excellent as the union leader Nicholas Higgins who tries to get what he feels are fair wages for his workers. Despite being on opposites side of, to use Marxian terminology, the bourgeoisie/proletariat divide he and Mr. Thornton discover they are more alike than they are at first willing to admit. Finally, Tim Pigott-Smith plays the quiet, dignified Mr. Hale who is burdened by what he has done to his family in leaving the Church of England over a matter of conscience.

Besides these factors what really stands out is how the series presents both sides of the conflict between workers and capitalists. In one scene, we see the workers under Higgins' leadership discuss how their wages were cut five years ago, and how they want their old wages restored just to keep up with the increasing prices of food and other necessities -- while in another scene Mr. Thornton and his mother discuss their problems in competing against the flood of textile imports from America. Viewing this series was a nice antedote to having to watch that horrid Norma Rae in college.

Finally, in an era in which businessmen are portrayed as evil in most Hollywood movies, this series presents a compelling protagonist in Mr. Thornton the capitalist. We really see his mind at work when his hosts a supper with the other mill owners and invites Mr. Hale to join them. (I find myself wishing to be in the company of these men who look like they are having a good time drinking, smoking and talking business than in some stuffy drawing room discussing polite topics.)  They are discussing whether to install fans at the mills to lessen the ""fluff"" in the air. Mr. Hale argues it's a Christian thing to do. But Mr. Thornton who has installed the fans argues morality has no role to play. He installed the fans because it keeps the workers healthy and more productive, justifying the investment in the fans. One can see the torch passing from the spiritual world to one of impersonal economic calculation. I must admit my blood was roused by Mr. Thornton's clear economic rationale and how the power of market forces in this case benefits both workers and owners. I have not seen a more positive portrayal of a businessman in quite some time. Yes, he does soften around the edges as the story progresses but he does not renounce who he is.",1170806400,40,5790,4.8681541582150105
2223033,5,B0007N1BBC,"I borrowed this DVD set at the insistence from a friend, and I'm so glad that I did. It was hard to find 4 hours time to finish the whole thing, but after the first hour, it was a necessity to finish it! I haven't watched much from BBC, but I do plan to watch more now. The movie was beautifully made, with the camera work and the costume and set design. There's so much of the upper class portrayed in most period films, but they went into great detail to show the lower working class in its reality. The two main characters were the obvious stars, though I think Daniela Denby-Ashe lacked in showing emotions as an actress, while Richard Armitage blew me away with his passion and grit. While each of the side characters were also masterful actors and mostly endearing, (aside from Mrs. Thornton) I instantly fell in love with Mr. Bell, Mr. Higgins and Fanny Thornton.

I was so impressed with this mini-series. I had never heard of Elizabeth Gaskell before, but I look forward to reading her novel now. The plot was so intricate and detailed yet carefully written, and the characters were so loveable and realistic to the time. When the movie first opened, I didn't like Margaret or Mr. Thornton; she was too snooty and he was too crass. But as the story wore on and the characters grew and developed, I found affection for both of them, though especially for Mr. Thornton. He is the epitome of the tall, dark and handsome man, brooding and emotionless; a heavy heart waiting for a beautiful young woman to step into his life and fill it with love and happiness.

After months of trials and tribulation, of miscommunication and pure angst, the end is tied up beautifully. I'm such a sucker for romances, and this movie did not disappoint. An uptight and broody Mr. Thornton is now lax and smiling as he meets Margaret again, and she is no longer the stubborn and sheltered young woman from before. She is now wise and affectionate, and offers a ""business deal"" to Mr. Thornton to get what she wants - what they both want. I couldn't picture a happier ending, and I was very pleased to be so delightedly treated after my four-hour endeavor.

I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in history, or to any of the hopeless romantics like myself. I only wish that more people knew about this beautiful piece of work. It was different from any ""movie"" I had ever seen, but it was a refreshing change. It's worth the money to buy and keep, and worth the four hours time it takes to watch.",1170028800,25,2508,4.495614035087719

2223046,4,B0007N1BBC,"First of all, forgive my mistakes, English is a foreign language for me.

I can recommend this item for people who enjoy other adaptations of English 19th century literature. It serves it's purpose of transporting us to another time through very succesful casting and direction as well as really good production values. It is a love story with a heavy socio-political background, very interesting in itself, if one has not been over-exposed to that part of English history before. It is a pleasure to watch.

Now, to the flaws. The character of John Thornton, the male lead, supposedly improves on better aquaintance, probably a notion from ""Pride and Prejudice."" But in reality the movie is playing a trick on us. Thornton is behaving badly and is saying horrible things at the beginning, and there is really no reason for the female lead, Margaret Hale, or us, the viewers to have a good opinion of him. As the story progresses he starts saying noble things which supposedly motivate his behavieur. So the whole ""Pride and Prejudice"" thing does not apply really, because the character of Thornton at the begging and at he end of the movie is that of two different people. Since we were not shown his growth, there is nothing to account for that change and just makes no sense. Margaret has to overcome her prejudices towards the North, of which there are plenty, and this is beautifully shown in the movie. But why make her overcome a ""prejudice"" which is actually sound judgement? Were the authors afraid to show her in too negative a light at the beginning?

As well, the whole conflict between masters and workers and the suggested resolution are presented in such a childish way, as to have been surely written by someone very well meaning, but possessing a limited understanding of human nature. I recommend the excellent satire from my own country, ""The Promised Land"", written by a Nobel Price winner Wladyslaw Reymont and directed by the Academy Award recipient director Andrzej Wajda, in which the rich and the poor are, more truly to the era, at each other's throats. I know that Poland and England were at different stages of industrialization in the 19th century, but I still recommend you to see Wajda's movie for comparison, and also to show you what is probably missing from ""North and South.""",1167782400,3,2310,4.828282828282828
2223047,5,B0007N1BBC,"Others have given the plot synopsis, so I won't do it here.  I think the best thing about this movie (aside from the amazing cast) is that it shows a side of 19th-century British life we don't usually see, particularly not from Jane Austen, George Eliot, etc.  I really liked that we were able to see both the upper, middle and lower classes interact in ""North & South"".  It is set in mid-19th century industrial England, and the main setting is a dirty city (contrasted, of course, to Margaret's beautiful country home from whence she comes) that is a main center for the cotton industry.  We see what these workers lives were like, the horrible conditions they worked in.  (It might just make you appreciate your own boss a little more--at least they can't legally beat you up!)  While Thornton's certainly not as noble as Darcy, I got over my initial dislike of him quickly, and by the time he is staring out the window whispering ""Look back.  Look back at me."", you really can't help but like him.  I think one of the best characters was Mrs. Thornton.  She played the matriarch of her son's empire perfectly--and yet, the motherly side of her shows through just as perfectly.  The music is beautiful, too.  For those concerned with content, there is a scene where one man beats another (some blood is shown) and there is mild swearing.

A little more on the drama side than the lighter Pride and Prejudice, but the two main characters are no less interesting.

Noisy, smoky, full of the images of stark poverty and despair and yet tipped rightside up by those who fought their way through it and found success.

Don't expect the same idealised views of England though,this is a far grittier and realistic period drama which captures the cold of the North of England beautifully.  My only critercism is that the final scene would never have happened in the 19th century and certainly does not happen in the book.

2223063,5,B0007N1BBC,"I bought this recently from Amazon and was enraptured by the high production values and superb translation from the book. The excellent dialogue and sequences from the novel are captured in many places through the series, but there are some notable departures from the novel that transport it brilliantly.

The writers heighten the romance by creating more angst for both Thornton and Miss Hale with the creation of Miss Lattimer and an expansion of Mr. Bell's role. Mr. Bell, who was mischievious in the book, is here a bemused meddler who has keenly surmised the attraction between Thornton and Margaret.

The greatest departure from the novel is also what elevates this series for me above the classic Pride & Prejudice with Colin Firth. The romance in the novel wraps up very suddenly, too suddenly to do justice to the torturous romance between Thornton and Margaret. In the series, however, the culmination of all that has passed is poignant, breathtaking, and ultimately fulfilling.

By far the best thing about this series is the subtle and nuanced performance of Richard Armitage. He is able to evoke such restrained intensity and passion and give Thornton the emotional stature to equal his physical stature. He is a superb actor and I am very much looking forward to seeing him in BBC's new production of Robin Hood as Guy of Gisborne.

  Since the show runs 4 hours and is rather dark much of the time, it wouldn't make fun viewing on a rainy day.  Nevertheless, if you have the time and energy, this miniseries will reward you with a memorable experience.

  With the problems we have today a lot of people get depressed and angry.  Still, once you see a show like this you can be glad you didn't have the problems they had back in the 1850's when this story took place.  Grim working conditions, worse living conditions, disease, intolerance, and more.  There was no ""safety net"" for anyone.

  Despite all their problems, the characters in this drama show the type of courage and resiliency that give one hope for the future.  Amid the gloom and strain of everyday existence, the characters look for wisdom and understanding, and of course, love.  There are some similarities with the themes in ""Pride and Prejudice,"" as others have said.  But there's little of the sardonic humor you'll find in a Jane Austen piece.  This production shows mostly hard scrabble poverty and tough manual labor, but the happy ending makes it all worthwhile.  If anyone wondered where unions came from, to fight for decent wages and working conditions, look no further.

  Because dialogue can be hard to follow in places, viewers might want to switch on Subtitles.  Northern British accents are not what most of us are used to and their idioms and words can be difficult to follow.

2223066,5,B0007N1BBC,"Richard Armitage, who plays the enigmatic mill owner John Thornton, gives fellow Brit Colin Firth a run for his money in terms of great acting and yes, the hottness factor. Speaking of Colin Firth associations, the proposal scene is reminiscent of Darcy and Elizabeth in terms of misunderstandings and unjust, preconceived opinons.  It seems that from the moment of her refusal, Margaret is thereafter interested in and (subconsciously) attracted to this self-made man.

  I thought the relationship between John and his mother particularly beautiful.  Yes, Mrs. Thorton had a harsh opinion of Margaret Hale, but that was mostly out of her desire to protect her son from Margaret's romantic rejection.  Mrs. Thorton said that a mother's love will outlast every other type of love, and she believed in her son and knew he'd take care of her even after his prospects had changed.  (Fortunately, Margaret's (contrived) business proposal would get the mill up and running again.)

  This movie (based on Elizabeth Gaskell's novel) allowed for all points of view--we saw too close for comfort the plight of the mill workers who'd soon strike: some of them lived in constant fear of starvation, while others contracted consumption because of unhealthy working conditions and died well before their time.  We also see child labor and how it was normalized at this point in time.  Yet John Thorton, our romantic hero and the proprietor of one of the three or four cotton mills in Milton, is not without compassion or principles.  However, the interests and perspectives of the mill owners and workers were at cross-purposes. Mr. Thorton and the other mill owners discussed concerns about the impending strike, whether they should seek cheaper suppliers outside of England, and whether they should recruit Irish workers to fill in for the strikers.  Margaret's dad, a displaced parson (he had qualms about the mandatory role of the Book of Common Prayer in the Anglican Church) offered spiritual advice to the mill owners, but I don't think his well-intentioned interjections were much heeded. However, he observed that when he heard reasoned arguments from both sides of the dilemna, he could understand both points of view, and therefore, he recommended that both parties (mill owners and striking workers) have open dialogues.

  Mr. Thorton became Rev. Hale's pupil, and the two of them tackled Plato and other monumental works.  Mr. Thorton's education was interrupted when he was forced to leave school at 16 and take care of his mother and younger sister while repaying his deceased father's debts from speculation.

  The role of Fanny, John's younger sister, seemed one-dimensional and stereotypical.  She seemed to have forgotten that she and her family were impoverished not too long ago b/f her brother's Horatio Alger rags-to-riches turnaround. The mother was far more connected to the family's source of income and purposely lived close to her son's mill and even supervised some of the workers.  She was beaming with pride over her son's accomplishments, yet she forgot how to see from the layman's perspective.

  Elizabeth Gaskell wrote with a great social conscience. Yet she also wrote with a great romantic imagination. That two people who seem so different would come to fall in love and be willing to revise their faulty perceptions and grow and change is sight for sore eyes.  My favorite scene from this movie is the last scene at the train station where John and Margaret ""publicly display their affections"" (a bit risque for the Victorian era) after Margaret nervously proposed her ""business plan"" to save the mill. I don't think John's thoughts could have been further from the mill as he kissed and embraced Margaret. (I confess to having been more than a little jealous of Daniela Denby-Ashe during this scene! :-)

The music was ""specially composed by Martin Phipps,"" yet I think I recognize some of Mahler's symphonic music in the movie.  As a Mahler fan, the music makes the movie even more beautiful.",1159142400,41,4024,5.091463414634147

This is going to be a classic, just like them!  I watched the last chapter about 15 times, ready to swoon and clutching my bosom!  You will not be disappointed if you like P&P, and movies like it.  I can find no fault in any of it--everyone was superb--even the actress that played Fanny--she did it perfectly!  But of course Mr. Thornton, and Margaret were the classic stars and oh, is he Hugh Jackman's younger brother or what?

2223073,5,B0007N1BBC,"This BBC film is a pure jewel! Like some of the reviewers on Amazon, I didn't see the film on TV because French TV seldom broadcast British films like Pride and Prejudice and North&South. But luckily for me, I have a strong liking for everything that is English (cinema, literature, theatre and music) and I am always deeply interested in what British TV can produce. I've seen the BBC Pride and Prejudice many times (I've also read the book) I like it -even though my preference goes to the new 2005 movie (sorry, can't help it)- and I am even familiar with Elizabeth Gaskell's work (I've read Mary Barton and I've started reading North&South). So, on reading the positive reviews on Amazon and on the BBC website, I decided to buy it, although I knew little about the whole story. My God, I never imagined that this BBC film could be so good! I can't even describe how I felt when I first watched the first episode except that I became completely hooked and I couldn't stop watching until I knew how it ended. And what an end!!! Now I can only say that it has even eclipsed the BBC P&P film in my heart. Everything is perfect, the cast and the acting, the setting, the photography, the dialogues, the music, the social background. The background definitely adds another interesting layer to the film because you can see both sides, the mill owners' and the workers' and you can see them at their work. All the characters are marvellous and so likeable. They really make a difference because they have a lot of depth and there is always a certain dignity about them.
  We can thank Elizabeth Gaskell for creating such wonderful characters, yet they wouldn't make such an impression in the film if the actors weren't so great. They really got into their parts. Sinead Cusack is a magnificent Mrs Thornton, this iron lady who does her best to control her emotions but then you look through her eyes and realize that she is not as cold or hard as she seems, especially when you take full measure of the depth of her love for her son. What a fantastic mother she is! And what about Brandon Coyle/ Higgins, I mean, I've just talked about the dignity of the characters, here is a fine example, you just have to look at the face of this union leader to know that he is at heart a good man, even though he is a bit ruthless sometimes. Jo Joyner as John's sister is a delight, probably the only source of comic relief in the story. But the whole cast is great! And of course, the film wouldn't be so captivating if there wasn't Daniela Denby-Ashe and Richard Armitage in the parts of Margaret and Mr Thornton. Mr Thornton, oh, God, What a man! I fell in love with this fascinating character. Of course, Richard Armitage is already so charismatic that you can't take your eyes off him. But the man is so dedicated to his work, -contrary to Darcy, he has known poverty and he has had to fight back-that you feel an admiration for him! Out of nothing but using his wits, he has been able to run a fine business and when we first meet him, he is a well-off and powerful mill owner. His position in society makes him arrogant and brutal, yet, he remains fair with his workers and, thanks to Margaret, he becomes more aware of the living conditions of the working class and even becomes a caring master. He has such a strength or resilience; yet, at the same time, his love for Margaret makes him vulnerable. Oh, the way he looks at her! (sigh)
It is incredible what the two actors can produce on screen. In the proposal scene, the interaction between them is so intense. There is so much passion on their faces and in the way they respond to each other that it is breathtaking. I was really shaking inside. -I always feel a bit frustrated by the BBC P&P, although the actors are excellent, because the film sticks too much to the book. And I wish that we could see more touching of hands or more signs of passion between Firth and Ehle.- Thankfully here, the film, North &South, is not completely faithful to the book especially concerning the dialogues and so they have more impact in the film. The ending scene, in particular is so beautiful that it brings tears to my eyes. Is it due to R. Armitage's magnetism on screen or to the tenderness that is palpable between them when they talk or when they look at each other or to the way they touch each other's hands with the enchanting music behind? I can't tell. I don't think any words can really describe how I feel about this film so I will just stop there and let you enjoy the film for yourself. The DVD is also worth the money because it includes an interview with Armitage and commentaries.",1156636800,47,4635,4.438967136150235

You could imagine them married and their looking forward to growing old together.  Great acting, great directing, great writing, great photography all made the characters believable and bearable. I love movies that take romance and make it romantic--intellegent conversations between the ones who are in love with each other and the slow discovery of what they hold inside of themselves.

The voice of the mother was sometimes too quiet and it was difficult to understand her at times but, all in all, not enough to take away from the stories interest and enjoyment.

2223082,5,B0007N1BBC,"I first saw this movie in school during AP English.  Being 4 hours long, it took nearly two weeks to complete.  Despite being 4 hours, it is probably one of a very few romance movies that I am more than willing to see time and time again.  I am currently on my 5th viewing and everytime I watch it, there is something I catch that I missed earlier and which makes it that much better.  For English purposes, the movie is filled with conflict, special effects to evoke the emotions of a scene (my personal favorite being when she leaves for London with her Aunt), and several plots which vary in complication.  Several people below have already mentioned the main plot many times, but to truely see and understand this movie, you must pay attention to all the little details.  In general this movie is about the relationship struggle between Miss Hale and Mr. Thornton in the midst of the industrial period.  This takes pleace in the north part of England where Mr. Thornton runs a cotton mill and Miss Hale moves there from the south.  But there is so much more to the movie that I would not have noticed myself had I not been in school.  One key item being the letters that Miss Hale writes.  As the viewer sees Milton while one of the first letters are written, we hear a sharp contrast to what we see.  This is a terrific movie to watch but not one for those who don't wish to notice everything.",1152403200,11,1398,4.37984496124031
2223083,4,B0007N1BBC,"I came to this mini-series as a fan of the original book by Elizabeth Gaskell (which, by the way, if you haven't read, go and read now!) and of Gaskell's novels in general, as well as of other mini-series based on classic novels such as ""Pride and Prejudice.""  And overall I was very pleased.  As far as I can tell, not having read the book for a year or two, the makers of the movie made only minor changes, such as were necessary for the different format or the limited length.  Those who love the book need not hesitate to watch this mini-series for fear of huge alterations in the plot or characters.

The one exception, the one change that bothered me, was the ending, that is, the train-station scene.  Yes, it was very romantic, but it was also highly unrealistic, to the point that it distracted me from enjoying the romance.  (N.B.: This paragraph contains spoilers for the ending.  I have to vent my feelings...)  First of all, no one in the Victorian era would kiss in public, in the middle of a train station.  That would have been considered extremely improper.  I could have forgiven that, for the sake of romance, but then she goes home with him, and a woman living with the man she is going to marry before the wedding definitely would not have been done in that time-period.  Besides, wouldn't she need to go home to get her clothes?  Wouldn't she have the courtesy to tell her family where she was going?  I'm sorry, but I really think they could have made a good romantic ending without it being so completely outside the realm of possibility.

I would also like to point out that North and South the book is not solely, perhaps not even primarily, a romance.  It is in many ways a novel of ideas, meant to address the problem of industrial master/worker relationships.  The mini-series, however, focuses a little more on the romance aspect.  It also portrays Margaret's friendship with the Higginses as being on slightly more equal terms than in the book, which, although more pleasant to modern sensibilites, kind of downplays the very real problem of inequality which existed at that time.

To revert to praise, the acting was brilliant; I cannot think of a single actor whose performance was less than satisfactory, or which jarred with the rest of the movie.  The sets and costumes were likewise perfect, and I particularly enjoyed the beautiful score.  Regarding the DVD specifically, there weren't all that many special features, but those there were were interesting.

I deducted one star because of the unrealistic-ness of the ending, but otherwise ""North and South"" was excellent, and I recommend it to lovers of the book or of period drama.",1152316800,22,2670,4.698924731182796
2223084,5,B0007N1BBC,"As a devout reader of the classics, I am always skeptical when a movie based on a classic literary work comes out.  I worry they will take out pivotal pieces of story, ruin an important scene, or cast the wrong actors for the parts.  Thankfully, North and South does none of these things.  In fact, I found this movie to be delightful with a well written screenplay and an excellent cast, particularly Richard Armitage as Mr. Thorton.  From his well tied cravat to his deep brooding stare, he embodies Mr. Thorton perfectly.  I have even begun to think he might be more handsome than Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy, if that is possible.  I highly recommend this film to anyone.",1152057600,10,671,4.55

Of course during the industrial revolution, this was obviously the case in industrial nations around the world.  In this story the society, poverty and pain was so graciously understated yet vividly represented in the characters.  I would heartily recommend this to anyone who enjoys historical novels dramatized.  My only complaint was that BBC America chose to include lengthy advertisements of their TV channel on each disc, but thankfully the FF button remedied that after the first viewing.",1151971200,6,666,5.08256880733945
2223086,5,B0007N1BBC,"North and South, based on the novel by Elizabeth Gaskell, is Jane Austen, Charles Dickens and Upton Sinclair taking a walk through Milton.  In these days when we are questioning who has the right to work here and what is a living wage, this reports on the times and projects into the present. Have we really learned how to talk to each other to bridge gulfs of class and other differences? The story starts a little slow, but it warms up in the 2nd episode.

The love story starts that way, too. For all her talk of unionists and masters learning to speak to eachother instead of fight, Margaret is a fine one to talk. She can't even talk sincerely about what she wants. (Then again, if she did, there would not be a fabulous 4-hour BBC series.) Through most of it it, I wanted to shake Margaret and her parents, very believable passive aggressive characters played brilliantly. They are an interesting vehicle for exploring Milton and the North and the industrial cloth trade. I fell in love with Higgins, Thornton and Bell and the actors that played them.  Armitage plays Thornton with all the burden, authority, and search for joy - he enjoys his job when everything works.  (I think I have a thing for Yorkshire men.) He cuts a dashing figure, but, more, he strikes a strong realistically ethical cord. Sinead Cusack is so strong and plays Mrs. Thornton with so much complexity. She also, in spite of the harshness of the character, is beautiful - harsh beauty, like a lonely yellow flower hidden in a thicket. The chemistry of the cast and the sense of history transports you.  The commentary on Episodes 1 and 4 are very interesting, but don't listen to them until you watch the whole series.  This is an ace production. Watch it and take the time to be entertained and taught. I think I need to read the novel.",1150848000,20,1817,4.558282208588957
2223087,5,B0007N1BBC,"I am a budding period movie buff and have seen all the movies based on the works of Jane Austen (BBC, A and E and hollywood versions), as well as some others like ""Tess of the Durbervilles"", ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"", several versions of ""Jane Eyre"", the works of Charles Dickens, Shakespeare and more. I can honestly say that I have never been as entralled with anything as I was with this movie!!

I bought this movie based solely on the reviews on this site, and the fact that it is an A&E production and I had recently enjoyed watching ""Wives and Daughters"", also based on a Gaskell novel. I put the dvd in one night before bed to watch the first episode and see what it was like. Big mistake...I proceeded to stay up WAY passed my bedtime to watch the entire thing in one sitting (I should have known better, as A&E miniseries often have that effect on me)

I may even like this movie slightly better than the ever-famous ""Pride and Prejudice"" starring Colin Firth, and before I get brow-beaten by a bunch of P&P fanatics (I was one of you once, please be kind), let me explain myself. The love story here is very similar to that between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet. She takes an initial dislike while he reluctantly forms an attration, there is a botched proposal, she gradually comes to see his good qualities and falls in love herself. It is the REST of the story that puts this one over the top. The hero, Mr. Thorton, is the master of a cotton mill, while the heroine, Margaret, befriends a group of strike-ready mill workers. The viewer can understand both sides of the struggle and it is really interesting to see how it plays out. And of course, as others have mentioned, there is that last scene at the train station which is incredibly romantic : )

In short, if you are at all interested in period films, don't hesitate to purchase this. Believe me, you will want to watch it more than once.",1150588800,16,1908,4.445714285714286

The depiction of the milltown, the miserable lives of the mill workers, the union stirrings and the general labor unrest of the time was very well presented, as was, of course, the basic human drama. Everyone in the cast was superb, especially Sinead Cusack as the millowner's hard/soft mother, Brendan Coyle (why don't they use him more?)as the union leader, and the two leads. In this regard, I have to say that Richard Armitage was a revelation as the sexy, brooding and semi-tough millowner .  I never thought to see a worthy competitor to Colin Firth (Darcy) and Timothy Dalton (Rochester) but I think this guy can hold his own in that exalted company.  I predict a surge of interest in him after this, unless the women of the BBC viewing public have somehow been rendered unconscious.

2223089,5,B0007N1BBC,"North and South is my favorite book because I like the basic story and I really love the characters, and this feeling carried over to the series.

Even though the BBC adaptation of Wives and Daughters (another Elizabeth Gaskell book) was excellent and stuck more strictly to the book than North and South - I still enjoyed North and South more because of the reasons I love the book. I also thought the acting of the whole cast was as good as anything I have seen.

North and South is often compared with Pride and Prejudice and while there is a good reason for that, I actually feel it has as much in common with a Dickens tale. The book was actually first published by Dickens in his weekly paper/magazine and was viewed favorably by him. If I was to try and describe the tone of the piece I would describe it as a cross between a slightly less complicated Dickens tale and Jane Austen.

I never thought I would find a series I like better than Pride and Prejudice but I have. While it came to a resolved ending as most drama series do, whether tragic or happy, and I have previously been happy with that - there were several relationships in this that I wanted to follow further and I was wishing it would continue.",1150502400,9,1218,4.356828193832599
2223090,5,B0007N1BBC,"I ordered the DVD sight unseen, based on online reviews (something I've never done, by the way), and I cannot find the words to do justice to it. Wow.
I read the book a couple of months beforehand and liked it a lot, especially because of the social issues and how the internal lives of the characters (especially Margaret & Thornton) are developed by Gaskell. Yet somehow, while watching the miniseries I felt that it was, in some ways, an improvement over the book (sacrilegious though this might sound to fans of the book). This could be because it shows in a few scenes, with great economy, what Gaskell takes pages to tell, about the stresses and strains of the Industrial Revolution, class conflict and poverty, and also about the characters' feelings and motivations. It could also be because several of the characters are strengthened in Sandy Welch's script (Higgins and Bessy being the most notable examples). The early shots of the cotton mill were striking and Welch's line ""I've seen hell and it's snow white"" was a highlight for me.
Although I somewhat disagreed with some choices made - such as the circumstances under which the two leads first meet - I still felt that these changes fit in with the overall tone and flow of the adaptation, allowing me to understand or overlook them.
The music was deeply moving and appropriate, and significantly added to the emotional impact of the story. The camera work was very much to my liking, not static unlike many period dramas. As for the acting, I found both Daniela Denby-Ashe AND Richard Armitage convincing; though some think that RA does steal the show, DDA has a very difficult job playing a resilient, reserved character who internalises so many of her struggles. It's worth mentioning that even in the book, Margaret's (DDA's) emotions always have to be kept under wraps, (though I can still sense the tension simmering under the surface); Thornton's angst is more visible somehow, especially in the book, so RA has more material to work with than, say Colin Firth in Pride and Prejudice, and he does a wonderful job with it.

Let me quickly add that any comparisons between John Thornton and Darcy are odious and unfair to both, because in the respective books, John's perspective was far better developed than Darcy's. I adore both, though Darcy was my first literary love and so just about sneaks ahead. Thornton is among my top 2-3 favorite literary heroes, though.

And despite my liking for the humorous ending from the book (abrupt though it is), its counterpart in the miniseries, which was, shall we say, more fully developed, was simply sublime.

Someone once said that great film can be made from a very good book, but very rarely (if ever) is great film/TV the product of a great book. Perhaps this is why I will never be completely satisfied with an adaptation of Pride and Prejudice; not to denigrate any of the Pride and Prejudice adaptations, I will always ultimately return to the source for that satisfaction. As far as the book and miniseries versions of North and South are concerned, much as I liked the book, I just might feel differently :-)",1150416000,18,3133,4.787430683918669
2223091,5,B0007N1BBC,"Thank you BBC!!!!! This beautiful, haunting adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's novel is truly moving and unforgettable. As a period drama fan this one is my all-time favorite, in fact it takes period drama to a new level.

A superb ensemble cast, standouts are Sinead Cusack as the stern mother Hannah Thornton, Daniella Denby-Ashe as feisty, passionate Margaret Hale, and Richard Armitage as the stern, troubled and brooding John Thornton is a tour de force, a stunning performance, with tons of chemistry between the two leads.  People have been known to replay the stunning gasp-worthy ending over and over and over - you have been warned - it is  extremely addictive!!

A beautiful score complements the action, it is sad but compelling and one you will want to watch over and over.",1150329600,14,785,4.969465648854962
2223092,5,B0007N1BBC,"A friend of mine *insisted* that there was no reason for me to even rent North & South...I needed to buy it.  I finally decided to go for it, and I have a new favorite on my shelf!

North & South, like many BBC dramas, is beautifully shot, with incredible acting from all the leads (don't miss the opportunity to see the incredible Richard Armitage).  What sets it apart however, is the story, which has great depth, lots of romantic tension, and incredibly memorable characters.

Like a lot of the reviewers here, the BBC's production of ""Pride and Prejudice"" is a favorite of mine.  I can honestly say that ""North & South"" is on par with P & P.  Dont' hesitate to give it a try.",1150243200,13,680,4.357142857142857

Never, and I repeat never, have I seen such a fabulous film. It is so unbelievably romantic, yet deals with social issues in a way that Pride and Prejudice never touches, to completely warm my heart. John  Thornton is a combination of Mr. Darcy, Rhett Butler, Bono and JFK all combined into one fabulously sexy, charismatic and caring man. Kudos to Richard Armitage for being such a great actor, and for knocking Colin Firth off his pedestal as the BBC hearthrob of our times. If you haven't seen this yet, don't make the mistake I did of thinking the DVD cover was boring and thus not worthwhile. It will change your life, the way it changed mine!",1150243200,17,908,4.463855421686747
2223094,5,B0007N1BBC,"I recently viewed North and South.  This was a beautifully performed.  I have not read the book and will defer such comparisons to those who have.  I felt that this story explored many relationships that had great significance outside those of the love story itself.  There was the self doubt of Mr. Hales regarding the church, the fondness of a long time servant that ""stepped out of line"", the tight relationship of a mother and son, the begging of a daughter (Fanny) to be noticed by her family, the struggle and rise of the middle class, and the gradual growth of friendship between the ""master"" and Higgins.  I feel that these relationships brought color and depth to the otherwise lovable but predicable romantic aspect.

I found it interesting that Margaret was often standing in her scenes.  Also, she looked down alot when lost for words.  This may have been a deliberate acting gesture to express the emotional load that she assumed thru the story.  I would have liked to see more emphasis on Thorton visiting Higgins.  This is the first time in the movie that he noticably smiles--at the begging child.  He was obviously reaching into his past.  It was from then on that he became more ""human"" and softer gestures along with smiling were incorporated into his character.

The only other comment I have is on the final scene.  It is a lovely scene at the train station--very soft and touching.  However, his physically turning away because he couldn't bear to see her go back to the ""London"" train could have been emphasized.  This,with the subsequent realization of seeing her reflection in the window along with the relief that she had not rejected him again, could have been stronger. The final shot showed her gazing out the window--NOT SMILING, and him looking down.  I would have liked to see them at least happier.  Having said that, I truly enjoyed the performances and recommend North and South highly.",1150156800,12,1921,4.804878048780488
2223095,5,B0007N1BBC,"Unlike many BBC productions, North and South, based on the Elizabeth Gaskell novel, did not air in the United States. However, thankfully it has been released on DVD to garner American fans.

North and South tells the story of two people, Margaret Hale, a sheltered young woman from the south of England; and Mr. Thornton, a mill-owner in the industrial North. Not just a love story, North and South shows the conditions and struggles both workers and dwellers during the Industrial Age had to endure.

The production is truly superb. There is wonderful acting from period-drama newcomer Daniela Denby-Ashe, but Richard Armitage gives a stand out performance as the brooding Mr. Thornton; viewers will be hard pressed not to fall in love with him after this.

Elizabeth Gaskell's North and South rates among the top of costume dramas. Bravo!",1149897600,7,841,5.0359712230215825
2223096,5,B0007N1BBC,"This is such a wonderful film. The main character is Margaret Hale. Her father uproots the family to move them North to Milton, an industrial town. While looking for a house to rent, Margaret meets Mr. Thornton under less than perfect circumstances and takes an instant dislike to him. He, on the other hand, is intrigued by her. Their relationship takes many twists and turns. Margaret comes to understand Mr. Thornton and admire him, but past misunderstandings and a rejected marriage proposal makes it difficult for them. (Sound familiar.)
This movie reminds me very much of Pride and Prejudice. I guess that's why I love it so much. If you like Pride and Prejudice, you will like this movie.
Wonderful scenes to look for:
1. When Henry comes to visit Margaret in Heldstand. - Part One
2. The letter to Edith, Margaret's cousin. "" I think I have seen Hell, and it is white. Snowy white."" - Part One
3. The angry mob scene. Margaret throws herself in harms way to protect Mr. Thornton. - Part Two
4. The marriage proposal. (Bless his heart.) - Part Two
5. The death of her father. - Part Four
6. Higgins explains some things about Margaret to Thornton. This explanation is crucial to resolving the conflict between Margaret and Thornton. - Part Four
7. The train depot - half way to London. Margaret and Thornton meet after several months. (The kiss.) - Part Four

If you love Pride and Prejudice and other BBC mini-series, you will love this movie. A bit darker than Wives and Daughters by Elizabeth Gaskell, North and South depicts the conditions of cotton mill workers in industrialized England and the tensions between classes at the time. Richard Armitage gives an outstanding performance as Mr. Thornton. If you like the dark and brooding types (ala Colin Firth, who will always hold a special place in my heart), you'll definitely sigh over him! And the ending--yes, it's changed from the book and is perhaps unrealistic--is very satisfying and romantic! I only wish Gaskell had written more so the movie didn't have to end.

The book does differ, but I prefer the movie ending over the books.  I thought that Daniela Denby-Ashe portrayed her character Margaret beautifully.  And Richard Armitage, well he was everything that I would want as a leading man, (except for the temper).  I want to be Margaret!  What really made this movie top rate to me is the historical plot.  It wasn't all about the rich and luxurious life styles that are usually played out, but of the life of a common industrial city back in the 19th Century.  My husband who hates my chick flicks really enjoyed this movie and its accurate portrayl of that time and has watched more than once with me.",1147046400,14,779,4.398601398601398
2223102,2,B0007N1BBC,"The BBC has done so many wonderful presentations based on classics, and they almost always do spectacular jobs: Middlemarch, Pride and Prejudice, The Way We Live Now are all wonderful pieces that convey the spirit and the sense of the novels they aim to portray.

I wish the same could be said for North and South.  Now it is a hard book to update: Mrs. Gaskell attempts to portray both the workers and the factory owners in a positive light, and I suppose that's not entierly politically correct these days.  How else can I explain that the first time we see Mr. Thornton he is beating up one of his workers?  I'm sorry, I think I missed that part of the book.

And it's just downhill from there: the changes they make waver between odd and ridiculous.  I understand that to condense a novel into a miniseries requires some serious editing, but the problems here aren't so much what they leave out but what they add in: the fist fight at the beginning, the circumstances surrounding Mr. Hale's leaving the church, Mrs. Thornton's lace being factory made (a rather important point in the book is that it is antique), the strange things that happen during Margaret's Helstone visit, Mr. Bell's fate (the biggest ""huh?"" of the movie)... the list goes on.  And don't even get me started about the final scene, where Margaret's behavior is EVEN WORSE than the behavior she exhibited earlier in the movie that got her into so much trouble!  Not exactly a historically accurate way for a 19th century heroine to be acting...

This wasn't exactly my favorite book of all time, though it had its charm and I enjoyed it for what it was.  I was looking forward to this movie because I assumed it would be made to the same high standards as similar movies.  But do yourself a favor: skip this movie and read the book.  It is far superior.",1146873600,34,1827,4.553516819571866
2223103,5,B0007N1BBC,"This movie is an instant classic!  Wow, what a gem!  It will stand beside (maybe even replace?) ""Pride and Prejudice"" as THE period piece of all period pieces!

Let me just say, I rarely buy DVDs (especially without viewing them first), and I rarely watch movies again in a short time span.  However, after reading the reviews of this movie and finding my local library did not have it, I purchased the film.  I AM SO HAPPY I DID BECAUSE IT SURPASSED ALL OF MY EXPECTATIONS!  This movie is so HAUNTINGLY BEAUTIFUL and STUNNING that I have owned it for only five days and I've already watched it twice--and I can't wait to watch it again!  This movie just draws you in--it's so romantic and yet subtle, and it does a fabulous job exploring the social issues created by the Industrial Revolution.  It truly takes you on a remarkable journey, sweeping you off your feet!  The film makes you take a keen interest in the characters' lives, and you can't turn it off until you find out how it ends.  (And the ending is SUPERB!  *SIGH*  You will love it!  It's definitely THE most romantic movie ending I've ever seen, and it's accomplished with ""less is more"".  It's so tender and beautiful that I predict you'll watch the last 8 minutes over and over!)

The characters and their development are FABULOUS!  Mr. Thornton is so complex and has so many dimensions--you come to appreciate what a compelling character he is after exploring his motivations and thoughts during the course of the film.  And to see how tender he is at the end (and to see him smile!) is so breathtaking and satisfying!  Richard Armitage is STUNNING in this role.  He gives the performance of a lifetime--a certain classic.  He really made Mr. Thornton into a real person, a person you want to understand and want Margaret to love.  WOW!  I have to admit, I thought Daniela Denby-Ashe was a little weak as Margaret (she was just a little too breathy and whiny at moments for me), but Richard Armitage made up for everything and was SUPERB.  Truly outstanding!

I'm on a period-movie kick right now (much to my husband's dismay!) and have watched ""Wives and Daughters"", A&E's ""Pride and Prejudice"", the new ""Pride and Prejudice"", and ""North and South"" over the space of two weeks.  I have to say, ""North and South"" is the one that I can't stop thinking about.  The music is hauntingly gorgeous, and the story has so many fabulous dimensions to draw you in.

Needless to say, not only was I not disappointed, this film (as well as the novel) quickly became my favorite romance of all time.  No small feat, as I love Pride and Prejudice, The Winslow Boy, Emma, and Sense and Sensibility, among others.

All you need to know are two words:  Richard Armitage.  Okay, three words if you add a ""yummy"" or an audible *sigh*.  This guy makes the film, owns the character, and for me at least, pushed Colin Firth off the top of the be-all-end-all list of best looking guys in a cravat.

2223109,5,B0007N1BBC,"I would first like to remark on the many comparisons that other reviewers have made between this TV series and Pride & Prejudice. Unlike the other reviewers, I have to say that the only similarity between this movie and Pride & Prejudice is the fact that both heroes were in love with heroines who initially despised them for whatever reasons.

In fact, the hero in this movie more resembles Roger Moore in Charlotte Bronte's ""Shirley"" or even Mr. Knightley in Jane Austen's ""Emma."" This is not Mr. Darcy and this is definitely not Pride & Prejudice.

With that said, P&P still retains its corner in my heart and this series has found another corner in my heart. The story is indeed engaging and very dark. I thought the cast was fantastic. (Since watching it I went out and purchased the book). I must admit that there were times when I was wishing for something ""green"" that is so customary in these British tv series, but I was so caught up with the affairs of the characters that somehow the darkness felt right.

I very much loved the hero in this movie. His stark integrity, directness, and honorable qualities are so reminiscent of Roger Moore in Bronte's ""Shirley"" and Knightley in Austen's ""Emma."" The actor is also very handsome.

I loved Margaret as well. I loved her frankness and loyalty.

The story has several similarities to Pride and Prejudice, but it truly has original elements.  I did not feel any impatience with parallels between the two.  All the actors were perfect for their roles.  They all brought grace and intelligence to their roles.  No overblown theatrics...these actors make Gwyneth Paltrow's performance in 'Emma' look heavy-handed and artificial.  Daniela Denby-Ashe as Margaret is luminous and intelligent--never annoying.  She is sincere about wanting to understand her new town and its residents.  And Richard Armitage is the most appealing actor I have ever watched anywhere!  I never have had a crush on an actor.  I do now!  He is so compelling to watch.  I agree with the other reviewers who state that he just might have topped the terrific Colin Firth in the BBC's Pride and Prejudice.

If you loved Colin Firth's Darcy in Pride and Prejudice-you will adore Richard Armitage emotional and romantically brooding portrayal of John Thornton. I predict that this role will propel Mr Armitage's career as P&P did for Firth. This is a timeless story of love, class struggle and family.

2223123,5,B0007N1BBC,"For those of us with an unashamed weakness for good period dramas, the BBC's NORTH AND SOUTH satisfies on several levels, despite it's gloomy industrial leitmotif.  Since it is based on the novel by Elizabeth Gaskell, we know that it will be more genteel than the Brontes, yet still pack a Romantic, but Victorian, wallop.  It's beautifully done cinematically: the physical contrast between Northern and Southern England is stark---the former, has skies that are, cold, gray, and constantly on the verge of storm.  It is home to cotton mills whose interiors are prey to the the whirling snow of cotton fibers.  Our window into the South tends toward green fields needing mowing, yellow primroses or time in a London townhouse with a ""bell jar"" atmosphere.

N & S has engaging characters we admire and come close to detesting at the same time.  Margaret Hale (Daniela Denby-Ashe) comes to Milton, a Northern factory town, with her father, a former vicar, who has given up his parish on a point of conscience and her mother, an invalid with an over-protective servant in tow.  Margaret casts a wary eye on life as it is lived in Milton because these rough-tongued Northerners upset her ideas of everthing from good manners to independent women.  The foremost villan of her North is John Thornton (Richard Arimtage), a factory owner who beats a factory-worker under her nose at her first meeting with him.  A close runner-up is Nicholas Higgins (Brendan Coyle), an idealistic labour leader whose rough honesty and wary hospitality humanizes him in our eyes from the start.

What the story-line lacks in originality is made up tenfold by the fine performances of the cast previously mentioned and other notable performance by Sinead Cusack as Thornton's cold, wary, bristling mother and Anna Maxwell Mantin's turn as the aggressively air-headed daughter of the Thornton house.

This four part (two disc) set will be something I'll view again and again in the future because it is satisfying on so many levels---the music is powerful, the political theory is irrefutable, and I defy the viewer not to be deeply moved by the last scenes in a train station.

And it is only a kiss - far more romantic and better than the current claptrap of our modern age showing everything!  You will fall in love with the star - what a guy!  And the heroine is so spunky and darling too.

My only criticism was that BBC America cut an hour out of the T.V. version so you have to buy the dvd to see what you missed!  That makes me so mad but I guess they get you to buy it.

You will never regret it, and while it is a wonderful story for both men and women, women will especially enjoy it a bit better.  It is also good for children - very ""G"" rated and gives them a sense of English history in Dickens' time!  Highly recommend!",1139788800,15,1074,3.9488372093023254
2223127,5,B0007N1BBC,"I have to say, I absolutely adored this movie. When I first saw the cover, it didn't seem very interesting, especially with my grandmother's vague description of it as, ""Two places that don't understand each other."" But was I ever in for a surprise! After seeing the first episode I was totally hooked. The beautifully romantic story, mixed with a fastinating cause, was irresistible.

It tells the story of Margaret Hale, a young woman whose father uproots her and her mother from their gorgeous, comfortable house in the south, to Milton, an industrial northern town. Margaret is shocked by the poverty and brutality of this place. After she sees a cottonmill owner, Mr Thornton, beating up one of his workers, she lays a hatred on the handsome, though brooding, man. Over time, however, after aiding mill-workers in their strike, she begins to accept Milton and even Mr Thornton, to a degree. Will she be ready, however, when Mr Thornton confesses...love?

This movie is absolutly brilliant. The acting is superb and the ending is unforgetably romantic, as other reviewers have already mentioned. By the end I was sobbing. It is amazing. Now I have to go see it again.",1139356800,10,1171,4.909090909090909
2223128,5,B0007N1BBC,"North and South (2004) has been categorised as the next Pride and Prejudice (1995).  A few similarities are there but North and South is distinctly more satisfying in its conclusion.  Richard Armitage's Thornton has the same unforgettable presence and appeal as Colin Firth's Darcy. No one with a heart can fail to be stirred by the scene where Thornton says, ""Look back at me."" and the last scene is the most romantic wish-it-will-happen-to-me scene for which any true believer would hope.

My recommendation: Beg, Borrow or Steal, but North and South must be seen.",1138665600,15,566,5.0
2223129,5,B0007N1BBC,"This movie is simply wonderful! For the Pride and Prejudice fans, you will see that Richard Armitage would make a perfect Mr. Darcy! It's a wonderful adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's work focusing on the differences between the genteel life in the southern part of England and the harsher life of the mill workers in the northern part of England. The characters come to life and by the end you understand them better and really feel for them. Daniela Denby-Ashe does a superb job as Margaret Hale and Richard Armitage romances you as John Thornton.",1138579200,12,549,4.851063829787234
2223130,5,B0007N1BBC,"As a would-be anglophile, I certainly agree with the previous glowing reviews of this BBC presentation.  It too, for me, is one of the best (if not the best) BBC miniseries that I've ever seen and I have seen many.  What I love the most about this series is that it shows the ""class struggle"" at all levels whether it is social status, geographical status (from what area a person is from or what local they might inhabit) employment level status (worker, employer) etc.-(I'm still of the strong opinion that it still DOES matter no matter where one might live) Anyway, this presentation does a wonderful job of showing the class differences in England mid-1800.  The acting is simply superb by a huge cast; however, I must single out a few of my favorites.

Richard Aarmitage plays the moody mill owning Thornton.-what a wonderful character very much like Mr. Darcy in ""Pride and Prejudice"". He's a dark, brooding, handsome and seemingly not too nice man; however, in actuality he is a very good man.  Aarmitage turns in a fantastic performance on the level of Colin Firth (as Mr. Darcy) in Pride and Prejudice.  Daniela Denby-Ashe, as Margaret the heroine of the story and Thornton's love interest, is marvelous as one of those very strong ""Jane Austin type of women""  Thornton's haughty but basically good mother is played wonderfully by Sinead Cusack.  I also love Tim Piggot-Smith (in more of a subdued role for him) as Mr. Hale, Margaret's father.  To be honest all of the actors are great in this presentation.

This miniseries exhibits great direction along with a great script.  The recreation of the era and local is marvelous.  I love the cotton mill scenes with the machines roaring and cotton dust flying all over the place-fabulous. (The final scene in the train station is one you'll always remember--it's heart tugging!!)

If you want to be well entertained and love great acting, a great story, great direction and great recreation of an era gone by, buy this disc-believe me, you'll love it.",1138579200,20,2009,4.822157434402333

2223132,5,B0007N1BBC,"I rarely buy DVDs without having first seen the film, but based on reviews posted here and over on Netflix, the very favorable comparisons made to Colin Firth's Darcy in ""Pride and Prejudice"" and Richard Armitage's John Thornton in ""North and South"", I rushed out and bought this sight unseen. I didn't really expect it to live up to all the rave reviews, but I'm delighted to say it exceeded them, and oh, what a romantic ending -- compares favorably the ending in the Kiera Knightley/Matthew Macfayden movie, ""Pride and Prejudice"" although it takes place beginning on a railway platform and ending inside a train carriage.

I certainly can see why many compare ""North and South"" with ""Pride and Prejudice"" although most refer to the 1995 BBC production. But I would include the 2005 film in my comparison (and I love both versions) because, for example, I really noticed the close-ups on the touching of Thornton's and Margaret's hands, especially at the dinner party (I half expected Thornton to flex his hand as Macfayden's Darcy did; he doesn't) and later Margaret kissing his hand -- both these events compare very favorably with Matthew Macfayden's Darcy's reaction to holding Lizzy's hand to help her in a carriage and the ending when she kisses his hand. And Thornton's more casual look in the final sequences without his coat and cravat -- which gives him a romantic Lord Byron look in his big sleeved white shirt with wide cuffs which come to his knuckles -- rivals the casual look Darcy presented when he comes to Lizzy at dawn at the end of the film. These men go from being buttoned up and formal to more casual romantic suitors. It's very pleasing. I think most women will swoon at the kisses -- the best I've seen in a very long time -- as I did and it is true the 5+ minute ending is one of the most romantic and satisfying ever filmed. I've rewatched it many times.

Although the excellent story (wonderfully acted throughout by a talented cast) is grim at times (people do die in this), and it is certainly not the lighthearted fare of ""Pride and Prejudice"" as it deals with the Industrial Revolution -- the horrifying working conditions in the cotton mills, strikers versus their employers -- I think the story is more real and easier to relate to than ""Pride and Prejudice."" And, interestingly enough, it is a story which would more easily be updated to a present day story in some ways (look at United Airlines, General Motors and others which are struggling with worker's vs. management, layoffs and averting financial ruin). I found it is easier to relate to businessman/entrepreneur John Thornton struggling to run his cotton mill, a huge manufacturing complex, as he deals with restless workers and the market forces of the cotton industry (the pre-Civil War Americans -- this story is set around 1850 -- are flooding the English markets with cheap cotton products and English manufacturers like Thornton are having a hard time competing) than to landed gentry and matchmaking of Jane Austen's books. This business aspect, as well as certain parts of the love story, are almost contemporary.

The love/hate, pride/prejudice behavior between Thornton and Margaret definitely rivals in many ways the Elizabeth/Darcy relationship right down to her rejection of his offer of marriage, their verbal barbs, his walking from her home after his rejected proposal (shades of Colin Firth's Darcy leaving Mr. Collin's house after Lizzy rejected him). Above all, Richard Armitage (a very handsome actor) as Thornton definitely does smoulder as much as Colin Firth's Darcy did -- maybe more so. I hope to see a lot more of him because it's not just looks here, but he's a very fine and talented actor.

All the actors in this production are terrific. This is a wonderful BBC production I can highly recommend and again, the last 5 minutes are among the most romantic ever filmed!",1137974400,35,3892,4.84812030075188

2223134,5,B0007N1BBC,"I love period pieces.  There is nothing greater than to be transported into an era that is different from this one.  I am a sucker for historical novels and enjoy imagining the scenery, clothing and characters of those times, but watching them come to life on my television could be just as wonderful.  I bought the BBC DVD called North and South because of all the rave reviews here.  Oh. My. God!  This has got to be one of, if not the best historical mini-series I have ever watched.  It is right up there with Pride and Prejudice and a few Spanish-language historical ""telenovelas"" I've seen over the years.  This is the series adaptation of the classic Elizabeth Gaskell novel (which I read almost ten years ago) about Margaret Hale, the beautiful daughter of a middle-class clergyman and her sudden departure from the southern countryside to the seedy world of factories and tradesmen in the north of England.  Milton is quite a different world from what she is accustomed to, especially when she meets the Thornton family, namely the disarming cotton manufacturer Mr. John Thornton, whom she sees as uncouth and uneducated based on his ill treatment to one of his employees.  When Mr. Thornton becomes one of her father's pupils, feelings ensue between them, but pride and prejudice keep them from getting close.  To his annoyance, Margaret befriends a family of steel workers whose main breadwinner is leading an union that will enable manufacturers to increase their underlings' wagers.  This does not sit well with Thornton, for his business is in trouble...

This wonderful Victorian love story set against the backdrop of the industrialized England is one beautiful surprise!  I used the ""pride and prejudice"" thing on purpose because the plot is vaguely similar to the Jane Austen novel.  In fact, there was a particular scene that reminded me a great deal of the proposal/rejection scene in P&P, only this one is more heartfelt.  Despite the comparisons, North and South is a memorable story in its own right.  Daniela Anby-Ashe is wonderful as the spirited Margaret Hale.  Brendan Coyle was compelling in his portrayal of the sweet-natured and determined union leader Nicholas Higgins, Sinead Cusack was incredible in her role of the proud and protective mother Hannah Thornton, and Jo Joyner does a good job in playing the snobbish and annoying sister Fanny Thornton.  But it is Richard Armitage that took my breath away in his role of Mr. Thornton.  He brought the hero with a tough and brutal exterior but with a heart of gold to life!  He also brings a great deal of sensuality to his character using his beautiful eyes.  Mr. Armitage is not handsome in a conventional way, but his eyes, smoky voice and nuance portrayal of a flawed romantic hero has drawn many female viewers to him, including me. Swoon.  He is right up there with Colin Firth when it comes to adding sex appeal to his acting.  He is a gifted, wonderful actor and I shall look forward to watching something else with him in it in the future.  As for the mini-series, the story is wonderfully woven and executed.  The story doesn't follow the novel through and through though.  Some changes were made and I think Thornton is more complex and in depth here than he was in the book.  The ending is also different from the novel, but I enjoyed this ending because it kept the overall romantic feel of this adaptation.  There are several memorable scenes in this series.  My personal favorite is the one where Thornton says, ""Look back at me.""  (You'll see what I mean when you watch the film.  Sigh.) As for the other aspects of the series, I enjoyed getting a glimpse of the seedy world of Milton and its inhabitants, and the wardrobe and scenery are beautiful!  The cinematography is amazing.  I marvel at the lighting and how it set the mood when they changed from the colorful scenes in the countryside cottage to the dark and gloomy ones in Milton.  The music scores also set the perfect tone for the scenes.  You can tell just how much attention to detail went into the filming process.  I cannot recommend North and South enough.  Hollywood hasn't created something this beautiful in a long time.  It appears that I will have to look to BBC for wonderful acting, gorgeous sets and beautiful stories whenever I'm in the mood for a period piece.  I look forward to watching more novel adaptations like this one.",1137888000,28,4399,4.768518518518518
2223135,5,B0007N1BBC,"This mini-series is one of the best compared with Pride and Prejudice. I can't stop watching it. The tension between Mr. Thornton and Margaret is unbearable.

2223136,5,B0007N1BBC,"I can add little to what others have said. I bought this for my wife based on the reviews here on Amazon and we were completely captured by it. Extremely well-done - acting, photography, etc.

Some viewers on the BBC website have taken issue with the adaptation from Gaskell's novel, but for the most part, the story coheres and is intact within itself. Only in the last scene does the script and director seem to depart from strict Victorian mores as an accomodation to modern sensibilities. But even then, it's hardly a deal-breaker.

As good as Pride and Prejudice? I can't say that exactly, since P&P was at least twice as long and had more time to be more entertaining. But I will say this -- N&S was far, far superior to most dramas on Masterpiece Theatre in recent years. Certainly equal to Wives and Daughters, and probably better. N&S has the benefit of a better male role in Mr. Thornton, and this production has the indisputable asset of Richard Armitage. My wife really liked him and I think that Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy is in serious danger of being dethroned as the 19th Century paragon of appeal.

It seems to me that Gaskell adapts to the screen more successfully than Dickens is. We'll see what Andrew Davies does with Bleak House later in 2006.

Go ahead and get this. You will not be disappointed, I assure you.",1136592000,11,1330,4.57563025210084

2223139,5,B0007N1BBC,"With his sharp, hawklike features and piercing eyes, Richard Armitage (Cold Feet ser. 5), gives a breathtaking perfomance in what is doubtless to become his signature role as the stern, powerful, proud cotton-mill owner, John Thornton, in this splendid four-part 2004 adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's turbulent 1855 novel, North & South.

Margaret Hale is a beautiful young woman who has been a part of London society and who ""hales"" from an Edenic village in the South of England--a part of the world where life moves at a slower pace, untainted by the filth, over-crowding, anonymity, and abject poverty which was a by-product of the industrial revolution in the North.  Her life is turned upside down, however, when her father, a local vicar, suffers a crisis of faith which results in him leaving the church and uprooting his family to the dreary, smoky, northern industrial town of Milton where he hopes to eke out a living as a tutor.

Margaret is disgusted by all she sees in this new, foreign place which is unlike anything she has ever known.  She lays the fault for the appalling social conditions at the feet of the industrialists--the ""masters""--towards whom she betrays an almost instant prejudice.  The industrialist who bears the brunt of Margaret's antagonism and criticism is John Thornton, a pupil and friend of her father's.

The central story revolves around the antagonistic relationship between these two characters, and it is hard not to make comparisons with Austen's Pride & Prejudice.  Though he's a hard-working industrialist rather than an idle, landed gentleman, Thornton is very similar to Darcy, as much for his serious, stern, brooding nature as for his integrity and strength of character.  Also like Darcy, he falls desperately in love--despite himself--with a strong-willed, proud, outspoken, intelligent young woman who spurns his love and sends him off with his tail between his legs.  Like the aloof, prejudiced Elizabeth Bennet, it is only after spurning her would-be lover that Margaret Hale comes to realize just what sort of man she has rejected.  That said, I will say no more regarding their relationship, as I don't wish to spoil the story for those unfamiliar.

North & South also deals with the working and living conditions of the mill workers and with the labour unions of the time.  We see the union from the perspective of both the masters and the workers, but we also see tension within the ranks of the workers.  Solidarity is the foundation upon which the union gets its strength, but we are forced to question the justification of the union's tyrannical enforcement of it when we see cruel harships befall certain individuals as a result.

Dvd extras include deleted scenes and an interesting 15-minute interview with Richard Armitage.  Text-based extras include interesting production notes and ""bios"" of 5 of the main actors, which consist of little in the way of biography and are mostly comments about themselves and their roles!  There is also a commentary on episodes 1 & 4.

North & South is a powerful, passionate, beautiful story (not to mention rivetting--I initially watched it on television, and rarely have I seen a show in which it was SO hard to wait for the next episode).  The acting is flawless and the production values unsurpassed, which result in a visually stunning, rich, dynamic presentation.  I have no hesitation in saying that this is one of the best dramas (period or otherwise) produced by the BBC in a very long time.  It will be a special treat for anyone with a penchant for period productions; as for those who enjoyed 1995's Pride & Prejudice, it is absolutely a must see!  In short, this is one mini-series which I cannot praise highly enough, and I recommend it unreservedly to anyone looking for top quality dramatic entertainment.",1136160000,182,3824,5.0

Richard Armitage, who plays John Thornton, is as handsome and skilled as Colin Firth, who plays Mr. Darcy.  And, Daniela Denby-Ashe, who plays Margaret Hale, possesses the fiesty and strong personality as well as natural beauty to provide the romantic tension so wonderfully felt between the character of Thornton and Hale.

2223151,5,B0007N1BBC,"I just wanted to share my enthusiasm for this wonderful BBC adaptation.  I'm a fan of classic literature, particularly 19th century English literature.  I read and absolutely loved ""North and South"" by Elizabeth Gaskell, and was excited when I saw the DVD would be made available in the US.  I just got my pre-ordered copy a couple days ago, and all I can say is that it was AMAZING.  I've watched and loved many other BBC adaptations, including the beloved ""Pride and Prejudice"" and Gaskell's own ""Wives and Daughters.""  ""North and South,"" however, is my absolute favorite.

What's so great about it is that it accurately depicts middle and working class life in the Victorian era.  So many other adaptations made the time period seem to consist entirely of morning calls, dinner parties, and balls.  ""North and South,"" however, shows the daily struggles and class differences.  You keenly feel the pain and pleasure of every character, however minor.

And of course, what's truly wonderful is watching the progression of the love story between Margaret Hale and John Thronton.  The Margaret from my reading of the novel was different in my head, so Daniella Denby-Ashe took a little getting used to.  But by then end I thought she was wonderful.  Richard Armitrage, however, was wonderful as Thornton.  His acting was so nuanced that you could read his feelings from his facial expressions.  I loved how he got a lot of screen time compared to the male characters in other adaptations/novels.  Each scene showing the interaction between Thornton and Margaret was perfectly played out.  So many favorite scenes!  Though in particular I thought the part where he sees Margaret and her brother at the station, then the whole resulting police investigation and  Thornton and Margaret's first interaction after that was really good.  Behind his hurt pride and outward cold demeanor, you could see the pain and hidden love in his eyes.  Also noteworthy is the scene where Margaret is leaving Milton, and Thornton is watching the departing carriage saying ""look back at me.""  I could go on and on...

Initially I was disappointed that a few of my favorite scenes from the novel were not included (such as Thornton laying Margaret on the sofa after the riot scene, here's quoting from the novel:

""He bore her into the dining-room, and laid her on the sofa

there; laid her down softly, and looking on her pure white face,

the sense of what she was to him came upon him so keenly that he

spoke it out in his pain:

'Oh, my Margaret--my Margaret! no one can tell what you are to

me! Dead--cold as you lie there, you are the only woman I ever

loved! Oh, Margaret--Margaret!' Inarticulately as he spoke,

kneeling by her, and rather moaning than saying the words, he

started up, ashamed of himself, as his mother came in. She saw

nothing, but her son a little paler, a little sterner than usual.""

though obviously she was not dead only unconscious.  A lot of things were also changed (such as Henry Lennox's character, the whole situation under which Thorton and Margaret first met, the addition of the character Anne Latimer, etc), but the spirit of the book remained and the changes make sense for the purposes of the screen adaptation.  In fact, much of the added dialogue is true to what Gaskell herself might have written, such as Margaret writing to Edith about the cotton mills ""I believe I've seen hell, and it is white, snow white.""

Basically, I strongly recommend you get both the DVD and the book.  Don't get discouraged by the slow start to the novel, it's worth sticking to.  BTW, the theme music on the DVD was perfect as well.  Enjoy!",1132444800,18,3648,4.7744
2223152,5,B0007N1BBC,"I just got this movie the other day (RIGHT after it was released in the US, actually).  I don't normally buy movies on DVD without first seeing them, but I decided to go ahead and do it with this one because I had heard such good reviews about it from people whose opinions I trust very highly, since they have similar tastes.

I'm glad I did buy it because this movie was made SO well.  The story is a fairly common one- actually, it is very similar to Pride and Prejudice, with one character very proud for much of the movie, and another being prejudiced against the first, all based on a misunderstanding.  Some scenes even harken back to the BBC version of Pride and Prejudice, but this film also stands very firmly on its own two feet.  It is set in the North of England, and everything from the background scenery (with cotton flying through the air surrounding the mills) to the accents of the characters (very easy to make class distinctions) is done wonderfully.

The characters also come across very well.  I had never heard of either Richard Armitage or Daniela Denby-Ashe before this production- now I'll be sure to watch for them.  Armitage's portrayal in particular was spectacular.  He gave Mr. Thornton's character so much depth that it really was possible to feel, like Miss Hale, that the man had major flaws, but fall in love with him all the same.

I didn't think Daniela did as well a job at portraying Margaret Hale as Richard Armitage did with portraying Mr. Thornton, but she did act pretty well.  And the movie, overall, is superb.  Between the authentic settings, the beautiful music, and the wonderful plot, I fell in love with North & South.  And if you, like me, enjoyed BBC's Pride and Prejudice, Wives and Daughters, and all its other period productions, I have no doubt you will ejoy this one as well.",1132444800,9,1833,4.585889570552148
2223153,5,B0007N1BBC,"Having enjoyed the brightness and light heartedness of films such as the 1990's Emma and Pride & Prejudice, I was not impressed by the initial dark and bleakness of North & South.

But by the end of the first episode, my doubts at purchasing this DVD (without ever seeing or hearing of the movie/book) were banished and I was a goner.

No long descriptions from me just: OH MY GOSH. *sigh* I have never loved a movie as much as this. I have never been swept up by passion as strong as this. I wish for amnesia just so I can be mesmorised for the first time ... again! I know, what a nutter.

Thank you Elizabeth Gaskell for the story the movie is based on. Thank you Sandy Welch for a magnificent adaptation.

Thank you Brian Percival for your wonderful direction. Thank you to all the cast for taking my breath away. And thank you to the BBC for making it all possible.",1130976000,40,870,4.286585365853658

Goes without saying that Richard Armitage is brilliant in this movie, however, so is the rest of the cast in my opinion.  Actually, the only one I thought lacking was Daniella Denby-Ashe.  She, I thought, just missed.  But it doesn't matter, this is still worth watching over and over.

Highly recommended.",1128124800,8,543,4.723404255319149
2223155,5,B0007N1BBC,I am so excited to see this available in the U.S.  I watched this on BBCAmerica and I was totally hooked from the first moment to the last.  I love Pride and Prejudice and am eager to have this also.  I will watch it six times a week.  It is an awesome film and has a great story line.  I think that Mr. Thornton is absolutely gorgeous and Ms. Hale a very independent heroine.  All the characters and actors are wonderful.  It is a must have. I can't explain how much I LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie!! Thank you Amazon.,1127347200,11,515,4.09
2223156,5,B0007N1BBC,"You thought you liked Pride & Prejudice, Emma, Persuasion, JAne Eyre etc etc...well you are about to enter another level of period drama heaven....RUN don't walk to buy this one, buy two, because you will be lending it out to all your friends...
Why?
The most compelling story from an excellent novel, the tightest, leanest script by Sandy Welch, the superb cinematography and production design, make this the best period drama I have ever seen, it makes the others pale into comparision.

The actors are a fantastic ensemble, including the superb Sinead Cusack as Mrs Thornton the matriach, Daniela Denby-Ashe is the spirited and lovely heroine Margaret, and Richard Armitage who plays Mr Thornton is the most talented, brooding, smouldering, intelligent, moving and compelling leading man it has been my pleasure ever to witness.....this man was robbed of a BAFTA - he is nothing short of magnificent...
and it's not just for women, it's a sad, funny, romantic, stirring story of loss, love and struggle that anyone can enjoy.. and I believe you will enjoy this.",1127174400,18,1064,5.045454545454546
2223157,5,B0007N1BBC,"I'm a history teacher with a long-standing interest in portrayals the past in film. Some productions are OK (""Pride and Prejudice""), some are downright awful (""The Patriot""). THIS is magnificent.

Class conflict is not something American audiences like to deal with. In general we'd much rather pretend that everyone is middle class, now and in the past as well. Set in England,""North and South"" is not only the best love story I've ever seen, but it is also an honest look at how industrialized nations have developed their prosperity on the backs of the least. This is not to say it is a bash-the-capitalist flick either; in one compelling scene an unemployed union man asks the mill owner for a job, saying he'll take lower wages if necessary to provide for his foster children. Thornton (mill owner) points out the union would be down on him like a ton of bricks if *he'd* suggested hiring him at a lower wage. There's a lot to think about, as well as a lot to break your heart over, in this film.

While not entirely true to Elizabeth Gaskell's 1855 novel, the ""creative license"" portions of the adaptation are acceptable. The cast, costumes, and locations (including a historic working mill) are superb. Absolutely the best historic adaptation ever---and yes, now my favorite love story.",1127174400,15,1293,4.846153846153846
