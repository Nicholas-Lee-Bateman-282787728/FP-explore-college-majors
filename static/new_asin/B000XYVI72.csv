8230289,4,B000XYVI72,"I was getting up to go to bathroom 1 to 2 times (sometimes more) per night for many years, I am 54.  I started to use this video and within 2 weeks I may get up 1 time in the night but not always.  I am so excited.  We all know how important a good nights sleep is!

I highly recommend this video. The first workout, which is the one I use, lasts about 15 min, I only do it every other day.  It's so simple!",1505088000,,407,3.686046511627907
8230290,1,B000XYVI72,"Ugh, wish I knew it was Pilates before I bought it (didn't say it was in another description).  This hurts my back like crazy, and it feels like my hoo-hah is blowing out while doing the exercises.  Yes, I'm doing them correctly.  Yes I've done Pilates before, and it always hurts my lower back due to a spinal issue.  I've been using the Hab-It dvd by Tasha Mulligan video for a year with great results, but wanted a little more variety.  Thought I'd try this, and am very disappointed.",1435536000,3,487,4.426966292134831

8230293,3,B000XYVI72,"This is for those interesting in tightening the PC muscle which could increase sexual pleasure for yourself and your partner. She uses the ""kegel"" tightening exercise as the base exercise to accomplish this. Which I know does help tighten the vagina because I used to do them. However, I wish I had know this because if you have IC or vulvodynia like I do, you do not want to do kegel related exercises (reverse kegels are good). But, I gave it a try and the first one I tried caused me pain :(",1417824000,,494,4.32258064516129

8230295,3,B000XYVI72,"The exercises in this DVD are helpful, but the music sounds like the kind of music you would hear if watching a porno movie.  Once I master the exercises, I am going to do them with the mute on.
If I'd known it, I would have bought a book instead.",1298073600,16,247,3.94
