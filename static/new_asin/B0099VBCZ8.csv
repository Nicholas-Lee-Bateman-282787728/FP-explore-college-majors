8538162,5,B0099VBCZ8,"Very good tutorial DVD.  Well thought out and organized.  Bought it based on other reviews and don't regret the decison.  Reading the users manual is okay, but seeing a function demonstrated and explained is the best way for me to learn.  The Maven explains things simply and directly.  Thanks, Michael.",1395273600,2,303,4.98

8538164,4,B0099VBCZ8,I recently purchased this DVD with the hope of learning about my newly purchased Canon EOS Rebel T4i.  Michael does a good job of explaining everything on the camera.  I wished he was able to go into more detail about certain things like how to use the preview finder.  But this is a great overall video and definitely worth the purchase.,1356998400,2,338,4.508196721311475
8538165,5,B0099VBCZ8,I have had other training materials from the same and found them excellent. Not only does he teach you all about using the T4i he teaches some great pointers on photography. I highly recommend this product.,1355184000,6,206,4.75
