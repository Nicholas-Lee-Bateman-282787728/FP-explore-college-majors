400650,4,6301972937,"One thing you can say about Roger Corman: he's consistent. ""Consistent"" meaning his films always turn a profit (supposedly). ""Consistent"" also means that a viewer sitting down to a watch a Corman flick will consistently find the film in question larded with enough cheese to clog an elephant's arteries. You will see cheesy acting, cheesy special effects, and cheesy plots. Depending on the type of genre, you'll also find plenty of gory mayhem, beautiful babes, and nudity from the aforementioned beautiful babes. That's Roger Corman in a nutshell. Oh wait, I almost forgot; he's also the biggest ripoff artist in Hollywood history. Any film that has hit the big time in the last forty years invariably sees Roger Corman making a similar flick in an effort to cash in on the more successful offering. For example, when ""Jaws"" hit the jackpot back in the 1970s, Corman followed up with several pictures capitalizing on monsters run amok. When the car movie craze swept America in the late 1970s, Roger quickly jumped aboard by releasing films focusing on cars. ""Star Wars"" saw our man releasing several science fiction films strongly resembling, well, ""Star Wars"". That's Corman for you. Love him or leave him.

""The Nest,"" a 1988 feature from the House of Corman, falls into the category of animals run amok. It's also a throwback to the old monster features of the 1950s and 1960s except this one is in color and loaded with gore effects. If you have any doubts about what I'm saying, take a gander at the cover art for the DVD. A skimpily clad woman locked in life or death combat with a gigantic roach. Kinda says it all, doesn't it? Let's move on. ""The Nest,"" set on some island called North Port, has a big problem. According to the local exterminator, Homer (Stephen Davis), the island suddenly seems awash in roaches. Lots of people are calling him up to come out and deal with the problem. Lots of people are disappearing too, along with family pets. Might the problem have something to do with a superbreed of roaches created by accident when North Port's mayor Elias Johnson (Robert Lansing) approached a big corporation called INTEC about creating a bug that could kill other bugs and then die off before breeding? Might the problem reside with the evil Dr. Morgan Hubbard (Terri Treas), creator of the bugs and a feminist with weird ideas about insect mating?

Yes, yes it could. As it turns out, the insects we're seeing running through the grass (from their POV, I might add, which makes for a few hilarious scenes in a movie full of them) have a taste for human flesh, animal flesh, and the binding that holds together books in the library. 'Tis true, my friends. They also have another disturbing trait: the ability to assume the form of whatever they kill. Yep. Expect to see a few animal/roach hybrids skittering around the island as the movie progresses. Dare we dream to see a human/roach hybrid? Time will tell. Unfortunately, we have to wade through a whole lotta dross about the convoluted three way relationship between town sheriff Richard Tarbell (Frank Luz), his main squeeze Lillian (Nancy Morgan), and the arrival of former girlfriend Elizabeth Johnson (Lisa Langlois). Liz, who also happens to be the mayor's daughter, left the island after a personal tragedy and has now returned to provide the film with the requisite human drama that any good roach run amok movie must have if it wishes to draw an audience. Whatever. Just stick it out through these tedious exercises in ""drama"" and you'll receive a nice, gory payoff in the end.

I hate to sort of reverse myself after bashing Corman in the opening paragraph of the review, but ""The Nest"" isn't that bad of a picture. In fact, it's pretty good. The acting isn't great, the plot is a recycled mess from better movies executed with far more resources than what this movie had to work with, the fashion style of the 1980s goes a bit over the top here, but the film succeeds on several points. One, Terri Treas is pretty hot. So is Lisa Langlois, for that matter. Hot babes always help rather than hurt a cheap flick. Two, the gore is exceptional by b-movie standards. There's a sequence at the end of the film showing a particularly greasy transformation, along with a memorable eyeball gag, that sent me retching for the wastebasket. Not really, but the scene in question is extremely gross. Three, and finally, I liked the conclusion to the film. Again, it's not original whatsoever in the nature gone crazy genre, not anywhere CLOSE to original, but it is fun in a gooey, grotesque sort of way. If you know someone who hates roaches, this is the movie you stick in their stocking at Christmas.

""The Nest"" on disc stays within the perimeters of almost every Roger Corman DVD I've seen: it's cheap. The picture quality isn't too bad so it's disappointing to see that they used a fullscreen transfer. I hate cropped movies! The extras are skimpy, too, which is also keeping with the typical Roger Corman DVD. All we get are some short biographies for a few of the cast, a long panegyric praising Rog himself, and three trailers for ""Humanoids From the Deep,"" ""The Unborn,"" and ""The Terror Within"". Not much to get hyped up about here. Ultimately, I liked the movie enough to give it four stars. Then again, I spend a lot of my free time watching low budget crud like ""The Nest"" because I like cheap movies that try to achieve something they can't possibly reach with a low budget. If you're a similar sort of movie fan, then definitely try to find a copy of this movie. If not, well, I can't really help you. What were you doing reading this review, anyway?",1178668800,21,5640,4.705465587044534
400651,1,6301972937,"I guess I'm one of the hundred or so people who've had the pleasure of viewing this ""cockroach classic""(as Roger Corman puts it). Saw it for the first time probably a decade ago, near the time that I was introduced to the horror genre. With a reasonable script and decent acting, the film's already ahead of the genre curve. Add to that a healthy dose of genuine suspense, a few squirm-inducing scenes, and some surprisingly good special effects during the final act, and you end up with one effective horror flick. This is not high art, but it's not the cheesy exploitation film the DVD's cover implies, either. If you go in expecting a B-movie you won't be disappointed, and you may even be impressed. However, if you go in expecting ""Citizen Kane""...; well, you deserve what you get.
It would be an understatement to say the announcement of this disc caught me by surprise. Thank God for Roger Corman! If it weren't for him, ""The Nest"" probably would've been condemned to VHS for eternity. Sadly, this DVD is not the improvement for which one might hope. In fact, I hesitate to say that it's an improvement at all. Though my VHS copy is long gone and I've no basis for comparison, this DVD is lacking in every category. The packaging claims ""Digitally Remastered"", but from what source?
To start, the picture is noisy more often than not; this is especially apparent in the many darker sequences. Shadow detail is near nonexistent, making those special effects I mentioned very hard to discern. It wouldn't surprise me if this transfer was made from an old composite video master. This just doesn't look like film to me(though I'm no expert). The audio doesn't fare any better. A standard Dolby Digital 2.0 track encoded at 192kb/s, I'm not sure if it's stereo or mono, but it certainly isn't surround. Background hiss is present from beginning to end.
Extras are limited to a trio of trailers for ""Humanoids"", ""The Unborn"", and ""The Terror Within"". The packaging claims ""Original Theatrical Trailer"", but no trailer for ""The Nest"" is included(that I could find). Also included is a brief bio for producer Roger Corman and what amounts to filmography highlights in paragraph form for actors Robert Lansing, Lisa Langlois, Franc Luz, and Terri Treas. A commentary from Roger Corman, director Terence Winkless, and perhaps a member or two of the cast would've been nice.
In the end, all that matters in this purchase decision is whether or not you like the film. If you've never seen ""The Nest"" and it sounds appealing to you, the low price makes it a good candidate for a blind purchase. I recommend it for the strengths of the film. Enjoy!",1030320000,17,2642,4.758169934640523

400770,4,6301972937,"In a small New England island town community, there is a huge roach problem going on including some people missing with dead corpses of both animals and people showing up. Sheriff Richard Tabal (Frank Lulz) is investigating the problem with the help of exterminator Homer (Stephen Davies) as they discover that an evil corporation called INTEC has been doing some genetic tinkering on roaches on trying to create cannibalistic roaches that feed on each other to get rid of the bug problems for the world. However, something goes wrong as they start to feed on meat instead like on humans and animals alike as they start to attack the community as they are immune to insect repellants yet whenever they all feed on living beings and creatures they mutate into animal-roach hybrid creatures or even human-roach hybrid creatues.

10 years before ""Mimic"", this 1988 cult sci-fi horror from Roger Corman productions and produced by Julie Corman is a very entertaining, gory and enjoyable killer insect movie. Sure the acting is typical b-movie but it does have interesting ideas to it like a roach that eats people then transforms into whatever it kills, quite an ingenius idea which was latered borrowed in Guillermo Del Toro's 1997 cult fave ""Mimic"". There are some gruesome kills especially to a cat but don't worry folks, the cat wasn't actually killed as it was just make-up with karo syrup on it to make it look like it was being killed by the roaches and there's a neat transformation of a man turning into a roach hybrid creature. I enjoyed this since i rented it on video at age 7 when it came out and i had it on video for years, if you like killer bug movies check this one out.

Shout Factory has done a terrific blu-ray/DVD combo with pure crisp picture quality and nice sound with only one crucial extra being an audio commentary from the director, but that's ok what matters is that Shout has delivered us again with another great Scream Factory blu-ray that should please videophiles of the horror/sci-fi genres nicely.",1363824000,2,2030,4.780626780626781

400773,4,6301972937,"Not to be confused with the completely dissimilar The Nesting (1981), this is a vermin gone monstrously wrong flick that starts out slow but ultimately does well for itself and gorehound horrorfans.  While you'll never see the scene depicted on the provocative DVD cover, this was a respectable and surprisingly nudity-free Roger Corman flick that really deserves a chance.  After all, Hollywood has only once yielded a better killer cockroach movie (i.e., Mimic).

It's tourist season in a New England fishing town and, just like in Jaws (1975) or Piranha 3D (2010), the people are very concerned about their island community's tourist season revenue.  But Sheriff Tarbell's (Robert Lansing; Empire of the Ants) recent missing person reports are becoming less than routine when roaches start killing people--after they tired of killing rats, cats and dogs, of course.

His old flame who just got back in town, Beth (Lisa Langois), stumbles across a strange research prospectus and, like anyone cast in a cheap horror flick, investigates on her own.  Near the town, she finds an old research site.  Who's research?

Kicked out of MIT for conducting illegal experiments, Dr. Hubbard (Terri Treas) was working on making a roach that would eat other roaches.  I liked her from the start.  She handles an oozy animal corpse like it's no big deal and uses a live cat as ""bait"" in a roach trap--doesn't end well for the cat.  Just like in Humanoids from the Deep (1980), Dr. Hubbard knows far more than she tells the townspeople.  There's always someone who knows but doesn't share the knowledge to save lives...ever since the days of Alien (1979) all the way to Prometheus (2012).

What Hubbard calls a Periplaneta hybrid has a ""remarkable capacity for adaptation.""  They become immune to chemical agents over the span of 15 minutes of running time.  So evacuate, right?  No.  Dr. Hubbard has ""everything completely under control"" and thinks she can do it another way.  These roaches are regular size but can bite through heavy duty rubber gloves, make giant slimy cocoons, and with every generation they evolve into more dangerous, chemically resistant, and intelligent roaches than their progenitors.  These roaches start working together to eliminate their human pests and will even cut off the electricity to do it (which reminds me of the domestic nightmare rat pest from Of Unknown Origin).

All in good fun, these roaches instantaneously delete flesh and body parts on contact and, at one point, a guy sinks into them as if he were sinking in quicksand or, perhaps, a meat grinder.  The fun really starts when we learn that they ""become"" what they eat.  We meet a roach-cat hybrid-thing that looks like a skinned cat with antennae and mandibles leaping about and trying to kill people (reminiscent of The Thing).  And a guy goes through an elaborately gross transformation and is turned into a grotesquely gored up, skinless, roach-human zombie hybrid which, with a strong but much less poetic nod to The Fly (1986), is killed by a shotgun to the head at point blank by a loved one.  The ""queen"" roach is a ridiculously macabre masterpiece of combined human corpses, some mandibles, and I don't even know what else.

I hope that last paragraph sold you.  It sure would have worked on me.  If you enjoy gore then you'd be stupid to skip this delicious flick.

IF YOU LIKED THIS WATCH:  Humanoids from the Deep (1980), Of Unknown Origin (1983), Gnaw: Food of the Gods II (1989), Slugs (1989), Piranha 3D (2010), The Thing (2011).

SCIENTIFIC SIDEBAR:  A few pieces of nonsense to dismiss.  1) This movie features many unrelated genera (and, by extension, species) of cockroach--Periplaneta (Blattidae), Gromphadorrhina, Blaberus (Blaberidae).  2) The town's entomologist diagnoses oothecae (roach egg cases) as roach droppings even though the producers used real handfuls of oothecae as props.  3) Roaches do not have queens.  4) If a roach eats a cat and then lays eggs, I am almost certain that it will take longer than overnight before a mandibled, skinless, roach-cat hybrid-thing attacks you.",1345161600,12,4097,5.010355029585799
400774,4,6301972937,This movie brought back tearful memories of my childhood. Back when we lived in a roach infested project building in Jersey City N.J. (Thank god I don't live there anymore!)

400775,5,6301972937,"Tame, by anyone's standards, The Nest was exactly what I expected so I wasn't disappointed.  It's fifth rate but I loved it.  Really, killer cockroaches, how can you go wrong?  And the fact that they later ""made"" something of themselves is priceless.  I know it's riddled with clichs throughout but in this type of film you count on that.  The dialog is corny, the story filled with great lapses in logic, the solution strictly rudimentary, the acting barely adequate (although Robert Lansing, the only BIG name star slumming in this feature, had one moment that was rather unexpected in its authenticity), plus a pervasion low budget feel that is inescapable (there's supposed to be an entire town filled with people but you never see it or the people, just parts and a few...diehards).  Some not so shocking shocks and an incredible performance by Terri Treas as the mad scientist (she easily stole the movie from the bugs), makes this one a definite keeper!

400776,4,6301972937,"This is a fun little horror movie, from Roger Corman,and is about what you would expect. Science mixed with bugs goes horribly wrong! It all takes place on an island, and has the usual cast of characters. Crazy old Coot, Struggling waitress, bad guy in the big house, and our hero police Chief. One thing that stood out to me was the groovy 80's fashions that the lead lady wore. An acid washed jumpsuit with black high top sneakers with red laces. I can remember girls in my High School wearing pretty much the same thing. Some people will say, OH that is so dated, but I like remembering the way it used to be. Just like films from the seventies. It's like getting a time machine glimpse into the past. As far as scares, well there really aren't any. You can hear the roaches clicking and chirping a mile away. There are a few good gore scenes, if you like that stuff. There is a close up of a dudes eyeball falling out of it's socket, which was nasty, but the girl witnessing this didn't even scream, she just sort of makes these little frightened sounds. If I even see a mouse run across the floor, I'm screaming. These people in horror movies have some serious backbones!!! The lady scientist that shows up on the island and who is really behind the killer roaches, looked alot like a young Delta Burke, and really was not convincing as a person of science. There was no nudity that I remember, which surprised me, considering this was from the same bunch that brought us Humanoids from the Deep. This is worth watching, because it moves along pretty well, with lots of good scenes, and has a nasty monster at the very end.

7819012,4,6301972937,"Director Terence H. Winkless (from Illinois originally, not born and raised in the land of celluloid) guides this roach-infested monster flick under the banner of Roger Corman's company, who saved what was (seemingly) an already flailing project. Initially started before Winkless came aboard the production (Winkless discusses, on his very informative audio commentary track, how he got chosen as the director--basically because no one else really desired to make a picture about cockroaches!), Corman eventually put Winkless under contract, and managed to get the lovely and gorgeous Lisa Langlois to come aboard (I didn't even realize she was in this picture until after I ordered it, but I was pleasantly surprised--jackpot!). This is a standard, let's experiment with the cockroaches on an abandoned island type of story, but overall the picture is a lot of fun to watch. There are some creative gore effects, not too much profanity, and some really humorous moments (and outrageously misplaced dialogue). Winkless mentions that the movie was inspired by ""The Fly""--and one scene in particular is purely derivative of that earlier film. But other than that, the cat-roach creature, and the final monstrosity that appears near the climax, is worth the price of admission alone. The real reason to purchase this neat little Blu-Ray/DVD reissue of THE NEST is to listen to the director's commentary. He mentions that the production basically included his friends and some family members (probably any director's preferred way of casting!), and that, if cell phones had been around so prevalently in these older days, Winkless wouldn't have gotten the job because some top brass at the company never officially approved of him to direct at all! But we must not dwell upon the wonderful old days of loose and independent free market filmmaking, else we might wind up getting depressed. And THE NEST, despite a few animals in distress moments, is not a joyless picture at all. It is clichd at times, and it basically follows a kind of outdoor adventure scenario (with many interior scenes kept brief), but overall it is a worthwhile B-movie. Especially when we start to get more creatures after the rather lugubrious first half.
Somewhat tragically, Scream Factory neglected to track down and include an audio (or even video) interview with the author of the original source novel, Eli Cantor (1913-2006) (who published fiction under the pseudonym Gregory A. Douglas), a cultural item that would have been worth something to us nerds. Cantor was a successful businessman, a composer (one of his string quartets was choreographed by the Sarasota Ballet of Florida, and later performed), a writer, and even an artist/sculptor. His early short stories also won acclaim by literary folks, and his interest in journalism even led him into a career as a fiction editor at a major magazine. According to Cantor's daughter, the man was pleased with this movie (though it didn't really follow his novel very closely), and it's a shame that we didn't get his thoughts about his work being adapted for film. Winkless doesn't bother mentioning the source novel on his audio commentary track, but really the project had become a movie before he signed on to direct it so I don't blame him for not talking about a field that isn't his own in the first place (i.e., the buying of source novels for film projects). In addition, I think a new interview from Corman would have been nice to see as well, but, sadly, THE NEST has come up short in terms of extras. But Winkless provides a tremendously informative audio commentary track, if you are interested in film studies. The director mentions everybody from the continuity writer to the editor to the Corman connection, and it's all detailed verbally in this wonderful extra. If you are wondering how directors work in this business, this commentary track goes a long way towards explaining how the hiring and firing process works for independent movies, and a reliable bean field hand like Winkless really does know his stuff (Winkless mentions that people who watch this kind of movie ""don't care whether or not the cat gets killed""...uh, I have to take umbrage with that comment! But this is a genre picture, so we all know what to expect, after all.) Other than that, the picture has great sound and a pretty decent picture transfer overall. If you like this kind of thing, what are you waiting for? Upgrade! B+ (for the whole thing)",1486771200,2,4471,5.010752688172043

A small island is overrun by mutated cockroaches thanks to some genetic experimentation by the local chemical company. It's up to the island's sheriff and exterminator to stop the menace before these flesh-eating insects reach the mainland.

""The Nest"" is a film which feels about 10 years too late. Arriving in 1988, ""The Nest"" feels like it should have come out in the late 70's with other classic nature-gone-crazy films like ""Kingdom of the Spiders"", ""Squirm"" or ""Frogs"". The big advantage ""The Nest"" has over those earlier films, is the advances in monster and gore F/X. While not top of line, the F/X here are fun to look at, and the ""creature"" designs are a blast.
