7466145,5,B016APPT6S,"Last of the Summer Wine is my all time favorite British comedy.  I have every season that has been made available through BBC America.  I have seen each season several times over the years.  It really did make me sad to see this series come to an end.  However, try as they might, the characters that they were very fortunate to find over the years can no longer be replaced.  I guess that it is very true that all great things must come to an end.",1457049600,5,448,4.162790697674419

7466149,5,B016APPT6S,"This is an amazing series that had run for over 30 years and entertained everyone including the queen.  There are only
a handful left of the original cast but they all come alive on these dvd's and bring hours of entertainment, laughter and
insight to a simpler time and caring neighbors.  A must for the brit-com collector.",1454112000,7,324,4.666666666666667
7466150,5,B016APPT6S,"I love every single one of the series of Last of the Summer Wine. Yes, it's hard to see so many of them getting older, and knowing so many has passed but the ones that are still there are going strong and make me laugh so much. This is one of the best series that I have and I will always treasure it. Be prepared to laugh at the new troubles the gang gets into in this 2006 series :-)",1453852800,12,385,3.825
