7967159,5,B00006CXHG,"It is definitely an awesome collection, to say the least, but wound up being too much for me to watch, so after watching all I thought I would, I gave it to a long time email friend that came to visit me  this past week. We have been email friend for a mere 27 Years and had never actually met in person before. She was overwhelmed as she and her husband has just spent $72.00 Each to visit all of Elvis's home in Memphis.  If you can sit and watch that many dvds, go for it. I wound up getting a 4 dvd set, and it works better for me personally. We will Always Love and Miss The King!!",1411776000,,586,3.9159663865546217
7967160,5,B00006CXHG,"I just got this for Christmas from my mother-in-law.  I really, really liked this DVD set.  I am a big Elvis fan and have watched a lot of documentaries on him.  A lot of sets keep re-using the same clip over and over which always makes me crazy.  This set did not do that. It had a lot of information and was well thought out and put together.  If you are looking for something on Elvis this is the set for you you will really enjoy it.  I know i did and even my 12 year old learned about Elvis and liked it.",1326153600,,509,3.8932038834951457
7967161,5,B00006CXHG,BUY IT NOW!  Chock full of stuff I have never even heard about and I thought I knew it all.  Recent interviews with Charlie Hodge and Joe Espisito as well as those people you have only ever read about and never seen.,1031616000,3,216,4.119047619047619
7967162,5,B00006CXHG,"I have seen many ""biographical"" videos, etc. of Elvis but none of them have compared to this 8-DVD set. Each DVD has almost 2 hours of ""in depth"" information about Elvis. That's close to 16 hours!! I did not find one derogatory remark in the 16 hours. The interviews are amazing; featuring those with Elvis' earliest friends including - Dixie Locke. There is a lot of footage that has never been seen before. This is a must-have for any Elvis fan. You won't be dissapointed.",1030838400,4,474,4.588235294117647
7967163,5,B00006CXHG,"IF YOU WANT A COMPLETE STORY OF ELVIS, THEN THIS IS THE PACAKAGE YOU WANT. IT COVERS EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO KNOW. ALL ASPECTS OF ELVIS' LIFE ARE IN THIS SET. OF ALL THE TAPES AND DVD'S I HAVE ON ELVIS, THIS SET IS BY FAR MY FAVORITE.",1030492800,,233,3.875
7967164,5,B00006CXHG,"I love this silver box set!! If I could give it 6 stars I would!!! I have loved Elvis since I was a little girl,my mom is a fan too and she started me. What I like about this series is that it is a video book,a biography you can see with friends and coworkers who REALLY knew the REAL ELVIS!!
It's not some critic who doesn't understand or appreciate his music. I wish I could have been around when Elvis was here. In a way I can through the people who loved him,there are storeies and foootage I have never heard or seen before. I bet this will be a heirloom to hand down through generations. I watch them a lot,when i feel blue I play a Elvis record or movie. Now I have 16 new hours to choose from!!!
It truly is as people have said a beautiful MASTERPIECE!! A nice addition to any Elvis fan's library...
TLC,
Francesca
P.S. I like Joe Esposito:His Best Friend Remembers too,he did a good job,but it's only 2 hours and it's a great companion to The Definitive Elvis!!! Joe worked on The Definitive Elvis too...",1029196800,11,1013,4.22680412371134
7967165,5,B00006CXHG,"UH HUH I""M ALL SHOOK UP!
