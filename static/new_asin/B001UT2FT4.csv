8345022,5,B001UT2FT4,"The love of her father's eye and custodian of the Kennedy name, founder of the Profiles In Courage Awards, advisor to the Harvard Institute, author and mother to three children, Caroline Kennedy embodies what her parents held and continues to be a scion of the best loved family in America's history.

Caroline was born into a time when America was consumed by the Kennedy family, and attained the role of 'Darling of the White House' when she upstaged her father at press gatherings. Her and John Jr. was always in the limelight, even in the White House, as it became their home.

Caroline's second brother, Patrick, died two days after being born in 1963, and tried to made her parents feel better by going to the hospital with her father, taking flowers to her mother and being a comfort to her. Caroline once said that the only time she saw her father cry was when Patrick died.

In November 1963, her parents were off to Dallas, and along with her nanny she saw them for the last time.

With the assassination of her father, Camelot came to an end as the world viewed history unfolding. The thought of his death was the furthest from people's minds, until they saw the event unwind in front of their eyes.

Caroline was in a car heading to a friend's place when she accidentally heard of the shooting. No one wanted to tell her as she was still emotional about Pactrick's death. At her father's funeral, America's heart stopped for a few seconds as her small hand reached up to touch her father's coffin, and to say goodbye to him.

Her uncle, Bobby, became her father and cemented their love for each other. Another tragedy was to unfold before her eyes as Robert was assassinated.

In 1975 she graduated from high school, and after a year in England, she returned to New York, and in 1980 with a degree in Fine Arts, went to work in the film department of the Metropolitan Museum of Arts.

Meeting Edwin Schlossburg, they began dating. He was a private person, loved Caroline and did not care about her last name.

At their wedding rehearsals John Jr. said, ""For the longest time we have been three, and now we are four. I welcome my brother to our family."" On July 19, 1986, Edwin was welcomed into the family at a small wedding, and the American people were happy.

To Caroline her family was more important than long hours as a lawyer, so she turned to writing and wrote two books about civil liberty, which became best sellers.

In early 1994, yet another tragedy hit Caroline as her mother, Jackie, developed cancer and died May 19, at the age of 64. Her death shook her faith, American's nation and the world as they heard of her death.

Then, on July 17, 1999, Caroline spoke to her brother, John Jr., only hours before he took off in his plane with his wife and her sister. They were reported as being late, and at four o'clock that morning, it was confirmed he had crashed. July 22, her fears were confirmed.

She was now the only survivor of Camelot, and it was up to her to keep the link alive, and devotes most of her time to keeping the legacy of her father, her mother and family alive, while living her own life.

There is a strength in Caroline that is displayed in all of the Kennedy family. A strength to prevail over tragedy after tragedy, which would be harder for her as she is expected to keep the legacy, and name, alive.

I give this dvd five stars and recommend it to those who wish to learn about the last ray of hope, that was Camelot.",1372896000,,3469,4.4495268138801265
