8597734,5,B00DTXJRC2,"Perry Stone, Manna-fest host, teacher and conference preacher,  mesmerizes with a torrential delivery of facts Biblical as well as extra-Biblical to bring the Bible student into a marvelously fresh end-times overview that imports refinements to eschatological interpretation of many currently held positions.

Embarking on his exponential considerations of the reality of Noah and the world-wide flood, as expertly and massively defended by Answers in Genesis Founder Ken Ham, Stone elucidates at breakneck speed a stream of scholastic references garnered from Genesis, Isaiah as well as all points of the Tanakh and Brit Chadashah, tossing in enlightening and galvanizing perspectives from the Books of Enoch and Jasher for good measure.

Submitted in a two-part offering, Noah's Code convincingly impacts the viewer with the astounding conclusion that we in this world have entered the days of Noah prophesied by Jesus 2,000 years ago.

'TNC' supplies ample fodder for the detail-hungry eschatologist, with loads of revelations for the audience newcomers.

Stone's time study conclusion may be considerably accelerated by subtracting his inclusion of the Gap theory, clarifying Noah's flood prophecies and manifesting an impressively closer 'In the beginning...'  At which point this world's history is reduced to a mere afterthought!
