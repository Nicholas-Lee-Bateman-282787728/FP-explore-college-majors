1379555,5,B00004Z1FL,"This is one great film and the opening scenes are ones that you will never forget! Russell looks very handsome and the story is a good one, but heartbreaking. I would recommend this film to anyone who loves Russell Crowe and his brillant acting! Grace",992995200,4,251,4.6
1379556,5,B00004Z1FL,Hammers Over the Anvil is one of those few films that has many of the complexities of life blended together in a way that some part of it will touch the viewer. Life is seen through the eyes of a young boy who does not judge. Instead he can enter each character's intermost being and know their thoughts and feelings. The film won Best Actor for Russell Crowe at the Seattle International Film Festival and the Young Actor's Award for Alexander Outhred at the Australian Film Institute.,990576000,9,486,4.597701149425287
1379557,5,B00004Z1FL,"Russell Crowe has to be one of the best actors around.  He is versatile, believeable, and the ""Everyman"" most of us can identify with on some level.  Of course the fact that he's got a great body and reminds me of a boy I was crazy about in high school has nothing to do with my judgement of his acting abilities.
Seriously, the actors and the director of this film should be commended.  In my book, HAMMERS OVER THE ANVIL ranks right up there with ANGEL AT MY TABLE (Kerry Fox) and MY BRILLIANT CAREER (Judy Davis). All these films are set in Austrailia and New Zealand, directed by women, and about a young person's coming of age.  All three of the young protagonists grow up to become writers and the stories are autobiographical.
If you appreciated the cinematograpy in Campion's ANGEL AT MY TABLE and you love the Australian countryside you will marvel at scenes shot in the dewy mists of morning, the blazing noon day sun and by moonlight. The DVD is very clear and the frames are  well articulated. The Australian Film Board sponsored the film so it's a work of art.
HAMMERS OVER THE ANVIL is set in 1910--before WWI. As I watched the film I felt I was observing a lost way of life. Even 50 years ago in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the U.S. agricultural communities still existed and blacksmiths were relatively common (hammers and anvils).
HAMMERS a slice of life, and more. A dramatic series of events unfolds. I won't reveal the ending, but say it did not end the way I thought it would. This film was directed by a woman and contains a strong female lead. Most women I know will appreciate the story. Charlotte Rampling is wonderful and I could totally identify with her in this role (whereas I could not when she played Ms. Haversham in GREAT EXPECTATIONS).  She is an excellent actress and her relationship with East (Crowe) was entirely believeable.  It may be HAMMERS OVER THE ANVIL is the story of a boy's coming of age, but the women and girls in this film create a real presence.  A keeper.",984182400,42,2015,4.516483516483516
1379558,4,B00004Z1FL,"I am glad I bought this DVD.  Being a fan of Russell's for 2 years now I had only seen a cut version on a cable channel.  Not the best thing ever put to film, but it good.  Did not need the nudity.",982454400,2,197,3.5348837209302326
1379559,4,B00004Z1FL,"Though I truly enjoyed this film, particularly the characters portrayed in it, I found myself wishing that the director had taken more advantage of the third-person perspective that film allows.  While director Ann Turner retains the first-person point of view of the stories written by Alan Marshall, I felt that a little broadening of the viewpoint might have helped the development of this film.  A couple of the scenes and characters were left largely undeveloped, making me wonder why they were left in at all, other than the fact that these were some of the people in the town.
Despite the need for some expansion, this is a truly charming film.  The actors do a wonderful job with material that could be considered somewhat controversial without ever making the audience feel uncomfortable.  Scenes that could be embarassing to watch are instead handled with such grace that the viewer is allowed to stay emotionally connected with the film.",979430400,8,948,5.019108280254777
1379560,4,B00004Z1FL,"Beautiful, passionate rites of passage film. Ann Turner, the director, chose her actors well. Charlotte Rampling's cool femininity and Russell Crowe's intense masculinity created a special chemistry on screen. Ann Turner had some very delicate scenes to direct and used a subtle and artful touch. The opening scene was glorious and a joy to see an actor (or anyone) so comfortable in their own skin.
The young boy who played Alan Marshall (Alexander Outhred) was absolutely wonderful. There was a magical, childlike wonder and innocence about the love scene between East & Grace that Alan witnesses and another reason why this film is so good. The whole cast was exceptional. I don't want to spoil this for anyone. I'll just say this could become one of my favorite films.",970444800,10,772,4.992248062015504
1379561,4,B00004Z1FL,"Ann Turner's ""Hammers Over The Anvil"" is a delightful coming of age story set in small town Australia and depicts Australian country life during the early 20th Century (1910). We watch as a young boy grows into a young man while sharing his unique perspective on life and those around him. The young man, who is crippled and uses braces and crutches to get around, shares his thoughts via narration and his life as we are guided through his world as his experiences it. By the end of the story, we gain knowledge of the inner boy, his friendships, family connections, loves, losses, and amazing ability to see past the socially acceptable conclusions toward the true meaning of many human behaviors.
The wonderful cast brings a rich fullness to each and every scene. The cast members speak with heavy Australian accents which will necessitate careful listening on most non-Australian viewers parts. Many viewers will rent/buy this film to see a wonderful early performance by a then up and coming Australian actor, Russell Crowe. Mr Crowe does not disappoint his fans and delivers a quality performance as he depicts one of the film's most likable characters. To the viewer's delight, the film's entire cast delivers performances that meet and, at times, out shine the high level performance of Mr Crowe.
""Hammers Over The Anvil"" presents material which is at times adult in nature, but does so in a respectful and tasteful manner. The scenes which project this material are necessary to successfully depict the plot and its full meaning to the movie's viewers. I enjoyed this movie and know many of you will too.",969753600,47,1613,4.912087912087912

1379563,4,B00004Z1FL,"This is a good and rather bold coming of age story about a preteen boy in Australia, circa 1910, and his adoration of a horse trainer played by Russell Crowe.  The trainer and a married woman fall in love, while the boy clashes with his father and best friend and tries to understand adult behavior.  There is a scene of Crowe naked in a lake with his horses, the boy and his friend pleasuring themselves in a field, and two scenes of lovemaking, so do not let the kiddos watch!

1379564,5,B00004Z1FL,The movie was AWESOME!  The story line was just so sweet and tender.  The story is told through the eyes of a young boy (maybe 14 or so)  coming into his own and loving it.  Russell on a horse butt naked ain't too bad either.....  and I love westerns- so it meets many likes and different kinds of people.  everyone I have shown it to just loves it.,1324857600,3,349,4.0588235294117645
1379565,4,B00004Z1FL,"This movies was one of Russell Crowes best movies, probably next after Beautiful Mind.  The scenery and the horses were very Australian and he was brilliant as usual.",1289347200,,166,4.928571428571429
1379566,5,B00004Z1FL,"To me there is even more symbolism in the use of extremes the ultimate freedom [before the anvil is hammered] and the end [after the hammer falls]. The events that occur during the ""hammering"" process are shown as the film progresses. I just saw this movie in a gift subscription to Netflix and now plan to buy it. Ann Turner's tasteful handling of East's ride should override the condemnation of nudity that seems to pervade many of the comments I've read here. Like any healthy Russell Crowe fan, I marveled at his physical magnificence(FYI I knew nothing of a nude scene until I viewed the film)--but it was his character East's intensity and naivete, his elemental self that  deeply affected me. Yet, in contrast with the blacksmith's brutal taking of young girls, East was tender in loving Grace. It's a shame some people are so sadly taught, practically from birth, that sex is dirty and nudity is something to be ashamed of.  How did THEY get here anyway--via the stork? The threat of heaven and hellfire and brimstone was hammered into them as children and resulted in their becoming dogmatic adults.

Freedom is also shown in the way Allan, though stricken with polio, and his fellow youths interact.  His father's efforts to make a horseman of him and Allan's herculean efforts are excruciatingly painful yet you keep rooting for the kid. The father doesn't force this on him, but the boy wants to be a horseman.  Yet he hops about free in his own way, casually bantering and not looked down upon by the other boys. He is picked up and danced with by some taller girls and he gets to kiss girls, pull stunts, and ride in front of East, his hero.

Charlotte Rampling (one of my favorites of all time) plays Grace, an aristocratic lady and a true woman. With an unconventional, angular beauty and understated words, and an underlying sensuality, she (Rampling herself) has the look of eagles. We see in the multifaceted lady her most tender side when she first rides up to the boy, Allan, to whom she introduces herself as ""GraceShe has superb riding ability, horse bargaining savvy, and a deep need, and therefore, a capacity for love. But her generosity of spirit is shown most strongly in her relationship with the smitten young confidante Allan, her innate understanding and tender treatment of him, respectful of his dilemma as a young man coming of age, and his heroic act shows us the stuff of heroes. And ultimately Grace, even more than his role model East, shows Allan the stuff of heroes.

This film won Russell Crowe an Australian award and he richly deserves it. The understated dialogue the true-to-life characters fascinated me. Young Alexander deserved an award, as well.",1265068800,3,2695,4.7827956989247316

1379570,4,B00004Z1FL,"As you may know by reading most of my reviews, I love Russell Crowe and feel he is the best actor to grace the big screen, ever.  That aside, this was a decent film.  I feel that this is the type of film you either love or you hate, and I really think you need to relate to the film to appreciate it.  Growing up I had no older brothers to look up to but I always long for someone like East, and for a while I had that someone.  The young boy in this movie wants to be around East (Crowe) at all times, helping him on his ranch just to be around him, and he even goes as far as to become somewhat of a pest, always there even when unwanted.  I know what thats like.  I particularly like the opening sequence when Crowe is skinny dipping and the boy is just watching him, talking about how there are gods amoung men or something like that (can't remember exactly what he says) but what I like is the fact that this shows the pure admiration in this boys eyes...East is perfect, even just to watch.  I remember when I admired my friend I bugged the crap out of him.  We're cool now (I'm older and have my own life, but at the time...I was a bit of a nuesence)  That's besides the point.  I loved this movie becasue it helped me see what I was going through.  It helped me understand what my friends were feeling.  That and Crowe is just amazing here.  He is captivating and makes this film as great as it is.  The quality of the film is poor, but the message it brings is worth it.  If you've felt similierly at any point in your life, try this movie, you may find it's just what you need to see.",1118275200,7,1594,4.015873015873016
1379571,2,B00004Z1FL,"Polio-stricken youngster Alan Marshall (Alexander Outhred) hero-worships the local horseman and blacksmith, East Driscoll (Russell Crowe) in the early 1900s in the Australian Outback. When East has an illicit affair with a married woman (Charlotte Rampling), Alan has a hard time reconciling his admiration of the man with his distaste for his actions. Horses are only a backdrop, but there are some nicely done equestrian and wildlife scenes. Based on the memoirs of Alan Marshall.

1379573,4,B00004Z1FL,"First I must saw that Russell Crowe MAKES any movie that he takes on and he becomes the charactor, making the movie not only believable, but real.  In this film Russell takes on the role of a man who is everything in the eyes of a young boy and also in the eyes of a married woman.  I feel like I can relate to this story.  As a young boy growing up with no older brothers I longed for the companionship of men like East, and now that I'm older, married and may be having a kid on the way I realize that it's only because of my best friends like Larry, Joe, Walter and Bill that I am the person I am.  Other than the fact that the filming is kinda rough I think the film is perfect.",1086825600,4,682,3.884892086330935
1379574,4,B00004Z1FL,"This is an excellent movie.  All the actors do a superb job.
Set in the late 1890's or early 1900's in Australian horse and cattle country, the story unfolds through the eyes of a young, crippled boy. His hero is East (they pronounce it ""Ace"") acted by Russell Crowe. East is a horse breaker (wrangler??)and owns a string of well-bred horses. The young wife of an elderly, wealthy Australian(English) land- owner wishes to breed a mare with one of East's stallions. From this a  romance ensues.  Charlotte Rampling is the upper class English wife, who falls, temporarily, for the illiterate East. Russell is superb riding his horses........... and one tremendously romantic scene has him galloping up to Charlotte as she rides, he sweeps her off her horse and they ride off laughing!!
This is close to a 5 star movie!!",1047600000,7,818,4.828571428571428
1379575,1,B00004Z1FL,"Compare this movie to early Mel Gibson works such as Gallipoli and Tim; there is no comparison! Aside from the views of their naked rear ends; that is.
Probably the first give away was the co-production with the South Australian Film Board or whatever.  South Australia is obviously trying to benefit from the fame of Russell Crowe.  Just like Australian Broadcasting Corporation and Mel Gibson.
Sure, the scenery is great (but the location is obviously a single set, in rural South Australia.  No faults there.  Though where was the river he bathed his horses in?
Some actors overacted to spoil their mediocre performances. Local characters trying to become noticed - no doubt.
Having grown up in a rural (British) colonial village in the 1950s and having done research into the same place at the turn of the twentieth century; I was disappointed at the setting.  Stone buildings belonged to the rich; everyone else built in  wood(hence the denuded landscapes).  It was obvious the set was a single establishment (probably a sheep run); though they tried to make it seem like an entire village.  A pastor; though no visible church.  The center of any colonial community.
How many shots of a nearly invisible night rider can one watch before it becomes dull (one, two?).
There was enough sexual scandal for an entire state; never mind a single village.  Sure there was enough surreptious sex in these villages; but there was more than one location for this.  More often it happened in creek beds or other natural locations - forget the dust and prickliness of a barn.
I was interested to read, that this was a collection of short stories - I have no doubt they are a better attempt at a portrayal of the story than the film.",1041206400,,1724,4.771043771043771

1379577,5,B00004Z1FL,"I was pleasantly surprised recently to discover a gem in the foreign movie circuit I had previously never even heard of before.  Hammers over the Anvil is a beautifully told story of awakening adolescence, love, regret and hope. Told through the narration of an adolescent and handicapped boy, the story is really about an ensemble of characters in an Australian town and their relationships with one another. Due mostly to the talented cast of actors in this film as well as the superb writing and direction, Hammers over the Anvil does something few two hour movies achieve - and that is compassion for all of the characters no matter how deceptively small a part each character plays.  Russell Crowe proves once again that he was a very fine actor way before fame came his way and an equally talented cast of actors only adds to his performance.  This is really the only film I've seen Crowe in where his leading lady brings in as strong a performance as he does.  The result is truly one of those great movie romances that makes you wish for more.  The scenery is breathtaking, the performances magnificent, the story beautifully written...this is one that I would buy for my personal collection to see again and again!",1026259200,16,1223,4.75

1379579,5,B00004Z1FL,"This movie just blows me away each time I watch it. Visually, the scenery is expansive, wild and unspoiled. The characters are ""real people"", natural, believable, and appealing in their own ways. The story meanders from one relationship to another, all of which center around the young disabled boy who narrates in retrospect, having become a successful writer.
At times there is almost a voyeuristic feel, as Alan observes and becomes aware of his own sexuality, and that of those he cares for. He shows the awkwardness and uncertainty of one in the throes of his first crush, and looks to his older and much admired friend East, for clues.
East is everything Alan believes he is not- confident, wild, masterful with horses, physically strong, lusted after by women, and involved with Grace, an attractive older married woman Alan fantasizes about. He is drawn into the relationship between Grace and East, first as a mutual friend, then as confidant in order to keep the affair quiet, and finally as a go-between when life choices must be made. He comes to realize that East is just as much at a loss emotionally, as he himself is physically. They both want things which in reality are unattainable, and refuse to accept the fact.
Dwelling on the ""hunk"" factor sells this film short. The performances of the leads are beyond fine. So much is conveyed visually, with expressions, movements, and gestures, the words are secondary. I was left with an ache in my heart, my toes tingling and really wanting a cigarette when it was all over.",1005609600,10,1537,4.825757575757576
1379580,4,B00004Z1FL,"I purchased this not even knowing much about it. I am a big fan of Russell Crowe and have found most of his films, whether the film itself is good or not, he brings a certain life and charisma to each of his roles. This is one of his earlier films and certainly bears worth seeing. He won a best actor award for the role as well. You will have to view it with a certain appreciation and an open mind. The opening scene may shock you just alittle but it also expresses the carefreeness of his character, East Driscoll,so I can see how it was necessary to the storyline. I enjoyed the film very much...while it doesn't compare to some of his later films is nonetheless a delightful earlier film although, don't read if you haven't seen, it ends quite sadly. Crowe is wonderful as usual and it is neat to see some of his earlier work before he became such a big star.

The dialogue was so garbled that you practically need subtitles to understand the words. The plot never really delved into the characters, it just glossed over them as if it were a tale for slow witted children. If you are expecting the usual Crowe charm, there is none at all!

7927888,4,B00004Z1FL,"This is a coming-of-age story told about and from the point of view of Alan Marshall, a young man who needs crutches as well as leg braces to walk. It is also often narrated by him. The plot covers several aspects of the Alan's life. His relationship with his father; his idle worship of a local horse trainer; his infatuation with a local aristocratic English lady; and his struggles to fit-in (or keep up with) the other children his age.
Life is a struggle for him: his mother is dead; he thinks his father is a coward; he can't run with his friends; he can't mount a horse; an elderly friend dies; and possibly worst of all, he learns that the horse trainer he idolizes is having an affair with the English lady with whom the boy himself is in love.
The movie is well written, well directed, well acted, and easy to follow. The fast moving plot keeps things interesting. Even when the you see the error of the Alan's view, you can also understand why he sees thing as he does, and can sympathies with him. There are humorous parts in the movie, but it is still a serious drama.
The movie begins with the horse trainer East Driscoll skinny dipping followed by nude horseback riding. Alan is watching (and narrating) from not far away. It is around a minute and a half sequence where East is often seen clearly from the rear, but not clearly from the front. A little ways into the film Alan and his best friend Joe watch a man and woman having sex in a barn. The couple are still wearing enough clothing to prevent any nudity from being seen but the actions are clearly seen. Following this the two boys go out to a pasture and lie in the high grass and masturbate. The part of the boys seen above the grass (about the waist up) are fully clothed but what they are doing is quit clear. Later in the movie Alan watches East and Grace having sex. Both are fully nude but while seen fully nude they are some what silhouetted. The sequence is a little over a minute and a half but the full nudity is only seen for the first few seconds. A rear view of Grace is mainly what is seen here. Most of the sequence is close-ups of East and Grace from the shoulders up, and close-ups of Alan's face. Still later in the film Alan convinces a girl about his age to open her blouse in front of him. He sees her under garments, but the audience sees only enough to know that she has undergarments.
