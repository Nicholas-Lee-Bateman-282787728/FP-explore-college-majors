5312997,5,B009B8YZIK,"I'll be honest, when I first heard that a live-action web-film was in the making, I was a bit skeptical. However, when the official trailer was released I decided to give this project a change.
Never have I ever been this glad to be wrong. The movie boasts strong performances from its main actors, Tom Green and Anna Popplewell, who play ambitious cadets with tragic back stories. Never has a web-film seen such quality story telling. With a small budget of $10 million, 343 Studios delivers the movie fans have been begging for. Even if you aren't a fan of Halo, I guarantee you'll be blown away by this mini-masterpiece.",1350950400,3,623,4.672727272727273
5312998,5,B009B8YZIK,"I am a HUGE Halo nerd, but was never really a fan of the live action Halo productions before.  I went into this with somewhat low expectations and was blown away.  Many parts, especially the opening sequences between the Chief and Cortana, gave me chills.  Possibly even a tear or two came to my eye.

There are a lot of little nods and references to Halo backstory for nerds like me who have read all the books (multiple times), played all the games (even more times) and know way too much about Halo in general.  That being said, it is also very accessible for newcomers.

Buy this or suffer the consequences of not knowing what awesome is!!!",1350950400,170,644,4.461538461538462
5312999,5,B009B8YZIK,"I have played the games sure, but just enough to get through the campaign.  This is a must see if you're a fan of sci fi.  Because it's darn good sci fi no matter what it's connected to.

Nuff said.",1350864000,107,198,3.9
5313000,5,B009B8YZIK,"By far this is the best Halo live action vid produced by far. However, I'd go so far as to say it's the best Sci-Fi mini series ever produced. With special effects on par with TV and even movie quality, you won't be disappointed. The acting is strong and believable. There's just enough character development to understand what the major players are about. And then of course there is Master Chief. Daniel Cudmore plays the physical Master Chief and does a masterful performance. Director Stewart Hendler (Sorority Row, Whisper) gets the most from his actors throughout the series. I never felt like anyone was overacting, nor not given their all. A great balance.
Halo fans, do yourselves a HUGE favor and buy this.",1350864000,83,716,4.829268292682927

5313026,3,B009B8YZIK,"Probably a 3.5 star movie. The acting was a bit erratic, and like most video game/book tie-in movies it presumes you know more than you do if you are coming in to it cold. However, for a tie-in movie, it has an amazing amount of character development for the central character. It is not simply an action movie, and if that is what you are expecting rent something else instead. Several people complete about the total lack of information about the enemy aliens. They apparently weren't paying attention. It is there... new curfews, condition red, and the like. They are cadets... that means information is controlled by the the military. Realistically they wouldn't know anything more than they do, until they ""find"" the video of combat feeds.",1478995200,,744,4.866141732283465

5313030,5,B009B8YZIK,"Yes, I am a halo fan but not a huge halo fan and To me this movie is one of my favorites now. It's so detailed, loved the story line and characters, great actors, just great movie overall! I definitely without even thinking would suggest this movie to anyone not just halo fans. You don't even have to be a halo fan to understand or watch this movie. The one thing about this movie that upsets me is how they made Cadet Chyler Silva die at the ending. I feel like the only reason they did that Is to make Cadet Lasky more tougher. But that's just me. Other than that, like I said, Great movie overall.",1473033600,,601,4.145299145299146

5313092,4,B009B8YZIK,"Thomas Lasky is having a very hard time as a freshman officer cadet at the Corbulo Academy of Military Science, struggling to live up to the military reputation of his family, but finding it does not really suit him. However, when the Academy comes under attack, Laskys life goes from bad to downright terrifying! Strange, never before seen aliens are massacring the cadets, and Lasky and his squad have to find a way to survive. Salvation comes in the form of a tall soldier who identifies himself as, Master Chief.

Overall, I found this to be a good video. The first half is a coming-of-age story, which is pretty good. The second half is all suspense and action, with some great references to the Halo games. My only problem with the flick is the characters. All of them are so small and weak looking, and it does appear that virtually all of them had injections to make their lips more puffy-looking.

But, that did not ruin the film for me. I still enjoyed it. I just wish that there was more, much more!",1462320000,,1010,4.5136612021857925

5313094,3,B009B8YZIK,"For those unfamiliar with the video game Halo this movies story line will be confusing. The characters had no background story, like watching episode four in a series and not understanding how everything got to this point. Also, this is another one of those movies where to save on production costs the exterior scenes were shot at night and which makes watching that more difficult. My review, Fair at best.",1459296000,,408,4.8428571428571425

5313164,4,B009B8YZIK,"This was the second of a double feature of Prime movies that I watched on a Saturday night.  I am not a gamer so for me, any reference that others may have for the Halo games doesn't really resonate.  I thought it was a good movie.  Character development was actually decent for this type of genre movie.  I would definitely watch a sequel to it.  I also thought the special effects were competent and well placed throughout the movie.  Sometimes, sci-fi tries to overdo itself and it strays from the acting.

5313332,2,B009B8YZIK,Eh. I watched this movie not expecting much and was validated. I am a big science fiction fan but this was my first exposure to Halo. There was nothing new or original in this movie. Little to no character development - I found it difficult to care or distinguish between any of the recruits.

5313490,4,B009B8YZIK,"Woah. The exposition was a nice tie-in to the time just moments before Halo 4, and tried--and failed--to explain why a certain character in Halo 4 acted the way he did. We then jump to the (unknown time frame) present.

The first act looked like it was filmed on a cardboard soundstage with freshmen actors trying to act like they were in the actual UNSC. I couldn't bring myself to care about any of the characters, even the protagonist.

The second act's complication(s) were unimaginative and cliched. I started wondering why I was wasting my time; I just didn't care about any of the characters. Oh no, the protagonist is questioning his role! Whatever will he do? Nobody likes him! Sigh.

The movie throws in an ""I knew that minor character was going to die the moment they opened their mouth"" moment that was supposed to be horrible and traumatic, but just made me roll my eyes. So then we get to the--surprise!--Covenant invasion...for no reason. The planet in question is supposed to be in the heart of the UNSC's worlds, _and_ it has no strategic value (well, maybe to disrupt the production of human troops, but we've already established that unenhanced humans were basically cannon-fodder in the first three Halo games).

By the third act, the covenant have killed the entire planet except for our protagonist and some of his buddies. Yes, THE ENTIRE PLANET. So having painted themselves into the corner, the inept screenwriter has no choice but to push that button that says ""Do not press"" : Deus ex machina. They went there, hard. And then they tried to take it back, so there'd be ""tension,"" but it was too late. When you press the button, *everything* is fixed. The only thing left is to see how fast the movie can run out the clock. Thankfully, it didn't take very long.",1443139200,2,1786,4.678343949044586

Many of the brought-to-life visuals  entertain me, as they are no longer limited to the graphics in the game. That's not to say that the parts that Consisted of CG graphics were fantastic, but they decent considering this drama might have had a limited budget. Over-all I might assume this movie was attempting to appeal to a general audience, as such few scenes actually adhere to the books, espically the main series of books; a last gripe has to lie on a certain character not having the same voice/voice actor as in other appearances. With the negatives appearing to be numerous on my list these appear to be all the things that unsettle me, while everything else was really enjoyable.

5313675,1,B009B8YZIK,"I decided to watch Halo 4 : Forward Unto Dawn as a way to bond with my husband for his birthday and understand his inner world more. The pros to this movie; Halo 4 Forward Unto Dawn introduces one of the key characters of the film (Masterchief) that explains the films backstory. The film also plays with the idea of what can happen in the future if all military branches joined forces. The cons; The plot at least gave a backstory as to why the recruits at the training academy cared greatly about becoming the top in their jobs. However, the plot did not demonstrate enough on how they were truly going to be ready for what happened. For instance, the responsibility to train the United Bations Space Command candidates (USNC) seemed to fall too much on one person. I have been fortunate to be exposed to multiple work environments where I noticed that there were multiple managers that delegated the objectives of the work assignments. However, in the film the recruits are being trained to basically help save the world and yet the one person tasked to train them seems to not receive much leadership help to ensure a successful outcome (adding more leaders for the training would have strengthened the plot). The film jumps straight to the recruits being exposed to be expected to excel at the academy with not enough plot sequences to show them undergoing training. However, for me at least, watching the film was not a complete waste of time because it enabled me to have some bonding time with my husband on his birthday and understand one of the games that he enjoys. However, I would recommend Halo 4 Forward Unto Dawn more for those who enjoy the Halo game series (such as my husband).",1434585600,,1696,4.637873754152824

5313702,3,B009B8YZIK,This would probably be better to someone familiar with the Halo Universe. As a stand alone presentation it was a bit confusing.  I was taken back by the extreme slaughter.

5313736,3,B009B8YZIK,I was bored 80% of the time in this film and only enjoyed the end. Still it is way better than night fall by far and had way better CGI. But yet Again was miss lead with preview. It shows master cheef and lots of fighting. Did not say 1:30.00 of training camp. What they need to do is make halo 1-5 into a movie. Then o will buy the set.

5313738,5,B009B8YZIK,I was at the edge of my seat the entire movie. I about wet my pants when the invisible guys was taking people out left and right. I was worried weather or not the kids in the story would survive the onslaught. I hope they make a part 2. I those aliens suckers need to have a woopin for all the damage they did. Part 2 is gonna be intense and they got a real good opening up for part 2 if they do decide to do one. But anyways I think the invisible guys are highly over powered. They like Giant Klaynons!,1432166400,,503,3.8932038834951457
5313739,4,B009B8YZIK,Really liked this. Only question is where's the rest of the Halo story.  The depictions of Master Chief and of the Covenant forces are very well done; just wished we could have seen much more of them. Entertaining film on its own terms.,1431907200,,236,4.488372093023256

For something that had such controversy with all the false starts, it was amazing to see a decent end product for the first efforts.  Would have been nice to see some follow on movies or short series.  Oh well, you have to kick out some more HALO variation games into the market.  Follow the money.",1431648000,,476,4.476744186046512

While I agree with some others' criticisms of all the actors being kids, these were academy cadets after all.  That said, I do not feel that an academy is the best introduction to the Halo universe.  I think that only Halo fans looking for more back story would be interested in this.

My son convinced me to watch it with him and boy was I surprised. The acting was pretty good. The special effects were great. They had Elites, Jackals, and Hunters that looked really cool. And Master Chief, very cool, his voice was even right. I really wish they'd make more movies based on the Halo series. The only negative thing I can think of is that they took their time getting to the real action.

5313794,4,B009B8YZIK,It's a movie about a video game. Fun for all of that but not heavy on content. If the Chief is such a super soldier isn't it a problem that his suit has LED lights and he makes mechanical stepping noises every time he moves?

I am a halo fan and this movie captured the story and the characters with quite precision and believability.  I was bouncing up and down in my seat during the later half of the movie during all of the action.  The only thing I didn't like was how different the first half was compared to the latter half.  The plot dragged on in the first half and the character development could have been better, but by the second half there was an intense amount of action, firefights and almost everyone died.  This left me a bit confused as to try to connect the dots throughout the movie, almost like I had watched two entirely different movies.

I happened to be sitting in the room with them and quickly found myself sucked in.  The plot is pretty formulaic, but the acting from the kids is very solid and the production values are so good I didn't know it was a web-based release until I looked it up later (because I was amazed I'd never heard of it).  The best parts of the film are before Master Chief shows up -- after that, it's almost purely an ad for the video game.  But overall, it's a watchable sci-fi/coming-of-age flick with a cast of mostly unknowns of whom I'd like to see more in the future.

5314068,2,B009B8YZIK,"I've played Halo, it was a good game.  As a movie I found it refreshing to see many of the characters returning.  Sadly, the compliments stop there.

Here's the deal... the first 50 minutes can be cut and nothing will be lost.  Let's compare this to Full Metal Jacket... the first half of each movie is boot camp training.  But if you strip out even ten minutes from FMJ you lose a huge portion of character development and zeitgeist dialogue.  You know what I learned from the first 50 min of Forward unto Dawn?  It's that the 'sergeant' chick commands as much authority as a stillborn.  It's a tough call to be rated against R. Lee Ermy but &*#@, call out like you got a pair!  VERY VERY slow opening half.  I actually skipped ahead to 0:50min so not to fall asleep.

The second half is better.  Introducing Master Chief.  But the escort of these useless cadets takes away from something that COULD resemble a Halo 2 campaign.  ""Oh I died""  ""Oh, I'm out of ammo.""  ""Oh, I'm not driving fast enough"".  Never have I wished death upon children more.  I wanted Master Chief to let loose, not protect kids.  And what's the deal with all the slow motion?  Yea, some shots look cool in slow-mo (like the gatling atop the warthog) but it's used so often for so many stupid stunts it loses meaning.

Finally, neat, we get to see Cortana... for all of 5 seconds.  Setting up for a sequel.  A sequel I won't watch.

5314148,3,B009B8YZIK,"As a fan of the Halo series, I naturally enjoyed this movie to some extent. It was a rather interesting look into how the Covenant would appear to your average person, rather than to a fully trained super-soldier. However, I found the beginning of this show lackluster. The main character is a rebellious trainee who routinely causes his squad to fail exercises, which apparently he has always done, due to his inability to follow orders.

[Spoiler] However, all of this, along with the half-assed romance sub-plot, is forgotten when the third act of the movie rolls in and the completely military drama turns into a mindless action movie. This is not to say I have a problem with this, as the drama was rather bland and the intense sequences in this third act somewhat redeem it. The CGI was rather inconsistent in quality and the camera was far too shaky, likely to help hide the CGI, but the action sequences were nevertheless thrilling and made it, in my opinion, worth the watch. [/spoiler]

In conclusion, this movie was one clearly made for people already in love with the Halo franchise, as it would be very confusing to one who doesn't already know the series well. However, if you like Halo already, then this movie is worth considering.",1417651200,,1247,4.741935483870968

Recommending this nifty little movie for those who really like action science fiction movies.  Kids can watch.  There's not much to disturb parents in this one.

Everytime I hear the dramatic music and see John 117 show up on the screen be in either a new game trailer or this feature film I can feel it in the pit of my stomach.

5314266,1,B009B8YZIK,"While it would not have been all that bad had it not been tied to Halo, its that connection that ruins the whole production

 First and foremost its a tiein to Halo 4 which renders the plot of this bizare because it is framed as if it was sort of an origin story of the clash between UNSC and the covenant. That is all well and good had it been for the original game, or even ODST, but considering Halo 4 is post covenant and introducing a new antagonist it should have been tied to that point in its history. It is all down hill from there as it keeps taking  extensive liberies with the lore of the franchise in order to keep its own plot running.

While I do not particuarly like the Halo franchise, I know enough about it to know the main plot and its lore and this production is more of an insult than anything else.

Would have been a solid indie action flick had they had the stones to stick with their own narrative, but intruding on the Halo franchise is like a sticky nade to the head of both.",1414886400,,1003,4.123076923076923

You never see who this man is, just marvel at what he can do. Where the other soldiers were getting their asses kicked, he turns the table on the aliens and gives it back.

It is about kids who are about late High School or early College age who go to a Military Academy to learn how to fight in a war and eventually lead in battle. These kids are the children of the elite in their society. Halfway through the movie the Academy comes under attack from forces unknown.
Can be a little confusing because the storyline can skip from past to present. Some younger children may find this confusing. I would advise that this movie is not suitable for children under 10yrs old.",1412121600,,578,4.361111111111111

I have loved playing HALO on XBOX but to be quite honest never got into the additional backstories, books, etc.  But after reading some of the reviews for this movie decided to give it a watch. I was not disappointed.  Was it a bit cheesy at times? Yes, just a bit.  Was some of the storyline predictable? Yes just a bit.  But was it fun to watch, did it have good special effects, was it a bit of a thrill to see Master Chief in action?  Yes, a whole lot.  Favorite part..

5314438,4,B009B8YZIK,"Four RIVETING Stars! ""Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn"" is a theatrical film by 343 Industries who took over the helm of the billion dollar video game empire that began with the likes of Bungee, Microsoft, Macsoft, and so on. The film is a full uncut version of the TV mini-series which is based on the experiences of Captain Lasky on board his ship ""Infinity"", thinking back to his days as a freshman member of Hastati squad at the UNSC Corbulo Academy of Military Science when, in the midst of training, they have their first experience with a unique, deadly enemy not taught in their cirriculum. After a slowly developing introduction of the squad members, the action and tension picks up with the 'first encounter' and some unique friendly warriors. Whets the appetite for more HALO movies and the upcoming 343 production of HALO5. Directed by Stewart Hendler. Very Definitely Recommended as a franchise product and stand alone Sci Fi.

5314465,5,B009B8YZIK,"For those who are reading the 1-Star reviews and thinking, ""Wow, this must really suck,"" keep in mind that it was not originally a movie, but a small series of multiple episodes that started on YouTube. It wasn't until 2012 that they decided the ratings were good enough to put all the episodes together and make it an actual full-length film. Also, yes, it does take some time for there to be any action. However, how YOU rate a movie all depends on your taste, and for me, there doesn't have to be nonstop action from beginning to end for a movie to be good. I like the backstory, and the action in the last 30 minutes of the movie was awesome. For those who haven't seen it yet, I won't spoil it, but the way Chief comes in is pretty legit.

I must also include the fact that I am a Halo fan. However, I do have friends that have never played the game or read the books and found this movie amusing, anyhow. They too are like me, enjoying the backstory to the movie as much as the action. As I said, it all just depends on your taste in movies. If you're an adrenaline junkie that must have action from beginning to end, then this movie is probably not for you. If you're someone with an interest in romance, there is a little bit in the middle of the movie, but overall it's probably not the movie for you, either. If you're someone that likes action but enjoys a good story just as well, then you may love this movie as much as I did. But don't just take my word for it.

He starts as the typical can't follow orders cadet, wiping his platoon in training time after time. Then his big redemption comes when he again refuses to follow orders from the only guy there who has any combat ability and authority - and does a decoy suicide run - only to have the big guy bail him out anyway and drag his sorry behind back to the evac vehicle.

Definitely generates that chaotic ""what the hell is happening"" feeling that was described in some of the books about the first days of the war with the Covenant. Make me wish they would have never stopped production on the full Halo movie. Few games become even half decent adaptations into movies, but this one captures the feel.

5314521,4,B009B8YZIK,It was interesting to see a perspective of cadets in training from a point prior to knowing about the Covenant. Most of the movie is  the interactions of the cadets however does feature good action with good special effects. While it may be be nice to know some of the history it is not required. The storytelling was good and the overall pace of the movie was good. As a side note I would have to guess that borrowed WETA's Warthog as it could almost be listed as another star in the movie it is seen so often.,1396828800,,511,4.214285714285714

5314528,3,B009B8YZIK,"It takes about 1 full hour, before something happens.
The first hour of the movie, it's boring as s***!

Too long intro, the story is too predictable. You feel like you know what's happening at least 1 minute before it happens on the screen.

The acting is pretty lousy too. I'd give it a 2,5 star out of five, if I could.

The first hour of the movie is like around 2 stars.
The middle-to-end makes up for the other star.

A little in line with the Terminator movies (better), Universal soldier (better than this), and Starship Troopers (the first two are like twice as good as this one).",1396569600,,589,4.376146788990826

Mature content:
This film is non-rated, but PG-13 is a pretty good guess. It contains a good deal of violence, though rather non-gory (some blood but mostly just explosions), a few profanities including the sexual d-word (though not used sexually), and one brief scene with a female cadet wearing only a bra (non-revealing) and a towel.",1396310400,9,564,4.755102040816326

I am pleased to see it show how we soldiers come from many walks of life, and what we least expect (becoming commander of a Star Ship Forward Unto Dawn) is all based on a decision to overcome. All we do to become more than we are, a human being worth living amongst others; is built on hardship and effort. It only takes one moment to change the course of a lifetime; it is the decision to overcome the hardship in that moment and give-forth the effort others tell you is a waste of your time, that makes that moment the life worth living.",1396051200,,657,4.140625

Being a big fan of the Halo franchise (and growing up on the games), it's awesome to see a well-produced piece evolve from the storyline. It's even more impressive to know that this was really just done as a ""marketing"" ploy. For not being a Hollywood production, it's EXTREMELY well produced!

Originally, the piece released in weekly episodes, and they've been pieced together into this combined movie. That alone is a testament to the good direction and creativity of the series, because it all flows perfectly into a movie.

If you love Chief, this movie gives you a further peek into his story, combines the various timelines together, and yet introduces a whole side story in the process. It's another epic testament to the Spartan legacy! ;)",1393977600,,845,4.9020979020979025

5314546,4,B009B8YZIK,"I decided to rent this upon watching a view segments of the film on youtube. The progression of the plot and cinematography doesn't feel epic or vast as a movie would, and has more of the aesthetic that youtube movies like Corridor Digital's ""Sync"" and ""Video Game Highschool"" have. Acting isn't amazing, but visuals are enjoyable and prior knowledge of the setting and characters in the Halo universe is a definite assist to understanding the story.

Overall, it's a great prelude to Halo 4, and alludes to some back story from the novels and provides some insight into characters like Captain Lasky.

Overall, a great piece of entertainment and I would definitely watch it again.",1393718400,,681,4.913043478260869

I am not huge into video games, but I have played HALO and HALO 2 in the past and am a big fan of science fiction action so I thought it would be fun.  The first hour was dreadfully slow.  The last 25 minutes resemble what you would expect from a movie based on Halo.  It is no wonder it didn't make it as a TV series.",1393545600,2,497,3.75

You see people using a futuristic suface like computer like they had in Avatar.
Never got into the whole Halo Xbox thing.
Always thought it was just a dull shooter game with no story.
After watching this though found out it's got a pretty crazy long and crazy story involving the master chief ,aliens, secret soldiers, destruction of all life in universe, etc...

Had to read up about it after watching movie because a lot of things made no sense since I never played the games for example who's cortana?
Why doesn't he take off his helmet like everyone else and the end and why were the other two soldiers faces blue and dead looking?
what are ODST, and there was other acronoyms that were never explained and you need to have played game to know what they are talking about.
Also, always thought Master Chief wasn't human because he's pretty bad ass, rarely talks, always wears that suit and never seems to get killed or even hurt but I found out he's a human called John-117. I figured  he was like robocop or entirely robotic.",1393545600,,1130,4.534313725490196

The journey takes you into Laskey's struggle to finding himself, and to what of many good things he chooses to sacrifice.  It's a lesson that should relate to everyone.  Forward Unto Dawn leaves me wanting to see what's next, and I'm glad they did the story this way.  Now the mystery and possibilities for future movies can go in any direction.

I figured I would give it a try, and I'm glad I did. The first half is a bit on the boring side, but the second half more than makes up for it. Even though I had no clue who the characters were, I was able to immediately pick up on who was important and why. The graphics were amazing for a movie that never went to theaters. I read later that it was a web series that had been adapted into a movie. I guess that's why I had never even heard of it before. Anyway, if you like sci-fi (my favorite genre) then you will like Forward unto Dawn. It was a seriously awesome movie! It had a solid story line and awesome graphics/ action sequences. It kind of reminded me of a mix of Falling Skies, Starship Troopers (the 1st one, not the lousy sequels), Soldier, Aliens and Final Fantasy all rolled into one.

5314609,3,B009B8YZIK,"After watching the rather uneven Halo Legends a while back I wasn't expecting too much from this, but the live action TV ads provided some hope that this would be watchable. That turned out to be the case, in fact it starts really well with Cortana slowly losing her mind on the Forward Unto Dawn while the Masterchief is in cryo-sleep. Her distress beacon is picked up by another UNSC ship whose commander has a personal connection with the Masterchief.

That promising start is eroded somewhat by the body of the film which is the flashback of that connection back during the cadet training programme. This part of the film isn't great, it's not terrible, but it's no Full Metal Jacket. In fact in many ways it reminded me of some of the higher quality fan made movies.

Things do pick up when the Masterchief makes his appearance when the academy is attacked by the Covenent, although maybe my memory is failing me, but it didn't sound like the same voice actor from the game. However the attack is more fun to watch and a Spartan in action is always fun to watch.

Somebody has also been watching too much Spartacus as it suffers from the same excessive slow motion whenever something vaguely interesting it happens. Still overall it's not a bad film, you'll get more out of it if you enjoy the games and this is unlikely to convert you to the Halo universe but if you are already a fan it's worth a watch.",1388534400,,1410,4.5

I was expecting a low budget movie but was pleasantly surprised by the strong acting and story line.  The mixture of the game CGI and the actors tying in a young Captain Lasky was top tier and I am glad that they filled in some extra information about a key character that Bungie could not do in game.  I think this movie along with Halo: Legends has started a great cinematic trend for the Halo universe.

Why should what one's parents did (or do) dictate the capabilities of the children?

5314637,5,B009B8YZIK,"I don't think I've ever given something 5 stars but I did for this.  It deserves 5 stars not because it is a perfect experience but because of what it has accomplished.

With a small budget, 343i was able to pull off a well told and exciting live action movie in the Halo universe.  This is not some fan service that only the Halo devotees can enjoy, this a great movie with great acting, a compelling narrative and solid action.

Forward Unto Dawn follows a group of cadets in a top tier military academy, particularly Private Lasky (who we see in Halo 4).  Lasky  brings to the forefront some major themes of the Halo-verse that have only seen much consideration in some of the books.  The uncertainty of war, the complication of the civil war preceding the Covenant-Human war and the fear and bravery that accompany any conflict.

It's very exciting to see the Covenant War begin and get to see how frightening it was to all of the personnel and troops who weren't Spartans.  The Covenant are mysterious, scary and portrayed in a visceral way.

And of course, we get the larger-than-life awesomeness of seeing a real life master chief in action.

Don't write this off as something only for the hardcore Halo fans, this is a film that a casual fan, or even just a movie fan, can enjoy.

Great action, great characters and great story, all done with a tiny budget that never feels tiny.",1386115200,3,1387,4.548387096774194

5314639,5,B009B8YZIK,This is what a well thought out and endorsed Halo movie could've been like. To see things come to life of a universe I've only seen in the games or had in my head as I read the books was glorious. I just wish it would've gone on longer and had more episodes even if they only became webisodes they could've tied us over until the new Halo TV series (which I also cant wait for) comes out. If you're a old hand at Halo buy it and watch it you won't be disappointed especially if you pare it up with Halo Legends. If you're new and wondering what the Halo universe is about watch Halo Legends first then come back and buy this one.,1386028800,,629,4.04

I think the plot deserves a better presentation, not that the quality was cheap or anything.  I think the desire to hide the surprise ending may have led the director to conceal a little too much in the way of cues and clues as to what was going on.

Be warned, there is very little of what you would expect from the Halo universe here. It's primarily about an officer training academy for the Marines...a bunch of kids.

This is live action, the character development of the main character was decent, the acting was excellent, emotions felt real, nonverbal scenes were very well played out. Master Chief was awesome!

if you want spoilers basically it follows the life of a few highly privileged kids who are in military academy on some remote world. They are learning to work together as a team. the main character reminisces on his brother who died in combat. team conflicts are played out with a brief exploration of romance. unaware there is a fight against an alien race (they think just against rebel armies) they are invaded by the Covenant who tries to exterminate everyone on the base. The kids fight hopelessly and are rescued at the last minute by Master Chief and lead on a fight towards the pickup point. There is death and tragedy. This tugs at your heartstrings.

It's a solid story arc and the graphics aren't bad, but the way it was filmed was incomplete, such as when there is major battle going on and no backscreen...only fog. It has a slightly cheap element to the film making that doesn't match up with the epicness of the Halo games, hence the disappointment.
The detail is pretty good, but there are some major flaws. Spartan armor doesn't have numbers on it, and everyone who's played the game knows that, but the biggest flaw is the timeline. At this point the Spartans are kids with low ranks. 117 doesn't earn the rank of Master Chief until much later in his life, but that is what he refers to himself as in the film.

5314705,1,B009B8YZIK,"This film was epically disappointing. It's set at a military academy right before humans encounter the covenant and follows a squad of cadets as they go through training. It starts out in a documentary style with interviews from each of the cadets, and then proceeds to spend the first half of the movie doing character development. Unfortunately this mostly consists of us watching them watch newsreels, video letters, etc, and talk about what a recalcitrant moron the protagonist is; there's very little action in either the physical or dramatic sense. Scrolling text on screen with character bios would have been better; at least I would have had something to read. If you want to see this done right go watch Full Metal Jacket.

Fortunately the action picks up in the second half when things suddenly go off the rails, and we get to see some actual battles and the characters we've come to know painfully well put into some stressful situations. The costume design and special effects are actually pretty decent here, but the cinematography is awful. It leans really heavily on slow motion, which when used sparingly can really enhance action scenes, but when literally every significant action that happens on screen takes 20 times longer than it should you start checking your phone for new emails. It also gives you a lot of time to see all the stupid mistakes they made, e.g. the gatling gun on the warthog not rotating as it fires.

Overall it's a complete mess. The set design, script, cinematography, and plot are all terrible, the acting varies from mediocre to abysmal, and the action would be decent if it weren't so painfully slow. It's only saving grace is it's costume design and special effects. The real dealbreaker though is between the first half where nothing happens and the second half where everything happens in slow motion the movie ends up being downright boring, which is a real shame given its source material. Speaking as someone who played through the first three games and read several of the books - all of which I thoroughly enjoyed - I'd highly recommend not wasting your time with this.",1379635200,5,2123,4.861878453038674

Very well done.  Good enough for me to buy it now that I've seen it.  I very much liked the affiliation with ancient Roman gravitas.  Great story, great effects, and a fair degree of great acting.

I am not a Halo nerd, although I am familiar with the genre. I am just rating this as a stand-alone scifi movie/thriller/shoot-em-up.

That said, and since I kept falling asleep through it, I'll give the Cliff Notes version: I thought the movie was pretty dumb, poorly written, not very well acted, but very, very loud. I guess that's why I kept waking up, because it was so damn loud. Okay, maybe I'm not being fair because I'm probably a little too old to enjoy such nonsense, and truth be told, I never play video games.

H4:FUD is back story, and I know a lot of people get bent out of shape when the story doesn't involved a certain Spartan. However, as an amateur writer myself, I really appreciate when a piece of a fictional universe expands on the norm, and this movie delivers. I did have fairly low expectations, and I've read that other prior-military people think this movie is stupid, but personally I think the point is how the events changed the main character, not how good a soldier he was in the beginning. Not to mention, enlisted personnel receive very different training from officers, so... knowing a lot about [modern] enlisted life, and a bit about commissioned, I have to say one's perspective may be very different from mine going into this movie.

5314787,5,B009B8YZIK,"I picked this movie up from a Red Box because I was bored and wanted something to watch that I haven't seen before. This movie was near the bottom of my list of things to watch because I am not a fan of the Halo games, so I didn't really hold out much hope for the movie. I expected it to be basically like Starship Troopers (which was a great book that got turned into a disappointing movie) and I did not have high expectation for it at all.

To my great surprise this movie is excellent. It is far closer to Enders Game than Starship Troopers, and the movie shines because of it. The majority of the movie follows a group of cadets (probably aged around 13-16) who are the children of the military elite as they progress through military school. I am guessing that this all deals with the ""lore"" of the Halo series and technically takes place before the first game, because it didn't have anything to do with the video game I remember playing (which to me is a huge plus). Instead of fighting aliens the children are learning how to fight ""Insurrectionists"", a group who's purpose is never explained but left enticingly nebulous. The 10 or so minutes of the movie that did include the main character from the games (Master Chief) were the least interesting portions of the movie but didn't do enough to make me drop down to 4 stars.

This was a wonderfully written movie, good dialogue, good coming of age themes, dystopian overtones, it is well paced (something many big budget theater release movies can't seem to get right), well acted (which is a accomplishment considering that 90% of the cast are teens), and engaging.

If you are a fan of Halo then I can't really advise you if you will enjoy this. If you are like me and are either not a fan or are ambivalent about Halo as a franchise but enjoy things like Enders Game or Old Mans War then do yourself a favor and pick this movie up.

5314791,2,B009B8YZIK,"Aside from the constant slow motion, the quality of the camera was extremely good. CG wasn't big budget Hollywood movie, but was still very good regardless. Again, the slow motion got old after the very beginning and it happened even more towards the end. I felt it didn't add anything and found it to only be a nuisance.

With all that said, I really didn't like this. It should be noted that I am currently and have always been NOT a fan of the Halo series (I watched this on Netflix so I got to watch it for ""free"" instead of paying the rental price on Amazon. The absolute ONLY reason I even considered looking at it). I'm not sure what it is about people who write the Halo stories or design the costumes, but you could at least spend a little time thinking about things from a tactical point of view and maybe do a tiny bit of research into the military. Example being when they were running through the woods at night to escape and the one kid had a lantern. Really? And why does Mst. Chief have so many lights on him too? We have these things called NVG's and they can see with IR lights. I understand it's a movie and all, but if you're not going to try and make it believable then why even bother making it? I'm also not a fan AT ALL of this ""I'm the only one who can save the entire universe"" scenario. I mean seriously, he took out 3 or 4 alien ""snipers"" from what appeared to be a good 350m with a pistol WHILE running. Did I mention with a pistol? And while running? It just gets so obnoxious because it shows a total lack of creative thinking and involvement of the other characters while writing. ""Hmm...how should we kill these guys?? ...well I give up! Let's just have Mst. Chief Spartan kick them from the sky and call it a day.""

So that's my two cents. I still think big time Halo fans will love this so if you're a big fan of the games I definitely recommend it to you.",1369094400,5,1891,4.1923076923076925

5314795,5,B009B8YZIK,"I've been craving a Halo movie ever since I first played the game many years ago.  The premise and setting are prime stock for an on-screen adaptation, however Hollywood's go at video game movies has a horrible track record (yes, I'm looking at you, Uwe Boll).  So, needless to say, I was a bit apprehensive about HALO: FORWARD UNTO DAWN when I first heard about it.  I mean, it had minimal promotion to begin with, and then I found out it was a web series...ouch!  But then I sat down and watched the DVD version...and WOW...I was blown away!  This is one video game adaptation that truly does its source material justice!

HALO: FORWARD UNTO DAWN is a serious adaptation that should make even the stoutest of Halo fans happy.  It looks great, but it also bears the dark and gritty feel that military movies should have.  The acting is superb and the action is intense; add to this a nice selection of practical and visual effects, and the result is a stellar film that will entertain and impress.

There are so many things to like here.  As mentioned, the acting is top notch with Tom Green and Anna Popplewell leading a great cast.  Although I am not very familiar with their previous work (Popplewell's most notable appearance prior to this was in the CHRONICLES OF NARNIA series), Green and Popplewell display massive talent in this film and play off of each other very well.

Also, as I previously mentioned, the special effects in HALO: FORWARD UNTO DAWN look great.  The production team spent a lot of time to get the details from the game correct, and the effort definitely pays off.  I found myself grinning a couple of times when I recognized a weapon or piece of equipment from the game.  Even Master Chief's armor, which could be difficult to actually construct, looks realistic.  This was a major point for impressing me overall.

But the storyline is what truly made me breathe a content sigh of relief.  The studio actually got it right!  They didn't deviate and try to make a nonsensical movie that only borrowed slightly from the game itself (like the travesty that is DOOM), nor did they try to recreate a new mythology that was not already there.  The production team stays true-to-form and delivers an outstanding film that every director considering a game-to-movie project should watch.

HALO: FORWARD UNTO DAWN is an absolute blast and I highly recommend giving it a look.  Even if you're not a fan of the game, you will still enjoy this military science-fiction masterpiece.  The film is available on Blu-ray, DVD, and streaming, so check it out for sure.",1368403200,,2580,4.697104677060134

5314798,4,B009B8YZIK,"I'm not a gamer and probably too old to start. But I like sci-fi flicks, particularly those where well armed soldiers fight off alien creatures. So how did I miss this little gem? Go figure.

Here's the scoop. You meet some new recruits in the academy to train soldiers whose express purpose seems to be to kill 'insurrectionists.' All the cadets we meet have parents high up in the ranks. All are drinking the Koolaid save for one (Thomas Lasky) who's not certain their mission is an admirable one. They train and are ready to do their thing when, all of the sudden, they come under alien attack. Some super robot comes to pull their ashes out of the fire and the next chapter is set up.

This is an oddly compelling movie. The structure is odd in that there is no story or character arc. The viewer is taken through a series of episodes and is set up to go one place when, in the blink of an eye, he ends up headed someplace else. And this happens in the last twenty or thirty minutes so there isn't much time to wrap things up, which they don't. But, for a TV movie this is way beyond anything I've ever seen. Since ""Star Wars"" and ""Bladerunner"", film makers have gotten to realize that one of the keys to a good sci-fi movie is the look and feel, and they deliver that here in spades. The sets, costumes, effect et al are spot on. They must have used digital gear with a lot of post production, because this almost has the look of the games from which it was derived. I questioned some of the casting but those reservations faded as the movie wore on.

This isn't for the casual viewer. It's for hard core sci-fi nut jobs like me who want to see cool stuff and things that blow up real good.",1368057600,,1695,4.25776397515528
5314799,4,B009B8YZIK,the movie looks like a low budget film but the story line was good. although low budget the setting was creatively done well...,1367884800,,127,4.565217391304348
5314800,5,B009B8YZIK,an awesome halo movie. a must have for anyone who loves the halo video games. i strongly recommend this product,1367712000,,111,4.6
5314801,5,B009B8YZIK,"When I saw some pics for this movie at some websites, it felt like youtube movie put together by a bunch of fans and I was not very interested in it. But now that I watched is I have to say I am quite surprised by the quality of it.

******************************PROS*******************************
Indepth Personal story: The story revolved around a non Master Chief character, a cadet called Lasky. More you follow the character, more you get interested and more you like him and other cadets.

Great acting: I personally didn't know a single actor, but I have to say I loved the acting of almost everyone of them. They all really add different colors to each cadet's personality. Well done.

Master Chief, aliens and Halo universe: I like how they slowly introduce him. He is in rather small portion of the story but where he is, he still kicks some major butt.

Quality/budget ratio: This is why I gave it a five star. There are Hollywood movies that have 10x or 20x  budget of this movie and they still fail to deliver. Compared to that this movie is shot on a smaller budget but really delivers it.

******************************CONS*********************************

Budget: Since it is on a small budget, action is not as great as say movies like Iron Man, Transformers, but it is still pretty good.

*****************************CONCLUSION*****************************
I say it is a must buy for Halo fans, but if you don't at least watch it. You won't regret it.",1367625600,,1474,4.963414634146342

5314803,4,B009B8YZIK,"An interesting perspective on the franchise.  You still see your beloved Master Chief, but you get a lot more background and a decent plot to the war itself.",1367280000,,157,4.607142857142857

It wasn't what I expected exactly, but it was an interesting twist or perspective to do the film through.  I was VERY pleasantly surprised with this after I took a chance on it.  Only thing that was wrong with this was that it wasn't a full blown mini series, I just wanted more more more at the end of it, hope they make some sequels.",1366588800,,446,4.162790697674419
5314808,5,B009B8YZIK,Much of the time Games made into movies don't turn out well.  But this was pretty cool.  However if your not a fan of the Halo game its might be more so so since knowing a bit of history from the game makes this more fun to watch.,1366588800,,230,3.7708333333333335
5314809,5,B009B8YZIK,I watched these on LIVE when they first came out and couldn't wait for the DVD. Great gift for any Halo fan; well written with good actors. My husband and I are hoping they choose to continue the series.,1366416000,,203,4.230769230769231
5314810,4,B009B8YZIK,I'm not a gamer but I played Halo in the beginning. This movie was enjoyable to the point that it was s segway into the games mission and it was interesting to see the academy life of the cadets. There is plenty that could have been in this production but it served it's purpose.,1366329600,,279,4.185185185185185
5314811,4,B009B8YZIK,I thought it was a cool buy.  it came with a lot of special features that showed how they made the movie building up to halo 4. it also had a little bit of extra movie footage that wasn't in the series that we saw on xbox live or youtube so that was cool. i would recommend this but it just depends on what anyone who wants to buy it thought of the series.,1366070400,,356,3.810810810810811
5314812,5,B009B8YZIK,Best video-game to movie adaption I've seen in a very long time. They can do so much more than this but it was nice to see Master Cheif from the perspective of young cadets.,1365984000,,173,4.117647058823529
5314813,4,B009B8YZIK,"For a low-budget movie this was remarkably well done.

If you were a fan of the Battlestar Galactica series then you should like this movie.  The movie had the same ""feel"" as far as the scenery, the props, the acting and the action shots were concerned.  Even some of the actors from Battlestar Galactica starred in this movie.

The basic storyline is fairly simple to follow although there are a few spots where they could have done better (Like Cortana's borderline insane ramblings at the very beginning of the movie).  The producers of the movie obviously make the assumption that anyone watching this movie would be familiar with the games and therefore they don't make much of an attempt to explain some things.  With just a few minor 'tweaks' this movie could very easily have stood on its own merit as a sci-fi movie.

Whether you've ever played the Halo video games or not, this is an entertaining sci-fi movie.

There are plenty of examples of successful movie series that were based on video games.  With a few slight adjustments to this storyline (drop the assumptions that everyone who is watching this has played Halo before), then they could make an excellent series of movies on this character.  There is a sad lack of quality sci-fi movies out there.  This could (and should) be made into a series.",1365724800,,1315,4.723684210526316

I was extremly excited for this when I first heard about it, me being a long term fan, and I was very happy when these came out online. I think you can only watch the first two episodes on YouTube now but if you're interested in this go watch them and see if you like it then come back here to buy it.",1365292800,,407,3.9156626506024095
5314817,3,B009B8YZIK,I hoped this would have been more directed to the seargent and his helmet finally coming off. Yes it was a lets get the kids to grow up and move through hard times moving. A definite pulling ones head out of ones...well lets just it didn't stink. I hope the next has more livliness to it but a good romp none the less.,1365033600,,318,4.063492063492063
5314818,5,B009B8YZIK,"This is a great movie whether or not you are familiar with the Halo mythos.  If you are familiar, the added depth makes it even better.

As a warning, it was initially released as several ~20min webisodes, so the transition from one episode to the next is sometimes obvious but that is no big deal.  This release ties them all together into one 90 minute movie length feature with some extra content added in.  It really is top notch.

Forward Unto Dawn gives me great hope that other video games can get proper movie adaptations.  Just as comic adaptations went through the growing pains of horrible cash grab, crapfests before becoming one of the dominant (at least in popular opinion) genres of the day, I believe that this is the first step in that direction for video games (okay, maybe Super Mario Bros. the movie was the first step. J/K)",1364947200,,844,4.593333333333334
5314819,5,B009B8YZIK,I have been a fan of the Halo story and the players since the beginnings of this saga. The take on Forward Unto Dawn is that it is a great story line and direction for the story to go in. The original stuff always had political undertones and this story rides that undercurrent in a totally new way using a unique point of view. All I can say is we need more...MUCH MUCH more. Don't let it end here..........,1364860800,,408,4.177215189873418

Where I am there are no English language stations and my French isn't all that good, so I bought this movie to have something to pass some time with.  The sales language never said anything about the films only being available within the Continental US, i.e. I can't watch it 'til I get home.

How they combined Halo 4 game footage with the movie was inspired and works well to link Forward unto Dawn with Halo 4 and explain why the commander of Infinity is listening so closely to the emergency broadcast that Cortana is sending out.

Now we just need Microsoft to get a real full length Halo movie made.",1363478400,,563,4.509803921568627

The story is slow at first and ramps up nicely towards the end. The acting is good, the CG effects are or and overall it is a solid entry into the universe.

Still, most would prefer a CGI movie that was able to show more of the Covenant and the greater aspects of the war, but that requires Microsoft to play ball with HollyWood which they refuse to do and which I applaud them for.

I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of this movie -  unique story, good acting and quality special effects.  However, this is not an action movie, although the action picks up at the end.

5314866,3,B009B8YZIK,"Content wise the movie was amazing. 4 stars. It was a little slow but picked up fast. I took off 1 extra star because the movie was originaly a YouTube production. They then took the videos off to make them a DVD. I ended up renting through amazon for a couple bucks. Just a FYI: If the clips were left on YouTube I would have supported the movie production and bought the DVD. As a matter of principle I won't buy it now.

Picture quality on blu-ray versus online was amazing. The detail they had into props and set was incredible. For just an online web series, they went above and beyond on making it. It also had some good special features.
Overall, I recommend Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn.",1361059200,,425,4.835616438356165

A beginning has been added in a documentary style that fleshes out the characters within the film, something that the individual webisodes weren't always capable of achieving due to the 15 minute window each one ran. This is, by far, the difinitive version of the film and worth taking a look at.",1360972800,,446,4.658227848101266

The action doesn't start until the last half hour of the show when the aliens arrive, then it looks like a panty raid in the dark with fire crackers going off..  The aliens are hardly visible for more than a few seconds.  Its more like a reality show/soap opera.  This movie was a total waste of time and money.",1360800000,,440,4.253012048192771

When I first saw that this was going to happen, I thought that it was just going to be another low-budget mediocre movie. But, I was wrong. It was entertaining and well acted. The effects were great. Especially the Covenant Aliens. I was shocked! They looked like they were straight from the game. The colors were perfect, they were all the correct sizes. They could have been ""real."" It was awesome. Really the only thing I didn't like was Master Chief's voice actor It wasn't quite what I was expecting. It was close, but still not quite there.

Overall this movie was extremely well done. This makes it VERY feasible for a movie based off the Halo games themselves.",1360368000,,725,4.492424242424242

I have to say that this live action HALO movie is excellently done.  The special effects are terrific, and you really get a sense that it IS real.  Watch the Special Features about how they made the special effects, the Warthog, and the Master Chief armor.

This definitely ties in to HALO 4 in that we see how it all began.

If you love HALO 4, pick this up in BluRay and turn up the volume.  You won't regret it!",1359158400,,604,4.111111111111111

5314906,5,B009B8YZIK,"This is a great intro into the live action world for Halo. It was a little slow to get started but it was a good intro into the story if you haven't been playing the games at all. The action scenes were fantastic and the guns and the energy sword all looked perfect. I wish there would have been a few grunts running around with plasma grenades in their hands and yelling like in the games. I always liked them, but it was definitely worth watching. I hope this helps to generate some interest in the studios so that they will keep the live action Halo dream alive. I can't believe nobody has stayed on board to produce one.

It is not bad, like some reviewers claimed, and there was one other person who wrote that anyone could do that movie. It's simply not true. The special effects were surprisingly good, acting was good and not childish or stupid. We even seen aliens, that looked also surprisingly good, even though you couldn't always get a clear look at them. Well done prequel for Halo 4.",1358899200,,532,4.610526315789474

The effects are as good as can be, but the Covenant are hard to see in detail, probably due to the night fight scene.

They did not know the covenant even existed during the first half of this movie as well as in the start of Halo:Reach. So when the covenant shows up the cadets don't even know what they are.

(Yeah, yeah, 'I should be doing my job,' but I've got enough time to take a breather every now and then.)  The movie is good and it does a great job of surprising the viewer because of this.  I thought it would be another low-budget live action video game commercial, but it turned out to be quite immersive.  You can tell that they didn't have enough money to make it super believable.  For instance, the CGI for the...

---Minor Spoiler---

...various Covenant species could have been better, but it was still pretty darn well done.  They did an amazing job at getting my heart racing by making them huge, powerful aliens that I'd never really experienced before.  I think the Chief's armor could have been better as well as the skinny, untrained look of all the cadets, which may have been on purpose; these are just preferences.

This basically told a small story leading up to the awakening of the Master Chief at the beginning of Halo 4, which I have not played, so it was a fantastic teaser.  A Staff Sergeant who's never played a Halo game or read any of the books watched it before I did and he loved it.  I have a copy of the Halo 4 Xbox Magazine with the Halo timeline in it here, and he sat down and read that magazine for an hour straight; he's like 35, so there's some proof that even if you're not a Halo fan, you could enjoy this.

Maaaaan, I wish they would just make one really good two to three hour Halo film.  I mean REALLY good.  If they disappoint me at all with a movie, it would suck.  That may be the reason they haven't made one, yet - fear of failure.  Anyways, buy this!",1357603200,,1885,4.2740112994350286

5314948,3,B009B8YZIK,"Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn, while an entertaining (but not as great as it should have been) movie for Halo Fans leaves those unfamiliar with the series puzzled and confused.

*SPOILER ALERT*

The story is set on a distant planet before the arrival of the Covenant. It opens with personal interviews of young ""cadets"" that are in training to join the UNSC and their struggles in training. Near the later half of the movie, the covenant invades and begins slaughtering the entire academy, save a handful of cadets.

Master Chief and a couple other ""Spartans"" were deployed to defeat the Covenant in an attempt to rescue these handful of cadets.

The end of the movie is up to you to see, but there are a few critiques I have with the film:

1) Post-production was not what I expected for a Halo film. It was a bit on the cheap side.
2) Actor jobs were tolerable, though not great.
3) Most importantly, I'm sure fans would have liked to see a different story line other than what was presented.

In sum, if you're a Halo fan you'll like it. If you're not, I wouldn't bother.",1357516800,,1070,4.461538461538462

I think some of the other live action short films have been very good. The Peter Jackson/Neil Blomkamp stuff, the snippets for Halo 3, ODST and Reach, etc. Just makes you see how good a real Halo movie could be.

There are some Halo moments in Forward Unto Dawn for sure, but they are spread thin.

Yes, they built an actual Wart Hog (or possibly got one from Peter Jackson) but this is used way too much in the movie. It's in too many scenes and it doesn't look like it can go very fast. The actors look frail. Like a left over casting call from Twilight. There is a lot of touchy feely stuff that has no business in the Halo universe. The assault rifles look like they are made of plastic and the actors handle them like Nerf guns. The lead actress gets killed with a single needle (I think) from a Needler. Could they have thrown in a MAP FROM THE GAME when they are playing capture the flag or whatever they are doing? They use some silly tactic to win that's not possible to do in the actual game. Possibly talking to a few people who have played the game would have helped.

They discuss military tactics like they are talking to a 3rd grader and show a graphic about it that makes no sense. Why did Master Chief not ""stick"" the last bad guy with a plasma grenade? He took the greande and dug around in the alien's suit before he set it off? Did ANYONE associated with the movie ever play the game?

There is so much wrong with this movie for someone familiar with the game, that it would be difficult to write it all down.

I appreciate the effort, I guess.

The opening was in a surprisingly natural documentary style. The characters were being developed and the story was interesting. As the movie progressed, it was slow at times, somewhat unbelievable at times, maybe a bit simple, but it still kept my attention through most of it.

In the last quarter of the movie it turned. It became entirely unbelievable, and it seemed like the producers were trying to integrate the video game, taking it from a sci-fi with realism and some depth through the various characters, to a kind of cartoonish and shallow movie.

I don't want to give away too much in case you want to see it, but by the very end, I wished I could take back the time it took to watch the movie. I'm guessing that those gamers who know the back story will have a better experience. Also the movie clearly was making way for a sequel, so almost nothing was resolved and there were no answers.

And if you have not played Halo, this movie would make no sense at all (especially the last 10 minutes of the movie).

Spoiler Alert:  I love it when the soldiers tells the cadets they are the only 4 survivors of the planet - really, come on, no warning of a war or anything, not one enemy soldier ever seen up to that point but the world is conquered? I guess communications were down for the whole war such that noone had any idea what was going on???  I guess that fleet taking off in the end came from another planet or something.  The whole movie made no sense; it did not flow with a theme, choppy with no clear direction.

Then, suddenly the movie starts and it becomes the usual alien-chasing-humans action sequence until it ends. The credits come, and after that you have the bloopers that kills all the mood.

When you meet real young war vets who have scars from war, you understand that the screenplay was made by someone who does not know any war vet.

The music is awesome and it has very good landscapes from time to time.  So you may like to buy the soundtrack instead of the movie.

If you are a fan of good scifi movies, I do not recommend this movie at all.  It is boredom in 2/3 of the movie and some 1/3 of movie with some forgettable action sequences.  ""Starship Troopers: Invasion"" is far better as it has a similar teenager style, but it was better made in terms of drama, action and pace.",1356739200,,921,4.258620689655173

I felt they spent too much time trying to provide the back story for those not familiar with the game's back story (such that it is). It's like a game that forces you to go through a training section to learn how to move and use the weapons when all you want to do is get started blowing away bad guys.

Forward Unto Dawn, is surprisingly good (special effects, art, direction, acting) considering this is an indie movie.

2. Takes forever for Master Chief to show up and when he does he babysits a bunch of kids.
3. You barley see any fighting actions from Master Chief.
4. Master Chief was on maybe 15 minutes and then the movie ended.

As far as how things looked that part was awesome. The suits, weapons, warthog, & Covenant was that of the game.
Cortana looked great too but I did expect to see her a lot with Master Chief but you don't.",1356307200,2,900,4.137142857142857

The extended scenes are awesome, the additional features are cool. But most of all, watching Master Chief outside of CGI is amazing. I even like Laskey's story.  I've been a Halo fan since Halo CE came out.  Any Halo fan should like this.  If you are a fan of Sci-Fi in general, you'll probably like this, but if you aren't familiar with the story of Halo, you might get a bit confused.",1356220800,,522,4.350515463917525

5315004,5,B009B8YZIK,"I watched the episodes on youtube after they had all been released. This production for a web mini series has far better production value than many of the more recently released science fiction movies that have been in theaters [e.g. Resident Evil/etc.] This series seems more like the intro to a movie, and you will feel like ""why'd it stop, it was just getting started"" However; it is still more than worthy of watching.

Saw some reviews saying you had to be a gamer, play the game, to understand. That's not true at all. You can easily follow this movie, and understand everything. You would have a much greater appreciation for the subtly introduced items if you were a fan of the game, but easily feels like someone whom knew nothing of the game franchise can easily find it easy to enjoy the series.

Worth the watch!!!",1356134400,,826,4.612244897959184

5315006,4,B009B8YZIK,"If there were no elements of Halo in this movie the story-line and character base could not keep it above the threshold of being entertaining. The graphics are on par with, let's say, a STARZ mini-series. I know most people will say that the substance of a movie is not derived from the graphics, but to those people I say that there isn't much of a story to compensate for mediocre graphics, and in a Halo movie graphics ARE important. You're not going to put a guy in a Covenant costume...you hire Andy Serkis and pump 70 million dollars into those CG scenes, HALO deserves it!

Now, with that out of the way I will tell you why this movie deserves a 4-star rating:

1. It IS Halo, afterall.
2. It feels like a ""fan=boy"" production...and I can relate to any fan-boy of Halo.
3. It is the best Halo film available.",1356134400,,815,4.355263157894737

5315011,2,B009B8YZIK,"I'm a fan of Halo but in all honesty this didn't do it any justice. Halo fan or not you'll notice this movie has cheap special effects, over used slow motion (even in non-action sequences) and a constant fog/darkness that doesn't allow you to really see the enemies.

The beginning started out well and set the stage for what I thought was going to be some serious chief epicness. Then you dive into the ""action"" with over used slow motion for insignificant scenes and enemies that you can barely see through all the smoke (I don't remember the games being so dark and smokey).  I figured ""eh... it'll get better"" but just when I thought the action was going to get interesting the ""kick ass"" fight scene lasted 10 seconds (grenade... back flip...done). Characters started out strong but I felt that the acting was really lacking towards the end of the movie. Plus master chief is barely in the movie...you see more alternate characters and as a fan I expected more of chief. I'm sure that it was the script and budget that constrained it.

Not sure why this hasn't been made into an actual movie yet...but this movie is not what I expected it to be. Don't waste your money! Just wait for it to come out on Netflix...",1355961600,,1217,4.5227272727272725

I am a HUGE scifi fan, and James Cameron's Aliens remains one of my top scifi movies. Its so simple to see how Aliens have influenced Halo itself, such as Cryo sleep chambers, Vehicle designs, marines, and weapons. Im not a tough critic and i can appreciate all sorts of films. For instance Last Airbender was a horrible movie, because of the horrible director.  When i first saw the trailer for this on itunes, i was very impressed and after reading the reviews, I decided to go and get a copy on BluRay. This movie looks and sounds amazing. The effects are decent, as well as the acting! You have a sense that you are in this Halo universe, and thats a pretty awesome feeling to feel immersed in a film.

5315034,5,B009B8YZIK,"I've been a Halo fan for a decade now, first on the original Xbox and now on the 360. What has amazed me about the series is the depth of story that one doesn't often find in video games. This prequel to Halo 4 takes place before Halo Reach, and possibly before the war on Harvest (around the time of the Halo Wars game). More of the Halo history can be found on Halo Waypoint (Xbox Live).
The name of this story comes both from the ship that Chief and Cortana are stranded on at the end of Halo 3 as well as the poem (possibly an in-story author) written above the bunks of the Corbulo Academy of Military Sciences, where most of the story takes place. Most of the prequel is set to introduce Thomas Lasky, a cadet and later commander on the UNSC Ifininity (where he is a prominent character in the Halo 4 game and later the Infinity Sparten Ops episodes that come with the game), and his first encounter with both the Chief and Covenent. This story brings to life the Halo world as never before.",1355616000,,997,4.252631578947368
5315035,4,B009B8YZIK,"The story begins at the space academy where a group of privileged teens train to fight the ""insurgents"" a group of ""over taxed farmers"" as cadet Thomas Lasky (Tom Green) puts it. He has trouble with cryo-sleep as it makes him violently ill. He also has a love interest in Silva (Anna Popplewell, Queen of Narnia). The film centers around the character of Lasky and his relationship with his fellow students as well as his medical condition.

The students realize something isn't right. When the academy is attacked, they must all man up.

This is part of a series. As a stand alone film, it makes little sense as the background information is provided in bits and pieces. This is geared toward a teen/ young adult audience, having the feel of ""Starship Troopers"" with its over the top military propaganda speeches.

Rated TV-14, although outside of the violence, it could very well be PG. One co-ed locker room scene with girl in bra top. One use of ""D"" male member word.",1355616000,2,971,4.666666666666667

This series was promised to Halo fans everywhere as a FREE webseries.  It is very disappointing that 343 would renege on their promise like this.

Considering that a movie about wizard kid ""Harry Potter"" or a movie with magical ring powers like ""Lord of the Rings"" became block buster movies, there's no reason HALO is less engaging than those titles. HALO has potential of becoming the next ""Star Wars"" or ""Star Trek"".

Then main reason for my comments is that I wanted to clarify the Region coding for those who are asking.  I am in the UK but I have a manually switched multi-region BluRay player and can confirm that this disc only plays when set to Region A. I have only tested the disc on my player so there maybe some anomolies out there that contradict my experience.

5315055,5,B009B8YZIK,"When I first saw this video was available for viewing in Halo Waypoint on the Xbox 360, I was skeptical about what I was about to watch.  I was thinking it was going to be a 20 minute video with some props to Master Chief (Main Hero of the Halo Series) and cameo appearances of some Covenant (aliens main ""bad guys"") etc.  I started the movie and was I pleasantly wrong!  You can watch this movie even if you have never played any of the Halo games and have a good idea of storyline.  The cinema photography is amazing.  Special effects are excellent, and a very passionate story line.  This show was superb in a lot of respects in my opinion.  The only minute complaint I have which isn't big at all is I wish it was the same voice actor that voiced the master chief in the games doing the voice in the movie.  It's not a big issue at all, so I wouldn't let that discourage you from watching this video if you have played Halo before.  When the movie finished I was a little sad the movie was over.  I hope that they make a movie and/or series.  If you are a fan of Sci-Fi, I would suggest watching this movie, and see why fans of Halo love this franchise.",1355270400,,1157,4.143497757847534

Don't get me wrong, I realize how a thin plot and characters can ruin a movie (e.g., Transformers, Clash of the Titans) but the time spent on character development seemed, well, overwrought. The CGI is good, when it occurs, but it doesn't save the movie. I wouldn't recommend getting this movie at the current price ($4).",1355270400,,462,4.935897435897436

The show took the time to introduce you to the characters, give some background to their life situations, and then out of the blue, wham!

I give this 5 stars because it was actually written and directed like a show, and because so uncharacteristically to the science fiction/fantasy genre it did a good job establishing character development, action, threw in some jump out of your chair thrills, and left you a little hungry for more.",1355184000,,581,4.621359223300971

5315072,5,B009B8YZIK,"I'm a gal who enjoys sci-fi and casual games, but I've never really played Halo. Turns out that wasn't a deterrent at all when it came to liking the movie.

Like many, I started the first part without a whole lot of expectations (though Anna Popplewell -- of Narnia fame -- being involved was a somewhat positive sign), then was completely drawn in by the story, the music, and the ""big budget"" feel -- quality in every shot. It reminded me of BSG in a good way. If you generally like sci-fi, but don't know much about Halo, there's still an excellent chance you'll enjoy this, so give it a shot if some Halo fan in your life wants you to see it with them!

** Somewhat SPOILERY commentary ahead **
I've now seen the version on the web, which broke the movie up into 5 parts, as well as the full feature on Blu-ray, and I actually really liked the way it was done on the web. (At time of this writing, the first two episodes are still free to watch on YouTube, but the final three parts are not.) Each part is preceded by an intro clip of Cortana going crazy (""rampant"") on board the Forward Unto Dawn, contemplating bringing Master Chief out of cryo. This has little to do with the plot of the main story itself, but ties in at the end. The Blu-ray/DVD feature instead bookends the Cortana/Chief scenes at the beginning and end, so that the movie is uninterrupted. Also you get a bit of extra footage in the latter version. Obviously, the difference isn't that great between the two; the same basic content is there, and that's all that really matters.
** End spoilers **

This movie *is* setup for the Halo 4 game, so while it's surprisingly self contained given that, if you want to find out more about the fates of the two protagonists (Lasky and Master Chief), you'll have to play Halo 4 or watch the cut scenes from the game on YouTube. ;) I don't think that's necessary to enjoy this movie, however!",1354924800,,1906,4.378531073446328
5315073,4,B009B8YZIK,"If you liked Ender's Game, you may really enjoy this military training action film.

I went into this movie with low expectations, however, I was blown away. The film relies more on characterization and story than special effects and videogame-related action. I found myself caring about the characters and really enjoyed the payoff at the end. Give the film ten minutes - the first scenes were confusing and, if you now little about the Halo universe, downright confusing. However, once the film steadies in on the training school, the story starts to take off. It asks interesting questions and piles difficulty after difficulty on the protagonist to the place where I was almost sure he was going to make a decision that would take him well away from the military action suggested by the backstory.

And then all hell breaks loose.

The production values were on the indie side but very effective. This story was a rare find, surprisingly good, a very welcome surprise, and possibly the best videogame-related movie I've seen.",1354924800,,1029,4.97093023255814

The previous live-action short used to advertise Halo 3 was very well done, but it wes, well, short... And the action wasn't exactly excellent. In this series/movie, everything is done extremely well! Attention to detail is superb, from the cut on Laski's lip, to the blisters from his allergy... Some things you may not notice until you've watched several times (like the threat level ""red"" that you hear on the radio as the warthog passes by in episode 3 (as cadet Laski salutes the general as he drives by). Everything was done to the highest standards. I'm excited to see what Speilberg (if he's still insterested) will come up with for the movie(s) in the future. As much as I have enjoyed and loved the games, they are somewhat one dimensional and the Halo story/universe is so vast, it really needs some fleshing out.

If you have read the books and played the games, it has a solid story line.  It ties in amazingly to the last two books and Halo 4.  In terms of Cinematography, I can't believe how they pulled it off.  The actors are young but great, the scope and landscape perfect.  Even the CGI plays a great role in adding to the story without ruining it like most non-maintstream movies.  The single greatest thing about this.....is FINALLY seeing the Master Chief in real life, it will bring chills to any Halo fan.  I could ramble on for hours about this.

Long story short, buy it and watch it.  A great flick and kudos to those that made it.",1354147200,39,809,4.375838926174497

The acting was well down. the Special effects were far-reaching during the second half, where it becomes more intense. the texture and cinematography were exquisite. Sound track was moving throughout movie. Overall I believe it definitely gives the Halo Mythos more depth and realism. It also fills in some gaps in the Halo time-line. This movie actually made me cry in some scenes.  The acting depiction of master chief was surprisingly good and the ending left me more curious than before about who the spartans were.

Another reviewer made a comment about this being a Starship Trooper knock off... apparently that reviewer only saw a few minutes of Starship Troopers, because the socioeconomic themes developed through Starship Troopers (while I do like them) are completely absent in Halo. Instead, Forward unto Dawn does an excellent job developing the premise of internal conflict and struggle of a Cadet under presure about who he is and how he makes that personal distinction, and what he does when he is called to action by one of the most powerful figures in Halo history. His struggle, his loss, his sacrifice and his choice. Wonderfully done and lovely to experience.",1353542400,7,761,4.861538461538461

5315093,5,B009B8YZIK,"The following lists the differences between the webisodes and the full Forward Unto Dawn (hereinafter ""FUD"") movie (SPOILERS FOLLOW!!):

1) There is a 4-minute pre-opening credits scene that shows the incoming freshman cadets Lasky, Vickers, Sully, Chen, Silva, Tchakova and upperclassman Orenski either getting their heads shaved and/or delivering brief speeches regarding their purposes for joining CAMS.  The scene is juxtaposed with various training montages and shots of CAMS & UNSC military personnel.

2) The opening/closing credits are longer.

3) There is an approximately 4-minute blooper reel following the end credits.

And that's it!  Unfortunately, no added action scenes, gore, or extended clips of Master Chief.  If you've watched the webisodes, then you've watched the majority of the movie.

I've never been much of a Halo gaming fan, although I have always found the mythology fascinating.  I had high hopes for a Halo movie when Neill Blomkamp first directed the Halo 3: Landfall shorts.  FUD gives us a taste of what we can look forward to and I hope Microsoft acts quickly.  With the new Star Wars trilogy slated to be released in 2015+, perhaps there will be renewed demand for sci-fi movies.

Despite its low budget, FUD has high production values and good CGI.  Battlestar Galactica veterans like Mike Dopud (Specialist Gage) and Ty Olsson (Captain Kelly) make appearances as the superintendent of CAMS and an older Lasky, respectively.  The plotline is Starship Trooper-esque (the movie, not the book) formulaic.  Young group of cadets enroll in military academy, with certain fortuitous events occurring just before the main character decides to abandon his promising military career.  FUD builds up slowly before Master Chief is unveiled but it's an unforgettable entrance.  I appreciated FUD's attention to detail, such as showing falling bodies when the space tether was destroyed, Fred-104 in Master Chief's field of view, ODSTs dropping into battle, and Master Chief's emphasis on pistol usage.

I did have an issue with the end scene where Lasky acts as a decoy to save Master Chief and his fellow cadets.  I thought the point of FUD was to show Lasky's evolving maturity, but he only seemed like his usual reckless self.

Given FUD's internet popularity, I think this bodes well for a potential cinematic incarnation.",1353024000,51,2351,5.2520107238605895

With a game like halo being put into a movie format you worry if its just going to turn into a Michael Bay explosion fest. Which there is nothing wrong with that but it's over done. It was a pleasant surprise to see it not be focused the whole time on Master Chief. To anyone a fan of the series of Halo it is a must. If you never cared for the Halo games you need to step aside and still watch this movie because it's what needs to be done with all movies. This same high level of quality the only complaint that i had about it was sometimes too much slowmo segments. Glad to see they used the same voice actor from the original Halo games.

5315105,3,B009B8YZIK,"Forward Unto Dawn is a Halo 4 ""prequel"" live-action movie that sets things up for the Halo 4 game to give you a little more understanding about characters that will appear in Halo 4 and to give back story about the origins of the Covenant attacks on Earth.

Quality wise, it's pretty darn nice looking, but it isn't until the final act when things really ramp up, Master Chief makes his entrance and the battles take place.  Up until that point, we are presented with a pretty basic coming-of-age story of a group of young spoiled kids whose parents are rich dignitaries and social elites.  The main character can't stop thinking about his older brother, an OSDT, killed in battle.  The blossoming love story of two of the main characters, etc.  Honestly, it feels like I was watching a Beverly Hills 90210 episode, with all the sad expressions and angst.  They should have called this series ""HALO210"".

In the final act, the action ramps up, Master Chief blasts his way in to save what remains of the group so they can survive to grow older and take place in the events of Halo 4.

Technically it looks fantastic (with some slight obvious CGI elements) and once Master Chief shows up it's well done.

While I will be getting this because it's included in the Deluxe Edition of Halo 4, I will skip the first 60 or so minutes and fire up the chapters where Master Chief saves the day and when the action starts.  The rest belongs on the cutting room floor.

Great idea, good execution, horrible angst-filled story.",1351728000,8,1514,4.591078066914498

Only the fourth episode has aired so far, but will definately be watching the fifth have preordered the Bluray. Worth it even before the extra content, which hopefully continue to expound on the universe. Might even get me to consider playing the games now.

Update: I've seen all the episodes and extra content and yes, it's worth it. For the film makers out there it's interesting and amazing how they put this episodic film together and the detail of how they made it is intriguing. There is also plenty of Halo information for fans, it made me actually want to read up on the lore, which is something I never thought would happen. Overall it is a very well put together video whether you have been a Halo fan forever or are this is your first Halo experience.",1351641600,9,1112,4.419512195121952

As I had hoped a Halo movie would be, it's visually on par with Battlefield LA and District 9. Me and my wife have been waking up each Friday morning and watching the new episode first thing. I expected this to be low budget looking and it's Halo so who cares. The acting is completely believable, nothing I would roll my eyes at from overacting or silliness, and the CGI blew us away. It was done far better than I imagined it would be. I was skeptical about whether or not (trying to avoid spoilers here) ""certain things"" would be shown through CGI or not and when they were our jaws dropped for the rest of the episode. This is so good and a definite indication a good Halo movie can be done. 343 has done complete justice in keeping the fiction entertaining and we can't wait to see what the game is like. Please make more movies!!!!!",1351555200,,937,4.269662921348314

It's the Covenant attack on a UNSC military academy and segue for some key Halo 4 characters; A MUST FOR HALO FANS!",1507161600,2,385,4.746268656716418

8539309,5,B009B8YZIK,"I don't know why this movie got so many negative reviews. I, personally, LOVE this movie! My mom is in her late 50s, knows nothing about the Halo universe and has managed only in shooting clouds and her own feet in Combat Evolved, and she loves this movie! (I only had to pause a few times to explain random things; like what the 'tall, skyscraper thingy' is. LOL) My brother, who has only played Reach and is 'intimidated' when he watches me play the first games, fell in love with this movie as well! Both of them had the same reaction when John-117 (Master Chief) came onscreen, and the only negative thing they had to say was that he should have been in it for more than just the final half hour. Overall, if I could give this movie any higher a rating, I would do so.

I hope to see more positive reviews for this movie. To me, I never once thought that it started slow. I love getting to know Lasky (who appears in  Halo 4 & 5!), and the rest of Hastati Squad. I was intrigued by Lasky's personal development (in the beginning, he speaks out against the war and cannot envision himself as a soldier; yet after the loss of his friend--or girlfriend, if you will--he begins to see himself as a soldier at last); this last bit being driven home at the end when Master Chief addresses him as ""soldier"".

Now I'm going to finish this review with a little twist for all you non-Halo-playing peeps out there: Master Chief (and the rest of Blue Team) are only 15 years old in this movie! XD",1499558400,2,1488,4.307142857142857
