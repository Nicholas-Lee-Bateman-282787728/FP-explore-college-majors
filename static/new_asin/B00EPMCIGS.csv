5933421,4,B00EPMCIGS,"Sword Art Online (SAO) is about a group of 10,000 players who are trapped inside of an MMORPG.  They are unable to log out, and anyone who dies in the game dies in real life as well.  SAO aired in Fall 2012 in Japan, and was a very adamantly debated anime.  People either loved it or totally hated it.  The hate mostly stemmed from people expecting the show to be something other than what it was...  SAO is not a show about playing an MMORPG, neither is it about the people or culture who play MMO's.  The whole point of SAO is to investigate the question:  ""What do you do whenever the life you've built for yourself is taken away from you?""

What will you not see in SAO...  You will not see a bunch of epic boss battles.  There are some fights in the game, but these are really not even that big.  You will not see characters hunting, farming, or jumping up and down under a bridge in order to level their skills.  You will not see much of strategy meetings, or learn much about the game SAO itself.  This is not a show about playing a game.

What you will see in SAO are people.  There are three basic reactions by the characters to having their real lives taken away from them.  One group succumbs to despair.  One group fights as hard as they can to clear the game and get their lives back.  And one group starts to build a new life.  The show doesn't say much particularly profound.  It has a lot of time skips that force you to imagine how the characters develop, and there are a few Deus Ex Machina moments.  But SAO does a very good job of drawing you in, making you care about the characters, and forcing you to question whether you could start new life if everything you had were lost.

I should probably say that there is a second story arc of Sword Art Online as well.  Everything written above is about the first arc, which is the first 14 episodes of the series.  The second arc (11 episodes) takes place in another RPG, and the storytelling suffers from a lack of direction and has some serious pacing problems.  The first arc is a really good story, the second is pretty meh...

You should watch the first arc of SAO.  It is not a perfect story, and you may love or may hate it.  But it's a show that everyone should at least see.",1384992000,19,2249,4.215962441314554
5933422,5,B00EPMCIGS,Love this TV show. Highly recommend it to any anime fan. Had no idea that there was a plan for a combo release. I've currently collected all the aniplex versions of this (dubbed). Does anyone know if this release will be dubbed or not?,1384300800,3,235,4.363636363636363

8608176,1,B00EPMCIGS,"So expensive for so little. They break the series into 4 parts per season, making you spend 2x more than you'd regularly spend. If you buy the dvd overseas, rip em onto a hard drive you can watch em just fine. And that's cheaper. Netflix (maybe Amazon prime) has the first full season (25 episodes), so catch it while you can, because I'm sure they'll pull it quickly. And there's very little by way of extras... If you consider chapter stops and English cast scrolls ""extras""... oh, and forget about forced subtitles. This is the worst I've seen from the spiraling, horrible business of stateside anime and I urge you to vote with your pocketbook and forget about it. Or find it online, however you can.",1464998400,3,704,4.595238095238095

8608180,1,B00EPMCIGS,DON'T BUY THIS UNLESS YOU OWN A REGION B BLU-RAY PLAYER!!! It doesn't state on the page that you need one. I don't have any problem with the show and I can't say how good the product is since I'm unable to watch it as I have a region A blu-ray player. The fact that I can't play it because of something that wasn't stated on the page is my only problem with this product.,1406764800,19,371,3.96
