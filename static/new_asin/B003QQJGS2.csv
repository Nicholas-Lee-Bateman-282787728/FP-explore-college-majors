8402455,4,B003QQJGS2,"UFC production values are consistently good and this was a very good overall card, the main fight was quite exciting and was worth the hype.",1346371200,,140,4.64
8402456,5,B003QQJGS2,"The first thing to say about UFC 116 Lesnar Vs Carwin is that after the event UFC president Dana White awarded 2 fight of the night bonuses(after each ufc event there is bonuses given for fight of the night, submission of the night and knockout of the night)that should be enough to tell you what kind of card UFC 116 was and that's not even mentioning the biggest heavyweigh battle in history between UFC champion Brock Lesnar and Interim Heavyweight champion(the interim title was created while they waited for Brock to recover from illness) Shane Carwin.

Both fight of the night matches were well worth their bonuses especially considering the Yoshihro Akiyama vs Chris Leben fight which was only put together with 2 weeks notice as Akiyama's original opponent Wanderlei Silva had to pull out and Chris Leben who had fought Aaron Simpson at the season 11 ultimate Fighter finale 2 weeks earlier stepped in at very short notice, the other fight of the night is between Stephan Bonnar and Krzystof Soszynski which is a bloody affair and not for the faint hearted. the main card also includes a solid opener between George Sotiropoulos and Kurt Pellegrino.

The Heavyweight title clash between Brock Lesnar and Shane Carwin is one of the most dramatic heavyweight battles UFC has seen and even watching it again will have you on the edge of your seat as these are two heavyweights not content to sit back and circle the Octogan, it's an all out war.

With this two disc dvd set you get the complete undercard as well as the always excellent countdown show, which you should probably watch first if you haven't seen the event, the full weigh in show is also included and there's some behind the scenes footage as well as the usual fighter interviews, as usual the commentary by Mike Goldberg and Joe Rogan(not everyone's cup of tea but very informative) is enjoyable.

Considering in the build up to this event most people were only looking forward to one fight and with a lot of fighters pulling out due to injury and personal reasons, UFC 116 for exceeded anyone's expectations and if you only buy the odd UFC dvd make sure this is top of your list!",1299024000,,2151,4.69761273209549
8402457,5,B003QQJGS2,"Brock Lesnar is huge. And he is a champion who doesn't care what you think about him. And he most certainly doesn't care what Shane Carwin thinks about him. Brock won his rematch against Frank Mir and UFC 100, and was chastened after his post-fight interview, drinking a Bud Lite at the press conference. He's convinced that Shane Carwin will not take this belt from him. Shane Carwin is a heavy hitter, and has never been out of the first round, due to his heavy hands! He showed that power against Frank Mir at UFC 111, and took Mir right out. Carwin feels that although Brock is the champion, he needs to act like a champion. Well, with an Interim Heavyweight Championship Belt, he wants the real belt! Is Brock gonna go down at the hands of Shane Carwin like everybody else? This is the Main Event for UFC 116!

The Co-Main Event features 2 Middleweights. Yoshihiro Akiyama was supposed to take on Wanderlei Silva. But Wanderlei pulled out. And in to take his place is Chris Leben. Chris won only a couple weeks before this fight against Aaron Simpson, and he doesn't care how soon it is, he's taking this fight! He's determined to take out Akiyama! Now, is the hype behind Akiyama for real? He took a hotly contested split decision over Alan Belcher at UFC 100. How's that going to work for him in this fight?

Well, some claimed that this was overhyped. Ok, just maybe a little. But I still enjoyed all the fights on it! There are 11 fights, and I'll list 'em below!

Karlos Vemola vs. Jon Madsen: A wild and crazy striker who loves the KO takes on a man who knows how to win. Rogan said this was a GREAT performance for the winner, although he did just enough to take a unanimous decision!

Daniel Roberts vs. Forrest Petz: Roberts came up short against ""Doomsday"" Howard, yet put up a scrap before the end. Petz has never had the best of luck in the UFC, despite being a great striker. This is an interesting scrap that goes to a split decision!

Gerald Harris vs. Dave Branch: This was an interesting chess match, and then, BOOM!!! Just wait until you see this sweet KO by slam in the 3rd round! I loved it!

Kendall Grove vs. Goran Reljic: Shooting off his mouth cost Grove a spot on the Spike card for this event. But The Ultimate Fighter winner takes on a man who loves a good fight. This could be a controversial split decision, and it saved the winner's butt from getting cut!

Seth Petruzelli vs. Ricardo Romero: ""Silverback,"" or ""Kimbo Killer,"" Petruzelli is invited back to the UFC! Making his debut is a man who knows how to bring it. And one of these guys pulls off a submission in the 2nd round after taking a beating!

Brendan Schaub vs. Chris Tushscherer: The TUF runner-up redeemed himself quickly with a quick KO of Chase Gormley. ""The Crowbar,"" on the other hand, counted his blessings at UFC 109 with a MAJORITY decision that Rogan thought was horrible. Well, this time there is a rather quick ending with a quick TKO in the 1st round!

George Sotiropoulos vs. Kurt Pelligrino: Every time these guys fight, they bring it 110%, and this fight is no different. Great fight, that goes to a unanimous decision!

Krzysztof Soszynski vs. Stephan Bonnar: Well, at UFC 110, the first match-up ended in controversy. This time, there is none, as a 2nd round TKO is well earned!

Chris Lytle vs. Matt Brown: These guys always bring it, and a fight with Lytle is almost a guaranteed FIGHT OF THE NIGHT! Well, this is a great fight, and an awesome submission is pulled off in the 2nd round.

Yoshihiro Akiyama vs. Chris Leben: WOW!! All you can say in the end is that the man left standing has a warrior's heart! A 3rd round submission, and tons of respect!

Brock Lesnar vs. Shane Carwin: In a way, I don't know whether to be impressed, or to simply roll my eyes. One man got the snot beat out of him, only to pull off the most weary, sleepy submission EVER in the 2nd round! The action was good though.

So, the Main Event might have ended in somewhat silly fashion, but not because it was a boring fight. And this is an event worth watching!",1299024000,,4057,4.442799461641992
8402458,4,B003QQJGS2,"The Brock Lesnar vs. Shane Carwin fight was one of the best heavyweight fights of the year. It was definately the fight of UFC 116. Carwin was knocking everyone out in the first round and Brock Lesnar is a beast!!

8402459,4,B003QQJGS2,"I watched this live because I was very curious about who was going to take the #1 Heavyweight spot.  Overall, this is a great event if you love action packed bouts.  The main card included the following bouts:

George Sotiropoulos vs. Kurt Pellegrino (Lightweight bout)

This one is pretty fast paced, as you would expect from Lightweights.  Sotiropoulos is a Jiu-Jitsu ace with some good boxing.  Pelligrino has more of a wrestling style.  This is a pretty cool match-up and there are a couple of points in the fight (especially towards the end) that make you think, ""Wow!""

Krzysztof Soszynski vs. Stephan Bonnar

The immediate rematch after the terrible call from their last fight.  If you saw their first meeting, you'd know that these guys bring it.  This fight is very action packed and finally settles the score between these two.

Chris Lytle vs. Matt Brown

Chris Lytle can spice up any card you put in on.  Matt Brown is always slick. especially with the stand-up.  This one definitely does not go the distance.  See an award worthy finish.

Yoshihiro Akiyama vs. Chris Leben

Chris Leben was put in this fight with less than two weeks notice, replacing Wanderlei Silva who was removed due to an injury.  Leben had just fought two weeks prior, but the guy's a warrior.  Akiyama is no joke, and he is definitely the toughest fighter that Leben has faced in a long time.  See why this fight deservingly received the Fight of the Night award.

Brock Lesnar vs. Shane Carwin for the UFC Heavyweight belt

All I can say is wow.  The only thing that this fight proved to me was that neither of these guys are anywhere close to being the #1 Heavyweight in the MMA world.  I understand the importance of Lesnar in bringing in casual fans, but this fight, while entertaining, is quite short in terms of skill set for both fighters.  Still, there are a lot of people who enjoy this sort of thing from a casual standpoint, and I do respect that.  It does not go the distance and there is still a lot of action.  I simply do not think the winner of this is the world's #1 Heavyweight.

There you have it. I collect UFC dvds, so I already have this pre-ordered, but if you were wondering whether or not this is a solid event, I can say that it is definitely worth it and a much better card than say, UFC 111, 112, or 114 overall.",1280448000,6,2326,4.484486873508353
8402460,5,B003QQJGS2,"Well worth the buy, I watched this at a packed sport's bar and had a bet going that Lesnar would win. The 1st round had me nervous but man Brock's the champ for a reason. This ppv had a lot of good fights on it and leaves you waiting until Brock defends the title again.",1280188800,2,270,3.9272727272727272
