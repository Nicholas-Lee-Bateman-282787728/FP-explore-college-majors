It's the story of a girl who is adopted and at 17 finds out her grandfather is the richest business man in Taiwan. And so continues her life and the difficulties. I have to say very entertaining, even for us westerners who don't always get Chinese humor.

The bad is that the girl's parents are relatively bad actors, but they at least don't have much part in the series past the 1st episode. Also, I think it was partially flimed in a hotel to give it the feeling of overboard extravagance, but ends up looking fake in parts. All in all, I would say the great writing, acting by the main characters, and the plot far out way the bad. Go for it. It's one of the better ones I've seen!",1238371200,,876,4.177514792899408
