8075362,1,B000A7B5XE,"I agree with Daniel - this video is a waste.  And so was the money I wasted on the arc barrel.  The video is exactly as reviewed - a tutorial for trainers and not useful for the home Pilates enthusiast.  Moreover it is not a ""workout"" but a documentary as Moira takes her students through a short variety of stretches.  I could not accurately adjust myself on the barrel at home, or I kept sliding off of it.  Moreover, Moira shows most exercises on one side only.

The barrel itself was a waste of money.  I can't find any trustworthy resources to help me utilize it and it sits around the house.  I can't even unload it for 1/25 of what I paid for it!!  My husband calls it ""The Hump.""  The most activity I get from it is moving it to vacuum.",1245196800,4,744,4.13986013986014
8075363,1,B000A7B5XE,"This is not a workout dvd, it is more of an instructional video on how to teach and perform arc barrel exercises. These exercises are not challenging, some require an assistant, and I never even came close to breaking a sweat.  I have a very problematic lower back and this dvd promised to ""strengthen and stretch core muscles, support and realign the spine, rehab and prevent injury, enhance athletic performance, and relieve back pain"" all of which I need and NONE OF WHICH IT WILL DELIVER. AS far as I'm concerned Moira Merrithew owes me my money back.",1200268800,5,555,4.663265306122449
