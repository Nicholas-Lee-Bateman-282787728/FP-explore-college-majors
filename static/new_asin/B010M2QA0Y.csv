7313680,5,B010M2QA0Y,This is a wonderful DVD to help kindergarten age children learn about 2-dimension and 3-dimension shapes and some other math concepts that can be confusing at this age. I have every DVD Leap Frog has and continually rotate them in my kindergarten class during our snack/quiet time for my visual learners. It literally helps all my students. You won't be disappointed with any of their DVDs!,1454284800,4,390,4.924242424242424

7313683,5,B010M2QA0Y,"Since we got this DVD two weeks ago, my kids have been watching it more than 30 times. This is not to mention that they have been watching these Leap Frog DVD series many many times before on Netflix. It would be great if Amazon could get theses on their Amazon Videos too. Anyhow, my kids have truly been growing up with all the Leapfrog series, and the result is that they are more academically advanced than most of the kids their ages. Totally worth the money spent on buying these series because it both educational and fun.",1449273600,3,529,4.408163265306122
7313684,5,B010M2QA0Y,"My son loves this DVD and asks to play it over and over again. Tad, Lily, and friends go on an adventure to find the missing shapes to Professor Quigly's shape machine. There adventure looks very similar to an Indiana Jones - type of adventure. They first talk about 2D shapes and then they go on to discover 3D shapes: cylinder, cube, sphere, and my son's favorite: the octahedron. They have to solve puzzles to find the next shape clue. In doing so, the videos teaches concepts about fractions as well. Leap Frog did a good job with this one in my opinion. It was enough of a plot to keep you entertained. Professor Quigly never even appears in this movie... He has somehow mysteriously gone away, but his robot and his office remain. I liked that the Professor wasn't in this one because sometimes his presence can make the movie a tad bit baby and cheesy. I would recommend this film for ages 3.5 to 6 and at that age, the cheesy baby stuff gets a bit old.",1447632000,5,960,4.368715083798882

7313689,4,B010M2QA0Y,"I'm happy to let you know about a DVD for children which LeapFrog sent me in exchange for my review . . . Letter Factory Adventures - The Great Shape Mystery!

Letter Factory Adventures: Great Shape Mystery
Produced by - LeapFrog/LionsGate
Ages - 3-6

Favorite Features -

Return of favorite LeapFrog characters - Leap, Lily and Tad
Helps children learn about shapes, fractions and measurements
Fun mystery story children will enjoy
LeapFrog says; ""Join the LeapFrog friends as they discover fun, learning-filled adventure comes in all shapes and sizes in the new Letter Factory Adventures. There's a new machine at the Letter Factory, but no one knows what it's supposed to do! With only a map and a few clues, Leap, Lily and Tad set out to unlock the machine's secret, embarking on an amazing journey which will teach them about shapes, fractions and measurements and give them the tools they need to solve the Great Shape Mystery! Children will use their mathematics  knowledge to solve the mystery and learn along with their friends to connect what they see in the video with the world around them.""

My grandsons enjoyed this DVD and had fun showing their knowledge of math as they worked through the math problems in the dvd. I think it is a fun way to help children understand how to use math in regards to shapes, fractions and measurements. They will also have fun seeing where the LeapFriends end up and how they got there!

My grandsons, especially Caleb (age 4) and Shane (age 2) really enjoy LeapFrog videos. They enjoy the characters and learn from the stories. As grandma, I'm able to let them watch these videos knowing they will enjoy them and learn at the same time. This new story is a great addition to other LeapFrog videos; while the story is new, the learning is not! Fun and learning - a great combination and something we have come to expect from LeapFrog!",1442707200,,1881,4.719512195121951

7313707,1,B010M2QA0Y,Absolutely terrible! The characters look different from the Letter Factory and Talking Words Factory.  My 3 year old prefers the other two videos. Leap Frog missed the mark with this one and if I could give it zero stars I would.,1473984000,,229,4.585365853658536

I only had the option of 3 other apps I've barely heard of (Flixter, Vudu, and something else I can't even remember.) I bought this one specifically because my daughter loves the Leapfrog movies and I wanted her to have this one on her iPad for road trips when we don't have wifi. But everything else we own is on iTunes, so if I had realized I couldn't put it there, I would have skipped this and gotten something else.",1473811200,2,525,4.207920792079208

8722639,5,B010M2QA0Y,My son is a four year old nonverbal autistic. LeapFrog is heaven-sent. This movie alone he watches over and over and over again and this has been for years. I love the songs and that they actually engage your child. There is constant learning and he now knows what a circle is. We own all of the LeapFrog DVDs and will probably never get rid of them. If you are in doubt what to get your child's definitely get them on LeapFrog,1503360000,,427,4.219512195121951
