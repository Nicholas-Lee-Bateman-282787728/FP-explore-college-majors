8282274,4,B001B8WO22,"A quintaessential noir thriller --with femme fatale and everything- ""La Senal"" is a tour de force in terms of ambiance reproduction. The recreation of Argentina in 1952 -down to the last detail- is outstanding.
Very aptly, the plot follows the conventions of the genre and the 1950's films: the leads are two private detectives; one of them gets himself involved with a gorgeous female client who is associated with the wrong people... You get the idea.
All this framed within the last days of Eva Peron's life. As Peronism encompassed the whole Argentine society, here one of the detectives is a loyal Peronist supporter, while the other is far more skeptic.
In more ways than one, a must see film, in particular to anyone interested in visualizing how 1950's Buenos Aires was.

***Spoilers***
Just to be clever, a few criticisms: charming and seductive as it is, this story could easily be situated in present day Argentina (or elsewhere) without any loss of form or substance. The 1950's reconstruction seems more like a show-off of production values or a gimmick than a real need. Also, everything connected with Pern and Evta's demise is just coincidental to the story, but irrelevant in any other way.
My second objection is that the plot, though impeccable, is extremely simple and bidimensional. The hero is induced to do risky things by an Argentine version of a Barbara Stanwick's character and guess what? He gets hurt. No twists.
A good film, nevertheless.",1289520000,,1468,4.967479674796748
