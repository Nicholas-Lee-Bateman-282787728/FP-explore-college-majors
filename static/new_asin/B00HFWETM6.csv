title promises ""2 documentaries"", and, technically, there
A-R-E two, but---like ""Aliens"" & ""Bladerunner""---there're
different [length] VERSIONS of the SAME documentary.
___________________________________________
* The first one is the 2006 (52 minute), edited down one.
* The second, is the 1992 (84 minute), hosted by Darren
{Christmas Story}McGavin.

---The video and audio are excellent.
---The French satelite data is the most current evidence,
with the most-recent, on-the-ground testimony being from
the '50s and '60s.
---The mountain in question IS on the border with Turkey,
Iraq and Iran... 'nough SAID, there!",1411171200,5,723,6.313131313131313

6162063,5,B00HFWETM6,"This documentary is extremely in  alignment of the Bible.

With incredible Biblical artifacts surfacing, one must know God truly exists.  Just look at the history of the pyramids and the actual builders of the pyramids...it leaves your mind in total awe.

Your entire family will find this documentary simply rewarding with breathtaking evidence.

Don't miss this opportunity.

You will enjoy it!",1400198400,13,396,5.409836065573771

6162073,1,B00HFWETM6,"Wow... I can't imagine that very many of the people who rated this on Amazon have actually watched it unless they were involved in the production or something.  I would consider myself a pretty solid believer who is generally very impressed by the physical and historical evidences for the Christian faith, but I wasn't very impressed with this plastic jewel to say the least!  In fact, this was by far the worst documentary I have ever seen because it had the lowest standard of discerning evidence that I have ever seen in a documentary and it was just brutal to watch because I kept waiting and waiting for a remotely decent picture of the ark, but it never came despite dozens of people who claimed to have clearly seen it.  It was like listening to a Darwinist trying to explain how the biochemical process of blood-clotting could have come about without the hand of a creator - there was nothing there!

After seeing a few very high-quality evidence-filled documentaries that support Biblical account like 'The Search for the Real Mount Sinai', and 'The Star of Bethlehem' (you know, where they actually find things!), my expectations were pretty high for this film, but this ""dual-feature"" (2 different edits almost entirely made up of the exact same footage) fell very far short of finding anything... it's like they were given a budget, they didn't find anything, and they made the film anyway.  I'm not saying it is reasonable to expect that we should be able to find a 5,000+ year old in tact wooden boat, and I'm not saying we haven't or won't find better evidence... what I am saying is this documentary isn't it  don't waste your money!  I know its cheap, but don't do it... if you do, make sure you write a review!

My primary frustration with this film is an extremely gullible oversight that is present the entire time.  Here's the premise: if I'm hearing this presentation correctly, Im expected to believe that hundreds of people are going out of their way to intentionally seek this enormous ancient relic a few dozen individuals find it but somehow none of those who claimed to have seen it up close ever thought ""hmmm... maybe I should bring a camera with me"", or even worse... of the people who did bring a camera with them, why are all the pictures so far away that nothing can be seen at all... the ship is huge and the rest of the hike in the pictures looks like a picnic?  Why hike all that way, and go home only a mile away from the ancient marvel?  At least 2 or 3 of the ""eye-witnesses"" interviewed only saw it by from planes and fighter jets... Look!  Look over there!  It's Noah's Ark!  Back to the camera thing, I wonder what percentage of people reading this have a camera in their pocket or purse right now, and hikers often have some of the best cameras money can buy.

As if this were not suspicious enough to me, many of the interviewed ""witnesses"" expressed almost zero passion or conviction for what they had supposedly seen, and I was also noticing some pretty strong signals that made me think many (if not most) of the interviewees knew they were lying... others in the film were clearly reading off cue cards.  Compelling stuff.  My very solid Christian wife noticed all of the same things which makes me wonder who could possibly be giving this film positive reviews.  Me and my wife are very level-headed, and my wife is much more discerning than I when it comes to people, so I trust her opinions about this stuff more than I trust my own, so, yes, it is really that bad in terms of credibility.

As an ex-atheist and an ex-Darwinist once well established in the prior thinking, I can confidently say that the evidences for the Christian faith (and especially Creationism/Intelligent Design) are not hard to come by and I do feel they are the most sound conclusion from the major options, but this documentary deserves no mention whatsoever in terms of evidence.  To be intellectually gullible is what this film requires because of the oops I forgot my camera syndrome in dozens of current day witnesses sorry, but no just, no.  80% of normal people would have a camera on them 90% of hikers would have a camera on them and probably about 99% of people who go searching for proof of a giant 5,000+ year old ship might just bring a camera.  Is my filter too fine, or does this sound about right?

The Search for the Real Mount Sinai is very good The Star of Bethlehem was surprisingly good although not nearly as entertaining but if you are set on seeing this, make sure you write a review after you do so the next guy is a little less likely to make the same mistake.  I feel weird being so negative in a review, but I simply do not feel that this film is even trying to be honest, and I also am reasonably confident that they haven't found anything yet, so why make the film?",1429574400,18,4823,4.523590333716916

6162078,5,B00HFWETM6,"I used this broken into four weeks with adults in our local church. They loved it. Many had no idea of the physical evidence of the ark which is much a part of Christian and world history. Two versions of the documentary on the DVD. Choosing the right square [instead of the left] takes you to a longer, more comprehensive version without an unsubstantiated discussion about the body of Adam.",1422403200,4,392,4.614285714285714
