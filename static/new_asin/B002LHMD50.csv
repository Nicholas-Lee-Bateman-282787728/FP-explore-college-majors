3948181,2,B002LHMD50,"In reading other reviews I see there might be another version of this movie, but this version on Prime carries a terrible English translation in its captions.  So bad, that you will often find yourself editing what you're reading, and at other times, you'll have no idea what's being said.  Whomever wrote the captions for this had English as a fourth language.  Words are misused, contexts are wrong, and the literal translations make no sense.

If there is another version of this movie with the proper caption, be sure to see that one.  The movie actually has charm, humor, a decent plot, and likable leads.  If not for the poor captioning, I would give this movie 3-4 stars.  Hopefully, this verison will be removed and the better translated one used to replace it.  Worth seeing, but beware of the frustation in its poor captioning.",1365552000,,837,4.763888888888889
3948182,4,B002LHMD50,"Having watched the Korea drama inspired by this movie, it only made sense to find and watch the film. I wasn't disappointed. While not quite slap-stick, it's definitely a tongue-in-cheek spy thriller. I've watched the female lead in other projects and enjoyed her role equally here. Though comedy, the characters were still drawn in a believable fashion and the plot was interesting. The translated title is a bit off base, it should have been 7th Grade Civil Servant, as was the title of the (previously mentioned) series. But I'll excuse that since marketing demands are different for film and television.

Overall, I was pleased with the movie and enjoyed the storytelling. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a few laughs and a relaxed viewing experience.",1365033600,8,764,5.063492063492063

The subtitles, picture, audio and overall quality of this version are perfect. Amazon links both products to the same reviews, which is messed up.

This was such a funny movie I was cracking up in my seat, then I told my wife to watch it and she thought it was really funny as well.  It's a comedy action flick with slapstick style Asian humor.  I thought the acting and directing was actually pretty good.  Since I was on a long flight, maybe this movie seemed better than it really was, but I did thoroughly enjoy it.

3948203,5,B002LHMD50,"The story starts as the hero is about to leave Korea for a job abroad who waits for his girlfriend at the airport until he has to go. Unknown to him however, is the fact that she is a top agent for the secret service internal security section and she is on the job, so she doesn't get his message until it's too late, and she rushes to the airport to see him and is restrained by security screaming his name as his plane takes off. Several years later they meet again but he is now a rookie agent for the secret service foreign section. They both restart their romance while keeping secret from each other the true nature of their jobs. Add in the fact that both sections are investigating the same case without telling each other, and both our heroes thinking that the other could be a criminal, and you end up with a nice little screwball comedy with some good stunts and pratfalls. The hero bumbles through the action yet has a keen mind for detection and risks all for the woman he loves, while the heroine is lethal and smart but wants to bring him in herself because she cannot believe the man she loves could do this and if he has she will get him.
This film is great. It's funny with a nice bit of action and comedy in a pool of romance. What else could you ask for?",1453420800,,1274,4.204081632653061

3948205,5,B002LHMD50,"This movie was so funny that I snorted up my hot cocoa up through my nose!

You can't help but feel sorry for the male lead -- what a sap!

The female lead, the always excellent and cute Ha-neul Kim, does a really good job with stringing along two guys (her long-time boyfriend and rookie NIS agent as well as a milquetoast South Korean businessman). Her action scenes are well-done and this film was better than two other of her films, ""Lovers of 6 Years"" and ""You Are My Pet"", that I have seen.

Overall, I can understand why this was the #4 film in South Korea in 2009.

Lots of action and the film moves along nicely.

I agree with another reviewer that the subtitles are messed up. Whoever was in charge of the subtitles need a rope around their necks. FAST. Better, brush up on your Korean, maggots!

Enjoy!

3948223,4,B002LHMD50,"Somewhere between romance and comedy Korean cinema lies the hard to classify MY GIRLFRIEND IS AN AGENT. Director Terra Shin creates a cinematic universe in which evil exists but only in a watered down state so as to provide the traction that forms the backdrop for a fusion of romantic slapstick. Ha Neul Kim is Soo-Ji , a secret agent of the Korean NIS who also happens to love a nerdy Jae-Joon (Ji-Hwan Kang). Jae-Joon simply refuses to accept what he sees as a never ending series of lies that Soo-Ji is forced to tell to hide her real life job.  He breaks up with her in a rage and the action skips ahead three years when they meet again. Unknown to her Jae-Joon joins the very same Korean spy service as the most bumbling of rookies. The comedy revolves around neither one knowing the true state of the other's profession.

Into this bumbling universe of misread identity signals is the diluted element of the threat of bio-terrorism. A Russian cabal of villains has stolen a virus that has the potential to kill millions. The viewer, of course, does not take this threat seriously enough to endanger the delicate balance that director Shin has struck between slapstick farce and an equally slapstick love rivalry. MY GIRLFRIEND IS AN AGENT is not meant to be more than a divertingly brief detour for the viewer to laugh at even as that viewer willingly suspends disbelief often enough for the plot to be taken at face value. One has a tendency to equate this film with a similarly themed American version with Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt but MY GIRLFRIEND IS AN AGENT aims somewhat lower on the believability scale. Still, Ha Neul Kim and Ji-Hwan Kang have a terrific chemistry that keeps you interested in a plot that defies rationality. This film was a huge hit in Korea in 2009 and even now one can appreciate why.",1422316800,4,1824,4.609230769230769

3948230,3,B002LHMD50,"My sole Korean-speaking swag consists of my knowing the original title of this 2009 movie: Chilgeup gongmuwon. For western audiences the title is either 7th Grade Civil Servant or My Girlfriend is an Agent (pick your preference). Chilgeup gongmuwon made a huge impression on the Korean box office, never mind that, for me, this was only a 3 out of 5 stars flick. It's hit or miss, more hit than miss.

As always with foreign-language cinema, I recommend that you watch it with the original language playing and read the English sub-titles. It's rare that I'm down with English dubbing. This one does lift a page from Mr. & Mrs. Smith but there's also a whiff of True Lies. Anh Soo Ji (Ha-Neul Kang) is a savvy covert operative who has to keep lying to her boyfriend to maintain her cover. That poor sap, Lee Jaejung (Ji-Hwan Kang), finally gets fed up with Anh Soo Ji's falsehoods, and he dumps her and amscrays to Canada to study international accounting. Because that's what you do when your heart gets all broke.

Three years go by before the ex-lovers bump into each other, and in a men's restroom (don't ask). Festering emotions boil over; there's a huge row, and you think that's that. But then they keep running into each other, with Anh Soo Ji still persisting in pretense. But here's a shift in the ""relationship"": Lee Jaejung is now a fledgling spy for another espionage agency. So now they're both pushing a masquerade.

The film's McGuffin revolves around a deadly weaponized chemical agent coveted by the Russian mob. What are the odds that both our characters get mixed up in this? (Odds are good.)

2009's Chilgeup gongmuwon was popular enough that it inspired a television series in 2013. I thought both the lead actors were fine, and they generate a good spark between them. Ji-Hwan Kang toes a more delicate balance as he's portrayed as the more comic of the two roles (Ha-Neul Kang lands the more standard, play-it-straight part). Ji-Hwan Kang at times will remind you of an anime or manga character. He's got this tendency to shriek in girly high pitch whenever he's in jeopardy. Where his ex is an experienced secret agent, Ji-Hwan Kang's rookie spy is a bit of a goof-up who is often berated by his immediate superior. His undercover scenes make for some pretty, um, curious capers. I grinned quite a bit because the poor sap was endearing, even though I did get frustrated with how bumbling he was. I don't know why but it cracked me up that he had to have a different password for each of his computer file. It sure drove his immediate superior batty.

So I would say that Chilgeup gongmuwon succeeds with the comedy bits, is less than successful with the action bits. Several stunts could've been choreographed better, like the silly fencing and jet ski sequences. The script is scattershot. Thankfully, there's enough of what's solid in the interactions between the two leads that I could put up with the nonsense portions of the film.",1398470400,4,2961,4.71953578336557
