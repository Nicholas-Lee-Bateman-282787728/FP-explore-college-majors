7799955,5,1598036378,Superb intro to psychology. I am 75 and know the subject quite well and low tolerance for boredom but this exceeded my expectations. Hinshaw is a top Berkeley professor and an excellent speaker who knows the field very well and will get you up to speed on most of the important topics in the field. One of best purchases I ever made! Will wait a year or two and watch it again. Like all the Great Courses it has a book with it.,1480291200,5,427,4.156626506024097
