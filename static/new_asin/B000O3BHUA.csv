8182719,3,B000O3BHUA,"I found this workout helpful, but only because I'd studied, and practiced a little bit, the very nicely-explained book on Ashtanga Yoga by Beryl Bender-Birch, called  ""Power Yoga.""
If not for that, I would have been totally confused, and possibly injured myself.
This tape is fairly helpful if you already have some knowledge about Ashtanga Yoga,  but for a good introduction to a challenging workout,  try the ""Crunch""
tapes ""The Joy of Yoga"" and ""Fat -Burning Yoga"" by the lovely and unpretentious Sarah Ivanhoe.",1026000000,4,514,5.095238095238095
8182720,5,B000O3BHUA,"This BPYI yoga video ROCKS! From start to finish the viewer will be challenged again and again by Baron's ""be here now"" style of teaching. Setting it up nicely he explains the four key elements of ashtanga yoga:ujjayi breathing,uddiyana & mulla locks,drishti(soft gaze), and vinyasa (or flowing postures). This video is a little different from level 2. He is not inducing as much trance and spiritual psychology as he is leading you through the sequences and linking all the key elements together paying impeccable attention to rhythmic breath. If you've ever wondered what vinyasa and ashtanga are all about this video will reveal those hidden truths to you. For advanced students and yoga teachers. WARNING:this video contains exciting and highly addictive material. Not for the weak-spined!",1018742400,17,793,5.301587301587301
