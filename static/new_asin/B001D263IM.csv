8291052,3,B001D263IM,"""The Haunted Castle"" is easily the better known of these two films, so I want to concentrate on ""Wolfblood.""

I'd start by saying that the ""Alpha"" version should be avoided, and that if you want to actually purchase this film, you should try to locate the 35 mm tinted print issued by Grapevine Video. However, even that might not be advisable unless you're either (1) a silent film buff, or (2) a horror film completest.

Being slightly charitable, one could say ""Wolfblood"" is an early werewolf film, though the subject is treated from a material rather than supernatural perspective and isn't even articulated until about two-thirds into the film. There's a reference to the ""loup garou"" legend at one point, auguring more distilled presentations of the theme in later decades. However, there are no physical transformations; instead, when a man is given a transfusion by a doctor drawing blood from a wolf, the speculation (which turns out to be rumor and autosuggestion rather than fact) is that the man's ""character"" rather than physical form will be changed.

Ergo, anyone expecting to come upon a furry mutant like Larry Talbot  will be disappointed. The closest approximation is a few scenes showing wolves (in translucent double exposure) loping through Canadian woods in leisurely packs and without apparent malevolence.

To repeat: this is a ""werewolf"" film only marginally, and is more important as a harbinger than as a full-fledged exploration of lycanthropy. In any case, it would be more effective if this theme had taken center stage near the beginning of the film rather than near the end. As it is, the bulk of the plot revolves around the rivalry of two Canadian logging entrepreneurs, along with a romance  involving a businesswoman (a status rather surprising given that women during this period were rarely portrayed in anything but socially subordinate roles).

""Wolfblood,"" in short, is a hodgepodge of themes. It has the kernel of a fascinating concept, but neither the novelist who provided the source nor the directors of the film seemed to know what to do with it. Because it fails to explore supernatural possibilities or implications, we're left with a feeling that most of the punches (and all of the fangs) have been pulled.

It took later films like ""The Werewolf of London"" and, of course, ""The Wolfman"" to delve into genuine shape-shifting territory. Nevertheless, ""Wolfblood"" is an interesting curio which, despite its  structural weaknesses, probably inspired later films in the genre. I wouldn't advise true horror fans to buy it, but if you can find a rental or online copy, it's worth a look.",1393459200,,2634,5.050691244239632
8291053,3,B001D263IM,"First the movie is poorly named. I thought I was going to be watching a 1921 version of a horror film or a haunted house movie. . Hardly!. The entire movie seems like it was copied from a VHS recording...I've heard other people says that about other movies I thought were just fine, but this was pretty bad. It does have a unique feature in that the dialogue cards are in both German and English, so it is a way to learn German a little bit anyway. But the whole movie was fuzzy and poor contrast and difficult and tiring to watch. And difficult to comprehend to some extent. They refer to some ""jokes"" the principal character is playing and I scratch my head...""Jokes?"" Is this the 1921 version of hi jinx? They used a word ""Allusions"" which isn't in my dictionary. Perhaps the translation is off? The music was pretty bland piano. It was melodramatic, well at least the girl seemed ridiculously melodramatic if no one else was. Then it was over and I'm a bit lost. I did catch onto it as time went on, and in fact in hind sight it is a bit clever. But it was just so difficult to watch, I don't know if I want to watch it again, except maybe on a different TV where I can adjust the contrast. . I have to give this movie a 2 stars at best..I could see it being a 3 star with a better example.of the movie but I just seemed to be straining to view it the entire show.

Fortunately there was a bonus feature as this sure needed one.
Even before I watched the second Bonus movie I thought it just had to be better than the first and would probably salvage the DVD.... Boy it was that in spades!

 The back-up Bonus movie ""Wolf Blood"". DO NOT READ THE MOVIE DESCRIPTION on the box for this movie! it gives 90% of the entire story away!  fortunately I did not read it and fortunately I miss-read the time on the box so when I thought the bonus movie was going to be over soon it just kept going on! In fact the bonus movie was longer than the main feature! It was also a bit fuzzy like a VHS recorded flick, but much easier to view with much better contrast, though at times the faces were quite washed out in the bright sun light shots but all the action was fairly easily viewed. , and the movie was great! First it had that neat silent era make-up on the hero, which gave it a neat flavour right off the bat. Frankly It should have been the feature movie! It wasn't until after I thought the movie was supposed to be ending did I even figure out why it was given that title! It just was a complete surprise to see where this was going. I mean it was a crime and a romance and a... sci-fi? so I was just completely in the dark as to where it was going and I won't tell you! But the back up movie definitely makes this disk worth buying. The two movies average out to a 3 star, but the first is a 2 star and this is a 4 star only because the quality of the reproduction was a bit low, but definitely a pleasant surprise.",1392163200,,2918,4.096153846153846
8291054,1,B001D263IM,"I purchased this due to Amazon's statement that this Haunted Castle is 90 minutes long. That's incorrect, it's only 55. There are currently collector's copies in circulation with a much better picture that run 72 minutes. Kino is scheduled to release a restored 80 minute version in March, I strongly suggest waiting.

The only reason I bought this was due to Amazon's statement of the 90 minute run time; don't let it happen to you!

I consider the picture quality of Haunted Castle unwatchable, even by Alpha's low standards & Wolf Blood is only slightly better.",1228435200,2,564,4.864583333333333
8291055,3,B001D263IM,"I was initially very excited about the release of these two rare silent classics,and quickly made an order of this DVD.
Alpha DVD is a budget line,and i've always respected them for there releasing of rare,seldom seen classics like The Student of Prague(1926).
Quality is often mixed on there DVDs but.....geez.
It's pretty bad here,folks.
The Haunted Castle(1921) suffers from a horrible digital alteration that makes the print virtually unwatchable.
It's not helped by mediocre scoring,and the fact that it's a slow drama.
Horror fans reading the title and seeing Murnau's name attached will find interest,but this is NOT a genre title.
There is some nice atmosphere,which could have been made more by appropiate tinting(i've seen scenes of this on Kino DVDs and it's a shame...there what made me want to SEE this film).
One scene that stands out,and certainly predates Murnau's Nosferatu(1922) is a nightmare scene involving a large clawed  hand reaching into a bedroom window to grab a screaming man!
In need of better restoration.
The second film is the fascinating,""Wolf Blood"" from 1925.
A bizarre melodrama about the foreman of a logging company who is severely injured and a local doctor in desperation,gives the man wolf's blood(!),where upon the foreman begans to grow violent and insane.
Elements of the story later turned up in Curt Siodmak's screenplay for The Wolf Man(1941),and it makes the film an interesting footnote.
There is some nice atmosphere made,like ghostly,wolves that dissapear into the forest and some beautiful locations.
An odd mixture of humor,drama and sentiment,it's a pretty good curio piece for serious film buffs.
Not bad films,but quality of the prints offered leave much more to be desired.
For collectors only.",1226016000,12,1751,5.253571428571429
8291056,4,B001D263IM,"""Wolf Blood"" was certainly an eye-opener. There are echoes of the plot in Universal's 1941 ""Wolfman""; Curt Siodmak must have seen this movie as a kid. I would imagine that this is the only version that will ever make it to home video, so grab it - the price is certainly a bargain. It's a well-done film.

Both films, however, are from VHS-quality video tape dubs, so they don't look all that great. On a small screen like a laptop, they're watchable. With my projector and a 6"" wide screen, it's unbearable. Still, it's nice to have ""Wolf Blood"" in my collection.

I would imagine that ""The Haunted Castle"" by F.W. Murnau will be released in the future by Kino looking as good as the day it was released, along with tons of extras. In the meantime, resist the temptation to watch this print of it.

(P.S. this review should not be construed as a complaint about budget video companies. I love these kinds of discs. The price is right, and at least you can say you've seen the film.)",1224288000,11,983,4.45
8291057,3,B001D263IM,"Alpha Home Entertainment has just released the double-DVD of ""Haunted Castle(1921)"" and ""Wolf Blood(1925)"".  Lacking any extras(there are 3 trailers), Alpha threw in the nearly unknown silent logger-adventure film, ""Wolf Blood"".  It's the story of Dick Bannister, boss of a logging camp in Canada.  Bannister is haunted by strange dreams. In a memorable sequence, he sees transparent ghost wolves running through the forest with him. The scene is tinted blood red, the forest is green, and the night background is a rich blue. Sadly, this low-budget transfer is in glorious black-and-white.  But the real meat here is ""Haunted Castle"".  F.W. Murnau was one of the most influential German film directors of the silent era. Some of Murnau's films have been lost, but many still survive. In Sept. 1920, Murnau released ""Der Januskopf/Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" starring Conrad Veidt. Bela Lugosi co-starred as the butler. This film has been lost. Murnau would become world-famous with his 1922 ""Nosferatu"". Just before ""Nosferatu"", Murnau made ""Schloss Vogelod"", or ""The Haunted Castle"". This is the first public release of ""Haunted Castle"" since it was made in 1921.  Not a horror film, but, in fact, a rather starchy, slow-moving murder/mystery, ""Haunted Castle"" does provide a tasty glimpse of the dark, ethereal cinema world that Murnau would soon invade.  ""Haunted Castle"" has a complicated plot, and the original script contains about a hundred-and-sixty-five titles to move the action(such as it is) along. Also, in ""Haunted Castle"", emotion was expressed through attitude and gesture, not acting. The story begins in autumn, in the castle of Vogelod. The owner, his young wife, and their hunting companions await the arrival of Baroness von Safferstadt and her husband. They arrive. Her first husband, Count Oestch, died three years before, under mysterious circumstances; still unexplained. The guests debate whether or not it was the Count's own brother, Johann Oestch, who shot him. Finally, the brother himself arrives at the castle.  Uh ooh.  The guests avoid him; the Baroness is horrified. She wants to leave, but decides to stay in order to meet with Father Faramund, her first husband's relative, who is coming to visit from Rome.  Are you with me so far?  That night, Father Faramund arrives(or is it him...) and meets with the Baroness, who wants to confess. Her confession is told in flashback: We see her first marriage four years ago, which started very happily. But her husband went away on a journey, and returned rather changed. He buried himself in ancient books; became a mystic, began neglecting his wife, and telling her that real happiness was only found in renunciation...OK.....His wife becomes frustrated, and consumed by passion. Evil creeps into her life...""Haunted Castle""  is filmed rather starkly, but the flash-back sequences are different. Images are luminous and mysterious. Murnau's contrast is successful. The most impressive image is of the scene in a long, narrow, high-ceilinged room. Light pierces down from two tall windows into the blackness; two shadowy figures face each other, leaning against the walls.  It is the Baron and his wife. In his review in ""Film Kurier"", April 8, 1921, Willy Haas says: ""In a large lofty room stands a murderer who has killed for love, and his beloved; they both remain there motionless like statues. Such a thing has rarely been seen in the whole existence of the cinema..."". In ""Haunted Castle"", only the combined talents of Murnau, Carl Mayer, Hermann Warm, and Fritz Arno Wagner could have succeeded. And indeed they did.  Arno would go on to shoot film for Fritz Lang. Sadly, without restoration, the conversion of ""Haunted Castle"" from print to DVD has produced artifact damage and compression. Contrast is poor. Blacks wash out, and are murky at best. The transfer is presented in 1.33:1 aspect ratio, and runs 90 minutes. Though a minor work, ""Haunted Castle"" is a rare, even valuable addition to the Muranu canon.  F. W. Murnau did not live to see the premiere of his last film; he died at age 42 in an automobile accident north of Santa Barbara, California on March 11, 1931. At Murnau's funeral in Berlin, Fritz Lang said:  ""He was a tireless and thorough worker; behind his gaiety was an indefatigable energy...a pioneer who left us in the midst of his career.""  And finally, one of his most famous actors, Emil Jannings said:  ""He was the most German. Reserved, severe, severe on others, severe on himself. Inside he was like a boy, profoundly kind, and incorruptible. He was a pioneer, he fertilized everything he touched. Never envious, always modest. And always alone....""",1220572800,7,4664,5.114473684210527
