8507376,4,B006ZZQ0WQ,"Very nice recording.  Not the usual Blu-ray case (smaller than a CD case) and NO LINER NOTES.  I thought I knew most of the stuff, but evidently not as much as I believed.  Good orchestra, great (DTS-MA/7.1) sound, but the packaging leaves a LOT to be desired...and without any liner notes you will probably be lost and totally unable to identify several of the selections.  Most Audio only Blu-ray at least (ie: NAXOS) give you an on-screen menu to select track and title identification...not this disc.  Good luck.",1406246400,2,516,4.818181818181818
