6355844,5,B00JEEZTKO,"Watched the movie last night and woke up this morning with a whole new appreciation for life. Jason is a talented filmmaker and and he and his wife are so open and honest about what they are going through. I highly recommend buying this movie and sharing with your friends. Parents, this is a movie your teenaged kids should see! Churches should buy some copies to lend to their members. Better yet, have a movie night, show this movie to your members and raise money for MS research.",1403568000,10,484,4.511363636363637
6355845,5,B00JEEZTKO,"My sister has primary progressive MS.  She heard about this movie, got access to a copy, and shared it with our family.  Rather than scaring her, it seems to have given her a good picture of the possible steps that she will go through.  She has used this as a tool for educating us.  Jason's personal honesty about his journey, emotions, and values are richly presented.  His humor is a gift.  She recommended watching the journals in the extra features section first, which worked well.",1403395200,17,487,4.670588235294118
6355846,5,B00JEEZTKO,"This documentary has received sterling reviews from Sundance to the New York Times. It is a must-watch film for those with multiple sclerosis, but it will appeal to all film lovers who appreciate a gifted filmmaker's assessment of his life's gifts and challenges. I loved this film.

6355860,5,B00JEEZTKO,"I know and understand what Jason was going through. My mother is living with MS. The disease not only affects her, but me, my father and our family. A friend introduce me to this documentary. It broke my heart. Jason's inspiration and courage minds us that we can overcome any disease. The film was wonderful. It shows Jason's journey and how he stay strong with his disability. I recommend his story to any one who wants to know about MS and how it affects a person.",1416614400,,467,4.441860465116279
6355861,3,B00JEEZTKO,"It was interesting and I assume Jason is still battling on the disease.  It is my hope more people become
aware how disabling MS is and that someone will come up with a cure or a way to stop it in it's tracks.",1409529600,,209,3.86046511627907
6355862,5,B00JEEZTKO,"Having MS myself I could relate to many of the issues that Jason faced on a daily bases. When I Walk is a very moving inspirational documentary. Jason is very lucky that he had an extended support group, his wife, family and friends. Many I know who have MS, their support group disappeared. Thank You Jason for telling your story ... we are not alone!!!!!",1409184000,2,356,4.492307692307692

6355864,5,B00JEEZTKO,"Honest and real look at what goes through the mind and experiences of someone with a debilitating disease. Jason DaSilva does not sugar coat his journey with MS. It is about time someone showed the reality of what is experienced by so many  of the disabled without the Hollywood glamour that the world is fed by celebrities. This is truth, funny at times, and eye opening to architectural barriers many face each day. This film is one all city planning boards, politicians, and most of all Medical Researchers must watch. Thank you Jason for your perseverance and outlook and opening your soul to us. I believe this film will open the hearts of many. It did mine!",1404864000,,663,4.666666666666667
6355865,5,B00JEEZTKO,"As someone who also has MS, I identified with Jasons emotions.  I recommend this movie to anyone but especially anyone with a disability.  Families will benefit from watching this as well.  This will provide insight to you about the  challenges of living in a world designed for the able bodied.  Jason and Alice open themselves emotionally to the camera and the viewers will be amazed at their strength in the face of adversity.",1404691200,,429,4.821917808219178
6355866,5,B00JEEZTKO,"Jason DaSilva was 25 years old and a rising independent filmmaker when a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis changed everything. Now take out successful since that is professional description, what counts is Jason was a 25 years old kid who needed to deal with a powerful debilitating disease which requires the mind of a mature adult without any insecurities since MS takes a good chunk of human capability as an active individual to an inactive individual with with limited physical capabilities.

Watching Jason for ninety minutes was an escape to another world for an individual like me where I tried to relate the meaning of life only having Jason's abilities when infact I could never even imagine life not being able to surf, mountain bike, hike, pump or do all the activities that I do. That concept is simply, way out of my league especially with all physical and mental health that I posses at time being, which I appreciate and cherish every second of my life. Way, way out of my league.

Wish Jason, Alice and Ms. DaSilva peace, health and happiness. Thank you for sharing your life trials with strangers like me in experiencing a different life in a different light for ninety minutes. Ninety minutes may have been the length of the documentary not the length of time that you have impacted my life. Be well.",1403654400,6,1317,4.771929824561403
