8146776,3,B000ION24E,"For years, I've enjoyed these two kung-fu movies when I recordered them on my betamac back in the day.  (Beta-what?) And after twenty years, finally a major studio distributor has released both these gems.  No, these aren't revolutionary as say, ""Gone With The Wind"" or even ""Lawerence of Arabia,"" but with so many Kung Fu movies not worth mentioning, these two are pleasant surprises.

MILITANT EAGLE - ""The war may be over, but the fighting has just begun.""  A soldier returning home from battle joins forces with villagers seeking justice after their families are brutally slain.  This basic premise is typical of the kung fu genre, but the movie does become confusing with various elements added.  But, the reason for watching these movies is for the martial arts, and it indeed has some impressive fight sequences.  It's violence is somewhat aggressive, more so when I first saw it.  It also has that typical bad dubbed dialog, swearing one voice actor must have served dubs on more than one character.  Also, their voices sounds more like bronx truck drivers.  This movie is slightly above par, no not a Tiger Wood pun, but supplies enough that doesn't out stays it's welcome.

THE PRODIGAL BOXER - ""Each defeat makes him stronger!""  The one person that has been protrayed most in kung fu movies is the real life Fong Sai Yuk, the beloved hero of Chinese lore.  In this movie, after accidently killing a kung fu student of another clan, his family are attacked, including the death of his own father.  But, getting revenge isn't so easy as he is beaten severly by corrupt kung fu masters.  So, through intense training, becomes the deadliest fighting machine... The Prodigal Boxer.  This is a heavy character driven piece, as it's weakness is the fighting sequences, but enough to make this worthy kung fu entertainment.

The true bonus of these two movies are both are rendered 16X9 Widecreen, unavailable in their previous releases.  Hopefully, more will come from Warners with still various movies yet to be tapped in.",1194739200,3,2027,4.894428152492669
