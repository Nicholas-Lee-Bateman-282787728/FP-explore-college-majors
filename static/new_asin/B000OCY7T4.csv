8184690,5,B000OCY7T4,"This was a very informative movie with excellent acting. I was particularly impressed with Mary McDonnell--not a surprise given all her acting accolades. Watching this movie I felt a plethora of emotions, empathy, anger, frustration and even shock--a scene between McDonnell and her doctor and what he does to her made me both jump and cry. The callousness of the doctors and the pharmaceutical companies is absolutely disgusting. Thank God there were strong women like these two to stand up to them and say that we as women matter, our health and well being matter.",1445040000,,566,4.968421052631579

8184692,5,B000OCY7T4,"This was a great movie, and so sad. I had an aunt to die of breast cancer, and a few other friends have had it and are in remission. Powerful performances by the lead actresses.",1346284800,,177,4.085714285714285
8184693,5,B000OCY7T4,Saw this movie from Netflix.  I enjoyed it. Worth watching for information on breast implants in the 80's or 90's. Decent acting and story.,1288224000,,139,4.791666666666667
8184694,5,B000OCY7T4,"I recently watched this movie and found it to be an excellent movie.  Both Mary McDonnell and Gail O'Grady were superb.  I always thought Mary McDonnell was a great actress, but the character she played in this movie showed all the more her acting abilites.  I felt this movie helped to shed some light on the continuing problems plagued by women in the world.  It showed that you don't have to be quiet like a mouse and that you can stand up for your rights!  Worth buying.",1216080000,2,474,4.402298850574713
8184695,5,B000OCY7T4,"This is a wonderful FACT based story on the history of breast implants that were never approved by the FDA. It is the story of greedy manufacturers that hide the real scientific facts so that they can continue to make the almighty dollar. They seem not to care that often they are causing devastating ill health among unsuspecting patients.  Unfortunately we are 12 years out since this movie aired, and the battle for a SAFE breast implant continues.",1191801600,6,451,4.782051282051282
8184696,3,B000OCY7T4,"I was disappointed with this movie.  The story lacked depth even though it covered an interesting topic.

Gail O'Grady's acting was as superb as ever, but the real disappointment was Mary McDonnell's contribution to the movie. Her acting really let the movie down.

Perhaps if another actor was used to play Mary McDonnell's part, the movie would have been better.",1186444800,,364,5.033333333333333
