540658,4,6303039405,"Right off the bat don't buy this dvd go out and look for the Roan Group double dvd with The Stranger and Cause For Alarm on it. Now that that has been established let's delve into the film. This film is a great introduction into the world of Orson Welles. Welles' films are always visually stunning a bit confusing, stark and thought provoking. And The Stranger posess all of the above mentioned attributes but just a litles watered down making it the most easy to watch of all of Welles' films. Welles' plays a Nazi war criminal hiding out in a suburbia and he weds Loretta Young to seem even more in touch with Americana. But when a man from his past comes and pays him a visit all hell breaks loose! Welles' has a very unique face in most of his other films he is clean shaven and looks like a cherub but here he has a mustache which makes him look sinister but still trusting due to his angel like eyes and you never wonder why Young's character stands by her man even after he tells her he's a killer! The camera angles are a lot less perverse than Welles' other films but his visual style is still present here! The scene after he kills his former comrade and the wind grabs the paper trail is just haunting. And the final sequence is also well done. Welles was a Hollywood out cast due to his often abstract cinematic ventures and wanted to prove he could make standard Hollowood fluff but with this film he went above and beyond the call of duty.",992476800,3,1454,4.310218978102189
540659,5,6303039405,"For those who are going to buy this copy, beware. The transfer is a disappointment and there is a logo which pops up on the screen throughout the film. The logo is ""Delta""--whatever that is. It's not the name of the company, so I can't quite figure out what it is. Perhaps if you have a ""S"" cable connected to your DVD the film might be a lot clearer. At any rate, the ""Delta"" logo is a real travesty and since this is the only DVD version that is being printed, die-hard Orson Welles fans are forced to buy it for their collection. If you have time, you might want to look for a different version of ""The Stranger"" in a Fries Electronics or wherever they sell DVDs. Of course, the film is brilliant--especially when you think about what other films were being done at the time--but it would be nice if the company who transferred the film gave it the respect it deserves.",988416000,14,872,4.323170731707317
540660,4,6303039405,"A noir-ish thriller directed by and starring Orson Welles  post-""Citizen Kane"".  Edward G. Robinson and Loretta Young  co-star.  Shares a neat clock-oriented subtext with ""The Third  Man"".  The character Welles plays, a Nazi baddie named Franz Kindler,  who has established a new life for himself under a new name in  ""Harper"" (ne Hartford), Connecticut is only a step or two  removed from the nefarious Harry Lime of Carol Reed's classic.  That was  the film in which Welles gave the great speech -- one of the film world's  best -- about Switzerland and the cuckoo clock.  ""The Stranger""  isn't quite as clever, but it's a fine film nonetheless.  Somewhat  reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock's underrated ""Shadow of a Doubt"",  in which Joseph Cotten played an urban killer hiding from the authorities  in the deceptive safety and security of the suburbs.  ""The  Stranger"" isn't based on Albert Camus' novel; that was made into a  film a few decades later by Italian director, Luchino Visconti.",904003200,11,992,5.037267080745342

540725,4,6303039405,"The Stranger, 1946 film

This 1946 film seems to use high-speed (and high-contrast) film, which results in a stark effect. It is also a low-budget film, comparable to some 'film noir' of the 1940s. It is about the search for a Nazi war criminal, hiding in plain sight. Franz speaks American without an accent, and shows up as a new teacher in a rural college. He romances and marries the no longer young daughter of an important man (Chief Justice). But another war criminal, who got religion, searches for Franz. Franz realizes that Meineke is being followed, and kills him to keep his secret. Meineke is also a problem since he has got religion; and religion (or personal ideals) is always a threat to any secular system whether Fascism, Communism, or Plutocracy.

Nazi hunter Edward G. Robinson arrives, posing as an antique dealer. His comments on old silver shows he has studied his cover story. There is also a clue to Franz: an obsession with clocks (symbolizing a devotion to man-made mechanical devices, like social systems). Little by little the facts come out to point to Franz. Franz tries to kill his new wife, since she knows too much about him! This symbolizes his self-destructive philosophy, which leads to his fall from the top. Can anyone hide in a small town?

This film was an unheeded warning. It would be over thirty years later before we learned about ""Operation Paper Clip"" and other schemes to harbor Nazis in America. It wasn't just rocket scientists. The film also records a more innocent time, when college students ran through the woods as a pastime.",1491177600,,1580,4.801470588235294
540726,2,6303039405,"What's not to like with Orson Wells and Edward G Robinson holding center stage? Um, maybe dialogue, plausibility, an inane music track and a never untelegraphed plot. It reminds me of looking back at early television shows where the over-riding questions becomes asking oneself, how did we ever fall for such stuff? We're audiences really that naive and unsophisticated? The answer of course is yes. Just as we still are, only now we've also inherited a near century of cinematic devices that manage to compress all of the world's past history, present and future human dilemmas into one or two hour dramas. There was a time when just seeing moving pictures was enough. But that was long ago. Noir in daylight just isn't the same. Mostly interesting as a lens into objects, manners and styles eclipsed by so called progress. OW and EGR remain giants in much better vehicles elsewhere.",1486252800,,884,4.9

Although the ending was rather easy to foresee (even if you hadn't already watched it before), that takes nothing at all away from the three principal performances, which are truly masterful indeed.  Robinson and Welles and Young were at the tops of their games when this work was produced in 1946, or more than seventy years ago, when the plot line was as hugely contemporary and relevant as could be.  I understand that this version of the public domain work is among the best and most faithful to the original format, which makes its ""film noir"" mysteries even more foreboding and well ahead of its time.

Having directed two undisputed masterpieces like Citizen Kane and The Magnificent Ambersons, Orson Welles delved into the suspense film, crafting a post-war, psychological noir that laid the foundations for his later film noir classics, The Lady from Shanghai and Touch of Evil.

Edward G. Robinson stars as a government agent tracking down a sadistic Nazi officer Franz Kindler [Orson Welles], who has evaded justice for running Nazi extermination camps. Rankin has crafted a new identity for himself in a quaint Connecticut town by marrying Mary Longstreet [Loretta Young], the daughter of a local judge, but as his past begins to catch up with him will his wife side with the investigators or her husband

Circulated in poor versions for decades, this edition of THE STRANGER was remastered in HD [1080p] from an original 35mm print preserved by the Library of Congress and this special edition to celebrate the 100th year of the birth of Orson Welles is accompanied by a wealth of extras including Death Mills documentary by director Billy Wilder. Original Theatrical Trailer and an excerpt from the TV series: Around the World with Orson Welles, plus the radio broadcasts by Orson Welles.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Within just five years, Orson Welles had fallen from the position of Boy Genius with complete artistic control over his work to an industry-wide failure, forced to take on THE STRANGER to prove he could work within the studio system as well as anyone. After a four-year hiatus and a lot of bad press, Orson Welles was eager to prove himself capable of bringing in a picture on time and within budget. The result was THE STRANGER, Orson Welles's most conventional film but one which nevertheless bears some of his distinctive touches. There are also little jokes buried in each scene, as when Edward G. Robinson is knocked cold by a gymnasts ring and the camera glances past a sign warning ""use this apparatus at your own risk."" But perhaps the most remarkable thing about THE STRANGER, is that production proceeded without delays, incidents, hassles with studio executives, or the kind of scandals that marked the shooting. In that respect, it's the most un-Wellesian of any Orson Welles's film.

Orson Welles directed what is widely considered one of the all-time greatest films, Citizen Kane, among several other acclaimed works, but his only bona fide box office success is the rarely-discussed THE STRANGER. After the controversial debut of Citizen Kane and the poor performance of his second directorial effort, The Magnificent Ambersons, Orson Welles found it hard to get work as a director. He took a few years off to focus on acting and starting a family before returning to the directors chair for the 1946 film THE STRANGER.

Orson Welles stars in THE STRANGER, where he plays Franz Kindler, an infamous Nazi war criminal and after destroying all evidence of his past atrocities, Franz Kindler moves to a small town in Connecticut where he assumes the identity of a prep school teacher and marries Mary Longstreet [Loretta Young], the daughter of a Supreme Court Justice. He believes himself to be above suspicion, oblivious to the fact that a member of the Allied War Crimes Commission, Mr. Wilson [Edward G. Robinson], is on his trail and Mr. Wilson is charged with the task of convincing the naive Mary Longstreet of her new husbands true identity in order to capture him.

With its game of cat and mouse and the exciting conclusion atop a clock tower, THE STRANGER is ostensibly a standard drama-thriller. But further inspection reveals it to be more complex than that; it serves as a transitory piece in Orson Welles career. The film contains many of the artistic flourishes of his early works where Orson Welles keen direction includes several lengthy, albeit subtle, uninterrupted takes, while laying the groundwork for the film noir classics he would go on to create, including his follow-up feature, The Lady from Shanghai.

THE STRANGER was produced shortly after the conclusion of World War II, and although the war was over, the American people were still living in fear of another attack. The film plays on that fear, leading audiences to believe that the person sitting next to them could be secretly plotting to strike from within. The sense of unease is perpetuated by the inclusion of actual concentration camp footage; the first film to do so. Its interesting to see Orson Welles take on a darker role rather than that of the hero, and he delivers a performance that is among his best. Edward G. Robinsons portrayal of Mr. Wilson is equally commendable.

Years after THE STRANGER was released Orson Welles and Edward G. Robinson spoke of how they disliked working with each other. Any conflict the two legendary actors had behind-the-scenes certainly did not show up on camera as they play off each other brilliantly. The strongest performances in the film come when the diminutive Robinson puts the lofty Welles on the defensive as he presses to learn the truth about his past. Another strong performance comes from the beautiful Loretta Young as the innocent Mary Longstreet whose steadfast will to defend her husband leads her gradually into madness.

Blu-ray Video Quality  OEG Classic Movies brings an 1080p encoded image that was mastered from archival 35mm elements which were preserved by the Library of Congress and this high-definition presentation offers a noticeable improvement, and it's apparent there were minimal restoration efforts done to this film and is presented here as is, warts and all, which is more or less a blessing in disguise. The 1.33:1 aspect ratio image displays strong definition and clarity for most of the film's runtime and overall resolution is really excellent. Fine lines and textures in various scenes are nicely detailed with some particularly revealing close-ups. A thin layer of natural grain washes over the picture and remains consistent throughout. Contrast is better balanced and accurate for the most part, as there a few instances of blooming in the highlights. Black levels too, are often rich and true with good gradational details, but some sequences appear a tad faded and murky. In the end, this is a good presentation of this film and you will not get anything better and I wish OEG Classic Movies had spent a lot more money on this classic Orson Welles film, as for me there are far too many white speckles and fine white lines running on the left hand side of the screen that keep appearing, as well horrible film gate dirt down the right hand of the screen, which too me sort of spoilt the enjoyment of the film, but unfortunately I expect other companies who have brought out this Blu-ray had the same problem, so sadly I am stuck with it, which is a shame as it is a totally brilliant tour-de-force espionage thriller film from Orson Welles. Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  OEG Classic Movies brings you a choice of two audio soundtracks and on the Blu-ray it is 2.0 LPCM Dual Mono and on the DVD is Dolby Digital Mono, and very confused why they have done, which is all very strange. Vocals are cleanly and intelligibly delivered in the centre, and overall imaging comes with strong acoustical details. The design is not particularly dynamic, but the mid-range is nicely balanced and well-defined, providing the soundstage with an appreciably broad presence. Bass is pretty limited though there's just enough to give the music and the voices of actors some mild weight. All in all, it's still a good track and an improvement over its counterpart.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: DEATH MILLS [1945] [480i] [1.33:1] [32:40] This is an information film about the Nazi Death Camps with footage that appeared briefly in THE STRANGER film. The film starts very badly with those countdown numbers and I cannot understand why they could not have edited this out and started it where the main title appears. Also another puzzle that I do not understand is that right at the end of the documentary you get short repeats of the documentary you have just viewed. This was originally made with a German soundtrack for screening in occupied Germany and Austria, this film was the first documentary to show what the Allies found when they liberated the Nazi extermination camps: the survivors, the conditions, and the evidence of mass murder. The film includes accounts of the economic aspects of the camps' operation, the interrogation of captured camp personnel, and the enforced visits of the inhabitants of neighbouring towns, who, along with the rest of their compatriots, are blamed for complicity in the Nazi crimes, one of the few such condemnations in the Allied war records. DEATH MILLS [Die Todesmhlen] is a 1945 American film directed by Billy Wilder and produced by the United States Department of War. The film was intended for German audiences to educate them about the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime. For the German version, Die Todesmhlen, Hanus Burger is credited as the writer and director, while Wilder supervised the editing. Wilder is credited with directing the English-language version. The film is a much-abbreviated version of German Concentration Camps Factual Survey, a 1945 British government documentary that was not completed until nearly seven decades later.

Special Feature: Bull Fight in Madrid [1955] [1080p] [1.33:1] [15:12] This is an Extract from Around the World with Orson Welles. Orson Welles pitches a film about the world of matadors, bullfights, and their spectators. Cast: Orson Welles, Kenneth Tynan and Elaine Dundy. The quality of the black-and-white 1080p image is spectacular; it is such a shame the main film could not of been of high quality standards as this particular special feature.

Special Feature: CBC Orson Welles's Wartime Radio Broadcasts [1941  1942] This particular extra includes four WWII-era broadcasts that Orson Welles voiced and was broadcast on Canadian Broadcasting Corporation apart from one, which is a great extra inclusion. Here you have four audio only radio broadcasts, which sadly are of very poor quality and they are as follows:

From The Series: Nazi Eyes on Canada [CBC]: ALAMEDA [29:00] Orson Welles performs in, but did not direct. This dramatization of the Nazi takeover of the small Canadian town of Alameda. It was produced by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, as part of the Third Victory War Drive. This was broadcast on the 25th December, 1942.

From The Series: Hello Americans [CBC]: BRAZIL [29:00] This is the Premiere episode of a lively variety program intended to foster Inter-American relations, and featuring an appearance by Carmen Miranda. The cinematic counterpart of this program was Orson Welless ill-fated film ITS ALL TRUE. This was broadcast on the 15th November, 1942.

From The Series: Ceiling Unlimited [CBC]: WAR WORKERS [29:00] In this episode of Orson Welless patriotic aviation themed program He Swipes The Microphone from a Nazi Spy point of view and broadcast to Berlin with a tour of the Lockheed-Vega Corporation plant. This was a light-hearted spin on The War of the World type spoof broadcast, where Orson Welles employs the pseudo-documentary approach for which he had become famous for. This was broadcast on the 14th December, 1942.

From The Series: Orson Welles Commentaries [ABC]: BIKINI ATOMIC TEST [14:00] Airing shortly after the release of THE STRANGER film. This particular episode is of Orson Welless political opinion program discussing Americas further development of the Atomic Bomb, as well as the demise of The Office of Price Administration. This was broadcast on the 30th June, 1946.

Theatrical Trailer [1946] [480i] [1.33:1] [1:16] This is the original Theatrical Trailer of THE STRANGER. Despite the grainy quality, it is still a great dramatic presentation trailer.

Special Feature: Stills Gallery [2015] [1080p] Here you get to view a gallery of black-and-white and colour images of a total of fifteen publicity photos, storyboards sketches, and Cinema Film Posters from different countries. To view them you have to keep pressing next with your remote handset.

Finally, though not as celebrated as Orson Welles's two previous films, THE STRANGER is a crucial part of the director's filmography, proving he could create a commercial success without fully sacrificing his artistic integrity. It's a slick, thematically substantial post-war thriller, and it holds up well next to some of the best noir films of its day. THE STRANGER has had a chequered history with the home video format like many films in the public domain, Odeon Entertainment has treated this classic film with respect, giving us a detailed high definition transfer, a great audio track, and a disc that includes an informative series of vintage radio broadcasts. It's a definite upgrade from previous Blu-ray releases, which had DNR [Digital Noise Reduction] done to death and also featured an audio track that should have been upgraded. THE STRANGER may not be Orson Welless best effort, and its certainly not his most celebrated work, but its a great film worthy of recognition. As it is in the public domain, there are dozens of poor-quality versions of the film floating around on home video, but OEG Classic Movies Blu-ray presentation is slightly let down quality wise, but you do get some nice extras as compensation. THE STRANGER is a better-than-average spy-thriller and particularly relevant for the time period of its release and most definitely worth discovering for Orson Welles fans everywhere. Highly Recommended!

Maybe Orwell inspired him with this film.  They both reek of a frustrated artist trying to capture their adolescent brooding darkness for posterity, even though they are old enough to know better.  Amazon list this as a film noir, but that is a bit of a stretch.  Yeah, there are some dark camera shots where Orwell tries to look all intense, but the shooting location just didn't lend itself to the genera.  1940s Pittsburgh would be dark, Connecticut not so much.

The audio and video quality left a lot to be desired, especially when strong German accents were used in the movie.  The film had a good storyline yet, it wasn't fully explored.  Also, several of the scenes could have been either cut completely or combined in another portion of the movie.

541033,2,6303039405,"IMPORTANT: This two-star review pertains to the dreadful quality of Kino's Blu-ray, not the movie itself, which is quite excellent and another example of Welles' extraordinary skills as a filmmaker.  First the good news: For the first time since 1946, the original International Pictures logo opens the movie, and the end title is also intact, with a bemused Robinson (""Pleasant dreams!"") smoking away as THE END and appropriate company titles are superimposed over him.  Fantastic... we've been abruptly cutting to black and a phony end title since the film was released to television back in the late '50s, and seeing the final moments of Edward G's engaging performance is indeed a treat.  Now the bad news: this print, apparently as ""official"" as it gets, is so worn and blown-out that trying to get through it is a major ordeal.  Terrible contrast, raining emulsion scratches, splices with missing frames that chop up the film's organic flow, and -- worst of all -- a missing scene (Robinson's recovery from the ladder trap).  This last problem is offensive and inexcusable.  Didn't the Kino supervisors know the classic film they were releasing?  Any cinephile worth his copy of CITIZEN KANE would've spotted the missing scene, and Kino should've taken that same scene from other releases (this is a public domain film) so that their edition of THE STRANGER would at least be complete.  It isn't.  It's a train wreck of a viewing experience, a terrible way to experience this fine movie, worthwhile only because of the restored opening and closing titles.  As of this writing, the best home video version of THE STRANGER is the 2007 MGM DVD release, which is clean, relatively scratch-free, features proper light/dark contrasts and, of course, is complete.  Recommendation: Criterion should tackle this Welles classic as a definitive Blu-ray, using MGM's superior material, but with the proper logos and end title restored.  We'll probably never see a breathtaking scan from the original neg like THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI or TOUCH OF EVIL, but at least the movie will be given its best possible treatment.",1426291200,5,2109,5.081159420289855

I love his camera.  This is not his greatest material, but what might have been just mediocre is transcended to a degree by the talent involved in the film.  Welles is one of the few who can play a Nazi and arouse a degree of sympathy or pity, and quite remarkably this film was done only one year removed from the end of the war, when Nazi hatred was probably at a peak.  Again, not among his greatest films, but the excellent acting and Welles' familiar aura makes it worthwhile.  One drawback is the quality of the film print, which is sub-standard.  If ever this film were fully restored, perhaps more of Welles' genius would be unfolded.",1410393600,,805,4.465753424657534
541133,2,6303039405,"Great film.  But the two stars are for the blu-ray edition, easily one of the absolute worst transfers I've ever seen.  Constant drops in the picture, sound pops (in some scenes as regular as a heartbeat for several minutes without stopping), and video noise make this pretty much useless as a blu-ray.

The real pleasure in watching blu-rays is finding an old film that you've probably only seen and saying ""WOW!"" I never *really* saw that film's details before I saw it remastered and cleaned up on blu-ray!  There's really no point in releasing blu-rays of films like this when it's exactly the same experience as watching the film bought in the bottom of a discount bin in a dollar store.

541171,2,6303039405,"""The Stranger"" is a indeed a strange film. It is a strange film because where it mattered most the studio in charge of production saw fit to edit nearly 30 minutes. The 30 or so minutes edited, it is told, involved an entire account of the pursuit of a War Crimes Criminal. The ""Film Noir"" category like the film ""the Stranger"" is gutted by this unconscionable edit. The edit of the pursuit sacrifices mystery,suspense and true gumshoe pursuit. It actually makes less of the Edward G. Robinson role to such an extent that the character of the film is truly sacrificed. Characterization in the film is weakened by this  unfortunate strategy. To this particular moment in time there is no such location as Harper,Conn. It,that is ""The Stranger"" was filmed in its entirety at the Culver City , California studios of Paramount Pictures. The difficulty that this particular kind of thinking made for was a short cut without cause. The film is really is not worth the time. It is a weakened environment and a weakened story. ""The Stranger"" is a work of fiction though there still remain some suggestive phrasing to include the recently concluded Nuremburg trials. A for instance there is use of the name of Gables instead of Reich Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels. There is use of the name of ""Hitler"" and also the word ""Holocaust"" is used however in neither instance and as well in reference to is there anywhere a binding characterization whereby we would be obliged to as it were participate. The conduct of the Orson Welles character lacks conviction as much a weakness as such conduct might provide. The lack of a history is truly another weakness of this particular attempt to characterize the Orson Welles character as the progenerator  of the Holocaust. There are some clever short changing that goes on at a later point in the film where the Director is indicating the timed sequences with an attempt to murder. This is in fact a cheap film that lacks more than conviction it lacks quality. There is a comment made as to Karl Marx being a Jew. This comment did wrong in attempt to persuade the theater goer that this type of comment is a revelation,It is not. In a later scene the Loretta Young character is coerced into watching a film which reportedly was of The Holocaust. The only images I was to observe was in fact the initial stages that the Allies found the prison. This was the prison that was to house those individuals who were to be tried by the War Crimes Commission for crimes against humanity. Its inhabitants were to include the likes of Herman Goering, Alfred Jodl, Albert Speer, etc. The film wants us to believe that what we are looking at are in fact Gas Chambers when in truth these were the very cells that would soon house all those individuals accused of war crimes. The location was a converted courthouse and prison in Nuremberg. The initial images of said premises were shown to the Loretta Young character as a means to bring the truth to mind. The alleged truth was that this guy(Orson Welles character) who she had married was not who she thought he was. It was 1848 when ""The Communist Manifesto"" was published by Karl Marx and Fredreick Engels and further history will bare out that communist sympathizers and communism were very near the top of the list of gripes of the Third Reich. The war with Russia was about as big and dramatic as this clash of cultures might be said to represent. This film nowhere provides such care as to refer to these dramatic events as being real. There is truly no understanding with hysteria underwriting this films place. ""The Stranger"" lacks so much detail that ultimately there is less of an interest as a result. I think there are better films to be viewed with the errors of this films underwriting being in principal the cause of this lack of interest. It can be put forth that this film is a fictional account that is so off base that this film might be more of a friend to an enemy than anything else. Not quite the interest to hope for-",1401494400,,4018,4.6339410939691446

I have always thought of Edward G. Robinson as actor who played criminals in his films. In this Wells film, he plays an almost good guy role, what I would call a flawed hero. Wells as a Nazi criminal was a stretch for me. The film moves a good pace and kept me involved. You will have to see the film to find out how it ends.

While Kino's HD picture is sharp with good contrast, it's marred by scratches and other artifacts that don't appear on MGM's virtually flaw-free copy.

541215,2,6303039405,"Fans of 'The Stranger' have been waiting forever for its rescue from Public Domain Hell. When Kino announced they were issuing a restored version, we patiently waited for the day it was available. Sadly I must say the wait wasn't really worth it. People new to owning Blu-rays think every disc will look and sound great. That is not true as I am learning. It all depends on the quality of the film's source, the restoration, and the HD transfer to disc. Like some Amazon reviewers, I'm here to echo their disappointment in this Blu-ray.

According to Blu-ray.com, a good site for reviews and my starting point in learning about a Blu-ray's video & audio quality before I buy one, ""the folks at Kino-as they often do-have essentially left the print 'as-is.' This means you will see bouts of specks and vertical scratches through out the film - along with a few missing frames...."" Boy Oh Boy was that an understatement!  The front cover states this version is a ""35MM Archival Restoration"" but your eyes will tell you it's obviously not true and I complained to Kino about their false advertising but they never replied. The back cover says the film was ""Mastered in HD from archival 35mm elements preserved by the Library of Congress."" Obviously these elements were not in good shape so I question why the Library of Congress would keep inferior elements.

At best this disc looks like a sharper version of a public domain print with more contrast but minus the badly needed cleanup. Why would a company go through the trouble to master a film without first restoring it? Sounds half-baked to me and so are the results. Compare Criterion's impressive Blu-ray of Hitchcock's original 'The Man Who Knew Too Much' to public domain versions and you'll see how good an old film can look given the proper treatment. Compare this new 'Stranger' to a public domain version one and I doubt you'll see much difference. If it's any consolation, I will say the audio was better than the visual aspect and that's not saying much. Those who want subtitles will find none.

What's good about this disc? The informative commentary and the extras. If you buy it, please don't pay full price. I'm glad I got mine cheaper so I don't feel that cheated. An Amazon reviewer named Alric has championed the earlier MGM Film Noir DVD version for better quality. I haven't seen it but if you're not interested in the Blu-ray's extras, you should take his recommendation as I might buy that one. If it's as good as he and others claim, it's too bad Kino or another company couldn't have transferred that one to Blu-ray. Even if the MGM version wasn't restored for the transfer, is it logical to think we would have a better looking Blu-ray because it was made from a cleaner source?

Postscript 9/10/14:  I took Alric's advice and bought the MGM DVD. It's wayyyy better than the Kino Blu-ray in video quality. You'll have to look very hard to see the few specks present. The movie is also dubbed in French and Spanish, and includes English and Spanish subtitles. The sound is clean and clear. My recommendation: If you don't want the Blu-ray's extras, buy this one; if you want the best of both worlds, buy both as I did. Thanks again, Alric!",1387497600,2,3215,4.671378091872792

541275,3,6303039405,"If you are expecting the 'Kino Classics Remastered Blu-ray' version of Orson Welles' ""The Stranger"" to be the definitive print you've been waiting for, you'll be sadly disappointed. The Kino release is a Blu-ray disc of a mediocre print that the Library of Congress received from International Pictures. No effort (that I can see) was made to restore or improve this over-exposed, grainy, scratchy print, whose defects are made even more obvious in high-definition. If you wish to watch a much, much better print of this movie, get the DVD released by MGM as part of their (MGM Film Noir) series. The MGM version has much better contrast, exposure, and is remarkably free of scratches and other artifacts. It's not high-definition, but it is far superior to the Kino Blu-ray release in every other way.

However, one of the two reasons you might wish to buy this pitiful Kino Blu-ray release is the commentary track by film historian Bret Wood.  It's excellent! The other reason is to see the horrible footage of the Nazi death camps put together by Billy Wilder in 1946, which is one of the disc's extras. Watching ""Death Mills"" is a reminder of why we should never forget the atrocities of the Nazi regime. A few shots from this documentary are used in ""The Stranger"".

541332,3,6303039405,"Adding to the comments of other reviewers on the quality of available editions: I watched the FocusFilm restored version. It has been diligently scrubbed of all scratches and imperfections, but at the cost of badly damaging the original visuals. Although technically it is a ""restored"" version, I highly recommend looking for a better copy elsewhere.

I do not know the technical terms for the faults I saw, but often the fine detail had disappeared from e.g. faces, leaving an unnaturally monochrome surface behind. Where you would expect some play of light against the contours of a face, there was instead a flat gray smear. Where you would expect a gradation from lighter to darker areas, e.g. on a hand held at an angle to the light, there was instead an odd two-tone effect with a darker gray and a brighter area, separated by a sharp border. Bright areas in the image often looked over-exposed. Overall the movie looked like it had been run through a clumsily performed digital process that had destroyed most of the fine detail.

Dark areas (of which there are many in a Film Noir) trailed long horizontal ""shadows"" across the screen, reminiscent of the degraded image on a worn VCR tape.

And perhaps worst of all, it is a full-screen version in 4:3 aspect ratio, meaning that a significant portion of the original movie has been cropped away. Sometime the effect ruins a scene: Everybody in the room turns to look as a man's shoulder enters through the door. Only later, when he moves to the center of the room, do we see that it is in fact Orson Welles' character that has arrived.

The movie itself is excellent, but this particular edition is to be avoided.",1375056000,,1670,4.7285223367697595

His portrayal of an ex-N&aacute;zi masquerading as a Connecticut prep school professor is for most of the picture restrained, but there's an obvious evil element to the character that dramatically surfaces in the last half-hour. The story's climax is quite gruesome for its day.

In many ways, this is Orson's best work. Loretta Young is also at the top of her game and Eddie Robinson not far off his. Richard Long as Young's brother is likable and attractive.

THE STRANGER begins with the release from prison of Konrad Meinike, a N&aacute;zi who was convicted of mass murder. He flees to the bucolic New England town of Harper, where colleague Franz Kindler has taken on the identity of Charles Rankin and even married the daughter of a Supreme Court justice to further his disguise. Mr. Wilson, an agent of the UN War Crimes Commission, tails Meinike and is led right to Kindler/Rankin. Proving Rankin is a war criminal won't be a easy task, especially as the man's new bride Mary totally believes his cover story. Wilson's best bet is in finding Meinike, who seems to have vanished without a trace.

So he takes his childhood fears and turns them into a trapped animal caught up there on the screen for all to see.  A Nazi mastermind hiding in a small New England town pursued by a predatory Edward G. Robinson just as he's about to marry into total respectability with a Judge's daughter (the very very good Loretta Young).  Without giving too much away Robinson winds up in the town and highly suspicious of Welle's vain college Professor.  A cat and mouse game ensues (tho perhaps a chess game is a better metaphor) that allows Welles to display his genius for such settings and such human weaknesses falling like dominoes until the wonderful climax which comes like clockwork, but of course getting to that clock is a strange and terrifying journey for the entire town and the audience to savor.  Welles actually directed very few projects and was relegated to an acting career by the Studios' disdain of his work ethic and distrust of his final product tho few ever reached that 'final' stage.  This movie plays on fears that were very much alive when it was released that perhaps some of those Nazi Monsters were hiding in the open among God fearing American Citizens (silly when you think about it because as we all now know they were gainfully employed by the US government in the birth pangs of what our country has become).  Visually striking on all levels and moving like a well oiled machine Welles movie takes you on a journey that will fascinate you as only his Genius could.  And in the end what brings the Nazi down isn't his desperation or his unflinchingly violent survival instinct..it's his vanity...as Orson knew it would.  A true classic.  The Blu-Ray transfer is too bright at times and something in the transfer makes the sound quality far too strident....I actually preferred the DVD version but both are included in wonderfully restored glory so decide for yourself if this classic entertained Hitchcock (another Welle's bud and Welle's actually screened it for him during editing) as much as I suspect it did.....",1371859200,2,2341,4.758024691358025

But scheduling conflicts forced the project into Welles' hands.  When he put his mind to it, Welles was a Master.  Take a look at this film.  The Welles trademarks are all there.  One-take shots beautifully staged and executed.  Deep contrast black & white photography, overlapping dialogue, and distinct supporting role performances who supplement the New England town of Harper. Welles as usual is just over-the-top with his acting, but it works--it always does.  He's so damn interesting and always specific with his moments.  Edward G. Robinson gives a sublime performance as the Nazi hunter.  The beautiful Loretta Young is fine until she gets to the dramatic bits in the end--she's a bit too hysterical (perhaps it's justified), but needless to say she holds her own in such august company.  When Welles is in a mindset, his work is masterful.  Like ""Touch of Evil"" after it and ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" before it (""Citizen Kane"" as we all know is in a class by itself), no one came close to composing cinematic symphonies like the great Orson Welles.",1364860800,,1216,4.878048780487805
541413,5,6303039405,"Orson Welles pulls out all the stops in this fast paced, feverish thriller -- the opening shadows so intense you can barely see the actors, the quick edits that keep you guessing, and the perfect casting down to the last minor character playing checkers in the town store. Welles and Robinson are matched opposite actors, the nervous and brilliant teacher spinning his web of lies and the little 'everyman' who never looses his cool as he pursues his prey.  Loretta Young almost steals the show as the luminously beautiful and angelic wife who is naive to the evil she has married. Her close up as she watches scenes from Nazi concentration camps is powerful and historic -- the first time post WW2 that a film showed such scenes.

Welles the director keeps things tightly paced, full of plot twists, and with beautifully bizarre shots. The finale in a vertigo-inducing church tower predates Hitchcock's film of the same name by more than a decade. And the Stranger contains virtually all of the stylish elements that came to define film noir, in perhaps the greatest year for the genre (1946), which also included Gilda, the Postman Always Rings Twice, and the Killers. This was one of Welles' biggest box office successes. He followed The Stranger with The Lady from Shanghai.",1364688000,2,1278,4.8577981651376145

Another reviewer quoted both Edward G. Robinson &  Welles as not being ""happy with the final result and even referred to the project as hokum."" I can understand that very well & in fact completely concur. It is interesting that Welles chose to play the role of the villain in this film but it is unfortunate that his character was not as fully developed as it should have been & the end result appeared superficial & slipshod - completely unlike the genius of  Orson Welles as displayed in other films.",1351555200,,728,4.385185185185185
541467,4,6303039405,"The was a plethora of films made in the 1940s and 1950s, mainly suspense thrillers, on the subject of Nazis who may have escaped the Allied dragnet at the end of World War II (not including those Nazis whom those self-same Allies ""turned"" as the red scare cold war night descended on the world) and who, by hook or by crook found safe haven outside of Europe. Waiting, waiting patiently or impatiently, or feverishly plotting as the case may be, for the return of the glory days.  The film under review, the Orson Welles-directed The Stranger falls under that former category.

Here Welles himself, as Professor Rankin, is disguised as a small town America college professor with a distinct predilection for clock towers and is one closet Nazi waiting patiently for those big days ahead. Except that his world turned unexpectedly nasty when one doggedly persistent anti-Nazi hunter played by Edward G. Robinson (last seen in this space as Johnny Rico slapping girls and old geezers around in front of Humphrey Bogart, a definite no-no, in Key Largo) is ready to move might and main to hunt him down.

For a future fuerher though the good professor is something of a bumbler and easy prey for any half-bright professional anti-Nazi hunter. The minute he received news from back home via an unstable intermediary he precedes to murder said messenger setting off a series of events that only drag him down ever more quickly. And not just him but almost his trusting new wife (played by Loretta Young) who takes an extraordinary long time to see that the good professor is a wrong gee, a dead wrong gee. But the good professor will get his just desserts in the end, no question. And no self-respecting anti-Nazi will cry a tear over his fate.",1342828800,,1738,4.748344370860927
541468,3,6303039405,"The rare Orson Welles film to turn a profit during its theatrical run, this is also his least favorite work due to constant studio meddling. The Stranger is more mainstream and digestible than most of his films, with a short running time and direct, hand-holding plot that leaves nothing for interpretation. In many ways that's refreshing, as Welles was often a candidate for getting caught up in himself and indulging in long, dry elaborations on non-central themes. Here we get just a taste of that, in one fantastic dinner table diatribe on the mentality of a Nazi, which benefits from both its brevity and special status as the flick's only real soapbox moment. The plot would have been greatly improved with a bit more ambiguity, though, as it spells everything out in the first act and sits back to watch the pieces fall naturally into place. That left me with a bland taste in my mouth and a starved imagination, dancing with visions of blown potential. Orson never shot an ugly picture, and this is no exception: it's a gorgeous example of extreme noir contrast and creative cinematography. A pity the base, predictable plot doesn't live up to the expectations.",1339632000,,1169,4.85

541537,3,6303039405,"In the aftermath of the second world war, paranonia became one of the major features of American culture. There were conspiracies everywhere. While the politics of paranoia are usually associated with anti-communism, it did exist in many other forms at the time. The Stranger is one example of that paranoia.

Rather than seeing communists under every bed and in every closet, there were some like Orson Wells who saw fascists. What is most remarkable is how similar the mindset and the logic is. There is always the unseen enemy within. There is always the idea of innocent american values being corrupted. There is always the idea of the foreign threat to the all-american ideal. And the idea of the secret conspiracy that aims to overthrow civilization itself. The ultimate observation being that the paranoid mindset was pervasive across American culture of that era.

The film is basically a old fashioned melodrama with archtype characters. We have the ideal New England town full of ideal Americans. But in its midst is an evil foreign looking european clock tower. The symbolism isn't exactly subtile. Nothing in the film is very subtile.

Our villian here is a teacher (corrupting the virtuous American young) who is marrying the pure innocent daughter (corrupting the virtues of our innocent American women) whose father is the local judge (the corruption reaches into the law and the upper class).

A group of nazi-hunters tracks a low-level nazi hoping they will lead them to a upper-level nazi. The upper-level nazi turns out to be our villian living in New England. We then get to the real melodrama. Welles chews the scenery and twirls his non-existent mustache. He tries so hard to be evil that he ends up going way over the top. The low point has him poisoning a dog to cover his tracks.

The film has logic problems all over the place. Welles is supposed to have been a high-ranking nazi. But yet we are told that even after having found him, there is simply no way to identify him or do anything about him. This justifies a further roll down the paranoia path. Rather than just arresting the exposed nazi criminal (which the film claims is impossible), the people around him have to be ""turned"". Its a very HUAC/McCarthy kind of logic that has little to do with the pursuit of nazi war criminals.

The anti-communist hunters had similar problems. They could track down suspected communists. But only through the confessions of others before the committee could they positively identify them publically as communists. The logic of the film anticipates the logic of the House Unamerican Activities committee a few years later.

The film also unfortunately moves into Welles' other preoccupation of that time seen sometimes in his newspaper columns. That the occupation regime in Germany in the immediate postwar period was nowhere near harsh enough. That Germans as a whole had some basic drive toward world conquest and that fascism had some ethnic component to it leading all germans inevitably toward a revival of nazism. In seeing fascism in these terms, he significantly undermines the anti-fascist message of his works and specifically undermines ""the stranger"". Seeing fascism as an ethnic disease rather than a political idea seems very naive and very foolish today.

The film moves on to a sort of conclusion. WASP womanhood turns against nazism and saves the day only after discovering that the nazi plans to kill her as well. We get a good action sequence in the clock tower to wrap things up. But the path taken to get there is rather contrived and silly.

It would have been a better film if it had stuck to a no-nonsense story of tracking down a war criminal. The whole theme of corruption, the conspiracy and the hidden enemy within doesn't add anything good. It would have also been better if (for example) Loretta Young had turned against him because he was a war criminal rather than because he was going to kill her.

In terms of the other aspects of the film, it was another step down from Welles' previous work. The music is a step down. The camera work is a step down. Judged by the standards of the average second rate studio melodramas of the era, its a good film. As a work that aspires higher than that, it has lots of issues.",1329955200,,4269,4.819672131147541

541539,4,6303039405,"This film was based on an Oscar-nominated screenplay and was the first picture after WWII to show real life footage of concentration camps. The focus is on whether the Orson Welles character is an escaped Nazi or not who was part of the think tank for the Final Solution (i.e. the execution of undesirables in Nazi Germany). The investigator is played by Edward G. Robinson in an atypical role as a good guy who comes to the small town of Harper gathering information. There's a good split between the possible sinister evil doer in this Utopian town with a frank innocence that many of the folks seem to possess. The relationships in the town, as well as some of the sub characters, are done particularly well. The ending has some cheesy special effects by the standards of today (like the giant clock) but just go with it. This was one of the few Orson Welles pictures that did quite well at the box office. WHEN WATCHED: end of October 2011(streamed); STORY/PLOTTING: B to B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; SUSPENSE LEVEL: B; OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus; BEST DIALOGUE: Professor Charles Rankin: The German sees himself as the innocent victim of world hatred and conspired against and put upon by inferior people, inferior nations. He cannot admit to error, much less to wrongdoing, not the German. We chose to ignore Ethiopia and Spain, but we learned from our own casualty list the price of looking the other way. Men of truth everwhere have come to know for whom the bell tolled, but not the German. No! He still follows his warrior gods marching to Wagnerian strains, his eyes still fixed upon the firey sword of Siegfried, and he knows subterranean meeting places that you don't believe in. The German's unbroken dream world comes alive, and he takes his place in shining armor beneath the banners of the Yeutonic knights. Mankind is waiting for the Messiah, but for the German, the Messiah is not the Prince of Peace. He's... another Barbarossa... another Hitler. /// Professor Charles Rankin: Murder can be a chain, Mary, one link leading to another until it circles your neck.

541540,4,6303039405,"I haven't viewed the DVD, so I can't address the DVD quality, only the film itself.

This 1946 film tries very hard to be great but doesn't quite succeed, though it is worth seeing and is outstanding in many ways.

Edward G Robinson is the indefatigable Nazi hunter and Orson Wells is the Nazi mastermind Franz Kindler who immediately after World War II somehow manages to slip into a history professorship under the false name Charles Rankin in a small Connecticut town and marry the daughter of a Supreme Court justice.  Both give excellent performances.  I wasn't impressed with Loretta Young's performance, but she isn't one of my favorite actresses of the period anyway.

Orson Wells as the director does a magnificent job of playing with shadows in this black-and-white film to convey a sense of mystery that would be much harder with color, but the music is often just too flamboyant and too often draws too much attention to itself.

I especially liked how we can see the net closing in on Nazi Kindler/Rankin.  We know from the start how the film is bound to end, but we feel suspense anyway, and we can see it in Kindler/Rankin's eyes as the net draws tighter around him.  This part of the film is brilliantly done.

I found the story itself however uneven at best, and often unconvincing.  For a man who as Franz Kindler was the evil genius behind Nazi Germany and who brilliantly pulled the wool over the eyes of good Connecticut Yankees, as Charles Rankin he doesn't appear all that bright, though I won't spoil it for you by revealing details. He just doesn't act like a genius mastermind.  The very final scene on the face of the clock in the clock tower - I won't reveal details - is beautiful and dramatic but also seemed overblown to me.  I would have liked it better if the rest of the film had been as good.

Overall I enjoyed this film and I recommend watching it, especially to anyone who enjoys black-and-white films of the era, but I found myself thinking too much about the flaws that kept it from being a really great film.",1318809600,,2049,4.565573770491803

541608,5,6303039405,"RKO Radio Pictures  presents ""THE STRANGER"" (25 May 1946) (95 min/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) -- The Stranger is often considered Orson Welles' most ""traditional"" Hollywood-style directorial effort --- Welles plays a college professor named Charles Rankin, who lives in a pastoral Connecticut town with his lovely wife Mary (Loretta Young) --- One afternoon, an extremely nervous German gentleman named Meineke arrives in town --- Professor Rankin seems disturbed, but not unduly so, by Meineke's presence --- He invites the stranger for a walk in the woods, and as they journey farther and farther away from the center of town, we learn that kindly professor Rankin is actually notorious Nazi war criminal Franz Kindler --- Conscience-stricken by his own genocidal wartime activities, Meineke has come to town to beg his ex-superior Kindler to give himself up.

The Stranger, while not too complicated, offers a thrilling, suspense-filled plot --- It must have been eerie to viewers who watched it when first released.

541609,3,6303039405,"One of Orson Welles' periodic attempts to prove he could be commercial, The Stranger casts him as a pillar of small town Harper, Connecticut's community, a history teacher, son-in-law of the local judge and also the local Nazi war criminal being tracked down by Edward G. Robinson's Nazi hunter (who susses Welles' true identity when he refuses to acknowledge Karl Marx as a German and dismisses him as a Jew). Robinson underplays his role well and provides a good contrast to Welles' slightly broader portrait (leaving his own wedding reception to bury a body and later doodling a swastika during a phone call), while Loretta Young goes impressively through a nervous breakdown as his unknowing wife.

For the most part eschewing the more expressionistic lighting of film noir for a clean, open-air look (most of the film takes place in bright daylight), the film is in many ways similar but superior to Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt in its portrait of evil hidden in the midst of a respectable and decent community (""In Harper there's nothing to be afraid of,"" a character notes). It's not Welles at his very best, but it does very nicely all the same.

Not so nice is the job you'll have finding a decent DVD copy: since falling into the Public Domain the film has been released by dozens of different labels in prints vary from poor to terrible. MGM's DVD release is one of the better ones, but it's not so easy to find so you might end up having to take pot luck and hope for the best with one of the many budget public domain releases.",1292716800,,1541,4.62043795620438
541610,5,6303039405,"So says the oblivious Loretta Youngs character who is married to a Nazi that has snuck into postwar U.S.A. and become a professor at a local college!
The Stranger is a tense small town ""noir"" that goes non stop with great characters and musical score that keeps you on the edge of your seat.

Orson Welles is pure evil with his paranoid actions and shifty eyes along with  Edward G. Robinson as the Pit Bull on his tail.
The only negative would be Youngs tendency at over acting and being a bit to dramatic.
FYI- the actor that played the town doctor could easily pass for a Joseph Cotten clone right down to the wavy wiry hair. Would have been great to have Cotten here along with his old buddy Welles again....makes you wonder why they did not pick Cotten for the role !",1291507200,2,772,4.354166666666667
541611,3,6303039405,"In later years, Orson Welles considered ""The Stranger"" (1946) his most impersonal filmmaking effort. However, the actor-director imbues a haunting noir atmosphere into this postwar thriller, which emerges as a telling portrait of small-town America. Beneath the simplistic surface of the Connecticut community lies, in the words of War Crimes Inspector Wilson (Edward G. Robinson), an ""obscenity [that] must be destroyed."" The ""obscenity"" is Nazi fugitive Franz Kindler (Welles). In the guise of history professor Charles Rankin, the clock-obsessed Kindler loses all rationality as Wilson widens his net. ""The Stranger"" is notable for the perverse relationship between Kindler and his newly married bride (Loretta Young), who learns of her husband's murderous past yet chooses to protect him. Robinson captures top acting honors with his understated performance, but the film might have been more intriguing if producer Sam Spiegel allowed Welles to use Agnes Moorehead in the Wilson role  thereby resulting in an offbeat gender reversal. Some of the film's darkest moments are weighed heavily in the first half-hour, with cinematographer Russell Metty (who also collaborated with Welles on ""Touch of Evil"") creating a shadowy, menacing atmosphere. Fortunately, ""The Stranger"" has enough Wellesian touches to transcend its conventional framework.",1280188800,,1346,5.797979797979798
541612,3,6303039405,"Orson Welles had a real knack for creating tension.  When you watch his films, even the more subtle ones, you can really sense the dramatic tension he formulates and layers over every scene.

One thing that `The Stranger' isn't lacking is tension.

The film, for me, is a tad too formulaic.  It tells the story of an unreformed Nazi named Franz Kindler who disguises himself as a charming (somewhat) Professor named Charles Rankin.  Charles has established himself rather nicely in a small community, going as far as marrying the Headmaster's daughter Mary.  When a man from his past shows up, he brings with him a Federal Agent intent on finding and exposing Franz.  What ensues is your typical cat and mouse game with a predictable ending.

While I have minor issues with the unimaginative plot (I mean really) I have to admit that the film was engaging and the performances (for the most part) were pretty good.  The script left a lot to be desired (for it tended to go for the obvious and at times even the preposterous) but each actor handled the script rather well.  Some have balked at Welles performance, and it is true that this may be one of his weaker works, but he managed to keep us intrigued.  Sadly, his character doesn't develop as strongly as needed to make him three-dimensional, and his solemn deliver lacks the finesse needed to make Franz a memorable villain, but he does manage to bask his character in enough dread to make him frightening.  Maybe that's more of a directorial compliment than an actorly one.  Loretta Young is effective in her role, even if she doesn't really come screaming to life.  Some of her latter scenes are more impressive.  For me, the film belongs to Edward G. Robinson.  He creates a subtle yet engrossing character in Mr. Wilson.  I'm interested in what would have come form Agnes Moorehead in the role, as was originally intended, but I can't complain about what Robinson was able to draw out of his character.

In the end I'd still recommend this film, despite only giving it a C+.  The direction from Welles is top notch (almost Hitchcockian in scope) and Robinson turns out an awards worthy performance.  I feel that the script was rushed and the ending was almost a throwaway, but overall there is entertainment to be found here, especially if you are a fan of Welles.",1278374400,3,2324,4.691358024691358
541613,5,6303039405,"The Stranger is an outstanding film directed by Orson Welles; we get excellent and very convincing acting and the casting was very well done. The script was well written and the film benefits greatly from superlative cinematography and choreography. The plot moves along at a good pace and I never felt bored. Filmed in black and white, this film is very memorable; and a brief scene in which footage from the concentration camps is used creates a very powerful effect in and of itself.

When the action starts, we quickly learn that Mr. Wilson (Edward G. Robinson), head of The Allied War Crimes Commission not long after World War Two ended, passionately refuses to listen to his peers who argue against releasing a low level Nazi, Konrad Meinike (Konstantin Shayne), who was an aide to an extremely reclusive high level Nazi, Franz Kindler, who ran what Wilson states were the most ""efficient"" Nazi concentration camps in Europe during World War Two. Mr. Wilson lets Meinike escape--and just as Wilson suspected, Meinike leads Wilson straight to where Kindler is hiding--a small town in Connecticut named Harper where Kindler now goes by the alias of history Professor Charles Rankin. Kindler has burned what few pictures there were of himself so nobody knows what he actually looks like; and Kindler's plot to marry Mary Longstreet (Loretta Young), daughter of Supreme Court Justice Adam Longstreet (Philip Merivale), will, he hopes, make him completely unrecognizable while he waits to participate in yet another horrific global conflict from which the Germans might rise victorious.

Wilson is hot on the trail for Kindler but he can't be sure that Kindler is posing as Charles Rankin, nor can he know for sure whom to trust so that Mary's life will never be in danger if she discovers Rankin's true identity as Franz Kindler. Wilson needs help, so he takes a chance and confides a great deal to Mary's brother Noah (Richard Long); and from there the cat-and mouse game begins.

I could tell you more but then I'd be giving too much away--no spoilers here! Suffice it to say that the entire movie is very well done and it held my interest every step of the way even when I thought I had the plot figured out. In addition, look for Martha Wentworth to do a great job of playing Sara, the maid; and Billy House plays general store owner Mr. Potter to perfection.

The Stranger may not be the most remembered film about the aftereffects of World War Two; but it deserves to be; it's definitely an underrated film. Orson Welles did a great job of both directing and starring in this film. I highly recommend this motion picture for anyone interested in the history of World War Two; and fans of the actors in this movie will want to get this for their collections.",1273104000,2,2766,4.7803347280334725

The plot, however, has very serious logical flaws which renders it to the realm of the unbelievable.  Perhaps worth seeing for the nuanced performance of Edward G. Robinson--who, for some odd reason, looks exactly like Charlie Chan.",1272240000,,378,5.732142857142857
541615,5,6303039405,"The thing is, there really is no mystery in this film as far as plot is concerned. From the beginning you know who and what the players represent and you pretty much know what outcome the production code of this era - 1946 - demands. The thrilling part is seeing how everything works out. It is after the war, and Nazi Konrad Meineke has been imprisoned awaiting execution for war crimes. However, the real target of the Allied task force is Franz Kindler (Orson Welles), who is supposedly the mastermind behind the concentration camps and the genocide practiced there. The only problem is, nobody knows what he looks like - there are no photographs. Wilson (Edward G. Robinson), a member of the Allied task force, decides to let Meineke escape, knowing that as Kindler's right-hand man during the war he will lead the Allies right to Kindler. Meineke does just that and Wilson follows close behind, all the way to the small New England town where Kindler is living under the identity of Professor of History Charles Rankin. Unfortunately for Wilson, before Meineke can contact Kindler, Meineke spots him as someone who is tailing him and gives him a huge headache - knocking him unconscious. However, Meineke believes he has killed the man.

Meineke and Kindler represent the two types of evil. Meineke is the type that tries to fool himself - he believes that if he confesses his past sins to God he can escape consequences, and even continue on doing evil - such as his decision to kill Wilson - as long as he keeps confessing those sins once they are past. No real change has occurred. Kindler is the kind of evil that is content to fool others. When such men meet, the type that levels with himself always has the upper hand over the one that fools himself, and thus it is with Meineke and Kindler. Kindler decides - with him believing that the only person tailing Meineke is dead - that killing Meineke will cut the last link between himself and the past, and that is what he does.

The last step in Kindler's plan to elevate himself above suspicion is to marry the daughter of a Supreme Court Judge (Loretta Young), and so he does, only hours after he wipes Meineke's blood from his hands. The fly in the ointment is that Wilson is not actually dead, and knows that Kindler is in the town somewhere under an assumed name. Wilson soon narrows his focus to Rankin/Kindler, and the rest of the film is the odd dance that these two do as each of these people know who the other is but cannot prove it and cannot tip their respective hands before the time is right.

Robinson is very effective as Wilson, whose precision in his hunt matches Kindler's and as such he is left a rather unpersonalized and objective character - he isn't even given a first name here. He only shows passion in the opening and closing scenes. Welles' Franz Kindler is a ticking time bomb whose smooth facade gradually cracks under the tension of Wilson's methodical pursuit, as he is accustomed to being the cat, not the mouse. Highly recommended.

As for the product itself, the audio and video are excellent and the case sturdy. However, and most unfortunately, there are absolutely no extras. What a great commentary track could have been designed for such an interesting film.",1267920000,2,3259,4.642980935875217

541695,5,6303039405,"These Bonus Features are rare and AWSOME!!!  Following on from his newspaper column in the New York Post, Orson Welles offered a weekly political radio broadcast, covering such topics as the OPA (Office of Price Administration,) atomic bomb tests, and the blinding of war veteran Isaac Woodard.

Everyone knows ""Citizen Kane,"" not so many remember ""The Stranger"" from 1946, a quiet, low-key thriller that is unrelentlessly paced and flawlessly acted. It stars Orson Welles as a Nazi war criminal who has escaped to middle-America and claimed a new life for himself; when a stranger comes looking for him, his entire life is tossed upside down and he even becomes suspicious of his wife's intentions. (Resulting in a darkly gripping scene.) This movie is one of Welles' finest and probably one of the greatest of all time. His direction is top-notch and although it may not be quite as showy or glossed-over as ""Citizen Kane,"" and the film's scale is not as epic, it doesn't need to be.

This works very successfully as a simple low-key thriller and the fact that it doesn't try to achieve anything more is one of its better traits.

But it's been in the public domain for years, so you could get waylaid on your way to the market if you're looking to buy a good copy.  As an actual Amazon customer who bought this Triad edition of this DVD, I have some very specific information I can share with you, and it'll be my pleasure.

What you need to know is this: this Triad edition came straight out of the public domain.  I bought this back in December, at which time Triad was promoting it as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Stranger-Remastered/dp/B001AS8HGA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Stranger (Remastered)</a>.  This was a false claim, and they eventually changed the affix to ""enhanced,"" which was equally as false, but less specific.  The Triad on-demand DVD-R transfer lacked the studio banner at the start of the film, so it jumped right into the opening credits with stuttering, plangent sound.  The image at first would not remain centered, swinging from side to side, as if it were transferred to video by a hand-held device while at sea.  The picture was very murky, a heavily damaged print with extremely low resolution, with faded blacks.  I think the source was a video tape, the copy identical to the one you can download yourself for free at Internet Archive.  I was outraged.  Thanks to Amazon's return policy, I immediately got a refund and ordered MGM's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Stranger-MGM-Film-Noir/dp/B000PMFRVU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Stranger (MGM Film Noir)</a>&nbsp;instead.

After I got the refund settled, I returned to the Triad page and wrote a scathing review.  By the quickly tallied ""yes"" votes, it was very successful in warning customers away from it and steering them toward a legitimate studio release.  Eventually Triad quit manufacturing the DVD, but it looks like they've returned with a whole new package.  This new design, with a noirish still from the film, looks classier than it did here,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Stranger-Enhanced/dp/B001AS8HGA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Stranger (Enhanced)</a>.  But the quality of the DVD will be the same, since Triad is not a studio and does not have access to a print.  It'll be that same public domain copy from Internet Archive (google it; you'll find all sorts of interesting stuff there for the taking), the only copy they have access to.

As for MGM's edition of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Stranger-MGM-Film-Noir/dp/B000PMFRVU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Stranger (MGM Film Noir)</a>, they restored the studio banner at the beginning of the film, and the image is sharp and crisp, obviously transferred from an actual print, and recently enough that it looked good upconverted from my Sony BDP to my 47"" HDTV.  The blacks were rich and the sound was clean.  The print and transfer were so good, fine grain was visible in spots, with no glitches or dropped frames.  Some minor scratches were infrequently visible, which I noticed only because I was looking so closely.  As a noir classic, this film truly deserves a frame-by-frame restoration.  Until then,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Stranger-MGM-Film-Noir/dp/B000PMFRVU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Stranger (MGM Film Noir)</a>&nbsp;is the best edition available.

541700,5,6303039405,"Too much is often made of the fact that Welles helmed this thriller to convince the studios he could make a commercially successful film without the costly overruns associated with his other projects. Getting lost in the debate over whether he should have given in and made it, or whether it falls short of the genius he was capable of, is just what a fantastic film he did make. The Stranger is, in fact, one of the best suspense thrillers made during the 1940's. Set after WWII in a small Connecticut town where everyone knows everyone else, Victor Trivis' story is told with flair by director Welles. Rather than surrounding himself with familiar faces from his Mercury days, beautiful Loretta Young and Edward G. Robinson round out this engrossing and suspenseful tale of wartime evil waiting for its chance to rise again.

Robinson is brilliant as the easygoing Washington agent who allows a Nazi war criminal who has found God, loose, in order to track him to Franz Kindler; one of the most notorious Nazis of all. Wilson (Robinson) loses him in sleepy Harper, Connecticut, and he is suddenly nowhere to be found. He suspects he has been murdered by Kindler, but since no pictures of the mass murderer exist, he must stick around and play detective. Robinson underplays the part of Wilson, giving him humor and determination, and an easygoing persona which other than his three piece suit, fits in more with Harper than Washington. His checker games with the town clerk are fun to watch. But this is a Welles' film, after all, so something sinister must be alive and well also.

Welles takes his cue from Robinson, portraying Professor Charles Rankin (Kindler) with style, but not the brooding focus he might have otherwise. He is about to marry the beautiful daughter of a Supreme Court Justice on the day Wilson and his old pal arrives in Harper. Loretta Young is at her most stunning here, and does a fine job as Rankin's wife. She loves her husband and is completely fooled. Wilson nearly dismisses him as a suspect as well after a grand dinner table speech about ridding the world of evil, until he suddenly realizes Kindler has made a slip! What follows is a game of cat and mouse, tensions escalating as Mary's (Loretta Young) younger brother becomes a quiet ally of Wilson's. Richard Long, who would go on to play Jarrod in The Big Valley on television is good as her caring brother, Noah.

Charles spins a web of convincing lies to Mary until Wilson plants the seed of doubt. He knows once Kindler senses weakness, it is only a matter of time until he makes his move. But it is a dangerous plan which could cost Mary her life. An atmospheric score by Bronislaw Kaper and some nice noir touches from cinematographer Russell Metty add up to a fabulous time at the movies. While it may not have been cinematically innovative, this thriller about evil residing in sleepy surroundings and good desperately trying to triumph makes for grand entertainment. A fine film in the genre.",1237075200,3,2990,4.735124760076776
541701,4,6303039405,"""The Stranger"" is a very engaging film. Orson Welles courageously portrays a man that is so bad, that a War Crimes Commission allows another Nazi war criminal to ""escape"" from prison, in order that he will inadvertedly lead them to Welles. Naturally, once Welles is on to the idea that people are looking for him in Connecticutt, no less, he must kill all who dare expose him.

The supporting cast is great. Edward G. Robinson, who was famous for playing gangsters in Warner Brothers pictures in the 1930s and 1940s heroically plays a war crimes commission official closing in on the evil Nazi. Loretta Young gives a very good performance as a woman that marries Welles not knowing who he really is, or what he has done.

The film benefits from its temporal proximity to the end of World War II. In 1945 the horrors of the Nazi death camps were revealed to many for the first time, and the film came out in 1946. For this reason, the film carries an even stronger urgency for the forces of humanity to hold Nazi war criminals accountable for their wicked actions. Beyond that important quality, the movie is pure Film Noir. It looks great as characters move about in the shadows and speak in whispers while manifesting emotional pain, shock, and desperation. Ms Young is particularly good in expressing emotions.

Quite fascinating is the metaphor of Welles obsessed as a man interested in tinkering with clocks as a hobby. Naturally, such a man is obsessed with going forward, stopping the clock, or finding any way he can to alter time in his obsession to move away from the unspeakable crimes he had committed. Moreover, the large clock in the town symbolically serves as indicator that time may be running out for some in that town. Also, one can practically hear the ""tick-tick'tick"" each time Edward G. Robinson says something revealing that he is getting closer to learning the identity of the criminal he believes is hiding out in that American town.

As for the DVD itself, well, I have some criticism. This is supposed to be a restored film? If it was restored, then someone needs to go back to work on it some more. I think the sound quality is lacking, and the picture could used some additional digital restoration. It was not restored badly, it just needs more work accomplished. This film is too good to sell as a half-baked presentation. It is not as great as ""Citizen Kane,"" of course, but the movie is ONE OF ORSON WELLES' BEST MOVIES. He deserves better treatment on DVD. Moreover, some people have claimed that there is original film footage missing from this DVD. I don't know for certain that there is, but if that is the case, then that is another problem that should be rectified in a future restored version of the movie (providing the footage still exists, naturally).

Still, if this is the only way available for people to see the film, then I recommend that people buy and see this version. For my part, I am awaiting a better restoration of ""The Stranger"" to become available before I say anything about ""definitive"" version. This DVD is much better than any scratchy print exhibited on the late show, but definitely does not meet the criterion of ""superb"" print.",1232841600,,3193,4.694642857142857
541702,4,6303039405,"When looking for a good DVD edition of ""The Stranger,"" it's difficult to tell from among all the copies floating around which one is a quality transfer from an actual print of the film.  The problem arises because ""The Stranger"" has fallen into the public domain.  That means any basement-dwelling hustler can legally download it for free from some site like Internet Archive, slap it onto a blank DVD, print a label for it, and sell the slapdash product as ""remastered"" or some such.  And a lot of these customer reviews aren't much help, reviewing the movie itself instead of telling you what you really want to know, which is the quality of the image on the disc.  So there's no way to tell what you're getting until after you've ordered it.  Well, I'm more than happy to tell you exactly what you need to know.

Bottom line: if you're looking for a good copy of this movie,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Stranger-MGM-Film-Noir/dp/B000PMFRVU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Stranger (MGM Film Noir)</a>&nbsp;is the best available edition.  It's manufactured by MGM, and bears the studio logo when the DVD starts up.  The image itself is a quality transfer from a good master from a consistently clear print, fully intact.  That's important, because some of these extremely messy public domain copies are missing the ""Independent Releasing Corporation"" banner before the credits begin, a sure sign that worse things are to follow.  Though this edition has not undergone a frame-by-frame digital restoration, it's sharp, with rich blacks and good contrast, with enough detail to reveal the flaws in the source material, the ordinary marks of age such as scratches in some spots, which I noticed only because I was viewing it so critically.  Otherwise, these flaws are negligible.  The important point is that, while it's not perfect, it's a studio transfer from a good master of a preserved print, free of jumps or jiggling from bad splices, and no cracks or pops on the soundtrack.  And even more satisfying, when upconverted on my HDTV, soft natural grain was visible, which demonstrates just how accurate the transfer is.  I was very, very pleased by this edition.  VERY pleased.

A couple of weeks ago, I ordered the trashy Triad edition because of the claim that it was ""remastered.""  It was expensive enough, so I believed it.  It was an out-and-out fraudulent claim, and I immediately returned it and bought this one instead.  It doesn't matter that it's not remastered, because whatever master they're using meets the studio standard, and manufactured with regard for customer satisfaction.  Perhaps one day we'll get a fully digitally restored edition, but for now,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Stranger-MGM-Film-Noir/dp/B000PMFRVU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Stranger (MGM Film Noir)</a>&nbsp;is the best edition on the market.

As for this Triad edition, it looks like Triad has changed the title of this dungeon-produced rubbish from ""The Stranger (Remastered)"" to ""The Stranger (Enhanced)."" Well, it doesn't matter what they're naming it, it'll be the same rip-off it was on December 16th, when I bought it under the ""remastered"" affix. I fell for it because the newer release date and the high price suggested that it's one of the hi-tech transfers, with the advanced home theater in mind, implying that it'll look good on your HDTV. But when the DVD arrived, it was a sham, the claim to be ""remastered"" out-and-out false. Nothing has been done to it, neither ""remastered"" or ""enhanced."" It's not even a good print, aside from whatever false claim of enhancements they've made. It's a copy Triad retrieved from the public domain, possibly from a site like Internet Archive, which has a vast library of public domain media anyone can access. This print was dirty and blurry and shaky, and one of the worst DVDs I'd ever seen. The print is so degraded, it doesn't even include the studio banner at the beginning of the film. In fact, it looks EXACTLY like the copy you can download yourself -- for free -- from the aforementioned Internet Archive.

Incensed by such an obviously bald-faced misrepresentation, I returned to this page to further investigate this product. Most important was the discovery of this statement in italics at the very bottom of the product description: ""This product is manufactured on demand using DVD-R recordable media."" DVD-R recordable media are those blank DVDs you buy on a spindle at most retailers. ""On demand"" means that your Triad edition of ""The Stranger"" won't even exist until after YOU order it. That wouldn't in itself be a bad thing. But it reveals what sort of operation Triad is, that it's a small-time operation that doesn't have facilities to remaster or enhance anything. What they DO have is an internet connection they use to download stuff from public domain.

And what about these 4- and 5-star reviews? Well, let's take a second look. While those ""customers"" are quick to slap a 4- or 5-star rating on it, none of them actually bothered to mention the image quality of this disc. That's suspicious, because the image is so degraded, any customer who bought it would be sure to note it. An explanation can be gained by clicking on the see-all-my-reviews link next to each name. What you'll see is that all of these ""customers"" reviewed an inordinate share of Triad releases. In other words, these positive reviews are planted by Triad itself. So what does that tell me?

For one, it tells me that there are a lot of films at Internet Archive I can get for free.

For another, it tells me you can't trust these positive reviews.  In fact, Triad -- which has recently changed its brand in the product description for some of their DVDs to ""Public Domain Flicks"" -- has gone out of its way to make sure you see nothing else but their phony positive reviews.  They've gotten Amazon to delete THIS review seven times now.  SEVEN TIMES!  I've got to give it to them, they're determined.

In conclusion, I asked for -- and got -- a refund, then ordered ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Stranger-MGM-Film-Noir/dp/B000PMFRVU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Stranger (MGM Film Noir)</a>.""  It's cheaper and while it doesn't claim to be remastered (or enhanced), it's been mastered directly from a studio print. And though it hasn't undergone a frame-by-frame restoration, it DOES look good on my HDTV. I was very pleased. The Triad edition is simply unacceptable, and especially at the price they're charging. Normally you'd find a product this bad in a thin cardboard sleeve and dumped in a $1 bin next to the checkout counter. If you want the copy Triad's selling, go to Internet Archive. You'll get it free.

In this movie, The Trial, Josef was arrested at his own apartment and had to stand trial before his totalitarian neighbors.

541800,5,6303039405,"One of those films that tried to show Nazi criminals being chased and hunted down after the war. Unluckily that was grandly nothing but propaganda. A great number of them did escape and survived decades before dying in their beds. Some were even recuperated by the allies, western or eastern allies, to become the spearheads of their armament industry during the Cold War. In this case Orson Welles does a nice job because he shows the Nazi as a hateful man, both full of hate and inspiring hate, from the very start, so that we wonder why a good family daughter could have fallen in love with him. Then Orson Welles builds a nice machine that is nearly as precise as a clock, the clock in the church tower. And in fact it so happens that it is the clock that is the main character that actually erase the criminal off the surface of the living. An unthankful ungrateful clock that kills the one who had repaired it. And there we are. We don't have to do anything with that criminal. I guess God took care of him. A little bit naive but a film that works rather well even if the suspense is limited to just enough for us to forget that the film has to have a good ending. It is a shame in a way that Orson Welles had to do such films that were nothing but cheap propaganda to accumulate the good points and the money he needed to do the very few real good ones we will remember him for. Orson  Welles was never trusted enough to be able to use his genius and genial inspiration in films that could have changed the face of the cinema. But did any one want to change the face of the cinema? That is THE question.

541802,4,6303039405,"While no means comparable to Welles' masterpieces ""Citizen Kane"" or ""The Trial,"" ""The Stranger"" shines not because it offers anything spectacular as far as the cinema is concerned.  Where it does succeed, despite itc conventional storyline is in characterization in the leads.  Robinson is superb as the uncompromising Nazi-hunter bent on finding and bringing ex-Nazi Franz Kindler to justice for war crimes; Loretta Young as Kindler's pretty but naive wife is a bit trite but because of the strong performances by Robinson and Welles can be overlooked.

Welles himself, is convincing as ever as the ex-Nazi masquerading as Mr. Rankin, the favorite teacher at boys' prep school giddy at the irony that he will be married to Supreme Court Justice Longstreet's (Young) daughter. Even Richard Long, before he would become familiar to television audiences as Jarod Barkley of ""The Big Valley,"" delivers a notable performance as Noah Longstreet, brother to Young, who is the first to really suspect the man his sister married is not who he claims to be.

It all works here and manages to entertain throughout. I love how Welles uses the theme of time and linked Kindler and Robinson's character together through their passion for clocks and their methodical attention to detail---Robinson with his notepad trying to establish a timeline for Rankin/Kindler's murder of a fellow Nazi co-patriot in the shadowy woods not far from the town.  Welles, uses light and shadow quite liberally here and to great effect establishing an unmistakable atmosphere of menace and evil. We, the audience, quickly identify with Young's and Robinson's character--we want Rankin/Kindler caught--especially after what he does to Red--Noah's dog for attempting to uncover Kindler's murder.

For those who admire Welles' work will enjoy this film; if you are an Eddie G fan--you will love it and recognize some of the gifts this actor has to offer.

541835,4,6303039405,"**Please note: This review is for the MGM/Film Noir Series release of ""The Stranger"" NOT any of the public domain releases**

""The Stranger"" proves that Orson Welles could deliver a film on time and within budget. ""The Stranger"" almost seems like an answer to Hitchcock's ""Shadow of a Doubt"" in that it tackles many of the same themes from a different perspective. While Hitchcock's film ""The Stranger"" creates a complex villian in Franz Kindler/Charles Rankin. The MGM version is the one to get since it goes back to the RKO Vault (RKO which is a bit of irony considering that Welles made ""Citizen Kane"" for the studio and had his film ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" butchered by the studio while he was in South America partying and working on ""It's All True""). Welles' original version can 115 minutes while the final version was recut by producers Sam Spiegel (the producer of ""Lawrence of Arabia"" working under the name S. E. Eagel) and Bill Goetz (who helped finace the project). If any of the footage cut still exists it is probably lost which is a pity as according to comments/notes that Welles made over the years the film had a much longer prologue.

MGM delivers one of the better looking versions on DVD that I've seen. There are public domain DVD that are floating around but most of them I've seen have been from inferior 16mm or faded prints that don't do the moody cinematography justice. We do get alternate language tracks in French and Spanish for the film but no commentary track which is disappointing given that this is a Welles film. I'm sure that Simon Callow (who wrote the two excellent Welles biographies ORSON WELLES: THE ROAD TO XANADU and ORSON WELLES: HELLO AMERICANS) could have provided an excellent commentary based on his observations on the film in his second volume of his Welles' biographies. We don't even get a vintage trailer for the film. A featurette on the film's production (it was one of Welles' most profitable films which is important in and of itself), changes that Spiegel made to the film and Welles' own comments which have been videotaped/recorded over the years would have been valuable. Regardless, this is a fine film which finally looks excellent (with some minor flaws due to age and damage)that should have been treated better by MGM.

**SPOILER ALERT**

Welles plays Charles Rankin a man with a mysterious past . He's a history professor teaching and living in a small town marrying the daughter of a Supreme Court Justice Mary (Loretta Young). Just before the wedding Rankin's past comes calling with a visit by a man named Meinike (Konstantin Shayne). A former Nazi, Meinike has been released by a government agent named Wilson(Edward G. Robinson) in a game of cat and mouse. Wilson hopes that Meinike will lead him to an Franz Kindler a Nazi at large. He does just that but before Wilson can act Rankin murders Meinike to close off his past. Suddenly Rankin's carefully cultivated identity (and Mary's world)becomes unraveled as Wilson doggedly closes in on him.

**END OF SPOILER ALERT**

Welles had a troubled history for all of his films which often meant that the films were compromised. Nevertheless, ""The Stranger"" plays as a strong suspense thriller although the often shrill and over-the-top music score doesn't quite work for the film. This is another example where Bernard Herrmann would have added signficantly to the film if he had been hired to do the score.  Film noir fans will enjoy this flawed Welles classic which has a number of dazzling set pieces particularly the stunning and unique conclusion at the clock tower.

While this edition which is part of MGM's ""Film Noir"" series lacks any special features(the film could have used a commentary track from any one of Welles' fine biographers particularly Simon Callow), the film looks pretty good overall. It hasn't been restored and has some minor print damage but overall looks quite nice.  4 stars for the presentation 0 stars for the extras. Perhaps MGM will reconsider their decision to release this without extras when Warner releases ""The Magnificient Ambersons"" on DVD late this year (2007) or early next (2008--depends upon how quickly they can assemble the material now that they've found a good source print).

Although a bare bones release, this is definitely the version to get for film fans. It's a pity though that MGM decided to treat the film with so little care given that it is a Welles film with a strong cast. Other Welles films worth getting:

I recently purchased the Kino blu ray. Agree with others that the MGM DVD transfer remains the best one. The transfer on the blu ray is well done for what they had to work with and the bonus material adds a lot of value. Sadly, when titles are ""preserved"" by the Library of Congress, it does not necessarily mean that they possess the camera negative. This is obviously the case here, as they seem to hold only a 35mm release print submitted by International Pictures for copyright purposes (this is all discussed in the audio commentary--the print's flaws are openly admitted, albeit not on the packaging!). Somehow, MGM/UA holds the vault material for this title, which was previously held by Turner, who released an excellent laserdisc thru Image. Apparently, Kino wasn't willing to pay MGM a license fee for their superior elements on this title. A missed opportunity, yes, but I suspect said license fee might have overstretched the budget for Kino's blu ray release. I don't necessarily agree with the attitude, but the interest nowadays for these classic films is limited and these companies have to make a profit on anything they release.

Critics agree that this film is second-rate Welles.  In my opinion, it is still a very good film indeed. Welles was striving, at this time, to stop the incipient sliding of his Hollywood credibility. He was determined to do what too many influential people were saying he couldn't do:  make a mainstream, popular film which still met his standards for originality and quality, and moreover, to bring it home on schedule and within budgetary limitations. I think ""The Stranger"" accomplished his objectives. There was some studio tampering with the story, but it remains a very solid thriller with above-average character complexity, realized by dedicated performances across the board. Welles's gifts for lighting and camera work are strongly evident, while not as flashy as in some of his other films.  His editing, particularly as related to pacing, is definitely up to standard.

It could also be argued that the film suffers from the fact that it is designed to please the studio executives that Welles depended upon for income(it had been 4 years since his last movie and he had to prove that he still had it).

But if that is the case, it only goes to show that an Orson Welles working under economic and artistic limitations still managed to make a movie vastly more interesting than countless blockbusters before and after.

For its sheer tautness, honesty and energy, I like this movie  better than both ""Citizen Kane"" and The lady from Shanghai"". In my opinion it is part of the sacred Welles Trinity (""A touch of evil"" and, obviously, ""The third man"" being the other two), and one of the best films ever made.

Because you should really see this one and judge for yourselves, I am not going to give a detailed story synopsis. But i want to point out that it is VERY exciting in spite of the fact that you get to ""know"" the main storylines and what will be the inevitable outcome early on in the film (you don't know HOW it will happen...)

And of course, it is not just an accidental detail that Charles Rankin happens to be a teacher of world history- nor that he is about to marry the daughter of a US Supreme Court Judge. And that ending...Typical Welles-ian mischievousness.

541914,3,6303039405,"This movie could only have been made immediately after World War Two.  It was already ""dated"" a couple of years after the war ended.  It had to come along as soon as the war ended, at a time when the American people finally knew about the Holocaust but had not yet transfered their animosity from Germany to Russia.  Thus the date of the movie - 1946, possibly the only year it could have come out.

This makes it a very specialized movie, one that would only make sense during an extremely short window of time.  The villain, Orson Welles, is a Nazi who has every intention of renewing the struggle begun by Hitler.  The word ""Nazi"" inspires horror in Orson's new wife, Loretta Young.  Orson is incognito, a secret Nazi with a terrific American accent, a former leader of the Holocaust, masquerading as an innocent schoolteacher.

The movie held my interest.  It seemed quaint in its focus on the danger of the Nazi party in post-war America.  It seemed like a dusty antique.

Other reviewers on this site point to the connection between director Orson Welles and Alfred Hitchcock.  I can't put my finger on exactly why or how, but this film does feel like a Hitchcock film to some degree.  And yes, I did notice the ever present cigar in the mouth of Edward G. Robinson, Nazi hunter.

How did Robinson know that Welles was a secret Nazi?  He learned it over dinner, I think.  He was asking Welles for his opinion of the German question, just what to do about them, and Welles replied that all Germans should be exterminated because they are simply too dangerous and incorrigible.  But then Welles gave himself away, by denying that Karl Marx was a German, referring to him only as a non-German, a Jew.  The wily Robinson decided there was something suspicious in that, something Nazi-ish.

The funny part to me is that Karl Marx was being lauded as a freedom lover, a sort of American in his love of freedom.  It's hysterical.  A few years later, Marxism would be vilified in America.

As I said, this film could only have been done in 1946, a very short window of opportunity, before the McCarthy era, before the arms race with Russia, before America's love affair with Stalin ended.

Isn't it a pity that America and Russia, who both fought so hard and sacrificed so much to win the single most important war in the history of mankind, couldn't come out of it as friends.  But keep in mind that Russia originally wanted to be on Germany's side of it, until they were attacked by their ally.

After all, shortly before the war broke out, Russia was sending troops across Poland to split the country with their German allies.

Other than the history lesson, all I can say is that it was a pretty interesting period piece, not a masterpiece, but worth a look.

Loretta Young plays an idiot.  It seems like an odd role for her.",1137542400,,2827,4.544554455445544
541915,3,6303039405,"""The Stranger"" was Orson Welles'  effort to show RKO studios that he could deliver a movie on time and within budget. It worked so far as that goes. It was his first commercial success as a director. Mr. Wilson (Edward G. Robinson), an agent of the Allied War Crimes Commission, has decided to let Konrad Meineke (Konstantin Shayne) go free in hopes that the man will lead authorities to his former boss: Franz Kindler, a fictional mastermind of the Nazi genocide. Meineke tracks Kindler to the quiet town of Harper, Connecticut, with Wilson close on his tail. But before he can see who Meineke meets, Wilson is knocked unconscious. Working from a list of men who arrived in town within the past year, Wilson narrows the suspects down to Mr. Charles Rankin (Orson Welles), a professor at the local boys prep school who has recently married Mary Longstreet (Loretta Young), daughter of a famously liberal Supreme Court Justice.

The trouble with ""The Stranger"" is that we have a bunch of one-dimensional characters in a story that is just plain dull. The great Edward G. Robinson does nothing more than recite lines as Wilson the Nazi hunter. Charles Rankin/ Franz Kindler does an amusing -but implausible- job of deriding Germany while betraying his Nazi ideals all the same. Kindler is so obviously unstable and out of his mind that he's really a cop-out: The Nutty Nazi. An excuse not to write a real character with credible motives. Mary is a nice woman who inexplicably goes along with her husband's bullying and ill treatment of her dog. But Loretta Young is responsible for the only credible emotion in this film: Her hysterical denial when she is told that her husband is a Nazi war criminal. ""The Stranger"" might work as an unsophisticated thriller, but it is devoid of character writing and interesting plot points. This terrific trio of thespians -Robinson, Welles, and Young- is wasted.

The DVD (Delta Entertainment 2001): This print of ""The Stranger"" is unrestored but without major flaws. The ""delta"" logo appears in the lower righthand corner of the screen 3 times during the film, however. The logo appears for less than a minute and then disappears at these points in the film:  51 minutes, 1:11, and at 1:31. There is a ""Bonus Trailer"" for Welles' 1958 film ""Touch of Evil"" (2 minutes) and a ""Tony Curtis Intro"" (3  minutes) in which Curtis says a little about ""The Stranger"" and about Orson Welles' career. The second feature on the DVD, ""Orson Welles on Film"" (30 minutes), is a documentary about Welles' films, meaning those he directed. It says a little about Welles' youth and radio days before tracing his career from his 6-picture contract with RKO, though his Hollywood and European periods, until the recognition he received from Hollywood in the 1970s and 1980s. The emphasis is on the films he directed, with only brief discussion of each film.",1128988800,2,2873,4.855102040816327
541916,4,6303039405,"Several years ago, the recut and re-released classic TOUCH OF EVIL revived interest in the work of director Orson Welles, and rightfully so. But what's to be said of THE STRANGER, often sniffed at by Welles scholars as being ""too conventional""?

Actually, quite a bit.

THE STRANGER was made at a time when Welles hadn't directed a film in nearly four years. At that time, rumors were circulating as to his unreliability (and lack of marketability). To a certain extent, his reputation for being an out-of-control highbrow was deserved.  He was also, however, an undeniable talent.

THE STRANGER demonstrates this. While the story of the escaped Nazi Franz Kindler (played by Welles) is told in straightforward fashion, there are flourishes of camera and characterization worthy of the maker of CITIZEN KANE. I have to admit that Welles himself in the lead is a bit hammy at times; however, Edward G. Robinson (as a Nazi-hunter) and Loretta Young (as Kindler's unsuspecting wife) have never been better. The plot, too, is quite suspenseful, aided by lively dialogue written by Anthony Viellor, John Huston, and Welles himself.

And Welles the director keeps the picture moving. Particularly fine are the scenes wherein the frightened Young discovers her husband's true identity; the ensuing cat-and-mouse game gets a grip on the audience that doesn't relax until the bravura finale.

Along the way are Wellesian touches that complement--rather than intrude on--the story. Billy House and Constantin Shane (in smaller parts) make significant impact; the scene near the beginning where Kindler murders a good friend is effectively done with crane shots; and a film- within-the-film introduces the Holocaust to American moviegoers. Good, too, is the performance of Richard Long as Young's little brother.

In later life, Welles brushed off THE STRANGER, calling it the most impersonal of his movies, done only to show that he could direct as well as the next fellow (which, according to some wags, meant coming in under budget and on schedule). This is unfair to THE STRANGER, which is a taught, intelligent, well-made thriller, and--at Amazon prices--a great addition to any film buff's DVD collection.",1122595200,,2200,5.232954545454546
541917,4,6303039405,"Few people have heard of, let alone seen this movie so there is much talk over it's relevance to the Welles' canon, so let me try to clear a few things up.  After the social (and only social) disaster that was Citizen Kane, Welles rapidly became a much loathed person in Hollywood.  Funny how attaching the head of all of the media industry can do that.  And after RKO destroyed his epic, The Magnificent Ambersons-possibly the saddest story in all of Hollywood- and also after pulling the plug on his ill-fated and once again Lost masterpiece, It's All True (a documentary on the Brazilian culture and their everyday struggles), they pegged Welles as a man who runs up movie budgets astronomically with little attention to a studios' demands.  Now while that may have been true to some of his work (Lady from Shanghai for instance), it certainly wasn't true for It's all True.  And so once again Welles was seen as an outsider that few production companies wanted anything to do with.  So he desperately needed a hit to get back in and on the good side of Hollywood.  And thus you have, The Stranger.

A suspense tale about postwar Nazi's hiding in America's suburbia.  Now this is often said to be below Welles, so let me explain.  One, Welles admittedly said this was for entertainment ( an easy popcorn flick) rather than art, and two, he once again like so many of his other films, had it drastically re-edited without his approval.  Little is known about Welles' version other than that he had a twenty-minute documentary about the end of the Nazi regime to begin the film.  Most likely a segue into the story so people had a better understanding of the circumstances surrounding the story.

The beginning of the film (the re-edited beginning that is) is brilliant and top notch Welles with it's mix of paranoia, suspense and an overall haunting atmosphere featuring some if his typically ""Wellesian compositions"" (always a treat).  However, the brilliance, dies down after that point into a rather straightforward suspense drama.  The interesting angles and metaphoric lighting are nowhere to be scene; although, it does occasionally use some of Welles trademark close-ups.  The plot is standard, I don't consider it to be ""hammy"" as some reviewers have said but it doesn't hold a candle to Hitchcock in terms of suspense.  But then again, Welles intentionally dumbed-down the movie in hopes that  audiences would like that.

It does feature some great acting though.  Edward G. Robinson does a masterful job playing the detective meant to capture Professor Charles Rankin ( Welles).  Rankin's wife, Loretta Young, also does a magnificent job in her role as well.  Many have said Welles overacted this one, but I don't see it.  He's being hunted down for Nazi war crimes and the detective keeps closing in on him, little by little.  I don't know about you, but that would make me a bit shaky and overly paranoid.  Towards the end, we get little treats here and there of those lovely ""Wellesian-compositions.""  And then of coarse you have the famous clock tower ending.  Now in my opinion, it wasn't quite as good or suspenseful as I had hoped it to be but it is interesting and will consistently have your attention.

Probably the most noteworthy affair that takes place in the film is that you are shown actual footage of the Nazi concentration camps.  Now this is first time in Hollywood that footage of the atrocity is placed in a movie.  That alone, gives The Stranger some historical legitimacy.

Sadly, despite Welles' best intentions this movie failed at the box office and he was again cast into obscurity for years as a director (although still doing bit parts in movies here and there).  As far as it's relevance to the canon, I would say it's recommended for die-hard Welles' fans but not necessary for cinephiles.  It doesn't really offer up anything new or needed, but can be a fun (if still sub par) watch for Welles' fans (just rent it once really).  But for those of you who liked this side of Welles  but just didn't care for the artistically low-quality, check out his masterpiece, Touch of Evil.  It's astonishing in every way and definitely demanded viewing for fans of Welles or just the Cinema.  A timeless work of art.",1120694400,2,4248,4.76986301369863
541918,3,6303039405,"In 1946, Orson Welles' career was in a tailspin.  His battle to get ""Citizen Kane"" released branded him a troublemaker in Hollywood. RKO heavily cut Welles' follow-up to Kane, ""The Magnificent Ambersons,"" while Welles himself was in South America, directing the ill-fated documentary ""It's All True"" (which wouldn't see the light of day until after Welles' death).  To jump-start his directorial career, Welles agreed to direct ""The Stranger,"" a modestly enjoyable thriller that bears few of Welles' stylistic hallmarks.

Edward G. Robinson pursues the title character (Welles), who may or may not be an escaped Nazi, through a sleepy Connecticut town. Complicating matters is that Welles has charmed the town's residents, including Loretta Young, whom he marries. ""The Stranger"" illustrates Welles' concerns that World War II did not spell the end of fascism, and is significant for being the first Hollywood film to include actual footage from Nazi concentration camps. But by Welles' own admission, ""The Stranger"" was more of an attempt at profitable Hollywood product than an artistic statement. The trademark Welles style does surface in the South American prologue and the drugstore scenes, and the film achieves genuine suspense during the paper chase scene and the grand finale atop the town's clock tower.

""The Stranger"" did not re-establish Welles as a force in Hollywood; he directed two more American films (""The Lady From Shanghai"" and ""Macbeth"") before departing for Europe, where his genius was better appreciated. But ""The Stranger"" remains a well-paced thriller, more enjoyable when considered apart from Welles' more distinctive work.",1119657600,8,1653,5.470588235294118
541919,5,6303039405,"""The Stranger"" is a gripping and tense 1946 thriller directed by the creative mind of Orson Welles who also starred in it.  Welles creates a deep feeling of paranoia in his characters throughout this story surrounding the hunting a fugitive Nazi war criminal.

Edward G. Robinson is outstanding as Mr. Wilson, an investigator for the Allied war crimes commission.  Robinson has purposely released a Konrad Meinike, a former Nazi concentration camp commandant, in the hopes that he will seek out his superior, the notorious Franz Kindler.  Kindler was a prime architect of the Holocaust and had escaped apprehension.

Robinson trailed Meinike, played by thickly accented Konstantin Shayne to Harper, Connecticut, where he makes contact with a professor Charles Rankin.  Rankin, played by Welles, we soon find out is really Kindler,  He is posing as a professor in a boys prep school above suspicion.  Coincidently, he is to be married that very day to Mary Longstreet, daughter of Supreme Court justice Judge Adam Longstreet, and played by Loretta Young. Fearing exposure Welles kills Meinike hiding his body in a shallow grave in the surrounding woods.

Robinson sets himself up in town posing as an antique dealer and eventually befriending the Longstreet family.  Robinson reveals his suspicions about Welles to Noah Longstreet, Mary's brother played by a youthful Richard Long.  It seems that both Kindler and Rankin both have an obsession for fixing and working on clocks.  Rankin has been trying to restore an antique bell tower clock in the town.

Robinson, aided by the Longstreet family reveal to Young their beliefs about Welles' true identity.  Young, deeply in love with Welles and in a terrific performance, struggles with incredulity and indecisiveness as to what to do. Welles plots to kill her in a clock tower scene reminiscent of Hitchcock's superb ""Vertigo"".  Welles, the epitome of evil meets an appropriate fate as he is undone by the instruments of his passion, Young and the belltower clock.

Welles and Hitchcock are so obviously influenced by each other as evidenced by their directorial styles, both able to create unease and tension in their plots.  They both use camera angles and techniques which are repeated throughout the movie to create dramatic effects.  A perfect example involves the pipe smoked by Robinson in the film.  In the beginning of the movie he accidently breaks it in a passionate speech to his colleagues.  At different points of the film, we see only the pipe, it's stem taped together, to indicate the presence of the relentless Robinson.",1119139200,,2587,5.128878281622912

What is most interesting is the crossover between Welles and Hitchcock as much of both story and style are borrowed from ""Sabotage"". Hitchcock would later borrow original elements from ""The Stranger"" for use in ""Vertigo"" - so apparently the two directors came out even.

The nontechnical highlights of this film are the performances of Edward G. Robinson and Loretta Young. Young is especially amazing, she plays Sylvia Sidney's role from ""Sabotage"" and is literally and figuratively the star-with more lines and screen time than Welles. Also entertaining is drug store owner ""Mr. Potter"" played by Billy House; who is always ready for a game of checkers which he plays wearing an eye shade while shamelessly cheating.

541982,4,6303039405,"""The Stranger"" is set in an eponymous ""small New England town"" during the immediate aftermath of World War 2. It is framed around a Nazi who is allowed to escape in the hope of his leading War Crimes investigators to a bigger fish. An appropriately repulsive Orson Welles plays the quarry. He is leading an outwardly respectable life as a professor. Welles even marries Loretta Young-1940s Hollywood most basic ""nice American girl"". This is the background as the WC detective, Edward G. Robinson, arrives in town- on the same bus as the escapee. How convenient! In fact, ""convenience"" is the key word in TS. Although there are a few twists and turns in the story, Robinson had too easy a time of things to suit this reviewer. I refuse to believe that real life War Crime sleuths solved their cases so smoothly or that private citizens were routinely so ""helpful"". However, if viewers can live with that criticism, then they should enjoy TS: The setting, supporting cast and murky filming are well done. And the acting by the leads is superior. Welles may make the skin crawl but his dual performance -he also directed- is first rate. And a callow Young is excellent as she slowly recognizes the reality of just what she has married-not to mention the ""little surprise"" he had for her. This reviewer has never witnessed Mr. Robinson turn in anything less than a fine performance, from tough guy to kindly uncle. TS follows this form. If one concentrates on these positives, TS is more than worthwhile. Those seeking suspense may be disappointed. TS is listed in Silver and Ward's ""Encyclopedia of Film Noir"" but fans of that genre should also feel let down. It does not truly fit the mold.

  The ""obscenity"" is former Nazi Franz Kindler (Orson Welles), a death camp mastermind who disappeared shortly after the war.  Wilson wins his argument and Konrad Meinike, one of Kindler's Nazi subalterns, is allowed to escape, hoping that he'll lead Wilson to Kindler.
 Like the best film noirs, this is a handsome movie of shadows and sunlight.  Meinike does make a shadowy escape, and Wilson follows him to the bucolic town of Harper, Connecticut.  The stakes are implied but clear - Kindler and his ilk are malignant cancers, and Harper is pure and uncorrupt.  Evil can't be allowed to sink its rotted tendrils into Harper.  Harper with its ivied walls and paper chases, with the boys whistling at pretty blondes and new brides hanging new curtains.
 Meinike does find Kindler, now Dr. Charles Rankin, early on in the movie.  Evil needs shadows and dark places to grow.  ""We must stay hidden `til the day we strike again."" Kindler/Rankin is hunted, he knows it, and Meinike is an unwelcome intrusion.  The last thing he needs is an old army buddy with the thick German accent hanging around.
 Kindler makes and shallow plants the first corpse of the film, and so we're off.
  THE STRANGER is a slick little suspense movie that really shouldn't be subjected to intense scrutiny.  For instance, it's probably better we believe that Kindler was able to ""disappear"" into Smalltown, USA so smoothly.  It's best we ignore the nagging question of how Rankin was able to woo and win the heart and hand of the beautiful daughter of a liberal Supreme Court Justice so quickly. And, later on in the movie, it's better not to snort at Wilson's rationalization for putting Mary Longstreet Rankin's (Loretta Young) life in danger.  And it's definitely better not to wonder how a woman who is astute enough to question someone's advocacy of a ""Carthaginian peace"" can be so blind to her husband's dark secrets.
 Young is wonderful as a young woman who has to journey from nave young bride to a confused woman torn between love and terror.  Robinson is just right as the driven Nazi hunter.  Welles, in the lead role, is another story.  He's too much the ham for a role like this.  He's a little too over the top.  Rankin/Kindler is a man who is living a great lie, and the penalty is great if he's found out.  The role calls for someone who can internalize dread and terror, and Welles was never a great internalizer.  Gregory Peck probably would have been perfect in the role - Peck was always better at repressing, rather than expressing, emotions.
  Quibbles aside, I strongly recommend THE STRANGER.  There's enough going on here to forgive its minor excesses and inconsistencies.  Besides, it LOOKS so darn good.  Welles' movies always have something visually interesting going on.
 This IS a budget dvd, so the print and sound quality are less than pristine.  I've seen worse, and frankly I didn't notice the scratches and splotches and such until I started looking for them.",1082332800,11,3156,4.817504655493482

It is also a fairly straight-ahead thriller that just barely has the Welles touch.  In fact, compared to Welles other work, it seemswell, ordinary.
Welles plays a Nazi war criminal who has found refuge as a professor in a sleepy college town.  This is the type of town where nothing much ever happens and the owner of the towns general store knows everyone and everything about them.  When Edward G. Robinson comes to town looking for antiques, suspicions are aroused, especially Welles.
The best parts of The Stranger are the cat-and-mouse game between Welles and Robinson as well as the relationship between Welles and his new wife Loretta Young.  The film still holds up as a good thriller, but not a great one.  The second half of the film feels too manipulated.  You might say, But Welles was a MASTER of manipulation, and youd be right.  But the difference here is in the manipulation of supporting characters who aren't given sufficient room to develop or to think.
The commentary track by Jeffrey Lyons is, unfortunately, unremarkable.  Lyons spends much of his commentary giving us a resume of each film the actors made, rather than discussing the merits and qualities of the film.

For the low price, the value is excellent and the video quality is quite good, though I'm sure it isn't as clear as the more expensive version.  The customer will have to decide if they want to pay three times the price to get a cleaner version or get a serviceable copy for the lower cost.
Now moving on to the film.  This movie is much more straightforward than the other Orson Welles films that I've seen.  We have a standard good guy and a standard bad guy, and each character is set up in his role almost immediately.  Edward G. Robinson plays the Nazi-hunter who has been tracking Orson Welles' character since the end of the Second World War.  Welles' plays a Nazi who has gone into hiding and is now living in small town America as a schoolteacher.  The acting from the two leads is spellbinding -- as good as any of their best work, with Welles in particular stealing the show.  Welles triumphs in the difficult task of playing a man who has successfully integrated himself in a community, yet allowing the audience to see him as the villain that he is.  The viewer never questions why the outlaw has been able to fool his friends and neighbors for months but can also pick up on the same clues that Robinson's character does.
The story is not overly complicated and this allows us to pay a lot of attention to the different characters in the movie.  The townspeople, without exception, are all given their own motivations without slipping into repetition and the silly catchphrases that movies set in small towns tend to give to their characters.  There are also some excellent shots that could only have come from Welles' keen directorial eye.  The German's obsession with clocks is an interesting metaphor for the Nazi mindset, but this is kept to a minimum and never becomes overbearing.
I highly recommend this interesting film for anyone who enjoys good acting and intriguing storylines.  The documentary included on the DVD is very superficial and most of the 30 minutes are taken up by trailers of films, some of which barely feature Orson Welles himself.  It's not something that the Welles fan is going to get too much out of and it does not contain enough information for the casual viewer.  The introduction by Tony Curtis is frighteningly odd.",993081600,59,2772,4.6921487603305785

7835462,4,6303039405,"4 1/2 - I wish Amazon allowed for half stars. I'm probably a little bit biased because I adore Orson Welles, and I think every shot of his is brilliant. This is not my favorite, it definitely is a little bit too Hollywood, but a well done movie with a great cast. I guess there are a few different versions of it floating around with a little better quality but I think the ""scratched print"" adds to the movie. What can I say,  I guess I'm not all about High Def and great sound quality.",1512864000,,487,4.126315789473685

7835464,5,6303039405,"I watched this movie tonight after we had watched Suspicion with Ingrid Bergman and Spellbound.  The Stranger won hands down.  This movie is very tightly woven, moves fast, has excellent acting. They say Orson Welles work here was not his best---but it was riveting and surpassed the two movies we had just watched.  I love Bergman and Peck and Cary Grant but the movie lacked interest.  Once The STranger came on (via YouTube) we all watched and witnessed the brilliant acting of Orson Welles, his direction, camera.  Loretta Young is fantastic in her role in The Stranger.  I highly recommend this movie.",1507334400,,606,4.892156862745098
7835465,5,6303039405,"Top notch spy movie with Edward G. Robinson being the good guy which is unusual for him. Orson Wells is the Nazi spy who, after the war, comes to a sleepy town in the USA to hide, and marries Loretta Young for his wife. Wells has a unique talent for fixing clocks and that is the major hint that leads Edward G. Robinson to suspect that he is the escaped Nazi.

Great suspense and a roaring climax as Wells is found out and cornered on the top of the huge town clock.

Loretta Young is almost driven crazy as she finds out more and more that her new husband is a Nazi.

This movie is a must for those who collect classics

7835466,5,6303039405,"The old MGM DVD has always been the best print available of this great film. Now, Olive Films has rescanned that same print in hi-def and the result is great! It even retains the MGM video logo at the beginning, so you know this is the print you're watching. The picture is crystal clear, with nice, rich black levels befitting this noir classic. There is some speckling and a few scratches, but these were always there. It's terrific that video noise reduction wasn't used to smooth over the film texture. This Blu-ray is the only way to enjoy this overlooked Welles masterpiece.",1504656000,10,580,4.696078431372549
7835467,5,6303039405,"A classic, still worth watching to see three of the top stars of the era  do their stuff,  with one of them (Orson Welles) directing  as well. Edward G. Robinson is superb on one of the occasions when his Little Caesar persona is not forcing him to limit the range of his  performance. Loretta Young holds her own, as well, as the innocent wife of  one of the truly evil men of the Century. In 1946, memories of the Death Camps in which the Nazi's had murdered millions with an efficiency unmatched in History, were still alive in the public imagination. In the film, Robinson is the pursuer, Welles is the escaped Nazi and Young, the daughter of a Supreme Court Justice, newly married to an him  in his reincarnation as an Instructor at the local elite Boys School. ( I am not revealing anything not known in the first minutes of the film.)
Robinson enters the small town being led by a Nazi allowed to escape from incarceration in the hope he will lead them to the much Bigger Nazi fish. Being nearly killed by the escapee who knew he was being followed, he did not see his meeting with The Evil One.......and from there we follow him as he investigates, Welles as he strives to  mask his identity and Young's character as she unknowingly plays a role in the deadly game.
More than that  would reveal too much. One of the strengths of the film is the lack of blatancy with which Welles, as director, maintains among the players and in the action ( a constraint he didn't always exercise)....and how each of the three very strong movie personalities avoids overacting  or artificially intensifying the emotion associated with their role. Perhaps this, too, is partially a product of Welles direction and a feeling among the stars that they need not strain to hold up a sagging film............something all three have had to do in some of the vehicles chosen for them.
At any rate, speaking as one who saw the film when it first came out and has seen it repeatedly since, while not a blockbuster, this one is a prime example of how to succeed by avoiding blatancy. I commend it to all who can appreciate films of a different era than our own.",1498176000,3,2143,4.516795865633075

7835470,5,6303039405,"There is a great cast in this 1946 black and white thriller. It is filled with great acting and no-let-up suspense. Edward G. Robinson plays a FBI agent who is determined to find a heinous Nazi criminal who came to the US to hide. A slim Orson Wells is the Nazi who marries the daughter of a Supreme Court Justice, Loretta Young, in the hope that this will help hide him. Orson Wells does a terrific job as the director of this film noir.
It is just after WWII and the Allies are seeking people who committed war crimes. (A scene from a concentration camp is shown.) The film is somewhat granny, but after a few minutes one becomes engrossed in the plot and ignores it.
On Wells very wedding day, a German man whom Robinson is following in the hope that he will lead him to the obscenity he is seeking, comes and speaks to Wells. Robinson does not see this. Well kills him, buries him in a near-by forest, and then kills his wifes dog when the dog tries to dig up the body.
Wells wife is very much in love with him. Robinson tries to get her to reveal what she knows about her husband. Wells tries to kill her.
Many other events occur that add to the suspense.",1496707200,2,1160,4.22972972972973
