8028667,5,B0002KPHU6,"A well made mystery featuring many of the best know actors from this era (1950/60s) of Japanese film making. The package describes it as being Hitchcockian and never has this been more true. The film is a tight and concise exploration of past guilt and the self destructive efforts that often go into the attempt to.move away from it. The DVD (From HVE) has good picture and sound quality, though it is light on extras. If it can be found for a good price, it should be purchased. I hope a better, loaded blu-ray is in the offing.",1521331200,,530,4.418367346938775
8028668,4,B0002KPHU6,"This is a way over par suspense film!  Acting is riveting and due entirely to the remarkable performances delivered by the three stunning female lead actresses.  The supporting cast (which is huge if you count all the cameos) is also quite good.  Film direction is superb and strictly about generating edge-of-your-seat excitement.  All stops seem to have been pulled out by the director to ensure the viewer never becomes complacent or comfortable.  The pace of roughly the first half of the film is especially dynamic:  when characters indicate their intention is to go somewhere, the film immediately cuts to that scene.  Much of the second half includes various flavors of flashbacks mostly from the perspective of the lead actresses.  Most occur on the edge of a cliff with the ever present threat of yet another over-the-cliff murder!  The male protagonist is shown/confirmed to have lead two lives (perhaps with the help of his family members).  What has been written off (by the police) as a suicide was really a murder; what was heretofore been considered a murder was a suicide; what was considered to be a suicide or murder may have been just an accident.  Original source material exhibits a few artifacts of wear.  Black and white cinematography (wide screen) is a bit on the dark side.  Score is fine.  Subtitles are just right (with a minimum of translational embellishment).  Highly recommended!  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",1416614400,,1435,5.042553191489362
8028669,5,B0002KPHU6,"This is not a ""dim copy"" of anything. The movie might be in black and white, but its psychological analysis is expertly done with many shades of grey. One of the best winter movies ever. The snow sits on top of the buildings in this movie almost as heavy as the moral burdens oppressing its characters. Much more memorable - in terms of shots - than any Hitchcock movie. Don't miss it.",1324598400,6,385,4.361111111111111
8028670,5,B0002KPHU6,"Matsumoto Seicho is not simple detective story author. He is archaeologist, art history expert, anthropologist, above all his story has always allegoric meaning. In this story Zero Focus, main event happen between Tokyo and Hokuriku district especially at Noto peninsula. Toyama bay of Noto Peninsula is very well known as Mirage. The title of this story, one of the word ""Focus"" represents ""Light"", because Light is always connected such as camera equipment. Eventually ""Zero Focus""'s allegoric meaning is obviously ""missing person"". Based on this idea of Seicho, I myself wrote a book ""The Light Theater opened to Universe"" . The relation between painter Vermeer and Noto Peninsula. As you know, Vermeer is called as ""Light Magician"". My book is as below, a lot of picture and figure included. But it is Japanese book. However I can help you to send you english summary and advice of e-mail from me.  [...]

8028671,2,B0002KPHU6,"They got the look right. In fact, it's a explicit lift of the the film noir of the 40's and 50's. But there's no mystery here, just a string of events to lull the viewer to sleep, capped by a jumbled explanation of mundane events.

Not unlike Nomura's THE CASTLE OF SAND. Take two to sleep.",1208217600,,290,4.178571428571429
8028672,4,B0002KPHU6,"This is a pretty good movie--filmed in a style similar to ""Under the Flag of the Rising Sun""
Newlyweds- Teiko and Kenichi--are married for a week when Kenichi disappears without a trace-and we are shown Teiko's attempts to discover what happened and how.
She finds that her husband was an ex-policeman involved with prostitutes-is there a connection to this and his disappearance?
Soon her brother-in-law is poisoned--and another young woman commits suicide--apparently, after the suicide of her common law husband.  Through a maze of false leads and disinformation-Teiko finally discovers what happened to her husband and how!
A very good mystery--my only complaint being that some of the transitions between scenes are a little too abrupt. All in all---a very good movie--well worth watching!  Yoshiko Kuga does an excellent job as the abandoned wife!
Black & White--with sub-titles!",1121040000,13,885,5.405797101449275
8028673,5,B0002KPHU6,"Nicely acted, beautifully shot, intense drama.  Brilliantly brings to life Seicho Matsumoto's story in true Hitchcockian style.  Never a false step.",1105920000,8,148,6.0
