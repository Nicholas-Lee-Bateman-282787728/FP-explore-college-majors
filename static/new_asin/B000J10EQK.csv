2664652,1,B000J10EQK,"Zombie Nation is complete trash.  The cover art for the movie is totally false advertisement.  The movie had so much potential yet it failed miserably in every aspect possibly imaginable.  The storyline, the acting, the make up, everything could have been done better by elementary school kids.  I read the previous reviews, but thought people were just being harsh, I have mistaken! People were actually being nice when they say this movie is a waste of time.  I'm so pissed I rented this; I want every second of my life back that I wasted watching this movie.  While watching it, I kept saying to myself, ""It'll get better.""  I said it all the way to the credits.  If I could give this movie negative stars I would.

2664654,1,B000J10EQK,"I completely agree with the previous reviewer.  This movie is just about as bad as it gets.  A boring, senseless script with bumbling ""actors"", silly dialogue, and production values that would embarrass a high-school film project are all combined in this typical Ulli Lommel project.  Lommel really should look for work in another field, as he clearly has no idea how to produce a film worth watching.  Ed Wood's worst film is a masterwork compared to this steaming heap of trash.

2664655,1,B000J10EQK,"I've ben watching horror movies for over 30 years. I've seen lots of ""b"" movies and indie movies that were shot on video. Some of these movies have been very good, others not so. I have to say that in all those years this might be the worst movie of them all, it's so bad I don't know where to start. How about the cover art, pretty creepy right? Looks scary? Guess what, there is nothing in the movie that even remotely resembles the front and back cover art. The story could have made a good movie in the right hands, but obviously, this was not the case. The ""acting"" sucks, the ""directing"" sucks, and the make up is a joke, and a bad joke at that. If you think ""zombies"" with racoon style make-up is scary, than you might actually like this movie. Whoever produced this mess should be ashamed of themselves. Stay far, far away from this movie, if you buy it you'll regret it, don't say I didn't warn you. I can't wait untill people associated with this movie start giveing this slop five star reviews, that will be the highest of unintentional comedy.",1166486400,13,1055,4.3604060913705585

2664667,1,B000J10EQK,"Zombie Nation (2005)

 Good set up for this one, a dangerously deranged cop arrests women, examines them to see if they meet the high hygiene standards of his psycho mother and them kills them by lethal injection when they fail the test.  They always fail the test.  A very pretty young immigrant lady seeks to protect herself from the serial killer by having a gang of Voodoo priestess cast spells over her. When she gets murdered, she, and the four other victims, come back to revenge gobble the killer.
 Sounds good, yes?  The five victims are all attractive young women in L.A. and the victim with the Voodoo charms has other very nice charms when the perp disrobes her and we get a nice long peek.  Also good, yes?
 Well, we would be wrong to think that this one has any redeeming value.
 Director Ulli Rommel, born in what is now Poland in 1944, has directed some 54 films.  Most of them are direct to video movies with such inspiring titles as Diary of a Cannibal, Bloodsuckers and Dungeon Girl.  You get the idea.  Cheap films with blood and nudity, slapped together with as little outlay as possible and sent out into the bottom rung of the marketplace.
 The pity of it all is that I think the actors could have done a lot better, but Rommel didn't ask them to do any better.  He didn't set out to make a good Zombie movie, he set out to make a piece of junk with the name Zombie on it to fool the gullible public into spending their hard earned cash to his benefit.  He could have directed with more integrity.  He could have written a script (he wrote the screenplay) that had some scintilla of authenticity to it.  I mean, the idea of Zombie revenge is a good notion.  But no, too much trouble, too little talent.  I feel sorry for the actors who were talked into appearing in the film, most of whom were show biz people, if not famous one, who deserved a better break.
 Rommel also produced this thing with a gang of other producers.  In an odd credit I want to mention, Rommel also has a credit for Production Design----but under the name Patricia Devereaux, hiding not only his identity but even his sex.  Double shameful.
 Terrible direction, terrible script, wooden acting and about the worst sets I have ever seen, this film has nothing to recommend it.
 This R rated one hour and 21 minute long film earns only a single brain.  It was made for a reported $1,500 dollars which I cannot understand.  No one apparently got a dime in pay, which explains a lot.

2664678,1,B000J10EQK,"I picked this movie up in a closing Hollywood Video store for five dollars. I am a rather huge fan of zombie movies and thought, ""Hey, $5? Why the heck not"". I get home a place it in my DVD player and then the crap started to begin.

The title screen was a joke. They where trying to be cool and edgy with trying to split the tile in to there letter sections in huge white letters and it just comes off as stupid and cheesy. Evidently they didn't pay any attention to any graphic design or art classes and this was my firt big clue that this was going to be a horrendous movie.

Majority of the movie is a cop who clearly must be crooked because he always has his eye brows furrowed and acts in a gruff manner, who takes women checks their teeth likes a horse bats them around occasionly, injects them with some clearly horrible liquad and then stares at them for a bit to see what happens. The poor woman who got injected dies, he then sticks them into a duffle bag, stuffs them in the truck of his squad car, drives off to some woods/field, buries them, repeat 3 more times. Then there is obvious good cop partner of obviously crooked cop who complains to either his wife or greasy hair rookie cop about how he doesn't trust crooked cop for a good portion of the movie. Good cop also get's a poorly coriagraphed fight and get's tossed into a nice stack of coviniently placed empy boxes.

Then there is a ""medical factory"" which just looks like a warehose that they placed crude bunk beds in and every time they show this ""medical factory"" they show some weird bald guy ""spanking"" some poor idiot, who is chained to his bed, over and over again. It's always the same person getting ""spanked"" too. The thing is the ""spanking"" is no more then the guy rocking back and forth with a thin ""metal"" rod laughing ""manically"". Who were there they trying to fool with that crap? There is also some female doctor in a wheel chair who I guess is the brains of the operation. When ever they show here she's always trying to hold back a smile and also her ""son"" is blatently smiling when ever they show him. The movie is so bad that even the actors can't take it seriously.

That's pretty much  as far as I got. After the third time I saw crooked cop go over the same stupid and pointless procedure I just fast foward through the movie trying to find the zombies that Zombie Nation's name implies. When I see a scene with a zombie I pause the screen and just stare at the abomination that they call a zomibe. The only thing that makes them a zomibe is racoon eyes. That's it. No decaying flesh, lost limbs, grunting, open wounds, a hunger for flesh, just racoon eyes.

At that point I took it out of my DVD player, broke the disc and threw it in the trash. I kid you not, that is what I did. The movie was that bad. For a movie entiled, ""Zombie Nation"" it had only 4 zombies in it. That's only one more zombie then Ed Wood's ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" and that was made in 1959. You would think there would be more then just those 4 zombie girls with a name like, ""Zombie Nation"" but occodring to this movie a nation of zombies is just 4 bad acting no name actresses with racoon eyes.",1279843200,,3170,4.231404958677686

2664681,1,B000J10EQK,"Zombie Nation (Ulli Lommel, 2004)

According to the voting at IMDB, Zombie Nation is the fourteenth worst movie of all time as I write this (3 November 2009). I disagree. It's barely the fourteenth worst movie I've seen this week, and two, Grizzly Park and Dark Remains, stand out as far more worthy of inclusion on IMDB's 100-worst list (for comparison's sake, Zombie Nation sits at 1.6, while Grizzly Park rates a 4.1 and Dark Remains a 5.2). Don't get me wrong, this movie is terrible in ways that make me want to curl up in a corner and suck my thumb, but believe me when I tell you that worse things exist in the dark corners of your video store.

The barely intelligible plot involves a corrupt cop, Joe Singer (Gunther Ziegler, a veteran of this sort of direct-to-video crap who showed up very briefly in Get Smart! last year), who really has a thing for killing women. His new partner, Vitalio (Brandon Dean), suspects something is up, but because he's a braindead moron, doesn't really get it. This interplay takes up the first hour of this eighty-minute movie, so I'd not tell you any more for fear of spoilers except that, well, the movie is called Zombie Nation. So you probably figured out that one of his victims is under the protection of voodoo priestesses, and so they all come back to get their revenge.

This is far more urban drama/really awful mystery than it is horror movie. The gore effects are cheap and minimal and all the supposed horror is packed into the final twenty minutes. (Those unwise enough to have seen more of Lommel's post-Fassbinder work will probably recognize the idiotic flashback technique enough to understand what's going on, but for those of you who haven't, just roll with it, it will all be made clear eventually, Kind of.) This can sometimes be effective if your movie is actually building tension with great characters or an amazing script (viz. Paranormal Activity), but everything about this movie is so far below average that gutter would be a step up. I do have to give Lommel points, however, for managing to keep an hour and ten minutes of footage in an hour and twenty minute film in the same location. (Almost the entire film was shot in one large warehouse. Which gets really, really funny in the police-precinct scenes.) This is a man who knows how to take no budget and turn it into serious no-budget crap. If you look at it as a stupid unintentional comedy that you can use as, say, a drinking game, then there is some value to be had here. But I could go on all day about how horrible this movie is and we'd still be here at closing time. So just take my word for it; you want to avoid this movie unless your only other choices are Sci-Fi Channel Originals. *",1259539200,3,2723,4.541751527494909

I threw it out, tossed it in the garbage.

I heard the movie was bad and purchased it because I enjoy the occasional bad movie (90% of SciFi, or, SyFy, orginals are enjoyably bad), this movie does not join that group.

The Zombie on the case's cover looks good, the zombie on the back looks incredible, the Zombie in the movie is, well, the way you know its a zombie, they put black paint across their eyes, like 2 real bad black eyes.

The acting was insipid, the casting was horrific, the special effects were awful, and the dialogue was indescribably bad. Some bad movies are so bad that they are fun to laugh at, this isn't one of them. This is so bad that you find yourself thinking about writing a ""bad"" review of the move while you are watching it. This is a movie where the zombies go directly, and without explanation, from being so ""zombie like"" that they eat the people who stop to offer them rides to crying about the fact that since they are zombies they can't go home again. Shortly after subjecting us to all of this ""zombie melodrama"" the zombies go back to eating people.

There are some movies that rise above low budgets. This isn't one of them. This is a movie where you find yourself looking at the police station and thinking, this looks like the inside of a warehouse. Then you watch a scene where the main character lives in a (familiar looking) warehouse, followed by a scene where you find out that the main character moonlights at a warehouse.

1) ACTING: The acting in this low-budget opus is really bad. And, not that I'm defending any of these ""actors,"" the script is just as bad, and doesn't help.

2) PRODUCTION: Was anybody in charge of production? The plot / script of this movie is out of control, going this way, then that way, with dangling plot threads never to be resolved. The lighting was bad, the camera work was bad, and the sound was horrible! Minimal blood and gore. The make up of the zombies consisted of raccoon eyes. That's it. Yup. Really. Raccoon eyes. The nest thing about this movie, (other than rejoicingly watching the end credits roll) is the cover art. Too bad that this zombie or even that this type of make up never appears in this movie.

3) ZOMBIES: The only familiarities between the zombies (all 5 of them...hardly a ""nation"" as the title suggests...) and current day zombies are that they are indeed, dead, and that they eat flesh. That's it. Really. They walk, talk, and carry on like everyday people. They even join the police force! They then are told that they don't have to eat human flesh, and they can eat...wait for it...are ya ready...cheeseburgers. Sigh...

4) THE CAUSE: Voodoo.

5) NUDITY: minimal boobage and a penis makes an appearance.

I know the director is not revered highly by many and has directed many a crapfest. I would've thought that Mr. Lommel would have a lot of experience to bring this low budget shlockfest to the silver screen, but I guess not.

A LAPD officer with a thick Baverian accent claiming to be from the south, a crazy shrink who thinks he's in the Marathon Man ""Is it safe?"" and Voodoo zombies?  If you're expecting a slick CGI film filled with a multi-million dollar budget, then look elsewhere.  But if you want to see something that's ""different"" and you want to be ""entertained"", then this movie's for you.",1186272000,3,701,4.4296875

I recognized that I was going to be watching a ""B"" movie film but this mess would have pushed past a Z if it were possible. Horrible writing, lighting, acting, camera work, editing & pacing teamed with a laughable set will have you wondering if this film was done by a bunch of drunk meth addicts. Moreover, speaking of the set, why did the police station just look like an old boiler room? In addition, why did they just slap a number precinct sign on the front of a truck dock and try to act as if it was supposed to be a police station. Everyone involved in this blunder/production should be in hiding from embarrassment. Please avoid this like syphilis!",1183248000,3,774,4.344827586206897

2664702,1,B000J10EQK,"Zombie Nation: A literal description of the movie:

A renegade cop is targeting young women under the auspice of routine traffic stops; the women are then abducted by the cop and taken to a furniture warehouse. Once the women are handcuffed in the warehouse loft, the renegade cop performs the following steps:

(A) He checks their teeth with a miniature flashlight.

(B) He injects their buttocks with an unknown but presumably lethal substance.

(C) He watches some television.

(D) He tosses the women into an extra-wide shopping cart and conveys them to a queen-sized bed.

(E) He jots down the names of the women in a small notebook.

(F) He crams the women into giant-sized duffle bags, and transports them to diverse places of interment.

Eventually, a group of Voodoo women are shown performing an arcane ceremony over the sprawled body of a blonde girl in fishnet stockings. Voodoo Ritual Ingredients: (1) snake, (1) tarantula, (1) bleeding pig's head, and (1) set of preserved shark's jaws.

The girl in the fishnets is shortly thereafter kidnapped by the renegade cop, subjected to the aforementioned steps (A) through (F), and then buried at sea. However, thanks to the Voodoo Ritual, the girl in the fishnets returns from the dead; unexplainably all of the other non-Voodoo-treated women are resurrected as well. The undead status of the she-zombies is solely indicated by the black spray paint around their eyes, which causes them to look more like raccoons than zombies. (The she-zombies are shown to be mildly decayed in their mirror images; according to the Voodoo women, the she-zombies' physical appearance is based on their own perception, and since they apparently perceive themselves as raccoons rather than she-zombies, their default appearance is non-decayed.) The she-zombies emasculate and de-tongue a couple of male victims before working their way to the renegade cop. Cut and print!

Congratulations! You have just survived a summary of the plot of this movie. You have approximately 17 seconds before you begin to vomit and your head explodes.",1182297600,49,2073,5.142857142857143
2664703,1,B000J10EQK,"THE COVER ART LIES!!!! I picked this up for the cover art. I love all that is Zombie and I will watch anything in the genre. I wish I did not have to give at least one star, I want to give negative stars on this one. This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have seen ""Zombiez"". Whenever I am in the movie rental store and I see this on the shelves, I get SO DAMN ANGRY!!! I feel like punching something right now!!!

 This is a movie about a bad cop who preys on ""young"" girls, then kills them I think?!?!! He drags them into an old warehouse or somthing and then you think he might rape them, but he injects them with something and then carries him out to his patrol car in a gym bag. I don't understand why he does this, but then again I never studied Freud. Oh by the way his ""good cop"" partner waits in the car while he goes into the warehouse with a girl then leaves with only the bag like 2 or 3 times before he ""starts to suspect something is wrong"".

 I am not even going to try to explain how they become ""Zombies"". The makeup job is literally only black makeup around the girls eyes like a racoon, no white face and still wearing blush. These girls supposedly were dead and buried underground only to dig their way out and still have a perfect 80's mall hairspray hairdo and clean clothes!!!!

 I have seen bad Zombie movies in the past and have found at least one scene or aspect of the movie to say ""hey that wasn't a complete waste."" Even if that was to say ""hey I just saw a really bad zombie movie."" But this, this just pisses me off!!! If I ever see the director on the street, I am punching him right in the face!!!!!",1178582400,3,1649,4.027522935779817

Horrible acting, NO ZOMBIES - unless you call chicks with bad eye liner zombies LOL!

Cardboard & plywood makeshift sets thown together in an empty warehouse (reverb echoes and all), props from a Good Will store...looks like it was made on a $20 budget. Luckily, I only RENTED it. Kiss that $4 bucks goodbye LOL!

2664707,1,B000J10EQK,"There are lots of zombie movies out there, some of which are poorly directed, some are poorly written, some are poorly acted. Not only is this movie all those, it isn't one movie at all. Two or three separate movies are hacked together with all the grace of a blind surgeon to create what is not only the worst Zombie movie I have ever seen, but one of the worst movies I've ever watched period.

In a normal review, this is when I list the positive and negatives of the movie, but I'm trying my hardest to erase from my mind that I spend an hour and a half of my life on this junk. Honestly, it's too bad to be even campy. The zombies are just chicks with bad eye make-up and how they're created makes no sense (unfortunately, I tried). The plot, if you can call it that, is so disjointed and so many plot threads are left dangling it defies the imagination how anyone would want their name associated with it.

Look, I love campy horror movies, but there is campy and then there is unfinished and poorly made. This is the later. Don't judge a movie by the cover (the cover IS cool) and run far away. Get something else! Anything else! But don't waste your time or money on this D rate film school project.",1169424000,24,1207,4.243478260869566

Half the cast members are definitely porn stars, the movie is shot and edited on a potato. no not an actual potato but still. you can see the camera in reflections of cars, the boom dips into frame multiple scenes. the music is horribly cheap and doesn't fit the movie at all. its honestly one of the best unintentional comedy films ever made.

It's hard to even know where to begin with all the issues this movie has. The abandoned warehouse that serves as the police station, with its weed-ridden exterior and cheap, random office cubicles inside? The killer cop who seems to come from a southern Evangelical background but has a German accent? The zombie makeup that consists solely of raccoon eyes, a la Darryl Hannah in Blade Runner? The total lack of zombies for at least an hour? That's just the tip of the iceberg.
