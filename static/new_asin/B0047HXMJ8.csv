4285216,2,B0047HXMJ8,"I recently purchased Make it or Break it Volume 2 and automatically assume it should provide closed caption or subtiles but to my surprise, this volume 2 dvd doesnt but the first volume does. So why stop there? And plus I know that on tv, it provided closed captions.  I am deaf myself and this bit of information would have been helpful.",1294876800,23,338,4.451612903225806
4285217,2,B0047HXMJ8,"This is a fantastic series, I was anxiously awating part 2 of season 1. But WHAT HAPPENED??? There are NO English subtitles for the hearing impaired. I'm not totally deaf, but most of the characters in this series talk very fast, and their enunciation is not that great. Part 1 included subs in French, Spanish, and English for hearing impaired. In part 2 they dropped this essential feature. WHY??? A subtitle track is a simple text file with timing script. Less than 1 MB of space. The show had closed captions available on the broadcast TV but NOT on the DVD collectors edition??? I am so sick of this!!! I will be re-selling this set, and waiting for a re-issue with proper features.

Please write to ABC Family Channel, Paul Lee, President, 3800 West Alameda Ave., Burbank, CA 91505 and let them know your concerns, Thank you!

(La Femme Nikita did the same thing. Seasons 1-4 all have English subs. But not on Season 5. Show a little concern for the hearing impaired.)",1294790400,17,974,4.624277456647399

4285224,2,B0047HXMJ8,Lots of language and bulimia is glossed over and glamourized in the first 10 minutes. Too bad because the gymnastics is great but this is definitely not a show for the under 16 crew.,1447804800,,182,4.382352941176471

4285238,1,B0047HXMJ8,"Gymnastics is one of my favorite sports. The dedication and team spirt of the athletes is inspiring. None of that came through in this show. Girls running around in skimpy shiny clothing, very little skill or talent shown.",1401667200,,222,4.868421052631579

4285254,1,B0047HXMJ8,"I am truly disgusted that I spent hours watching season 1 and getting involved in the story and characters only to discover Volume 2 and 3 are NOT captioned. Why would you caption the older episodes and not the newer ones? I did enjoy volume 1, however will not even bother with the next two volumes since it is too much of a struggle to understand it and enjoy. Also, those of you who want to watch this with your children....be careful because there are a lot of adult topics. (losing virginity, eating disorders, adultery) Be prepared to do some explaining if your kids are not teenagers yet...which a lot of kids interested in gymnastics are 10 and under.",1367366400,4,659,4.546218487394958

4285274,5,B0047HXMJ8,This was a very entertaining series that recreates the trials and tribulations that female gymnasts go through to be the best. Funny and dramatic at times with well casted ladies to portray olympic minded gymnasts. Too bad this series was not extended beyond this olympic year of 2012. Buy this dvd if you love gymnastics like me and millions of others.,1354406400,2,353,4.80327868852459

4285281,1,B0047HXMJ8,"I was just about to purchase this dvd and I noticed the poor review average so I read the reviews and found out there were no English subtitles so I did not buy. They are not mandatory for me but very helpful and seeing as this show is not a ""positively must watch"" I decided to pass. Volume one (which had subtitles) was by ABC studios-this one is buy Gaiam (which I never heard of). Cheapening the product is absolutely no way to attract customers. Shame to all involved in this decision.",1296086400,6,490,4.336956521739131

8418166,5,B0047HXMJ8,"Absolutely brilliant series.  The ladies acting as gymnasts are unbelievable with their prowess and understanding of the sport.  The actor playing Sasha is also brilliant.  I loved Cameron and Peri's acting as well.  This story is so engaging that it is hard to stop watching.  Again, kudos to the 4 girls.  The acting and stunts were awesome and I am losing sleep binge watching this series.  Chloe, Emily's Mom is also a terrific actress and to make it even better, the cast members are beautiful.  I'd love to see this series continue and go into the 4 girls lives as they grow into adults after the Olympics are finished, etc...keep us guessing, let us see them marry and  have kids and in my dreams become great coaches with Sasha and his Dad's help!  This is a winner...why didn't I hear about this sooner????",1471392000,,815,4.636363636363637
