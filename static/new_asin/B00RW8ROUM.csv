6936266,4,B00RW8ROUM,"Season 18 isn't back to the former glory years of, say seasons 4-12.  But, it's a huge turn around from the mess that was season 17.",1448668800,,132,4.076923076923077
6936267,5,B00RW8ROUM,"South Park is the gold standard of cartooning. This season is above average. Hear that, Lordes?",1448236800,,95,5.0

6936271,5,B00RW8ROUM,"While many shows are content producing ""more of the same"", Parker and Stone have continued to evolve and change the way so many people in the quiet little mountain town of South Park can't seem to. This season, however, the change is even more drastic, since it is the first season to have such distinct continuity between episodes (with many jokes and plot-points crossing over throughout the season the way sketches did on Mr. Show).

Admittedly, I am a massive fan of the show and have loved every season, so this may not come as a surprise, but season 18 is phenomenal. The only problem (if you can even call it that) more recent episodes have had for me are that they are so smart that I sometimes forget that it's funny and do not laugh the first time through. Only with a repeat viewing do all of the jokes actually scan. My routine has become: Watch it at air, taking in some of the best satire out there. 2) Think about it for a little bit 3) watch it the next day and laugh throughout. 4) buy the season and marathon those sweet, sweet Trey and Matt commentary Minis.

The discs are 100% worth it for the 40 or so minutes total of commentary if you are a huge fan of the show. If not, I suggest streaming it and skipping the discs, even though they're reasonably priced and look and sound great.",1446336000,3,1305,4.344262295081967

6936275,4,B00RW8ROUM,"SP has been sliding in quality of writing for a few seasons, but it's still pretty good. Tough to do in 18+ seasons. Plus, I'm cursed with an urge to have complete collections so I felt compelled to acquire this season. Probably won't get the amount of re-watches the older seasons get, but it is what it is.",1468972800,,308,4.327586206896552
6936276,5,B00RW8ROUM,"The Drone, Magic the gathering, and Washington Redskins episodes alone are worth owning season 18 of South Park",1466035200,,111,5.222222222222222

6936280,1,B00RW8ROUM,"This show is no longer funny.  Swelled heads  + swelled bank accounts do not equal quality.  Years ago these two guys blasted the hell out of George Lucas for being a sellout when he foisted THE PHANTOM MENACE upon the hordes of SW fans.  Now these two broadway titans do the same, since they don't have the integrity to turn down millions from Comedy Central.  the shows are not funny.  They're not even mildly clever.  They betoken hack-work totally bereft of ideas.  I've watched the show since 1998, and I sure miss the quality of: ""Spookyfish,"" ""Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut,"" and (most of all) ""Scott Tenorman Must Die.""",1462665600,,627,4.636363636363637
