3038375,5,B000Z6GT4K,"This is yet another season of Chuck Norris' great show.  Decently priced and well packaged, this is too good to pass up.",1205712000,,120,4.454545454545454
3038376,5,B000Z6GT4K,"If you watch Walker, Texas Ranger for unadulterated laughs, this is your season. Trust me I've seen them all, and no season presents more ridiculously hilarious episodes than this one.

This is it, finally season four has arrived. A true joy for those who appreciate Walker, Texas Ranger for its ridiculous nature. Season four gives us the gems ""Swan Song"", ""Higher Power"", ""Heart of the Dragon"", ""Ghost Rider"", ""Codename: Dragonfly"", and ""Cyclone"". A long list for episodes labeled ""gems"", I know, however they all truly deserve the distinction. ""Swan Song"" sees Walker struggle for survival in the mountains of Utah, as he fights an overprotective mother bear and wrestles a flesh-eating cyclops (Not kidding). ""Cyclone"" may, however, be the most far-fetched episode of Walker, Texas Ranger ever produced (despite Swan Song's more than valiant effort). To be brief, Walker fights a tornado. Wow. ""Ghost Rider"" reminds us that Walker was raised on a Cherokee Reservation and ""Higher Power"" provides a hilarious Norris slant on eastern philosophy.

The remaining episodes are, for the most part, your typical Walker. But no other season is packed as full of top notch Walker.",1203638400,,1175,5.211640211640212
3038377,5,B000Z6GT4K,"I can't wait for the Fourth Season! I had a great time watching the first three and the last seasons.

Funny to say that the fourth season will be no different than any of the other seaons. One of the following three things will happen in each episode - but with different locales and settings:

1) Alex gets kidnapped by some crazed con or ex-cop.
2) Walker goes on vacation or undercover and reveals a major gang operation by accident or luck.
3) For little or no apparent reason, a specific criminal targets the texas ranger, and everyone on his ""hit list"" is dead except for Walker and Walker bust the criminal by doing a spectacular martial art sideshow instead of using a gun.

I find Walker to be a hilarious show. When I was young, I found it to be semi-serious, but now as an adult, I can't help but laugh at some things. On one episode Walker played a con sent to a prison undercover of some hitman and the mob leader said, ""Some people eat airplane food and asks for seconds. You don't look like that kind of a man and that's why I trust you."" I was drinking some soda at that moment, and I almost sprayed it all over my laptop.

It's even more funny that every single bad guy in Texas knows expert martial arts. When given a choice between a gun or fighting hand-to-hand combat, every criminal chooses hand to hand, regardless of the fact if the criminal is armed to the teeth with automatic rifles and submachine guns.

Oh yeah, one episode a woman's father just gotten blown up by a grenade and probably burnt to pieces. Trivette came in trying to pick her up and they both started flirting right there next to her dad's burning car. And then she stomped off and Trivette was like, ""Gosh, women!"" Funny as anything.

One thing you can always count on, every episode ends with a slow motion round house kick to the face, and then CD, Walker, Trivette, Alex, and the new new members (in later seasons) kick it off with some joke where everyone laughs and then credit rolls.",1203033600,3,1985,4.395095367847412
3038378,5,B000Z6GT4K,"One of the highlights of my DVD collection is the Walker, Texas Ranger series. As a fan of old TV western films that starring Gene Autry, John, Wayne, Clayton Moore, Gary Cooper, and Jimmy Stewart, ""Walker"" hit the genre dead on without being western.

The fourth season of Walker continues the grand tradition of adventure, and moralistic adventures. Ranger Cordel Walker, Jimmy Trivette, and Assistant DA Alex Cahill tackle crime in the Dallas area. With Walker and his half Cherokee background, you just never know what kind of case (or evidence) comes up. ""Ghost Rider"" includes a mystic vision that leads Walker to the murderer in an 8 year old cold case. Eastern mysticism comes to the forefront in ""Higher Power"" as Walker protects a chosen one until his return to the monastery. Alex Cahill faces her father in court in ""Redemption"", and discovers how thick blood really is. Cordel Walker plays ""Christmas Carol"" to a group of orphans in a touching episode ""A Ranger's Christmas"". A hit man comes to town in ""The Deadliest Man Alive"" and Interpol collaborates with Walker to take him out. The supernatural re-enters Dallas in ""Heart of the Dragon"" as Walker restores a jade idol to it's proper owner.

My favorite (hard to pick) episode this season is probably the two part ""Sons of Thunder"" that introduces Trent Molloy to the outstanding cast of characters. Episodes like this are the reason why the show lasted 8 seasons, and could probably have lasted beyond Bonanzas' 12 years on the air.

The outstanding artwork that graces the inside of the disc cases of Walker beside his horse just cement the relationship between Walker and classic westerns.

You can't lose with Walker.

3038390,5,B000Z6GT4K,"As a law enforcement officer myself there are two shows I always watched, Walker, Texas Ranger and Columbo. Yes, they are as different as night and day, but both shows has that very special something that make them stand out above all the rest. Cuck Norris had no problem adding faith, love of country and stories that make a difference in the lives of those who watch them. Season four is no different. Season four is full of that Walker magic hand to hand combat, car chases and the best in martial arts. As always Walker takes command with his hard hits and kicks more often than the use of his gun. It is all high octane adventure and never fear his side kick Trivette is right there at his side. Of course you have Cahill, assistant district attorney and mostly silent, but best friend C. D. Parker retired Ranger. It is 27 episodes of heart pumping action.",1468022400,,862,4.462025316455696

3038419,5,B000Z6GT4K,"I can't believe I already finished the fourth season. These episodes are so easy to watch. They don't get boring. Sometimes the fighting is a little repetitive, but even with that new approaches are brought in.

I really enjoy the closeness of the team. CD and Trivette's antics are really funny. The quiet romance between Walker and Alex. I really liked the reappearance of Terry Kiser
He makes such wonderful comic relief. This is definitely needed after some of the powerful and poignant episodes.

Weekdays I watch a disc every evening after work. Of course I take breaks to take my pups out and throw toys to fetch. It's so hard to go to bed without loading the next disc and watching just one more.

These episodes are like Cracker Jacks or Lay's potato chips. You can't have just one. They make these cold winter nights barely noticeable. January never went so quickly. Weekends I reserve for reading and the many other things I can't do with Walker taking up my time so enjoyably.",1421884800,,988,4.666666666666667

3038468,5,B000Z6GT4K,"Walker Texas Ranger just keeps better every episode. Chuck Norris pours a lot of his personal true life actions in this movie and that's what makes it great. Chuck Norris is truly a world champion, and he brings that spirit alive when he reaches out to help those in need. From children in need to the homeless, chuck proves again and again the greast weapon in anyone's arsenal is the indomidable will of the human spirit at its finest. If you read Chuck Norris's bio ""Inner Strength"" or ""Against All Odds,"" you'll see  the similariites between his true life actions and the stories portrayed in Walker Texas Ranger. His character Walker does quite a bit of charity work helping out kids in need, the homeless, and teaching the weak how to stand up and fight back. This is simply television at its finest. Larger than life character (Walker) fighting bad guys who desperately need their butts kicked, and helping those in need along the way with a heart that's bigger than Jupiter. What's not to love?!?",1320451200,,1004,4.704545454545454
3038469,5,B000Z6GT4K,I have always been a fan of the show Walker Texas Ranger! In fact when they first started showing Walker on CBS that is when I started being a fan of Chuck Norris. When I first started buying Walker Texas Ranger I was really looking forward to owning all of the seasons on dvd! I do not regret purchasing any of them on dvd. If I had to I would buy them all over again that is how good the show is (at least it is to me). I definitely recommend the fourth season for any Walker fan. This one had a lot of action and just has great episodes of Walker Texas Ranger! Chuck Norris did an excellent job in his portrayal of his character Cordell Walker. They could not have picked a better actor for Walker. This show has an excellent cast in it. I liked all of the characters in it and the actors in it. The production did an excellent job picking out the actors and actresses in the show! I have to admit I could not remember what episodes belonged to what season til I purchased them on dvd. I remembered some but not all I am glad that I have them on dvd because the picture quality is a whole lot better than the vhs tapes that I used to record the episodes on so I could watch them again. It is a must buy for any Walker fans and anyone looking for a great modern day western television series!!!,1315353600,,1296,4.06640625

3272873,5,B000Z6GT4K,"If you watch Walker, Texas Ranger for unadulterated laughs, this is your season. Trust me I've seen them all, and no season presents more ridiculously hilarious episodes than this one.

This is it, finally season four has arrived. A true joy for those who appreciate Walker, Texas Ranger for its ridiculous nature. Season four gives us the gems ""Swan Song"", ""Higher Power"", ""Heart of the Dragon"", ""Ghost Rider"", ""Codename: Dragonfly"", and ""Cyclone"". A long list for episodes labeled ""gems"", I know, however they all truly deserve the distinction. ""Swan Song"" sees Walker struggle for survival in the mountains of Utah, as he fights an overprotective mother bear and wrestles a flesh-eating cyclops (Not kidding). ""Cyclone"" may, however, be the most far-fetched episode of Walker, Texas Ranger ever produced (despite Swan Song's more than valiant effort). To be brief, Walker fights a tornado. Wow. ""Ghost Rider"" reminds us that Walker was raised on a Cherokee Reservation and ""Higher Power"" provides a hilarious Norris slant on eastern philosophy.

The remaining episodes are, for the most part, your typical Walker. But no other season is packed as full of top notch Walker.",1203638400,,1175,5.211640211640212
3272874,5,B000Z6GT4K,"I can't wait for the Fourth Season! I had a great time watching the first three and the last seasons.

Funny to say that the fourth season will be no different than any of the other seaons. One of the following three things will happen in each episode - but with different locales and settings:

1) Alex gets kidnapped by some crazed con or ex-cop.
2) Walker goes on vacation or undercover and reveals a major gang operation by accident or luck.
3) For little or no apparent reason, a specific criminal targets the texas ranger, and everyone on his ""hit list"" is dead except for Walker and Walker bust the criminal by doing a spectacular martial art sideshow instead of using a gun.

I find Walker to be a hilarious show. When I was young, I found it to be semi-serious, but now as an adult, I can't help but laugh at some things. On one episode Walker played a con sent to a prison undercover of some hitman and the mob leader said, ""Some people eat airplane food and asks for seconds. You don't look like that kind of a man and that's why I trust you."" I was drinking some soda at that moment, and I almost sprayed it all over my laptop.

It's even more funny that every single bad guy in Texas knows expert martial arts. When given a choice between a gun or fighting hand-to-hand combat, every criminal chooses hand to hand, regardless of the fact if the criminal is armed to the teeth with automatic rifles and submachine guns.

Oh yeah, one episode a woman's father just gotten blown up by a grenade and probably burnt to pieces. Trivette came in trying to pick her up and they both started flirting right there next to her dad's burning car. And then she stomped off and Trivette was like, ""Gosh, women!"" Funny as anything.

One thing you can always count on, every episode ends with a slow motion round house kick to the face, and then CD, Walker, Trivette, Alex, and the new new members (in later seasons) kick it off with some joke where everyone laughs and then credit rolls.",1203033600,3,1985,4.395095367847412
3272875,5,B000Z6GT4K,"One of the highlights of my DVD collection is the Walker, Texas Ranger series. As a fan of old TV western films that starring Gene Autry, John, Wayne, Clayton Moore, Gary Cooper, and Jimmy Stewart, ""Walker"" hit the genre dead on without being western.

The fourth season of Walker continues the grand tradition of adventure, and moralistic adventures. Ranger Cordel Walker, Jimmy Trivette, and Assistant DA Alex Cahill tackle crime in the Dallas area. With Walker and his half Cherokee background, you just never know what kind of case (or evidence) comes up. ""Ghost Rider"" includes a mystic vision that leads Walker to the murderer in an 8 year old cold case. Eastern mysticism comes to the forefront in ""Higher Power"" as Walker protects a chosen one until his return to the monastery. Alex Cahill faces her father in court in ""Redemption"", and discovers how thick blood really is. Cordel Walker plays ""Christmas Carol"" to a group of orphans in a touching episode ""A Ranger's Christmas"". A hit man comes to town in ""The Deadliest Man Alive"" and Interpol collaborates with Walker to take him out. The supernatural re-enters Dallas in ""Heart of the Dragon"" as Walker restores a jade idol to it's proper owner.

My favorite (hard to pick) episode this season is probably the two part ""Sons of Thunder"" that introduces Trent Molloy to the outstanding cast of characters. Episodes like this are the reason why the show lasted 8 seasons, and could probably have lasted beyond Bonanzas' 12 years on the air.

The outstanding artwork that graces the inside of the disc cases of Walker beside his horse just cement the relationship between Walker and classic westerns.

You can't lose with Walker.

Yes, they are as different as night and day, but both shows has that very special something that make them stand out above all the rest. Cuck Norris had no problem adding faith, love of country and stories that make a difference in the lives of those who watch them. Season four is no different. Season four is full of that Walker magic hand to hand combat, car chases and the best in martial arts. As always Walker takes command with his hard hits and kicks more often than the use of his gun. It is all high octane adventure and never fear his side kick Trivette is right there at his side. Of course you have Cahill, assistant district attorney and mostly silent, but best friend C. D.

I really enjoy the closeness of the team. CD and Trivette's antics are really funny. The quiet romance between Walker and Alex. I really liked the reappearance of Terry Kiser
He makes such wonderful comic relief. This is definitely needed after some of the powerful and poignant episodes.

Weekdays I watch a disc every evening after work. Of course I take breaks to take my pups out and throw toys to fetch. It's so hard to go to bed without loading the next disc and watching just one more.

These episodes are like Cracker Jacks or Lay's potato chips. You can't have just one. They make these cold winter nights barely noticeable. January never went so quickly.

3272965,5,B000Z6GT4K,"Walker Texas Ranger just keeps better every episode. Chuck Norris pours a lot of his personal true life actions in this movie and that's what makes it great. Chuck Norris is truly a world champion, and he brings that spirit alive when he reaches out to help those in need. From children in need to the homeless, chuck proves again and again the greast weapon in anyone's arsenal is the indomidable will of the human spirit at its finest. If you read Chuck Norris's bio ""Inner Strength"" or ""Against All Odds,"" you'll see  the similariites between his true life actions and the stories portrayed in Walker Texas Ranger. His character Walker does quite a bit of charity work helping out kids in need, the homeless, and teaching the weak how to stand up and fight back. This is simply television at its finest. Larger than life character (Walker) fighting bad guys who desperately need their butts kicked, and helping those in need along the way with a heart that's bigger than Jupiter. What's not to love?!?",1320451200,,1004,4.704545454545454
3272966,5,B000Z6GT4K,I have always been a fan of the show Walker Texas Ranger! In fact when they first started showing Walker on CBS that is when I started being a fan of Chuck Norris. When I first started buying Walker Texas Ranger I was really looking forward to owning all of the seasons on dvd! I do not regret purchasing any of them on dvd. If I had to I would buy them all over again that is how good the show is (at least it is to me). I definitely recommend the fourth season for any Walker fan. This one had a lot of action and just has great episodes of Walker Texas Ranger! Chuck Norris did an excellent job in his portrayal of his character Cordell Walker. They could not have picked a better actor for Walker. This show has an excellent cast in it. I liked all of the characters in it and the actors in it. The production did an excellent job picking out the actors and actresses in the show! I have to admit I could not remember what episodes belonged to what season til I purchased them on dvd. I remembered some but not all I am glad that I have them on dvd because the picture quality is a whole lot better than the vhs tapes that I used to record the episodes on so I could watch them again. It is a must buy for any Walker fans and anyone looking for a great modern day western television series!!!,1315353600,,1296,4.06640625

Sometimes you must do this in a manner that isn't exactly up to ""standards"". I am shocked that this person, in the afore mentioned, could have time to watch and learn as he/she obviously took an extended period of time to write that editorial.
