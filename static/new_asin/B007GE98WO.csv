5085243,5,B007GE98WO,"I preordered this set and am very pleased with it.  It's a great price for the blu-rays, comes in a nice covered case and a nice hardcover book (a little over 60 pages) which has various information regarding Burton's career and his experiences making these films, it includes pictures from the set of Burton with the cast and some trivia and some nice artwork.

The blu-ray set itself is the double fold out type and each disc instead of having its own artwork, just simply has the title in the Burton font.  Many of the movies (Mars Attacks does not have extras) have a ton of extras including making of, commentary, Batman includes tons of information regarding Legends of the Dark Knight comic tales and Beetlejuice includes three episodes from the animated series.

So you are getting more than just the blu-ray films (which in my opinion is worth the price alone) but a nice set you won't regret displaying.

I'm very happy with the product.  The movies look and sound and great.",1336089600,,985,4.664739884393064
5085244,5,B007GE98WO,"I am really excited about this!  Tim Burton is absolutely my favorite director, and I was at a point where I was contemplating upgrading my Tim Burton titles to Blu-Ray anyway, and then I come across this set...this is a good chunk of the movies down in one swoop, plus I have Alice in Wonderland on Blu-Ray.  Just a handful more to go now.  Sure, other than Batman, Batman Begins, and Beetlejuice, this collector's set doesn't necessarily contain some of Tim Burton's absolute best movies...but these are all fun movies none the less!  Though I favor some of his movies over others, I still love the general majority of Tim Burton's workings and each of the movies in this set are enjoyable.  I grew up watching some of these as well, like Batman, Beetlejuice, and Peewee.

For those out there that don't realize and are wondering why Nightmare Before Christmas is not included in this set, it's because Tim Burton didn't actually direct Nightmare.  Henry Selick (James and the Giant Peach, Monkey Bone, Coraline) actually directed it.  Tim Burton merely produced it, as well as James and the Giant Peach, alongside Selick.  However, I do highly agree that Edward Scissorhands should have been added to this collection...it is one of his classic greats and should have by all rights been added to this collection as well.  That's probably my only single qualm about this set.

However, this is still a great set, and you get 7 movies plus a collectible book for only $45!  That's not bad, and the combined whole of these movies are totally worth that in my opinion!  Plus collectors, this is a limited edition set I'd wager to bet so you might wanna jump on this before they run out and others start selling it down the road for outrageous prices!  I, for one, have ordered mine.  Good stuff!",1336003200,,1793,4.68370607028754
5085245,5,B007GE98WO,"I'm giving this 5 stars simply because it delivers as advertised.

We've already been through the fact that this is not everyone of Burton's movies.

But, what you do get is a very good deal on some stellar movies in Blu Ray.

My only issue is that Batman is not Widescreen.  So far, I've watched Batman and Mars Attacks (widescreen).

The colors in Batman are excellent in this print and the sound is very, very good.

Batman has not looked as good since I saw it in the theater so many years ago.  And I still agree, Michael Keaton added something special to the movie.

If you're a Burton fan you should be pleased.

And the book is nice too.",1335916800,,645,4.308333333333334
5085246,5,B007GE98WO,"First off, as other people have noted, this set is from Warner Bros., and therefore legally can't contain any films Burton did for other studios.

With that out of the way, what we do get here is rather nice and at a great price. The current price is about $45, which is a deal for seven movies, especially considering that individually they would total around $110. That's just insane. The downside is that you don't get individual cases and artwork, which really messed with my ""movies in alphabetical order OCD"", but at this price I couldn't pass it up. On top of that, the discs are kept in a nice fold out digipack, which is inside a hardcover slipcase, and the set also comes with a nice quality hardcover book filled with glossy photos, movie posters, info on the films, and trivia. Overall a great value.",1335830400,10,812,4.561643835616438
5085247,4,B007GE98WO,"I'm already seeing some criticism for this set not containing some of Tim Burton's best films.

To that I say, take a breath and think before you type.

This set is being released by Warner Brothers.  All of the films in this collection were productions made with Warner Brothers Studios.  The Tim Burton films that are missing from this set were made at other studios.

For example...

Edward Scissorhands? 20th Century Fox
The Nightmare Before Christmas? Disney (Orginally a Touchstone production)
Sleepy Hollow? Paramount
Big Fish? Dreamworks
Ed Wood? Touchstone (aka Disney)
Sweeney Todd? Dreamworks
Alice in Wonderland? Disney

So...before you go spitting venom, do some homework.  You're getting seven films at a great price from arguably one of the most visionary directors of our time.  I call that a bargain.",1332115200,846,817,5.175572519083969
5085248,3,B007GE98WO,"Seriously? Tim Burton's best films? Half of these don't even have Johnny Depp. What about Burton's most infamous film? Gee,I don't know,maybe a little film called Edward Scissorhands. Or Ed Wood. Maybe Sleepy Hollow. How about Nightmare before Christmas. You can't seriously be suggesting Charlie ATCF is a better film than the latter. Or even Mars Attacks? It's doing an injustice to the genius that is Tim Burton. Great idea but I say put his better films in the box and charge a little more.",1332028800,10,494,4.823529411764706

5085305,3,B007GE98WO,"First, the bad I'll just get it out of the way: As many have said the packaging is pretty bad. It makes the mistake of placing DVDs on top of DVDs, which is always annoying. You have to take out one DVD to get to another. I understand this was to save money and space, but I don't care. It's obnoxious and I'm not gonna not complain about it. If the packaging were better it would have gotten another star.

Anyways, as to the content itself which is more important anyways: Burton is a creator who seems to draw mixed opinions. Some love him, some hate him. I, for one, am in the former camp. He is not my favorite director in the world, but he makes some interesting stuff. I have seen nothing of his that I would not at least call ""Worth seeing.""

Mind you, the selection of movies here leaves some stuff to be desired. It is only the Tim Burton movies Warner Bros owns. This leaves out a lot of great stuff like Ed Wood, Big Fish, and The Nightmare Before Christmas, but this still presents some little specks of Burton from different points in his career. Plus, the movies that are here are not bad and some are even quite good. Excusing Corpse Bride and maybe the first Batman all are movies I would want in my collection anyways, so this is quite a bargain.",1408406400,,1264,4.2625
5085306,5,B007GE98WO,"This is a great collection of several of Tim Burton's greatest hit movies. As a lot of reviewers has stated I don't understand why Edward Scissor Hands wasn't included? That should have been the first one in the collection!!!! The only problem in this collection I have is Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I love Tim Burton movies but honestly this is the one movie I really wish they didn't include. I really really dislike Tim's reboot of the original. Unfortunately his other greater movies are made by other production studios so you won't see them in this collection.

The Blu-ray menus are a bit limited and unimpressive but the quality of the movies are close enough to hi-def. Can't really tell if all the movies in the collection are truly remastered into HD, but it looks better than your standard DVD quality. The box is nice, although the set up of how the discs are stored could be better. I prefer the discs be stored separately and not floating on top of each other.

The booklet is really nice, pages are great quality, glossy. The artwork is great too.

5085309,5,B007GE98WO,"First, this set includes all of Burton's films with Warner Bros. (films not included liked Edwards Scissorhands were released under different studios). It's a cost effective way of buying all seven films and is an attractively packaged set that I would think any Tim Burton fan would really appreciate it. As for the movies themselves...

Batman, Batman Returns and Beetlejuice - what more needs to be said?

Pee Wee's Big Adventure - To me, Pee Wee Herman is an iconic character. And Tim Burton helped him get there. The movie is also of note for Burton fans because it's his directorial debut (at just 26 years old) and his first collaboration with Danny Elfman (also his first movie). And it's a wonderful quirky score that perfectly sets the tone of the film. And the film's similarly silly, quirky, innocent humor and tone foreshadows the rest of Burton's career. Above all else, Pee Wee is essentially a grown-up 10-year old and all of the said silly, quirky and innocent humor makes it incredibly charming and endearing to the child in all of us. Very, very funny all the way throughout and it's certainly unique and unlike many other comedies you'll see. I love this film.

Mars Attacks! - Maybe you'll need to see and appreciate the greatness of another one of Burton's films, Ed Wood (1994), to really appreciate this one. Ed Wood is often regarded as ""the worst director of all-time"" and his most famous film, 'Plan Nine from Outer Space' is a low-budget, ridiculous sci-fi film similarly regarded as ""the worst film of all-time"". Burton made this film directly after 'Ed Wood' and it's clearly a comedic homage to the low budget sci-fi films of the 1950's like 'Plan Nine from Outer Space'. Some people ""got"" the humor, others didn't. But it sure is quirky, and that's Tim Burton. I enjoy the film for these reasons. Even if it's not ""one of is best"".

Charlie and the Chocolate Factory - It's not replacing Gene Wilder's version; both films can co-exist peacefully. This is a classic story that future generations will come to know and will likely be re-told again many times over. Burton's adaptation is a little closer to the book. The use of modern special effects also make for some faithful and entertaining adaptations from the book (i.e. the squirrels cracking nuts). And again, the film contains a quirky tone and sense of humor. Another one of those I enjoy ""even if it's not his best bla bla bla"".

The Corpse Bride - The beautiful stop-motion animation alone might be reason enough to watch the film. It was released the same year as 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory', but in many ways this might be the most ""personal"" of the two films to Burton. Burton made 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' his own, but obviously it's an adaptation of a well-known, classic story and was almost a guaranteed commercial smash. 'Corpse Bride' was bound to reach a much smaller audience. The subject matter makes it more gothic, which seems more like Burton's style, and the film's playful look at the afterlife is reminiscent of 'Beetlejuice'. The title character of the film, the Corpse Bride (voiced superbly by Helena Bonham Carter') manages to portray a sense of beauty, innocence, and vulnerability - even in death - that really makes the film gripping. It also has some great musical numbers by Danny Elfman.

...as you can see, I think all films included are entertaining and each tell an interesting chapter of Tim Burton's career. And all on beautiful blu ray discs. As far as special features go - it's the same exact discs that are available for each film individually, so you can check out the specs for the single-disc editions here on Amazon to get a sense of what you're getting. Some might be disappointed with the lack of special features and lack of no new special features - but special features aren't a big deal to me. The art on the discs themselves have changed so that they all match for this set. Props to Warner Bros. for releasing something like this. Very nice recognition to one of the greatest directors in movie history.",1403913600,5,4064,4.7492917847025495

5085318,4,B007GE98WO,"How can they call it a collection without Ed Wood and Edward Scissorhands? Seriously Ed Wood is probably one of his greatest movies.

The box art is nice, the discs are well packaged and layed out in a pleasing manner. The transfers are as good as the stand alone blu ray discs and over all I'm pleased. Just wish it had the other 2 movies. :(",1388880000,,343,4.196969696969697

5085327,4,B007GE98WO,"Batman Returns was better than I remember. The Penguin storyline was mostly useless. Christopher Walken was the real villain and the Batman/rivalry is some of the best Hollywood script writing ever.

The original Batman never disappoints. Jack Nicholson makes the perfect Joker.

Pee-Wee and Beetlejuice are classics and seeing them in HD really brings the color and cinematography to life.

Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was good, but not outstanding, as was The Corpse Bride. Mars Attacks is just filler. Had this box set contained Edward Scissorhands, The Nightmare Before Christmas and Big Fish instead, it would have been a perfect ""5 stars"".",1385337600,,651,5.300970873786408

5085332,5,B007GE98WO,"An excellent deal for seven movies on Blu-Ray, and you get a book as a bonus. The package is a bit inconvenient; to get to some movies you have to remove another disc first. You may not love all seven movies in this package (especially since it doesn't include some of his most popular films; this only includes the films he did for Warner Brothers) but the price is good even if a couple of them don't work for you.",1384732800,,416,4.2125
5085333,5,B007GE98WO,"Great movies at a great value, I really enjoy the mini book that it came with. It's missing some essentials, but I've already got those anyway. Definitely a good value",1384560000,,167,4.6
5085334,4,B007GE98WO,"This is a GREAT deal, if you're a Burton fan at all. Two of my favorite childhood flicks (Batman and Beetlejuice) are in this collection, and for 26$ that's like five extra movies for free -- on Blu-Ray? Awesome. I've only watched a few of the movies so far, and the BD is nice-but-not-earth-shattering.

I love that I now have the first two Batman flicks. I LOVED these both, as they are head-and-shoulders above the others in the 90's Batman flicks. Batman Returns I found to be a better movie than the first, in the vein of a fun-and-awesome Batman, rather than the gritty Nolan films.

Beetlejuice, Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, and Mars Attacks! are all great, zany fun that I can't wait to crack open and spin a few times.

I hadn't watch Corpse Bride until this set. It's not a spectacular movie, but I'm sure I'll watch it again. I still haven't seen Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

The only reason this isn't a 5-star review is because of the obvious omission of a few of Burton's other great films -- namely Edward Scissorhands and Nightmare Before Christmas. I guess it's not too difficult to figure out why they weren't included, though...",1383523200,,1150,4.650246305418719
5085335,5,B007GE98WO,Saves buying multiple videos. Great box set. Definitely recommend this is these aren't movies you own. Booklet is pretty cool.,1383523200,,126,5.35
5085336,5,B007GE98WO,"I;m not going to review the movies.  If you can browse the internet and are old enough to buy things on Amazon you should have at least seen a few of these.  No, this review is purely on the packaging.

Most multi-movie packs have more then one movie per disc..and that's just DVD.  Go to any store and you can find four pack movies on double sides discs.  It's a mess, and a bad idea.  Using blu-ray they could have very easily put multiple movies on each disc and called it a day.  But they don't, each movie has it's own disc.  The discs themselves are not loose and wobbly inside the package.  the packaging folds out like ""fat pack"" tv seasons (Early releases of Buffy, Angel, and bablyon 5 have the same style packaging).

The book that comes with the set fits nicely into the outer case.  It's a nice hardcover that won't get easily damaged by ""shelf wear"" like most books.  It has fun little trivia and behind the scenes images form all the movies in this set.

The discs are clearly labeled for what movie they are, and have a white and black label.  In fact the entire set keeps a simple color scheme of black, white, and purple with spirals that make it easy to tell they are a set and ment to go together.

Whiel this is by no means a ""complete"" collection, and jsut his movies form one studio, it is a nice glimpse into the work history of a director who has a very uniquie and distinct style that is easily spotted...be it animation, super heros, and anything inbetween.",1382745600,4,1484,4.326086956521739
5085337,4,B007GE98WO,Got it on sale for $26 bucks. At under $4 a movie even if it I didn't like them all it was to good a deal to pass up for the ones I wanted.,1382486400,,139,3.1176470588235294
5085338,4,B007GE98WO,"I'm totally biased in that Beetlejuice is one of my favorite movies. I was excited to find this set. The packaging is nice, and I like the art book. The only movie I wasn't excited about was Pee Wee's Big Adventure. It seems like a pretty solid set to add to a family videos collection.",1382486400,3,286,4.218181818181818
5085339,4,B007GE98WO,"Tim Burton fans will like this collection. The picture and audio quality for all the films are good except Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Corpse Bride which look and sound even better. There is over 7 hours of total bonus content but much of it is for Batman and only 4 of the films have audio commentaries. The longest featurette is ""Shadows of the Bat: The Cinematic Saga of the Dark Knight"" which runs for 73 minutes. Mars Attacks! is the only film devoid of bonus content. You do get a collectible hardcover book containing 64 pages of rare, never-before-seen photos and illustrations. This collection is priced right so it works as a value pack. Burton fans who own the stand-alone Blu-ray releases may not want to upgrade because little exclusive material is provided. This collection repackages the stand-alone Blu-ray releases except Charlie and the Chocolate Factory where you get the ""In-Movie Experience"" and ""Audio Commentary with Tim Burton"" that is exclusive to this set. These are Warner films so some other great movies from Burton such as Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow, Ed Wood and Big Fish are sold separately. My only real complaint is that a 3-hour documentary about Tim Burton and his filmography could have made this set more deluxe.

7 Films: Pee Wee's Big Adventure (1985), Beetlejuice (1988), Batman (1989), Batman Returns (1992), Mars Attacks! (1996), Corpse Bride (2005), and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005).

5085342,5,B007GE98WO,This is a great collection of visionary Burton's work. I would have liked to see some more of his movies included but this is a very good sampling of his career.,1376265600,,161,4.225806451612903
5085343,4,B007GE98WO,"I enjoyed this set very much, but the case the films are packed in leave something to be desired. If you're looking at this review you probably don't need a review on the movies themselves. For them I give this a 5 star review for a great selection of Tim Burton Films distributed by Warner. The films that aren't included were not released by Warner and are not included in this set for those wondering why.

Anyway, the mark on this set is that the Blu Ray trays don't properly hold the films. When I go to open this fold out style case there is always one movie that is off of the tray floating. This is weird since I never move the box until I am going to watch a movie and just from that slight movement it dislodges the disc. Very disappointed in that. I checked and the clips on the center of the plastic tray are still intact, so this is just a sloppy design.

But aside from that, this is a worthy buy for a great selection of films. Just don't move the box around to much once you have it.",1373500800,14,999,4.1179487179487175

The collection of movies includes: Batman, Batman Returns, Beetlejuice, Mars Attacks, Pee Wee's Big Adventure, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Corpse Bride. It is really a good collection of good movies for the price. It also comes with a really nice hard bound book detailing the features and history of each movie. So far we have watched all except Beetlejuice and Corpse Bride. I have had a PS3 since launch day and consequently only watch Blu-ray movies exclusively. I am always amazed at how awesome they look on my 60 inch Samsung and I much prefer them to any theatre experience with the larger grainier images. That being said, I was a bit disappointed with the sharpness and crispness of the images. They just don't look quite the same as other more contemporary Blu-ray movies do (to my wife and I anyway). That's not to say, they don't look good, just that they don't ""pop out"" and amaze me like I am used to. I'm hoping that Corpse Bride will retain the quality of the one I bought individually. Still very much worth the price. I actually bought three sets ... one for me and two as Christmas presents for next Christmas.

I had most of these movies in DVD format already, but to get these movies in Blu Ray format for this price was too good to pass up. This is a great collection for any Tim Burton fan. It's nice to have all these movies in this very convenient package. Hours of entertainment at a great price; what more is there to say?",1359158400,,368,3.92
5085379,4,B007GE98WO,"I'll allow these movies to speak for themselves.

The bluerays in this collection are of pretty good quality.  They come in an unfoldable multidisc sleeve and a really neat booklet on each movie.  So far I've watched both Batmans and Beetlejuice and each started up without a blueray menu for me to rehit play.  The only negative thing I could say is that the sound is a bit high during the music and action, but low during the talking parts - however this could be my TV settings too.

Overall great collection!",1359158400,,512,4.521739130434782

5085384,5,B007GE98WO,"This blu ray set is truly better than I expected. In this set, you pull out a case that opens up and has 7 movies. The movies each have their own plastic place within the fold out case. I have several sets similar to this one, and I have to say that I really like the way this one is laid out. The selection of movies are eclectic and all Burton! In this set, you have:

  of The Dark Knight Part Four: Dark Side of the Knight- Bats, Mattes, and Dark Knights: The Visual Effects of
  Batman-plus more

Beetlejuice-
  This blu ray includes 3 of the cartoons which is a wonderful bonus: A-Ha, Skeletons in the Closet, and Spooky
  Boo-Tique  (Please Release the entire cartoon series on DVD or Blu Ray!! I would Buy It!!

Mars Attacks- This Blu Ray does not have any extras on it that I can see.

Pee-Wee's Big Adventure
  Commentary by Paul Reubens and Director Tim Burton- Additional Scenes- Production Sketches and
  Storyboards- Music only track with commentary by Danny Elfman

  Inside The Two Worlds- Danny Elfman Interprets The Two Worlds- The Animators:The Breath of Life-
  Tim Burton: Dark vs Light- Voices From the Underworld-Making Puppets Tick-The Voices Behind The Voice-
  and more

This set also includes a small hardback book filled with pictures from the movie sets and actors. It is filled with knowledge about each movie as well. I am pleased with this set. It is Blu Ray only, so I wish it had included DVDs also. I also wish that Mars Attacks would have had more extras.

What I find amazing is  how many movies I have come to love not realizing it was Burton who made them. Shoot. I hope my readers don't do that when I have athored several books. I find it different following a film maker than let's say a movie star, author or rock star so when I had realized how many of the movies I loved were in this package I was surprised. I may have to reconsider not following or pay more attention to who is directing what fims.

The movie was Directed by Henry Selick, Which also did Caroline and James and The giant peach. With that said. I'm pretty sure the reason his other movies are not on here is I;m pretty sure all the other movies where done by or at different studios. Kind of the same reason Most collections are not complete with either missing the first one or some of there sequels. Is The reason you sometimes get first two movies and like a whole different movie has nothing to do with them and things like that. But yeah blu ray and I actually like every movie there but one.

The case is sturdy and has a wonderful montage of the characters from the films on the front. Located inside is the Digipak-style case, which holds all seven films. I was thrilled to have a chance to own many of my childhood favorites (especially both Batman films, Beetlejuice, and Pee-Wee's Big Adventure).
The Batman films alone are hard to find, and are a great pair of films. The accompanying book is very nice, and provides some wonderful behind the scenes photos of the director and some of his cast. If you are a Tim Burton fan, buy this collection! You will not be disappointed.",1348272000,11,721,4.73015873015873

The blu-rays themselves make these movies look better than they ever have and I've owned most of these on VHS and first generation DVDs. Plus, this is a great way to get Batman and Batman Returns, which for some reason are insanely expensive when bought individually on BD at the time of this writing. The book is lovingly designed with nice pictures and tidbits about each of the movies. While I would've loved to have seen some special features added to Mars Attacks! and some movie-specific features to Beetlejuice besides the cartoons, this is just a small qualm that does not take away from the special quality of this package. Also makes an awesome gift for the Tim Burton fan in your life. Enjoy!",1347926400,27,826,4.625850340136054

ok first of all if you like tim burton movies for what they are then you'll love this selection which is all from the same studio that's why there aren't some of the classics in it.  whew that was a mouth full.  the picture quality ranges from good- great depending on the age of the movies so this is about as good as the older ones will ever look.  i bought this as a started collection to my burton collection.  i had most of my favs already but none of these so win win.  ;)",1336867200,,519,4.089108910891089

I thought the book may be bigger but it slides into the box right next to the Blu Ray's. The box is made of a hard, thick cardboard, almost like a hardbound book. People are complaining about this set not including some of Burton's (better) films, but I actually love this Warner Brother's selection. I would loved to have Sweeney Todd included, but no complaints here. The Blue's are housed in a fold out package and other than Batman are stacked on top of eachother. Well worth the money for a good set from an amazing director. If you are thinking about pushing the (add to cart) button, do so without second guessing, you will love it!",1336608000,,787,4.472222222222222
5085401,5,B007GE98WO,"I just got my Tim Burton set in the mail today, so pull up a chair, and let me tell you what you get.
First of all, I will freely admit that I am a HUGE Tim Burton fan, and was very excited when I saw this listed on Amazon.  I sold my copies of the movies I already owned on Blu-ray to pay for it.  Of course, with the price being so low on this set, I actually ended up making a profit.

THE PACKAGING: When you open your copy, you will find a very sturdy box with the artwork shown on the website on the front, and the same border design on the back with a listing of all the movies included in the set.  The discs themselves are housed in a foldout digi-pak, with the discs secured in a two-disc stack pattern.  Since there are only seven discs, Batman is attached with a single hub.  This is the type packaging where you have to remove the top disc in order to get the bottom disc out.  I didn't have any problems, and I feel the discs are all very secure and safe.  In addition to the discs being in the foldout package, there is also a list of all the supplemental material available for each title.  I thought that was a nice touch.  Each discs also has new artwork that is in keeping with the design that is present in the border around the front and back of the box.  I liked the fact that new artwork was created for the discs, instead of just throwing discs in with the current artwork on them.  Nice touch!!  The movies all have the same special features as was present on previous Blu-ray releases.

THE BOOKLET:  The booklet is a great treat.  Each movie gets anywhere from 6 to 12 pages each in the book.  The book is a hardcover, and the pages are all thick with a shiny sheen to them.
  *  Pee Wee - 8 pages
  *  Beetlejuice - 6 pages
  *  Batman - 8 pages
  *  Batman Returns - 8 pages
  *  Mars Attacks - 8 pages
  *  Corpse Bride - 12 pages
  *  Charlie - 12 pages
Each film gets an introduction, poster page, behind the scenes shots, some sketch art, movie info, and trivia.  This is very nice, and should count as a blu-ray exclusive feature since this set is not available on DVD.  I was just expecting to see a few pictures stuck in a book, with little thought put into it.  What you get is a very well thought out little book, that adds to the enjoyment of each film.

BOTTOM LINE:  If you don't have any of these on Blu-ray, then I would strongly suggest you get this set.  It's a great price for what you get.  If you do already own them, you may want to consider doing what I did.  Sell all your current copies on Amazon, and then turn around and order this set.  I ended up making a nice little profit, plus now I have all of these Burton films in a very nice collection which will proudly be displayed on my shelf.",1336176000,142,2744,4.0429906542056075
