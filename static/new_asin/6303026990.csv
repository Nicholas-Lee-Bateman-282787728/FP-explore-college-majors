This volume showcasing the best of the tv series really shows what made this such a popular title in Japan. This a comedy that will have you laughing, but be aware that some parts are not suitable for little kids. Ryoga, Ranma's rival from childhood comes to Ranma's town and challenges Ranma to a battle. I won't tell you how it ends, but be warned Ryoga has a problem with his sense of direction... If you're looking for an anime just meant to make you laugh until you hurt, but still have an intriguing storyline to keep you watching, this is the video for you.",993168000,,718,4.325925925925926

Genma gets lost in the snow and ends up playing panda for a little boy who is apparently  sick.  Of course the kid feeds well, cause why else would he be there?  ranma and akane set off to find him and end up tied up in a huge mess.  Plus, Ryoga decides to enter Furinken high and needs to study with akane.  Happosai dreams up a scheme and captures akane, resulting in a rooftop  fight scene.  But be careful- akane kicks in here sleep!  This was a  hilarious two episodes of ranma 1/2.  I reccomend this to all those who  love the bizarre.",961977600,,671,4.264

He's more interested in the future of Ranma and Akane! Who is this guy?  Me and my  friends loved this movie!  The plott twists are not very ordinary, but  neither is Ranma.  This movie is just one of the fabulous Ranma 1/2 movie  collection!",960595200,,383,4.712121212121212
535911,5,6303026990,"If you want to know why Akane wears her hair short then pick up this volume. In this tape we are introduced to another main character that goes by the name of Ryoga ""where am I now?"" Hibiki. Ryoga comes to  Tokyo to get revenge against Ranma for destroying his life.  This tape  is one of my favorites in the series. The animation is pretty good  especially during the fight scene between Ranma and Ryoga.  This tape  has mild language and brief nudity.",949968000,,453,4.397590361445783
535912,5,6303026990,"The first ep, on the tape is one where a new teacher shows up.  If you've ever had a motivational speaker come to your school, this one will be hilarious.  He is a perfect exaggeration of the people that always come to  mine and I guess that's why I found it so funny.  The second ep is where a  new disciple shows up.  He's totally against fighting and stealing, but is  willing to do anything to learn master Happosai's techniques. This one's  okay.  I laughed a couple times through it, but overall any ranma fan  should get this one. Plus Ukyo's in the first ep.  My all time fav  character.  I wanted to give it 4 1/2 stars except it wouldn't let me.  This was a great xmas gift.",946425600,,684,4.2015503875969

I'm just bitter because they changed Ranma's voice actor and after the first 3 seasons I've become pretty attached to him. I hope they change back because his girl type still has the same voice. I doubt they do but I really really hope so.",1404172800,,347,4.523809523809524
7834819,5,6303026990,"Very well kept box set, discs are clean and cases look near new.  As far the series, a very fun series with some interesting stories, miss the original boy type Ranma english voice actor but still, one of the best series of all time in my opinion.",1375315200,,247,4.25531914893617

For anyone who hasn't heard of Ranma yet, or wants to get into the series - I definitely recommend starting from season one.

Season four continues the crazy antics of Ranma and company including Akane, Ryoga, Shampoo, Genma, etc. As we all know the artistry has gone a bit down hill since season the end of season two and just doesn't seem to be drawn as well as it was originally, but it's still great nonetheless. The DVDs seem to be straight ports from VHS tapes and the video quality is not stellar, but it's not awful either. This series could benefit a lot from being re-mastered. Let's not forget that this series debuted at the end of 80's after all.

One of the big changes that everyone will notice about season four is the change in the male voice actor of Ranma. What I always loved about this series was the wonderful voice of English actors that really brought life to this series. They all have great chemistry and the female voice of Ranma is just hilarious. We now have the actor who does the voice acting for the Inuyasha anime series taking on his new role as male Ranma. It took me some getting use to, but after about 3 episodes it wasn't even that noticeable anymore.

This is the second re-release of season four and the set is a lot slimmer and helps save space on your media shelf. The price has also dropped, but its better when you get this set on sale. If you're a fan of animation, cartoons, Japanese anime, comics, or just enjoy a good laugh this is the series to pick up. It'll keep you entertained in its enthralling twenty-four episode season.",1262304000,3,2081,5.338414634146342
7834823,5,6303026990,As long as you don't expect plot and great story you will find yourself enjoying the Ranma 1/2 series. I find myself watching them when I just want to relax and smile. It is an easy series to sit down and watch an episode or two.,1252800000,,229,4.0
7834824,4,6303026990,"This set contains a total of twenty-four episodes.  The first four discs contain five episodes, while the fifth disc contains four episodes and the special features.

The special features menu contains five options: ""Line Art Gallery,"" ""Textless Opening,"" ""Textless Ending,"" ""Cast List,"" and ""Actor Profiles.""  As you would expect, the textless opening and ending are just the opening and ending credits without the text.  However, it should be noted that for the textless opening, it is a textless version of the original Japanese opening (the English graphic for the title that covers the Japanese graphic is absent from this version of the opening).  The line art gallery has twenty-eight pages of model sketches of the characters that appear on this DVD box set.  The cast list is a list of the English and Japanese voice actors for each character.  The actor profiles are selected filmographies for the English voice actors.

Ranma 1/2 Outta Control is a rather ""low frills"" DVD set, and the extras are similar to what can be found on Ranma 1/2 Anything-Goes Martial Arts and Ranma 1/2 Hard Battle.  While these features are better than what appeared on the first Ranma 1/2 DVD box set, I wish an effort had been made to track down some of the English voice actors and include interviews with them as extras on the DVD box sets.

This season of Ranma 1/2 introduces the principal for Furinkan High School, a new disciple for the Tendo Dojo (who only appears in one episode), and a character that appeared in the second season of Ranma 1/2 makes a return appearance.  This season also saw a couple of stories that ran for more than one episode (these kind of story arcs were all but gone during the third season of Ranma 1/2).

Ranma 1/2 is very enjoyable for an older audience (16 and up), and really should be in an anime fan's DVD collection.",1230681600,,1849,4.74375
7834825,4,6303026990,"Yea this season had some very funny episodes, ok so every one said this season sucked but it wasent all that bad,Alright so in this season Ranma gets a new voice acter Richard Cox The same voice that plays inuyasha yes its weird out first because his voice seems much deeper but once you get to about the 3 disc you start to get used to it but its still Ranma!,But other that the new voice acter this season is pretty good well at least i liked it and also in this season Ranma and Akane start to become more close but they still fight but in a more friendly way,It Doesnt that much muti episode arcs mostly just 30 min single episodes that are just Fun and funny all the charicter are there but theres less shampoo in this season also i dident really care for the first disc ,but still this season has some really good episodes that you won't want to miss if your a huge ranma fan like me but if you don't like ranma that much i wouldent gett this season.",1197417600,2,956,4.145161290322581
7834826,5,6303026990,"This is another great tape in the Ranma saga and it introduces another great main character to the series. It's a lot of laughs, a lot of fun and of course the 1st episode with Ranma's new girl side voice.
Episode 1, Enter Ryoga. After travelling many miles, around the countryside and inner cities of Japan, a young man of Ranma's past comes looking for him. Ryoga Hibiki is his name and revenge is his game. Seriously, I don't care what anyone says Ryoga is raw! And this episode is a classic! A lot of Ryoga's story is told in this one and also some really great laughs.
Episode 2, after ""accidentily"" getting lost while fighting Ranma, Ryoga finds his way back to Furinkan again. And now the fight of a lifetime is at hand because Ryoga demands revenge on Ranma and this time he'll make sure that Ranma doesn't ""run away"". But Ranma has to be twice as careful as usual because the combined might of the Furinkan Chem Club has their own plans as well
""lose Ranma, lose Ranma, lose Ranma, lose Ranma""
Again, another great volume in the TV series. Like I always tell people if you really want to get into Ranma, the TV series is the best starting point because it tells all and it's really great. Seriously, I can only think of one tape that I don't like as much (TV Series 3). Anyway, definately get this one. And don't forget to pick the continuation of the Ranma and Ryogas saga in TV Series 5. Enjoy!
