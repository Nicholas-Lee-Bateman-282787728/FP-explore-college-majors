8112379,5,B000EP1QJU,"Highly recommended for Twisted Sister fans.  Dee and gang team up with long time director Marty Callner and document the band live in San Bernardino, California only a few months before the release of their most successful album ""Stay Hungry"".  Live tracks include the then never before heard ""The Beast"", ""The Price"" and ""I Wanna Rock"".  The band also executed top notch performances of ""Under The Blade"" and ""The Kids Are Back"".  This VHS is a must have for any die hard Twisted Sister fan.  Most recently some of this material was included on the DVD ""Twisted Sister - The Videos"" but the DVD doesn't quite capture the nostalgia and history of the VHS box art and the 1984 60 minute tape.  Interviews with Dee and includes the videos for ""We're Not Gonna Take It"" and ""You Can't Stop Rock N' Roll"".",1326585600,,801,4.605633802816901
