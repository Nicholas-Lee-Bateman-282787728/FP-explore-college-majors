8743067,5,B018URAX6A,"great short film, cinematography is extraordinary, beautifully edited, great story with a twist at the end.
I loved that it was not all tied up neatly for us. All the actors were excellent.",1469232000,,189,4.757575757575758
8743068,5,B018URAX6A,I thought it was excellent! It left me wanting to see more and I think that's a good thing.  Brian did a great job on this and the death scene by Mark Jaeger was outstanding.,1460592000,,174,3.9714285714285715
8743069,5,B018URAX6A,"An amazing movie by young director Brian Crewe. Crewe's directing along with Kerr's excellently written, tight script keep the story moving and the viewer on edge and involved --the 16 minutes fly by and I felt as if I had glimpsed a ""real"" moment of history! The tension of war is very real and the ambiguous ending is so much like life it kept me and my film partner discussing possibilities, based upon the formal ""hints"" offered during the course of the film, for quite some time. A serious joy to experience!",1449100800,,513,4.586956521739131
