He provides key websites to use in determining your online reputation and the tools about how to improve it! Very important not just for job seekers but for anyone who is interested in their online reputation!",1335744000,,458,5.12
8496132,5,B006BHYF5C,The Online Reputation Management Video enlightened me to the possibilities of what would be online.  It showed an Employer Workshop which I hosted that was great.  But it also showed my wrong age which does not help in my job search.  There are lots of websites that Joshua mentioned to modify and change you're Reputation online.  I will go in and see what they are about.  Thanks Josh.,1335744000,,387,4.632352941176471
8496133,5,B006BHYF5C,"I would like to present my remarks in the context of an old (er) job searcher and one who has sought to help job seekers through Linkedin, SMM and blogging.  In this age of powerful technology, as Ralph Peters wrote, the greatest problems we face are human in nature.  With rampant under-employment in concert with unemployment, many old (er) workers are in need of learning how to use technology to better present who they are, i.e., seasoned veterans seeking to be seen, found and heard in an increasingly crowded and competitive E-world. If this sounds like you, specifically if you have wondered if using Linkedin is right for you, then Joshua Waldman's videos (and book) can help you.  Joshua breaks down a seemingly-baffling subject into attainable and understandable projects and goals.  Once you personally experience being found on-line, as a direct result of his common-sense advice, likely you too will be a fan like me.  But the only way to get there is to read and view his advice.  Invest in your job searching success by purchasing this and the other videos (and book) Joshua Waldman has authored.  Unless you do not act on what you read, I doubt you will be disappointed.

Sincerely,

John

PS -- be sure to view the other videos and his book, too.

8496134,5,B006BHYF5C,"This work by Joshua Waldman is a very important for anyone who leverages social media in their personal or professional lives. In this video, Joshua discusses how to protect, maintain and manage your online profiles. I was blown away by the plethora of ways that your online persona can be damaged and misinterpreted as well as how important it is to manage your online profiles on a regular basis. This is a ""must see"" video.",1335398400,,426,4.693333333333333

This excellent DVD will show you the necessary steps to manage your online persona, something which is very necessary these days for the average person, but even more so when one is seeking new employment. Do you really want the first thing that a prospective employer sees when conducting an online search on your name, (and this WILL happen at some point in the selection process), to be unflattering, or possibly even erroneous data which should not be attributed to you?

Without resorting to unnecessary jargon or trying to blind you with science, Joshua Waldman will show you how you can begin to regain CONTROL over how Google, and by extension the rest of the world, sees YOU!",1335139200,,897,6.05511811023622

As a job seeker, I appreciated the details provided and samples for each section.  The samples are a great way to get thinking about how to approach branding yourself using social media.

8496139,5,B006BHYF5C,"I work in career services at a large metropolitan university.  We have a non traditional student base with an average age of 35.  When students, grads, or alumns come to us to help them with their job search, one of the first things we ask is if they have a linkedin profile.  A surprising number sheepishly admit they do, but they haven't done much with it.  That's their first assignment.  Get it done!  At first we referred them to Joshua Waldman's blog, Career Enlightenment, then to the book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Job-Searching-with-Social-Media-For-Dummies/dp/0470930721/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Job Searching with Social Media For Dummies</a>and now this great easy to use DVD!

In my experience, many of the students just don't know what to say.  Joshua breaks down the linkedin social media elements in easily managed bites!  The explanation of how to craft a really great branding statement is worth the whole price for instance.  A lot of people are reluctant to put their picture on their profile because of the ""ism""s ""ageism, racism, sexism"", but when he offers his view on that excuse, you'll find yourself saying ""he is absolutely right!""  Joshua lays out an easy to follow step by step plan for finishing your profile, once you are done you'll wonder why you didn't do it earlier.

Waldman has long championed the use of social media for an effective job search.  For myself, I always figured it was more for people in high tech or very corporate positions, so I didn't take it very seriously.  When I started my current job I had to get myself up to speed on social media right away so plugging into Joshua's blog and a webinar he did for our University a year ago, started me off.  Using his techniques I reworked my own linkedin profile and continually tweek it because it is a 24/7 PR campaign for me!  I've learned to build my reputation with groups, start finding and effectively using my links, and I'm working on my branding statement.  It's paying off!

Statistically over 85% of employers/hiring managers use social media to research potential hires. Using Waldman's DVD techniques you are insuring that what the employers see is what puts you in the best light possible.  If you need a job and you aren't using social media, you are just making it harder on yourself.  Make an investment in yourself with this DVD, or his book, and subscribe to his blog, careerenlightenment.com, and find out how much easier that job search will be!",1333324800,,2517,5.019277108433735
