2768851,5,B0002475SE,"Kavanagh offers yet another opportunity to for John Thaw to demonstrate the variety of his acting prowess.  Gentler than Morse, Thaw nevertheless brings his timing, demeanor, articulation to this enjoyable series.  His delivery is ""right on"".",1404000000,4,242,5.694444444444445
2768852,5,B0002475SE,"Although I have seen all of these episodes before, I enjoyed seeing them in order.  John Thaw was wonderful as always, but obviously Kavanagh didn't really get to properly develope as much as I would have liked",1393891200,4,210,4.675675675675675
2768853,5,B0002475SE,"A different vein of English law as seen from the defence and prosecution in an English life. Great acting, great costumes and what pomp and circumstance.",1392940800,,153,4.923076923076923
2768854,5,B0002475SE,"The last work of a great actor. At least when he left as Inspector Morse, there was Kavanagh. He'll be missed.",1375056000,3,110,4.285714285714286
2768855,4,B0002475SE,"I say this is a rip off because it doesn't have all ""8"" episode in series 4. It does not contain ""Ceremony of Innocence"" nor does it include ""Seasons of Mist"". I figure if I pay $186.00 for something I should get the WHOLE thing.",1374710400,10,229,4.111111111111111
2768856,5,B0002475SE,I ordered this set of disks several years ago and its a wonderful collection. The main character has died since i viewed the collection. He was a very good British actor and will be missed. Buy this set if you like a good mystery.,1365379200,4,230,4.25
2768857,5,B0002475SE,"John Thaw at his finest. If you enjoyed him as sergeant reagan or inspector morse, you will not be let down by purchasing this collection.",1307836800,14,138,4.56
2768858,5,B0002475SE,John Thaw is one my favorite actors. I have watched most the the episodes now and this actor is reliably good as are the episodes. I highly recommend the series to anyone who enjoys British murder mysteries. I have a region 2 DVD player on which to watch this--it was not expensive and works perfectly.,1279756800,,302,4.509090909090909
2768859,4,B0002475SE,"So far we have only watched series one and two, but have enjoyed every minute of it.",1444176000,,84,4.0
2768860,5,B0002475SE,Anything with John Thaw in it is brilliant in my opinion!  Love this series..my husband and I have been watching it almost every evening when possible.  We're going through it too quickly....but I'm sure we'll be re-watching at some point...just like the Inspector Morse series!  :),1443139200,,282,5.086956521739131

2768862,5,B0002475SE,"The actor John Thaw is wonderful, and the writing is great.  If you like courtroom drama, this show is one of the best. Plus, I love to watch anything that John Thaw is in.  I have the whole collection of Morse and now Kavanagh Q.C.",1420156800,5,232,4.133333333333334
2768863,3,B0002475SE,"Subject matter of most episodes were unattractive and the ending solutions plain lousy.  .Also, why must there always be a character in series suchas Kavanagh, who acts like a boob but yet must have a much higher IQ and sophistication normally required of a highly educated barrister. Sorry I paid big money to buy the entire series.",1413244800,2,333,4.842105263157895
2768864,5,B0002475SE,It was a great series.  Our family is a great one to enjoy the British dramas and mysteries.  This was even better than the Inspector Morse series.,1410393600,,147,4.407407407407407
2768865,5,B0002475SE,I love this British show...it is wonderful....I wish there is more like it,1408665600,2,74,4.769230769230769
2768866,5,B0002475SE,"John Thaw is such an excellent actor.  This biggest problem with this series is that it is too short.  With story lines that may at first seem black and white, the shows throw in lots of gray.  As for the British judicial system, this series is a great follow on from Rumpole in that Kavanagh does not have that base of humor that Rumpole built upon but rather exhibits a great deal of seriousness.",1408406400,7,398,4.351351351351352
2768867,3,B0002475SE,"Every episode barring two or three is very entertaining.  And I love John Thaw (I too relish literature and classical music), so that's not it.  I appreciate the character Jeremy, despite his obvious flaws and the fact he was chosen to be an object of putdowns.  He is a Tory in a world of lefties.  And there lies the rub.  Although the series does not grow overtly political and there appears balance, you can smell the leftwing in the air.  Enough of aging 'Sixties' hippies and protesters even if they've mellowed.  At least Kavanagh's wife was a woman of faith.  Remember, by their nature, mystery stories tend traditional. This series slid a bit too far leftward. The center can hold!",1408060800,3,690,4.691666666666666
2768868,4,B0002475SE,John Thaw is definitely a favorite. We are enjoying the episodes as we get time to watch.,1405987200,,89,4.294117647058823
8177774,5,B0002475SE,"I bought this for my Dad for Christmas, he loves John Thaw as Inspector Morse and now Kavanagh Q.C. too! The box the dvds came in is top quality. I could not find the box set anywhere else, so I was glad to find it here.",1519430400,,220,3.8043478260869565

8177778,5,B0002475SE,A wonderful series.  Great writing and acting.  I believe the only reason it ended was the  premature death of John Thaw from cancer.,1490054400,,133,4.695652173913044
