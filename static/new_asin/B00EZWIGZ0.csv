8611007,3,B00EZWIGZ0,"The quality isn't the best, but it's not terrible either. Have to keep in mind that you're dealing with a show that came out over 40 years ago, so there will be some issues in image quality. But it's been fun to watch the cartoons I loved as a kid, and be able to still sing along with the music.",1399334400,,296,3.95

8611009,5,B00EZWIGZ0,"Who doesn't remember The Greatest Group in the annals of Rock and Roll? Who was not there when The Fab Four played The Ed Sullivan Show or their sellout concert at Shea Stadium? This cartoon, which I remember from my childhood puts John, Paul, George and Ringo in various misadventures from their homeland to the U.S.A.. It also includes sing-alongs to their greatest songs. There are lots of discs in this series, so it is hard to decide as to which one I like the best. The re-release of their U.S. albums is also beneficial for those of us who have waited for years. This cartoon conquered the ratings race every time, leaving all others in the dust. The mark that The Fab Four left on the world is one that will never be erased or overtaken by anybody. Along with their theatrical releases, these are a treasure for you, your kids and theirs. (Acme TV)",1394496000,,856,4.493589743589744
8611010,5,B00EZWIGZ0,"The delivery was prompt, and the transfer quality was very good for a nearly fifty year old print. Brings back good memories. Still love the show to my delight. Thanks for making this available.",1383177600,,194,4.735294117647059
