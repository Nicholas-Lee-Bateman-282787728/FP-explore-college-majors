8405647,1,B003U4VGGU,The plot was bad and their was not enough sowing off sex then they talk too much.  I would like more sex in pleasure,1383264000,,116,3.8333333333333335
8405648,2,B003U4VGGU,for the movie catagory I found this in it is a waste of time . poor acting obviously but was looking in adult movies section and unless they are cussing in their language there is nothing adult about it.,1362441600,,203,4.230769230769231
8405649,5,B003U4VGGU,"It was actually really hilarious. Seriously. Get a few friends and force yourself to watch it until you enjoy it. I have never laughed so hard. Plus most of the girls are pretty cute, except for the yellow ranger who possibly has a penis.",1361664000,4,238,4.431818181818182
8405650,1,B003U4VGGU,"First off its in Japanese and didn't come with subtitles (at least for kindle) .  Girls get attacked by evil ninjas women who spend most of the movie beating and choking the heroes.  The action scenes are right out of 1970's scripted wrestling.  Our heroins get punched, knocked to the ground,  and kicked repeatedly (usually in the head) then get up and run away.  I suppose that getting punched and kicked for 5-10 minutes and not being hurt is easily possible since it hardly ever looked like any of the blows made contact.

This movie has no nudity, sexuality, or real plot.  Its just a long poor mock combatfest that actually makes the Power Rangers look realistic by comparison.  Save the precious minutes of your life by NEVER watching this!",1343606400,25,748,4.7
8405651,4,B003U4VGGU,"Lots of action in this movie (in fact the back of the DVD you can read that 2/3 of the movie is
nothing but fighting scenes. Even though the actresses are not very charismatic it was still fun
to watch.",1291334400,5,202,4.075
