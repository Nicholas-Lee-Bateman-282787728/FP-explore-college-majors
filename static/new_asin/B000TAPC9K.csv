For those of you who don't already know, this series is no longer in print and very hard to find whether it be the 6 disk set or the six individual volumes. I was lucky in the fact that I was able to get this vol (vol 3) for less then 20 dollars new, however I did have to pay a 100 dollars for vols 1,2,4,5,6 altogether on eBay.  I do believe you can buy the whole first season from Amazon Unbox  for 50 bucks. However I didn't want that much space on my hard drive taken up and I am the type of person that likes to have the physical version of something as apposed to the download.  I have been told this series is  a cult classic among anime fans.  Most notably for the fact that it goes from all cutesie to downright brutal at the drop of a hat. After watching this show I can safely agree. A interesting nod to that can be found on each individual volume artwork. The front has the characters pictured in what appears to be a negative exposure, making them look a bit creepy; but when you open the case the artwork features them as they would be normally drawn, all cute and innocent. Anyway my point is this, This ether a love it or hate it anime. Take your time and do  research on this anime before investing the money it will take to collect all of season 1.",1363132800,,1364,4.067164179104478
8208394,5,B000TAPC9K,If this isn't the creepiest anime you've ever seen. I stared watching this in the middle of the night because it sounded interesting and I didn't think it was going to be that scary. I watched the first episode and got chills on my arms during the end and every episode after that had the same effect it was soo scary to me that a had to keep looking behind me too if someone was there. So I had to get it on DVD and make my brothers and sisters watch it with me.,1342224000,,463,3.9361702127659575
8208395,4,B000TAPC9K,"no one else has to i thought i would. dub-wise i generally don't like dubs, and i haven't checked out the subtitles on 'when they cry' discs to see how trustworthy they are.
story-wise higurashi (when they cry) may throw people off with the arcs its goes through (8 in all) but its part of the story and gets made sense of later. one other thing to remember is that most arcs have 'sister' arcs, such as the 2nd one (ep 5) and the 5th (ep 16 i think, disc 4). this way while watching you can see the connections between different arcs such as the first one and last one of season 1.
concerning higurashi's ''main plot'' however, this dvd has the 3rd arc and so far, no real spoilers, this gives us the most clues as to what is actually going on.
unfortunately the first season only has 2 answer arcs, the second season having a carry-over episode, a anime-only arc, and the other 2 answer arcs. meaning, you have to go all the way through to understand everything.
my personal opinion is that the 2 seasons together make up one of the best animes i have ever watched. the final arc is 10 episodes on its own and explains far more than i even guessed at for the reasons for everything happening within the series. however, you have to sit through a lot of repetition (but generally your missing the small things) and a lot of episodes of ''...huh?"" but its worth it in the end.",1234569600,2,1376,4.316602316602316
