3534599,4,B001DM37U4,"Ok, honestly it's good and bad.

It's good because it contains many rare ninja films from the 60s such as Ninjitsu, Ninja Hunt and Purple Hood Ninja 1 & 2. So if you are a fan of the genre and enjoyed the Shinobi No Mano series with Raizo Ichikawa this set is for you and these films alone make it worth the purchase price.

Sadly there are also some 80s vintage Chinese ""ninja films"" which are B grade by asian standards. If you were ever able to watch Kung Fu theater you might enjoy these, but they aren't notable even for that genre. And unfortunately there is even an 80s vintage Japanese ninja film ""Cyber Ninja"" that is so bad it is pretty unwatchable.

It is a shame the collection contains some real losers. Given that we still are waiting on classics such as the original ""Castle of Owls"" and ""Ninja Spy"" their inclusion could have made this one the ultimate ninja film collection. Perhaps we will get lucky with Volume 2. So skip the last disc and enjoy the rest of the set, especially the early 60s vintage Japanese films.",1283904000,4,1034,4.403141361256544
3534600,3,B001DM37U4,"Ok, so it's 10 movies for 15.00 and all transfers look to be from video sources.  Half the transfers are full screen, with cheezy dubs.  And the 'modern' flms in this collection are pretty bad NINJA KIDS PHANTOM FORCE, GOLDEN NINJA INVASION etc..  Having said that the first four are WS transfers of classic films - - - Purple Hood Ninja 1 & 2, Ninja Hunt and 17 Ninjas are very very very watchable and important films in the genre.  With that, this is a very good collection (which would be 3/5 stars, but I guess one cannot do half stars - - - I threw my throwing star at the computer screen but could not cut that rating in half.)",1232236800,5,633,4.206611570247934

8294079,5,B001DM37U4,I wanted this for the Cyber Ninja movie but I got the added movies of the Purple Hooded Man which I saw parts of this many years ago but could not find it. I am more that happy for this buy of this movie collection. :),1425254400,,218,3.760869565217391
8294080,3,B001DM37U4,Yes ninja kids - phantom force. Loved this film as a child. A few hidden gems but a few terrible ones too.,1412294400,,106,3.8636363636363638
8294081,3,B001DM37U4,"This collection of Godfrey Ho fare may not feature the best films in martial arts cinema but Ho's has a fanbase all his own and if you're one of those fans, you're going to need this must-have collection. Leave it to VideoAsia to release rare and terrible cinema all in one amazing package, though it's up to you to decide what's truly rare and what's seriously terrible. I love many of the films in this collection and I'm a bit saddened by the fact that we've yet to see NINJA COLLECTION VOL. 2.

These films aren't so bad they're good, they're simply poorly made films, good and bad are subjective. If you love them, that's all that counts. Just to be on the safe side though don't go sharing these with your mainstream cinema fans. Highly recommended to Godfrey Ho and VideoAsia completists.",1374451200,,795,4.559440559440559
8294082,4,B001DM37U4,"I'm really enjoying this set, some great classic Kung Fu movies, and some great cheesy ones from the 80's, the quality does very from movie to movie but is generally good, I was able to get my sony 2d to 3d player to make some of the movies 3D with a very nice effect making the movies extra cool. I have many similar martial arts value type box sets and I think this is my new favorite among them.",1371513600,,398,4.050632911392405
8294083,5,B001DM37U4,very nice - promptly received it in the mail with no hassle - customer service has been great due to the fact i had to call them to thank them personally,1325116800,,153,3.967741935483871
