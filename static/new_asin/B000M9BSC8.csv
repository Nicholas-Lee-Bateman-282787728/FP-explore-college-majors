8167295,5,B000M9BSC8,"This DVD addresses both hiking and rock climbing in Joshua Tree National Park. I'm not a rock climber so can't really comment on that part, but as far as the hiking and trail information it is very good. I have visited the Park numerous times -- it is only an hour away from where I live -- but I learned a lot. I think you get a very good ""feel"" for what to expect after watching the DVD and I suspect that is also true for the climbing portion too. Anyone going to the Park will benefit from watching this DVD.",1194998400,2,512,4.079207920792079
8167296,4,B000M9BSC8,"I live in 29 palms which is right outside of the park and after reading a review of this DVD in the sunrunner magazine (go sunrunner!) I bought a copy.  I can honestly say that after living here for 22 years now I learned more from this video than all my visits to the visitor center and am using it to convince relatives to visit.  Makes me proud of my backyard!
