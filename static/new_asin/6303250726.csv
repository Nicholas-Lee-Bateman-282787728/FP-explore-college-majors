607601,4,6303250726,"This is one of the best East Side Kids films available. Before they became ""The Bowery Boys"" and after they were known as ""The Dead End Kids"", ""Little Tough Guys"" and ""Junior G-Men"", there was a slew of ""East Side Kids"" films. A lot of these films are heavy on dramatics, not so much comedy as in the later Bowery Boys films. But this film combines both extremely well. Gorcey is, of course, classic in his role of Muggs McGinnis, along with the superb Huntz Hall as Glimpy, David Gorcey, Sunshine Sammy Morrison (uncredited for some reason!), Bobby Jordan, Gabe Dell and a comic performance by legendary Hal Roach regular Billy Gilbert as an inept crook. The film quality is actually much better than others in the East Side Kids series, not many glitches at all and the film is somewhat crisper. Lotsa fun as the kids get put in reform school for a crime they didn't commit; then they attempt to find the real bad guys and get Bobby Jordan's brother off Death Row. If you're a Bowery Boys/East Side Kids fan, you'll heartily enjoy this fine forgotten film.",1009670400,9,1058,4.573684210526316

7841876,3,6303250726,"Mr. Wise Guy, 1942 film

This film opens with a view of the Brooklyn Bridge. The East Side Kids are hanging out in the street. An alarm sounds - someone has escaped from Blackwell's Island (the prison). The boys fool around with a truck, unknowingly helping an escaped convict. Bill wants his younger brother to get a job to keep him off the streets (and Reform School). But its too late, they are pinched. There is new management at Wiltwyck now. [The film reminds us how men would worry about being underweight!] Bill Collins stops for cigarettes, there is a holdup and shooting. Bill's car is hijacked by one of the robbers and he is blamed unless he can prove his innocence.

The boys are sentenced for stealing that truck, and are working in the barnyard. Danny Collins learns of his brother's tragic fate. Charley tells Mr. Barns about his suspicions, but is punished for informing. Charley has more trouble with Muggsy. While watching a newsreel they see a face they recognize, and they learn more about the Luke Manning gang. The boys escape to track down Dorothy, the girlfriend of Luke Manning. There are some funny scenes here. Of course there is a happy ending to this more serious film in the series. It tells about big city life as seen by Hollywood. Has much changed since then?",1471219200,,1293,4.641921397379913

7841880,5,6303250726,I just love the East Side Kids movies. They are earthy and funny. Their movies are a rough take on life in the city during the late 30's and early 40's. I never get tired of watching them. Miss seeing them on TV.,1400284800,,212,3.953488372093023

7841882,3,6303250726,"This is one of the Monogram cheapies that the kids so frequently did but it's not bad.  Typical of their films of the 40's, a little grittier and more dramatic and less slapstick than they would become in the 1950's.  In this one the kids are  convicted of stealing a truck and sent to the Wilton Reform school.  There they learn that Danny's brother has been sentenced to be executed for a murder he did not commit.  The Kids now have to bust out of the reform school and capture the real murderer to save bill.

As noted this early Kids film is a much crime drama as it is comedy but the comedy bits are funny and the dramatic parts done as well as any B movie of the day.  Well acted compared to many Monogram pictures and the film looks good, too.  The reform school guards are you typical uncaring fellows who don't believe anything the kids say.

Well done Kids movie.",1109289600,2,874,4.280487804878049

7841884,2,6303250726,"Now that the East Side Kids (Leo Gorcey, Bobby Jordan, Huntz Hall, Sammy Morrison) are done chasing spooks (SPOOKS RUN WILD [1941]), they get silly talking to mannequins.  Someone escapes from prison on Blackwell's Island, so the boys go to investigate at the dock on West St.  The police think the prisoner has drowned, but has not.  By stealing a truck they helped the convict.  The kids end up in reform school (again).  Danny's (Bobby Jordan) brother, Bill, is wrongfully accused of murder.  The real murderer is the same convict that got the boys in reform school.  Within two days, the kids must break-out of reform school to save the life of Danny's brother before he is executed.  Ann Doran is in this one and Bobby Stone too.  Gabriel Dell who was over with Billy Halop, Huntz Hall and Bernard Punsly helping the Little Tough Guys joins the East Side Kids films too.  The next film in the series: LET'S GET TOUGH! (1942).",1079568000,,930,4.6503067484662575
