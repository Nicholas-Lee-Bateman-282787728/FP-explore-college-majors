7076700,5,B00V4TU6QO,Outstanding.  For those who are looking for answers to the why we are at the point were are:  here is a good explanation.,1466294400,5,121,4.217391304347826
7076701,1,B00V4TU6QO,"To say that this is dry does not even begin to describe the experience of watching this ""documentary"", the narrator has some very strange pronunciations which is also quite distracting, and when you really start to listen to the assertions that they make and begin to fact check the ones that are not wild ramblings and conspiracy theory about the Catholic Church and the Jesuits you quickly see that this is a very low-information production.  I am not a theist, but this program is simply over the top to the point of being silly in the accusations levelled against the Catholic Church (which has more than enough problems with the things that we know it really has done) and the boogeyman Jesuits which appear to be the root of all problems going back to before there even were Jesuits.  This brings me to another point and that is the utter failure of the writers to do even basic fact checking, at one point they claim that President Lincoln had made claims about Henry Ford...well, since their lifetimes only overlapped by a very few years I sincerely doubt that Lincoln was talking about dear old Henry when Henry was still in diapers!  Apparently it had a budget of $20k, well, I have seen better productions come from high schoolers.

If you want to be entertained by the weirdly monotone but also distracting voice of the narrator and treated to some of the more bizarre of consipracy theories, and if you want to pin the Jesuits and the Church as the cause of all of the ills pretty much since the fall of Babylon (Ok, I am exaggerating a little there) then be my guest.  I did see someone create a drinking game out of it, which might get you through...  But definitely don't spend any money on it!",1458259200,6,1710,4.5537459283387625
7076702,5,B00V4TU6QO,"Great video, very informative. My husband loved that I bought this for his collection. Definitely recommend for anyone interested in the Illuminati, conspiracy theory, NWO, etc. I learned a lot from this.",1456704000,7,204,5.40625

8709211,1,B00V4TU6QO,This is pretty much the worst movie ever made.........yep,1528070400,,57,5.444444444444445
8709212,5,B00V4TU6QO,Best movie ever!!!,1528070400,,18,5.333333333333333
8709213,1,B00V4TU6QO,Barry? I haven't watched. Never. straight 1star. traitor!!!,1527552000,,59,6.5
8709214,1,B00V4TU6QO,"Very Badly produced, from the dead space to facts, it is good I did not have to pay for this I would want a refund. It should have a place for Zero stars.",1527120000,,154,3.696969696969697
8709215,1,B00V4TU6QO,"Lots of claims without proof. Theories and scary stories abound.
The story telling is overly dramatic and the story itself is not believable at all. It feels like the makers are trying to scare you, rather than to educate.
If you love propaganda, this may be for you. If you live in the real world, you can skip this.",1527033600,,317,4.389830508474576
8709216,1,B00V4TU6QO,"There ought to be LAR against writing such a dis-jointed script. I had no IDEAR anyone could be so dull and monotonous and still be employed as a narrator. The producers of this crp should send me money for wasting my time, with punitive damages for knowingly inflicting torture on my psyche ... I think my id might be hurt too. I gave it one star (I hate it) only because there are no negative stars ( I really reeeeeeally hated it). I'd rather eat spam than watch this again. And I don't like spam.",1525737600,3,500,4.273684210526316
8709217,1,B00V4TU6QO,PEOPLE BEWARE! THIS WAS THE MOST BORING VIDEO!!!!! WHAT A WASTE OF TIME EVEN THOUGH I ONLY MADE IT THROUGH 10 MINUTES!,1522454400,2,118,4.409090909090909
8709218,1,B00V4TU6QO,Dont waste your time. This is just a boring monotone narrator speaking over stock images and video clips. Spoiler alert: they blame it all on the jesuits and say the church started the whole thing.,1516665600,6,197,4.6571428571428575
