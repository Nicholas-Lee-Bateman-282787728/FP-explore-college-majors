7951393,5,B00005QZ7M,"The fifth volume of Nadia and Jean's adventure reveals more and more wonders particularly the last two episodes reminds me of similar scenes of Star Blazers which Hideaki Anno had been crazy about when it was aired during 1970s. Captain Nemo takes the Nautilus crew and Jean and Nadia to the full-of-wonder Antarctica base and introduces teen pairs to Nemo's cetacean friend which can talk human language. The grand hollow underneath the Antactica continent is no doubt taken from THE JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH, well known Jules Verne novel and for the Star Blazers fan the hollow world of Gamilus planet...Also Nautilus vs Nautilus episode is taken from 20,000 leagues under the sea.

Verdict: If you can tolerate some of borrowed settings Japanese anime fans (and Jules Verne fans)know well, it is exciting and intriguing.
Rating: 90 out of 100 Aye for Cetacean friends and charming domesticated penguins.
Recommended for: Fans of Japanese animation.",1187308800,,961,5.1210191082802545

Although the content here concentrates more on character development rather than advancing the plot, the entertainment value the first four volumes remains intact.

 The first episode, ""Jean's New Invention"" may seem like a slow-going sidebreak in the story, but, unlike the dreadful filler episodes which plagued the show much later on, this one is effectively told, funny, and moving. We get to see more of the character's relationships unfold, particularly that of Nadia's with Jean. Nadia clearly cares very deeply about him, even if she doesn't know how to admit it (to herself or him); it is she who suggests Jean to build an aircraft (partially to bring him out of feeling upset about the events that made him miserable in the last volume), and, after scolding him for missing dinner (he had been working on the aircraft for her), she feels guilty and decides to bring him something to eat (a dish of seaweed, which Jean accepts... what a sweet boy he is!). And Jean, always cheerful yet trying to deal with a problem about whether to be a little more ""grown-up"" or seek advice from people he can trust, always has the answers to his dilemmas, thanks to some serious brain power and self-evaluation. He is the sort of boy ANYBODY would want as a best friend, and yes, a love interest. The episode ends with a touching airborne trip where a now confident Jean takes Nadia on his newly completed gyrocopter into the skies, and makes it clear that he will do everything in his power to take her to Africa... much to her delight.

 The next two episodes are the highlight of the fifth DVD: a trip to Captain Nemo's secluded base in Antarctica. Here, the animators let their imaginations run wild. In the first of the Antarctica episodes, the Nautilus journeys to its destination, traveling through underwater icebergs and volcanoes, and, later on, going up against an aggressive Nautilus shellfish! (Hence the episode's appropriate title, ""Nautilus vs. Nautilus"".) In the second episode we're treated to more entertaining character interactions, but also on a spellbinding tour of the base. There are wonders to behold, including an ice chamber full of penguins, a breathtaking Aurora in the dark, icy heavens, and a museum of frozen prehistoric beasts which Nemo describes as ""Homodinasonics... Saurians."" The highest point of the trip is when Nadia is taken to meet Nemo's closest friend, an ancient (read: 20,000 years old!) whale whom she finds fascinating to talk to. She not only learns, from him, about humanity as a race, but an important clue which will become vital later on. This sequence rivals that of the Atlantis trip in the previous volume in terms of its striking visuals, imaginative marvels, and interesting twists on Biblical stories on the world's creation. It is moments like this which is what makes NADIA: THE SECRET OF BLUE WATER such a fun show when it's on target.

 If there's anything unsatisfying about the fifth entry, it may probably be the last episode. Is it terrible? No, it actually sets up the next two episodes which will eventually close the Nautilus arc, and it's nice to see Nadia overcoming her jealousy of Jean's friendship with Electra, especially when she has a conversation with the latter in a bath where she not only learns more about the Nautilus but also that she [Electra] considers Jean the equivalent of a brother she lost years ago. The problem is that it stops much too soon, ending at a buildup with no resolution and more cliffhanging, which is not terrible, but it does produce an effect that is good and bad. Good, because we get to see an even better two episodes on the next volume, but bad because it feels like an abrupt ending to such a fun volume. Plus, the fact that after these next two episodes on Volume 6 the show goes downhill, it does leave one feeling a bit cold and cheated.

 Due to these above faults, the fifth entry of NADIA: THE SECRET OF BLUE WATER is probably THE last volume of greatness to expect from the show until the closing episodes. So enjoy this addition all you can, folks, because it'll be disappointing to discover that the remainder of the show, save the finale, doesn't match up to what came before it.",1015977600,2,4401,4.766404199475065
