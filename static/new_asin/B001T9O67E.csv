8340850,1,B001T9O67E,"The title attracted me ,7 seconds defense system sounds fast ,strong and professionnal.
Then I played it ...You see "" the grand master"" with a wooden stick ,held on his fingers with a rubber band .Showing ""techniques"" to very young kids or women.
Just a strike technique or two, no combinations of deadly attacks or moves.
I just feel I got the wrong dvd in the right box.
Nothing impressive or unique, I just lost almost 25 usd in less than 7 seconds.
Such kind of useless dvd's should be prohibited for sale, just a complete rip off.",1313625600,4,535,4.469387755102041
