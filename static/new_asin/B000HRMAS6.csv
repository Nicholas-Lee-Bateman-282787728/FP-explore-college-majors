2640232,5,B000HRMAS6,I love these a&e/history DVD releases. They are always well produced and full of information. This one is no exception. For anyone interested in 9/11 this is a good buy.,1311379200,,169,4.666666666666667
2640233,5,B000HRMAS6,"""The 9/11 Commission Report"" is a low-key docudrama that treats its subject matter with respect.  It raises many questions while entertaining the viewer.  It has no explosions, no car chases, no massive battle scenes, no spectacle.  Standard Hollywood cliches are limited to the following: one couple gets together, interrogations get messy, and a gunfight gets bloody.  Beyond that, a lot of tension builds and interpersonal/interdepartmental conflicts occur.

As a movie, it has the impossible job of compressing a large number of weeks and characters into an entertaining movie.  I believe that it works.  The script moves quickly, the locations look perfect, and the actors rise to the occasion.

As a docudrama, it can not be taken as fact.  It selects certain real-life elements; for example, some of the dialogue (interrogation records) is based on that.  And then the movie makes up everything else.  But it still feels real and raises many questions.

The movie follows different characters through the events leading up to the September 11, 2001 attacks.  As a docudrama, it can not be taken as fact.  However, it does show all of the characters (US government officials, CIA operatives, FBI agents, and terrorists) as realistic characters who believe in their respective missions and callings.  Who is right? Who is wrong? The viewer will see what he wants to see in this movie.  Five stars for providing a movie that deals with the real world.",1284768000,5,1455,5.101694915254237
2640234,3,B000HRMAS6,Whether you read or didn't read the 9/11 Commission report this movie is a interesting watch. The movie is either a supplement to book and all it's details or a good summary of what the commission found. What lead to the events of 9/11 need to be understood and remembered. Already America is beginning to forget and this movie can act to renew those memories and make us realize how much 9/11 impacted our lives.,1257033600,,413,4.52
2640235,1,B000HRMAS6,"Having seen The Path to 9/11 with Harvey Keitel last year, I was hoping this would be a great dramatization along those lines.  What I found was a complete and total waste of my time.  I don't know the ins and outs of how ideas and scripts turn into movies but the fact that this actually was made, with actors, cameras and all is a pathetic testament of taste.  The acting was atrocious, the plot was a joke and...  I don't even know.  Trust me - you'll have more fun holding a lit match between your fingers until your skin blisters.  At least you'll feel something.",1184716800,2,568,4.311320754716981
2640236,1,B000HRMAS6,"Follows a couple of Arab ""terrorists"" as they take flight lessons and are investigated by an FBI agent. Does not address the fact that this was the cover story for the inside job of 9/11. Also has nothing about the 9/11 Commission Report itself and it's errors, omissions, and lies.",1170979200,7,282,4.66
8140895,4,B000HRMAS6,"This provides a chronicle of events of the day and distribute blame for those that it is felt should be held responsible for the faults that led to what occurred. Provides back story to how it was accomplished including original plans. They took practice runs an it was determined it cost about $500,000 to accomplish the goals. Finger pointing, survivor stories. Insightful and sad due to sickening situations.",1484438400,,411,5.0588235294117645
8140896,1,B000HRMAS6,"I watched this because I like to hear all the angles. I'm sorry, but the entire 9/11 Commission Report is full if lies, half truths, and ommissions. They didn't even discuss WTC 7, and complete removed Norman Minetta's testimony from the record. Lets not get into the fact that four planes flew wildly off course fo 90 minutes over the most heavily guarded airspace on the planet without a single one being intercepted by an F-15. Let's not even get into the fact that all 4 airplanes flew faster than allowable operating speed that day. Let's also not get into the fact that Bin Laden denied involvement, and to THIS VERY DAY, the FBI Wanted page for him still doesn't list 9/11 as a reason for his being wanted.
""On June 5, 2006, the Muckraker Report contacted the FBI Headquarters, (202) 324-3000, to learn why Bin Ladens Most Wanted poster did not indicate that Usama was also wanted in connection with 9/11. The Muckraker Report spoke with Rex Tomb, Chief of Investigative Publicity for the FBI. When asked why there is no mention of 9/11 on Bin Ladens Most Wanted web page, Tomb said, The reason why 9/11 is not mentioned on Usama Bin Ladens Most Wanted page is because the FBI has no hard evidence connecting Bin Laden to 9/11.

Conspiracy only means, ""to conspire"". Our government has turned it into a bad word. It is obvious why.  I'm highly educated, and have a series of letters after my name. When there are thousands of engineers, architects, and former combat and commercial airline pilots who can point out hundreds of impossibilities that day, I have no problem dismissing the entire ""Commission"". A movie about this farce was not needed.",1459987200,,1654,4.7
8140897,5,B000HRMAS6,I first watched this on Netflix and loved it. It details the happenings leading to 9/11.,1441584000,,88,4.5625
8140898,5,B000HRMAS6,Good video on what really happened that historic day.,1420243200,,53,5.0
8140899,5,B000HRMAS6,"Full of detail! Loved this documentary. PBS has a documentary called Bush's War, and HBO has a movie on the Hussein family. Add these together with this, it's  a good look at some powerful men, and a good look at history. Get these and enjoy. Mind Blowing!",1381104000,2,256,4.446808510638298
8140900,5,B000HRMAS6,I have read the 9/11 Commission Report. This was like watching its summary. Well made. Covered the most key points.,1360972800,,115,4.8
8140901,5,B000HRMAS6,"It's unpolished cinematography, it's amateur actors and it's mediocre script still doesn't crush the fact that they did convey facts within the report. I only gave it 5 stars for that reason.",1358726400,,191,5.0
8140902,1,B000HRMAS6,I too found it difficult to watch the complete movie because it was so poorly made. After about 30 minutes I gave up.,1331078400,,117,4.130434782608695
8140903,1,B000HRMAS6,"I'll keep this review short; but I picked this Blu-Ray up at Fry's Electronics, because I saw it was in the bargain section for only $5.99. I figured a Blu-Ray for $6 was a great deal, and I happen to be interested in 9/11-related movies & documentaries, plus the quote on the front compared it to 'United 93', which was a great movie. So I was sold.

While watching the movie, it started to become apparent that the story predictable writing with corny dialogue. I don't know if it was ""predictable"" to me given that I had already read the 9/11 Commission Report, but I doubt it. But a lot of the dialogue was just silly.

Someone else here said it was ""atrocious"" acting - and while it may seem like that at first, I'm also aware that poor production & direction can make otherwise good actors look bad. I thought some of the actors were good, and that the bad elements of the movie overall was a mix of bad writing, directing, and bad acting.

The movie was all over the place, jumping scene to scene, and it just wasn't very interesting. I wanted to give it 2 stars as I was trying to find some redeeming quality of the film, but I just couldn't.",1322524800,2,1150,4.314814814814815
8140904,5,B000HRMAS6,"The product itself was great and service was perfect, good to know that something's good in this economic bad times",1313020800,,115,4.8
