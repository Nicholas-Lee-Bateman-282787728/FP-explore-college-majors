1084457,2,6305855986,"NOTHIN' 2 LOSE is a mildly diverting romantic comedy about a woman, who gives her boyfriend of two years a thirty day window to get married or else.  Initially, the thirty day timeframe gives the story a nice deadline, but soon thereafter the story gets off track and never quite gets back on course.  One reason for this is that Kwame, the boyfriend (played by Brian Hooks) appears so casual about the ultimatum in the beginning that you never feel the threat.  Yasmine (Shani Bayet) has a reasonable position as the girlfriend that is losing her patience, but some later actions by the character, make her seem somewhat fickle.  Without revealing too much about the plot, it's not clear why Yasmine puts up with Kwame and the other men in her life.  In terms of the performances, most are fairly broad, silly and underdeveloped.  Newcomer Shani Bayet, who looks like a petite Tyra Banks has her appealing moments in the film.  You clearly empathize with her character's situation.  However, like most of the cast her performance lacks subtlety, even for a comedy. The most believeable charcter in the film is Kwame's Mom (Kweli), she's the only one that sounds like a real person and not a fictional character.  Among the recent crop of wedding films with predominantly African American casts, this film ranks a distant third behind Malcolm Lee's BEST MAN and Rick Famuyiwa's THE WOOD, but this doesn't mean that the film is devoid of entertainment value.  With an energetic and attractive cast, the film definitely has it's appeal and if you like your comedy broad, you might even find the film worthy of a second viewing.  However, for those who like more subtle forms of comedy, they may feel that their time could have been better spent elsewhere.",974332800,8,1753,4.81

1084502,1,6305855986,"The movie is a rated R movie and they edited the words by muting out any vulgar language which is in most of the movie. The description never stated that and now that I watched it, any sound within seconds of a curse word or sexual phrase can not be heard. It's like watching a scratched dvd or listening to a scratched cd",1379808000,,322,4.126984126984127

1084506,4,6305855986,Hilarious blend of bad acting and funny characters. Favorite scenes were the onces that featured the Uncle. Worth it if you're not too picky about script quality and can laugh on the stupid little things that happen in movies.,1251849600,,226,4.82051282051282

1084509,5,6305855986,To me the cast was perfect. The whole movie is worth watching at least three times. Brian Hooks is a comedian on the rise. All he needs is a big role in a box office movie or give him his own TV show. For those of you who didn't like it watch it again but be very open minded when you watch it. Only because when you watch it you won't see the expected results.,1098403200,2,361,3.8266666666666667
