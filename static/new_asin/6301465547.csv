7812371,1,6301465547,"Though ""Barnyard Actor"" is listed on the box, it's nowhere to be found on the actual tape. Very disappointing, as that short is the only reason I bought this.",1324684800,,158,4.482758620689655
7812372,4,6301465547,"Originally released in the 40s theatrically. These classic cartoons made it to television in the 50/60s and then to Home Video in the late 80s. Hard to say where they'll show next, but for now this was the latest release. On this tape is: ""Mexican baseball"", ""Barnyard Actor"", ""Doomsday"", ""Hook Line and Sinker"" and ""The Home Guard""

With Disney cartoons really taking off by this time, there were many, many ""similar"" characters. This is one of them.",1209340800,,451,4.857142857142857
