6876714,5,B00QMV2TBO,"It would be impossible for a filmmaker to condense ""what really happened"" to any political prisoner into a movie. Most ""inspired by real events"" movies of this nature are brought to the public awareness in documentary format because articulating a dramatic pace that keeps the audience engaged is tough. (Because in the land of ""selling a feature film to the film market"" suddenly your true story has to compete for sales next to fiction narratives where they have no limits.) In my opinion, THAT is the most impressive thing Jon Stewart managed to pull off with this story.  I gave the movie 5 Stars because of the dramatic pacing of the story, the believability of the cast...

...in under 2 hours I caught a small fictionalized glimpse of the madness of what really happen to Maziar Bahari that I could feel, like a roller coaster that pretends to go off a cliff but eventually delivers me safely back to the starting point, this story has the right amount of impact. Stewart really pays homage to this incident by writing and directing this movie personally instead of hiring ""seasoned storytellers"" to make the movie, that took more courage than most people can possibly imagine.",1423526400,6,1184,4.827586206896552

6876716,4,B00QMV2TBO,"Theatrical review.  For those who have watched Jon Stewart, primarily on ""The Daily Show,"" for many years, you won't be surprised that his talent for satirical observation aren't just limited to television.  His show, it should be noted, played a role in the political developments that brought Maziar Bahari to be imprisoned in his native Iran.  Bahari's book ""Then They Came for Me: A Family's Story of Love, Captivity, and Survival,"" is the basis for Stewart's screenplay.

Bahari who holds dual citizenship in Canada, is played by Mexican actor Gael Garcia Bernal (""The Motorcycle Diaries""), and is sent to Iran by ""Newsweek"" magazine to report on the 2009 presidential election and the populist political uprising that is fermenting in that country.  While he is there, he is interviewed by Jason Jones, a mock journalist from ""The Daily Show.""  The satirical piece, in which Jones claims to be a spy, catches the attention of the Iranian regime.

Bahari, who had been staying with his mother (Shohreh Aghdashloo, ""Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters"") is summarily rousted from bed and taken to prison where he is blindfolded and placed in solitary confinement.  He is routinely and regularly interrogated by a man he calls Rosewater (Danish actor, Kim Bodnia), because of a cologne he wears.  As Bahari undergoes the bleak loneliness of his existence, he questions his ability to withstand the pressure to admit that he is spying for the U. S. government.  He foments memories of his father and sister, both of whom died in prison for their political activism.

Stewart seems to make several points.  One being that torture goes beyond physical abuse.  Bahari is never seriously beaten, although the threat is always present.  His torture is the lack of sensory activities that we all take for granted.  Even his vision is taken away by the constant wearing of the blindfold.  Stewart isn't totally without humor however.  For example, the ghost of his father suggest that Rosewater is an ignorant man.  Use that against him.  When the interrogator suggests that Bahari became a spy when he visited New Jersey, it is cause for a chuckle.  Bahari goes with it and explains that it is a tempting place and goes into a story about getting a message with 3 women.  As he slips out morsels of detail, we see Rosewater begin to salivate and ask for more.

Stewart shot most of the film on location in Jordan but did manage to slip a film crew into Iran for other shots.  The film is well crafted, nicely acted and beautifully photographed.  Stewart gets high praise for his first adventure behind the camera.",1422835200,33,2604,4.892694063926941
6876717,4,B00QMV2TBO,"This is a case where Art imitates Life. During a 2009 comic sketch on the Daily Show with Jon Stewart, London-based journalist Maziar Bahari was interviewed by Jason Jones. As part of the gag, Bahari called Iran's president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ""an idiot"" but Iran didn't get the joke. When Newsweek sent him to Tehran to cover the presidential election, he was arrested and placed in solitary confinement for 118 days where he was subjected to brutal interrogations. He was suspected of attempting to overthrow the Iranian government.

After he was released, he was interviewed by Jon Stewart because the show had inadvertently caused his imprisonment. They became friends and Stewart makes his screen-writing and directorial debut with this R-rated film based on the book, ""Then They Came for Me,"" co-written by Bahari and Aimee Molloy.

The cast:

* Gael Garcia Bernal (""Casa de mi Padre"") plays Maziar Bahari, astonished by the misunderstanding and unable to explain that neither Italian movies nor the American TV series The Sopranos are pornography. When his jailers declare that Jon Stewart is a spy, he asks, ""Why would a spy have a TV show?""
* Shohreh Aghdashloo (""Grimm"") is his mother Moloojoon, who has already lost a husband and a daughter to zealotry. The police are offended because she isn't wearing a head scarf in her own home.
* Haluk Bilginer (""The Reluctant Fundamentalist"") Maziar's deceased father Baba Akbar only appears to him in solitary.
* Kim Bodnia (""The Bridge"") is Rosewater, Maziar's interrogator. We are relieved when our prisoner, to retain his own sanity, starts to create elaborate tales of mythical trips to licentious ""New Jersey"" for pornographic massages. These ""confessions"" are irresistible to his tormentor. Our screening audience giggled with glee.

His interrogators are fascinated as they watch him dance to imaginary music while alone in his cell. Of course they are furious when Bahari's girlfriend starts a world-wide media blitz about his illegal confinement. As we know, this ultimately succeeds.

We see beatings and mental torture, but are not subjected to scenes of waterboarding, etc, which have become standard for movies of this ilk. Whew! This is an interesting and dare I say it, entertaining film.",1419724800,25,2256,5.186813186813187
6876718,4,B00QMV2TBO,"""Rosewater"" (2014 release; 103 min.) brings the true story of Iranian-born journalist Maziar Bahari. As the movie opens, it is ""June 21, 2009"", when we see Iranian police arrest Bahari at his mother's house in Tehran. We then go back to June 9, 2009, a few days before the presidential elections in Iran. Bahari is making final preparations in the UK for his trip to Iran, and we learn that his wife is pregnant. To tell you much more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for your self how it all plays out.

Several comments: first, much of the movie's claim to fame comes from the fact that this is written and directed by Jon Stewart, host of The Daily Show. Stewart's script is based on Bahari's memoir ""Then They Came For Me"". Second, the movie is divided up into 2 halves: in the first half we see what transpires in the days before and after the elections, and the second half brings the imprisonment of Bahari. I must admit I enjoyed the first half more, not because the second half is ""bad"", but because Stewart pulls no punches on the emotional and psychological torture which Bahari must endure. In a pivotal scene, the Iranian interrogator gets chewed out by his superior, who tells him that to succeed, ""you must take his hope"". Some scenes are simply very tough to watch. Stewart uses quite a bit of archive footage in the first half of the movie. Third, the infamous scene from The Daily Show in which Bahari is mock-interviewed by an American ""spy"", is played up in the movie, to great effect (the Iranian interrogator/torturer asks: ""why did you interview the American spy?"", to which Bahari responds: ""if he was really a spy, why would he have his own TV show?"", ha!). There are several other lighter moments which benefit the movie greatly. At one point Bahari obtains an interview with an Iranian spokesman by offering chocolates. ""Allah is no match for chocolates"", Bahari tells his co-workers, ha! Last but not least, there is a nice orchestral soundtrack, composed by veteran Howard Shore.

The movie opened on all of 2 screens for all of Greater Cincinnati last month. I had been looking forward to this, and went to see it right away. The early evening screening I saw this at was not particularly well attended, but this doesn't surprise me. This is not particularly a feel-good movie, and not for a broad audience. If on the other hand you are interested in this topic, I would readily recommend that you check out this movie, be in the theater, or later on Amazon Instant Video or on DVD/Blu-ray. ""Rosewater"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1417996800,22,2583,4.674725274725275
6876719,4,B00QMV2TBO,"Returning to his homeland to cover the controversial presidential elections five years ago, Iranian Canadian journalist Maziar Bahari (Gael Garca Bernal) pointed his camera in the wrong direction, capturing images of the government responding to Green Movement protestors with undue violence.  One morning shortly thereafter, secret police came to his mother's (Shohreh Aghdashloo) home and placed him in custody, spiriting him to a solitary-confinement cell in a Tehran prison.  Over 100 torturous days later, after any number of beatings, death threats, absurd lines of questioning, and coaxed statements, he was released, his ordeal having received international media notice.

In his directorial debut, iconic political satirist and Daily Show host Jon Stewart tells Bahari's story with earnest vigor and a certain degree of sentimentality.  It is almost two films in one.  For around 45 minutes, it plays as a blow-by-blow, on-the-ground depiction of the 2009 election and the fallout after Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's suspicious landslide victory.  Then it transforms into a Kafkaesque nightmare of grey spaces, soul-crushing prison routines, bureaucratic torture, and out-of-left-field questions and declarations (for example, a Sopranos DVD found in Bahari's room is labeled illegal pornography).  In the second half, Stewart could honestly do more to intensify the claustrophobia and torment (mental and physical) experienced by Bahari.  He is clearly hesitant to push too far in the degradation-and-filth-and-tears direction exemplified by a hard-edged film such as Steve McQueen's Hunger, focusing instead on ways to open a very tightly focused storyline to the air, including imaginary conversations with Bahari's father and sister, both held as political prisoners themselves in the past.

People have criticized the casting of a Mexican actor to play an Iranian, and they may or may not have a point, but this cannot be denied:  Garca Bernal is an intuitive and sharp talent, and he delivers a very fine performance here, his almost nerdy enthusiasm on the outside giving way to convincing anguish and then poignant transcendence inside the prison.  Also superb is Kim Bodnia as ""Rosewater,"" Bahari's primary (and anonymous) torturer, so named because of the overt perfume announcing his dangerous presence to blindfolded captives.  Bodnia portrays him as a volatile brute of a man with a slight tendency toward sad-eyed introspection, as if he partly understands his actions are cruel and wrong, but cannot find the courage to step outside his circumscribed existence and is therefore almost as condemned as the men he hits, questions, and dehumanizes.",1417910400,6,2661,5.592039800995025

They did good at cutting out scenes they didn't find contributed to the overall story. This movie also contains probably the best prison scene I've ever seen as you don't usually get to watch an imprisoned person dance to almost a whole song in an incredibly tiny cell- and the actor, Gael Garcia Bernal, was amazing at selling that scene and even all the small moments throughout the film.  It was incredible and I'd highly, HIGHLY recommend this film. All the cast is on point with their acting, the story is immersive and, at times, when you think the captors are sounding ridiculous they drop a bomb and you realize, ""Wow, sh*t just got real.""

6876752,5,B00QMV2TBO,"ROSEWATER (2014), directed by Jon Stewart, who also wrote the screenplay with some assistance from J. J. Abrams, is an uplifting fact-based movie based on Maziar Baharis memoir THEN THEY CAME FOR ME (2011).  Bahari, an Iranian-born journalist, was arrested in Iran on June 21, 2009, kept in solitary confinement and tortured for nearly four months, and finally released on Oct. 17, 2009.

The two main actorsGael Garcia, who plays Bahari, and Kim Bodnia, who plays his huge, burly torturerare both excellent, and the rest of the cast is consistently good. The name for this film comes from a sweet-smelling scent that people can put on themselves; specifically, it was the ironic nickname that Bahari mentally gave the man whose job was to torture a false confession out of him.

Much of the film focuses on how Bahari coped with his horrible situation. Towards the end, as he successfully distracts his torturer with tangential remarks about sexual practices outside Iran, the mood of the film lightens considerably. The highlight, of course, is Baharis release from custody, tempered by his knowledgeand the audiencesthat hundreds of less lucky prisoners remain in the prison with no realistic hopes for their own releases.

In my judgment, this is a very important film that deals with a hugely important topic for Americans as well as other peoples around the world. I only found fault with three quite minor points: the title ROSEWATER seems too tangential and obscure for such weighty material; the length of time/passage of time in prison seemed unclear within the film; and I thought the main reason for Baharis arrest was somewhat obscured by this film (in real life, he was arrested for videotaping public protests following the 2009 elections in Iran; the film, however, gives more attention to a videotaped interview with Bahari by Jason Jones, a comedian-correspondent for THE DAILY SHOW, during which Jones joked about being a spy). Despite these points, I believe ROSEWATER deserves an A or Five-Star rating.

Why is this film so important? For one thing, many thousands of political prisoners are still being held unjustly without any trials, and many are still being tortured and even murdered in their cellsnot just by various dictators around the world but by Americans, authorized by our own politicians. For another, a substantial segment of our Congress (probably over half) and a substantial number of American voters (probably over one third, and growing) thoroughly approve of such practices and wish them to continue. ROSEWATER, in a significant way, provides information and images that argue for alternative views and practices.",1451347200,,2656,5.167441860465116

Rose Water did not do well in the theaters and was not praised by Hollywood critics--which I suppose are the last two things one should use to make judgement upon a film like this.  I really enjoyed it.  I enjoyed the cinematic choices Stewart made.  Garcia Bernal continues to fly under the radar as an actor; he was--always is--superb.  I delayed watching this because Jon Stewart is so critical of himself and often speaks negatively about his abilities.  Perhaps Mr. Stewart's talents are not in acting, but he most certainly has phenomenal abilities when it comes to telling and directing a story.  I loved the peaks into Mr. Bahari's life before his imprisonment and as they were used to tell the larger history of Iran.  Way to go Mr. Stewart!

The resulting interrogations weren't interesting to me as filmed entertainment. The interrogator's insistence that such and such item was pornography made him come across as simple in my opinion, when he wasn't simple at all. I would've preferred a more cinematically frightening villain. It's hard to fear villains who don't know the difference between pornography, music and magazine articles. I believe this gentleman was terrorized and interrogated and I respect the filmmakers desire to film it the way he saw fit, but I would've preferred a more frightening and intelligent villain, or at least, a more relatable one. Also, the filmmakers or storyteller's insistence that those in power would not win is not convincing. In my experience those in power usually win, even if it is merely killing the opposition, the opposition usually feels the pushback. I'm living it. I think the filmmaker should've re-thought his presentation of the villains but I'm glad he made the film. It's easy to call out villains of governments unfriendly to the U.S. How about calling out some of our own villains. I've been targeted/harassed by anti-terrorist agencies/combined with police for years, and complained to State and Justice Dept., not a thing has been done. The thing about calling out wrongdoing, it's easy to point the finger at the other, and way more difficult to call out our own. But it's our own who are the most powerful in the history of the world. Our security agencies out of control would negatively impact the world, and I suspect are doing so, going by my life as an indicator. I'm very happy this gentleman survived and got to go home to his wife and be with his family. That was a happy ending where cases like this don't always have happy endings. It takes bravery to stand up to people, bravery, and an understanding of your species. Best not to expect that things will end well, but you must try anyway. It is on the backs of sometimes millions of failures that future citizens may benefit.

He travelled to Iran to cover the elections of 2009; the results were wildly contested by the public and international media  seeing them as rigged. Bahari covered the subsequent rioting and the lethal clamp down by the Iranian forces and got the news out; this is a country where the State controls all aspects of life including access to satellite programmes, books and news. For that he was arrested and tortured; this is his story.

This film was made by Jon Stewart who interviewed Bahari for a spoof he did on his show. That footage was used to try to prove Bahari was a spy for the corrupt West. Gael Garcia Bernal stars as Bahari and as always puts in a superb performance  he is one of my favourite actors so I am a bit biased.

6876768,5,B00QMV2TBO,"This is an excellent film that does a great job of highlighting the futility of tyranny and benefit of exposing it's weakness. We're  routinely put into fear mode here in the USA but here we see a nation that endures tyranny while still embracing hope by loving their humanity. I find it odd that while we live in fear while those in Iran have passed that and live in hope.
The one take away from this is not that everything is fine and just dandy in Iran. It's that there is the government and there are the people who endure it. While this journalist's torture sessions will not seen as extreme, by far the worst thing he endures is the solitude, broken only by the sessions with the man hired to break him. It's not that he yearns for those sessions but we do see how things start to turn, to change as impatience rises and frustration with getting what they want yields nothing at all.
The end may seem anticlimactic but it is exactly the point that the happy ending we're looking for are manufactured myths. Getting what we finally want is not met with a crescendo of music and a mob embracing you. I also like the consideration that once freed his happiness is still tempered by all those still imprisoned.
Jon Stewart did and incredible job here, working with great actors who know how to deliver without making it look like they did anything but be themselves. The sound and film editing are solid. The story is not a revelation which IS the revelation. It left me moved but not shaken. It left me sad but also hopeful and appreciative of what it might feel like to live as Iranians do, cautious, weary, wary but still humane, still finding a reason to get up in the morning. After the events resulting from the 2009 elections (I saw the footage back then and it weighed me down, made me wonder how and why the people of Iran endure what they have) I'm glad to be here in the USA but also wishing we appreciated what people like the Iranians do and still move on with their lives.",1443398400,,1988,4.387533875338754

6876778,4,B00QMV2TBO,"Since Jon Stewart vacated his post as longtime host of The Daily Show earlier this year, the internet has been rampant with articles speculating the famed comedian's next career move. Regardless of your political affiliations, it is safe to say that Stewart's presence is missed amongst the varying voices in the American political discourse. While only Stewart knows for sure what his next move will be, his directorial and screenwriting debut Rosewater may offer one plausible explanation.

The film chronicles the story of Iranian-Canadian journalist Maziar Bahari as he is imprisoned in Iran for his coverage of the country's presidential election. The 2009 election resulted in outrage as reigning president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad won a landslide victory over his independent reformist challenger Mir-Hossein Mousavi. Domestic protests soon erupted as many citizens felt that the election results were fraudulent. The government swiftly went into action, banning any media, public demonstrations, or other forms of resistance from being proclaimed.

Maziar Bahari was covering these protests when he witnessed government violence against the peaceful demonstrators. Despite being warned by local contacts against filming any government reactions, Bahari's journalistic instincts moved him to capture the outrageous event. As it did with so many other reporters, the Iranian government soon intervened and imprisoned Bahari. For 115 days, the journalist endured merciless interrogations for simply reporting on the truth.

Jon Stewart trades in his comedic sensibilities for this bare-knuckle look at journalistic injustice. Based upon Bahari's own book about his experiences during his incarceration, Rosewater paints a bleak picture of Iran's treatment of visiting journalists and its corrupt political system. Bahari's story shows the lengths that the country was willing to go to in order to maintain the propaganda of a compassionate and beloved leader. From a political standpoint, Stewart does an excellent job in creating outrage at Bahari's unjustified treatment. Unfortunately, brief glimpses at Bahari's pregnant wife who is waiting desperately for her husband to return to their London home, do little to humanize the situation. This denies the film of ever truly connecting on an emotional level. It ends up coming off as a well-informed but slightly cold news feature. Still, Stewart's penchant for revealing political commentary is well served in this medium and makes Rosewater an important achievement in what hopefully becomes a fruitful filmmaking career.",1441670400,2,2575,5.7356020942408374

6876781,5,B00QMV2TBO,As a huge Jon Stewart fan I was nervous that this wouldn't live up to my expectations. I could not have been more wrong. This movie was awesome.

6876782,5,B00QMV2TBO,"I knew in advance that, for me, this would be a five-star film, and it was.  I had read Bahari's book and had been a ""Daily Show"" fan from its beginning.

I expected an interesting and difficult story requiring patience by the viewer.  Another viewer has suggested that the interrogation scenes should have been broken up to make the story more entertaining.  I do not agree.  The grim monotony and hopelessness of the interrogation scenes were the reality, a major point of the story.  I did not want the reality chopped up to make it more entertaining.  On the other hand, I respect the desire of people who need entertainment more than reality; for them I would give the film fewer than five stars by way of cautioning them that they need patience for this movie.

I enjoyed the foreign scenes and the background music.  I wish that it might all have been Iranian, but part of the filming was in Jordon and the music was composed for this movie.  The music was intended to sound Iranian, however, and it was beautiful.

Subtitles are almost a necessity in my opinion, because the Iranian actors speak English with a considerable accent.  Others here have praised the actor Gael Garcia Bernal, and I certainly agree.",1441497600,2,1218,4.666666666666667

I was assuming we'd see a closing scene with an actual clip from The Daily Show with Jon Stewart ranting about the injustice of the reporter's detainment (since not, why then the Jason Jones interview reenactment?)  I believe Stewart is the type who can understand and respect the Iranian perspective better than 99.9% of Americans, so why didn't he show more of that? We've already seen enough movies and media talking heads who give Iran a bad rep. Perhaps it was a tip of the hat to the real-life journalist whose ordeal he felt somewhat responsible for.

6876798,5,B00QMV2TBO,"This is one of those frequently overlooked, underrated gems that most reviewers (viewers?), hardened on phony virtually-concocted violence, predictable Tom Cruise special effects jock-shock and over-the-top gore, will miss the elegant, heartfelt intimacy of what fear and torture must really be like as experienced on a human level.  The straightforward honesty and linearity of journeying with a non-superhero soul trying to understand and survive the brutality of mindless religious state intolerance isn't going to dazzle you with nightmare ISIS images and costumed evil.  Like the Eichmann trial in Israel many years ago, this film underscores the routine banality of evil and those who practice it. Therein lies its power:  ""normal"" everymen show courage, perseverance  and hope; thuggish zealots feel fear, uncertainty, guilt and even empathy (?).  It's subtle; it's complex; the outcome is unknown.  It is not a ""roll out the monster laser tanks and invincible robots"" with victorious orchestral trumpets blaring to a victory crescendo that you know is inevitable.  There is one amazing image (among many others) that sticks in my mind particularly: Bernal sees an image of Hillary Clinton on TV discussing his predicament, and suddenly his mind is flooded with a stream of newspaper headlines, faces of TV anchors, news magazine covers, etc. as he realizes that, contrary to what he has been repeatedly told by his interrogators, the world has NOT forgotten or abandoned him, his wife has NOT moved on and the injustice IS being confronted.  Stewart is very adept at portraying the slow, painful evolution of life (or perhaps impending death) by employing such quotidian events.  That's how life really is - although lately as the world turns ever more cruel with beheadings and Abu Ghraib's obscenities - there certainly is an even darker level undeniable in the torturer's Hell  awaiting us.  This film presents terror as it really occurs in our all-surveillance-all-the time society, where false accusation can transform your life overnight .  The unwavering fundamental humanity and reality is not sacrificed on the alter of imaginary ""shock and awe"".  Now that Stewart is departing the Daily Show, I hope his passion for film-making takes firm root.  This story is worth telling; it is finely crafted and edited and suffused with the quest for truth and unvarnished reality that he has enchanted all his viewers for sixteen years as he wandered through the messy, insane, unbelievable, scary, comedic, but always - always - HUMAN condition.  We desperately need such unpretentious level-headedness or we will become so numb and indifferent that false accusation will, in fact,  become real and we will lose our common core of humanity.  Watch it and FEEL something!",1438387200,,2778,5.291571753986332
6876799,4,B00QMV2TBO,"A heartfelt and often amusing look at a few months in the life of a Canadian/Iranian reporter Maziar Bahari, a BBC correspondent who leaves his pregnant wife in London to travel to Iran to report on the 2009 election there.
Once in Tehran, he quickly recruits an opportunistic young cabbie as his personal driver, reconnects with his mother (a subtle, somber performance from Shoreh Aghdashloo), and hits the streets to find out what Iranians think about the upcoming election. The dictatorial regime of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was being challenged by reformist Green Party candidate Mir-Hossein Mousavi (who had been the last prime minister of Iran in the 80s, until that position was eliminated) and many Iranians were energized by a potential upset. Bahari interviewed students and officials, and participated in a mock interview for Jon Stewarts The Daily Show (interviewed for the show by Jason Jones, playing himself here), which was all in good fun. When Iranians woke up the next day to a landslide win by Ahmadinejad, protests erupted over voter fraud; in the aftermath, many intellectuals, artists, filmmakers and opposing party members were arrested and detained.

We first meet Bahari as he is wakened in his childhood bed by his mother, announcing that the police have come to question him. He is shuttled off to Irans notorious Evin prison and accused of being a spy, based on the videos he had shot, and singled out was his appearance on The Daily Show, in which there was ironic joking about being a spy; the Iranian police clearly do not understand Western humor, and use this evidence as justification of holding him for nearly 4 months unless he confesses to being a spy. The majority of the film chronicles his rough interrogations and torture from a man he knew (or smelled) only as Rosewater (a tense and nuanced performance from Danish actor Kim Bodnia).

This was clearly a personal project for director Jon Stewart to choose as his directorial debut, and hes assembled a fascinating little slice-of-life that manages to delve into the psychology of torture methods, the resilience of a detainees spirit, and the clash of cultures that lead to misunderstandings. There are structural problems in the juxtaposition of flashbacks from Baharis childhood and the fantasy of his dead father and sister both visiting him in his isolation cell (they had both been detained by the state and executed for treason). In those moments, the film sometimes feels more like a stage play adaptation. The mix of despair and genuine humor is jarring, but effective; its a delight when Bahari realizes he can manipulate and entice Rosewater by making up lurid tales of his supposed evil ways. Informational graphics superimposed over a cityscape scene seem more in line with a documentary. Shot in Jordan, the city scenes crackle and hum with a sense of the ordinary.

As Bahari, Gael Garcia Bernal (Babel, The Motorcycle Diaries) is believable as a Westernized intellectual trying to capture usable and dramatic footage for the news feed, and his scenes in isolation are equally tense and empathetic, especially when hes allowed to phone his wife. The film is based on Baharis bestselling book, Then They Came for Me. The torture itself is pretty mild (compared to, say, American torture methods in Zero Dark Thirty), as the police lean more on psychological torture and duress (they didn't want to mar his face for the cameras when he finally confessed.) Rosewater is a fascinating story that deftly recreates its subjects experience; it will be interesting to see what Jon Stewart assembles next.

The Iranian government did not want anyone to report the troubles, but they could not stop Bahari.

So they used the Daily Show interview as a pretext to arrest him as a spy.  Bahari had to wear a blindfold when being questioned.  The jailer smelled of Rosewater, hence the name of the film.

6876846,1,B00QMV2TBO,"Wow, even the weakest episodes of the Daily Show felt more authentic than whatever this was!

First, as some have already mentioned, the movie commits the cardinal sin of filmmaking: it manages to be boring. With the plot being what it is (though a little worn out by now), this movie could have been a fairly exciting thriller. It was not. At roughly 1 hour and 40 minute runtime it feels like 5 hours and not in a good way.

But the real problem here is that just about everything felt cartoonish. Iranians communicating with each other in accented English, the awkward mixing of archival footage, the appearance of Jason Jones (!!) apparently with a parody of the Daily Show, the mind-numbingly simplistic dialogs, over-the-top emotions of the interrogators, Hillary Clinton(!!), Dish University... I could go on and on. Many times throughout the movie I wished that Jon Stewart had just let that trademark sarcasm of his completely out of the bag and steered this thing into a full-blown comedy. I love Leonard Cohen's music but I cringed when I heard it in this movie.

I think I have a pretty good idea of what Stewart was trying to accomplish here and in that he failed completely. The Daily Show essentially exists to pillory the realms of politics and culture. Stewart has been doing this brand of comedy for so long, and has been so isolated from the real world ""on the ground"" that when it came time to make an authentic movie about that real world, he created a tedious caricature.",1432339200,,1493,4.690839694656488

It is an insult to the many people who have been murdered and raped and viciously tortured by these people.

Even with the voice of Stewart shining through, it is written & directed with such compassion and respect for the story of Bahari's imprisonment after the Jason Jones interview. It is fully charged with honor and heart and information. The acting is beautiful across the board- Gael Garcia Bernal is brilliant and soulful, and Kim Bodnia!  I can't think of enough great things to say about him. I'll just say he listens well. - not going to spoil it! Seeing the interview with Jason Jones in context is eye-opening (and he's just unbelievably great as always) Everyone is wonderful and real.
So - with a film and story and acting this great, what ELSE does a filmmaker have to do to get nominated for all the big awards?
I guess he didn't do THAT because everything about this film is greatness! Thank you Jon Stewart! Can't wait to see what you do next!!

6876885,5,B00QMV2TBO,"The book ""Then They Came for Me: A Family's Story of Love, Captivity, and Survival"" by Maziar Bahari and Aimee Molloy relates a true incident based on the imprisonment by the Iranian government of journalist Bahari who made an off hand remark against the President of Iran on The Daily Show and was considered to be a spy when he returns to Iran to cover the elections in 2009 and captures videotapes of the uprisings. The very keen screenplay was written by Jon Stewart who also directs.

Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal is excellent as Maziar Bahari as is Kim Bodnia as his interrogator Javadi (called Rosewater because of the cologne he wears that is the only identifying aspect the constantly blindfolded Bahari can recognize). The elections are between incumbent Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Mir-Hossein Mousavi and the friction and devastation of the Tehran following Ahmadinejad's narrow victory  and it is this point that the film heightens and informs us of the fragile state of affairs in Iran. The supporting cast is quite fine - Dmitri Leonidas, Shohreh Aghdashloo and others. This is a very well made film that is part docudrama and part fictionalized history and Jon Stewart impresses as a director. Grady Harp, April 15",1429056000,2,1223,4.990196078431373
6876886,3,B00QMV2TBO,"Comedy Central's DAILY SHOW host Jon Stewart took a dramatic turn by co-writing and directing ROSEWATER. It is the true story of Iranian-Canadian journalist Maziar Bahari's arrest and imprisonment in Iran. He is accused of being a spy after returning to report on the country's election for NEWSWEEK. Bahari is brutally interrogated for months and spends his time in solitary confinement,

Mexican actor Gael Garca Bernal does a fine job of portraying Bahari. Garcia Bernal is one of those great actors that we should be seeing more of on the big screen. Lovely Iranian-American actress Shohreh Aghdashloo shines as Bahari's troubled and courageous mother,  Each day Bahari's interrogator tries to get Bahari to confess to his ""crime"" of being a spy. The dismal life of fear and hopelessness finally takes a turn as Bahari mesmerizes his interrogator with stories of wild sex in, of all places, New Jersey. He explains in detail what really goes on in Fort Lee, New Jersey --all to the interrogator's delight. Finally, Bahari makes a connection to his brutal interrogator through his made-up stories. It is an unexpected comic relief  to a tragic and heartbreaking story. This twist to the story IS the story and unfortunately only comes very late in the film. The tables are turned on the ruthless interrogator as he enjoys respite from his own dismal and boring life with Bahari's stories.

Once Bahari is arrested, the film keeps us in the prison cell and interrogation room as Bahari tries to keep his sanity. Garcia Bernal's remarkable acting abilities do keep us interested the dismal story that seems to drag on. It would have been good to see images of his wife, mother, friends and employers trying to negotiate his freedom.

Jon Stewart made a noble attempt in his first feature film but  there is not much to save this story from falling into the depths of despair as we see Bahari day after day in his misery. I watched the extras in hopes of learning more about Bahari but most features seemed to be no more than one or two minutes in length. I was hoping for more detail on Bahari;s story.  ROSE WATER attempst to tell  fascinating story that just gets lost.  It is worth watching if only to see Garcia Bernal in action.",1428969600,4,2234,4.796875

6876962,4,B00QMV2TBO,"With all of the controversy going on these days concerning Iran it would seem that any movie based on events that took place there would be far from release. Quite the opposite is true as THE DAILY SHOWs host Jon Stewart made his directorial debut last year with the release of ROSEWATER, just released on DVD.

The movie tells the story of Maziar Bahari (Gael Garcia Bernal), a journalist working for Newsweek who was held prisoner by the country of Iran for four months. An ex-Iranian, Bahari returned to his country of birth in 2009 to cover the elections going in on Iran at the time. More so than any other election this one seemed to be the start of a change for the country. Incumbent Mahmoud Ahmadinejad faced stiff opposition from Mir-Hossein Mousavi, a candidate favored by many students in the country. When the film starts Bahari is chauffeured around Tehran by a young student who takes him to his friends so that he can cover more than just the story being fed by the leaders of Iran.

Bahari records conversations with these students who seem to have no fear while he himself recognizes that by recording them he could be putting them all in jeopardy. While in Tehran he also is interviewed himself by a member of THE DAILY SHOW posing as a spy who has his own television show. As the story progresses we see the election results end with a surprising win by Ahmadinejad, even after polls showed a strong lead by Mousavi. Feeling that the elections were fraudulent, the members of the Green Movement (Mousavis backers) take to the streets in protest. The end result was extreme violence and several deaths. As he walks the streets with the young people he has met, Bahari films the protests as well as the violence that followed.

Within days of passing along his report, Bahari is awakened by the state police and taken away to Evin Prison where he is kept for questioning. Not only is he questioned but a slow form of torture follows as well where he is systematically broken down, not physically but mentally. Through it all he remembers his sister and father, both of whom had been arrested and imprisoned by the Shahs government long ago. Seeking strength from their memories he holds out as long as possible. All the while his interrogator Javadi (Kim Bodnia) badgers him, belittles him and questions him based on the evidence they have gathered and are using. Included in that evidence is the taped interview seen on THE DAILY SHOW their inability to realize that his is a comedy show and not one actually hosted by a spy.

Baharis travails lasted for four months during which time he had no contact with his then pregnant wife. Through a concerted effort just touched on in the film pressure was put on the Iranian government for his release. Those who have read about the struggle he went through or who read newspaper accounts will already know the result of his imprisonment. If not consider this a spoiler alert, he was eventually released.

There are two things about this movie that make it worth watching. First and foremost is the realization of what goes on in Iran even though it is seen through the eyes of the film makers and through Baharis own telling of what he went through. The film is actually based on his firsthand account and book, THEN THEY CAME FOR ME. While the Iranians are not depicted as the most evil of governments in the world the picture offered is still not one of a peace loving government willing to do the right thing.

The second reason to watch the film is it being Stewarts first foray into directing a major motion picture. Like him or not, agree with his politics or not, the movie doesnt take an approach that many will find fault with. It portrays a well-rounded look at the country of Iran and its leaders. Not only that the quality of film making from the camera choices made to a well-made tip of the hat to social media to the performances he gets from his major players here show that Stewart has the ability to become a major director in his own right.

In the end the question of was this film entertaining leaves me saying that yes it was while at the same time it shed a light on what was going on in Iran at the time. There is little doubt that the movie tells the story from a certain perspective but don't all movies do that, especially movies dealing with political issues? Suffice to say that in this film it attempts to steer the story down the middle and at the same time is well made enough that you never find yourself looking at your watch wondering when it will end. ROSEWATER is a movie that is in the right place at the right time and worth watching.",1426550400,,4637,4.532855436081243

6876977,5,B00QMV2TBO,"I personally don't care what anyone thinks about ""The Daily Show""'s Jon Stewart. Some think he is a great entertainer and critic of politics and the news, while others think he's just some liberal clown who doesn't know what he's talking about. Either way, as a filmmaker, Stewart's film (based on Bahari's non-fiction book ""Then They Came For Me"") about the true story of the imprisonment and torture of Iranian-Canadian journalist Maziar Bahari (Bernal), who was imprisoned in Iran for 118 days because of a satirical interview (for Stewart's ""The Daily Show""), which he gave regarding Iran's 2009 presidential election, is one of the best true story adaptations of the year. For those not ""in the know,"" Iran's 2009 presidential election saw Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who most in Iran considered somewhat of a dictator, versus Mir-Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi. Even though it was reported by media -- and video footage showed -- that there was major support for Mousavi and he seemed likely the winner, Ahmadinejad was elected president for a second term. Naturally, this caused a major outrage among the Iranian people, who turned out in droves to protest his victory. Sounds a bit like a particular country's 2000 election. However, in Iran, the protests turned violent as protesters and innocent bystanders were killed and arrested -- one of them being Bahari, who was among the crowds, taking video footage to report. Soon after his footage was aired, Bahari was arrested at his mother's home by the Iranian government without being charged and sent to Evin Prison. The reason for no search warrant or official charge? He was suspected of being a traitor with terrorist ties. I know Iran's not the only country with such policies (thank you, Patriot Act <wink>)! While some of the camera work seems a bit rough around the edges, I believe that is the look Stewart was going for so as to see Iran and the story through Bahari's camera. The dialogue -- provided in a screenplay by Stewart -- is often poetic, the pacing very well-done, and the story flows as the audience follows Bahari from his home in London to his early reporting on the streets of Iran to his stay in solitary confinement. The use of Bahari's ghosts is greatly utilized to give the audience a peek into his subconscious. This is not just an important story for freedom of speech, but also in reporting truth -- an increasingly vitally-important concept in an age of skewed ""journalism"" and heavily opinionated news. Think this could only happen in a country like Iran? Think again. When Bahari was imprisoned, he was believed to be a spy for the CIA (because ""The Daily Show"" reporter, Jason Jones, was reporting his story and, according to Iranian officials, acting like a spy), and when Bahari told Iranian officials Jones was an actor, and the show was satire, the officials refused to believe him and continued to interrogate and torture him. Bahari was imprisoned for being a traitor to Iran. In 2014, when U.S. citizen and former NSA infrastructure analyst Edward Snowden released documents proving the U.S. government's secret wiretapping of U.S. citizens, to the American press, he was branded a traitor by the U.S. government (even though the wiretapping story was so 2006!) and has had to live in countries where he can seek political asylum. This story highlights a sad truth in today's society as a whole -- that of being wrongfully imprisoned for doing what is right even though it is propagandized as traitorism and/or espionage -- and sadly, from the looks of it around the globe, shows no stopping anytime soon.",1426118400,2,3622,4.939344262295082

He is a native of Iran reporting on the election in 2009. He does a gag interview Jason Jones (Jason Jones) for ""The Daily Show"" where Jason claims to be a spy for the US. Iran uses this to arrest Bahari.

Most of the film is Bahari in his jail cell. Sometimes he is by himself, sometimes he is being questioned, and at other times he is having an imaginary conversation with his father, a one time guest of the same prison. Amazingly, it was enough to keep me interested.

This is a debut film writing and directing for Jon Stewart of the same ""Daily Show."" Jon has recently announced his retirement from said show and hopefully he will present us with more hard hitting political gems such as ""Rosewater.""

Had the pacing and cues for what is core and what is peripheral been a little more polished, it would have been a clearer artistic statement.  A little more attention to the impact his imprisonment was having on family, friends, colleagues would have upped the human emotional impact generally and explicated the emotional collateral damage to those other players in the story.

Visiting the cemetery at Anza, in Italy, where so many of our American soldiers, of all faiths are buried, side by side, leaves one in stunned silence. And yet we are hated, today, in spite of the sacrifices we have made in the name of freedom. We seem to help everyone, with blood, aid and money, and yet we are hated by so many.

I'm glad to know he was present for his baby's birth but filming that is not on the same level as covering the election in Iran.  I also felt the connection between the title of the movie and the inquisitor's spraying himself with rosewater scent was not clear.  I wouldn't have known it was rosewater if I didn't already know that was the case.  Finally, sometimes my husband puts on a blindfold when we go to bed if I want to stay up and read.

6877065,5,B00QMV2TBO,"I wasn't sure what to expect, maybe something in line with a comedy what I discovered was a powerhouse of a film. Stewarts directorial debut is nothing short of genius, his directorial style shows a delicacy and nuanced appreciation for both style and substance. This is a story of a Newsweek journalist who goes to Iran to cover their last elections only to be arrested and held in prison where he was tortured and forced to admit he was a spy for the United States. To be honest his torture was very light compared to what many have gone through around the world, nevertheless torture it was. What's striking about the film is the naivet of the the interrogators who are the arm of Iran's tyrannical state who came across as brutish and unsophisticated. This is an absorbing film perfectly acted by Bernal and the amazing cast of Iranian born actors. The film uses footage from Iran but was filmed in Jordan, the soundtrack is awesome and original and the script is tight without any superfluous scenes or dialogue. I really hope Stewart continues to write and direct in the future because I was floored by the quality of this film. Brilliant!",1424044800,3,1145,4.673267326732673

6877069,4,B00QMV2TBO,"As an author, I can see this through a clearer lens, and feel that it is a good first outing for Mr. Stewart.  While he chose a talented leading man to portray his protagonist, the film suffers from too little of what happens on American soil to have a mass market appeal in the U.S.

He (Stewart) has beautifully captured the survival story that took place in prison, and similar to Nelson Mandela, there is the hint of having to woo one's captors.  There is a deep emotional connection to the character and the story is an honest representation of events.  That said, the scenes of violence do not have an impact and seem choreographed rather than raw.  Mr. Stewart would do well to take a page out of David Fincher's book in creating more suspense during scenes of torture.  Further, the film has a lot of medium shots, and you don't get many views of character reactions.

Overall, the film is strong in telling the story of a journalist who had dumb luck on his side.  However, it fails to capture the true terrors of the Iranian government, and they at times seem as formidable as mall security guards.

In the future, I would encourage this director to take some risks and play up to the strength and intelligence of his audience.  We do not have glass jaws, and you are welcome to show us the ugly truth behind theocracy.  The charm of the film is indeed beautiful, and the connections between the characters warm, but I have seen worse stories about American prisons, which dulls the impact of the story.",1423872000,2,1513,4.525735294117647

8691994,4,B00QMV2TBO,"I preferred the memoir on which the movie was based.

However, there was one visual from the film that portrayed Bahari's main survival technique --  which was to create a parallel universe in his head where he could shut out reality and, for example, visit with his dead father and sister.  The music of Leonard Cohen was part of that world.  In fact, writer/director Jon Stewart would've loved a Cohen cameo in the movie, but that was not to be. Apparently, a trip to Jordan during Ramadan to film  in a solitary confinement cell was not on Cohen's bucket list.

For me, the most stunning and my favourite scene was Gael Garcia Bernal/Maziar Bahari dancing in his cell.  The background music -- Cohen's ""Dance Me to the End of Love"" -- spills over from the previous scene with Barhari and his interrogator.  The dance lasts less than two minutes and was done in one take.  Brilliant.

 Not necessary for any understanding of the book or movie, but here's Cohen on how that particular song came to be written:  
"" its curious how songs begin because the origin of the song, every song, has a kind of grain or seed that somebody hands you or the world hands you and thats why the process is so mysterious about writing a song. But that came from just hearing or reading or knowing that in the death camps, beside the crematoria, in certain of the death camps, a string quartet was pressed into performance while this horror was going on, those were the people whose fate was this horror also. And they would be playing classical music while their fellow prisoners were being killed and burnt.",1521504000,,1592,4.58303886925795

I like that it was not too serious. And he was not portrayed as a broken man, or a one sided hero. It was very human. In my experience, those who make it through horrible experiences make it because they have hope and still find some joy and laughter in the world. I have seen interviews with Maziar Bahari and he is not a beaten man. It seems his resolve to tell the truth has been strengthened by his experience. I have heard and read a lot of how the Iranian government treats anyone with ties in the west. It seems that this is a realistic portrayal of that.
Shohreh Aghdashloo is a dream. She's the movie star version of all the older Persian ladies I have known. There could have been more Iranians cast but Mr Bahari was very involved and it was his story, after all.",1520121600,2,964,4.244565217391305
