8361582,3,B002BKS0N6,"I think the arrangements of the music are good, and the songs are popular and beautiful songs, but there really aren't the proper ""cues"" within the arrangements, to guide the singer along to know when to come in/start to sing on a verse.
  All the arrangements are in keys for the male voice.  So I, a female, have to sing the song too high or too low.  On the description of these Karaoke songbooks they should say if the songs are written in keys for male or female voices.",1349740800,3,475,4.303370786516854
