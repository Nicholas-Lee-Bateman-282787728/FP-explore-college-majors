8736179,5,B016BDLQKM,"This blu ray is amazing. It is evident that they went all out on recording these concerts. The audio and video quality are superb, plus his latest album, Terral, is probably Alboran's best, which helps the concert be even better.
A couple of notes: This is being listed as a B/2 region blu ray. That information is wrong. You can look at the back cover picture here, on Amazon, and see the ""ABC"" hexagon towards the bottom of the back cover, which means it is all regions.
I own this blu ray, although I bought it on the 'Bay, but the information on the back is the same as the one on the picture here, and it plays in regular U.S. blu ray players.",1462060800,2,648,4.233870967741935
