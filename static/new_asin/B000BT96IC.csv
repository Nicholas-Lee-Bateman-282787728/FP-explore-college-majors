8092090,3,B000BT96IC,"So, I wanted to see a movie with Hugh Beaumont.

SPOILER ALERT!

The movie wasn't remastered so the quality of the audio/video wasn't so great in some spots.

Hugh Beaumont as Ward Cleaver was the all-time good guy.  It's interesting that he plays the villain here.  He's also quite a bit younger too.",1363392000,2,301,4.60377358490566

Lucky Brandon denies seeing Larry. Lucky admits knowing Norma, she lent him $10,000 to start the nightclub. Captain Brown continues the investigation. Will Vicky investigate on her own?
