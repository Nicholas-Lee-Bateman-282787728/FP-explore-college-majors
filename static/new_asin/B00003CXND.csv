1268924,3,B00003CXND,"The serial killer thriller has become a fan favorite but THE WATCHER misses the mark. While it does hold some entertainment value it completely lacks in originality and character development.  There are no tremendous WOWs that surface as the film progresses.
James Spader does a fair job with the role of Campbell, an FBI agent who moved from L.A. to Chicago to escape the memories of a haunting unsolved series of murders. The problem is that the psychopathic killer Griffin (Keanu Reeves) has followed him. Griffin puts Agent Campbell is a deadly game of beat the clock each time he takes another girl. The question is, Will Campbell catch him before the stakes becomes personal yet again?  This question is answered in a predictable climax.
While the plot is unoriginal it still remains interesting. The main problem is that Reeves does not give his character what it needs.  Where Griffin should be maniacal he comes across as silly .  The character is nowhere near as menacing as he should be.  James Spader and Maris Tomei are O.K. but they fail to deliver the pop that would have made this film a four star affair.
Overall the film isn't that exciting nor is it that boring.  It is a good rental and microwave popcorn flick.....just don't have your  hopes too high. A solid three star film.",982627200,,1297,4.737777777777778
1268925,5,B00003CXND,"Burned-out FBI agent Jack Campbell (James Spader) has left LA and settled in Chicago.  Still tormented by the nightmares of a serial killer that has not been caught, Jack, tries to put back the pieces of his life, with the help of his psychiatrist (Marisa Tomei), but his life is about to take a turn for the worse.
David Allen Griffin (Keanu Reeves) is the killer that got away, and he has followed Jack to Chicago.  He has a nasty game he wants to play, and Jack is the key player.
Griffin will send Jack a photograph of each victim on the day he plans to murder them, if they are to stay alive, Jack must find them before 9:00pm.
As the game of cat and mouse heats up, so do the stakes, for Griffin knows what makes Jack tick, and the next victim may be someone very close to him.
""The Watcher"" is a gripping thriller, that glues you to your seat from the first five minutes, and hurtles you through a twisted maze of madness.  Very few movies can give away the identity of the killer in the opening and still be suspenseful, but ""The Watcher"" pulls it off by creating an atmosphere of tension that never lets up.
James Spader is (as always) very good as the mentally scarred FBI agent, and Keanu Reeves takes a nice turn in the role of the totally deranged killer.
Exciting plot, suspense, action, and very good acting make this  a must own for thriller fans.

1268926,2,B00003CXND,"There sure aren't a lot of great movies coming out these days, espesially in the ""thriller"" category. ""The Watcher"" bears this heavy burden. The movie is NOT awful, and it IS entertaining at key points, but at the same time it doesn't bring anything new or particularly interesting to the table either. It starts out quite unappealing but mid-way through becomes quite thrilling, but the ever-so-crucial climax is underwhelming. This is one of those movies that, ten minutes after you've seen it, you've already forgotten all about it. It's one of those movies that makes you wonder why it would be greenlit in the first place because of its complete lack of originality and wide appeal. James Spader DOES make a surprisingly good burnt out hero, and, without a doubt, he is the film's saving grace. Keanu Reeves is, as always, Keanu Reeves,except now he's got his long hair back and kills people. It's probably not something you'll regret spending a few hours to watch, but once you have it's doubtful that you will ever give it a second thought.",982195200,,1047,4.822222222222222
1268927,1,B00003CXND,"I won't even jump on the bandwagon and bash Keanu because he did fit the role for the killer and do a decent acting job.  James Spader also fit the role of a down on his luck ""actor"" I mean cop who is trying to drive his life into the ground by making bad choices like ""Supernova"" I mean using drugs.  All humor aside this movie just lacked something.  To many flashbacks, a non-existent supporting cast, and an anti-climatic ending make this movie UNWATCHABLE.",980208000,4,461,4.464285714285714
1268928,5,B00003CXND,"I saw ""The Watcher"" in September when it first came out, and found it to be an intelligent though not overly original thriller.  The real highlight of the film of course is the charismatic James Spader, looking fabulous as usual, playing a substance abusing former cop.  The premise of the film has been done before of course-serial killer becomes obsessed with the cop who wants to arrest him- but this movie is no ""Kiss the Girls"" but rather rises above its tired premise to new heights of suspense.
Reeves, not the greatest actor but surely as good as the overrated Ben Affleck, really gives a great and scary performance as the killer searching for connectionless young woman to prey on.
The film is interesting because it examines a phenomenon common in America today-lack of communication. It is very possible to get lost in the crowd and be a ghost in your own life.
The film was also deeply psychologically disturbing, and poses many questions. But above all, its a must see for Spader's performance alone.",979344000,6,1014,4.788571428571428
1268929,5,B00003CXND,"um...
This movie is ok.  The plot is plausible, the characters believable, but do we really care?  The only sane person in the whole picture is the killer himself David Allen Griffin [played very well by KEANU REEVES].  He's the only person with his head screwed on and going about with purpose in his life [albiet killing young ladies using piano wire...]
As Griffin says to Detective Campbell [played by James Spader] 'I want you to say thank you for coming here and saving your pathetic life' because man, it's depressing to look at him in this film ~ Overly depressing.  Makes you want to slash your wrists...LOL
Now Ms Tomei's performance in this film is limited.  They should have given her more scope, more lines.  Then I would have been more simpathetic to her character.  Either way, I couldn't have cared less for her situation.
Regarding the direction of the piece all's I got to say is it gave me a headache.  All this whizzy blurriness just put me off.  I didn't know if I was watching MTV or a thriller.  Stop the rollercoaster Mr Charbanic.
That aside, the good points of this movie are it's use of suspense [you really wouldn't want Griffin lurking in your house after dark].
The underscore was superb [by Marco Beltrami] and highly recommended, and there are some nice action sequences.
Keanu lifts the movie above the average ~ well done!",979257600,,1356,4.659663865546219
1268930,2,B00003CXND,"After viewing this movie in the theater, I walked out not really suprised because I kinda figured the movie wouldn't be that good, but I tried it because I liked Keanu in the Matrix. Well, let me tell you, his ""Whoa"" voice that he speaks in just ruined his serial killer character because he just talked too goofy and wasn't scary at all. The darkness and spookiness of the movie gave it kind of a cool tone, but without a good bad guy, it's not a good movie!",978998400,,459,4.2272727272727275
1268931,1,B00003CXND,"This is a film that you could figure out the ending in a matter of moments. You know who the killer is (Reeves), and you know that he will be brought down by the ""intelligent"" officer (Spader), the real question is only that of how long is it going to take to catch him. This film is done in a way that makes it painfully dull to watch. We have seen all of these scenes of violence in other movies, but in the other movies they were done more tastefully. The real truth is that Reeves does not make a great villian. He may be torturing these women, but all you can help to think is that you saw him in Bill and Teds Excellent Adventure. You do not want to see Bill, or was he Ted, strangling a woman. You do not want to see anyone doing that. We, the movie going public, have seen these formulaic acts of violence committed numerous times, by now they just lose any merit and originality. This film should have tried to be original. Instead it is just a retread of many films we have seen before.",978048000,,996,4.139175257731959
1268932,4,B00003CXND,"I went to the cinema with a great desire to watch it. My thoughts about this movie was crashed with the end of it However I want to mention that Keanu was very succesful he acted very well also James Spader too but there are some missing in this movie .First of all the ending is not so good it can be made more interesting it is so ordinary. Then the atmosphere of the movie is not so high you can not get yourself into the movie , it is a mistake to make this well writen movie like a pop corn film .They could make it better but I don't know the reason why they make it so ordinary .To sum up I can say that watch this movie but don't expect many things however it is worth to watch it.",977270400,,689,3.859154929577465
1268933,4,B00003CXND,"I went into the theater expecting to see a total clunker. But I was pleasantly surprised. Not by the movie on a whole, but the individual performances were pretty damn good.
My instant reactions to the commercials were: Keanu Reeves and James Spader in a movie? Keanu playing a bad guy? I am *so* there! And I'll tell you, although the movie is not fast moving, and not that action packed, it was quite enthralling.
The commercials dressed the movie up as Keanu's character, Griffin, stalking his victims for awhile...maybe dating them, and then murdering them. But in the movie, it is not that way at all. Must less intimate you'll find, his real reason for killing is for the attention it brings him of Spader's F.B.I. agent, Campbell. His true obsession is not with murdering, but with the one trying to arrest him.
Good performances from Reeves, and as always, with the consistently excellent Spader. I really enjoyed the interaction between the two actors.",977011200,,961,4.83030303030303

The artsy camera work might have been a bit too much, but I did like how it's suppose to be creative. The storyline was what intrigued me, when i decided to wach it. A cat and mouse movie to get your heart pumping.  I did like James Spader's role, I however, would have switched Keanu Reeves and James Spader roles. I love James Spader as a good guy but you cannot deny that he plays one of the best villains ever. Overall I would check it out but don't expect too much.

This is my second viewing of this movie, the first when it originally was released sixteen years ago, and my opinion about it hasn't changed. I still like it and I still think if this movie were being cast today, I've a feeling the roles would be reversed, with Reeves as the policeman and Spader as the serial killer.

As it is, it's a bit of a treat to see Keanu Reeves playing the villain. The two play off each other well, and the story works, so there's no complaint there. The investigation, carried out with out the aid of computers, etc., seems primitive compared to how TV and movies handle those things now.  There's violence and some bloody scenes of the crimes, making it into a tense thriller.

This movie was viewed as a rental DVD and no remuneration was involved in the writing of this review.",1475884800,,1049,4.476439790575916

As he occasionally suffers from guilt migraines, he regularly attends therapy sessions with Dr. Polly Beilman. Other than that, Joel is a lonely man with no friends or social life. Upon moving in, Joel learns that a woman who lived in the apartment building he's in was recently killed. Initially, he makes nothing of it until he receives a picture of the murdered female victim in his mail that had been taken 3 days before her murder.

After bringing this matter to the attention of one of his former fellow FBI detectives, Joel comes to the conclusion that David has followed him to Chicago. Soon enough, Joel begins receiving daily phone calls from David, who plays sick mind games with him, telling him that he will send him photos of female victims 24 hours before he kills them. The only way they can survive? If he can find them before the 24 hours is up. Joel unwillingly becomes hooked in the crosshairs of David and ultimately has no choice but to become a player of this wicker killer's game as he leads the FBI on a massive manhunt across Chicago for this murderer.

1269426,2,B00003CXND,"James Spader plays an FBI agent who spent 3 years in Los Angeles trying to catch a serial killer played by Keanu Reeves. Reeves latched onto Spader's character and made the game personal by killing someone Spader cared about. The movie begins with Spader now an ex-FBI agent who has moved to Chicago to get away from his past. He's a mess, barely sleeping and using prescription meds to live day to day. He soon gets pulled back into the field however when he discovers that Reeves has followed him to Chicago and has started their game up again by killing more women. He contacts Spader and tells him he will mail a picture of his next victim to him and then Spader will have 24 hours to find her before Reeves kills her. Marisa Tomei plays a therapist Spader has been seeing and Reeves eventually goes after her.

On the box of this DVD Ebert and Roeper say this is ""a superb thriller"". They must have watched a different movie called The Watcher because this is not a good movie. The plot is clich and overdone. We never get to know anything about Reeves or why he kills these women. It's called The Watcher because Reeves spends weeks stalking his victim so he knows everything about them but we only find this out from a voice over by Spader's character, this trait isn't shown, but told. Marisa Tomei is given nothing to do and no personality. Her involvement in the ending is as clich as it gets.

The Watcher is a film so dull that the very fact is called a thriller makes me laugh uncontrollably. Nothing in this film works. From the beginning we are introduced to the neurotic detective (Spader) who can not sleep because he never got to catch that one killer who outsmart him (they got pretty original with this script) Then we are also introduced to the killer (Reeves) who is randomly dancing (first laugh out loud segment in the movie) well to be honest Im not sure if he was really dancing but well lets say he was doing his thing. So we already know who is who and what they both want so there is no real mystery. That would be fine if there was some tension on their relationship but Spader and Reeves seem to be working in complete different movies. Specially Reeves who plays his part in the most pedestrian way, he says Im going to kill you in the same way he says good morning. With no change in tempo, pitch, enthusiasm. Even a robot has more charm. Oh and I almost forgot about Tomei who is Spaders psychiatrist and by the end is going to end up in someones hand?? No u don't know? For realz? ok then maybe this movies is really for you. Anyways some plot-less movies still have value added by their special effects and suspenseful chasing sequences.

I had a good laugh in the beginning watching Keanu Reeves' character doing some lame dance along to a dance version of Rob Zombie's Dragula. That was hysterical. They brought Zombie back later with ""How to Make a Monster"" and I guess that was an attempt to help emphasize some horrific, monster-like quality of Reeves' character which didn't really exist. His portrayal of a serial killer was pretty comical. I didn't buy it. Maybe it would have helped if there had been more character development or back story.

As for the production, it's pretty good. The camera work is good, action is good, excellent car chase scene, and some great effects. And the soundrack was good. The music and scoring worked well with the film and was practically invisible throughout, which is the way it should be.

1269483,2,B00003CXND,"Okay, who's bright idea was it to cast Keanu Reeves as the serial killer while having James Spader as the good guy cop?!!? Shouldn't of that been the other way around? While that's just one of the problems with The Watcher, it's easy to see why this film is buried in the Reeves library. Keanu plays a serial killer from California who somehow becomes infatuated with a detective that been on his tail ever since his first young female kill. When he kills a woman that Spader was having an affair with, it breaks the detective and he quits the Force, relocating to Chicago. Heartbroken, Reeves' character also moves to the Windy City, restarts his killing rampage, and gets Spader back on the case, all for the thrill of the chase.

While this film has a few decent thriller aspects, along with a good acting job by Spader & a ""phoning-in"" Marisa Tomei, the whole idea of Keanu as a piano-wire carrying murderer is never truly believed. Even more terrifying is when Reeves tries to play ""crazy"" by doing a dance that would even make Batman's Adam West or John Travolta's Vincent Vega giggle. Overall, this is one flix that plays more like an ABC Network pilot for James Spader's character that didn't work out in favor for his Boston Legal. Only recommended to viewers that still don't understand that casting is one of the most important parts of filmmaking.

1269566,4,B00003CXND,"Despite the mixed reviews, I found myself enjoying this movie and since I didn't purchase it there was no disappointment on that level. Some movies make great rentals on a rainy Sunday and this was perfect as it kept me guessing to the outcome to the twisted and complex story about a serial killer and the detective on his back.

James Spader (who was also great in Boston Legal, Secretary, Stargate, Wolf) did a great job portraying Joel Campbell, a retired detective who had moved on with his life after an enigmatic past that wakes him up in cold sweat and nightmares. He is clearly not over whatever happened to him back on the west coast and is trying to get his life back as he sees a shrink (Marisa Tomei) to help him out. His daily grind is un-interrupted by a murder that happens in his own building and when he finds a letter mailed to him, postmarked three days before the murder happened with the girls picture in it he is more than concerned. Spader recognizes the situation as the nightmare scenario that he escaped from as it trespasses on his turf and makes his life hell again. He knows that the mysterious man known as Griffin played by Keanu Reeves is obsessed with him and has tracked him down, sending him cards and pictures of his next victims. He gives Spader till 9pm each day to find the victim or he kills them; chocking from behind with piano wire leaving a trail of blood and pain behind.

Campbell must find the potential victims and save them, as they are tied to the mystery why he retired and ran away. To find closure and peace he must salvage all his strength, clever tactics, his rather barbaric people skills and his fading mental capabilities to catch Griffin and to avenge a death close to his heart.

I enjoyed the twists and turns and having seen failure and struggle instead of smooth sailing for the main character as he slips and falls but then gets up and fights back made it non-predictable and fun.",1151193600,5,1945,4.488700564971752
1269567,3,B00003CXND,"""The Watcher"" looks and sounds like a made-for-cable-TV thriller about a stalker/serial killer. I was surprised to learn that it got a theatrical release, which I think accounts for its many poor reviews. This isn't a terrible film by any means. Instead, it's a time killer that fans of either James Spader or Keanu Reeves will probably get a kick out of and there's some lovely location footage of Chicago to boot.

Keanu Reeves plays a serial killer from James Spader's past. He tracks the former FBI agent down and starts killing young women again. This forces Spader to resume his career as an FBI agent; a decision that is fraught with drama because Spader is now burnt-out on police work and is virtually addicted to a variety of prescription drugs. There's nothing spectacularly intriguing or even novel about the film's premise or execution. But if you're a fan of Spader's TV work, you're going to like this one a lot, and it's fun to see Reeves play what is essentially an extended cameo cast against type. Marisa Tomei fans beware - the talented actress is almost totally wasted in a small, thankless role.

Great cinema? Hardly. But as a Spader fan, I enjoyed this one as a rental and think you will too.",1142985600,13,1216,4.677570093457944
1269568,3,B00003CXND,"The Watcher has been in in my video store's DVD collection since it was released on DVD. My video store was robbed once, and that one had been rented before the robbing hence the copy was still there. Ever since it was released I had been meaning to rent it. The cover always looked at me and made me want to see it. But I always found myself saying ""Meh, I'll rent it next time"". I finally got around to it yesterday and I popped it into my DVD player and realized ""I have no clue what this movie is about"".

This movie is about a detective Joel Campbell who had been tracking a serial killer but never caught him. After several failures he decided to move to Chicago. The serial killer ""missed"" him in a sick and twisted way so he moved to Chicago as well to start his murders there. As he used to, he started sending pictures of his victims to Joel and that is where the fun begins.

I found that Keanu Reevs made an excellent villain. He was perfectly believable as a pathetic, scum bag killer. James Spade also did a great job. But this movie was lacking something. I guess it was lacking a lot of suspence. It had its tense moments here and there but nothing that made you gasp or jump out of your seat. Also one (very minor) problem I had was the Mitch character.

1269571,2,B00003CXND,"I am normally a fan of Keanu Reeves, Marissa Tomei, and particularly James Spader, BUT NOT in this movie.

First, whoever cast Marissa as a psychiatrist needs some medical attention of their own...she just doesn't look or even TRY to act the part. She's lucky that Academy Awards (for Cousin Vinny) can't be recalled.

Keanu tries to creep us out as a good looking serial killer with excessively polite diction (what an original concept !!!), but comes off as a ""Stepford Husband""...robotic and really not that scary. Let's just say that he won't be replacing Anthony Hopkins or Tony Perkins anytime soon.

James Spader, who is usually the personification of arrogant indifference, just doesn't come across. Sometimes he's arrogant; too often he is indifferent....but then so are we, because his dialog and character are so poorly conceived.

I blame virtually all of this on a lousy screenplay and amateurish direction. There is not one original thought, shot, or concept in the entire movie. The ""trick"" camera shots look like the work of a stoned high school kid, and the background music is so wretched and disconnected from the story that you begin to wonder if your DVD player may not be picking up random radio signals from a foreign country.

All in all, this would barely rank as a good ""made for TV"" movie...it lacks the power, talent, vision, and skill of a legitimate theatrical release. For these reasons, I am advising you to pass it up....you can definitely do better.",1121731200,,1483,4.892430278884462
1269572,2,B00003CXND,"I've always believed that Keanu Reeves would make a really good bad guy, ever since I saw him in action in The Gift.  I was hoping that The Watcher would provide the answer.  Netflix to the rescue!

The plot of The Watcher revolves around Joel Campbell (James Spader), a former FBI agent who has moved from L.A. to Chicago to escape his demons.  And his demons are many, including an affair with a married woman, the death of said married woman, and the choice Joel had to make between catching a serial killer (David Allen Giffin played by Mr. Reeves) or letting the woman he loves burn to death.  Unfortunately, Joel was too late to save her.

Joel moves to escape his past, but his past moves with him.  David decides to relocate his serial killing activities to Chicago and continue their game of cat-and-mouse.  He's gotten so used to killing that Joel is now a part of the thrill of the hunt.  So David invents a little game: he mails a picture of his next victim to Joel, who has until 9 p.m. that day to find her before it's too late.

In the middle of all this is Dr. Polly Beilman (the lovely Marisa Tomei), Joel's psychiatrist.  She tries to help Joel deal with his issues:  he never really sleeps and has perpetual migraines.  Can you guess why she's in this film kids? I knew you could!

There are two powerful flaws that make the film distracting instead of creepy.

PROBLEM #1: The film alternates between several ""point of view"" speeds.  One of them is the normal film of day-to-day life.  The second is Stalker Cam, from the perspective of David who watches his victims.  Just to mix things up, occasionally the screens flashes bright white and we hear the sound of a camera flash.  `Cause David's watching.  Get it? The third and worst film speed is the Memory Cam. We see bits and pieces of Joel's past life and the death of his lover in weird, Six Million Dollar Man slow motion blur.  It's annoying the first time and becomes extremely tedious as the film revisits the same scene over and over and over.  Worse, this effect is used whenever action takes place on screen.  It's almost as if the director didn't know what to do during action scenes and resorted to blurring things a lot to cover it all up.

PROBLEM #2: At bizarre, inappropriate times, we get rock music interludes.  The music varies so widely in scope that it never establishes a mood.  American Psycho used music to excellent effect (covering up the screams of the victims as well as establishing the decade of the movie).  In The Watcher, it's like someone flipped to MTV during the boring parts.

The main thrust of the film is the horrible anonymity that we all suffer in cities.  Even though Joel knows who's going to die, even though the police put posters of the victim everywhere, even though the TV news broadcasts who the victim is...nobody notices these poor, lonely girls.  It's a compelling message that's utterly lost in this film.

The actors work with what they've got.  Spader comes off as patently unlikable.  Tomei looks bored.  Everyone else is there to act as typical foils.  Reeves' dialogue makes him sound and act like an idiot.

And that's the problem.  Serial killers are human wrecks, built from abuse and neglect.  We never learn more about David and why he does what he does.  To make him truly frightening, we need to get inside his head (stalker cams don't count).  But half the time The Watcher is about Joel, who comes off as kind of a jerk.  Heck, David's kills aren't even scary.  The trailer showed David's shadow as he strangled a woman with piano wire...but get this, it was SPED UP.

In other words, the guys making the trailer decided the murder scenes in The Watcher were too boring, so they sped it up for the trailer.  That one scene was what made me want to see the movie.  But in the actual film, that scene is filmed in slow motion flash.  Forget Joel's migraines, The Watcher tries to give YOU a migraine.

This is Joe Charbanic's first film as a director and presumably his last, since IMDB doesn't list anything else since 2000 when The Watcher was made. It shows.",1112486400,4,4100,4.530695770804911
1269597,4,B00003CXND,"Another serial killer, will you say. Yes. But this one has some originality, though not in subject or theme but in emphasis. The emphasis is set on the ambiguous relation between the serial killer and one particular investigator, as well as between the investigator and one particular victim. The investigator saved the last victim from the piano string of the killer but instead of freeing her so that she could escape from the last trap the killer had set, he runs after the killer and will come back, when he realizes his mistake, but too late. This investigator will follow the victim from Los Angeles to Chicago and the killer will follow the investigator the same way and start killing again in Chicago. This killer sets his new series of murders as a direct provocation and challenge to the investigator. They will finally confront each other and the relation appears to be self nourishing and self destructive. The stake is who will win. Of course the investigator who uses his portable phone creatively, and the killer will not realize it, and because the investigator will find a weapon in the most improbable place possible at the right moment. The killer appears then as a cannibal personality who needs this relation with the investigator as if he were a brother of his, so he says, but that brother will betray his brotherly killer. This raises a question that is not too difficult to answer. Who is the real Cain ? The killer who is trying to invade and possess the investigator, and eventually destroy him ? The investigator who accepts to go along with his forced relationship with the killer but trying to betray him all along and destroying him in the end ? It is easy to answer because we cannot accept murdering people as an ethical or even reasonable basis for such a relation between two people. Our ethics says that killing and murdering are evil by definition. Which means Cain is killed in the end by Abel. A revenge on the Bible, but also a story that has no possible sequel.

1269598,3,B00003CXND,"Detective Joel Campbell (James Spader) had been tracking a serial killer (Keanu Reeves) for years, always one step behind and unable to catch him.  This killer, nicknamed 'The Watcher', methodically stalked his victims and took his time killing them, a man who obviously enjoyed his work.  Detective Campbell was obsessed with finding the killer until a special woman worked her way into his life.  Unbeknownst to the detective, the Watcher was just as obsessed with Joel as Joel was with him.  Convinced that the woman was coming between them, the Watcher made Joel's lover his next victim.  Distraught and horrified, Joel retired to Chicago and tried to bury himself in pills and sleep to keep the nightmares at bay.
Bored with the new detective assigned to his case, the Watcher moved to Chicago to renew his relationship with Joel.  At first, Joel wasn't willing to play so the Watcher changed the game.  He would send a picture of his victim 24 hours before he killed her, giving Joel a fighting chance to save whomever he chose.  Unable to resist the urge to try and rescue the innocent women that the Watcher was stalking, Joel found himself too late time and time again.  Desperate, he turned to his psychologist, Dr. Polly Beilman (Marisa Tomei) for assistance, completely unaware that the Watcher was dogging his every step and watching his every move...
The Watcher was a decent psychological thriller, but nothing spectacular. I found James Spader completely convincing as a burned-out detective, but there was never really any spark of life that came, even when he was working on the case. He still seemed pretty detached and cold, even during the final scenes. This should have given Keanu Reeves a chance to really steal the show, but he was just not creepy enough in his role as the serial killer. He was okay, pretty uncoordinated in his dance scenes, but just okay. I would have liked to see someone with that cold, creepy, chilly air like Anthony Hopkins or someone completely unexpected in the role as the serial killer. Also, Marisa Tomei was definitely underutilized in the film - the director should have just saved his budget and cast an unknown in the role because she played such a small part. Still, this movie did have its moments and I thought it was an entertaining enough film - entertaining enough to rent and watch once, that is.",1087430400,,2362,4.812345679012346
1269599,3,B00003CXND,"The stars of THE WATCHER have had interesting and varied careers.  James Spader who burst on the scene in SEX LIES AND VIDEOTAPE and then went on to such flicks as SUPER NOVA, JACK'S BACK and the current tv series THE PRACTICE, plays Joel Campbell with a sense of emotional detachment and fierce reserve.  He's almost like a powder keg waiting to erupt.  For me, there was no cathartic eruption, and I felt Campbell should have been played by a more intense and complex actor, say like Sean Penn or Colin Farrell.  Even so, Spader is effective in those scenes where this detachment works.  He just doesn't bring any real intensity to his performance.
Keanu Reeves, ah, what can one say about this attractive if dramatically challenged thespian?  Think of him in BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE...or DANGEROUS LIAISONS or BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA...or most all of his films.  As animated as a cucumber.  But, there is hope, I think.  While far from great in this role, he does bring a lot of life to his role, which is surprisingly underwritten.  But if he can achieve this type of talent as also displayed in THE GIFT, Keanu may become an actor yet.
Marisa Tomei of course won everyone's puzzled surprise when she won an Oscar for MY COUSIN VINNY.  Remember---they even said that the actor presenting the award read the wrong name.  Well, Marisa remained dormant for a while until she came back with her strong Oscar nominated performance for IN THE BEDROOM.  Alas and alack, there's not much Tomei does in this role.  Embarassingly underwritten, Tomei serves little purpose and shows little emotion in this psychiatrist role.
With all that in mind, it's still a very entertaining, tense serial killer thriller.  The victims are all worth feeling for, and Reeves' brutal nonchalance is chilling.  Joe Cherbanic's direction is erratically captivating and Marco Baltremi's score is eclectically satisfying.

I also thought it was interesting to see Keanu Reeves in the part of a killer. It wasn't as intense as you'd probably think it'd be but still was plenty good enough for me. But draw your own conclusions...",1082678400,2,384,4.273972602739726
1269601,3,B00003CXND,"This film feels more like a direct-to-video rather than a megaplex-worthy feature. This was probably originally billed as a James Spader movie, yet Keanu Reeves comes onto the scene and struggles to act the bad guy, alongside the other two, bit-part celebrities.
Keanu was originally never supposed to do this film. According to him, a friend faked his signature and signed the contract, forcing him to do the film for a much smaller actor's salary than he's used to. But thankfully for Keanu, his part as the bad guy, serial killer got extended, and he's in the movie a lot more than originally scripted.
Unfortunately, this movie comes across as being severely miscast. Keanu isn't really as evil as he was in The Gift, where he played another rare bad guy in his career. James Spader and Marisa Tomei are good in small doses, as supporting actors in other films, but they don't really light up the screen enough to succeed as lead actors.
There is virtually no suspense or insight in this and a lot of visual tricks are used to cover up what is lacking. It's pretty much known what is going to happen.
To give some of the plot away, this is one of the first films where Keanu dies. Sorry guys, but you know it's gonna happen, he's a serial killer. Of course, his character has never died in a movie, not that I know of anyway; I only have (unlucky) 13 of his films. Most of his earlier films haven't been released on DVD, and I suppose some of them I'll never get to see. I suppose you could technically say he died in Devil's Advocate, except afterwards it was like a dream, and it was what could have happened. And I suppose you could say he kinda died in the Matrix too.
What I really hate about Keanu - yes, me, I actually hate something about him - is that in Matrix, and a couple of other films, he's so lean and athletic looking, almost skinny. Or in Speed, with all those lovely muscles. But then in Chain Reaction, or The Watcher, The Gift, he's let himself go. The hair is all long and straggly, he's all chubby, and since he's hitting the big four oh this year, he's definitely going for the middle age spread. In these films, you can probably get an insight into the real Keanu - not cutting his hair, not looking after himself etc.
Nothing against James Spader or Marisa Tomei, but maybe if this film had more A-list stars in it, it might have been more of a success. Plus there are no extras on the DVD, not even a trailer (yikes!). If I'd known what it was like before I got it, then I probably wouldn't have bought it. But it's my 13th Keanu Reeves film, and it was only 3. Don't pay the full price for it.",1076544000,,2625,4.34826883910387

Not to be missed for you Spader junkies !",1074384000,,499,5.25
1269604,2,B00003CXND,"You know when a movie boasts ""and Keanu Reeves"" you're in pretty big trouble.
Sometimes I go with the general flow when I put down actors. For example, Adam Sandler doesn't really bother me. He was perfect for ""Happy Gilmore"" (which I think is a great mindless comedy). But Keanu Reeves is one actor that I, personally, have never considered a great--much less good--actor. In ""Bill and Ted"" and ""The Matrix"" he's fine, yes, because he fits the parts given to him (new generation slackers).""Speed"" is one of my all-time favorite action films, but not really because of Reeves himself.
The movies in which he is supposed to display true emotions--such as ""Feeling Minnesota"" or ""A Walk in the Clouds""--are the ones that bother me, because I know that there are better actors putting on school plays who aren't getting paid--yet he's raking in the millions. Many of his dramatic roles are rather dry and laughable. When it comes to *real* roles, Keanu just fails miserably.
I'll explain why, since I'll probably get angry letters from ""Matrix"" fans and teenage girls with posters of him on their walls if I don't. My main problem with Reeves is that he's always the same. His face is always the same. His tone of voice. His expressions. His mannerisms. For the sake of comparison, imagine Dustin Hoffman in ""Rain Man."" Now imagine Keanu Reeves trying to play Raymond Babbitt. See what I mean?
I've been observing Reeves since his days of ""Bill and Ted,"" and my aunt adores him. I've been fed his movies for a long time. When I saw him in ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure,"" I thought he had talent. That he could really fit roles easily. Then I realized that he really WAS Ted, and that's when my expectations dropped.
But I don't want to turn this into a Keanu Reeves hating fest. The point of all those paragraphs is just an explanation of why I'm not a big fan of Mr. Keanu ""Whoa"" Reeves, or his dramatic cinematic ventures. I say that he should stay close to what he's good at (dumb slackers). But that's just me.
In ""The Watcher,"" Keanu is a serial killer who toys around with an ex-FBI Agent (James Spader) whose lover Keanu killed years before in a fire. (Bad, Keanu, bad!) In fact, Joel Campbell (Spader) moved all the way to Chicago in order to escape his past, and even retired from the FBI.
Now David (Reeves) is back in Joel's life, sending him pictures of victims a day before they are to be murdered. He has twenty-four hours to find them before David does.
What a great premise. A pleasant twist on the serial killer routine, right? Err...no, not really. The direction feels like a long action-packed music video--from the opening titles blaring a loud Rob Zombie song to the end, complete with the stereotypical Killer's Point of View that was original in 1978 when John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" first invented it (and when it was indeed a very controversial filmmaking technique), but is now getting old since it's frequently being used incorrectly, particularly in the case of ""The Watcher."" Keanu's character seems to see things through some type of strobe music video vision--perhaps that explains his love of music in the film. ""This is a good song,"" he says to one victim before strangling her.
In all honesty, ""The Watcher"" isn't really a truly ""bad"" movie (in fact, I've seen much worse), but if I had to pinpoint the problems with ""The Watcher,"" it would be these three things:
1. Direction. Joe Charbanic, a first-time director with his outing in ""The Watcher,"" proves that he should never get behind a camera ever again. As I mentioned before, there are just too many moments when I felt that I was watching some music video or product placement commercial instead of a smart serial killer film. Some people just aren't meant to get behind the wheel of a moving car. The same goes for a moving reel of footage.
2. The Script. What starts interesting and even compelling soon turns into a routine chase-the-killer film with extravagant car chases and bad character introductions. (Marisa Tomei's student psychiatrist is obviously there for two reasons--to fall in love with the hero and to be kidnapped by the villain. Take a wild guess if it happens or not.) In fact, this film had loads of potential to stand out amongst the rest of its kind by using the original plot--twenty-four hours to find the victim--but it is soon left forgotten and too many plot holes (why wouldn't the victim see herself on TV or on one of the millions of ads placed around Chicago?) are left unchecked.
3. The Acting. James Spader is at the very least marginally convincing as a gruff I-Don't-Care-Anymore cop, but he's no Martin Riggs. Instead, he comes off as a whiny, selfish little creep who likes to inject drugs into his body to get a momentary high. This is are hero, folks.
Also, is Keanu an invincible boogeyman or not? Lord knows that his mysterious character, David, is untouchable--he survives a foot chase without being seen, he manages to sneak past security cameras and cops and manages to kidnap/kill female victims; he survives a truly ludicrous car chase (that lowered my score for the film by a half a notch), gets shot, caught on fire, and STILL manages to jump out of a window on fire and into a lake? I half expected him to get up once more and give us all one last scare. Honestly, in ""Halloween,"" the insinuations of Michael Myers' invincibility were more than hinted at. Here, we are left to wonder whether or not the killer is some type of supernatural force or not. The film is too eager to wrap all the loose ends up without digging deeper into the material.",1073952000,3,5592,4.678172588832488
1269605,2,B00003CXND,Reeves makes this one work with his serial killer mood but Spader lets this one fall as the cop in search for him. and the movie runs out of steam after awhile but seeing Reeves with his piano wire and the finale is worth watching.,1070236800,,231,4.155555555555556

""The Watcher"" by Joe Charbanic is a quite good thriller with parallels from ""Seven"" and ""The Bone Collector"" (both are better though). The use of some camcorder pictures and video-clip editing adds some speed and atmosphere to the movie, but these things don't make the weak end better.

If you can look past the lousy acting from him as the psychopath who strangles young women with piano wire, you'll be satisfied after watching this. It was an okay movie with a definite flaw. Keanu is just not intimidating, and couldn't portray a person who would be. The Watcher was entertaining, and James Spader carried it well. It had some intense scenes, and an interesting plot which made it somewhat worthwhile. I certainly would not and will not add it to my DVD collection though. There wasn't really anything that stood out to me that was any different or more unique than any other thriller I've seen. It was average. I would not recommend that children see it though. Its R rating reflects violence (including some gruesome aftermaths of bloody killings) and continuous (and pointless) profanity.

I could not help but feel sympathy for the hopelessly depressed and drugged central character. Marissa Tomei is also featured, acting well and looking very lovely without being sickeningly pretty, and coming off as both intelligent and caring in her part as psychologist to the battered protagonist. Three cheers for casting a competent and compelling actress in the lead female role. Keanu Reeves is satisfactorily creepy in his role as the killer (no spoilers, I promise, the viewer knows who the killer is from the beginning). The plot was a bit typical to the serial killer suspense genre, but nonetheless entertaining, and I did not lose interest at any point during the movie. Suspense was built up nicely and there was a pleasant element of continuity to the plot which made it quite easy to follow. There are a lot of flashbacks, which are a bit more drawn out than they need to be, but three more cheers for building up a background to this story. Technical aspects of the DVD were all satisfactory to me. In conclusion, this film was basically average but I give it four stars because when I ask myself, ""Did I have a good time watching this movie?"" my answer is, ""Yes.""",1046563200,4,1337,4.767241379310345

1269682,4,B00003CXND,"Now this is what we need more of; pretty boy actors renowned for nice guy roles taking a walk off the beaten commercial path to explore darker subject matter.
In Joe Charbanic's twisted little pressure cooker of a movie The Watcher, Keanu Reeves not only wandered into seriously more disturbing material, he took a tent with him, threw away the compass and camped comfortably in it, the results of which include a transformation that's as far away from Neo, his Matrix alter ego, as humanly possible. It's plausible that The Chosen One himself might have turned tail and fled if ever faced with Keanu's chillingly charismatic 'Watcher'(the killer of this piece), whether he knew Kung Fu or not.
Publicly violated and torn apart frame by bloody frame by the critics upon release, The Watcher, ironically enough, should be thankful that the reviews were so scathing. All this highly inaccurate reviewing does is further serve to lower your guard for what becomes a truly tense and highly strung game of cat and mouse. Taking the classic story of nemesis and cop and training a television camera on it, Reeves portrays David Allen Griffin, a smartly dressed and suave individual with a penchant for strangling young single woman with piano wire. After feeling abandoned by the FBI agent Joel Campbell (played with praise-worthy restraint by the impeccable James Spader) who was assigned to his case and who Griffin has come to admire and, in a way, almost depend upon to give his vocation validity in the grand scheme of things, Griffin relocates to Chicago in order to pick up on their unique relationship afresh, news that awakens a buried dread within the distraught and regretful Campbell. It's only a matter of time before Griffin is, once again, rendering his piano unplayable, dragging Campbell once more into a nightmarish paranoid world where every second counts.
Charbanic's tale presents the unfolding events from an original and distinctive perspective, one that lends itself admirably to the director's strengths. Namely, the media. With the superb inclusion of Griffin 'willing to try and make things work' between himself and Campbell by sending the agent photographs of the targeted victim and allowing the police twenty four hours to locate her, it serves as the perfect motive for the movie to truly tighten the tension screws which it succeeds in doing in excruciatingly spectacular fashion. The plot weaves tighter and tighter like Griffin's piano wire as by each murder, we witness Campbell's deterioration as the horrifying realisation that he may not be capable of saving the victims becomes an increasingly real sensation, a matter touched upon in a beautifully downplayed sombre moment between Campbell and his counsellor, played with admirable strength and vulnerability by Oscar winner Marisa Tomei.
Add to this stew the wonderfully haunting score, the truly shocking yet undeniably sylish violence and decidedly unsettling cinematography and you begin to wonder why The Watcher was ever so persecuted in the first place. Ignore the critics and don't go home alone. Take The Watcher with you.",1045440000,4,3116,5.14792899408284

1269686,2,B00003CXND,"The Watcher is one of those movies where you might find yourself thinking of what it might have been. The basis of a nifty little thriller is there, but in the hands of director Joe Charbanic, the story never flowers. There are all sorts of ultra chic film techniques and editing tricks. These are interesting enough to watch. They demonstrate that the visual arts still have some unchartered territory. In this case they also serve to emphasis the fact that the film is all style and no substance.
FBI agent Joel Campbell [James Spader] moves from Los Angeles to Chicago after a shattering experience in which his girlfriend becomes a victim of the same serial killer Campbell has been looking for. The man is now a wreck. He takes pills for depression and anxiety and must often inject himself with a drug for his crippling migraine headaches. He is seeing a therapist named Polly [Marisa Tomei]. One day Joe comes home to find police swarming around the apartment below his. A girl has been murdered. After an agonizing night of nightmares and migraines, Joe gets around to opening his mail the next morning. There is a FedEx package which contains photos of his murdered neighbor. He realizes that the killer he pursed in L. A. has come to Chicago. And what comes next is a gruesome game in which the hunter becomes the hunted and is taunted in the same way the police sometimes do to a criminal at large. Joe receives more photos and has twenty-four hours in each case to save the victim.
This truly could have been a taunt and suspenseful movie, if the director hadn't dropped the ball so often. Elements that start off interesting wind up going nowhere. For example, much is made by the therapist about how much Joe and the killer, David [Keanu Reeves], need each other, but no valid explanation of this codependency is ever offered. No reason is offered for David's doing the things he does nor is there anything about his character or mannerisms to hint at a motive.
James Spader gives us a great performance, but because Keanu Reeves has to work at being creepy and Spader doesn't, it might have been better if they had traded roles. I have always enjoyed Reeves's taking roles that are a stretch or a risk for him, but I have decided that he is successful commercially and artistically only in action hero epics like Speed and The Matrix.

  Very sad. It could have been so much more, it looked to be so much more and then it just lost the plot. It was quite gripping until the explosions started.

1269751,2,B00003CXND,"James Spader is an often underappreciated talent who usually manages to enhance whatever film he takes part in. The Watcher is another film that fits into that niche.
The movie itself is typical. Just another under cooked thriller with very little meat on it's bones. Spader does manage to elevate the film with his tortured but not overdone performance. His emotional struggle seems compelling despite the relative been there done that factor of everything else about this movie.
He helps make the search for the potential of Keanu Reeves stalker seem somewhat intriguing, even if we can already predict the outcome.
Unfortunately he can't save this film from utter ordinariness. Keanu Reeves makes a poor villian. Even though I've always found him likable, (and a better actor that he's usually given credit for), he just hard to take him seriously in this role. The film also manages to be slightly annoying. The directors had there early experience in music videos and it shows. During any scene that's supposed to be suspensful, they overload the screen with creative and flashy cinematography. There are weird slow motion and blur effects straight out of what you might have watched on MTV the night before. All this just manages to drain any sense of dread out of the proceedings.
All of this would have been a little less obvious if the ending had atleast been decent. To bad that's just not the case. Eventually the filmmakers seem like they decided to wrap things up before they actually needed to.  We are rushed to an abrupt and easy conclusion after Reeves kidnaps Marisa Tomei's pshychiatrist character. On a side note, Tomei is out of place here to, any actress could have played this nondescript and thankless role. I won't tell you what happens but suffice to say it's very little. Any strength the film had built up to that point is just neglected. Somebody at the studio must have decided production was taking to long. Or those making the film just decided they didn't care anymore. All in all, instantly forgetable.

I found it to be frightening & beautiful at the same time when I watched this for about the fourth or fifth time. Plus Keanu's character was really freaky in the way he becomes emotionally & psychologically attached to James Spader's character due to the fact that K's character believes that he and James Spader's character need each other. Also,I found James Spader's character is beautiful, but mysterious in why he is so burned-out and emotionally troubled  & what is his connection with this mystery woman, who we don't know about until later, was  very appealing to me.

1269788,2,B00003CXND,"Although clich-ridden unoriginal serial killer ""thrillers"" are conveyored as canned tuna now, I've not seen one so dull and insipid (and boasting two popular male leads) in months. I wonder how other reviewers find this flick full of suspense and good performances (well, it depends with whom you compare, of course. The world has seen worse, certainly. ""Return of killing tomatoes"", for example).
J Spader used to be a good actor, but he's nothing to do here besides faking migraines (unpersuasively) and acting completely out of FBI-protocol and sane person's mind. Why K Reeves was cast as the serial killer here escapes my understanding: besides having black hair and black eyes (attributes hinting at his maliciousness, no doubt), he's ridiculous dancing in slo-mo in front of his victims, harassing the detective and voicing his text with as much pomp as you can withstand. Also please tell me who decided that heavy panting of him behind the frame augments the tension?
Although the plot follows the well-trodden lane of such flicks, the facts and details are thrown at the viewer chaotically, probably supposing he'll accept everything (hate this concept!). M Tomei's character serves the only purpose she can have in such a movie, but her involvement with Spader (besides the fact that she's his shrink) is so poor and unemotional, no one cares about her. The preposterous last 20 minutes will not fail your worst expectations (if by that time you haven't switched your VCR).

The one bad thing is that Keanu is in it and I'm not prepared to admit that, yes he is a good phsyco.  He is supposidly a bad actor but he can also play a good Christ character in Matrix and a good lawyer in Devil's Advocate.  And he is awful at acting but can play these roles well, and they're diverse roles. There are same major things that you need to realize when you watch this movie.  I came in giving it 2 stars, but after seeing it I loved it.  My mom hated (3 weeks before I saw it) it until I told her this information: James Spader's lover that got killed by Keanu was an affair he was having.  This is the only woman he has loved.  Reeves is the only connection to the woman DONT READ ON IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET and he can't kill him because of that. The picture they flash up on the screen for Jane Doe 3 at the end wasn't of Mira Sorvino, but of the woman who Spader had an affair with.  And that's how he knew to go the grave.  It was cool touch. Spader had been living in the past.  That's why spader couldn't kill Reeves.

The premise sounded intriguing enough; James Spader is a burned out  Los Angeles detective who had let serial killer Keanu Reeves slip through his fingers. Now, some time later and in Chicago, Spader begins to receive pictures of new potential victims that Keanu is ""watching"". This sets off a cat and mouse game of, ""can Spader get to the girls in time before Keanu strangles them with piano wire""? Oh, one more thing: Marissa Tomei has the thankless role of playing Spader's therapist, and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out she's gonna be the ultimate victim. Here's the thing; I love a good thriller, ""Silence of the Lambs"", ""Copycat"". This ain't one of them. It asks the viewer to leave all common sense at the door. When the city is alerted to the fact there's a serial killer loose, and they show a picture  on the news of his targeted victim (who works in a shopping mall photo shop),no one happens to call. Excusing the fact there are cops who know what she looks like streaming through the mall. This bit of celluloid pulp makes the Chicago P.D. look like the biggest group of idiots going. Eventually Spader and Reeves have what's supposed to be their big standoff, but the director has Spader playing it so cool we never fear for him. There's no threat at all so consequently no tension. Frankly I've seen more nail biting episodes of ""Murder She Wrote"".There's also never any explanations of why Keanu is smitten with Spader. Just some quick speech about them being each other's ""yin and yang"". Yet no explanation of why he kills or why Spader.

The relationship between Keanu and Spader are natural and convincing. I like Keanu in the ""Bad Guy"" role; he puts his laid-back style into the role and totally sells it. I've read some reviews that knock his performance here, I obviously don't agree! His laid back style is a breath of fresh air from the ""off the wall, over energetic, borderline spastic"" killers that we usually see in this kind of role. In fact, Keanu's demeanor makes the character even that much more spooky! That being said, I do agree that James Spader is the shinning star here. Spader, as the ""burnt out"" Cop on the verge of a stroke, is painful to watch (in a good way), Spader makes you feel the pain and stress that his character feels. Marisa Tomei does an ample job at playing her role, the fact that the role she portrays isn't really a factor until the end of the movie, she does the job of keeping the character at the level it was meant to be at. Yes this movie has been done before, a few times in fact, but the combination of Spader and Reeves gives it a new face.  For my fellow Home Theater owners, this movie is fun to watch. There is great base and crisp highs; explosions will surely give your subs a workout! My only knock of this movie is the over use of (what is considered by today's standard) hip music. When the scene seems to call for suspenseful music, all of a sudden the rap/rock type of music starts (Stigmata had this same problem), but if you can look (or listen) past that, this is a great flick to watch and own.",983923200,36,1658,4.365695792880259
1269873,2,B00003CXND,"The Watcher (Joe Charbanic/Keff Jensen, 2000)

This movie disappeared from theaters quick, and now I know why. Despite a fairly good performance from Keanu Reeves, who goes back to the days of playing the disaffected sociopaths that made him great (River's Edge, Permanent Record), this film straddles the line between confusion and predictability with a deftness I've rarely seen even from the most incompetent veteran directors. Charbanic and Jensen are to be commended for achieving Russ Meyer status on their very first try.

Joel Campbell (James Spader) had a breakdown after he saved his married girlfriend (Yvonne Niami) from a serial killer he'd been tracking in Los Angeles for years. Unfortunately, she still dies, as a direct result of his clumsiness (watch the film a couple of times, you'll figure out how to put all these pieces together... I think). Campbell moved to Chicago in order to be near her grave and get away from the job for a while, and now spends his time taking huge amounts of antipsychotics and living on disability pay. Of course, the serial killer (Reeves) follows him, and the game begins again.

Reeves-- and Ernie Hudson in a minor role as Spader's supervisor-- give the only two performances in this movie that can be called emotional without cracking a smile. Spader and female lead Marisa Tomei, playing his therapist, both seem to sleepwalk through the movie. A better performance by both might have turned this into at least a serviceable thriller, but that's not what we got. **",983923200,4,1520,4.9763779527559056

1269919,3,B00003CXND,"This psychological thriller doesn't quite come together due to various flaws in the script and poor orchestration by a rookie director.  Director Joe Charbanic's prior experience is with music videos.  This is his first feature film.  It is reported that he landed the project at the recommendation of Keanu Reeves, who liked his work.  As is the case with many music video directors, Charbanic is extremely creative with the camera.  He uses innovative camera angles, close-ups, jump cuts and strobe photography very effectively.  Along with veteran cinematographer Michael Chapman (""Taxi Driver"", ""Raging Bull"", ""Rising Sun"", ""Primal Fear""), he brings some very compelling imagery to the screen.  However, this is only part of the director's job.  He must also pull the story together and eliminate any inconsistencies from the script.  Most importantly, he must get the actors to properly interpret their characters.  In these areas, Charbanic is far less capable and it hurts the film.
The initial workup is intriguing.  David Allen Griffin (Keanu Reeves) is a serial killer who has developed an obsession with Joel Campbell (James Spader), the cop who has been pursuing him.  When the cop retires from the force on disability and moves to Chicago, the killer follows and resumes the killings there to torment his adversary.  Griffin sends Campbell pictures of his victims in advance and dares him to try to find them before he kills them.  The story is fairly tight to this point, but unravels totally after Griffin lures Campbell to a graveyard and they meet face to face.  From this point forward, the absurdities are piled on to the point of silliness.
The acting is problematic.  Keanu Reeves is an excellent actor, but he is miscast as the killer.  He is just too nice a guy to be a sociopath.  Actually, it probably would have been better if they flipped the leads because Spader would have made a very believable killer.  Spader is excellent at portraying Campbell's decaying life, but his portrayal is wrong for the action roles.  Normally dynamic and energetic, Marisa Tomei seems almost comatose in her dialogue with Spader during the therapy scenes, although she is great as the terrified victim after being abducted.  The entire cast seems flat and subdued especially for a thriller, the responsibility for which I put with Charbanic.  While Charbanic's images crackle, the actors are soggy.  Although images are important in a suspense thriller, they cannot make up for flaccid performances.

1269922,2,B00003CXND,"Though The Watcher may be a very fun popcorn flick, it's missing some key ingredients in the make-up of a good thriller.  The characters are flat, the acting is lame, the storyline is inconsistent and the plausibility, well there is none.  Yet having written all that I can't say that this movie is really that bad.  Afterall, it's hour and a half running time zips by faster than most forty minute episodes of CSI.
Keanu Reeves, despite being burried in the credits, is the star of this film as serial killer David Allen Griffith.  He's a watcher (thus the title) who targets introverted young women and strangles them with a piano wire.  And as it turns out his greatest pleasure is not in perpetrating the act itself but in the torment he inflicts on the federal agent working his case.
James Spader (as intense as ever) plays Joel Campbell, the L.A. lawman and object of this killers twisted obsession.  But when push comes to shove Joel cracks under the pressure and moves to Chicago to get away from the killings, only to discover months later that his past has caught up with him.
David follows him to the Windy City and begins sending him pictures of his intended victims, daring him to try and find them before he strikes again.  By doing this he imposes onto Joel the pain of having had the opportunity to save these girls lives only to blame himself when he fails.  It's actually a pretty clever premise but is executed is such a way that the filmmakers seem more intent on going through the motions than having fun with the concept.
As the story continues to unravel, we're introduced in passing to Joel's psychatrist, who because she's played by Marisa Tomei, we know will play a large part in the film's conclusion.  It's only too obvious and first time director Joe Charbanic seems intent on letting his audience get ahead of him.  That's the movie's biggest flaw, that it tips it's hat too soon and, conversely, can't manage to build suspense.  As we're engaged in a race-against-time car chase we already know what's going to happen because the killer can't very well be caught an hour into the picture.
I suspect this is material that would have been better suited to a veteran director and some tweaking in the casting department.  Reeves' over-the-top performance is at times chilling but mostly ridiculous.  He seems to shy away from the underlying homosexual themes of his character's relationship with Spader's.  That wouldn't have been a bad thing necessarily except that was his only interesting characteristic.
Marisa Tomei on the other hand, is subdued in her performance,  a role seemingly custom-made for Lorraine Bracco to reprise her role on The Sopranos.  It's obviously been too long since My Cousin Vinney, for which she won the Oscar for (and deserved it too).  I only hope she has more discretion when it comes to choosing future projects.
And she's not even the only actor to have their talents put to waste.  Ernie Hudson is reduced to a bit part here, and even when he does manage to elbow his way onto the screen for some face time, it's usually just to clench his jowl and look angry.  Chris Ellis is another one, an actor good enough to go unnoticed in box office hits like Armageddom and Godzilla, but this time is saddled with lines of dialogue so bad he's practically got a bullseye painted on his back.
I can't help but admit I found this movie at least mildly entertaining.  Still, for all it's good qualities there are a half dozen bad ones and I can't in good conscious recommend it when such contemporary classics as Manhunter and Vampires Kiss have gone widely unwatched.

""The Watcher"" is the most recent addition to a long line of serial killer thriller films, and it does a somewhat commendable job in carrying out its plot. In reality, it is little more than a highly stylized showcase for all of the classic thriller cliches that have become so well-known throughout the last century, taking them and giving them an extra flare by using stunning cinematic tricks, a stellar cast and a pounding soundtrack. I am divided as to whether I like this movie or not: I enjoyed the vast array of shocking and vivid images, while I tended to become a bit bored by the cliches it portrayed throughout. I can't say that I completely hated this film, yet I cannot fully like it, either.
The movie begins when FBI agent Joel Campbell begins receiving phone calls and photographs from his arch nemesis, a serial killer whose last alias was that of David Allen Griffin. He takes special care in killing lonely women with piano wire, leaving the scene of the crime with no trace of his identity. Campbell has a personal connection to Griffin: through his flashbacks, we see his attempt to rescue a woman trapped in a burning house, and his relationship to this woman as well as his involvement with Griffin will all be revealed in due time, one of the movie's attributes. The beginning of the movie may seem draggy the first fifteen minutes, as we are taken into the depths of Campbell's psychological and physical problems, but the movie will pick up once Griffin makes contact.
We learn that Griffin has followed Campbell to Chicago from Los Angeles, out of some desire unknown to the audience. Campbell's therapist, Polly Beilman, believes that they have become so enamored with one another, the killer with eluding Campbell, and Campbell with catching his prey, that one would not know how to live without the other. Campbell receives a phone call from Griffin, who offers him a single chance to locate his victims within a 24-hour period of time. As he begins selecting his victims, the chase is on as Campbell picks up more clues and hints as to the location and identity of Griffin.
Sounds good, right? So what is it about this thriller that partially ruins it? For me, it was the extensive amount of cliches that the movie contains, from the very beginning until the ending, which is a little unsatisfying. The movie contains its fair share of bungling cops who always arrive one minute too late to save the victim from their grizzly fate. This leaves it up to one man, the only smart one of the bunch, to try and decifer all the clues on his own, temporarily aided in scenes where he needs it. This formula has been used so many times, it's a bit of a letdown that script writers David Elliot and Clay Ayers could not come up with something more original.
There is one of two good things about this movie, though, and that is its sense of style and filming techniques. The beginning sequences does a good job of instilling a slight sense of fear in the viewers, which is also carried on throughout the remainder of the film by the flashy cinematography which includes the grainy images as seen from Griffin's point of view, slow-motion flashbacks that leave us to use our imaginations when constructing crime scenes, and fast-moving scenes during intense action sequences. There is an offbeat vision and sensory style to this film which allows it to rise out of the depths of film hell. The soundtrack also adds a lot of pulsating bass beats to add to the unease intended by the filmmakers, while also delivering a killer soundtrack of alternative music to accompany the pursuits.
This movie is also not unlike one of Reeves' others films, ""Chain Reaction,"" which contained some of the best action sequences while possessing a faulty story. The case for this movie is similar, as there is another stunning cavalcade of action effects and suspense-building scenes. The cops-versus-Griffin chase scenes offer a lot in terms of suspense, while also keeping the movie going at a steady pace. Another turnon for the film is the way in which the murder scenes are carried out. There is not a vast amount of blood or gore in these scenes, which allows us to use more of our imagination in putting it together as it happens. I like it when a movie is able to do this, instead of taking gore and passing it off as art.
Actors for ""The Watcher"" deliver quality performances that make the movie enjoyable. James Spader plays the delusional detective Joel Campbell, and he does a perfect job in delivering Campbell's emotions when it comes to pursuing his target. We are able to believe in his not wanting to give up despite the effects it may have on him physically and emotionally. Spader plays Campbell as a stern and aggressive character, the character to root for throughout. Keanu Reeves plays his rival, David Allen Griffin, and does one of his better acting jobs here. This is material he was born to play... he possesses wit and a certain twisted charm that is intrical to Griffin's character, and that makes him a better serial killer than most other movies. Oscar winner Marisa Tomei plays therapist Polly Beilman, though she is not really able to display a lot of her talent in this film, as it focuses mainly on the two leads and their physical and psychological battle with one another.
I give ""The Watcher"" three stars on the basis of its cinematography, its acting, its action sequences, and its unrealized potential. The story does leave a lot to be desired in terms of originality, but it can be a lot of fun if you don't think too much about it. The fast pace of the film never hinders, and the actors never fail in giving us performances to cheer for. We almost wish we could extract the characters and place them in a different movie, but nonetheless, it remains enjoyable on a strictly basic level.",982713600,6,6060,4.6539179104477615

And as you watch you will notice how many scenes a stand in is playing Keanu's part....the car chases, the scenes where he is running away.  It makes me wonder if he just promised to film a certain number of minutes in the film and then they had to use a stand in who look like Reeves from the back.
That said, it's a Keanu movie so of course I watched the whole thing.  Go ahead and watch it but don't spend your hard earned cash.",1518652800,,558,3.955357142857143

If Hollywood wasn't so convinced names sell movies, maybe they'd discover that solid acting will bring audiences to the theaters just as well. Maybe better.",1510358400,,403,5.2153846153846155
