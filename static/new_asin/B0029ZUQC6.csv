8358777,4,B0029ZUQC6,"The same actors that were in Johnnie To's crime drama movie PTU are in the Tactical Unit series. There are several films in this series but Tactical Unit Comrades in Arms is my favorite of the series. This particular film takes place in a remote,hilly, forested area outside of Hong Kong so that makes it a rather different location than most HK crime dramas occur in.  The tactical unit runs into all kinds of different difficulties from getting lost and injured, no cell phone service, to a surprise encounter with a mad man who is painting ""world peace"" in calligraphy graffiti on what looks like the remnants of a World War 2 bunker.  The unit chases the robbers they are hunting through a concrete tunnel which also seems like a relic perhaps left over from the Japanese invasion of Hong Kong. Lots of action (knives and guns)and fatigue as the police try to locate the robbers in the dense forest. It ends with a typical, no holds barred, Johnnie To type shoot out at a church in a small village. I really enjoyed it.  For those who want total over the top action and non stop violence this is probably not your movie but for a Hong Kong crime drama filmed in a very different location with some surprise scenes and action you might enjoy this little gem.  I give it 4 very solid stars. Simon Yam is excellent once again.  Enjoy!",1335225600,,1335,4.5
