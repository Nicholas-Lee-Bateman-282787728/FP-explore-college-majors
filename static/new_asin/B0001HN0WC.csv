Long before `Memoirs of a Geisha' gave the Western World a glimpse into the exotic life of the Japanese courtesan in '05, the Indian film industry opened the doors of the courtyard and allowed us to step into the inner sanctum of an urban brothel in the insightful '83 film `Mandi.' Boasting a superior cast containing some of India's best; Shabana Azmi, Smita Patil, Saeed Jaafrey, Naseeruddin Shah and Om Puri, this is surely a film worth viewing.

The acting is excellent, the camera work and sets superior and the music alluring. If that isn't enough to keep your attention for 163 minutes just set your gaze on the enchanting Shabana Azmi or the lovely Smita Patil. If you enjoy Indian films and what to go a little deeper into the culture than what's usually provided in most recent Bollywood films this one is definitely for you.",1178236800,4,873,4.7368421052631575

Anyway, I loved that movie and I encourage all to see it. It also contains a few gems, like ubergorgeous Neena Gupta singing ghazal ""shamashiir barahanaa maa. Ng Gazab"" (written by the last moghul of India, Bahadur Shah Zafar) while dancing gracefully and oh-so seductively in the enchanting Kathak style. Aaaaah, I'm in heaven...",1147132800,5,522,4.747252747252747
