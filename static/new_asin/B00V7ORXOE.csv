7077173,5,B00V7ORXOE,if you played Neptunia on PS3 or PSVita you must watch this show! It takes most of it's events from the three PS3 games. This is one of the funniest anime ever.,1434931200,2,160,4.03125
7077174,5,B00V7ORXOE,"Have you played the series on PS3 and Vita? It doesn't matter because this anime is a new story of its own and is great for fans of the series. This anime has fan service just like the games. Boobs and ass all over, but overall the story is good and funny. Give it a shot. It is cheaper here than on funimation.",1434326400,4,311,3.9523809523809526
7077175,5,B00V7ORXOE,Funny. lots of in-jokes about the gaming world,1434240000,,46,4.875
7077176,5,B00V7ORXOE,"Glad I was finally able to order this. If you like the games you'll definitely like this box set. Very pleased with the detail of the box and also; like most Funimation box sets, the cases have reversible covers.",1434153600,38,212,4.461538461538462
7077177,5,B00V7ORXOE,"I love the video games, and now I love the anime. If you expected the Neptune from the game with her quirky, funny, and lazy nature then you won't be disappointed. Even newcomers to hyperdimension will like it, it's really funny, has a great art style that stays true to the games, and I would recommend any fan of anime pick this up at some point.",1433894400,14,348,4.287878787878788
7077178,5,B00V7ORXOE,"Utterly hilarious, and definitely worth it, especially if you're a fan of the series. Even if you're not, this isn't a bad way to give the series a shot. The set also includes the previously-unaired-outside-of-Japan episode 13, so that's a REALLY nice bonus!",1433808000,9,258,5.023255813953488

7077191,5,B00V7ORXOE,"If you are a fan of the game series, buying this is obvious. Great box art and having both DVD and Blu Ray is great! The episodes are well performed and written. Same voice actors from the games and the English dub is really good for an anime.",1503532800,2,243,4.083333333333333

7077196,5,B00V7ORXOE,"I am so amazed at the difference BluRay makes. 1080p Neptunia is good~
Visuals aside, this is an amazing anime that is captivating with its humor and satirical storyline. You don't need to necessarily play the games to understand it but it helps. I love the games and this boxset just made it so much better.",1487635200,,308,4.517857142857143

7077199,5,B00V7ORXOE,I have seen many anime in my life and I have pretty high expectations for them. I will admit that this was an amazing anime. I loved the comedic element that helped mellow out the action scenes perfectly. I would immediately recommend this to anyone who is a fan of anime.,1484006400,,272,4.352941176470588
7077200,5,B00V7ORXOE,"extremely fast shipping. The over all anime was also very good with tons of video game references, loveable characters, and fun universe this anime is a must have for gamers (especially fans of the Neptuneia series) and lovers if moe anime",1480723200,,239,4.853658536585366
7077201,5,B00V7ORXOE,"Neptunia has always been a good series of video games and now seing the characters act out their daily lives in anime only sweetens the deal. I watch it now and again, but the jokes never get old for me and the humor fits right up my alley.",1473120000,,240,4.020833333333333
7077202,5,B00V7ORXOE,"A great anime, with the same kind of humor as the games. The story, though, could have been better. The anime tries to mix the stories of the second and third games, with alright success. While the story isn't great, this is definitely worth the money if you're a fan of the series.",1472169600,4,282,4.339622641509434

7077206,5,B00V7ORXOE,"After playing a couple of the Neptunia games and watching countless LPs of it, I stumbled upon this little beauty's existence and I just had to have it.
Great laughs and just a wonderful experience for any Neptunia fan. And what makes the Animation unique in it's own way is that it takes elements from several different installments and implements them into it's own spin on them. So it's kinda like watching a completely different adventure with the characters that you loved in the games.",1467849600,,491,4.788235294117647

7077219,3,B00V7ORXOE,It's actually rated tv 14 so there's no nudity (disappointing) but it is sexy. I also found that the first season of sailormoon was funnier than this and it's hard to see more than one episode at a time from the boredom alone.,1452038400,,226,4.27906976744186

7077230,5,B00V7ORXOE,"This Anime Series features Neptune and the other girls of Neptunia trying to get along and have peace between the gaming box type Lands. Each of them represent a Land based off real Consoles, Nintendo, Xbox and the likes.

This anime was based off the Games, I never got the games as of yet. But the games and this Anime series all have great graphics, and Loads of Fan Service such as Armor that breaks off, and situations that are more adult oriented.

This whole anime series from the very start is nothing but beautiful Moe based art that leaves you wanting more. Even with all the Fan Service directed at boys, I recommend anyone to watch this if they want to see what it would be like for Friends to live in a video game. Lots of Trouble, Danger and even more so Adventure. And their sisters get involved too so its lots of family fun for everyone. As the older sisters get into trouble its up to the younger ones to Power Up their CPU selves and Save their Sisters from potential Destruction from the evil Arfoire.

Join Purple Heart aka Neptune, and  her friends on this Delightful Bluray Anime Series. Only thing that could make this better is a Sequal or 2.",1439164800,11,1167,4.413953488372093

7077236,5,B00V7ORXOE,All I have to say is that this anime is way too funny even more funny then the games I have whached it at least 3 times already and it will never get u bored I really highly recommend it if your a huge fan!!!!!!!,1437264000,4,212,3.7333333333333334
7077237,5,B00V7ORXOE,I only feverish go to my Megami's church every sunday! I actually really enjoy the series. Specially the interactions between Neptune and Noire! The story was actually pretty cool (I love how they're always breaking the 4th wall and making fun of the gaming industry). Kinda glad that it's an original anime and didn't spoiled the events of HyperDimension Neptunia Re;birth 2 and 3. If you like the games then the anime is a no brainer,1437004800,5,435,4.7368421052631575
7077238,5,B00V7ORXOE,i love the seires of hyperdimension neptunia its an amazing game series  like how they're all based on the game consoles we have now and back then also i like green heart aka vert also can i make the anime english from the bluray menu,1436659200,2,234,4.2
8709511,5,B00V7ORXOE,"I love the Neptunia games, it is quite seriously my all time favorite video game franchise. This cartoon is a fun reflection of the characters in the games and I really enjoyed it. The animation is good, the English voices are lively, and the situations the CPUs and their sisters get put in can range from hysterical to heartrending. If you already know and like these characters, it's a special treat to see them fully animated and dealing with other scenarios separate from the games' plots.
However, if you haven't played the first three games (Hyperdimension Neptunia, Mk2, and V) you may not be able to take as much away from it. It's a really fun anime, but it does feel tailored to appeal more to fans of the games as opposed to casual viewers. And that's not necessarily a bad thing, it's just something to keep in mind.
Also, if you're planning on playing the games, go ahead an get this for later, but don't watch it before finishing Hyperneptunia V (the 3rd and arguably best game of the series), as it'll spoil some of the best parts of that game's story.",1532908800,,1068,4.538860103626943
8709512,4,B00V7ORXOE,It's a fine anime for being Neptunia related. Don't expect a whole lot in story though,1532390400,,86,4.4375
8709513,4,B00V7ORXOE,"First, let's look at the technical side of Hyperdimension Neptunia the Animation. So, the only thing truly wrong with this set is the volume drops that occur whenever scenes change or any loud sound happens. It doesn't matter if you use the DVD or Blu-ray disks, the volume drops to nothing when a scene changes or when there is a loud noise in the show and slowly comes back up thanks to overzealous use of Dolby noise reduction. An excellent example is when the opening credits start. the music is considered ""noise"" and muffles it, when the vocals kick in the Dolby noise reduction gradually increases the volume and reaches normal by the middle of the second verse! By the way, it is not my set up, I tried it on three different systems with all kinds of tweaks to the audio settings. This is what happens when stupid people make DVDs and I hope they got fired. Since they are tone deaf,  they should get a job in an atrillary testing factory. I never liked Dolby noise reduction anyway. It's really good for cassette tape hiss but is there any real reason it exists on modern digitally recorded audio? Okay enough of that rant. The DVDs look okay, Blu-ray disks are better.

Now let's review the series itself. Hyperdimension Neptunia the Animation is an attempt to smash about 24 episodes of content into 13 episodes. There's a good plot here, but much of it is not fleshed out enough to make it truly compelling. You want to care but so much is missing that it makes more emotional scenes or climaxes to plot points fall flat. The game series this is based on is a visual novel and RPG combination hybrid. That makes the Animation look shallow in comparison. It would be like playing two of the game's and skipping all the unvoiced cutscenes and only watching the ends of boss battles and just the FMVs.  Now it sounds like I hate the show, but you're wrong. I love it for what it is, as I am a huge Neptunia fan, but  it is a bit of a disappointment coming from the game series. Persona 4 The Animation is the perfect example of how to do things right. So good you don't need to play the game, but compelling you to reconnect your dusty old PS2 to the TV after watching an episode. Again, Hyperdimension Neptunia the Animation is not a bad series, but it isn't the best. Definitely worth a watch, and at under $20 for the full series, it is well worth the money. I still give it a score of 8/10 because I am a fan, but a more realistic score would be 7.5/10 for those unfamiliar to Neptunia and are just looking  for another anime series  to watch. Still better than the bulk of anime out there though.",1531440000,2,2610,4.393374741200828
