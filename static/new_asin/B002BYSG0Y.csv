3902244,4,B002BYSG0Y,"My son is a Mickey Mouse Clubhouse fanatic.  He loves everything Mickey, and we own most of the Clubhouse DVDs.  I like this one because it is a longer feature unlike most of the other DVDs which contain 3 or 4 of the regular episodes you can find on the Disney Channel.  I wish it had stuck closer to the Wonderland storyline, but I suppose that would be more for me than for my son.  If your child likes Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, I am sure they will enjoy this movie.",1254355200,16,467,4.155555555555556
3902245,4,B002BYSG0Y,"This year we've seen Abby Cadaby of ""Sesame Street"" go to the Muppet version of Wonderland, next year we're going to a Tim Burton vision of Wonderland, but right now we can follow Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and the gang down a different sort of rabbit hole.

""Mickey Mouse Clubhouse"" is a CG-animated daytime series for preschoolers on the Playhouse Disney schedule of the Disney Channel. It has some references to the original ""Mickey Mouse Club"" -- a roll call, for example -- but instead of Mouseketeers, Mickey and his pals play a more central role. The stories are simple and involve viewer participation, in the style of ""Dora the Explorer.""

This lengthened episode takes the gang to a gentler version of the Lewis Carroll land, where the characters suggest Mother Goose more than Wonderland and the songs are short ditties. It's nice to see characters like Daisy Duck, Clarabelle Cow and others join the action with Mickey, Goofy and Minnie. Most of all, it gives young children a chance to get to know these characters as something besides merchandise.

The late, great Wayne Allwine is on hand here to voice Mickey, along with his widow, Russi Taylor as Minnie. Recently announced Disney Legends Tony Anselmo and Bill Farmer voice Donald and Goofy, respectively. The program can be played in two modes for different age groups with questions for advanced play. A bonus episode of ""Mickey Mouse Clubhouse"" called ""Goofy Goes Goofy"" rounds out the package.",1253491200,15,1463,4.939024390243903

3902276,4,B002BYSG0Y,"Keeps my daughter entertained and mainly occupied. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because in today's day and age you'd figure that it came with a Disney digital version or UV. It would be a lot more convenient if I could've played it from her tablet then having to bring a portable DVD player just for this. But as for the episodes on here, you have a bonus episode 'Disney Mickey Mouse Clubhouse: Goofy Goes Goofy' which lasts about 24 minutes plus the full length feature of 'Disney Mickey Mouse Clubhouse: Mickey's Adventures In Wonderland' which runs about 1 hour and 20 minutes with the bonus feature it makes for a couple of hours of entertainment for the little one and it's teaching her things like shapes, colors and numbers.

I purchased this item at full price and I can guarantee that the price I paid won't affect the way I review my products, I do this because I base my purchase decisions on reviews and there is nothing worse than getting something other than what you expected based on the reviews you read, so Ill always try to give the facts about the product first followed by my personal opinion. As far as my ratings they are as follows:
5 STARS  I highly recommend this product and I will be purchasing it again myself when I need another one of these as well as I tell my friends and family about it if they need a similar product.
4 STARS  I recommend this product but I feel there is something that could be improved on to make it great. When I recommend this product to someone I warn them of what I feel could be improved upon but normally would purchase again unless someone points me to something better.
3 STARS  I hesitate to recommend this product as I feel its not the best option available. Normally this means it either lacks features or isn't durable so generally doesnt give you a great return on investment. Normally Ill search for something better before I purchase this again.
2 STARS  I don't recommend this product. Either the product is defective (so poor quality control), doesnt function as described or poor customer service.
1 STARS  I recommend staying away from this product. Usually this means Im trying to avoid you the frustration of dealing with poor customer service for a product that is worthless in either function or quality.
If you find my reviews helpful to your purchase, please up-vote.",1471219200,3,2355,4.568720379146919

3902378,5,B002BYSG0Y,"Micky Mouse Club House did it right again. The colors, story line, everything she loves it and only at 15 months! I would recommend all Micky Mouse Club House DVD's, they teach, and always teach good things. Sooner or later they will understand, sharing, being friendly, etc. Believe it or not one episode taught my little girl to hop!!!! She understands the word Hop and she will do the action of hopping!!! I would get these for any child at any age I think, I watch these with my little girl and I catch myself laughing and playing along!!! Great DVD!",1342656000,2,554,4.4950495049504955

Mickey Mouse Clubhouse is excellent for children in the 2-to-3-year-old age range. The videos are fun while being educational. The characters set a great example for how to treat others and yourself so I feel good about buying the videos for my nephew.",1326067200,,414,4.928571428571429

3902386,5,B002BYSG0Y,"My 2-year old niece loves this DVD.  She knows the words by heart and HAS to watch it every time she visits (which is a lot).  Of all the Clubhouse DVD's I think this one is the most educational because it teaches time, shapes, numbers, and size, and social skills, as well as patience.  The DVD does not go into these subjects deeply but are age appropriate for the intended audience.

Now if I could just get the songs ""I'm Goofy hatter"", ""I'm the professor yes I am"", and ""Tick Tock, Tick Tock it's time to fix the coo coo clock"" out of my head I'd be happy!",1292371200,5,561,4.166666666666667

3902388,5,B002BYSG0Y,Mickey's Clubhouse is very entertaining for a soon to be 2yr old. It is also a good tool for learning at this very early age. As a grandmother I highly recommend this for when a busy parent or grandparent needs some quiet time for a toddler.,1272931200,,241,4.260869565217392
3902389,2,B002BYSG0Y,Don't get me wrong I love Mickey and all his friends but something about this movie just drove me bonkers. I being an Alice in Wonderland fanatic bought it hoping it would be something I would love to watch again and again. Maybe it's because I'm not 4? I just didn't like it that much and I don't think I will ever watch it again. Once was definitely enough for me.,1271635200,,366,4.169014084507042

So when I heard about this movie I really wanted to get it for him. He will not sit through any movie, but he will watch this over and over again. Sometimes back to back! I am not a huge TV fan for kids, but this is educational and fun so it is great for every once in a while. My son loves it and I am happy with it too.",1263081600,,442,3.663157894736842
3902392,5,B002BYSG0Y,"My 2-1/2 year old grandson is into ""everything Mickey"" and absolutely loves this video.  It is a compilation of several of the episodes that are shown on the Disney Channel, however, so note that this is *not* new, original, unseen material.",1262563200,,241,4.878048780487805
3902393,5,B002BYSG0Y,"At first I was concerned that there were only two features listed, but the Choo-Choo Adventure is a double length episode, not like the one I had caught on TV several months earlier.

It's typical Mickey Mouse Clubhouse problem solving adventure with some singing to it, so if your young 'un loves that, they are sure to love this. My girl is a train fanatic so this is something we have watched over and over since it arrived in the house. The two Choo-Choo related songs are a big hit with my 2 year old and she loves to dance to them and I'm sure will be singing along in no time. They are catchy, but not annoying.

For anyone who might be bothered, Santa and Mrs. Claus do make an appearance, but Christmas is not being pushed in any way since the 'adventure' takes place during the warmer months, they are just 'along for the ride'.

The Bonus episode is 'Mickey's Big Job' where the gang goes up to help out Willy the Giant while he visits his mother. It's a fun adventure where the gang uses their ballons, which was a toddler hit.",1260316800,,1039,4.317948717948718
3902394,5,B002BYSG0Y,"This movie is perfect for those kids who are just old enough to enjoy something a little longer than the standard 25 minutes of an episode.  The movie keeps their attention, but is long enough to be considered a true movie.  I wish they had more like this.",1257379200,,256,4.3125
