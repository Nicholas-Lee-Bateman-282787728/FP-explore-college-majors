8705807,5,B00UGPP0C2,Love this movie.  It's a must watch for me every once in a while.  Watched the special edition that is included with the theatrical release and saw some scenes that I had never seen before.  Made a big difference in some things that were puzzling in the released version.,1513555200,,271,4.489795918367347
8705808,3,B00UGPP0C2,It's okay.,1506470400,,10,4.5
8705809,5,B00UGPP0C2,I've had both the DVD and Blu-ray versions for years. It's always been one of my favorite movies since it was originally released. Somehow my Blu-ray copy got damaged.,1498003200,,167,4.793103448275862

8705811,1,B00UGPP0C2,"No way on God's green earth will I ever pay $49 for a single movie. I don't give a hoot what features come with it, it could be made of gold for all I care. Just plain utterly stupid",1468108800,,182,3.6923076923076925
8705812,4,B00UGPP0C2,"This science-fictional, action thriller and comedic, romantic drama, starring Jeff Goldblum is one of my favorite Independence Day movies, although Jeff's character in this movie is an unbearable liberal.  Always complaining about smoking or harming the planet.  Then there's his character's boss, who is apparently a homosexul who smoked and drank all day and night every day and night since he was born, by the sound of his effeminate voice.  It made me wonder what homosexual executive producer or casting director he played the quid pro quo game with to get this role.

At the end of the film, everyone around the world unites, including Israelis and Arab military forces, as if that would ever happen!

This film literally shows spear chuckers cheering, a stereotype which should be as offensive as Kelly Osboren asking who would clean Donald Trump's toilets if he were to deport all the latinos.

Then there's Will Smith's significant other, who is a stripper who saves the First Lady's life and tells her not to be sorry she's a stripper, 'cause she's not, and her child is worth it.

I'm still giving this film four stars because it still seems patriotic and inspirational, as indicated by the title.",1467763200,2,1208,4.9504950495049505
