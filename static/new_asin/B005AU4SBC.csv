4641838,4,B005AU4SBC,"It bothers me that this special sometimes gets ignored.  The original Frosty special remains a beloved classic.  CBS continues to show it every Christmas.  But they team it up with the inferior Frosty Returns.  I've only seen that special one time.

  Like the original, Frosty's Winter Wonderland was made by Rankin/Bass.  Jackie Vernon even reprised his role as Frosty.  There's even a girl who looks like his old friend Karen.  (This one has a different name and hair color.)  One possibility for the special's lack of visibility was it originally airing on ABC.  In later years it moved to cable networks.  Thankfully Prime members can currently view it on Amazon Instant Video.

  It's winter again.  The children miss their old friend Frosty.  So they send a letter to the North Pole.  He returns to join them in holiday fun.  But when they go home, he's lonely.  The solution is to make him a wife!  He names her Crystal, voiced by Shelley Winters.  Unfortunately, Jack Frost threatens their marital bliss.

  Some parts will seem familiar to viewers of the original.  We get an adult narrator.  Andy Griffith takes over for Jimmy Durante.  He sings both Frosty the Snowman (with new lyrics incorporating Crystal) and Winter Wonderland.  There's even another bit with the traffic cop.  Another character is Parson Brown, voiced by Dennis Day.  Would the PC crowd allow that now?

  This special still holds up after all these years.  Both young and old will enjoy it.  Of course, we're all kids at Christmastime!  Feel free to watch it at any time.",1483228800,,1555,4.838461538461538

4642417,5,B005AU4SBC,"In a previous review, someone had erroneously mistaken this Rankin/Bass sequel for the Netflix one: The Legend of Frosty the Snowman, with Burt Reynolds, but this one is the true sequel to the Rankin/Bass Special of Frosty the Snowman, narrated by Andy Griffith.

With that said, this one was a rather interesting special because when it aired in 1976, it came out December 2nd, but actually had nothing to do with Christmas, as so much about Winter itself as Frosty returns back to the village which created him.  In this tale, Frosty returns but the children discover he's lonely when they go inside for the night, so the next day they end up making him a wife, which they eventually name Crystal.

Meanwhile, Jack Frost, the spirit of Winter, becomes jealous that a snowman is more popular than he is and plans on eliminating Frosty by all means, but since this was a 70s Special, not to worry.  Anyway, Frosty brings Crystal to life with some Frost Flowers and she does the same when Jack blows off Frosty's hat.  But eventually, things work out when the kids build a snow parson to marry Frosty and Crystal with Jack being the best man.

Though not as enchanting as the original, this one was rather interesting for the fact it was the first time an iconic character (other than Santa of course) was given a wife.  Later in Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July, we see Frosty and Crystal now have two children, Chilly and Millie.  And Andy Griffith gives the tale an enchanting touch to where it's rather enjoyable for all ages.

If you a fan of the Rankin/Bass Classics, this is the one to go with as a sequel.",1481068800,22,1618,4.570934256055363

8463626,1,B005AU4SBC,"Accidental purchase my kid made...10 bucks...really?  The movie is far from great, but the price is terrible and Amazon's policy is even worse.  One of my kids purchased the movie by accident on our smart TV thinking it was a Prime movie and we're stuck with the bill, because they started watching a little of it.  Once you or your kid watches ANY of an accidental purchase, no matter how bad or overpriced the movie, the purchase is FINAL.  Default settings on the Amazon account allow for one-click purchase which in my opinion is one of the worst ""gotcha"" tactics invented by man.  One-click purchase should NOT be default especially when they know that pretty much every kid in America has access to the remote.  The only way they've sold any of these 30 +/- minute B-grade movies for $10 is by accidental purchase.  Amazon knows exactly what they're doing.  Do yourself a favor, go to Amazon video via web browser (I couldn't access all the settings by TV or mobile app, because that would be too easy), go to parental settings, create a PIN and make all purchases PIN protected.  You may just save yourself some money.",1528070400,,1125,4.641414141414141

8463628,1,B005AU4SBC,"Wow times have changed, I can't remember this particular Frosty from ""the old days"" probably because it wasn't worth watching.

You can tell it was from a different time, ""Frosty needs to take a wife""  And the way they dress the lady ""Snowman"" is with an apron, presumably so she can get to work as soon as she comes to life.

Not meant for the latter 20th century, and definitely has no place here in the 21st.

Two thumbs down, don't waste your time.
Other than as a case study on societal norms of another time period, or a curiosity on just how bad one can make a ""kids show"", stay away you won't get that time back.",1515628800,,620,4.228813559322034
