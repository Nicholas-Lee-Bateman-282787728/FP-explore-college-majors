7899915,5,7564043504,"I bought a multi format dvd player especially to watch Rick Stein's cooking and travel dvds. The player was surprisingly reasonably priced, around $80.00. I originally saw Rick's Food Heroes of Great Britain on PBS and really loved it. Since then I've been buying his dvds through Amazon.uk and getting my sister to mail them to me here in the USA. I'm just getting ready to buy the latest series on Spain which I'm really excited about as I lived there for years. I feel it's a pity that none of the series has been shown here on Food network or the Cooking Channel as I think American audiences would really enjoy them. As an added note,with Amazon.uk you qualify for free shipping when you spend five UK pounds minimum which is only about $8.00. Much less than Amazon in USA which is $25.00 minimum to qualify.",1323043200,,813,4.537414965986395
7899916,5,7564043504,"Rick Stein, largely confined to Region 2 Pal, deserves to be known in Region 1 NTSC. Every series he has produced is fascinating, informative, entertaining and often visually stunning. He travels the world to find the best in authentic local food. You see him at sea with local fishermen, riding canals in France, zipping around the hills of Sicily in search of the truly flavorful authentic foods of a culture, region, a market, a street stall or restaurant. Seafood Odyssey focuses on his love of seafood. His Far Eastern Adventure highlights Southeast Asia. His Mediterranean adventures takes him from southern France to North Africa, the coasts of Italy, Greece and into the heart of Turkey. He introduces a culture, provides historic context, shows us wondrous sites, gives us authentic cooking from the local sources. Rick Stein's enthusiasm for life, diverse peoples and cultures, his appreciation of food, both growing food and crops as well as preparation and producing authentic dishes, permeates every program. His eyes light up when trying a new dish and he exclaims, ""I just love it!"" Often he is seen taking notes, and later he tries to reproduce the dish in his own kitchen for his own restaurant in Cornwall. He is too good and his programs too wonderful not to be missed. His excitement, enthusiasm and pure hearted genuineness make me exclaim at the end of every Rick Stein program, ""I love it!"" He deserves to be widely distributed, widely seen. He is truly authentic.",1313107200,,1487,4.975903614457831
