1643808,5,B00005Q409,"This is good. Fantastic sound, fantastic performance and they've even gone to the trouble of collecting bonus material ""spare reels"" - so you end up getting versions of ""Army"" and ""Don't Change Your Plans"" from their final album. For anyone still lamenting the break of this brilliant band, this is just going to remind you of how good they were. Highly recommended, oh yes.",1002844800,,374,4.859375

1643851,5,B00005Q409,"This DVD is a great purchase for pretty much anyone who appreciates Ben Folds Five's music. Whether you be an avid fan or someone who just likes a couple of their/his songs.

The DVD is a colaboration of their best works from the 1st 2 albums (Ben Folds Five, Whatever And Ever Amen) played in a small studio with an intimate and enthusiastic audience.

With Ben Fold's smooth lead vocals and awe inspoiring piano, the amazing harmonies from Darren Jesse and Robert Sledge coming over so perfectly in this live recording - you feel as though you are there watching live. It makes you wonder why they ever broke up!

This DVD is a must have in anyones collection.",1153267200,,662,4.546218487394958
1643852,5,B00005Q409,"It was 1997. I was fighting insomnia, and losing, so I turned on the tv to the local public television station. It was 1 AM.

I was assaulted by a manic man pounding a piano with two backup musicians, a drummer and a bassist.  I was fascinated by the high-energy, yet melodic performance. I did not know a piano could be that loud. And what was that in the lyrics, ""One Angry Door's Fan?""

I had to know more. I'd found a new favorite band, and I didn't even know their names.

I soon learned that I'd stumbled across Ben Folds Five, giving the performance that's on this very DVD. Ben Folds Five - The Complete Sessions at West 54th is a heady mix of rock, jazz, and punk. It's a great sample of how Ben Folds and his band sound live. If you've ever been to a Ben Folds concert, you'll know what I mean. If not, this DVD is a good introduction.

Best. Band. Ever.",1145577600,3,864,4.149700598802395
1643853,5,B00005Q409,"I recently purchased this Dvd, and it is absolutly astounding. I think i've watched it at leaste three times. All the songs are wonderful. Ben Folds ""Missing the war"" nearly gave me goosebumps. You might have to be a true Ben fan to fully enjoy this dvd. Seeing this just gave me a greater appriciation of Ben Folds voice, paino, and amazin song writing ability.",1128988800,,362,4.584615384615384
1643854,5,B00005Q409,"I became a BFF fan after they broke up. This DVD makes up for the fact I never got to see them play live. I particularly loved seeing his more raucous fans dancing, singing, jostling each other, and doing back flips in the back. It's too bad this show got canceled, because it was a great format to showcase musicians.",1125187200,,318,4.316666666666666
1643855,5,B00005Q409,"In the good old days when Ben Folds Five were still together, they made some pretty incredible music, and had amazing live shows. Unless you got your hands on some expensive tickets at the right place and right time, however, there was no way to seem the live. Until they released this DVD.

Before I get on to the actual DVD though, I must launch into compliments about the actual live show. Whatever it was, the group was having a good day the day this was recorded. A very good day. It's so fun to watch Folds play the piano at an incredibly fast speed, Jesse slam away at the drum kit, and Robert Sledge to either play strings confidently and beautifully or rock out on the bass guitar. There is so much energy here, the band are obviously having a great time, and know what they are doing. It sounds like the recording almost, and there's a stellar set of songs for them to perform here - a lot of your BFF favourites make it like Brick, Song For The Dumped and  Steven's Last Night In Town. There's also some oldies (Philosophy) and some rarities (Theme For Dr. Physer, and a great cover of the Flaming Lips tune ""She Don't Use Jelly"") Too bad the audience are useless, not showing much sign of excitement at all, except for a group of high teens dancing stupidly behind Folds during a couple of the last numbers. In any case, the live show is lots of fun and very impressive. If you're one who's focused on Folds solo career more, it will even boost your enthusiasm about the old Five ensomble just that bit extra.

The DVD itself is fine. Nice sound, quality is excellent and the extras, apart from the rather bland promotion, er, biography, are top notch, showcasing other Ben Folds Five performances, albeit slightly more rare ones.

All in all, I'm pleased they released this fantastic live show onto DVD with perfect presentation, pleasing extras and no major flaws. This is the ultimate gift for a fan and even a good show t convert a non-believer. Top marks, just go buy it already!",1117324800,2,1996,4.475274725274725
1643856,4,B00005Q409,"I bought this as an impulse purchase at a brick-and-mortar store. I'd only heard a handful of BF/F songs before, and it was a decent price, so I figured what the heck. It's a DVD that will make you get up and dance (just try to sit still during ""Kate""), and make you sit down and zone while lyrics spin around your head (""Brick""). This DVD converted me--I'm now slowly creating a BF/F CD collection, and tell anyone who'll listen to check it out.",1090627200,2,446,4.321428571428571
1643857,5,B00005Q409,"This was a impulse buy that I'm pleased to say paid off. I caught it out of the corner of my eye and I reconized them as the band that plays ""Brick"". So I went home and popped it in. What I got was a great introduction to a talented band. I love how Ben Folds Five is playing in a smaller environment on this DVD. You really feel like you're sitting front row. The music is great. I love Folds's use of humor and self deprecation in his music. The band's preformances on ""Brick"" ""selfless, cold and composed"" ""Emaline"" and ""Smoke"" are excellent. I can understand how songs like ""the last polka"" and ""steven's last night in town"" may seem kind of dorky to first time listeners but you have to relax and laugh along. Overall, I found this to be a great DVD. If you've only heard ""Brick"" and wondered what else BF5 had to offer then this DVD is for you. view it.",1086566400,2,859,4.180722891566265
1643858,5,B00005Q409,"If you've got everything Ben Folds has ever done on CD, you've heard almost all these songs.  But you need them like this. The most striking thing about the West 54th show is that the band is totally on.  They had a *good* night.  Really good.  This show is tight, tight, tight (in a loose kind of BFF way, of course).  Also notable that the extra DVD material is actually worth having -- it's not the usual DVD-extra stuff, which is usually just shots of bands riding around in a bus making jokes.  It's all good extra live and studio footage with different takes on a number of songs.",1065830400,4,586,4.330275229357798
1643869,4,B00005Q409,"I'm a big BFF fan and have seen them in concert.  The ""sessions"" part of this DVD has the same problem their live show did: the drums and fuzz bass, while terrific, often overwhelm the fantastic music and consummate skill pouring out of Ben's piano.  This was a huge disappointment, but I still strongly recommend this DVD to anyone who likes BFF.  Amazingly, some of the bonus track concert versions have much better mixes even though the recordings must have been made under dramatically less controlled conditions.  The only other complaint was that I wish they had performed some of the songs with more variation from the album versions.  Sometimes it sounds like you are listening to a bad mix of the same version you've heard before on the album.  However, given that they have broken up and this may be your only chance to see a ""live"" show, buy it!",1027987200,3,856,4.635761589403973

1643871,5,B00005Q409,"I've been to a few concerts in my life, and have seen countless numbers on television and VHS alike.  But if I had to assemble a list of performances that I thought were the best, you can bet ""The Complete Sessions at West 54th"" would be on there.  Taped on the now defunct PBS show ""Sessions at West 54th"" Ben Folds Five put on a brilliant peformance that was up until now not available in it's entirety.
The band spares no expense and performs songs that will be familiar to many Ben Folds Five fan's.  From their debut album there is ""The Last Polka"", ""Underground"" and ""Philosophy"".  Most of the songs however come from their best album ""Whatever And Ever Amen"", such as ""Missing The War"", ""Brick"", ""Kate"", ""Battle Of Who Could Care Less"" and ""Song for the dumped"".  Their cover of The Flaming Lips ""She Don't Use Jelly"" was another welcome change of pace in a great performance.
The DVD itself is right up there with the performance, with extra features that are sure to satisfy.  By checking out the Spare Reels footage you are treated to scenes of the band on tour performing several songs, and a look at them in the studio recording for ""The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner"".
I strongly recommend that every Ben Folds Five fan at least try to see this performance in it's entirety just once.  And if you feel so inclined go ahead and pick it up, you won't regret it.",1026432000,11,1385,4.516

1643873,5,B00005Q409,"This is quintessential BFF.  All of their classic songs before Rheinhold Messner.  The video and audio are absolutely perfect, and the direction is excellent.

1643874,5,B00005Q409,"I'm a big fan of the now-defunct group but hadn't seen them perform live before viewing this show.  I was very impressed with the group's sound (as their fans know, they are a 3 piece band, not a fivesome), particularly the harmonies.  They have a lot of fun playing and a lot of that comes through in this show.  I would highly recommend this to anyone!",1021852800,,354,4.333333333333333
1643875,5,B00005Q409,"Excellent show. Didn't notice any sound delay as in another review. It is definitely like seeing him live. In fact, I did see him live soon after watching this dvd and he didn't dissapoint, but I was a little worried that he wouldn't live up to this performance. It is a must have if you are a fan.
This disc has the best dvd video transfer quality I've seen so far. You have to really search for any compression artifacts, which are common on most dvd's and easy to see on big screen tv's (even hdtv ready).",1017705600,,508,4.247422680412371
1643876,2,B00005Q409,"Firstly I must preface my comments by saying that this is a fine performance from the BFF lads, whose talent and skill I hold in high repute. If the DVD mastering were as it should be, I would recommend this as one of my favourite discs (I would give it 4 or 5 stars, rather than 2). It is a shame that none of their more recent material is released yet. Hope to see something from Ben soon since his masterful solo album.
Unfortunately, the audio on this DVD runs about a second ahead of the video. This makes what would have been a very enjoyable production extremely irritating to watch. I was very disappointed as I would have really enjoyed this DVD if they could have been bothered to master it properly.
I have emailed Sony Music about this fault, but as yet, they have ignored me. I have bought a region 4 DVD, but I assume that it comes from the same master as the Region 1. The synch problem would have been evident before the DVD was printed, which surprises me that they let this go to print! I have asked Sony Music to explain to me what went wrong and whether they are planning a recall of this disc, or whether they plan to fix this problem in future releases. Thus far, they have ignored me. I only hope that when and if they reply, their reply will be positive. In the mean time, I would caution anyone buying this DVD. If you (like most DVD users) appreciate high quality productions, you will be sorely let down.
Congrats to the Ben Folds Five for some legendary work. Shame on you Sony Music, for letting a poor production pass quality control and for ignoring the requests of it's consumers to respond and/or rectify poor quality.",1015286400,2,1651,4.363636363636363
1643877,5,B00005Q409,"I first heard of BFF from now husband. He had the CD Whatever and Amen. I wore the CD out. I have never had the pleasure of seeing BBF in concert but my husband saw them 3 times in Upstate NY when they were still a underground band only known by the college crowd. For 3 musicians THEY ARE EXTRA ORIGINAL in the melodies and presentation of the music. The 54th session I saw first on Trio on Direct TV by accident and I just had to have more so I bought this CD, which I know I will watch more than once. I highly suggest that if you like depth in music and music that fits like a glove, check this out. YOU WON""T BE SORRY!",1014854400,,623,3.9133858267716537
1643898,4,B00005Q409,"I've watched this DVD a few times now and every time I watch it I catch myself marvelling at how excellent Ben Folds is on the piano. It's like a natural extension of his body. And I also marvel at the things he's also doing when playing the piano - keeping a beat with his body whilst standing up and playing, then playing a harmonium simultaneously! For me, a budding pianist, just to watch Ben Folds perform is worth the price of admission.
But. There's so much more than that on this DVD. Perfect sound quality, picture quality and camerawork for one thing. They play all of their classics too. Folds lets the piano have it in `The Last Polka' and `Philosophy', and uses a microphone on the actual piano strings whilst bassist Robert Sledge attacks his bass guitar to elicit feedback in `Song For the Dumped'. Amongst other things, you get the trademark wild behaviour we've come to expect from Ben Folds Five: Folds stands on his stool, bashes the keys with his shoe throws his stool at the piano; the band launch into seemingly spontaneous tangents; and they fool around in `Underground'. Put simply, this DVD is about as close as you could come to actually seeing them live if you never got the chance. I didn't, and now I'm satisfied!
You also get 45 minutes of extra `spare-reels' footage on this DVD after the concert. This is where the DVD kind of falls down. The picture quality isn't very good, the sound is adequate, and the camera technique is quite poor. You seldom get to see Folds actually hitting the keys (that's where I get the chills up my spine). Also, about 6 out of the 9 songs played in this section were played in the West 54th bit, but it's great to hear a live version of Jackson Cannery, as well as some studio shots of BF5 recording `Don't Change Your Plans' and `Army'. Interspersed between the songs on the spare-reels section is little nonsense clips of the band fooling around. In one clip they are riding small German motorcycles whilst Sledge claims ""I wanna be free to ride my machine without getting hassled by the man!"" In another they encounter a psychopathic stuntman who beats them all up, breaks Ben Folds' finger and snaps Sledge's arm. Very funny stuff.
Ultimately though this DVD is really well worth the purchase price just for the concert at West 54th. It's so perfectly executed and well done, and the band play so well and with such gusto that it's like you're part of the audience. In fact you get a much better view than the audience! The spare reels section adds some laughs another dose of the band going nuts again, which is great, but it pales in comparison with the first section of the DVD. Nevertheless, I'd give it four stars easily, probably four and a half.",1012953600,,2720,4.553061224489796
1643899,5,B00005Q409,"DVD format does this performance well, as it sounds terrific on a decent 5.1 ready system. I enjoyed watching the band work to create the tunes that sound so great on their albums. The inclusion of the funny Spare Reels BFF Movie (came with the special edition of Reinhold Messner) was really welcome, or else this DVD would have had no extra features.
Oh yeah, and the kids dancing in the background during ""Underground"" are REALLY annoying and distracting -- white boy dorks.  Now we know why that take didn't air on PBS originally.",1012867200,,534,4.680851063829787
1643900,5,B00005Q409,"I'm at a loss for words.  I'm beside myself after watching this video now for the first time.  I am a huge fan of Ben Folds Five and am one of the unfortunate souls who never got to see them perform live. Nontheless, I am extremely pleased with this purchase and mad at the same time for not going out of my way to see them live when the were together.
After watching this DVD, it made me ponder one important question.  Why did they break up?  Obviously there's a reason, but the magic that is present in this performance makes you think they would be together for much longer than they were.  Who knows?  Maybe we'll see them back together soon.
I really wanted to catch the full effect of this show.  Since I don't have Dolby 5.1 surround on my DVD player/TV, I decided to watch it on my computer with my headphones.  I can honestly say I had goosebumps through the majority of the show.  The camera angles and sound quality are, for lack of a better word, perfect.  I might enjoy a widescreen version, though.  No matter.  It's still incredible.  I could hear every little snare hit, finger slide, and breath of the concert.  I don't believe one miniscule detail was left out of this performance.  It is top notch in my book.
One thing I've come to expect from good bands is that they sound as good live as they do on record.  How many bands make incredible albums, but just don't cut it when it comes to performing on stage?  I can think of plenty.  Not Ben Folds Five.  They are as accurate as a band can get.  There are several times when the guys go off track and experiment a bit.  On the final track, ""Song For the Dumped,"" Robert Sledge actually makes a trip hop beat with his bass.  Pretty impressive if you ask me.
There is not one track on this entire disk that should be skipped over.  If there were a couple of songs on the 54th Street portion from ""The Unauthorized Biography,"" I believe this would be a perfect Ben Folds Five Greatest Hits album.  I know that I'll be watching this performance for many years to come.  I better buy a back up copy while I can to replace this one when it wears out.
Please do yourself a favor and get this dvd.  Any fan of the band would be extremely happy.  I think it captures them at their best.  If you don't like Ben Folds Five, you soon will.  Especially if you happen to catch a glimpse of this performance.",1012435200,13,2364,4.261261261261262
1643901,5,B00005Q409,"This perfomance of Ben Folds Five really made a fan out of me, It is truly amazing how many differen't musical styles and sounds that can come out of only three musicians live. I must admit I was only familiar with the song ""Brick"" but that was enough of a reason to buy this DVD and give it a chance and to my surprise every song on here is AWESOME! the picture and sound quality is perfect and the performance is enough to make an instant fan out of anyone. So if you're into Rock, Jazz, Polka or whatever, this one is a MUST!",1009843200,3,528,4.086538461538462

And to all that got to see them live, BUY THIS, it's great.  A great show, sounds a lot like the recordings.  it's early BFF too, so they play almost all of WEAEA, which is by far one of the best cds of the 90s.  Spare reels is good for a laugh.  and the studio clips of don't change your plans and army are nice too.  i just wished the put the Potty Mouth promo thing on here, that is hilarious.

1643903,4,B00005Q409,"Haven't seen BFF in concert yet, but seeing this DVD puts me there in lots of ways. Music fans in general don't realize it just now, but this band is going to turn out to be very important to the evolution of rock as we know it. In much the same way as a DMB or a Phish, BFF takes musical angles never-before used and creates songs you can sing along with. The venue is small and thus, the sound is remarkable. Ben is hilarious. Overall a very worthwhile buy. Only detraction is that the material is the band's older material (Kate, Song for the Dumped...) Army and a few others are seen and heard being recorded in studio, but no live performances within the show.",1009152000,,665,4.285714285714286
1643904,5,B00005Q409,"I am watching this DVD once more as I write this review. Ben Folds Five had great live shows- I know I loved going to them. This DVD features them in a more sober and intimate audience. Their performance is tight. We even catch Ben Folds himslef being slightly uncomfortable and maybe even nervous in this setting. The performances of Smoke and Missing the War are true gems- truly highlighting the depth of Ben Folds' talent at songwriting.  Exciting to many will be the performances of ""Theme From Dr. Pyser"" and a Flaming Lips cover of ""She Don't Use Jelly"" interpreted as a lounge song. The mix of fifteen songs is great- though I was saddened to find that ""Fair"" was not among them. Don't be shy because you are looking for a a more frentetic live show- great clips are included in the spare Reels footage and Folds does manage to stomp on the keys and slam down on them with his forearm a few time during the West 54th performance. Even his trademark high-voiced ""Are you ready to rock now"" appears.
 For those to whom the band was dear we find a poingant moment where we can watch a group of talented musicians that never quite fit anywhere- Somehwere in-between obscurity and fame, between indie-rock and pop, between promising debut in their self-titled Ben Folds Five and the critical acclaim(and commercial disapointment) of Rheinhold Messner.
 For those who do not know the band- they were the most underrated rock band of the nineties- that provided a refuge both from the absurdly and psudo-morose rockings of the last gasp of ""Alternative"", the middle of the road mediocrity of Green Day and also a place of shelter from the gratingly mechanical glitter pop whose ressurection began in America with Hanson whose debut came around the time of this performance. Fortunately- still living under the dark clouds of the boys and blondes of Pop- I can kick back with my friends and watch great music being performed by a great band.",1005004800,82,1941,4.702941176470588
1643905,5,B00005Q409,"Im a big Ben Folds Five fan. When i seen this DVD it was a dream come true. While its a great DVD, i feel there best albums are ""Ben Folds Five"" and ""Autobiography of Reinhold Messner"". Unfortunately this performance is before ""Autobiography of..."" was even recorded, so there's no songs performed from it (obviously), and only a few from there first album ""Ben Folds 5"". That means the majority of the performance is made up from there 2nd and in my opinion, worst album ""Whatever and Ever Amen"". But even there worst album is actually a good album.
As far as the DVD, the picture is really crisp and nice. Theres subtitles so u can sing along (incase you ddont know the words), and the Dolby Digital is pretty good. The bonus 45 minute ""film"" is pretty good, but it actually contains 2 performances from the beginning of the DVD which is kinda lame but oh well.
I might be going a little far with a 5 star rating, but theres a good chance this will be the only Ben Folds 5 DVD ever released, so fans must get it.",1005004800,,1014,4.31413612565445

The song selection is perfect (I was never crazy about the Reinhold Messner album) and the sound and video is exquisite.  The Spare Reels extras are a little grainy but it takes nothing away from the performances.  The trio was dead on sharp for the taping:  harmonies perfect, instrumentation tight, just an awesome show.

This DVD is almost as good as seeing them live, and since thats now impossible, you really need to pick this up if you're a fan of good music. The transfer, which doesn't appear to have come from film, but rather video, is excellent. The sound quality is also really good, Ben sounds even better in Dolby Digital 5.1 than he does in stereo.

7949591,5,B00005Q409,"Enjoyed this DVD almost as much as I have enjoyed his wonderful concerts.  Buy it if you're a fan, buy it if you're curious.  Pure bliss.",1399852800,,137,4.230769230769231
7949592,4,B00005Q409,"Quality is alright, can't expect much from a concert DVD really. Not really worth the money unless you're like me and just like to have a complete collection.",1354579200,,158,4.678571428571429
7949593,5,B00005Q409,"This is one of the best concert DVD's I have seen in a long time.  It was perfect because I got this just before I saw them live in Buffalo NY at the beginning of their tour this year.

Set-list was good and the extras are actually entertaining and worth watching (something untrue in most music DVD's)",1354060800,,302,4.280701754385965
7949594,5,B00005Q409,"This is the best band dvd I own. Really good performance, especially if you like Ben Folds Five. If only these guys would have continued making good music, and Ben didn't go lose it and start writing music that sounds like it should be on cereal commercials. This is definitely Ben Folds Five in their prime.",1351555200,,308,4.517857142857143

7949597,5,B00005Q409,"Fun fun fun - This has to be Ben Folds Five's best collection of live performances.  Great music, great musicians, great video quality and sound.  I will be jamming to this for years to come.",1247443200,,191,4.428571428571429
7949598,5,B00005Q409,"I am purchasing this DVD for the second time, as it somehow got lost during my last move.  I am one of the fortunate fans that was at this live recording.  ( I can be seen dancing in the background from time to time, LOL)  BF5 were a fantastic band, and anyone that likes their music would enjoy this intimate performance.  It has even more special meaning to me as it brings back such a fantastic memory.  buy it !",1247011200,2,415,4.1375
