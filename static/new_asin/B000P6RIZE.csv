8189449,4,B000P6RIZE,"I was disapointed as there could have been more to it. Having been around the racetrack myself. I knew a lot of female Exercise Riders,Grooms,and Trainers that were great in their jobs. I feel that women have just as much right as men as long as they qualify. I also feel that they should be paid for their accomplishement. It upsets me when I see men get paid more in some sports than men like Bowling,Tennis,Etc.",1329004800,,414,4.4605263157894735
8189450,5,B000P6RIZE,"This movie about working women in the horse racing business is really tops. It shows real women and explains why they love the business and love horses.  The cinematic quality is first rate, too, and I hope to see this documentary on television so it reaches a wider audience.  The history contained here is interesting, too; I didn't know that women were not legally allowed to bet for many years in the 20th century.  This is fine work.",1182816000,6,438,4.589743589743589
8189451,4,B000P6RIZE,I really liked the idea of this video. Not enough has been done to celebrate women in horse racing. The content was good in it's honesty about women in racing.  I would have enjoyed seeing the women in action and having a little more of a professional spin on the production of the video. I hope we see more books and DVDs about women in the horse industry. I think every woman in this video had more of a story to tell.,1181779200,6,420,4.121951219512195
