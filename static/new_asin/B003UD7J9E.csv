4195559,5,B003UD7J9E,"I am listening to the Audio Version of the book, and I'm almost through. I could not BELEIVE how fantastic the casting is, especially Ellen who looked exactly as I had imagined her. I had chills watching the entire first episode. A few things were changed and happened out of order from the book but not enough to make a difference. I CAN'T WAIT until the DVD comes out. I watch almost all historical fiction series and this one rocks, it's up there with ""Rome"" ""Tudors"" ""Deadwood"" All I can say is WOW!",1280275200,57,503,4.419354838709677
4195560,5,B003UD7J9E,"I can't wait till the entire piece is available because based on the first 2 episodes I was able to watch on instant streaming, it is a PHENOMINAL interpretation of the original book...one of my all time favorites.  The characters are portrayed honestly and without the distraction of big name stars.  Except of course for Donald Sutherland, who not only is great and recognizable, but blends to whatever character he plays and this role is no exception. The brutality, the vulgarity and the sexuality are all consistent with the historical times so these aspects are not solicitous or titillating.  They portray a history that was brute force, political and survivalist in nature.  It is a wonderful adaptation of a truly incredible book!",1280275200,243,739,5.032786885245901

4195572,5,B003UD7J9E,We purchased this because it was no longer available on our satellite services.  We saw the first one and had to find out what happened.  Good movie.  We are history buffs so enjoyed it.,1522540800,,186,4.411764705882353

4195574,1,B003UD7J9E,"If you read the book,  you will want to know that the book is very different from this series.  A lot of the story is changed, there's this incestuous relationship with William and his mother that I can't believe they had to put in there, and the flow is weak.  If I had not read the book, a lot of this mini-series wouldn't have made sense because they introduct too many characters at once, and breeze through a lot that was important to the story.

In short, if you have read the book, and are hoping that this will compliment it in any way, stop right now.  You are better off imagining the characters of the Hunger Games filling the roles of the Pillars of the Earth (some actually are)!",1521504000,2,692,4.292307692307692

4195576,5,B003UD7J9E,I love Ken Follett and this series was outstanding. Great actors and quality of production. Highly recommend.,1521072000,,109,5.470588235294118
4195577,4,B003UD7J9E,"The discs come in a plastic and cardboard folding contraption. The discs play fine.

This series is better than World Without End, which is a so-so miniseries. The Tudors is excellent and the Reign is okay. Camelot is at the bottom of the heap. Two current series that are very good are The Vikings and The Last Kingdom.

If the above don't sound interesting you might like a couple of space race shows. I spent a month on a space race binge. First I read Space by James A. Michener. Then I watched two movies, The Right Stuff (1983) and Apollo 13 (1995), and then two great series, From Earth to the Moon (1998) and The Astronauts Wives Club (2015). Theyre a great combination.

If the above shows don't sound interesting here are a few of the series I really enjoyed watching more than once. I love good miniseries like Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000) because they have beginnings, middles and endings, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lost (2004-2010), Merlin (2008-2012), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek The Original Series (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish, or the hundreds of other fantasy and science fiction shows Ive watched.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1520812800,,2002,5.224299065420561

4195598,1,B003UD7J9E,"The book was a wonderful story of love secrets and the will of God and this Hollywood rendition has none of that. It is full of lust, lies and ludicrous horror to the main characters. The most important dialogue from the book is missing and Jack and alienas love story is ruined.

This film is a joke.",1518134400,2,301,4.280701754385965
4195599,5,B003UD7J9E,"I love period dramas. This one has a lot of twists and plot turns and interesting characters I empathise with. I admit, I'm a descendent of Empress Maud & her son Henry Plantagenet so I was sort of rooting for them the whole time... lol. But my favourite characters were actually the builder & his girlfriend, and the well-meaning priest who sometimes is seduced by his ambition but regrets it and learns to value people over ambition. I wouldn't say this show is incredibly deep, but it is interesting to observe that even the villains are truly afraid of the church and impiety. It is also fascinating to think how these people could build such beautiful cathedrals given what they had at the time. I wish people today had that kind of devotion to something spiritual and larger than themselves. This show was also fun, especially the machinations of the evil bishop, who you know will get his just desserts in the end...",1517529600,,923,4.668711656441718
4195600,1,B003UD7J9E,"Yes, I love this series, BUT I am confused that there was only 3 CD's and it only went up to 1/3 of the story.  On the front, it says ""Epic Eight Part Miniseries.  Here on the Amazon lists, it says ""Epic Eight HOUR Miniseries"".  Am I missing 2/3's of the package?  There is a big difference between 8 part and 8 hour.  Anyone out there have an answer?

I gave the worst star because I have not heard back from the seller.  I am on the third purchase of this DVD, three different sellers and all three with the same issue.

Those who have read the book will also ask, WTH?  You left us with Jack going to Paris.  Even if you have not read the book, you will wonder what happened and why is there no conclusion.",1517184000,,709,4.0359712230215825

4195619,5,B003UD7J9E,I am so glad to see this group of actors together. It is cool to see the middle ages and its day to day depiction.,1512345600,,114,3.6
4195620,1,B003UD7J9E,I read the books and was very impressed by Ken Follett's ability to weave English history into a wonderfully adapted story of the middle ages.  That being said . . . . I was looking forward to watching the British series.  I was very disappointed in the screen adaptation of the book.  The series is so different from the book that it's hard to watch.  I wonder what Ken Follett thought of the way his book was butchered.  I know it's a long book but  It could have been handled a little differently instead of changing the story to fit the time slot.,1512259200,5,551,4.300970873786408
4195621,5,B003UD7J9E,Some of the characters are real easy to hate.  Waiting for them to fail was worth waiting for.,1511481600,,94,4.222222222222222
4195622,3,B003UD7J9E,"I'm torn on this one.  First, I must state that I don't remember the book, so this review is a stand alone thing unto itself based on the miniseries.  I really like the scenery, I think they did a great job with it.  Everything is beautiful, or disgustingly beautiful as it should be.  The castles look cold, the clothes look warm but basic.  The cathedrals look pretty realistic.  That's the positives.  The acting is what's killing me.  The actors that play Phillip and Jack just don't do it for me.  Jack has this deep raspy voice, and maybe he was supposed to, but every scene he is in I dread.  Phillip is stiff, cold and an unfeeling character.  There is nothing realistic about the acting.

Finally, I must not that the music is just dreadful.  It's very reminiscent of typical low budget fantasy/sci-fi where the composer just writes ""ominous tones"" to represent anything.

I'd watch this once, but not again.  And I'm glad I didn't pay more than $10 for it.",1509580800,2,966,4.567251461988304

4195626,2,B003UD7J9E,"Great cast, nice production values, good overall story... But there are a few awful plot blunders that are downright embarrassing and enough to spoil the overall experience. Whoever wrote those scenes should be excomuogated from the film industry...

SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT!

(1) An evil character kills his own mother in their castle, then calls the captain of the guards and says that she died from an accident, having slipped and fallen. He remarks: ""that's what you get from drinking too much every day!"" They both then proceed to carry the woman's body to the main drawbridge of the castle, and throw it into the moat!

WHAT? If she died from an accident, why throw her into the moat? Why not give the lady of the castle a proper funeral? What about everybody else who lives and works there? What do you tell them? This is just ridiculous!!

(2) A single woman has an affair and becomes pregnant, but marries another man immediately, who is none the wiser. He tries to consummate the marriage on their wedding night, but fails. In the next scene, it is eight months later and she is very visibly pregnant. A servant enters her bedroom and sees her very evident belly. She tells the servant: ""Yes, I am pregnant, but please do not tell my husband, he hasn't noticed!""

WHAT? After eight months living together? He never tried to have sex with her again? And even if they slept in separate bedrooms, wouldn't he ever notice that his wife is eight months pregnant? Ridiculous!

(3) The eight-month pregnant lady goes to church with her husband and the whole village. Nobody has noticed her pregnancy (not even the husband). During the religious service, suddenly the roof caves in, killing several people and hurting many others. As the town-folk begin removing the rubble searching for survivors, they hear a baby crying... they remove a few big stones and find the mother with the newborn baby in her arms, both unhurt! She had the baby in less than a minute, during the accident. (!!??) Ridiculous, again.

These scenes (there were other blunders, less blatant) spoiled the whole thing. What a waste of acting talent!",1508025600,2,2143,4.807065217391305

changes were made in this adaptation of the book, but it didn't take away from the

This is a saga set in Medieval times centering around the building of a cathedral.  I read the book and the adaptation for this min-series is pretty true to the book.  However, there are some incest scenes and gay scenes added to this min-series that I don't remember from the book.  One wonders why that was necessary?  For me, it detracted from the story.  Once you watch, the action is fast-paced and the story line riveting.  That is just like the books.  I was glad I had read the book first because the story moves so quickly on the screen that it would be easy to miss important pieces of the story without having done that.",1484092800,,745,4.5

4195687,2,B003UD7J9E,"I really loved the book. I normally wouldn't read something so overly detailed as the book, but it really provided a wonderful and accurate glimpse into the 12the century. However, the series deviated from the book excessively. I understand that the book had a ton of internal struggle and monologue and that's indeed difficult to portray on screen. But! The deviations had nothing to do with that. For example (Spoilers), William was already so twisted and demented that we didn't need a creepy thing with his mother to sell it. In fact, the series seems to lay the blame for his wretchedness at her feet when it wasn't so much in the book. In the book, he's an insecure jealous boy overly coddled by his mother and given impossible standards to live up to at the same time. Yet the series seems to make his mother more manipulating and for some reason in a sexual way. Why? By my description, it may seem like a fine line, but when you compare the book to the show side by side, the line isn't so fine after all. They also changed Ellen's character too much, and they made people know things that they didn't know in the book. And for some reason, they combined Prior James with the prior that raised Phillip into one person, and so on with other minor characters. The cast is so good though, that I wanted to like it more. Very disappointing though.",1479945600,4,1352,4.5

4195798,4,B003UD7J9E,"This mini series is powerful and an interesting peek into history with compelling characters and a great pace. It's complex enough to keep you thinking, but not too much so that it's hard to follow.

My biggest issue with the DVD itself is the menu for disc 2 has a huge spoiler right there on the screen in the form of an image that basically ruins most of the drama of episode 4 and 5 for anyone who hasn't seen it already.  I was watching it with people who had not seen it before and I was so mad! Thankfully I caught 2 of the 3 of them before they saw it and they aren't allowed to see the menu until we move on.

So let this be a warning to those who may read this and haven't seen it yet!  DO NOT LOOK AT THE MENU picture for disc 2.  I haven't seen disc 3 or 4, but hopefully whoever put this together didn't ruin those too.

We watched this series as part of our Art History to get a feel for the time period and the building of cathedrals and while the series left out or didn't portray well the good work that monks did or any understanding of the gospel, it does show the power of superstition around relics of that period and we thought the reoccurring theme of who gets to say what ""God's Will"" is, portrayed exactly why the Western Roman church at this time period was fighting with the Eastern Byzantines over who gets the authority to say what God's will is!

Also, it may have been in the book, but they weren't necessary and we didn't need or want all the graphic sex scenes. It was very annoying to have to remember where they were to have my teens look away.",1452470400,7,1579,4.107142857142857

I ordered the letterbox version of The Pillars of Earth for $18.87 and received the 3 disk set instead. The first episode includes so many characters and plots that I would have been overwhelmed and missed the sub-plots had I not read the books. I have to say that even though much of the acting was good, I was disappointed with the series. There is just too much character development and historic references in the book to adequately make a miniseries. Although it is a time worn cliche, the books were much better.

C'mon... Yes, Jews were killed in the Crusades and some European ""purges"" were directed at Jews, but for the most part (and everyone knows it) in the 12th century crusades were carried out (ostensibly) against the Moslems.

4195963,5,B003UD7J9E,"Based on Ken Folletts novel, this series is set during the tumultuous times in the 12th Century known as The Anarchy following the unexpected death of the son of the then king, Henry I. Much death and mayhem ensued as the noble houses allied themselves with the two factions vying for the throne.

This massive tale spans the period from 1123 to 1174 and without a device to ground the narrative it would have just been a bewildering tale of bloodshed, betrayal and far too many people called Richard and Henry. Thankfully the story revolves around the varying fortunes of the Priory of the fictional town of Kingsbridge as it attempts to build a cathedral where we follow the trials and tribulations of the Prior and the master builder and his family.

The aforementioned bloodshed, betrayal and fluid allegiances are never far from the surface, driving the plot as the main protagonists try to manipulate the course of events. Nobody, however, can out-manipulate the insidious cleric Waleran Bigod (played most splendidly by Ian McShane) whose overarching ambition catalyses most of the key events.

This mini-series is a remarkable piece of work. It successfully tells of a complex and generally little known period in English history through the eyes of ordinary folk making for satisfying, engrossing and memorable viewing. There aren't even that many historical inaccuracies either (unlike the shocking The Tudors debacle); those listed on the Wiki Fount of all Knowledge are trivial and entirely excusable. After all, if they were aiming for true authenticity all of the nobles would be speaking Norman French while the peasantry mumbled away in Middle English. The series has been praised for its portrayal of medieval life, the productions values are absolutely superb  worthy of HBO and the cast are great. In fact, theres nothing much wrong with it at all.

All-in-all it is Splendid stuff and certainly worth a watch if you like historical drama. If only history had been taught like this in school I might have been able to remember what went on and who did what rather than trying to remember a confusing and disjointed array of events and dates.",1421539200,,2160,4.988888888888889
4195964,3,B003UD7J9E,This was interesting but not as exciting as I would have hoped.,1421366400,,63,4.333333333333333
4195965,3,B003UD7J9E,"To explain why this television series is a disappointment, it suffices to compare with historical reality the outline of events depicted in just the first few minutes.  We begin with a brief depiction of the White Ship, with English King Henry Is only son and heir and his wife on board, going down in fictitious flames off the coast of England. Actually, it struck a rock just off the coast of Normandy and the princes wife was far away. The King is dismissive of the promise of his little daughter Maud (actually then a married adult living faraway in Germany) to provide him with heirs, while his unhistorically wicked nephew Stephen (whose real decency is well-known as his undoing) plots his own succession.  We then flash forward to 1138 when Henry I (actually already dead for three years) celebrates the birth in Winchester of Mauds son Henry (actually born five years earlier in France) as his prospective heir. The old king then promptly drops dead of a poisoning that has no basis of suspicion in reality and his grieving daughter (actually then in France and at war with her father) narrowly escapes abroad.

Dramatic purpose may justify distortions of historical truth such as making the wrecking of the White Ship sabotage, but the other deviations from the most basic unfolding of events known to every English schoolchild brought up on a potted account of his countrys history seem absurdly pointless.  They are so relentless that I found myself cringing in expectation every time the action switched from fictitious characters to historical ones.

Could all have been well if the allusions to real people and events had been dispensed with? Sadly not, because the distortion of them is nothing besides the much more important misrepresentation of what twelfth-century society was about.  The underlying story of the marriage of an earls daughter to one stonemason and her love for another is itself intrinsically unhistorical, a fantasy about how 21st-century people would have liked 12th-century women to behave rather than how they ever did. Still, exceptions can always be imagined and this one could happily be swallowed on its own. Unfortunately, though, it is symptomatic of a pervasive malaise.  The people of fictitious Kingsbridge unfailingly think and behave like 21st century people.  Within a few minutes of the final episode, we are called upon both to accept that the monk Remigius is an unhappy victim of homophobia rather than the  unscrupulous schemer hitherto presented, and that Williams villainy has reached new heights through his bedding his 13-year-old bride, though anyone in the 12th century would have thought it strange if he had not.

It is the fact apparent from almost every review that most people are accepting it as a possibly (even if only vaguely) authentic depiction of the twelfth century that alienates me.  In case this seems uncharitable, I would point out how extremely easy it would have been to have edited the most basic events and attitudes for truth without affecting anything that makes the story of fictitious cathedral builders and priests otherwise good. That this was not attempted is an indication of the script-writers contempt for the truth and confidence in popular ignorance.

Why then does this travesty deserve three stars rather than the minimum one?  It is never boring because it is often visually splendid, and is undoubtedly well acted by a broad range of great performers who have given it much more than it deserves. Do not think this implies it is good drama though, for the acting is severely undermined by a childishly melodramatic script. With the sole exception of Remigius, with his anachronistic second dimension, the characters are black and white and meet their deserved fates with tiresome predictability.  The villains are purely and irrationally evil; the scene when William in a petulant rage murders his doting mother and throws her in a moat is simply too silly to be shocking.

Amusing enough for those indifferent to history, but seriously recommended only as a pantomime for children who have been warned it is fantasy.

Though I don't remember enough about the plot and characters of the novel to determine whether the mini-series is a faithful reproduction, it certainly captures the epic quality of the novel effectively.

The intrigue, deception, power plays, and political and religious maneuvering set against the grand scheme of erecting the enormous soaring cathedral will keep you enthralled throughout each episode. The excellent casting decisions relied on a few ""name"" actors, and a well chosen supporting cast. The sets and costumes are stunning in their richness and authenticity. Though it was filmed in Hungary, the outdoor scenes are plausible. Many of the scenes of the cathedral rely on CGI and animation, but the results are seamless and really well done.

Once you start the series, you won't be able to stop until you've watched the last episode, so make sure to set aside the time to immerse yourself in this fascinating series.",1417132800,,1182,4.99492385786802

4196088,5,B003UD7J9E,"This show has true magic in it. Well documented, produced and directed, it is a show that keeps you spell bound for hours. Each episode lasts about 45 minutes, so you have a good excuse to watch two at the time. The actors are so convincing and perfectly cast, that you find yourself traveling in time to the 11th century, and watch enthralled as they struggle with their contemporary problems. The gist of the story centers around the building of a cathedral under very unfavorable circumstances, at the time of King Stephen's reign, in England. A plot of politics, treachery, revenge, murder and mayhem, but also, of course, love, beautiful scenery, costumes and a gorgeous cathedral, still standing today. A must see for the history buff.",1404518400,,741,4.888888888888889

This show (falsely) portrays even the protagonist Christian monks as liars and unrighteous men.  The media continue to try and re-write history with such subtle (and sometimes blatantly obvious) depictions, and it is wrong!  Glorifying a woman urinating on a priest is just outrageous and wrecked a drama which could have been so much better using more class.",1400198400,4,460,5.1066666666666665

While it did not truly follow the book, it was close enough to be a wonderful portrayal of the characters brought to life in the book by Ken Follett.  Ian McShane was spot on as Bishop Bigod..  Rufus Sewell was Tom Builder.  The entire cast was perfect

If you loved Braveheart, Robin of Sherwood and any other Medieval action/drama this is the series for you. I have also purchased it's sequel 'A World Without End'. This series gives you a glimpse of life in the Middle Ages and is full of excellent actors (Ian McShane, Donald Sutherland, Eddie Redmayne, Matthew McFadden) that give 100 percent to their performances. There is so much intrigue and suspense that you never get bored. I am halfway through and can't wait to view the sequel series.

4196111,3,B003UD7J9E,"Ok, so the title states it is ""The Pillars of the Earth""; it has a guy named Tom 'Builder', Prior Phillip, et al., oh and it's about a place named Kingsbridge and a cathedral. Besides that there is very little, even remotely, comparing it to the book. It is not the same story. Major characters are portrayed completely differently, lives and deaths are altered, etc. etc. etc.;
One of the great appeals of the book was that the primary focus was on the ""common man"" as it were and not the greats (Kings) and near greats. But King Stephen is written in tons of times in scenes that were not in the book and talk about altered history?! (SPOILERS): So when exactly did Henry (II) kill Eustace in battle?!Oh well. It is NOT the book.
Having said all that...I gave it 3 stars because the mini-series itself WAS well acted well cast, good visuals & sets. The story (although NOT the same story as the book) was compelling in its own right. I at first pulled the DVD in disgust, then gave it another chance (as a standalone story NOT associated with the book), and found myself enjoying it.

The movie has completely different story lines and it leaves out St. Thomas Beckett which is crucial as to the conclusion of the book.

Not exactly true to the book, but given the millennial scope and timeframe of Follett's book, how could it be?  Great characters, arch villains, comely heroines.

Ian McShane's character has a very different resolution than in the books (for no good reason), which was a shame because the payoff disappeared.

Having been attacked many times, this town and its people survived, by rebuilding and moving on from tragedy. It is also a story about the politics of building a cathedral in the eleventh century and of the people affected by it.

This television series is based on Ken Follett's wonderful, best-selling novel of the same name. However, it is not the same as the book. Details were modified in order to create a comprehensive, integral movie of reasonable length. This movie is made to spellbound and to inspire awe. And it is successful at doing those things!

The sets and the costumes are amazingly authentic. The actors are each very talented and very convincing. Moreover, like the page-turner book upon which this film is based, it is impossible to stop watching. It is so well done, that the viewer is quickly drawn into the action of the plot, the turmoil of the true-to-life characters, and the vibrant and realistic settings.

This movie is beautifully filmed and filled with unforgettable scenes and haunting moments. I cannot recommend this one enough!",1375747200,,1148,4.937823834196891

Too much flitting back and forth with little snippets of shots between scenes, reducing impact and coherency.

Having seen this helped me a great deal in my genealogy work. While admittedly some parts of the story are not necessarily historically accurate or relevant, understanding The Anarchy as presented here helped me a lot when writing up individual descriptions of a client's ancestors - among whom are the real-life characters of Henry I and Maud (Matilda) of England, King Stephen of Blois, Henry II, and other background info.

4196197,5,B003UD7J9E,"My husband and I are both HUGE Ken Follett fans.  The Pillars of the Earth is my husband's favorite Follett book, and my favorite is World Without End.  So, when we heard that Showtime was releasing The Pillars of the Earth in a mini-series, we knew we had to see it immediately.

The mini-series is eight episodes, each about an hour long.  The  writers and producers did a great job bringing the book to life, although there was a lot more sex in the TV version than in the book.  I guess the producers felt like the book needed some spicing up.  I can do without all of that, but we were able to look past it and enjoy the rest of the show.

The casting was perfect, with the exception of Tom Builder.  I wanted him to be bigger, taller and broader.  I always pictured him as a really big guy while reading the book.  Alfred could have been a little less petulant, but overall the actor playing Alfred did a good job.  One thing that I had some trouble with was the character playing Prior Phillip (Matthew Macfadyen).  He plays Mr. Darcy in my favorite adaptation of Pride and Prejudice.  I had a hard time accepting him as Prior Phillip because he will always be Mr. Darcy to me.

The plot was slightly modified from the book, but I expected this.  The book is nearly 1000 pages long and there's no way the writers could have stayed 100% true to the plot without making the mini-series at least 20 hours long.

If you have not read the book or watched the series, I highly recommend either of them.  The mini-series will ruin the book for you, so I'd recommend reading the book first, if you can stomach the hefty size.  If you don't have the time, the mini-series is a must-see.",1373760000,,1684,4.322683706070287
4196198,3,B003UD7J9E,I love the book and Ken Follet in general.  This series was ok.  Nothing amazing and nothing horrible.  There was even one or two good acting performances.,1372550400,,155,4.666666666666667
4196199,5,B003UD7J9E,"I must have read this book 10 times. I loved all the characters, set against an historical period of chaos and lawlessness. The movie didn't always follow the book, but I appreciated the fact that it made a favorite book's characters come alive.",1372464000,,245,4.72093023255814
4196200,4,B003UD7J9E,"First off, I found the book very compelling and a wonderful, page turning romp through Ken Follet's fertile imagination. I enjoyed looking up details to verify the historical accuracy of his novel and found, as one might expect, a mixed bag from highly accurate to fantasy. I viewed the mini-series directly after reading, so my memory was still freshly imbued with the details of Follet's written word. When I sat down to watch the mini-series, I expected the worse.

Other reviewers point out gross interpretative inaccuracies in the TV drama and I agree that I found myself saying to my very annoyed wife as we watched, ""That wasn't in the book"" or ""Hey, they left out a very important detail""...but all in all, as a TV drama, it holds up fairly well and can be entertaining as a stand alone experience to those who have never read the book.  For those who did read and want to relive the experience, then some allowances need to be made. If the reader steadfastly demands strict accuracy, they he/she will be frustrated and dissapointed. If, however, the reader approaches the TV drama as an independent effort that hits most of its marks, then the experience will be much more positive.

As a production, the acting is very good, the CGI and sets are very convincing and the overall attention to detail is to be commended. Depiction of the Cathedral's construction (and de-construction) is fantastic.  I kept asking myself, ""How'd they do that?""  My concerns about book/TV consistency was put aside when I saw (in the special features) that Follet was not only consulted during the production and shooting, but also appeared in a cameo scene. I mean, if he thought the thing worked, then who am I to criticize?

Running at 8 hours, you'll get your fill of a very well made TV miniseries that might disappoint hard core TPOTE readers, but, though not perfect, nonetheless stands on its own as a very good, well made effort. -Jim",1371772800,,1932,4.7522388059701495

4196207,4,B003UD7J9E,I read this book so was excited to see how well they did with the movie.  It was really well done.  The actors did a nice job and I really enjoyed it.  The reason I didn't give it a five star was because of the unnecessary graphic sex.  There are ways of letting you know what is happening without hitting you in the face with it.  I'm not one to think that a story has to show you everything and not leave anything to the imagination like so many movies today.  I realize that sometimes sex helps move a story along but it was unnecessary in this case.,1369785600,,553,4.074074074074074

Pillars is one of my favorite books of all time, and because of its length, detail of the historical period, and thorough character development, I had modest expectations of a highly abridged screen adaptation.

Although most of the characters didn't quite fit my personal visualizations, outside of some totally weird CGI things, I found this thoroughly enjoyable, and spent entirely too much time engrossed in it. There was some intra-personal action & violence added for dramatic effect, such as a duel in the Shireing quarry between Jack & William Hamleigh's henchman, Walter, which I found pointless, and scenes of the cathedral city of Lincoln were flat out weird, since they showed Lincoln surrounded by mountains(if you've ever been in Lincolnshire, you'll know that it's less mountainous than Kansas).
Still, the CG buildings were amazing. I've been in most of the great cathedrals in the UK, and I thought that some scenes must have been shot in, or of one of these grand edifices.

For those who haven't read the book Waleran was forced to ask Phillip (now bishop) to let him live out his days in the monastery - a much more severe punishment that a fall from a ledge.

4196257,4,B003UD7J9E,"Note: I saw this epic miniseries in its original VIII-part format via Encore On Demand.

The series is good, though I've never read the book on which it's based. The casting is excellent, with the exception of Donald Sutherland as the Earl of Shiring. Mr. Sutherland is a good actor, but his American accent detracts somewhat from the story. Fortunately, his role is minor. In a well-rounded cast of British and Irish actors, the producers should have gone with someone with a British or Irish accent, in my opinion. Ian McShane (who I first saw as the villainous Blackbeard in Pirates Of The Carribbean: On Stranger Tides) is deliciously malevolent as the vile Bishop Waleran. Hayley Atwell, Eddie Ramayne, Tony Curran, David Oakes (who recently completed his role as the equally lecherous Juan Borgia on Showtime's The Borgias) & Sam Claflin are also spot-on on their roles. The story is somewhat difficult to follow, as the political machinations are plenty.

My only complaint is that the series has been inexplicably edited for nudity. It first aired on Encore, if I'm not mistaken, which is a cable channel (and they allow graphic violence, strong language & sexuality/nudity). There IS some sexuality/nudity, but not as much as I expected. I found out that there is more nudity in the DVD version. Why is that? I thought Encore had more licence for sex/nudity.

The final episode was a little anti-climatic..without ruining it for anyone who has not seen it, the finale felt rushed.

I am a real Rufus Sewell fan and the casting is outstanding.  Ian McShane is wonderfully wicked...you can really learn to hate this character!  He is so marvelously duplicitous.

The story is fiction from a historical period.  It is an informative history lesson during a time which most people are not very familiar. But it is very accurate.  It is very violent and graphic at times. But life at that time was violent.  It is realistic for the period.

Matthew Macfadyen is such a torn character...torn between good and evil, he lives in a constant dilemma.

Follett's novel is perfect storytelling, and the series is worth watching after reading.  It isn't as rich which is expected when converting a deep storyline onto the screen, and there are more than a few deviations from Follett's plot and storyline; however, I found nearly all the differences to be minor enough and forgivable-some even added suspense to what a reader would find predictable and merely going through the motions.  I am more than let down when a film misses the point of a wonderful story, but it really is preserved well here and paced well.  As far as the cinematic luster-they nailed it!

A lot of things that irked me about the novel: the graphic rapes and senseless violence (without much conquence from the heroes other than namecalling and fistwaving), Jack's marysuisms, the characters not having a good understanding of the times they were living in, etc... were smoothed out and replaced with nailbiting intrigue.

This is the story of the creation of a Gothic Cathedral in a mythical village in England during the dynastic war for succession between King Stephan and Empress Maud - a violent ongoing war of about 18 years eventually seeing Henry II on the throne of England. Cathedral building might not inspire initial excitement, nevertheless the romance, intrigue and warfare in this tale is soap operatic enough to entertain almost everyone.

The performances of the younger members of the cast, with the exception of Liam Garrigan as Alfred, were underwhelming.

Tom Builder is suppose to be taller than everyone else in the book and yet Prior Phillip looks to be just as tall. And Walter is like an NBA center compared to both of them. Aliena is a great beauty in the book but here, just another attractive Hollywood face. Ellen is one of the better castings but her (German?)accent keeps popping up. Jack-not a bad choice but he didn't start out as an 18 yr old in the book. Nor does Martha start out as a 12 yr old. William Hamleigh looks like he needs a few big meals. Ian McShane is a great choice to play Waleran BUT as a younger man? This story takes place over the course of 50-70 years.

It's a shame this is only 7 hrs instead of 10 or 12 since the pace feels rushed, and scenes have been badly altered (Jack's been carving stone in the woods for years when he and Ellen meet Tom. WTF?!?!)or added (King Stephen's imagined pyschodrama with his uncle, King Henry). And the fight over the quarry between Jack and Walter?! C'mon! And sadly so much of Phillip's brilliance at politics, leadership, and outmaneuvering others is lost.

In fairness, they got some scenes right in the first 2 hours but that's it. The studio should have really given this great book its due and have made it LONGER. If you read the book, think twice before watching this. Better yet, hope that some other studio gives it a more substantial treatment.",1341360000,3,1547,4.3310344827586205

As a student of medieval history, specifically Norman/English (UK), I was impressed by the foreign film makers' filming locations, studio settings (when used) and selection of actors.  The script and sequences kept well to the context of Follett's novel, acknowledging the latter's literary license in characterizing some of the leads--i.e. King Stephen, his son Eustace, the Bishop and some of the actual Earls of the realm, of the period.  The overwhelming power of the Roman Catholic Church and the protracted wars and upheavals of the time, understanding the lack of impunity with which the aristocracy and royalty interpreted moral behavior and practiced malevolent corruption, coupled with the backdrop of appalling conditions rendered by the feudal system: all are credibly captured in the DVD for the viewing public.",1338249600,,950,5.32

Then the first disc of the film which I got from Netflix:  I realize that the story had to be adapted, to cut it down to size.  But WHY did they destroy the story of Jack's father, a jongleur, a story teller, who told long long stories to Ellen who told them to Jack who tells them to Aliena in his courtship.  In the dramatic beginning of the book, this man is hung and sings his story as they hang him.  In the film, Ellen tells Tom that his tongue was cut out and they burned him at the stake.  Good grief.  The whole tale of Ellen and her place in the story are based on what happened to Jack's father and, dismissing it, dismisses a crucial part of Pillars of the Earth.

4196389,5,B003UD7J9E,"We are in a new golden age of television today, a time rich in historical, science fiction, speculative and fantasy drama.  And this series, Pillars of the Earth, is a perfect example of the fine fare being offered to us now regularly. Right up there in production values with The Tudors,  this is a fast paced and suspenseful and thoroughly entertaining drama. It is leagues beyond the older slow moving and often poorly conceived historical dramas of yesterday's television.  Beautifully written by John Pielmeier, and lavishly filmed with excellent cinematography and art direction, this series carries one back to the great age of cathedral building --- inviting us to surrender to  a brutal yet fascinating world where good fights against evil in spite of endless defeat.  Matthew MacFadyen is superb in this, as is Rufus Sewell, Donald Sutherland and Ian MaShane and just about every other member of the large cast.  This is dark, yet always fun, and the glimpse we get into the making of cathedrals is tantalizing and enthralling.  Highly  recommended.  If you've given up on historical series in the past because of the poor quality, by all means give this a try.  As I said above, we are in a new golden age of television now.  I have bought the Ken Follett novel on which this is based.  Enjoy as we await the sequel.",1336694400,2,1327,4.797356828193832

4196394,2,B003UD7J9E,"I just finished watching The Pillars of the Earth, having not read the original Follett novel.  I am well-studied in the reign of King Stephen (1135-1154) which scholars used to unanimously call the ""Anarchy"" (though this tag is outdated).  To be concise:

PROS: This series does an excellent job at capturing the ""feel"" of an early 12th century setting: costumes, sets, politics, dialogue.  A lot of effort in that department; the only bit lacking was that the series failed to truly capture the ins and outs of monastic life (replacing it with a rather 2-dimensional travesty).

Also, many elements of a rather obscure period are brought to light (with many notable exceptions).  The sinking of the White Ship, the ascendancy of Henry II, the outcomes and locations of various battles.

CONS: The series is riddled with historical inaccuracies. Though I am a historian, I am actually okay with a little tweaking as long as it ""puts the ring in the fire"" (obligatory LotR).  However, the elements that were simply made up piled higher and higher as the series progressed, that the story evolved into a completely alien world.  The assassination plots, evil bishops, royal deaths in battle, whole towns- all fabricated.  This is fairly typical for historical films, and isn't always bad, but this series typically failed to use their modifications for good.  The ""assassination"" of Henry I by poison, for example, was thrown in, completely contrived, for additional intrigue and was barely dealt with again besides a little extra blackmailing by the evil bishop.  If I had to bet, I'd say that bit probably wasn't in the bestselling novel, because bestselling authors know better than to randomly have elderly kings poisoned for no good reason.

And don't get me started on the ""every advance in medieval architecture was invented by the same chap"" bit.

Another con is this series' dire need to give the masses ""what they want"" on screen repeatedly...and apparently what they want is 1) Old people having sex, 2) Other old people having sex with their own grown-up children, 3) A 20-something frat boy prince raping a 13 year-old a few times, and 4) A half-dozen sex scenes involving the same character with various men (one a rape), who happens to be a main character whom we have to look in the eye for the rest of the series.  Now I don't think I'm the only one who finds all these things a little bit excessive.  With fewer of the writers' personal fetishes on display, the series could have been a lot more enjoyable.

The final con of this series is about its message.  Its message is the same tired old ""medieval movies"" message that typically has Ridley Scott's name behind it if you look hard enough (Kingdom of Heaven, Robin Hood, 1492: Conquest of Paradise): ""Everyone was doing just fine until Christianity came along, and suddenly everyone started killing each other.  In fact, the whole world would be better off if that Jesus hadn't decided to start a religion by dying on the cross.  It's belief in anything or anyone except ""mankind"" (whatever that actually means) or possibly ""love"" (just...you know, in general!  Something something love!) that has led to all the world's problems.  Now can we get past these Dark Ages and get back to glorifying Empiricism and Science please?""  I'm sorry, Mr. Scott.  Historians disagree with you...free thinkers disagree with you.  Some of us find plenty to be proud of in our heritage.  Some of us are open-minded enough to find valuable ideas from periods not our own.  If the only plot you can come up with for a medieval film is ""the evil CHURCH is responsible for all the sweet, precious babies dying!"" then I'd rather watch Mel Gibson butcher history in Braveheart or Apocalypto than any of your films.  At least when he does it, I don't have to spend the rest of my weekend weeping for our generation.",1333929600,19,3863,4.829787234042553
4196395,3,B003UD7J9E,"Inspired by and based on a bestselling novel by Ken Follett, The Pillars of the Earth is a sprawling epic that takes place during the turbulent English reign of King Stephen...

When a ship goes down crossing the English channel bearing the future heir to the throne, King Henry I is forced to contend with the possibility that his throne may go to his daughter, Maud (Alison Pill), and her descendants. Little does he know that his nephew, Stephen (Tony Curran), has ambitions toward becoming ruler -- at any cost, and together with the evil Bishop Waleran (Ian McShane), strives to make his deepest desire a reality. The monarch meets his end the same night that his daughter bears England an heir, leaving Stephen to crown himself king and set off a bloody civil war. Maude has on her side one of the foremost nobleman at court (Donald Sutherland), but when he is found out and rumors of his intent to assist Maude in reclaiming the throne reach the ear of Stephen, retribution spills out into the night -- leaving many casualties. His children, Richard (Sam Claflin) and Aliena (Hayley Atwell), manage to escape, but not for long... and she is particularly sought after by a ruthless knight, William (David Oakes), who has other intentions than making her his wife...

Meanwhile, a stonemason named Tom Builder (Rufus Sewell) takes refuge in the cave of an outcast, Ellen (Natalia Wrner), along with his heavily pregnant wife and their two children. But his wife, suspicious of their surroundings and certain that Ellen is a witch, insists on going once more out into the winter cold -- resulting in her death and his decision to leave the newly born child on her grave to die. But when he returns for it, the child is missing. Ellen and her son Jack (Eddie Redmayne) accompany Tom and his family into the local parish, to look for work, but the church, although in disrepair, cannot afford to pay to have the structure rebuilt. But when fire rages through what remains of the church and destroys their holy relics, Prior Philip () not only faces a pang of conscience in whether or not to replace the relics with counterfeits but also a tremendous burden in building a structure that soon will become the bane of Waleran's existence and bring about much strife, discourse, and rivalry over the next twenty years.

 Although fairly wide in its scope and epic in the sense that it has an enormous character base (more than a dozen main characters turn up in the course of the story), there is something lacking in this miniseries. In some respects it remains faithful to the novel and in others it strays significantly, right to altering characters' personalities, bringing in incestuous elements, and changing major plot arcs in the last two hours. The cast is magnificent but the characters do not give off much of a sense of depth and the writer doesn't know what to do with his villains -- they are sufficiently evil but one questions his own actions so much that he fails to be as frightening as he should be; the other is manipulative but hardly emotionally intimidating. Many of the characters are simply not that likable, the boldest exception being Prior Philip -- in part due to Matthew Macfayden's sensitive depiction of a naive man left to contend with political upheaval. In some instances the storyline feels forced, but then perhaps I was thrown off a bit by the content. The middle ages were not pleasant and the story does not shy away from that, sometimes showing us its horrors in great detail. On the up side, it does have an incredible score and beautiful photography, and the final hour is particularly gripping and solid in terms of storytelling.

Some of the historical events in this series are inaccurate, but it does interest one in the time period and the events of the age. I found certain plot twists very solid and enjoyable and others seemed contrived. But I will say it would have been altogether more enjoyable without the gratuitous emphasis on rape, incest, and vulgarity.",1332892800,6,4010,4.755747126436781

Sex, blood, war, stonemasonry and an awesome nightmare scene.  The production value was excellent as well, being truly cinematic in quality. The fantastic written story made this epic tale a must for cinematic adaptation and it was not corrupted during translation. This particular blu-ray also has some decent extras (token making-of documentary, special effects and scene design and 1 or 2 other ones that didn't impress) but none are extraordinary.

4196410,2,B003UD7J9E,"As a history buff with an particular fascination with the Gothic era, I had high hopes for this mini-series.  It promised not only the court intrigue and a particular view into an alien age, but at its core it was about the achievement of a new art from:  the Cathedrals that required the development of fundamental innovations in stonework, in structural engineering, and in the mobilization of communities, sometimes for centuries.  Instead, I found a film that drowned in graphic sex, horrendous violence, and two-dimensional characters.  It is full of ridiculous stereotypes about the Medieval era, though there are some redeeming features.  I say this less as a pedant than with disappointment that I could not become absorbed in a narrative with a sense of awe and longing to know more.  Alas, with its lurid details and melodramatic plot lines, I could not suspend my disbelief.  Even my high school daughter was disgusted at its lack of subtlety and finesse.  This is second rate.

The plot is complicated, involving a sunken ship, secrets later uncovered because of a stolen ring, a coup that initiates a generation of civil war, and unscrupulous courtiers, both religious and secular.  Lower down, there is a master mason with a vision, who finds a situation in a village with an extraordinary Prior, who is not only going to build an early Gothic Cathedral, but revive the economy of an entire region.  Of course, this pits the Prior - a pious, honorable, good, and competent man - against the interests of aggressively evil rivals.  Obstacles to the Cathedral are thrown up, there is lots of violence and lust, but all's well that ends well in spite of many tragic injustices.

There are some extremely good actors in this.  Unfortunately, the director largely squanders their talents.  Some of it is indeed moving, such as the love between the humble mason and the disgraced princess, but most of it fits into silly film conventions, like the princess' brother becoming a crusader to redeem himself over the 20 years, taking the most brutal vengeance when the time comes, or the working out of prophesies.

If you want a kind of slashing swashbuckler with good v. evil, etc., this is passable.  I wanted much more than this, which I believe it could have been.  Not recommended.",1329264000,3,2291,4.891191709844559

Given that Ken Follett had so much control over the production, it was inevitable that it would be superior, but I was surprised at just how well done it was. Right off, I noted the casting was perfect. Rufus Sewell's Tom Builder was exactly as I pictured him: handsome, strong, and a bit rough at the edges. The rest of the cast was outstanding as well. The mini series format made it possible to capture all the detail and complicated plot lines, which a two hour movie would never be able to do effectively. Some reviewers have commented that the plot was changed. I didn't notice any, possibly because I read the book a few years back, but if so it didn't hurt the overall tone or outcome of the story.

Alas, I was quite disappointed. I don't know how closely the story holds to the book, but the failures of the series are almost entirely with the writing. The plot twists, which can be spotted a mile away, range from mildly annoying to outright absurd, and the characters' motivations are rarely fully (or sometimes even partly) justified. Political alliances and enmities often make no sense. The bad guys are so over-the-top bad as to be uninteresting. All of which is a shame, because the series has a lot going for it: terrific sets and costumes, a very good cast (especially Matthew Macfayden and Hayley Atwell), and the bones of a potentially engrossing story.

Others can quibble about the series not following the book exactly but, in my view, that would be impossible, considering the scope of the work. The ""Making Of"" extra covers that point very well, explaining why they insisted on at least eight hours to do justice to Pillars. And do justice they did! All of the players were well-cast but Ian McShane stole the show with his complex portrayal of Bishop Bigod, an evil and corrupt man who believed completely that his machinations were justified by God.

My wife pointed out, as the series neared it's end, that several of the cast members showed no aging, while others were made up to appear older. Again, I consider that to be a minor quibble, as are the previous remarks about the battle sequences. In fact, perhaps disbelief should be suspended in these areas. Just enjoy the show!

As for the video quality? The Blu Ray is beautiful! Viewed on a 60"" Sony LED TV, with sound through a rather good sound system, I couldn't ask for more. I believe you'll agree with me.

This is a series I and my wife will watch again and again. In fact, these disks may well induce me to read the book a third time. It's that good!

If you freeze frame at the end there is one part where you can see his hair under the bad rug. All in all not a bad film, I am not sure who to blame for the low quality ending. The director, the lack of budget or if the series was low in popularity and stars cut their budget. The overall history of the time period is very interesting to me and the majority of the events were based on fact though some of their depictions I found humorous for the unintended purpose.

4196445,5,B003UD7J9E,"This review will cover different aspects, but I'll comment on the Blu-Ray first:  as of today, the Blu-Ray costs $4.50 more than the regular DVD.  It's worth it, IMO.  It has great image quality and sound.

My wife had read the book, and then saw that a movie channel was running it (divided into 9 episodes).  After watching the first two episodes, she ordered the Blu-Ray set.  It got here quickly (Amazon's regular shipping), so we saw it before the movie channel had finished their nightly telecasts of the series.  Both of us really enjoyed the DVDs.  A lot.

When we watch a movie based on a book, we rate the movie on its production, the acting, how engrossed we get in it, and how much we enjoy it, rather than how it compares to the book.  I give this movie 5 stars.  My wife gives the book 5 stars, and also gives 5 stars to the movie.
The acting is first rate, the cinematography is outstanding, and the plot holds one's attention for the entire seven hours.

That movie channel had me a little confused at first - they were televising 9 episodes, not 8.  Was there a sequel that I couldn't learn anything about?  The answer is NO, I think.  It appears that channel put all eight episodes together, then divided it into 9 episodes.  That way they could fit in more commercials.  That's just a guess on my part, though.
Even with them making 9 episodes, the TV version lacks some of the scenes that are on the DVDs.

Bottom line:  we're very glad we bought the DVDs, especially the Blu-Ray version.",1323561600,3,1508,4.418181818181818

4196447,4,B003UD7J9E,"I had high hopes for this series because I love the book, yet I have somewhat mixed feelings about the miniseries.
  First, the visuals are stunning-- costuming, sets, the cathedral, everything. However, it is sad that the book--which is about religious and artistic passion and ethics versus greed and corruption-- morphs for the miniseries into a much simpler tale of sexual passions and political corruption, with art and religion as an afterthought-- merely as the stage upon which life and sex are played.  The characters in the book are complex and often tortured; the characters in the DVD set are flat and simplistic.  There are also unfortunate changes to the story line regarding architectural innovation and discovery.
  These and other changes dumb down the essential themes that make the book so extraordinary. Follet's book gives the reader a glimpse into the past. It teaches a bit about cathedral architecture and construction and it allows the reader to put these into a larger cultural, religious, and political context. The DVD series, rather than transporting the modern viewer into the past, takes the modern archetypes of the lone pioneering artist, the misunderstood gay man, the political flip-flopper, and the wise pagan and overlays them on a story of the past. While this sort of ""ahah, those people were just like us"" message has a place in movies and literature, it doesn't work with this miniseries. It makes the characters from the book who are grand and courageous and heroic into movie people who are disturbingly familiar-- petty and grasping and lustful and simply too human-- average people who stumble into greatness and immortality rather than (as they are in the book) grand visionaries who overcome their muddy and bloody times through hard work, honor, and passion to create something grand and beautiful and eternal.
  I've written a rather more negative review than I intended to because I enjoyed the miniseries in spite of the fact that is compares poorly with the book. It is exquisite visually, the pacing is good for such a complex story line, and it has some solidly interesting characters. I give it four stars. Go ahead and buy this. It is probably superior to anything at your local multiplex theatre. But while you're at it, buy the book as well. They have the same title but they are two very different stories.

This is an EXTREMELY well-written and well-made series - absolutely top rate in every department.  The story is superb, the costumes and settings are on par with any medieval epic movie ever made, and it's just a fantastic piece of work.  What else would one expect from something that Ridley Scott had his hand in?  On a humorous note, I did notice some of the same costumes from ""Kingdom of Heaven"" had been recycled for use in this mini-series and nobody seems to have mentioned that - just thought that was amusing and it told me I am far too much of a history and movie geek!

OUTSTANDING series and a bargain at twice the price - if I could give this one six or seven stars I would.  If you love history, buy this series, it WILL keep you entertained and you will be impressed.",1322438400,2,931,4.261363636363637
4196449,5,B003UD7J9E,"As a huge fan of the book, I must say that I loved this series!  Like other reviewers have mentioned (some with obvious displeasure), there are some deviations from the book.  However, I don't think that it took away from the television version at all.  There are very few film adaptations of books that are verbatim replicas of their literary counterparts, and many of them are wonderful and successful.  To me, this falls in that category.  Also, Ken Follett actually participated in the writing of the series, so any departures from the book had his hand in them.  Ultimately, none of them changed the overall plot, theme, or outcome of the story, anyway.

The series is based in the 12th century (aka The Nineteen-Year Winter) during a period known as the Anarchy where there was a succession battle raging between King Henry I's daughter Matilda (Maude) and his nephew Stephen as Henry's only legitimate son (and heir to the throne) died in a shipwreck.  An unemployed architect named Tom who is traveling with his two children, Alfred and Martha, and his lover, Ellen, and her son, Jack, come across a town called Kingsbridge where the very pious Prior Philip commissions him to rebuild the priory's cathedral.  In order to do so, Tom needs access to a nearby quarry to obtain stone.  Of course, this is easier said than done as the quarry is given to Percy Hamleigh as part of his earldom.  As the balance of power shifts back and forth between Stephen and Maude, so do the rights to the quarry.

To complicate matters, enter ""the girl"", the likewise high-born Aliena, who has blown off Percy Hamleigh's son, William.  Percy and William clearly don't like being snubbed, so this brings on a whole mess of vengeful acts that end up involving Aliena's father and his lands.  Similarly, whoever has the upper hand in these disputes changes with whoever is winning the war at the time, Stephen or Maude.  Aliena eventually finds herself in Kingsbridge where she becomes the object of both Alfred and Jack's affection, who already have a rivalry going over Tom's fatherly affections and attentions especially pertaining to who is higher in his eyes as a builder's apprentice.

Meanwhile, tensions are rising between Prior Philip and the presiding Bishop Waleran, who has his own motives to prevent the cathedral from being completed.  Waleran's alliances shift from party to party, and he seeks to destroy his ever-growing list of enemies as the story progresses.  He also doesn't hesitate to use his connections with the Church to pull strings as this was centuries before England had broken away from Catholicism and thus still answered to Rome.  Further complications arise when it is discovered that Tom and Ellen are living as husband and wife though they are not actually married.  Ellen, who is a self-proclaimed free spirit who lived with Jack alone in the woods before meeting Tom, is quickly accused of witchcraft which obviously doesn't go over well with the monks.

The series is politically smart drawing heavily on common law principles and class hierarchy of the English Middle Ages.  There is a definite distinction between the ""good guys"" and the ""bad guys"" in the book; however, there are disputes even within the members of each of these two groups that make it difficult for each of them to advance their own causes.  The characters are very well-developed.  If they're one of the good guys, you're rooting for them the whole time; but if they're one of the rotten apples, you hate them with a passion... and with very good reason.

The set and cinematography is impressive as well.  The series takes place primarily in castles, medieval towns, and around cathedrals, and it looks like no detail was spared.

The casting was pretty stellar as well.  Worth noting: Matthew Macfadyen as Prior Philip, David Oakes as William Hamleigh, and Ian McShane as Bishop Waleran Bigod.  Honestly, Ian McShane stole the show.  He absolutely rocked.  An actor who can make you hate his character that much has some serious talent.  His portrayal was exactly how I imagined Waleran in the book.

A sidenote: if you like this series and the book, check out Ken Follett's semi-sequel, ""World Without End"".  It's based in Kingsbridge several centuries later.  Great book!",1321920000,,4274,4.905292479108635

4196461,5,B003UD7J9E,"Pillars of the earth is a rarely known historical drama mini-series. It was initially released on July 23rd 2010, and spans one season (eight episodes). The setup to the storyline, as detailed on the production's website begins in a time of great struggle:

""This epic tale begins against a background of crisis caused by the disruption of the succession to the English crown. King Henry's only legitimate son has died in the fiery sinking of the White Ship, leaving Henry's daughter Maud, his nephew Stephen and his bastard son Gloucester to compete for the crown.""

Note: I have not read the book upon which the the story is based, so I cannot attest to its adaptation on screen. However, this hopefully gave me a more unbiased point of view towards the cinema.

EDIT: 1/24/2015 - Cut many sections and edited a few to reduce size of the review.

----

The Story.

The show itself details many different characters and their interactions during a span of some 25+ years throughout the series. The show did a great job at weaving these characters in and out of each thread in the story, that is to say, that each episode sought to combine different groups of characters. The mix in style of performances from the actors was never lacking due to this brilliant configuration.

The characters represented a fairly evenly distributed force of good and evil, rich caste and poor caste. In fact, morality was one of the central themes I got from the series, it was one of the cores that made it such a great story. Greed, Lust, Envy, Pride, Justice and Revenge were many of the themes of the story as well, and these are used in balance.

The show's core story felt slightly out of touch midway through the series. The story however always had continuous linkage, and seemed to rarely miss any details that would leave the audience unaware.

----

The Cast and Performance.

The acting was fairly top notch. The show had enlisted several famous faces to mingle with the new crowd of actors given, in some cases, their first real chance at a role. This good blend of actors and acting experience seemed payed off. It seemed to me that since most every character interacted in at least one scene together throughout the series, actors and actresses took advantage of this and taught each other some new tricks. Most of the characters were not crippled by a rigid, static acting style like many of these period pieces seem to have. Even the extras seemed to do a great job at translating everything from showing the gruntness of a guard to portrayng a townsperson, or traveling trader fairly well.

I am fairly happy to see that the show didn't prejudice against the newer faces. Experienced actors' characters seemed to be sacrificed throughout the story at least, if not more than the newer actors. This preserved the good mix of both young and old, experienced and novice actors throughout the show.

Many of the actors were not only forced to keep in line with the period in history, but had to consider that their character would age. Some characters in the beginning of the series were young, but at the end, many years had passed, and the actors were now portraying an older character that held many experiences throughout his or her lifetime. Some characters were even portrayed by more than one actor, that character having grown older in the season. The choices in these dual actors were placed well too. Most of the young characters looked very similar to their older counterparts.

It seems all actors had either rehearsed well, or simply performed in this style of role easily. The cast rarely seemed `out of their element' or `spacey' as if there were no interest from the real live person in the project. The actors did a good job at gently feeding a more modern acting style to what could have been a somewhat stolid period piece. They brought true emotion to the screen, and I felt they did a great job at portraying their characters, the best part of any drama.

----

Environment and Set Design.

Scene changes and locations varied often, adding to the effect that the world within was actually larger than what the camera was showing.

I particularly thought the use of a map to show the location of a major scene change was a great addition, and kept me in focus on the location of each party. From whole towns, to battlefields, to actual churches, castles, and monasteries, the show itself spared no expense in immersing the viewer in the world in which the characters were living.

Due attention was given to character's dress as well. Costumes and clothing seemed to fit well within the time period. From horses and armor to cottons, leather, and fleece, to richly laid satins, the character's clothing seemed to always enhance their presence.

----

Filming and Directing.

Film elements and directing elements seemed to be spot-on. Things such as certain character spacing, movements within scenes, and camera angles were sometimes varied to enhance or redirect the mood of the episode. Physical elements such as earth, water, fire and wind provided great supplement to the intensity of certain scenes.

Flashbacks and dreams were used sparingly, but could clearly be seen apart from the ""true"" world. Camera elements such as flaring up, shifting out of focus, and hand carrying the camera were used on occasion as well, but did not consume the arena. The general feel of movement was smooth, lengthy, revealing shots. I think this made the viewing experience enjoyable.

One of the best parts of the series is that special effects are not over-abused as in some other shows. Special effects are saved for scenes with explosions, fires, dreamlike worlds, and sweeping camera zooms over terrain and buildings.

Live special effects did not appear fake. The show gracefully combined most computer generated effects with live effects. A few beginning and end scene landscape intros were less detailed.

----

Flow and Execution.

The pace of the series was very good, and for the most part lent itself to  a steady buildup. I never came back on myself and began thinking that I was in some way wasting my time, and similarly, I never found myself confused by the flow or content. Though there were one or two episodes that had me thinking I was merely spending my time averagely, containing some scenes that to me, seemed a bit lackluster, these other episodes did seem necessary to the story as a whole, and the series was not split by any means.

The flow was smoothe. At least two threads (individual side stories) were followed at any point in the series. This made the show interesting. Many of these threads would circle each other and come to a point near the end of an episode, or resolve in a later one.

Subtle hints were not too revealing, and had me guessing on what would happen. Though some were more obvious, and meant to reveal a path or possible path of the story, I liked how these were in place, however, I still think they missed the mark on some occasions.

----

Use of Violence, Language, and Sex.

Violence - almost every kind shown. Though most instances are due to battle or duels, several scenes also depict murder, hateful or otherwise cruel actions toward others, and even mutilation.

The use of violence was well justified and tactfully placed, as many violent actions took a real role in the story. Seeing the act go through set in my mind the resolve of the characters being depicted. I never at any point thought the use of violence was unfounded. There always seemed to be a cause, even if the cause was unusual in nature.

Language - Use of language was rare and in many cases non existent. Most usages were in relation to God or other Christian related saints and relics. I felt this helped emphasize when the characters were truly upset or angry without overusing the medium. For the most part, the characters meant what they said, so there was real credit when for example, the bad guy swears he will kill someone.

Sex - Nudity and the act of sex were not spared either. I think the use of it was not a bad idea, I simply think the show misused and overused this element. Scenes often used full frame, full body shots when some of them might have been better placed with a partially naked or close up shot. These type of scenes tended to last longer than the normal scene.

This in some cases disturbed me more than lent me to the emotion that the characters were feeling, which I think was the original intent. Not all use of the element was bad though. Maybe the issue I had with this element was due to the rapid pace of the lifetimes of characters within the show. The adaptation from the book may have left little room to prepare certain relationships. Either way, I truly disliked some of this aspect.

--

Pillars of the earth lends itself to some of the great works of all time. It draws on elements that I think any mature audience would enjoy, and keeps the mind fully engaged throughout the series. From the visuals, to the acting, to the story, I believe this show to be a true work of art, drawing a vivid comparison to modern day issues and even modern day lives.

I highly recommend this series. It is one of the best series I've ever seen. It views like reading a novel. One might think this would ruin the story, but in this case, it only enhances the telling of such a tall tale.

4196463,4,B003UD7J9E,"""The Pillars of the Earth"" is my favorite novel of all time. Despite the length, it kept my interest the whole time and told a magnificent story. I was nervous about watching the mini-series because usually these do not live up the novel. I was write, but it still was a fun watch.
The series does deviate and cut (the book is 1000pages long so some cutting is understandable) quite a bit from the original story. No spoilers but some major events are gone or just forgotten about. Ken Follet himself is in the series as a peasant at one point so that lets you know that he did approve the changes.
Otherwise, the series is very entertaining. The introduction for every episode is absolutely beautiful. The acting is superb and the set is very well made. Costumes are top notch as well. Prior Phillip is especially well acted I feel. The special features are well made and show clear effort.

This is because the quality is extremely good; the high definition is really remarkable. The contrast of the colors and detail you would not normally see on a DVD is very vivd and noticeable through this Blueray version. The series as a whole is just a really good all around story. Like any novel turned into a movie, it is not all exactly correct. This TV mini-series mixes love, romance, politics, religion, hate, treachery, anarchy, and more, in one big captivating 8-part story. This Blueray edition includes the expected 8 episodes about an hour in length per episode. There was only one slight issue, however, it might not even be the blueray movie that has the issue but rather our TV. For some reason when people speak, there is a slight deep robotic sounding malfunction when people spoke in a deep voice. It is barely noticeable, and this has happened with another Blueray movie we bought, (which was one of the Harry Potter movies). It is nothing to be concerned about, since it seems as if it isn't the Blueray disc, but the blueray player or TV that we have that has the issues.

This 8-part series is gory, romantic, dark, and yet enlightening in a way that's very difficult to describe.

In the 1000+ paged book, Follett took me to medieval England, and crafted his characters with exquisite detail.  The video series, shot in Hungary, recreates Follett's settings and characters in an engaging story true to the novel.  This is not for the squeamish or faint of heart.  There are plenty of violent deaths, evil-doers extraordinaire, who prey on the protagonists using political cunning and religion.  I highly recommend reading the book first.  Otherwise, the connections between the various characters might be diminished.

I don't understand people who always compare the movie to the book. I have rarely, if ever, have seen a movie that is better or as good as the book. And, I certainly do not bother judging a movie by comparing it to the book it is based on. A movie is someone else's vision and not my vision that I have created in my own mind, which is why I prefer to read.
Considering that Ken Follett (the author) was involved in this project, or it at least appeared so when they interviewed him and showed him walking around on the set while filming (on the special features part of the dvd), he gave it his personal thumbs up, and that's good enough for me.
We rented disk 1 at Blockbuster and enjoyed it so much we went and rented disks 2&3 the same day and stayed up till 2:30am because we kept looking forward to finding out what was going to happen in the next scene and the next and the next, until we had seen the whole movie.

While I am in agreement with several other reviewers that the symmetry of the hangings at the beginning and the end of the book are deeply missed (""The boys came early to the hanging"" is the opening line of the first and last chapters of the book),  the adaptation makes what appear to be carefully thought out choices to make the story ""work"" better for a TV audience.  The movie emphasizes the political struggles of the time far more than the book and the royals end up getting far more attention as a result.  A prophecy that never appears in the book, but works as a story-telling device, binds this thread.  There is implied incest in one storyline in order to make characters appear even more beyond-the-pale immoral than they already are that doesn't appear in the book and is unneccessary.  A ring and a letter are invented to make a story of treason stick because we can't have 100 pages of information to peice the mystery together ourselves.  An improbable trial takes place toward the end of the mini-series in order to get rid of a character no one likes (he is murdered and the trial involves someone wrongly accused) and to avoid having to spend time deepening a peripheral character who, in the book, becomes the new prior after Philip is too old to carry on.  They mess with how long it took to build the cathedral, etc... There are other deviations from the book's plot as well, but the point is that most of these changes work to simplify the plot enough to condense it into 8 hours.
One of the glories of the book for me is the fact that Follet uses his imagination to create an inner life for his characters that feels very modern.  The medieval world can feel very alien, with it's very real fear of hell, violence very thinly under the surface of life for many people, etc...  Follet takes real history about the fact that at least some of peoples' motivations don't change and gives us something that even a non-scholar can connect to.  The reason the book is so incredibly long is that Follet lovingly creates this world, never leaving out a shading (one could argue that this works with how long it took to build a cathedral and how much slower the pace of life was at the time as well).  The book and the mini-series are different enough that you can experience either of them first and still find the other satisfying.
My husband, who majored in medieval history in college, put the book down in disgust when he read the description of Tom and Ellen and how quickly they became a couple (something the mini-series addresses by creating a decent interval between when Tom's wife dies and these two finally getting together).  He would argue that the internal dialogue that Follet creates for his characters is far too modern for the medieval setting.  He actually enjoyed the mini series and is thinking of trying to overcome his problems with Follet's writing to try and read it again.  I missed some of the story points from the book, but loved the fact that the miniseries had the same feel as the book and that so many of the characters jumped off the page because of the fine acting involved.
My point is, watch the mini-series AND read the book -- they are both worth it.",1308700800,5,3364,4.548013245033113
4196506,2,B003UD7J9E,"I just watched the first episode on Netflix and don't intend to bother with the rest of this. Why? I just finished the book and this is just a clunky, choppy caricature of it, clunky in its annoying little plot changes and choppy in the abbreviations. In trying to be true to the book, the writer failed both in not following it close enough to make a smooth transition to the screen, and in following it too closely for those of us who read the book to accept the screenplay on its own (and let's face it, this wasn't network TV, if you sought it out, you read the book).

Besides all that, the casting is off. I don't believe in Prior Phillip (he's too nice), Ellen (where's the golden contact lenses?), Aliena (she's not voluptuous enough), Regan Hamleigh (where's the ugly?), and most of all William Hamleigh (where's the pale, sweaty, overmuscled blonde, with a stupid-blank look and mean-fat face).

How bad is it? The first couple of pages of any good book has to get you hooked. ""Pillars"" does this with a public hanging complete with cruel taunting kids, the accused singing his swan song, an acrimonious curse from his witchy wife, and a spurting spray of chicken blood on his accusers.

Well one would think but its on my to-read list and I hadn't thought I'd read it but the whole plot seemed strangely familiar.  But this isn't a bad thing because I absolutely loved the series.  Sure it had a few things that could have been better, but largely it was excellent and very captivating.

Based on the book by Ken Follett, Pillars of the Earth has a very simple premise that is made much more complicated by the events of the time it is set in.  It is Tom Builder's dream to work on a cathedral.  He is a master stone mason and very good at his work, but having trouble finding jobs in the turbulent times after the King's death.  What makes this time so turbulent?  There is an usurper to the throne over the King's daughter and her infant son and the country is in an uproar as she fights the new King Stephen for her rightful place and to secure the throne for her young son.

Mixed into this is Prior Phillip, a man dedicated to god but still ambitious in his own way.  He wants to see a cathedral built, and with Tom set in his path he sees a way to build the best cathedral ever.  But of course nothing is as easy as it seems, politics and jealousy reign high in this time and not all want to see a cathedral built or the prosperity it will bring to the area.  It will be years of struggle to try to build this building with so many tragedies along the way.

As you can see there were quite a few characters in this series just as a listing of main characters.  But I do have to say they were all fantastic!  There were some that were just so easy to hate and they did a wonderful job of being the bad guy.  Like always, Ian McShane was one of those bad guys (I don't think I've ever seen him play a nice person) and he was devious, dangerous, and many other scary attributes.  Tom Builder was sweet and I really enjoyed his character although some of his motivations confused me at times.  All of the actors and actresses portraying the role of the Hamleigh's were fantastic as well.  They were very believable and you could feel the ambition that the mother especially possessed.  The only character I really didn't connect to with Ellen.  Not to be too much of a spoiler, but with her background of being a nun, her character in the present time of the show is hard to believe with that inconsistency of her path.  I can see rebelling a little, but the extend that she changes/grew from that time period in her life makes me a little skeptical.

As stated before I really liked the plot and notion of the series.  Even though the basic premise is about building a cathedral, there are so many sub plots and other things going on that it is really quite exciting.  But something to bear in mind when starting this series is that it contains some very mature themes.  There is nudity, cussing, violence, implied romance and much more.  Those opposed to these things probably shouldn't watch it.  I on the other hand loved that they made it that realistic as I think it absorbs the viewer more into the times and lives of these people.

Excellent series that I highly recommend watching.  I know I""ll probably watch it again and read the book again.

Set in medieval times in the town of Kingsbridge the story follows the life and death of Tom builder and his extended family, in the building of a new cathedral.

4196517,1,B003UD7J9E,"Save your money and read the book instead.  The changes to the story, as well as the over-acting, make this the equivalent of a bad after-school movie special.  None of the actors fit the mold of the book characters.  So what, you say?  This is television and not the book, you say?  Try this:  This series completely fails to provide believable motivations for any character.  Whether hateful or loving or jealous or greedy, there is no background to aid you in figuring out why the person acts as he does.  Next, as a stand-alone vehicle, this series does not tell a complete story.  If you haven't read the book, it will make no sense.  And then there's the anti-church story-line.  The church at this time had problems, but this portrayal is cartoonish with a junior-high school student view of the world.  The cardinal is the foul-mouthed Deadwood actor, and he apparently seems to think that, by not using the f-word in every sentence, he has delivered a different performance in this series.  Same character without the naughty words. I'll save you the purchase and tell you the Marxian story:  Catholic church leaders are evil hypocrites without any faith who, along with the landed gentry, exist to exploit the masses.  Maybe that fits your worldview (isn't this 2011 and not 1917??), but buy a movie that can tell a story with subtlety.",1306195200,18,1346,4.766233766233766

The expectation was partially fulfilled, though... I think the caracters are very well developed, with splendid actors, and the little modifications on the relashionships (as of the incestuous case between William and his mother) were a nice touch.
You can't expect and actually is very nice to see some differences between the book and the movie. The only thing that I would complain is that I think that the budget of the series run out after the 7th chapter... Until there you have pretty much the same rhythm of the book. But in chapters 7 and 8 the story starts to run and a lot of situations came in astonishing speed.
The final scene is totally incoherent with all the developement of the series... And uncopatible with a middle age behaviour... You cannot ask for a historically total accuracy but this was too much.

Although some viewers might be upset that these episodes might not follow the book exactly, that is true of most of the made for tv movies and it stands alone as a rollicking terrific adventure series. The acting is wonderful with sometimes over the top performances by the actor who portrays Waleran Bigod as the scurrilous villain and Rufus Sewell(Tom Builder) as a simple journeyman with a vision, and the actor who portrays Lady Aliena as a woman who survives adversity to become a successful businesswoman and endures much deprivation to be reunited with her true love at last. It's hard to believe that just managing to stay alive and struggle in medieval times was so hard, even to the point that you and your family faced starvation every day.

Rufus Sewell as Tom Builder and each of the female leads were all good.

4196535,1,B003UD7J9E,"About as historically accurate and as sensitive to the Medieval World as Men in Tights, though probably more humorous, albeit unintentionally.
  The characters are one dimensional, the plot confused, attention to details such as the aging process mostly non existent (no one ages,  except a baby boy who  shoots up -  his twelve year old sister must have found the elixir of eternal youth), the dialogue is woodenly anachronistic (e.g. after the Cathedral's vaulted roof comes crashing down and seventy nine people are crushed by the very 'stones' we see bouncing off their heads like light cardboard cutaways the Prior says 'We will conduct an investigation into the matter'), a sliced off ear seems to miraculously and inexplicable grow back (except for one shot where we are meant to remember the character who is so otherwise unforgettable), and so on. Another reviewer complained about the Hollywood teeth - one could also mention the botox, manicures, coiffured hair and other such necessities of Hollywood vanity that a half-way decent director would eliminate from a Medieval set. To be fair there are moments which look quite good or are dramatically engaging.  But they are few and far between, and as the story develops everything becomes increasingly ridiculous.  The accumulation of howlers, however, does stimulate a ghoulish fascination. It also carries within it a smug sense of modern moral superiority as we observe people caught up in a belief system that is, well, completely unbelievable. Good historical drama enables us to see the deep tensions which pull at our species socially, economically, spiritually, morally and so on, just as it enables us to fathom the symbolic interplay of those tensions, and why, indeed, those symbols may have persisted so long and played such an important role in the forming of institutions which are still intrinsic to what sustains us today.

4196555,5,B003UD7J9E,"This miniseries is fascinating for many reasons, and first of all because it reveals an English historical period that has not been covered by Shakespeare's Histories, the reign of King Stephen, between King Henry I and King Henry II.

This fight between the daughter of Henry I, Matilda in history books, Maud in the film, and the grand son of William the Conqueror and uncle of Matilda who was direct in line, after the accidental death of her elder brother and his wife who should have been king, but she was too young. That's where and when a bishop, Stephen the heiress's uncle and a few barons plot to change the course of history.

This is a story of evil plotting and bloody consequences, a long civil war that caused the death of many innocent people. The series shows all the means they had in those days to kill who they wanted without any risk. Of course the barons and other noble people could kill in a regular fight or battle other people of the same rank and their soldiers. But they could kill simple people rather easily and without any risk of ending in court, except if that ending was useful to some other barons or church dignitary. That plotting is marvelously shown in the series.

The historical compromise Matilda and Stephen reached in the end is clearly stated but maybe not emphasized enough as an event that will justify all kinds of abuse of power by Henry II, son of Matilda who succeeds Stephen after his death since this Stephen does not have a heir, his son having been killed in battle. This compromise first established the possibility to get on the throne via a female blood line which is typical of the English monarchy in those days and second re-establishes the direct filiation to William the Conqueror, Stephen being only a lateral and unjustified line.

The next important element in this series is the way monastic life can become a refuge against the vicissitudes of life, a fragile refuge though that can be disrupted in many ways, by a bishop, a cardinal, the king even, some plotting baron or just some killing baron who takes pleasure in destroying the peace of a religious community. Most of the time these barons need the support, declared or kept secret, of a higher ranking ecclesiastical authority. Sorcery was a good way to disrupt the peace of any community and get rid in the most horrible and barbarous way of some people who could cause a problem to those in power, legitimate or not. Here again the series gives us quite a few episodes of that type.

The next question of interest was the real struggle around fairs and markets that brought a good income to the hosting community but was based on guaranteed security all over Europe. That's a good subject, dealt with frankly and directly and showing how that security was very fragile in a way when you had civil strife around. Most of these fairs and markets came from a privilege granted by the king. Here the series is a little bit deficient because the peace of these European markets was seriously guaranteed, the merchants protected, their goods and money protected too. It is always possible to imagine a raid against such a fair or market but that sounds a little bit extreme. These fairs and markets were protected by European regulations. But that's a good story.

The last and best story is that about the building of a cathedral in the nascent gothic style and the difficulties it encounters as the nave and vault go always higher and need reinforcement against the wind. The series actually centered on a master builder, in fact two generations of master builders and how they were functioning at the time. The intertwining of this aspect with the other levels of the story makes the building of the cathedral a real adventure in itself and the invention of the flying buttresses to prevent the crumbling of the vault under the pressure of the wind becomes a real stake of the whole plot.

A series that is worth watching maybe over and over again just for pleasure and then as an opening vestibule to more research about Henry I, Henry II, Stephen of course, and that should lead us to Thomas Becket under Henry I and the Magna Carta slightly later that was prepared by such constant plotting that was disrespectful of the famous Peace of God that was instated in the eleventh century after a vast and deep popular movement supported and headed by the church itself and several bishops or archbishops. England was slow to get these things and that made the Magna Carta possible, the first document ever in our world in which some categories of people are granted some fundamental rights (orphans and widows mostly) though that is going against feudalism since the divine authority of the king was questioned by barons and church dignitaries.

4196556,4,B003UD7J9E,"As a rule, it's nearly always impossible to perfectly transfer a book to a movie/miniseries/series without some compromises along the way, and from a very pedantic point of view, the 8 episode series version of Ken Follett's The Pillars Of The Earth is no exception.

Having said that, the adaptation is nonetheless rather good, and while not perfectly following the book, it does follow the original story rather closely.

One must bear in mind that the author had a consultative role in the production of the series, and therefore we must assume that he approved of what took place.

The history was all great stuff, and it's terrific to be able to settle into a long story of many characters over time. My main problems are twofold.

It was too rushed to really settle in. Things happened too fast, with big jumps in time that made some character interactions and changes seem too convenient. After the first episode, I wanted the whole thing to have been another twenty minutes longer. Same amount of story, just more time with the characters and developing the world and plot. Each episode after that I felt the same way.

Also, I do think the evil characters were too unrelentingly evil. They each had one note, with occasional fears about damnation, but never enough to stop them from doing the next horrible act. It did feel like a soap opera at times, where the filmmakers want to make all the characters so obviously good or bad so that viewers don't get confused.

BUT  As a miniseries this is a very good one and it's cast does a great job evne if some of them are hungarian? or such.  Who cares the english they spoketh then would sound strange to us anyways. Although the lords and ladies were mainly speaking french first too. I have always thought that this period of history is rather neglected at least until the cadfael series and now this one.  King stephen's reign was  a hard period for england and queen maude isn't even really reconized as a soveriegn by some historians which is a mistake, rival queen? even though in fact steven did hold he throne till his death.
and henry two did succeed him. The story here is a good one which follows the period of gothic revivalism in architecture  that swept away the romanesque style of buildings , at least in most of europe. This scene is reflected in the trivails of the characters as they try to build their cathedral. The evil lord character would be familiar to the people of the time. steven would have to fight rogue lords and queen maude throughout his reign and he next few hundred years would seem wonderful in comparison at least until the black death era.

4196576,2,B003UD7J9E,"Unlike many on this board, I really did not enjoy this miniseries of ""Pillars of the Earth"".  I found the presentation to be over wrought with gratuitous violence (much chopping off of heads with much yelling from the individual doing the chopping, throat slitting--again with much yelling from the individual that did the slitting, and generally loads of  maiming of folks) and loads of violent sex acts.  Further having not read the book, I found the story rather hard to follow--with characters seeming to come and go illogically.

The acting by all at times, to me, was laughable.  I've admired Rufus Sewell and Mathew Mcfadyen in other presentations (e.g., ""A man of no importance"" ""The way we live now); however, in ""Pillars"" I found Sewell as Tom to be just too good and noble boarding on the sappy and Mcfadyen as Prior Phillip so holy and good that his performance, to me, boardered on the sappy plus he seemed unable to decide if the Prior  (his character) had an accent or not--his accent, of some sort, varied from scene to scene.  The very evil and self-flagellating Bishop Waleran as performed by Ian McShane was, to me, just too melodramatically evil--my god, he's nasty.

4196579,5,B003UD7J9E,"Rare film. I am surprised that so many reviewers here liked it. The accents make it hard to follow at times and several times I had to go back or switch to subtitles, but so what.

It is clearly fiction and not historically accurate, but it is historically BELIEVABLE. The dirty politics of the medieval Church and the conspiracies between the nobility and clergy, the exploitation of simple believing people, even murder and so on, faking of miracles all did happen and quite notoriously. This is well done here and the opposition between honest faith and twisted, rationalized ambition is well done.

Also, it is accurate that cathedrals were built commonly to draw worshipers and traders and increase local commerce and income. We do not often see that in film. The life of masons and architects wandering around looking for work is accurate and the challenges that they faced are true.

The acting is quite good and the photography is well done and engaging.

I did not read the book and had no expectations. But I do understand critics who fall in love with a book and then feel violated when a film departs from their memory of the book. I get trapped into this myself sometimes and have only made a little progress over the years in trying to see such a film with fresh eyes. So I can't be too hard on them. But if you have read the book and love it, obviously consider that this could diminish your appreciation for this film.

4196580,4,B003UD7J9E,"I read the ""The Pillars of the Earth"" a few years ago and - as many other thousands of readers - I was pleased that they made a movie out of it. It was an opportunity to match the 12th century England that we built in our minds with the one provided by the movie (and probably certified by Follett himself).

The 1000 pages book is not above reproach. The first third is really, really good. I don't think that I ever read such good storytelling. The second act is still very good, but it was more traditionally developed (was it just impossible to keep the narrative of the first part?). On the last part, things start to flat and only at times it came close to the mastery of the first act.

Nevertheless, Ken Follett even on his weakest moments is an amazing storyteller. I really cannot thing of anyone better on that regards.

We cannot fall in the trap that a book is better than the movie. It is always is. That's clich. We cannot expect that a movie to be a perfect recreation of the book. It is never like that. There were rare cases in the film history that a director gave such a vision to the book that the movie became a work of art in its own way. Kubrick is a common example.

It is not the case of this miniseries. And whoever has such an expectation shouldn't bother to watch these DVDs. My first and only reason to watch this miniseries was the plain old curiosity. I had some expectations to watch a well made production, that's true, but I was basically moved by curiosity. I was pretty sure that the miniseries would be technically well-made, respectful to those that read the book.

I was not disappointed. The production design, sets, costumes, sound, editing, photography and all other technical aspects were made according to today's Hollywood standards. The big surprise for me was the cast. What a great cast they pulled together! The main force behind is Ian McShane. I don't remember the book to be such centered around Waleran, but the miniseries is. Ian McShane has such a shinning presence that everything else moves around him. This is a performance that would be hard to forget. I cannot miss the opportunity to mention Hayley Atwell. I am still seduced by her.

""The Pillars of the Earth"" has many moving parts and an adaptation had the risk to expose some holes. They indeed made a few changes, but the cast was so competent that I only noticed the flaws after watching the whole miniseries and, even so, after thinking hard on that (in the process, I discovered some flaws in the book too). The end of the book and miniseries is where the difference is the greatest. But then, there was no risk for the miniseries to fall apart because it was the end and there was nothing else to be said. The miniseries is more cynical, which may represent Follett's more recent wave of cynicism.

Maybe if Pasolini had directed this, it would be another work of art. I am giving 4 stars basically because of the cast, to the production and to the fact that I didn't expect to be disappointed and I wasn't.",1300320000,2,3028,4.464737793851718

4196584,5,B003UD7J9E,"7 hrs is NOT enough. An elaborate cast, set, costuming, script adaptation of Ken Follet's classic novel. Historical content, leading one to believe a British monk & mason invented Gothic church architecture, including the winged `flying' buttress. The truth is acknowledged near the end, but not before getting the viewer totally enthralled in this action/adventure/romantic epic drama. Builders, monks and royalty of the middle Ages between the years 1120 and 1170, shot on a Budapest location.

The awesome cast has been listed elsewhere, as large as the production itself. First class in every way. Truly this should become a recognized Century 21 classic, a modern ""Gone With the Wind."" Impressive in every detail, even having the book's author in a merchant's role, episode 7.

The series is ""NOT RATED"" but beware, if it makes a difference, there is full frontal nudity, violent scenes, sex, & bold language. Blood, decapitation, incest...well, enough warning. I'd still recommend this to today's 12-year-olds and beyond because of the powerful story, dramatic filming, and historical/educational dramatization. You ENTER the Middle Ages immediately after passing through the opening credits. Spellbinding. Mesmerizing. Bewitching. Stellar.
YES, SUBTITLES.

Some helpful genealogy you might want to copy/paste/print:
King Henry I: only son died at sea; Maud (birthed Henry II); nephew Stephen
Tom Builder: wife Agnes; son Alfred; daughter Martha; son Jonathan
Bartholomew: daughter Aliena (birthed Tom); son Richard
Jacques Cherbourg: son Jack via lover Ellen
Percy Hamleigh: wife Regan; son William

Eight episodes each about 53 minutes:
1 ANARCHY- Henry I dies after the king's heir is lost in the sea burning of the royal ship. Nephew Stephen wins throne. Daughter Maud & son have followers. Tom Builder looks for masonry work and crosses paths with Ellen and her son, Jack.

2 MASTER BUILDER- Kingsbridge church burns and there are political deals aplenty. Ellen is accused as witch, & possible holder of a great secret. William gets motherly incest as well as rape added to his achievements. Maud is off to safer France. Tom begins a cathedral.

3 REDEMPTION- Tom and William battle over quarry stone. Richard and Aliena seek mercy from father's hanging, and make a deal, a costly one.

4 BATTLEFIELD- William and a mystery knight battle for the Shiring Earldom. Stephen and Maud have armies that battle too. Philip looses a battle with Waleran's torturers.

5 LEGACY- Gloucester and Stephen both offered for a prisoner exchange. Then Maud and Stephen continue warring. A Kingsbridge festival is terrorized. Jack and Alfred battle over a girl and Tom must sent one packing.

6 WICHCRAFT- Maud's back in France and Stephen reigns on. Richard has a Kingsbridge return. Alfred pops the question, marriage and builder style. A HUGE building tragedy, again. Jack's seeking his French family, and work.

7 NEW BEGINNINGS- Jack studies geometry & stone building near Paris, a new Gothic style. Aliena treks to France too. Kingsbridge recovers and grows, as does the cathedral and Philip gets an offer from Waleran.

8 THE WORK OF ANGELS- 8 passing years and Jack focuses on twin tower conclusion, but the roof begins to crack.  Aliena & Richard yet seek an Earldom. Waleran's yet with ambition, as is young Henry.

A satisfying ending, other than the fact that you have grown to love this series and never want it to end. Sorry for the epic length of this review but ""Pillars of the Earth"" is worth 6 Amazon stars--if I could award that many.",1299110400,52,3546,5.167539267015707
4196585,1,B003UD7J9E,"Three of us watched this mini series together. We had all read the book and we were all disappointed at the significant changes made by Hollywood. One truth, William and Waloren were the two most evil creatures in the story, but Waloren did not die by the end of the story and William was not killed by a mob of angry citizens. The film indicated an incestuous relationship between William and his mother. Yes, she was a villain, but there was no incest in the story and William did not kill her in the story. I think the DVD needed about 8 more hours to better develop the underlying stories that were in the book. There was so much left out.
When I read the book, I was so disgusted with William that I almost quit reading it several times. I hated him with a passion for raping, murdering, stealing, etc. At every opportunity for the author to kill him off, I was disappointed that he always got away. Anyone as evil as that truly deserves to be killed.

4196586,4,B003UD7J9E,"I have to say, this series was amazing!  The acting is top notch (first time I ever thought Eddie Redmayne nailed a part rather than acted like a whinny brat) and the story is undeniably powerful.  If you've already read the novel this miniseries is based on, then you you know how good the story is already.  For those of you who haven't, the basic synopsis, without giving too much away, is this: it's a multi-generational tale about the construction of a magnificent cathedral during one of the worst periods in Medieval English history.  If you like medieval history and/or movies, you owe it to yourself to see this.  However, the greatest let down of this DVD box set is the special features.  There are hardly any on there and what is there is underwhelming.  The behind the scenes feature, at around 15-30 minutes, is great, but there are only two other features dealing with the visual effects and the creation of the series' beautiful main title sequence, both of which are long (even at about 5 minutes in length) and boring.  And that's it.  Nothing else.  Nada.  I definitely would have liked some more  special features, particularly on the process of translating the story from book to screen and on the casting choices, but I feel like the special features were an after thought to the producers.

4196605,5,B003UD7J9E,"One of the advantages held by the TV mini-series over the theatrical movie is that there's so much more time to develop plot and characters. Throw in great settings, props, and costumes, base it on a blockbuster of a book, and you've got a winner. Ken Follett's Pillars of the Earth is chock full of good guys and villains, and within just a few chapters, the reader definitely knows the difference. And so it is in this mini-series, which has captured the essence of this epic story, a rare enough occurrence to make this production remarkable. Rufus Sewell kicks things off in the role of Tom Builder, who lands a much needed job as master builder at Kingsbridge. Years later, Jack Jackson (portrayed by Eddie Redmayne), son of the local ""witch"" (Natalia Woerner), takes over the project, which is overseen by prior at the monastery, Philip (Matthew Macfadyen). The Earl of Shireton has been deposed, and his daughter Aliana (Hayley Atwell) is determined to recover the title and estate for her younger brother; she manages to set up business as a wool dealer, to support their efforts. All of the above of are thwarted time and again by a powerful team of adversaries. Ian McShane is spot on as the corrupt bishop who brings all his machinations to bear in order to prevent the 12th century village of Kingsbridge from financing and building a great cathedral. Among his equally evil cohorts are William Hamleigh (David Oakes), the usurper of the local earldom, his conniving mother Regan (Sarah Parish), the usurper of the English throne, King Stephen (Tony Curran), and the brooding, resentful Alfred (Liam Garrigan). The entire saga takes place during the tumultuous years when Stephen and Maud were contesting the throne of England.

The actors all brought skill and nuance to their roles. It's not easy to choose a standout, but I felt that Sewell, Redmayne, Atwell, and McShane deserve the honors; that is not to belittle the performances of the others. Shot primarily in Austria and Hungary, the production values are solid, and remarkably, the title sequence is a precis of the entire plot. Considering the drama, the graphic violence, the romance, and the sheer scope of the action, the director evoked some remarkably controlled performances.

My main gripe - and it is a small one - was seemingly being forced to expand on the role played by Donald Sutherland. The Earl of Shiring (his title at the time) was brief in the book but expanded in the mini series to a much greater % of the entire story. They did not actually add much to his role but cut so little of it that his % of the whole was MUCH greater.

I also preferred that Jack start off as the young boy he was but they started him off right away as in his late teens /early 20's which took away his ""adoration"" of Elianna since only a boy could worship a young woman like he did in the book at first.

Again, these are minor criticisms.

They PERFECTLY redid the scene at the Quarry with Prior Philip and his fellow monks.

Bishop Walleran is very well cast as is Prior Philip.

I highy recommend this adaption. Clear some evenings and get ready to be mesmerized.

One need not be a cathedral aficionado to be drawn into the story, but this epic story of the construction of a great gothic cathedral is a rare treat for those who have either studied, or been fascinated by, medieval cathedral construction. The conception, birth, sicknesses, and eventual triumph of the project over many decades of time present a rare glimpse into what one of these massive projects must have been like.

The story is adapted into eight episodes of about one hour each, with ongoing development of the multiple threads of storyline present in the tale. It can get a bit confusing at times: a few of the characters have enough physical semblance to confound the viewer, and the barrage of names can be a bit difficult to manage at first. Nevertheless, the director and scriptwriters have put in enough support lines to help ensure that everyone is ""on track,"" and you can make it straight through and follow the story even if you have not read the book. As the drama of vision, betrayal, perseverance, loyalty, and ambition unfolds, the background of the cathedral project holds the centerpiece of the saga, and anchors the characters throughout the years. It should be noted that the show has some scenes of explicit violence.

Acting in the series is exceptionally good, with Matthew Macfadyen (MI-5) and Ian McShane ""owning"" the scenes with their terrific performances.

An easy recommend for anyone interested in the period or the subject (with the caveat of the violence that may not be appropriate for all audiences), Pillars of the Earth is worthy of title.",1297123200,3,1847,4.932475884244373

In fact several scenes were so close to how I imagined them as I read that I almost thought I'd seen the movie before. Of course I hadn't.
  I like the characters and their development in the movie except for Percy.  He seems a bit weak and almost frail at times. Not quite believable.  That's the only reason for leaving off the 5th star.
  As for the setting and the costumes--they couldn't be better,  The fight scene in the muddy water at the qyarry is a great example.  And the blood from the beheading.  Even the shearing of sheep is true to the times, as are the tools.  Great acting.  Great direction.  It's more than worth the money and time.",1296864000,,804,4.417808219178082

4196629,2,B003UD7J9E,"I hate when I read the obligatory ""the book was better"" regarding all adaptations. However, in this case I am forced to do it myself. I wouldn't mind the departure from the plot in the book if it had made the story better, or at least if it had kept it as entertaining, whether it was different or not; it needed to be shortened at any rate, or it would have been a 300 hour miniseries. The problem is that most of the changes dumb the story and the characters down incredibly. Now there are ludicrous incest plots, poisonings, witchcraft, madness, supernatural visions, torture scenes, self-flagelations and arbitrary fight scenes (some meant to involve Jack more and to give him more protagonism, from earlier), that reduce the whole ensemble to a bunch of cartoon characters. If they couldn't come up with better stuff to make it exciting than what they used, they had plenty to pick from in the book itself (it is a best seller after all, with a rape scene every 50 pages or so, really evil bad guys and plenty of carnage to go around).

Another thing that hurts the series is how they try to pack too much plot. The first episode feels like a trailer, spending a few seconds on each scene and jumping all over the place trying to keep up with everybody, and ultimately failing to bring us close to anyone. It's a shame, because the series is quite well cast (I love McShane; when I read the book before watching the series I imagined Waleran's lines in his voice already), and it does have great production value (which is perhaps the greatest challenge in making a story of this scope within a budget; we are to thank computer imagery and Eastern Europe set building costs, I guess). I just wish they had cut the original story down more (the book repeats ten times in a row an identical cycle of threat-threat averted-new threat, by the same characters, almost in the same manner, over and over: would have been easy to pick just some of those), but that they would have taken the time to let us know the characters more intimately. Also, that they had used the book for guidance as how to keep their characters somewhat real and consistent; Follet has a far superior talent for that than the series writer. Some times, making things more over the top doesn't make them more impactful; they are impactful when they feel real, they aren't when they turn cartoony and silly. It's also ironic that the book would be more cinematic than the series; the suspense is more suspenseful, the melodrama much more tear-jerking... and I keep thinking that it's because of the pace; because of how in the series they rush through everything at trailer-speed. It feels like watching the ten second summary of last week's episode... except that it carries on at that pace through the whole episode! You need suspense time if you want to raise suspense! Also, there are things essential to understand what the characters do, such as the terror of starvation, that they don't even try to dramatize in the series because it would take too long (it feels).

The Scott brothers (who executive produce the series) are great craftsmen, both (Ridley has made masterpieces), but their movies are only as good as the original material; they are not writers and they can't elevate a script. In this series, there was material with great potential, but the potential in the book was lost along the process, and on the other hand, the brothers weren't directing themselves, so the series is not beneficiary of their craft, either. In a way, we get the worst of both worlds.

If you love period epics I guess it's still worth watching, in the absence of much else out there. But if you haven't seen, for example, Rome, I would recommend that a hundred times better (on account of compelling characters, skillful writing, artful movie-making... and with the same or more sex and violence, for those who just care about that). I also encourage everyone to give the Pillars of The Earth a shot as a book, even if you already saw the series. It's not high literature, it's a really entertaining best seller, a page turner, with compelling characters, and, for the lovers of the period, it is not a scholarly work, but it is fairly well researched and offers a fun trip through another era.",1296691200,20,4263,4.643708609271523

4196641,1,B003UD7J9E,"I know this flick is not rated, but still ... My husband and I were looking for a movie at the local rental place and saw this.  There wasn't any information on the box since it was just disc one of the set.  We thought we'd give it a try and we're sorry we did.
First episode was fine.  A little violent but nothing to complain about.
The second episode was a different story.  All of a sudden you're bombarded by profanity, and I mean STRONG profanity (we're talking words that aren't allowed in R rated movies!).  Not to mention a few scenes that were a little too graphic for us.
So, I don't know much about the book and I didn't know anything about the series, but if you are looking for a story that doesn't make you cringe or reach for the fast-forward button, I would look elsewhere.

4196643,4,B003UD7J9E,"I'm now 16 or 17 years removed from the novel, so a great deal of the plot had muddied over the passage of time and age. But this series brought it all back with a sparkling clarity I wouldn't have expected.

The faithfulness in keeping with the book was impressive given the scope of Follett's vision. Obviously changes had to made, both to accommodate the format and budget - but the filmmakers really captured the heart of what I would've considered an un-filmable project.

What I find both interesting and enjoyable is that this isn't rated - and I'm going to guess that when it's finally aired outside of the pay channels - that the extremely brief nude and sexual situations, including incest, will be edited out. And editing, regardless of intent, will almost invariably degrade the finished product - so I would definitely recommend purchasing or renting this thru some venue.

I'm not a huge fan of recent films that take place during the Middle Ages, since most filmmakers take ridiculous liberties with the rather horrifying and squalid world most average citizens like you and I dwelled in. The drab grayness, unpaved streets filled with feces and urine, unchecked facial and body acne, putrid mouth and body odor, and virtual non-existent medical care are all happily overlooked in favor of bright colors, flowers, and the moronic blind idealism found in Renaissance Fairs the world over. Sorry, ""Faires"". <rolling eyeballs>

But once in a while, if some care is taken and a semblance toward historical accuracy is made, I'll explore the world of the 11th-15th Centuries. And like '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Name-of-the-Rose/dp/B004YCKJ74/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Name of the Rose</a>' with Sean Connery - this series is a definite reward for those willing to overlook inaccuracy to be told a good story.

This should really be considered a companion piece rather than a stand-alone product. To get the most from the film experience, I highly recommend reading Ken Follet's source novel.

Finally, I would like to address the Amazon Tag of ""Anti-Catholic' or the Anti-Christian perspective. This is clearly a point of view that is, sadly today, all too common an acceptable stab in the entertainment field. And more importantly, completely ignores the virtuous Brother Phillip, both in the novel and film, a man who is not motivated by personal glory, greed or any of the deviousness of the other characters; a man who is carrying on the honest and pious work of Christianity.",1296345600,,2544,5.192682926829268

But since this series probably wasn't made with anything more in mind than providing the viewer with entertainment, I wasn't at all disappointed with any perceived historical flaws or inaccuracies with the transition from book to film.  I very much enjoyed this series and found it very entertaining.  Perfectly mindless entertainment for later in the evening when I didn't want to think about anything and certainly wasn't looking for any intellectual challenges.  (I say all that because I had to laugh at the guy who gave it two stars, complaining that it wasn't historically accurate and was too superficial.  Seriously??  That's right up my alley!)  It has a good mix of every element of life one might imagine would be present in medieval England - monarchies, good and evil, power struggles, corruption, love, lust, violence and death by the sword, and religious fanatacism (i.e., crazy and power hungry Catholic priests).

If you read Follet's book you may be very disappointed by the film which was a mockery of the novel. I realize that filmakers tend to embellish for dramatic impact but it was not necessary to do so with this story.
The novel was so rich and dramatic that it needed no help at all. Staying true in every detail would have taken months of episodes but staying true to the story need not have been a stumbling block.
As a matter of fact, the film inserted several dramatic scenes which never appeared in the book, wasted time which could have been devoted to the real story and was so fantastical that it was laughable. I will not watch the last disc as it is a waste of time.
I am sorry that Follet praised the movie script, maybe,he saw it as a new story and based his opinion on that alone, because it did not do justice to his beautiful novel.",1295222400,22,971,4.225806451612903

The story was good, and the plotting solid...it just didn't grab me at all.

However, had to wait for the library to get copies of the DVD, and then had to wait some more because this one is popular; e.g. #48 on the list of reserves.  Finally, I got it and could not watch just one episode had to go immediately into part 2 and then part 3.  It was a work night so I put off the rest until a later time.  Okay, now to the series itself.  Firstly, listing my favorite characters and the actors ability in the role, Ellen (brilliant- just as I imagined), Jack (great -as I imagined too), Aliena (good), Prior Phillip (not as I had imagined, and lacked character development on film compared to the book).  Secondly, characters I despised, but were nonetheless crucial to the story line; Bishop Waleran (seemingly worse on film, kudos to the actor, whom I believe is Ian), Lady Hamleigh (double ugh..OMG! this is a despicable character and the actress owned the part, Lady H actually gave me the creeps on and off the pages), William Hameleigh (Lady's son and lover -was that in the book?  Honestly, I did not remember the incest part.  What a jerk!), Alfred (I wanted him to be good since he was Tom Builder's son.  He has some redeeming qualities, but not enough -the actor played him well).  Finally, as mentioned many times before there could be no way that every detail from the book could be adapted to the screen, and in saying that I would encourage a read of the book before seeing the film.  Otherwise, I think too many blank spaces, that could only be completed if one reads the book first, would make the film too difficult to follow, albeit not impossible.

The plotline holds up will and the characters are true to the book.  The choice of actors is excellent, especially Ian McShane as Bishop Waleran.  Mc Shane, who often played comedic roles on British television, shows once again he's plays a great bad guy. Some have criticized Follett's treatment of the Catholic Church in Pillars and its follow-up novel but my read of history shows that it's quite accurate.

Did Sony execs order editors to chop out some great footage, or are they just too busy rakin' in gullible consumers' cash to care?
If Sony advertises that it's an 8 hour series, that's what should be on the discs. Nuff said!

As for the production itself - great sets, props, sound and costuming do make this series a delight.
Do take the effort to read the book first - it's well worth it.
Although the series is well done, viewers have to acknowledge that it's impossible for a screenplay that crunches a 1000 page novel into 8 hours (in this Sony print, make that 7 hours) to convey all the detail and events that are in the book.
Given that, the series does hit most of the main points, changing the plot in places for cinematic purposes but managing to give viewers a real sense of ""time-and-place"".

4196730,3,B003UD7J9E,"In the 12th Century, the English throne is being contested by two claimants. Queen Maud, the eldest child and daughter of the late king and named as his successor, and King Stephen, the king's nephew who has the backing of the Church and much of the nobility. As the civil war known as the Anarchy rages, other noble families take advantage of the chaos to their own ends, as the Hamleighs seize control of Shiring Castle after denouncing its lord to Stephen as a traitor. The lord's heirs, Aliena and Richard, vow to regain their birthright.

Meanwhile, Tom Builder, a stonemason left jobless by the war, joins forces with the ambitious Prior Philip of Kingsbridge to erect a massive cathedral, in doing so making an enemy of Bishop Waleran, whose ambitions will not allow the edifice to be constructed...

Pillars of the Earth is an eight-part TV miniseries, based on Ken Follett's novel of the same name. At its heart it chronicles the building of a cathedral in the (fictitious) village of Kingsbridge against both religious and secular opposition, around which swirls a number of real and fictional historical events relating to a bloody civil war and dynastic struggles for power. It has a notable cast featuring established actors such as Donald Sutherland, Rufus Sewell, Ian McShane, Matthew Macfadyn, Robert Bathurst and Sarah Parish, and relative newcomers like Hayley Atwell and Eddie Redmayne (who, if he was a few years younger, would have made a great Rand al'Thor if the Wheel of Time movie had ever gotten off the ground). It also has a reasonable budget (coming in at $5 million per episode) and excellent production values, with some great CGI and some nice Eastern European location shooting (albeit the fact that none of the locations look remotely like their actual English counterparts, but what the heck).

Is the series a success? Yes and no. If you've read the book you'll know what you are in for: lots of cheesy melodrama, a lack of historical accuracy, a dearth of character depth and some truly inane dialogue. At the same time, there's something fundamentally likable about this derivative story and its corny characters. The actors give enthusiastic performances (though Ian McShane is clearly lamenting the lack of the more nuanced scripts he had to work with on Deadwood and in some scenes is on autopilot) and, most importantly, the scriptwriter has squeezed the thousand-page story into eight episodes, which keeps it rocketing along like a greyhound on crack. Spinning it out to ten or twelve episodes would have resulted in longueurs packed with filler which the book suffers from in some sections. As it stands, the television adaptation doesn't really stand still long enough for the viewer to fully process its flaws (although there'll still be audible groans when William Hamleigh turns up to burn down Kingsbridge for what feels like the fortieth time).

Those flaws are legion but don't really seem to detract from the watchability of the series (although this may also be attributable to how terrible almost everything else is on TV these days). This is tosh of the highest order, then, but highly watchable tosh which does not require much exercising of the old grey matter.

I have not read the book, but my wife tells me she liked it a lot, and apparently so did many others. I am not much into `historical' novels, so I am not likely to close this special gap in my education. I watched this TV miniseries with her, as she was keen on it. I felt entertained for a while, but then more and more let down by a kind of imbalance in the pace of the screen narration. The story rushes through the years and decades, but the protagonists seem to stay the same. Aging does not seem to have much impact on people in England in the 12th century.

The TV production is a multicultural thing. Somehow the Scott brothers are behind it. Apart from that it is a Canadian/ German cooperation with plenty of international labor: a cast from the UK, Canada, and Germany and wherever else. Many Hungarians involved on the production side, plus many other SE Europeans.

The subject of the epic is a cathedral that is built under tumultuous conditions and with shaky construction know how in a central English priory. Historical background is a succession war after a legitimate crown prince is murdered by ambitious courtiers and clergy who have made a pact with a usurper. This period is known as the 'Anarchy' and was in fact a civil war between followers of rival pretenders. After Henry I has died, his daughter Maud assumes the throne to keep it in the direct line for her baby son, who will become Henry II, about 2 decades later. In the meantime her cousin Stephen pushes her out and gets pushed out himself, with some Macbethian hocuspocus.

Apart from the succession dispute there is much building dispute. We follow its progress or stagnation over decades. Some knowhow gets stolen in France. The final cathedral is remarkably different from the initial church structure, which makes me grumble a bit about the visuals of the long thing. Have they forgotten at the end what the building looked like in the beginning? All in all there is quite a lot of sloppiness in the cinematography here.

A third running theme is church intrigue. McShane is the bad priest/bishop/cardinal, who nearly makes it to Archbishop of Canterbury. McFadyen is the good, efficient, intellectual, honest prior who makes promotion and gets demoted and repromoted.

The film mixes plenty of stark images of a sexual & violent nature into the story. Sometimes one wonders if there is a good reason for it other than selling considerations.
The film seems to have been an international success, so it must have worked, but I find it often rather cheap in its imagery and also in its language, which is often opportunistically and anachronistically contemporary.
But then, quality is not something that is decided by vote. I would say, this oeuvre is of negligible value in most respects.",1288569600,13,2887,4.754491017964072

Well, when I heard that there was to be a mini-series based on the book, I was predictably excited. The show may not be a faithful rendition of the novel (after all the book itself was epic in terms of number of pages and story arcs) but it does a suitably credible job of condensing the novel into 8 hours of film.

The story is set in medieval England, circa 12th century, and it revolves around the building of a cathedral in the fictional town of Kingsbridge, England. There are many themes in this story - church politics and corruption; greed and power revolving around the fight over the throne of England; family, friendship, and passion, amongst others. Some of the central characters (and some shortlived-characters) are Tom Builder (played almost to perfection by Rufus Sewell); Prior Phillip (Matthew McFadyen who also played Mr. Darcy in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pride-Prejudice/dp/B000E1ZBGS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pride & Prejudice</a>&nbsp;opposite Keira Knightley; the morally bankrupt church official Father Waleran Bigod (Ian McShane delivering a truly repulsive performance); Earl of Shiring, Bartholomew (Donald Sutherland); the earl's daughter Aliena (Hayley Atweel); fatherless Jack Jackson (a brilliant Eddie Redmayne), and many more. Despite having many familiar and high-profile actors in this show, the actors do a credible job of infusing their roles with the specific characteristics of a particular character (so that for example, I'm not imagining McFadyen as Darcy, in fact far from it - he totally inhabits his role as the devout and unwavering Prior Phillip).

The cinematography is excellent, and there are also loads of sexy scenes in this production (nudity abounds). At times, I did feel that the director and producers got carried away with all the sex scenes, but in the final analysis, these scenes did enhance the storyline and added the requisite sexy factor to increase the production's appeal (?) yet the story is well-told and could have survived on that merit alone. Fans of well-made historical dramas will find lots to love in this production.",1287014400,15,2514,5.961218836565097

""Pillars"" didn't quite live up to my expectations, but I didn't feel like I wanted that 8 hours of my life back afterward, either.  The action scenes were entertaining, and I don't mind a little T&A, but the the characters were too one dimentional and the script seemed contrived at times.

The attention to detail and casting were spot on.  If you already read the book you will love it...it is like visiting with an old friend after years apart.

From someone who did not read the book, I am sure it deviated from the book a tiny bit- but so what- it happens. Still a fabulous work well done.

Without giving too much away Pillars of the Earth is about religion, royalty, manipulation, lies, death, and fraud. The cinematology was beautiful- the score absolutely worth buying, and something completely unexpected from Starz. I did not care for Spartcus- Pillars of the Earth was completely different- no dramatic CGI and blood spurting all over the place. But definitely not a clean movie. Woven in a good script, great landscapes, and outstanding actors & actresses. You have to keep watching.

Expect to be pulled into the series. Expect the unexpected. What you think will happen- DOESN'T. And what does happen is shocking and breathtaking! So genunine and worthy. And when it ends- you are COMPLETE. I have NEVER said that about any series. Believe me, when you're finished watching the whole series-you will be satisifed.

I susccribed to STARZ on my cable just so I could see it.

I have watched all of the episodes and once completed I wanted it to be released on DVD immediately so I could watch it again and to share it with friends who also have loved the book.

The final two hour episode this past Friday Aug 27 was superb beyond words
and the final scene summed it all up of what a wodnerful story this was and will be for a long time.

If a Season 2 follows to the sequel ""A World without End"" then I will ready to watch it because if it anywhere near as good as the job done here then it will be something to look forward to very much",1283212800,6,830,3.8875739644970415
4196775,2,B003UD7J9E,"I just finished watching the series after finishing the book the day prior to starting the episodes, so the book was very fresh in my memory.  I must admit that I kept watching and loved the actors that were cast in each role, but it deviated from the novel so much that it ended up being a disappointment.  Certainly, most will enjoy the plot if they haven't read the book, but if you have, then be prepared for some serious changes in the storyline, the characters (including changing who the true villain was) and their behavior.  Very strange that the series would take such enormous leaps with William's mother, Waleren and King Stephen and also completely change the ending which tied in with the history of the times.  Such a shame since, in the novel, there were so many stories of redemption and forgiveness which, I believe, countered all the corruption within the church.
I feel like it was dumbed down, which frustrates me.  Viewers are much more savvy these days, so why take such liberties?  I can only guess that it was easier to turn everyone into incestuous murderers for the sake of ratings. Ken Follet was in one of the scenes, so I guess he put his stamp of approval on it.

4196776,3,B003UD7J9E,"When I was trying to think of a clever title for this review, ""Watching the Paint Dry on Freshly Built Cathedrals"" came to mind as did ""Watching Pillars of Grass Grow From the Earth"". But those titles would reflect a bit more boredom than I actually experienced with Pillars of the Earth (and my titles just weren't really very clever). So instead of expressing my frustration with this miniseries in the title of my review, I'll just say it.

I actually thought that Pillars of the Earth started off quite well. The story seemed to be progressing towards a climactic, epic finish. After the fifth episode I was sure that something big was coming. The sixth episode had me convinced that I was in for a great finale. But what a let down the final double episode was. I don't know...the story just didn't go out with a bang for me. The double episode seemed to try to cram another 6 hours of material and history into what ultimately was just a two-hour time slot. For example, while the first 6 episodes cover a time span of several years, I think that the story jumps almost 20 years from the start of the 2-hour finale to the end. But worst of all it just seemed to end with a fizzle; no climactic, epic finish here.

I do think that the acting was quite good. The cast sold me on coming back for more to see how all of their roles played out in the building of cathedrals during the middle of the twelfth century in the fictional town of Kingsbridge, England. It was interesting and I was entertained.

I rarely watch television, but this was worth every viewing minute!  If you loved the book, you MUST see this film adaptation.  If you haven't, do yourself a favor and read the book first and then watch the dvd's.  If you love historical fiction, this is a must read.  One might wonder that the building of a cathedral could be the center of an exciting storyline, but it's possible and this book continues to be among my top three favorites.

Many adaptations have questionable casting and significant departure from storyline.  This mini-series is not one of them. The casting is incredible. Every character is portrayed exactly as I pictured while reading the book.  I can't imagine a better cast.

Thankfully, the series has also stayed true to the story; I'm so glad Follett was involved! Of course the entire book can't be covered in such depth, but the series hits all the of the important points. Having read the book I feel like I understand the story well and the motivation behind each character, which leads me to recommend reading the book first, but as my spouse (who did not read the book) can attest, the series stands well on its own.",1282348800,14,851,4.5855263157894735

4196782,3,B003UD7J9E,"The TV mini-series treatment of what I consider to be a modern classic, Pillars of the Earth, is a high-quality production with excellent acting, incredible set design, etc.  The special effects treatment of people spewing blood after being cut by swords is poor, even cartoonish, but that is not my reason for a 3-star rating.

While any movie or TV rendition will always fall short of a book, this screenplay takes so many liberties with the characters and storyline of the book that it ceases to be the same story.  I don't think one can read Follett's book before seeing this series, as I have, and fully appreciate the televised story as much. I also doubt whether one could read the book after watching the series without being confused that it is the same story.

I suppose the only solution (to thoroughly enjoy this series, anyway) is to allow much, much time to lapse between the reading of the book and the watching of the series, regardless of which comes first.  By the time they get around to releasing the entire series, enough time may very well have passed!

This one thing I can recommend - read the book. Read this great book, even if you skip the television series.",1282176000,5,1185,4.619047619047619
4196783,5,B003UD7J9E,"First off, as other posters have said, read the Book! You will like yourself better in the morning for doing so.
That being said, having seen the five episodes of this that have aired so far, there is a vast difference between the movie and the book. The movie, in my opinion still holds to the essence of the novel that Follett wrote. He did approve all the changes between the book and the movie-there's an interview with him online about it. So the changes that were made between the book and the novel were not a surprise to him, and he even gets cast in a small role.

There were slight casting liberties taken, and you'll see the character differences between the movie and the book. Even so, the characters in the movie are very well portrayed and very much like they are imagined.
I read the novel for a History class in 2004 maybe? I sent a message to the professor of the class as soon as I saw this was going to be airing. The majority of her students that read this book fall in love with it, so to be able to see it brought to life is very exciting.

I gave it 5 stars because Ken Follett does a great job keeping the reader captivated, and wanting to turn the next page. The movie producers here have done equally well with his vision keeping the audience clamoring for more after each episode.",1282089600,4,1308,4.291497975708502

Obviously, nearly any book that's being converted to television/movie must be abbreviated or adapted in some way; Ken Follett's original work contained a lot of internal monologue that would have been difficult to translate to screen. The show's strengths are it's epic scale, incredible level of production (sets/costumes/etc.), and PERFECT cast. I honestly can't imagine anyone else as Prior Phillip, Jack, Aliena (although she took an episode to grow on me), Waleran Bigod, Remigius, or almost any other character. So, in summary:

PROS:
- Perfect cast
- Amazing production design, locations/sets, costumes, etc.
- Epic scale

CONS:
-Plot differs from the book as the series goes on

My recommendation: enjoy the show for it's strengths, but do yourself a favor and READ THE BOOK. You will fall in love with this story and these characters!",1281052800,169,970,4.9753086419753085
4196786,5,B003UD7J9E,"PILLARS OF THE EARTH is an ambitious cinematic adaptation of Ken Follett's novel by the same name.  This first season is to be eight episodes, with a 'Season 2' already suggested. The overall message of this historical novel can be summarized as follows: this is a story 'about the building of a cathedral in the fictional town of Kingsbridge, England. It is set in the middle of the twelfth century, primarily during the time sometimes called the Anarchy, between the time of the sinking of the White Ship and the murder of Thomas Becket. The story traces the development of Gothic architecture out of the preceding Romanesque architecture and the fortunes of the Kingsbridge priory against the backdrop of actual historical events of the time. Although Kingsbridge is the name of an actual English town, the Kingsbridge in the novel is actually a fictional location representative of a typical market town of the time'.

Shot on location in Hungary with director Sergio Mimica-Gezzan, director of photography Attila Szalay, and set to the fine musical scoring by Trevor Morris, PILLARS OF THE EARTH is off to a fine start in the first three episodes.  While the series is based on historic facts, there are so many sidebars of added information that it is a bit difficult to keep the flow of the story straight.  Prior Philip (Matthew Macfadyen) yearns to build a cathedral in Kingsbridge, much to the chagrin of the evil Waleran (Ian McShane).  Philip's innate kindness and focus of his mission leads him to Tom Builder (Rufus Sewell) whose wife has died in childbirth and the newborn is left by Tom on his mother's grave only to be saved by a quiet monk.  Tom encounters Ellen (Natalia Wrner) and her mute son Jack (Eddie Redmayne) who join forces to not only build Prior Philip's cathedral but fight against the forces of royalty who  would alter life in general for all of them.  The fine cast includes Donald Sutherland (early on beheaded), Hayley Atwell, Allison Pill, Gordon Pinset, David Oakes, Sam Claflin, Skye Bennett and many others.  The costumes and sets are realistic and portray the period well.  There is a lot of the now requisite bloodshed and some rather gory scenes, but those go along with the accurate reenactment of the period.  Definitely worth watching.
