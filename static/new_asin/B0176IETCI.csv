7489633,5,B0176IETCI,"I absolutely love this series to death. I was 11 when it first came out and I loved getting to watch it episode by episode every Saturday night right before I went to bed. I don't think I've ever been as fond of a series as this one. I'm a transformers fan, so to have Peter Cullen narrating this series on the Toonami cut like he did back in the day is like a dream. I've watched the series many times since it aired and always missed the feeling of the Toonami broadcast version and I am so excited to now finally own it for myself.

This honestly feels like a dream come true, I only have one other friend that actually watched it way back when and knows what I'm talking about when I bring this series up in conversation. This show is so unknown to most people that disk 1 of the Toonami cut has an extra version of episode 1 with commentary from one of the producers and he greets you and proceeds to say, ""Thank you, all 3 of you that bought this."" I laughed so hard because it's so true. Because of this I never thought in a million years that it would ever be re-released, ESPECIALLY in this amazing form, with the Production I.G. cut and of course the Toonami cut.  The extras are just amazing that they got packed in this that were made specifically for this set. The commentary episodes are amazing and the interviews with the voice cast are such a nice bonus. There is even actual footage of an IGPX panel at Comic Con. I had no idea that was even a thing.

The old single season collection boxes are just too much money and are, to me at least, actually obsolete at this point. They don't have anything near the quality on screen or the extras this one includes. I love the packaging to this set, the art work, and disks look just wonderful. I can't thank Discotek enough for making this set a reality. I have no idea why it happened but I'm so happy it did.",1456358400,9,1871,4.206128133704736
7489634,5,B0176IETCI,"When I was 11-12, this anime was my jam when I watched it on Toonami. It was one of the coolest shows I've ever seen both with its high octane energy and speed, amazing and likable chatacters, gorgeous animation (courtesy of Production I.G.) and a surprisingly good story despite its premise which might turn away naysayers. This box set may not come in Blu-Ray form, but it is extremely forgivable just for the content contained inside this little and might I mention, beautiful designed box. The box itself is creatively shapped and beautifully put together. It in itself looks like a box set that would belong in the anime's universe, perfectly fitting in every way. As for the content itself, I don't think anyone who grew up with this series like me could be more than appreciative over what they did with this box set. For starters, not only does it come with the original unaltered Production I.G. cut of the anime, complete in both English dub and Japanese, but it also comes with a separate set specifically containing the version many like myself grew up with aptly named ""Toonami cut"", complete with the same intro and outros that they played before and after every episode. Combine that with beautifully remastered footage that looks great even on DVD and you got yourself a great deal fit for both longtime fans of the show and newcomers wanting to discover it. Discotek Media picked up the distribution rights after Bandai entertainment shut their doors and the anime was put on limbo, and I thank them very much for what they did because not only did they bring back an old classic from my childhood, they paved the way for newcomers to watch one of the most underrated anime ever made.",1455321600,11,1701,4.7114093959731544
7489635,5,B0176IETCI,"IGPX has gone on quite a ride to get here. Airing on Toonami back in 2005, it unfortunately wasn't as popular as it should've been. After its airing, it went into a legal ""limbo"" of sorts. Most chalked it up to something that would never see the light of day again, but then a miracle happened. The Toonami Team was able to bring it back and air it on the new Toonami block in 2013. Truly a blessing for us fans who have been dying to see it legally. Then, Discotek Media comes in and does what most thought impossible, actually release the entire series in a complete set!

This a stellar box set to say the least. Let's go down the list:

-All 26 episodes in one package
-BOTH Toonami Broadcast and the original Production I.G. versions
-Loaded to the brim with extras
-The best looking and sounding IGPX has ever been
-Unique and snazzy packaging

IGPX's original releases back in the day were, to put it lightly, confusing. Because there are two different versions of the show, there were two different sets of DVD's released. First released as multiple volumes, then finally as two separate box sets for each season. There weren't many printed either, so trying to complete your collection was a hassle. Or if you wanted to skip trying to collect all the volumes, you'd have to be lucky enough to find the complete seasons, but at hefty prices. Because of that, this box set by Discotek is truly fantastic. Being able to have the complete package of both versions is nothing short of incredible.

What are the differences between the two versions? Because Toonami is an action oriented block and partially owns the rights to the franchise, they cut up some scenes differently, added different dialogue, and inserted those classic Toonami beats we've all come to know and love over the years. Many, such as myself, consider this the superior version. But it is still very nice to have both versions available!

For visuals and audio, this is the best we'll ever see IGPX. Unfortunately, these are not Blu-Rays, they are HD DVDs. So the picture, despite being improved, still does not look all that sharp. Despite that, IGPX's art and animation still stand up today. The production studio, Production I.G., may sound familiar; they're the people behind the anime classic Ghost in the Shell. Their stellar talent continues in IGPX.

The audio sounds really really terrific. Not to mention IGPX has the best soundtrack offered in any anime due to Toonami's partnership with the music label Ninja Tune. Music can vary between cool and soulful beats, to fast and hard hip hop tracks, to powerful orchestral scores.

The voice cast for IGPX is what really stands out. Popular actors like Haley Joel Osment, Michelle Rodriguez, and Mark Hamill take center stage for this star studded cast. And even the voice of Optimus Prime, the legendary Peter Cullen, narrates the entire series! Still not impressed? Anime voice-over heavy weights Steve Blum, Kari Wahlgren, and Crispin Freeman are front and center as well. Talk about a legendary cast!

The story of IGPX is both unique and vastly entertaining. We follow Team Satomi, and up-and-coming underdog team that has teamwork problems, but have the potential to be champions. We follow their story of determination, frustration, and glory as they fight to be the best in the Immortal Grand Prix. Using giant mechs, they fight and race to the finish line in teams of three. The action gets your heart racing and leaves you on the edge of your seat. The characters are varied and deep. Each one has a unique and different background that makes them really stand out. Each one also handles fame differently, so seeing them try and be a team really keeps you invested and interested in them. IGPX does a tremendous job of portraying the life of a pro athlete and their rise to the top, and also shows how fame can change a person. I can't go any further without spoiling though.

In conclusion, this box set is something we IGPX fans still can hardly fathom. Both versions, packed with extras like panels, commentaries, and more, and in the highest quality possible. It is the definitive IGPX collection that we all deserve. I recommend this series to everyone, as I believe IGPX is one of the most underrated anime of all time.

8738160,5,B0176IETCI,Really entertaining show with some great action and phenomenal character development.
