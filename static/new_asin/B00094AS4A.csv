2264082,2,B00094AS4A,"I think this adaptation of Lady Chatterley's Lover is lacking in so many ways. The actors are mediocre at best. Roles like Hilda miscast. Nothing against the actress in this role but she seems old enough to be Connie's mother rather than sister. And I rather wanted to tell the gamekeeper to keep his clothes on. Additionally, there doesn't seem to capture the passion and quiet desperation of the characters. If one wants to see a good film as well as a film that's faithful to the spirit of Lady Chatterley's Lover...This is not it.",1175731200,4,534,4.631578947368421

2264085,5,B00094AS4A,"One of the most important elements of this film is the sense of real life sensibilities it captures.  The qualities of longing and frustration are beautifully captured by Sylvia Crystal as Lady Chatterley, the wife of a dashing but complex husband played by Shane Briant with combinations of bravado and self centeredness beneath a handsome figure who is logged into his class background and behavior patterns allowing little room for natural love and responsiveness.  While Lady Chatterley holds firmly at first to her devotion to her husband she cannot withstand the raw sensuality of Nicholas Clay as the gardner on the estate.  Nicholas Clay likes to show his butt and I am reminded of another film, ""Evil Under The Sun"" where he tittilates the viewer with his rather voluptuous posterior while walking on the beach.  This aside, he more than captures the ""real world"" personality of his class and attitudes juxtaposed with Lord Chatterley's strict upperclass ones.  I felt the ""eye brows"" of Lord Chatterley were a bit ""over stated"" in make up and this had the effect giving him a drama queen demeanor and somehow a little ""campy.""  But all in all I thoroughly enjoyed the film for its showing nudity where nudity seemed perfectly called for without teasing and overly gauzy effects which is sometimes such a bore .  Maybe the film is not what one would call a ""religious experience"" but why should all films be that anyway.  It is beautifully filmed and the production values are first rate and it makes a sometimes complicated story line believable without too much contempt for the viewer, especially with D. H. Lawrence's reputation.  Above all I felt it captured the anguish and fear which contibute to decisions that drastically alter the people that make them.

And I like looking a Nicholas Clay's butt.",1128729600,42,1816,4.944078947368421
2264086,5,B00094AS4A,A previous reviewer liked the movie but not the editing. Obviously he knows a bit more about movies. I think Lady Chatterley's Lover is splendid and does justice to the classic English novel by D.H. Lawrence. The acting is on the mark and passions well conveyed. If you need an erotic movie to entice new love into bed this is a clear ulternative to outright pornography.,1126569600,9,371,4.636363636363637
2264087,3,B00094AS4A,"A mainstay on HBO around 1982-83, ""Lady Chatterly's Lover"" is a soft-core romance, but not a sleazy one. It wasn't successful in theaters, maybe because nobody knew what audience it was targeted to (surely not literature addicts or art-house filmgoers; maybe Sylvia Kristel/""Emmanuelle"" fans). Consequently, it was popular on cable and video, where viewing privacy can elicit whatever reactions necessary (mostly giggles). It isn't very well-made, but the acting is decent and the passion is convincing. The editing is sloppy, with some sequences, and the ending, cut short, but it does have a few steamy scenes, frisky nudity, and good location filming.",1116547200,49,654,5.421568627450981

I think the story line is good and from what I have heard fairly accurate. The only problem I have is that there isn't enough passion between the two main characters. Otherwise it is a movie you can watch again and again for the sheer beauty of the atmosphere and the fashion.

2264154,5,B00094AS4A,"There have been several films made from this classic literary work, which at the time it was first published was banned and and/or severely vilified - and ended up in a court suit in an attempt to censor it.  Of the four versions I have viewed, this is, by far in my opinion the best of the lot.  The film is more graphic and leaves the viewer with a more realistic 'picture' than other Amer. productions which by the nature of American film making/'oversight' seems to make everything 'palatable' to a 'G' rating, or it would appear.  This version, to me, puts the reader 'there on the scene' - not as a voyeur, but rather in a way that makes the players and the scenes 'real' as life really is.  You may not like what it portrays, from your perspective. . .but its emotional and explores the emotions of the protagonists in a way that draws the viewer into their real emotions, lives, fears, frustrations.  Isn't that what a great work/film should do?",1384300800,2,953,4.485549132947977

The movie arrived well before the listed arrival date and I am happy for that, five stars there.

The movie itself is quite a steamy classic and it looks great on blu- ray, beautiful cinematography and so on snarf, snarf...

While Sylvia Kristel is beautiful and does a fine job being the horny housewife with a dead penis at home... Nicholas Clay's soaped up rump is why most of us will never fall for Christian Grey or his ilk. Enjoy the sudsy rump! :D",1368489600,2,598,4.330357142857143
2264178,5,B00094AS4A,"I saw this movie in the theatre back in the early 80's and it made such an impression on me that I never forgot it.  As a very young gay man at the time, I recall the excitement I felt as the scene with Nicolas Clay as the gamekeeper (and the lover) taking a bath outside his cottage unfolded.  Lady Chatterley also watched the scene from the woods and as Nicolas Clay proceeded to bathe himself from a basin in full view of the audience, everyone was treated to EVERY detail of his beautiful body.  He has since passed away from cancer and is sorely missed.  He had a very rare quality--some call it stage presence.  He was mesmerizing when he was onscreen.  Taken from the classic novel, this film is beautifully done and the period costumes and gorgeous locations are not to be missed.

2264232,5,B00094AS4A,"Lady Chatterley's Lover ranks up there as one of the most erotic films about true romantic love ever made. Nicholas Clay as Mellors and the stunning Sylvia Kristel as Connie are perfectly matched in this highly charged love story of a woman, whose bourgeois, aristocratic, whiny, insufferable and sadistic husband becomes paralyzed after serving in WWI (even after that it's still impossible to find sympathy for this stuffy clod who is stupid enough to tell his wife to ""go find a lover"" and subsequently pushes her away emotionally and who is verbally abusive to her as well). Connie winds up finding lust and love with the estate's gamekeeper, played brilliantly by the late Nicholas Clay (tragically, he died of cancer in 2000 at the young age of 53). Clay was arguably one of the most exquisite men to ever grace the silver screen and reveals all to us in this movie (and I am so grateful he does because everything he has is shockingly gorgeous - I rented this movie and after seeing the first scene with him in it I think I cleared the couch in one leap to get to my PC to buy this movie from Amazon). Well-acted with an intense intimacy that most of us will never experience because we are too frightened of it, we are able to feel it all here and drink it in with reckless abandon and without being afraid. Wonderful, lush 1920s period costuming and bucolic English countryside with a Vaughn Williams-esque music score draw you into the story of these lovers, and left me wanting more. From their first spontaneous, lustful encounter (I think my legs actually went numb when I first watched it) to their eventual ""courtship,"" I was engrossed. This story gives me hope that real love between two people, no matter their background or socioeconomic status, does truly exist.

Connie changes because of her interaction with Mellors, and so finds true intimacy with an at first unlikely partner, and the superficial things that once seemed important to her melt away and no longer matter. She discovers who she is through her relationship with him, whereas Mellors already knows who he is. She can truly be herself around Mellors, so it is not surprising that he is a much better match for her than her rich, prissy husband. Mellors is the representation of what I consider to be an example of true masculinity: Clay's remarkable portrayal shows the unbearable pain of falling in love with someone who can only partially commit; he is physically strong and powerful, but shows remorse and disgust after being forced by Connie's husband to beat up poachers he caught on the grounds. He goes from cradling a baby chick in his hands to comforting her to decorating her hair with flowers, to making wild passionate love to her inside the secluded work shed, or in the woods against a tree out of sight from the main house. The searing contrast of Clay and Kristel's fully clothed and writhing bodies on the dirty floor of the work shed as they are overcome with lust and passion for each other will be forever burned in my mind. The only distraction in the film is the dubbing - every piece of dialouge was dubbed, so just be ready for it. It is a certainty that Clay was underrated as an actor, and it would have been nice to see him in more leading roles over the years, but I am grateful that he will be forever immortalized in the great film work he did accomplish, such as in this film, Evil Under The Sun, Lovespell, and Excalibur. I highly recommend them all.",1242864000,12,3467,4.628246753246753

THE OTHERS ACTORS ARE ALSO VERY CONVINCING IN THEIR ROLES, AND THE LUXURIOUS AMBIANCE OF THE LATE HYPOCRITE BELLE-EPOQUE IS EASILY PERCEIVED. I THINK THAT THE REAL MOTIVE OF GREAT SCANDAL CAUSED BY THE BOOK OF LAWRENCE- FROM WHAT THE MOVIE IS BASED-IN HIS DAYS, , WAS THE FACT THAT A LADY, ARISTOCRAT, TAKE A PEASANT AS HER LOVER,  AND NOT BY HAVING A LOVER, VERY COMMON IN ANY SOCIETY.",1229385600,2,533,4.438775510204081
