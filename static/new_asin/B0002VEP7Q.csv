8220458,4,B0002VEP7Q,"I love this Christmas special. I taped"" Aliens First Christmas"" off tv when it first aired and have watched it many times over the years. I was excited to find it on DVD, but was disappointed to find that the theme song is missing. I have long thought that Lois Griffin from ""Family Guy"" looks an awful lot like Mavo the alien (only not green and with out antennas). Great special and okay DVD (would be better if the catchy theme song was included).",1396137600,,450,4.369047619047619
