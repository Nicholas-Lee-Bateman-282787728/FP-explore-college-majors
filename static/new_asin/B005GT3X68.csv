4693772,5,B005GT3X68,"The movie opens in 1974 in our favorite Wrong Turn location: West Virginia. A doctor is giving a new female doctor a tour and introduces the three inbred hillbilly cannibals. They don't feel pain. When they were discovered they were chewing on their parents. Their escape is inevitable (it would be a short film if they stayed locked up). And in classic horror movie form the inmates become the keepers. The battle for the sanitarium is done in style, to the background of classical music (""The Blue Danube""), reminiscent of the violence scenes in ""Clockwork Orange."" They ironically perform electroshock therapy on the woman doctor (Kristen Harris) who wanted to use ""music therapy"" on them. I'm loving it. (Okay ""The Blue Danube"" was in ""2001..."" and not ""Clockwork Orange"", but I think you get the idea.) Terrific blood and gore. Hillbilly cannibals are jumping around and grunting like a Monthy Python Mr. Gumby brain specialist, looking like demented Klingons. And this is all before the opening credits!

After the credits, the movie starts out ala Roger Corman style with a nude scene to set the tone for the picture. There are 4 people having sex and one girl not having sex. According to the unwritten slasher code of horror movies the 4 having sex must die and the lone girl who didn't show us her tatas will survive the upcoming snow mobile adventure. But to make this thing interesting there are 8-9 young adults total. If you have read the story line, you know they lose their way and spend the night at the abandoned sanitarium. The kids get drunk and stoned as they explore the place and read medical records for entertainment. You wait for it...and then it is just a question of who lives or who becomes fondue.

The movie offers ""Troma"" style blood and gore as they remove various body parts. I found it better than the other 3 movies.

F-bomb, sex, nudity (Kaitlyn Wong, Tenika Davis, Terra Vnesa) 5 stars ""B"" movie.",1319241600,4,1934,4.75
4693773,4,B005GT3X68,"This was by far the best , I love Part 2 , but this one surpasses it because of the great lead of characters ! The death scenes are absolutely Sick ! For the most part something that really stook out to me was the embracement of Femenism in this movie. There were ALOT of female supporting roles in this film Tenika Davis (Canada's Next Top Model Cycle 1) was the female lead , however she isn't the one giving orders all the time , it even surprised me how some poorly developed Characters lived longer than others ! Overall This movie's conclusion sort of reminds me of the descent , like i said the power of Femenism in this movie is great. The guys are a**wholes as expected. And the cinematography is Pleasant. Overall 1-10 i give this movie an 8.9. I reccomend buying it , the ending is original & unlike the last 3 ends with an unexpected twist !",1318982400,6,853,4.271604938271605
4693774,5,B005GT3X68,"""Wrong Turn 4: Bloody Beginnings"" is probably one of my most anticipated movies this year. At first, I wasn't expecting much, but the movie ended with my jaw dropped open and in my head, the words ""Best 'Wrong Turn' yet kept repeating. I'll tell you why. By the way, Three Finger's laugh is soo contagious in this movie! :)

One of the factors that made this movie better than the rest of the ""Wrong Turn"" movies, not counting the first one, is that you could actually relate and feel for the characters! You might be left heartbroken for almost half of the deaths. This movie isn't also just filled with dumb teenagers screaming for their lives, running around like monkeys with no heads, these people can actually think and come up with very very clever plans and choices. Of course, we have our skeptic characters, and at most times, if you are in their place, you could agree with the skeptic character, which is Bridget. I think she's Asian. :)
So, let me summarize up some of the character descriptions. I'll try my best! :D

Kenia is, let's say, the smartest and the bravest of the group. She came up with A LOT of clever plans and traps for the three canibals. I think this character will be a fan favorite! :)
Sara is the African-American chick who is always in a lesbian scene with Bridget. I remember it being three scenes. Well, she's one of those type of characters where people don't really care about at first, but she will have a big role at the end. Black people doesn't always die first, you know? :)
Bridget is the Asian girl, who I described as the skeptic character. Her choices and decisions are really relatable, for me, and sometimes I kinda feel bad for her for always being left out from the choices. Her death scene is sort of sad, but the CGI blood TOTALLY ruined it!
Jenna is at first you would think the heroine of the movie. Well, she is, but not the main one. There's almost little to no character development for this chick but her dating Vincent.
Kyle is the tough one of the group. Maybe because he witnessed his love of his life being killed in-front of him and swam on her pool of blood. He is ought to get the cannibals, and he did! ;) Just watch closely at the first part of the film, and you'll know what the flaw of his plan that caused to his ""end"". :D For some reason, or it might just be me, he reminds me of Shane Dawson. :) Big fan of Shane!
Daniel is the nerd of the group. He is the one who finds out things about our three cannibals. Prepare to  cringe on his death scene, because IT IS THE BEST DEATH SCENE OF THE ENTIRE FRANCHISE! 'Nuff said!
Lauren is the skier of the group. Well, Sarah said she is. She has this story that her brother told her that she told the group (that was a little confusing) that a group of cannibals that were once in the sanatorium were freaks and whatnot. Duh, the characters wouldn't believe her. Her death is a heck of a fail to the group, fail to us, and a heartbreaker. It's so so so so so so so sad... :( A tear dropped from my eye and whispered ""At least you are the very first 'Wrong Turn"" character who did it. Rest in peace 'ole buddy.""
Claire has the signature death of the movie. She is Kyle's girlfriend, you should know that! Well, at first, when I saw her name just right now, I was like ""Who in the world is Claire?"" then I remembered her through her amazing death! :)
Vincent is one of my favorites in this movie. He is the curious guy and likes to explore the place. Here and there, he might pull off some pranks, so be sure to wear those headphones and put the volume on max! Vincent is going to make you jump many times!

The second or the final factor are the death scenes! This movie has the most brutal, the goriest, and the most painful deaths of the entire franchise. Here, I took notes while watching the movie. No changes will take place:
First death: Disgusting.
Second: Brutal and merciless.
Third: Very very graphic and cringe-worth. Terrible acting, though.
Fourth: Off screen.
Fifth: Bad graphics. But the nose part was sort of new?
Sixth: The movie's signature death! A good, heart-breaking death scene throughout ruined by a really bad CGi ending! -___-
Seventh: The most painful, merciless, and brutal ""Wrong Turn"" death yet. Liver turned into a shish kebab! YEAH! Get your cringe buttons on! This scene reminds me of ""Hostel"".
Eighth: I don't want this to be spoiled, but let me just say that it is AWESOMELY UNIQUE for a ""Wrong Turn"" movie! :D
Ninth: New for the series.
Tenth: A must've been good death ruined by CGI blood.
Eleventh: THE MOST HEARTBREAKING DEATH IN THE ENTIRE FRANCHISE! Well, for me.
Twelveth and Thirteenth: I was all happy and then boom! -___-

Rating:

Plot: 8/10. Same storyline, but the location really makes a difference!
Characters: 7.5/10. Greatly developed. You could actually relate and feel for the characters.
Deaths: 9.2/10. Great unique death scenes for the franchise, but CGI bloods and bodies ruined the great death scenes though.
Overall: 8/10. Second best ""Wrong Turn"" since the first. This shouldn't really be a direct-to-video. It should have been released in the theaters. DON'T MISS THIS! You are going to have a bloody good time!",1318982400,7,5187,4.472016895459345
4693775,2,B005GT3X68,"""We are not alone here...They are gonna kill us all."" When three ""special"" boys who are brought to an insane asylum escape the reign on terror from the ""Hillbilly Cannibals"" begins. I will start by saying that this was much better then the third one. This movie further supports my argument that Hollywood is out of ideas and is stuck on prequels/sequels, re-makes and comic book movies only. If you don't believe me, ask yourself how long you have been saying...""I wish they made a prequel to 'Wrong Turn', the saga doesn't feel complete."" That's what I thought. This movie is just a lot of screaming, blood and decapitations. Oh yeah, and cannibalism. If you are into that sort of thing this is the movie you have been waiting for. Overall, much better then the third, my favorite was the second...but again I don't think a prequel to this series was needed. I give it a C-.

4693798,5,B005GT3X68,"This is an outstanding, bloody flick; just a great bad movie for horror lovers! It starts in uber-raunchy porn-script mode, but it finds its deliciously gory footing in due time and is well worth the wait.

Director Declan O'Brien (Cyclops, Sharktopus, Wrong Turn 3-5) returns for his second Wrong Turn sequel to reveal the origins of our favorite inbred hillbilly cannibals.  Everything started with Three Finger (Sean Skene; Channel Zero), One Eye (Tristan Carlucci; Channel Zero) and Sawtooth (Scott Johnson), whom we first met in Wrong Turn (2003) but now meet as kids in 1974.  Incarcerated residents of a Greenbriar, West Virginia sanitarium, these boys were born with advanced congenital analgesia, resulting in their inability to feel pain.  I guess that actually makes some sense of their superhuman behavior in these moviesand maybe Michael Myers as well.

Fast-forward to 2003.  Heading out for a winter retreat to a family cabin, nine college students take a wrong turn and snowmobile out of cell reception to the now abandoned mental hospital in the snowy mountains.  Oh, and of course, a blizzard abounds to maroon them in flesh-eating Deliverance.

Right off the bat, we know this is a bad movie for sure.  It might turn out to be a lot of fun, but its bad.  Meet our co-eds: Kenia (Jennifer Pudavick; Faces in the Crowd, Wishmaster 3-4), Sara (Tenika Davis; Saw VI), Bridget (Kaitlyn Leeb; Total Recall, Wolves, Bitten), Jenna (Terra Vnesa; 5ive Girls, Goosebumps), Lauren (Ali Tataryn; Curse of Chucky, Silent Night), Claire (Samantha Kendrick; The Exorcism of Molly Hartley), Kyle (Victor Zinck, Jr.; Grave Encounters 2), Vincent (Sean Skene; Channel Zero) and Daniel (Dean Armstrong; Heroes Reborn, Saw 3D, Joy Ride 3).  Of, course, they're all good-looking like they were plucked from a J Crew catalogue. As we get to know them, their dialogue is atrocious.  These twenty-somethings talk like they're reading porn screenplaysand even act like it.  Theres a lot of nudity and some rather graphic sex scenes.

From the opening sequence I knew this would be better than Left for Dead (2009) and at least as fun as Dead End (2007; which was trashy but playfully gory).  The scenes exude a sophomoric atmosphere, as if Axe Body Spray produced this raunchy film that spot-lights its tropes with a lets explore here to great, were out of weed there and throw in a sex scene on an old mental hospital bed.  The guys try to joke their way into partner swaps and threesomes until the body count starts to accumulate.

The gore is abundant and, despite a moderately low budget, quite entertaining.  The dismemberment in the opening sequence was a feisty little number, the delightfully gory barbed wire noose scene offers a solid mix of fun and tension, and then there was the butchering scene yikes!  Our mutant rednecks engage in some skin-peeling torture, just slowly flaying and yanking his skin off while the dude was still alive.  It was legitimately tough to watch, but ooooooh did I adore it!  This was graphic, brutal, visceraleven a bit gigglya solid cruelly playful nod to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986). Definitely in contention for best death scene of the franchise along with the epic Kelly Clarkson death scene in Dead End (2007), that poor guy from Left for Dead (2009) and Emmanuelle Chriquis death in Wrong Turn (2003).

The quality of the kills is high for the hillbilly horror subgenre.  The writing might be terrible, yet this sequel manages to do the franchise honor!  Youll feel more fun than fear, but youll wince and reel about as often as you gasp with a smile.  I thought Declan O'Brien did a piss poor job with Left for Dead (2009), but he might have learned from some of his mistakes.  Im putting this right up there with the original Wrong Turn (2003) in raw entertainment value.  Its clearly a sillier approach, but its up there.  And even if you consider Wrong Turn (2003) a bad movie, this is a badder movie.  But its a really good badder movie.  LOL.  Enjoy.",1498435200,2,4007,4.874446085672083

4693836,3,B005GT3X68,"After crucifying Wrong Turn 3 (justifiably) I must acknowledge Wrong Turn 4: Bloody Beginnings, a prequel to the first Wrong Turn film is a somewhat decent viewing experience.

 Three deformed youths escape from their cells in a mental institution (a younger Three-Finger among them) and chaos ensues when they go on a rampage with the other patients. About 30 years later some young people go skiing in the mountains and come across an old abandoned mental institution and decide to bunker down during a snowstorm. Unfortunately for them it's not actually abandoned but inhabited by three now adult deformed cannibals lead by...

I thought Sean Skene played Three-Finger well getting the manic & excited grunts down pat and funnily enough he also plays the character Vincent in the movie. Some of the kills are quite good especially the human fondue one which looked realistic and aptly drawn out for extra effect.

 As odious as WT3 was WT4 despite it's unfavourable reviews is well worth a rental at least and although my positive views on it could be explained by the Dr Pepper induced euphoria I found myself in whist watching the film I really do think it's quite a solid little movie.",1463702400,,1191,4.876237623762377

Each has its own flavor, its own method of serving out the disturbing mix of gore and action. This one approaches the levels of brutality seen in the second, rawest and nastiest entry in the series, and really outdoes it in SQ (sexy quotient). Lots of fit, naked bodies rolling around together. One thing that a horror movie is allowed to be is manipulative, and this film turns it into a genuine virtue.

Then the hillbillies. The whole back-story is an incompetent rip-off of the Anthony Hopkins motif in Silence of the Lambs. Add a lot of predictable and poorly done butchering and dismembering of the cast, and you have the movie. The ending is so poorly done, it's laughable. My advice? Skip it.

Extremely pointless torture scene which doesn't make any sense **SPOILER** later because when the hillbillies were trapped 1 woman said ""no we can't kill them"" but she was willing to let them finish the torture at first because she thought he was dead. First no one one would fall asleep while watching 3 dangerous deformed men! 2nd no you wouldn't be like them miss because they kill for no reason you'd be protecting yourself!

The action is fast and shocking as well as deviantly gory, I also had a sense of the inbreds as being some kind of family of sorts surviving on their own, up front and in your face, I very much recommend this film.",1404518400,,626,4.358974358974359

So we have a comprehension and empathy deficit when it comes to comprehending the really bad stuff.

This movie does not deliver that message unlike the original Wrong Turn.  This movie informs that if we can't even sit through it, then what does it say about people who were able to sustain that type of infliction in real life.  The movie is not two hours long.  The culprits of WW2 went beyond two hours at a time when they were laying into their victims.

And why a hospital just as why nurses are often featured as preferred victims?

Either that, or he's as damaged through inbreeding as the monstrous trio at the heart of this series that (along with Saw and its ilk) personifies the satanic genre known as ""torture porn"".  How else to explain the horrific manners in which he utilizes beastly (if cheap) looking villains to dispatch people (the guard, psychiatrist & musical therapist from the sanitarium and the kids who seek refuge in the abandoned facility 3 decades later), none of whom are particularly ""bad"".  Add in some really lame acting, gratuitous and unnecessary sex and nudity, terrible choices (sparing the freaks who've killed several of your friends when you have the chance to terminate them), unbelievable scenarios (the lone person guarding the freaks falls asleep after the others have repaired to a room, thereby allowing them to escape; the women crawling out of the asylum into the snow tunnel one by one even after the freaks break down the door to the room), and an overall bleak outlook (the villains all survive, the innocent all die terrible deaths) and you have a piece of trash without a single redeeming aspect.

In an earlier, perhaps saner, era, O'Brien would have been locked up in the type of asylum featured in the movie.  And society as a whole would be in a much better state if he had been.  Instead, he makes swill like this that condemns us all through its mere existence.

4694033,5,B005GT3X68,"Wrong Turn 4: Bloody Beginnings (2011). Unrated Version.
 Running Time: 1 hour, 33 mins. Directed and written by Declan O'Brien.

This is a prequel to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wrong-Turn/dp/B001HM22VK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wrong Turn</a>&nbsp;(2003), the story before the first movie.

It is 1974. At the Glenville Sanatorium in West Virginia, Doctor Ryan (Arne MacPherson) is giving Dr. Anne McQuaid (Kristen Harris) an orientation inside the hospital. They go to the C Ward. One of the inmates grabs a hold of McQuaid's hair taking a hairpin. The doctor warns her to stay behind the yellow line. Then they come to the Hiliker brothers. They are dangerous inbred rednecks deformed that were found in the wood over the remains of their parents.  Dr. McQuaid is startled by Saw-Tooth (Brent Verot). Three Fingers, the youngest (Blaine Cypurda), chewed off his own fingers. One Eye, the middle child (Tristan Carlucci), poked his own eye out with a fork and ate it in front of a nurse. The older brother, Saw Tooth, wears a mask and has large teeth.
  After Dr. Ryan and Dr. McQuaid leave. The inmate with the hairpin tries to pick the lock of his cell. He then throws the hairpin to the brothers. Three Fingers is successful with the lock. They escape and kill the orderly (Scott Johnson). Then they kill Dr. Ryan and Dr. McQuaid.
 It is now 2003. At the Weston University, Jenna (Terra Vnesa) and Vincent (Sean Skene) are having sex and a few feet away Sara (Tanika Davis) and Bridget (Kaitlyn Leeb), the lesbians, are also having sex. Kenia (Jennifer Podavick) walks in and catches everyone in the act. She tells them it's time to go to the mountains.
  All arrive at the mountain including Daniel (Dean Armstrong), Kyle (Victor Linck Jr) and Claire (Samantha Kendrick). They leave their cars behind and use snow mobiles to go to Porter's cabin. After 30 minutes, Kyle is lost, but he is sure he should go right. It is freezing cold. The temperature has dropped 20 degrees. A snow storm is coming. Kyle says they need to make it over the ridge over there. Daniels believes he is making a wrong turn.
  later, they find a building. It is the old, abandoned Glenville Sanatorium. They get comfortable inside and explore.
  Here comes the mutant rednecks.

Spoiler: Scott Johnson played the orderly and also the adult Saw Tooth.
Of course, they had to kill off Vincent. The actor, Sean Skene, also plays the adult Three Finger.

Sean Skene and Dan Skene are real-life brothers. Their father, Rick Skene was a stunt coordinator on this film.

This film traces the hillbilly brothers in their youth, which was really interesting to watch. The gore factor has been increased dramatically in this film, but I'm not faint-hearted, I quite enjoyed that. Some people may think it has been taken too far with the blood and dismemberments, but if you're a fan of the franchise, you will most likely appreciate that. In some ways it is funny to think that the hillbilly's have sort of 'calmed down' since this film (it's a prequel and they are more monstrous than in the originals).

Definitely worth watching, and it was great to see a different setting. The snowstorm was a good excuse for the group of friends to seek shelter, and I enjoyed the fact that the heroine didn't escape at the end. Those darned wire fences!

4694083,3,B005GT3X68,"In 1974, the Glenville Sanatorium is overrun by three of its most notorious patients: the inbred cannibal brothers known as One Eye, Three Finger, and Saw Tooth. Thirty years later, a pack of partying college students make a wrong turn and end up camping out in the old abandoned asylum. Little do they know that its prior residents still live within its walls, and meat is back on the menu! WRONG TURN 4 presents itself as a prequel to the series, but then lazily jumps forward to the 2000's after a brief introduction of the infamous killers. It is clear from the beginning that SHARKTOPUS director Declan O'Brien is entirely unconcerned with the plot or characters, and that he is just using the shell of a film to put on another gory display. WRONG TURN 4 is just as bland and predictable as the third installment. It lacks the suspense of the original and the off-the-wall insanity of the second, leaving Slasher fans with nothing more than a few bloody kills and ample amounts of nudity. If you're in it for the gore, you get several decapitations, a giant drill through the chest, a human buffet, and countless missing limbs, but WRONG TURN 4 is nothing more than a mindless knock-off of the Norwegian hit COLD PREY.

It also had Henry Rollins, who always seems to do a great job at being overly serious in B-rate horror movies. By the third film, however, they pretty much stop trying.

In this fourth installment, everything is pretty poor. In fact, only one person even comes close to attempting to act. The characters themselves are so poorly fleshed out that you often confuse several with each other, and have no real clue which characters are dating which other characters. In addition to poor acting, there are also poor makeup effects, and, of course, CGI blood, which is the bane of most horror aficionados.

This film is supposed to act as a prequel, but it is so badly done that you often forget that these are supposed to be the same three mutants from the original film, especially since the poor makeup job draws a disconnect. There is nothing scary about the film, and there are no tense moments. There is only one cringe-inducing scene, and there another absolutely ridiculous scene that could have ended the film, but the last surviving male character allows himself to be talked back from killing the mutants over some strange and sudden debate over higher morality.

Essentially, this film is only for completists who want to see all installments of the franchise, or those that are fans of bad horror movies; however, even the latter will probably be disappointed.",1358380800,2,1502,4.769230769230769

Anyways, they overtake sanatorium. They kill the lead doctor in a realistic looking way, doesn't look like they used cgi at all. Then we cut to a couple making out & a lesbian couple making out on the other side of the room! Don't worry, the good stuff ends for awhile. Group of teens head to a cabin as a snow storm approachs & they get lost but find the eerie looking sanatorium in the middle of nowhere & decide to shack up there for the night as the snow storm nears. It's pretty creepy on it's own as they search the place, seen many ghost shows about abandoned hospitals. Anyways, the cannibals live there. It moves slow for awhile but does pick up in the middle to a bloody finale.

Overall, a very well done film. Not a classic but very enjoyable. I don't usual question logic of horror but they should have shown what happens to the sanatorium. The inmates overtake it & it flash fowards 20-30 years. How did the brothers survive? where did the inmates go?

This movie is tops in my opinion because it does something I'm always praying for in this kind of shallow plot, hack & slash, lots of gore kind of movie which is that everyone gets killed!!!  Well, I am soooooo glad to finally see this in a movie.  The ""innocents???"" who are always such incredible idiots and do so many stupid things that I can't help but to  feel they deserve to die.  In fact, it's only through their sheer stupidity that they're even in the situation to get killed and they just don't ever seem to get it so I feel no need to have these types survive only to produce idiot children.  They deserve to die!!! Unfortunately, there always seems to be a couple people who manage to survive and they're usually a male and female who never even knew each other before, but yet somehow form a romance in the midst of all the killing - now how stupid is that?  The killers aren't stupid at all.  They know exactly what's going on and in this movie they take care of business and kill them all. Anyway, at last a movie where THEY ALL DIE!!!

4694153,1,B005GT3X68,"I'm not certain the explanation/back story helped or hurt this latest installment in the franchise.  (So far, I've only liked/kept the first movie, I've tossed the rest.)
Originality doesn't seem to be the filmmaker's goal, as proven by this nonsensical version of a well-worn plot device: trap a group of kids in an abandoned building and slowly kill them off one by one.  Who hasn't seen this gimmick used before?  In their case, they hedged a trifle by wondering aloud: when is a prison not a prison but a hospital instead?  I can't think of a single hospital with prison cells, I certainly wouldn't go to one that did!
The biggest problem with the story this time out is the vast number of people that went romping through the wilderness during a snowstorm.  True, a large cast does mean a high body count.  However, when that number is so great that you can't remember one character from another, especially in the dark, that becomes a problem.  It also poses the question, with superior numbers why didn't they simply get rid of the three inbred idiots in the first place?  It also puts into question the type of education these college students were getting that they couldn't outsmart three inbred idiots?

What did we learn from this movie?  Even if a building is ""creepy, warm, and dusty"", it's worth setting up residence for a night or two.  Always pass around booze found in a sanatorium.  And you can never have too much barbwire on hand.  I also question why a place like that would need a drill that big, it's my understanding that lobotomies require a lot less.

Bad acting, terrible plot, a foregone conclusion: why bother?",1338768000,4,1640,4.688811188811189

4694166,1,B005GT3X68,"I saw the first film in this franchise some years ago when it arrived on DVD. I wasn't thrilled but I didn't hate the film either. It felt like they were taking the horror genre Wes Craven started with THE HILLS HAVE EYES, an inbred cannibalistic mutant family, and relocating it to the back hills of West Virginia. The location change shows Hollywood's contempt for anything found in flyover country. I think they still think DELIVERANCE was a documentary and that folks outside of New York and Los Angeles are all this way.

But things progressed from there. With the quick return on investment from the first film a franchise was born and the sequels began. I had a hard time even finishing the second (and I'm not quite sure I did) and never bothered to seek out the third film. I wish the same could be said for the newest fourth film which is subtitled BLOODY BEGINNINGS.

Yes they've decided the best way to go with this one is to take us back and show us where it all started. Never fear though even with this one we could still go back a few more years and have a part 5! Lucky us!

The film opens in 1974 at a sanatorium where a new doctor is being shown around the facility. The head of the place takes her down the secluded hall where the worst patients are, including three inbred hillbillies from West Virginia. One had eaten 2 of his own fingers, another forked out his eyeball and eaten it and the last has filed his teeth into sharp points. All three suffer from a malady where they feel no pain. Of course another patient steals a hairpin from this new doctor, tosses it to the 3 brothers who then escape and let the rest of the inmates out to wreak havoc on the sanatorium and kill all in charge.

Fast forward to 2003 and the obligatory nude sex scene introduces us to two couples enjoying one another's company. They're interrupted by a friend who enters and tells them they have 5 minutes to get dressed and ready and then she's leaving. The group is heading for a weekend in the woods at a cabin their friend owns. They take cars to a designated dropping point and decide, even though a terrible winter storm is on the way, to take their snow mobiles and head out.

Of course they get lost and where to the end up? At the infamous sanatorium from the start of the film! They enter and are not surprised that the building is warm, thinking that of course someone takes care of the boiler in the place to make sure the pipes don't burst. After a series of stereotypical stupid ideas (""hey let's divide up and search the place!"") they turn in for the night, sleeping (and of course having sex) in various rooms.

During the night the first victim is killed, one of the boyfriends who can't sleep and sneaking around the building comes upon the body of a friend who was separated from the group. The next morning when he can't be found they search for him only to have his girlfriend find the 3 cannibals snacking on his body.

She runs screaming for the rest of them to get out but not before another is lassoed with a piece of barb wire which after a tug of war between the cannibals and her boyfriend decapitates here. With no winter clothing they can't leave so are forced to find a way to overcome the incredibly intelligent inbreds. Well, they seem incredibly intelligent compared to the stupid things these kids do.

The movie is little more than a way to show off a body count and various gory set pieces. In the extras you discover that the movie was shot in 19 days and while the photography and technical aspects of it are pretty good, the whole set up and story makes you wonder if the money couldn't have been spent better elsewhere.

I'm not a fan of movies that have been termed torture porn. I hated HOSTEL but at the same time appreciated the SAW films. At least those had some story behind them, some mystery to solve. Fans of this sort of film are not horror fans, they are body count fans. They live and breathe to watch some new form of torture or murder occur. That's not scary and honestly becomes quite boring after a while. And truth be told that's the biggest sin with this film. It's boring.

If you're a fan of the series then by all means enjoy. If you like little more than watching the body count rise and various forms of blood gushing incidents happen then you'll like it. If you want a horror film though or something that doesn't have the dumbest group of kids around then pass it by.

I leave you with one of the stupidest thing that happens in the movie. It irked me so I have to share it with you. The group, minus a few friends who've been killed, captures the 3 inbreds and one says he's going to kill them by lighting them on fire. Another tells him not to, that it will only drag him down to their level and they're above that. Needless to say he dozes off guarding them so they escape, kill him and later on the rest of the group. Yes they all die but then again if you noticed the title this is only the beginning and had they not then it would be the end, eh?",1332806400,,5023,4.310381355932203

4694169,1,B005GT3X68,"First off I would like to make it perfectly clear that I am a huge fan of the Wrong Turn movies.  I saw the first one, loved it, and became even move impressed by the second.  And I loved the new traps, blood, and gore in the third Wrong Turn.  But this one is by far the worst horror movie I've ever seen.  It disgraces the Wrong Turn movies more then American Pie Presents Band Camp or even American Pie Presents The Book Of Love (A film I won't even see because it has gotten so many bad reviews) disgraces and insults the American Pie movies.  IN THIS REVIEW I WILL POINTS OUT THE MISTAKES ONE BY ONE IN NUMBERS.

MISTAKE 1 (the beginning of the movie)
-At the beginning of this movie you see an insane asylum that seems worse then even your typical insane asylum with Dr. Brendon Ryan showing Dr. Ann Marie McQuaid (a psychologist) where the cannibals from the Wrong Turn series are kept in the insane asylum, in the year 1974.  You see Dr. Ryan telling Dr. McQuaid about how the cannibals in the movie were found eating their parents in the woods of West Virginia causing them to be locked up where they have eaten a few of their own body parts and that was the only thing this movie did right to live up to it's name.  Doctor Ryan also talks about how the cannibals are smart and have a disorder that allows them to fell no pain what so ever.  After that scene it was like the idiot director and creator of the film decided to ruin the fun of the cannibals trying to escape form the mental institute (as if they hadn't already made a mistake by not showing them in the woods eating their parents, getting captured, and taken to the insane asylum), by just having one cannibal throw what seemed to be a vintage 1960's hair barrette to the smarter cannibals in another jail cell allowing them to pick their cell lock.  After the cannibals pick the lock, a guard comes into where they escaped and is eaten by them.  Then the cannibals who picked the lock open all the other cannibals cells and chaos breaks out.  And as you might guess even though it only shows the cannibals killing Dr. Ryan and Dr. McQuaid they kill everyone and that's the end of their time with the insane asylum and anywhere in the movie from 1974-2002.

MISTAKE 2 (the time period the rest of this movie takes place in)
-Next the director takes you to a college in West Virginia where a bunch of students are in a dorm getting ready to go up to a cabin in the mountains for a ski trip in the year 2003.  Then the group of college students going to the cabin on a ski trip, as you might guess park their car, ride snow mobiles, get lost in a severe snow storm trying to find the cabin and end up settling in at the insane asylum out in the middle of no where the cannibals escaped form in 1974.  Again dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb every single movie that takes place in the past it seems like takes place in this past decade.  Why?  This past decade wasn't that great, sure the internet & cell phone technology from the 1990's was developing tremendously, but the economy was bad and it didn't have the good fashion statements, images, design styles, and fads the past decades did.  Plus the music scene from this past decade is by far the worst ever.  And worst of all the first Wrong Turn movie was made the same year this piece of crap took place talk about a hole in one screw up.  Why not just have the movie take place in the 1970's, 80's or 90's?

MISTAKE 3 (The college students seemed to vulnerable)
-When the college students in this film decide to spend the night in the cannibals abandon insane asylum out in the middle of no where during a severe snow storm where their cell phones don't work, they park their snow mobiles in front of it and one student (Porter) is instructed to bring their bags into the insane asylum.  Then all the college students except the one (Porter) bringing in the over night bags make it into the insane asylum.  Next you see 3 cannibals have killed Porter before he had a chance to bring in the over night bags and are taking his body into the insane asylum.  Then you see the rest of the college students exploring the insane asylum, turning on the power, getting drunk off Dr. Ryan's scotch, getting stoned, finding an old 1970's film canister containing brutal therapy treatment to one of the cannibals and watching it on a projection screen.  Then one college student tells the rest about the Wrong Turn cannibals legend.  Then all the college students except one (Vincent) get a good nights rest.  As you might guess Vincent was killed in the night because he decided to wonder off.  OK, lets be completely honest here, after seeing the first 3 Wrong Turn films do we really think the cannibals are going to let the college students get a good night's rest?  And do we really think they would kill the toughest target in the one college student who is up first?  And how much time do we really think the Cannibals would take to dismantle the college kids snow mobiles and take there belongings before they decide to hunt them?

MISTAKE 4 (All the college kids except 4 (3 killed by the cannibals) have a chance to kill them and they don't do it)
-The college students find out about the cannibals when they see them killing one of the college student's girl friend's with a barb wire noose, they run to their snow mobiles and find out they don't work.  Then one of the college kids goes off skiing through the woods of the cannibals insane asylum to find help.  The rest of the college kids are stuck in the insane asylum trying to defend them selves from the cannibals with sharp object type weapons they find in the basement of the insane asylum.  A little over half way though the film, you see the college kid who went off skiing to find help freezing her but off near a small fire she made that ends up being put out by a snow drift.  Then you see the rest of the college students except for 2 of them lure the 3 cannibals through a fire trap with their weapons into a jail cell, close the door, and lock it.  Then you see the one male college student who hasn't been killed by the cannibals pouring kerosene into the jail cell the cannibals are trapped in getting ready to burn them to death with a cigarette lighter have a sudden change of heart from words said to him by his friends causing him to change his mind about killing the cannibals after the cannibals had kept their mouth's shut (when asked) about the parts they had taken off the college kids snow mobiles to dismantle them.  OK, would any of the rest of the people the cannibals are hunting in the other Wrong Turn movies have done the same in this situation?

MISTAKE 5 (The ending)
-OK time for the ending, it's pretty simple everyone dies.  2 girls are killed by one of the cannibals traps at the very end and the girl who went off skiing ends up freezing to death.  Then after the 2 girls are killed you see one of the cannibals drive the toe truck they had in the other Wrong Turn movies to retrieve their remains.  Good job not showing us how the cannibals got their toe truck Mr. idiot director, producer, and screen writer.  Yeah I take it the cannibals lived in the cabin they lived in, in the first Wrong Turn too another thing that wasn't shown to us in this film.

So basically all in all Wrong Turn 4 (The Beginnings) does not live up to it's title one bit, is basically just a crappy remake of the first Wrong Turn, and should have been done like this:
-Starts off in the 1960's showing the cannibals being born and possibly them being kicked out of school (who knows they could have been home schooled before they ate their parents anyways).
-Show's them going to the insane asylum for eating their parents in the late 1960's early 1970's.
-The movie should have shown the cannibals escaping and starting what they did in all the other Wrong Turns in the mid 1970's.  There they could have shown how the Cannibals got their toe truck instead of just bringing it in out of no where at the end of the movie at basically the same time the first Wrong Turn took place.
-And in the end the insane asylum should have been burned down and at least one person should have survived.

If you want a good movie about the beginning's of a monster in a horror film I would strongly not recommend this garbage.  Instead I would recommend the The Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Beginning, Rob Zombie's Halloween, or Tremors 4.
And on my final note even though it's completely off topic, I would like to send a message out to the idiots who made this garbage Wrong Turn 4 movie.  What's next for you idiots, making a movie about the video game The Final Fight (A film that should clearly take place in the early 1990's), having Duane ""The Rock"" Johnson play Andore (someone who clearly should be played by Dalip ""The Great Kali"" Singh Rana with his skin lightened tremendously) and having it take place when this piece of crap garbage Wrong Turn 4 movie took place?",1328918400,5,8955,4.363636363636363

You know a movie is terrible when you can't even at least bring yourself to fast-forward through it.

The real Wrong Turn was to allow inexperienced children to continue making terrible movies.
So, it was just so wrong to even think about making another.

Furthermore, how do they even get the funding for trash like this? When I purchased the movie I expected it to be as good, if not better than the previous (3) movies. I was so angry after I reviewed this movie, that I completely tossed my copy in the trash and kept the DVD jacket.  That says a lot. I've been burned by this movie and I don't think I will make the same mistake again. The movie had soft porn sex scenes way to graphic for kids to see. This movie had the same basic ingredients of a poor movie production, and that is colleges age twenty something's, sex, and the poorest storyline I've ever viewed.

I was barely able to watch 10 minutes of it.  It is obvious that the Wrong Turn sequels have run their course with this disaster.  After the beginning of just mindless blood and gore the movie pans to a room with twin beds where one heterosexual couple are having sex and two lesbians are having sex.  What was the point of the soft porn?  What was the sense of making this movie?  I couldn't even watch anymore of it after the sex scenes.

Points for shooting this slasher amidst a raging blizzard, with teenagers
on snowmobiles, instead of the now cliched (though always effective) darkened
woods.

The opening scene had me gagging on my popcorn (electro shock therapy, anyone?)
Talk about a chaotic bloodbath...

Unlike most reviewers here, i liked the characters (deformed hillbilles & teenagers
alike).
Extra points for an interacial lesbian couple (hey, it's a new twist, right?)
There is a human buffet scene that is just a few notches over the top, though.
If you can stand a guy getting eaten for ten minutes, while his friends debate
whether to rescue him or not, then you have a stronger stomach than i.

4694183,1,B005GT3X68,"It would have taken so little to satisfy ""Wrong Turn"" fans.  This was never a great franchise to begin with, and what little it had going for it was good and truly exhausted by the first sequel.  I only even took a chance on this because I thought an origin story set in the winter opened up some possibilities for creativity.  I live in Minnesota, and a midnight snowstorm with a barren landscape is all that's required to scare me.

But writer Declan O'Brien couldn't be bothered to give director Declan O'Brien a thing to work with.  Not in terms of plot, or pacing, or surprises or dialog or characterization.  This is by-the-numbers slaughter, a Mad Libs of murder and mayhem.  Or perhaps O'Brien had just finished playing a ""Clue"" marathon and was reduced to thinking in terms of ""the maniac did it on the basketball court with a weed wacker.""

In a simplistic genre movie, so little is actually required.  Some suspense, good-looking actors, a touch of nudity, some comic relief, perhaps an act or two of heroism by an unlikely candidate.  It's cliched because by and large it serves.  It serves to entertain, because it punches many of the right buttons.

In ""Wrong Turn 4,"" we have a McDonald's that ruins fast food and a bartender who can't make a rum and Coke.  If you can't get the most primitive, basic, visceral things right for us to enjoy, then what good are you?",1323302400,,1379,4.579591836734694

4694195,2,B005GT3X68,"After seeing the previous 3 Wrong Turn's, I was actually pretty excited that a prequel had been released.  Being able to see where everything started sounded interesting, especially since we were going to see the three main hillbilly characters shedding some blood as children.  The beginning seemed promising - c'mon, mental institutes with murderous crazies ALWAYS sounds like fun. But boy...was this movie bad.  The characters are ridiculous.  After a few minutes of ""terror"" at the opening of the movie, we then get to see some totally unnecessary sex.  Well, of course.  And not just one couple, but two, yay!  And there's even some lesbians! Well, given these facts, you know some deaths are about to incur...only, they're really boring deaths.  Even the most interesting one, the hillbillies version of The Melting Pot, lost my attention after ten seconds.  People can say this movie gives a shout out to female empowerment, but I totally disagree.  This is only said because all of the men are killed off first - however, these women are idiots.  I mean, pure rocks for brains.  They scream every 5 seconds, are stupid enough to stay in a room (though there's hundreds more in this large institute) that has a huge hole in the door, worry about snow clothes when all of their friends are being murdered, and then keep drifting away from each other throughout the entire movie...and these are only a few examples from a million depicting the lack of intelligence of the women in this movie.  And, is this SUPPOSED to be a comedy?!  Because more scenes attempted to be humorous rather than frightening.  The best part was the very end, when the 2 girls ride off in the sunset: I laughed for a few seconds, then thankfully hit the eject button on this flop.  To sum it all up: egh....find another movie to watch.

***UPDATE: This movie is now the second worst Wrong Turn movie. The newer part 5 is definitely, without a doubt, 100% the worst one of them all. Because of that I have bumped my original rating of 1 star up to 2.",1323216000,5,2031,4.692090395480226

4694198,2,B005GT3X68,"In the horror world there is a loyalty that you won't find in any other genre. No matter how many bad sequels, awful remakes, and painful prequels Hollywood brings us, we just keep coming back for more. Case in point, ""Wrong Turn 4: Bloody Beginnings."" The original ""Wrong Turn"" was a fun if fairly derivative slice of hillbilly horror that struck the right cord with horror audiences. It was not a box office hit making just $16 million on a budget of $12 million but the film sold millions of dvds and we can thank it with starting the series that no one really asked for. ""Wrong Turn 2"" turns the tables by turning the first film into a reality show. It was fun, campy, and delightfully over-the-top. The less said about the third film the better. Now, eight years after the first installment, we have ""Wrong Turn 4"" a prequel that sets to up the stakes. But...does it succeed?

The film opens in 1974 at the Glenville Sanatorium with Dr. Ryan (Arne McPherson) showing a local psychiatrist Dr. Ann McQuaid (Kristen Harris) around the psychiatric hospital. The cannibals from the previous films-One Eye, Three Finger, and Saw Tooth now are locked up in the institution as children. But the cannibals escapes and sets other insane patient free in the hospital. Then cannibals savagely murder an orderly, Guard, Dr. Ryan and Dr. McQuaid.
The film then switches to present day where a group of college kids, Kenia (Jennifer Pudavick), lesbian couple Sara (Tenika Davis) and Bridget (Kaitlyn Wong), Lauren (Ali Tataryn), Jenna (Terra Vnesa), and Claire (Samantha Kendrick), along with their guy friends Kyle (Victor Zinck), Vincent (Sean Skene) and Daniel (Dean Armstrong) are going snowmobiling. They are heading to their friend Porter's cabin in the mountains. They get lost in a storm and seek refuge inside the now abandoned Glenville Sanatorium. Little do they know, the three now adult cannibals are hiding out in the sanatorium and murdering trespassers. The movie makes it unclear as to the whereabouts of rest of patients set free by cannibals.

The group of teenagers explore the asylum, and decide to wait out the storm. After a montage of rolling around in wheelchairs, acting on illegal drugs, drinking booze and acting like teenagers, the storm still hasn't stopped so the teenagers are forced to sleep in the desolate building. In the middle of the night, Vincent, suffering from insomnia, walks around the asylum and finds Porter's mutilated body - apparently he didn't make it to his cabin either. He is then killed by Saw-Tooth having a metal rod shoved into his chin and out through the top of his head. The next morning, everyone discovers they are still snowed in, and Vincent is missing. The gang splits up to look for him, and Jenna witnesses the cannibals cutting Porter up. She runs back to tell the others and they all meet up in the auditorium. Something wrapped in Porter's jacket is thrown at them and Kenia opens it up to reveal Porter's severed head. Screaming and panicking, the group flocks around the door, trying to get out but the doors are locked. The three cannibals-up in the balcony, throw down a strip of barb-wire and loop it around Claire's neck, pulling her up to the balcony. Kyle tries to save her, but it is too late and the barb-wire tightens, severing Claire's head. Horrified, those who are left of them (Kenia, Sara, Bridget, Lauren, Jenna, Kyle and Daniel) run outside and try to escape on their snowmobiles, but the engines won't turn and it is revealed that the cannibals had stripped them of their spark plug wires. Lauren sets off to ski down the mountain to retrieve help and the other six run inside to try to defend themselves.

""Wrong Turn 4: Bloody Beginnings"" is all sorts of lame. Bad CGI, atrocious acting, and thoroughly unlikable characters are just the start of this film's problems. When will filmmakers realize that when we don't like their characters, we don't care who lives and who dies. When we don't care, the movie is robbed of any and all suspense. Speaking of suspense, it is fairly obvious that ****SPOILER ALERT*** all of our ""teen"" characters die and all three hillbillies live as we know they were around for the ""first"" installment. This is just lazy filmmaking all around with some effects that have to be seen to be believed and no I don't mean that as a compliment.

***SPOILERS***

You mean to tell me that in this sanitarium that there are no guards and that they have NO contingency plans for if the inmates get out of their cells?  Okay, why not?  But on top of that, NO ONE goes investigating when there is no word from the sanitarium, or when the people who work there don't come home at night?  No one investigates this at all?  Maybe if this was the 1700's that might be believable, but this is MODERN times.

So then our dumb main characters show up, and frankly I watched this 12 hours ago and as I sit here I can only remember ONE character's name, ""Vincent"" cuz they were yelling it over and over again.  When I can't remember the characters names it's a real failure on the part of the writer because it means there is nothing memorable about them.

So they come across this abandoned nut house and they just decide to barge on in because it's getting cold out and there's no other place to go.  Okay, why didn't they just follow the road that's leading to that place and take it back to civilization?  Guess it doesn't fit into the plot.  Also what happened to all the other inmates we saw at the beginning of the movie?  If the main villains ate them, just establish it by having them find a pile of bones or something.

So they party at this nut house loud and hard and these crazies just let them?  Okay...  Then they start killing these college students one at a time and frankly deserve it for how stupid they are.  Why don't they just get into a room with a window, and barricade the hell out of it, stay there until the snow stops and then make a run for it when it's clear outside?  Again I guess that makes too much sense.

Also, where the hell did these nut jobs get an ice auger?  You mean to tell me that it was just laying around the sanitarium somewhere?  On top of that you mean to tell me that these back water hill billies who are mentally retarded and have been locked in a nut house for years know how to take apart and put back together the inner workings of a snowmobile!?!  And on top of THAT, they know how to ride them!?!  How does that make sense!?!

Plus if that wasn't enough, these college students FINALLY trap these guys in a cell, lock them in there and they finally have the upper hand.  One of the students douses them in kerosene and is about to light them on fire and end this nightmare, but one of the air-headed bimbos pipes up and says, ""We can't kill them!!!""  Why not!?!  They just MURDERED your friends!!!  And if you don't kill them, they are going to get out and kill YOU and the rest of your friends!  Use your brain, it's kill or be killed!!!

So of course the students fall asleep, the crazies get out and kill them all.  Movie ends.  Oh, one after thought, where the hell did they get all this barbed wire!?!

Second, screaming and running like headless chickens while making dumb mistakes or dumb do-nothing mistakes as a female stereotyping formula.
Third, poorly ""borrow"" ideas from the SAW success for torture. Obvious props and cut away editing makes for a cheap horror film.
Fourth, have a ""doesn't make sense"" storyline of: What happened to the institutionalized patients; why guards and others were so easily handled; why the institution looked so well maintained after so many years and how did three patients survive unnoticed for so long.
Fifth, using stunt and TV actors for this film's leads saved a lot of money and probably didn't make any difference in acting portrayals.

4694216,1,B005GT3X68,"Yes, it can be coined a B-grade film, which means it should be held to a B-grade standard of critical review.  The first of this series was adventurous and somewhat genuine, with good acting and a solid script.  Unfortunately after that, it seemed to go downhill, with WT4 at the bottom.  The issue with WT4 is just about everything.  Part of this can be the fact this film obviously was done on a shoe string budget.  While this is pretty common for a film of this genre that is bypassing a theater near you, what it lacks even more, is effort.

Perhaps taking some time to find more investors and getting a better overall crew and cast could have helped WT4.  Even the second and third installments of this Film Series did better, where the actors portrayed their characters with enough back story and purpose to make a viewer at least somewhat curious as to how their fates might play out.  A loaf of bread and a plywood plank getting thrown into a chainsaw covered in ketchup would have faired for more entertainment than what this film delves out.

The antagonists of the story are not scary or even that sinister looking.  The trapped friends are supposed to be late teen/early twenty chums who are all couples and like to smoke weed.  That's believable, however none of these characters really has any depth or significance in the first place.  That creates a double whammy of ""WHO CARES"" when the juvenile gore fest style action scenes kill them off.

When I watched the first 2 Wrong turn movies I must admit, I liked them, they were kind of bloody but not too much and kind of funny in a way too.  But you have to watch them to know what I mean.  The 3rd movie was good but not as much as the first 2 but still ok.
But now comes the 4th one.
Here is what the story is about:
A bunch of students leave for a weekend of snowmobiling to go up in a cabin of a friend, but they get lost and find refuge up in an abandoned sanitarium.
In 1974, Glenville Sanatorium was the site of a brutal and horrific crime, as three hideously deformed cannibals went on a merciless killing spree.  Today, 18 years later, they will have these new students to prey upon as the medical ward becomes their hunting ground.
So the students have 2 choices, fight back or die.
I tell you some scenes are not for the sensitive.  There is one in particular that I found very hard to watch,
as they are making a fondue with one of the students while he's alive.
If you like those types of movies, then you're in luck, this movie is filled with blood and gore and a lot of suspense.  Apart form the gore I enjoyed Wrong Turn 4.  It has a certain je ne sais quoi.",1321142400,5,1784,3.9719887955182074

4694224,1,B005GT3X68,"A truly bizarre and disturbing opening in a West Virginia sanatorium sets the stage for this fourth entry in the WRONG TURN franchise.  Writer/director Declan O'Brien pulls out all the stops in this derivative, bloodsoaked and ultimately revolting film.
Set in a beautiful snowbound setting, we get the expected group of stranded collegians whose primary focus in life is sex and booze and doing stupid things.  O'Brien attempts dark humor to ""lighten"" things but to little avail.  The three redneck cannibals are vile, disgusting and incredibly intelligent considering their uneducated background.
There's no real suspense since we know exactly where the movie's going as it IS a prequel.  The gore is plentiful and nauseating, the prime ingredient in the deluged torture genre.  Can we really call this ""entertainment""?
I enjoy a good horror movie, but this one's just plain horrible!",1320278400,23,886,5.3
4694225,2,B005GT3X68,"The Wrong Turn movies have always had a special place in my heart.  The first film was glorified trash, but it was enjoyable despite its shortcomings.  The second film was an ultra-bloody blast that was better than the original, while the third film had its share of good things, but was overall disappointing.  This fourth entry, Wrong Turn 4: Bloody Beginnings, finds our favorite inbred hillbilly cannibals back to doing what they do, only this time it's in an abandoned mental ward where a group of sexy friends get stuck inside on a ski trip.  While that sounds ripe for bloody fun, Wrong Turn 4 is sadly dull.  The characters are unlikable (as are the actors playing them), the film is predictable, and there's a torture scene that seems to never end.  There's some great gore effects on display though, and the hillbilly clan makeup is disgustingly well-made, so the film isn't a total loss all things considered.  All in all, if you're a fan of the Wrong Turn franchise, give Wrong Turn 4 a try at the very least, just don't expect much out of it.",1320105600,31,1055,4.609625668449198
4694226,4,B005GT3X68,"It has a lot more as well such as great atmosphere, very likable characters, great special effects along with creative deaths and the best thing about the deaths is that they weren't all covered with terrible CGI and when the CGI came it actually looked pretty good!

Plot: In 1974 a sanatorium was taken over and had all of its workers slaughtered by three cannibalistic, mutant hillbillies.... Now, some years later, a group of nine friends have made a ""Wrong Turn"" while snowmobiling and end up at the sanatorium where they decide to spend the night... everything is fine until one of the college kids goes missing and soon they discover that they will be running for there lives in a game of cat and mouse from the three mutant hillbillies that caused the chaotic torture and cannibalism all those years ago!

Review: I did right another review for this movie but I changed it because when I read it some weeks later I totally disagreed with it! I also must mention that this movie is even better than the awesome trailer purposed it to be! First off I love the fact that this takes place during the winter and not many slasher movies do that especially when the first three films take place in the summer! The action was very crazy in my opinion the most suspenseful, crazy scene is when *Spoiler Alert* the girl is being strangled with barb wire and the boyfriend is trying to pull her down with blood pouring on him like crazy *End Spoiler*! A couple of scenes that I thought were very intense where the three young adults were running from three finger, and when the guy is being eaten alive like some sort of ""fondue"" by having his flesh torn off piece by piece and then having it fried and eaten on the spot! I do however still don't like how many lesbian sex scenes there were, I felt that they didn't need them as much but I will give props for when the movie first takes off towards the actual story the opening scene they chose to introduce some of the characters was an orgy between four people (A.K.A. three girls, one guy)! There were several atmospheres, one of which were being stuck in a corner in a dark room with all sorts of weapons around able to be killed with, that gives the impression of atmospheric fear and I admit when the movie began I felt that it was going to be extremely cheesy but it actually turned out quite superb and I will rank this movie along side parts one and two any day!

Gore: An extremely graphic, intense barb wire strangling that leads to the individual's head to cut off from the neck stump, a messy multiple stabbing scene, some nasty extra decapitations, a woman is brutally rug burned from a snowmobile (very bloody), a long spike is shoved through somebody's nose and out there head, a person has there flesh fried and are slowly eaten piece by piece, a graphic hung and quartered scene, a woman's brain is fried (literally), a nose bitten off, a woman has a huge toy-like drill impaled through her back side (very gory) and much more! This is The Most Grotesque, Goriest, Grisly, Grubbiest, Grimiest, and Gruesome Wrong Turn Movie to This Date!

Acting: I was very surprised at how the actors preformed there characters, it felt real, the only acting that wasn't bad but had a very annoying scream was the boyfriends hanging girl when he was trying to save her... I was laughing as much as I was screaming! The surviving aspect of the acting felt determined and that was very good! All in all it had a little over decent acting!

Bottom Line: Now you are all probably wondering why I gave this a four out of five, it is because of the story, the scenery is great, and the plot was decent but the prequel-idea for the story had been done death.... other than that... I will dare say that this is one of my most favorite Wrong Turn movies out of them all!

Rated R: for strong horror violence and gore, language, sexuality, and brief drug use

Is it worth the Buy on a scale of 1-10: 8
For the Movie itself on a scale of 1-5: 4 (it would be a 4 and a half out of 5 but alas the ratings on Amazon. Com won't let me!)

P.S. I know this was also a bit cheesy, but that's what I knew what I was in store for, so watch this with an open mind and you'll most likely come out happy.",1320019200,2,4231,4.374045801526718
4694227,3,B005GT3X68,"Tried for days to rent Wrong Turn 4; amazon readers said it was good. It was..okay. First, the inbred brothers looked too ""normal""..could have looked freakier. I suppose it was a social statement that lesbian sex was included, but I would have traded that for a few more creative dismemberments. And the mutant sister was not in it.. WTF?! But it had its moments; I'd probably watch it again. The human fondue was interesting. And the special features are always a fun-filled treat. I give it a C+.",1319932800,4,498,4.670454545454546

4694229,4,B005GT3X68,"Just finished watching this movie and have to say OMG, I've never seen characters making so many bad decisions in just one movie. I know, this movie is not oriented for deep thinking of any kind, but even than... Those people caught in abandoned mental hospital are probably belonging there anyway. Oh, let me see... my buddy is being eaten alive by inbred cannibals, but I don't agree with that. So let me just go there and see if I can help...knowing that 3 cannibals are there and after you.  Really? My butt would be out of there so fast, that you wouldn't get a chance to blink. The concept is about the same as in the previous Wrong Turn movies, but still kept my attention, while I rolled my eyes once in a while due to terrible and plain stupid decisions of characters. Those decisions were ultimately getting them in trouble in the first place. All in all, it's about the same blood, blood and more blood, chopped off heads and limbs. It's obviously low budget, all the action is happening in dark and eerie mental hospital with 3 inbreeds that apparently had more intelligence than those visitors. But hey, it kept me entertained on a rainy Saturday night with a glass of wine in my hand.",1319846400,3,1198,4.495412844036697
4694230,3,B005GT3X68,"If I would have seen Wrong Turn 4: Bloody Beginnings a year or two ago, I would have probably loved it. I mean, I did like the first three in the Wrong Turn series. However, my taste in movies has changed in the last year or so and I just have a hard time getting into these dumb violent movies these days. Wrong Turn 4 has a few scares, and the killers are pretty disturbing and grotesque looking. And there is a ton of gore. This one is definitely for the gorehounds.

Spoiler Alert:

The ending is horrible in my opinion. I would have preferred for there to have been at least one good character live. But two of the would-be heroines get decapitated at the very end, while the inbred cannibals survive to do more killing.

End Spoiler

So, if it's gore that you want, Wrong Turn 4 is good for that. If you're looking for something with substance, look elsewhere.",1319760000,2,866,4.327160493827161
4694231,5,B005GT3X68,"I absolutely loved this film from beginning to end, it is without a doubt the sickest and craziest film yet. This is a prequel and starts out in the 70's and explains the origin of the ""Mutants"" although they are really imbreds. I really don't want to say much more as it ruins the plot. There are parts that WILL make you cringe, but you cant turn away like a bad car wreck...It is also strange that a film with the number 4 after it is actually good, but it is!! The acting is believable, the gore is well you shall see, and the setting is just perfect. In my opinion this is my favorite followed by 3,1, and then 2 which so many people like 2 but i found it too silly i dunno.

Comparing this to the first installment, why oh why don't they stop making these brainless distructions of a fairly good movie?

The film itself is much better than the last installment. The gore was great although sometimes a little over the top, as for people saying there were a lot of bad CGI effects the only blatant CGI I saw was at the end and I didn't think it to be that bad.
The storyline was quite fun this time around and there was an abundance of Gory and creative kills. One of the kills involves the biggest drill in cinematic history and another memorable kill scene involves a human buffet complete with Liver and onions which are just Two of many great kills.
This time The women were pretty much in charge and had the brains,of course they showed a lot more than there brains but Gore and T&A usually go hand in hand,Plus there is a really hot lesbian couple thrown in the mix and they aren't shy about their love making. I really liked seeing the deadly trio of Three Fingers,Saw tooth and One Eye as adolescents and watching their evolution.
I liked this Idea of a prequel even though there were a few things that didn't add up,If your a fan of this franchise or slasher films in general I say buy it,you will want to watch it more than once.",1319500800,,1192,4.278761061946903
