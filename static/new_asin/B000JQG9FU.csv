8152643,4,B000JQG9FU,"The Discovery Channel has finally produced a good program on KV-63. Though not a block-buster video, it demonstrates the task Egyptologists face and how things are accomplished in the field. No mummies were found, so don't get your hopes up. The inscriptions on the empty coffins are currently covered with black resin material that may make deciphering any texts impossible. This is a glimpse at a fascinating chapter in the history of the Valley of the Kings. Otto Schaden, the dig leader, is a brilliant Egyptologist who has a wonderful low-key sense of humor.

There are numerous theories about the intent of the single-room space but no clear answers. There are a few tiny artifacts that link this cache to the tomb of Tutankhamun and KV-54 that are alluring. To date, August 2007, the dig team has not returned yet to finish opening the remaining storage jars and complete conservation work. Look forward to the final chapter on this exciting discovery.",1188604800,6,959,4.956521739130435
