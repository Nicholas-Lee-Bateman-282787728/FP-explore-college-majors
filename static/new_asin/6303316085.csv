Do the Rat Thing:  While being bothered by a prince from a neighboring kingdom who wishes to marry her, Jasmine is further infuriated with Aladdin when he addresses her as ""princess"" instead of her name, and that Aladdin won't let her accompany him on the streets because she doesn't know the first thing of being a street rat. To prove him wrong, she goes on the streets with Iago. But when she steals a magic mirror, it turns her into a rat and Iago into a lizard. Now the two have to sneak into the palace to find Aladdin so they can use Genie to reverse the curse.
This is just not very good.  There are funny moments, a couple of which are hilarious (Iago's lines are particularly amusing); but the plot is just stupid.  One thing would've saved it I admit, the supposedly deleted scene where Genie tries turning Jasmine back into a human & turns her into Gadget from Chip N' Dale Rescue Rangers!  ""Whoah, where'd that one come from?"" LOL.  That alone would have saved the episode for me because I love Rescue Rangers.  C-

Bad Mood Rising:
Aladdin, Jasmine, Abu, Iago and Genie head off on Carpet to open trade with Quirkistan. The gang is shocked to find Quirkistan a dreary wasteland; it turns out that the land is enchanted, and the weather and states of things are determined solely by the mood of King Mamoud, Quirkistan's spoiled child king. He's currently brooding over everyone missing his birthday party, and as a result, the whole land is doomed.  The gang tries to cheer up the King, but only Jasmine's storytelling can engage Mamoud.  So Jasmine will have to stay there and entertain the King forever!  This is much better.  It's your average Aladdin; a good episode with an interesting idea and some funny moments.  B
