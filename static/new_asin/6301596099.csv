7814128,5,6301596099,"Ok, so my friends and I wanted to have a ""Ninja Movie Madness"" night, so we go to the rental store and pick out pretty much all of the ninja movies they had. This one looked really awesome *hehe* because of the cool foiled cover, so we watched it first. It appears that they took to completely unrelated ninja movies, and spliced them together to create... gasp! One ninja movie with two separate stories that don't coincide at all! This is probably one of the funniest movies I have ever seen and it had me laughing from the first minute to the end. From the amazingly remastered redubbed speech (""I'd like some buns... to go."") to the awesome fight seens and special effects, this movie has it all. A must see. It makes Steven Speilburg look like a child in the backyard with his father's camcorder.",1152144000,,801,4.493150684931507
7814129,5,6301596099,"Ok, to start things off this movie is a definite 5 for those of you  who are looking for bad movies that are funny in a camp sort of way.  Everything about this movies is absurd, from the one white 'ninja' who is a ninja but hes slow and just shoots other ninjas with a gun, deep down there is something so wrong but so funny about shooting a ninja with a gun.  And lets not forget the actual ninjas, like one scene where a bunch of them are rolling around on the ground slowly inching closer doing ninja-stunts only to be immediately 'dealt' with.

Bottom line its side splitting humor that doesn't know when to stop, and didn't even know it started.  And I really want to give away the ending because its so funny but I won't out of respect for the semi-plot that has been forced into this movie.",1098835200,2,798,4.223684210526316
