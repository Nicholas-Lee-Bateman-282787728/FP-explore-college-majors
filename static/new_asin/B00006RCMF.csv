1788617,4,B00006RCMF,"Lewis Carroll's ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" is one of my favorite books of all time and thus, it is hard for a movie adaptation to live up to my expectations; it has been done, though, and I'll explain later.  This particular animated version of ""Alice in Wonderland"" was produced by Jetlag Productions in 1995 and released to DVD in 2002 by Goodtimes Entertainment.  I've never been too pleased with the animated versions I've seen of ""Alice in Wonderland"", not even Walt Disney's 1953 classic, and unfortunately, Jetlag Productions' takes the cake as the worst I've seen so far and one of the studio's weakest titles.  Most animated films from Jetlag Productions have a balance between strengths and weaknesses, but sadly, ""Alice in Wonderland"" fits the category in which weaknesses outnumber its strengths.  The film is simplified to appeal to children's tastes, but I think they went overboard, as I doubt children will find the film entertaining enough.  The weak storyline moves along ungracefully and slowly, generating a lot of yawns from scene to scene, and the characters are not on screen long enough to be too memorable.  Even with its many weaknesses, the film has one or two good points, too.

Based on Lewis Carroll's timeless literary masterpiece, ""Alice in Wonderland"" follows the adventures of Alice.  Her story begins when she is sitting alongside the riverbank with her cat Dinah listening to an uninteresting history lecture from her older sister.  Just when she could not be any more tired of listening to passages from a book without pictures, a strange white rabbit with clothes and a pocket watch appears and seems to be in a great hurry.  Burning with curiosity, Alice follows the strange creature down its rabbit hole which turns out to be a deep tunnel leading, it seems, to the center of the earth.  When she reaches the bottom of the tunnel, Alice finds herself in a brand new world; Wonderland.  In this enchanting place, Alice discovers a tiny door leading to the most beautiful garden she had ever seen and thus begins a journey to find this beautiful place.  In her journey, Alice stumbles upon many strange creatures, all of which seem to be just plain mad.  Alice attends a mad tea party with the March Hare and the Mad Hatter, and plays a silly game of croquet against the fearful Red Queen.  When the poor Knave of Hearts is accused of stealing the queen's tarts and taking them quite away, Alice attends his trial and confidently, stands up against the unfair tyrant and her pack of playing card-warriors.  Discovering at the same time that the whole enchanting world of Wonderland was just the works of her wild imagination.

Once again, though the story is pretty much the same as with most other adaptations of ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"", this version really does lack much of the charm that made others so grand.  The film suffers from an artistic crisis; Jetlag Productions films have never been high on quality of background art and animation, but this is them at their worst.  Most of the drawn sceneries suffer from poor choice of color, though much of it might be due to an unbalance in the DVD's colors, but still, the coloring is anything but appealing.  Then there's the character design; once again, very poor.  The protagonist is very badly designed, especially her face.  She suffers from that typical eye design seen also in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jungle-Book/dp/B000069HPB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jungle Book</a>"" (1995).  The rest of the characters have too simplistic or awkward a design to be visually likeable.  The animation is not much worse than I've come to expect from this studio, but it still seems to be one of the weaker efforts.  Voice acting is also a problem here; the characters speak in a way in which it sounds like a kindergarten play, with little emotion and very unrealistically.  The same thirty-one voice actors from other Jetlag Productions films are listed in the credits, so of course, that means we're once again listening to the boring same voices from other films from the studio.  In fact, seeing Jetlag Productions' films dubbed in other languages usually improves their appeal altogether.  One thing I missed in this particular version of ""Alice in Wonderland"" is the moral; all other versions of the story I have seen resulted in some sort of lesson learned by Alice after her long journey.  For example, in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Walt-Disney-s-1953-version/dp/B0000TG9E2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Walt Disney's 1953 version</a>, Alice learns that too much curiosity can be a very bad thing and that it often leads to more trouble than one can handle.  In the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1988-Burbank-Films-Australia-version/dp/B00003CWIK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1988 Burbank Films Australia version</a>, Alice had been bored of reading her book, ""The Principals of Logical Calculus"" and arrived in Wonderland to search for the beautiful garden, only to wake up and discover the beautiful garden that was her very own, as well as appreciation for anything that was ""logical"".  Finally, in the wonderful&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1999-Hallmark-version/dp/B00000ICZA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1999 Hallmark version</a>, Alice learns to have confidence in herself, and to enjoy, not fear, the fun of performing .  There was nothing of the sort here, other than a few hints that curiosity was not a good leader.  On the bright side, there are a few cute sequences, such as the Mad Hatter's drawing scene.  The songs are rather nice, especially the first song, ""Anything Goes in Wonderland"", which opens, and closes, the film nicely with a soft melody and a catchy tune.  The second song, ""The Caucus Race"" plays during one of the most repetitive and completely dumb sequences in the film.  Finally, ""M is for Me"" is played during the Mad Hatter's drawing sequence of things ""that start with the letter M""; catchy, but not too great.  All things considered, Jetlag Productions' ""Alice in Wonderland"" may or may not be a hit with the children, but for Lewis Carroll's fans and older viewers, I recommend the other three versions I mentioned, especially the 1999 Hallmark version, which is my favorite film of all time.",1116720000,2,6421,5.340615690168819
1788618,3,B00006RCMF,"Similar, but more kid focused than the Disney version. And a bit closer to the actual book.

The Caucus race song drags on far too long however but my niece is usually glued to the screen during the Mad Hatter's coloring song.

This was done in an Asian lab and has the distinctive animation similar to Heathcliff and other afternoon cartoons.",1101427200,3,343,4.60655737704918
1788619,2,B00006RCMF,"I haven't seen any versions of ""Alice"" that match up with what is in my mind. Disney tried vewwy hard and it is a nice, clinical and somewhat sterile interpretation (with some early celebrity flavor in it, as we would see come to blossom in the 1960's with the movies from ""101 Dalmations"" on up). However, I am not reviewing that movie, nor THIS! I am putting in a teeny vote for the 1930's (1933, I think...or maybe '35) version, which had (actually, mebbe it was '36?) W.C. Fields, Cary Grant, and some udder people whose names X-Cape me as of this moment.
 After all, as the whole piece is highly dependent on rather dreamlike and nonsensical shtuff, I tawt I'd pass dis on to youse all.
Someone should make the 1930's version available on DVD or VHS. I stayed home from school in 1975 to watch this film because I had read so much about it in my books on Cary Grant and also WC Fields [plus some other starz! whoze namez! ezcape! me]). Ok, enough. Suffice to say, the 1930's version was pretty neat, and had many of the best special FX guys of the 30's working on it. Put in a vote for the early 1930's version to be released at least on DVD.

7972576,3,B00006RCMF,"This is one in a series of reviews that will eventually be posted for every Alice in Wonderland title available on Amazon. When the Tim Burton rendition of AIW with Johnny Depp was due out in 2010 I thought it might be a good time to go back and watch the benchmark Walt Disney production from 1951, which I saw -or assumed I saw- as a child. It was a chance to get reacquainted with the many varied characters from the story as sort of a warm up for the Burton film. Upon viewing the Disney classic I was astonished to realize that I had likely never seen more than a few clips (at most) of that beautifully rendered Alice in Wonderland. So much seemed brand new. Nor did I have a memory of ever seeing any other ""Alice"" production. Then I realized that I had never read the book! Wait a minute. Where then did my memory of the Alice story come from? The curiosity sparked by that question ultimately led me over the next two years to accumulate every version of Alice in Wonderland still in existence. Well over 40 by the way!

This general commentary continues over in the review sections for both the 1951 AIW production from Walt Disney (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland-Masterpiece-Edition/dp/B0000TG9E2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland (Masterpiece Edition)</a>) and the 2010 production starring Johnny Depp (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland/dp/B001HN694K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland</a>). As these are the two most well known Alice's, rather then attempt to add yet-another-review for those two films, it seemed like it might be a more fun use of the provided space to muse a bit on the popularity and remarkable longevity of the story spawned by Lewis Carroll in 1865, as well as to share with you a bit of what I picked up while watching these 40 or so renderings of Alice in Wonderland. All other Alice productions listed by Amazon have a specific review for that title.

Review of this 1995 production of Alice in Wonderland...
This is a cartoon animation of Alice in Wonderland voiced by Toni Ail. This is a great cartoon to play for kids who you want to indoctrinate toward the ""real"" Alice, and it's also a great adult version as well... for a couple of reasons. First, this is the very first Alice story I've seen so far (film or cartoon) that includes the Pigeon and the Serpent passage. If you haven't read the book you might not even know that Alice grows extra extra tall after eating the caterpillar's mushroom and encounters a pigeon in the trees who thinks that because of her loooong neck that Alice is a serpent bent on stealing the bird's eggs! Most video productions of Alice in Wonderland cut from the caterpillar segment right to the Duchess's house, skipping over the pigeon bit. So it's a plus to finally see it rendered. For some reason though this production chose to skip the segment at the Duchess's house. Go figure.

Still, there are many little touches that bring this cartoon into alignment with the book, such as the tiny door to the garden in the hall of doors being concealed by a curtain, and the garden being populated with water fountains, which is as described in the book. When they do depart from Lewis Carroll's descriptions they often do it a poignant way. One departure that made me stop and think was when Alice, pondering where the two sides of a round mushroom were (""One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter""), concluded the two sides were the top and bottom of the mushroom. That's not the way Carroll described it, but this Alice was definitely thinking outside the box. ;>

So this video and the Phillip Hinton production (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland-Nutech-Digital/dp/B00003CWIK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland (Nutech Digital)</a>), although they both receive mixed reviews, stick closer to the book than any of the other dozen or so cartoon versions of Alice in Wonderland I have taken in so far.

While on the subject I must mention one exceptional standout in the animated Alice genre; On my short list for the best way to introduce kids to Alice is a little gem from Cinematronics produced quite recently. These folks located a 1948 radio broadcast of Alice in Wonderland performed by singer Dinah Shore. They combined the recording with some unconventional but brilliant animation techniques and came up with a truly great cartoon Alice. You MUST see this one (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-In-Wonderland/dp/B002WNU0SU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice In Wonderland</a>).

As I work my way through the entire litany of Alice productions from 1903 onward, I am starting to realize that in spite of the dozens of attempts to bring Lewis Carroll's book to life, there is room for yet another version, because we have yet to see an animated feature that *fully* honors the book. It seems only in animation do we have a chance of fully realizing Wonderland as the book describes. We need a cartoon version for grownups!

By the way, I am excluding the Disney production in my comments regarding the animated versions because although the Disney version also gets panned for not sticking to the original book, it is a stand-alone masterpiece of animation that lives in a category unto itself. Also note I am referring to *cartoon* animation only. There are a few stop-motion animated versions of Alice in Wonderland that stand on their own as marvelous adaptations of Wonderland. Two examples of that genre would be the wonderful French-American production released around the same time as the Disney version (but completely different):&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland-1950/dp/B000IMVJDM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland (1950)</a>, and the dark and creepy (not for kids) version by animator Jan Svankmajer:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice/dp/6305779635/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice</a>.
