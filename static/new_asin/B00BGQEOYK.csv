8568303,5,B00BGQEOYK,"There are many DVDs currently available on Cheng Man-Ch'ing's 37 Move Tai Chi form. What makes this DVD different is that it includes instruction on Cheng Man-Ch'ing's version of Push Hands. I have not come across any other DVDs that provide instruction on this specific variation of Push Hands. Cheng Man-Ch'ing's Push Hands, like his form, though derived from Yang style, is different from Yang style. It's different in very specific ways. It's a different take on Tai Chi Chuan. Whether you agree or disagree with the changes that Cheng Man-Ch'ing made, if you want to understand his approach to Tai Chi Chuan, it's useful to understand not only his form, but his approach to Push Hands. Having the section on instruction in Cheng Man-Ch'ing's particular version of Push Hands is what makes this DVD really worthwhile among all the others that are available.",1437004800,,861,4.986111111111111
8568304,5,B00BGQEOYK,"A great videoc ompanion to Cheng Man Ching 37 steps short form as taught by Dr Chi Chiang Tao. It covers the short form but does not the include the long form as wrongly stated in product description.

It will be necessary to take instructions from a CMC taiji instructor or buy a book on CMC taiji such as books written in the same tradition by Cheng Man Ching or Toyo Koyabashi.",1401408000,2,380,4.277777777777778
