One of the best songs from this whole DVD was the ABC's, I loved how they gave this old song a new sound!  The woman singer has a beautifully clear singing voice, very lyrical.  Definately fun to sing and dance to and a nice change from the kid's songs/shows always blasted at us (love this but whew need a change once in awhile :)",1258156800,,491,4.126315789473685
8096860,5,B000CC45XE,"I got this DVD (with the other Tip Tap Top DVD, ""Family Songs"") froma friend. This is just great!

I have a 2 year old girl and 4 year old boy. Both were glued to the screen for the 40 minutes of the DVDs and asked for more...and more... and more!

The visuals are beautiful, with lots of great details. There are song clips where REAL children and adults sing and dance. There is great animation too!

And the best part is - it's educational! There's a great ABC song, based on body movements (""A is for Arm...B is for belly button etc etc!), a numbers song also about our bodies (couting body parts). This was a great innovative way for my little ones to learn both their ABC and their numbers AND at the same time move and gain awareness of their bodies!

We also loved the many activity songs - several hand songs (including a hilarious interactive hand song where the fingers ""turn"" into five kids with funny costumes!), the very fun ""jumping song"" and the bedtime ""two hands"".

This DVD is different, and will have you moving with your kids! I would say this is for kids staring at 18 months and going up to mid elementary school. Do not miss it, it's great!!!

I am buying several for Christmas. I am sure my kids' friends will love it, and the parents will know they are watching a ""good thing""!!",1132444800,2,1304,4.345679012345679
