1492001,2,B00005JKMQ,"So after waiting forever for this movie to hit Blu-Ray, I get momentarily excited only to see that this apparently isn't even the director's cut??!!  Come on, Sony, you can do better than that.  What's weirder is that this version is listed at 151 minutes, but the runtime for the original version is listed on multiple sources (including Amazon) as 157 minutes, with the director's cut at 165.  Did they take out 6 minutes of the original version for this release?  Oh well, maybe in another ten years they'll get it right.",1484784000,,524,4.663043478260869

1492639,1,B00005JKMQ,"This film is a reinterpretation of history. Ali was a great boxer, light on his feet, graceful, smart and, as he said, oh so many times, so pretty in a great era of his sport. He was a huckster who put bums on seats for boxing.  However, he was easily manipulated for political advantage, was a pawn of the Nation of Islam, and later regretted his abandonment of Malcolm X.  He was a separatist and never a civil rights advocate. The film fails to capture the charisma of the man and fails to explore his complexities.",1465516800,,518,4.385416666666667

1493016,5,B00005JKMQ,Awesome movie! Wil Smith is an exceptional actor,1421712000,,48,5.125
1493017,4,B00005JKMQ,"Ali is a biographical film that film tells the story of the boxer Muhammad Ali. The story features the following events:his capture of the heavyweight title from Sonny Liston;his conversion to Islam; criticism of the Vietnam War; banishment from boxing; his return to the ring against Joe Frazier in 1971;and when he won once again the heavyweight title by taking it by upsetting George Foreman in 1974.

When a filmmaker decides to make a film on Ali,who considers himself The Greatest,one must also expect the greatest film to be made about him. Unfortunately,it does not meet those standards. Despite the fact that Will Smith was able to capture the persona of The Greatest and willed himself to be Muhammad Ali,the script is far from being engaging. It is more concerned about details of the events of his life that it serves like a documentary rather than an entertaining film about the champ. Added to that,the viewer does not get to know the man more while watching it as the viewer is treated to a very long film more about the events that happened rather than the giving us the glimpse of the most charismatic boxer who had fun with his fame when he was the most known athlete of the world.",1421539200,,1199,4.682464454976303

1493086,2,B00005JKMQ,"As far as I remember, the fault of the movie doesn't go to Smith and cast. It falls on how inaccurate the fight scenes were(Rockyesque and fabricated). If you want ROCKY(or a boxer's counterpart), then make one up--based on the likeness of Ali and label it as that. Create opponents for it based on historic fighters without actually saying that. After all, old fighters did not(often) create the mold or destroy it. There's even ways around the likeness disputes in some cases: pay fighters that had similar styles and were not as good in order to use their likeness in your movie and slap their name in the credits(that would probably allow it to be done within budget, in all likelihood). So, It can happen--if that's what you want to do. But, If you want to make it about a real fighters life(biography-like), though, then the fighting scenes(if not original), should be accurate--probably impossible to get precise. I could get behind either style as long as they follow the rules by which it is governed by. If you're watching a great sport's biography, then the sports are the most important part. And not how well, but how accurate. 2 Stars out of 5--would be a 1, if the acting was worse.",1410393600,,1197,4.677725118483412

1493129,5,B00005JKMQ,"The Will Smith movie is as mediocre as a biopic can get.  I cannot recommend it in any way.  The one from the 70s starring Ali himself though!!!  Wow I love this movie!!!

To be clear, it's not very well made in the objective sense.  It's actually one of the most hamhanded movies I've ever seen.  This movie has the style and approach of a propaganda film, with every scene designed to either glorify some aspect of Ali or get us to sympathize with his hardships.  Right from the opening image, in which he trains to the lyrics ""I believe that children are our future.""

Adding to all of this is the fact that Ali is really not an actor... but does remain one of the most most hyper-charismatic people who ever lived. It creates this bizarre mishmash of styles that's hard to even describe.  I consider this film to be high camp, and yet I don't even watch at it with a laugh-at/derisive sort of attitude because of how much I do love Ali.  I actually get wrapped up in the propagandistic, hamhanded whirlwind, even while I'm aware of its presence!  And sorry for using the words ""propaganda"" and ""hamhanded"" so much, but those are the two most perfect possible words to describe this movie.  Well maybe a third, ""endearing.""  It really does work, in some strange, unexpected way.  In conclusion, if you like Ali and unintentionally surrealist cinema, you cannot do any better than this.",1387152000,,1388,4.566801619433198

Approximately 20 minutes of theatrical footage was removed, while 30 minutes of previously unseen footage was placed back in by Mann. If you like the boxer and were expecting Rocky action then you will be disappointed. This isn't exactly a linear story about Ali's life and rise to prominence. The focus is not on Ali's boxing matches but more about his personal life. I enjoyed it but found the narrative to be confusing at times.

I would however, like to purchase an edited version of the same film for educational purposes.

1493211,5,B00005JKMQ,"""My name is not Clay. Clay is the name of the people that owned my ancestors, and I no longer wanna be called by that slave name. I am Cassius X."" This was from Muhammad Ali when the reporters interviewed him in the movie. The title of this movie, ""Ali"" is the name of Muhammad Ali and it represented Ali as something different. In the movie, the name Muhammad Ali was emphasized a few times because of lot of people was calling Ali his former name, Cassius Clay. However Ali kept his pride as not using his old name and used his new Islam name Muhammad Ali, which was represented by the movie title. Muhammad has his own pride as an African American and he wasn't afraid of show it to America. Muhammad Ali was the greatest boxer in the history of mankind and his story was depicted through the movie ""Ali"". Ali was a 2001 American biographical film directed by Michael Mann. Will Smith played Muhammad Ali, and this story was from 1964 to 1974. The story features starts with the fight against Sonny Liston. Then it was the conversion to Islam and the criticism of the Vietnam War. Later, it was the banishment from boxing, returning to fight Joe Frazier and lastly reclaiming the title from George Foreman. In the movie, there were also discussions about the social and political upheaval in the United States, and it talked about Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr.

 In this story, it was mostly made out of accurate events from history. The story has accurate people and facts and it showed how America was like in the 1964-1974. This period was after the Civil Rights Movement and blacks were still searching for equality. Even though the Civil Rights Movement granted equality to the blacks, many of the whites were still not willing to accommodate. At the start of the film, there was Cassius Clay, Jr. (aka Muhammad Ali) running in the streets. The police were driving over saying, ""What u running from son"" and left laughing. We could see the racism from those words and the police jokes about blacks running away from something. Then later, Ali fought against Sonny Liston. The odds were against him because Sonny Liston at the time was the champion of the world. However Ali defeated him in the end and was crowned world champion. Next, more history was shown as Malcolm X were good friend with Ali. Ali joined the Nation of Islam and later was given the name Muhammad Ali. In the movie, it showed when Malcom and Ali were good friends and later they were separated because Malcolm left the Nation of Islam. Malcolm provided powerful words through the movie. ""For those of you who think that you came here today to hear us tell you, like these negro leaders do, that your time will just get better, that we shall overcome, someday, I say to you that you came to the wrong place. `Cause your times will never get better unless you make them better."" These were lines from Malcolm and it showed African American spirit through the movie.

 In the movie, it also showed part of the history of Malcolm X, it showed the assassination when he was about to make his speech. After Ali was champion, he was a popular figure and was dangerous to the white. Ali was Muslim and he shared the same believes as Malcolm. Afterwards, America wanted to recruit Ali in the army and Ali refused to join. Therefore America charged Ali for not joining the army and Ali lost his boxing license. During this case he said a very powerful line. ""I ain't draft-doggin'...I ain't burnin' no flag, and I ain't runnin' to Canada. I'm stayin' right here. You wanna send me to jail? Fine. You go right ahead. I've been in jail for 400 years. I can be there for four or five more. But I ain't goin' no 10,000 miles to help murder and kill other poor people. If I wanna die, I'll die right here right now, fightin' you, if I wanna die. You my enemy. Not no Chinese, no Vietcong, no Japanese. You my opposer when I want freedom. You my opposer when I want justice. You my opposer when I want equality. You want me to go somewhere and fight for you. You won't even stand up for me right here in America...for my rights and my religious beliefs. You wont' even stand up for me right here at home."" Ali said. This line was extremely powerful as it criticizes America and it shows racism. This was almost Ali's downfall as he loses almost all his money fighting for the court case and he has no job. Thankfully, he got a license in Atlanta for boxing and got to fight Joe Frasier, the new boxing champion. However he lost the fight, but he won the court case and started boxing again.

 Towards the end of the story, Ali needs to fight against George Foreman (nicknamed Rumble in the Jungle) to reclaim his title. This was his hardest challenge as Ali was already 32 years old. However, just like in history, Ali was the greatest and he defeated Foreman and was champion once again.

 Most of the story was based on real history and people around Ali were all historical figures. In the story, it talked about racism a lot. Ali was a symbol for the African Americans and he wasn't just a black guy that integrates to white society. Ali said, ""No, I'm definitely going to be the people's champion, but I just ain't goin be the champ the way you want me to be the champ. I'm a be the champ the way I wanna be."" Ali was independent and he was out of the system. He isn't going to be some normal boxing champion. He was going to be the exception. Other quote from the movie, ""Don't put no question to it, man. I done told you, I'm through fightin'. I got a much bigger contender, a much heavier opponent. I'm fightin' the entire US government."" This showed African American's enemies are the US government and racism was never over.

 In this story, it showed a lot of close people to Ali and they all represented different things. There were the three wives out of four shown in the movie for Ali and they all had something different. One of them represented the Jezebel caricature, she was Ali's first wife and she was open and was the typical type for Americans. One of the most important characters would be Drew Bundini Brown, Jamie Foxx acted him and he was a trainer for Ali. He wasn't shown too much in the movie, but he represented a typical black person. He swore a lot, drank a lot and even sold Ali's belt for money. He was the drunken black guy that couldn't be saved, but Ali still used him and they became good friends.

 This was a good movie as it depicts real history and Will Smith was good at being the character Muhammad Ali. It's a good movie for boxing fans as it showed some good scenes and it showed how America is. My favorite quote would be ""Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee"" from Muhammad Ali because he showed true dominance in boxing. He was the champion and everybody should watch it if you want an amazing film filled with history and the story of an amazing boxer.",1355011200,,6877,4.4362628661916075
1493270,4,B00005JKMQ,"Every new generation seems to know or care less about history and the significant events and personalities that shaped our time. Muhammad Ali is arguably a very important cultural icon not only because of his achievements as a Boxer, winning the heavy weight title three times, but also because of his perseverance to define himself and broadcast his personality in a time when American culture aimed to silence him. All these themes were presented in this film; presented very well. Will Smith proves to be a versatile and proficient actor. He is so effective that you forget that he is the Will Smith of the Fresh Prince of Bel Air, MIB, I Am Legend etc. In this film, you just see Muhammad Ali, the boxer, the personality, the human being.

The cinematography is exquisite and unlike any previous boxing movie. The fight scenes seems to be subdued in an effort to make it more realistic. The punches don't have the big hollywood, Rocky-ish sound effects and exaggerated blows that shock the whole arena. Albeit pivotal moments in the fights are presented in cinematic forms that have not been shown before.

Overall, it is a great film that presents not only Ali the great boxer but the real human being. Not to be mistaken as purely historical, the film is effective in prompting the young viewer outside the scope of the late sixties to learn more about the great Muhammad Ali.",1350864000,,1382,4.754166666666666
1493271,4,B00005JKMQ,"This movie starts as do most good fights, with Cassius Clay training, running and shadow boxing.  Cassius (Will Smith) is young, fast and strong but most of all cocky.  He even taunts the champion of the world at the weigh in.  Sonny Liston is mad and wants to teach him a lesson.

The movie shows the budding relationship between Cassius and Howard Cosell (John Voight).  Before the fight, Clay is calm and collected in the locker room.  You could have heard a pin drop as his focus is so intense.  He wants to show the world that he is the champion of a new generation of boxers.  The bookies say it will not last one round and Liston will win by KO.  Clay dances and floats and Liston can't even hardly touch him.  Clay warms up and they continue fighting after the bell ends the round.

Liston is the aggressor but Clay dances and begins to wear the champ out.  Clays' speed and accuracy with his punches begin to take a toll.  It is implied that Liston has something put onto his gloves and he rubs it into Clays' eyes.  Clay can't see and they tell him to get onto his bicycle. Clay is hurting as he can't see to fight and he is really struggling.  Clays' vision clears and his determination to be the champ brings him back into the fight.....

And so begins the saga of one of the most famous American athletes in modern times.  The movie covers Ali's life from his fighting career, his conversion to Islam and he changes his name to Mohammad Ali.  This is a great movie and Will Smith did a fabulous job portraying Ali but the film is just too long. The movie is 157 minutes long and if it had been cut to 120 it would have been a tighter and more action filled film.  Even despite the length it is a 4 star movie and it is worth seeing.

The movie Ali both represents the life of the greatest boxer alive Muhammad Ali and stings like a bee at the box office.

The performance by Will Smith in this film was very true to Muhammad Ali himself, and he captured the arrogance, and many personal characteristics of the great boxer in his rendition. The performances by the other supporting characters was also excellent as well, it was easy to The storyline is not as clear as it could have been. To me, many of the relationships that Ali had in the movie, seemed to appear out of the blue and could have had more explanation. The cinematography in this film is quite good, and uses many visual perspectives to tell the story.

  As a member of the Nation of Islam, one of the most important points of Ali's religious life was his conversion to Islam. The movie shows Elijah Muhammad naming Ali, and his encounters with the Nation of Islam. However, it doesn't delve very deeply into his devotion of Islam itself. Rather, it represents his self drive and arrogance as a boxer in great depth. He is shown throughout the movie repeating how he is not going to follow anybody else and is going to do it his own way. The most that is presented of Ali's faith is presented in his insistence to be called by his new Islamic name and not by his slave name, Cassius Clay.

  As said before, Will Smith does a worthy imitation of Muhammad Ali's speech patterns, although it may seem a bit exaggerated at times. His relationships with Howard Cosell, Malcom X, and Elijah Muhammad have also been represented with historical accuracy. Ali evaded the military draft, and this is shown in the movie as well, including actual quotes that he famously said. The pivotal points in his personal life and career are all covered, some more heavily than others. The fight scenes are quite accurate, especially the last scene in the movie where he fights George Foreman and employs the ""rope a dope"" method. Finally, the movie probes into his personal life several times with his several wives and children. It does so rather well, and captures their relationships closely as they happened in his own life. As it tries to be as true to the man himself, this movie is unlike many other docudramas which try to bend the truth to create suspense and drama.

  This movie is a well produced movie that encompasses the transformation of Ali from a young boxer into a household name around America and mirrors his life quite accurately. However, It can be a bit drawn out and the fact that it is very accurate to the man's history may make it seem a tad boring throughout many of it's scenes.",1332806400,,2631,4.588486140724947

The DVD could not have arrived at a better time, when Smokin' Joe Frazier, some said Ali's shadow, juz went RIP.
Do not watch it if you are looking for another instalment of the Rocky series. There is no scene of one-arm push ups nor running the Rocky steps up n down in front of Philidelphia museum.
Will smith ...looks a bit small size for a heavy weight champ tough.
The soundtrack is superb. Soul and RnB or whatever u called it. Beatles fans will be thrilled as the name is mentioned in one scene.
The black liberation movement, his women, conversion to Islam, his running-away, dodging, refusal, whatever u call it, from the Vietnam war drafting, his big mouth with ryhme, all are presented in the movie.
But somehow the movie ended rather abruptly with the fight with George Foreman.

1493277,1,B00005JKMQ,"I went in wanting it like this movie, I really did. For the record, I'm a white woman, and I really like the ""Rocky"" films. Having been assaulted by my former partner, I knew exactly how Stallone's character felt when he said ""the next morning's the worst,' and I can sure attest to that. I watched all six movies while locked into a hyperbaric chamber twenty times over the course of a month, from the metabolic holes in my head from the abuse on SPECT scan.., a very expensive month, too, since insurance paid for NONE of it. Which was well over 7,500. And I have good insurance! I was landed on my head by my hair onto a tile floor. You can see in the SPECTs right where I hit the floor. In answer to your question, no, they do the 'nice guy bit' until they think they have you, and then they start to turn on you in what starts out looking like 'just a bad day.'No abusive man goes out with a woman he wants to impress and calls here a horrible name at dinner on their first date, and slaps her in the face, it's more like the frog boiling to death in the gradually heated water. A frog won't sit in boiling water, he jumps out!

So, my personal experience correlates to the humble, nice guy in a bad spot--ie Rocky. Who if you'll notice gets his butt kicked by bigger and bigger guys in each film. I could relate to that, also. I can't stand arrogance, ""I'm the greatest"" never fails to bother me. Because it's naive, someone, especially in sports, will eventually win out over you. I didn't like this character. Arrogance doesn't seem to be a Muslim value, is it? Note in the second Rocky movie, Paulie suggests that if Adrian was acting up, knock her teeth out. Rocky says, ""Well, you know I kinda like her teeth where they are.' You never specifically hear an anti domestic abuse message in the movies.

I dislike movies where the sex is gratuitous, namely because it gives people the idea that you can use people and have no consequences, when that's not at all the case. I don't like when women are like Kleenex, disposable and replaceable. I got that from the trailer alone, and I wasn't looking forward to the movie for that.

Even in the later films when Rocky did the 'homeboy' thing, which struck me as odd, considering he's a white boy, and it's bizarrely out of place on someone who had to be 45 at the time of the movie. I put up with it, because there were some nice scenes, even as far gone as ""Rocky Balboa,' the scenes where they do the Adrian tour, and that he didn't just hop into bed with that girl. even the meat locker scene about the 'stuff in the basement' was interesting.

Part of why the character was an icon is because he gave a lot of people someone to emulate, and to look up to, which you sure don't get here. I wish you did. I was sincerely hoping for it. Remember, the original film was in 1976, when I was small, and the country needed someone to have as their hero.  Vietnam was just wrapping up, the muscle cars were pretty much gone, a casualty of combined astronomical gas prices, and insurance. We didn't have a heck of a lot to look forward to as a country.

 I wish this could have given us another icon or character to emulate and admire.

I love the Rocky films because I was sincerely hoping for that here, a sincere, honest man, just trying to do his best, who loved his wife sincerely, wasn't treating her like a stray dog you can kick as you choose (and I love dogs)  and wasn't cheating on her with every woman in sight, full of skeeze we don't really need to see. He couldn't even beat guys up as a 'collector.' Frankly, I hope we get a chance to someday see another character like that again. But then, it's only been 36 years!  Also, Burgess Meredeth was brilliant as the old trainer.

I only had those hope for this movie. I'm sorry I was disappointed.",1325376000,,3810,4.285118219749652
1493278,3,B00005JKMQ,"I've been fascinated by Muhammad Ali ever since I learned about way back in elementary school. And I love Will Smith! Thus I had high expectations for this movie, but sadly it couldn't live up to them.

The acting was fine, though. I also liked that there was so much included about his personal life, even though it wasn't the entire story. His relationships with a couple of women and his interactions with Malcolm X, as well as his choice not to fight in Vietnam and the consequences that followed were all documented in here, and fairly well at that. It's good that at the very least, this movie showed what Ali's life was like in the most dramatic years of his life.

But as you may be able to guess, this story wasn't inclusive, and I was left with all sorts of questions about what happened before and after this climactic time period in Ali's life. There wasn't anything about his childhood, much less how and why he became a boxer. It's as if the movie expects you to come into it already knowing what happened before.

The movie mainly focuses on his personal relationships, his religious identity, his issues with Vietnam, and his big fight in Zaire against Foreman. Even during some of these parts, his life is flashing so fast that I often had to rewind to figure what happened. Even though reading his biography afterwards helped me fill in the rest of the blanks, I shouldn't have had to do that. A biographical film is supposed to teach me most of what I want to know.

And even though I don't blame this on Will Smith, I think Ali's character was a bit stiff in the movie. He wasn't very likable, to be honest. I know I shouldn't expect him to be all smiles and hugs, as real people are not like that, but his irritability didn't make the movie any more appealing. I certainly hope the real Ali is not like that.",1312934400,,1829,4.4183976261127595

How could you not be, he was all over the TV, all of 3 channels at the time. And I saw him fight Spinks and Holmes, towards the end of his career. I did not know that he had been named by the Nation of Islam, and he did not make up the name Mahammad Ali.
  Who was Jamie Foxx trying to play in the movie? He wore a Jewish star, stated he was Jewish, but didn't seem to do anything? The movie tried to cover everything about Ali's life, that would take several movies I think, because his life was massive, they did a good attempt to show a small piece of it, however chaotic and veering on not making any sense.
  Cosell, played by Jon Voight, I thought was an excellent acting job and was quite impressed, but not perfect, yet must be hard to pull off. Talking about hard to pull off, Will Smith portrayal of Ali was a valiant effort of what must be a difficult part to play.

It wasn't.

I'll go ahead and get the good out of the way before I lay in to this film.

Will Smith is simply brilliant.  The material may not always give him the best to work with (why is it that Smith's films constantly fail him?) but he really works magic with what he is given.  From the mannerisms to the physicality to the voice to the sheer magnetic drive, Smith understands Ali and delivers a mesmerizing performance that never once feels like cheap mimicry.  He is creating a character for us, despite the obvious `factual' draw.  The rest of the cast is hit or miss (Voight is a miss, Foxx is a hit) but they don't really matter when you consider the fact that this is Smith's show.  I also (somewhat) appreciate Michael Mann's direction here.  There is a gritty realism that Mann brings to some of his films (`The Insider' is a perfect example of this), and he brings that here as well.  I appreciate that Mann is NOT trying to be Oliver Stone (thankfully) but he does at times find himself hindered in areas that feel very much like Stone-failures here, but overall I think that his sharp direction (while no where near as polished as his work in `Heat' or even `Collateral') helps elevate `Ali' in areas where it certainly needs a boost.

And then, there is the bad.

Like I kind of already mentioned, Mann's direction is not without its flaws.  I think it's more his vision than his actual direction, but he seems to get muddled in his own viewpoint.  The film, at times, meanders around without any real solidified purpose.  It just kind of hangs there.  In fact, the film takes quite some time even to start establishing character, which was a poor decision, and then when it does attempt to build on WHO and WHAT Ali was, it can get a little uneven and lazy.  What I love so much about biopics is that they can really flesh out the soul of someone you admire or at least harbor some interest in, but `Ali' comes off a tad scattered and unfocused to really do that.

In the end, `Ali' fails to really live up to the name.  It needed a sharper edit and a tighter script to deliver a swifter punch in order to make it really do the subject justice.  Smith is simply marvelous, and so one should see it for his engrossing performance, but don't expect this to deliver in a totally fulfilling sense.",1277164800,,2549,4.3559322033898304

1493357,5,B00005JKMQ,"Ali is a biopic directed by Michael Mann that successfully covers legendary boxing icon Muhammad Ali's benchmarks over a ten-year time frame. The film opens as Cassius Clay prepares for his fight against heavy weight titleholder Sonny Liston. `That man's so ugly, when he sweat... the sweat run backwards off his forehand just to stay away from his face.' The famous `Louisville Lip' opens up as Clay taunts his opponent during a press conference.
From that point on, there is no doubt that Will Smith did a brilliant job in portraying one of the greatest of all time: from the hard work Smith put in at the gym to look and move like Ali, to Smith's emulation of Ali's persona, Smith's talent and achievement is undeniable.
 Ali is set in the 1960s, a time of the struggle for civil rights and also a time of war. It is a docudrama that is faithful to historical context. It depicts Ali's at first brotherly relationship with Malcolm X, which slowly deteriorates as X drifts away from the Nation. It also boldly depicts Elijah Muhammad's blatant behavior towards his followers. Ali's wartime struggle is also successfully portrayed as the film dedicates a big part to show his three-year slump after he refuses to join the army on moral grounds.
 Some criticized Mann for taking `docudrama liberties' as he depicts the relationship between Ali and Howard Cosell more intimate than it really was and for assuming that Sonny Liston DID apply a substance on his gloves before his fight with Ali. But these are minor `Hollywood touches' that Mann uses to appeal to a wider audience and hardly cause a drag to the great picture.
 The only real disappointment of the movie is that it solely focuses on the `greatness' of Ali instead of telling a wholesome life story. It doesn't tell us how Cassius Clay grew up, learnt to box, and gradually made his transformation into Ali. The film also concludes after the `Rumble in the Jungle' fight between Ali and George Foreman; it doesn't deal with Ali's later life after catching Parkinson's.
 The power and inspiration of Ali is undisputable, and probably one of the most successful docudrama ever made. `Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee His hands can't hit what his eyes can't see.' No film about The Champ would ever come close to touching Ali.",1243900800,,2293,4.768261964735516
1493431,3,B00005JKMQ,"ALI is nothing but a playful punch. Telling the tale of the boxer, Muhammad Ali, the movie goes through his life, starting with the early matches before his rise to fame and struggles with keeping himself in the boxing game after joining the Nation of Islam, to his name change from Cassius Clay to Muhammad Ali, simultaneous romantic relationships, and refusal to join the Vietnam War. Though the film is accurate in the portrayal of events and the character of Ali and even delves into aspects of racism not explored in other films, ALI seems to have no clear single point of view or message about the titular character.
 Directed by Michael Mann, with Will Smith in the lead role, the movie starts off with Ali, then named Cassius Clay, training, followed by a match. Proceeding to cliche examples of African-American discrimination with shots of bus segregation and police targeting of blacks, the movie's development seems undirected indeed. Unexplained scenes of the Nation of Islam gathering and Malcolm X making speeches did not help in clearing up what was going on for the audience. It seems that this film had no direction from the get go.
 Only after an hour into the movie, do we get a taste of what Mann was trying to communicate from the start. After an onslaught of story exposition and character establishment, story development finally started, if in the least of the name. Ali starts to receive consequences for his constant flirtation and multiple relationships with women, and  a backlash for his abrupt name change from Cassius Clay to Muhammad Ali. His valued relationships start to fall apart, as arguments begin and marriages are divorced. The public is shocked by his name change, and even his fellow boxers refuse to call him by his new name, which causes violence from the champ, as he wants to be acknowledged as Muhammad Ali from now on. That said, this development still presents no clear point. At first sight, one may feel that the writers are trying to show that Ali is an overly emotional man, and one who cannot control his actions. But with his management of his boxing game and schedule, and his ability to beat others in the ring with an unemotional, calculating, and orthodox boxing style, one could say otherwise. The multitude of contradicting messages in this film, make the filmmakers' message unclear and befuddled.  There are also many scenes of dialogue with Ali, in which he is shown to sport a cold and un-rash attitude, which make his character undeveloped and lacking of a certain perspective. Another example of trying to keep true to history, is Ali's boxing style. While there is accuracy in showing Smith fighting with an orthodox style, due to the mundane-ness of it, being strategically timed jabs that wear the opponent down over time, contrast to powerful punches all over the place, mainstream audiences may feel that Ali is less of a champion than he really is. This historical realism brings down the emotional response of the audience. The filmmakers try to put in too much of the ""docu"" in docudrama, and seem to have forgotten that they had to make this logical as a story. Despite the many different facets of personality in a person, due to the film being a story, they should have explored one main aspect of Ali's character, and shown how it has affected his life. Smith's portrayal of the character is true to the real Champ, but it's historical realism bogs down the story, as it is more difficult to explore Ali's emotional journey. The events portrayed in this movie may be accurate, as is the attitude and character of Ali, but they don't communicate anything as a story.
 All in all, however, unless you're a fan of Will Smith, or are really interested in this period of time for blacks in America, you should not watch this film. The action scenes are boring, most of the time Ali's just talking and unrealistically flirting, and though it fleshes out some parts of the racism, it's not worth spending two and a half hours watching it for just that.",1243468800,,4025,4.785611510791367

Will Smith is eerily like Ali.  It's like Cassiuss Clay is playing himself.  I remember watching Clay fight in the Olympics and Smith has him down pat.  I'd admired Ali for being willing to go to prison for his convictions instead of fleeing to Canada like all the other bed-wetting, Mommas boys who opposed the War in Viet Nam.  Jon Voight is good as Howard Cosell, who was a nobody until he weaseled his way into Ali's  life.  I understand that Smith and Voight both received Academy Award nominations for their roles in this move.  I wonder how Smith ""bulked up"" for this role.

Highly recommended for fans of Will Smith, Jon Voight, boxing the way it use to be, and Cassius Clay, aka Mohammed Ali.

But that is indeed the case here. For those who grew up with him in mid-20th century America it is a nostalgic look back. For those too young to have known his life story this is a good primer of why many considered him one of the greatest athletics of all time and one why, friend or foe, considered him one hell of a man.

I am not now nor was I then a fight fan. The part of Ali's career that interests me is his fight against black oppression, as he saw it. That in his youth he took a black separatist course joining the Nation of Islam in reaction to the rampart racism in America and American sports is understandable if not strategically the way forward for black liberation. The scenes with Malcolm X, who acted as something of a mentor, are among the best in the film.

Ali was a man not only with a sports mission but a political mission. That became quite apparent when he, despite damage to his career and to his financial interests, refused to be inducted into the military during the Vietnam War period. His reasoning was simple-he had no quarrel with the Vietnamese. Many lesser figures, who now head the American government, were not nearly so forthright and skipped around the decisive political and moral event of the baby boomer generation. Hats off to Ali.

The script didn't seem to let you 'inside' the feelings of Ali, except for his tears when Malcomn X was assassinated.  This film made Bundini (Jamie Foxx) more real than Ali (Will Smith).  But all in all, very worthwhile watching.",1167264000,,393,4.6521739130434785
1493440,3,B00005JKMQ,"Mann's ""Ali"" isn't a masterpiece by any means, but the cinematic car crash I expected to see didn't happen either.  People like Spike Lee and those actually involved with Ali's life (Larry Holmes, Joe Frazier) have ripped this movie to pieces and the critics have ridiculed it mercilessly.

A lot of movies about national icons fail simply because they tackle figures that are larger than can be captured in the medium of film (Hoffa, The Doors, etc), and this is undeniably one of them--one of the more enjoyable ones, though.

Mario Van Peebles does his best, and I think pretty well, at playing Malcolm X, whose abandonment by Ali is shown very clearly in this film.

Will Smith is as good as he can be playing Muhammad Ali himself, and he captures that strange, childlike Southern tough guy voice damn near perfectly.  Jon Voight is just covered in makeup as Cosell; he's unrecognizable, and I'm surprised he didn't suffocate.  To give him any credit for his performance would be as meaningless as saying one of the monkeys in ""Planet of the Apes"" did a great job.

Even through the more labored, musically constipated scenes (Mann must have realized this couldn't be a success and tried to compensate by drowning some of it out with blues music of the period) are boring to the point of exhaustion--Ali running, Ali on the bus, Ali hearing that famous expression actually invented by him in Zaire (""Ali, bumaye!"") to the point where we want to tell the Africans to shut up--there's an honesty to this movie that took courage.

Mann does not cover up the warts of his subject.  Ali as womanizer, a confused young man who could be cruel at times, a man driven largely by unconscious impulses, all the unpleasant aspects of this enigmatic figure are here for everyone to see.  There is no hero worship here, which is surprising.

The boxing scenes are what I took serious issue with.  The gloves used by Ali and his opponents look like balloons, about 18 inches long, and the actual blows look so fake that they suggest aborted attempts at violent hugs rather than punches.  (The Jerry Quarry fight is the worst.  He just starts bleeding spontaneously after a few taps.)

This does show the heroic side of Ali, however whimsical, very well.  His refusal to fight in Vietnam even at the urges of the Nation of Islam is portrayed as what it was; a heroic act with dire, irreversible consequences.  Could you see Michael Jordan or Barry Bonds doing that if it meant losing money?  Probably not.  The courtroom scenes and Ali's stoic refusal to submit show the spiritual side of this gigantic and ill-fated man.

Personally, I was glad that Mann stopped with Ali's last moment of real magic, the knockout of the ferocious George Foreman.  I wouldn't doubt that this is what Ali wanted and I wouldn't want to seem them stuff Smith's cheeks and making him look like the cadaverous shell of himself that he was getting beaten on by bums like Trevor Berbick.

This is worth watching as a primer on Ali's life and an exciting movie.",1160006400,,3025,4.6893939393939394

So why ruin Ali's reputation over the making of this piece of trash in return for a quick buck.  Missed being treacherous on a Judas scale by a fine hair.  Couldn't even mention that Muhammad was so good-hearted, how could anyone ask him to kill anybody!  So F^^K the movie, S^^K Me Director, & DUCK Me Actor",1137456000,,781,4.630434782608695

There's nothing wrong with the performances. Will Smith is fine; sometimes his resemblance to Ali is almost creepy. But, beyond depth, the movie lacks connective tissue. It's one damn thing after another. You don't feel a why behind anything. Ali becomes a fighter. Why? He converts to Islam. Why? Etc.

  Muhammad Ali (Will Smith) 'ALI'

'ALI',Micheal Mann's biography on the ledgendary Muhammad Ali, is both a success and a failure,it just depends on what you look for in it. Those wanting to know more about the boxing icon (usually the very reason we devote our time to biopic films),will be left sorely dissapointed. However,this film should not be approached as an examination of the man behind the great image(Will Smith's mesmerising performance is more impersonation than character study)or even as an old fashioned sports movie.
Instead Mann concentrates more on how one man and his achievments,his charisma,beliefs and ultimatly,his flaws,can uplift and give hope to his generation.
Mann has settled to recreate the turbulent times as a backdrop for Ali's accomplishments  and does so admiringly well.
Featuring classy performances from Jamie Foxx and Jon Voight,and other great cast choices that recreate fittingly the people associated with Classius Clay and his world.
This is a Mann movie from the very start,combining beautiful and controlled cinematography with a truly special soundtrack to make for some wonderfully effective moments,both in and out of the ring.",1131235200,,1590,5.19921875

1493495,5,B00005JKMQ,"Watching this DVD I thought, why did Cassius Clay / Muhammad Ali refuse to emigrate to Canada or anywhere else (Monaco, Paris, London, Rome, Cairo, Beirut), starting his statements living there in luxury? Isn't it neurotic to stay in the USA and allow the US white establishment to ruin my own sources (financially and mentally)? In the heart of all considerations is Ali's refusal to be drafted into the Army. His favorite sentences: (1) ""Why should I go to Vietnam killing people who never said NIGGER to me?"" (2) ""The USA is my enemy, not the Vietcong..."" these sentences, sent from abroad, would have developed their power as well, would have been a more effective support of his ""boxing for justice and liberty"" with shaky methods. And secondly I thought, watching this DVD: ""The Clash Of Civilizations"", the present never ending feud between Christian establishment and Muslim neighborhoods - did this start in the 1960's, when Muhammad Ali and America's fiery civil-rights leader Malcolm X became great political heroes? Nowadays: Ain't there any ways to respect each other? Is the present society a better one as the scene in the years 1964 - 1974, which brought Muhammad Ali a very bitter life? The fresh occurrence of this screen-work made me think like this, and I am convinced, some other viewers will feel similar things. But: Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. were gunned down, Muhammad Ali still is a living hero you can grant some honors (summer 1996 in Atlanta, the Champ holding the Olympic torch); evident: something of his style has been the right method ...",1122681600,,1581,4.902985074626866

Will Smith probably made a good Ali but to be true I thought he was boring and loud at all the wrong times. There's a fiest of bad actors in this movie and there's nothing really to talk about. I'm a Will Smith fan but this movie only made me a little confused with what I saw. It gets a bit too political somewhere in the middle and the final result of it is an overly preachy film. Watch it if you told yourself you had to do so. Don't buy it. Buy cheap bubble game but avoid buying at all costs or situations.

1493578,3,B00005JKMQ,"The opening ten-minute sequence of ALI is visually and emotionally stunning: we are treated to a classic scene of Cassius Clay out training for a fight while images flash of the history and time period, all set to music.  Like other reviewers, while the film does not (and cannot) maintain the intensity and glory of this opening sequence, ALI is still a film that delivers on several levels.  First of all, I believe the acting deserves special notice.  Will Smith outdoes himself in this film and proved to me, once again, that he has more talent than I give him credit for.  His performance as the film's protagonist is moving and charged.  Smith has mastered ""the voice"" and continues to assault the camera and those around him with its dangerous ammunition.  On top of Smith's performance, the entire cast seems to be on fire in this film.  Jamie Foxx, one of the most talented actors working right now, delivers a strange and effective performance.

But while ALI manages to be an effective film, I was left wondering many of the questions that have plagued other reviewers: Why is he like this?  What is the deep-seeded reason for this maddening ten years?  While Smith manages to give us a wonderful recreation of Ali's public self, we fail to glimpse the inner emotion of the man.  Of course, there IS some depth to the character.  While the film spends much of its time glamorizing the man, Ali's improper decision making and moral confusion do detract from his character.  We are not given a flat superhero to watch for almost three hours.  But that being said, the film does fail to convey a real sense of why he is the way he is, of what is driving him.  I do not believe it is Smith's fault: I think the film lacks the necessary depth and complexity to answer these questions.

Despite its flaws, ALI is still worth a look.  It captures the time period and its political tension better than many other films and Smith's performance as Ali is just as snappy, witty, and volatile as the original.",1113868800,,2008,4.6112676056338024
1493579,3,B00005JKMQ,"Well, I guess this movie was okay. Definitely not among one of my favorite movies featuring Will Smith, but worth checking out just to learn about the life of the legendary boxer.",1113868800,,179,4.625
1493580,3,B00005JKMQ,"All summer, as I experienced one dreadful film after another, I developed a mantra to get me through. ""New films by Scorcese, Mann, Darabont, Crowe and the ""Rushmore"" guys are due before the end of the year. How bad could the year be?"" Well, Miramax, in their infinite wisdom, delayed Scorcese's ""Gangs of New York"". Apparently, they were concerned about the public's reaction to a film set in 19th Century New York after the attacks of September 11. Presumably, they are using the extra time to use computers to erase any shots of the World Trade Center. That left four films to anticipate and hope for. A 50% batting average is pretty bad. ""The Royal Tennenbaums"" is a great film. ""The Majestic"" is a very good film. Hmmm. That leaves the Cameron Crowe and Michael Mann films. Both filmmakers have created some of my favorite films of all time. So it is extremely disappointing to have the experience of watching Mann's ""Ali"", starring Will Smith.

""Ali"" tells the story of Muhammad Ali (Will Smith) from 1964 until the famous Rumble In The Jungle. It seems to be a faithful visual recreation of the important events, but this is merely the frosting on the cake. What we don't get is the cake. The poster tagline is ""Forget everything you know"". Well, I don't know that much about his life, but I knew most of what was depicted. What wasn't depicted very successfully was `Why?'. The area the film depicts very well is Ali's struggle with religion. A brief flashback depicts his mixed feelings about his father's (Giancarlo Esposito) religion. This coupled with his feelings about race and the struggle of the African American man leads him to Malcolm X (Mario Van Pebbles) and the Muslim religion. Some of the film depicts their relationship, but then Ali seems to make a very conscious decision, yet the decision isn't depicted or explained. During the course of the film, Ali falls in love with three women, yet the moment when each relationship ends is not explained very well or very carefully. Most of the relationships in the film are handled in a fairly short-handed manner. We find out how they met, but the end of the relationship is left in the dark. Other relationships are just there and we really don't get an idea of how they met Ali or why the relationship continues. For instance, Ali's trainer Angelo Dundee (Ron Silver) is his trainer throughout the course of the story, but why? Howard Bingham (Jeffrey Wright), a photographer, appears to be at every event depicted in the film, snapping photographs. Each of these characters is really flat. Neither is developed and only seems to serve as background. Drew ""Bundini"" Brown (Jamie Foxx) appears to have been Ali's main supporter during his rise, yet, again, I have to ask `Why?' All of these questions are all the more shocking when you consider the filmmaker. Michael Mann directed ""Heat"", a great crime epic, starring DeNiro and Pacino. In ""Heat"" every single supporting character had a backstory which was explored, giving the film a rich texture.

Will Smith clearly spent a lot of time and effort trying to develop his performance as Ali and he does a good job. He is emotional, bombastic, intelligent and motivated. All qualities that I would imagine the real Ali has in spades. But without the direction and the story to complement him, the performance lacks a large element. Why is he like this? What made him like this? We don't ever really find out. A little bit about his life is revealed in his relationship with Malcolm X and the Muslim religion, a little of his struggle with the US and his draft notice. What is lacking is any of the motivation behind his training and his rise to the top.

Technically, the film is very good. The film opens with a montage depicting Ali training at the gym as he remembers two key moments in his life. The editing work is good and reveals some of the depth of his character. As the film progresses, the shaky handheld camera work used so consistently becomes annoying and detracts from the film. Meant to evoke a documentary, it robs the film of grandeur and style.

Most annoyingly, we really learn nothing about what made Ali a great athlete. We don't see how he trained differently, how he fought differently, anything.

""Ali"" really is a disappointing film that did little to illuminate the life of a great athlete.",1113264000,,4339,4.734126984126984
1493581,1,B00005JKMQ,"Will Smith proved to be spiritually lost when he appeared on Oprah to promote his ""ALI"" movie.  He told the audience that there were more books written about Muhammed Ali than Jesus.  Hey Will, First let me tell you that Jesus only put out one book, ""The Bible"" and second EVERY knee will bow (Romans 14:11) and call Jesus Lord, not Muhammed Ali.  One more thing, if Ali is so great then why did your movie BOMB at the Box Office while ""The Passion of the Christ"" broke records?  I guess you were mistaken about who people are more interested in.  Can Muhammed Ali save you from your sins?  Maybe instead of doing a movie called ""I Robot"" you can do one called ""I REPENT.""

1493583,4,B00005JKMQ,"The ad campaign for ""Ali"" focused on Will Smith's Oscar nominated portrayal of Muhammed Ali, but in the end I found this to really be director Michael Mann's film. Like ""The Last of the Mohicans,"" this is also a film where the leading man looks intently while the music surges. Mann has always been enamored of letting music carry a moment (first evidenced by his use of ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"" for the climatic scene of ""Manhunter"") and ""Ali"" is certainly no exception. The film begins with a montage of Cassius Clay out running as part of his training for his first title fight with Sonny Liston mixed with images of formative influences on Clay growing up and Sam Cooke (David Elliott) performing in a Harlem nightclub. Unfortunately, the film never reaches this high initial peak again during the rest of the film.

""Ali"" is not a traditional biopic in that those who know little about the champ's life are not going to understand what is going on. The strategy of mouthing off at every opportunity to convince Liston that the young Cassius Clay was psychotic or the ""rope a dope"" tactic that Ali used to defeat George Foreman (Charles Shufford), are implicit at best. In this regard the film clearly works better with those who know enough of Ali's life to fill in the pieces (the scene where Ali ane Joe Frazier (James Toney) drive around in a car together planning their first fight was one of the film's few revelations for me). Mann creates something of a patterned mosaic, where there are fights, women, and interviews with Howard Cosell (Jon Voight), while Malcolm X (Mario Van Peebles) and Martin Luther King, Jr. are gunned down. What cuts through this is Ali's refusal to be drafted into the Army to go and fight in Vietnam. At the end of the film as Ali trains for the ""Rumble in Jungle"" his run through the streets of Zaire reprises the opening but the repetition rings hollow.

There are scenes where Smith gets to spout off some of Ali's wonderful rants, but it is clearly established that this is not the ""real"" Ali. The moments in the film when we think we glimpse the real man are, paradoxically, not those in which he is talking but those in which he is quiet, his eyes taking in the world around him and leaving it to us to figure out what is going on in his mind. If there is any moment in the film where Ali is laid bared it is when he is punishing Ernie Terrell (Alfred Cole) for having called him Clay: Ali refuses to finish his opponent off, hitting Terrell again and again, repeatedly shouting ""What's my name?""

I also want to take Mann to task for having reduced the first fight with Frazier to the end of the fight, choosing to omit the shocking image of Ali on the canvas, wearing those shoes with the tassels. Especially since this is a film that takes the time to give the audience a sense in the final fight of how long Ali let Foreman pound on him against the ropes, waiting for the right moment. Fortunately, a lot of the film's faults are covered by Smith's performance, which has been deservedly praised for avoiding the pitfalls of caricature. Ali's legion of fans will enjoy this film more than others, but in the end ""Ali"" falls short of being as epic as the man himself.",1097020800,,3211,4.5327586206896555
1493584,5,B00005JKMQ,"Ali - The Director's Cut, takes about 20 or so minutes out of the original movie and adds about 28 minutes of new footage back into the movie. According to Michael Mann, both versions are truly director's cuts, and this one simply emphasizes the politics a bit more. This is what a director's cut should be. A true redo of the movie, not adding in an extended scene or two to get an ""unrated"" DVD to sell more.
Will Smith gives an incredibly powerful performance as Cassius Clay, aka Muhammed Ali. Mario Van Peebles does a great job as Malcom X, and Jamie Foxx is wonderful as Bundini.  The movie shows how Ali was manipulated by his management, but also how he stuck to his beliefs.
Will Smith delivers the line so convincingly, it's amazingly powerful and heartfelt. Not only the lines, but Will also took real punches in the movie. They hired professional boxers to play Frazier, Sonny Liston, and and George Foreman, who were allowed to throw real punches at Will but stop at incapacitating him. The realism shows in the boxing scenes. The movie ends at the Rumble in the Jungle, an excellent place to end the story of Ali. We all know the sadness that followed later in life, but there's no need to go into it in the movie.
If you enjoyed the original version of Ali, definitely check it out.",1089590400,,1297,4.495762711864407
1493585,5,B00005JKMQ,"When Ali was released in 2001 it received decidedly mixed reviews. While Will Smith was praised for his impressive physical transformation into legendary boxer Muhammed Ali, the film itself was criticized for revealing nothing new about the man. Herein lies the problem that Michael Mann and company faced: how do you shed new light on one of the most documented historical figures of the 20th Century? Like he did with The Last of the Mohicans, Mann has revisited Ali again on DVD with a new cut of the film. He's taken out approximately 20 minutes of footage and put 30 minutes of previously unseen footage back in. The effect? Hard to tell unless you've seen the film many times but Mann claims that the politics of the times are more the focus this time around.
There is an audio commentary by writer/director Michael Mann. He does an excellent job of putting the film into its historical context. The director clearly did his homework and points out who everyone is and the significance of the events depicted in the movie which is a nice consideration for viewers not familiar with this particular period of time. This is an extremely informative track and Mann contributes many very thoughtful observations over the course of the movie.
""The Making of Ali"" is a 29-minute featurette that originally aired on HBO. It is slightly better than your average electronic press kit and features some decent on the set footage and interview sound bites with Mann and various members of the cast.
Ali eschews the traditional docudrama for a more impressionistic take on the man and life. Mann's film may not say anything new about the famous boxer, but it does depict an exciting ten years of his life in a masterful and richly evocative fashion. This DVD features an excellent transfer of the movie with an aggressive 5.1 surround soundtrack and is definitely worth purchasing for Mann fans for his audio commentary alone.",1086566400,,1920,4.8567073170731705
1493586,1,B00005JKMQ,"""Ali"" is the attempted biographical movie
on Muhammed Ali's life, through the eyes
of Michael Mann (Miami Vice).
Although, I liked ""Ali"" for the most the part,
there were some problems with the film, that
prevented from me calling it a good film.
First of, the acting for most of the film is
badly acted, started with the major star
Will Smith who acts as Ali. Smith
is not convincing as the legendary champion,
he delivers his lines basically without
any emotion or comprehension of what he is saying
with the only exception being when Smith recites
the famous lines by Ali such as ""I am King
of World. Sting like a butterfly float a bee"".
The only real good points about Ali is that it
does show 3 factual things about the real
Ali. For instance, how Ali's real is Cassius
Clay, but after he joined the nation of Islam
and Malcom X. He changed his named to Cassius X.
Then after meeting the head of Islam,
Elijah, Muhammed, he changed
his name to Muhammed Ali.
Some people called it a landmark film, but it's
not. Some people even said that ""Ali"" showed
Ali as a great civil rights leader, but it didn't
do that either.
For instance , although ""Ali"" was friends
with both Malcolm X and Martin Luther King,
he had only brief contact with them.
Also was not totally supportive of Malcolm X
(played well by Mario Van Peebles)
. Ali's manipulation by the nation of Islam and it's leader, drove a wedge between the friendship between Ali and Malcolm X.
The film also shows how Ali was a contracting
young man and older man. For instance,
his mistreatment of his wife Sonji ( Jada Pinkett)
after he follows the rule of Islam to discipline her.
Now I as I said the acting in the film is
really bad. Will Smith, probably didn't do
alot of research into the character of Ali, as
his lack of any feeling into some of the
serious areas of the movie (like his
reaction to civil riots ,Malcolm X and the
threat of him going to prison for avoiding
the draft).
I mean Smith does an ok job, when imitating
the famous lines by Ali such as ""Float like
a butterfly sting like a bee"", or ""I am King
of The World"". But when it comes down to
delivering real, reactions for Ali, Smith
is both laughable and mediocre.
For instance, there is a scene where Ali (Smith)
sees the trouble of civil rights on tv, and
yet his reaction is just something like ""Wow,
or uh oh"". LOL Then later on in the movie, when
Ali is threatened with imprisonment for refusing
to fight in the Vietnam War (yes he refused to fight), he basically just looks stonefaced, and
doesn't have the serious type of reaction you
would expect someone going to prison would have.
However, there are a couple of good actors in the
movie (not Smith)
that prevents ""Ali"" from being
a total failure .
Jon Voight is great as legendary, ego maniac,
sports announcer Howard Cosell (who ended
his career in disgrace).
Cosell was one of the biggest sports
voices in history, he had memorable
interviews with Ali, sports team like
the Lakers and many other great sports
figures, but by the end of his career
Howard's ego got the best of him, and eventually no one wanted to see this guy
on the air.
Mario Van Peebles as Malcolm X, also deserves
some honorable mention as he does get into
Malcolm X characters, and his view on the
civil rights movement, and some of his
problems with Ali.
The other big complaints about the film was
that the film concentrated on the early
life of Ali, but not his life afterwards in
the 1980's, as critc Roger Ebert states.
Now the DVD for the film, like the film is a bit
of a disappointment:
The only bonus feature for the film is
the trailer.
There is no behind the scenes look at the film, no
""making of"" featurette, no nothing.
There is not even no commentary for the film!!!
Michael Mann either was too busy,
or too damn lazy to do the commentary, because it would have given him the chance to respond
to the criticism for this part of the film,
instead he chose not to do any commentary
for the film and so the criticism
for the film will stand.
In the end, while Michael Mann tried to do a fair
attempt at the making of ""Ali"" there are alot
of problems that prevent him from doing so.
First, of, his main star , Will Smith, is just
plain awful as ""Ali"" . Smith, probably got
paid his millions for the film, but he ain't
worth it.
Second, Mann, only covers the early years, and not
the later years for the legend, when he would take
beatings in the ring, and would later get
Parkinson's disease, which would leave Ali
partially paralyzed and barely to speak (Ali
speaks in mumbles).
In the end, I can't recommend ""Ali"" because
it just basically could have been a heck of alot
better, and the dvd without the commentary , just
basically sums up the film as basically an average
attempt at creating a biography for the heavyweight
champion.
The bright side, is that there is a new film/dvd
which is a real biography on Ali, showing actual
interviews and clips of the real Ali, so you're
better of checking that one out than this movie.",1083369600,,5005,4.388589881593111
1493656,4,B00005JKMQ,"Not being a boxing fan, but having had watched When we were Kings, I had a rough idea of who Ali was and what he had achieved during his career. I heard about Will Smith's role in Ali so decided to watch this as well.
You have to give credit to Will Smith for the accent,and the swaggering, overconfident 'Ali-ness' that he carried off so well. What interested me the most about this movie was Ali's contact with the black muslims and particularly Malcolm X. It was interesting to watch these two giants of the Civil Rights era come together in a time when the struggle for minority rights was the fiercest.
Ali's struggles after he had lost his right to box made me realize the power that Government has over the people within it's territory, but it also shows how hope can overcome what appear to be insurmountable obstacles. This was the saddest part of the film, and I think it made for good drama.
Despite Ali's magnificence in the boxing ring, he was a flawed man. His promiscuity makes a mockery of his religion and his weak excuses made me realize just how limited certain men are in carrying over the discipline from public life into the private.
I highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in the life of Muhammad Ali.",1081900800,,1235,4.517857142857143
1493657,2,B00005JKMQ,"If you have a choice between the documentary - ""When We Were Kings"" and ""Ali"" pick up ""When We Where Kings"" and then watch ""Ali"" after for Will Smith's performance alone who was up against Denzel Washington for an Oscar in 2001. Sometimes Will Smith even looks better than the real Ali in ""When We Where Kings""!
Maybe if Ali had been a better movie Smith would have zipped past Denzel but unfortunately the movie is sadly very undernourished on the story front and feels very dull for a man of such stature. This is coming from a director too who is just well under par in this opus. Everything is here! - The fights, the family, the troubles, the controversy, the sets, the era and the players, but what it is missing is the element of hope, achievement, despair, loss, anger, happiness, punishment and every other emotional wallop that you would expect from a character with a biography to die for. The actors all carry and show these emotions but this film does not for some strange reason. It feels that the acting is too distant, far away, not-tangible and ultimate impossible to relate anything much too. You can not seem to find anything about yourself or your roots to bring to the film. There is also thus extremely very little that you can take away with you from it. It makes for a film that has everything on form, strike that! - Oscar winning form - but never seems to want to be entertainment or an art form or much of a motion picture film.
It is very hard to put your finger on what makes this film unmemorable. It certainly does not lack substance or drama but it just resides in a detachment of its own narrative which at times may be a bit too convoluted even though the film has nearly a three hour running time. The audience's disengagement can probably be found in Mann's misdirection of the moments in time that jump years but because the character in the last scene is in the next scene it leaves you feeling quite frankly - confused. In fact this type of mystification does reign throughout the movie. You are unsure if Ali is five years older or ten years older. You do not know what has happened to him in-between and the next scene could be five years ahead yet again or the next hour for all you know. Mann never does fix things down for us and so Ali's story remains scattered across the screen.
See for it Will Smith though. He does an excellent rendition of the greatest boxer of all time. You can barely recognize him on the screen. He is pumped up to Arnie-like sizes.",1074038400,,2502,4.417748917748917
1493658,2,B00005JKMQ,"I love Michael Mann and almost all his other movies. His class as a director is obvious in Ali too, the visual play at work is phenomenal, but the movie is too long and winding a potrait of what could have been an interesting character. We hit that spot with a press conference sequence, and perhaps a couple of bouts or so, but overall the movie is a bore.
To begin, Will Smith is a top actor and you can see him doing his best here, but ultimately one wonder if he was the right man to bring the kind of pizzazz and intensity that Denzel Washington carried in The Hurricane. And to think that Ali is a more prominent boxer.
When one watches a biopic, it would be reasonable to want to come out of the theatre having some clarity on how the person's life progressed, what his personality was like and so on. Instead, I left with a feeling of ""What just happened"". The film lacks a smooth narrative, we patch and cut from one place to another. Jamie Foxx lends some of the human drama to the movie, but unfortunately at times when it was least required.
I happened to see the documentary ""When we were kings"" recently, and for boxing fans that is a must-watch for the last bout between Foreman and Ali. That pretty much sums up my regard for this lacklustre movie from an otherwise magnum director.",1070668800,,1298,4.345679012345679
1493659,4,B00005JKMQ,"I saw the movie because I love Muhammad Ali. I used to clip the articles about his fights out of the Washington Post when I was a little girl 9 and 10 years old. I even used to watch his cartoon show. So I'm not going to pretend to be Leonard Maltin and talk about film techniques and angles and crap like that which I don't care about anyway. I'm going to try to describe what I liked about it.
To consider who would like this movie besides me, I would say that fans would have enjoyed seeing Muhammad Ali on the big screen. I, of course, remember him from the little screen, and if I had bought this VHS version instead of seeing it on the big screen, frankly I don't think I would have felt the power in all his punches like I did in the movie theatre. It was awesome, as I were the one being hit (not that I'd enjoy that)! Apartment dwellers like me who can't have high volume surround sound would truly miss out.
I liked the story. I remember seeing the story of Emmitt Till in the Jet magazine, too, and how repulsed I was as a young child. I can understand the anger he must have felt.
Then I wonder if white audiences will even get this movie. There's plenty that will be over their heads just from a cultural aspect. Are they going to understand why Ali was so moved to go to Africa, where they don't even have TV, and see his image drawn on the sides of houses and walls?
I really enjoyed the performances of the actors. I think someone besides Jada Smith should have been his first wife, but I guess if your husband's going to do a love scene, may as well keep him close. The make-up artist for the movie should have gotten a nomination for making Angelina Jolie's father, Jon Voight, look as if he had undergone major plastic surgery; it was truly amazing.
If the movie didn't play in your part of the world, I believe it's worth getting, although a better one which I'll recommend, is When We Were Kings. The DVDs to both would be better still if you can justify it, just because of the extra material that's likely to be on them.",1068595200,,2043,4.201017811704834
1493660,3,B00005JKMQ,"This uneven account of the life of Muhammad Ali (as played by Will Smith) has much to offer, even if it does not hang together as a whole.  In many ways, this film is too ambitious in its effort to touch upon many of the complexities of the renowned heavyweight boxer; the film tries to include too much and therefore doesn't fully explore any one aspect.  As a result, this film feels incomplete despite its length.  Will Smith does an admirable job evoking Ali's outward charm and unreadable emotions, but this public mask often obscures a more intimate exploration.  The film succeeds best in more private moments, one on one with other characters, although Will Smith's evocation of Ali's public rhyming is dead-on.  The documentation of some of Ali's personal struggles (many of which I was not previously aware of) are both moving and politically/socially charged.  At other points, scenes drag on as though the director could not decide when to stop.  The acting is good to exceptional, with no one glaringly miscast.
As a Will Smith fan, I could not pass up this film despite mixed reviews.  I'm glad I finally saw it.  However, I don't recommend it for everyone because of its numerous flaws.  If you are a Will Smith or Muhammad Ali fan, you should definitely see it.  Likewise, boxing and bioflick enthusiasts should enjoy it.  Skip this film if you don't fall into any of the preceding categories since there are many other (and better) films out there.",1064275200,,1465,4.76984126984127
1493661,3,B00005JKMQ,"Michael Mann's direction of the movie is all over the place.  The story doesn't give the whole story.  What about his beginnings in Louisville, Kentucky?  What was his motivation for joining the Nation of Islam?  Who are these women in Ali's life?  Don't get me wrong.  The performances were the best thing in this movie.  Preferrably from Will Smith, Jon Voight and Jamie Foxx.  You should be more inclinded to see the movie ""The Greatest"" which shows Muhammad Ali as himself.  And even though the champis stiff as an actor, the story is better represented.",1057449600,,558,4.7894736842105265
1493662,5,B00005JKMQ,"Will Smith playing Muhammad Ali?  Yes, indeed, and surprisingly enough, he does a fantastic job.  While he doesn't look too much like Ali, Will Smith bulked up and did a credible job in the ring as Ali (isn't film wonderful?).  Where Will Smith really shone was outside the ring, getting to perform as Ali the man.  It is in the human portrayal of Muhammad Ali that Will Smith disappears and we can believe that it truly is Ali himself.
Ali was directed by Michael Mann (The Insider, The Last of the Mohicans) and the movie has a slow, deliberate pacing that perfectly serves the film.  We get to savor the moments on screen instead of being rushed to the next bit of Ali spitting out beautiful dialogue in rhyme.  While it is equally as important to have Ali talking as it is to have him fighting, the scenes that linger a moment or two longer than one might expect help give the overall tone to the film.  The perfect example of this is the scene where Ali is dancing with the woman who would become his first wife.  The scene is perfectly captured, slowly dancing to the music and it really puts the emotion into the scene.  Holding the shot longer helped the scene and the movie.
The movie begins with young Cassius Clay preparing to fight Sonny Liston for the first time and for the championship.  The film follows his life and career through Ali winning the championship, marriages (plural), changing his name from Cassius Clay to Muhammad Ali, refusing the draft, the Ali-Frazier fight, and finally ends with the Rumble in the Jungle against George Foreman.
I don't know very much about the life of Muhammad Ali, so I can't comment on the accuracy of the film.  Without that knowledge, I can only judge ""Ali"" on its own merits.  This is a fine film with excellent performances (Jon Voight as Howard Cosell stands out, as does Will Smith) and is without question is worth watching.",1052697600,,1887,4.566765578635015
1493663,3,B00005JKMQ,"As expected from Michael Mann, the Director who brought us ""Last of the Mohicans"", ""Ali"" is a well-crafted movie.  Akin to a Swiss watch, the movie was chronicled with precision from Ali's rose to fame by beating Sonny Liston, his convergence into Islam, his estrangement from his father in particular for dumping the so-called slave name, Cassius Clay, his womanising attribute, his fall with Malcolm X, Ali's refusal to be drafted into the US Army, his close relationships with Cosell (Jon Voight), Howard Bingham (the person who took intimate photographs of him).  I would have liked to watch how he got into boxing at the first place due to his stolen bike & subsequently discovered by his trainer, his legendary fights with Joe Frasier, his fight with his Parkinson disease.  Maybe it's due to time constraint or maybe, the Director felt that it's best to depict Ali for overcoming his fear of losing by beating George Foreman in  Zaire.  Standing ovation to Will Smith for his individual performance.  If we were to watch the documentary of Muhammed Ali, you would have noticed that Will Smith WAS Ali.  The voice, the way he moved were commendable.  Having said that, the rest of the crew were in their best form yet.  As the movie critic summarised succinctly, a movie that worked if it's watched as it is, but faltered should it tried to explain Ali, the man that he is.",1051056000,,1379,4.760504201680672
1493664,3,B00005JKMQ,"Ali is a decent bio of Mohammad Ali's boxing career. Will Smith certainly elevates the performance of the film.  Its amusing to listen to Will imitate Ali as he talks trash before his big fights and to Howard Cossel.  Also the actor who portrays Howard Cossel does him good justice.
However, the story is a bit incomplete.  The story cuts right to the first Sonny Liston fight with little introduction on Ali's growing up period.  Than there is the focus on his dodging the draft and his spiritual role as a Muslim.  This is given decent emphasis.  Finally some coverage of his fights with Frazier, Quarry, and Foreman.  Somehow it would have been nice of the movie included some mention of the second and third fights with Frazier and even  Ali past his prime.
Nonetheless, the fight scenes are exciting and even in its limtied focus, the movie is good if not spectacular.",1050105600,,873,4.660130718954249
1493665,1,B00005JKMQ,"Word-of-mouth is true about this one.  This movie is a bummer.  It's just Will Smith playing Will Smith, but he almost had the voice down. But he would lose the voice occasionally. The fight scenes are uninteresting.  Will Smith looked as if he was scared of a stunt punch.  Unlike the real Muhammand Ali in those days.  Perhaps Laurence Fishburne should have been cast as Ali.  No magic or drama to this film.  I recommend the original film that Muhammand Ali made on his life story starring Muhammand Ali himself, THE GREATEST (1977).  Muhammand Ali was also good in FREEDOM ROAD (1979-TVM).",1049414400,,593,4.745098039215686
1493755,4,B00005JKMQ,"Muhammad Ali is surely one great character and his life undoubtedly renders a great movie script. When I found out ""Ali"" was going to be made, I was eager to see it from the first moment. After watching it yesterday, I was a little disappointed.
First of all, ""Ali"" covers only ten years of Muhammad's life. Sure, those were the ""best"" ten years in Ali's life, when he was at the top of his boxing career, when he converted to muslim religion, when he was a friend of Malcolm X's. But certainly, Ali's life is much more than that. Even if the movie is longer than 150 minutes, I was, at the end, feeling that there was something missing (and there really was). Another low point of the movie is Michael Mann's direction. After ""Heat"" and ""The insider"" (two movies I really enjoyed), he changed his style, and Ali's was a blend of Steven Soderbergh and Oliver Stone. Maybe Mann wanted his movie to be like a documentary, but that was not the point in ""Ali"" (there is already a tremendous documentary about Ali, called ""When we were kings"").
Now, the good parts: the producers worked hard and found actors that really resemble the fighters, specially George Foreman. Will Smith does not resemble Ali, but Smith does a competent job as the protagonist. Aside from his good acting, his leg and feet movements are impressibly close to what Ali did in the ring. I also have to mention Mario van Peebles as Malcolm X, Mykelti Williamson as Don King (funny) and John Voight as sports-anchor Howard Cosell. But the main award should go to Jamie Foxx as Ali's drug-addicted, priest-like jew companion Bundini Brown. Great performance.
Anyway, Ali was not what I expected. But it's an interesting movie about one of the greatest boxers, personalities and characters of the XX century.

This movie is amazing!!! And the recreation of the fight scenes are just magical, thanks to master director Michael Mann.
i'm very surpised of what a great actor will smith can be...it just about the roles!!..great acting all the way.

I didn't really appreciate the opening montage and this crosscutting with a SAM COOKE concert. I think that they wanted to show the emergence of black people in the sixties. I especially liked parts of the film like those funny press conferences in which ALI demonstrates his acting ability. If you actually accept what the script wants you to beleive,ALI is basically a womanizer. The religious aspect and the army jinks could not be tossed apart, simply because they really were an important issue at the time. Overall,this film should not mesmerize you to a degry of greatness. Still,WILL SMITH certainly trows knockout acting punches and makes it worth viewing.

1493758,3,B00005JKMQ,"In the words of Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando) in ""On The Waterfront"", this coulda been a contenda.
But somehow it falls short of its potential.
My main gripe with this film is what most people praise it for.
Will Smith.
I think Smith was somehow overwhelmed by this role. He doesn't deliver that witty repertoire like the man himself. His voice actually trails off a lot of the time. Listen carefully and you'll see what I mean. Likewise, that expression on his face...He looks perpetually scared! I know many will disagree with me, but I think Smith was the wrong choice to play Ali.
Michael Mann directed the excellent ""The Insider"" so I was expecting more from this film. It isn't really much more than a retrospective of part of Ali's career. And most people know this part of the story. Ali wins the heavyweight title, converts to Nation of Islam, befriends Howard Cosell, gets screwed by the system, comes back and beats Foreman. No surprises there.
I was REALLY hoping the film would have focused on the more interesting and tragic part of Ali's career that followed the fight in Zaire. You know, when he got older, fought Frazier in Manila, turned to Sunni Islam, lost and regained the title from Leon Spinks, got screwed over by Don King, came back to fight Larry Holmes but was humiliated, retired and suffered from Parkinsons Syndrome, lit the torch at Atlanta, etc.
I was hoping for more of a biopic kind of feel.
""Ali"" disappoints in this regard. It only focuses on 1966-1972. This is a shame. I think they could have shortened some of the fight scenes. I mean, this wasn't supposed to be a ""Rocky"" film but rather a film about Ali the man.
""Ali"" is stylish and if you don't know a lot about Ali, you might enjoy this. I mean, it's a fascinating story up to that point. It's just something that's been told over water coolers and even at lecture halls all these years that you probably already know it.
Jamie Foxx's portrayal of Drew Bundini is great. I keep raving about how talented Mr. Foxx is. The way he took an obscure character and made it his own is remarkable. It might be worth waiting for this to air on cable just to see Foxx's performance.
I should add that the soundtrack for this movie is very good. If you like old time jazz/funk, just get the movie soundtrack.
So forget Ali. There's a James J. Braddock movie coming out next year. Let's hope they don't screw that up. BOXING RULES!",1044057600,,2411,4.532110091743119
1493759,4,B00005JKMQ,"Will Smith and Michael Mann take on Muhammed Ali with maximum perfection. The movie never fails. It tells the story of the rise of the greatest athlete that ever lived into the boxing world, his victories in both the Rumble In The Jungle and Thrilla In Manilla, his funny confrontations with Howard Cosell, who is remarkably impersonated and portayed by Jon Voight, and his many wives, which Ali refers to as a ""weakness towards women"".
The only weakness about this DVD is the extra features segment...there are no features! I sure would have liked to see a behind the scenes segment, or an interview with Will or Ali himself with their thoughts regarding the movie. The music video by R Kelly would have also been nice to have here. But the film which is almost 3 hours is a great viewing experience.
With one star off the rating for an empty DVD, Ali is the one of the strongest films out there today.

1493763,4,B00005JKMQ,"Some  films are made great by their by action, others by being a great story, others by the soundtrack or special effects.  This movie like a few others was made by one characterization.  Will Smith IS Muhammad Ali, primarily because he has worked to make Ali's voice and inflections his own.  It is an incredibly convincing performance, and to the reviewer who said that Smith could not capture Ali, I ask whom he would suggest instead?  It is hard for me to disagree more with another Amazon[.com] colleague, and I would instead concur with another reviewer who noted this film shows the ability to have a single Oscar-caliber performance in a film which even the biggest fans acknowledge is not likely to be the best film of the year.
I guess the real challenge accepted and dealt with admirably by Director Michael Mann comes with making a film about not just someone we all know, but THE most recognized person in the world..  How can this story be told in just two hours?  As some of the detractors have made clear, this is a tough task.  But Mann did a great job, in my opinion.

Where to start this story; and where to end it?  No mention of the young boy's going to learn to box after some neighborhood kids humiliate him by stealing his bicycle.  No mention (rather surprisingly) of his Olympic gold medal and the even more significant return to the States where he threw his medal into a river in protest of racial mistreatment.  And even once we get that issue resolved, where to end this saga?  How about Summer, 1996 in Atlanta, with the Champ holding the Olympic torch (or even better, at a preliminary boxing match in those same Olympics when an incredibly bitter Joe Frazier was, when introduced, met by cheers of ""Ali, Ali!"").  This is by no means a criticism, because this one incredible life is far too large to capture in one movie.
Those who lament the lack of great boxing misunderstand what the film and Ali were all about.  He transcended his sport in a manner that no athlete has in the past fifty years (and perhaps ever).  America in the 1960's, racism, and the draft were far larger issues and more formidable competitors for him than Liston, Frazier, Foreman could have been if he had to fight all three one after the other!  If all he had done was fight and defeat them, he would have been just one more name in the record books.  This leads to my only real substantive lament:  While the ""Rumble in the Jungle"" was a singular and a true epic event, I think the three Frazier bouts were the greatest one-on-one competitions in the history of sport, and were among the defining moments of their respective careers.  For this reason, I would have like to have seen more time devoted to that relationship.
Great supporting actors.  Before seeing this, I could not imagine Jon Voight as Howard Cosell (just like Will Smith, Voight also made this role his own merely with the use of tonal inflection).  Ditto the efforts of Jamie Foxx as Drew Bundini Brown.  Mario Van Peebles would have been memorable as Malcolm X, but for the fact that we ALL know that he could never again be portrayed after the efforts of Denzel Washington.
Just like the Man himself, some people liked him, and some people hated him.  Not surprisingly, the reviews turned our correspondingly.  It is, as noted a better than respectful telling of the life of a great figure in the history of America.  For my money it was worthwhile, and I enjoyed it more the second and third time.",1038096000,,3480,4.563607085346216

It has a terrific cast, including Will Smith as Ali, Jon Voight as Howard Cosell, and Ron Silver and Jamie Foxx as the two men supporting the great champ in his corner.  So I want to really love this movie, but I can't.  The acting is terrific, but the movie does not move as well as it should.  The Director, Michael Mann gives us some interesting style moves, but I think fails to get us inside Ali. I guess if you liked his film Heat, you will like this one as well, because it is the same style of filmmaking.  I still think The Insider and Last of the Mohicans are his best work.  Smith deserved the Oscar nomination for his performance here and he continues to expand the expectations we have for him.
The disc itself is also not what it should be. A poor selection of extras is included with the movie.  It continues to amaze me that they release these discs without the extras that the public would enjoy.  There is an amazing amount of terrific items that could have been included about Ali, boxing, even the role of TV in sports.

1494112,2,B00005JKMQ,"I'm sorry, but I just couldn't resist that one.  I been wanting to say that ever since this movie first came out.  All jokes aside though, Will Smith really does turn in a pretty convincing performance as one of the most exciting and provocative figures in history.  The heart and passion he put into his performance is clearly evident, and that's something you just have to admire.  And I honestly wish I could base my opinion solely on his performance, so I could give the overall movie a higher rating, but, alas, a real fan or critic just can't fairly do that, so I'm forced to look at it all wich doesn't measure up unfortunately.
After all the hype surrounding this movie, dating all the way back to when it was in the development process and the talk in the rumor mill of all the training that Smith was undergoing to muscle up and really tackle the role, I just had really high expectations for it.  But, the finished product is just less-than-stellar.  And most of this is due to an incredibly choppy and confusing script.  One of the big problems with the writing is that it leaves several crucial points unresolved, for example it never goes into depth about the failures of Ali's first two marriages.  Instead it breezes right by the problems and tensions as if they're just trivial little facts.  This belies another problem in this movie which is the chronological order of events.  It's not that it doesn't follow the chronological order of Ali's life, but it never lets us know EXACTLY WHERE we're at.  We're given a date of 1964 at the beginning, but after that nothing.  Are we just s'posed to figure it out for ourselves or be able to follow along well enough to know when a year goes by, two years?  And Smith doesn't really age at all over the course of the film so that makes it even more difficult.  So that aspect of it really aggravated me.  Most of the cast have good chemistry together, and a few of the supporting players actually turn in excellent work as well, particularly Jaimie Fox as ""Bundini"" Brown, and John Voight, who gave an incredibly authentic performance as Howard Cossell.  Nona Gaye's breakthrough performance as Ali's second wife Belinda, is quite admirable considering she was given very little to work with.
Basically, a few re-writes in the script and maybe a different director would've suited this movie just fine.  That's not to say that Michael Mann hacked 'Ali' up for all it was worth; it's a very beautiful-looking film, using popular music from the '60s and '70s quite well to heighten the emotions of some scenes as well as give an authentic aura of the time period, but the overall feeling is style over substance.  I like Mann as a director, he's done good work in the past with movies like 'Heat' and the widely-acclaimed 'The Insider', but he just wasn't the right man for the job.
The only two moments of the film which really grabbed my attention were Ali's emotional reaction upon hearing of Malcolm X's death, and the final boxing match in Zaire with George Foreman, so I'd say to at least rent the movie for those scenes alone, as well as to see some of the great performances.  Just don't expect to be totally grabbed by it all.  The DVD has basically no features, which kind of surprised me, but didn't really bother me, since I don't really care about the details of how this film was made.  All I would've cared about is maybe seeing some interviews with the real Ali, and maybe some television archives of some of his boxing matches and press conferences.  Now, don't let my dryness fool ya, this is NOT by any means a terrible movie.  It's just it could've been much, MUCH better.",1029542400,,3652,4.576036866359447

A few issues jump to my mind:
First, I just cannot see Will Smith AS Ali; it looks to me like  Will Smith is IMITATING Ali.
Second, the after watching the first hour of the movie, I couldn't tell if I was watching a movie about Muhammad Ali or Malcolm X.  You get the feeling the director is making up for the fact that he didn't get to direct the Autobiography of Malcolm X.
Third, the movie shows a snapshot of 10 years in Ali's career.  There is little background and little resolution, as you would expect in such a snapshot.
And, to top it off, you just get the feeling the movie could have been done in about half the time, for all you get out of it.
In the end, you don't get much of an impression of Ali that you didn't already know, and the relevant fight scenes have already been done better.  ""When We Were Kings"", or even HBO's movie on Don King give a better treatment of Ali in the ring than this flick.",1027123200,,1003,4.128205128205129
1494235,3,B00005JKMQ,"""Ali"" runs an impressive 157 minutes - yet we don't feel as if we know much more about Muhammad Ali THE PERSON at the end of the film than we did at the beginning.  Sure, we may know more facts and details about his life than we did before but not about what really makes him TICK.
Of course, any film that attempts to record the life of a man is, by necessity, going to have to pick and choose which of the many events of that life to leave in and which to throw out.  Granted.  But the cursory nature of the screenplay causes a serious problem for this film.  The story picks up Ali's life in 1964, back when he was still known as Cassius Clay, de-throning Sonny Liston to become heavyweight-boxing champion of the world.  The time in his life before this event is dealt with in elliptical fashion.  We see virtually nothing about how he was raised, what his parents were like, what kind of values they instilled in him, what motivated him to become a boxer and, most importantly, what drew him so passionately to the creed espoused by the Nation of Islam.  Without this crucial understanding of his formative years, the Ali we see in the film seems a very superficial version of the undoubtedly more complex real life figure.  For all the screenplay's devotion to the minutiae of Ali's career as a boxer, his travels to Africa, his experiences with women, his world-famous bouts with Joe Frasier and George Foreman, the Ali of this film remains a frustrating enigma from first moment to last.  Worse, he remains static as a character, never undergoing the kind of mental, emotional or psychological growth one would expect a biography to show us.  Even his trademark egotism comes across as just a front for public consumption since he doesn't exhibit any undue arrogance in his dealings with those around him when he is out of the limelight.  Perhaps that might be the point the film is trying to make, but if it is, it is never clearly or effectively exploited to any thematic or dramatic purpose.
That is not to say that the film does not provide some ancillary pleasures.  Certainly, its strongest asset is its ability to recreate a fascinating time in world history.  Since Ali's life seemed to touch on so many of the key events of that era - racism, Black Pride, the Vietnam War, the assassinations of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. - his story actually becomes emblematic of the times in which he prospered.  Director Michael Mann manages to capture the flavor of that moment in bold, telling strokes, in large crowd scenes and in glimpses of protest riots and the brutal slayings of unarmed men. Yet, when necessary, Mann proves himself the master of both understatement and subtlety, as in his almost indirect depiction of King's killing.  In terms of their editing, the boxing scenes seem somehow less dynamic - and thereby perhaps a bit more realistic - than those in many other films on the subject.
Will Smith does an excellent job in bringing Ali to life, even if the script doesn't always provide him with the material he could have used to get at the core of the man's being.  Jon Voight does an effective job under all the makeup impersonating the inimitable Howard Cosell, yet, here too, we are never really shown just how this obviously symbiotic relationship between the boxer and the sportscaster ever came to develop.  It is crucial details like these which seem to be missing all throughout the movie.  Thus, despite the wonderful time capsule aspect of the film, ""Ali"" emerges as a disappointingly superficial study of its subject.
For whatever reason, the lives of boxers remain prime grist for the moviemaking mill.  In just the last few years alone, we have had films made about both ""Hurricane"" Carter and Muhammad Ali.  My only question is this: can ""The Mike Tyson Story"" be far behind?",1026432000,,3826,4.656760772659733
1494236,2,B00005JKMQ,"Last December this movie was a big disappointment both for the critics than the box office: I think it was unavoidable since Ali is a character too big and multifaceted to be reduced to a movie. Will Smith performance is impressive and Michael Mann's techinque filming the boxing matches works well because it gives you the sensation of being on the ring: maybe this movie could appeal to someone who hasn't read books about Ali, nor seen documentaries, however in such a case I suggest you read Remnick's ""King of the world"" and watch Gast's ""When we were Kings"".
This DVD edition is a barebone one: the video is honest, no state of the art here; the 5.1 DD audio track is good but no much surround effects here.",1026345600,,713,4.534883720930233
1494237,4,B00005JKMQ,"This is not a perfect movie by any means. But Will Smith is brilliant as Ali, particularly during the early part of the film, where he superbly portrays the boxer in his young Cassius Clay days. I remember those years when Cassius Clay came to prominence, and Smith captures his spirit, his cheekiness, his strength, and his sheer, confident youth to a tee. As Clay grows as a boxer and as a man, embraces the Muslim faith, and becomes Muhammad Ali, he changes more than his religion and name. The cockiness is still there, but so is the cynicism and disappointment brought on by too much fame, too much money, too many women, too many hangers-on. Smith handles the change from brash youth to more thoughtful man with subtlety and aplomb.
The disappointing part of the film, which begins to drag on and on, is the lack of depth in Ali's relationships. His marriages are glossed over quickly...we get no sense of what he is really thinking, or what his private life is really like. The same holds true of his relationships with his entourage, from his manager on down. If this was meant to come across as aloofness, it didn't work; this viewer found it very frustrating.
Nevertheless, the movie is worth seeing, for the sheer exuberance of Smith's acting, and the absolutely dead-on portrayal of the late sportscaster Howard Cosell, rendered fabulously by Jon Voight. It is not a brilliant movie, but in my view, it deserves more than 3 stars. I think it is inexplicably under-rated.",1025913600,,1482,4.725868725868726

In the film, he doesn't look like, talk like, or act Ali.  Will Smith might be good in the role of a light-weight boxer, but it was a big mistake to think he could portray a heavy-weight.",1025136000,,477,4.314606741573034

Smith even talked trash like the original and the greatest Ali...He would've been Ali had he been a boxer and had a big mouth but Ali was more than that, he refused to go to Vietnam, he stood against what society during his hayday thought he should've been complacent with like racism and to some degree class discrimination...  I think if you don't like Smith, you won't really like this movie. You ought to check out some of the movies staring the real Ali!

1494240,3,B00005JKMQ,"I never thought it possible, but the unfortunate length (157 minutes) and the pacing of Michael Mann's film bogs down the story of a sports icon who may never be matched in the sheer amount of charisma he possessed.  I'm a big fan of Michael Mann's - from the Miami Vice days to Last of the Mohicans to The Insider.  His visual and sound vision were clearly present in this film, and his script and the caliber of his stars clearly produced some fine individual moments and some excellent performances.  But, in trying to cover too much ground, Mann never clearly establishes a compelling single story line, and doesn't spend enough time revealing the connection (pro and con) between Ali and the American public.  Ali always kept you guessing.  Was it real, or was it Ali performing for the cameras?
As much as I enjoyed the boxing scenes, they probably did the most to drag the movie out too long....and I would have preferred more Liston and Frazier, and done Foreman only anecdotally.  The same with his marriages....more anecdotally, since none of the relationships was really allowed to evolve on film (although it would have been a shame to miss Nona Gay, as wife Belinda; she was superb). Individual performances were striking, with Jon Voight in a career caricature as Howard Cosell, a tremendous performance by Jamie Foxx as Bundini, and brief but memorable cameos by Ron Silver and Giancarlo Esposito.  And Will Smith?  This was a really fine performance in a role that would have scared many actors.  He truly studied his role and exacted everything he was capable of in the film.  Was it worth an Academy Award nomination - I think not, but I now believe he's capable of making a real run for it in a future role.

There's not just his boxing, but also his religious affiliations, his issues with the US government, his womanizing, his relationship with the press (Howard Cosell), etc etc. Will Smith does a pretty good job, but he didn't have much to work with.

Will Smith was decent in his imitation of Ali. He had the voice down (so does Billy Crystal), but all that weight gaining wasn't enough. His only love scene was with his real-life wife, this is not groundbreaking acting! Smith was good in the boxing scenes, which were better than any boxing-related movie to date.

1494319,4,B00005JKMQ,"Starring Will Smith as Mohammad Ali, this film tries to do a lot. It especially answers the question as to why Ali has become such a famous American personality. Ali was unique in challenging some strong preconceived notions of what was appropriate for a world champion.  And his relationship with Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam made him extremely controversial.  He was a braggart, full of ego and not a very likeable person. But, after all, he was a boxer.  And this is all part of the game.
There are a lot of fighting sequences in the film.  They're shot from a wide variety of angles, including close-ups of gloves or shoulders or feet.  It gives the impression of being right there in the ring and part of the action and I found myself wincing at the blows.  I couldn't always tell who was hitting who however, and perhaps that was the director's intent.  These were over-long in spite of the realism.
I enjoyed the parts or the film which explained Ali's conversion to Islam. And I was glad the film didn't pull any punches about the politics of how he was banned and then re-instated into the religion.  Will Smith did a competent job as Ali, but it was rare when his face could register a significant range of emotion.  More successful was Jamie Foxx, cast as one of Ali's trainers.  He was the center of every scene he was in. Jon Voight played the late Howard Cosell and his scenes with Ali were excellent.  The three women in Ali's life, played by Nona Gay, Jada Pinkett Smith and Michel Michele all managed to put their own personalities into small roles that could have easily been stereotyped.
The Mohamed Ali depicted in this film is somewhat of a hero.  I can't say personally whether or not this is true.  But the film is enjoyable to watch and moved quickly through its 2 hours and 38 minutes.  It did need smoother transitions between episodes however.  And I would have liked to know more about Ali's Islamic faith.  Also, there was certain sameness to all of Ali's opponents.  Perhaps the fact that all these questions surfaced in my own mind about Ali and his career is one of the strengths of the film. It left me yearning to know more.

by the Prince of Bel Air himself, Will Smith. This is one of the greatest acting jobs I have ever seen almost anyone do. The resemblance and the heart was there, only in wasn't in a very good story. There was no begining (except for the begining of Ali),and no end (except for the end of Clay).
I feel they should have focused more on his boxing career and his life more in the film. I was disapointed only in the fact that the focus was mainly on his affairs (wifes) and his religion (no disrespect). If I am watching a movie about one of the greatest boxers of all time, I want to see the before, the middle, and the after.

1494403,3,B00005JKMQ,"""Ali"" is not quite the movie we were waiting for when it was being rumored around to be one of 2001's Oscar heavies (which it wasn't). But it is still a skillfull, stylish sometimes exciting movie about one of the most exciting and provocative figures in the history of sports. It is not so much a biographical movie as it is an examination of the man and his times. It is directed by Michael Mann (The Insider, Heat) with a rich visual style and focus. It does not span all of Ali's life but what it does explore it explores with a good amount of depth. Will Smith gives a great performance, his best ever on film, as the famed boxer and brings out some of the spirit and human side of Muhammad Ali. The boxing sequences are extremely convincing and exciting as well as the press conference sequences. The main problem with this film is the screenplay by Mann and Eric Roth (who got an Oscar nomination with Mann for ""The Insider"" and won for ""Forrest Gump""), it does not strive to be a true dissection of Ali's life, it concentrates more on style and big names. Half of the movie concentrates on Ali's friendship with Malcolm X, which is fine, for a few minutes. You really don't learn anything you haven't seen already in Spike Lee's ""Malcolm X"" and Mario Van Peebles, good as he is, takes up too much space. We want to see an exhilarating, epic movie about an epic man and his epic career. This is more just a picking at Ali's brain and personal issues.

1494405,3,B00005JKMQ,"Muhammad Ali was so much bigger than life that any biopic is likely to have come up short.  But to those of us who grew up watching Ali in his prime, this film is a real disappointment.
Director Michael Mann is a highly talented director with films like ""Heat"", ""The Insider"" and ""Last of the Mohicans"" to his credit.  Yet, in this film he takes the wrong tack and clutters it with boring details and excessive focus on racial issues that were ancillary to the life of a very exciting boxer and a dynamic showman.
To do justice to Ali's entire life, you would have to make three films.  One for the boxing, one to look behind the scenes of a complicated man, and one to chronicle his interaction with the Nation of Islam and the civil rights implications of his refusal to be inducted into the army.  The most interesting of the three are the first two.  Yet, Mann decides to give us the first and third elements with the greatest emphasis on the civil rights angle, which is clearly the least interesting aspect of Ali despite the controversy.  It seems that Mann is on a crusade to impress us with what a central figure Ali was in the civil rights movement and that his boxing was secondary to that role.  Mann wants us to believe that Ali was a civil rights leader who just happened to be a boxer, when in reality he was first and foremost an outstanding boxer with a flamboyant and arrogant attitude and a rapier wit.
Mann completely neglects the element that he presents so superbly in ""The Insider"", the character development of the main character.  In ""The Insider"", Mann drills deep into Wigand's (Russell Crowe) psyche and turns Bergman (Al Pacino) inside out.  In ""Ali"", Mann glosses over Ali's motivations and concentrates more on Ali as part of a larger mosaic rather than the fascinating character he really was.  He only gives a hint of the close relationship between Ali and Cosell, which could have been a film by itself.
The boxing scenes were well choreographed, but overly long with too much emphasis on too few fights.  Ali was one of the most active heavyweight champion ever, sometimes fighting four or five times per year, but from this film it seems like he had only four fights in his career.  We didn't need to see 15 minutes of George Foreman pounding Ali against the ropes to get the idea.
Will Smith does an excellent job of portraying Ali.  Though he sometimes misses on Ali's rapid fire poetic cadence, he hits the mark a high percentage of the time and delivers a very realistic portrayal.  In the ring, he does a passable job of imitating some of Ali's more notable moves like the ""Ali Shuffle"" and his penchant for dodging punches with his hands dangling by his side.  But no one can come close to imitating that lightning jab.
As much acclaim as Smith got for this role, John Voight steals the show as Howard Cosell.  Though the physical resemblance is not that great, Voight's command of Howard's movements and speech patterns is nothing short of phenomenal.
One thing that is very disappointing is that the DVD has absolutely no bonus material.  This is a topic that could have provided hours of background material and original footage and there wasn't even a featurette.
Overall, this film is entertaining for those who never saw Ali fight, or bad mouth an opponent in a new conference.  But for those of us who were lucky enough to see this brilliant athlete and flamboyant personality in his prime, this film never leaves the ground.  I rated it a 6/10.  For anyone interested in the real Muhammad Ali, see ""Muhammad Ali - the Whole Story"", a six hour documentary that will show you why no biopic can ever do him justice.",1020556800,,3662,4.587423312883436
1494406,1,B00005JKMQ,"Am I the only chosen one?  Com'on America stop lying, Ali's character was terrible, unconvincing, and downright unjustable to the greatest boxer of all time. The fight scenes which were supposed to be high points in the movie appeard to be low budget acting in addition to poor sound editing. The tough, straught, fearsom fighter I learned about growing up was portrayed as a 'milk it' fighter in the movie who wore his opponents out by lying on the ropes.  The only emotional times in the movie I found was Malcom X's parts.  Ordinary Van Peebles doesn't fit the character, but his truly great acting abilities become more convincing throughout the movie. I wanted to see if Van Peebles would shift the movie matter to Malcom X, and he perfectly did that with only two three sentence parts by using emotion.  When he was nervous about asking Ali to go to Africa, when he spoke about his frustrations about the girls in the church bombings(which I found an emotional high point in the movie, that Smith correctly misunderstands-more human nature between a boxer and a person of high muslim statute),when he began to be shut out of his religious community up to his assatination.  Its at that point you feel a sense of sick low and confusion for the rest of the movie.  Now, tell me about an Ali fight that we havn't seen.  Tell me something about this movie that we haven't known about for almost half a century.  Usually when we watch a very good documenarative movie, they usually show the traits that kept a person to be so great.  I read in a book a long time ago, that when Ali was little he had just missed his school bus, so he ran to school and beat the bus.  When did he start fighting?, what things made him the unordinary fighter or ordinary fighter before he became the greatest?  If I was Ali, I wouldn't have it.  But what ya gonna do, the deal was already done.",1020556800,,1876,4.485294117647059
1494407,3,B00005JKMQ,"...Michael Mann's stirring adaptation of the Muhammad Ali saga is all common fallacy of appeal to force and circular reasoning.  It ponders the all-too familiar cons of the struggling boxer, who is of course waiting to make it to the top (The Hurricane, Rocky).  ""Ali"", despite its truthful references, is a grip-n-go satire of relationship, violence, and sports, ultimately leading up to the Final Fight of victory when Cassius Clay/Muhammad Ali faces big-boy George in the ring.
The purpose of bringing up circular reasoning and appeal-to-force with ""Ali"", is that the movie is focused more on the immitations and recreations of Ali's struggles and preparation for the fights.  It presents well when Will Smith is voicing the champ and portraying the right actions.  Other than the facial tissue, we are left with a brick wall.  Where is the emotion?  Where is the greatful side?  Where is the smile?  There are many installments of Ali's womanizing complications, his Muslim road of life, his neglection, and even his courtroom detour of possible imprisonment after refusal of fighting in the Vietnam War; great- but why is everything about his major struggles?  Weren't there issues in his time where he would sit back and smile because of them?  ""Ali"" never gives us a proven example, and the film forces us to withstand the vision of Michael Mann and the band of screenwriters that produced this biopic sling-shot.
Will Smith is the real champ here, doing his duties as an actor- making a legendary performance as Muhammad Ali.  His words, his movements, his feel are all on the mark.  The mere fact that his participating in this film deserves well praise alone will sustain his career for at least five years.  His Oscar nomination was no surprise and was well deserved.  He drives this drama where otherwise it could not have gone.  However, this just isn't the right movie.  This isn't ""Ali"".  This is an exterior figure of Ali ""The Champ"".  Where is the interior substance?
Jada Pinkett-Smith, Oscar Nominee- Jon Voight, and Jamie Foxx also co-star.  Voight also received an Academy Award Nomination for his supporting performance as Howard Cosell- one I think was uncalled for.  His face is pure plastic and make-up.  His texture works for the film, but it isn't anything magnificent.  If this is the case, I'd rather give Voight an Oscar for his supporting performance as President Roosevelt in ""Pearl Harbor"", where is face was again revised to reveal a stunning image of old Franklin.
To give ""Ali"" the benefit of the doubt, I will say that Will Smith and many cast members worked marvelously.  It isn't the faults of the stars.  It is the story that is corrupted with elongated sequences of boredom and neglection, overrunning the fact that is traveling too far, and yet not getting deep enough.  The scenes that needed more depth went quickly, and the less important scenes (mainly exercises) seemed to go on for a long time.
For the emptiness I left the film with, I'm going to give it a Thumbs Down.  There are means to its prescence, and there are those points where it is as if they're meaningless.  ""Ali"" is the pure example of a fighter- but it comes off as neither champion nor engaging by any means.

Will Smith doesn't even try to remotely sound like Ali, and comes off as very flat. Everything ""learned"" about Ali in the movie is nothing new unless your very young or have been living in a cave for the past 40 years. Also, it is diffult to believe that Smith would really stand a chance against the actors who played Liston, Foreman, Fraiser, or even Chuck Wepner. As for positives, Jamie Foxx steals every scene he's in as Drew ""Bundini"" Brown; but that's about it.",1020556800,,578,4.514285714285714

1494411,3,B00005JKMQ,"I was disappointed in this movie, I think Will Smith did a good job portraying Ali, but the special they did on television a few years ago was better.  For the length and the star cast of this movie, it should have been more around Ali's life, and not just boxing, we can still see original film of his bouts with Frazier, Foreman.  How many children does he have? how many times has he been married? when did the first signs of his disease develop?  What is his fatherly relationship that made his daughter decide she wanted to box?  Too much information that could have been implemented in this movie that wasn't and they always say that a great movie cannot be made about a person, until that person is no longer among us and at this rate, Ali has been portrayed too many times, that it will not have the same effect later in years.  Will Smith should have had a better script and storyline on portraying Ali, he was outstanding and its good to know that he has the ability to act as a boxer and get into the role, but the storyline to me suffered.  I give the thumbs up to the actors, but the writer and the release of information from Muhammed Ali was not enough.
I recommend the t.v version of the movie with the guy from Sparks over this version.  (Sorry, this is my true opinion).",1020470400,,1288,4.297520661157025
1494412,4,B00005JKMQ,"Mohammed Ali is bigger than life and portraying him in a movie is a daunting task.  Will Smith probably comes as close to looking, sounding and acting like Ali as a person could, but there is always a sense that the movie falls a little short of catching the essence of the man.  Events in Ali's life unfold in the movie, but there is never much depth of explanation about why things happened as they did.  John Voight is superb as Howard Coselle and the movie paints a close relationship between Cosell and Ali which is belied by the verbal barbs they always shot at each other on tv.  There are so many important events in Ali's life that if must have been a nightmare deciding what to include.  Although it has a 2 1/2 hour running time, the movie seems to end rather abruptly.  Despite its flaws, Ali is an entertaining film and does hold the viewer's attention.",1020384000,,866,4.415094339622642
1494493,3,B00005JKMQ,"Despite the enormous hype and promotion of Smith's ""transformation"" into Ali, I can only suppose that Mann -- who originally could not get the movie funded, especially after the tragically unsuccessful masterpiece The Insider-- was saddled with Smith as a condition of getting the money.  After all, in Hollywood, such a large budget could not be banked on anyone but Smith or Denzel, and Denzel can't play every single black hero, since he always looks just like, well, Denzel.  But Smith, without a doubt a likeable and charismatic actor, is all wrong for the part.  Despite the hype of voice training, he doesn't get Ali's voice or cadence right at all.  He's superb in the boxing scenes, and these are the best part of the film, but otherwise Smith's Ali lacks Ali's CHARM.  When Smith does Ali's famous playing with a child, ""Did I hurt you?"" (pretending to have punched him too fast to be seen), we don't feel like laughing with Ali's humanity, we feel like Smith just made a bad, self-serving joke.
For all of his poetic rants, Ali's gift (even in the ring) was his sphynx-like quality.  Even through his throaty braggadocio, one was always left wondering: ""Does he really understand boxing tactics, or is he just saying he does?  Does he really understand Malcolm X's complicated African nationalism, or is he just mimicking?""  Mann's script is underrated, precisely because it preserves these questions instead of other treatments which take one side or the other.  But Smith walks through looking simultaneously cocky and bewildered, and that's not the same thing as the quiet and intense sphinx with the Mona Lisa smile, which was Ali.
At the same time, for all my admiration of Mann, one senses that he became too infatuated with historical accuracy for the mileau and boxing, and paid insufficient attention to the pacing (which is unweildy and inconsistent, so the audience yawns when they should be tense, poised for a climax) and to the supporting performances.  Peebles is an embarrassment as Malcolm X, for example.
Mann was in a Catch-22.  Ali is maybe the best biography of the twentieth-century, but there is no bankable Hollywood star appropriate for the role.  Given that reality, he should not have made the movie.  One senses Mann's integrity (shown in everything from Last of the Mohicans to Heat to The Insider) was somehow compromised here by his wishful thinking that he could make Smith into Ali so he could make the story.
The story is more engaging and thought-provoking in the dvd ""When They Were Kings.""",1020384000,,2537,4.899532710280374

Yes, the assassination of Malcom X is arresting, yes, the footwork in the ring is well photographed, yes, the makeup artists created a wax figure of Howard Cosell out of Jon Voight's face.  But this film seems to be about a man in retrospect, which leaves out all the wonderful madness that made Ali such a vibrantly alive figure.  Too much is just left out (the first wife beautifully protrayed by Jada Pickett Smith just drops out of sight without any explanation, the ""beginnings of Rap"" are ignored, the blustery buffoonery of a really charismatic man is dusted under the carpet), as though we are only to see Ali as the second coming of Christ.

This film is everyhting you thought it would be and then some.  I am 20 years old and did not have the plessure to live through the ""Ali years.""  Although I have seen many sports documentaries and have read several books about the man, no one film or book captures the mythical essence of Ali as this movie does.
It is true that it would have been nice to see the young years when Clay grew up in Louisville, KY (just 30 miles from me,) and competed in the Olympics for the gold medal.  (Which he then tossed into the Ohio River.)  But, this film is about the man, the myth, and the legend.  When the film is viewed like this, it is more understandable.
There are some of the most powerful moments in a ""sports"" film ever here.  Being a serious fan of ""Rudy,"" ""Hoosiers,""  (I love Gene Hackman and I am from Indiana,) and ""Rocky"", I can say that the moment were Ali gets up out of the chair in the 8th to knock out Foreman after the now classic ""rope a dope"" form was used to wear him out is simplely uplifting.  Is it correct to the actual event?  No, I have the HBO DVD special to prove it.  But it doesn't matter.  Like I said, this film is about Ali, not the history of what Ali did.
Some things that make this movie special:  They really hit each other.  No ""Rocky"" high uppercuts that don't even graze Mr. T or Apollo Creed.  Jamie Foxx is a brillant actor and extremely funny.  ""I'm just a black jew who can't read or write and that's half drunk.""  The fact that Will Smith and his wife make a love scene covencing because they really and truely are IN LOVE!...  Howard is played brillantly in this movie.  You can't tell that it's an actor!...  ""And Foreman goes DOWN HARD to the mat!...""  That call makes my spine tingle.
The most powerful moment of all is when Malcom X is shot and killed.  When I saw it in the theature, everyone was silent and teary-eyed.  That may be the best thing about this movie and ultimately, Ali.  Black, white, yellow, red, purple, you can fill things in this movie for the times they lived in, for the things they went through, and for Ali the man, the myth, the legend, himself.
If you never see another movie about sports in your life, see this.  Will Smith is stunning.  He IS ALI for due purposes.  The acting is great and the film as a whole is stunning.  Just brillant.........",1020038400,,2326,4.251141552511416

Director Michael Mann brings to vivid life many episodes from the life of the man formerly known as Cassius Clay. However, for me these episodes did not add up fully; I felt like the film did not attain the true epic stature it aspired to.
Nonetheless, ""Ali"" is a compelling and entertaining film that combines superb production details, a fine cast, and other noteworthy elements. Will Smith and Jon Voight have both earned much rightful praise for their respective performances as Ali and sportscaster Howard Cosell. Smith will, in my opinion, never again be seen merely as an actor for ""popcorn"" flicks: in Ali we see the triumphant breakthrough performance of a dramatic leading man. Voight's total transformation into Cosell is amazing; if I didn't know beforehand that he was playing the role, I don't think I would have recognized him. Although Smith and Voight seem to have gotten most of the praise (and award nominations!), I would like to personally celebrate Mario Van Peebles for his portrayal of Malcolm X. I found his to be a very moving performance.
Perhaps Ali's life is simply too big to fit into a movie; maybe an extended miniseries would have made a better vehicle by which to tell his story. As a student of comparative religion, I felt in particular that the story of Ali's Islamic faith was not explored enough.

1494573,5,B00005JKMQ,"The movie ""Ali"" portrays the story of one of the world's most recognized boxers, Mohammed Ali (who was born Cassius Clay).
Actor Will Smith gives an excellent performance as boxer Ali.  It is hard enough to portray a real character, much less a legendary one.  Smith is successful in showing not only the physical side but also the charisma of the boxing personality, Ali, who has strong convictions and a funny wit.
The movie begins with Ali's fight against boxer Sonny Liston, which puts him on the map as a fighter.  It ends with Ali's fight with George Foreman in Zaire (now called the Democratic Republic of Congo).  This famous fight was billed as the 'Rumble in the Jungle.'  In between, the movie covers the fighter's rise to success, his conversion to the Muslim religion, his name change and his fight against the U.S. government to keep from being enlisted in the army. We also see Ali's close friendship to two well-known people - sportscaster Howard Cosell and Malcom X.
The movie ""Ali"" also touches on the boxer's attraction to women and some of his many love relationships.  (Smith's real life's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, plays the role of Ali's first wife.)  Ali is certainly attracted to all pretty women!
All the actors give wonderful performances - Jamie Foxx as Bundini Brown (the man who worked to motivate Ali and help him with his rhymes - ""Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee!""), Jon Voight as Howard Cosell, Mario Van Peebles as Malcolm X, Mykelti Williamson as Don King, Giancarlo Esposito as Cassius Clay Sr., Jada Pinkett Smith as Sonji Roi (Ali's first wife) and Nona M. Gaye as Belinda Boyd, to name a few.
The shots especially of some of the African countries (Ghana, Mozambique and South Africa) are vibrant and rich.
Although I'm not much of a boxing fan and sometimes found the boxing scenes a bit prolonged, all in all I found the movie a great story of a great athlete set to a great music soundtrack.",1013990400,,1942,4.67741935483871

1494576,4,B00005JKMQ,"The movie focuses on the time between when a young Cassius Clay first wins the Heavyweight Championship of the World from Sonny Liston and when a 32 year old Muhammad Ali regains the Championship from George Foreman at the Rumble in the Jungle.  The movie focuses less on Ali in the ring and
more on his life outside.  You see the multiple marriages, his conversion to Islam, his fractured relationship with Malcolm X, and most importantly his battle with the United States Courts when Ali refused to serve in Viet Nam.
 Michael Mann directs this in his usual visual intense style.  If you have ever seen a production by Mann (Miami Vice, The Last of the Mohicanns, and The Insider to name a small few) you know that he deals with a variety of colors to focus the movie and the scenery tells the story almost as much
as the script.
 The acting is superb by almost everyone involved in the movie but a few people really stand out.  Will Smith proves that Robert De Niro is not the only one who will gain weight by packing about 20 to 30 pounds of muscle on his frame and then completely immerses himself in the cadence and style
of Ali's speech.  Few actors today would seem to have the capability to spout off some of Ali's tirades as Will does.  Jamie Foxx does an incredible job as Bundini Brown.  His breakdown on drugs and the fight back to sobriety shows that this former In Living Color co-star can handle a great deal more
than we originally thought.  The surprise of the movie was Jon Voight. People have portrayed Howard Cosell before but Voight actually becomes him. He sounded like Cosell and the make-up job was so detailed that I had to look a couple of times before I was able to actually recognize Voight.  The relationship between Ali and Cosell is played up on many levels showing how
each actually helped catapult the other into the levels of stardom that they reached.
 The movie is very, very well done.  The script was tight and didn't stray into too many areas that would have dragged the movie down.  The direction was on top and the dialogue was rapid fire and concise.",1012608000,,2093,4.488126649076517
1494577,3,B00005JKMQ,"Sure Will Smith gives probably the best acting performance of the year.  Sure Mann's direction gives the fight scenes -especially Ali's first against Liston, the opening scene - a thrill and immediacy missing from the Rocky flicks.  Sure ""Ali"" tries to tackle the issues of race in the tumultuous 60s and wants to depict Ali for what he was: a truly courageous and principled man, as well as a hot-head and egoist.  But the film ultimately fails.  Because you leave the theater asking yourself what you have learned about Muhammad Ali.  The answer?  Nothing.
What's wrong with the film?  First, it was over-ambitious.  Mann attempts to chronicle a very, very busy ten years.  If he had focused on a single theme - race and religion, say, or the entourage and the crazy goings on - perhaps it could have worked.  Instead, the movie jumps all over the place, first trying to depict a relationship with the elder Clay, then showing Ali's marital problems, then his relationship with Malcolm X, and so on and on.  As a result, Mann can't make any definitive statement about Ali, the times, the characters, the events.  It feels like a music video.  Empty.  Hollow.
Trying to cover material already depicted in a better film.  Why do the Foreman fight?  ""When We Were Kings"" is a million times better and covers the same fight, and only that fight!  That movie has everything ""Ali"" does not, Ali included!
All the great things left out.  The Floyd Patterson fight, when Ali fought maliciously and cruelly against an opponent who tried to appeal to the white mainstream.  Or the series of white fighters Ali demolished in defense of his crown after the second Liston fight.  Or the events leading up to the first Liston fight, the crazy stunts Cassius Clay pulled to get his name in the paper and infuriated the champion Liston to fight an under qualified young light heavyweight.
Too many characters.  Many of them don't play any part in adding to the film.  Who can say, based on the movie, what Ali's father was like?  Cus D'Amato?  Elijah Muhammad?  Elijah's son and Ali's manager, Herbert Muhammad?  The photographer friend, Howard Bingham?  Any of the wives?  Only a few roles really stick, Will Smith as Ali, Jamie Foxx as Bundini, and Jon Voight as Howard Cosell.  And based solely on these performances, I recommend the movie.
I wish Mann had concentrated on a narrower time frame.  The first Liston fight, for example.  And why not?  It had all the elements, the brash talking, the involvement with the Nation of Islam, the brilliant fighting.  All the elements that later drove Ali to reject the military.  But also all the contradictions in Ali's character, the egoism, the harsh anti-white talk, etc.
I give this thing 3 stars because of Will Smith.  Otherwise this movie is not great.  Will Smith deserves the Oscar!",1012176000,,2824,4.774327122153209

Now for some cons. The cinematographer needs to find another profession. The camera shakes too much during the fights and blurs people out a lot. It is somewhat nauseating ... The Rocky movies had better fight photography. My eyes were beginning to hurt from the extremely bright white colors in the movie. Another thing, it brings out all the bad history of Ali. It shows him being a womanizer, a bad husband, and a traitor to his friends and country. At times, I was wondering if I liked the man or not. They picked a bad time of his life to portray. Finally, I didn't learn anything more about Ali from the movie. Everything in it was common knowledge.
Overall, not a bad movie, but not a good movie either. It is worth seeing if you don't know much about Ali and camera shaking doesn't bother you.",1011571200,,1031,4.319587628865979
1494650,3,B00005JKMQ,"Michael Mann has got to be one of the best and also one of the most overlooked directors in Hollywood. I'm a big fan of his work and will see any film on the sole basis of seeing his name in the credits [as director], but when I mention to most people about my excitement of a new movie coming out by Michael Mann all I generally receive are puzzled looks.
Mann's last two films, Heat and The Insider, rank among my favorite films of all time so naturally I was more than excited to see his latest film, Ali. This film has all the magic of Mann's visionary directing as well his amazing ability to get the most out of any actor. Will Smith (who I think is a horrible actor) gives a surprising good performance and who would have thought Jon Voight and Howard Cosell were in fact the same person? Unfortunately there isn't much of a story to make all the pieces worth putting together.
As a biopic I don't expect to find the traditional set-up/conflict/climax method of storytelling, but neither do I expect to see the complete lack of cohesion this film seems to have. This film jumps to different points throughout many of the famous parts of Ali's life seemingly without rhyme or reason.
The film is an interesting look into the life of a very interesting individual, and Mann's directing along with wonderful performances from all the film's actor are enough to take away the pain of the poor screenplay. Ali is not a bad film at all, but you can't help thinking about how good this film should have been.",1011398400,,1508,4.447653429602888
1494651,3,B00005JKMQ,"The title of this review does not mean Ali is a brilliance amidst many other mediocre movies. It actually means one can find some brilliant moments in Ali the movie, but for most of the 2-and-half hour duration, it's boredom and incoherence.
I almost fell asleep the first 15 minutes into the movie. I don't think the boxing scenes are exciting, maybe except the last 2 mins of the last one (Ali Vs. Foreman in Zaire)... mostly due to the refreshing soundtrack accompanying that. And there're quite a few long and dragging boxing scenes. I was surprised that the style of shooting the boxing scenes in this movie is pretty similar to that in the Rocky movies (which were made about 20 years ago!). I had expected more artistic touches or maybe even more thrills in the boxings in Ali. But it's disappointing.
The movie is more like a collection of anecdotes in Ali's early career than a coherent story, not to mention a drama. As such, there is really not a point in the movie that can be called a climax. Without an interesting storyline, in order to keep the audience mentally involved in the movie, it at least has to offer some superb acting and effective atmosphere.
For the acting, it's one of the few brilliant spots of the movie. Will Smith is very good. On the screen, he's totally a people's champ and he portrays Ali's confidence (arrogance) and humor wonderfully. Besides Smith, I think the other cast members in general do a good job, too.
However, the second ingredient, the atmosphere, is less than satisfying. The decision to shoot some sequences using hand-held camera is a good one. It gives a more real and historical feel to this cinematic biography. And overall, I think each scene is OK (maybe except the one where thousands of supporters in Zaire are chanting Ali's name for... oh the whole 3 mins or so!). But on a larger scale, the arrangement of the scenes does not seem sharp enough. As I mentioned, too much time is given to too many boxing sequences. A few more scenes describing the mental journey of Ali before and after his decline to join the military would be welcome additions. And I would feel more comfortable if the long scene where Ali stares at his portrayals on his admirers' houses in Zaire is completely deleted (too corny and artificial).
The movie wants to give a big picture of Ali to the audience. But it's hard to do because the movie can be only 2 or 3 hours long. Unlike in many other biography flicks like ""A Beautiful Mind"" which revolves around only one or two extraordinary aspects of the character's life (and portrays it with some dramatization), Ali the boxer is presented in a matter-of-fact manner and many different aspects of his life are covered with equal weight. This style is not likely to work if the atmosphere is not really well crafted, which is unfortunately the case here. To me, not a fan of Ali's, he's just another person with some character and some achievement. I'd thought this movie would change my perception somewhat. But even during or after the movie, I really don't feel as though I care much for him. I suppose I would not prefer this movie to a PBS documentary of Ali (if there's one).",1011052800,,3170,4.612389380530973
1494652,2,B00005JKMQ,"Michael Mann's ""Ali"" is not really a bad film. But, I wouldn't go as far as to say it's a good film either. It's somewhere in the middle. Unlike Muhammad Ali himself, ""Ali"", the film, doesn't pack much of a punch. It feels like the script, which was written by several people, including Mann himself, coulda used more time in the gym preparing. The film doesn't supply me with anything I don't know about Ali already! It doesn't tell me or teach me anything new about his life. It doesn't tell me what made Ali want to become a boxer. Who were his inspirations? None of this is revealed. People who know nothing about Ali's life will find to film to be not only entertaining, but, as an education into the life of a very controversial man. People whom are already fans of Ali will undoubtedly enjoy the film. Because after-all, if your a fan of the sports legend, you'll be happy to see anything about your hero's life. But, I'm not a fan of Ali on a personal level. So the story, right from the start had a lot to live up to if it was going to impress me. I admit though, I did end up liking the film more than I thought I would, but, not enough to recommend it to people.
 ""Ali"" is nicely directed by Mann, and has good performances by Jon Voight, who is probably one of my favorite things about the film. I was midly amused by Ron Silver and Jamie Foxx, and I thought Will Smith was OK, in the title role. Jada Pinkett Smith, I feel, strikes out. The problem with her is, there's no screen-time for her. She has nothing to work with. Infact, to be honest, the only bit of information I got out of ""Ali"" was, I didn't know the names of his wives.
  The other problem with ""Ali"" besides the screenplay is the fact that the story has no meaning. The story is not consist enough to keep our interest for the entire lenght of the film which is 2 hours and 47 minutes. It's not a strong enough of a story. ""Ali"" has moments also where it feels preachy a bit. It's too sentimental. Though, the film does have it's moments where it works. I really don't want to sound like ""Ali"" is an awful film. It's not. I've seen worst. But, like I said, if you know a lot about ""Ali"" you will not come away with anything you didn't know before. It's not like we all don't know who was going to win the championship in the ""rumble in the jungle"" fight. An average movie with average results.  ** 1\2 out of ****",1010793600,,2393,4.206971677559912
1494653,4,B00005JKMQ,"Armed with the knowledge that the critical consensus says ""Ali"" is a flawed film, I wasn't expecting much going in.  Coming out, I would agree that on some fundamentally important levels, it is a flawed film.  But it also does some things remarkably well.  Most notably, it allows those of us too young to have seen it for ourselves the chance to experience the roller coaster ride that was Muhammad Ali in his prime.
""Ali"" begins, quizzically, with an announcer introducing Sam Cooke as he takes the stage to sing.  But once the music gets going, and the film intercuts scenes of a young Ali running the streets and reliving memories, we are well aware of the world we are about to enter.  It's a stunning opening, mixing athletics, entertainment, and politics as effectively as Ali himself did.  It positions Ali as the seminal sporting figure of the 1960's, just as the first 60 pages of Don DeLillo's book ""Underworld"" did for Bobby Thomson's ""Shot Heard Round the World"" in the 1950's.  I don't make that comparison lightly.
Seeing as how this is a biopic about a boxer, it is unavoidable that I talk about the effectiveness of the fight scenes.  I thought they were tremendous, full of kinetic energy, confusion, power, and glory.  Director Michael Mann's pet camera trick, i.e. shooting over the protagonist's shoulder, was used to great effect here (as it was in the rest of the movie).  It allowed the audience to feel what it would be like inside the ring with Sonny Liston, or how well the Rope-a-Dope was working on George Foreman, or the beat down that Ali received in the first of his Pyrrhic bouts with Smokin' Joe Frazier.  And Mann doesn't only use his camera to convey important information, he uses sound as well.  In the Zaire fight scenes, listen to Foreman's breathing.  It gets perceptibly, but subtly, heavier as the rounds go on.  Brilliant!
Will Smith, who's never had to sustain a role of this size for this long, does an excellent job.  Physically transformed, you believe that he could hold his own in the ring.  His acting is stunning, capturing not only Ali's louder moments (which shouldn't have been a stretch for him) but also his quieter, contemplative, anxious moments.  We get to see just how much of an act the public Ali persona was, in that it could crumble instantly the moment trouble reared its ugly head, only to re-emerge from the ashes again when needed.  While Smith will never make you forget the titanic charisma of the real thing, but he does come out of the film without a mark on his face (""...so I must be the Greatest!"").
The supporting cast is uniformly excellent, only some of the performances were obviously left on the cutting room floor.  Ali had such a vast array of colourful characters in his entourage, that the less flamboyant ones (read: Paul Rodriguez as Dr. Ferdie Pacheco) get nary a line.  Standouts include: Jamie Foxx as 'Bundini' Brown, a mystical motivator with manic depressive tendencies; Jeffrey Wright as an underwritten Howard Bingham, freelance photographer and spouter of periodic pearls of wisdom; and Ron Silver, as trainer Angelo Dundee.  Although I would have liked to have seen how this motley crew was assembled, just hanging out with them was enough fun.  Special notice should be given to Jon Voight, who's Howard Cosell equals Smith's Ali in that neither is an impersonation, but an impression of their respective real life figures.  Voight captures the twinkle in Cosell's eye whenever Ali is around.  The two form a fine mutual amusement society.  But Cosell off camera is a different beast, looking out for Ali as a father figure.  Smith and Voight have great chemistry in every scene they have together.
As for those flaws, I've identified two.  Paradoxically, the film is too long *and* not long enough.
The film is too long, in that some scenes, while beautiful and relevant, felt over-extended.  The visceral moment when Ali realizes what he means to the people of Zaire is preceded by an endless and repetitive montage of him running through the streets.  Many of the film's best moments would have been better with a bit of trimming, which would have helped the overall flow.
The film is not long enough, in that the more naive of its audience members will be in the dark without some crucial information.  The magnitude of the first Liston bout is impalpable.  The film tries to tell us that Liston is unstoppable, but it never shows us.  And the extended time in Africa, which is essential to show why it was so important for Ali to win, is glossed over in places.  For more information on the Liston fight, and peeks into Clay's childhood, read David Remnick's book ""King of the World"" (on page 195, you'll even find out why Clay went blind for a round).  For more insight into the Zaire fight, see Leon Gast's documentary ""When We Were Kings"".
Armed with this background information, ""Ali"" is a less confusing bit of nostalgia.  It allows you into Ali's life, behind the scenes with probably the most important athlete of the 20th century, while never glossing over his human flaws.  It's a fine film.",1010361600,,5103,4.759090909090909

I did think the acting by Will Smith and Jon Voight were outstanding, and they both deserve awards.  I also thought this movie was dragged out.  There are so many unanswered questions for me with this film.
I would think coming out of a biographic film that one would have knowledge about the subject. I learned a few things, like how Ali had avoided the draft, and that he knew Malcom X, but the greatest listen learned was that I should've saved that $8.75 and seen ""Ocean's Eleven"" twice.
I fell asleep twice in this movie as it just wasn't keeping me interested and it was my bedtime after all.
This movie did nothing for me, nor my husband. If you are a HUGE fan of Will Smith, you will appreciate it for his acting.  If you are a HUGE Ali fan, you might appreciate. I was just the average film goer, taking a chance.  I do like Will Smith alot, and thought he was amazing in this.

1494658,1,B00005JKMQ,"Even something like Driven was better than this very badly edited account of the life of the ""greatest"".
I will warn right now that to explain this badly edited movie, I have to reveal many spoilers in my review, so be warned right now. However, it does not really matter, as most people already know the biography of Muhammad Ali anyway.
Truly astonishing. How a very interesting life turned into one of the most pretentious and awful movies I have ever seen still amazes me. Before watching this movie, I did not know much about Muhammad Ali besides the fact that he was one of the greatest boxers (if not the greatest) in the history of boxing. What I learned from this movie was not much more.
This is probably the most horribly edited movie I have ever seen. While it begins interesting, the story loses coherence as it jumps from one place in his life, to another. In fact, I did not even know the movie took place over a period of ten years until I read the biography afterwards, which helped fill in all the missing places in the movie, and was very interesting, whereas the movie was dull and boring. I did not know there was a 3 1/2 year gap between his arrest and the overturning of his conviction (the movie makes it almost seem like a couple months), they barely mentioned the restaurant chain in the movie, we never actually found out that it was a failed attempt, and most of all, the most confusing parts of the movie dealt with his love life. It was not known to any of us who were watching if the first woman, Sonji Roi played by Jada Pinkett Smith, actually ever married Ali. Because all they showed afterwards was her walking away from him, and then we see him dating someone else, we figured that they were never actually married, when in fact, they were, and the marriage was annulled. We also barely saw the marriage to Belinda the second woman, and then the third, Veronica is barely in the story anyway. We only find out at the very end that he divorced Belinda, to marry Veronica, and then apparently married another person, afterwards. (Are you counting? That's four wives.)
I thought this movie was supposed to convey the greatness of Muhammad Ali, and show why he was so beloved by so many fans. All I saw was a man with many troubles in his love life and who was way too cocky. Where is this greatness that everyone is talking about? Surely it exists in the real Ali, but I don't see any of that greatness in this movie.
The movie was not enough about the REAL Ali. Most of it was about his troubles with boxing, and the movie showed to us the face that he showed to the press and the outside world. But we do not get any of the real stuff we should be knowing; his dreams, hopes, real troubles...Perhaps it would have been better if they started earlier in his life too. Starting from 1964 when he became the World Heavyweight Champion was not a good choice, as there really is no goal for him from then on except to defend his title - I mean, he already became the World Champion, so the rest of the movie loses its meaning, as all he wants to do is regain it (Remember, 2nd time around is always not as thrilling). Also, if they recounted earlier aspects of his life, we would have more background knowledge of him, and perhaps understand the character a bit more. It would also have been wise to go past where they did stop, and continue through to his struggles with Parkinson's Disease, which would have also been interesting.
Another problem I had was the incredibly long parts that should have been cut out. There was a scene several minutes long where he was just walking along and thinking. While a minute of this would have been nice, as it also gives the audience the feeling that he is thinking, and gives us a little insight into his character, several minutes worth of this is rather tiring and pointless.
Still, there were some good points. The point where he refused to be drafted, and the recounting of that was very interesting, if not because of the actual movie, but because of the real events. The problem with the movie at this point was there was no struggle here. After he got arrested, a couple minutes later in the movie, the Supreme Court overrules it in his favour. We don't see the struggle, or his love for boxing here, as he struggled through those 3 1/2 years, and so we also don't appreciate the magnitude of the Supreme Court's ruling.
Jamie Foxx did a very nice job, small as it was, and I also thought Mario von Peebles who played Malcolm X did a great performance, although that role was tiny. Will Smith's performance was excellent, despite the overwhelming incoherence of the movie, which made it look horrible. After reading the biography, I understood his performance much more, and was that much more impressed.
Perhaps if it was edited well, this movie actually had the great potential to be one of the year's best. Instead, it is at the other extreme, as one of 2001's worst.
And so, I cannot recommend this movie, but rather have to recommend people to never watch this worthless and horrible film. Read the biography instead. It was indescribably much more entertaining, interesting, and moving.",1009929600,,5172,4.503191489361702

This movie did not do his life justice.  Ali was full of energy and charisma.  This movie was not.  It was long and drawn out, full of ""artsy"" camera shots and cinematography with little of the energy that Ali radiated through out his career.  In a movie of this length, they could have covered more of his life, instead they let the ""creative talents"" of the director and producers take center stage, while Ali himself would have never let anyone take center stage over himself.

This is probably the best acting vehicle he has been in, and he carried the role off to perfection.  The boxing scenes were so realistic, I felt that I was ringside.  Another surprise was Jon Voight as Howard Cosell!  I don't believe anyone could have played him more believably and realistically as Voight.  For me, the movie was also an education, as it presented a culture of which I have no knowledge.
This move draws one in with all senses, and each sense is completely satisfied.
I remember as a teen when Ali refused the draft. At that time I felt he had let down the nation with his unpatriotic action and words.  After seeing this movie, I was compelled by his strength of belief, and walked away with nothing but admiration for him.
The movie ends with the ""Rumble in the Jungle"".  I do wish that it had told more of his later life, but realize that there was no time for it.  Perhaps a sequel.......",1009670400,,1237,4.409691629955947
1494726,3,B00005JKMQ,"ALI is the tribute to the now almost-recluse Muhammad, starring Will Smith in his undeniably best screen performance ever. The film spans the period from 1964, when Ali took the heavyweight boxing crown from Sonny Liston, to 1974 when he won it back from George Foreman. In between, Muhammad engineers a name change (from Cassius Clay), runs through a couple of wives, contests a draft evasion conviction with the U.S. Justice Department all the way to the Supreme Court, becomes pals with Howard Cosell, has an on and off relationship with Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam, and loudly proclaims himself as The Greatest to whomever will listen. All of these events are part of the public record.
Ali is arguably the greatest heavyweight boxer the United States has produced. He was loud and obnoxious, but he did (and still does) have class. Unfortunately, his great career, and the Champ himself, are shortchanged by ALI. Rather than being a seamless visual and dramatic narrative, the film is a series of snapshots disjointedly strung together with too much emphasis on some people and events, and not enough on others. This film is badly in need of some serious editing. As examples, Malcolm X and much of the Zaire pre-Rumble sojourn should have been left on the cutting room floor (or, in this age of digital editing, in the computer's Recycle Bin). Moreover, the screenwriters didn't take the time to sufficiently introduce the audience to some of the characters, and at several points I mentally asked, ""Who are those people?"" And, in a bigger lapse, those same screenwriters don't allow us a perception of Ali the man that goes much deeper than his surface bombast and popular charisma. I'm left knowing (and caring) more about the fictional character of Stallone's Rocky Balboa than the real-life Ali. (Honey, you haven't given my ROCKY  I, II, III, and IV tapes to Goodwill, have you? I want to see them all again.)
Despite its major flaws, the film does incorporate two acting performances of note. First of all, there's Smith's. While it may not be good enough to merit this year's Academy Award for Best Male Actor, Will should justifiably be nominated at least, and this performance is his best to date. Also, Jon Voight's Howard Cosell perfectly captures the man that those of us of a certain age remember and love (or hate). In a single year, Voight has played both Cosell and FDR (in PEARL HARBOR). For an actor, I suppose the roles don't get much better than those.",1009670400,,2490,4.831381733021077
1494727,4,B00005JKMQ,"This biopic features a bravura performance from star Will Smith.  He literally becomes Ali, proving that the actor is a force of which Hollywood should reckon.
Jamie Foxx is also remarkable as ""Bundini"" Brown and Jon Voight is magnificent as Howard Cosell.  If the Oscar board is wise, both thespians should be up for ""Best Supporting"" nods.
The oh-so-familiar story has its lapses but the brilliant cinematography, scoring, and direction by Michael Mann make this one of the highlights of 2001.",1009584000,,495,5.098765432098766
1494728,3,B00005JKMQ,"For a three hour movie, this movie had remarkably little content. Althought biographical, it only covered a few years of his life, not even his complete boxing career. There were many unnecessary scenes that had nothing to do with the rest of the movie. For example, there was about 20 minutes of Ali jogging (around two hours into the movie) in preparation for the famous ""Rumble in the Jungle"" fight. During these 15 -20 minutes, the only dialouge is some Africans chanting something which translated to (I think) ""fear Ali."" This scene has no point, and I think it was just put there because they wanted to make the movie longer. There were many other examples, but that one was the worst.
Also, the movie was poorly directed during the boxing scenes. I often found myself wondering who was punching who. The camera angles were often poor. Also, some characters just materialized without introduction. For example, (I don't want to give away  too much) but Ali's second wife just comes out of nowhere. The audience is never told that he even got a divorce, let alone that he remarried. This happened a couple of times in the movie.
On the positive side, Will Smith did an excellent job, as did most of the cast. Smith captured the arrogance, and hypocritical idealogy of Ali very well. Also, that Smith was actually made to look like Muhammed Ali is a miracle of film making.
Overall, an OK movie marred by trying to be more epic than it was, and poor direction.",1009584000,,1465,4.656370656370656
1494729,4,B00005JKMQ,"(*** of 4)
It's funny how all the award nominees typically wait for the end of the year.  ""Ali"" is fortunate to have a brilliant director and excellent performances behind it.  Will Smith plays the one and only Muhammad, taking his life and transforming it brilliantly to the screen.  We are taken through the stages, decisions and fights, in-and-out of the ring, that made him the Ali as we know him today.
Jamie Foxx, Jon Voight, Jada Pinkett Smith and Mario Van Peebles co-star.  They all present their characters goldenly great.  Why is there a 3 star rating of 4 rather than all four?
This film spends too much time with itself.  Ali (Smith) is taking a run and we spend ten whole minutes watching his tracks.  Ali's attitude has been twisted into something a little different than realistic.  The world is dark and here-and-there depressing.  The film is slow and is elongated into a terminating 2 hours and 40 minutes.  There is too much in this film.  It is drawn out beyond reach.  Michael Mann obviously didn't check his editing very much, because it seems as though he didn't at all.  Luckily enough, the film seems to be ""fine"" as it is.
This film is very dramatic, but not superb.  I'll give it a Best Actor nomination, Best Supporting Actor nomination (Voight), and a Best Original Screenplay nomination, but no Best Picture because it just isn't quite there yet.  But it is a good film, one that I recommend, simply because it is very much understandable and as realistic as Hollywood will get.  It holds more facts in it than fiction, something that didn't exist with The Hurricane.  Ali is a good film, but nothing more than that.
QUOTE: ""This film raises its standards a little higher than it can come to.  The performances are dominating the film, which makes the film seem as good as it is, but it is drawn out too much and becomes so overwhelmed by itself that it forgets how long the audience has been sitting there.  As it is, Ali is a rocking film that shines with its colors of pride and victory.  Will Smith and Michael Mann have made a standard good film.  But it misses the one factor that made Rocky a powerhouse movie.  This film deserves a handshake, but to gravel at its feet by saying it's the best film of the year, is a little over-doing it.""",1009584000,,2277,4.529411764705882
1494730,1,B00005JKMQ,"The movie ""Ali"" should have been as great as the real Ali.  But it was awful.  Beyond awful.  This was the first movie I've seen in a decade that I wanted to walk out on.  You learn next to nothing about Ali during the entire movie and are left mostly wondering why we have to watch Ali take a shower in slow motion.  The whole thing is a confused, slow motion mess, more intent on being a long music video than on telling what should be a fascinating story.  The movie is dull and boring -- and making it last 3 hours didn't help.  Mind you, a good Ali movie could easily last 3 hours, but this one wasn't it.  On the bright side, the casting was brilliant and Will Smith is amazing in this role -- he somehow transformed his slight build into a credible heavyweight boxer and is entirely believable as Muhammad Ali (these good points make it even more disappointing that the movie is lousy).  Smith was so good in the role, and this movie was so awful, that someone should make a real movie about Ali, and recast Smith in the title role.  After this performance, no one else could measure up to Smith as Ali.  His performance deserves a much better movie and I'm serious that another director should make that movie with Smith -- it would be worth the effort.  As for this movie, I wouldn't bother seeing it at the theater or on video or DVD -- it's just not worth it.  One of the worst movies I've seen in a long while.",1009584000,,1422,4.222222222222222

1494791,4,B00005JKMQ,"After all the years and the hyperbole, the marriages, the knockouts, the championship bouts lost, won and regained... there stands at the center of Michael Mann's ""Ali,"" the man himself, Mohammed Ali. But what we may have forgotten is that Mohammed Ali was first and foremost an honorable and brave man, though flawed and human like the rest of us.
Who among us would go up against the United States Government and the Draft Board by refusing to serve in a war in which he did not believe; thereby risking 5 years in Federal Prison, losing 3 years of his prime boxing life and subsequent lost earnings...and all out of deeply felt religious and humanitarian reasons. Ali's boxing life notwithstanding, this is ultimately the importance and the relevance of Mann's ""Ali,"" which is not so much a boxing film in the sense that ""Raging Bull"" is, but a film about a Champion and the machinations, perserverance, personality, drive and more importantly the sacrifices necessary to achieve this exalted professional position.
Michael Mann has given the film an appropriate grainy, almost newsreel look which emphasizes the sweaty, muscular milieu he is trying to portray.  But I think Mann's touch is most apparent in the performance of Will Smith as Mohammed Ali. I was extremely skeptical that Smith, heretofore a light comedian/rapper, could handle the emotional weight of such a role. I was wrong. Smith gives a towering,eloquent performance filled with the requisite heart and soul as well as the necessary bragadaccio necessary to pull off this portrayal of one of the most famous people of the the 20th century.
In supporting roles, Jon Voight as Howard Cosell, Jamie Fox as Drew Brown and Ron Silver as Angelo Dundee all do excellent work in roles that not only support Smith/Ali but do so with a kind of truth not often seen on the screen.
""Ali"" runs into the most trouble, I think when it attempts too much: the Jada Pinkett-Smith as Sonji Roy, Ali's first wife storyline simply doesn't make sense as well as the Malcolm X (Mario Van Peebles) storyline: very powerfully enacted but motivationally murky here as well.
Michael Mann and Will Smith have done a bang-up job capturing Mohammed Ali's tumultuous life on film and I will not hestitate to speculate that the Man himself cannot help but be complimented by the results.",1009497600,,2327,4.906091370558376
1494792,4,B00005JKMQ,"Let me make a suggestion to people who are about to go see Ali.  When you come out of the theater ask yourself one question:  Did you get the message?  Because you might be asking yourself one of any number of questions about what you just saw.  You might not be sure it was any good. Is this movie disjointed, sort of, is it hard to follow, in some places, does it skip around, absolutely.  The reason you have to ask yourself if you got the message is because if you did then you probably thought it was a good film.
The film basically covers the years between when Ali, then know as Cassus Clay, won the heavyweight title from Sonny Liston to when he won it again from George Foreman, about a ten year span.  And this span is when Ali was at the height of his fame.  The details are not as important as how they are presented in this film.  Since it is a docudrama everyone already knows what happened, but seen from the perspective of Ali, some of his choices seem to have been made for different reasons then were originally perceived.  Again there is no reason to go into them, but it makes this film much more interesting then if they had played it safe.  The movie is engaging from start to finish.
The best part about this movie is (to my surprise) Will Smith.  He did it.  I was totally cinvinced from the first scene in this film, he is Ali.  The swagger, the jive, the sincerity, he even looked like a prize fighter, he did it all.  The supporting players in this film, with a big high five to Jon Voight, are quite exceptional, despite slipping into the backround at many points in the film.  The look of the film was fantastic, and the boxing scenes were extremely well done.
Taking on a docudrama on a figure like Ali is one of the most difficult tasks a filmmaker can tackle.  This is because Ali is a living legend, and one of the most prominent sports figures in the twentith century.  His story is way too large for a movie so Michael Mann had an important issue confronting him.  What should this film be about?  His answer is not what the average person, and certainly not the average filmmaker might think.  He decided it should not be about anything, but capturing the essence of this almost mythical figure.  Did he do it?  I think so. Because I think I got the message.  Ali was a man heavily pushed and pulled out during a time of great turmoil in this country, but through it all he never compromised himself or his beliefs no matter what the consiquence.  I got that and that made this movie worth seeing to me.",1009497600,,2539,4.30801687763713
1494793,4,B00005JKMQ,"It only amazes me that this movie is based on an actual man, and not a fictional character.  When watching this movie it made me feel more proud to be an African-American than ever before.  The performance by Will Smith was indeed excellent...not to mention the performances of the supporting cast.  I find it typical that some critics would give this movie low ratings...could it be that this is typical of films that show African-Americans in a positive ""hero-istic"" light?  Could be, but I know for sure that this is a movie that everyone should see.  If you could sit through ""Titanic"" then by all means, this should be much easier.  Don't get me wrong, I loved ""Titanic"", but the fight scenes in Ali are riveting and the director deserves a standing ovation and a much needed pat on the back.

My standards for authenticity in film and in life are high. In short, I was watching this film with my keen eye and fine tooth comb at the ready. My Opinion?
They nailed this baby! Will Smith gives the performance of a lifetime with his own brand of charisma, while not equalling Ali sized proportions, is enough to carry the day and then some in this film. The hairs on my body occasionally stood on in.(My personal litmus test)
His preparation, exhaustive(35 pounds, A nuerologist, speech therapist, Hundreds of rounds boxing, 10 months in training to transform his body and mind, countless dinners and phone calls with insiders) and the benefit and blessings of actual participants assistance and pertinent information(He once had Ali's trainer, Angelo Dundee actually tape his hands for a scene, Boxing with Sugar Ray Leonard), Mr. Smith delivers and is worthy of nominations.
Providing the perfect curriculum for success, Director Michael Mann, with keen and artistic decision making,(great locations, real in-fighting(no stunt doubles),fight choreography from the actual bouts,) provides cohesive support along with credible performances {and incredible, John Voight as Howard Cosell} by nearly every actor involved, helping to make this film thoroughly enjoyable to every facet of emotion.

1494795,2,B00005JKMQ,"I went to see Ali with great anticipation based on the trailers and behind the scenes television spots.  I am almost fifty years old and grew up following Ali's amazing career and life.
I'm not sure what Michael Mann was attempting to capture, but I feel he missed in all areas.  The story doesn't really go anywhere.  It just sort of rambles.  It spends far too much time on musical montages.  One scene of Ali doing road work in Africa just seems to go on and on and on.
The casting is a real plus.  Will Smith captures Ali better than anyone (short of Ali himself).  Jon Voigt almost steals the picture with a remarkable performance as Howard Cosell.  Jamie Foxx and Mario Van Peebles round out an excellent cast.  Unfortunately their not given a very good story to work with.
I recommend you rent ""When We Were Kings"".  A documentary about the real ""Rumble in the Jungle"" starring the actual participants.

1494798,3,B00005JKMQ,"""Ali"" - the current theatrical release which features Will Smith in the title role, is convincing enough in some spots to grab the viewer's interest, while in other areas, leaves a bit to be desired, as far as the film's realistic merits are concerned. Yes, the latter match with Ali vs. Foreman displays a lot of that ol' in your face, grit and determination these two put into every punch thrown. The first match vs. Sonny Liston lacks that very fire, heart and gusto present in the George Foreman bout. Due to the fact the Ali-Liston fight featured in the film is simulated, doesn't win any popularity contests with many who view(ed) this feature (myself included). Nevertheless, it was an effect that had to be included to heighten the realism of the movie. The Foreman bout, although simulated to a degree as well, looked as if Will Smith and the other actor had to train to withstand those punches. This particular fight comes across well on the big screen, and is dramatic, no doubt. Now, on to Muhammad Ali's life, as portrayed by Smith in the film. Overall, Smith does a good job in capturing the essence of Ali's character, in that he hardly misses a step in quantifying a trait the real Ali was famous for - that being his arrogance and confidence inside (as well as outside) the boxing ring. As far as Ali's religious affiliation (as noted in the film) is concerned, it is surprising to note that Ali was expelled from the Muslim religion, for reasons poorly conveyed in the film. Therefore, the viewer is not given any explanation as for the cause of Muhammad Ali's expulsion from Islam. Ali is later reinstated in the Muslim religion, for reasons unknown according to the film. The character of Howard Cosell, as portrayed by Jon Voight, lacks two main characteristics - one, Voight fails to capture the physical essence of Cosell in both profile and voice, the latter of which is only 50 to 75% accurate. Two, Cosell's putdowns of Ali come across as raw and somewhat uninspiring here. It is also surprising that Ali and Cosell became good friends off camera (were they really?), and not so surprising these two were adversaries on the proverbial TV screen. Again, it is quite possible that Hollywood used the friendship scenario to draw the viewer into the movie. As far as this picture being fact-based is concerned, there is a rather distinct possibility that it may very well be, but I, for one, am not quite sold on that premise. So, in order to weigh the pros and cons of ""Ali"", you'll just have to see it and decide for yourself.",1009411200,,2550,4.656319290465632
1494799,4,B00005JKMQ,"He defeated Sonny Liston in 1964 for the heavyweight title, and shortly thereafter converted to Islam and changed his name to Muhammad Ali; was stripped of the title a few years later; reclaimed the heavyweight title by defeating George Foreman in 1974.  He was Cassius Marcellus Clay.  He is ""The Greatest"".
But is ""Ali"" the greatest?
To begin, ""Ali"" shows that there is more to Ali's life than boxing, that the fiery charisma he radiates extends beyond the ring.  His conversion to Islam and his proud defiance in refusing to be inducted into the U.S. army are as dynamic as his in-ring demeanors.  In addition, he is also surrounded by some interesting personalities:
Angelo Dundee (Ron Silver) - Ali's faithful trainer
Howard Cosell (Jon Voight) - sportscaster whose on-camera tussles with Ali, in which Cosell takes all the comedic beatings, masks a deep friendship between the two
'Bundini' Brown (Jamie Foxx) - Ali's moral supporter who has disappointed him in more ways than one
Malcolm X (Mario van Peebles) - influential speaker for the nation of Islam, the catalyst of Ali's Islam conversion, and with whom Ali forged a mutual respect and social beliefs
Cassius Sr.(Giancarlo Esposito) - an artist, and Ali's father though not a very good one in his opinion
Elijah Muhammad (Albert Hall) - the conservative head of the Nation of Islam, and the one responsible for giving Ali his current name
Herbert Muhammad (Barry Shabaka Henley) - son of Elijah, and Ali's not-so-dependable manager
Don King  (Mykelti Williamson) - boxing promoter whose flamboyance is rivaled only by his love of making money
Howard Bingham (Jeffrey Wright) - Ali's no-nonsense agent and best friend
Chauncey Eskridge (Joe Morton) - Ali's reliable attorney
And he is also a ladies' man.  Who can forget his bevy of wives which he has captured in suave but poetic fashion - the first Sonji Roi (Jada Pinkett Smith), the second Belinda Boyd (Nona M. Gaye), and the third Veronica Porsche (Michael Michele) whom he met in Zaire prior to the Ali-Foreman bout but did not marry onscreen.  Plus, the closing lines stated that he took one more wife.  Let's not forget his longsuffering mother Odessa (Candy Ann Brown).
The screenplay covering Ali's prominent moments of his professional career does not deviate from historical facts.  They are presented in three parts: the beginning part details his entry into fame with the Ali-Liston fight, his conversion and name change, and his associations with Macolm X; the middle part focuses on his trials, vindication and the Ali-Frazier fight; the final part culminates on the Ali-Foreman fights.  Director Michael Mann does a terrific job in keeping these three parts distinct.  However, he spotlights almost exclusively on Ali's public life in the final part.  He also included some scenes that are better left out, as they are more unimportant than informative.  Chief among them being cameos by LeVar Burton as Martin Luther King in only one scene - the assassination scene - and Malick Bowens as despotic Zairian president Mobutu dining in his palace.  So we know these two political figures exist, but what purpose do their scenes serve?  Another distraction is the excessive coverage of Malcolm X, which includes his assassination shown in gratuitous gore.  Even with the coverage minimized, his liasons with Ali would still be effectively presented, instead of taking up nearly the entire beginning part.
As the Champ, Will Smith is The Greatest.  He captures the iconic personality perfectly, which Mann successfully translates to film with adept close-up shots while zooming out appropriately to capture Ali's flamboyant speeches.  His boxing sequences are riveting, thanks largely to Michael Bentt, James Toney and Charles Shufford, who play Sonny Liston, Joe Frazier and George Foreman respectively.  They are interspersed with slow motion sequences to heighten the hair-raising tension of getting clobbered by a devastating uppercut.  Although the actual fights themselves are far less dramatic than Mann's version.  Foxx is surprisingly impressive in a non-comedy role, even adding some comedy routines of his own without disrupting the drama.  Another great performance of mention is Voight being almost unrecognizable as Cosell with his conspicuous toupee and his stiff but somewhat goofy portrayal.  Now we know he can do comedy.
""Ali"" concludes immediately after Ali's victory over Foreman, which seems abrupt.  The tensions between the Champ and Belinda was neither fully played out nor resolved.  I was half-expecting it to continue with Ali divorcing her and moving on to marry his third.  Indeed, ""Ali"" certainly floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee, but is overshadowed by Will Smith and the larger-than-life icon that he portrays.
