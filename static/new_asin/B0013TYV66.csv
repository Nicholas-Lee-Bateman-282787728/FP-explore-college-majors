8253093,4,B0013TYV66,"This video delivers what is promised, although three hours is unrealistic for anything other than recording the product and possibly converting it  to the format to be burned to DVD.

Brausch assumes that you have a product in mind, that your DVD burner will work the first time with the software, and that things will go well. Don't count on it if this is a first attempt.

Brausch explains on the DVD that the burn time will take ""a long time,"" and the upload time to the fulfillment company might go hours, even overnight once the product image is burned to DVD.

The necessary software is all available online, as promised, is easy to install, and each step is clearly explained and demonstrated. No complaints there.

Do pay attention to every detail though, as there is no fluff. What sounds like an off-handed comment may be the key to what you are doing wrong. Take notes if you are not an auditory learner. Everything you need to know to follow his path to selling a DVD on Amazon is there if your DVD-R is working.",1203984000,4,1024,4.513513513513513
