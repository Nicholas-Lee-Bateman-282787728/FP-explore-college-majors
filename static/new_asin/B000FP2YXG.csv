If you are reading these reviews and are interested based on the actually pretty decent design on the dvd cover, well get it just for the artwork then, and listen to all these reviewers. I would gamble with a 6 in 10 chance my McDonalds Fries will be cold and soggy, rather than buy this dvd and hope you would find it scary, decent or full of cinematic wonderment. It is utterly repulsive; the script, the reactions on screen, pure 'B' movie talent (for lack of a better word), and even the Japanese should be ashamed of themselves, but then again (for the most part) most of their horror films reak of amaetur fodder anyway, so listen save your well earned dollar. Go Buy 'Brick' instead. You are a fool if you purchase 'Haunted Highway'.",1179446400,,888,4.45398773006135
2581703,3,B000FP2YXG,"I don't know why other writers were so negative. Yes the acting was dreadful but the movie kept my interest. It was great to see someone driven to shear madness. I liked DEAD END better but this was fun to watch in its own sick way. Its only 84 minutes long but there's far worse out there,believe me. A quick story about a photographer Rand Gamble kills wife Laura Putney over a japanese girl Hinano Yoshikawa. He puts wifes body in trunk to dump in Black Lake and makes his journey a living hell. Its a great little movie despite some critical coments made by other writers. YOUR CALL FOLKS",1168819200,3,592,4.390909090909091
2581704,1,B000FP2YXG,Why do I keep doing this to myself?  I find these 'gems' in the video store  fully knowing that they are going to be terrible and still I take them home with me.  This one almost put me to sleep.  Sooooo boring.  If you want a movie in this same vein then go and rent 'Dead End' and leave this one on the shelf.  Or do everyone else a favor and burn it.,1164758400,,353,3.767123287671233
2581705,1,B000FP2YXG,"I went into this movie trying to have an open mind, considering i had heard, at best, mixed things about it. But within the first 15 minutes, i knew it was a mistake to even give it a shot. It looks like a straight to video clunker, and that's basically what it is. the plot is simple. A man driving down a lonely highway at night. There's a love triangle gone awry and much speculation regarding what's in the trunk, and why it's there. But, frankly i didn't care about any of it. The acting is horrible, and the writing is laughable. So, trust me...don't even bother with this one.",1161907200,7,583,4.3090909090909095
2581706,2,B000FP2YXG,"This movie is in English with its major star being an American. However it is a collaborative Japanese effort. As essentially a Japanese horror film, it has some things in common with ""The Grudge."" Here again, we have a haunting who delivers the chills by having her face curtained with hanging hair. I'm not sure why hiding an apparition behind strands of hair is so eerie an effect - but it is.

Also, the premise of driving along a lonely road at night is eerie in and of itself. And when you have a dead body in the trunk of your car - the ride becomes doubly fraught with danger.

The acting is generally wooden. The actress who plays one of the lead love interests is Japanese with a very limited, stilted command of the English language. With so many actors eagerly available to appear in films, I don't know why they can't find some better talent.

So, this film isn't very memorable. But it isn't a complete waste of time. It will make you think twice the next time you load a dead body into your car and head off towards the nearest lake to dispose of it. You'll realize you might just be in for some night terrors along the way.",1159056000,7,1139,4.338028169014085

8125368,1,B000FP2YXG,"I sat through the entire movie to see if there would be something redeeming. Out of my problems with the movie, I have two major ones. First is the dumb cop. He should have been able to tell something bad was going on especially when he saw part of the blood soaked sheet hanging out of the car's trunk. Second is that the ending is obvious from the DVD's tagline - the main character is insane.",1337990400,,395,4.2105263157894735
8125369,2,B000FP2YXG,"Got this for my girlfriend off her wishlist for 5 bucks awhile back.  Yep.  What can you expect for 5 bucks?  The movie was cheesy and it's not about ghosts, so the cover is very misleading, as others have reviewed.  It's about the dude going crazy because he killed his wife.  If I remember correctly.  The acting was terrible.  Cheesy.  Not scary at all.  But for 5 dollars, who cares?  I'll give it 2 stars because it at least entertained us for an hour....  and the cover is cool looking (though it has nothing at all to do with the movie itself).",1315612800,,551,4.303921568627451

It just just SO HORRIBLE it could not get my attention, and I imagine it has seen the light of day for the very last time!",1247356800,,351,3.9857142857142858

8125373,3,B000FP2YXG,"i really thought this movie was going to give me my horror fix. just by looking at the outer cover, you would think that you're in for a creepy time, but nnnooo. so so wrong. it was okay, i have to give it a few props since towards the middle of the film there were some good spook moments. they held my interest, so i can't dog this movie to bad, but other than that...anyway the acting was not so good. the dead wife, was the only good actress, especially when she would just pop out in the middle of nowhere. good one. the whole story's about a guy who's cheating on his wife, they argue, he accidently kills her, and now he has to get rid of the body. well this takes him on a journey in the middle of the night. he starts seeing things, imagining things, and all that good stuff. is it real, or is it guilt? either way, the man's getting what he deserves. could have been a whole lot better, but it was okay. i mean really what can you expect from a low budget film. it's rare you find one that blows you away you know.",1197676800,,1024,4.0492610837438425
8125374,1,B000FP2YXG,"""Haunted Highway"" is a low-budget horror suspense directed by Japanese director. You may expect something scary and creepy like the original version of ""Ring,"" but ""Haunted Highway"" is actually more like a ride to boredom, where nothing but familiar tricks of horror genre happens.

The film is about an American photographer Greg (Rand Gamble) who has an affair with a Japanese model Yumi (Hinano Yoshikawa). Bitter accusation from his wife Amanda (Laura Putney) leads to one accident, which forces Greg to drive on the deserted midnight road to the lake. On the way Greg encounters several weird things that might drive his mind which is already confused to insanity.

To create a gripping suspense or horror using a confined space like a car is a really challenging thing, but judging from the film the filmmaker is not up to the task. From the opening credit (that looks like David Lynch's ""Lost Highway"") to its ending, there is nothing that would interest us. The film uses up all the tricks in its first half, and the inserted flashback scenes (of which content is already suggested in the pre-credit section) are just unnecessary. The film's passable acting and creaky dialogues (especially in the first scene) do not help. Hinano Yoshikawa is not known for her acting talent in Japan, but I never expected she could be that bad.

But probably she should not be blamed because, according to the film's official homepage, her English is dubbed by someone else. That fact makes me wonder why Japanese director Junichi Suzuki decided to make an English-speaking film entirely shot in America while the film's locations and characters do not need to be American (almost all the events on the ""highway"" scenes happen during one night). I know Mr. Suzuki has been living in USA since 2001, but wouldn't it be a better choice for him to shoot a film in Japan where he had been working for a long time?

Anyway I agree with most of the previous reviewers who say ""Haunted Highway"" is a terrible film. It is, and I should have listened to.",1183680000,6,2038,4.797720797720798
8125375,2,B000FP2YXG,"When I write a consumer review of a film, I try to ask myself:  Did this movie deliver what was promised as I understood it from reading the case? First of all, the highway was not haunted, so I was kind of let down there.  Also, as I saw our hero driving I kept thinking: ""What kind of a highway is this?"" Most of the time it was just a single lane through the forest, so it really wasn't a highway as I would describe it. No highway and it wasn't haunted.  Okay, what about the plot?  Actually, it wasn't completely bad, but the title should have been something like 'Road to madness"" or ""Driving me crazy"" or something. Rand Gamble gives a sincere if less than stellar performance as the main character but to tell the truth I liked the girl (Hinano Yoshikawa)he was having the affair with, Yumie.  She alternated between gorgeous and scary.  I also liked the wife, played by Laura Putney.  Not sure why he would be having an affair if he was married to Laura Putney who obviously loved him.  My biggest problem with this film is that it tried to deliver a lot of quick cheap scares, with apparitions appearing and vanishing and of course a hand grabbing the hero in the boat, but there never was any real feeling of terror.  It just did not achieve believability like this could actually be happening.  This film is not a complete waste of time if you've pretty much used up most of the other interesting selections in the video store, but I would not put it on my must see list.",1181692800,,1483,4.340579710144928
8125376,2,B000FP2YXG,"The acting was below average and the main character was none to bright, but there was some decent parts in the middle.  This ""movie"" would have been much better cut down to about 44 minutes and shown on TV.  Not as bad it is being made out to be, but liberal use of fast forward through the filler scences will increase your watching pleasure.",1179964800,,343,4.34375
