8039886,5,B00067IZWW,"If someone wants to learn how GGM wrote his novels, watchs this extraordinary and vivid documental. In his own words!!!",1428105600,,119,5.0
8039887,4,B00067IZWW,"This documentary style biography about GGM is interesting, and there are several scenes where GGM quotes some fun sayings from Columbia.",1400112000,,136,5.523809523809524
8039888,5,B00067IZWW,"It is great to hear how his books came about and what they meant in literature. I also enjoyed the scenography throughout the movie.

Waiting for the biography by Gerald Martin to be made in movie because it relates to all the aspects of Gabo's life and not only the literature point of view.

Great job!",1398556800,,304,4.410714285714286
8039889,5,B00067IZWW,"If you are looking for a mainstream film (see review above), this isn't it.  But it is a lovely biography about Garcia Marquez--and features very hard to find information (at least on film) about his life and work.  Much of it centers around an lengthy interview with GM himself.  I teach GM's works to my AP English students and often show the first ten minutes in class.  Highly recommended!",1362355200,,393,4.6521739130434785
8039890,1,B00067IZWW,"This was the worst bio, I have ever watched and bought.  If there would have been any possibility to return this, as you can if you ordered a hard copy, I WOULD DEFINITELY HAVE DONE SO.  I thought at the time I was purchasing the Love in the Time of Cholera.  What an absolute disappointment.  I deleted it after 15 minutes of watching it.  DO NOT ORDER.",1357257600,,354,4.223880597014926
8039891,4,B00067IZWW,"I had partially conducted my thesis on Gabriel Garcia Marquez, so I found interesting viewing this DVD.

All viewers who have read any of GGM's masterpieces, will get the chance to listen to him talking in person about his childhood, his parents' love story, his colonel grandfather, his inspiration sources as well as his personal and political beliefs.

They will finally see how real Aracataca looks like, Cartagena de Indias, Bogota - and not only - , where GGM was raised and formed on both personal and professional level.

A very well done documentary...",1227571200,18,561,4.946808510638298
