8035133,5,B0002Z9VCG,Great speech! You'll never hear something like this anymore coming from this country. It's intriguing and will surely pull you in.,1525996800,,130,5.238095238095238
8035134,5,B0002Z9VCG,"This is an amazing journey Avakian takes us on. Through history, philosophy, politics, and strategic orientation, Avakian gives hope to the hopeless...and shows that communism has been thoughtfully re-envisioned, building on triumphs of the past, and also being honest about the shortcomings of prior socialist society - Revolution is possible!

Check it out!",1206662400,,359,5.773584905660377
8035135,4,B0002Z9VCG,"I consider myself a socialist. I feel, literally, that mankind is best able to advance humanity when we bind together and work towards a common goal. (8 hour day, public education, paved roads, the flush toilet, etc, etc...)

  There are many flavors of socialism. This series is based on the teachings of Mao. I had had little to no exposure to the teachings of Mao and this series offered me a great format to learn another flavor of socially positive political philosophy.

  The series is engaging and interesting. It is time consuming and at times dry. Avakian the public speaker is not as animate and fun to listen to as say, Dr. Michael Parenti but he is way more engaing than say, Noam Chomsky. Avakian does connect to the blue collar citizen. (At least he did with me and I am an auto mechanic by trade...) He is humorous and enlightning. I feel his analysis of modern industrialised life in America is accurate. While I might disagree with on his points on racism I was delighted to hear him speak his opinions on the ""Drug-War"" and the political use of organized religion!

  I get the sense that being in front of the camera for this lecture may account for any of the stiffness in the teachings and opinions delivered. At times his sense of humor surprised the audience, me and I think even himself. The last disk, the questions and answers portion, is the best. I really felt that by that point the guard was down and the true charcter was allowed to shine through.

  It seems to me that he would be a fun person to have over to the house for a backyard cookout and a couple beers.

  I encourage you to see this series. It can be a lot of fun to Un-learn the crap that was put into your head by the institutionalised learning facility. This is one of the cool stops along the way...",1110067200,13,1798,4.422492401215806
8035136,5,B0002Z9VCG,"I have watched the DVD with many different people, who wanted to check it out based on a desire to change the world, or at least have a better understanding of all the social relations at play now and in the future.  Almost everyone has commented that they did not expect him to be so human, so real and so easy to connect with.  Like people thought it was going to be a long speech about how great commumism is, and its not boring, and its way beyong something so simple.  There is a question and answer section which is worth watching in its own right, where everything from weed after socialism to what happened to the Black Panther Party and why to the masses react to some outrages and not others, what  compells people into motion is gotten into.  But I would caution that one gets a lot more out of it watching it all the way from the beginning and then the questions, rather than skipping to those sections that concern you most, because you'll miss some relevant history and method otherwise.  If you're really checking out revolutionary communist theroy, this is a must.",1101945600,6,1080,4.48469387755102
8035137,5,B0002Z9VCG,"""I heard Bob Avakian speak last year on the urgent and timely issue of revolution: why it's necessary, why it's possible, and what must be done to bring revolution about.

""Avakian first gave a history of the oppression, exploitation and devastation of Black people from the enslavement of Africans, through segregation, discrimination and continued racism. Then he enlarged from this to humankind's history, to include all people's trials and tribulations at the hands of capitalism and its greed, arrogance, and abuse of power. He condemned this intolerable, unbearable situation--and then Avakian made very clear that another world is possible. His explanation of the workings of the imperialist system--and how the struggle of the people can get rid of it and replace it with a just and equitable society--was powerful and uplifting.

""With what the world is going through right now, this moment is crucial--and liberation must be international. We must stop U.S. imperialism! We must create a vision of that just and equitable world, and collectively work to make it a revolutionary reality. This speech needs to be heard by others. It could take many more people onto the path toward that world liberation.""

[Yuri Kochiyama]

""Just like landmark art work or historically seminal music Bob Avakian's delivery and timing is truly inspiring. The only thing more inspiring is the vision and message he presents to us. Avakian is a revolutionary leader whose voice must be heard far and wide today.""

[Wil-Dog, Jiro and Uli from Ozomatli]

""In times like these, this clear voice for social change is a welcome relief from all the confusion and lies. Listen, and you will truly hear a voice of reason, with sharp analysis and deep understanding, going up against the tide of injustice and oppression. Of crucial importance is the fearless opposition to the rise of the Christian right and its pernicious effect on the political and cultural life in this country. While you might not agree with everything he says, he will challenge you with his insights and a clarion call to what must be done. ""

[Reverend Earl Kooperkamp, Pastor, St. Marys Church, Harlem, NYC]

""As an avowed anarchist, and a committed anti-capitalist, I try to learn from the lessons of history in order to devise better tactics, and recognize viable strategies for overthrowing capitalism. And while I'm an anarchist, I do recognize that in 1917 a small group of revolutionaries did achieve one of, if not the, greatest anti-capitalist transformations in world history. Indeed the Bolshevik Revolution thrilled millions of anti-capitalist anarchists around the world when it occurred, including Emma Goldman. The October revolution was led by a brilliant geo-political analyst, Vladimir Lenin. Having watched this video, I'd say if Lenin were alive today, he'd sound a lot like Bob Avakian. ""

[Alan Minsky, Senior Producer at KPFK in Los Angeles and co-founder of the LA Independent Media Center]

""I highly recommend this talk as a starting place for study or an update to review the Marxist Leninist Maoist approach. Bob Avakian hurls an impassioned, articulate challenge to capitalism and US imperialism. Women's liberation cannot be achieved without defeating these forces, therefore Avakian's presentation is an important contribution.""

[Carol Downer, Founder, Federation of Feminist Women's Health Centers]

""Whatever your political orientation or religious background, this comes across as a challenge that must be heard and wrestled with. There is great depth and seriousness in Bob Avakian's analysis of a situation which most of us have failed to fully recognize. But he is confident that we can create a viable future for the planet. ""

[Reverend George W. Webber, President Emeritus, New York Theological Seminary]

Two comments from Dr. Juan Gomez Quinonez:

""If you care critically about the present state of the world and the world's future you have lived lessons learning why and thought a good while on what needs to be done to change the world. Bob Avakian, an activist and thinker, leads you through a tough course, including beginning lessons and advanced sections, on a critical review and assessment on why the human predicament of today and offers an alternative vision for tomorrow than the one imposed by the system's institution. ""

[Dr. Juan Gomez Quinonez, historian and writer, UCLA]

""Bob Avakian, a thinker and activist of remarkable critical insights, sums up the lessons he has learned and the conclusions he has determined during more than thirty years of activism and leadership and guides present and future activists through a tough course which leads to the understanding of the imperatives for a new society. ""

[Dr. Juan Gomez Quinonez, historian and writer, UCLA]

""If my people had a leader like this, we would have been free a long time ago.""

[A young worker from the Mixtec national minority of Mexico]

""Quite frankly, many people have never heard anyone say the things Chairman Avakian said, or have ever heard anyone talk about this world, this social system, this society, and another possible society and way of living in the way he did before. This talk addressed questions that literally millions of people all over the world are agonizing over at this moment.""

[A communist artist]

""He was showing the kind of system we live in and what it does to all humanity... he was inviting people to rise up their sights, their views and look at things at this moment of history we're in and the need to transform and change things.""

[A young construction worker from Latin America]

""He speaks from the heart and at the same time with such a sweeping understanding, with total resolution, and not just with hatred for the bourgeoisie but confidence in the masses of people.""

[a young immigrant woman from South Asia]

""A journey to be savored.""
