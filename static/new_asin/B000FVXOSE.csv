2592745,3,B000FVXOSE,"This is about a girl (Preity Zinta) with guts who is loved by her long-term male friend (Chandrachur Singh)- though she doesn't feel the same. She instead falls in love with a commitment-phobic cad (Saif Ali Khan)who has never been in love (if you see the mother you'll see the probable reason for that!) She becomes pregnant and he refuses to marry her. This is a time and society where being a single Mum is taboo and Indian women usually face the choice of suicide or abortion (if they aren't murdered by their shamed families). Custom is family should cast her out or be treated as pariahs themselves. This movie looks at unconventional choices made within that context and points to more loving, enlightened choices.
This isn't a bad little Bollywood pot-boiler. The music was unmemorable but the performances good and emotions are aroused. They examine the social issue well too. It is a movie with heart. Perhaps this is one of Prity's earlier forays into social issues and she seems to like drawing women's issues to the forefront (It would be later than this that she again got pregnant out of wedlock to Saif in Salaam Namaste)
The DVD subtitles and synchronising between speech and visual slipped on occasion. At one point there was a lot spoken before a subtitle appeared to explain it. However it settled itself down. Later the lack of synchronisation hit a few times.
If the story sounds a bit too serious, be assured it is treated with the usual popular Bollywood melodrama touch for accessibility to its target audience. Most of the protagonists end up doing the right thing or becoming better people. If you find that unreal - that's Bollywood. If you like the way Bollywood does fables and modern-day morality plays well that's the style.
Elsewhere on the Net it gets average to a little above average. The actors made it watchable and the resolution of the story was a satisfying one so I think in the end this will be one I'll hang onto.",1240617600,,1957,4.708454810495627

8127431,5,B000FVXOSE,"Very well acted. It's a look into a different culture where a unmarried woman can be killed for getting pregnant and the attitude of her parents was so sad, ""abort it' Her parents begging the boy to marry their daughter and him humiliating her father, made me want to reach through the TV and choke him.",1455580800,,303,4.428571428571429

8127433,5,B000FVXOSE,I LIKED THIS FILM AS WELL.  SUCH STRICT HINDU CULTURE ESPECIALLY BEING PREGNANT AND NOT MARRIED.  BEING SHUNNED BY FAMILY AND THE COMMUNITY BUT; I WAS VERY HAPPY AND GLAD THAT HER FAMILY WENT OUT TO LOOK FOR HER AND BRING HER BACK HOME.  TOUCHING.  I WAS ALSO PLEASED THAT SHE DID NOT MARRY THE FATHER OF HER CHILD AND THAT SHE CHOSE TO MARRY THE ONE TRUE FRIEND THAT STOOD BY HER SIDE THROUGHOUT HER PREGNANCY.  BEAUTIFUL MOVIE.,1442620800,,429,4.379746835443038

8127435,4,B000FVXOSE,"I love this movie. Old memories. I was one of the extras in the movie when I worked part time as a collage student in India. Great experience and hence, I'm biased LOL",1390003200,,167,4.090909090909091

8127437,2,B000FVXOSE,"My major issue  with this movie is that Saif Ali Khan is not a nice guy in this movie, which made me sad. He's a great actor, and the movie, was okay. My major problem is that the summary was misleading; you never want Saif and the girl to get together since he is such a creep!",1355443200,,278,3.8771929824561404
8127438,4,B000FVXOSE,"This is a lovely Indian commercial film. Great songs, nice story, nice script and good actors. The film addresses a rather controversial topic by portraying a very young girl who gets pregnant, and when her boyfriend does not wish to take responsibility for his actions, she firmly decides to give birth to her baby and fight all the social prejudice, including the initial opposition of her own parents. The film is interesting and engaging.",1304467200,,442,4.986486486486487
8127439,5,B000FVXOSE,"Bollywood went through a significant change in style around the year 2000 when this film came out, especially in the sytle of music. This film is sort of evidence of that change, having elements of both the old and new styles. In my opinion, the music wasn't the most memorable, though I do love what they did with the title theme interwoven throughout the story. The true virtue of this film is gripping story (and the young Preity of course). This film is certainly a pro-life film (perhaps the best that has been done to date in any country), but also gives an interesting look at the community dynamic when such an important question of morality arises (i.e. how to treat a young girl who gets pregnant out of wedlock.)",1302134400,,723,4.569230769230769
