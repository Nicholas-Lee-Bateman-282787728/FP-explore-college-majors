2934210,1,B000VA4C62,"Pros: Excellent photography of the island and portrayal of the
  foods and spices of Greece.

Cons:  Annoying icon super-imposed in the lower right hand corner
  throughout the whole video. The quality of this video as compared
  to some other less expensive travel videos doesn't rate having
  that sort of advertisement.  Even on tv shows, the network icon
  comes in and out while the program is aired.

  It would have also been nice too see the ingredients
  on the screen in some fashion, as the recipes
  were being made. It would have served better to put the
  brief footage of the wedding at the end or as a special
  segement.  No offense this is supposed to be a cooking
  class video / DVD, right?

Fix those and you'd have a top notch video!",1216166400,4,755,4.515151515151516
2934211,5,B000VA4C62,"As a professional in the culinary world with an interest in healthy Greek food, I really enjoyed this video. I enjoyed learning about the local herbs and the regional dishes. The program is romantic with authentic music, delectable food and beautiful scenery. The host, Cynthia, is a delight and I felt like I was right there in Greece! I have been inspired to get married in Greece September 2008!!",1194912000,2,399,4.797101449275362
2934212,5,B000VA4C62,This video has fantastic scenery and easy to follow recepies.  Cynthia's joy and love for life and good food radiate throught the video.  It's nice to know there is still romance in the world!  Definately a video to watch and enjoy.,1193702400,2,232,4.609756097560975
2934213,4,B000VA4C62,"If you're thinking about a trip to greece or just want an ""in home getaway"" this is  the video for you. Lovely photography of scenic ocean views and you get the flavor and taste of Santorini all in one video.
The color and  layout was fabulous and I just loved Cynthia's enthusiasm for Greek cooking.  It truly looks like a place I'd love to visit and the ""modern day godess"" showed me where to go. Santorini is on my list!",1193702400,2,423,4.2625
2934214,5,B000VA4C62,"Through the eyes of the host (Cynthia) I traveled half way across the world and discovered the incredible Greek Isle of Santorini, some fabulous, tasty treats and how to prepare them....WOW!! What a romantic adventure
this trip was and at a fraction of the cost it would have been to fly there myself. The scenery and views were spectacular and I could almost taste the FOOD!! This was a very sensual experience for me. The cooking class-recipes were so easy to follow and the owner, chef and manager of the restaurant (where the class was held) were so loving and kind. Personally, I would book passage just to sit down at a table in this magnificent eatery...oh yes ! I think it was truly special for the host to offer the viewer an intimate glimpse of her wedding/honeymoon and share her love of Greek culture and food in such a remarkable setting; what a unique and precious gift .... so snap up this DVD....ASAP if you are in the mood for scrumptious food....love & romance and breathaking views.

2934215,5,B000VA4C62,"What a little treasure this dvd is! I was looking forward to viewing this
dvd, as I am of Greek descent and have visited the beautiful island of
Santorini many times. I also enjoy regional Greek Cuisine and found the
recipes and techniques in this dvd very intriguing and I think easily
adaptable for the home chef. The bonus section at the end showcases various
cheeses and herbs of Santorini, and is definitely a visual treat for the
most die-hard foodie!

This dvd features a destination cooking class and takes place on the
dramatic island of Santorini-- which was the also the setting for the
wedding of the filmmakers. Interspersed among the cookery class and food
tips are scenes of the natural beauty of the island, and glimpses of a
tradional Greek Island wedding. I really liked the personal story and felt like I was experiencing the culture of Santorini, and thought the filmmakers did an excellent job incorporating those extra touches into the finished product. Additionally, the scenery is so gorgeous!!!

Finally, I have to say that this dvd also has a sense of humor! The host
(and bride) is really engaging and does a great job of keeping things
flowing and has a very warm and charming personality. I would recommend this dvd for a foodie, a travel fan, or for a fan of romance.""",1193270400,3,1298,4.713656387665198

2934217,5,B000VA4C62,"Santorini Experience,
I liked this DVD because I got an overall picture in my mind of Santorini, which I would hope to visit someday soon. I liked the menu and the cooking demonstration from the restaurant. I found it easy and informative. I liked hearing about the native plants that were used for the recipes. To me, interspersing the photos of the wedding and of this incredibly beautiful island only enhanced the DVD for me. I liked the travelogue that went along with the cooking demo. All in all it was fun and informative to watch.

2934218,2,B000VA4C62,"I was excited to order and view this video ""cooking class"" and learn a good deal about not only the specific regional flora and fauna of this exotic island, but also learn how to use these special elements to create beautiful and tasty meals that are authentic to the region.
However, what I got was a very generic description of stereotypical
Greek culture/cuisine hosted by an American woman who thought it would be cute to do a show on Santorini because she had her wedding cermony there.  The introduction to the program was a photo montage of her wedding; this was followed by segments that included her asking uninformed questions along the lines of the ""stupid American"", which showed her ignorance of Greece and its cuisine, and cooking and wine in general.  The photography was also very amateur; it was filmed by her Greek husband who seemed to think it cute that he could help his wife out on this pet project of hers (he was apparently the enabler of this notion of her as the ""modern goddess"", which is the name of her website.)
All in all, the DVD was unenlightening, unauthentic, and I generally felt embarrassed for both the hostess and her photographer.",1191974400,6,1170,4.702439024390244
8217685,1,B000VA4C62,"This is NOT a cooking class...it is watching a VERY amateur videographer and supposed ""modern day goddess"" giggle her way around a restaurant..they don't even bother to mike the chef or the restaurant owner's daughter so what few instructions you get are hard to hear since they are only picked up by the video mike.  Video quality is the worst I've ever seen.  It's actually embarrassing to watch!",1517011200,,398,4.838235294117647

8217688,1,B000VA4C62,Save your money.  It is not a professionally done DVD.  The music is louder than the speaker at times.  There is a lady that interprets and she is heavily accented as well.  Ummm... ok?  There is a lot of footage about the hosts wedding.  Did I really need to see that?  If you are looking for a lot of Greek cooking samples (I was) this is NOT the DVD to purchase.  I only wish I could return it for full price.,1433635200,,412,4.0

8217692,5,B000VA4C62,"This DVD appeals to every sense you have (well you can almost taste and smell the divine meals served).  It is filled with the sheer beauty of the island, with views of the Mediterranean and white walled buildings of the town, with the love of travel and romance. Cynthia Daddona, the host, is as lovely as the experience she gives us. She shines on camera and you just can't take your eyes off her. First we see her wedding to Jim in traditional Greek style. Their love and happiness together are enhanced by the white buildings and blue domes. Then Cynthia takes us to a top gourmet restaurant and introduces us to the chef who prepares a meal that made my mouth water.  You watch the chef making first a salad  of eggplant stuffed with octopus, next a fava balls appetizer with split peas and tomatoes, then the main course of lamb with mizithra cheese wrapped in grape leaves, flavored with fresh dill, and finally a dessert of small mizithra cheese pies.  All served with divine Greek wines, and we watch our beautiful host and her husband enjoy this meal looking out over the Mediterranean in a setting you never want to leave.  There is also a bonus feature you can click on to get the recipes for these courses.  I am so hungry now I'm leaving this review to go eat some Greek food.  Get this DVD -- it's good for your body and your soul.

8217693,5,B000VA4C62,"Watching "" A Greek Islands Destination Cooking Class"" DVD made me feel like I was on a personal tour with an energetic, warm guide and TV host, Cynthia Daddona. Not only did I get an overview of the main sites of Greece and the beauty of Santorini, I got to participate in a private cooking class. Cynthia's love for the Mediterranean along with her joy, feel and knowledge for Greece is delightful.

8217694,5,B000VA4C62,"The scenery is absolutely stunning--Santorini, Greece is picturesque and the island is full of history, character, and delicious cuisine. Cynthia Daddona, the host of the program, has a charismatic personality on-camera and draws you in with her enthusiasm about Santorini and a selection of its signature dishes. The cooking class featured in the program has a do-it-yourself appeal and you feel as welcome in the kitchen as a family member would be. The dishes featured on the DVD all look mouth-watering and appear to be easy to prepare--which is always a plus. This DVD has a mixture of history, culture, delicious cuisine, and a touch of romance--and the combination works! I highly recommend it. -- E. Melia",1219708800,,713,5.102564102564102
