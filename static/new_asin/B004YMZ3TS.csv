8448630,5,B004YMZ3TS,"I don't know why mun2 discontinued playing the repeats on their channel. This show was the best thing mun2 had on and there were quite a few people who were disappointed. This show, as other people have pointed out, portrays real life. It has great issues that a lot of shows are afraid to touch. All the actresses and actors are top notch. The show can at times be pretty emotional, as any real soap opera or telenovela can be, but the difference in the show is that when compared to North American soap operas, this one, yet again feels more ""real"" and realistic. Although some parts of the show are far fetched, like all the men in their family dying, etc. There's still the feel of magic in it that some soap operas have, but yet again: It still feels more realistic and has issues that people can relate to.",1319414400,4,812,4.3841059602649
