5813488,5,B00DHN8GGW,"One of the best sets in the Criterion Collection: excellent transfers of excellent films, great supplementary materials, different versions of two films (""Stromboli"" and ""Europe 51"") - they differ not only in languages but also in longitude and presence/lack of some scenes. Absolutely necessary for everybody interested seriously in film history.",1386547200,3,347,5.823529411764706
5813489,5,B00DHN8GGW,I am a huge movie fan and had never seen these films of Ingrid Bergman with Roberto Rossellini directing. So far the only one I have watched is Stromboli which was very interesting. If you watch it and then go on to see the extras you will gain a lot of insight as to Rossellini and Bergman and their working together. The difficulty of the working conditions on this island with no electricity. His way of working without a formal script. Criterion films for someone like myself is almost an education in film. Well worth the cost and always well done.,1384646400,11,553,4.485148514851486
5813490,5,B00DHN8GGW,"This is one of the stellar packages from the Criterion Collection. The films have been restored in the best possible condition; as far as can be seen, the films have been rendered so that the flaws which plagued the original prints (bad sound synchronization, cuts from different version according to the country of release, etc.) have been corrected, which was no easy task! Incredible care and diligence have been taken with these films, and the extras are voluminous and entertaining as well as informative. This edition of 3 FILMS BY ROBERTO ROSSELLINI STARRING INGRID BERGMAN was obviously a labor of love for all concerned, but kudos must be given to Ingrid Isolte Rossellini and Isabella Rossellini: they waited until digital technology could fulfill all the restoration aims before allowing these films to be seen in their correct forms. This is a stunning achievement!",1384387200,22,877,5.13986013986014
5813491,5,B00DHN8GGW,I have waited years for great DVD copies of these 3 films. Especially Stromboli my favorite of all of them. This DVD collection shows off these films as they have never been seen before. Plus amazing extras and a gorgeous booklet. If you love Ingrid this is the moterlode of her Italian Rossellini period. My favorite DVD of the year. I recommend it to anyone who admires Rossellini and who adores Saint Ingrid!!!!,1382313600,4,414,4.684931506849315
5813492,4,B00DHN8GGW,"Roberto Rossellini is considered the godfather of Italian neorealism, having inspired the movement with his internationally successful Rome Open City (1945). This film and his next, Paison (1946), utilized the bombed out cities devastated by World War II in order to make films with real locations rather than sets. They also often used non-actors for the roles, so many saw it as a betrayal when Rossellini began working with Swedish actress turned Hollywood star, Ingrid Bergman. The professional relationship quickly became a romantic one, though never entirely private.

  The gossip about their relationship may have tainted audience perception at the time of release, or perhaps it was more of the stylistic departure that Rossellini had taken, but these three films are much more highly regarded today than they were initially received. The romantic and professional partners in film collaborated on six films together, with the three most notable included in this fabulous box set. Stromboli, Europe '51, and Journey to Italy have more in common than simply the star and director, also pairing together quite nicely as a trilogy of films about the difficulties of marriage.

  Stromboli (1950) is a bleak drama about a woman who is literally trapped in her marriage, stuck on a volcanic island with a man whom she married as an escape plan. In her first collaboration with the Italian filmmaker, Bergman plays a Lithuanian refugee who marries an Italian fisherman (Mario Vitale) as a way of leaving the prisoner of war camp she is trapped in. Unaware that she is trading one prison for another; her husband takes her back to his isolated village on a volcanic island off the coast of Sicily. What begins as a marriage of convenience becomes a cruel trap for both parties.

  Europe '51 (1952) plays down the aspects of marriage compared to the other two films in this set, though it clearly shows a breakdown in familial bliss when the bourgeois ideology of consumerism is not enough to keep the family together. The movie begins with a dinner party which has a couple of socialites too preoccupied to tend to their needy child. When this neglect leads to a suicide attempt and subsequent death, the child's mother, Irene (Bergman), is forced to look at the world differently. Suddenly aware of the suffering around her, Irene becomes dedicated to a self-sacrificial lifestyle which inevitably leads to her demise. The final bleak message of the film is that too much generosity and good will may be construed as mental illness in the world we live in.

  Journey to Italy (1954) was the most commercially viable of Rossellini's collaborations with Bergman, charting the decline of marital bliss between an English husband and wife (Bergman and George Sanders) on a road trip in the country near Naples. This is also the film which receives the most attention in this set, with a second disc exclusively for the supplements while the other films had only one.

  All three movies are presented with digital restoration and the original monaural soundtrack. Stromboli is presented with a 4K digital restoration, and also has a 2K digital restoration of the Italian-language version, Stromboli terra di Dio. Europe '51 is also available in two versions: a 2K digital restoration of the English-language version and a high-definition restoration of the Italian-language version, which is 9 minutes longer and a different cut of the same material. There is only one version of Journey to Italy, presented with a 4K digital restoration and uncompressed monaural soundtrack.

  All three films come with an optional introduction by Rossellini, as well as a plethora of other features with film critics and filmmakers alike praising the collaborations between these two international legends, including new interviews with film critic Adriano Apr&agrave;. Stromboli also has a making-of documentary from 1998 and Europe '51 has a new interview with film historian Elena Dagrada on the alternate versions of the film. Journey to Italy has a commentary track with film scholar Laura Mulvey, as well as new interviews from a handful of scholars and experts. The second disc has even more, including an additional short film directed by Rossellini and starring Bergman, and a documentary about each of them. There are also more interviews with family members and some home footage.

5813493,5,B00DHN8GGW,"As a longtime, heavy-duty Ingrid Bergman fan, I have been waiting and hoping for years for Criterion to produce a definitive box-set of the Bergman-Rossellini films.  I am absolutely thrilled about this set, both for the films themselves and for the copious extras.

Now I just hope that the two Bergman-Rossellini films missing from this set -- JOAN OF ARC AT THE STAKE (1954) and FEAR (1955) -- will follow very shortly.  They are equally worthy of inclusion in a collection like this one.",1376524800,28,491,4.821428571428571

8593298,5,B00DHN8GGW,I was privileged to get to view these movies recently and found them to be excellent. I had never seen Roberto Rossellini movies before and these were outstanding. Ingrid Bergman remains a star in my estimation always - whether she is made up to be beautiful or plain. She is a star among stars and these movies should not be missed.,1445212800,,333,4.475409836065574

8593300,5,B00DHN8GGW,"plus europe 51 which is I think only available here.

Criterion did a fantastic transfer.  If your serious about cinema you should purchase this

The footage of the director in his continental mode introducing the films is almost alone worth the price",1415577600,2,251,4.928571428571429
8593301,4,B00DHN8GGW,"ALWAYS GOOD CLASSIC MOVIES,INGRID BERGMAN IS SIMPLY GREAT!",1404691200,,58,6.375
8593302,5,B00DHN8GGW,"Ingid Bergman and Rossellini take cinema by storm and come up with Europa 51, one her very best with him..a heart-wrenching portrait of a woman supposedly losing her mind, as she begins to communicate with the world 'out there'

The religious dimensions are always challenging in Rossellini's work, and none so much as with these three films.

Il Viaggio in Italia is a masterpiece..a study of a marrigae with an ending that is shattering. NB, do not overlook the tour of the museum with Bergman and her guide, or the visit to the skulls!! Pompey also!!

Stromboli, a real volcano, tempts Ingrid with its heat and power. A priest is involved, a young sailor, and her desire to get off this island that is a sort of hell or heaven or what?.

This is what Bergman gave up Hollyuwoo for and was she on target. No longer Sister Ingrid in that Bells of St Mary, but an actress with powerful material to deal with, interpret, and a great director.

Do not miss Rossellini's ""St, Francis"" a gem.",1403654400,7,988,4.559322033898305
8593303,3,B00DHN8GGW,"Ingrid Bergman had the natural ability, talent, to make even a poor film worth watching. Replace any of the Rossellini-Bergman films with any other actress, and these films become truly forgettable. Even Ingrid Bergman said in her autobiography that her collaboration with Rossellini turned out to be a disappointment in quality of films produced. So keep expectations low when watching these, and enjoy the magic of a great actress giving the dullest of films some life.",1393286400,4,471,5.2105263157894735
8593304,3,B00DHN8GGW,"Roberto Rossellini must have been a genius, because in these films he achieved a miracle -- he made Ingrid Bregman look homely! I rather enjoy Stromboli, but I suspect it's significant that that was the only one of the three to have been released in the United States. The others were tedious beyond words. Really, who cares about people like those?",1392854400,4,349,4.737704918032787
8593305,5,B00DHN8GGW,These three films are incredible. They live up to their name of neo-realism cinema. A must for any serious film buff to see.,1391299200,,124,4.434782608695652
8593306,5,B00DHN8GGW,"What is really impressive watching these three movies is that, at that time, Rossellini had already stormed the world with his War Trilogy.

Therefore, counting on a celebrated Hollywood star like Ingrid Bergman, he could have had the world at his feet and made few lucrative blockbusters, consolidating his fame and personal fortune.

He decided instead to go his own way, making these three difficult, courageous, delicate and amazing films.

In my opinion, this second trilogy is probably the highest cinematic work of Rossellini, the true masterpiece of his art and of his life.

How could, for instance, a cinema lover miss ""Viaggio in Italia"", the fascinating tale of ""rediscovering love""?

Missing these works of Rossellini would be like studying literature and missing the main works of Dante or Shakespeare.",1387238400,3,816,5.246153846153846
