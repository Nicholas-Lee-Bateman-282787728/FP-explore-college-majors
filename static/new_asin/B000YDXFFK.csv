The other reviewer speaks from frustration at her waning ability to make any of these fractals; sadly, I bet she would have done a lovely job and made a piece to admire and be proud of some years ago.

For me, it's likely too time-intensive to make a fractal. There are so, so many different colors and the most tedious thing in stitching is threading the needle. You are encouraged to move methodically through the graph, block by block. In each 10 by 10 block of 100 stitches, there can be 15 color changes. Too much!! However, if you are going to tackle a fractal--or other complicated project--use 2 highlighters. I highlight a little block with one symbol--not restricting myself to horizontal rows--in yellow. Once I have completed it, I use a pink or orange highlighter to show it's done. If you rely on one color only, you won't know where to pick it up after you last put the fabric down.

If you're determined to stitch a fractal, perhaps the most difficult thing will be to choose which one!",1425513600,3,1162,4.608695652173913

I tried to do one and became so horribly frustrated I quit.  Cross Stitcheing is my love and I don't EVER want to do something that frustrates me so totally as these did.  Maybe in my next life. . .  . . . . . . . .",1415491200,,365,3.7866666666666666
