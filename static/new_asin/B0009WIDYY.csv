The Cuban Motion, looks a little odd in slow motion, but Vicki pulls it off, can't say the same about her partner however. It helps make the dance and they certainly give you enough instruction on how to do it, probably too much for my liking though. Anyone will know the basics after watching this video, just wish more moves were shown. Would buy an intermediate or advanced tape if they offered it.
Need more moves !!
Still deserves a 4 star rating for it's value to learn the basics of this wonderful Latin dance.",1029974400,9,594,4.5092592592592595

8068305,5,B0009WIDYY,it covers basics and is easy to follow. the instruct speaks clearly. would recommend it to anyone wanting to learn.,1403481600,,115,4.8
8068306,3,B0009WIDYY,"They are good instructors, but after the basic Box step, the only other useful step is the ""Fifth Position Break."" Counting a ""turn"" as a separate step is a bit of a joke.  The ""Cuban Walks"" are mostly used to enter the dance floor in rhythm.",1360540800,2,242,4.260869565217392
8068307,3,B0009WIDYY,"Good for the beginner, but my wife was looking for something more advanced. Simple, easy to follow steps and instructions. If you are starting out with dance, this is a good one.",1356825600,,178,4.59375
8068308,5,B0009WIDYY,"My wife and I took a few Beginner lessons recently and were not making much progress. Vicki and Ron's instruction was clear and easy to follow unlike our live instructors. Learning the Cuban Rhumba Box steps and other steps gave us enough to start dancing and develop variations that come naturally. We don't want to become Ball Room Dancers, just be able to to do some Latin Dancing and the Rhumba is where it all starts.h
I believe we'll still take lessons but now we have something to practice with when we get home.",1199145600,4,519,4.531914893617022
8068309,2,B0009WIDYY,"Having bought about a dozen other dance DVDs from Amazon, I was dissapointed with this one.  All though Vicki Regan's DVD is very professional, the instructors are excellent, all smiles and very encouraging for the student the reality is that the amount of content is very lacking.  After learning everything on this DVD you will know enougg Rhumba to dance for about 30 seconds and then you will have to start repeating yourself.  In comparison to other Amazon DVDs and other instructors the content is significantly less.  If you buy cheap then you get cheap.  If I had to do it again I wouldn't have bought this DVD.",1198368000,4,619,4.694444444444445
8068310,4,B0009WIDYY,"The only problem with this DVD considering its price is that even though it is only about one dance, it doesn't take you to the intermediate and advanced level. Vicki Regan and Ron De Vito have a nice smooth way of dancing and are good instructors too. Ron gives a little bit too much of encouragement and bravos to the potential student watching the DVD; it is weird when you are laying down on your couch watching them!! The instructional pace is great, there is an effort to adjust the view for more difficult positions, and the music is good. Explanations go a little further than the steps, mostly regarding the hip movement. So it is a good DVD for beginners.",1126396800,16,665,4.5041322314049586
