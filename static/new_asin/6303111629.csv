The section on disc 1 about Joe Kennedy's mob connections from running illegal booze during prohibition and the well documented theory of mafia involvement in the JFK assassination is worth the price of admission.  Highly recommended!",1153008000,7,306,5.7555555555555555

586182,1,6303111629,"If you're seriously interested in the true history of the Mafia (as in the Sicilian/Italian group), look elsewhere.  This film is a joke.  To start, the entire basis of the film seems to be that organized crime started with the Italians, and that it started in Prohibition.  This is most definitely not the case, and the backing for this can be found elsewhere.  Second, their ""historians"" are a bit shady, with one of their favorites being a ""western"" looking guy who is constantly wearing aviator's sunglasses.  His only credentials are that he's a ""Mafia historian"".

For those that believe the Hollywood stereotypes, you may enjoy this film because I'm not sure they have any historical references that don't include ""directed by"", ""produced by"", or ""starring"". If I remember correctly, the only clips from an educated historian (or possibly historians) they interviiewed were completely hacked together to only use the parts of a sentence they wanted heard.  The editing was even cheaply done, so it wasn't even disguised.

This film is very poorly done, and is a disrespect to any person of Italian descent.  It only perpetuates the stereotypes of the Italian people, based off of Hollywood's portrayal of them throughout time.",1134604800,7,1233,5.0945273631840795
586183,4,6303111629,"Had this documentary been called ""The Birth of Organized Crime in America,"" I would have given it 5 stars because that's all it does (and very well, I might add). I suspect the title ""Mafia"" was used to appeal to the rookie drug dealer who wants to learn how to improve his business but is too stupid to read a book and as such looks for DVDs with the word ""Mafia"" in it.

But seriously folks, this DVD tells a good story about the birth of OC in the US of A, but even then does not talk about Murder Inc. (the crew from Brooklyn that traveled around the country assassinating people for the Mafia - 2000 in all), the Gangs of New York (not the cheesy Leonardio De-Faggio version), and the gangster underworld (featuring people like Kid Twist and Mose) that came immediately before the birth of the 5 families.

586280,4,6303111629,"I buy a lot of Books and DVDs about Organized Crime, the Mafia, La Cosa Nostra. For me it's a passion, more than just entertainment. Since last year, I bought over 10 documentaries about the Mafia. I recently bought this one, ""Mafia - The History of the Mob in America"", and I wasn't disappointed by it.

Starting with the Prohibition years, this groundbreaking investigation traces the origins of the ethnic gangs that dominated criminal activities by turning them into family enterprises. Leading historians recall how they changed the face of crime in America. Meet legendary figures and trace their exploits through rare photos, footage and period accounts. Get the real story behind the Kennedy connection, and see how the Mob helped to win WWII and piled up huge profits at the same time. On this DVD set you'll find 5 episodes, each episode is 45 minutes long. The episodes are hosted by Bill Kurtis. As always he's doing a great job.

DISC 1
- The Prohibition Years/Birth of the American Mafia: The program covers Prohibition and its profitability in America's big cities, and the arrival of the mob's first families from Sicily. Vintage newsreels and Hollywood re-enactments of mob life tell the story. In addition, a series of flamboyant Mafia historians and enthusiasts give interviews, first-hand accounts, and analyses that fill in the gaps. This collection provides a broad overview of one of the most popular facets of criminology.
- The Kennedys and the Mob: The relationship between the Mafia and the Kennedy family is explored; Joseph Kennedy's past, the possibility that John F. Kennedy might have won the elections because of the mob, and more. Only a few minutes are dedicated to the Kennedy Assassination, so if you're interested in this subject buy another DVD. This show is not about Conspiracy theories around the assassination, it's nothing more than a biography of the Kennedy family. Disappointing episode, I was expecting more.

DISC 2
- Unions and the Mob: The program explores how organized crime attempted to wrestle control of the unions from the Communists. Political connections and mass penetration into the work force are explored. This is by far the most interesting episode of this set. A must see.
- Empire of Crime: This episode shows how organized crime first came to the United States and how it changed and evolved over time. The program covers the beginning of World War II when the mob was in a gold mine of money-making and power-charged opportunities.

Overall this is a solid set. This is not the best documentary series about organized crime available on dvd (CRIME INC is much better), but overall this set will be a good addition to your collection. :)",1335312000,3,2704,4.962472406181015
586281,4,6303111629,"This set is informative and historically accurate. Plenty of actual photos and videos of people and places make it valuable to those who wish to learn more about Organized Crime and it's origins, people and actions.",1291248000,,215,5.0
586282,5,6303111629,"Mafia - The History Of The Mob In America (1993) is essential for
anyone wanting to get a historical grasp of gangsterism in the
USA, without turning to a book. This series aired originally on
the HISTORY channel (digital TV), with Bill Kurtis as host.

The first DVD comprises 3 episodes, running over 45 minutes each,
with professors and book authors commenting on various historical
turning points. There's a modest amount of rare, vintage footage,
mostly assisted by Hollywood movies of the past.

The film is sympathetic to gangsters Jewish, Italian or Irish, for
the simple reason that historically, each group had an axe to
grind, whether it were Gentiles, the Italian central government on
the mainland or the British Orangemen.

It also suggests viewers accept the phenomenon, or at least, be
neutral to it, the argument being that all those gangs did was
meet a demand of the general public for entertainment, alcohol,
narcotics,  showgirls, prostitution and gambling. Those are the
ends that the public demanded, and justified the means used to
achieve them (contraband, mayhem, murder, corruption, payoffs,
etc.)

Booze operations are explained, centering around the independent
but nearby island St Pierre Miquelon, with numerous swift boats
importing goods into the USA under various circumstances. The
Canadian arm of those operations (Sam Bronfman) is also mentioned,
with a higher quality of merchandise. The Bahamas and Cuba were
further supply hubs.

Since those operations were more sophisticated than simple petty
theft, financiers such as Arnold Rothstein got involved, fronting
money around 1919. He also was involved in gambling, bets (perhaps
even, on the World Series.) Meyer Lansky was a close associate.

Owney Madden was involved in the transportation of goods from the
marshes in Delaware to Philadelphia, mainly by truck, although
sustaining losses from ambuses to cargo, etc.

A long stretch of film centers around that city -  the
manufacturing center of the USA, machinery, assembly lines,
products, with a long tradition of a wealthy social class and
influential Republican party- that partied as hard as it worked.
Max Boo Boo Hoff - originally involved in boxing competitions and
the bookie business - diversified into liquor distribution,  from
his pre-existing influence in saloons, political circles,
prostitution, eventually completing the vertical integration
between producer and consumer.

The bullying sustained by renowned performers, dancers, comedians
and musicians was the case in playing for specific nightclubs as
opposed to others (Joey Lewis at the Cotton Club, Milton Berle) in
that, the most famous, notorious and prestigious clubs were all
mob operated and owned and fought for the best attractions.

Task forces created to deal with the problem often ended in
failure, such as from the leadership of Gen Smedley Butler, or
Mabel Willebrandt. This stemmde from the overall indifference of
the population to Prohibition, despite a few successes, such as
the arrest of dozens of high-ranking law administrators taking
money, or 138 officers fired, the destruction of barrels of booze
or raiding hideouts. Perhaps 8% of agents turned to the other
side, joining gangs for more pay.

Originally intended by Protestants to  control other ethnic
groups' behavior, it failed despite increasing liquor prices by a
factor of 15.

The birth of modern-day gangsterism centered around the 60
unloading docks in Brooklyn in 1920-25,  controlled originally by
Irish ethnic workers that extorted money for cargo and ships to
operate safely, without interference or destruction. Wild Bill
Lovett oversaw the ops, but soon after, Peg Leg Lonergan succeeded
him. The latter was overtaken by Frankie Yale, and the Italian
groups. The lack of entitlements from the State by the population,
allowed those groups to earn the gratitude of the destitute and
poor from soup kitchens, vigilantism, and a helpdesk for various
injustices. Al Capone earned his chops at this time, with Yale,
later moving to Chicago.

In Chicago, Capone joined ""Mustache Pete"" John Torrio (meaning,
who a pre-existing gangster from in Sicily, who  moved to the USA
as an adult, to carry on his business ops) and Jim Colosimo. Time
is spent explaining the rivalry and lethal nature of gang warfare
between them  and the Dean O'banyon and Bugs Moran North Side
gang.

Capone uniquely enjoyed the mass media notoriety, honing a public
relations image as a benefactor of the destitute and poor. Control
over 10,000 nightclubs in the area was key, as was superior
firepower and a ruthless monopoly in the underworld. Jake Guzik
acted as Capone's advisor. Events culminated in the St Valentine
Day's massacre, with members impersonating police officers, led by
Anselme and Scolese, later bludgeoned by Capone at a dinner with a
baseball bat. A horse-track operator, O'Hare, cooperated with the
IRS about Capone, but later paid the price with his life. Despite
1.2 million cash being offered to close the investigation, the IRS
pursued it even more.

An analysis of Sicily is made, in terms of many well known
criminals on that Island, showing up suddenly in New York in the
rackets, as recognized by Lieutenant Joe Petrosino. The latter was
assassinated on that island on field research. At the same time,
the Island had its own masterminds and head honchos, deciding on
rules, justice, marriages, judges, law officers, loans, enforcing
contracts, independently of mainland Italy or the central
government's delegates, who not rarely were taken out. The poverty
of the land was an issue, with a sulfur mine one of the few local
job creators.

The New Orleans story is briefly touched upon, as well of arrivees
hired on the docks and fruit and vegetable open markets. The
lamented incident of the population's attack on a dozen Italian
immigrants in jail, pending a trial is told, as well as top cop
Hennessey's fate.

The modus operandi of the underground is illustrated by
Metropolitan Opera House tenor Enric Caruso being extorted
$1,000's of dollars - not an empty threat, in some cases targets
turning up dead.

Joe Masseria with his young turks Lucciano (Lucenia), Costello and
Genovese controlled much of the operations, for a time, when a
rival - Maranzano - arrived from Castellammare. He began looting
trucks and cargo through superior firepower. This culminated with
Joe Adonis, Al Anastasia, Bugsy Siegel and Vito Genovese rubbing
out Masseria in a restaurant, after Ciro Terranova had left early.

A commission of 5 families was setup, but Maranzano ultimately
himself was rubbed out, as Lucciano acted early vs waiting to be
hit (perceived still as a lethal rival). This was done by Jewish
gangsters impersonating government agents.

Some time is spent discussing Murder inc., and Frank Costello's
close relationship with  Joe Kennedy, the latter seen daily at mob
operated restaurants, running up high horse race bet tabs, in
between participating in liquor running and wall street investing.
Key to Roosevelt as a fundraiser, Kennedy was pro-Wall St, and as
such, actively invested in pre-WW2 Germany, later compromising him
in the mind of the voters. Frank Costello maintained close ties
with Meyer Lansky and Bugsy Siegel.

Further, the episode discusses Carlos Marcelo,  the JFK election
and downfall, Hoffa and the teamsters,  Sinatra, Paul D'Amato
(Skinny) and vote rigging, Sam Giancana's influence and power in
the nightclub scene, Fidel Castro arrival at power, resulting in
losses for former gambling bosses on that Island (Rosselini,
Traficante). More is said about the Bay of Pigs failed invasion,
the CIA, wire-tapping operations, etc.

It clarifies how Jack Ruby, who operated nightclubs in Dallas,
hailed from New York, and had hung with Capone and Frankie Yale as
a youth, who was also a cash and gun courier between Cuba and the
mainland. He was a man on a mission to terminate Oswald before the
latter could convincingly state his case that he was a red herring
as alleged hitman in Dallas - Hoffa and Traficante both nodding in
approval of the tragedy at the time.",1261008000,7,8100,5.217257318952234
