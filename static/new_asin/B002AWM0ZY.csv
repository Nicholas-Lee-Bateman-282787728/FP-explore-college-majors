For me that was not only reasonable, but pretty darned compelling. They use reports from astronauts, air traffic controllers, and pilots to back up their theories.",1252368000,4,352,4.883333333333334

3892578,3,B002AWM0ZY,I enjoyed watching the interviews with former UFO intelligence officers from the USA and the U.K.  Some of what they had to say was very interesting and the young female interviewer was really good; asking all the right questions. There's were a lot of cheesey graphics in between the switching between the two interviews which actually made the film less believable. The gentleman from the UK said he had encountered aliens four times; once when he tried to contact an alien telepathically and it worked!  After hearing that I hadt to take his claims with a grain of salt. There is definitely life out there; and as one of the gentlemen said the government is slowly getting us ready to hear that they have found it.,1448323200,,717,4.682539682539683

The CGI ""artists"" they used should have been probed and implanted.  The set designer had to have had this as an ""after school"" project.

It is a shame that such well done interviews had to be ruined by horrible production values.

Looks like you are watching an old broadcast from the 70's, shot in someone's basement, on an old color TV.  The ""special effects"" are laughable.  This film is nothing more than some cheap video recordings of interviews with Pope and Good.

You can watch much better, more interesting video interviews of these men on the Tube of You.

3892613,3,B002AWM0ZY,It was a worthwhile interview however there was a great deal of CG footage mixed with real film/video evidence which cheapend the overall experience (IMHO).

Also absurd claims that US explained crashing of commercial airlines from start of runway to just over the end, as running out of fuel. Really? Maybe this guy is a alien.

Yes, it is a recap of some info, but with new info, I hadn't heard of regarding Edgar Mitchell and a revelation about JFK and the military.  Did he plan on opening up to the public???  I know there were much deeper reasons for his murder and the ridiculous and absurd idea that a lone gunman pulled it off has never, ever held water.  We may be on the verge of a major development with the loss of the Airliner over Malaysia.  Like Mr. Good stated many planes have suffered mishaps or worse because of encounters with these craft.

3892628,3,B002AWM0ZY,"Lies & Deception - UFOs and the Secret Agenda

This DVD is basically a terrific ""X-Files, the Interview,"" an extensive conversation with two UFO researchers, Nick Pope and Timothy Good.  If what they say is true, our world is a very different place than we think it is.  If this kind of material fascinates you, you'll enjoy this DVD stuffed with good information.

Astronauts, air traffic controllers, airline pilots--all have reported seeing UFOs.  Some of these objects have even been tracked on radar, so there's something going on, and there has to be other life out there, just based on the number of stars and planets in the Universe.

But did the US actually shoot down an alien craft, which crashed at Roswell, New Mexico?  And have aliens been retaliating ever since, attacking commercial aircraft?

I don't know, but it's cool to speculate.

What is also interesting is the idea that the governments of the world could actually keep the secret of alien contact for so long.  And then there's the question, ""why?""  Don't they think we can handle it?",1275091200,7,1059,4.8277777777777775
3892629,1,B002AWM0ZY,"When I bought the ""Lies & Deception"" [UFO's & The Secret Agenda]through Amazon, I thought that having Timothy Good and Nick Pope in the presentation it would be a documentary on new evidence on the [USA] Government --and perhaps others--coverup, a secret agenda discovery on the E.T.'s which we all know--whether we like it or not to accept-- that they are indeed here and have been for a very long time. But, no, this is a very poorly prepared documentary which has an unreadable Main Menu, no close captions option, a terrible rap music background at an unbelievable high volume level, and a very poor program where all the information given is the opinions of Mr. Good and Mr. Pope, including, of course, their speculations on the phenomenon.

The UFO's photos and videos are old as Methuselah, same as Mr. Good and Pope's information. The animation and blurred images, including the one everyone knows about the hoax on the alien autopsy, is included therein. What a horrid DVD! I gave it one star because that is the minimum.

Mr. Good says in the lameful interview in the DVD that he is not a journalist, he is just a writer. I read one of his extensive books which I consider good, and I can certainly state that he is a writer...not a journalist and not an investigator of the UFO phenomenon...or E.T. phenomena, which covers all manifestations. And some of his opinions and speculations on this DVD are just that..his opinions and his speculations without references from where he obtained or is deriving or is quoting the information from, as he said once in the DVD to establish credibility, he was using ""clandestine"" sources, but there is no certainty on what he is saying except his right to extrapolate on what it is known on the subject. Extrapolations are not evidence, nor necessarily are validly derived from whatever has been seen on the phenomenon. But... this is a ""free"" world, at least that's what some people say. I certainly think Mr. Good is wrong on some of his conclusions based on what has been established in the phenomenon throughout its manifestations for many years. he certainly needs to investigate, read and analize more.

I do not think the DVD documentary is worth anything. More of the same old stuff. I recommend, in value of organization of the information, the variety and well presented videos, the extensive  valuable interviews, even though the information has been published elsewhere, but for the sake of filing and government participation, etc., the excellent video [DVD] OUT OF THE BLUE. The guys at Reality Films who prepared Lies & Deception should see this DVD and learn how to make a well prepared documentary. Lies and Deception met one of its goals: It is an expensive deception indeed.",1252454400,15,2743,4.829787234042553
