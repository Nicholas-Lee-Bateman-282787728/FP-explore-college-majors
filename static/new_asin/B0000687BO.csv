1722473,5,B0000687BO,"Pride and Prejudice makes it worth it... The ability to watch and rewatch Colin Firth on DVD; simply wonderful... Lorna Doone is an extremely good story... Victoria and Albert was great... However, Tom Jones isn't the best and if you are used to Jeremy Northam in Emma, then it is a bit hard to watch.  Jane Eyre is very well done too.  Looking forward to finding the time to watch the rest!!!  This collection is great for long weekends or when you are sick.  Well worth it.",1027728000,41,475,4.425287356321839
1722502,4,B0000687BO,"My husband purchased this set of dvd's for me for Christmas. He purchased it mainly for the movie, ""Pride and Prejudice."" I have enjoyed most of the other movies in the set, except for ""Tom Jones."" I felt this movie was crass and was absolutely not on the same level as the others. The compilers would've done better to add other Jane Austen movies such as, ""Persuasion,"" into the set. My favorites out of the set are, ""Pride and Prejudice,"" ""Jane Eyre,"" ""Emma"" and ""Victoria and Albert.""",1203552000,2,488,4.620689655172414

I bought this collection for another person and they thoroughly enjoy the DVD's.  I saw Pride and Prejudice many times and its great.  Recently I also viewed Lorna Doone and it too was entertaining and held my attention.

Its a great collection.",1200700800,2,693,7.961038961038961
1722504,5,B0000687BO,"If you love the A & E production of Pride and Prejudice, you have to have this set!  If you have never seen P & P, you REALLY have to have this set!  :)",1197158400,2,152,3.4411764705882355
1722505,5,B0000687BO,"You will just love these, especially if you love the classics.  A&E does an awesome job...don't hesitate to buy these! Although they are all wonderful, my favorites are Pride & Predjudice and Jane Eyre.",1178236800,4,202,4.9411764705882355

1722507,5,B0000687BO,"I bought this set for my retired Mom, on the strength of the Pride and Prejudice.  Much to my delight, I found that we enjoyed the lesser known titles like Lorna Doone far more.",1152748800,9,177,4.205882352941177
1722508,5,B0000687BO,"I bought this set for my teenaged daughter - who really enjoys period films - she, I and my husband have all enjoyed them immensely.  The Scarlet Pimpernel is great fun and this is the best Pride and Prejudice ever.  It's great to have these to lend out to friends as well.",1138752000,10,273,4.230769230769231
1722509,5,B0000687BO,"My wife loves Jane Austen, and this collection includes a version of Pride and Prejudice widely considered the best one. I bought these for her as a gift, not realizing how much I would enjoy them.

For the husband that can get past the stigma of watching Victorian British films, this can be a really enjoyable collection. I've even shed some tears watching these with her (except for Tom Jones, we're not big fans of that one).

This is a very good collection.",1130025600,10,462,4.554216867469879
1722510,5,B0000687BO,"I purchased this collection and all of the movies are terrific.  They are well acted, beautifully portrayed, and the transfer to DVD in most cases is very good.  One drawback is that only Pride & Predjudice comes in Widescreen, however.  All of the other films are in Full Screen.  There are not a lot of extras included with this set, save a few documentaries, but the movies themselves are so well done and enjoyable to watch that the set is very much worth having.  If you enjoy grand period films of classic literature, then you will probably very much enjoy this excellent collection of A&E films.  I especially enjoyed Pride & Predjudice, Lorna Doone,and Tom Jones.",1028937600,74,671,4.741379310344827

Perfect set of movies to watch over and over.  Thank you!",1377648000,,216,4.538461538461538
7963726,4,B0000687BO,"I would give 5 stars to Pride and Prejudice, The Scarlet Pimpernell, Emma, Victoria & Albert, and Jane Eyre.  I didn't like Ivanhoe or Lorna Doone.  I haven't watched Tom Jones yet.  I got this set of movies for such a great price that I'm extremely pleased with this purchase.",1273708800,2,277,4.5
7963727,5,B0000687BO,These films are all classics to be viewed again and again.  Amazon price was a bargain.  Shipping was fast.  These won't always be available so anyone interested needs to consider ordering soon.  Some vendors have already discontinued.,1272240000,,235,5.27027027027027
7963728,2,B0000687BO,"The box was torn and scuffed, and every dvd and case had someone's name written on it in permanent marker. Very misleading to say this was in ""very good"" condition. I would not recommend this seller.",1262563200,,199,4.555555555555555
7963729,5,B0000687BO,"I have not yet had time to watch all EIGHT movies, but have watched 3 so far. Fantastic! As A&E movies always are!!! Unlike many movie makers, A&E remains true to the classic literature, never taking license with story and character. Thanks A&E.

The customer service was excellent. The product arrived just as promised in both timeliness and condition. I trust that all the DVD's will work properly, though I have not had time to view them all at present. I would recommend this product and this seller to anyone! I'm very pleased.",1237248000,,532,4.720430107526882

7963732,4,B0000687BO,"Like the review title says, I bought it solely for the P&P.  I hoped that the other titles would prove to be equally as entertaining and well made.  If you have read the other works, you'll find them to be fairly accurate to the books and well made.  A&E is known for quality programming and this set is a good one to add to any collection.",1227830400,2,340,4.121212121212121
7963733,3,B0000687BO,"The Colin Firth version of P&P is probably the most popular version of P&P and is definitely what influenced me to buy this box set.  Emma and Jane Eyre were also enjoyable but they weren't my favorite adaptations.  As for all the other movies, I don't see myself watching them more than once. I wouldn't recommend buying this entire box set unless you have actually seen all the films already.",1208217600,2,394,4.614285714285714
