8528923,4,B008MD178Q,"I HAVE BOUGHT ALL THE REGULAR 8-HOUR MAXELL TAPES I COULD, ON A MONTHLY BASIS. I NOW HAVE A STASH OF AT LEAST 50 UN-USED 8-HOUR TAPES. I HAVE OVER 500 STACKED FROM FLOOR TO CEILING, WITH STUFF I'VE TAPED OVER THE DECADES. SO I HOPE I CAN BE BELIEVED WHEN I SAY THAT THE MAXELL TAPES ARE GREAT. THE BOX ON THESE S0-CALLED ""PREMIUM"" TAPES, HOWEVER, IS ANOTHER MATTER. YOU PRACTICALLY NEED A PAIR OF PLIERS TO WREST THE TAPE FROM IT'S CLUTCHES. MOST OF YOU PROBABLY KNOW WHAT I MEAN. THE REGULAR 8-HOUR TAPES SLIDE OUT SMOOTHLY FROM THE BOX. NOT THESE SO-CALLED ""PREMIUM""  BOXES. I KEEP SAYING ""PREMIUM"", BECAUSE I CAN DISCERN NO DIFFERENCE IN QUALITY AT ALL. WHICH, I SUPPOSE, IS A GOOD THING. I BUY THESE MAXELL TAPES BECAUSE THE STICKERS ARE MUCH BETTER THAN THOSE OF TDK. THEY ALLOW YOU TO WRITE A LONGER SYNOPSIS OF WHAT'S ENCLOSED ON THE TAPE.",1357084800,,846,4.388535031847134
