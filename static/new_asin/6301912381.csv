375606,4,6301912381,"THERE ARE *TWO* I SAID 2, VHS TAPES CONSTITUTING THIS 1981 MADE-FOR-TV MOVIE about Houston's Hill murders. The listing here says ""Number of tapes: 1"" - that is wrong. Make sure you get both tapes. This viewer finished reading Thomas Thompson's ""Blood and Money"" and was all settled in my armchair having a cozy time watching a Movie that was better than the book when ...
IT STOPPED
and the criminal investigation hadn't even started!
There are TWO tapes, and my seller sold one. I had to wait a whole `nother week.
Young Sam Elliott, alone, as the creepy Dr. Hill, is well worth the price of the set.
But wait!
There's More!
Farrah Fawcett, Katherine Ross, Andy Griffith, and Craig T. Nelson also populate  this well-written screenplay with people prettier than the photos I've seen of the actual participants. There are some stunning cuts and juxtapositions - as when we watch the lid of Joan's exhumed casket being opened and then see Kurth/Ross in a similarly shaped bubble bathtub. The movie is kind to Kurth (the object of John Hill's adulterous affection) as it is based on *her* book (not Thompson's tedious tome.)

This gem needs to be released on DVD - to prevent another catastrophe as befell this reviewer, and to include news footage and updates.

375607,5,6301912381,"What a powerful cast of actors for this movie!  I'm a great Farrah fan, but the fact that this movie is based on a true murder makes it all the more sensational.  It is a long movie, but well worth watching all in one sitting-I did not get bored-in fact, I kept thinking about the real people involved in this case.",1064880000,22,315,4.147540983606557

7816487,5,6301912381,"So more then one person asked if this was on DVD, I hadn't seen it. I saw at one time the VCR version was 100.00 not kidding. The book Blood and Money: A True Story of Murder, Passion, and Power by Thomas Thompson, was so much better then the movie. So much more detail and the story went past where the movie left off. The book is well under 50.00. lol",1515024000,,353,3.9859154929577465
7816488,5,6301912381,Great movie - especially for those of us who have previously read the book Blood & Money + reside in Houston,1416528000,2,108,4.190476190476191

7816490,5,6301912381,"I just bought this movie on VHS recently.  This a great movie, has a lot of great actors--Sam Elloitt and Farah Facett and Katherine Ross.  Although it is from the seventies it still holds up and I question why it is not available on DVD.  It should be.  It is a TV movie but it is really a great one.  I know it would sell on DVD --needs exposure.  While you can, purchase it on VHS---well worth it.",1345766400,12,400,4.064102564102564
7816491,5,6301912381,"The fact that this has not been released on DVD is one of those movie industry mysteries. Much like why no DVD for '55 Days at Peking' or 'The Prize'.  When I saw 'Murder in Texas' on TV 30 years ago I realized I was watching something exceptional. And what set it apart was the gripping performance of one of this country's  finest actors; Sam Elliott. The evil that penetrates through his chilling stares and menacing tone. The scene in the speeding car where, in his drug induced hallucination, he unknowingly replays the murder of his wife (Farah Fawcett) to a terrified Katherine Ross. Amazing acting.  Then there's Andy Griffith, also one of our finest actors, giving a dynamite performance as the heart broken  father of Fawcett, seething with revenge and hatred for Elliott.
When and if this comes out on DVD, I'm buying it instantly.",1329523200,21,842,4.7465753424657535
7816492,5,6301912381,I was checking every few months for this to be available on DVD. I have been checking monthly since the talented Farrah Fawcett passed away for it to come out on DVD. I don't understand it...this was a huge true crime story and actually the first acting job Farrah had (I believe but not 100% sure) after Charlie's Angels that actually showed she could ACT...Sam Elliott and Katherine Ross are divine as always...The story is compelling and shocking even in this day and age...just can't imagine what is preventing its release on DVD.,1314921600,26,534,4.752688172043011
7816493,5,6301912381,"I had the VHS tape years ago and got rid of it when I switched all my movies over to DVD.  I assumed I would be able to get the movie on DVD, but after all these years it hasn't been done.  I am a native Houstonian and would love to get this movie on DVD.  I have no desire for VHS tapes anymore. This movie is about as suspensful as they get.",1247011200,5,343,3.671232876712329
7816494,5,6301912381,"Since this was VHS and somewhat old and made for TV, I wasn't expecting very great quality; however, I was quite surprised it was that good.  Thanks for the quick shipping also.  Will definitely order more!",1246233600,5,206,4.694444444444445
7816495,5,6301912381,"At some point Murder in Texas will be released to DVD. Till then, let's see if we have the patience to wait this one out. I even suspect that a Widescreen format will be a suprise bonus to everyone.",1168473600,5,198,4.102564102564102
