5582225,5,B00BDZV4PQ,"I have been waiting for the rest of the HP seasons to be released. The films are clear and easy to watch. The only critique that I would make on this set is that the episodes listed on the discs is not correct. Hot Dust is actually on disc 1, Slain Cabby on disc 2, Hit and Run is on disc 3, Phony cop is on disc 4.

With that said, any serious Broderick Crawford fan will want this and the other seasons in their collection.

My one wish is that someday, there might be a way to colorize these shows. They are like an historical time capsule for parts of California. Many of the location shots were taken on unfinished highways and back roads that are now very different in appearance.

Happy Viewing Everyone!",1366761600,,711,4.2518518518518515

5582227,5,B00BDZV4PQ,"I purchaced Highway Patrol, season 1, months ago and I have been waiting for more to be released. If you have Season 1 be sure to compare the episodes in 1 and 3. My season 1 and the season 3 advertised above have the same episodes. If you are not careful you could end up with 2 of the same thing. It's obvious that one or the other is mislabled. Now I don't know if I have season 1 or 3.",1361145600,34,389,3.814814814814815
5582228,5,B00BDZV4PQ,"Broderick Crawford is back with Five More DVD Discs of episodes and that means you'd better mind your P's and Q's because he can bark out orders so fast that your belt will snap if you are trying to run away from him and your trousers will drop to your ankles entangling your ability to sprint and therefore fall flat on your face and subsequently be placed under arrest Highway Patrol style. Additionally, you'll look silly in your underwear, and if he's having a bad day he just might slap you with an additional fine for indecent exposure!

I know, I know, what if the criminal is in a car? Well most if not all are in this series, so it's a good thing I imagined that you would ask that question. Dan Matthews (as played by Broderick Crawford but you knew that) gets so mad at lawbreakers that he will do anything in his power to stop them. And let me tell you, he has a LOT in his power. He even sometimes realizes that patrolling the highway in his vehicle is not going to cut it. That's when he...when he...yeah, you guessed it, he radios in for a helicopter!

But traditionalists will be happy to know there are less copters this season than in season 2, so that can only mean one thing; more rubber on the road two fisted action and less airtime spent looking angry at the crooks from up above. Just listen to some of the episode titles in this Season 3:

""Hypo Bandit""!
""Witness Wife""!
""Dead Hunter""!
""Careless Cop""!
""Lady Bandits""!
""Dan's Vacation""!
""Tear Gas Copter""!
""Phony Cop""!
""Dan Sick""!

That's only scratching the surface, mind you, and I didn't want to make any potential customers dizzy or too excited so I didn't list them all.

Suffice to say, if you've seen one episode of this show you need to see them all, so stop reading this review which will become meaningless once you have this box set snuggled next to your knee, the familiar blast of horns announcing each episode's beginning emanating from your television or whatever they call them nowadays, and helicopter lift it into your shopping cart here at Amazon!",1509148800,,2040,4.517615176151762

5582240,5,B00BDZV4PQ,"Although I hadn't seen it since I was a teenager, I recall watching Highway Patrol regularly when I was a youngster. I was curious how well the program would hold up now after half a century of subsequent cop shows. So when I saw that Season 3 was available very cheaply from Edward R Hamilton Bookseller, I bought it. I found the program held my interest surprisingly well, despite its age.

Rather than repeating other viewers' comments, I'll just refer readers to 2 reviews that sum up my experiences quite well (and better than I could). They are the August 13, 2013 review by S. Firtch (Excellent 50s b/w Cop Show - Try it!) and the May 21, 2013 review by Eric Rachut (excellent police procedurals).

When Firtch says the program resembles Dragnet more than Chips, that may be because of its emphasis on police procedures or because it adopts a serious attitude with very little humor and that humor being deadpan.

Regarding Firtch's mention of actors in Highway Patrol that he recognized from other TV programs, let me add William Boyett who plays one of the two ""regular"" deputies in Highway Patrol, but is probably better known to many viewers of police shows as Sergeant MacDonald, the immediate supervisor of Officers Reed and Malloy, on Adam 12.

In a very entertaining way, Firtch implies that, in reality, the Highway Patrol would not have been the agency called in to handle many of the cases portrayed in the program. Since so many of the episodes took place in rural areas, I imagine that the first responders for most of these cases would have actually been a county sheriff's department, not the Highway Patrol.

Although there is very little intentional humor in the program, I did find several instances of unintended humor:

(1) In one episode, Broderick Crawford asks a little girl whether the criminals drove a small car or a big car. However, viewers already know what her reply is going to be. I can't recall seeing a compact car in any of the episodes. As far as cars go, this was the age of dinosaurs with tail fins. It was fun, though, viewing all those early gas guzzlers on the road. (Actually, that's not so different from our current time with those gas-guzzling SUVs.)

(2) Another bit of unintentional humor: whenever the deputies are running on foot, you'll notice that their right hand is often holding their holster down to keep it from flopping about. Was this really a problem with law enforcement equipment at that time?

(3) Another thing that struck me as funny: the unusual hair styles sported by some of the deputy patrol officers. I assume those hair styles were popular at that time, but I do find it difficult to watch those deputies with a straight face.

While I'm on the subject of fashion styles portrayed in the program, I noticed that virtually all of the adult male civilians shown in the program are wearing hats when they are outdoors. Were hats on males still the fashion in the late 1950s, especially in Los Angeles? Although I was young then, I don't recall adult males generally wearing hats.

A minor irritant, due to watching multiple episodes back-to-back on DVD, were the often repetitious send-off messages to the audience by Broderick Crawford at the end of each episode. Most of them seemed inane, but I found one of them rather clever: ""Reckless driving doesn't determine who's right; only who's left!""

Regarding the mislabeling of Seasons 1 and 3 reported in one review, I had no problem with my copy. The first episode in my set was ""Hypo Bandit"" and the last episode was ""Reward"". Readers should note that the episode titles are not displayed in the programs themselves, but only on the Menu screen. So you need to watch part of the program to determine whether the title is correct.

However, there was a different (but not serious) labeling problem with my copy. Disks 1-4 all contain 8 episodes, but Disk 5 only contains 7 episodes. However, the listings on the box and DVD cases show 7 episodes on Disk 1 and 8 episodes on Disks 2-5. So on Disks 2-5, the first episode listed is actually on the preceding disk.

A more irritating flaw is some audio dropouts during 3 episodes.  In the episodes titled ""Police Woman"" and ""Hostage Officer"", there are several dropouts resulting in the loss of a few words of dialog each time. In the episode titled ""The Truckers"", there are several dropouts but they don't affect the dialog, only a momentary loss of background (ambient) noise. Although I found the dialog losses an irritant, there are only about 3 instances of dialog loss in each of 2 episodes. So I felt it was tolerable, considering the very inexpensive price of this set.",1481846400,,4651,4.718865598027127

Sayings such as The careless driver isn't driving his car,he's aiming it,No Matter how new,the safest device in your car is you,Leave your blood at the red cross or your community blood bank,not on the highway,If you care to drive,drive with care,or It isn't what you drive but how you drive that counts.
Broderick Crawford turns in another season of his fast talking,tough guy with a heart. He not only gets the bad guys but his sensitive side comes out in various eps with children or the bereaved. Crawford is helped out in his endeavours by the likes of Harold(spelled Herold)Goodwin,good friend and co star with Buster Keaton in many of his films in the 20s and 30s,Bobby Jordan from the Bowery Boys/Dead End,East Side Kids,Kurt Russell's father Bing,Ken Drake,a regular on Sea Hunt in an uncredited role,Charles Maxwell,Vance Skarstedt who not only wrote eps but co starred also,and many others. You will notice in the credits a costume supervisor Tommy Thompson. He went on to produce the Lucy Show in the 60s.
These eps were written with brevity in mind but to pack the biggest punch in the shortest time possible. And they succeeded brilliantly,despite the short shooting schedule(usually about three days!).TGG has done a great job transferring these onto DVDs. Like the previous season there are the odd sound drop outs,which I can only put down to audio track damage. These are after all almost 60 years old.",1396742400,,1576,4.906367041198502

5582303,5,B00BDZV4PQ,I love all these Highway Patrol movies.. I think the old cars in the movies are as good to watch as the plot itself.  Being a police officer for over 35 years makes this a great gift for other old timers.,1393632000,,204,3.975609756097561
5582304,4,B00BDZV4PQ,"This series is the first place I encountered the ""10"" codes as used over two-way radio before that particular argot spread to CB use. It's a good thing that this series came out long before the computer age, or ""2150"" (the unit number of Chief Dan Matthews) would end up being the pin number of choice for nave fans who would then wonder why their accounts were getting raided. And as Stephen King observed in his novel ""It"", one of the earliest examples of an overweight adventure hero in fiction if you don't count Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe. And if Matthews was a bit of a micro-manager the way he participated personally in arrests (setting an example for the original ""Hawaii Five-O's"" Steve McGarrett)--Matthews was also (as King observed) a tough guy who took no guff from anyone. Let's see if I can remember the narrated intro; ""Whenever the laws of any state are broken, a duly-authorized organization swings into action. It may be called the State Police, the State Troopers, the Militia, the Rangers...or the Highway Patrol. These are the stories of the men who enforce our state laws."" One ongoing sight gag I used to always notice was how the front ends of Ford police cars used in the series would do this slight ""nose dive"" when the units came to a halt. Bad shocks, maybe?

But this series could never have been successful today, since the medical establishment with great fanfare declared obesity to be the greatest American health problem.

5582322,5,B00BDZV4PQ,"For those who don't know about it, this show is not set only on the highway. It's more similar to Dragnet than to CHIPS.  The Highway Patrol in this series serves as general police force, in addition to patrolling the highways.

Someone has robbed your store and taken your 10 year old deaf-mute daughter hostage? Call the Highway Patrol!

Kids play with guns and someone gets hurt? Call the Highway Patrol!

Someone is blackmailing your husband? Call the Highway Patrol!

This was one of my favorite after-school reruns in the early 60's,and I've waited almost 50 years to see it again.  It was worth the wait!  I started with Season 3, because it was the least expensive on the day I ordered from Amazon, and I wanted to see if it was as good as I remembered before I splurged on the more expensive seasons. It turns out that it is better than I recalled!!! Here are things I like about it--in no particular order:

1.  Very good picture and sound quality (way better than when I watched it on tv in the rabbit ears/pre-cable days).  I did not have any quality issues.

2.  Excellent storylines/writing--a complete mystery/crime in only 25 minutes--no wonder Broderick Crawford talks so fast.

3.  Outstanding acting/casting.  Broderick Crawford is so great, and many of the bit players are people I recognize from Perry Mason and other late-50's shows. Some even became more famous - that was a very young Leonard Nimoy in the ""Hot Dust"" episode!

4.  Unexpected examples of strong roles/equal rights for women. In Highway Patrol, women criminals con and kill people, are the brains behind complicated criminal enterprises, and sometimes outsmart the police, just like their male counterparts (and sometimes are even better at it!).  Women officers are called in on dangerous decoy assignments and are as tough as the men.

5.  The 30-minute format is great for watching while doing short tasks, like paying the bills; and the episodes are standalone, so you don't need to know a backstory.

6.  The 2 plastic cases come in a cool matching heavy duty decorated cardboard box.  (that's seasons 2-4--I don't know about season 1.)

I'm going to Amazon to buy the rest of the series!",1375574400,14,2182,4.803763440860215
5582323,5,B00BDZV4PQ,"All your favorite classic cars, and they were NEW.  The quality and clarity of these classics is really incredible.
Crawford tries so hard to be a bad-a**, but spends most of his time looking at maps and figuring out road blocks
on what appears to be an Oregon map.  What is noticeable  is that the policy of ""shoot first"" , ask questions later,
appears in every episode.  But if we could just go back in time and buy a car or two.",1373587200,,431,4.219512195121951

The strong point of the series for me will always be the outdoor filming.",1373500800,,361,4.171428571428572

5582332,5,B00BDZV4PQ,"Highway Patrol, first broadcast from 1955-59, is a show that shouldn't work but does, and for only one reason: Broderick Crawford. Alcoholic, multiple DUI arrests, bloated and overweight, best actor Oscar winner for ""All The King's Men,"" Crawford doesn't play gruff, no-time-for-nonsense, lead character Dan Matthews so much as he channels every middle-aged cop who ever had to spend most of his weary life keeping the highways clean of punks and not-as-smart-as-they-think-they-are-hoodlums. Quick thinking, quick speaking (Crawford fires off the dialogue like bullets from a machine gun; the writers had to write longer scripts because of Crawford's rapid delivery), with an ""I've seen scum like you a thousand times before Mac, and if you think you can fool me, you're stupider than you look"" attitude, Crawford breathes life into bland, uninspired scripts. When Crawford isn't in a scene, you get stuck with grade ""D"" actors and actresses who, I hope, had another career to fall back on. Many of those scenes would be mind-numbing if they went on any longer than they do. But Crawford inevitably leaps back into the scene with all the energy and steely-eyed determination of a battalion of marines heading off to battle and you quickly forget how bad the other actors are. Is it a great series? No. Is it great FUN if you love retro TV (Hey! Look at the cars! The two-way radio!)? YES. Well worth it at this price.",1370476800,5,1418,4.987341772151899

5582335,5,B00BDZV4PQ,"Early TV thrived on clichs-bad guys were bad, good guys were good, and this series is about as black and white as you can get. Broderick Crawford as Highway Patrol Chief Dan Mathews is a total tough guy-he talks so fast you would swear he was still in Brooklyn. The episodes are formulaic, but ultimately satisfying, the good guys ultimately triumph, but the bad guys give it a good shot. The period American atmosphere, and the excellent voiceover make this great entertainment for nostalgia buffs, and those who want to know what it was like to live in early postwar America.  Take special note of how smoggy the landscape is, there is never a clear day in 1950's Southern California.",1369526400,,686,4.716666666666667
5582336,5,B00BDZV4PQ,"It is amazing that a low-budget series of roughly 25 minutes episodes, centered on a pudgy and balding actor playing a highway patrol supervisor, could be so good - but they are!
 Downside:  formulaic - the crime is committed (minor music in background), the highway patrol of an unnamed state (obviously California) is called - sometimes, if you think, inappropriately (the patrol investigates kidnapping??) and, in a few minutes, the crime is invariably solved - no high tech, no fireworks (beyond small arms)- just thinking it through and doing their jobs (maybe this isn't downside).
 Upside - versatile actor Broderick Crawford and his rapid-fire delivery - logical solutions, combining believable procedures and sometimes a clue or two, adult (in the best sense of the word) dialogue, finishing with an incisive line, usually to the crook, by the chief, and then a clever send-off to the audience - blatant violation of today's absurd Civil Religion (intelligent white males running things?!?!?!).  Some of the episodes in the series had Quinn Martin as audio supervisor (later producer of TV's The Fugitive) and I've found one (Oil Lease, Season Two) with the story written by Gene Roddenberry (Star Trek).
 Broderick Crawford had a little problem with the bottle, so the irony is that, because of his series of DUI's, when he's doing the driving, it is often on private backroads (no license).  But, man, he carries the series and it works!

5582345,4,B00BDZV4PQ,"There is a flaw in season 3, at least in the two sets that I had received. Not the flaw some of the other reviews are talking about. If you notice on the box and the disc cover, of Discs 1-5 in Season 3 of Highway Patrol, on Disc 1 it shows that there is suppose to be only 7 shows, and each disc thereafter, has 8 shows. No problem. However, the flaw that bothered me is the shows are not all correctly listed on the disc cover and the box, in relation to what is on the menu and is actually recorded on the discs. For example, on Disc 2 on the box it shows the first show as ""Hot Dust"" but on the disc the episode ""Hot Dust"" is the last show on disc 1. So, in reality Disc 2 starts with ""Witness Wife"" and ends with ""Slain Cabby"" instead of ""Mother's March"". In essence, each disc has the first episode moved over to the previous disc. So, I went and checked to make sure that season 3, was complete which it is. I want my discs to match the cover and the box that they are suppose to be in. The outcome is its 8 episode's on Discs 1-4 and on Disc 5 it has 7 shows, which has I above is fine. Its just that they are misplaced.

So I contacted Amazon, and asked them could they give me a replacement, considering, I had to wait for seasons 2 and 3 for sometime. It surprised me as I received season 4 on its release date and I was very impressed. Also there is another issue with the hubs in the disc case not being secure, mostly in season 3. Where you open the case, the first three discs that are stacked, they were moving loose in the disc case. That causes scratches on the discs, but that is minor. The biggest issue for me was the order of the episodes, not matching. However, also this happened in the replacement set. I kind of expected it would be. As it seemed to be a manufacture error where so many of them in a batch were printed up like that. I asked to them to send them from another distribution center but they did not. It came from the same area in Philadelphia. So, I returned the replacement set on Friday, and kept the original set. Since Amazon did honor my request for a concession, and because I wanted to keep the other set, since this show is difficult to get, and wanted the complete series. I will still give this product a 4 because the set still played well, considering the price. Frankly, If I bought this elsewhere, I would have to pay much more money to get this unless one purchased bootlegged discs, but those can be expensive, which I have from other places, and are a total rip. If there should be more like this they would  need to reprint the discs or change the box, and the disc sleeves to match what is on the actual discs.
