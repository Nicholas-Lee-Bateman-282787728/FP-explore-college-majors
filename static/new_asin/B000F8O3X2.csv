8382747,3,B000F8O3X2,"I can't imagine the negative feedback on this unless all you watch is the main feature, which is meh, probably more exciting if you specifically like the music and the babes in bikinis.  What really kicks it up to 4 stars is the extra photo shoot footage - it gradually gets more daring until it is fully nude and one girl starts doing solo spread eagle kind of stuff, even a bit of rubbing right at the end.  And she is HOT.  And shaved.

My suggestion is to rent the DVD and then make your decision, because if instant video only shows you the main feature, you're missing out, big time.",1421712000,,589,4.2792792792792795

8382750,1,B000F8O3X2,"This is not the 1975 movie of the same title. It looks like they went to one trailer park, and gathered up anyone willing to dance around, poorly, in bikinis. There are very annoying ""special effects"" all over the screen, all the time, like someone got a new toy, and did not know when to stop.
 I only write, my only review, in the hopes of stopping someone else from watching this. I wasted my 2 dollars, please don't do the same.",1360886400,6,432,4.2682926829268295

8382752,2,B000F8O3X2,"This dvd was a total disappointment. I bought this dvd believing that I was going to get uncut music videos with more uncut material with the video chicks one on one, BUT NO!! This dvd has a lot of women whom I have never seen before, a few familiar faces that I have actually seen in music videos. Only three of the women actually get topless in the tease sets and only one got completely nude. But if you admire beautiful women and you enjoy seeing tight hardbody women in bikinis you may like it. There were the obligatory interviews, you know, there education (how many degrees they supposedly have but apparently do not use), there nationality (all 50 origins some of everything, who has time to find that stuff out and DOES IT REALLY MATTER PEOPLE), video appearances (or better yet, T&A appearances), what they look for in a man (which people like me know it is not what they really look for in a man, must of these women end up being baby mamas for R&B singers, because the majority of 'video vixens' really hate rappers, Jay-Z and Snoop Dog excluded) and their future endeavors (which usually ain't much for these women). And there are couple of good songs (FROM UNKNOWN ARTISTS). There's a bonus photo shoot scene in which the two women get nude and that was actually the best part of the dvd, that and one of the trailers. The women get a star and the tracks get a star, and that's it ! Man, I should have waited and paid less for it ($3 would have been reasonable)!",1161388800,3,1477,4.413919413919414
