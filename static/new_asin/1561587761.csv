7796212,4,1561587761,"Worth a view before tackling floor refinishing.  Will definitely learn a lot
of do's and don'ts.  I am a woodworker, but I'm not stupid enough to just jump
into a project outside my areas of expertise without seeing how the pro's do
it.  You might want to hire this particular job out.  After equipment rental,
finishing supplies, one hell of a mess and knees that will never be the same,
I probably saved about enough to get a Big Mac and large fries.  Ha!",1404259200,,457,4.392857142857143
7796213,5,1561587761,I'm simply a Don Bollinger fan and always appreciates his clear and concise approach to communicating his skill and knowledge of installing and refinishing hardwood floors. Good Stuff.,1396051200,,184,5.607142857142857
7796214,3,1561587761,"Well I'm a diy kind of person and needed to refinish 1000sf of solid oak floors.  This was one of the items I purchased in my quest to gain knowledge.  It did help me to see a floor being sanded as compared to reading books about it.  For this reason I didn't mind paying the money.  I purchased the companion book as well.

If you're thinking about doing a floor yourself, buy this, you don't need the book.  Also look on utube for sanding wood floors.  There are excellent videos if you dig long enough.  One was better than this dvd.

btw, the edger is back breaking work.

You can do it!",1208217600,7,591,4.196428571428571
7796215,4,1561587761,"A 43 minute video on hardwood floor sanding and finishing. First off, I would recommend purchasing a book as a reference. The author discusses different sanding machines along with their pros and cons. He then discussed sanding techniques, repairs secondary to sanding errors and then finishing. The video in my opinion is a good compliment to a reference text. The video it should be mentioned does not cover hardwood floor installation. As the title reflects the video covers sanding and finishing and acts as an opening guide for further research. The author discusses and demonstrates what needs to be done, and therefore allows you to decide if you want to pursue sanding and finishing on your own and what types of equipment you will need. Even if you choose not to do the work yourself the section on finishes will provide you with insight into what type of finish you might prefer to have on your hardwood floors.",1164326400,14,921,4.8354430379746836
