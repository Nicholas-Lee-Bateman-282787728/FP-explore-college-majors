I really enjoyed watching it and I ordered the 3rd (final) season. There really is not much cut from these, they are very complete sets. Sorry, no subtitles on these seasons.

Love the music, the Latin pop stars and variety of bands, dancing and the club scene. At some point you know Javier and Isabel will get together, I'm sure of it--season 3 perhaps?!?! I know the story line is over the top, but it really is fun to watch.

My favorite character, of course the bad girl ""Topacio 'La Matadora'"", can't help it, we all love the bad girl, she's not evil like Daniel just on the edge. And I can't believe what a wrong turn Zafiro takes in season 2, wow! Love it makes you really blind and crazy!

I also remembered that this was filmed in 2001 so it's really funny to see how they weave in the endorsements--not too obvious!",1217289600,2,984,4.279569892473118
