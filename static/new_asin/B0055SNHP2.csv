4579650,1,B0055SNHP2,"From reading the reviews, I understand that this movie is about a young girl trying to support her family, and the point is that every girl can be a princess. However, in the trailer, the girls in charm school learn how to pour tea and curtsy, and for every little girl that is in my life, I refuse to let them believe that those things are important to whether or not they are princesses.  You don't become a princess by learning how to be demur, but by learning critical thinking and compassion.  This is so reminiscent of 1950 that it makes me want to scream, and I can't believe the movie is being marketed in this fashion or promoting these ideals for little girls.",1316217600,4,670,4.395161290322581
4579651,4,B0055SNHP2,"My daughters like all the Barbie movies, and this one is no different. It is pretty cute. The animations has greatly improved too. I'll just echo some previous reviewers; it is nice that the villianess isn't a redhead in dark green (what is that all about?), yea for no annoying talking animals, the funny sidekick is actually pretty funny, Barbie's new voice is growing on me, the story is kind of weak but enjoyable enough. Oh, and my three-year-old loves the short feature with the sisters camping, so I'm sure she'll be wanting the Christmas movie with them.",1316131200,4,562,4.744897959183674
4579652,3,B0055SNHP2,"My five year old daughter is particular about what she watches.  Of the previous Barbie movies, she only liked the Mermaid movie and Fashion Fairy Tale.  The last Barbie movie, the one where there were fairies did not appeal to her, but it had nothing to scare her.  This new movie, Charm School, starts out pleasant, but when Blair gets home from work, and we discover her mother is sickly, and needs care, my daughter got concerned.  And then when Blair actually leaves her sick mother and her younger sister to go to a school where she must live, she got upset.  My daughter is dealing with going to kindergarten and being separated from me for the first time, so I think this hit too close to her current personal experiences.  Then when Blair gets to the charm school, she isn't treated kindly by most of the other girls, and again, this upset my daughter.  The ""villain"" of the show is a mother who wants her daughter to become the princess, and she is very unkind to Blair, says and does mean things, and by this point, my daughter wanted it turned off she we never finished it.  As a grown-up, this movie seems to have potential, but if you have an easily upset child, especially one who doesn't want to watch anything mean, unkind or sad, this isn't for you.",1316131200,54,1267,4.454545454545454
4579653,5,B0055SNHP2,"I purchased this for my 4 year old granddaughter, Catherine (a.k.a. the Princess). She owns everything ""Barbie,"" and I'm not exaggerating when I say that I buy new Barbies for her every week.  When she heard in August that this video was being released in September, she asked if I would buy it for her.  She then marked the days on a calendar so she knew when it would arrive, and when it did arrive on Tuesday, September 13, she watched it immediately.  She has now watched it at least 5 times and it's only Thursday.  Not only does she love it, but even her 7 year old sister enjoyed it too.  I like all the Barbie movies because I know they are free of bad language and inappropriate situations.  When she arrives this weekend, I know I will have to watch this with her at least 3 times, but that's OK because it will be a change from her last Barbie movie that I have watched about 50 times.  She is simply enthralled with Barbie.  So if you have a little Barbie fan in your home, order this with confidence because it is certain to entertain.",1316044800,4,1048,4.284263959390863
4579654,4,B0055SNHP2,"I think Barbie is getting a bit better than the last few flops. A Fashion Fairy Tale and A Fairy Secret were horrible. This one is much better a wonderfully engaging story line, stronger characters with heart and a backbone. The animation was good and I liked the fact that it was new characters and not the same old ones recycled over and over again. They still recycle the names though. I miss Kelly Sheridian's voice as Barbie still but the new voice is growing on me. Barbie didn't look as ugly pointy faced either. She looked a bit softer.
The thing that irked me was the dubbing of the voice and the characters mouth movement is off. And my video skipped alot. I am going to exchange it for another one I hope does not skip as much.
I also don't like the fact that Barbie's little sister Kelly's name has been changed to Chelsea now. I think that is terrible. Try explaining that to a five year old who loves the name Kelly and keeps asking why her name changed. Other than the dubbing and skipping the movie is engrossing and fun to watch. Much better guys.",1316044800,2,1064,4.351758793969849
4579655,4,B0055SNHP2,"The latest Barbie movie, Princess Charm School, features the story of hard-working Blair, who is adopted as a young child into a poor family. After her sister enters her into a contest, she wins a scholarship to Princess Charm School, where it is hoped she will earn the skills to become a Lady Royal.

I think there are many positives about this movie.  The animation is I think better than any of the other Barbie movies, and we've seen them all. This movie carries over themes we've seen in other Barbie movies where someone who has acted terribly towards Barbie or other characters experiences a change of heart and is able to become friends with Barbie's character and I think that is great.  Having good character is emphasized as being a desirable trait, and this movie makes I think an invaluable point about confidence: Nobody ""can make you feel inferior without your consent.""

I am however, concerned with the continuing trend of dressing Barbie in skirts that are overly short and that I as an adult would not feel comfortable wearing.  To borrow a phrase Barbie used in ""Fairy Secret,"" they're a little too breezy and certainly not an appropriate model for young children.  The characters in the earlier Barbie movies dressed classier, and in some cases acted in a ways I would feel much more comfortable with my child emulating. I also think some of the ""manny and peddy"" and materialistic swooniness that has crept into the last several Barbie movies, and does indeed show up in this one too, is not so desirable.  A movie can be modern and relevant without so much of these things.

I am also lukewarm about some of the similarities with the Harry Potter story.  Blair's parents are killed in a car crash when she is 1 and she is left on somebody's doorstep.  She returns later to a castle that has magical elements that is supposed to help her reach her true potential.  I also could see some elements of the Princess Diary movies in here. However, I think that while you can see that these might have been some of the inspiration for the story line, it is not blatant forgery, so I think it still passes as a cute and respectable movie.",1316044800,3,2154,4.612565445026178
4579656,4,B0055SNHP2,"After increasingly disappointing installments in the Barbie movies line (they had been going down since Mermaid Tale) Barbie has given us a glimmer of light. Princess Charm School (originally dubbed ""Princess Prep School"" but later changed to the more toddler-friendly ""Charm"") brings back so many of the wonderful, whimsical elements we've grown to love about Barbie. Blair is not a movie star, uber trendy and loaded with cash & fashion. She is not an overly preppy teen whose biggest flaw is that her dress isn't up-to-date. She is a very down-to-earth girl who works hard to keep her family afloat. She has problems that, with the help of a very likeable character, she works through.

Friendship, forgiveness, kindness, family bond, never giving up, discovering your own talents, and overcoming your own obstacles are all celebrated. The animation (Barbie's face in particular) shows great improvement. For the first time since the Three Musketeers, our heroine doesn't look like an alien Bratz doll with bug eyes and a pointy chin! And the ridiculous Sequin has been traded in for Prince, a cute golden retriever. Alexandria Privet is an excellent character, exhibiting confidence and good manners. She is ladylike and kind-- something you don't often see anymore. Blair, too, is humble and sweet. Towards the end, she begins to show a bit of an ""attitude"" and has the mindset that ""the crown is mine, I DESERVE IT"" which is a bit concerning, but she seems to be still worried about her family.

There are really no bad elements in the movie; the disappointments come more in opinion matters. I miss Kelly Sheridan's voice terribly...it's not that Diana Kaarina's voice is bad (although it comes across as annoying and teeny-bopperish), it's more that Kelly IS Barbie and no one- not Diana, not anybody- will ever replace her. Until Mattel gets its corporate head on straight and re-hires Miss Sheridan, Barbie movies will not be the same.
The animation, though with serious improvement, is still somewhat lacking. The faces are still stiff, and the lips and eyes are the only things that move. Hair looks as though it's carved out of stone. And even though all of the positive elements are here, Princess Charm School is aimed for a younger audience. It's sad but true...Mattel has officially decided to move in the Hannah Montana/Victorious/ANT Farm and other fame-crazed young audiences.

So I give it a 4/5. The trailers for the next two upcoming BMs look promising: Perfect Christmas especially, as it features the whole Barbie family. I'm sad though, that after years of Barbie's baby sister being ""Kelly"", she is now ""Chelsea"". (Seriously....what do they have against Kellys?) Barbie in a Mermaid Tale 2 is the other....not quite as excited about this one, although Mermaid Tale was a decent installment. So fellow oldschool Barbie fans, we can only hope and pray (and wait) for Mattel to listen up. Until then, PCS is a great movie that little girls will love. Older girls and mothers, reminiscent of the Princess and the Pauper or Nutcracker will be somewhat disappointed, but of course, we aren't the target audience. And the target audience will not be disappointed--not one bit.",1315785600,53,3196,5.026415094339622
4579657,4,B0055SNHP2,"After a rough patch of less than stellar animation and storytelling (diamond castle, fairy secret), Princess Charm School looks to have been given better production values.  My 8 year old says this is definitely her favorite of the Barbie movies so far (though she misses the movies with songs a lot).

The story theme is simple: every girl has the potential to be a princess.  Blair, an ordinary waitress at a pastry shop in a thinly disguised inner city NY type of location, wins a yearly lottery to attend a prestigious ""Princess Academy"".  There, she deals with rivalry and class difficulties while befriending fellow 'outcasts' in her dorm.  Her main rival, Delancy, and Delancy's mother provide the strife and adversity for Blair as she tries to fit in.  The girls learn that there is a long lost princess and Blair fits the description - but she can claim the title only if she can beat Delancy and her avaricious mother to the throne on coronation day.

Unlike previous Barbie DVDs, the characters are unique to the story and do not look recycled from previous DVDs.  Also, it was nice to see that the main rival, Delancy's mother, was not a red head (though she wore the typical green color of all of the villains in Barbie movies).  And as with Princess Luciana in Island Princess, Barbie will win over the heart of Delancy and foil Delancy's mother's plans to steal the throne of the country.

The characters do resemble their dolls more - though the side characters still have little to do in the movie other than exist as a reason to be a doll.  But the animation of the characters is greatly improved - the 3d animation is less distracting and 'unreal' than in previous DVDs.  It's only until the last frames that the animation looks rushed and much less detailed (dresses move strangely and are lacking shading/realistic details).

The story churns along at a steady pace and has all the Barbie movie hallmarks:  Barbie goes on a quest, Barbie encounters diversity, Barbie trains in a montage, Barbie uses friends and ingenuity to overcome obstacles.  One thing that is clear is that they are appealing to a much younger audience this time: all the Charm School girls wear hairstyles suitable to 6 year olds (ponytails and such).

One big change is that the comic relief sidekick of the villain is actually funny this time - giving one-liners in a deadpan that does bring a smile.

In all, this is much better than the very weak ""Fashion Fairy Tale"" and the dolls that go with the movie are much better quality as well.",1315699200,25,2534,4.683972911963883

Charm school more importantly taught my daughters that they need to have character and confidence. They loved watching Blair transform to becoming a Princess. They loved how after their uniforms got destroyed (by orders of Delaney's mom) that they used their creativity to make new ones. My four year old is heavily into gymnastics and one of Blair's friends did gymnastics in order to get around the laser security, which she thought was awesome.

4580008,3,B0055SNHP2,"This Barbie movie is all right. Blair, the main character, goes to live at a school. It is unrealistic in the fact that she immediately becomes best friends with her roommates without even getting to know them. This displays special needs, because some special needs people immediately think that everyone is their friend. I think Blair can be cheesy, because when she decides to leave for charm school, she says with a dramatic head movement, ""I'LL GO!!!"" She is klutzy, and constantly falls over things. She isn't confident in herself, and beats herself up all the time with comments like, ""I can't. I can't do it!"" and ""I cannot do ANYTHING she can do."" This is a bad example. She leaves behind her sick mother and little sister in the poor areas to go live in some prim-and-proper school, even though she has already mentioned how un-princess-like she is. And another thing...she is doing absolutely horrible and failing all her charm school classes, then discovers she is the long lost princess Sophia, so she automatically passes all her classes witout working at it. Also, a girl named Delancey (the bully) has a dimwitted friend named Portia. When the girls are practicing walking with books on their heads, Portia does nothing but hold the book with both hands ABOVE her head, and the teacher doesn't correct her so she can learn. She simply says, ""You're doing fine."" This movie could seriously damage some kids' confidence about going to school...this movie has bullies, mean teachers, confidence-destroying, leaving behind sick mothers, failing classes but passing school, cheating in the lottery, EVERYTHING! If I was little, I would never want to step foot in school EVER AGAIN. They also present the idea that all princesses do is wear pretty gowns and have tea parties. That's all I have to say.",1364256000,,1811,4.921568627450981

4580143,4,B0055SNHP2,"Sorry, you can't have my Man Card. You're gonna have to pry it from my cold dead hands. In the meantime, I'll be talking up BARBIE: PRINCESS CHARM SCHOOL. Them evil masterminds over at Mattel have got a good thing going with their series of watchable, wholesome animated films which stars everyone's favorite fashion doll Barbie. It says something that when my tired nieces fell asleep during the screening of this, I kept on watching.

First, it's interesting that the Kingdom of Gardania is a blend of modern day world and fairy tale tropes. Cell phones rubbing elbows with enchanted tiaras. In the bustling metropolis Blair Willows toils hard as a cafe waitress, trying to earn enough money to move her family from the poor side of town and provide better medication for her ailing mother. Her big chance comes along when her little sister enters her name in the Princess Charm School lottery and her name is drawn from the pool. Each year one commoner is invited in on that lottery scholarship, except that only 27% of the lottery girls make it thru the semester. If Blair can somehow graduate, she has an opportunity to land financial security as a lady royal.

Blair is enthusiastic and friendly, but not exactly up to snuff when it comes to royal etiquette. She can balance a precarious serving tray on her palm but not a stack of books on her noggin whilst walking. As the supportive head mistress notes, Blair has oodles of character but lacks a princess' grace. A despondent Blair remarks: ""I'm like a burp in a symphony."" Heh. It doesn't help that the school's most influential princess-in-training persists in ridiculing her. Maybe the whisperings about a vanished princess have something to do with it? Especially since one royal instructor happens to have marked the resemblance between Blair and the lost heiress to the throne.

I liked the contemporary spin put into the story, although, at the same time, enough of the traditional fairy tale elements are retained. No wonder my nieces are hooked on these Barbie movies. With this one, they particularly appreciated the notion of the tiny flying fairies serving as personal assistants to the students. The CG animation is solid and fluid enough, if not spectacular. The key thing is that the visuals don't detract from the story. Barbie as Blair Willows is every little girl's ideal role model. Blair does get down on herself, but never too much, and she always snaps out of her doldrums. She has a forgiving nature, realizing that folks deserve a second chance. She ends up making friends who stand by her. She and her two roommates - two offbeat princesses-in-training - are soon thick as thieves and embarking on a caper to find the lost royal. Just goes to show, so long as you have character, attributes such as poise and class and a regal demeanor sort of naturally fall into place.

- Fake outtakes
- ""You Can Tell She's A Princess"" Music Video

4580145,1,B0055SNHP2,"Where to begin! This movie was horrific. It started out well enough, hard working ""Barbie"" supporting her family.

Then Charm School begins. I have nothing good to say. Bullies, both among peers and teachers. Mean girl behavior. Strict focus that appearance is all that matters. Princesses lessons that consist of tea pouring and curtsies, because obviously that's all princesses are good for. ""Barbie"" has the self confidence of a jelly fish. Worst yet? At the end of the movie she gives her bully a coveted position as a reward for ""helping"" her. Help, which comes by the way in the form of leaving a window open so ""Barbie"" can commit a home invasion in the name of the greater good. Her two best pals who stuck by her and encouraged her? Tossed by the wayside in favor of a bratty bully.

Was a fun movie, characters were interesting as usual, a winner for any child who loves Barbie movies :)",1322438400,,254,4.3125
4580162,2,B0055SNHP2,"Ok OK, why did I watch this? I gave the last 2 previous films 1 star each (wanted to give half a star to both to be honest).

I must say, I was pleased to find out they weren't carrying on with the 'Fairy Secret' storyline, which was a sequel to 'Fashion Fairytale'. This is not the same girl, or is it?! The Fashion Fairytale Barbie said she 'acted' in all the Barbie films...confusing really!

Upon first seeing the cover of this DVD, I was yet again disgusted, ""Another 'Plastic' and superficial tale"" I thought. I was also angry they were keeping at the stories with these superficial plots and also Barbie's new look and voice judging by the glamourous DVD art. But I gave it a shot anyway.

Upon the first few minutes I was pleasantly surprised, it wasn't as bad as I thought. Yeah, I did not like the tacky 'Princess School' idea. But at least It didn't seem totally fashion related.
Boy oh boy..was I wrong! It wasn't too long into the story that it suddenly got plastic. It happened so fast I couldn't keep up! One second you see the girl in her house, next second you see her whisked off to 'Princess School' on a carriage and you see the area where she lives...graffiti and all, looks like a very run-down area. Then it gets plastic, the annoying fairies are back again too! This time they do sneaky deeds to bad characters and also help out with outfits which instantly disappointed me.

Overall the story WAS Better than the previous 2. I don't know if Mattel were trying, but it was better. But still not good enough. I did like how they told Barbie 'No one can make you inferior but yourself'. Which was good for children, but they did not incorporate it in a nice enough way as there was still so much nastiness and bullying towards Barbie as they told her this and even after they said it. Which didn't make that moral stand out. I think the film had too much bullying and cattiness.

I also did not like how Barbie was so willing to just go to this 'Charm School' when her adopted mother appeared sick and Barbie seemed to be the only income supporting the family. It was really unrealistic and just upsetting. It didn't seem so safe either, considering it looks like they live in an area of crime judging by the look of the area they live in.

I give the film 2 stars as at least it wasn't completely fashion related as the previous 2 and the fairies weren't so prominent in this film. But still not enough heart and morals to give it any higher sadly.

As an adult, I will always remember and treasure the original tales I felt taught children good lessons. It was not about how to do things 'properly' and being 'perfect' like the messages come across in this film, but about standing up yourself, being brave, kind, caring and doing things for friends.

I could tolerate the new look, new voice and just overall 'NEW' Barbie they are marketing if they made her role model material and not 'marketing' material for money. I really miss Kelly Sheridan, she made the stories more 'Magic'. But even adding her voice to the last 3 films won't do anything to these I'm afraid.

I'd personally suggest the original stories up to The Diamond Castle (I don't think Thumbelina, Mermaid Tale or the 3 Musketeers were very good). They taught great morals for girls I think!",1322352000,4,3283,4.449251247920133

I thought that it had a lot of positive messages for young girls who are girlie girls and like Barbie.  The only part that is questionable is that the bad guy (mother) in the movie had someone ""eliminated"" and makes reference to it.  My girls didn't understand what that meant, so it was okay.

There is nothing that special about this movie. Both girls (3 & 6) got bored half way thru and left the room leaving me to realize I was the only one left in the room watching it. There is nothing terrible in it, but also nothing that great. There is only 1 song which isn't great. I realize this is not a ""musical"" but I know most little girls love songs and dances to sing along to with BArbie. These last few Barbie movies that haven't had any kind of music makes them somewhat boring.
I didn't hate it but certainly didn't love it. When asked ""do you want this movie for Christmas?"" both girls shrugged. Now normally, when asked about a movie they loved they will jump up and shout YES! without hesitation. Not the case for this one.
They are more excited about the Baribe Christmas one coming out this week w/her sisters and then the Mermaid Tale 2 coming out in the spring. I won't say this one isn't worth a watch for an avid Barbie fan, but maybe its a ""rental"" instead of a purchase.",1320624000,2,1137,4.220183486238532

Not sing-songy or too childish.  The story is decent.  We keep the tv time in our household to a bare minimum so we have no problems with our girls watching something for pure entertainment as long as it's age appropriate.  We have no illusions that our kids will learn valuble life lessons from watching barbie movies (I realize other reviews have touched on this issue).  The movie isn't violent or scary.  It even has some humorous parts and lines in it that I laughed at.  Easier movie to sit through than many others I can think of.

4580220,4,B0055SNHP2,"Spoilers:::::

My daughters enjoyed it (9 and 3).  I agree that the animation was somewhat better than usual.  I thought the plot was kind of Mermaid Tale on dry land, so I guess they're running out of ideas putting out 2 movies a year.

I thought Delancey, who was the daughter of the villain and was the princess-to-be, had a very unrealisitic turn-around at the end.  People can redeem themselves, but I didn't think her change-of-heart at the end was believable.  But it's just a Barbie movie, so enjoy!

Later Observation:  Wanted to add that now that I've watched the movie a few bazillion times, that I think this has become my favorite Barbie movie.  I always thought it was weird that the animation on Barbie movies was so primitive while many of the songs were very catchy and memorable.  I would describe the music on this video as dance/disco, but it is very well done and more sophisticated than usual.  The opening song, You Can Tell She's a Princess is a great start and I thought On Top of the World was very meaningful and memorable.  So, great music here.  I thought that they finally ""got Barbie right"" as far as the look and the animation.  Ok, it's not Pixar, but they got rid of the awful face shading ala Nutcracker, Mermadia and most of the early movies where Barbie looked somewhat freakish.  She was beautiful and graceful and looked like I think Barbie should look.

Part of the reason that I'm adding this review is that after watching the follow-up, A Perfect Christmas, I really appreciate this movie now.  I thought A Perfect Christmas, while an ok movie, also with some catchy music and a good story, was a step backward from this one.  It had a rushed-to-production look and Barbie looked like a refugee from some cosmetic surgery gulag at the end of the movie.

Also, I realized that Delancey's turnaround at the end WAS believable.  Delancey respected royalty and once she realized that Barbie/Blair was the lost princess it was understandable that she would suddenly have respect for her.",1318550400,,2024,4.6798866855524075
4580221,4,B0055SNHP2,"As pretty much everyone else has stated, I was apprehensive about this movie and was waiting for it to be a dud.  I was pleasantly surprised that Princess Charm School is funny, smart, and sassy - definitely aimed at an older/more mature child.  The story includes the usual storyline where Barbie (or ""Blair"") bests an adversary and they become friends at the end, and of course the villainess gets taken away forever.  There is also the now-mandatory flying fairy characters, as well as the ditzy best friend (reminded me of the highschool girls in Shrek 3).  Blair's backstory will probably confuse very small children and Dame Devon's greedy actions are difficult for smaller kids to understand, so be prepared to answer questions about the former King and Queen.

This isn't a full five star movie for me for a few reasons.  First, the blatent toy/movie tie-ins definitely are annoying - granted we're the ideal customer market for this.  I just wish these movies had a bit more substance (sometimes the Golden Books are better than the dvds)!  There are VERY few bonus features (unlike Fairytopia, for example, which had a full 30 minutes of extra features).  But to be fair, the camping with Barbie short was absolutely hilarious (the toy tie-ins are NOT subtle, but it was cute to see the sisters animated together - can't wait for the holiday movie).  Also, I can't stand the fact that Universal staggers new releases available for rental - that's really not fair and uncalled for.  I realize that this isn't a negative about the dvd itself, but I'm SO incredibly tired of these movie studios expecting higher sales because folks can't just rent the movie.

Anyway, very cute movie.  Great addition to the Barbie collection, and absolutely tolerable for parents!",1318550400,,1771,4.902684563758389

Go to the really good ones - Rapunzel, Princess and the Pauper, 12 Dancing Princesses, even Island Princess are all way better than this one.  A strange retelling of the Anastasia lost princess story, this is really nothing more than a big toy commercial.  Look - here comes the horse and carraige!  Set in a strange world that has a Starbucks type coffee shop and elevated trains with graffiti AND a castle with dozens of princesses AND magic AND tiny little fairies that fly around, whose only real purpose is to, that's right, sell more toys!  What's on the shelf at Toys R Us?  Horse and carraige, fairy dolls with horses (?), Borbie as Blair with chageable dress, necessary Prince doll, who only appears in the movie for a few minutes, basically so they can make the doll.  We really enjoyed making fun of this movie (how dumb is that readheaded girl?), but would n ot watch it again.  My daughter is 11, and has watched every Barbie movie as it came out, from Nutcracker on.

4580249,5,B0055SNHP2,"I got this for my daughter a week ago since she is an advid Barbie fan (All my fault for getting her started)and I most say this was one of the better Barbie movies I had seen in a while.

Synopis - Barbie plays an adopted under privilaged, hard working teenage girl who not known to her she is entered into a contest for a free scholarship to the most prestigeous ""Princess Charm School"" by her younger adopted sister. Upon winning (To here utter astonishment) she goes to the school in hopes of one day being able to make a better life for her adopted sister and adopted Sick Mother. Upon arriving to the school she quickly learns that completing the required course may not be as easy as it seems and most learn to conquer her own fears and to believe in herself to do so, However she later learns she may actually be something more than what she had originally dreamed of being when initially arriving at the school.

The movie gave the usual good moral lessons, was fast paced, and kept the targeted audience (My 9 year old daughters) attention to where she has already watched about 8 times since purchasing it. I would deffienantley recommend it for it's targeted audience and even for the adult audience as well.",1317168000,5,1220,4.490990990990991
4580250,4,B0055SNHP2,"Barbie movies have been going downhill for the most part, but I was pleasantly surprised with Princess Charm Academy. This film mixes traditional fairy tale stuff like magic and fairies with modern day amenities like broadcast television and Starbucks.

Once a year, princesses go to a charm school. If they pass, they ""earn"" their titles of princess. Certain girls born commoners go as well for a chance to be selected as a ""lady royal""--an adviser to the princess. In Gardenia, one commoner girl is selected each year by lottery to attend the school for a chance to be a lady royal, and this year coffee house waitress Blair Willow (Barbie) is selected.

Blair doesn't want to go to charm school because she has a little sister and their adoptive mother is sick. The little sister entered her, and Blair changes her mind after talking to her family. She is promptly whisked away to princess charm school for a chance to be a lady royal. A lot of Mean Girls type of stuff happens, Blair discovers she is the long lost princess and true heir to the Gardenian throne, and learns about self-confidence and other life lessons. The villain gets her comeuppance, Blair gets her crown and she makes friends with her young rival, Delancy. Blair's mother (who is looking better by this point) and little sister move into the palace and all ends well.

One petite irritation was the Men In Grey (Secret Service pastiches). Most have voices like that OOM PA PA MOW MOW guy in the Oak Ridge Boys with Scottish accents, and very little patience. Somewhere along the line Gardenia must have conquered The 300 or an island of soccer hooligans. (I really want to see a copy of the school handbook, because the academy seems to pull rules and policies out of nowhere.) Also, each student (and teacher apparently) at the academy has a little fairy helper. These recycled Twillerbees seem to be ""good"" or ""bad"" depending on the person to whom they're assigned.

This cast of extras has Star Wars Storm Trooper Accuracy(tm), but only at critical moments in the plot. So I guess soft living in the Kingdom of Pinkness is eroding their mad minion skills. However, I especially liked Alexandra Privet, who was the embodiment of a true lady. She was a great role model and a very likable character.

I want to address some of the more serious problem points in this movie. Yes, a lot of class time is spent on things like walking with a book on your head, table manners, dancing and other matters of deportment. I never saw Barbie sitting in a class on political science, but they never said things like that weren't included or weren't important, either. An entire montage is spent on Barbie doing homework, including extra work on the fluff like dancing.

This movie is targeted at 5 year olds; unless you can figure out how to coat a pre-law curriculum in pink glitter and combine it with at least a few girly things, I don't think it's going to hold their attention for very long, and that may go for a few boys that age as well. Also, considering the behavior I see from kids AND adults these days, I think a few lessons in etiquette and wanting to emulate polite, well-behaved characters couldn't possibly hurt anyone.

Princess and lady royal are not the only career paths shown in the film. Barbie's room mates are a soccer player and a DJ, two hobbies/careers that are not traditional ""girlie"" activities. The soccer player does some pretty impressive gymnastics, and the DJ uses her musical skills to get them out of a jam.

The teachers and the leader at the academy are all women and it's never mentioned anywhere that there are career paths girls can't take. The only way I found this movie sexist was that it appeared that only a female could take the position of monarch, at least in Gardenia. There was a male academy to provide dance partners in classes and a love interest for Barbie, but that was the extent of boys in the movie (aside from the soccer hooligan guards).

I find it difficult to believe that these are major issues when the main villain eliminated two people in a car crash, lies, plants evidence, wrongly detains three minors, attempts to usurp the Gardenian throne, hides the fact that Blair is the rightful heir, has plans to leave an unknown number of poor people homeless with a landscape beautification project, and is just an all-around nasty woman. One of the people she eliminated was likely her own brother from the way her relation to the royal family was described, and Blair was her niece (who she also tried to eliminate). This isn't the first Barbie villain to be guilty of this sort of thing, but are tea and dance lessons really more appalling than all that?

This is the first Barbie movie I've actually liked in a long time after a myriad of unwatchable fluff and even overt attempts at political activism. I miss Kelly Sheridan as the voice of Barbie, songs like Princess and the Pauper, and frankly, the characters move like The Sims. Mattel can do better, but they've done much worse. This is a definite improvement over many of its recent predecessors, and I think kids and adults will both enjoy it.",1317168000,6,5134,4.656732891832229
4580251,1,B0055SNHP2,"The barbie movies have been getting dumber and dumber but this one really takes the cake.  A hardworking waitress wins a lottery to go to ""princess charm school"" so she can learn to wear makeup, accessorize properly, drink tea, and dance.  If she passes the program, she might get to be a Lady Royal and become an advisor to the princess who is totally unfit to rule if it involves anything more than these few accomplishments.  Not ONCE in this entire movie are these princess/lady royal shown reading books, doing homework, or being involved in anything that is not a stereotypical ""girlie"" activity.  This is the most they can aspire to in their lives--forget being a doctor, a teacher, a leader, a farmer, a policewoman.  All they can hope for is to get to wear a sparkly tiara and be a princess.  Oh, brother.  My oldest daughter HATED the movie and my youngest only likes the parts where they do modern dance.  What a stupid movie for young girls of today with so many opportunities available! Barbie also leaves her sick mother in the care of her 10-year-old sister while attending ""Princess Charm School"".  Very good role-modeling there.
