8362350,2,B0009ML26A,This is a softcore video.  No real confessions.  Just porn stars having fake sex.  Several different scenes & some of the girls had their websites up for your perusal.  This is nothing more than you'll see on Skinamax.,1358553600,3,218,4.657894736842105
8362351,3,B0009ML26A,"""Confessions of an Adult Film Star"" is a good concept that just wasn't executed well. Porn stars are interviewed and they give fake ""confessions"". Then we see these played out as quick little stories. I need to emphasize the word ""quick"". Each confession lasts about thirteen minutes, but most of the stories were so complex that they really needed twice that amount of time. There are six confessions, centered around five different porn stars: Alana Evans, Nicole Sheridan, Syren, Julie Meadows (she gets two confessions), and Angelica Sin. Only Angelica's segment really worked. It actually played out like a confession and didn't take itself as seriously as the other stories.

There are fourteen sex scenes. That sounds like a lot, but all of them were short. They jump between shots and positions at a pretty quick clip. It's not ""MTV video"" fast, but it's definitely suitable for people with attention deficit disorder. Ten scenes are boy/girl, one is boy/girl/girl, two are girl/solo, and one is girl/girl. As short as they are, some of the scenes are pretty good. The women are all attractive, you can hear the sounds of the actors/actresses, it's very explicit stuff, and there are some well framed shots.

But this would have worked much better if the stories had been less ambitious and the sex scenes had been paced slower. As it is now, everything felt rushed.

""Undercover Sex"" is a paint by numbers softcore thriller where someone is killing call girls. A female cop (Beverly Lynne) goes undercover to catch him. It was okay, but far from impressive.

There are seven sex scenes. Five are boy/girl and two are girl/girl. There were four other women in addition to Beverly. All the women were attractive. Three of Beverly's scenes showed brief moments of real heat, but for the most part, the sex scenes weren't very memorable or explicit. All of them were pretty short. Since most of the movie took place at a strip club and an adult magazine studio, there were several striptease scenes sprinkled throughout with the women showing off their bodies.

Because of the low price, this isn't a bad value. You've got several very attractive women and plenty of sex. But both movies have their problems and there's better stuff out there to check out instead.",1104710400,9,2269,4.8984375
