8300528,5,B001F0TT24,"After escaping the castle together, Balsa and Chagum head for Balsa's homeland seeking refuge. The Emperor's elite troops are hot on their trail. The duo is attacked. Balsa is able to fend off the troops, but is severely injured in the process. I can't believe that those men would harm a woman this gorgeous. Chivalry must truly be dead. Anyway, the two are saved by Balsa's old friend who is a healer. While recovering at his house, an old magic user arrives and discovers the truth about Chagum's possessor. After recuperating, they set out again for Balsa's home country.

This volume is great. Except for the fact that there are only 3 episodes. The plot thickens and the characters gain more depth. This series is growing on me, and I'm beginning to like it quite a lot. I think that just about any anime lover can find something to like about this series. I highly recommend it. It's very good, and it seems to be getting even better after every episode.",1357776000,,961,4.619883040935672
