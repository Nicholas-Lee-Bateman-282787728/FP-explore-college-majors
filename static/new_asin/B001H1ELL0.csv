8307602,5,B001H1ELL0,"In reading these reviews, it seems that this series actually did come to a conclusion.  In the U.S., to the best of my memory, it never did.  Am I forgetting something?  I remember seeing the final episode which had a fantastic cliff-hanger, but I can't imagine that that was the end of the entire series?  If anyone knows, please let me know.  I thought this show was brilliant and was so happy that Showtime picked it up...only to become VERY disappointed when they cancelled it shortly after, along with ""John, from Cincinnati"", another excellent show that got dropped before its time.  I find it extremely frustrating to invest in a show only to have it cancelled.  Kind of makes you want to stop watching.",1366588800,,710,4.67741935483871
8307603,3,B001H1ELL0,"It was entertaining enough that I finished watching the series, but I wish that I hadn't bought it. I saw Felicity Jones in Like Crazy, and I thought she was a very good actress. Also, I follow Tom Hardy. When I saw Tom and Felicity in one show, I was super excited. That's why I shelled out the money to buy it since I couldn't find a way to just watch it.

The acting in this is fine. I just didn't like the story, and some of the plot twists are stupid. I started watching it with some family members, and I was the only one that stuck it out until the end. The others said that they got bored with the storyline, and one admitted to it confusing her.",1355529600,3,654,4.030769230769231

I watched part of this series on youtube and I was so into this program very suspenseful to the point that I order it
along with a all region dvd player just so I can watch it over and over again at home.
Tom Hardy as Jack Donnlley was so scary but also in a warp kind of someone I wanted to know and hangout with oh yeah
it doesn't hurt that he is awesomely hot.",1338508800,4,725,5.785046728971962
8307605,5,B001H1ELL0,"I honestly don't know why this show was cancelled. It had me glued to the edge of my seat the entire time. Tom Hardy, playing Jack is unbelievably creepy, but so sensual, in a way.... Lots of language. But all in all, A++.",1332115200,3,222,4.186046511627907
