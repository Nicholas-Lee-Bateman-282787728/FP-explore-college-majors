8503837,5,B006T0CE8Q,"Awesome drama, had me on the edge of my set at moments.  The only reason I purchased this DVD was to see the AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING No Min Woo and it was not a disappointment.  Min Woo showcases his wonderful musical ability....with a jammin' guitar scene.  Besides Min Woo, the other actors did a stellar job.  Recommending this DVD if you love suspense and deception.",1365465600,,372,4.676923076923077
8503838,5,B006T0CE8Q,"Our family really enjoyed this series.  The acting and storyline is wonderful!  The story follows a man who is a financial genius and his falling into the trap of believing money is all that matters.  The rise, the fall, the power and money battles, and the new awakening to what really does matter, make for a suspenseful yet satisfying drama.  The three top main characters were superbly portrayed by  Jang Hyuk, Kim Hee-Ae, and Lee Min-Jung (really, all the actors did quality work regarding their characters).  However, special recognition and extra kudos to actor No Min-Woo for his portrayal of a character who has come to understand and appreciate what is truly important in life through his battle with cancer.  (He lost 21 lbs for his portrayal of this character!)  He became one of our favorite characters in the drama.  His acting regarding scenes of pain were the best done of any actor I've seen portraying the pain associated with cancer.

Note for viewers who look for family friendly fare: There were a couple of scenes we fast forwarded that were not family friendly, but I have to note that compared to what is on American television, their non-family-friendly scenes would probably be considered mild. We are just very particular with what we view in our family.  I don't know the Korean rating system, but here this would probably be rated a PG or PG-13 for some sensuality (no nudity) and violence (thug style).",1365206400,,1432,4.827868852459017
