8454723,5,B0052XU4FG,"I saw this film at the Brooklyn Film Festival and was blown away. The filmmakers did a stunning job telling a complex, emotion-filled story that offers commentary on political, socio-economic, Internet and Media, urban, and even comedic issues. I highly recommend this film.",1313280000,2,274,5.395348837209302
8454724,5,B0052XU4FG,"I saw the movie at Cinema Village in Manhattan last night. Jimmy McMillan was there taking photos and greeting everyone in between news crew interviews. He's such a friendly guy - but watch out because the movie shows he has a dark side too. A real meditation on what it means to be an overnight sensation in the Internet age, ""DAMN!"" is probably the first documentary to cover what is surely going to be the changing nature of fame. Highly Recommended!",1313193600,2,453,4.604938271604938
8454725,5,B0052XU4FG,"Our culture these days seems to have veered towards the quick-fix mentality. We love our media to cut to the chase and offer direct and easy to understand criticism. You see it in news programs, and you see it in book stores (at least what few still exist) in how they line their shelves with self-help books, and, perhaps most glaringly, we see it in our doltish politicians who spout out keywords that tell us exactly what emotions. What people seem to forget (perhaps what they WANT to forget) is that for these big problems that the self-help books and the politicians preach to us, there is no such thing as an easy solution.

The documentary DAMN!, in both its subject matter and the way it is crafted, shirks the pitfall of offering a simple moral. It offers no five word mantra for fixing how the web has transformed the way we consume media. Instead, it observes. As we follow Jimmy McMillan around, we learn what we probably already knew inside: that despite his eccentricities (and he has many), McMillan is a pretty average dude. He wants to wrap his gloved hands around the holy grail set before us by the media (fame).

Then you get the random YouTubers, who seem similarly lost, grasping at this momentary media darling in the hopes that they can taste the attention and adoration of the world. After a dozen or so interviews with the MSM, wherein the interviewers ask inane question after inane question, all with the intention of further dramatizing Jimmy's story, I really started to feel the emptiness at the core of the whole situation. I got the really creepy sense that all this stuff is a racket, as if there was some mysterious pusher somewhere, and he advertised his drug so well that he didn't even needed to give it to anyone to have them dedicating their lives in his service.

For fame? For a bunch of people to know your name?

Jimmy seems to glow in the attention for a time, but even if I didn't know that SNL was no longer doing skits on him, I would have had the same sense of anxiety for him. The whole thrill ride of Jimmy's 15 minutes all just starts to seem a series of mirrors, flashing the faces of eagerness of the other addicts to give the impression that at its center there is something great, something worthwhile.

There isn't. There are no easy answers. If you woke up tomorrow with every twitter user following you, owning all the banks, having all the prettiest chicks,  you'll still be left same person; you'll still have that voice inside your head asking, ""Now what?""

This film, with it's careful attention to details and mannerisms, and with it's deconstruction of the ""media whirlwind"" does an excellent job of observing the way media works today. It might not give you any solutions, but it sure provokes a hell of a lot of questions.",1312848000,3,2790,4.579158316633267
