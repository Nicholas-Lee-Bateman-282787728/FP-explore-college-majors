8237170,5,B00104XYJ4,"Anthony Robbins is among the most gifted and effective speakers of all time. The massive number of Celebrities, world leaders, and volume of people that have sought him out speaks for itself. Over many years we have not seen any program done by Mr. Robbins that did not deserve 5 stars when compared to other programs and  this vol  in the personal coaching collection is no exception. The average American watches more than 4 hours of television a day, frequently just wasting time. So it is amazing that for less than going to the movies and popcorn, in only an hour or so you could watch something that could leave a lasting positive effect on your time management and interaction with family friends or with your business and your happiness.  It is an effective, engaging, and thought provoking while being fun to listen to. Like all of Anthony Robbins products, it is easily worth many many times the purchase price.  Even if you are satisfied with your time management skills you will likely get something from this. It's not Tony's complete program on time management, but then again it's not overwhelming- and if you like it you'll know how and were to get more.  We seriously doubt you will be unhappy with this purchase. We certainly found this to be an excellent and insightful CD. While we try to be unbiased in our reviews Tony Robbins work is so excellent that we highly suggest you do not miss this one. We would have liked this to be a little longer, but he has many excellent longer programs available also that should be looked at by everyone who is interested in a happier more balanced fulfilled life (and who doesn't want that?).",1453334400,,1650,4.6563573883161515

Three things take our attention: Pain, Pleasure, and other People
FOCUS IS POWER
TIME IS EMOTION

Overchunked- not thinking about what you want, but the pain
Focus on process not outcome will make difficult to do it

Underchunk- make a million pieces

Chuncking- ideal sized groups
(7 =/- 2 chunks of info at same time)

turn alot into a little
focus on outcome and why its important to you
TO DO LIST= STRESS
CAPTURING
step 1- get it out of head, list of action steps
step 2- find patterns, do any action.  items relate to similar result
category more important than activity

Focus- Outcome/Results- (connect w/ people) forget about how-to's
knowing what you want is one thing
but knowing why brings in emotional power

Purpose- Identity- (supermom, not maid) trigger motivates
FOCUS ON OUTCOME AND WHY. things will click and flow",1303430400,9,902,4.737179487179487
