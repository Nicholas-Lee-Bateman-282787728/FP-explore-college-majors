7901183,5,8585995513,"Writing a review of a series consisting of 56 episodes is a task I'm not qualified to do; however, I gladly share my thoughts to help a potential buyer make a decision.  The series is an ambitious undertaking for a director, and the actors are challenged to mature in their roles, transitioning over a period of several years.  Song Seung-heon is cast as the older brother who takes responsibility for the family after the death of his father.  He and his younger brother (who, I believe, is played by Heon, Jeong-hun) take different approaches to avenge their father's death.

In the course of these many episodes, the plot takes numerous twists, keeping the viewer not only interested but challenged to remember all the many characters and double-crossing being done.  This is not a series that can be watched passively; but, if the viewer stays focused, the mental and emotional impact will be rewarding.

There are two possible weak spots: (1) the occasional wailing by the actors, which becomes melodramatic; however, this approach was no doubt at the behest of the director rather than choices made by the actors, since they ALL do it. (2) the mis-casting of the actress playing ""Grace"" who, I understand, had not been out of high school very long and was not seasoned enough to transition from teen-ager to mature adult. She begins her role as a brat and doesn't grow out of that stage just by wearing grown-up clothes.

I encourage lovers of Korean dramas to purchase this series, as well as the beautiful soundtrack also available.",1347148800,,1540,4.854961832061068
