3491650,5,B001BGTWSI,"This long-anticipated release was worth the wait!  Eight music videos bring some of Steve's top hits to life.  Each one is creatively unique and highly entertaining. The 10-song live concert totally ROCKS!  The director did an amazing job of capturing the atmosphere of a SteveSongs concert: kids dancing, parents singing along, lots of silliness, and, woven through it all, real musical talent from Steve and the band.  Any family with young kids (0-8) should own a copy.  Our whole family loves it! I agree with the previous reviewer, $12.99 is a bargain for this much entertainment. Highly recommended.",1221696000,,605,5.13265306122449
3491651,5,B001BGTWSI,"I just watched this video with my 20 month old daughter.  We both LOVED it! As soon as she goes to sleep tonight I am downloading ALL his songs from iTunes onto her iPod (and some on mine :). I love that most of the videos are filmed outside. Not only do you get a DVD but you get a CD as well - an awesome bargain for $13!  I have spent much more money on children's products and received a lot less.  Thank you for creating wonderful songs and videos Steve, know you have some new fans in Califoria!",1220486400,,501,3.99
3491652,5,B001BGTWSI,"We're lucky enough to have received an advance copy of this DVD/CD and it totally rocks!! Steve's five wonderful albums are hard to beat but this takes the experience to a whole new level. The DVD features music videos, live concert footage, ""Mr. Steve"" videos from PBS KIDS, and various fun outtakes. It's funny, sweet, original and incredibly creative, just like Steve's music and shows. My kids love it! I love it! With quality music, real kids, and shot on location, it has a wonderfully authentic feel that adults can appreciate. It's a welcome alternative to the artificial world of Disney and the Wiggles, and with better big-kid appeal than Laurie Berkner. A CD is included too. This is an awesome DVD, an unbelievable bargain for 12.99. If you're a fan of SteveSongs - or of great kids' music - definitely check out this DVD!",1219708800,5,834,4.758620689655173
3491673,5,B001BGTWSI,"My daughter bought this after seeing Steve in person last summer.  She watched it every day for a few weeks...the CD plays in the car for every trip.  The songs are fun, positive and they teach.  The songs are easier for parents to enjoy than some kids' music and my daughter and I both can learn words and act things out together.  Many of the songs come with some fun activities the kids can do along with the music...gestures, or clapping or following instructions.  We use these songs at the bus stop to pass time and calm nerves.  And the best part is it gets the kids on their feet..they don't just sit and stare at the tv screen...they can't help but get up and dance or move around.  There really isn't anything I'd change about this dvd.  This man has found his calling.",1285891200,,779,4.361111111111111
3491674,5,B001BGTWSI,We fell in love with Steve a couple years ago when my son got into PBS when he was almost 2.  He loved watching the Steve Segments.  When I found out that Steve was going to be playing locally I downloaded three of his CDs and we've been listening to them non-stop in the car for months.  We went to Steve's concert a couple weekends ago and my son loved it. I bought the DVD there and my son has asked to watch it over and over again.  He LOVES Steve and as a parent I find him very enjoyable to listen to as well.  I would much rather have Marvelous Day or any of his other songs running through my head over your typical children's songs.  I can't say enough good things about Steve Songs.,1284681600,,692,4.051470588235294
3491675,5,B001BGTWSI,"Absolutely fantastic DVD. This guy is like the pied piper. My 20 month old is addicted to this video and asks for it constantly. The songs are catchy and I find myself singing along with my son. We had a play date a few days ago and invited 4 other children(from 20 months to 3 years old) and we popped this video in why the adults were trying to make lunch. The room was silent at first as all the kids sat mesmerized by the music. Later all the kids were dancing and singing, it was great to watch.

I highly recommend this video to anyone with young kids. The songs are catchy and educational!",1284249600,,596,4.182608695652174
3491676,5,B001BGTWSI,"My 3 year old son could not stop dancing to this dvd.  He was actually singing with the songs!!!!!  Great dvd
Thank you Steve for putting this wonder ""Marvelous musical advantures""",1277424000,,180,4.774193548387097
3491677,5,B001BGTWSI,"I got three copies of the DVD. It's very nice of them to include both the DVD and Audio CD in the case.
My 3 year-old loves it and my 1 year-old niece loves it too. Not sure how my friend's son is but his mommy enjoys watching it also.

Steve Songs is a very creative artist who also has an attractive and soothing voice.
This is a great buy and if your kids love to sing-along and dance-along. I strongly recommend this
DVD. I hope Steve Songs will put out his Volume II collection.",1271030400,,483,4.08421052631579
3491678,3,B001BGTWSI,"My kids love Steve Songs.  He appears on our local PBS station playing short little songs in between shows.  The DVD starts out good with cute little skits but then goes into ""concert"" footage which is also good but then the kids started losing interest.  I have not yet had the chance to watch it all the way until the end to see if it switches back to the cute skits.  Overall it's cute.",1243382400,,389,4.216216216216216
3491679,5,B001BGTWSI,My son sees Stevesongs on our public station. He loves it and so do it! It's cute and fun without being totally annoying to Mom/Dad.,1242864000,,132,4.32
3491680,3,B001BGTWSI,my daughter loves teh steve songs from tv.so we wished they included the songs from tv. we never heard any of teh songs from the dvd- its a nice dvd with songs- but wanted the tv songs on there,1236124800,,193,3.9743589743589745
3491681,5,B001BGTWSI,"This DVD is better than I had anticipated because not only does it have music videos for a lot of songs, it also has a full length film made at a grade school in their auditorium.  Everything on it is really entertaining and I don't mind admitting that my wife and I both like this better than our 2 year old does.  Don't get me wrong, he likes watching it too, but not as much as us.",1234656000,,384,3.9740259740259742
3491682,5,B001BGTWSI,"This is a fantastic DVD with everything from music videos to concert footage.  My sons (4 and 2) beg to watch it every morning.  And, of course, I constantly have Steve Songs songs pulsing through my head.  The additional CD is a bonus as we can also listen to the songs in the car.  I only wish there were more songs on the CD.  Great purchase!",1234137600,,345,4.166666666666667
3491713,5,B001BGTWSI,"The descriptions in the other reviews are quite accurate and detailed, so I won't reword those.  I just wanted to add that my 21 month old just received this DVD.  She LOVES Steve's segments on PBS, and Loves this DVD even more.  It's the only thing she wants to watch anymore.  She just keeps asking for Steve, Steve, then looks at us with those big brown eyes and says please and uh huh, while nodding her head.  How can we resist?  This is a definite hit with her and the songs are pretty catchy.",1233014400,,499,4.25531914893617
3491714,4,B001BGTWSI,Great dvd; kept my son engaged. I was hoping for some songs other than those that he plays on PBS.,1231200000,,98,3.95
3491715,5,B001BGTWSI,"I bought this for my 18 mos. old for xmas because he loves to see Steve on PBS - turns out it is the best present I bought for all three kids (age 18 mos, 3, 6)!  They LOVE the video and the songs and they think Steve is hysterical.  The kids have spent hours singing, dancing and playing along with Steve.  PLUS the songs really are GREAT and won't drive the parents crazy - we all love this dvd/cd! Thanks Steve!",1230768000,,414,4.024390243902439
3491716,5,B001BGTWSI,"All three of my children love Steve Songs and love Steve's new video.  It is very difficult for me to find something that all three can enjoy, since there is such an age difference (10,8,3)  My oldest enjoys the band with the instruments, my middle one the singing, and my youngest loves ""Silly Vanilly"".  Steve is awesome!  The only thing better than the DVD is seeing one of his live band shows!!",1230595200,,398,4.486111111111111
3491717,5,B001BGTWSI,"My daughter Evie first fell in love with Steve when we saw him at Wolftrap in Virginia in 2007.  We bought the Marvelous Day CD then, and listened to it EVERY SINGLE DAY until this summer, when we saw him again at Wolftrap and bought the new DVD.  For several months after that, she asked to watch the DVD EVERY SINGLE DAY.  If you can believe it, she asks for SteveSongs over the Wiggles all the time now.  She loved meeting Steve this summer when he signed her new DVD.  Whenever we see him on PBS now, she quickly points out that ""Evie rhymes with Stevie"", which is the note he wrote on her DVD.  The DVD/CD is excellent and I highly recommend it.  Even better, though, is to catch Steve at a live show.  Beware, however, that you will end up with SteveSongs going through your head non-stop.  I can't tell you how many times I've caught myself singing It's a Marvelous Day at work!!!",1230076800,,887,4.295180722891566
3491718,5,B001BGTWSI,"We were lucky enough to have a friend recommend Steve to us, so we went to see him live this past summer, where we got Marvelous Day CD and danced along at his concert...and we were HOOKED.  So we were very excited to hear about the upcoming release of this, his first DVD...now we are even more THRILLED that we have it...our 4.5 year old sings along and our 20 month old asks for the ""Steve"" DVD and the CD when we are in the car.  We LOVE it, and are ordering more copies for gifts this year.  The PBS clips are too SHORT, we want a Mr. Steve SHOW and holiday CD.  Thanks Steve, for a GREAT DVD, and kids' music that adults also enjoy, even listening to over and over. We look forward to seeing you and the Sillies live again soon.",1227830400,,734,4.076388888888889
3491719,5,B001BGTWSI,"My kids (9,6 and 3) have been fans of Steve since my oldest was 18 months old and we had the pleasure of hosting a concert at the school where I work. His music is fantasic, his shows so much fun and the DVD is equally wonderful- my daughter watches it all the time! My husband and I love the music, too, Steve's songs are entertaining, educational and funny- and Steve is truly a nice guy who deserves all of the success he is enjoying! Pick up the DVD and CDs- you will not be sorry!",1227744000,,485,4.0625
3491720,5,B001BGTWSI,Finally a review from the West Coast! I can't say enough great things about this man and his music! Steve's music is enjoyable for both adults and kids - awesome to have good music with such a positive message and that makes you laugh too.  Parents appreciate this SO MUCH. So fun to have a DVD now too after playing and overplaying his music CD's FOREVER! Now we just need more West Coast live concert dates and locations please.,1226188800,,430,4.443037974683544
3491721,5,B001BGTWSI,"We took our 3 year-old daughter to see Steve perform live at the historic Belcourt Theatre in Nashville, Tennessee. We were instant fans. We purchased Marvelous Day and Flying Guitar in the lobby after the show. Within a week's time we had purchased every SteveSongs CD available online. Our daughter is now 5, and we surprised her with a signed advanced copy of this DVD/CD for her birthday. It was her favorite present, by far. Steve seemlessly blends education and entertainment with a warmth and authenticity that engages children and charms parents. He collaborates with excellent musicians in their own right and the result is a family product with great integrity and entertainment value. We love being able to see Steve perform, and look forward to seeing him live again someday. This is a must have for any family. If you are new to SteveSongs it is an excellent introduction. If you are a fan, it's an awesome collection.",1224288000,,931,4.861635220125786
3491722,5,B001BGTWSI,"My kids (2 and 4) cannot get enough of Uncle Steve. They've been listening to the CD and I just bought the DVD and they adore the concert piece in this. I'm surprised he is not a national sensation yet (getting there with a PBS slot!). His songs are funny, educational and great to sing along to. We want more!",1222905600,2,310,4.183333333333334
8283155,5,B001BGTWSI,Grandkids love this.,1495670400,,20,6.0
8283156,5,B001BGTWSI,my daycare kids love the dvd and it comes with a cd too!!!,1489708800,,58,3.5384615384615383
8283157,5,B001BGTWSI,Great DVD for toddlers. This is my second purchase for grandkids.,1471478400,,65,5.0
8283158,5,B001BGTWSI,"My little girl loves this DVD.  Mr Steve talks about making this engaging to children to help them learn but he doesnt say he also attempts to give hope for the future. He does this very successfully I might add.  I haven't any other childrens videos do this, and he does it with the appearence of minimal effort.  Make more Mr Steve.",1393718400,,334,4.354838709677419
8283159,5,B001BGTWSI,"Mr. Steve's ""The Marvelous Musical Adventures"" is fun for all the whole family.  The DVD contains some music videos, a live concert and bonus footage.  There's also a short CD included as well.  If your kids have seen and enjoy Mr. Steve either on PBS or in person, this is a must have.  Even if they haven't and you're looking for positive, family friendly entertainment for your kids, this is a great buy. Mr. Steve's songs are funny, catchy, and do have some good messages behind them.
The only draw back is when you hit the play button on the main menu, it plays everything and I mean everything.  You have to select the music videos and play all there in order to have it stop after the last video, rather than roll on into the concert.  If you want just the concert, you have to do the same thing, navigating to the concert footage and playing from there in order not to roll into the promos, bonus footage and even the pitch reel for the disc, most of which will be of little interest to the average kid.  This is really a just a flaw in the disc authoring, but it is annoying.
While Mr. Steve has a few albums, I suggest pairing this with the Marvelous Day CD as many of the songs for the videos come from the music on that disc and it has other catchy tunes your kids will love and you, as a parent, may find yourself humming as well.",1389830400,,1343,4.22265625
8283160,5,B001BGTWSI,"My son isn't really into videos or tv, but when he saw Steve songs on PBS he literally stopped what he was doing to watch the 30 sec song. Naturally, i got right on amazon and purchased this for our upcoming trip. This video is a lifesaver on road trips now!",1365465600,,258,4.078431372549019
8283161,5,B001BGTWSI,I got this DVD when it first came out.  All 4 of my kids love it.  Even my 23 month old dances with the older ones now.  My husband accidentally broken it and our little one kept asking for it so I got another one.  I just wish he had more we could get.,1364947200,,253,3.6296296296296298
8283162,5,B001BGTWSI,"I am the mother to an energetic 21 month old little boy who absolutely loves ""SteveSongs!""  Before I became a mother I was a kindergarten teacher and I have seen A LOT of musical DVDs for young children...this is the best DVD by far!  My husband and I find ourselves singing the songs when our son isn't even around...it is that good!  There is also a concert portion that is interactive and teaches cute movements that go along with the songs. Along with this purchase we also bought ""Baby Boost"" and ""The Laurie Berkner Band.""  They don't even compare to ""SteveSongs!""  Take it from me...""SteveSongs"" is the best there is!  The only downfall is that he has yet to make another DVD...your kids will become hooked and they will want more!  I can only hope that there will be more ""SteveSongs"" coming our way soon!",1318550400,,813,4.56551724137931
8283163,2,B001BGTWSI,"My kids were excited when I received this in the mail after purchasing it on this site. After the first 6 or 7 short songs, the remaining of the video was this live, dragged out boring performance for which my kids (ages 2 & 4) quickly lost interest. It would've been nice if they left out the live stuff for regular videos.",1301961600,,324,4.241935483870968
8283164,5,B001BGTWSI,We bought this video when my son was less than 2; now he's almost 3 and he still loves. He'd watch it daily if we let him. If you're looking for a DVD that children of many ages will enjoy and even grownups than this is the DVD for your house too.,1293148800,2,247,3.769230769230769
