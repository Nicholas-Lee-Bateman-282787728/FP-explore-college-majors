Seemed like a good deal, but if you want to see it there, you gotta buy the movie. So I did. During the course of ordering, and getting on the mailing list, I found out information about the writer/director/driving force etc... of the movie. Then when I got the movie, I saw what someone with drive and determination could do with little money, and a love for making a zombie movie. Like I said, it's not Aliens, but it is a fun movie, made with imagination, and a touch of humor. Watch for the rabbit, he's a trip. Also watch for the blonde zombie, coming back in a scene late in the movie, with another shirt on. I wonder where he got the change of clothes, but hey-I guess even zombies can have 'style':-) Summing it up, it's worth the money, and kudo's to a woman who can do alot, without much money.

This movie is horrible on many different levels. DO NOT BUY.

Sound cuts out so much it's almost impossible to hear whats going on.

The plot is almost non existent. They try and tie things together in the last third of the film, and do a flimsy job at that. Oh! They found a temp cure for the zombie outbreak, and they don't follow up on that.  Oh! They can kill zombies with fire, but again, they try one mild follow up that goes nowhere. If I actually found a way to kill these guys I'd be doing my damnedest to use it every chance I got.  Instead we get, ""Oh we killed with fire.  Shrug""

You don't care about ANY of the characters.  There's nothing to make you like these over actors.  One guy's a thief and get's almost caught by a guy he robed awhile back.  So what? There's no reprocutions for his actions.  Another woman yells, ""I don't trust you!"" So what? She doesn't do anything about it except look mad and hang out in the corner. There's a nurse who's job is to run around in the woods and get almost caught by zombies.  Who cares?  Then again, you can say that about everyone in this film.

The zombies suck.  Sometimes they run, sometimes they don't.  Sometimes they attack wtih vigor and grapple, sometimes they barely pawed at their victim.  NO consistency.  Not one zombie can figure out how to break a window. These zombies even had their hands on a victim (the worthless nurse) and then forgot all about her and ran off into the woods just before the bite.  Huh.  Some effects were not good either- you can see zombies chewing on paper/film of some sort soaked in red ""blood"". Booooo...

The editing is bad as well: many shots are either too long or too repetitive.

Forever avoid this film.  Now I'm going to see how long it takes for ""0 of 3 people found this review helpful"" as the film makers or their buddies vote me down. Such is the price for telling the truth. : /",1213315200,21,1961,4.295081967213115

I would work on the make-up for the next one though.  Special FX contacts (schleral lenses) really go a long way.  And fellas, I gotta have more latex!

I could have bought George Romero's ""Diary of The Dead"" instead, but I didn't realize it was available yet!  Oh the humanity!!! (I did buy it, and enjoyed it though the video FX for gunshots in ""Diary"" are not great.  But I digress!)

I'm going to give this movie another chance.  Perhaps it is a future cult classic.  I've got to lighten-up a little. You can't take zombie movies too seriously, though the fast zombies one sees in some of the newer films never fails to piss me off.

Well Christine Parker has done just that, and apparently more if you talk to fans of her work.

Now, don't expect George Lucas, or even George Romero special effects.  And I don't think Christine is expecting an Oscar or Golden Globe any day now.  But that really isn't the point... although I suspect she'd happily take one!

One may initially dismiss ""The Forever Dead"" as just another low budget home-made flick, but don't believe for a minute that the look and feel is all happenstance.  Christine Parker and friends have done an outstanding job putting together a film that plays the part, and delivers.

Just like any other genre, there is a dedicated niche of fans that specifically appreciates the low budget appeal of movies of this type.  For some they seem more ""real"", for others it is perhaps nostalgia for the grindhouse or drive-in of their youth.

But regardless of one's motivations, if you are a fan of down home fun zombie flicks, gore, and more than a little humor(intentional and otherwise), ""The Forever Dead"" may be for you.

In many ways it reminds me of my youth in the 1970s, staying up late on Saturday night watching ""Chiller Theater"" in Pittsburgh... struggling to keep awake for the second ""B-Movie"" feature.

So why only 4 stars?  Well, this is Christine's first feature length effort, and another is in the works.  So, I bet her product will get even better!

And seriously, 5 stars is ""perfection"".  If this film were ""perfect"" it might not even be as good!  Hrmm, I'm not sure if that circular logic even makes sense  *laugh*

8238382,1,B0010SH0N6,"Ok, There are so many things wrong with this movie. First, and most obviously, the acting was so bad, the actors actually looked like they were about to start laughing, when the zombies were chasing them. It looked like a movie that a bunch of random people got together, with no experience, and just made one day.

The zombies and makeup, what a joke. The Zombies couldn't decide if they should run or walk, and the makeup was obviously fake in some shots.

The plot, What plot?! Well they finally piece it together, sort of at the end, but it still isn't clear really what happened, or how it happened.

The point. I am a zombie movie fanatic. This in my opinion is one of the worst examples of a zombie movie that I have ever seen. DO NOT BUY this movie. If you must see it RENT IT, before you buy it.

Edit: So one reason my review is so short and spite filled is because I made the mistake of actually buying this garbage. Allow me to go more in depth why this is one of the worst zombie films of all time.

1 video and audio: The first thing that you will notice when you start the film, is the camera. The visuals are grainy, blurry, and some of the camerawork itself is really bad. Things like how to position the camera to get the best shots just evade these people, and the end product actually looks worse than some youtube quality stuff. Then the audio is just as bad if not worse. The big thing is that you want to hear the actors when they talk, but not be deafened, when they scream, and this audio system that they use makes it where that is not possible. The normal conversations are to quiet, and then when the zombies attack, the volume goes up to 11. Not that there is much going on worth listening to.

2 Acting: It should be decided before you actually shoot the film, what you want your zombies to do, but in this mess of a movie they can't decide. In one scene you get slow romaro style zombies, in the next you get fast dawn of the dead remake zombies, that are actually smart enough to use sticks as weapons. There is no consistancy at all, and the human actors are not much better. Once again I compare it to bad youtube videos. These people have less talent than that kid who played Anakin in episode one. Their ability to act like realistic people in danger, the girl was about to crack up while being chased be her zombie boyfriend. I think that says something right there when not even your own cast can take this film seriously.

3 Story and other loose ends: There is not much to say. a Infected rabbit escapes a shady university. I got what started the outbreak, a rabbit. The rest, they try to piece it together but in the end. It makes no sense at all. There are so many things wrong that I'm not even going to try and mess with it. Another thing, unless you burn the zombies completely they will not die. There was no real dynamic between the characters. Oh and *Spoiler* if you watch the credits you'll see all of the characters die except for DR Crazy, big surprise.

In the end this film looks and feels like a group of collage kids and a few others, grabbed a camera and said lets make a zombie movie. I don't think that the group that made this had ANY experience in filmmaking. And to think that this ""Movie"" is now sitting on shelves nationwide. It makes me sick. Do not buy this film, I stand by what I said earlier that if you must see this, Rent it. But seriously it's not worth your time.",1320624000,,3436,4.235114503816794

I HAVE USED THE RED CAMERA ON 5 FEATURES, AND IT LOOKS PROFESSIONAL, BUT THESE VIDEOS GIVEN 5 STARS SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED! THANKS FOR THE REVIEWS, AND YES, SOME OF THESE REVIEWS WERE FUNNY AS HELL!",1261785600,,577,4.254545454545455
8238385,2,B0010SH0N6,"Man, somebody should review the reviewers of this movie.  Mr. ""Pericles"", you know way too much about a no name director, therefore you are plugging what would have otherwise been a very forgettable exercise in the genre.  Also, that scene you mentioned about the zombie experimentation?  That was a whopping minute and a half in movie that clocked in at over 90 minutes.  And as for Mr. ""Bill"" from Georgia, I saw both Count Yorga and I Eat Your Flesh and I have no freaking clue how you can draw a line of comparison between the two.  Yorga and Flesh were B movies, but not amateur.  This barely qualifies as a college thesis.  Not to slam Ms. Parker's movie entirely, it does deserve respect for the indie film that it is.  It is certainly no crime to make an extremely low budget film.  Good ideas and semi-plausible acting go a long way.  Where Parker's film falls short is in the story itself.  There are scenes of discontinuity that will make you smack your head in disbelief at how a director could let that go by:  one minute the rabbit is putting the chomp on someone and beginning the chain of events, then a real estate agent is getting mauled by a zombie that had obviously been shambling around the real estate dig for quite some time; there is a huge, revelatory flashback that does nothing to either move the story along or resolve it; another scientist, who had only one purpose of hunting for the rabbit and finding it, escapes a zombie mauling and falls unconscious for almost a day (???); the principal leads are all left hanging--I mean, one minute someone is spraying aerosol and then they are barricading the door and . . . . cut to that scientist's scene and roll the credits--you are guaranteed to say WTF.  Oh, and by the way Mr. Atragon, the choice of music sucked!  Who plays happy grunge music to build tension during a zombie mauling?  Think that's bad?  Listen to what's playing when one of the leads has to bury his cheating wife.  Here's a summary breakdown:
Acting--decent
Story--looked good on paper, but poorly executed
Rabbits--HOLY CRAP!!!!!!  That rabbit was the absolute best part of the movie!  It totally channeled Monty Python and the Caddyshack gopher.
Gore--respectable
Zombies--yet another indie movie that can't make up its mind whether to have the zombies run balls out, or take half a day to shamble somewhere; the redneck zombies at the beginning are annoying at first, but they'll grow on you!
Shooting/lighting--annoying at times, passable at most
Tension/story movement--the first 30 minutes were pretty good,
  but then the film bottoms out miserably.",1242432000,4,2605,4.757238307349666
8238386,1,B0010SH0N6,I absolutely love zombie movies and I have seen some real turkeys but this is a SERIOUSLY BAD MOVIE.  I couldn't get through it and I've seen Zombie Nation =p.  DO NOT BUY THIS!.,1235347200,,178,4.205882352941177
8238387,1,B0010SH0N6,"THIS HAS TO BE THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN. THE ACTING IS HORRIBLE, THE MAKE-UP IS WORSE, AND THE PLOT, WHAT PLOT? I WOULD'VE SENT IT BACK, BUT IT WOULD PROBABLY COST ME MORE TO DO THAT AND I ALREADY WASTED ENOUGH MONEY. THE ONLY THING GOOD ABOUT THE MOVIE IS WHEN IT FINALLY ENDED!! PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY. IT IS TRULY NOT WORTH IT.",1226534400,8,353,4.057142857142857
8238388,1,B0010SH0N6,take your money and go make a homeless person dance for it that would be more worth it. ugggg really poorly done,1216684800,4,112,4.136363636363637

Yes, the movie does have it's cheese factor and yes it it's kind of weak. The thing is though is that it was made on the cheap and no body involved in the production is trying to run from that.

Speaking from experience it is a miracle to get a group of people to come together via low-budget and make a go at anything let alone doing take after take in the woods during summertime. Around here we got cottonmouths and blood sucking ticks ""out da ying-yang"". Believe me when I tell you that not a woman, and not many men, in Suffolk wants to head out to the Dismal Swamp to make their mark on video or film. At least these folks pulled it off. Any body that doubts me then simply write a script involving the woods or a swamp and then try to get people to shoot in these locations for little or no money. Plan on at least feeding them a little something and buying a couple of cases of brew on occasion.

The movie did, in spite of the negativity, have a couple of interesting ideas in it that could potentially be expanded on. It is recommended for all low-budget wannabe's to get a glimpse into how it can be done.

Overall, I would put it somewhere in the middle of the scale. Frankly, I hope the director tries again with another story and a bigger budget.

Wanna see worse? Check out ""Last House on Hell Street"".",1215129600,,1414,4.222222222222222
