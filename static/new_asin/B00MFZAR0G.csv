8672028,2,B00MFZAR0G,"I'm rating it two stars because I'm a huge REO fan - especially of the line-up that was in this video.  The video quality is poor and the audio quality isn't that much better.  A couple more songs from Good Trouble would have bumped it up to 3 stars, but only one made it on the set list.  If the video and audio are ever cleaned up, it will be worth buying at that point.  I would never have purchased this at full price.  I took a chance because I had some reward points to spend.",1436140800,,482,3.9791666666666665
8672029,1,B00MFZAR0G,"Great performance,... as expected. REO rocks those German socks right off their feet. Unfortunately for this connoisseur of fine rock n roll, I will not be watching the video again. The picture quality is equal to what one would expect from a fourth generation VHS recording on EP. The picture quality is so poor I cannot sit through another viewing, (once may have been too much). Don't waste your money on this , grab the Riverport DVD for a great show with great picture and great tunes.",1413244800,5,490,4.64367816091954
