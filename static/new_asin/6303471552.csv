654326,3,6303471552,"No sequel can be fairly measured against its predecessor, in my opinion.  And 'Futureworld' is no exception.  While it lacks Michael Crichton's pen - known for deftly interweaving between sci-fi and suspense - 'Futureworld' actually goes so far as to expand upon the original story, which is something few sequels, even good ones, have been able to do.  While the production values do seem to indicate the studio was willing to crap this one out as a TV movie if they thought it wouldn't float their boat at the box office, there's still plenty of shock value to enjoy in 'Futureworld', even if its plot does tend to veer now and then into slightly-cartoonish realms...and even then, the film isn't afraid to remind its viewer that it's not to be taken too seriously.
The plot is as follows: it's been a couple of years since the original film's theme-park disaster - a situation not helped by the dirt dug up by investigative reporter Chuck Browning (Peter Fonda, smug and cocky as Han Solo, only in corduroys and specs) - but Delos is back up and running, better than ever, and the world entire is coming en masse through the new park's gates.  But still, the Delos suits regale to Browning's media peers, attendance isn't quite as record-shattering as they'd like...so they invite a wary Browning and his ex-girlfriend, ambitious TV reporter Tracy Ballard (Blythe Danner, who gives as good as she gets with a flair worthy of Lois Lane), to see for themselves that Delos has truly become the Eden it was meant to be.
Alas, with this new Eden there turns out to be a new snake lurking as well...namely, suspicious goings-on within the underground command centers of the park.  Surrounding this is a bizarre tapestry of puzzle pieces - a runaway Delos worker shot dead in Browning's arms; an all-too-real nightmare of red-garbed figures carting off guests in their sleep and performing Byzantine examinations; a reclusive mechanic (Stuart Margolin in a likeable performance) who's seen more than he probably should have; and before it's all over, the horrible secret of the new Delos revealed.  It's no 'Soylent Green', but then that's probably a good thing.
If 'Westworld' dealt with the dangers of relying upon corporated technology for pleasure, then 'Futureworld' is about what happens when said corporated technology threatens to overtake entire societies.  While this isn't exactly prescient to the competitiveness of today's theme-park industry, it does allude to the rat-a-tat-a-tat attitude that defined much of the industry in the early 1990s (when Universal Studios moved in on Disney World and lit the fuse on a full-blown theme-park war).
Apart from all this, the movie does have some other nifty touches: an opening sequence which winks at the original with a clip from a game show of a future Delos guest receiving his vacation package from real-life game show host Allen Ludden; the new 'Futureworld' themed area with one of the neatest (if slightly low-budget) arcades ever seen; constant innuendo involving 'sex-model' robots; and, of course, a cameo by none other than Yul Brynner, once more garbed in black as the Gunslinger - only this time the tin man with the gunbelt seems to have gotten a heart, demonstrated in an erotic dream sequence where he rescues Danner's character from some more of those red-hooded fiends.
'Futureworld' may not resemble 'Westworld' too much, but that probably works to its advantage in the end, opting to take the somewhat-hackneyed 'robots-run-amok' premise in a new direction.  It's worth a look.",1083888000,83,3550,5.005084745762712
654327,1,6303471552,"It was very much anticipated after the success of ""Westworld"" that this movie would be just as good as the original.  Sorry to say that it doesn't do any good!  Yul Brenner is only in this movie for about 2 minutes, and that's in a dream sequence!!  Don't waste your time on purchasing or watching this retread!  It's a waste of time and money!!",1067904000,3,345,4.34375
654328,3,6303471552,"American International Pictures' mostly successful sequel to MGM's Westworld finds ex-lover journalists Peter Fonda and Blythe Danner following a murdered informant's tip to look into suspicious activities inside the recently reopened robot theme park, Delos.  Everything appears kosher on the surface  -  the homicidal programming flaw which cost a few former Delos guests their lives has long since been removed and safeguarded against  -  but something still just isn't quite right.  The pair pretty quickly find out that the robots have become so advanced, they now build and repair themselves  -  and even run Delos, with only a minimum of human assistance.  In fact, the robots think they might even run the world, if their clandestinely manufactured duplicates of several visiting media personalities and heads of state pass muster...
The filmmaking is average, about the level of a T.V. movie of the time, but the script is pretty snappy (even if the basic story is a bit hackneyed), and the chemistry and repartee between Danner and Fonda is terrific.  Danner, especially, has rarely been more adorable  -  Yul Brynner makes a cameo appearance reprising his no-longer-murderous robot gunslinger, to do a sexy little dream ballet sequence with her.  There are some odd bits of business in the film more appropriate to a fantasy than a sci-fi flick  -  holographic robot ninjas, with all-too-real swords, come immediately to mind  -  and the movie spends more time on titillation than actual plot development for far too long, but overall this movie delivers.  The suspense is good, the direction loose but effective.  The best sequences involve the drugged nocturnal abduction of Fonda and Danner and the duo's subsequent confrontation with their lethal robot duplicates  -  who must eliminate them, in order to take their place.
Could have been better, but still well worth watching.",1030752000,7,1892,5.219269102990033

This just lacks any of the excitement that Westworld had. The characters spent most of the movie in service tunnels (parts of Houston, TX) instead of Futureworld, Romanworld, etc...

Frankly I am finding Amazon Prime selection of movies, to be just as disappointing as other steraming services, when it comes to classic Sci-Fi. Sure Amazon has titles I am interested in, but they cost extra, from what's available to Prime only, Futureword seemed like a hidden gem.

Unfortunately I didn't feel that it was all that great. Unlike Westworld, where you had a decent balance of the Wild West and Sci-Fi, Futureworld only offered a cursory splash of the themed guest attraction, while spending most of the time on the inner workings of the park. Maybe that's okay. The plot seems less believable than Westworld - more over the top conspiracy than a more believable line of robot antics, misunderstanding their role or maybe overestimating their abilities.

What about Yul Brynner? His name is used to sell the movie, but his role is meaningless. (In Westworld, his role was flat, yet believable) In Futureworld it's completely disconnected with the continuity of the plot and has no place - a complete misrepresentation and abuse of his name and rhetoric. Was he paid,? Did he care? Don't know, but we should feel cheated non the less.

Of the older Sci-Fi selection, Futureworld is pretty good. That's not saying much good about the selection.

Although somewhat related to the Westworld series, it's really quite far removed and follows a completely different storyline of a scam plot rather than a technical malfunction leading to robot a uprising threating extinction to all Humans.

The story line was really boring. Acting was pretty bad (which can be usually be overlooked if the storyline is strong enough)

The pogrommers have gone on to illegally seize all personal property including stocks and bonds and control of all financial accounts.  Most recent pogrommer efforts have been to introduce an ""Internet of Things"" whereby the entire life support systems of humans are subject to *at whim* hostile modification.  Even the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act has been flagrantly violated by such as the ""Facebook"" publication of confidential personal information used as passwords into virtually every financial account while the Federal Trade Commission has been denied any enforcement capability,  The film was more an explanation of civil and human rights violating pogrommer intent since implemented than a fictional presentation.",1475798400,,1119,5.676646706586826

Yul Brynner's appearance is incidental, and while he is the only character/actor to be carried over from Westworld, his performance is certainly not pivotal in the story.

Futureworld is enjoyable, though a completely different direction from the ""robots-run-amok"" in Michael Crichton's original Westworld story. In this, while the robots have indeed run amok, they've somehow developed a level of sophistication to turn them into megalomaniacs. There is no explanation for how this may have happened, however.

Car's that required unleaded fuel were new, many vehicles still ran on regular ""leaded"" gasoline.  Russia was a communist country and cable television with as many as 16 channels was something that was new and mostly available in larger cities.  If you can accept those realities of the characters then you will understand how the effects are really quite special.  A lot of this thriller movie is built on suspense which is delivers in spades.  It is definitely not recommended for pre-teens simply because of the nature of the movie it can result in some substantial nightmares (due to the plot).  I like it because it focuses on a story line and the characters rather than special effects to deliver the story and suspense.",1463961600,,897,4.711538461538462

656845,3,6303471552,"The follow-up to ""Westworld"" falls firmly in place with other 70's paranoia fueled conspiracy sci-fi films ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", ""Hangar 18"", ""Capricorn One"" and to a degree ""Alien"". If you enjoy the 70's vibe, and like more of a slow build, than an action packed film, then give this one a try.

A few years after the events shown in ""Westworld"", Delos is back and bigger than ever. While Westworld is close, there are now several more fantasy realms open to the vacation-going public, Pompeii, Renaissance England, a Fountain of Youth is available in Spa, and the newly opened Futureworld where you can pilot a spacecraft and walk on Mars...and needless to say have unlimited sex with a variety of willing robotic partners. While the parks are open, attendance is not what Delos is hoping for, so they decide to have their most harsh critics stay for a week with access to all parts of the park, both the tourist areas as well as the working areas. Delos hopes that if the reporters will write and produce glowing reviews that their parks will be packed to capacity, but it's not long before the reporters uncover something a bit more sinister going on in Futureworld.

Honestly, I found ""Futureworld"" a bit too talky, specifically coming off the heels of ""Westworld"". While I like the premise, it's done much better in the phenomenal 1978 version of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"". ""Futureworld"" isn't a bad movie, it's just not a very good one.",1457481600,,1462,4.774703557312253

The sequel to ""Westworld,"" ""Futureworld"" picks up the story about several years after the tragedy of robots running amok and killing guests at all previous Delos theme parks.
To combat all the negative publicity caused by their malfunctioning robots, the executives at Delos have launched a no-holds bar publicity campaign to garner good press to bring people back to their theme parks in droves.  So naturally as America's top broadcast and print journalists, Tracy Ballard and Chuck Browning are invited for an exclusive behind the scenes peak.
Only all is not well at Delos.  A Delos mechanic is murdered after arranging to meet Browning to reveal what is going on behind the scenes at Futureworld.  In order to discover what is really going on in Futureworld, Browning and Ballard, who are ex-lovers, must put aside the differences and begin to trust each other again if they are to survive.
What is stunning about Futureworld is the justification given for murdering and replacing humans with biological android replacements - ""Humans will destroy the Earth in 10 years unless we Robots act to protect them.""  I think I now know where the Great Global Climate Change Hoaxer Al Gore got his ""10 years to save the planet"" line.
Also in ""Futureworld,"" there is an intriguing male/male sex robot romance that is only hinted at when the mechanic says ""the outside world would never understand about us.""  A bit daring for the 1970s.
Futureworld is an intense conspiracy thrill ride.  Westworld is the far superior movie - sadly HBO is doing a remake - yet Futureworld is one of those rare sequels that stand on their own and advance the story line of the universe projected in the first movie.
There was a short-lived television show spun off from ""Futureworld"" called ""Beyond Westworld.""
Compelling and Absorbing.
Strongly Recommended!

The plot is even more far-fetched than Westworld and it is somewhat dated in parts but doesn't stray into goofiness like Westworld occasionally did. This movie should be fun for older sci-fi fans. Peter Fonda and Blythe Danner are great. I love Stuart Margolin's character and was rooting for his escape. His friendship with the older and somewhat malfunctioning robot, Clark was actually kind of touching. Music is decent except the main theme repeats too often.

The '70s tendency to strive for cool adds a bit of sap to the acting, but there's something charmingly nostalgic about that, too. The writers went for way too much in the plot. Westworld was simple -- people go to a computerized robot-populated fantasy land; computers malfunction and the robots turn homicidal. All the robots were bad guys, but Yul Brynner was the main focus, and he was menacing and relentless. Good fun. Futureworld goes for a complex political back story, and it's just not very well developed. All-in-all it's worth the three bucks, but don't go there if you're looking for intellectual stimulation -- it ain't 2001.",1434499200,,799,4.925925925925926

Light on action, but more surreal this time around. Still a pretty good film, if you don't compare it to the original film. The only holdover is Yul Brynner as The Gunslinger.

If you liked Westworld for the action, Futureworld won't deliver.  I think Futureworld is much closer to a dedicated dystopian science fiction movie because it expands on what Delos really is and uncovers a thicker and more involved plot than the realtitivly simple survival forumula of Westworld.  Comparisons aside, I think Futureworld was well done, the storyline does have a few layers and it maintains a decent balance between them.

Actors Peter Fonda & Blythe Danner star as
2 Newspaper reporters that investigate the tragic events that happened at westworld
the theme park DELOS has been re-instated re-opened now few years later after what happened at Westworld
but Roman world & Medieval world are the only parks that have been re-opened, Westworld is still closed down
Peter fonda who plays Chuck Browning & Blythe Danner who plays Tracy Ballard
go back to DELOS to investigate the new improved robots that have been re-made for
Roman/Medeval world
and what they findout During the last 15mins of the film is that Guests have been Duplicated/cloned
where you can't tell the Humans from the Machines even when you look in the mirror
Pretty Damn scary
both Chuck & Tracy have been Duplicated by their DNA
and the real Chuck & Tracy spend the rest of the film killing their Clones
the Highlights of this sequel are the special visual effects that were Definitley ahead of it's time
Groundbreaking for a film made in back 1976 for eg
there are some extra scenes of Robots being fixed,
one of the scenes is where a robot appears to be alive while being worked on
the Computer Graphics in the DELOS control room look amazing
another scene where Chuck & Tracy play Chess at DELOS,
the battle scenes on the chess board look very realistic
a Great Visual effect scene
Tracy's Dream sequence made my a machine/Device that Creates Dreams
this Dream sequence is where Yul Brynner makes a cameo appearance as the Gunslinger
and many more Great visual effects scenes that look similar in this film
Definitley were ahead of their time

shout factory have given this film a new High Definition transfer in 1:85:1 widescreen
 with new Master audio stereo mix
and the picture quality does look much sharper & clearer than the old dvd release from years ago

tragically no new special features which is very unfortunate, the old DVD release had no extras anyway
so i thought this new blu-ray release would have new retrospective interviews
with Peter Fonda & Blythe Danner at least,
but nothing just the Theatrical trailer & Stills Gallery has been added that's it
maybe Peter and Blythe Declined to be interviewed, it's anybody's guess why
if you do love this sequel or you think this sequel is Good enough just to buy & watch for curiosity reasons
get this blu-ray release much better picture quality than the old dvd release

3 stars i gave it meaning it's Good sequel but average Blu-ray release

Well, the entire resort has now been rebuilt and redesigned to be completely fail-safe. To combat the lingering adverse publicity, Duffy, the Delos representative, has offered the IMC Communication Network exclusive rights to the new Delos story. Tracy Ballard [Blythe Danner], the network's top commentator, has been assigned the story with Chuck Browning [Peter Fonda], the newspaper reporter who broke the original Westworld disaster story. But as Tracy and Chuck's private tour starts, they get the feeling the entire resort might not be as safe as Delos thinks...

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: Westworld [1973] was a popular, slick science fiction adventure produced at M-G-M and written and directed by Michael Crichton. It offered up a then-novel concept - a malfunction at a futuristic theme park that results in mass casualties of guests and park technicians alike. The movie was a box-office hit and its producer, Paul Lazarus III, developed a follow-up, although without the direct involvement of Crichton. When M-G-M passed on the property, Lazarus and co-producer James T. Aubrey bought the sequel rights from Crichton and brought their story to famous low-budget producer Samuel Z. Arkoff and his American International Pictures (AIP). The result was Futureworld [1976], which wisely avoided the theme-park-run-amok scenario of the first film Michael Crichton himself would revisit that theme years later with his novel and screenplay of Jurassic Park [1993]. Instead, the sequel delved into a deeper conspiracy plot involving the Delos corporate entity, placing Futureworld squarely in the company of other post-Watergate 1970s films that exploited the general mistrust of political, industrial, and corporate institutions.

The film stars Peter Fonda and Blythe Danner, as a pair of reporters invited to review the re-opening of the Delos adult-themed parks, one of which was the 'Westworld' of the original movie. 'Westworld' has been closed down, although 'Medieval World' and 'Roman World' are reopening. New to the Delos theme parks this time around are 'Spa World' and the namesake of the film, 'Futureworld.' Reporters Chuck Browning [Peter Fonda] and Tracy ""Socks"" Ballard [Blythe Danner] are asked by Delos to come and check things out, so the public at large can be assured that Delos is no longer dangerous (we learn early in the film that over 50 people had been killed by robots as a result of the events happening in Westworld).

Chuck Browning is already suspicious about the parks before leaving for the trip, as he has witnessed the death of an informant who was attempting to provide him with information about Delos. Browning and Ballard aren't at Futureworld very long before they discover one of the main reasons why things are different. In the original movie, the robots were being controlled by a group of scientists in a large control room...this time; the men in the control room are robots too! But that's just the tip of the iceberg, as the investigative pair will soon unravel an even darker purpose for the re-opening of the parks.

One of the advantages 'Futureworld' has over its predecessor is with its lead actors. Fonda and Danner have good chemistry together and make strong leads. That, however, is pretty much the only aspect of the movie that proves to be better than the original film. Because the viewer already has an idea of what the Delos parks are like, there's no sense of fun and discovery like there was in the first movie. Also, while this film also concludes with an extended chase sequence between a pair of characters, it can't compete with the hunting of the Richard Benjamin character by the evil Gunslinger [Yul Brynner] from the original.

Futureworld feels as if it were shot on location at an industrial theme park thanks to extensive shooting at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. Prominent as ""sets"" are such distinctive sights as the giant circular latch of the Space Environment Simulator Laboratory (which was also featured prominently in the posters and advertising of the film), and one of the Mission Operations Control Rooms, with its familiar rows of computer monitors facing a large bank of tracking screens. The film was also shot in several other locations in Houston, making liberal use of the late 1960s-early 1970s Modern architecture of the Hyatt Regency Hotel, the lobby of Jones Hall, and the tram system at the Houston Intercontinental Airport.

Speaking of Yul Brynner, his character returns in 'Futureworld' in one of the most pointless and senseless cameos ever captured on film. He appears in the movie for about a minute, utters no dialogue and his only purpose seems to be so that the filmmakers could advertise the return of his character in the attempt to sell a few more tickets.

There's little doubt that 'Futureworld' is a slightly inferior film to Westworld, but it deserves credit for at least trying to do something a little different instead of giving audiences a by-the-numbers sequel that follows the same notes of the original. Even with Fonda and Danner as the leads, the film looks and feels more like something made for the small screen than the silver screen, which means it might play a little better on home video today than the way it did in theatres back in the 1970s (where it was considered a flop).

Although by 1976 Computer Generated Imagery (CGI) had been seen in several short animated films, Futureworld was the first feature film to incorporate such effects, and Peter Fonda was no doubt the first major actor to have his face ""digitized"" for the big screen. The 3-D wireframes for the film were created by a couple of graduate students at the University of Utah. One of these students, Edwin Catmull, would go on to become a leading figure in the CGI genre at Lucasfilm, PIXAR and Disney.

Blu-ray Video Quality  While this is no doubt the better of the two films, 'Futureworld' is the best of the bunch on this home video release, there are still some issues with the picture quality as the primary problem being the age of the print. There are evident scratches, dirt, and other defects in the presentation that are evident throughout the entire movie. Some scenes look better in HD than others, but most have a ""washed out"" look to them and lack the kind of detail, sharpness, and overall ""pop"" one expects in 1080p. Black levels are also an issue throughout most of the movie, with details often being lost in some of the darker scenes (of which there are many). Although there are issues with the picture, for the most part colours and skin tones are well balanced and the movie retains a film-like look throughout, with a healthy dose of grain that is always present but never obtrusive. The presentation pales in comparison to the work Warner Bros. did on the Westworld Blu-ray, but there's nothing too serious here that would deter one's viewing enjoyment, it's just a very average transfer by high-definition standards.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The only track on this release is a 2.0 DTS-HD Stereo Master Audio that (obviously) doesn't provide much in terms of activity or immersion, but is certainly solid nevertheless. Both the dialogue and musical soundtrack, which I actually prefer to 'Westworld,' are clear and well-balanced. When I reviewed Westworld, I noted that the spoken word and music soundtrack almost seemed separate from one another, with the score overbearing when compared to the dialogue of the actors. No such problems here, as everything is properly balanced, with no noticeable issues one often hears from older films, like popping or hissing in the track. Subtitles are also available, but only in English.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Theatrical Trailer [1976] [1080i] [3:00] This is the original theatrical trailer for 'Futureworld.' Like a lot of trailers, this one gives away the major plot points, so be sure to avoid it until you have watched the actual film.

Radio Spots [1:00] Two 30-second radio spots for the film.

Still Gallery [1080p] [1:00] A 60 second slide show that consists of preproduction artwork and movie posters for the film. It's a video slide show, meaning you don't need to use your remote control to advance from one picture to the next, but you will need to use your remote control to pause on any one still image.

Finally, Westworld was a fun throwback to the kind of fairly low rent sci-fi fare that used to populate drive-ins in the late fifties, albeit gussied up in a lot of techno-speak and proto-futuristic trappings. Ironically, Futureworld hasn't aged half as well as Westworld has, looking decidedly dowdy and old fashioned, perhaps due to its relatively meagre budget and American-International production roots. Performances here are okay, though one gets the distinct impression most of the major players were wishing they were in some other world, like an A-list film, when they were shooting this escapade. This Blu-ray has some fairly problematic video issues, though the audio is quite good. Fans of Blythe Danner, who never really got her due as a leading actress in films, may want to check this out, one way or the other. But for Michael Crichton fans that are aching for a film about technology running amok in an amusement park facility, the much better bet would of course be the Jurassic Park franchise. Despite this slight flaw compared to the original film, I am still glad I have added it to my Blu-ray Collection and if you are a fan of this sci-fi genre, then you will not go wrong, but sadly with the way films are made today, this now looks very dated. Recommended!

An inferior sequel to Michael Chricton's Westworld sci-fi where two reporters ( Peter Fonda and Blythe Danner ) enter to the new Futureworld theme park ( as a futuristic Disneyland ) for adult vacation , a pleasure palace resort called Delos which offers the opportunity to live in several fantasy worlds .It's ruled by powerful people ( Arthur Hill and John P.Ryan ) and serviced by lifelike robots that are turning against their creators and a planning to take over the world .

The film gets stimulating in parts, action , chilling twists , thriller , suspense and is quite entertaining . It's made big scale and lavish budget but in a serial style of the thirties or forties .

657477,3,6303471552,"THE STORY: Sort-of follow up to WESTWORLD features more runamok robots, but the mystery here centers on who is controlling these next generation automatons ...and what is their ultimate goal?

THOUGHTS: WESTWORLD is a minor sci-fi classic. Thrilling entertainment as a simple stand alone film, it also gave moviegoers something to talk about on their way home from the theater. The F/X were effective enough to give futurist paranoids something to shudder at; machines who were so close to, but not quite, real people. What if these robotic impostors were to try and integrate into our society? FUTUREWORLD offers some intriguing ideas that follow that line of thinking, but ultimately it falls short of being a truly worthy successor. Film offers good performances by its leads and some minimal but interesting visual flair, too. But that's about it. FW had some tall boots to fill after Yul Brynner's classic iconic short-circuiting cyborg cowboy, so they were setting themselves up for failure almost from the start. I give the producers credit for at least doing something other than just a safe, by-the-numbers sequel to the original. Whether or not they succeeded is up to the viewer to decide. I did not enjoy FUTUREWORLD anywhere near as much as I'd hoped. However, as with all things, YMMV.

THE BLU-RAY: Transfer of FUTUREWORLD looks very nice here in hi-def. The Blu-Ray release from Shout! Factory has a decent picture & sound. Bonus extras include the theatrical trailer, radio ads & a still photos gallery.

657547,2,6303471552,"No doubt this is a sequel to the popular ""Westworld"" (1973), but the direction this time around moves toward action thriller rather than the sci-fi/horror hybrid of the original.  There are advantages to this change, but the uninspired script fails to capitalize on any of them.  Thirty minutes in, the filmmakers should have realized they had a problem on their hands.  The dull screenplay called for the two heroes to wonder aimlessly for an hour through an underground tunnel until finally some real conflict and adversity occurs in the final twenty minutes.  By then, who cares what happens to the protagonists?  The general plot could have yielded excitement and suspense, but instead the filmmakers obviously felt they had a solid cerebral thriller on their hands.  Unfortunately, the end product suffers from a lack of urgency and tension.  Actors Peter Fonda and Blythe Danner are likable, but they are asked to do too much here.  Sometimes a lackluster script cannot be overcome no matter who stars in the picture.  By the way, Yul Brynner's cameo is totally unnecessary to the plot.  His appearance may have helped the studio promote this film, but frankly it does little else.  Director Richard T. Heffron is due mild praise for at least keeping much of visual look of the first entry.

657586,4,6303471552,"Shout! Factory is always ready to pounce on a great opportunity. They show their smarts again by following up Warner Home Video's release of ""Westworld"" on Blu-ray with their very own high definition version of its 1976 sequel, ""Futureworld."" Although the film is considered by many to be a poor excuse for a sequel,it has its own cult followers who are more than happy to see it getting an upgrade.

After the tragic deaths of several guests at the hands of robots in ""Westworld,"" Delos decides to invite reporters Tracy and Chuck to the rebuilt resort. Delos representatives want to prove to the public that their new vactioning spots are completely safe and their robots are under control and harmless. As Tracy and Chuck investigate ""Futureworld,"" they begin to suspect there's something sinister behind Delos' welcoming embrace.

Judging ""Futureworld"" on its own merits, I found it to be a mildly entertaining slice of 1970's sci-fi. The movie's warnings against allowing machines and computers too much control and relying on them too heavily seems prophetic in hindsight. For 1976, I'm sure it felt fresh and was terrifying for a world that was just barely embracing electronics and the technology we take for granted today. Director Richard T. Heffron and writers George Schenck and Mayo Simon don't really do much more here besides expand on the concepts Michael Crichton came up with for ""Westworld.""

The only actor to return from ""Westworld"" for this sequel is Yul Brenner. He isn't given much to do here. He basically walks around and has an awkward love scene with Blythe Danner. Honestly, it's uncomfortable to watch. Peter Fonda is great as a chauvenistic wisecracking 1970's reporter that could never get away with his treatment of Danner's character in modern times.

The high definition transfer for ""Futureworld"" cleans up the picture and presents it as clear as one can expect for a low-budget film from the 1970s. Thankfully, the Blu-ray upgrade didn't rob it of any of the beautiful graininess and nostalgic flavor of the movie. The 2.0 stereo doesn't immerse home viewers in a sea of sound effects, dialogue, and music like they're accustomed to. However, it still sounds better than it ever has in its past home video formats.

It's no surprise that this edition of ""Futureworld"" doesn't feature much in the way of bonus material. The film wasn't given much thought at the time of its release. MGM dropped the ball on the production and gave it away to AIP (American International Pictures).

I highly doubt anyone was thinking about preserving the history surrounding the making of ""Futureworld."" Unfortunately, this means no ""Making of"" featurette or interviews with the filmmakers or producers. The only special features we get are a theatrical trailer, radio spots, and a still gallery.

""Futureworld"" is a fun and nostalgic journey back into the 1970s. Its interesting to see what the state of science fiction cinema was even a year before ""Star Wars"" breathed life into a dying genre. You'll not find any of the carefree advetnure and joy we found in ""a Galaxy Far, Far Away"" in the dystopic and doomed ""Futureworld"" of our making.",1366070400,2,3162,5.0

657591,3,6303471552,"After ""Westworld"" was released, producer Paul N. Lazarus III wanted to go ahead with a sequel, ""Futureworld."" However, with Crichton not being involved and MGM in the midst of some financial difficulties, the studio passed, leading the producers to head over to Samuel Z. Arkoff and his American-International Pictures, who gladly picked up the tab for the follow-up.

The resulting FUTUREWORLD has the look and feel of a TV-movie, no surprise with small-screen vet Richard T. Heffron (""V: The Final Battle"") sitting in the director's chair. The far less inspired, though still involving, script follows reporters Peter Fonda and Blythe Danner as they try and uncover a conspiracy involving the Delos Corporation and their latest futuristic theme park, one that includes an outerspace component - thanks to some location shooting at the Johnson Space Center in Texas - and another roster of robots who just can't stay out of trouble.

Fred Karlin returned to score ""Futureworld"" and musically gets much more to do here, churning out an effective `70s suspense score as opposed to the mostly western-flavored country soundtrack of its predecessor. ""Futureworld"" also attempts to craft a much more involved storyline here, but neither Fonda or Danner are interesting, and Yul Brynner contributes a weird cameo during a dream sequence that's particularly sad since it marked Brynner's final screen appearance. The cast is rounded out with familiar supporting faces (John P. Ryan, Arthur Hill, Stuart Margolin, even a cameo from Allen Ludden), but the movie's bloated running time makes one pine for the thrifty narrative Crichton instilled in ""Westworld.""

While not as satisfying as ""Westworld,"" ""Futureworld"" is still a worthwhile view for `70s sci-fi fans, especially geeks nostalgic for the Tang-centric era of NASA exploration. Shout's Blu-Ray of ""Futureworld"" includes a just-about-acceptable 1080p transfer culled from the MGM vaults; there's some DNR on the image, but this isn't a particularly great-looking film to begin with (shot flat at 1.85, it doesn't have nearly the visual impact of its predecessor), so most fans will have to be content with its better-than-DVD enhancement.

657632,1,6303471552,The seller was fine so this has nothing to do with them at all. This movie was just terrible to me because they didn't show much of the robots. That's the whole reason why I bought it...to see the mechanical creepy robots like in the first one. The first one showed the inner workings of them more and focused on the robots more. I know they were trying to change it up so it wasn't just like the first one but they could've done better. They showed the robots but they were just humans playing them so they didn't seem like robots or act like them very well.

657633,1,6303471552,"I can see why they would want to cash in on Westworld's immense positive reception. In fact I keep a vintage original poster of it on my wall. The problem with this story of replacing originals with duplicates had only just been released a year earlier as a movie called the Stepford Wives. So these were important powerful people rather then woman the husbands wanted to be obedient slaves. But the point is, in both movies their was a human, duplicated into a perfect clone robot and the person/persons who called the shots. The most offensive thing back when me and my buddies went to see it was that the posters had Yul Brynner's name on it, and we thought, yessssss, somehow the psychotic Cowboy is gonna be brought back to make Fondas and Danners life a running scary hell like it had been for Richard Benjamin in the first.

No such luck. Brenner's scenes are some pitiful dream sequence with Bythe Danner which raised the snore level to almost emergency levels. Coupling this with the same emphasis on the Bimbo line of Robot men and women, Fondas prowling around maintenance areas and the over used phrase Start XYZ sequence on my mark in 3,2,1, press the button, over and over again and what you have is a sit in shell shock mode and wait for the ending. And even then you have the film ending with Fonda, no doubt in a nod to his 60s hipster image, giving the head honcho the bird to show that he and Danner had outwitted his plans to replace them with his own duplicates, working in the media putting out nice, and positive happy  stories about Delos.  FutureWorld is merely a rewash of Westworld without the cleverness, humor or edge of your seat climatic chase.

657635,3,6303471552,"Michael Crichton's ""Westworld"" was a surprise gamble for a studio that was on wobbly legs at the time. So, naturally, because it was a hit, the film demanded a sequel.

SPOILERS:

Set a few years after the disaster at the Delos adult amusement part, ""Futureworld"" follows two rival reporters Chuck Browning (Peter Fonda) and Tracy Ballard (Blythe Danner)who are invited to do a story on the revived amusement part as part of a publicity campaign to jump start business for the Delos organization. Delos has added a new theme park Futureworld that both Browning and Ballard are scheduled to visit.

Browning, however, has a source working at Delos who indicates that something has gone wrong again at Delos but, before Browning can find out what Frenchy knows, his source is killed. Browning needs to discover what Frenchy had before those at Delos (Arthur Hill and John Ryan)discover what he is up to.

The Blu-ray from Shout! Factory does a nice job of bringing this 1976 film to Blu-ray. Although not quite as sharp as the recent Warner reissue of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Westworld-Blu-ray/dp/B00AATFJK2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Westworld [Blu-ray</a>], the film looks quite good. There is some evident print damage sprinkled throughout the film that could have been easily repaired and it's clear that Shout! Factory either didn't have the money or used the existing transfer prepared for the DVD on Demand that MGM issued last year (and German Blu-ray of 2011).

The textures are quite nice and the colors look quite decent. The Blu-ray is an upgrade compared on the DVD-R that MGM issued last year although it isn't quite as night and day as some titles. We get an English 2.0 lossless soundtrack with English subtitles (an advantage over the German edition which had a 16 bit audio transfer as I recall). The soundtrack is quite good--dialogue is crisp and clear for the most part. We get English subtitles.

This edition is region A locked.

Amazon lists that there aren't any special features and that isn't quite accurate. While ""Futureworld"" doesn't have the vintage featurettes that ""Westworld"" provided, it does have a stills gallery (there are also some storyboards included) and the original radio vintage radio advertisements included along side the original film trailer.

As those who have the German edition know, that edition had a NASA ""Science Fact vs. Fiction"" featurette which should have been included here. There was also a 45 minute 8 mm version of ""Futureworld"" included on the German edition as an extra. That was a curious extra but kind of interesting and might have been nice to include here but probably wasn't due to rights or cost issues.

It would have been nice if someone like Fonda or Danner had been contacted to provide a commentary track or interviews about the making of the film. It's a missed opportunity.

Although certainly elements of the film have aged (it does take place in 1985 which was nearly a decade away when the film was made and does an extension of the technology of the time), the film remains entertaining.

For me ""Futureworld"" isn't quite as engaging as ""Westworld"" where the story was as much about investigating the theme park as it was about how things go awry for our heroes in that film. Nevertheless, Simon's story would have made an interesting and fun science fiction mystery without the trappings of the Delos universe added to it. The script by Simon written with George Schenck (who would later write and co-produce the TV show ""NCIS"")uses a pretty common story idea grafting it on to the Delos universe created by writer-director-producer Michael Crichton for his first film pretty effectively (and further mined for a short lived TV serires ""Beyond Westworld"" which, beyond the basic premises, has little to do with either film).

While missing both the social satire and critique at the the heart of Michael Crichton's film ""Westworld"", ""Futureworld"" still manages to be entertaining and fans who saw the film when it was first released in 1976 or on TV aftewards will enjoy this release.",1363046400,2,4678,5.410714285714286

The chemistry between the main characters (played by Peter Fonda and Blythe Danner) is actually above average and probably saves the film from utter failure.  However, I enjoyed myself despite the predictability, the absolutely silly premise, the lack of action (there's a sword fight and that's about it) and the anti-climactic ending.

If a sci-fi film doesn't have frequent action sequences and beautiful spaceships it MUST ask some engaging questions, present moral dilemmas, ponder on philosophical themes, etc  - Futureworld, on the other hand ""thinks"" with the ""brain"" of a rather small and sickly ant.  And what an unfortunate last film appearance for Yul Brynner (a campy dream sequence with Blythe Danner)...

Plot (some spoilers due to the simplicity and predictability of the plot)

Chuck Browning (Peter Fonda), a reporter who wrote about the ""incident"" at Westworld, and TV reporter Tracy Ballard (Blythe Danner), are called to write about the newly ""improved"" Delos amusement part which has reopened.  Previously Browning had met with an employee of Delos who promised information about the new park.  However, he's killed before he can deliver it.  As a result, Browning is suspicious of the motives of Delos.  Tracy on the other hand is convinced that Browning is blowing everything out of proportion.  Our ""heros"" are guided through various worlds -- Medievalworld, Romanworld, Westernworld (since abandoned), and finally, the park chosen by Tacy and Chuck, Futureworld (the one I would select!) -- and all the wonders are shown to be safe and improved.

In Futureworld, patrons are ""sent up into space"" in a rocket to a space station and perform various space walks and skiing on mars etc.  It's revealed to our heros that most of the new theme park worlds are staffed entirely by robots.

When Tracy and Chuck return from Futureworld they are drugged and tests are run on them in order to produce clones (surprise!!!!).  In the only real action sequence of the film, Chuck and Tracy accidentally trigger the clone machine which produces some wimpy samurais.  They are rescued by a friendly mechanic (one of the last non-robots) who has a faceless robot pall whom he plays card games with.  Eventually our heros figure out that all the important diplomats and generals asked by Delos to visit the reopening of the park are really going to be cloned in a plan to take over the world.

Final thoughts

In short, don't expect anything unexpected.  Don't expect any revolutionary sci-fi elements (I did discover that this as the first feature film to use 3D CGI!).  Don't expect particularly good acting.  Oh, and watch for the campy dream sequence -- it has absolutely no plot value and apparently, Blythe Danner trotting around with Yul Brynner was a fantasy that many women had at this time....  I dunno.

However, this is a really fun film which commits all the sins of B-film sci-fi.  It might be better than Westworld...",1290816000,18,3000,5.022267206477733
657686,2,6303471552,"The Bottom Line:

Westworld isn't one of the greatest movies ever made but it gives the viewer a sense of vicarious pleasure and intrigue through the world of Delos, not to mention a riveting chase sequence near the end; by contrast, Futureworld is lacking in almost anything interesting and has long, long sequences in which people stand around and talk without anything interesting to say.

Okay maybe the androids aren't malfunctioning this time, but they are replacing people in an attempt to take over the world - a good plot if you ask me. The first film was just a suspense movie, but this one is not only suspenseful, it's a political thriller with a lot of mystery in it as well.

The Delos company is trying to recover from the deadly events of Westworld. Assuring people that they have corrected their mistakes, and that their amusement park is now completely safe. To try and attract new customers they now have a Futureworld setting. Everything seems normal until a reporter gets a mysterious call from somebody who warns him that something strange is going on at Delos, but when he goes to meet the man, he finds him dead. Now as he begins to investigate Delos, he uncovers a shocking revelation. The androids have replaced everybody at Delos and they intend to take over the world.

I wish I could add this to my collection.",1258416000,3,331,4.655172413793103
657689,3,6303471552,"I re-watched WESTWORLD a few weeks ago, and shortly afterwards got around to re-watching this sequel from three years later as part of a long-term 70s science fiction project. It's rather surprising that WESTWORLD got a sequel - these days we're used to thinking of the late Michael Crichton (the director/writer of the original) as a name that guarantees gold but such wasn't always the case and the first film didn't exactly set the box office on fire. Plus it had a rather apocalyptic and cynical ending - the high priced adult amusement park run by the DELOS corporation is effectively destroyed by humanoid robots run amok - not exactly fodder for sequels back at a time when they were a little less common, especially for genre fare like this.

But a sequel was made anyway, and FUTUREWROLD though no really great shakes is better than it could have been. For one thing it substitutes the western backdrop and fear of science themes for something new - corporate conspiracy - and as a result fits more neatly in with 70s paranoid thrillers like THE PARALLAX VIEW than anything else. For another it's got a lot of goofy, fun stuff like robot-boxing and holographic chess (a year before STAR WARS mind you), and for a third it's got terrific character actor Stuart Margolin as the geeky tech guy who leads our intrepid reporter-heroes (Peter Fonda and Blythe Danner) towards the terrifying discovery that the robots of DELOS are not all just playthings.

The reporters, you see, have been invited by the board of DELOS to get a backstage view of the revamped and re-opened theme park, with the ""world of the future"" segment that gives the film its title replacing the abandoned WesternWorld. There are some decent action scenes, a weird fantasy sequence that is notable only as an excuse to have a few moments of Yul Brynner returning as the Gunslinger, and the effects seem a step up from the original; and I for one always like chase sequences set in steam tunnels and big underground piles of machinery, which are pretty much the last third of the film, so I was kept going and could overall recommend this.

The biggest problem for me was Peter Fonda, an actor who has developed somewhat interestingly over the years but who sometimes seems like little more than a dull pretty-boy in his early films - a less-talented Robert Redford perhaps. He just never seems to have enough energy or drive or to believe in what he's doing in this role. Two names kept coming to mind watching this - Dustin Hoffman would have brought more energy and an angry intensity to the role of the crusading reporter - or Clint Eastwood could have provided a physical presence and an equally powerful if quieter intensity. Alas I had to make do with Mr. Fonda; I'm sure either of the other two, or most other star actors in their 30s or 40s that would have done better, would have been too expensive. Oh well. Still worth a look for fans of the paranoid thriller genre or the original film - just don't expect anything beyond a couple of hours of vague amusement.",1253577600,,3047,4.659851301115242

It is a great story, fun to watch. This movie begs for a remake! Part of its appeal is the 'technology' and the novel idea of a futuristic holiday resort. They did not use CGI as extensively as they do today; an example is ""I Robot"", mostly CGI. So it is all real! Accept for the part of replacing humans altogether, it is not so far fetched at all; Disney is famous for its animatronics exhibits. The acting is alright.

This movie takes off after the tragedy at Westworld, where robots went on a killing spree after a technical malfunction.

In Futureworld everything is all new! Human computer operators are replaced by super intelligent, 700-Series robots, so nothing can go wrong this time round. Really???

The replacement of Humans does not end at the operators; it extends far beyond that... Watch it for yourself!!!
This is a must-have for all sci-fi fans

I could not get an English version and ordered the Spanish version of the product with an English soundtrack. The DVD is of good quality - Good colour and good stereo sound. I would have liked subtitles though. I always switch them on when I watch movies (personal choice).

The two of them clash often and frequently during the first half of the movie, but then like HIS GIRL FRIDAY they decide to lie down with the lambs and from then on their chemistry grows by leaps and bounds.  One needs the other's talents, and Fonda and Danner fully inhabit the characters of Tracy (""Socks"") and Chuck.  They go to FUTUREWORLD on an all expense paid business trip to drum up publicity for the 1.5 billion dollar dream vacation resort, which had died a death in the wake of the WESTWORLD debacle.  It seems that world leaders are arriving in droves to escape earthly problems, and Peter Fonda begins to suspect that, just like roach motel, you can Czech in to FUTUREWORLD but you can't Czech out.

Some have said that the production values of FUTUREWORLD betray a poverty of MGM resources.  I think on the contrary it looks more expen$ive than WESTWORLD.  It can't have been cheap to hire Yul Brynner to do that strange dream tango.  Someone told me that they probably only had Brynner's services for one weekend, or else he died in the middle of filming because otherwise, why not give him a bigger part?  It would have been awesome if he had come out at the end, as the gunslinger, to kill all the robots who wanted (spoilers ahead) to replace all the world leaders with Delos-friendly hybrids.

The acting was great all the way through, and the love story between the Stuart Margolin character and his friend, robot Clark (named after Clark Kent, the ""man of steel"") was heartbreaking, worthy of Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhall in BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN.  It's rare to find a good gay love story in the middle of a 1970s sci fi actioner, but here you go, if it had teeth it would bite you.",1137888000,11,2088,4.613513513513514

657765,2,6303471552,"FUTUREWORLD(1976) is the cheesy low-budget rip-off sequel to WESTWORLD(1973), and reminds me of the many low-budget rip-off sequels to PLANET OF THE APES from the same era.

FUTUREWORLD holds up much more poorly to time than WESTWORLD, mainly because it trys to use too many technological gimmicks, which look silly 30 years later.

WESTWORLD was a far higher-quality production, coming from a main studio(this one came from a 2nd rate studio).  WESTWORLD was directed by Michael Chricton, and was much more realistic and ""scary"" than this movie - especially the role of the Yul Brynner character.

Some of the sets are simply awful - I especially loathe the one where the main characters keep coming out from behind a metal grate.  Look at the box structure the metal grate is built into - what is the purpose of it being there? ...and look at the wall behind it - it is a metal rollup door (it was probably kept half rolled up, and the characters probably ducked under the other side to get into the box structure!)... in the context of the movie set, the whole thing makes no sense, and looks absolutely absurd considering how much screentime it gets.

Oh, and other than the weak performance by Peter Fonda and small appearances by Yul Brynner, the movies' cast list looks like the guest star list from all the episodes of that year's THE ROCKFORD FILES TV program... we even have Stuart Margolin (Angel) playing a main part!",1124236800,2,1429,4.741935483870968

When I was a kid I enjoyed Futureworld much more than Westworld, mainly because I liked the coolness of the robots in Futureworld (whereas in Westworld the robots were all too human).  Clark in particular left a favorable impression on me.

I think the story in Futureworld is more enjoyable than Westworld, because it revolves around world domination conspiracies.  Westworld is just silly paranois about robots, whereas Futureworld is about robots being used by humans to evil purposes.  Unfortunately Futureworld is poorly produced as a lot of potentially exciting scenes, like the fighting between the real and fake humans, are never fully developed, leaving the impression that the film was hastily put together.

Still, after 30 years and having been largely forgotten, this film continues to be an enjoyable sci-fi film.",1104969600,22,834,5.28030303030303
657767,2,6303471552,"FUTUREWORLD is really not a bad follow-up to WESTWORLD, but Goodtimes Home Video makes viewing this film a very bad-time. The only thing good about it is seeing Yul Brynner back if this is the only way we can get to see him. He was very good if only for a short segment in this film. Hard to recommend this version at all.",1088640000,3,322,4.126984126984127

If you go into this movie with the right frame of mind you will find it fun and an acceptable 70's sci fi film.
Peter Fonda does a nice turn as the hero, Blythe Danner is stunning if a little annoying as the love interest.
