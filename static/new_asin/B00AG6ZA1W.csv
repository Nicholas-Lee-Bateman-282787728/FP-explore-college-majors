8551310,5,B00AG6ZA1W,"Brilliant Microdermabrasion Dvd for the older client!

The instructor is fantastic in this Dvd. The step by step instructions are so easy to follow and the instruction is detailed and informative. As an skin care specialist I was looking for a microdermabrasion treatement to offer my older clients and this video has really enlightened me. The areas covered in this video include skin analysis, cleansing, toning, sanitization and exfoliaton. Post treatment care is also covered. I recommend this crystal free treatment for older clients and this  dvd covers everything any skin specialist needs to know.",1415232000,,605,5.3578947368421055
