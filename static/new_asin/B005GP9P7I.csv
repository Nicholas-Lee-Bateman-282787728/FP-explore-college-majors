4693133,5,B005GP9P7I,Funny enough that I don't feel like i wasted my cash on it.  Extended material and uncensored make it worth it.,1327622400,,111,4.285714285714286
4693134,5,B005GP9P7I,This was the first TJ Miller stand up I saw and I was laughing non stop!  Warning: Keep glass of water handy.  I had the hiccups within the first 10 min from all that laughing.  Can't wait to get it on mp3 so my coworkers can wonder wtf I'm giggling at hysterically.,1322870400,,266,4.076923076923077
4693135,5,B005GP9P7I,"Guys if you haven't heard of T.J Miller (he starred in cloverfield), you're really missing out.  This is a gem in a recently unfunny comedy world.  It's hard to make me laugh, but his delivery style and joke content are just too funny.  You'll be laughing your ass off for sure.",1322611200,,278,4.411764705882353
8472094,1,B005GP9P7I,"saw this guy on cable tv and a recording of is stand-up routine....why in the world do people think he is funny?  he is not in the least funny, he is childish, moronic and his humor more suggestive of a 15 year old than an adult.  perhaps teens find him funny, but how an adult could be entertained by his really boring performances is beyond me.  compare him to any of the truly great and funny comedians and he does not hold up at all - a drop in the pan to be forgotten in the not too distant future!",1498780800,,503,4.01

8472099,5,B005GP9P7I,"Fan of his acting / voice work (How to Train Your Dragon, anyone?), but TJ Miller REALLY shines when he has a chance to involve the audience in his off-the-wall rants and humorous stories.  He's at times poignant, unpredictable, downright silly, and occasionally let's you see glimpses of how much of a natural he is on stage & how smooth his act really is.  Fantastic DVD!",1405209600,,373,4.636363636363637
8472100,5,B005GP9P7I,I love the stand up. It came in perfect condition. I have watch it so many times since i bought it. It was definitely a great purchase.,1377388800,,135,4.037037037037037
8472101,5,B005GP9P7I,"If you want something damn good to laugh at, this is your guy. I was first introduced to him through listening Marc Maron, and can't get enough of this video!",1369958400,,158,4.3
8472102,5,B005GP9P7I,"I originally saw this when it aired on Comedy Central for the first time and I've had it on my DVR since. Well recently I decided to actually purchase the DVD and I'm so glad I did. Not only do I have the convenience of watching it wherever I desire, but there's so much more material that wasn't shown when it was aired. If you've only seen this on Comedy Central then you've only seen about half of the actual footage.

All technicalities aside T.J. Miller is hilarious! I wasn't sure what to expect when I first watched it back in 2011 but it was a non-stop laugh attack the entire way through. The beautiful thing about T.J.'s act is that he's really different from your average stand-up comedian. This man is really awkward and it makes you wonder how he's even been able to come this far in his life, but his awkwardness makes for some great comedy. At least that's how I felt. I know this special won't be for everyone.

No Real Reason runs at a little over an hour and has T.J. going on about a large variety of things. From wearing a tennis outfit on the corner of his street to his experiences at air ports. Then he goes on to do short jokes and impressions. I mean his act has so much variety that it's hard to get bored. Now there were a handful of jokes that didn't hit as hard as the rest of the line-up, but I could count on one hand how many times that happened. Trust me the laughter is pretty frequent during his act.

When you purchase No Real Reason you're also given some special features on the disc. The main portion consists of three outtakes from the original stand-up. These weren't terrible, but I could see why they didn't include them in with main act. Still, it would have been interesting to see exactly where these fit in with the rest of the jokes. Along with the outtakes you're also given two ""short films"". Now these I didn't care for much. One was about him buying and playing LEGOs while using some weird language (I doubt it was even real) and the other is about him on a stoop talking about when he had sex with a dead dog. Both wind up being pretty forgettable.

Overall Score: 9/10 - If you're looking for a good time then I would definitely recommend you check this out. It may have some weak special features, but the stand-up itself is filled with a lot of laughs. I hope T.J. decides to make another stand-up soon because I can't get enough of No Real Reason.",1357862400,,2405,4.30242825607064
8472103,5,B005GP9P7I,Tj Miller is awesome! Physical comedy and story telling is second to none. Wacky and hilarious! Laughed through the whole thing. He's one of my new favorites.,1339027200,,158,4.888888888888889
