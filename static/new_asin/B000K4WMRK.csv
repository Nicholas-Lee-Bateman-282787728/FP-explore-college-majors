Overall, I think the bar was raised on this second outing and, though it's not perfect, I'll round it up to 5-star status because it comes so close. The character development is great, the new characters are all memorable and entertaining, even with limited screen time, and the familiar faces are a more than welcome sight. If you enjoyed the first twelve episodes, have no fear; this anime continues to deliver big time. I just wish the seasons were longer.

The first two arcs of this season are the height of the entire series so far for me. Rather than focusing on the long-resolved issues between former salaryman Rock and psychotic she-pirate supreme Levi (Revi if you prefer the Japanese pronunciation) or the nature of their work, the focus is squarely on their hometown of Roanapur. The city, if you recall, exists solely as a den for thieves, smugglers, hitmen, and the rest of society's castoffs. That makes it an interesting place to say the least, and that's where the first half of the season is spent.

The first arc features two insane killers; children with a major vampire fixation (I can relate) who are taking out the who's who of crime in Roanpur. With a large bounty on the kid's heads, Levi and her new pal Eda -the gum-chewing, gun-toting nun from season 1- decide to make a play for it and wind up in some serious crossfire.

The second arc has the Lagoon Company being hired to protect a counterfeiter on the run. The job brings Levi, Rock, Eda, and the rest into conflict with a menagerie of bounty hunters, one of which being my favorite season 1 guest star, Shenhua the blademistress. The action scenes here are awesome and the humor is top-notch as Levi and Shenhua trade pleasantries as they try to murder one another. Also of note are a chainsaw-wielding little girl, an overwieght pyromaniac, and a wannabe that reads far too much manga and pays more attention to his appearance than to the task at hand -that being not getting shot by Levi. This is anime at it's most entertaining!

The third and final arc is Black Lagoon's most ambitious and revealing yet, but it's also this season's biggest flaw. It takes up fully half of the episodes; and while it is certainly compelling and packed with first-rate character development, it also leaves Dutch and Benny (both already hurting for screen time this season) behind completely as it sends Rock and Levi to Japan working for Russian mafia queen, Balalaika -not so affectionately referred to by her underworld rivals as ""fry face"", referring to the awful burns on her countenance. Along the way, Rock meets a young girl who is next in line to inherit a yakuza family, a family that Balalaika intends to destroy. What follows is drama and plot of Godfather-like proportions. It's brilliant, exhilerating, heart-rending, and it goes on for too long. Balalaika's character is really examined in this story and let's just say that even Levi looks well-adjusted in comparison. The Hulk's got nothing on this woman when she's mad; you REALLY wouldn't like her when she's angry. The payoff is huge, but when it's all over you just wish for more of the simpler (and funner) 2 and 3 episode arcs or even a standalone or two. The final arc is too deep for it's own good, if that can be a bad thing.

As I said before, ""Black Lagoon: Second Barrage"" raises the bar on a series that I already thoroughly enjoyed. The added depth and emotional content of the epic final arc will be gobbled up by fans of more serious works and the fast-and-furious action and humor of the first half of the season should please anyone and everyone. Here's to hoping for a third barrage that gives us more Dutch and Benny and completes the teasing glimpses we're given into Levi's childhood!",1200528000,2,3891,4.691068814055637
