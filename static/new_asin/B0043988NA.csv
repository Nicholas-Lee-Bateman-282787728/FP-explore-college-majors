4253867,5,B0043988NA,"I have found each Season of the ""Sarah Jane Adventures"" to be a delightful and family-friendly extension of the 'Dr. Who' Universe.  The stories are generally clever enough to engage the adults, yet mild enough (in language, innuendo, and 'monsters') to enthrall yet not terrify younger children.  The (final) appearance of David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor is an added gem for his many fans.
If you're looking for 'pushing-the-viewing-envelope' and shock value, try TORCHWOOD; if you're content with clever writing, family-viewing, and the sort of stories that make the modern WHO series a delight, try SARAH JANE...",1297728000,4,617,5.285714285714286

4253869,5,B0043988NA,"A spin off of Dr. Who that is considered a children's program, but has enough Scifi to keep others interested. It's light and doesn't require much thought, so it's enjoyable to watch without great brain effort.",1296691200,,210,4.861111111111111
4253870,4,B0043988NA,"This Dr. Who spin off is a bit goofy in spots, and likely geared more toward teenagers, but is still good clean fun, with a mixed cast of characters and a lot of gooofy monsters.  Fun for the whole family.",1296604800,2,205,4.125
4253871,4,B0043988NA,"I really enjoyed this season.  The stories have solid plots, there are good brave characters, with many links to the Doctor Who universe to keep you remembering that it is set in a bigger universe than Smith's house and the area of London.  The Judoon show up, the Doctor shows up, and yes, we even get the Mona Lisa.  Well, the painting of her.  I enjoyed the fact that K-9 is now more active, and that he and Mr. Smith don't seem to get along.  All the characters, from Sarah to Rani, had some episodes that seemed to focus on them.  In fact in a few episodes Sarah Jane Smith was kept out of the action, giving the teens more to do.  Which, being this is a kid's show, makes sense.
I also enjoyed the last episode, which many people seem to think of as the weakest link in the chain, mostly BECAUSE of the Slitheen-Blathereen.  It was because they were, in fact, smart enough to use Sarah Jane Smith's own history of behavior against her.  They also had some very nice one liners in that episode.  And it was nice to see a husband and wife couple who could work together.
The season seemed to have the theme that not ALL aliens are monsters.  This made for a much more interesting, and more complex, setting.  Because while even Sarah Jane knows these she still had problems trusting some of the aliens.  For good reason.  Yet it is still a good theme, and lesson, to pass on to the kiddies.
There is a star missing because this DVD set has little in the way of extras.  In some ways, on the other hand, it seems to me one of the most enjoyable of the three seasons so far available.  In other words, it will be a few more seasons before they jump the shark, or the Slitheen, if you get my drift.",1294963200,,1699,4.229813664596273
4253872,4,B0043988NA,"A NORTH AMERICAN FIRST GOES FIRST IN 2011
As of January 4, 2011, BBC Worldwide Americas have released The Sarah Jane Adventures: The Complete Third Season. These six two-part stories have never been broadcast on North American broadcast networks. Each part is 30 minutes, so the stories are 60 minutes each. This is a 2-disc DVD set suggested to retail for $29.98.

The third story, The Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith, is extra notable for guest starring David Tennant as the Doctor, in the last production he recorded as the Doctor (to date).

From Steve Manfred's website:

The Sarah Jane Adventures: The Complete Third Season:
starring Elisabeth Sladen as Sarah Jane Smith, Tommy Knight as Luke Smith, Daniel Anthony as Clyde Langer, Anjli Mohindra as Rani Chandra, Alexander Armstrong as the voice of Mr. Smith, and guest starring John Leeson as the voice of K9, and David Tennant as the Doctor.

On all two discs, you will find:

Graphical menus, episode and scene selection features, and subtitles for the hearing impaired.

On Disc 1:
Story 1: Prisoner of the Judoon  and Story 2: The Mad Woman in the Attic and Story 3: The Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith (guest stars David Tennant)

On Disc 2:
Story 4:  The Eternity Trap  and Story 5: Mona Lisa's Revenge and Story 6: The Gift
Audio Adventures:  A five-minute extract from a Sarah Jane Adventures audio book called ""The  White Wolf,"" read by Elisabeth Sladen.

There are no other special features in this release.
This is a standard-definition DVD release, though it is still in anamorphic widescreen (16:9).
Episodes originally transmitted in the Autumn months of 2009 on the BBC.
These episodes have never aired in North America.",1294185600,12,1685,4.890845070422535
4253873,2,B0043988NA,"My wife and I were looking forward to the special guest appearance(s) of Doctor Who's David Tennant -- not to mention another episode where Sarah Jane squares off with The Trickster. However, there's something seriously wrong with the sound mix -- the music and the sound effects were WAY TOO LOUD and continually drowned out all the dialogue. I tried all manner of adjustments to my television and my stereo system, to no avail. Good episode, terrible mix.",1294099200,10,457,4.871794871794871
4253874,2,B0043988NA,"First, I must state that the Sarah Jane Adventures are all superb and may many more be produced . . .  The concern I have is that with each new release, the number of discs have diminished.  Season one had 4 discs, season two had 3 discs and season three has only 2 discs. It seems that the production company has elected to produce lower quality long playing discs as well as eliminate most of the extras. (I purchased the BBC UK version and my review is based upon the same.  The forthcoming USA version appears to have been produced similarly and potential consumers may wish to evaluate whether or not it will be worth your investment considering that the video has been significantly compressed to fit on only two discs compared to the first series' four and the second series' three discs.)",1289606400,28,796,4.5524475524475525
4253875,5,B0043988NA,"Already brimming with evangelical fervour after stumbling across Season Two, I was not prepared for just how good 'The Sarah Jane Adventures' Season Three would turn out to be.  It starts well.  Very well.

1. Prisoner of the Judoon
An escaped alien prisoner, stranded on Earth, needs to use a technology company's nano-forms to escape (and thus wreak havoc, naturally), a company where Rani's mother Gita just happens to be trying to sell floral displays (with her headmaster husband in tow).  The prisoner's Judoon guard and Sarah's teenage cohorts are in pursuit of the alien.  Sarah Jane herself is otherwise occupied...

A great opener.  Though there are more than a few shudders on the way, as the story progresses the emphasis is most definitely on fun.  The earth-bound setting allows for far better Judoon-obey-the-law jokes than either its Doctor Who forerunner 'Smith and Jones' or its book form counterpart 'Revenge of the Judoon' (and 'Prisoner of the Judoon' is much more entertaining than either of them.  In spite of his authoritarian literalism, or more likely because of it, I ended up feeling rather attached to Judoon Captain Tybo.)  Though the story as a whole is an excellent kids story, it's not free of niggles: in the middle of a tale with so many light touches, the abduction of a little girl is extremely dark in contrast to the rest; the part one cliff-hanger (boy genius stating the obvious to super-intelligent computer) is resolved a little too easily; Elisabeth Sladen is well over the top in her altered state.  Yet, all-in-all, Prisoner of the Judoon is highly entertaining (the Chandras and Tybo especially so) and a great way start to the series.

2. The Mad Woman in the Attic
Ealing, 2059.  Sarah Jane, Luke and Clyde are long gone.  A teenage boy investigates an attic and learns that '""The Mad Woman of Bannerman Road"" is one Rani Chandra, who says she used to protect the Earth from aliens.  Rani has a flashback to 2009 when, aged 15, she received an email from an old friend whom she had once told about her encounters with beings from other worlds...

In its initial stages at least, TMWitA is an exemplary piece of television, with compelling ideas and some startling imagery, and for any regular viewer, the opening few minutes are extremely intriguing.  Yet there are a few flaws as the story unfolds: once we're back in 2009, it feels a little straight-forward; there is the occasional verbal over-exposition of the plot and some really crappy incidental music (though nowhere near as bad as that of its parent show).  But there's also a great deal to keep you hooked.  Anjli Mohindra carries the story really well, the fairground scenes are suitably unnerving and Brian Miller makes a very endearing caretaker.  From a purely Doctor Whoish point of view, there's a great little flashback sequence at the beginning of part two (Jon Pertwee and Tom Baker!).  The ending is rather sentimental (somewhat of an occupational hazard) and drawn-out but with K9 coming back to Earth, pretty much all is forgiven.  All tied up nicely.  Until the twists...  The CGI at the very end disappoints a little but Joseph Lidster's trademark chopped-up narrative and Alice Troughton's excellent direction generally doesn't.

3. The Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith
Sarah Jane sneaks out of her home for ""a meeting at the town hall"" but Luke, Rani and Clyde don't believe her and track her to a restaurant.  Where she is dining with a man.  Sarah Jane finds out that she was followed but still seems happy and announces that the man is Peter Dalton.  Two days later, Peter proposes and Sarah Jane accepts.  The engagement ring he gives her glows an ominous red and when Rani and Clyde investigate Peter's home, they find it has not been occupied for a long, long time...

Most likely the one that has spawned the most column inches, TWoSJS's obvious fan triggers shouldn't hide the fact that it is beautifully set up: the youngsters spying on Sarah Jane's romantic assignations; managing to keep a stray alien secret from the fianc; the faint noises of Tardis materialisation.  The light comedy (""People are eating!"") that makes up most of part one makes it all the more heartbreaking when things goes wrong later.  Nigel Havers and Elizabeth Sladen are really affecting as the ill-fated lovers and David Tennant, at his most Tom-Bakerish, was never better than here.  The villain of the piece should come as no surprise and it's a shame about the periodically syrupy music but, despite the odd contrivance or two, the ending shouldn't leave a dry eye in the house.

4. The Eternity Trap
Ashen Hill Manor is haunted.  In 1665, Lord Marchwood employs the alchemist Erasmus Darkening, thinking he can make gold out of base metals.  Marchwood's two children spy on Erasmus but he spots them and they disappear.  Back in the present, Sarah Jane, Clyde and Rani (with Professor Rivers and her assistant, Toby) go to look for evidence of hauntings...

'The Eternity Trap' is much more than one might expect of the average scary kids show, managing to be a whole lot more edgy than the norm.  There is a definite sense of menace throughout and some of the finest music of the entire run.  The gang (without Luke) investigating a haunted house would be pretty much all there was plot-wise, were it not for some exceptional touches: the message on the mirror, the repeating phonograph voice, the toy room, the people on the staircase, Donald Sumpter's creepy Erasmus.  The absence of Luke, Mr Smith and K9 makes everything seem a lot more grown-up than usual and though the script is at times a little creaky, this is more than offset by great performances from Daniel Anthony, Anjli Mohindra and Adam Gillen as Toby.  For something that could so easily have turned into Scooby Doo, 'The Eternity Trap' is really, really good.

5. The Mona Lisa's Revenge
Clyde enters an art competition and wins first prize, a trip for him and his classmates to see the first showing of Da Vinci's 'Mona Lisa' in Britain.  While the class are at the gallery, the Mona Lisa comes to life, steps out of the painting and replaces herself in the picture with the curator's assistant.  Soon other people become trapped in other paintings: gallery staff, the police, Sarah Jane...

'The Mona Lisa's Revenge' has to be seen to be believed.  Honestly, I can't remember the last time I saw a programme for children that left my lower jaw dragging on the floor quite so much.  Not in a scary way; more like 'What on Earth-..!?'  The first ten minutes or so is pretty standard fare: a bit of mother-teenager angst to kick off with; then Clyde wins the competition (with an actually not-very-good painting) and he and his classmates all troop off to see the Mona Lisa; something happens to said painting.  So far, so what.  But then it shifts up several hundred gears into something truly bizarre.  (""A whole new kind of wrong."")
There are a host of unforgettable visuals, a lot of sparkling dialogue but, most gob-smacking of all, the eponymous anti-heroine herself.  Not since Henry Woolf in 'The Sun Makers' has anyone hit that impossible balance of crazed/dangerous/hilarious as Suranne Jones does here.  Her impassioned ""...to be trapped in here!"" in part two is the quintessential Doctor Who villain played to perfection: threat and victim and cosmic joke all in one.  Unmissable.

6. The Gift
Sarah Jane and her friends chase an overweight boy into a warehouse.  He is revealed as one of two Slitheen attempting to use a matter compressor to squash Earth into a diamond and make themselves rich.  K-9 tries to destroy it so the Slitheen grab Rani and hold her hostage, threatening to kill her.  In the nick of time, two more Slitheen appear, teleport the villains back to their ship for trial and introduce themselves as the Blathereen...

The season finale, an altogether less successful  concoction of light and dark, is a little flat by comparison to the rest but outshining five such exceptional stories was always a tall order.  It kicks off with a chase, into a washing machine storehouse or something, and oh dear, it's a Slitheen.  Doctor Who Season 2005 had many strengths but the Slitheen weren't one of them.  As a one-off satire on the true nature of political authority, fair enough, but more than that?  Anyway, the Blathereen turn up (same as the Slitheen but different - frankly, I don't care).  After saving the day, they offer Sarah Jane some Rackweed, a super-plant with which she can feed the world.  Of course it's part of an evil plan but our heroine dutifully falls for it and spends the rest of the story clearing it up.  Or rather the kids do.  The threat is serious enough but lacking is the wit and sparkle of earlier stories.  One is left with a fairly straight forward scenario, with Sarah Jane, saviour of the world, being fooled all too easily, not once but twice.  (And the comedy ending and moral postscript to the story are pants.)  Not a bad way to wrap things up, just not as good as the rest.

***

One rarely hears anything more than a few, small niggles about 'The Sarah Jane Adventures'.  Perhaps this is lowered expectations, it being for a younger audience and perceived as deserving less critical scrutiny.  Or maybe it's more successful than anyone thought it had any right to be.",1286064000,45,9318,4.787726988102692

Like some of the best Doctor Who episodes, it addresses things that are genuinely scary for kids (losing one's parents, fears of not being liked by one's friends), but we always know Sarah Jane will make it all right in the end. It can seem a little *too* coincidental sometimes that our heroes manage to find aliens around every corner (and always within driving distance of Sarah Jane's house, conveniently), but this is a suspension of disbelief one is happy to make. Great acting all around too. I've always been a special fan of Daniel Anthony (Clyde), who gets most of the funny lines but who still crafts a character of real depth and sensitivity.

Also worth mentioning: how often does any show -- especially a science fiction show -- have a woman over 50 years old as its lead character?  Exactly once in the history of TV as far as I can tell.  Fabulous program!  RIP Lis Sladen.",1462147200,,1013,4.64245810055866

4253941,5,B0043988NA,"Here we have another great season of Sarah Jane Adventures. Season Three continues the exploits of Sarah Jane and her companions as they attempt to save Earth from the dangers of Aliens and psychotic despots.

I enjoyed almost every episode except for Mona Lisa's Revenge. The episode contradicts the Doctor Who episode ""City of Death"" and not only that but it's quite boring. Despite this the majority of the episodes hit the spot for me.

Prisoner of the Judoon was a solid entry into the Sarah Jane canon. I liked its comedic elements and Elisabeth Sladen's portrayal of an alter-ego was absolutely fantastic. She was an incredible actress! The mad Woman In the Attic was great episode also. It's an episode that makes one think how you should always be careful what you ask for because you just might get it. The Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith was maybe the third best episode of that Season. David Tennant's cameo was spot on! He's my favorite Doctor from the new series and seeing him reprise his role was such a joy. The Trickster has grown to become Sarah Jane Smith's arch enemy in this series. I'd always asked myself if the kids had ever met the Doctor and now this proves that they have in fact met him but up to that point he'd only ben alluded to by Sarah Jane Smith. The Gift was a solid episode to round out the third season of the show. Suffice it to say that Sarah Jane Smith is ruthless to anyone who hurts her adopted son.

I decided not to see Seasons Four and the abbreviated Season Five. I'll save them for my next cycle assuming I'm alive in five years' time. This series is great and I want to highly recommend it. Only Mona Lisa's Revenge is a dud but it does not take away from the greatness of this show. Buy it and you won't be disappointed.
