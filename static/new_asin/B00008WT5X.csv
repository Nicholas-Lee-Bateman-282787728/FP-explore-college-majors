7987677,5,B00008WT5X,I have a 2 year old little friend who loves  the book by Hillary Clinton. I bought this DVD for her and now she's in love with ballet. She's really eager to go to her first ballet performance. What a great way to introduce children to ballet.,1503792000,,242,4.148936170212766
7987678,5,B00008WT5X,"This is an amazing DVD.  It's TV from the late fifties to early sixties, so not big on production.  There's very little in the way of sets. But there is Tallchief and she is fascinating to watch.  Her grace and precision make you catch your breath.  As a bonus one of the performances was Rudolph Nureyev's American debut!  Despite the fact that he is not well-matched to Tallchief, who is bigger than him, and he obviously has trouble holding her several times, Nureyev is so good that it doesn't really detract from his performance.  Every movement he makes is magical.  He makes all the other male dancers, very fine dancers, in the DVD look clumsy.  IMHP he makes Baryshnikov look like a linebacker if not a bear.  Several of the dances are choreographed by George Balanchine.  If you love ballet, you will love this.  Younger fans will be interested to see the physical difference in the dancers from most today.  Maria Tallchief was not a teeny-tiny little woman.  And the rough-hewn, craggy Andre' Egelv, who partners her in three of these performances is not your average guy in tights.  BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL DANCE!",1326499200,9,1123,4.78125
