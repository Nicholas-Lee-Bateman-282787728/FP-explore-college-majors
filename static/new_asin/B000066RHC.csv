1713582,1,B000066RHC,"I've been dancing Salsa for more than 2 years and had a look at several videos. This video series is so bad that you think it must be a joke, but after a while you start to realize that these guys are serious about it. Susie dances worse than many beginners I've seen, hopping around like she's doing jive. Marlon is more mumbling than dancing, his method in teaching is not having one. His moves are very basic and some look just ridiculous. Actually I'm speechless. If you're so bad it's a crime to let people pay $ for a DVD... At least my friends and I had a good laugh! If you want to get a fabulous instructional video, from beginner to advanced, get the RedHotSalsa series from Ron and Bethana Rosario! This is Salsa!",1048636800,7,724,4.330882352941177

7962389,5,B000066RHC,Marlon and Susie have great chemistry in this easy-to-follow video. My husband and I love these two and use their videos any time we want to learn a new dance! This one was easy and education. Can't wait for the next level!,1428364800,,223,4.333333333333333
7962390,2,B000066RHC,"This is really Mexican style salsa, which is danced like cumbia.  The instructor does not show the counts (1-2-3, 5-6-7).  This is a continuous play video with no table of content and chapters by pattern number or name.",1424736000,,219,4.7368421052631575

7962392,2,B000066RHC,"I think most of the other reviewers got it right: it's not worth the time. And, too bad too - they do some things right. But, the lack of input from the follower's side, the lack of an immediate demo with music for each point, the never ending talk-talk-talk, etc. just finally sink the entire effort. Don't try this at home. Just leave it alone.",1365033600,,346,4.338461538461538
7962393,4,B000066RHC,A good starter product for those wanting to kill the Salsa Room. I highly recommend it.,1281484800,,87,4.5
7962394,1,B000066RHC,"From the moment you see the akwardly danced opening sequence you know things are about to get ugly.

I watched the first 6 or 7 chapters of the DVD (2 hrs total length) and it was aweful.  They have no style, are not smooth, they lach proper technique, it's cumbia, not salsa, and most of the patterns are a complete joke.

If you're looking to learn salsa this gets a 0 out of 5.  Of the chapters I watched only chapter 5 (I think) might be worth looking at because it's somewhat complicated (don't get me wrong, they still mess it up completely and dance a cumbia step).  It was so bad I no only stopped watching this one, but didn't even open the box of the advanced one I rented with it.  I returned them both promptly.

If you're looking to dance cumbia it may be a 1 or 2 for moves, but the style is still poor and it progresses mind-numbingly slow.

So far the only DVD lessons I've watched are these and Red Hot Salsa and the Red Hot Salsa are much much better, there are also a lot of free onlie lessons on youtube and some salsa sites that are much better.  Don't waste your money on this.  If I watch other DVD series down the road, I'll review them so it may be worth checking out my review list if this is something you're interested in.",1204329600,,1250,4.149377593360996
7962395,2,B000066RHC,"The instructor talks too much beside the point: the instructions should be clearer and more succinct.  While nice, the moves offered are few, and two of the sections deal with merengue.  Although merengue armwork and patterns are frequently converted to salsa, why teach them AS merengue on a salsa DVD?  To fill in space, the DVD simply starts over again with track # 1: the actual time on the DVD devoted to instruction is too short.",1184371200,,435,4.697368421052632
7962396,1,B000066RHC,"These is beastly, useless DVD. Instructors don't count at all and don't dance to music. They dance only cumbia constantly.  They have no style. Don't buy this video, you will not learn salsa. I think to return these DVD.",1147132800,2,220,4.641025641025641
7962397,1,B000066RHC,"Please save your money and do not purchase this DVD. I bought this as my first salsa DVD and was very disappointed, not to mention feeling betrayed. Marlon takes at least twice as long to say something as anyone else would. He often says, ""We're not uh, uh, uh, going to cover this because, uh, uh, we did in our, uh, previous episode."" The other problem is that it is a very odd form of Salsa. He doesn't use the the standard 1-2-3, 5-6-7. He also will do something rediculous like bending over and turning in circles. He will spend at least 10 minutes on this, and then go in the other direction for another 10 minutes.
For a real salsa dvd, check out Juan & Diana, or Al & Edie.",1083801600,7,681,4.206106870229007
