I don't have the fanciest DVD player on the planet, but it works, so I don't think it was the DVD player's fault. However, I did get it to work on my laptop... well all but the last 3 chapters, it just froze and I couldn't get past a certain part. It was a very interesting documentary for the part I saw.  I have been to El Salvador twice and there were many parts that I had seen and experienced and agreed with, but I didn't realize how much violence and how many ""assassinations"" there still are today. I would really like to see the rest of it :(",1295395200,3,714,3.993006993006993
