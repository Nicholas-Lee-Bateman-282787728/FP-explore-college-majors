8039351,3,B00066N9X8,I started taking a padded weapons class and wanted to learn more. This set has good information and follows the Chanbara rules well. It has good foundation information and Dana Abbot is a good teacher. The one problem that this DVD set has is that there is no chapter selection. You have to fast forward to the place you want to start viewing.,1261699200,,343,4.4603174603174605
