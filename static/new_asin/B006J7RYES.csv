8499228,5,B006J7RYES,"Between the killer and hard boiled, it's hard to decide which one is the better film, but they do compliment each other for sure, the killer is more gritty while hard boiled is more fun, and the highlights of both of them are their final shootouts, the church shootout was very edge of your seat and made you feel like everything was on the line since ah Jong and his partner were fighting for their lives, and the hospital shootout was borderline comical since it was so ridiculous (in a good way though). anyway, John woo is one of the many go to directors for hardcore bloody action and an adrenaline rush",1473638400,,608,4.4375
8499229,5,B006J7RYES,"A perfect double feature for any action movie fan.  Both of these movies were directed by the great John Woo( and in my opinion are two of his best movies).  They blend great action sequences with likable characters and drama.  They both look great on Blu-Ray, but unfortunately there really arnt any kind of special features.  But for what it is, these are both great action movies for a great price that show off the best of John Woo's directing abilities.  The shootout sequences in these movies are amazingly well done!  Seriously, they are so well shot and well coriographed that you just have to see them to fully appreciate how great they are.  And there's no bad CGI effects in them either.  Their all practically done with real squibs and explosions, and it looks great.  As for the story of the films, their good as well.  I'm not going to get into the specifics of the story's, but they combine action and drama with good likable characters, making for great entertainment.  The second movie ""Hardboiled"" is in my opinion the best action movie ever made(and I'm not exaggerating).  It starts off kind of slow, but by the end becomes a non-stop shoot-out between a heavily armed gang, and two police officers at a hospital(think Die Hard, but a million times more intense).  The last half of this movie is basically one giant long shootout sequence thats pure entertainment.  Really, this double feature is worth getting just for the movie ""Die Hard"".  The other movie ""The Killer"" is also great as well.  It has a cop and an ex hitman teaming up to fight against a greater evil crime boss.  The action isn't as good as in ""Hardboiled"", but the characters are more developed and complex.  Overall, if you are a fan of action movies, then this is a great double feature to get.  If your reading this and you haven't seen ""Hardboiled"", then I highly recommend at least watching that movie if nothing else.  Trust me, whether your a casual action movie fan or a hardcore one, you will not be disappointed.",1468972800,2,2012,4.645892351274788

Great action, great characters led by John Woo as director, just the combination needed for a greatly entertainment action flick.",1464998400,,296,4.784313725490196

8499234,5,B006J7RYES,"Several years ago, before I expanded my movie viewing tastes to include international flicks, the few foreign movies I HAD watched were all badly dubbed. These would be Bruce Lee, Lucio Fulci, and Dario Argento. Then I found out about John Woo, who has fallen off in recent years. Many know him as the director of Face Off or Mission Impossible II, but to see his best work, you have to pickup two of his earlier Hong Kong offerings, both involving Chow-Yun Fat laying the smack down on Triad scum.

FIRST OFF-Do yourself a favor, and watch both The Killer and Hard Boiled in subtitles with the original Canotonese audio. SECOND-watch them back-to-back. Both movies build off of each other, even if they are not involving the same cast of characters. Many will tell you that The Killer is superior, due to its meatier story and characters you actually care about. I tend to agree. The ONLY problem I have with The Killer (in its original, theatrical version) is the cheesy interludes that loop a terrible Chinese pop song. I am not sure if this was acceptable in 1989, but now, it's badly dated, even by 80's U.S. standards. The first half of the movie is very slow. When the action does pick up, the total overall experience is way bloodier than Hard Boiled. This, in part, being due to the cast's white outfits. Everything from the chaotic camera work, to the slow motion fight scenes, and carefully choreographed exchanges of dialogue (the beer can scene) show John Woo's EXTREME attention to detail.

Three years later, John Woo follows up with 1992's Hard Boiled. Between the two, Hard Boiled is your more standard ""action blockbuster."" The entire movie is one long shootout sequence, with minimal dialogue. A quick bullet to the head is the most popular way bad guys die in films, but John Woo likes to see his protagonists fill their enemies with entire clips. I guess the Chinese Triad can sustain more damage than your average thug. The most memorable antagonist in this movie even possesses Michael Myers-like survival qualities. He gets burned and shot to pieces, but he keeps on coming back for more. The inclusion of an undercover hitman/gang member that creates an origami crane for each of his victims is a nice touch. Unfortunately, Hard Boiled substitutes raw carnage for character development. Otherwise, it could have topped The Killer.

Both movies will introduce you to an influential segment of the Hong Kong action movie scene, collectively known as ""Heroic Bloodshed."" These movies feature characters that struggle with traditional Confucian values while hacking each other up to pieces with non-stop barrages of machine gun fire. The action sequences are very stylized, prompting critics to coin this fighting style as ""Gun-Fu,"" which replaces martial arts with poetic, ballerina-like gun battles. The best example of this being The Matrix. But if you want pure, timeless, bloody-epic hack fests, stick with early Woo-specifically The Killer & Hard Boiled.",1378252800,9,2981,4.969939879759519
