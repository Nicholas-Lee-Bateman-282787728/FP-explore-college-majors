I guess the best thing about it was Carmen Electra.",1140652800,2,184,3.945945945945946
1394447,2,B000055ZG4,"Ok you should already know this movie is cheezy and bad.
It's actually horrible to the point of where it's funny which is why i gave it two stars and not one. However,my biggest problem with this movie is not the bad acting,the horrendous effects or the nonsensical plot. It's the fact that the gorgeous Carmen Electra graces the cover of the dvd/video and gets supposed 'top billing.' Well thats a farce. Carmen is in this movie for like 2 or 3 minutes and thats it. She was obviously put on the cover to try and sell the damn thing which is a trick that ""B"" movie producers and creators pull. Another example is ""Naked souls"" with Pamela Anderson on the cover,but in reality she wasn't in the movie that much and also wasn't naked either. I have that one.
But don't blink during this trash-fest or you will miss Carmen who is probably the reason you wanted to check this out to begin with. If you want to see a very good Carmen flick,look no further than ""Mating habits of the earthbound human."" If you actually don't care about Carmen,this movie has a lot of the original ""Batman"",Adam West, and people you've never heard of.",1132704000,,1128,4.480582524271845
1394448,1,B000055ZG4,"I rented this movie once, Judging from the cover it seemed pretty cool.  My two reasons for this were thusly: 1-Carmen Electra was in it, and she was all gothed up, 2-I like vampire movies.  Well I watched it and was very disapointed.  Carmen Electra is hardly even in the movie at all, and it didn't even really have a plot.  Okay, theoretically it had a plot, but wasn't intresting in the least bit.  As for the special effects, well, sometimes lousy special effects aren't a bad thing, it depnds on how you use them.  But in this case, they failed, miserably.  I swear, a ten year old wrote this movie.  Please don't watch this movie, even it comes on HBO or something don't waste your time.",1051056000,6,694,4.409448818897638
1394449,5,B000055ZG4,"The VHS of this movie does not do it justice, and I feel sympathy for those who have not explored the DVD! As you can see from comments circulating about this movie, it IS bad, but most delightfully so! When I first picked out the movie to watch, I had the intention of reviewing a good, bad B movie (does that make sense?). But this BAD bad B movie turned out to be a GREAT bad B movie!
I popped in the DVD and for some reason I felt compelled to go to the ""special features"" and then to ""audio"" (and this is where the disadvantage of the VHS version kicks in). There, I saw:  - ""Cat Track"" -  ""The hell is a ""cat track???""  Well, it is because of this track that I not only have bought the movie on DVD, but have also strongly recommended it to others! This movie was MADE to be hilariously BAD and you'll agree if you just watch even the first 5 minutes using this track! Think Mystery Sience Theater 3000-UNCENSORED!... and you'll get the drift! I have never watched this movie in its original audio format, nor do I ever plan to as that would drop my IQ 100 pts. (But I might as well have since I laughed so hard at times, my brain could have shot out my nose...)
So in summary: ""Cat Track"" audio + Adam West + BAD Cheesy Vampire Movie = Frickin' Hilarious!",1023235200,8,1262,4.121951219512195
1394450,1,B000055ZG4,"They made this movie with two cents, maybe three. I can't believe this actually made it to a DVD. What for anyway? Is this a home made movie, or what? It's recorded with a digital camera. I can see the pixels in some shots. For gods sake what have you done!!! If you have this movie in your house: Burn it. Please. I beg you.",994550400,,325,4.015384615384615
1394451,1,B000055ZG4,"I purchased this after seeing several positive reviews for a film called American Vampire and after having a friend recommend it. I had been told that it was a great vampire movie.

Either I was lied to, or there are two movies named ""American Vampire"" (I checked IMDB...there aren't). Oddly I can't find any of the reviews now, and the friend claims not to remember any such recommendation.

Anyway, this is a terrible movie..plot makes no sense, acting is terrible, even the Adam West cheese factor can't save it. It's barely even a vampire movie...

Save your money for something good.",985564800,11,588,4.801980198019802
1394452,1,B000055ZG4,"Granted, I did NOT expect this movie to be any good but as a self proclaimed cheesy horror movie expert I certainly expected it to be (unintentionally) funny.  However, other than Adam West's involvement, this movie was completely unremarkable (Adam West was his usual self but I figured there would be a few self refferential jokes like the ones from Drop Dead Gorgeous... there wasn't a single one, even the quite obvious Vampire Bat - Batman connection).
  Of little note is Carmen Electra's ""starring"" role in this.  Despite what the cover box may have you believe, she has maybe 5-10 lines and flubs NONE of them so it's not really worth watching for her either.
Needless to say I'm very pleased that I didn't buy this.",985392000,6,724,4.722222222222222

The only thing that gives this d movie a star rating is Adam West of Batman fame, Trevor Lissauer who later became known in Sabrina the teenage witch, and Carmen Electra who became well known for her time in baywatch, playboy, and other projects.

7931327,4,B000055ZG4,"Such a fun film! Not to be taken too seriously, American Vampire is a fun story that centers around the premiss of what do you do when vampires come to stay?! This film struck me as a John Hughes meets Underworld!! A easy film to sit down and watch at anytime. The cast alone is great ranging from such veteran actors as Adam West to the humble beginnings of Carmen Electra. Overall totally entertaining!",1332720000,,404,4.472972972972973
7931328,2,B000055ZG4,"The DVD case is clearly targeted toward fans of Carmen Electra who is barely even in it.  Buy ""The Mating Habits of the Earthbound Human"" if you want a funny movie she actually stars in.  This movie barely held my interest all.",1261785600,,227,4.380952380952381
7931329,2,B000055ZG4,This one had a chance to be something really good. It isn't though. I had to put it on twice because I fell asleep the first time. I almost fell asleep the second time too. Save your time and money.,1228867200,,198,3.975
7931330,4,B000055ZG4,"This movie should be watched as a comedy. First of all, I purchased this movie at the dollar store. Second, the characters have names such as Nacho, MoonDoggie and the Big Kahuna. Third, the vampires have cheesy lines like ""Your neck looks so...jugular."" Fourth, cheesy and inconsistent props, graphics, scenery, etc. In one scene it is night outside the front door and day outside the back door! This movie is incredible! The only reason I didn't give the movie a five-star rating is because of the dog-exploding-in-the-microwave scene! Don't worry. I didn't give anything away because the dog scene has nothing to do with the plot (if there is one). With that said if you watch the movie as anything other than a comedy you will be VERY disapointed.",1172361600,,751,4.829457364341085
7931331,5,B000055ZG4,"This is absolutlely the most humorous vampire movie you will ever see! It's deliberately campy, but doesn't go overboard! The acting, overall, is surprisingly good! Even Adam West looks great!

I enjoyed the premise of the story where a bunch of beach bum vampires need a place to stay for the summer! Another amusing aspect of this hilarious tale is when the main characters's hormones start to surge because his girlfriend now wants to spend the summer ""with him alone!"" But he can't do so with a bunch of partying vampires hanging around the house! Before this quandry, he just accepted the fact the beach bums were here to stay. Now, with his hormones surging, he gets the courage-up to give those pushy vamps the boot!

If you have a good sense of humor for the ironic, and absurd, you will definitely enjoy this unusual film!",1156032000,2,831,4.684931506849315
7931332,2,B000055ZG4,"Imagine, if you will, a low-budget horror film with a vampire called Moondoggie (which is so much easier to say that Count Eric von Zipper), a vampire-hunter called the Big Kahuna, almost no blood whatsoever, a soundtrack of we-can't-actually-pay-you quality, and barely enough plot to hold 99 minutes of low-quality video together.  By all means, throw Carmen Electra in there, but you're still left with one of the worst vampire films ever made.  For the love of Dracula, there's not even any nudity in this film.  Carmen's hot - there's no doubt about that - but she doesn't exactly get a lot of camera time in this stinker, and you can see plenty more of her in a wide selection of magazine pictorials than you'll ever get to gawk at here (on an even more deflating note, she has a body double in this film - now, I ask you, why on earth would Carmen Electra ever need a body double?).  Who made this film, anyway?  The whole point of making an atrocious horror film is to get some attractive women naked.  I thought everyone knew that.

So here's the story.  For some insane reason, the parents of Frankie (Trevor Lissauer) leave him home alone all summer while they tour Europe, seemingly unaware that a teenager with a best friend named Bogie (Danny Hitt) cannot possibly be trustworthy.  A mere one day later, Frankie finds himself hosting Moondoggie, a stranger he and Bogie met on the beach, his babe-alicious friends Katrina (Debra Xavier) and Sulka (Carmen Electra), and Frankie's disgusting lackey Bruno (Sydney Lassick) in his home.  These increasingly unwelcome guests basically take over the whole house.  Despite the fact that lost pet notices seem to appear outside right after each of Bruno's amazingly bloody meals, trash bags are used to cover all of the windows, weird little knick-knacks like Satanic crosses start popping up, and three coffins suddenly appear in his parent's bedroom, it takes Frankie a while to figure out that he may in fact be suffering from a vampire infestation.  With Bogie incapable of seeing anything wrong with Moondoggie and his hot little vampirettes, Frankie has only one option - to seek the help of Dr. Van Helsingmeister (Adam West), better known as the Big Kahuna, a surfer dude trying to live up to his family name.

Were it not for the presence of Carmen Electra in this film, it would have already fallen into the trash pit of putrid cinema (it was originally released in 1997 as An American Vampire Story).  It's not even bad in a funny way - it's just bad, period.  As long as there are bargain bins, though, there will be guys like me who see Carmen Electra adorning a DVD cover and decide to give the film a chance.  Just be forewarned: the plot is really weak, the acting is below average (including that of Adam West, who is no stranger to thoroughly awful films), the special effects - which are few and far between - are amateurish at best, the filmmakers obviously had a restraining order thrown on logic before shooting began, and the list just goes on.  The only people who should subject themselves to American Vampire are those of us obsessed with watching as many bad horror films as we can get our hands on.",1155859200,3,3182,4.684021543985637
7931333,2,B000055ZG4,"I had high hopes for his film given its genre and cast.  It looked like a fun cheesy horror film.  A stereotypical teen-slasher film with vampires and lots of blood.  Seeing both Carmen Electra and Adam West on the DVD package, I was filled with the hope that perhaps I had stumbled upon an often dreamed of, but elusive to capture treasure: the ""so bad it's good"" film.

But the cheesy horror film genre is deceptively difficult to succeed in.  You'd think it would be easy to create a dumb, silly, but entertaining film.  Yet this one fails where others have failed before.  It's greatest crime is that for the much of the proceedings it is utterly and completely dull.

Every bad teen movie clich is present, from the soft rock ""inspirational"" soundtrack (follow your dreams, kids!) to the coming-of-age theme to the ""is your girlfriend giving it up yet?"" conversation to the moral lesson ending (the moral of the story is apparently not to allow Adam West to do your killing for you).

Getting to the story, the film begins with Frankie's (Trevor Lissauer) obnoxiously rich parents departing for a summer-long vacation, leaving their teenage son behind to take care of the house by himself (something which only parents in silly teen movies do).  Frankie has a big dumb friend named Bogie (Danny Hitt, who presumably changed his name from Danny Hitt-Me-Baby-One-More-Time) who is obviously supposed to be the obligatory Bad Influence.  Bogie encourages Frankie to do all kinds of wild things, such as bringing an entire six-pack of beer to the beach (amusingly, the beer is obviously Heineken, but the filmmakers obscure the logo with black electrical tape).

Once at the beach, the wild pair meet ""Moondoggie"" (Johnny Venokur) who appears right after a bat attacks Bogie which obviously makes Moondoggie the film's main vampire.  Bogie -- not knowing that he's in a vampire movie -- ignores the bat-attack (he brushes it off as an angry fish... flying through the air at his neck) and invites Moondoggie over to Frankie's house.  Moondoggie arrives the next day and moves into the house with a bevy of gothy weirdos (one of whom is Carmen Electra).  At this point, the movie gets stuck in a plotless holding pattern where nothing happens.  The gang of vampires won't leave the house and Bruno the Vampire won't stop eating the neighborhood's pets.  Wash, rinse, repeat.

To give you some idea of the movie's missteps, I'm now going to detail the contribution to the film made by TV's silliest Batman, Adam West.  For any filmmaker looking to create a goofy, silly, cult horror film, landing Adam West is like having the movie gods throw free publicity at you.  Adam West is the King of Camp, and having him in any movie raises it from something that's merely of interest to something that is a must see.

And I have to say the filmmakers got most of this part right.  They hire Adam West.  They give him a pony-tail.  They make him a beach-bumming, vampire-hunting surfer-guy.  They make his character a descendant of van Helsing.  They give him a delightfully silly nickname like ""The Big Kahuna"" (a sick sad part of me would like to believe that West was given this nickname shortly after he was first seen in his Batman tights) .  They make his first line a long, exaggerated: ""Duuuuuude.""

How could they possibly screw this up after getting so much right?

Here's how.  They only put Adam West in two scenes.

Madness!  I honestly don't know what they were thinking.  Adam West is by far the most entertaining thing about this film.  He's a campy treat every time the camera is on him.  So, why on Earth did they give him such a small role?  Every scene that he's not in has a huge Adam West-shaped hole.

As for the other celebrity (although she was unknown at the time), Carmen Electra's role of the vampire named Sulka is fairly small (at least smaller than one would presume given that the DVD cover is a giant closeup of her head encased in vampire makeup which she doesn't actually wear in this movie).  But it says something about the other actors that Electra's performance is the most restrained of this movie.

The filmmakers do make some attempt to stay true to classic vampire lore.  Unfortunately, they're slightly inconsistent.  Take, for example, the fact that vampires cannot be exposed to sunlight.  The film asserts this in later scenes, but forgets about an earlier sequence where Moondoggie stands and rants right in front of a giant window, bathed in direct sunlight with no apparent ill-effects.  There is also some other confusion and I'm not sure if I missed something or the filmmakers were conflating werewolves and vampires.  Moondoggie's name is not the only reference; there are multiple scenes with dogs howling at the moon in the background.  They don't actually state that the vampires are also werewolves, but these moments completely baffled me.

I think the writer was confused at whether he was writing a straight horror film or a parody of bad horror films.  A movie like SCREAM works because it hilariously satirized the conventions of the genre, but still managed to be scary.  AMERICAN VAMPIRE doesn't work because it isn't scary, and for the most part it isn't funny.  The ""jokes"" are awful.  They aren't even worthy of a groan.  It's obvious one-liner followed by obvious one-liner.  (On the other hand, I don't care if Adam West kicking in a door and bellowing, ""Stop that sucking!"" is a Signal From Fred.  It's the best moment of the film.)

Also, there are two pointless musical group cameos.  The first is Dick Dale and his Del-Tones,  a mere three years after PULP FICTION turned on a new generation to their style.  The second is a random ska group called Out Of Order, who didn't function well enough to have much of a career after this movie.  Both bands are reduced to playing on a sad looking beach to a handful of extras.

At least a portion of my initial hope was fulfilled.  At one point Carmen Electra attempts seducing Adam West.  But it's not enough to rescue this film.  The movie is less than a decade old, so Digiview Productions' version has excellent picture and sound quality.  But you won't be buying this for the extreme digital experience.  In fact, you shouldn't be buying this at all.  Stay away, except for you Adam West or Carmel Electra fans -- but only those fans who have the ability to fast-forward to just their scenes.",1149638400,2,6405,4.733273056057866
7931334,2,B000055ZG4,"This movie is about a group of vampires who crash at a guy's house while his parents are away. As their odd behavior becomes an increasing inconvenience, he elicits the help of a professional vampire hunter. Van Helsingmeister, played by Batman's Adam West. If this all seems like a cool, campy idea, I would agree.

The movie drags on slowly during the first 75% of the movie as dogs and cats in the neighborhood disappear, etc. By the time the vampire hunter enters the picture, the movie is beyond saving. The final half hour was a last chance for the movie to start getting good, but, it does not.

Great idea and movie concept, but the script just falls way short in keeping the action advancing and giving some action at the end the audience is waiting for. The acting was pretty bad, but Carmen Electra actually did a credible job as the seductive vampiress. Overall, I give it 2 stars for a good concept, but this one is strictly for the diehard vampire movie fans.",1147046400,3,973,4.5227272727272725
