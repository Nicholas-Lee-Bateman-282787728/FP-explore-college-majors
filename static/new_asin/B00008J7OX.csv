8039065,5,B00008J7OX,This is the best documentary on the Oregon trail I have seen. It is very informative. It is easy to picture yourself as a pioneer on the trail. I recommend it highly.,1244246400,3,166,4.21875
8039066,5,B00008J7OX,"After joining the Howards years ago on one of their mini-wagon train trips, seeing this video was awesome. I have used it for over 10 years myself in teaching manifest destiny. Kids even build mock wagons and we send them on the same adventures as the video. There are few documentaries that middle schoolers can stand, but this one by far is the best! They love it and so do I!",1243296000,2,378,4.338028169014085
8039067,5,B00008J7OX,"I appreciated all the re-enactments. It must have been a job to follow the Oregon Trail the way they did. Nice to be able to just go along for the ride. Music, Narration and Maps all added to the program. I especially liked the diary readings that were sprinkled throughout the Program.
I give this one four stars...  First Rate and a class act.",1082505600,5,345,4.390625
