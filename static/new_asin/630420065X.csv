821027,5,630420065X,"Awesome movie!  One of the best I have seen.  Although it does get alittle old after, like, the 5th time you've seen it, it is still worth getting.",933379200,,147,4.214285714285714
821028,5,630420065X,"When I first heard that Brian dePalma had to direct a movie produced by Tom Cruise, I was a little bit astonished and when it appeared that the project was MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, I really expected the worse. How a  personality like dePalma would cope with those virtual chains ? As always  with dePalma movies, the critics were divided; the scale was zero to ten. I  think that we should see this movie by always having in mind that the  director didn't have the liberty he used to have in his precedent movies.  So, let's search Brian in this blockbuster. Tom Cruise receives, in the  first minutes of the movie, a few red and blue chewing gums whose function  is to help him to open rebellious key-holes. Cruise uses those tablets  twice in MISSION IMPOSSIBLE. To open doors ? Not at all, he uses them to  destroy glasses, mirrors. How curious isn't it ? And you begin to realize  there is very much glass in MISSION IMPOSSIBLE : screens of TV's, PC's,  glasses with incorporated cameras, etc... O.K. Brian, we've understood  you're here, behind the mirror, behind the masks, one of the other  recurrent theme of this movie. Then you can recognize SCARFACE and the hero  of RAISING CAIN in Jim Phelps, a man whose thirst of power reveals a  multiple personality. And there is this wonderful scene when Jim Phelps  tells Cruise what's happened in Kiev unknowing that his agent visualizes  the same scene, with an other point of view of course, during his  explanation. Isn't it a subtile version of the split-screen process, a  dePalma gimmick by essence ? No doubt about it, this movie is one of the  three best american movies of 1996. A DVD which is already a classic.",914112000,,1669,4.631399317406143

821153,5,630420065X,a lot of stunts excellent...,1496707200,,28,4.8
821154,1,630420065X,"Produced and Starring Tom Cruise. Ethan Hunt's humanly impossible stunts and total lack of humanity, make Black Widow comic books look like reality, even when she is fighting Evil in space. Ethan Hunt will probably jump off a burning International Space Station with only a blanket as a shield, then as a parachute, and land on the fuselage of a passing 747 while holding his breath.  He'd make Jason Vorhees look like a wimp.  I'm all for action and suspense ridden plots, but I hate to be taken for a fool. The movie makes no sense and it is a betrayal of the series.  The only other time I ever saw a stupid unconvincing and convoluted ending was in the second Matrix movie. That and this one are two pieces of ka-ka not worth anybody's time.  Watch it for free on tv but waste not a cent on this garbage.",1495843200,,808,4.366666666666666

821156,5,630420065X,"For the time it was filmed vs watching it in 2017 and still finding it fascinating, PLUS the fact that it was free with Amazon Prime, I give it 5 stars.  Not sure if I've never seen the film or if it's just so many years since I've seen it that it was all new to me.  The techie talk was a little dated of course; hard to avoid that.
 I LOVED the tense moments when Cruise is suspended  from his waist about 5 inches away from a pressure sensitive floor, and the speeding train stunts were great also. Very realistic.  If you watch it via streaming, I recommend not reading all the XRAY comments about the goof-ups on the train scene.  It's much more fun to just go with the ride than to know what mistakes they made.",1493596800,,717,4.122302158273381

821158,3,630420065X,"As with a lot of late-1990s American action films the biggest issue is tone. The fun theme song will break in for some exciting heist action, then the the movie will grind to a halt for some half-hearted angsty betrayal-psycho-drama in a variety of drab safe houses. Action choreography is similarly bipolar: the infiltration scene at Langley is arguably one of the top 10 action sequences of all time, while the film ends with the ugliest CGI fight scene I have ever had the misfortune of viewing.",1491350400,,498,4.735632183908046

Their guess at high-tech were fun to see. Some of it was not far off (imagine glasses that could record video and feed your watch with live video - nice call in 1996) - it does show that much of the movie was filmed without a script and then pulled together later (per Wiki) But if you are going to watch the series, you have to start here -",1486339200,,502,4.08080808080808

822244,3,630420065X,"We have much to like in Mission Impossible but the lack of solid characters that we can hang out hats on prevents this progenitor of the long, successful movie series from being great.  In the original TV series, the Mission Impossible Team cleverly sneaks into some bad guy's place of business and absconds with the target item or copies some information.  In and out they go with no one the wiser.  This version rapidly becomes just another fast paced action flick without the crafty, careful, cool  sneaky stuff that we like.  And the characters are so shallow that we have no investment in their survival or their death.
  But the stunts are great.  One of the all time great stunts has a whole aquarium full of fishies cut loose and flood a fancy restaurant. That was fun and memorable.  In another memorable stunt the bad guys fly a helicopter into the train only 'Chunnel', the under sea tunnel between France and Britain.  Other than that, the complex plot has us -and the hero- guessing about who is doing what to who.  Still, it moves very quickly and while we watch we will enjoy the ride.
  Everyone involved from director Brian De Palma (Scarface, The Untouchables, Carlito's Way) to the screen writers David Koepp (Jurassic Park, Spiderman) and Streven Zaillian (Moneyball, Gangs of New York) to the cast have made better movies.  But few have made more profitable movies or movies that have sired such a string of successful sequels.  The $80 million budget film garnered some $458 million in world wide theatrical release and of course more in home view sales and TV.  This less than perfect film pleased the public, which is what counts after all.  We want movies that are fun to watch and this one hits that mark.
  Tom Cruise stars and has the backing of such supporting cast members as Jon Voight, Ving Rhames, Vanessa Redgrave in the plum role in terms of acting and my favorite French actor Jean Reno.
  This 1996 block buster rates only an average three stars while carrying a mild PG-13 rating.  It runs for one hour and 50 minutes.",1471392000,2,2056,4.6685236768802225

822791,3,630420065X,"SPOILERS. This movie is remembered basically for the scene where Tom Cruise is suspended from the wire, trying to copy files without putting out heat, touching the floor, or making noise. The scene is kind of visually iconic, as evidenced by the number of parodies. Beyond that, it's pretty lackluster. First, character is nowhere to be found. Everyone in it is cardboard, with no definable traits. Nothing makes much sense. Why did Ethan Hunt go to all that trouble to STEAL the list of U.S. spies? Why hand it over to the bad guys? To draw out the traitor. But at the time of the handoff on the train, Hunt had already figured out who the bad guy was. Was finding the traitor worth risking the list getting into enemy hands? Max didn't verify the authenticity of the list it in any way. Ethan could just have created a fake list with the computer guy's help. For that matter...why didn't John Voight's wife (who was in on the plot) just TAKE the disc prior to the handoff, give it to her husband, and let him set a private meeting time with Max without Ethan on their tail? And remember that iconic vault scene? When the knife is dropped, the tech guy immediately figures out they've been robbed. How did Ethan's team crawl back through the air ducts and escape when the CIA IMMEDIATELY knew they'd left the vault. The fire alarm would be canceled and hundreds of agents (it was a building at LANGLEY!!) would have locked that building down. Why did John Voight want to leave the train by HELICOPTER? Why not just quietly leave the train? Also, the stunts are pretty silly and improbable. When Hunt blows up the helicopter, the blast BLOWS him back onto the train?? Really? Why did Max hate the goverment? Who was the buyer? Why did the CIA know about the Job 314 clue? Why did just emailing the bible verse to the internet result in a meet? Why did the email read ""Job 3:14"", but the clue that the CIA knew about read ""Job 314,"" which was harder to recognize as the Bible verse? Why did John Voight shoot the wife? He went through all of that plot trusting her...and then shoots her at the end because...why? The movie is mildly diverting, but when you start asking ANY questions, it sort of falls apart.

The story, gadgets and the Brian De Palma touch impart upon the story a sense of playfulness and foreboding, especially in the early parts. There's definitely a sense that the characters are whistling in the dark. On the other hand, as dark as things do get at times, there is an inherent brightness and levity to the movie that never lets it (or the protagonists or the viewer) fall too far. For all the danger and betrayal in the story, there's also loyalty and trust. Highly recommended.",1461542400,,600,4.564814814814815

It's fun to watch Tom Cruise try to rehabilitate himself after being disavowed and the opening scenes where he loses his team remain gripping.

826416,3,630420065X,"Many will be surprised that I am reviewing this film, especially twenty years after it was released, but it was Directed by the legendary, Brian De Palma, making it a must see for me. In general, I find these huge franchise films to be fun, some are better than others, but that's usually based on the writing and the cast. In watching the first of the Mission: Impossible films, my expectations were very high, and while Tom Cruise didn't disappoint, Brian De Palma certainly did. The king of mystery could have developed a better story than this. The action sequences were impressive and the special effects were way over the top, but I still felt the story could have been developed a lot more. Maybe being the first film in an eventual franchise, producers wanted to give the series as much action and explosions as possible. If that was the case, they should have called Michael Bay, this film has all the makings of one of his films, not a De Palma film. That being said, the bottom line is that first mission is exactly what you'd expect it to be. Student replacing teacher, in a film that's one chase and fire fight after another. It was entertaining, but not something that requires a whole lot of thinking.",1453507200,,1216,4.58256880733945

With number '5' due for release on the 15th December i felt it was time to re-trace the journey of this exciting action
movie-series starring 'Tom Cruise' ......this the first of the Five......
The opening mission goes belly-up the team directed by 'Jim Phelps' (Jon Voight) and led by 'Ethan Hunt' (Tom Cruise)
are seemingly drawn into a trap and are ambushed, they had been trying to prevent 'agent identification' falling into
the wrong hands....now, other than 'Nathan Hunt' and it seems 'Claire' (Emmanuelle Beart) the team are all dead.
'Nathan' quickly realizes his team had been betrayed by a insider, but who ? ....as things stand he is prime suspect, and
is being sought by the agency.
He is now on a mission to clear his name and find the 'mole' however the agency do not play by the rules, 'Nathan's'
Mother and Uncle are arrested on a trumped-up-charge which is well publicist to force him to surface and give himself up,
hoping his Mother will understand he has to continue his quest to uncover the truth, though there are few he can trust to
help.........he will find that everything had not been as it had seemed following the earlier mission.
The film also stars 'Vanessa Redgrave' as 'Max' and 'Ving Rhames' as 'Luther Stickell'
A great beginning to what has become a stunning series in terms of action, suspense and indeed stunts, many of which 'Tom
Cruise' does himself (quite something almost 20 years on from this the first in the series)
Well worth scanning back through the early films ahead of the 'Blu-ray/ DVD release of the 5th)

826914,4,630420065X,"Still my vote for the best movie of the 5. I get the feeling that movies 4 and 5 (Ghost Protocol and Rogue Nation) are more in the true spirit of the Mission Impossible franchise, but I still prefer the first feature film to the rest. It's hard to follow, so I find that I enjoy watching it many times; it's moderately humorous; it's constantly thrilling and original; and has the right balance of plot twists to keep you guessing without making you feel like you're being abused.

I would highly recommend this movie if you're okay with not being treated like and idiot. It expects you to catch up with the plot rather than slowly, tediously spelling everything out for you (which, granted, some Friday nights I do enjoy being treated like and idiot). I thoroughly enjoy the cast, and I truly appreciate the stakes: it's so refreshing to watch a movie where the bad guys aren't going to BLOW UP THE ENTIRE WORLD. They're just going to screw over the CIA.

826915,3,630420065X,"The movie content was as expected, but the Amazon service quality was very poor. The video had to buffer several times and I was asked if I wanted to switch to the SD versions, which is unacceptable when I paid for the HD version. The problem was not with my ISP or with my network (as Amazon implied in an email about this issue) as I was able to stream video from many different websites to other devices/televisions without any service degradation. Therefore, the problem was with the Amazon server or the Amazon network. In the future, Amazon should reject any request to stream a movie if they do not have sufficient bandwidth to support all previously accepted streaming requests and the new request! They should also increase capacity to handle peak time streaming.

Amazon automatically credited me (without me complaining to them) with the entire purchase a few days later (and is why I am not giving this just 1 star), which was a marginally resolution to this issue. However, with a paid Prime service, I expect better quality. I am okay with an error message stating that the facilities cannot support the streaming service at the moment before we begin watching the movie stream.",1440720000,,1192,4.786407766990291

827018,5,630420065X,"Is there a place for time proven methods and principles in today's society?  This is a message that is part of the subtext of Mission: Impossible.  The film deals with a changing world and how people cannot always change with the world around them.  Sometimes the decisions that have to be made lead people to new careers while some people are able to adapt to the changing world within their lives.

 Over time Mission: Impossible has held up to be a successful example of a film adaption of a television series.  Though the production of this film was troubled in finding it's direction and focus.  Once Brian De Palma was brought on as director, he was able to alleviate these issues.  The production team was able to take a concept and vague character profiles from the television series from the 1960s and translate into an engaging espionage thriller.

 The story follows an American espionage agent (Tom Cruise) who is framed after his team is killed during a mission.  He has to unravel the plot against him and prove his innocence without the support of his government.  The film also features Jon Voight, Vanessa Redgrave, Ving Rhames, Jean Reno, Kirsten Scott Thomas and Emilio Estevez.  The film's plot is in constant motion.  It does not stagnate for long and the film does not stop telling the story to hold the viewer's hand to keep up with the plot twists.

 This film was the first time that Tom Cruise displayed his action star potential.  It not only solidified him as an A-list actor but also someone who could be the forerunner for a franchise.  He had to display a different range of acting, as at the time a movie such as this was unexplored territory for him; as well as learn to develop physical abilities for his roles which has continued to the present day..  While the direction of the franchise has been doubted throughout it's course this installment set it on it's path.",1440374400,,1901,4.671686746987952

827147,1,630420065X,"My cousin kept badgering me to watch this, so I thought what the heck, how bad can it be? It was AWFUL. I could've written a better script in 4th grade. Even for a movie called Mission: Impossible, it was so improbable, it made me want to throw an exploding stick of gum at the idiots who wrote the script. This movie's plot had more holes than Swiss cheese- so many, in fact, that there may as well be no plot because about 99.9% of it is either irrelevant of makes no sense.

SPOILERS

So, Tom Cruise's average character- an arrogant borderline-narcissistic hotshot- is sent on a completely unnecessary mission by his boss, Jim (who I look at and say HE'S EVIL. Spoiler Alert: He is.) on which everyone on his team dies except for him and Claire (who I immediately point at and say SHE'S EVIL. Spoiler Alert: She is.) Oh, and one of the idiots on his team SEES a dead body stuck on a fence, see the murderer, AND WALKS UP RIGHT NEXT TO THE FENCE!!!! UGH!! So, to clear his name (cliche, much?) he goes off to find the real Job.... blah, blah, we're half-way through the movie already, do something significant! And he goes to break into the Pentagon for some stupid reason, and of course he doesn't get caught because it's Tom Cruise and the movie is called Mission: Impossible. So, whatever. The movie then goes to a flashback- Jim's faked death isn't possible because there's no way he could hold the gun at an angle like that to ""shoot himself"". It also shows that Ethan finds a Bible from the hotel Jim stayed at, which a) is really, incredibly stupid for a SPY, and b) why would Jim need to steal a Bible?! He has the Internet and a huge selection of Bibles without evidence against him for sale. He completes his task and goes to find Job, who is Jim (duh?) and he finds himself hanging on the outside of a train for 25 minutes. Now, for anyone who's ever seen Mythbusters, they did a show on hanging onto the front of a moving car- which is much easier than a moving train. And judging by that, there is no way Ethan Hunt could hang onto a train for 25 minutes, especially while fighting. Science prevails, script writers. Then, after he explodes a helicopter (which somehow can fly without accident in a train tunnel) the explosion doesn't leave any injury at all, despite the fact that he was (at that time) leaping away from the helicopter. The shock wave would've killed him, or if not that, the debris. So, he lands on the train and the helicopter blades, of course, stop an inch from his throat. Did any thought go into this script after the first draft?! So, after wasting around 2 hours of my life watching this pathetic excuse for a movie, I told my cousin that this is right up there with Need for Speed, 2012, and The Naked Gun on the list of the worst movies I've ever had the misfortune of seeing. Impossible is definitely the right word to describe this movie.",1436918400,,2883,4.397003745318352

The actors do a pretty good job, but the action and stunts are the star of the show.  When his team is killed agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) must find the mole in the agency and retrieve the NOC (Non-Official Cover) list.  While the movie has some similarities to the television series it is something completely different.  When Paramount asked director Reza Badiyi (who had director more Mission Impossible shows than anyone) to be present on the set for consulting and advising, movie director Brian De Palma went over and told him the movie would be nothing like the tv show and that it would be uncomfortable to have him around he left and never returned.  Peter Graves turned down the role of Jim Phelps who had been the central figure in the tv show because of the way the character was handled.  Greg Morris also walked on the movie for the same reason.  Just look at the movie as a movie that just has the same name as a tv show and you will have a interested way to pass a few hours.

827497,4,630420065X,"Quick story recap: Ethan Hunt, by Tom Cruise, is framed and outed as a spy. He must recover a secret list and find who framed him to regain his life.

Acting wise, Tom Cruise excels in these roles. Jon Voight was good as Jim Phelps.

As a movie, it's a pretty good action movie but don't expect the best movie out there.  There is even an iconic cinematic scene in there when he is dropping from the ceiling, action films don't always strive to be memorable so it was appreciated that it was.  The movie has a good mystery to it too, trying to figure out who was behind the whole thing.  I liked it and will watch it again.",1419292800,,623,4.158333333333333

827571,3,630420065X,"Tom Cruise needed a movie franchise and Mission:Impossible was it. However,the new franchise does not feature an IMF team that work together unlike in the old TV series back in the 1960's but a spy group that will feature Ethan Hunt - the character of Tom Cruise - as the primary agent. The first movie of the franchise started by eradicating the familiar Jim Phelps character that everyone was familiar with and to transfer the responsibility to the group to Hunt. To be honest, I found having Phelps being the mole as somewhat a disrespect to the fans of the familiar TV show. But in spite of what happened,I still found the it fun and functional especially if one is looking for  an action film flick since it does not really require deep thinking as far as the story is concerned.

827867,3,630420065X,"I am not a big Tom Cruise fan but for some reason I got the hankering to watch the Mission Impossible movies this past weekend. I'd never seen any of them, so I started at the very beginning. This wasn't bad. From the reviews I was expecting it to be undecipherable but it wasn't at all. It was perhaps a bit convoluted but nothing that didn't make sense by the time the end of the movie rolled around.

Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt, a spy who's been framed, is actually pretty entertaining. He's got a bit of attitude, he's pretty darn smart, and he's crafty. Lord help me but I liked him. After his whole team is killed and he's marked for death, Ethan Hunt has to find out how to clear his name as well as find out what went wrong during the op. There are some things in the movie that I'd seen done before but that was because there have been a bunch of spy movies since MI popped onto the scene. I had the kind of cool feeling that I was watching one of the movies that set the tone for a lot of later spy flicks.

There are a couple of people who help Ethan on his mission and my favorite was the character played by Ving Rhames. I loved him! Also, he and Tom Cruise play off of each other really well. That was awesome.

What wasn't so awesome? That I figured out who the bad guys were pretty much right from the beginning. Luckily, that didn't diminish how much fun I had watching this movie. I was in the mood for an action film and Mission Impossible really delivered.",1389744000,,1474,4.146853146853147

It's a great spy movie, with imaginative scenes and stunts, and a fair amount of action. But what disturbs me, and has for some time now, is that Hollywood is always messing about with the legends and can't leave well enough alone. In this movie, the character Jim Phelps - for decades the ""brains"" behind the IMF - is made out to be the bad guy. You see similar treatments in other movies where the legends are changed from what we grew up with. For example, the newest Star Trek is replete with changes that alter the traditional timeline and kill off characters that weren't in the original series or movies. I guess my issue is with Hollywood, and not specifically this movie - this movie is just an example of Hollywood's attempt to corrupt us into thinking that there cannot be any distinctive Right or Wrongs in the World, just huge overlapping gray areas where Good Guys maybe aren't really Good, but Uncommitted. I awarded three stars for production value and the movie's overall slick presentation.

Sure am hoping that the Bruce Geller ""team"" did not write off on that aspect of the script/film rights. And yes, sure he COULD have done that but he never did in the TV series so why do this just to create the Ethan Hunt character as the lead? Why not just have him get killed in the first movie and have Hunt fill his shoes.

The movies never take on the same character of the TV series and frankly I wish that they had just put out an action thriller using a different name. NOT true to the original concept. The only thing similar is that Ethan gets to hear the mission via some clever recording as per the TV show. Big deal. That is where it all ends.

As an action thriller movie the series is decent. Acting, however, is too camp. When will our USA studios stop using worn out script formats that are rah rah, lets all high five and yell out after something goes right. It's really getting old, folks.",1360195200,,1061,4.221674876847291

828489,4,630420065X,"Mission: Impossible is a 1996 action spy-thriller directed by Brian De Palma, starring Tom Cruise, Jon Voight, Kristen Scott Thomas, Ving Rhames, and Jean Reno.

Beginning in the first half-hour, where half the cast is killed (Don't worry, that wasn't a spoiler), Mission: Impossible makes it clear it will NOT be your typical spy-thriller!

The improbable and thrilling action sequences and clever gadgets (the infamous latex masks!) are brought to life by Brian de Palma and Tom Cruise in probably the most realistic (Whaa? Mission Impossible realistic?) Ethan Hunt outing yet.

Cruise plays the role he plays best: the (young) cocky action-hero, and plays it well, and the supporting cast steals the scenes (Look out for Vanessa Redgrave, Jean Reno, and Ving Rhames)!

Mission: Impossible has everything you want from an action film: action (obviously), adventure, explosions, mystery, one-liners, a great cast (an added bonus, actually), humor, and big-budget set pieces!

Unlike too many action films, MI has a solid script, a smart plot that fits together like a well-made puzzle, gorgeous location photography, dry humor, not a dull moment, and even some top-drawer acting in Jon Voight and a scrumptious (the only word I can think of that quite captures it) turn by Vanessa Redgrave. The two show-stopping action set pieces still thrill 14 years after the release date. MI makes a terrific movie night. The only reason I docked a half-star is I figured out the plot twist early on. My family liked it so much we watched it twice in two nights, and picked up more clever plot details during the second viewing.

The plot is a bit too twisty-turny for its own good, with perhaps ninety percent of the cast switching allegiances at least once before it's through, but that's kind of its thing and I can write off a few eccentricities in the name of identity. Jean Reno and Ving Rhames are wasted as generic lackeys, though, and the vital makeup effects aren't nearly as good as I had remembered. The magic of watching a guy rip off a faceful of fake skin is sort of lost when I can immediately identify who's wearing it as soon as they step on-screen.

828555,4,630420065X,"I saw M:I in the theaters back when it came out.  A sense of humor really sets it apart from the usual crowd of action movies.  In particular, the scene at Langley, involving a true 'poison pen,' is fantastic.  Ving Rhames, Jean Reno, Emmanuelle Beart, Vanessa Redgrave, and Jon Voight actually get some character development.  And Tom Cruise just has this twinkle in his eye the whole time--you know he's enjoying himself.  He straddles the line between cockiness and arrogance perfectly.  By comparison, MI:2 and MI:3 have paper-thin characters, recycled plotlines, and very little humor.  Cruise is dark and edgy there, with none of the first M:I's ""Ha Ha--I pulled one over on you.""  It's clear the sequels' writers weren't nearly as talented.  I haven't seen MI:Ghost Protocol yet, so I can't comment there--hopefully it's humorous and there's some character development.

As for the reviewers who feel this movie doesn't do justice to the TV series--you might be right. I grew up after the TV series went off the air, so I don't have that lurking in the back of my mind as a constant source of comparison.  FYI, I didn't think the Harry Potter films or the Lord of the Rings trilogy captured the spirit of the books, so I'm not unsympathetic to your plight.

The only 2 unaccounted agents would be Jim and Claire. The CIA would have had a team trying to recover the missing bodies and another team trying to find the missing agents. The CIA would not have implicated Ethan that quickly without Jim and Claire's dead bodies on a morgue slab. The CIA doesn't work that way.  When the big scene came as to who the traitor was it became extremely anti-climatic. Turning Phelps into a post-cold war murderer and villian is paying disgusting disrespect to fans of the vintage tv show!!! The film also needed another huge action set-piece. The scene where Ethan had the black hood removed was building to a huge clinical gun battle and when nothing happened something was badly missing. There should have been a shoot-out at that point leading into a hi-tech, hi-octane car chase sequence!! Still I'll give this film 4 stars because of De Palma's masterful visual planning.",1314748800,,1266,4.780821917808219
828592,5,630420065X,"My mission here, dare I accept it, is to explain the very simple plot of this film (way TOO many people have declared and/or criticized the plot being too convoluted) because a LOT of people (for God knows what reason) just didn't understand it. Yes, believe it or not, but a lot of critics (professional and on here) have cited the VERY simple plot of this film TOO complicated and/or convoluted. I have even heard it referred to as ""Mission Plot: Impenetrable"". So many critics wanted to declare the plot of this film incomprehensible. I just watched some old clips from ""Siskel & Ebert At The Movies"" a couple of months ago, and I saw their review of this, and honestly I was torn between laughter and terror. Laughter at how ignoramous they sounded saying that the plot was so complicated and convoluted and hard to follow; and terrified for the very same reasons, because I sensed that it was as if they were trying to use power of suggestion on people, convincing them ahead of time that they will not understand this film. (Trust me, critics get paid to do such things!) I had NO problem understanding the brilliant plot of this film! Matter of fact, that was one of the main reasons I loved it so much (other than De Palma's awesome style and techniques). This is worthwhile, intelligent entertainment, though not for the cerebrally challenged. No offense!

Like ""The Untouchables"" (another film from a classic tv show that De Palma made for Paramount), producers Tom Cruise and Paula Wagner hired Brian De Palma to direct this espionage/action/summer popcorn fest for Paramount, and once he did, it became a 'Brian De Palma film', filled with lots of psychological profiles, deceptive characters, and a whole host of other mind blowing craftmanship that only he can deliver. Working from a script by Robert Townshend (""Chinatown"") and David Koep (who worked with De Palma on ""Carlito's Way"" and ""Snake Eyes""), De Palma delivered a tour-de-force of psychological/action/espionage that is just as mind blowing today as it was when it was released to great acclaim 15 years ago. Yes, still a classic, if not more so, after all these years!

De Palma's trademark touches are throughout the entire film, swirling camera work, altered camera angles, split screen, split dioptor, et al. I haven't seen a film in this genre of such magnitude in a long time! And, even though Cruise was a producer of the film, he and De Palma butted heads over budget (Cruise was concerned about going over, and De Palma said ""F**k it, who cares!""), and it's obvious Paramount knew who to listen to about that matter (plus, we ALL know what an egotistical/arrogant/ignorant a**hole Cruise is anyways), letting De Palma make the film HIS and not Cruise's. De Palma paces it in such a way that every climatic scene just builds and builds until he (literally) blows you out of your seat at the end.

The film opens with a typical De Palma 'bait and switch' scene (where you see one thing, but it turns out to be something entirely different than what you expected it to be), where we are introduced to the first team of spy agents, led by Ethan Hunt (who we all know by now was played by Tom Cruise). They return to base headquarters, and their boss Mr. Phelps (Jon Voight in a superb performance) returns from vacation and sends them on a new mission on a mole hunt to recover a stolen NOC list, a list of spies' names that matches another disc with their code names, and this list of names CANNOT get out in the open. Emilio Estevez turns in a wonderful uncredited performance as Jack, one of the team members (he did it just for the opportunity to work with De Palma) who is first to meet with a sinister fate when this mission goes horribly/horrifyingly wrong. The rest of the team is killed, Mr. Phelps is shot, so Ethan is the lone survivor, making him the lead suspect as the mole. He is then disavowed as an agent.

Enter Kittridge (Henry Czerny), the head of the whole operation, who is now on the trail of Ethan with (almost) a vengeance, so Ethan goes into hiding. That's when Ethan discovers the trail of 'JOB' and Max, and proceeds by internet to meet with Max (the awesome Vanessa Redgrave in one of her best roles ever). Claire (Emmanuelle Beart), one of the previous team members -and Mr. Phelps' wife (and thought dead)- finds Ethan and lets him know that she is alive after all, leading Ethan to be suspicious of her, even as they rebuild a new team of spies (Jean Reno and Ving Rhames -who worked with De Palma in ""Casualties Of War"") from a list of other disavowed agents.

Then, out of the blue Mr. Phelps returns in a pivotal scene that De Palma plays for all it's worth, with Jim (Phelps) telling Ethan his version of the failed mission, him getting shot, and how he survived, all the while Ethan is having flashbacks of how it REALLY happened (very reminiscent of Hitchcock's classics ""Stagefright"" which opened with a 'false flashback', and ""I Confess"", which featured pivotal flashbacks that revealed more than what was being told), letting the viewer in on who REALLY set up Ethan's team for the assassination.

Ethan and team break into Langley in one of the most memorable exhilerating/breathtaking scenes in cinema history to steal the real NOC list so it can be delivered to Max in return for Job. This leads to one of the most awesome set pieces in espionage/action movie history, setting the most climatic scene of all on a train moving at high speed. Ethan saves the NOC list from getting into the open, exposes Job for who he really is, and he and his team are re-avowed back into the spy business. See, simple plot!

De Palma employs a very old technique: Tell a simple story in a very complicated way, something that Hitchcock, Kubrick, Antonioni, Bergman, Fellini, Lynch, and any other great director does to make a great film. And, this is a GREAT film! Forget the sequels (if they could be called such) even exist, for this is the ONLY 'Mission' that exists other than the tv show it is based on. This film has such a cool psychological angle as well as one of espionage. ""Mission: Impossible"" puts a solid stamp into this genre in my opinion.

Oh yeah, a final twist: ""How about a cinema of Aruba, Mr. Hunt???"". Now this message is gonna self destruct...

828593,2,630420065X,"By and large, the movie fails because it strays too far from the premise of the TV show and ventures into 007 and Bourne territory.

828594,5,630420065X,"Forget that the sequels squandered true plot elements for generic action sequences (delightful as they may have been).  Forget that the reinvention of classic TV spy shows in modern cinema has been worked to death over the past decade.  Forget that Tom Cruise has flown off the deep end and cannot resurrect even a marginal amount of his preexisting talent to save his latest Box Office bombs.

Forget all of that because De Palma's 1996 underrated gem of a thriller is a borderline masterpiece.

I want to lament for a moment at the tendency some viewers have of writing off this film or complaining that it doesn't make sense or makes them `think too hard'.  Maybe the frivolous complaints caused the producers to reconstruct the sequels to be more `simple minded' than this in-depth original.  I don't mean that to be rude or accusatory, and I understand that everyone has personal taste, but I ask you this: what were you expecting to see?  I mean, honestly, what do you want from your movies?  Do you want brainless plotting masked over by illustrious action sequences?  Do you want to switch off your brain and indulge your senses?  Why not indulge all of your senses, whilst not forsaking you capacity to think?  I had this issue with the countless individuals who criticized Christopher Nolan's `Inception'.  I mean, if you walk into the film with the foreknowledge that you HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION then you shouldn't be struggling to understand the plot twists.  They will make sense if you've actually been watching the film from start to finish.

I'm done now.

Regardless of what others may think, I personally consider this one of the best films of the 90's.  It capitalized on the popular leading man, using his special breed of `charismatic awareness' to create a signature role for the star.  Brian De Palma owns this film though, with rich directorial choices that bathe this film in an ominous mood, one that pays homage to the inspiration while bringing it into the modern world, giving us plenty of reasons to sit in salivation over the film's tone and texture.  The action sequences are spectacular, yet they are not overdone (as they are in the sequel).  They feel appropriate for the context of the film, which is much more of an intellectual and psychological thriller than the expected (by many) action thriller.

`Mission: Impossible' will make you lose your breath, and then it will help you catch it.  It is a complex yet tightly woven mystery that basks in the glory of its star and star making director.

828595,5,630420065X,"By the mid 1990's Tom Cruise became the biggest box office star of his time. In 1996 he starred in the theatrical revival of the 1960's and early 1970's CBS TV series ""Mission:Impossible"" playing good-looking Ethan Hunt, an undercover spy working for the CIA. Many ardent ""Mission:Impossible"" TV show fans regard the filmed versions as stand alone stories as the only similarity between the series and films are the title and jazzy theme music. In the first outing Ethan is accused of killing his team of co-horts and it's entirely up to him to find the culprit who framed him.

 ""Mission:Impossible"" was produced on an amazing $80,000,000 budget and it shows: the movie was filmed in many areas around the world including England and France and the action sequences are some of the biggest ever produced. The film eventually grossed over $450,000,000 and would go on to spawn four more sequels as of 2011.",1296691200,2,906,4.876623376623376

A thrill-ride from start to finish, with Tom Cruise well-cast as Ethan, the key player on the MI team (aside from Jon Voight).  The cast is quite strong, and I only wish Reno had more lines (he's a great actor).  No, there is very little logic and you have to suspend disbelief most of the time, but if you're willing to accept everything on the screen as plausible (including the ridiculous finale on the train/helicopter), you're really in for a treat.

My only major complaint is the female lead (Beart) -- she is the only case of miscasting here.  Yes, she's extremely attractive and an experienced actor, but her perpetual pout and vulnerability take away from the toughness and grit that the character 'should' have.  But I digress...

Regarding other DVD features, not much to speak of -- depending on the version you buy.  The special collector's edition contains some additional scenes and shorts, but nothing to really warrant a higher price.

The team which then took over was pretty ingenious but had none of the technology which was to be invented by the mid-nineties. With the help of these devices available when the film was made,  DePalma directed a tricky production in which the interrelationships among people are as important as those among hardware. The result is interesting. Jon Voight has the heft to play the senior team director while Tom Cruise seems a bit lightweight to be the team leader ( though he emotes adequately). Other members of the cast meet their specifications as good guys (of either sex) or villains sufficiently well to meet  the limited demands put upon them.
All in all, a good theatrical conversion of a television show more limited in time to rehearse and time to fill with action. Motivated me to get the two sequels which I have not yet seen.",1259020800,,1115,4.707692307692308

828708,4,630420065X,"""This mission will self destruct in five seconds"". That is a classic line in movie history that everyone should know. Mission Impossible is based on the popular TV series that spawned 7 seasons. This motion picture adaptation is a wonderful treat indeed, it includes espionage, action, suspense you name it this movie hits the nail on the spot. The only thing about the movie that..well isn't bad but troublesome is the plot which is quite confusing but then again that is what makes the film shine; so yeah if I where you I would give the movie a couple of multiple viewings in order to comprehend the film's plot.

The movie's plot surrounds Tom Cruise' character of Ethan Hunt, IMF agent (Impossible Mission Force) Who looses his team of spies in a mission gone bad. It seems that there is a list known as the NOC list, which contains the names of all the agents working for the agency, if stolen or obtained by the wrong source it could jeopardize every agent in the force. So without ruining the movie it's all about Treason and it requires a lot of thinking and observation... In a way the viewer must behave as a spy in order to understand it and notice the tiniest important detail. So as I said it may require second viewing, in my case I had to watch it 4 times in order to understand it completely.

The only thing that I found a bit silly is the last action sequence in the train; it feels out of place as if the movie out of nowhere changed genre from espionage to action. Also the film is kind of dated but it won't ruin the movie's plot which is phenomenal. Last thing make sure that when you buy it that it is the special collectors edition. I say this because of experience; the standard version is presented in a letterboxed format. Which means that if played on a plasma HD screen it will look horendous, due to the fact that it is not enhaced for 16:9 screens. If you have a regular 4:3 screens then I guess it's okay to buy the cheaper standard one, the special edition doesn't include many special features anyway.  So yeah great movie, a bit confusing but phenomenal. Definitely a must have.

828710,4,630420065X,"Shot in Prague before it became synonymous with cheap labor and tax breaks for runaway productions, the initial signs were less than promising for Mission: Impossible - rumors of clashes between Cruise and Brian De Palma, the latter pointedly keeping a very low public profile when the film opened, last-minute heavy re-editing and the dropping of Alan Silvestri's original score (not, it has to be said, anywhere near as effective as Danny Elfman's replacement) - yet the result is a lot more fun than it has any real right to be. There's little relation to the original series aside from the title, Lalo Schifrin's theme music and an ill-done by Jim Phelps, here played by Jon Voight rather than Peter Graves - indeed, the original cast turned down offers of cameos in a film which kills off almost the entire Impossible Mission Force in the first twenty minutes so the star can hog the spotlight. But then, in those days Tom Cruise still sold more tickets than anyone else and the film raked it in - as they say in gangster movies, it's nothing personal, just business.

Although it was apparently Emmanuelle Beart's role that bore the brunt of the pre-release cuts, Cruise is in more danger of being overshadowed by co-stars Ving Rhames and Jean Reno, neither of whom get as many close-ups but make up for it with much more unforced charisma and screen presence. The plot doesn't always make sense - there's really no reason to break into the CIA's headquarters in Langley to steal a real list of undercover agents' names to use as bait other than allowing the director to stage a Topkapi-inspired high-wire heist - but it just about serves to fill in the gaps between setpieces, including a neat sequence that's pure De Palma where one character's explanation of events is accompanied by visuals gradually piecing together what really happened and a doozey of an action sequence involving a helicopter in the Channel Tunnel that caused the Bond producers to drop their original storyboarded-but-unshot Channel Tunnel pre-title sequence from the script of GoldenEye as well as boasting a neat line in spectacularly breaking windows.

No classic but an above-average Summer movie that holds up surprisingly well. Although an improvement over the bare-bones original DVD release, there's a distinct feeling that the reverential special features on the new special edition are there merely to reassure Cruise and his fans that he is indeed the most special and wonderful person in the world.",1203033600,,2492,4.95933014354067

Tom Cruise really carries this film, he's very spot on and engaging in this. Its a great role for him. All in all, a real solid film.",1202688000,,467,4.318181818181818
828712,4,630420065X,"The Mission: Impossible television series was very much over my head when I was a kid. I wasn't even born yet when the first run (1966-73) ended, and I was 13 when the revival (1988-1990) began. Nevertheless, I knew the format and liked the teamwork concept enough that I was somewhat disappointed in the focus on just one agent, Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt, in the film series, especially when thinking about how much cooler things would have been if the whole of the movies expanded on the teamwork shown in the opening scene of the first movie.

Having said that, the first movie is still a blast to watch if you can get past the somewhat convoluted storyline and the whole ""Tom Cruise and his merry men"" feel. With all the high-tech gadgetry and the explosive action sequences, it feels a lot more ""James Bond"" than ""Jim Phelps"" which in the end probably was the reason why the film and its sequels were such a hit with action-addicted moviegoers of modern times.

In any case, this is a review of the HD-DVD edition of the movie, so I should probably say something about the quality of said edition. The movie looks pretty good considering the print is from the mid-90s. There's a good amount of detail to be seen in most scenes of the movie but the color tone looks a bit warm (i.e. flesh looks like there's a bit too much red hue). It's not a reference disc by any means but the picture is quite good in general.

I'm not a big audio person so I can't really say much about that aspect of the movie.

Overall, the movie is not a bad one to have in your high-definition library, especially if you enjoyed the film or are just a fan of Tom Cruise in general. It fits the ""popcorn summer blockbuster"" bill perfectly and is enjoyable for anyone but the most picky viewer.",1198627200,3,1770,4.420245398773006
828753,4,630420065X,"Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his team go to Prague in an effort to stop someone from selling a list of all the American covert agents stationed in Eastern Europe.  Unfortunately, the mission turns into an ambush with virtually the entire team getting killed.  The brass figures that Hunt is a traitor who set up his team, so Ethan goes on the run to try and clear his name.

The plot of this movie is somewhat convoluted, though perhaps that is reasonable for a film about espionage and counter-espionage.  Things move along pretty quickly for the and there are no major lulls in the action.  The characters have at least a little depth to them, but this is not a drama built on deep characterization either.  The action sequences mostly work well and the highlight comes halfway through the movie when Ethan and crew break into CIA headquarters in what is easily the most memorable part of the film.  Unfortunately, the big climax at the end involves a train scene that is so unbelievable (even by action movie standards) that it can only be described as laughable.

The other flaw in this movie only counts if you have seen the original TV show or believe that the film should respect the source material in any way.  By turning one of the original characters into a traitor, the producers betrayed everything that character ever stood for.  The only thing the traitor had in common with the original is the name, so the film could have used the exact same script with a different character name to honor the old show but that wouldn't have had the same shock value.  It's a shame that they chose to spit on the show even as they traded on the name recognition to get people into the movie theaters.

If this film is judged on its own merits, setting aside the television series, it's a pretty good action movie.  The ending was a farce, but the movie was solid up to that point with some scenes achieving true excellence.

828754,5,630420065X,"Like ""The Untouchables"" (another film from a classic tv show that DePalma made for Paramount), producers Tom Cruise and Paula Wagner hired Brian DePalma to direct this espionage/action/summer popcorn fest for Paramount, and once he did, it became a 'Brian DePalma film', filled with lots of psychological profiles, deceptive characters, and a whole host of other mind blowing craftmanship that only he can deliver. Working from a script by Robert Townshend (""Chinatown"") and David Koep (who worked with DePalma on ""Carlito's Way"" and ""Snake Eyes""), DePalma delivered a tour-de-force of psychological/action/espionage that is just as mind blowing today as it was when it was released to great acclaim 11 years ago. Yes, still a classic, if not more so, after all these years! His trademark touches are throughout the entire film, swirling camera work, altered camera angles, slpit screen, split dioptor, et al. I haven't seen a film in this genre of such magnitutde since Hitchcock's ""Topaz""! And, even though Cruise was a producer of the film, he and DePalma butted heads over budget (Cruise was concerned about going over, and DePalma said ""F**k it, who cares!""), and it's obvious Paramount knew who to listen to about that matter (plus, we ALL know what an egotistical/arrogant/ignorant a**hole Cruise is anyways), letting DePalma make the film HIS and not Cruise's.
My mission here, dare I accept it, is to explain the very simple plot of this film (way TOO many people have declared and/or criticized the plot being too convuloted) because a LOT of people (for God knows what reason) just didn't understand it. No offense!
The film opens with a typical DePalma 'bait and switch' scene (where you see one thing, but it turns out to be something entirely different than what you expected it to be), where we are introduced to the first team of spy agents, led by Ethan Hunt (who we all know by now was played by Tom Cruise). They return to base headquarters, and their boss Mr. Phelps (Jon Voight in a superb performance) returns from vacation and sends them on a new mission on a mole hunt to recover a stolen NOC list, a list of spies' names that matches another disc with their code names, and this list of names CANNOT get out in the open. Emilio Estevez turns in a wonderful uncredited performance as Jack, one of the team members (he did it just for the opportunity to work with DePalma) who is first to meet with a sinister fate when this mission goes horribly/horrorfyingly wrong. The rest of the team is killed, Mr. Phelps is shot, so Ethan is the lone survivor, making him the lead suspect as the mole. He is then disavowed as an agent.
Enter Kittridge (Henry Czerny), the head of the whole operation, who is now on the trail of Ethan with (almost) a vengeance, so Ethan goes into hiding. That's when Ethan discovers the trail of 'JOB' and Max, and proceeds by internet to meet with Max (the awesome Vanessa Redgrave in one of her best roles ever). Claire (Emmanuelle Beart), one of the previous team members, and Mr. Phelps' wife (and thought dead) finds Ethan and lets him know that she is alive after all, leading Ethan to be suspicious of her, even as they rebuild a new team of spies (Jean Reno and Ving Rhames, who worked with DePalma in ""Casualties Of War"") from a list of other disavowed agents.
Then, out of the blue Mr. Phelps returns in a pivotal scene that DePalma plays for all it's worth, with Jim (Phelps) telling Ethan his version of the failed mission, him getting shot, and how he survived, all the while Ethan is having flashbacks of how it REALLY happened (very reminiscent of Hitchcock's classics ""Stagefright"" which opened with a 'false flashback', and ""I Confess"", which featured pivotal flashbacks that revealed more than what was being told), letting the viewer in on who REALLY set up Ethan's team for the assasination.
Ethan and team break into Langley in one of the most memorable exhilerating/breathtaking scenes in cinema history to steal the real NOC list so it can be delivered to Max in return for Job. This leads to one of the most awesome set pieces in espionage/action movie history, setting the most climatic scene of all (the film is full of them!) on a train moving at high speed. Ethan saves the NOC list from getting into the open, exposes Job for who he really is, and he and his team are re-avowed back into the spy business. See, simple plot!
DePalma employs a very old technique: Tell a simple story in a very complicated way, something that Hitchcock, Kubrick, Antonioni, Bergman, Fellini, Lynch, and any other great director does to make a great film. And, this is a GREAT film! Forget the sequels (if they could be called such) even exist, for this is the ONLY 'Mission' that exists other than the tv show it is based on. Oh yeah, a final twist:
""How about a cinema of Aruba, Mr. Hunt???"".

828759,3,630420065X,"I first saw Mission: Impossible when I was 15 and I didn't have a god-damned clue what the hell was going on. And I considered myself to be smarter than the average bear. In retrospect, it's not that muddled. In comparison to the very-dumbed down sequel it stands out as a better example of film-making made by a director who doesn't underestimate the audience.

Brian De Palma is known to be a wildly inconsistent filmmaker. From the over-rated Carrie, to the under-rated Snake Eyes, the classic Untouchables and the downright hideous Mission to Mars and Scarface, he's been through just about everything. But Mission: Impossible was his first true mega-hit. Movies from TV shows are a dime a dozen these days and are rarely taken seriously, I mean look at trash like S.W.A.T. or Dukes of Hazard, but M:I is actually supposed to be a continuation of the show, rather than a spin-off.

Tom Cruise is Ethan Hunt (no, not cockney rhyming slang) an IMF agent who's entire team is killed in a phony sting operation in Prague. Accused of being a traitor he legs it before they can nab him and assembles a team of rogue operatives to find out who the REAL traitor is. Many double-crosses and double-double crosses ensue.

For those who cannot follow the plot there are some really good set-pieces with enough tension and excitement to carry the whole movie. You'll know by now the dangling scene in the top-secret room but the best scene in the movie is the high-speed train rocketing through the English countryside. While other directors might use this as a chance to show off, De Palma keeps it as realistic as possible which makes it infinitely more cooler.

Parts of the movie may seem a bit dated now and it's weird seeing Tom Cruise look like a little boy even though he was already 33. He even sounds different. And what kind of supervillian uses floppy discs? They could have tried something a bit more high-tech there.

The M:I franchise could be a helluva lot better, I suppose. The second film was terrible and the third merely average. The only thing M:I is really notable for is that it's the point where Tom Cruise evolved from simple movie star to super-megalomaniacle, control freak, religious lunatic nut.

At least it got off to a good start. But can the world tolerate Cruise long enough to ever get a fourth made?

The HD-DVD features a 2.4:1 1080p picture that's pretty good for the most part but the film was just shot too soft in many scenes and there's not enough clarity to it for it to really be a demo disc. The DD+ sound design is simply alright, nothing to write home about. Extras are pretty good, if you're into all that.",1179014400,9,2647,4.6191489361702125

828914,1,630420065X,"Mission:Impossible, the TV series, told the adventures of the Impossible Missions Force -- an elite team of covert operatives who were sent to overthrow mob kingpins, foreign dictators, terrorists and others who threatened the security of the United States. Rather than engage in James Bond-like shoot outs, the IMF team worked together to covertly neutralize threats, leaving little or no trace of their involvement. Although the IMF had a leader (Steven Hill as Dan Briggs and Peter Graves as Jim Phelps), there was no star of the group -- just a bunch of individuals working together to achieve its objective. A truly groundbreaking show.

Along comes Brain De Palma's catastrophe of a remake, starring that couch-jumping Scientologist Tom Cruise. Within half an hour of the film starting, the entire IMF team, save for Cruise, is killed off, Jim Phelps (Jon Voight) is exposed as a double agent and basically the entire concept of the original Mission:Impossible is shot to hell. Granted, Ving Rhames and Jean Reno are present as Cruise's new team, but Mission:Impossible is quickly bastardized as yet another Tom Cruise vehicle where he preens and postures. Making a film called Mission:Impossible into a star vehicle goes against the spirit of the original TV series. It's obscene what Tom Cruise's ego has done to Bruce Geller's original concept. This is just another action film with Mr. Cruise flashing his toothy smile and saving the world all by himself.

828916,4,630420065X,"Brian De Palma's Mission: Impossible is definitely the most plot- and character-driven M:I movie that there has been so far and probably ever will be.  Considering that this was back before Tom Cruise was publicly insane, his performance in this film is actually very good, as are most of the other actors.  Jon Voight is good, if maybe only adequate, as Jim Phelps, and Henry Czerny has a great supporting role as Kittridge, the agent who is heading up the mole hunt.

Even though this is, at heart, a big-budget, summer blockbuster, Brian De Palma definitely puts his stamp on the film.  His stylistic sense of directing and story-telling makes the film much better than it potentially would have been if an average filmmaker had been chosen to helm.  In fact, De Palma even ""tones it down"" with his tendency to overemphasize technical wizardry.  About the only trademark we get is a few, spaced out double focus/split screen shots that, as always, work well.  There are no long takes, or no 10 to 20 minute scenes without dialogue.  No over-the-top sex or violence.  But yet somehow, De Palma still puts his stamp on the film.  His Hitchcockian method of storytelling fits this type of film perfectly.  With all the twists near the end, De Palma flashbacks fit in perfectly to help explain everything to the viewer.  And, as always, the music in the film is done perfectly.  The score by Danny Elfman fits in completely with De Palma's handiwork behind the camera.

Mission: Impossible was quite a departure for Brian De Palma when he signed on to direct it, but he ended up making a great spy film that still stands up a decade later.",1157068800,6,1638,4.701754385964913

- IMF Director, Eugene Kittridge informs former team pointman Ethan Hunt he's no angel in ""Mission: Impossible""

Based on the popular 60's series, Brian DePalma directs & Tom Cruise stars in the big screen adaption that is ""Mission: Impossible"".

The mission starts out with Jim Phelps (who else), & his IMF team, accepting a mission to trail & stop a traitor, Alexander Golitsyn, for stealing & selling classified material. The pointman on the mission is Ethan Hunt, With Phelps' wife Claire, Hannah Williams, Jack Harmon, & Sarah Davies rounding out the team.

Things go to hell when Jack is ""accidently"" killed in an access elevator, Golitsyn is mysteriously killed & Phelps is stabbed to death enroute to the safe house. Hunt tries to stay in contact with the other members of his team only to hear them meet their demise one by one.

With Hunt the only team member left alive, he calls for back up only to have IMF Director Kittridge brand him a traitor & is promptly under arrest.

After narrowly escaping incarceration, Ethan, now a disavowed agent on the run, has to piece together who set him up & try to clear his name.

What's worse, whoever set Hunt up has a meeting with a big time smuggler named Max who is interested in the IMF NOC list, the item that Golitsyn stole. This list has every name and personal I.D. of all agents operating in foreign countries. Smelling a double-cross Ethan has a meeting with Max & posing as the seller informs her that he can get his hands on the real NOC list. Ethan hopes that these turn of events will bring the real IMF traitor out into the open, clearing him of all charges.

828961,4,630420065X,"Brian De Palma's MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE is nearly summarized by a line from Emmanuelle Beart's character.  ""Ethan,"" she says, ""you're not making much sense.""  How right she is.  The plot of MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE is a jumbled mess, thanks in part to director De Palma's bizarre yet artistic style.

What's clear is this: Tom Cruise plays Ethan Hunt, a member of the IMF (Impossible Mission Force).  The IMF is a top-secret division of the CIA which handles difficult undercover missions.  Hunt and his teammates, led by Jim Phelps (Jon Voight), are on a routine assignment when things go horribly wrong.  Phelps' team is ambushed and the team members are murdered, with the exception of Hunt.  But wait, it gets worse: Hunt is framed for the murders and is now being pursued by the IMF's other operatives.  It's up to Hunt to prove his innocence and find the real murderer(s), while evading his former agency.

The cast and crew is full of talent.  We have director De Palma, who's famous for his thrilling, artistic films, which include CARRIE, DRESSED TO KILL, BLOW OUT, SCARFACE, and THE UNTOUCHABLES.  De Palma is really the driving force behind the movie.  He gives it a dark, shady atmosphere, taking the film to bizarre new levels with his intriguing camera work, which include tilted close-ups and the occasional point-of-view shot.  Tom Cruise is great as Ethan Hunt, making us sympathize with this resourceful, clever young man.  Henry Czerny gives a good performance as the head of the IMF.  Jean Reno is typically good, but he's not given much to work with.  Ving Rhames is very likable as computer expert Luther Stickell.

Danny Elfman, always one to write memorable, original scores, delivers another fine soundtrack.  He puts Lalo Schifrin's unforgettable theme song to very good use.  At times, Elfman's score resembles the music of classic 60's spy shows - one of which was, of course, the original MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE.  The screenplay, by David Koepp and Robert Towne, bears little (if any) resemblance to the series on which its based.  Perhaps because of this, over the years the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE film series has come to stand on its own from the TV series.  The Koepp/Towne script is very good considering that, at its heart, this film IS an action movie.  Their script is based on a story by Koepp and Steven Zaillian (who also wrote such films as SCHINDLER'S LIST, GANGS OF NEW YORK, and CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER).

As I've said, the film is a bit muddled.  I wasn't quite clear on what was happening until about halfway through the film.  This didn't really detract from my enjoyment of the film, however; De Palma's directing and Cruise's acting pulled me through.  The film is especially fun during the thrilling ending, which includes some great special effects by ILM (STAR WARS creator George Lucas' effects company).

Though it has little in common with the show on which its based, Brian De Palma's adaptation of MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE is a fun, well-made thriller that is guaranteed to please action movie fans.  I can't, however, make the same guarantee for the casual moviegoer.",1147132800,3,3106,4.917307692307692
828962,4,630420065X,"Mission Impossible is the type of movie that can entertain you even if it doesn't make much sense. It bugs me that they made it a total ""look at me I'm Tom Cruise"" movie though. I mean the tv series was about agents working together and the movies turnt Jim who was the main guy in the series into a bad guy. With the whole team getting wiped out like not even 20 minutes into the movie. Hell I'm not even sure if there was an Ethan Hunt in the original series.

  In the beginning it's nice seeing Emilio Estevez getting a part as one of the team members. He's entertaining and then he gets crushed on top of an elivator. Even the talented Kristin Scott Thomas is killed off in the beginning. With Ethan's team dieing he becomes the prime suspect and has to clear his name. I think that works and this isn't a bad movie even if it doesn't make sense. Still though Tom Cruise is such a pure ego actor. He produces the movie so of course the whole movie has to be his.

  He has them hack up the original show story and center everything around just one character....that he just happens to play. I always liked the 2nd film too but that's even more of a ""look at me I'm Tom Cruise film"". Look at Tom on a motorcycle with cool sunglases on, look at Tom do spin kicks, look at Tom think he's James Bond as he chases a hot girl in her car, look at Tom climb a mountain"", well you get the point lol. I'm looking forward to the 3rd film but I still wonder what the movies would be like if they were more about teams working together and not just one super agent that likes to show off his teeth every 30 seconds with big stupid grins.

  What I do like about this original film is Danny Elfman's excellent score which is faithful to the series. Brian De Palma's direction since he trys to be faithful to the series by making us think instead of just throwing mindless action at us like John Woo does in the sequel. I also absolutely love the train scene at the end, probably mostly due to Danny Elfman's score. It's also a fun action scene. De Palma gives us a confusing story that leads to one fun and wild action scene. John Woo's sequel is just a goofy and sorta fun mindless stunt show of a film and that's why I like that one. This film is the complete oppostite, it has  a brain and it's brain is way too big for human life to understand. It was probably written by an advanced life form.",1146268800,2,2389,4.151515151515151
828963,4,630420065X,"Brian De Palma is always an interesting director to follow, alternating between his personal pet projects (""Dressed To Kill, ""Blow Out"", ""Femme Fatale"", etc.) and gun-for-hire jobs (""The Untouchables"", ""Mission Impossible"", the upcoming ""The Black Dahlia"", etc.).  What's great about him is that he displays equal enthusiasm for both types of movies, always making sure he delivers a polished job with a handful of sit-up-and-take-notice sequences no matter the film in question.  Remember the scene on the steps inside the train station in ""The Untouchables""?

With ""Mission Impossible"", we get a complex but well told story with at least three bravura sequences: the ultimately disastrous embassy infiltration at the beginning, the infiltration of CIA headquarters, and the intrigue and impressive action sequence on the train at the end.  In addition, between those bits we get some great tension-laced character scenes involving confrontations and our heroes trying to figure things out.  As pointed out by one of the Amazon in-house reviews, there's indeed some sophisticated story telling going on here: I, too, loved how Ethan Hunt was saying one thing aloud to a dubious associate as Ethan pieces together what went wrong at the embassy, but in the flashback scenes seen over his voice we see what he really believes happened.  Great stuff.

""Mission Impossible"", originally released in 1996, is also interesting in that you can see old ways giving way to new, both in the story and in the making of the movie.  Story-wise, a few cell phones are seen, but there's still the need for characters to seek out a good old-fashioned pay phone here and there.  In the making of the movie, CGI was clearly used in places (and capably), but model work, matte paintings, and other traditional effects techniques were still very much carrying the day.  These story and film-making elements therefore give ""Mission Impossible"" a simultaneous modern and retro feel that's unique and kind of fun.

I've read some criticism that this new 10th anniversary re-release of the film doesn't feature a new remastered DVD print but the same mastering job Paramount has used on all previous DVDs of this movie.  That may be the case, but I have to say that my newly-purchased DVD features a clean, sharp print with vibrant colors.  Maybe the movie doesn't need to be remastered yet.

Alas, there's no director's commentary here, but otherwise the DVD's special features section is loaded with interesting stuff.

The action scenes are sporadic but generally well done, with the exception of some obviously physics-defying liberties in the special effects for the final chase scene.  Overall, though, the effect is modestly credible and, more importantly, immensely entertaining.  Yes, I've seen better work from Tom Cruise, but so what.  This is a decent movie that's worth the investment of a few bucks and a couple hours.",1137024000,2,1131,4.884816753926701
828966,4,630420065X,"""Mission: Impossible"" takes the basic premise from the TV series, the theme music and the character of Jim Phelps and reinvents them for this enjoyable action movie. This review was originally written for the first edition of the DVD. First an update--the earlier DVD looked decent but the new DVD is a marked improvement. We get a sharp looking anamorphic transfer with bold colors. Some digital flaws occasionally show up but they're not all that big a deal. The previous edition had no real extras to speak but here we get some decent ones. ""40 Years of Creating the Impossible"" basically is a promo for Tom Cruise's films not for the series per se. Most of the extra featurettes are short but entertaining and interesting. Most important you get a movie ticket to see ""MI3"" if you choose to acccept that mission. Overall this edition is a marked improvement over the previous version of the film

Phelps (Jon Voight)puts together a team including Ethan Hunt (Cruise), Phelps wife Claire (Emmanuelle Beart), Sarah Davies (Kristin Scott Thomas)and Jack Harmon (Emilio Estevez)to catch a diplomat stealing the identities of US Undercover agents. When the sting goes horribly wrong, Ethan and Claire appear to be the only survivors of the operation. Eugene Kittridge (Henry Czerny who has playing bueracrats down to a fine art)an IMF supervisor believes that Ethan betrayed both his team and the IMF acting as a mole selling information about the organization.

Ethan and Clarie are on the run but not before Ethan hatches a plan to prove his innocence and find out who murdered his teammates; he uses IMF's database to track down two disavowed (basically agents that have been busted for one reason or another whether they were caught doing something illegal by IMF or by another government)agents Luther Strikell (Ving Rhames) a computer expert and tough guy Franz Krieger (Jean Reno)to tap into the IMF mainframe and steal information that will help Ethan trap the real mole and prove his innocence.

A taunt thriller well directed by Brian DePalma (""Sisters"", ""Obesession"", ""Carrie"", ""The Untouchables"", ""Carlito's way"")and co-written by David Koepp (""Jurassic Park"", ""Spider-Man"", ""Panic Room"" and ""War of the Worlds""), Robert Towne (""Chinatown"", ""Personal Best"")based on a story by Koepp and Steve Zailian (""Schindler's List"", ""Clear and Present Danger"" and ""The Falcon and The Snowman""), the film isn't an extension of the TV show so much as a reinvention. DePalma's film has a number of stunning set pieces including the break-in into the CIA's computer complex. Although the film's plot is convoluted, the twists and turns will keep viewers on the edge of their seat.

The supporting cast including Scott-Thomas, Estevez and Voight all deliever. Rhames who returned in the sequel (and will be in ""Mission: Impossible 3"")gives a rich nicely detailed performance as well. Vanessa Redgrave (!)shows up as an arms smuggler in a nice extended cameo.",1136505600,2,2953,5.133056133056133
828967,3,630420065X,"I've never been able to understand the storyline to this movie, there are way too many twists & turns, but I don't even try to understand it anymore. It's still highly enjoyable, even if the storyline goes straight over my head. Mind you, most stuff does.

I love this film, mainly cos it's Tom Cruise while he was still with Nicole Kidman (and now with Katie Holmes?!), and before he became more known for his 'love' of Scientology than anything else. He's a bit of a hunk in this one too. He's more in the press these days spouting stuff about Scientology, and jumping for joy about having to marry Katie Holmes. (He's probably going to have to teach her everything!)

But back to the film. There's also a great cast of actors in this, including Tom, Kristin Scott-Thomas, Emilio Estevez (I only just realised who he was, he looks strange for some reason), Jon Voight, Emmanuelle Bart (doesn't she have gorgeous hair?), Jean Reno, Ving Rhames and Vanessa Redgrave. Emilio was cast in the role of Jack Harmon to create a sense of shock in the audience when he died early in the film. The film makers felt that casting a well-known actor in the role would increase the impact of Jack Harmon's death. And what a death it was! I still have to look away, despite having watched this many times (including when I had it on video *gulp*)

There's lots of amazing scenes in this, the most amazing of all is the scene where Tom drops from the ceiling and hovers inches above the ground, his head kept hitting the floor until he got the idea to put coins in his shoes for balance.

I love the little ""are they, aren't they?"" subplot between Tom's character Ethan & Emmanuelle's character. Do not covet thy neighbour's wife. But there's definitely a few scenes which were probably cut, leading to much more of a relationship between them, rather than what was left in the film, with stolen glances and that's about it! It never goes much further than a chaste kiss.

There's not much else I can say about this film. It starts straight away, rather than stopping first at the menu page. Will there ever be a special edition do you think? I hope so at some point. Knowing my luck since I just bought it, one will get announced.

I don't remember the second Mission Impossible being as memorable as this one, but I've seen this one many times, whereas I only watched Mission Impossible II once.",1127952000,6,2382,4.527906976744186
828968,2,630420065X,"The only great thing about Mission Impossible (1996) directed by Brian De Palma and staring Tom Cruise and John Voight is the updating of the theme song. The new theme song was great. It's true the film had a lot of plot holes, but that's only one thing that bothered me when I saw it on the big screen. The plot was completely loused up. The beginning was the worst. Never have I seen a movie where the entire original team of anything is killed off two minutes into the movie. The entire IMF team is killed two minutes into the movie leaving pretty boy Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) as the only survivor. Ethan Hunt is the disguise expert of the force. This is the second thing that bothers me. Wasn't Paris played by Leonard Nimoy aka Spok always the one with the clever disguises on the team? I hate when movie makers take hold of an already good idea and twist and mold it into nothing, like creating new characters. They did it with Charlie's Angels (2000). What happened to Jill, Sabrina and Kelly? Sure one of the original characters makes a cameo in the sequel. Remember the motto: If it aint broke, don't fix it. This is completely ignored every time a studio makes a big budget production based on a classic TV series in my opinion (The Mod Squad). Now the nitty gritty of why I was disappointed with this film. What the film makers did to Jim Phelps (John Voight) is villainess and a crime! Jim Phelps is the leader right?! I have no idea what David Koepp, Steven Zaillian, and Robert Towne were thinking when they wrote this. This movie is all about Cruise, Cruise, and Cruise who co-produced. A better title would be Tom Cruise and the Mission. I love Brain De Palma's work especially The Untouchables and Phantom of the Paradise. However, he really jumped the gun. The supporting cast played their parts well and I give De Palma credit for trying.",1124323200,4,1856,4.477876106194691
828969,5,630420065X,"...and I've seen a lot of them.

What is so great about this film - beyond the acting - is how complex and multi-layered the story is.  You have to see it multiple times to get everything, such as Cruise's realization while looking in the Gideon Bible from Palmer House in Chicago, and you (or at least I) never get tired of seeing it again.  This is because the story is so dense with detail and so perfectly executed.  Thru it all, Cruise pulls it off as a totally believable actor, on a par with Sean Connery in the early Bond films.  (For anyone with a taste for the authentic, their enjoyment of Bond simply could not tolerate the corniness of Roger Moore - that is the level of Cruise's performance in this one.)

Warmly recommended for connoissuer's of the action genre.  You can hardly do better than this one, with the exceoption of the early Bond or Matt Damon in Bourne.",1122249600,2,881,4.401234567901234
828970,4,630420065X,"Less an homage to the classic show, ""Mission: Impossible"" is more like an homage to cold-war thrillers in general, with international travel, intrigue in European cities and some high-tension excitement inspired by the classic hesit movie ""Topkapi"".  MI stars Cruise as Ethan Hunt, the front man of the ""Impossible Mission Force"" (which coincidentally shares its initials with ""International Monetary Fund - interesting coincidence).

The flick begins in Prague with a mission to nab a turncoat who steals an index of secret agents across the world - the NOC list.  At first everything works like clockwork - then it goes wrong.  Hunt finds himself on the run as his fellow agents die.  Soon, he's the sole survivor, and the disk is missing.  Unable to return home (his superiors think he's the turncoat) Hunt goes after the disk himself.  Following up on some slim clues, Hunt hooks up with a British arch-criminal played by Vanessa Redgrave who has the disk - cleverly convincing her that its ""tainted"" (it has a virus that causes whatever computer runs it to emit a distinctive frequency).  What Redgrave's character can't give him, is the identity of the man who gave her the disk - likely also responsible for betraying Hunt's team.  To get that, Hunt will have to steal the NOC list himself - and that will require him to hook up with the darkest agents ever to grace the IMF's ""Disavowed-by-the-Secretary Agents"" list"", stage an impossible burglary of CIA HQ, and download the information directly from the CIA mainframe.  Then he must navigate his fellow thieves, including Jean Reno as a maverick assassin and pilot, Ving Rhames as a master-hacker, and Julie Delpy as the wife of Mr. Phelps.

This was a great flick - at times so incomprehensible you're tempted to write it off all as nonsense.  But Cruise and DePalma miraculously manage to hold your attention for the entire run.  There are so many great momemts that work with subtlety off of DePalma's high-tension direction - as if the director had done his work suspended from the ceiling by wires in some corner of the CIA.  Much better by half than its witless sequel, MI keeps from self-destructing through the end of the movie.

WISH I'D THOUGHT OF IT: The CIA computer room is secured by numerous devices meant to keep anybody from getting to the computer.  They've boobytrapped the walls and the floor to keep the computer safe; there are heat sensors, pressure sensors and sound sensors - everything to keep anybody from getting into the computer when the designated users locks up.  So why if the keyboard is what they're trying to protect, why ain't it boobytrapped?",1121644800,,2640,4.883408071748879

Visually the film is stunning, plenty of action, but the script is extremely weak, the dominant presence of Cruise along the film, shadows the ominous presence of figures as Jon Voight, Scott Thomas, Jean Reno and Vanessa Redgrave who are pitifully wasted in insipid lines.
To win in a thriller you have to think in the evilness of the characters too. It is not enough to shine with bit nails sequences. I mean; there is a balance problem in the dramatic environment. And the presence of the enemy is so diminished that it is reduced to a simple cartoon.
The final sequence crossed the line of the credibility to convert itself in a funny joke.
That's what it happens when you loss the dramatic equilibrium and the abuse of the special effects domains the balance.",1120435200,,933,4.695121951219512

829033,1,630420065X,"If you're a younger viewer you might be entertained by the gadgets and explosions. However, if you grew up watching the original T.V. series, as I did, you would walk away from this movie shouting, as did the late Greg Morris (who played Barney, the technical wiz, in the original series), ""What an abomination!""

  The series was about a highly skilled and disciplined group of elite intelligence agents who combine their unique talents and skills to accomplish missions deemed impossible in the ordinary wing of the C.I.A. Their success was made possible, partly, by their working as a single integrated team. Each had his or her specific task to perform as part of the overall plan. Mr. Phelps, the I.M.F. team leader, assembled his team and they developed the mission plan and procedures the way NASA, Grumman and North American Rockwell engineers did in accomplishing the moon missions. No one stood out or tried to dominate.

  The movie completely wrecks this premise. Yes, it has the gadgets and high-tech stuff (like the laytex masks) and there seems to be a team of sorts, but that's all that the movie takes from the series. They purport to operate as a team, but that turns out to be an illusion. The entire team, except the one played by Tom Cruise, are double agents. Phelps (played by John Voight) turns out to be a traitor and enemy agent. They are all out to kill Tom Cruise, who has to save the world and kill Phelps and the entire I.M.F team as well -- all by himself, of course.

  Cruise's ego demanded that no one else share the spotlight with him. He just appropriated the title, music and trademark gadgets of the Mission Impossible series to produce a one-man hero shoot-em-up and blow-em-up flick that has nothing to do with the original series. None of the original cast were offered roles in the movie. Offering Peter Graves (the original Phelps) a cameo part would have been the class thing to do. But neither the movie, nor Cruise, have any class. Teens would find it entertaining, but if you are an adult who remembers the original series, don't see this movie. You will be disappointed.

  Paramount should release the entire T.V. series -- all seasons -- on DVD.",1102032000,8,2195,4.702349869451697
829034,4,630420065X,"Brian De Palma and Tome Cruise is a pretty good formula for a successful film. If you throw in the fact that it's a clasic TV show with Oscar caliber writers then you have a sure fire hit. Mission Impossible is that and is one of the better spy movies to have come out in recent years.

Ethan Hunt(Cruise) is an IMF agent. He's good at what he does and likes it. He's on a mission in Prague led by his mentor and friend Jim Phelps(Voight). The mission goes all wrong and the whole team is murdered except for Ethan. He escapes death and goes to the CIA for help in Kittridge(Czerny).

Kittridge quickly informs Ethan on how the misson was a whole set up to see who the mole in IMF was. Ethan takes the blame and is disenbowed. He is now on the run trying to find out who framed him and to see if he can stop them in time.

Tom Cruise is a perfect fit for Ethan Hunt. I've seen a little bit of the classic spy show and Cruise is the man. I can't picture anybody else playing the character. This is a fun character for Cruise in what I feel is one of his more fun movies. He gets caught up in dramas and people really forget what kind of action star this guy is. You have to love a leading man that does his own stunts and Cruise work is incredible. The bullet trains sequence is awesome. The instant classic though is what he does in the vault supended from the rope on the pulley system. He had a lot of faith in this movie and the character and even helped produce the movie. Very few people in Hollywood get involved with a movie like Cruise and he is all over this one.

This is a fun movie. This is what I wish ""License to Kill"" would have been like. It's fun and pretty unpredictable, though they do give you some none obvious clues to who the killer might really be. I knew all along but still enjoyed it. If you love Cruise you have to pick this one up. If you like spy movies you'll also get a kick out of it.

829036,4,630420065X,"One in an endless series of cinematic translations of famous TV shows, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, based on the classic 1966-1973 series of the same name, is, however, one of the better ones, thanks to a fairly solid cast and the high-power direction of master filmmaker Brian DePalma (CARRIE; SCARFACE).

Tom Cruise stars as Ethan Hunt, a member of the Impossible Mission Force (IMF), an ultra-secret arm of the CIA that takes on the assignments that the CIA's regular staff wouldn't touch with a bargepole.  Their newest assignment is to catch a traitor in the illegal act of downloading a secret CIA Noc-List from the U.S. embassy in Prague.  But when things go horribly wrong there, and Cruise is (seemingly) the only one left alive, he learns that the operation was in fact a molehunt designed to catch a turncoat inside the IMF's midst.  The result is a fast-paced, suspenseful rocket ride of a film with many brilliant set-pieces, all under DePalma's concise direction and with a fine script by David Koepp (JURASSIC PARK) and Robert Towne (CHINATOWN).

Though, like many espionage-oriented films, it can be confusing on occasion, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE scores thanks to the sheer skill of the way the story is laid out for us.  Jon Voight essays the role of Jim Phelps that Peter Graves had on TV, but the rest of the roles are all new (nobody from the series even has a cameo role).  However, despite the casting changes, some things remain the same, like the opening title sequence and Lalo Schifrin's tense and taut theme music, adapted by Danny Elfman (EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, ""The Simpsons"").  Cruise does a very good job under DePalma's supervision, as does Voight; and Henry Czerny, who had played the CIA heavy in CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER, basically reprises that role in the guise of CIA director Gene Kittridge with unctuous exactness.  The scene of Cruise downloading the NOC list from the IMF mainframe computer at CIA headquarters while suspended from the ceiling is one of the most tension-filled sequences in cinematic history, thanks to DePalma's crafty decision to film it using only natural sounds; and the final sequence in the Chunnel is just as hair-raising.

With so many twists and turns, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, despite some flaws, is never dull for a single moment.  It is a great ""blockbuster"" film--entertaining and well-crafted all at once, and vigorously recommended.",1093219200,,2385,5.012658227848101

Cruise, an excellent dramatic actor, does a great job crossing over into an action star--even with the bad haircut.

Cast:  Tom Cruise, Jon Voight, Emmanuelle Beart, Emilio Estevez, Vanessa Redgrave, Harry Czerny, Ving Rhames, Jean Reno.
Running Time:  110 minutes.
Rated PG-13 for violence and some language.
Based on the popular 1960's television series, this Brian De Palma (""Carrie"", ""Scarface"") production possesses all of the qualities of a fun, top-of-the-line action flick--only to see it slightly crumble due to a storyline that is extremely tough to follow.  Tom Cruise stars as the slick covert agent Ethan Hunt, who has been assigned with a crack team of American undercover agents to set up operations in Prague to catch a double agent (Jon Voight) in the act.
There are many scenes that are very exciting, especially the chase scene on the train finale; however, De Palma does not expand on a script that assumes the audience knows all of the technological and spy jargon, leaving us loving the action but lost in the wind.  Cruise is only fairly adequate as Hunt, not given the chance to expand his character.  Excellent special effects, a riveting, catchy musical score, and some fine supporting roles from Voight, Emmanuelle Beart, and Ving Rhames.  A good action movie, but nothing more.

829039,3,630420065X,"Cruise & company have a good action movie going here. It has some some very good actors doing some good acting in it, it has some excellent cinematography, some jam-up stuntwork, some way cool CGI imagery, some really fine soundtrack work, and some snappy direction from a name brand director. As some reviewers below have noted, the tunnel train sequence is truly awesome...one of the best ""kiss your b--- goodbye"" moments in recent action film history. A stunner.
  If Tom Cruise and his production company had called this movie something like...oh....""Deathwatch"", or ""Blowback"", or some such and gone with it as an action-thriller spy movie about a special covert ops unit of the CIA, DIA, or military intelligence thrown into an emergency situation with a traitor in their midst, I, myself, and undoubtedly a lot of others, would have been fine with it. Most likely I'd have given this film a five-star review.
  I didn't do that because what Cruise & Company elected to do was to appropriate the rights to the old, dearly-loved ""Mission Impossible"" spy series---most likely because they thought the jazzy, iconic Lalo Shifrin theme music was ""cool as h---"" and because the preposterous idea of latex facial makeups that one could peel off in an instant on the run looked too hard to resist
as a fun plot gimmick.
  If those elements were all that truly composed Mission Impossible then this new version should have been piece of cake acceptancewise with the public. But it hasn't been, for the same reason some of these other movie adaptations of popular tv shows haven't been....because there is an arrogance in Hollywood that relates to televison vs. ""CINEMA"". The Hollywood attitude is one of ""We know how to do these things better than you do, tv, so stand aside and let us show you how"". Recent duds like ""The Avengers"" and ""The Wild Wild West"" show us clearly that Hollywood does NOT know how to do it ""better' than television. They just know how to do it bigger, flashier, and smarmier. Content-wise, classic tv usually comes out miles ahead.
  An earlier reviewer of this film here at Amazon, Barry Chow, hit the nail on the head when he said this Cruise version betrays its heritage. That's exactly what it does. Mission Impossible (and its team) was about stealth and guile; about putting one over on somebody and leaving them none the wiser until it was too late. It was a CAPER concept, closer in intent to ""The Sting"" than to ""True Lies"". In fact that is what each of the IM Force's missions WERE...""Stings""....not Detonation Derbys. Cruise & Company seem to have forgotten this...or never understood it in the first place. And the power of the real ""MI"" was that it was, at heart, an ENSEMBLE show (like ""Friends"" on t.v., or ""E.R.""), with the TEAM pulling the scams on their target victims. A ""team"" is vaguely depicted in this Cruise version, but basically...in music terms...as Ethan Hunt's ""side men"". The thrust of this story's interaction is actually Ethan Hunt, Secret Agent, vs. the ""Mysterious Traitor"".
  And it is the identity of this sleazy, ruthless,double-dealing scumbucket of a traitor that is at the root of all the ""boomer' backlash against this movie. And most justifiably so. They have made him Jim Phelps. And to all Americans everywhere who ""grew up with Jim Phelps"", this little plot device is utterly outrageous. Beyond the pale. A lot of the
""gen X"" and younger crowd truly DON'T understand why this movie ticks so many people off. It's because a popular ""hero"" figure to a couple of generations of Americans has been turned...for the sake of 'edginess""...into an odious sleazeball. and that doesn't sit well with a lot of people...AT ALL. If you don't understand the annoyance, try this...try waiting ten or fifteen years down the road and then buying your ticket to see the movie version of ""Friends"", where you'll find that Ross is a serial killer, Rachel is a cannibal, and Joey a Nazi transvestite. And when you get mad because you know full well that this is NOT who these people are and NOT what they're about then maybe you'll start getting a glimmer of why this review only deals Tom Cruise 3 stars instead of 5.",1076803200,2,4166,4.797768479776848

Its worst crime is its betrayal of its heritage. The original TV series embodied something rare in Hollywood: the recognition that a team is more than just the sum of its components. There were no 'stars' in the original TV production because the ascendancy of any one character would have destroyed the concept of teamwork that defined the very essence of the series. The only other production to understand this concept so clearly--and not coincidentally, to achieve similar success and staying power--is the ensemble drama ""Law and Order"".
This movie not only ignores that central fact, but takes malicious delight in destroying it. Its 'star' is so narcissistic and egocentric that he bought the rights to a series about teamwork and corrupted it into a one-man vanity show.
I actually looked forward to seeing this movie when it was initially released. I had remembered the series with fondness and had hoped for a rebirth of its ideas. Stupid me. I don't know if I was more foolish expecting humility from Tom Cruise or scruples from Hollywood.
The brutishness of this movie is almost as bad as its betrayal. The TV series was about not just teamwork, but finesse. Characters as often conned their way into restricted areas or out of trouble as made use of stunts and fancy gadgets. This was what the masks were all about. But in this movie, it's all about acrobatics and toys. There are so many stunts and gadgets (and so little else) that the movie becomes nothing more than a spitting contest between itself and the James Bond franchise.

829131,3,630420065X,"Having just watched this film again, I was struck by how engaging it is. Sure, the plot machinations get hopelessly convoluted but I think that's kinda the point. Who cares about specific plot points when you've got Brian DePalma directing with his usual stylistic flourishes. True, he's a bit more tied down than with his usual fair (see Blow Out) but even DePalma on autopilot is pretty impressive.
This film works much better than its sequel because it doesn't try to pad out the film with a useless romantic subplot. Ethan Hunt isn't a character that needs to be fleshed out and that's what makes the no-nonsense tone of MI1 so superior to MI2. Stylistically, Woo beats DePalma hands down but that's about it.
The presence of actors like Jon Voight and Henry Czerny give the first MI an almost Tom Clancy-like feel -- especially in the vein of Hunt For Red October with all the espionage and technospeak.
Also, the setting of Eastern Europe contributes a lot to the overall atmosphere of the film -- especially the opening sequence where Hunt's team is betrayed and killed off, one by one.
There are some really solid set-pieces in the movie: the aforementioned mission gone wrong at the beginning, the now-famous nearly silent break-in at CIA Headquarters, and the infamous train/helicopter chase at the film's climax. Yeah, that last one was mucho implausible but it's still a lot of fun to watch.
Most importantly, Mission: Impossible is an entertaining time waster with a lean script full of all sorts of twists and turns, a solid performance by Cruise and a great supporting cast that also includes the always reliable Ving Rhames and Jean Reno.
Alas, this DVD is very bare bones with no extras to speak of. Thankfully, Paramount learned their lesson with the MI2 DVD but it would be nice if they revisited this first one and got DePalma to do an audio commentary, throw in some deleted scenes and a retrospective featurette or two.

The finale is ridiculously far-fetched, but when at the height of its silliness Lalo Schifrin's original Mission Impossible theme kicks in, the film's self-parodying nature becomes suddenly becomes abundantly clear. Best of all, De Palma achieves this comedic edge without losing any of the suspense or drama.

People who say this movie has no plot, and when I say this I'm serious, cannot have a very high IQ level. This movie, unlike its sequel, requires a sophisticated audience to watch it. What I'm saying is that you can't be stupid and understand the brilliance of this film.
Ever since the beginning of the show, it has always required smart people to watch it. It's a mystery, mysteries don't make much sense until everything is figured out. The movie itself is actually quite simple:
Ethan Hunt is working for the IMF. After one of his missions goes bad and everyone is killed but him, the IMF suspects he is the mole they've been hunting for two years. Ethan, being innocent, runs and hides from the IMF. He goes through difficult tasks such as breaking into CIA headquarters at Langley, making negotiations with arms dealers, and avoiding the law. In the end, Ethan finds that the mole is none other than his old boss, who had faked his death to frame Ethan.
Overall, I give this film four stars. It didn't quite reach five, a few lines didn't clearer make sense or agree with each other.",1057881600,,1194,4.506912442396313

De Palma makes complete use of depth within the frame and his visual style is unmatched by any director working today (Scorsese being the exception) so this film (unlike MI2) holds up and is still interesting & riveting after repeated viewings. MI2 is a stupid, cliched plot with lotsa action and explosions I have already seen.

However, it boggles itself down with too much dialogue and confusing plot twists. But it's no doubt a highly-enjoyable movie. Tom Cruise is Ethan Hunt, a secret agent who has been betrayed and now must prove his innocence. This is the most of the plot of which we know for sure. The other details are too complicated to really understand, but they don't matter. What matters is the constantly suspenseful moments including the beginning where Hunt and team are chasing after a bad guy to the heist Hunt makes in the CIA building to the incredible helicopter-chasing-the-train sequence that makes up the film's climax. There's much to enjoy in this movie and, if you watch it a few times, it even begins to make sense. I highly recommend it to any action fan who doesn't mind thinking every now and then.

Mission Impossible does not disappoint with its action, but its plotline stands rather simply as a betrayal and vengeance formula, and worse, one rather implausible to the legions of fans of the television series.  Without giving away too much of the plot, a most trusted member of the Impossible Mission Force betrays his team and country for ... money.  Though the nature of the betrayer makes for a much greater indignity at his crime, it leaves fans of the series feeling as if the film simply lops off its head to begin anew, discarding the roots that made the movie itself possible.
Tom Cruise still delivers an excellent performance as a slick and capable member of the IMF, and fans of action films will certainly enjoy this picture.  However, if you feel more than an inkling of loyalty to the series, perhaps you should skip to the second film, which in the end has much more the feel of Mission Impossible than does this movie.",1047513600,,1166,4.596153846153846

829193,2,630420065X,"This is a great movie if you are a fan of action films.  Cruise is good as Ethan Hunt.  Jon Voigt fair as Jim Phelps.  The supporting characters add to the action and the suspense is solid throughout.
But if you like the TV show, this is a lousy movie.  It has little spirit from the TV show and what they do to Phelps is a crime.  If Hunt's character is created new for the franchise couldn't they have used another character - instead of Phelps - to play the role they designed?
When you remake a television show there are certain elements that should be true to the remake - otherwise totally remake them.  Putting in new characters?  OK - just don't play with the believability and the make up of the old ones.  Of course when a show is as old as Mission you aren't going to want the same leads playing their old characters, at least not if they are in a lead role.  Voigt is not Jim Phelps - appearance:  wrong; style of speech: wrong; leadership ability:  wrong.
This isn't to say that Mission is so sacred that it can't be changed.  But if the plan is to use the popularity of an old TV show to stir interest, why insult that popularity in the manner in which they did?  Dan Ackroyd used the Dragnet franchise to make a comedy years ago - but he honored the spirit of the show in doing so.
The long technical moments showing Barney and Willy or some other character from TV are missing here and probably rightfully so.  They could be boring on the big screen, especially if not done right - and it appears that the director and star weren't planning on doing it right.
This is a star vehicle for Cruise and he handles it well.  But they had no business messing with the franchise.  At the least, they should have made up for it in the sequel.",1037491200,12,1749,4.238670694864048

829197,5,630420065X,"I don't know why I like this film as much as I do.  Looking over the reviews here and seeing a lot of the rather mediocre reception, and lauding of such scenes as the CIA breakin and Chunnel chase as the best in the film and 'reasons for buying', I wonder, what IS it I'm so fascinated by?  Because for sure, even though the aforementioned sequences are definitely ranking high on a cool-level, they're not my favorites by far.  They're not close to why I like the movie.
So WHY?  Let me examine.  Ethan Hunt - he's not the flashy, trigger-happy action hero that 'gets the girl' in so many modern blockbusters.  In fact, the guy only picks up a gun once in the entire movie, and doesn't even fire it.  (Too bad this all went down the drain in M:I-2, a sequel which felt like a parody of this.)  The top of his class in the IMF - Impossible Mission Force - Ethan likes to be quick and effective.  He doesn't like needless killing.  As a plus, he resists his love interest, Claire, because he respects her marriage to his boss (Jim Phelps)...is this unheard-of?  The movie is free of any sex. (!) As a result of all these traits, and the complete gut-wrenching mess Ethan is put in for the duration of the film, he ends up as quite a likeable character.  And that's the heart of it.
The plot - I hear over and over about how it's 'so confusing', but it's not.  You only need to be an attentive viewer.  This movie wasn't made for people with short attention spans seeking a few thrills and wowzer action effects.  It requires you to PARTICIPATE...what a concept! - and one I greatly appreciate.  Every piece of the story unfolds perfectly onscreen, but if you're being lax, you'll miss it.  It's almost as if you're going on a detective mission WITH Ethan, and you're just as surprised as him when things start clicking.
So what are my favorite parts of the film?  The vault infiltration and Chunnel ending sequence get so much recognition that I sometimes wonder...am I simply nuts for absolutely loving the way Ethan's final chat with Phelps goes?  'It was Kittridge,' Phelps says, trying to sound convincing (and he will to the nonattentive viewer)...but Ethan knows better, and it shows as he replays all the events of the Prague mission out in his mind.  And it's no fun either, because Phelps is his boss and friend.  Then he asks the encrypted question...'Why, Jim, why?'  Assumed to be 'Why would Kittridge do it', it's really 'Why would YOU do it?'
It's stuff like this that makes the movie work on a personal level for me, and I have no idea exactly how it pulls off.  I've heard over and over the 'all style no substance' criticism plastered on and it just goes right over my head.  But oh well.  I'll enjoy my Mission: Impossible, thank-you-very-much, and critics can take their views elsewhere.  This'll always remain one of my very favorite movies - it just don't get old.

Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is the leader of the pack, but the mission goes sourly wrong leaving him as the lone survivor. Even Phelps was taken care of. Or was he? Throughout the movie, Hunt tries to establish a new team and sell a copy of the list to a secret buyer. When he does that, the unidentified killer will remove his mask and make you realize that you've been dooped. C'mon, how simple is this movie? It's very self-explanatory.

829202,5,630420065X,"""Mission Impossible"" is probably one of the best spy films I've seen in a long time! Different from James Bond 007 movies, ""Mission Impossible"" has a clever plot, lots of twists and turns, edge-of-your seat suspense, some parts where there is witty humor, and action which would satisfy any movie lover!
Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is sent on a mission with other IMF agents Jim Phelps (John Voight), his wife Claire Phelps (Emmanuelle Beart), Sarah Davies (Kristin Scott Thomas), Jack Harmen (Emilio Estevez), and Hannah Williams (Ingeborga Dapkunaite). It's a fairly simple job in Prague, their mission is to keep surveillance on the top-secret NOC list. But everything goes wrong as the list in stolen and one by one, all of the agents are killed, leaving only Ethan alive. He then learns that the list that was stolen was actually fake, and that the whole thing was a set-up to capture a 'mole'. And since Ethan was the only one left alive, he is now the prime suspect for being the traitor. Now disavowed with a man-hunt going on for him, Ethan must find out who the real culprit is and to do that, he plans on stealing the real NOC list to bait him! With help from Claire who had not really been killed and two other disavowed agents Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and Franz Krieger (Jean Reno), they now have a 'mission impossible', to catch the traitor!
This is certainly a 5 star movie since it has what I think all the ingredients that are needed in a good action movie: acting, plot, action, suspense, and a bit of humor. And ""Mission Impossible"" has it all! But probably the two ingredients which were the most well used was the superbly written plot and the action.
The plot was pretty original, not the usual 'an evil man/group planning to take over the world' plot, but one where agents all over the world would be in danger if the NOC list isn't kept safe. Also there was plenty of mystery, surprises, and twists and turns, making the watcher actually having to think during the movie. You would actually have to watch ""Mission Impossible"" a few times to get the whole story.
As for the action, probably the highlights of the film are most probably the beginning where the agents are keeping surveillance on the NOC list, the breaking into the CIA computer vault, and the helicopter/train scene. My personal favorite is the breaking into the safe in the CIA safe, it was a really exciting part!
There was a sequel made after this movie, ""Mission Impossible 2"". Returning in the movie are of course Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt and Ving Rhames as Luther Stickell. Though it was very exciting and more action packed, the plot was very, very simple compared to the first movie and also it had a different director, John Woo, direct. All in all, an OK movie which I recommend to watch. And of course, all James Bond movies are must-sees.",1011916800,5,2840,4.625742574257425

Well-done, unlike #2 which suffered from incoherence and a lack of intelligence, not to mention tremendous overstylizing. You will have to watch this brilliant thriller at least three times so as to get all of the plot twists down.

Jon Voight takes the role of Jim Phelps, the only character returning from the TV series. Tom Cruise is an everyman, but he is most similar to the Martin Laudau character. Emilio Estevez is a techno-geek with creativity to spare, much like Greg Morris' character.

What happens is a plot to expose a spy and protect agents fails. All of the agents on Ethan Hunt's team are seemingly dead. Who is behind it, and why? The answer to who the traitor is lies with the enigmatic Max, who Ethan must entrap to clear his name. Throughout the movie there is some fascinating posturing as first Claire, then Jim are found alive, and all three must piece together what happened and expose the traitor. Several memorable scenes: The aquarium exploding, the Terminal Room (of course!), and the bullet train segment are simply eye-popping. Why this movie got so much negative reactions puzzles me.

2.  One of Hollywood's most sensitive males, Jon Voight, proves that he can effectively play a slimy and devious character.

829398,4,630420065X,"""Mission: Impossible"" was (I thought) supposed to be the movie sequel to the classic TV series. If not, why call it ""Mission: Impossible""? But something happened on the way to the theater, because this is nothing like the old TV show. In fact, any similarity appears to be purely coincidental. And that's the major problem with this film. The title raises expectations, but the film doesn't deliver on those expectations.
Taken purely as a spy thriller, this flick is fine. It has some great action sequences. In particular, the CIA break-in is clever and tense. The end piece in the tunnel is also entertaining, but it stretches credibility a long way. The plot is almost too complicated -- sometimes it's hard to keep up with who is doing what to whom. But, hey, that's good. Better a bit complex than so simple a two-year-old could keep up. The acting is generally acceptable, too. Yeah, Tom Cruise is a little hard to accept as a master spy, but he gets by.
As a spy thriller, ""Mission: Impossible"" is a strong four star effort (maybe even a soft five stars). That it's linked with the ""Mission: Impossible"" TV series is a negative. I'd still like to see an ""M:I"" movie. You know: top agent gets extremely difficult assignments, formulates plans, picks teams of operatives with suitable skills and abilities, and, using a combination of sleight-of-hand, high tech trickery, and sheer daring, achieves the objective. Those were great fun. This film is also fun, but ""M:I"" it isn't. I'm giving it four stars strictly on its own merits.

Little did I know that I had guessed right and it was exciting to watch the plot unfold.

Ethan Hunt, an MI agent, has just seen his entire team cut down in an apparent internal mole hunt. Now he is the one accused, and must hurry to uncover the true traitor while keeping himself alive. He is aided by different people all the way, and like the best James Bond movies, can't trust anyone completely, for they may be in on it. This DVD offers great sound and picture clarity, so if you are a major Tom Cruise fan or liked this film, you will definatley want to check this one out on DVD.",983318400,,622,4.3247863247863245
829401,3,630420065X,"When I call this film ""standard action fare,"" I mean that it's a film where the action scenes and the effects are the main drawing cards.  It's not a memorable film, or one that I see myself viewing repeatedly, but it has enough strengths to be watchable.
Other reviewers have found ""Mission: Impossible's"" plot confusing.  I found it merely routine--a by-the-numbers MacGuffin plot which serves mainly to fill screen time between the three big set-piece action scenes.  I simply didn't find myself caring about the characters or what was happening to them.
It is the first two of those three set-pieces which make this film reasonably worthwhile viewing.  In the first, the majority of hero Ethan Hunt's IMF team is wiped out in Prague.  In the second, Hunt must penetrate a super-secure CIA computer lab to steal the aforementioned MacGuffin, a list of secret agents.  In both scenes, director Brian De Palma eschews exotic special effects in favor of some old-fashioned suspense, with very succesful results.  The third set-piece, a chase on board a train, strains plausibility at times and works less well.
There is only one weak link in the cast.  Unfortunately, it is Tom Cruise, who is not a good choice as Ethan Hunt (since Cruise co-produced the film, he may be partly to blame for miscasting himself).  Cruise is fine in the action scenes, but he simply doesn't project the intelligence that his character demands.  He plays the role like it's a reprise of the grinning, live-on-the-edge pilot he played in ""Top Gun,"" and that doesn't work here.
A talented supporting cast is largely wasted.  Vanessa Redgrave gives an interesting performance, and Ving Rhames leaves a strong impression in limited screen time.  Otherwise, talented performers like Jon Voight, Emanuelle Beart, Emilio Estevez and Kristin Scott Thomas are given very little to do.
Finally, while I was never a big fan of the MI television series, I do think that resurrecting the Jim Phelps character from the series, only to have him turn villain, is going a bit too far.  I can readily understand why fans of the series would have trouble suspending their disbelief on that point.",981331200,,2157,4.958333333333333

829423,5,630420065X,"I've owned this DVD for almost two years now.  i probably watched this five or six times.  Every time I watch this movie, I notice it again and again, how skillfuly pieces are put together.  First of all, nothing that comes up on the screen is accident.  That means, every little action or even just slight passing of an object gives the viewer a piece of information.  Director De Palma did a superb job of implying what's going to happen, without being too obvious.  for example, in the beginning of the movie, you see a Russian couple walking around, drunk, out side of the embassy.  Screen focuses on them just for two seconds.  You wouldn't normally guess that they would have any connection with the storyline.  Well, it later turns out that the couple was another IMF team working in a mole hunt mission.  Another very subtle part is where Tom Cruise is obtaining the NOC list at the headquater of CIA, in Lanley.  When Tom Cruise copies that list from the computer, while hanging on a rope from a ventilation, he takes out two blank writable CD's.  I mean why the hell would he want to take out two CD's for.  Well, little bit later in the movie, that small, subtle scene plays a role.  Mission Impossible I has a lot of subtle scenes.  Watch carefully, then things will make sense.  All pieces fall into one great piece.  As far as DVD is concerned, it has low video quality.  But I think it worths spending money on DVD.",976320000,9,1430,4.455598455598456

829425,4,630420065X,"Nitpickers be warned: as with many spy movies, the best of Bond included, realism is not Mission: Impossible's long suit.  Some complain that the plot is confusing, but it's all there if you pay careful attention to the twists and double-crosses.  If you just go with the story and have fun with it and not get bogged down thinking about what is and isn't realistic, MI is well done and well worth seeing.  It holds up well in repeated viewings, making a video purchase worth considering rather than just a one-time rental.  MI has a strong cast; yeah, okay, Tom Cruise does overact in a couple brief segments, on the first pay phone and in the restaurant, but is otherwise very good, as is the rest of the cast.  Other highlights include direction by Brian DePalma that builds the tension and peaks effectively, and convincing special effects and stunts.  MI doesn't have the visual pizazz and striking cinematography of the sequel, but I prefer it overall to MI2, hurt by John Woo's direction of fighting and chase scenes, too much over the top for me.  (I can ""go with"" MI and enjoy it; I can't do that with the fights and chases that comprise the second half of MI2.)
Specifically as to the DVD edition, MI got a very good video transfer.  There's a 2.35:1 widescreen version; at this ratio, you'll probably want a large-screen or widescreen TV to prefer the widescreen to the included and well-framed pan-and-scan version (on 27"" and under, the widescreen image is too small); the colors and detail in the video transfer are quite good.  Soundtrack choices include a terrific English Dolby Digital 5.1 track that really rocks the house on a good sound system (there is no DTS track here), an English Dolby Surround track, and a French language track in Dolby Surround.  English and Spanish subtitles can be superimposed.  There's a trailer, but no special features.  Four stars both for the film and for the DVD transfer, a reasonable value.",974678400,,1946,4.741839762611276

The basic story here is a winner. I won't give it away, but it made perfect sense. (Not a plot to take over the world or blow up a major city, etc.)
The special effects were just a bonus to the script, although there were a couple incidents of being a little unrealistic. There have been much worst in past movies, so I don't really hold it against Mission Impossible.
The characters were well represented by their actors. Cruise may have overacted a touch but nobody seemed out of place in their role. Just like in the show of old, they were always cool under pressure and had the cool little gadgets to get the job done.

829512,4,630420065X,"In the style of my favorite DVD site, IGN.com, I'm going to review this movie based on four areas: The movie, the video, the audio, and the extras.
THE MOVIE  Wow. Tom Cruise is at his energetic best.  Ethan Hunt is a young and very skilled IMF operative. After all, his mentor  is one of the best: Jim Phelps. A man named Golitsyn has gotten himself  into a position to steal the CIA's NOC list, and has the intent of selling  it on the black market. Phelps, along with Ethan Hunt and the other four  members of his IMF team are given the mission to catch Golitsyn in the act  of  stealing the NOC list, apprehend him, thereby retrieving the stolen  list. Everything goes wrong. All members of the team, except Ethan are  killed, including Phelps. The operation was a molehunt. Hunt is supected of  the killings, and accused of imbessling money from the CIA. This is just  the surface. There are many many more major-players, all part of a huge and  complex conspiracy.  Brian De Palma did an amazing job. This film is  visual feast, for half the story is told through camera movement. The  film's plot is extremely complicated. I have watched the film several  times, and everytime I do, I notice something new and a another little  detail that makes more sense of the plot. This film is one that has to be  watched closely. Many of the plot points and nuances are subtle and require  you to pay close attention. An Action/suspense film that has brains. Who  would have thought?
THE VIDEO
  Stunning. A little dirty, but that is  expected. After all, an original theatrical print was used for the  transfer. Slight graniness, but you won't really notice unless finding  flaws is the reason you are watching the movie. You also have the choice of  watching the film in Pan-and-Scan or Widescreen.
THE AUDIO
  Pretty  good if you have the right equipment. I usually set the disc at Dolby 5.1  sound. That option is great if you have good speakers. For those of you  that hve just your Televisions, keep the disc on 2 channel. You also have  the option to watch it in French.
THE EXTRA
  The heading should be  THE EXTRAS. However, there is only one extra. All you get is the theatrical  trailer. That isn't bad, but is definately not enough. Sorry, but scene  selection, interactive menus, captions, and subtitles do not count as  special features, especially to today's DVD's standards. (Have you seen the  Fight Club DVD?)
  Not a bad package when you consider the quality of  the sound and video, but special features are very important. Without them,  you might as well go and and buy the VHS version, and save yourself a  couple of bucks.",963273600,2,2643,4.589247311827957

IT's obviously much better in terms of plot and style than the  farce of a movie directed by the overrated Jhon Woo.

The plot involves more questions than answers and seems to resemble a bus leaving a stop with the  dumbfounded passengers-to-be left at the stop confused at why the bus just  kept on going. This action flick started out with a  straight-forward-cliche-spy-mission to retrieve a certain bit of  information. The mission appeared to be a failure. Things got ugly in a  hurry. That was when the bus left(so to speak) and the confusion began. The  way it ended still has me baffled. The action sequence at the end is  laughable. Trust me, it is beyond believable. Seeing is not believing in  this movie. There are certain instances in ""Mission Impossible""  when characters show up with no explanation of how they actually got there.  They are just there.(See it, and you will understand that further)  ""Mission Impossible"" had a very original scene involving a  different way of portraying the thinking of a character at a particular  time.(I won't spoil it. That was great) So, if you solved ""Mission  Impossible"" during or after the first viewing you are truly and I mean  truly a genius.

No, it doesn't have the amazing John Woo running the action, which I have to  admit is better in 2, but the overall package is better. Tom Cruise  actually LOOKS like a spy/government agent; he's got the crew cut, he's  professional and not too flashy, unlike in the sequel where it's difficult  to take him seriously. There's an actual plot, and an incredibly involving  one at that. No, you can't just try to absorb the plot, you have to think  about it. It's not hard to follow if you just pay attention. The supporting  cast is EXCELLENT, and they are actually used to good effect, unlike in  M:I-2 where Ving Rhames and Anthony Hopkins are merely props to propel  Cruise along his merry way. DePalma keeps the tension high almost the  entire way through with very few lapses. And as a huge Bond fan, I will say  that this movie surpasses many of the Bond films in spy entertainment.

But, not all the film is not bad  - the cinematography is good, the special effects are brilliant and the  train chases and sound are good, too.

I must  admit that DVD buyers will spend a lot of money but this is one time where  I just didn't buy it immediately because I'm hooked on a DVD being a full  package.  This DVD is not.  No extras at all.  In fact, I should give this  DVD an F for extra's but it did have the trailer and although I usually  don't count trailers as extra's, in this case I did because without it, it  would be bare bones for a DVD.
If you watched the movie, you either liked  the old series or you liked the new movie with Tom Cruise.  Personally, I  don't mind both and I enjoyed the movie, maybe not tremendously but I'm  still disappointed this DVD is lacking.  I'm sure that Paramount could of  released an awesome DVD but they didn't.  No deleted  scenes...nothing.
This DVD was also not 16:9 enhanced but the video  colors were very good.  The thing is, I have to be truthful about this, I  didn't hear so much from my 5.1 system in terms of great, outstanding  sound.  The sound is good but nothing in terms of hearing great sound ala  ""The Fifth Element"" or ""Godzilla"". In fact, the final  scene, I was hoping to feel that blast all around me and I didn't.  I don't  know, perhaps someone else may have experienced something different.  The  reviews I read talked about great sound, obviously I'm missing it.
The  movie is good and yes, it's on DVD, so of course, I'm going to say get the  DVD instead of the video but the thing is this DVD deserves a special  edition re-release.  Perhaps when the second movie is released on DVD, they  will re-release this as a special edition and DVD fans will get what they  want.  Again, I'm not dissing on the movie.

While the acting for the most part  is sub-par (even though Cruise's performance is pretty damn good), the  story is what really sets this movie apart from the usual Bond-clone.  You  don't know who the enemy is until the end, which leaves you in suspense for  quite a while.  When you realize who it is, you find out that it all makes  sense.  The movie may take about 5 viewings before you can truly understand  it, and even then it's quite confusing.  But the movie is always enjoyable,  especially the last few scenes.
But what really got me into this movie is  it's revolutionary impact on the spy movie genre.

Then  he finds out in the center of it all is his former boss of his illflated  original team, Jim Phelps (Voight).  Fleeing from government agents and  C.I.A. assassins, Hunt springs into action in an attempt to stop his former  friend and now evil nemesis Phelps.  Suspenseful and well-done.  Produced  by star Tom Cruise himself along with Paula Wagner.

Why would a man who is a genius and the mastermind of the MI  Force betray his country and his friends for a mere million dollars when he  could easily obtain it legally?  Why would this man turn his back on his  enemy to kill his friend? How could a man survive a helicopter explosion  while traveling at high speed in a tunnel?

And this one  he knocks out of the park.  Tom Cruise takes on the leading role of Ethan  Hunt (adding to his credibility as more than a pretty face) and does a  convincing job with a role that in less suitable hands could be viewed as  one dimensional.  Things get rolling early and often as the team of C.I.A.  agents prepare an elaporate sting of a computer pirate looking to cash in  by selling a list of undercover agents to the highest bidder.  Before long  the plan falls apart and Ethan finds himself the only surviving member of  his team and in turn is suspected of killing the others.

When the mission goes wrong and Ethan is speaking to Phelps...its so obvious what is happening and the film vanishes under a cloud of predictability.
After the excellent first quarter hour the film plods along  between its two dull stunt set-pieces. Even these are just the usualy  ""by-the-book"" standard fare from the Hollywood production line.  If you've seen one explosive/roller-coaster ride/hero triumphs over bad guy sequemce you've seem them all. When Ethan breaks into the CIA to steal the CNOC list - there's nothnig new there at all. Its a scene that has been used in other films and a great many commercials. The Channel Tunnel scene is utterly laughable - not once did it have me on the end my seat - it just had me at the end of my tether that the film deteriorated so progressively.
I have heard some people say that this is a complicated film - I can only say that its complicated if you come in durnig the end titles. This is simplistic drivel, not only easy to follow but easy to predict. If you can't see what's happening next then you are too young to be watching this film.
Overall, a lame, boring film which again demonstrates that Brian dePalma is an overrrated director. Even the one  outstanding scene I remember from one of his films was ripped-off from  another (Battleship Potemkin).

829698,2,630420065X,"Mission Impossible the movie has nothing in common with the classic series from the 1960's.  As noted in many of the reviews, the film is impossible to understand in that there doesn't seem to be a coherent plot line.  The  element of suspense is forced here.  Granted, the TV series depended on a  sudden twist (as well as the obligatory commercial break) to maintain  suspense.  A one-hour series is invariablly difficult to transfer to the  big screen, but at least the TV series had some sense of coherency that was  lacking in the movie. Also, Mr. Phelps' transformation from good guy in the  series to villian in the film is too hard to believe (and for fans of MI, a  major disappointment). Now are the CIA the bad guys and are the good guys  really good here?  And I find it hard to believe that Jim Phelps could  knock off all the members of his team single-handedly.
Great special  effects and sound do not a good movie make and Tom Cruise is back to his  'Top Gun' days here when nobody took him as a serious actor (I still don't  consider him a serious actor-and that includes 'Jerry MacGuire"").  So  there's going to be a sequel and John Woo's directing?  Hopefully he can do  a better job similar to his Hong Kong movies, which show a grittiness and  realism that is so lacking in this film, but I'm not holding out much hope  given the quality of this film.  What if Tom Cruise bites the dust in the  new movie?  Now that would be the perfect plot twist.
One question  though, who's going to be the leader of the IMF?  Are they going to haul  out Dan Briggs out of retirement?  And if MI2 is as big a bomb as the first  movie, are the people involved going to disavow it?  And is the only reason  a sequel is being made because somebody 'showed the money' to the  principals?",949017600,2,1790,4.340425531914893
829699,4,630420065X,"I saw ""Mission: Impossible"" the movie and walked out conflicted. On one hand it was a terrifically exciting film, on the other it was confusing as all and seemed to lack the critical elements that made  ""Mission: Impossible"" the television show such a success during  the 1960s.
Brian De Palma is an exceptionally talented director quite  skilled at using the camera to give the viewer a deeper window into the  story (check out his use of camera angles in the restaurant sequence), and  Tom Cruise is a surprisingly talented actor who really carries the movie by  himself. Fans of actor Ving Rhames will be happy to know he has a number of  good scenes.
Fans of the old show had a gripe about the movie's focus on  Tom Cruise. After all the ""Mission: Impossible"" television show  was all about the team- each team member used their talents to catch the  bad guy in the nick of time each week. ""Mission: Impossible"" the  movie was about a man, Ethan Hunt, clearing his name. The spirit of the  show was not there, which in my estimation hurt the movie.
The movie's  complex labyrinth of doublecrosses and triplecrosses is rather confusing.  I'll wager half of all moviegoers hadn't a clue what the plot was really  about.
Otherwise ""Mission: Impossible"" is a great movie. The  music is excellent, the action sequences are clever and much more complex  than in the usual, garden variety action flick.",948412800,3,1399,4.738589211618257

Aside from his inexplicable addiction to the I-camera, one of the most distracting and  overrated camera techniques around, his visualization of Mission:  Impossible is cinematic, grand, and very exciting.
Tom Cruise makes for a  good action hero and Jon Voight a slyly effective supporting character --  unfortunately, as the script stands, it gives the excellent supporting cast  very little to do -- the divine Emmanuelle Beart gets little more than an  object-of-desire role; Kristin Scott-Thomas holds up well but doesn't get  enough screen time to develop her character; and Emilio Estevez, Jean Reno  and Ving Rhames are all relegated to nearly bit parts, each serving his  purpose well but given little chance to excel beyond that.

7866206,3,630420065X,"Tom Cruise Lights Up This Future Franchise.

Brian DePalma directs Mission Impossible with keen eye for darker noir shots with that falters in its dated 1990's style. The direction is strong as DePalma takes you on a joy ride with espionage, heists, action, and political intrigue. Mission Impossible is interesting in its clever story and twists that will surprise everyone on their first viewing that become obvious on repeat viewings. It's very fun and leads to better movies down the line. This movie does at least introduce to Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) in all his brilliance and excitement. These movies are not genius, but they do keep surprising you and remain entertaining to this day.

However, I must note how dated the special effects look in this debut Mission Impossible film with obvious toy sets, cheap CGI, dated special effects, and awkward moments. This was made in the middle of the '90's and you can really tell. From floppy discs and large block cell phones to little computer screens and fat laptops, you are always painfully of the era in which Mission Impossible was filmed. It is distracting, but not movie ruining.

Tonally, Mission Impossible takes itself too seriously. Its hyper sincere attitude is endearing and Cruise keeps you engaged. Although, its atmosphere gets destroyed by how campy the dialogue and acting comes across. So campy in moments, you will likely get taken right out of the experience. If you can accept this, Mission Impossible is worth a single watch to get you to the better sequels.

Most notably, the Mission Impossible score is still fun. Danny Elfman composed a highly memorable theme that you will remember forever. The way it is recorded in this movie is very dated and sounds older with its '90's alternative rock and metal background, but the symphonic elements still stand the test of time. It is a great score for the ages as represented by its continued cultural relevance and its usage in the Mission Impossible sequels.

The acting by Tom Cruise is the highlight as he takes it seriously enough that you believe it, but many of the performances lean of melodrama and poor writing. The supporting cast serves their roles well, but they often fall into the overacting category compared to Cruise who is considerably more reserved in this one. The hyper quick edits and odd close-up shots ruin some of the more sincere moments, but Cruise keeps on believing in this series. He remains the light of the Mission Impossible franchise in contemporary cinema, which you can witness blossom in this premier installment in the Mission Impossible movies.

Mission Impossible has aged poorly with its hard edged editing, too serious tone, campy dialogue, dated technology, and melodrama, but it is a fun spy series that starts off with a twisting thriller and leaps into action fodder. At least, Mission Impossible attempts to deliver a thoughtful story with some actual espionage. DePalma did a nice job in streamlining the story as the plot still works. The narrative is focused enough that you can just enjoy yourself with all this movie's memorable scenes.",1525910400,,3111,4.973076923076923
