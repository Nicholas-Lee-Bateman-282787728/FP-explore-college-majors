6697740,1,B00O1D3B9Y,"Very little Krampus, mostly about cops with a cast of very bad actors and bad script. You have to bend over backward to act this bad.  This is one of the biggest ripoffs I have ever seen.--it's truly bad, boring, and STUPID to the max.  You won't see much Krampus--just stupid cops.  It makes you wish Krampus would just kill everybody to make the bad acting end.  Do not buy this movie.  You will be sorely disappointed.",1446940800,9,421,4.415584415584416

6697742,5,B00O1D3B9Y,Picked up at my local Wally World and I enjoy these types of movies tremendously.  Don't look for a big budget film but it's not that.  I could see this turning into an underground cult classic.,1446854400,,194,4.361111111111111

6697745,1,B00O1D3B9Y,"Lets start out with the fact that the trailer Amazon has linked to this movie has nothing to do with ""Krampus The Christmas Devil."" So if you are buying this DVD because of the trailer you will be very disappointed.  In fact that trailer has nothing to do with any Krampus movie on the web site.

And giving this more than 1-star would be generous.  Just a mean, plotless amateur film that someone in the neighborhood made with his home camera.  The scene with the Swat team hunting the woods for the Krampus is just stupid.  Hey guys, I have a camera lets make a film!  Stay away from this one and save $7.95.",1446681600,10,610,4.307017543859649
6697746,1,B00O1D3B9Y,"This movie should be shown to all new filmmakers as an example of all the things they should never do.  In this day of high definition digital video, a lot of effort was put into the look of this movie.  Unfortunately, the effort was directed at making everything out of focus and adding a ton of digital grain.  I would comment on the acting except there wasn't any.  If you want a laugh you could watch the bar fight where the actors fight in slow motion.  This is not done with slow motion video, it is accomplished by having the actors move really slowly like 10 year olds trying to reenact a slow motion fight from a movie.  The biggest horror here is that this piece of garbage is stuck in my Amazon video library for all eternity!",1446595200,15,737,4.304347826086956
6697747,3,B00O1D3B9Y,"Krampus (Brad Weaver) is given a list by his brother Santa (Paul Fern) of bad kids who deserve killing. Jeremy Duffin (A.J. Leslie) was such a kid, but he got away. Now as an adult he is a police deputy and obsessed with finding the child killer. When the killings again start to happen his posse goes hunting.

This was a film that was so bad, it was good...at least in several places such as Santa berating a child; the fake heart still beating, and the young Jeremy being dragged in a sack and tossed in a frozen pond. However some of the film plot was undeveloped. What was that bar fight about? The last name on the list- seriously?

I liked the opening credits and the music during the opening and closing credits...""We Party with the Elves."" The film needed a little extra something. The cop conversation at the bar displayed some really bad acting and dialogue.

Would be okay as a Redbox rental.

6697792,1,B00O1D3B9Y,"One of the first shots in this movie is a CGI lamp post with an ultra-fake plastic-looking red bow on it.  At one point a kid is dropped in a frozen lake and then gets out and escapes looking totally dry.  Another part is a random bar fight where a bunch of cops just Negan a bunch of other guys and then cover it up because reasons? Stock is poorly cut between shaky, awkward panning shots. Weather changes with camera angles. The sound editing is terrible. Every good guy in the movie is bald. They wear black pants and vests over snow camo. The fights are atrocious. Krampus randomly molests women in gratuitous long soft core porn shots when he should be chasing his escaping victims. Oh and the daughter who is supposed to be a kid looks the same age as his wife.

The movie really is a total cash-in, no suspense or atmosphere; just a really lame cop movie masked as a horror film.

Do not watch this movie unless you love amateur college films. The beginning is a little confusing, you see a child being dragged in a sack, carried by Krampus. It is then thrown into a lake, and the child managed to get free and ran away (the date was 1983- or something). Suddenly you are seeing a man getting out of bed, no date appeared/ did not even say ""present day"", so it takes a while before you realize it's the present  day. It isn't until the bar scene when you discover that the child had been the man who woke up, who in fact was a detective-or something. ---who cares
The music does not lend itself well to the movie, the acting is college student bad, and the sound effects are blah. There is one scene where the detective gazed at a wall of missing children. The scene had noises of children, however, you can tell it's on a loop, because of one unusual sound a child makes- plays over and over again.
Krampus was not scary. on his hands he wore gloves, with black press on nails glued to them. He had hooves, but in certain scenes I could see the snow boots that the hooves were attached to.
The acting, and pacing are off. One scene the detective/man puts a gun in his mouth, but it comes out of no where, and I wasn't sure if it was due to a flash back or what? But I didn't care.
