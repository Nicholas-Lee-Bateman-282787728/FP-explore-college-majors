1083164,4,6305847118,"This video is definitely a video every Beatle/John Lennon fan should own.  I own a lot of material that Lennon has, and this video does have some new footage.  However, there is also a bit of the old footage from other videos  like (and I prefer this to Gimme Some Truth) Imagine, the 1988 documentary.  This video has some great clips of John as funny as he is.  Because anyone  who knows anything about John Lennon will realize he is a really funny guy  and many other videos choose to focus on his serious side.  This one shows  both. How he can be funny, yet also how he takes his music seriously, and  knows what he wants with his music.  I wish this video had a bit more new  footage, as well as contained more studio takes. The video is the making of  Imagine and I think that it is lacking in the sense that it doesn't show  enough of the songs being made, what they do show leaves you begging for  more.  All in all, I definitely recommend getting this video, just for some  of the unreleased stuff in it, and the footage they show of John in the  studio, however, John and Yoko filmed the entire process of making the  album, and a LOT more could have been included on this film.",958176000,9,1189,4.227678571428571
1083165,4,6305847118,"As with almost every archival Beatles-related release, this is another product that tries to straddle the line of being for the collector and the casual fan both (leaving neither really happy with the end result). Once again they have erred on the favor of the casual fan, who will not be the  one buying the majority of this release. Capitol/EMI never seem to learn  from the great bootlegs how to compile really good releases.
If you have  Imagine (the videos film), and Imagine (the documentary film), and Yoko Ono  Then and Now, and the John Lennon videos collection, then you already have  more of THIS video than you SHOULD have. The NEW stuff in this video is  GREAT! Where is the rest of it? I could have gone for way more recording  scenes, this hardly shows George playing, no King Curtis, no Badfinger.  Just enough to tease us, then back to more recycled footage. Obviously  these people filmed everything they did almost all the time, so why do we  have to keep seeing the same scenes over and over again in each (NEW?)  product. I am all for putting things in context, but the old stuff makes  the basis for this dvd, not the new stuff. Just enough is left out of each  product that you have to buy all of them, but once you have them it's  pretty redundant. Of course the casual fan is not going to care because  they will only see one of the versions, but for the rest of us this is  getting really old. They also took the cheap way out and left in all the  dust, hairs, scratches, and streaks in the video too, rather than cleaning  it up like Yellow Sub. And, unlike Yellow Sub, the 5.1 soundtrack is not  that big of a deal musically, and not that sonically different from the cd  remaster.
The extra interview is nice, since they went out of their way  to make that complete. I just wish as much thought would have gone into the  main feature. Do you need this? Yes. If it's the only Lennon video you  have, you'll probably be pretty happy, and it's much better than the videos  version Imagine. If you have all the others, you still need this because  there is just enough new to re-sell you the old again.",957225600,59,2127,4.378516624040921
1083166,5,6305847118,"A great video. It is amazing to see John actually recording the tracks that I had heard all these years. His charisma and charm come through clearly in this ""documentary"". Great footage and as you can  clearly see (and hear) a great voice. A must for any music fan.",957052800,5,265,4.408163265306122
1083167,4,6305847118,I just recieved the DVD in the mail and watched a wonderful 5.1 Dolby Digital slice of the 1971 making of Imagine. The video transfer is superb considering the source. Sound quality(5.1 DD or 2.0 Surround) is also  great. Any John Lennon fan with a DVD player needs this in their  collection. Gotta go-Watching it again-Enjoy,956534400,,325,4.785714285714286

1083169,3,6305847118,"Okay, I grew up with this guy; he was my favorite Beatle.  But this ""documentary"" has very little merit beyond the music itself.  For all the filming that they obviously did, there is not nearly enough of just  cutting the basic tracks in the studio.  Might that be because Lennon was  so tempremental and hard to get along with?  His ever-so-short temper and  repeated use of the work f@#k gets old really fast.
I am no longer young  and impressionable.  I still enjoy Lennon's music, particularly with the  Beatles.  I also still think that the Beatles were one of the true  phenomenons of our lifetime.  But I can tell you this: stripped of the  Beatle mystique, this documentary has precious little merit.  Let It Be may  have been desultory, depressing and boring in stretches, but at least it  was chronicling the demise of the most popular music group of all time.  Gimmie Some Truth does show Lennon for what he probably was at the time: an  egocentric, self-indulgent, rock star.
Music aside, I was very  disappointed with this documentary.",956016000,8,1049,4.754189944134078
1083170,5,6305847118,"Don't be fooled by reviews that you have seen this stuff before.  I have personally seen only about 5% of this footage before.  A small amount of the footage has been seen on the 1988 theatrical release of IMAGINE,  however, those parts are greatly expanded upon in this DVD.  The sound is  incredible to listen to in 5.1 surround sound especially with headphones on  as I am listening to it now.  It truly makes you feel as if you are hearing  the CD for the first time and the video only makes you appreciate the songs  even more.  The only negative portion is when Lennon seems extremely  impatient during the background vocals of OH YOKO.  His temper is soaring  and Phil Spector looks as if he would rather be somewhere else.  However  this is important to see because it shows that creating art is not an easy  task and keeping your temper intact is a tough one to master even by this  master.  If you don't have this DVD you are missing an important link into  knowing Lennon.",955411200,14,983,4.421348314606742

1083259,5,6305847118,"This is an excepectional piece of Lennon memorabilia. I was very impressed by what I saw. See and hear John at work putting the finishing touches on some of the songs that would be on the ""Imagine"" album. A special treat is John and George at work on ""How Do You Sleep"" and ""Oh My Love"" The respect between them as well as chemistry is still evident. Yoko did a superb remastering of this 'piece of history' that she was a part of. The soundtrack remixed in Dolby 5.1 surround sound is music to the ears, especially John singing ""Gimme Some Truth"" and ""Jealous Guy"" Enjoy. Turn it up.",1073606400,14,584,4.36697247706422
1083260,5,6305847118,I really loved this video. It has alot of extra rare footage that I have never seen before in other Lennon videos. I enjoyed seeing how he recorded each song. It's as if your right in the studio with him. I treasure any footage of John. I'm a huge Beatles/Lennon fan!,1060560000,12,267,4.254901960784314
1083261,5,6305847118,"First I thought carefully whether or not to get the DVD since
I already had the video, the movie ""Imagine"" on Video as well as
the film ""Imagine"" with the songs to the album, but this is
something completely different again ... plus stunning bonus
material.
First of all most of the songs are - as the title suggests -
part of the making off of the album imagine, they are rough
cuts ... at one point John Lennon complaining that the
technician has to change tape in the middle of the track.
Secondly, the sequence including George Harrison is much longer
than on the other videos and one can watch him play the electric
guitar.
Furthermore we get a very short glimpse of Jack Nicholson,
Miles Davis and Andy Warhol - all pitching up at Ascot.
The Video/DVD contains a short snap of an interview sequence ...
and that's one hell of a nice Bonus track which contains the
entire interview ... partly with a black screen due to the
change of filmreels, the tape has to be changed as well, but
during the entire filming a second tape appears to be recording
so that the interview remains completely intact.
I'd say a must for any person interested in The Beatles.

1083262,4,6305847118,"The biggest problem I had with this documentary is that it had a somewhat detached, haphazard feel, that made it difficult to follow from start to finish. Yeah, its great to see Lennon at work, cursing at the sound guy, and the bit where Yoko sings off key while trying to show one of the band how the tune to ""Oh Yoko"" goes is hilarious, but overall I felt disconnected from the whole process. For example, I got the impression that Phil Specter had a very minimal role in the making of this record, but was this really the case ? Or was his style deliberately low-key ? Hence my problem with this; I didn't get a good feel for what was really going on.
Still gets 4 stars; its a tantalizing glance into the work of one of the great artists of the 20th century, and the interview with John and Yoko is fantastic, and its worth the price for this alone. Here Lennon goes into the feelings and motivations behind some of his songs; for example, there's a brilliant and vulnerable description about the sentiments behind ""Jealous Guy"", and this is exactly the kind of thing that I was looking for in this documentary.",998006400,4,1115,4.41747572815534
1083263,5,6305847118,"it's so hard to find a better view into the life of John Lennon.  any fan will surely love this touching and poignant look at the life, love, and music he and Yoko shared.",991008000,4,171,4.029411764705882
1083264,5,6305847118,"...but you have to go pick up the Imagine album first. This DVD documents the making of the landmark 1971 album, opening with a jam session and ending with a very satisfied John Lennon listening to the finished product of the title track.
From start to finish, you'll think you're in the recording studio with John, George, Klaus, and Phil. That's how good the picture and sound is, although there understably are a few scratches in the video here and there, but the footage is superb, considering that most of it has been in the can for almost thirty years.
Watch for a snide John playing ""How Do You Sleep"" on the piano for George Harrison for the first time. That alone is worth the price of the DVD.",986515200,2,703,4.457364341085271
1083265,5,6305847118,"I was pleased to see a grammy go to ""Gimme Some Truth"". If you remember, at the 1981 grammys, John and Yoko won a grammy for ""Double Fantasy"". Good to hear the names John Lennon and Yoko Ono at a grammy awards show. Lennon's ""Imagine"" and Harrison's ""All Things Must Pass"" were the two solo Beatles LP's I played the most. ""Imagine"" (the LP) was tender and cutting, and now to see the making of the DVD documentary ""Imagine"" I better understand Lennon's mood at the time: tense and terse then suddenly tender, ready to rip apart a technician for screwing up something or other, then an ocean of gentleness. If you loved John and Yoko, as millions of us did, this takes you inside their world, behind the hype and media veils created by their music and persona. You can't hide for long when the camera's eye is following your every move. John and Yoko loved their media events, this documentary falls into that category, thirty years later. The events of December 8, 1980 give a heightened perspective to this footage. It's really interesting to see the faces of so many studio players I've only heard in passing or on LP jackets. It's interesting to see how Yoko is dismissed by many of the session players. She has to be extra assertive to make her point (it unfortunately has taken the public thirty years to catch up with this brilliant woman). As a young man John and Yoko were the only two who made any sense to me, and I treasure seeing their music and relationship on DVD. Hope there's more to come!",983836800,2,1506,4.5
1083266,5,6305847118,"John was the intelligence of it all, with the love of Paul..Combined: The Beatles... John shows us that, although he was famous, he was not embarrassed to show that he can love someone..Yoko...and though she was annoying at times...when you look at it, doesn't our spouses, boyfriends and girlfriends become annoying sometimes too?  But, he showed us how strong he was and gentle and the same time..Yes, he was Mr. Perfect.",980380800,,423,4.957746478873239
1083267,5,6305847118,"I only want to say that this gave an outsider a very special view into the  creative process that is legend. I think the world of music will forever  beholden to John Lennon for his music and insights. It was special to see  him going about daily buisness, playing around, and especially creating  music. I grew up during that period of time , so of course I've heard all  the Yoko jokes, but I think this film shows how much they were in love. I  come from a family of entertainers, so I know how passionate people can be,  I liked seeing how involved they were. Any one who has been in love can  relate to that. I must admitt, at the end you see a real smile as he  listens to the end of Imagine and it brought a tear to my eye. Wonderful  and special.",966297600,4,754,4.068027210884353

7896303,1,6305847118,I have nothing against this movie which I have seen before. It is great. This is just to let people know that when I ordered it from Movie Mars Inc. I received a South American version. You can see my images on the main page.,1291852800,,225,4.022222222222222
7896304,4,6305847118,"I really enjoyed this film, which provides a fascinating outlet into the private world of John and Yoko in 1971 during the making of one of his most famous solo albums (and which is probably tied with W&B as my second-favorite solo album of his, second only to POB).  However, it is disappointing to find out that a lot of the footage actually came from other videos which have already been released.  For people who don't know that or who haven't seen these other films yet, that's not going to be a really big or important concern, but for those who do know better, it is somewhat misleading and deceptive.  What's the point in taking a bunch of recycled footage and padding it out with some new stuff while passing it off as an entirely new product?

The video as it stands, however, is a delight to behold.  Even though I would have liked seeing a lot more footage of the making of 'Imagine,' the scenes that are there are fantastic, showing what went on behind the scenes.  We see John doing rough takes, cursing out the other musicians because they're not doing things right, playing back what he just recorded, changing parts of the songs, all of the usual things that musicians do while making an album but which their fans usually don't get to be privy to.  We also see footage of John and Yoko around their house, relaxing and having fun together, meeting with celebrity friends, and talking to fans.  John explains to one of these fans that he's just a regular guy and isn't special or a demigod just because he's a musician, that most of the time he's singing about his own life, not anyone else.  If a fan can relate his songs to one's own life, that's one thing, but it's not as though he deliberately wrote these songs because he felt the pain and life experiences of people he's never met.  The John we see here is such a multifaceted human being, more proof of why he's the person I admire most.  He could be funny, sweet, sarcastic, angry, brutally honest, gentle, tender, silly, and professional, and all of those sides of him just made him a flawed human being like any other person.

There's also an interview with John and Yoko included as a bonus feature.  They're talking about love, sex, and relationships, in a very honest and realistic way.  Although some people might not like some of their views, if one looks honestly at society and reality, there can be no denying that all of the things they say in this interview are true.  For example, celebrities using sex appeal to sell their movies or music is nothing new and has been going on for ages.  One can have love without sex and sex without love.  How high one's hemline is or what age one became sexually active at isn't something that should assume great importance when one thinks about serious issues in the world, like hunger and war.  Many times people throw up minor issues like that to deflect responsibility away from dealing with the harder things.  People might strategically cover up a picture of naked people because they don't want kids to see that, but that just sends a message that the human body and sexuality are shameful, unnatural, and disgusting, and as John said, he and all of his friends had already seen dirty pictures and heard stories about sex by the time they were eight years old anyway.  This was a really insightful interview, even though some people might be off-put by what they're saying.

All in all, I'd recommend this disc, but only if you haven't already seen the other videos that a lot of this footage was pulled from.  I agree that this does kind of straddle the fence between the casual viewer, who might not be interested in it, and the hardcore fan, who will want it regardless but be disappointed because it contains so much footage from other films.",1143763200,7,3779,4.559171597633136
7896305,3,6305847118,"Footage was great and gave good insight for the above average fan. However I was pretty angry to see the footage showing John recording ""how do you sleep?"" I wish that had been completely left out. It totally ruined my view on John, and shows him as being a very ugly person.

John himself later regretted ever recording that song, and I'm sure would have protested it being on the DVD.",1131235200,9,386,4.436619718309859
