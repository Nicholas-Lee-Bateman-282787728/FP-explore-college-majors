8736785,4,B016MU49RQ,"This is a Cecile B. DeMille production filmed on location in the South Pacific. Even though most of the movie is an arduous trek through the jungle, this is a fascinating film to watch. Essentially a drama/adventure, there is also humor and pathos in this film.  Claudette Colbert is marvelous as the timid school teacher. Shes actually the focus of this film, and the men come to appreciate her beauty more as the journey progresses. This is a movie worth watching.",1469750400,,466,4.753086419753086
