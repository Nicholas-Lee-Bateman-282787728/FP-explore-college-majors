8666837,5,B00LN8INSO,We had these programs on video tape and have watched them many times.  Trying to upgrade to DVDs we discovered that they were only available on Region 2 discs.  For us it was even worth buying a new player that would take a Region 2 disc so we could watch them again.  The picture quality is not what we expect these days - but you have to remember these were made in 1977 and include a lot of wartime footage!,1483488000,,410,4.1
8666838,4,B00LN8INSO,"As amply attested in previous reviews, a brilliant series, concise, brisk and highly informative which s/b mandatory viewing for all producers of documentaries.

In this battle of wits, the less than completely acknowledged ingenuity lies with the Germans..... except with the cracking of the Enigma, which virtually reduced all the otherwise Teutonic cleverness to near uselessness.

Episode Six of cracking Enigma is remarkable in its depiction of British ingenuity (Polish and French inputs not excluded) and in the fact that the documentary was produced only a few years after the first major public revelation of this most secret of secrets.....

The series is worth this episode alone (although US price excessive)",1472688000,,720,5.468468468468468
