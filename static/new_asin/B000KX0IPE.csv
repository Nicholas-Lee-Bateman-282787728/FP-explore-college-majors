2699125,5,B000KX0IPE,"Getting into the human equation and away from acrobatic flying daggers, director Yimou Zhang spins solid gold in his latest film, RIDING ALONE FOR THOUSANDS OF MILES.

Set against the stunningly picturesque Yunnan Province in southwestern China, Gou-ichi Takata (Ken Takakura) leaves his beloved Japanese fishing village to travel thousands of miles and finish video recording a famous Chinese folk opera for his dying son.

Mr. Takata and his son have become distant since the death of Mr. Takata's wife, not speaking to one another for years. When word comes to him that his son, Ken-ichi, is in the hospital, Mr. Takata races to the city only to be rebuffed by his son's bitterness. Mr. Takata never sees his Ken-ichi, but his son's wife, Rie (Shinobu Terajima), tells Mr. Takata an interesting story about his love of Chinese folk dancing. She hands him an unfinished tape of Ken-ichi's work and, after watching it, Mr. Takata decides to finish the recording. ""Not being good with people,"" Mr. Takata immediately encounters problems when he enters China. But he learns quickly, and finds humility within himself in order to finish the tape.

Mr. Takata knew that his son wanted to film one particular opera (also called Riding Alone For Thousands of Miles) sung by one particular Chinese man named Li. But Li is in prison after stabbing a man. Getting permission to film Li performing the folk dance from the government higher-ups becomes one of Mr. Takata's earliest obstacles. Then, after gaining access, Mr. Li has a meltdown, thinking about his own distant son. Emotional beyond repair, Mr. Li is unable to dance for Mr. Takata. So Mr. Takata leaves to come back another day ...but an idea is sparked in his head.

Mr. Takata goes to ""The Stone Village"" to see if he can convince Mr. Li's five-year-old son to come back with him to the prison so that he can visit. What follows is one of the most emotionally impacting moments in Chinese film history. Unable to be close to his own son, Mr. Takata transfers much of his emotional heft onto young Yang Yang (Mr. Li's son), and audiences will no doubt spill plenty of tears as this happens.

The beauty of the surrounding countryside in the Yunnan Province is an awesome spectacle to behold; a backdrop that towers in all its majesty.

Ken Takakura deserves Oscar mention for his quiet yet powerful (and heartbreaking) role as the conflicted and determined Mr. Takata.

All of the other actors are not actors, though. They are ordinary people picked by the director for their appearances and mannerisms; excellently done by the way. There's little doubt most will know that none of them have acting experience unless DVD watchers click on the extra features.

A brilliantly done foreign film that proves director Yimou Zhang isn't just an action freak.",1171584000,8,2808,4.8844537815126055
2699126,5,B000KX0IPE,"There are a half dozen films that can change your life after one viewing.  I felt this was such a masterpiece.  A Japanese father who has learned to control his emotions discovers that his estranged son is dying of cancer.  When he goes to the hospital room, the son won't let him stay.  Yet the wife of the son is trying to reconcile father and son and lets it be known that the son adores classical Chinese opera.

Seeking a crack in which to connect emotionally with his son,  the father then goes to China - where he does not speak the language - and seeks out a Chinese opera star so that he can film a production of ""Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles.""  Unfortunately, the opera star is now in jail, but that does not stop the father from trying to film the production in Chinese prison.  The father's desperate struggle to do one last thing to connect with his son - a true act of love - transforms all who begin to come into contact with him...and in old age, the father learns the value of openness in emotions that had been so bottled up before.

Altogether, a wonderful film experience. Truly, I was shaken emotionally.",1169078400,51,1132,4.37799043062201

My dad and I didn't and still don't have the best relationship but for this main xter to have gone all the way in actually showing care to his son, too late or vice versa, shows that he really was apologetic for causing him major pain. I actually enjoyed the fact that he showed what he didn't show, not couldn't show, to the little boy....and that everyone he depicted his story to, got involved as well.

This is film is great and if you are into this kinds of films were the story is catching, the acting is amazing and touching, I say go for it.",1318118400,,588,4.113043478260869

2699132,5,B000KX0IPE,"I almost missed this movie, saw it once at night, fell asleep and woke up totally confused and by accident, and very pleased that I got to see it again.  The story is about an elderly Japanese man, Takata, played by popular and veteran actor Ken Takakura, who has not been close with his adult married son.  And now, the son is dying in the hospital with cancer.  Takata plans a visit to the hospital and is refused by the son; he therefore, does his communicating with the son's wife.  This is a heartwarming tender story of father and son.

Through that communication, Takata learns that his son loved the Chinese masked opera and has some filming on videotape that is not complete.  Takata journeys to Yunan province in China to locate and film the masked opera singer, who is now in prison.  Left with a poor translator for the journey to China, he encounters red tape and frustration as he cannot speak Chinese.  When he finally arrives at the prison for filming, the opera singer breaks down and cannot perform; he has a son that he has not seen.  Therefore, Takata locates the child and from here, slowly and awkwardly, Takata bonds with the boy who is missed and loved by his missing father in prison.

The journey covers some beautiful and interesting landscapes in China.  The short feature on making of the film reveals that the Chinese characters are nonprofessionals.  There are some humorous scenes with the translator and touching scenes with Takata and the young boy.  Actor Ken Takakura is right for the role, deadpan, not speaking much and the facial images tie  into the lack of connection with his own son.

Zhang Yimou has left his mark on this one, the wonderful storyline, the beauty of the landscape and the choice of actors.  Zhang Yimou's most recent accomplishment is as director and creator of what is dubbed the greatest show on earth, the opening ceremonies to the Beijing Olympics 2008.

An elder man attempts, as an act of reconciliation with his dying son, a difficult mission. His task carries him to majestic areas of China where he meets majestic Chinese villagers. This is a film of natural beauty, of generous emotion, of graceful spirit, of determined love. . .

2699134,5,B000KX0IPE,"This is a truly touching movie about a father's love for his son, which he can only demonstrate vicariously from time to time.

I especially enjoyed the intermix of two Asian cultures, Japanese & Chinese.  It was intriguing listening to the translator characters moving back and forth between the two languages all the while I was reading subtitles in English.  It really enhanced the impact of differing cultures.  I also really liked the scenes of both rural coastal Japan, and rural mountainous China, places and sights we seldom have in mind here in the West when we think of these two great nations.  Of course, these aspects are personal bonuses; the real treasure is the story itself, of which much has been eloquently stated by other reviewers.  I can't recommend it enough for those who want to see inspiration and redemption that is common to humans whose culture appears so different from our own.",1236643200,,1131,5.950617283950617

The father discovers his son was a filmmaker who was in the middle of making a documentary in China about a village in Yunnan  province.  The father rushes to the village to complete the son's documentary.  A situation similar to the Japanese family's is occurring in the village, a young boy is basically left to fend for himself while his father has not acknowledged him and doesn't take care of him.  How these stories are resolved is a very touching story.  A small, well made movie by Zheng Yimou who seems to be trapped making very good but not as fulfilling martial arts movies now.

His struggle with Chinese propriety and the sad issue surrounding his goal, a Chinese opera performer say much for this story.  The one detraction, and a major one for me, is the child.

2699141,5,B000KX0IPE,"It is hard not to be moved by this beautifully shot film. A simple story where a man sets out to mend his less than ideal relationship with his own son. In order to complete his ""mission"" he is dependent on the kindness, cooperation and help of others. As he sets out to complete his son's work, he becomes transformed and winds up helping others as well as himself. Furthermore, many main players in the film wind up helping others in part due to their own discrepancies.

A simple story that is extremely multi-layered with various story lines occuring all at once, yet each one never overly emphasized. Each layer of plot is brilliantly introduced within the main plot line of man trying to reconnect with his son through his son's passion for Chinese folk opera.

In the background of all this, the film is beautifully shot. Emotions run high and low. It is next to impossible to watch this film and not be impacted at one point or another. There is ALOT going on in this film and well worth several views.  A beautiful, beautiful film.",1215129600,2,1040,4.550802139037433
2699142,4,B000KX0IPE,"Based on the director's earlier work, I was looking forward to Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles. And while I did enjoy it, I was also mildly disappointed. This film is visually very appealing, but I its central relationship between the father and the son was less than involving.

Further, the characters seem to be playing ""types"" more than real people, so I suppose I could say that as a travelogue, this is first-rate, but as an engaging drama, it's less than successful.",1212624000,,477,4.746987951807229
2699143,5,B000KX0IPE,"This is a rather emotional movie about a Japanese father who has difficulty dealing with his wife's death and estranges his son. It is obvious that he lived in a culture where emotions are bottled up. As his son lies dieing in the hospital, he can't even communicate with his daughter-in-law. It is mostly one way communication from her. He seldom speaks a word. However, in his attempt to redeem himself he involves himself with another young estranged son of a Chinese opera performer and learns a bit about himself, his son, and how fathers affect the lives of their sons. He never directly connects with his own son again before he dies, but does redeem himself with him. Afterwards, he returns to his loner existence. It is a more emotional journey for the viewer to watch than for the protagonist to project in the movie. His lack of outward emotion and dialogue are more telling than if he had been an emotional basketcase. Keep a box of tissues nearby.",1209081600,3,960,4.652941176470589

Though visually another superior effort, I personally could not tap into the story of father and son relationships.  I found the film to be extremely slow and uninteresting.  No momentum was ever reached; but for cinematography alone, ""Riding Alone"" was worth one look for me.  The scenes shot at dusk in the ""the land of Shangri-La"" are some of the best that are captured on film.  For me, though, a film about the distance and unresolved issues between father and son was not anything that I had or could relate, especially told in two languages with lots of interpretation going on.  Simply for me, not a personal favorite, but no knock against what the incomparable Yimou was trying to accomplish.  It just did not reach me.",1208304000,4,1519,7.5
2699145,4,B000KX0IPE,A sobering portrayal of how people let pride and other negative emotions put distance between them. A thought provoking tale of the good that can result in a family thats close or the pain that follows when it is not.

2699146,5,B000KX0IPE,"Set in modern-day China, this is a kind of road movie, in which a Japanese man (Ken Takakura) takes a long journey to recover a lost relationship with his dying son. True to the genre, there are many obstacles and unexpected twists and turns along the way. Meanwhile, the loneliness of the journey is reflected in the language barrier that keeps him often isolated and unsure of what is happening around him.

Director Yimou Zhang has something to say about emotions held firmly hidden behind the masks we wear and about bonding between people whose hearts finally open to one another. Tears are shed as many whose lives are touched by the journey confront the losses in their own lives. Meanwhile, the scenes of rural and mountainous China provide an epic backdrop for this simple story, and the moments of folk opera that figure into it reflect its almost operatic pace, as it unfolds slowly, lingering on moments of stillness and reflection. A fine and deeply felt film. The DVD includes a making-of short which reveals that all of the Chinese members of the cast were nonactors.",1194566400,3,1082,4.786096256684492
2699147,4,B000KX0IPE,"Sadly I rarely review the work of Zhang Yimou. It's not because I'm not interested in his work, he is one of my favorite directors. I would go as far as saying one of the best directors to emerge in the last twenty years! I've repeatedly mentioned his films as the best of their respective years of release. But I never fully know how to articulate my feelings on his work, so I often stay away from writing about it. So far I have only written reviews for ""Hero"" and ""The Road Home""(perhaps my favorite of his films).

 Most mainstream audiences I think became aware of Yimou back in 2004 when ""Hero"" and ""House of Flying Daggers"" were released. Some people unfortunately condemned the films are rip-offs of Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". Luckily, I did not and fully appreciated both films.

 To these audience members Yimou is a martial-arts director. To the rest of us, who have seen his previous films, we know him as something else. He usually makes films within a historical setting, ""Raise the Red Lantern"", ""To Live"", ""Shanghai Traid"" but they have strong emotional impact. The films are social commentaries. Other films such as ""Not One Less"", ""The Story of Qui Ju"" and ""The Road Home"" could be described as social realism. This puts off some viewers. Lots of people disliked ""The Road Home"" as they found the story too simplistic. I thought it was a masterpiece. ""Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles"" falls into this catergory. It is a deeply heartfelt story about fathers and sons, second chances, guilt and acceptance.

 All of Yimou's films have grand beauty to them. The visuals sometimes over-shadow the story. You'll find more people write about that then the plot. Check reviews for ""Curse of the Golden Flower"" or ""House of Flying Daggers"". But ""Riding Alone for Thousand of Miles"",despite some beautiful shots, centers itself primarily on its story.

 Takata (Ken Takakura) has not spoken to his son, Kenichi, for many years. Kenichi is sick, he is dying from liver cancer, as he is informed by his daughter-in-law, Rie (Shinobu Terajima). She gives him a tape Kenichi was working on while in China. In it there is an interview with a famous actor of Chinese operas, Li Jiamin (played by himself) who is known for his performace of the play ""Riding Alone for Thousand of Miles"". The actor is not prepared that day to perform the piece and be filmmed. When Takata sees this, he thinks now is his chance to do something for his son. So he goes to China in an attempt to find the actor and film it for his son.

 Finding the actor proves to be difficult as he is in prison and has been sentenced to three years. Plus the actor is also having problems with his son, like the fact he's never meet him. Here now we have a paralle between the two men, as each is on a journey to try and set things straight with their sons.

 I could imagine some would argue the film moves too slow, but I think the film's pace is fitting, giving the meditative quality of the film. The film is suppose to be slow. It is self-reflective.

 ""Riding Alone for Thousand of Miles"" is not one of Zhang Yimou's best films. I didn't find it to be as emotionally powerful as ""The Road Home"" or ""To Live"" but it has quiet moments of truth which manage to get under your skin. It's not a film to be easily forgotten.

 Bottom-line: Zhang Yimous goes back to his more social realistic films in the nature of ""The Road Home"" and ""Not One Less"". Not quite the masterpiece I was hoping it would turn out to be, but has very effective moments nonetheless.",1194134400,2,3550,4.549450549450549
2699148,5,B000KX0IPE,"Bored with the routine father-bashing from Hollywood?  Want to see a film that actually values instead of devalues fatherhood?  Had enough of the same old predictable man=bad/perpetrator woman=good/victim PC dogma?  Want to see a film where fathers are human, humane, and important to children?

If so, this is a nice change, like fresh air that would never make it through the Hollywood PC agenda filters.  It's very ironic that a Communist country allows the telling of a story that would be self-censored in most western nations.

My only complaint is that the subtitles are often the same color as the background, sometimes making them hard to read, but the acting is good enough such that you don't seem to miss much.",1192147200,7,722,4.925619834710743
2699149,2,B000KX0IPE,"""Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles"" is a tedious film.  It deals with the depressing subject of liver cancer in a depressing way.  Ken Takakura wears one basic stoic expression throughout the movie.  His character is one that bottles emotions; so Takakura bottles his performance so that it almost doesn't appear on camera.  Shinobu Terajima plays the daughter-in-law Rie.  In her few scenes, she gives a good performance as her husband lives near death and then dies.  She also performed in a film with the English title ""Until the Lights Come Back.""  Lin Qiu as the guide Lingo is humorous as a translator who can't speak Japanese very well.  Everytime he's asked to translate, he puts the translation off for later.  Jiang Wen as the first tour guide Jasmine has a paper-thin role.  Li Jiamin plays himself as the imprisoned opera singer who wants to connect with his son who he treated poorly while he was free.

The San Diego Film Critics agreed that he could by giving the film a ""Best Foreign Language Film"" award as well as Best Actor to Ken Takakura.  While the Chinese scenery was great and the feast scene in the Chinese town was interesting, most of the film is tediously long, slow and pointless.  The father starts off estranged from his son and winds up more concerned with himself and his efforts to prove his love by shooting this film project in China rather than be close at hand in Japan to help his family in their darkest hour.  It is a testament to emotional and parental failure.  Apparently many found this profound.  I can only recommend the film as an antidote for the excessively cheerful.

2699150,5,B000KX0IPE,"Director Zhang Yimou has given a masterpiece of a film in this wonderful film of a fathers reconciliation towards his dying son. ""Riding Alone For Thousands Of Miles,"" is a film I enjoyed immensely. If your looking for fast action, chase scenes or complicated plots, forget it. This is a slowed paced drama, which I found incredibly worth the watch. I loved every moment of this film. Gou-ichi Takata (Ken Takakura) has just received word from his daughter-in-law that Mr. Takata's son Kenichi, is in the hospital. Mr. Takata has been estranged from his son for many years. When he arrives at the hospital, he waits outside his sons room and learns that his son does not want to see him. We never know what had transpired between the two, other than Mr. Takata later saying in the film that he wronged his son.

When Mr. Takata is given a VHS copy of his sons work, he discovers that his son has a passion for rural Chinese folk opera. One of these he discovers on the film is titled ""Riding Alone For Thousands Of Miles."" Apparently, the singer Li Jiamin (Playing himself) does not want to give a performance to his son Kenichi, as he has a cold. Therefore, he invites Kenichi to come to Yunnan province in China, where he will perform this for him. Kenichi takes him up on his offer. However, the father Mr. Takata learns from his daughter-in law, Rie, that his sons illness is terminal: Kenichi has cancer of the liver.

Trying to make amends for his past, Mr. Takata decides to go to China, seek out Li Jiamin, and record this play for his son--since his son cannot go himself. This is where the film takes us on a great journey of self discovery. Jasmine, a Japanese translator of Chinese, informs the father that Li Jiamin has been sentenced to three years prison. Going to extreme lengths, the father vows to do what he can to video record the performance in prison. Moreover, he must get permission from various bureaucratic agencies in China. I really liked the interaction between the Chinese characters and Mr. Takata. Especially the character Lingo (Lin Qiu) whose Japanese is not really that good.

There are funny scenes with Lingo and the Chinese characters in the film who believe Lingo does not have a good grasp, if any at all, of the Japanese language. With this, Mr. Takata is always in constant cellphone contact with the translator Jasmine, who must decipher what the Chinese officials and citizenry relate to Mr. Takata. As Mr. Takata eventually is given permission to video the performance in prison, he discovers that Li Jiamin will not perform until he sees his son. A son that he too is estranged from. Their are some breath-taking scenes of China, which reminded me of Takashi Mike's film ""The Bird People Of China.""  Mr. Takata likes the way the Chinese interact with each other; sharing their joys and arguments in front of everyone--hiding nothing, and totally open. He finds this to be truly honest, and feels shame that he cannot feel the same too: But he does admire them for this.

Further, the films narrative takes the viewer on another story as well. The story of Yang Yang, the son of Li Jiamin. We see that Mr. Takata bonds with the boy, and tries to understand this young boy too. Maybe, he is reminiscing about his son when he was a child? Maybe something he failed to do as a father? Whatever the case, Mr. Takata is deeply moved by this young boy and his relationship to his father. This is a very good drama. It is not for everyone, but everyone should view it sometime in their life. It is highly recommended. I own the film, but recommend that others rent the film first, as it is a slow drama that may not resonate with others. I am biased in the fact that I really like this film a lot. Therefore, rent it first.",1190505600,8,3761,4.5576923076923075

Takata has such a profound inability to communicate with his son that he uses his daughter-in-law as a de-facto ""interpreter"" between himself and his child. During these ""interpretations"", Takata discovers that his son had promised to film a Chinese opera singer playing his most famous role.  As an attempt at reconciliation, Takata goes to China to finish this task for his son, who is dying of cancer.  In going to China, Takata seems to face an insurmountable obstacle:  a foreign country where a different language is spoken.  However, in a clever twist, this obstacle actually turns out to be an advantage for Takata, because he is used to dealing in an environment where he is unable to converse with others.  Takata uses the skills he's developed to compensate for his communication deficiencies in order to find the person his son wished to film.  When that person displays some relationship challenges with his own son, Takata takes it on himself to establish a connection between the opera singer and his child.  In doing so, Takata finally establishes a bridge between himself and his own son.

While the story itself is intriguing, it wouldn't work without amazing acting from all the cast (particularly Ken Takakura as Takata), stunning cinematography, and a lyrical script.  All of these elements are present in Zhang's other films, like Hero and Curse of the Golden Flower.  It's a clear measure of Zhang's talent that he is able to abandon the historic epic form of those other movies and instead utilize these elements to create an intimate, emotional portrait.

Some viewers may be reluctant to view Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles because all of the dialogue is in Chinese.  However, the movie (like its protagonist) transcends language to movingly convey its core emotions.  It's rare to find a moving portrayal of such basic emotions in any language, much less a portrayal that is also entertaining.  For that reason alone, Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles is a film that deserves a large audience.",1189209600,25,2208,4.959239130434782
2699152,5,B000KX0IPE,"Although renowned Fifth Generation director Zhang Yimou has recently demonstrated strong predilections for stunningly florid and large scale martial arts epics, his recent RIDING ALONE FOR THOUSANDS OF MILES returns him to the humbler type of cinematic canvas he employed earlier in NOT ONE LESS, JU DOU, THE ROAD HOME, and THE STORY OF QIU JU. Here he returns to the simple story of a small group of individuals. There's the father, Takata Gouichi, estranged from his son Kenichi, the son Kenichi afflicted with liver cancer, the daughter-in-law Rie trying to mend fences before it's too late, and a Chinese mask opera performer Li Jiamin, differently but equally estranged from his son Yang Yang by having been sentenced to three years in prison for a moment's rage in defending his infant son. Orbiting this central constellation are the tour guide Jasmine, the sincere but inept translator Lingo, a provincial politician named Director Li, a prison warden Chen, the chief of Li Jiamin's home village, and a small cast of rural villagers who create a welcoming atmosphere for Mr. Takata as well as being the proverbial village that it takes to raise Yang Yang in his father's absence.

On its face, the title RIDING ALONE FOR THOUSANDS OF MILES refers to a regional mask opera for which Li Jiamin claims he is the country's greatest performer. On an earlier visit to China before his illness, Mr. Takata's son Kenichi had visited Yunnan Province and filmed Mr. Li performing a different opera. Kenichi is not only a Chinese opera aficionado, he is also a documentarian for Japanese television. Kenichi would like to film Li performing the Lord Guan character in Riding Alone, but Kenichi cannot stay any longer and Li is not feeling well enough. Kenichi promises to return the following year, but his illness renders him hospitalized. It is his father, Mr. Takata, who decides to film the opera and return with the tape to Japan, an act of reconciliation and perhaps the granting of his dying son's final wish. A series of bureaucratic trials, coupled with the realization of Li Jiamin's relationship with his five-year-old son and his own unexpected bonding with the little boy, leads the elder Takata finally to see the truth in his own father-son relationship.

At another level, RIDING ALONE FOR THOUSANDS OF MILES echoes the themes of Lord Guan's epic story as told in the classic Chinese novel, ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS. Lord Guan was a famous and heroic general during a time when China was not yet united as a single country - he is perceived in Chinese legend as a paragon of loyalty to his sworn brothers and a model of righteousness. The ""Riding Alone"" title refers to a story within ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS wherein Lord Guan undergoes numerous hardships and trials over a long journey to reach his sworn brother Liu Bei. The parallels with Mr. Takata's journey to Yunnan Province to film Li Jiamin are obvious if rather less bloody and militaristic.

In this movie, Zhang Yimou returns to his previous method in NOT ONE LESS of choosing for major roles local people who are not career actors. Remarkably, he preserves their authenticity while still managing to derive compelling performances from them. As he did with the master of the house in RAISE THE RED LANTERN, Mr. Zhang also returns to the device of never once showing one of his main characters - Kenichi in this case. The effect is powerful - we as viewers do not know the adult Kenichi any better than his father.

While the sweep of this story is far reduced in comparison to HERO and CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER, make no mistake about Mr. Zhang's cinematic touch. In place of hordes of attacking soldiers and sky-darkening waves of arrows, Mr. Zhang uses the visual grandeur of the Yunnan Province countryside to achieve his dramatic effects. And, as usual, Mr. Zhang demonstrates once again that he is without doubt the modern cinema's unsurpassed master of light and color.

For the first time, Mr. Zhang reaches out from his natural Chinese environs to include a Japanese perspective. Through the character of Mr. Takata, Director Zhang offers his perspective on Japanese culture while simultaneously viewing Chinese culture and life through perhaps overly sympathetic Japanese eyes. There is certainly room to be critical of Mr. Zhang's soft-pedaled portrayal of the Chinese prison system and the improbably cooperative cadres, as well as his romanticized depiction - bordering on Party propoganda - of rural country life and the peasants who live there. Nevertheless, he shows once again that he is a master craftsman and a true artist in painting large, life affirming tales on the smallest of canvases. Those looking for an epic or martial arts extravaganza should look elsewhere, but those who relish universal stories and themes drawn from the tribulations of a few average lives will find joy in RIDING ALONE FOR THOUSANDS OF MILES. One scene in the prison will surely draw tears from even the hardest of viewer hearts, just as it did from the prisoners in the scene itself.",1182211200,8,5072,4.920560747663552
2699153,5,B000KX0IPE,"Zhang Yimou once again shows us his background as a cinematographer.  He uses muted colors for the scenes in Japan where the characters, except the son's wife (a very promising up-and-coming actress in Japan, full of emotive capabilities), have bottled up emotions.  Then uses bright, saturated colors (infrequently overexposed) in China when the father is learning about showing emotions and showing emotion.

When traveling in China you hear about all of the freedom Mr. Zhang has to do whatever project nowadays as he is praised on CTV regularly, but it is still amazing that he was allowed to do so much in a prison.

Once again as in ""Not One Less"" he has shown that he gets to the heart of the story better without using an expensive cast of professional actors with big names.  I think this saves him having to battle with professional actors about the acting craft that they ""know so much about"" and the roles come off the way he wants them to.

I think Mr. Takakura (a tried and true Japanese actor) did an excellent job as a foreigner in China and the film depicted realistically the difficulties of being a foreigner traveling in China.  That is once again to the lattitude that Mr. Zhang is allowed currently and I want to thank him for his honesty because most Chinese do not recognize the difficulties of being a foreigner in China.  Chinese people want to be good hosts but they also do not feel they should go beyond the status quo due to societal traditions.

It is Chinese tradition that there is heroic death and heroic recognition that moves others to become better.  That is what has made their tradition of literature and film so rewarding in that one comes away with a feeling of improving one's self by completing the story and wanting to become better.",1178928000,12,1777,4.666666666666667
2699154,5,B000KX0IPE,"After a solid start with a remarkable series of films in the early 1990's, Zhang Yimou has lately become something like the Martin Scorsese of Chinese cinema.  For every character-rich, personal film he makes--the kind of film that made him a household name--he now mounts two or three big, action-packed epics tailored for maximum commercial success.  Happily, RIDING ALONE FOR THOUSANDS OF MILES, is of the former variety.

Ken Takakura is a quiet force of nature as he struggles to take unexpected and often inscrutable steps to atone for unnamed offenses against his estranged son, now dying of liver cancer.  This leads him on a quixotic journey to remote parts of China.  His character, Takata, attempts to videotape a masked performance that is missing from his son's cherished collection of Chinese folk operas.  The plot, simplified, is this:  ""one thing leads to another . . . .""  In other words, this is a road movie, purely but not ever simply.

It is a melancholy film, but one with moments of deep comic relief.  Takata is left to the devices of a tour guide and ""translator,"" Lingo, whose broken Japanese is so mixed up with his broken English as to make him virtually useless.  When language barriers arise (as they constantly do), Takata must phone his original translator, Jasmine, who had to bow out when the quest ran into obstacles.  At one point, Takata and Lingo find themselves in a remote village, where they have encountered an apparent impasse with the village elders.  When Lingo is unable to translate the villagers' wishes to Takata, there is a hilarious parade of the entire party, up the steps of the terraced village to the highest rooftop--the only place in town where there is a cell phone signal.

This kind of story, where the narrative walks a razor's edge between sentimentality and earned emotion, requires a sure hand at camera placement.  In this respect, Zhang, who started out as a cinematographer under Chen Kaige, is one of the most assured directors alive.  His close-ups occur mainly on Takakura, whose face is all restrained pain.  With the exception of two (related) scenes of explosive emotion, the camera tends to move away and give the characters--and audience--a respectful distance.

This Sony Pictures DVD boasts an ultra-crisp image to complement the perfectly executed photography.  Set mostly in Yunnan Province, with its rolling green moon-scapes and forests of vertical rock formations, RIDING ALONE might have been a series of postcards in the hands of another director.  But unlike the candy-colored cinematography of Zhang's most recent three action epics, the reds, greens, and browns that make up almost the entire color palette are muted with just enough gray to keep one's attention on the characters, not the backdrop.

Like Zhang's film NOT ONE LESS (1999), this is a story of an insular character who thrusts himself out into the wide world and finds that values follow actions.  Takata, a near-recluse at the start, finds faith, friendship, compassion and forgiveness in his journey.  It is a rare privilege to take that journey with him.",1172275200,15,3110,5.007782101167315
2699155,5,B000KX0IPE,"'Qian li zou dan qi' ('Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles') is a little miracle of a film by the gifted Chinese director Yimou Zhang, an artist highly respected for his films of passion and martial arts captured in richly symbolic fashion and spectacular color.  But in this film the director joins in writing a story with Jingzhi Zou that is as intimate as his other films are operatic.  It is a simple, touching story told in manner that maintains Zhang's visual artistry yet goes so far beyond the glorious color to probe universal questions.

Gou-ichi Takata (Ken Takakura) lives by himself in a fishing village since the death of his wife.  Apparently he was so devastated by her passing that he left his son Ken-ichi to grow up by himself, an act that Ken-ichi has never forgiven: the two men have had no contact in many years.  Takata receives a telephone call from his daughter-in-law Rie (Shinobu Terajima) informing him that Ken-ichi is hospitalized with a grave illness and pleads with Takata to come visit his estranged son.  Takata complies, but on arrival at the hospital his son refuses to see him.  Rie shares a videotape Ken-ichi made about his obsession with Chinese folk opera, and when Takata plays the tape he sees that his son's burning desire to tape a performance by Chinese singer Li Jiamin (who plays himself) singing the greatest of his roles - an opera names 'Riding Alone for a Thousand Miles' - was thwarted by the singer's illness at the time, Takata decides to reconcile his paternal distance and travel to Yunnan Province of China to complete his son's tape and vision.

Upon arrival in China Takata discovers that the singer is in jail and he obtains the translator services of Lingo (Lin Qiu) and Jasmine (Jiang Wen) who ultimately help him to overcome the endless red tape to gain an audience with the singer in his jail. Though Li wants to sing his famous role of Takata to film for his son, Li requests that first he be able to see his illegitimate son Yang Yang (Zhenbo Yang) who has been adopted by a little village called Stone Flower.  Takata, with the aid of his translators, visits Stone Flower and the people there greet Takata with warmth and give their consent to allow Yang Yang to accompany Takata to see the father he has never met.  But on the road out of China Yang Yang  strays and Takata and Yang Yang spend a night in the frightening depths of a canyon: they bond with complex shared needs until they are rescued the next morning.  Though Yang Yang has developed a love for Takata he doesn't want to leave his village and Takata departs back to the prison alone to tell Li.  At the prison Takata shares with Li and his fellow inmates photographs of Yang Yang: everyone is so moved that Li performs the opera for Takata's son on videotape as a gesture of love.

Takata has accomplished his mission of reconciliation with his own son, but Rie calls him to inform him that Ken-ichi has died but left a letter addressed to Takata that explains how deeply moved the son is that his father would make the journey to China, riding alone for thousands of miles out of love. The gesture is enough for Ken-ichi.

Zhang tells his story in both Mandarin and Japanese and the translations reflect the differences on the two countries but also represent bridges between the ancient and the modern, between cold interior calloused heart and the warmth of love.  The filming and accompanying musical score are as always in Zhang's films beautiful beyond description.  This is a film to cherish, one that is so understated in its approach to father-son relationships that it will touch chords of recognition in every viewer.  Highly recommended.

2699156,2,B000KX0IPE,"I do like cinematic journeys to exotic places and new experiences. So imagine my disappointment to find that the title of the movie was merely referring to a particular Chinese opera.

But there is a journey here. However, only from blue-tinted Japan to villages in warmly colorful Yunnan Province in China. (This a message film but I don't know if the color pallette is part of it.)

As for the message...Aging Japanese icon Ken Takakura wears one facial expression thru out the movie. It was his character's mask. And his character finds himself in China to record his dying son's obsession, a Chinese 'Masked' Opera. Get it? And he's been 'riding alone' since his estrangement from his son. Get it? And the opera singer the old man sought out has his own young son that he hasn't seen and wants to. Get it? So much for subtlety.

In a daring move, Zhang Yimou used non-actors in many of these roles. For this sub-title reader, that daringness worked. Other unique elements, however, didn't work. In fact, they were unwelcome.

I've always wanted to see the difficulties of a foreigner in a land without translators (or inadequate ones) presented realistically. But, now I see why this isn't done very often. With a few exceptions, this proved very difficult to pull off without dragging down the drama.

I've often wondered how long before we see some of the more hidden aspects of life brought to the screen. Zhang Yimou is daring. So we now have a scene with a cascade of snot falling from a crying man's nose, and a scene with a child squatting to genuinely relieve himself. Now I know why those scene aren't done more often.

Without Gong Li or Zhang Ziyi, I've found Zhang Yimou movies to be almost repugnant. Borrowing from Ayn Rand: his ""sense of life"" as epitomized by his movies is fatalistic and bitter and ugly despite the beauty of his visuals.

I like gentle, naturalistic experiences. But not when, in total, they depress me. This movie was, for me, a thousand screenshots of downer.",1171756800,8,2000,4.713467048710601

8159552,5,B000KX0IPE,"I read the news that the Japanese actor died 1 or 2 years ago, he was very popular in China actually, but only among people of my father's age. So I decided to watch this again. 9 years ago when I first went to a theatre to watch this movie, I was a teenager, didn't quite understand the complicated relationship and emotional barrier. Me and my father are also having this kind of issue since my parents divorced, I usually met with my father at most once per year when I was still living in my hometown, now it's been 3 years w/o seeing my father since I came to America. As I remember, my father was kind of like the character in the movie, who never lets his emotions go, and so do I. I am not sure how our relationship would end up like after several years. I always feel isolated growing up in a single-parent family, and I like the way it feels. Now I feel even more isolated because people around me are just drastically different from me, different culture/race/language. The difference between the west and east is just phenomenal, I'm alone by myself hanging around for most of the time.

Secondly, I really like the roads, mountains and landscapes in this movie, it reminds me so much of my hometown, which is very close to this part of China. East Asia isn't just about big cities like Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Shanghai, there's a lot more than we usually envision. By the way, foreigners might not be able to tell that, it is not mandarin that they're speaking in this movie, I like the way that filmmakers preserved the local dialect. I speak the same language as they do, but even other mandarin speakers might need captions to understand.

Rating = ***
Director:  Yimou Zhang
DVD
2005

Film = three (3) stars; production values = 4.5 stars; subtitles/translations  = five (5) stars.  Action Director Yimou Zhang takes his hand off the throttle to deliver a change of pace drama with essentially two stars:  a small Chinese boy and the spectacular scenery of (then) remote Southwestern China.  He conjures up an interesting tale, but it is far from an audience magnet.  The photoplay probably looked better in preproduction (script, storyboards, casting, etc.) than it does on screen.  This may be due to prosaic, by-the-book editing; but it seems mostly the result of lethargic acting by professional actors/actresses (the rural-area nonpros out perform the pros in the majority of scenes).  Nicely captured and delineated by the Director are the different levels of behavior from business dictates to cultural conditioning to the real feelings of Japanese and Chinese as individuals (perhaps you have encountered these dichotomies in your travels).
Cinematography (wide screen, color) and scene lighting are excellent.  So is set design.  Score is fine, but the surround sound field is not there yet.  Subtitles/translations are a pure pleasure to behold.  Not only are near simultaneous line readings in Japanese and Mandarin translated well, but the name of every film contributor listed in the opening and closing credits is translated into English from Japanese or Mandarin (even those with English-lettered names are translated into Mandarin!).  Rarely (make that just about never for Japanese films) is credit given where it is due in movie translations.  Worth watching, but only about once.
