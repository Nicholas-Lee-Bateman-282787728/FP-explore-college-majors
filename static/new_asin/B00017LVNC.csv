1975770,5,B00017LVNC,"THE KID: (1921), is my first Charlie Chaplin silent film I watched in a film class. At first I said to myself, ""Why are we watching an old film with no sound???"" So I had no choice but to watch it for a grade. At first I did not understand the way it works. moving forward into the film, I started to realize what the story was trying to say. It's about a Kid (Jackie Coogan) who was abandoned by his only mother (Edna Purviance) when he was a baby because she could not provide child care. The Tramp (Charles Chaplin) how ever adopted the child with care. It is a really great movie! it's short, but it's really good!!! it even has the correct score of music to it as well!

(If you are a Chaplin fan, you would not want to miss this timeless classic film!)",1501804800,,758,4.121621621621622

1975774,5,B00017LVNC,This movie is a well thought out masterpiece.  Chaplin is in his heyday tramping it up with a kid who gives one of the great performances as a child actor.

1975788,5,B00017LVNC,"This kid is great!  Its an amazing piece of history to watch this pioneering film.  Cute and poignant.  I guess everyone was poor and cops actually walked a beat.  But this is Chaplin's Tramp and the genesis of how a British actor became such an American icon ..Its the story about a woman who gives up her child because you known, she threw down.. and was unmarried.. and someone got some and split.. but thankfully she had the kid... and gives it away.. and instantly regrets it.. but Chaplin finds him and raises him for about 5 years.. before the happy ending that comes... There's the comedy of the time and slapstick.. and silliness..and sadness...  makes you think about all those souls that are forever immortalized here... Such a joy to discover this with my subscdription... thanks to Amazon leadership from Ted Hope to include this.. I think only Amazon cares about these type of historic films... and that's whey coupled together, they're both great.",1481328000,3,962,4.806060606060606

1975791,5,B00017LVNC,"Well, this is a film that, as a big fan of Chaplin, I didn't see until until last night via the Criterion release on Blu Ray. It was this release that prompted me to purchase it. The film itself is very fine work. It's funny, it's touching, and it fleshes out character, particularly with The Tramp and The Kid character. It certainly shows the sophistication that he would later use in The Goldrush. Furthermore, Jackie Coogan's performance is terrific, showing a surprising bit of nuance for a youngster. And when Chaplin and Coogan are on the screen together, the storytelling is so good that I rarely thought about that this film was from 1921.

Some consider The Kid to be his first full length masterpiece, with a caveat. The version included here is the 1972 re-release re-edited by Charles Chaplin himself to focus the story more on The Tramp and The Kid. Apparently, the original 6-reeler covered more of the what led Edna Perviance's character, the boy's mother, to abandon the child. Chaplin later felt that this was unimportant. The 1972 release also includes the musical soundtrack which Chaplin wrote himself. The music is good and appropriate, and the sound quality is great.

Where this edition really earns the 5 stars, in addition to the film itself, is the print. In most parts, it looks as fresh as it probably did when it first came out. I'm so used to seeing films with evidence of wear, tear, loss of emulsion, poor quality print source material, etc. It looks so good, it's a bit startling.

I am still going through the extras, but as usual with most Criterion releases, there is a plethora of extras. Here there are interviews or cuts of interviews with Jackie Coogan, Rollie Totheroh (Chaplin's main cameraman), and more. There is also an interesting short on the intentional use of undercranking for effect. Also among the short extras is a feature on Jackie Coogan's history in film and TV.

Highly recommended.",1479686400,,1940,4.799401197604791

1975827,5,B00017LVNC,"Sentimental but not mawkish, this film pretty much finished Chaplin's reliance on short films and paved the way for his features. Although he continued to release shorter films, he was no longer interested in the briefer format and was soon to begin making his masterpieces such as THE GOLD RUSH and MODERN TIMES. THE KID also began the career of Jackie Coogan, the first major child star and later in life the iconic Uncle Fester of THE ADDAMS FAMILY. A minor masterpiece all on its own, THE KID has been fully restored in the release Chaplin edited for release in the Sixties, complete with score.

1975829,5,B00017LVNC,"If you're looking at the Criterion edition here, I assume you are already a Chaplin fan, so I won't review the film. Let me tell you, this dvd is worth it. It has a clear transfer of the newly-restored film, a booklet with an essay on the film and Chaplin (not as good as the essays I've read in some of the other Criterion editions of Chaplin films, but still worth it), and a few other extras that make this edition vastly superior to every other dvd of The Kid I have seen. Of these extras, the highlights for me were a video essay on Jackie Coogan's life, and an explanation of undercranking techniques and how they were utilized by comics such as Chaplin as well as action stars such as Fairbanks. I tell you, I've read about undercranking a million times, but silent film historian Robert Model's breakdown of the process as well as showing clips at the real-life speeds compared to cranking speeds and projecting speeds really made it come to life. You will have a new appreciation for the innovative silent film directors. This feature alone makes the dvd worth a buy for film buffs.",1458432000,7,1091,4.515151515151516

1975832,5,B00017LVNC,"When I was a teen, I bought many Super 8mm movies.  The same basement home theater I built last year, was also a home theater as a child.  I had a sound projector with a fold-up screen.  Friends would come over weekly to watch the films I purchased.

At that time, I was purchasing from Blackhawk Films.  They mainly sold silent classics starring the likes of Laurel and Hardy, Harold Lloyd, Buster Keaton and Charles Chaplin.

Chaplin was never my favorite.  I never bought nor watched any of his films.  There was something about his ""Tramp"" character that just didn't translate as funny for me.  I would much rather watch comedies from the other comedians.

Watching THE KID for the very first time was quite a discovery for me.  While I didn't find the film overly funny, what did amaze me was Chaplin's comic craft.  You could see that instead of simple slapstick, he invented funny situations --- such as when we see a baby sipping milk from a tea kettle.

Obviously, THE KID is a masterpiece in silent cinema.  Along with a beautiful score composed by Chaplin (which I have been humming around the house all morning), it's such a touching film to watch.

The film has gone through a meticulous 4k restoration.  Having watched many silents from this era over my life, it's just astounding to see how crisply detailed the 1080p image looks.  All the scratches and blemishes have been removed.  If I can use a clich, it looks as if it was lensed yesterday.  The transfer has to been to be appreciated.

Really enjoyed this film and highly recommend its purchase from Criterion",1456617600,4,1580,4.635379061371841

It captures the look, feel, and hilarity of his short films while it has the human power and timeless quality of his best features. The story is of Charlie Chaplin's tramp character, by fate, raising an abandoned child and their various misadventures  together remains one of his best, iconic, and most touching films. It's a classic of silent cinema period. My next point is the Criterion blu ray, and wow! It makes The Kid look like it was shot last year how clean and vivid  in detail it looks. I'm not kidding, it looks clear and sharp and perfectly restored. Exceptional greyscale and free of the annoyance of ghosting effect that mars silent films on disk.

1975840,5,B00017LVNC,"The Kid,"" released in 1921, was Charlie Chaplins first feature-length film. Chaplin had been making successful one- and two-reelers since 1914, and there were doubts that a comedy could sustain more than an hour. Chaplin wisely combined comedy and pathos.

An unmarried woman (Edna Purviance) abandons her newborn son in the back of a fancy car with a note pleading for the cars wealthy owner to raise her socially doomed baby. But the car is stolen and the baby left on the street, where it is found by Chaplins happy-go-lucky tramp. The tramp rescues the baby, names him John and, five years later, has made the boy his partner in crime. John (Jackie Coogan) breaks windows that Chaplins glass repairman is soon hired to replace. The boys mother, meanwhile, has become a successful actress and is eager to locate and claim him as her own.

Chaplin found Coogan working in vaudeville. Four years old during the making of The Kid, Coogan displayed amazing natural talent and the ability to pull strongly at viewers heartstrings. The chemistry between Chaplin and Coogan is apparent in every scene, with both actors responding naturally and instinctively to one another. Years later, Coogan would play Uncle Fester on TVs The Addams Family.

The Kid showed the world that Chaplin was a serious filmmaker as well as an international comedy star. He starred in and directed the movie, becoming an auteur long before the word became fashionable. The digital restoration of Chaplins 1972 release version features an original score by Chaplin.

Bonus extras on the Blu-ray release include new audio commentary by Chaplin historian Charles Maland; the video essay Jackie Coogan: The First Child Star; interviews with Coogan and actress Lita Grey Chaplin; excerpted audio interviews with cinematographer Rolle Totheroh and film distributor Mo Rothman; deleted scenes; footage of Chaplin conducting his score for The Kid; Nice and Friendly, a 1922 short featuring Chaplin and Coogan; and a critical essay.",1455321600,8,1996,5.151234567901234

No other film by Chaplin equals the portayal of love between a lively, endearing child and his adoptive father, battling through  the odds of a society pitted against them.  The dream sequence near the end of the film reiterates Chaplin's motif of and overarching Providence.  Though we may spoil paradise, and abandon the most precious things in our society, those who seek truth and love will triumph if they persist - and pray.
  The early montage sequence that parallels the poor mother's burden with Jesus' burden at Calvary strikes a chord that key imagery echoes throughout the film.",1453680000,8,684,5.008849557522124

Chaplins 1972 cut removes some of the unneeded sentimentality and focuses more on the relationship between Chaplin and the Kid. If you watch the deleted scenes on the Blu-ray you can see what was deleted and decide for yourself, but I prefer the 1972 version.

The 52 minute cut of the film is currently the only version of the film that the Chaplin estate will allow to circulate.

1975855,5,B00017LVNC,"Great movie.  Although every time I see it, I think of Charlie Chaplin's autobiography.  Supposedly, he met the 9-year-old chess genius Sammy Reshevsky during a 1921 Hollywood simultaneous exhibition (where the chess master plays many people at once) the youngster was giving.  Charlie brought little Sammy to the set of The Kid to show him around.  Somehow, Sammy was snooty toward the Kid, Jackie Coogan, and received a black eye for his snobbish behavior.  It's my favorite Chaplin movie!",1449014400,,491,5.1645569620253164

1975860,3,B00017LVNC,"I ADORE THIS MOVIE! Jackie Coogan stole my heart forever as did Charlie Chaplin! Precious! The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 5 stars is because I find the music(which obviously isn't the original intended sound) pretentious for the film; it completely flattens all of the comical scenes. But now I read that Chaplin prepared this ""score""?..Really? Hmmm...I find that hard to believe...the music I'm hearing while watching this on ""Prime"" videos is ruining this ""silent film"".
  You can watch this silent movie on Youtube for FREE with the intended musical score...SO much BETTER than this inappropriate symphonic sound! You can't have sad serious music when Charlie is checking to see if he's holding a little boy or girl!",1447027200,,737,5.032786885245901

1975919,5,B00017LVNC,"I know some people would not see comedy films in the way the heading describes this movie, but Chaplin did such a great job with this film (as he did with many films). He was wise to restore the picture quality and redo the musical scores of his films before he died; the quality is amazing because he did his own restorations, and then digital technology came along and made them that much better.

This film is about a vagrant (Chaplin) who finds an abandoned baby and takes him in and cares for him the best way he can. Unfortunately, when he becomes a small child (Jackie Coogan), an orphanage intervenes and separates the two. Comedy, drama, happiness, tragedy, laughter and tears are all of the things that sum up this story. It's a shame that the MK2 collections of Chaplin's films are now out of print and the remainder of them are expensively priced.

1975944,5,B00017LVNC,"The Kid (1921) was Charlie Chaplin`s first and most autobiographical feature film. Produced for First National, it fulfilled his ambition to move beyond shorts. Critics immediately hailed it as a masterpiece, but its reputation has since suffered due to its many flaws. Of course, no work of art is flawless and the film's status remains intact. It is, in many ways, a synthesis of Chaplin's previous work and the work which followed. Chaplin began filming shortly after losing his infant son with first child bride, Mildred Harris. The Kid is, in part, a fantasy about what might have been, which Chaplin wedded to his own bitter childhood memories. The film was also a blueprint for Chaplin's work process. He took his time filming, much to the chagrin of the studio, who applied considerable pressure on him to speed up the process.

It opens with Edna Purviance as a (single) woman ""whose sin was motherhood."" Chaplin, who was himself illegitimate, edits the image of the suffering woman with a shot of Christ carrying the cross. This is visual storytelling, of course, so Chaplin's not done with the manipulation yet. Our Scarlet Letter-styled heroine sees a couple coming out of a church. The bride, looking shell shocked, is all of about 16 years old. She drops a withered flower, symbolizing her loss of virginity. Her groom emerges, a white-bearded man who is at least 70. The minister and congregation bless the wedding. Edna, empathizing with the bride from afar, is accentuated with a halo round her head as she holds her bastard son. Within a few seconds, Chaplin takes his big swipe at hypocritical American piety, puritanism, and organized religion.

Edna sees an open limousine, darts in through its door (a device he reworked in 1931s City Lights) and dumps her shame in the back seat, with a letter: ""please love and care for this orphan child.""

Now Chaplin has fun. Two robbers steal the car, find the squalling brat in the back seat, duck into an alley and dump him in a nearby trashcan. Cue the Tramp. He finds the bundle of joy and does everything imaginable to dispatch of it, including contemplating throwing the infant into a street grating. This vignette is, often, hilariously cold-blooded. Finally, the Tramp accepts his fate and unofficially adopts the Kid, christening him ""John."" The Tramp ingeniously turns a tea pot into a milk bottle and, with a pair of scissors, transforms an ordinary chair into a potty training seat. Meanwhile, the grief-stricken Edna has seen the error of her ways and will, henceforth, lead a life of charity.

Five years later, the infant is Jackie Coogan: the first and probably greatest child star actor in cinema history. The Kid is dressed in oversized clothes, a reflection of the Tramp. Daddy  Tramp is teaching junior Tramp the fine art of swindling, which puts them under the radar of resident cop Tom Wilson. High octane slapstick follows.

Loss of mother, poverty, fear of the orphanage, and surreal amorous escapades are all movements in Chaplin's opus. The Tramps do get plenty of pancakes to eat with the money they swipe from gullible patrons. Little doubt this is fantasy from Chaplin's own destitute, half-starved London childhood.

John's fight with a bully neighborhood kid leads to a further fight between the bully's brother (Charles Reisner, in shoulder pads) and the Tramp. Edna, now a worldwide star (!) arrives to preach the gospel of turning the other cheek. Good news for Charlie that the bully listens, and the second that said bully gets soft, Charlie takes full advantage with a brick in his hand.

When the Kid gets sick, a visiting doctor discovers Edna's old letter and contacts the authorities. Orphan Control soon arrives and kinetic slapstick is masterfully blended with pathos. Coogan's acting is simply stunning. Only an ice cube would remain unaffected.

The Tramp flees to a flophouse and, again, the cruelty of poverty blended with inventive slapstick is nearly seamless. What follows has long been a source of controversy: the Heaven dream sequence. Having lost his child, the Tramp dreams of heaven. The Tramp gets his wings and, it turns out, heaven's not that different from the earthly realm. Temptation arrives in the form of 12-year old Lita Grey, whom Chaplin would marry and bitterly divorce in real life (Grey was the source of inspiration for Vladimir Nabakov's ""Lolita""). Jealousy leads to a brawl and celestial murder. To some, it is an ill-fitting surreal sequence. Yet, it is an aesthetically potent bridge to the finale, which is, thankfully, a happy one.

The Kid is, indeed, awash in mawkish sentiment. However, fused with the fierceness of street survival, apathetic institution, and surrealistic hope, The Kid is a landmark in film as visual storytelling.",1358985600,,4774,4.9937106918239

1975949,5,B00017LVNC,"The Kid is one of Charles Chaplin's best films ever. Although it runs less than an hour long, the story is most memorable as it packs in many laughs, a few tears (I admit I shed some) and a spectacular dream sequence that must have amazed audiences at the time. When they say Chaplin worked long and hard to make this film I fully believe them! Everything is so well done; and the acting couldn't have been any better. I liked the sets; the costumes; the musical score and the casting was well done, too. In addition, the second DVD contains numerous wonderful bonus features that I really enjoyed.

When the story begins, we meet an unwed mother (Edna Purviance) who has given birth to a baby boy at a charity hospital. She is quite despondent and hopeless about their future so she pins an anonymous note to her baby's blanket asking anyone who finds the baby to care for it as if it were their own. She then places the baby in the back seat of a fancy limousine and goes off to ponder what sort of life she could lead--if any.

But of course much more happens. The limousine is stolen by two thugs and when they discover the baby inside they put it out with the trash! It isn't long before The Little Tramp (Charlie Chaplin) discovers the baby; he tries to give it to someone who can care for it with some rather funny unexpected situations. Eventually the tramp reads the note tied to the baby's blanket and decides that despite his living in abject poverty he will care for the baby, name him John and raise John as if he were the baby's real father.

Five years pass; we see just how fond the tramp and John are of each other. The tramp takes good care of the boy and they share meals and even the cooking responsibilities; we also see how they eke out a living on the streets. But when John gets very sick and the doctor discovers that the tramp is not the boy's real father, trouble ensues when the doctor notifies the county orphanage. Look for an incredible sequence in which the boy is taken from the tramp as the tramp tries to get him back; it's hard not to shed a tear when seeing the little boy crying and screaming to be reunited with the man who raised him.

And there's more. The boy's mother, who did not kill herself, has become a famous entertainer and she discovers that John is indeed the boy she gave away five years prior. Now the relationship between the tramp and the boy is threatened by the mother who wants John back; a greedy man who wants a $1,000 reward for bringing the baby to the mother and the county orphanage who is still after the boy.

The 2nd DVD has so many extras and they're all excellent. I particularly liked the eye-opening and informative documentary ""Chaplin Today"" by Alain Bergala; ""How to Make Movies"" from 1918 where we see Chaplin building his studio; the color footage from 1971 of Chaplin conducting an orchestra for a new musical score for ""The Kid;"" the extra entitled ""Nice and Friendly"" with Jackie Coogan as well as Lord and Lady Mountbatten and ""Charlie on the Ocean.""

I highly recommend ""The Kid"" for any Chaplin fan; it is an equally good choice for people just discovering Chaplin's artistry simply because everything is so thoughtfully and tastefully done.

1975954,1,B00017LVNC,"Rest assured my one star review is NOT for the film itself,  Charlie Chaplin's THE KID, one of my favorite movies.  I'm hoping my rating raises a flag to potential buyers of a particular DVD version of the film--i.e., THE KID (ENHANCED EDITION).  My negative comments DO NOT APPLY to the MK2 version, as will be obvious if you trouble to read the entire review (which you should if you are thinking about purchasing the film).

Amazon is getting increasingly sloppy in terms of supplying accurate information about its products, and this is a prime example.  Apparently the product on sale here is a single disc DVD-R version of THE KID (which multiple customers have complained about, reporting it has no music track).

The Editorial Review, however, is for an entirely different product altogether, the MK2/Warner Bros 12-disc set, THE CHAPLIN COLLECTION, VOLUME 2, which was out-of-print but as of this writing seems to be available again.  See below:

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Chaplin-Collection-Vol-2-City-Lights-The-Circus-The-Kid-A-King-in-New-York-A-Woman-of-Paris-Monsieur-Verdoux-The-Chaplin-Revue-Charlie-The-Life-and-Art-of-Charles-Chaplin/dp/B00017LVRI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Chaplin Collection, Vol. 2 (City Lights / The Circus / The Kid / A King in New York / A Woman of Paris / Monsieur Verdoux / The Chaplin Revue / Charlie - The Life and Art of Charles Chaplin)</a>

To add to the confusion, most of the 5 star reviews pasted here are obviously referring to the MK2 set, not the single disc version of THE KID.  Needless to say, it's extremely misleading to transfer all the laudatory reviews for a brilliant box set to the home page of what is apparently a shoddily produced single DVD-R.  (Maybe the reason there's no soundtrack is because it's still under copyright, while to the best of my knowledge the film itself is in the public domain.)

I did my best to update the product information through the website, but this proved to be an exercise in sheer frustration:  Amazon's automated list of questions doesn't let you get at this particular problem (which is rampant throughout the site, especially in the MP3 department).

I fully expect this to come full circle:  Amazon will transfer this review to the home page of THE CHAPLIN COLLECTION, VOLUME TWO, where it will receive lots of unhelpful votes and inspire outraged comments.  Urgghh.  But at least this is the sort of machine age irony that Chaplin himself would have found funny.

Chaplin was arguably the greatest filmmaker ever.  See all his movies.  Buy as many as you can afford, because they all improve with repeated viewings.  Just be aware of what you're buying (and as a rule of thumb, avoid DVD-Rs, an unstable, easily damaged format).  Let Amazon know it's not right to give out misleading information about their products.

P.S.  As predicted, Amazon HAS transferred this review from where it was originally posted [under The  Kid (Enhanced) 1921] to The Chaplin Collection, Vol. 2 (City Lights / The Circus / The Kid / A King in New York / A Woman of Paris / Monsieur Verdoux / The Chaplin Revue / Charlie - The Life and Art of Charles Chaplin) (1931).  Sigh.  To reiterate:  the 12-disc MK2/Warner Bros set is wonderful; the ""enhanced"" DVD-R of The Kid is by most accounts woeful.

P.P.S.  Amazon has finally--after I wrote to them--unlinked this edition of THE KID with the MK2 box set.  They have also deleted the erroneous Editorial Review.  Those are improvements.  However, this 2-disc public domain product is apparently still linked to the MK2 2-disc edition (which is probably the sole reason why it still retains a very high rating from Amazon customers).

1975955,4,B00017LVNC,"It is getting tiresome to have to weed oneself through all of these version of films, most of them an attempt to ratchet up the price with ""digital reworking"", etc.  Beyond the few extras that you get tacked on - and the ones in the second disk are better than many in terms of substance - you still often find films from another era that meet entirely different standards than the ones you are used to.  So it is with this film:  it is scarred, sometimes out of focus or with tunnel vision, and somewhat static.  Nonetheless, that was the way things were done then at the cutting edge and Chaplin is a pioneer of sheer genius.  As this is his first feature, every film buff should have a copy, even if it isn't this one.

Regarding the story, it is pretty maudlin, if moving.  My whole family watched it, rapt, though also commenting and laughing on the film's appearance and melodramatic flourishes.  My daughter really got into it and had all sorts of questions, reflected how this is essentially a museum piece that doesn't need to be enhanced.  Jackie Coogan is terrific and Chaplin is hilarious, of course, and that is timeless.

1975960,5,B00017LVNC,"This is a wonderful two disc set; the first disc containing the movie itself, restored and with a musical score composed by Chaplin in the early 1970's for the re-release of the film.

The story itself concerns an unwed mother who can't keep her child. She writes a note and leaves the child where he might be found. The child is found by the Little Tramp (Charles Chaplin) who tries to find someone to take the baby. Eventually he keeps the child and claims it as his own. He brings up the child in abject poverty, and the affection and caring between the two makes this a very touching film. Probably the most heart-wrenching scene in all Chaplin films, is in ""the Kid."" The child at one point is being taken away from the Tramp when it is discovered that he is not the child's real father. The child (Jackie Coogan) is crying pitifully and reaching out to the Tramp as he is being taken away from the only home and parent he has ever known. The film includes comedy, of course, but the pathos and sweetness of the film makes it one of my all time favorites.

On the second disc, there are many supplementary features, the first is a short documentary by David Robinson, Chaplin's biographer which sets the film in its historical perspective and background. This disc also includes deleted scenes, several shorts starring Jackie Coogan and Chaplin, one is footage of Chaplin recording the new musical score in 1972. A longer feature included is ""My Boy,"" starring Jackie Coogan and running 55 minutes. A feature I truly enjoyed is ""How to Make Movies"" recorded in 1918 and showing Chaplin's studio and a little bit ""behind the scenes"" of what went into making movies in that era.

One interesting observation on my part, is that I have a hard time believing that this movie was made in 1921! It seems so fresh and timeless. Part of that may be due to the beautiful musical score and restoration of the film, but the story is so touching and well-acted that you forget that it is a silent film.

This special edition two-disc DVD has a restored version of the print so the picture is very clear, actually astounding for its age.

It is a wonderful blend of humor and drama. Charlie Chaplin's unique humor, combined with an involving storyline and strong sentimentality make this one to remember. Chaplin's humor ranges from pure slapstick to some clever stunts.

The ""kid"" - Jackie Coogan - is just as memorable, maybe even more so. He is unbelievably cute, especially in those old-time clothes he wore. Watching the expressions on his face, even as a baby, are fascinating and facial expressions certainly were a trademark of the silent era.

So, between Chaplin and Coogan, and a very involving story that can break your heart one minute and have you laughing out loud the next, it's an amazing piece of work. This is a very fast-paced story which lasts less than an hour.

1975965,5,B00017LVNC,"I'll admit to having shed a few tears when watching the extremely tender and movie film, but I'm not ashamed for this film is one that should reach any fathers heart.  I am new to the Chaplin fan club (as I made obvious within my review of `City Lights') and this film has got to be, not only my favorite Chaplin film, but one of my favorite films of all time.  Honestly, it is one of the purest expressions of human love and devotion I've seen in a long time, and what makes the film so moving is that it never reaches the saccharine levels of sentiment that so many films feel the need to broach today.  Instead, `The Kid' allows your heartstrings to swell from the realness of each and every scene, capturing the love between this man and boy with a natural and realistic (never forced) air.

`The Kid' tells the story of the Tramp who stumbles upon an abandoned baby, a young boy who is left by his mother who is not able to care for him.  The Tramp, who is barely able to care for himself, feels sorry for you infant and decides to take him in.  The film progresses forward to when the boy is a few years old and is living with the Tramp as father and son.  The Tramp is very protective of the boy and very caring of him.

Then events take place that place their relationship in jeopardy when the authorities attempt to separate the two.

The film works brilliantly in creating an attachment with the audience, making us a part of the Tramp and kid's family, moving us to tears at the thought of their separation.  The performances by both Chaplin and his `mini-me' Jackie Coogan are utterly fantastic, both of them completely convincing in their respective roles.  Little Coogan is a perfect costar for Chaplin, matching him gag for gag, appearing natural and adorable in the process, and Chaplin is so invested in this character (tragic events involving the death of his own child most likely inspiring this very inspired performance) that he reaches the very pit of the audiences soul with his emotional connection.  Edna Purviance also delivers a nice performance as the boy's mother who has a change of heart after she has made a name for herself and wishes to reconnect with her long lost son.

`The Kid' is one of those classic films that must be seen and admired by everyone.  I don't see how anyone could find their heart not moved by the film and its emotional connective powers, for there are few films made that have the strength this one has.  Chaplin was a masterful storyteller, and `The Kid' is truly one of his finest stories.",1219968000,3,2548,4.473002159827214
1975966,5,B00017LVNC,"The Kid is another one of Charlie Chaplin's great films. What you have to like about the Chaplin films is that they have both humor and morals. In this one, a baby is abandoned by his mother and, when she goes back to find the child when she has second thoughts, it is gone. The Tramp (Chaplin) stumbles upon the child, and, after initially trying to rid himself of the responsibility, decides to keep him after finding a note with a plea to take care of the child. Chaplin's antics are one again numerous in the film, especially as he tries to figure out how to raise a child. The film fast forwards 5 years to the young boy now adjusted to life with the Tramp.  However, fates will cross, and the mother who once left a child will reenter the scene.

Chaplin has a way with making something so simple seem hilarious. Take the scene with his son fighting the bully, and then having the older bully's brother show up. Chaplin has a quality of personifying the underdog so much in these kinds of moments, and it makes it that much more entertaining to watch. There are also several scenes where Chaplin must outwit a police officer who is after him.

Although this is a short film, it is a fantastic sample of Chaplin's comedic genius. Even though I enjoyed City Lights and Modern Times more than The Kid , I still consider this film a gem that many modern films don't measure up to.",1209859200,2,1382,4.390625

This movie, The Kid, really showcases his talent, which surprised me because of the early date of the film, 1921.  It was also the second highest-grossing film in that year. And the praise is deserved, because the Kid is a lot of things. It's a comedy, yes, but it's got loads of serious drama, probably the first film to do combine the two.  Charlie Chaplin was socially aware, and this film is also considered the first to portray realistically the conditions of the lower urban classes at the beginning of the Gilded Age. The Kid is also just a flat-out great movie, the emotional bond between Mr. Chaplin and, also considered the first child star actor, Jackie Coogan serves as the basis for a touching and funny feature.

There are some similarities to another Chaplin gem, City Lights.  He liked to put comic boxing scenes in his movies.  He also liked beautiful and loving women.  And the cops are always bad guys giving the tramp a hard time.

The Kid, the title character, is very cute, and very well played by Jackie Coogan.  He helps to make it a precious film, and I mean that only in a good sense.

I like happy endings too, and Chaplin is happy to oblige.  But one thing I'd really like to see is the sequel to this one, to see how the lives of the three main characters develop.

This film is so far superior to almost every movie coming out today.  And I'm not one to praise the old simply because it is old.  If an old movie is terrible, I'll say so.

In an era when silent films were cranked out quickly and were far from an art form, Chaplin decided to take a new approach. Although this film started out as another short film, by the time it was done, Chaplin had spent a year on it, and had taken more shots and retakes than perhaps had been done for any film in history. By completion, it had grown into a six reel feature film.

I hesitate to use the word artistry, because it sounds like one of those words used for films that only critics tend to appreciate.  But this film is both artistic and accessible.  If you are not used to silent films, or the ones you have seen either lacked continuity or were hard to follow, you will find this as easy to watch as any modern film, and find that it tells a story as well as the best of films.

This edition features the musical score written by Chaplin, which underscores both the comedy and the drama of this movie. A host of features on the second DVD give you a feel for the background and the era.

If you are a Chaplin fan, this movie is a must have.  If you are not a Chaplin fan, but are curious what all the fuss is about, this movie will let you know.",1151625600,34,1618,4.733096085409253
1975971,5,B00017LVNC,"This was Chaplin's first feature-length film, and it's a beautiful work of art. Chaplin is the tramp who finds an abandoned baby in an alley with a note attached pleading for the finder to care for and love the child. Some inventive scenes of Charlie learning the rudiments of baby care follow, and then it jumps ahead five years. Jackie Coogan is now the kid and it was not only his greatest role, but perhaps the best appearance on screen of any child star until Tatum O'Neill in PAPER MOON; he might also be the best character Chaplin ever worked with. Coogan throws rocks through windows while Chaplin, a glazier, appears on the scene to make repairs: it's a living. In one astonishing scene, officials from the county orphanage come to take the kid away, and Charlie puts up a fight to keep him - racing over rooftops to catch up with the truck with Coogan inside until Chaplin leaps into the truck and rescues him: it's a brilliant piece of moviemaking and was copied a thousand times in westerns with a horse replacing the truck. There is a dream sequence near the end that is very strange and somehow seems out of place. But the movie is a great one. It took one whole year to make at a time when Chaplin was cranking out two-reelers by the week for National and Essenay.",1139616000,3,1279,4.47008547008547
1975972,5,B00017LVNC,"This MK2 edition of The Kid has to be the best available. Beautiful picture quality and great extras, the best in my opinion being another silent starring Jackie: My Boy (1921), which I like as much as The Kid (despite its being completely silent, even devoid of a musical score). All in all, a great package and worth every cent of its price.",1128384000,5,343,4.4603174603174605

And please guys when you come to movies like this masterpiece don't give them a 3 star rate. Not beacuse it didn't have many extras or something like this. The movie is that counts.",1126137600,3,350,4.303030303030303
1975974,5,B00017LVNC,"Perhaps not as polished as ""City Lights"" and ""The Gold Rush"", this movie tells an interesting story about an orphan boy (played by a very young Jackie Coogan or Fester as his friends call him) who gets abandoned by his mother, played by Edna Purviance, and finds himself in the care of a tramp played by you know who.  There are many usual early Chaplin features such as a good fight scene and bumbling police officers ala the ""Keystone Cops"" and hard-headed bureaucratic types. Well to make it short, despite much drama, the kid gets reunited with his mother and all ends well.

Matched with a fun little short, ""The Idle Class"", Chaplin spoofs the well-healed and their penchant for playing golf and partying.  In a case of mistaken identity, the tramp and a millionaire find themselves in the same resort and some funny drama ensues with Edna Purviance in the middle of it.  The golf scene is very funny and the sight of the millionaire character finding himself in a phone booth without any pants on is enough to conjur up terrifying dreams of the past.

Both movies are very entertaining and my little girls love to watch them both, laughing themselves silly at numerous scenes.  The score is also really good.  Chaplin really had a good feel for what music goes well with each scene.  If you can find a copy, get it, keep it and enjoy it.

I welcome feedback on this and all reviews at wstrnlibwarrior@yahoo.com",1114473600,3,1417,4.636
1975975,5,B00017LVNC,"Chaplin's ""The Kid"" was a pleasure to rediscover on this two-disk set.  The print is excellant, and Chaplin's original score beautifully compliments what is a really terrific story.  Say what you like about some of the now dated, even artificial,  touches in the film.  But if you rewrote the script and submitted it to a producer today it would still sell.  The second disk extras were also fascinating, including the documentary about an Iranian film maker who discusses ""The Kid"" from a century and half a world away.  Well worth it.",1095120000,3,536,4.835164835164835
1975976,3,B00017LVNC,"The Little Man with the little mustashe stars in his classic and touching comedy, the Kid. He plays his legendary Tramp character in this story about a man who finds a orphan baby boy, left by his real mother, the tramp takes him in and raises him and loves as if he was really  his kid, and the kid loved him. The kid is 5 years old in the movie, ,but when men from an orphange come to take away the kid, Tramp will not let them, he fights them off, they eventually get the kid and drive off, but our hero will never give up on his most important possesion and Tramp does get his kid back and the kid back to his da da, the kid was not his blood, he loved the kid and kid loved him. A happy ending, this is good for a silent movie and for a father and son movie, this is the silent Big Daddy, Chaplin is perfect father. mixing comedy and love between a father and a son makes this chaplin classic and a classic all around.",1093305600,2,923,3.9623655913978495
1975977,3,B00017LVNC,"Theres plenty of reveiws already, I won't go with another one...
But my peeve about it is: Why is it on 2 DVD's? The first disc contain's the movie (50 minutes long) and 2 audio selections of 2.0 and 5.1, and a bunch of subtitles..... and then looking on the second DVD there is a few more features , one even longer then the movie! and a couple of 20 minute things, but I know they would all fit onto the one disc. It just makes me wonder why did they put them onto 2 discs, instead of one? These movies are in black and white, i'm sure all of it would have easily fit onto the one disc!",1085788800,,588,3.9495798319327733
1975978,4,B00017LVNC,"It's a watchable movie, and it never really does anything wrong, but in my opinion it is simply not as brilliant as many of Chaplin's later movies (ie. The Gold Rush, City Lights). It has its funny moments, but they do not approach anywhere near the pinnacles seen in some of his later works; they provide more of a chuckle than the uncontrollable laughter that results from watching some his later ones.
There were some very touching sceens in the movie, and the acting was pretty good, from both Chaplin and the kid.  Still, when I finished watching it, I didn't feel like I had just watched a great movie; I felt like I had watched an acceptable one (there was also a little too much Christian imagery in the film for my taste, but I'll take it as a sign of the times).
Anyway, if you're new to Chaplin I suggest that you see something like City Lights first; this film is fairly good, but it's not among his best.
As for ""The Idle Class"", it's a pretty good Chaplin short that has its definite highlight in the scene where the tramp goes golfing and finds that he forgot to bring a ball. Needless to say, hilarity ensues!",1085270400,,1125,4.382775119617225
1975979,5,B00017LVNC,"It all begins with a mother who has a child out of wedlock and in despair she leaves her boy in an abandoned vehicle.  The car is stolen and the infant is dumped in the garbage.  The orphan kid is found by the Tramp (Charles Chaplin) who then attempts to get rid of the kid.  However, when the Tramp finds a short, yet affectionate note he decides to care for the child and teach him everything he knows.  The Kid is a tragic drama with much humor that will entertain with it's visual imagery and teach valuable lessons with it's many themes.  In the end, Chaplin will leave the audience with a timeless and brilliant cinematic experience.",1081296000,2,639,4.427350427350428
1975980,5,B00017LVNC,"The story line and the appearance of little Jackie Coogan make this movie the best of Charlie Chaplin's silent movies. Charlie comes across an orphaned baby and affectionately and innovatively raises him in the midst of poverty of the 1920's.
I enjoyed the 1920's clothing and cars and I continue to be amazed at the creative ability of Charlie Chaplin to tell a story so well with so few words.",1079136000,,395,4.6571428571428575
1975981,4,B00017LVNC,"""The Kid"" is a story that, under anybody else's direction would seen trite, maudelin and coy. In the hands of Charlie Chaplin it is pure magic times a thousand. Jackie Coogan has to get part of the credit for making this tale of an orphaned child turned pre-teen vandal, a comedic winner.  When the little tramp (Chaplin) discovers the abandoned baby he decides to raise the boy as his own and quickly molds the street urchin into part of his plan to sell plate glass to the slums. Jackie throws stones to break the windows. Charlie appears to fix the windows and charge a handsome fee for his services.
TRANSFER: The film is riddled with age related artifacts that, even with this skillful transfer, are still present. Film grain is moderate. Black levels are sometimes weak. The gray scale is adequately balanced. Aliasing, edge enhancement and shimmering of fine details are all present and sometimes distract. The audio is 5.1 and nicely balanced.
EXTRAS: a short subject in which Chaplin shows the building of his new studio and how movies are made, a couple of short subjects with Jackie Coogan, newsreel footage of Chaplin's trip to Europe, deleted scenes, a photo gallery, film posters and trailers.
BOTTOM LINE: AN ABSOLUTE MUST FOR THE FILM. The transfer is merely above average, though for its age, well above par.",1078185600,5,1325,4.8370044052863435
1975982,5,B00017LVNC,"I am so pleased this film is making its way to DVD. I have owned the VHS for many years, which is showing tremendous wear and tear. Young Jackie Coogan stole the show from Chaplin, and yet the Little Tramp didn't seem to mind! An extraordinarily touching film, suitable for the entire family! I cannot recommend this movie strongly enough!",1072915200,2,339,4.666666666666667
1975983,4,B00017LVNC,"Not too bad, but Chaplin's first full length film was more serious than funny. I watch Chaplin only because of funny. But it's still a great film otherwise about a mother who gives up her son and is picked up by the tramp Chaplin. He takes care of him until a doctor warns him about proper care. When the law tries to take the kid away from Chaplin, he does everything he can to retreat him. Finally, the mother and child meet at the end of the film. It also includes an OK Chaplin short where Chaplin plays two roles. One is a rich sort of bachelor to remarry his ex-wife, and one is a tramp who plays golf and comes to a costume party to have some fun, when the two of them mix up. I'm sure people love this film, so buy if you want.",1028851200,,735,4.006802721088436
1975984,5,B00017LVNC,"The Kid is not only one of the Chaplin's best films but also almost his ""kid"". The film came out after Chaplin's having ""a hard labor"" of conflicts with his wife at the time and the film company which he was working with. Perhaps what few know is that Chaplin completed the film taking a refuge in an inn in Salt Lake City, Utah. His effort and enthusiasm were really paid off, which is obvious when you watch the film. The Kid is a true gem of all the movies with Chaplin's fantastic inspiration in story and directing, plus the great performance of Jackie Coogan.",999129600,4,565,4.390476190476191
1975985,3,B00017LVNC,"This film is quite decent compared with the average comedy of today, but it is far below the level of Chaplin's greatest which were to come a few years later: The Circus, City Lights. The humerous sequences were not all that funny (although they may have been to the audiences during the 1920's). There are a few tedious sequences that do not seem to advance the story ( the fight between the two children, the wierd dream scene). And the grand finale scene is very bland. See the 1931 film: CITY LIGHTS and notice the great difference in quality of humor and storytelling.",993254400,,573,4.572815533980583
1975986,5,B00017LVNC,"The Kid remains my favorite Chaplin film.  The first time I saw it I actually cried.  It continues to amuse and move (I show it to college film students each semester and they love it). Consider this: Chaplin stared, directed, produced, wrote the script and even composed the musical score!
Another item that may increase your appreciation of this film: Chaplin and his wife had just had a baby die when he began developing the idea of having his alter-ego, the Tramp, raise a baby.  I don't know about you, but I wouldn't have the strength to share my pain with ten million people by turning it into a movie.
This gem belongs in any video collection.  Enjoy!",973036800,19,659,4.559322033898305

8007584,5,B00017LVNC,"General Description Charlie ""The Tramp"" Chaplain happens upon a baby (The Kid) that he ultimately ends up raising. Through a series of events the kid's mother is trying to locate that baby years later.

Music: 10/10 -- very bright and colorful sound track, that allowed for the expressions of the character to transcend. From speedy romp music, to slow melancholy, all the way to riveting fight music. This score truly plucks your emotion in a way that makes you feel more into that scene.

Story:9/10 -- Premise of the story is sad and somber. Mother has child with a man, he abandons her, she abandons the child. The tramp finds the kid in an alley and tries to ditch him like the plague. The universe has a funny way of showing Chaplain that this is meant to be. Fast forward 5 years. The mother finds herself prominent in the entertainment industry, but longing for the one thing she can never have back -her baby. What will the mother do if she were to know her child is right under her nose this whole time. Watch to find out.

Acting: 10/10 -- For me this is a tough category, by my interpretation a lot of acting comes from mannerisms, expressions, and delivery of the message their character has. Each and every character in this movie felt extremely unique (to their world) and had impact. From the nurse and doctor in the opening scene, all the way to dreamland each character is able to convey their role to utmost certainty without a word ever being spoken. You can see that body language truly does speak volumes, when used properly. This is a skill often forgotten in current films.

Overall Score: 9.7/10 Explanation of grading. the music being top notch really exemplified what the story was reaching at. Overall the premise of the story is simple which allowed for the comedy, and sadness to be felt all the more while not being convoluted. The cohesion of everything was able to take simple movements, and simple technology from 1920s and turn this into a timeless classic that even a new viewer like myself can enjoy.",1515196800,,2037,4.634349030470914

He invited the royals for their honey moon, privately hired a train and took the royals, family, and friends from the East coast to the West coast, hired Charley Chaplin to do a private movie about the stolen pearls of the newlywed bride. Charlie Chaplin and child star Coogan are included, as are Col. Thompson, his son-in-law and his daughter, Stephen Pell and wife, who were the grandparents of John Bigelow Loveland-Pell, Founder of New Earth Foundation. Steven Pell and wife, supported by Col.
