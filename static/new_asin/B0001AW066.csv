1984690,4,B0001AW066,"The Seventh Series of Friends, I hate to admit, is not my favourite. I believe the storylines are a little to mundane and the actors try and do the best with what they're given. Their are 24 episodes in all. Below is a description of each to refresh your memories.

The One With Phoebe's Cookies - Phoebe holds the key to the best-tasting cookies ever, which drives chef Monica crazy. Rachel gets high-handed while trying to teach Joey how to sail.

1984692,5,B0001AW066,"The seventh season of Friends is for sure my favorite season ever ! With great episodes like ""The One With Monica's Thunder"", ""The One With Rachel's Book"", ""The One With The Nap Partners"", ""The One With All the Cheesecakes"", and much more !... And the seventh season is also the first one introducing the Super Sizes episodes such as ""The One With The Truth About London"" and ""The One With Joey's New Brain"" with Susan Sarandon guest-starring !
Above all, the Season Finale is the best one Friends ever produced ! With great stoylines, suspens and guest stars (Gary Oldman, Morgan Fairchild and Kathleen Turner as Chandler's dad !), the cliffhanger is insufferable and the only thing we want to do at the end is to watch the Season 8 Premiere !
Also guest-starring this season : Eddie Cahill, Denise Richard, Winona Ryder ans more !
The seventh season is also a season with a lot of humour, emotion and friendship (well... It's Friends actually ! ;-).
From Rachel's crush on her new younger assistant to her pregnancy; from Monica's wedding plans to her wedding ceremony; from Phoebe's secret cookies recipe to her secret kiss with Rachel; from Joey's laugh finding Rachel's dirty book to his movie collaboration with Oldman; from Chandler's strained smile in pictures to his runaway marriage plan; from Ross's nap with Joey to his crush on her cousin...

1984713,4,B0001AW066,"I was against finishing the series Friends, because once characters started having babies and getting married, I found no connection with the material.

1984756,5,B0001AW066,This is a must-have for any Friends fan.  These are the actual uncut episodes and there are scenes that were never shown on TV.  What a difference it makes to see what never made it to air.  It clears up why the audience was laughing before the actors said anything when you see that there was a line cut before that.,1459641600,,317,4.163934426229508
1984757,4,B0001AW066,"A couple seasons of Friends revolved heavily around the relationship between two of the characters.  No, Im not talking about Rachel and Ross but about Monica and Chandler.  Season seven was one of those seasons.  Yes, the other characters still get plenty of screen time, and the laughs are still plentiful.

Season seven opens moments after season six ended with the proposal.  Thats right, Monica (Courteney Cox) and Chandler (Matthew Perry) are engaged!  As a result, much of the season revolves around the two of them and the plans for the wedding, especially near the end of the season as we gear up for the season finale wedding.  And those episodes are wonderful.  We get plenty of laughs from control freak Monica while also seeing just how much this couple cares for each other.  There are some truly touching moments between them here.

Season six was also one of the few seasons not to end with a Ross (David Schwimmer) and Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) cliffhanger.  But the writers quickly fix that in the season opener as Rachel suggests they sleep together one last time.  The rumors that swirl around as a result upset Monica who wants that night to be about her engagement.  But no, the two of them aren't about to really get back together since Rachel quickly falls for her new assistant, Tag (guest star Eddie Cahill).  Elsewhere over the course of the season, Joeys new cable show bombs, and he winds up back on Days of Our Lives when his character gets a brain transplant and Phoebes apartment is ready after the fire from last season, but she moves back in alone when the wall making a second bedroom is taken out during the renovations.

But as I said earlier, everything leads up to the wedding in the season finale.  We finally meet Chandlers father, but then the groom gets cold feet.  And someone learns they are pregnant before the final blackout of the season.

There aren't quite as many ongoing storylines this season.  Theres the wedding, Joey getting back on the soap, and Rachels relationship with Tag.  Other than that, we have more standalone stories this year.  But thats okay because there are still plenty of laughs.  As always, the Thanksgiving episode is wonderful as Rosss big mouth gets him into trouble trying to name all 50 states.  An episode where Joey and Ross are both dating the same woman also has some outstanding laughs.  And in another episode, Ross, Monica, and Chandler start trying to out embarrass each other.

These are tempered by a number of subpar episodes.  Some of these come from the characters acting stupidly for laughs.  I know that embarrassment humor has been a staple of the series for years, but there seems to be more of it this year, and it leads to some very cringe worthy moments.  And some of the episodes just don't quite work, like this years Christmas episode, The One with the Holiday Armadillo.  Another subpar episode is The One with All the Cheesecake which finds Chandler and Rachel stealing a neighbors delicious cheesecake.  The only funny bit from The One Where Theyre Up All Night involved Phoebe fighting with a fire alarm that won't stop making noise.

February sweeps found Friends facing off with powerhouse Survivor, and to counteract that, NBC rolled out supersized episodes of their shows.  These ran just a little longer than the traditional episodes ran, and we get that extra footage in the set.  They also features some great guest stars such as Jason Alexander as the suicidal supply manager Phoebe calls and Susan Sarandon as an actress on Joeys soap.  The season features several appearances of Elliot Gould and Christina Pickles as Monica and Rosss parents, and the season ends with Morgan Fairchild and Kathleen Turner guest starring as Chandlers parents.

And of course, the regular cast does a great job with the material.  While I am not a fan of all the writing, the cast still hits it out of the park each week.

The four DVD set contains all 24 episodes of the season in their native full frame and stereo sound.  Extras include three audio commentaries (although the one on Holiday Armadillo is worth skipping) interviews with some of the notable guest stars, and a gag reel.  Gunthers preview on next season and the quiz about the wedding are completely skippable.

While this season isn't the best of Friends, it still contains plenty of laughs.  Fans of the show will enjoy watching these episodes over and over even if some of the best are behind us.",1459209600,,4463,4.759114583333333

They cut out a few minutes worth of dialogue and plot to shrink it for TV. The full length episodes are on the DVDs.).

1984840,3,B0001AW066,"This is one of the weakest seasons of the show. Not as tightly written, not as funny, and all of the characters are becoming more obnoxious and/or silly than charming. This is the first time I've watched ""Friends"" from Season 1, in order, all the way through, and it's provided me an opportunity to witness the show's slow decline over time. In contrast to the tight, bright, fresh and funny antics of the characters in the early seasons, now they just come off as tiresome. Perhaps this was inevitable as the characters aged: a perpetually dumb and clueless guy in his 30s isn't quite as winsome as that same dude in his early 20s. Rachel's constant worries about not finding a life partner just seem narcissistic, given her impossibly perfect good looks, enviable career, and movie star wardrobe. An entire episode built around Chandler's inability to smile in front of a camera? And, worse, in these later seasons, he is often portrayed as a loser, a bad joke, and as a mate Monica chose out of desperation. Ross, who has always been annoying with his nasal voice and doofus demeanor, is even more obnoxious as he apparently spends entire days guarding a section of the library where his dissertation is shelved in order to prevent coeds from becoming amorous in the presence of his words. What?!  The only character who remains pretty consistently funny and refreshing is Phoebe, but even she is becoming more weirdo-strange than bohemian-quirky. There are three more seasons to go, and I honestly don't remember if the show starts to spiral up in quality once more before its swan song. I'll be there for them (like I've been there before), and I hope the writers will be there for me. Right now, however, they kind of seem stuck in second gear.",1415318400,,1750,4.737704918032787

I made good on my promise, and after watching all 10 seasons, I become a fan.

While Monica prepares for her wedding from pretty much the moment that ring slips onto her finger, Phoebe shares her grandmother's no-so-secret cookie reciepe, Rachael gets a new assistant whom she is imediatly attracted to, Joey and Ross take a nap together and there's a sequel, and Chandler can't photograph well, so some creative steps are taken for a decent photo for the engagement announcement that Jack and Judy Geller want to distribute.  It's another season full of laughs and reasons to stay loyal to this great show.  See Ross as a self-appointed campus cop who seeks to prevent rounchy behavior in front of his book in the library.  Chandler challenges the friends to name all fifty states in six minutes, leaving one of them to try and accomplish it throughout Thanksgiving.  Monica makes quite the treat for the neighbors and Chandler must step in to help her.  Ross's son Ben gets what is probably the best lesson about Hanukkah of all time, featuring Superman, Santa Claus, and a visitor from the south.  Phoebe briefly reunites with an old boyfriend.  And Rachael obsesses about someone else's cheesecake and later gives everyone the surprise of a lifetime.  Again, get this season to keep up with all the antics and surprises, whether they're predictable or not.",1378684800,,1489,4.900398406374502

There are some collectors out there who are looking for the 2004 released BOX SET version (yes, the big cardboard version), only because their other season collections are the same type.

This is NOT the BOX SET version but the re-packaged 2010 re-release (the slim, plastic version). If you are looking for that version, simply search for it on Amazon and you can find it for $15.00 (instead of the lofty $25.00 TDIHoldings is trying to sell it for). TDIHoldings is basically ripping you off for something you can get cheaper!

I have already put in a return request to Amazon, will return the product for FULL-REFUND + FULL-SHIPPING and Amazon has taken steps to take down this listing as it is deceiving to customers. Bad practice by seller.

FOLLOW UP REVIEW:
To Amazon's credit, their customer service reps did a great job working with my complaint after they gave me a full refund.  Their answer is that the downloaded episodes are the 'original broadcast' episodes and the DVD versions include extended scenes.  Got it.  Makes a lot of sense.  However, Amazon uses the DVD packaging photos for the downloaded versions as well.  Plus, when I bought the download version from Amazon through my Playstation 3, it shows that there are 123 reviews for the product.  These 123 reviews are actually for the DVD version.

Just know that if you buy the downloads, don't expect the expanded content that you may be used to seeing on the DVD's.",1334016000,8,1644,4.776595744680851

1985086,4,B0001AW066,"There are some sitcoms that required ""growing up"" before they became really good - and Friends is one of those.  Early seasons had distracting gimmicks like monkeys and triplets.  Later seasons relied on the performances and writing and were better as a result.  Season 7 is a solid season all the way through, with the underlying theme of preparation for Monica and Chandler's wedding appearing in most of the episodes.  Thus, the entire season has a narrative flow of sorts, but every episode is still stand-alone and watchable by itself.

Other reviews have listed the entire set of shows, so there is no need for me to repeat that.  Some others have mentioned that the season is somewhat bland.  Perhaps this is most true for those viewers invested primarily in the Rachel-Ross Axis, especially in the light of the upcoming Season 8 that re-introduces that entire storyline (through Rachel's pregnancy).  I, for one, do not miss it.  There are plenty of ""soap-opera moments"" in this season, but I prefer such moments to be centred on the soundstage where Joey is filming ""Days of Our Lives"".

All in all, it is a solid and very funny season.  There are lots of guest stars - a personal favourite is Susan Sarandon as a soap opera queen.  The box set is exactly what you'd expect if you've bought previous seasons of the show - there are a few commentaries (which often have a few neat tidbits but which also tend to cheerleading at times), there is a little quiz, and so on.  However, the best part of having the show on DVD is to be able to watch it uncut and without advertisements.  Friends is also one of those shows that improves when you see the episodes together - the underlying comraderie and warmth of the cast is emphasized, and it makes the inside runnning jokes funnier.",1245024000,2,1787,4.649681528662421

1985089,5,B0001AW066,"I can't say with confidence that I have a least favorite season of this show. Of course, I don't think as a whole Season 7 is the show's weak point, but after noticing it was the only season receiving less than a 4 stars, I didn't think it got a fair rap.

The primary issue is that there's only so much the writers can do when the season's 'A Story' was already developed at the end of Season 6. With everybody invested in Chandler and Monica's wedding, there really couldn't be any heavy story lines involving the other four characters that would divide an audience's attention. If you will, the writers couldn't allow anything to ""steal Monica's thunder.""

High Points:
- Chandler & Monica's Engagement Picture
- Rachel teaches Joey how to sail
- Joey & Ross's napping secret
- Ross's library book
- The Hanukkah story as told by the Holiday Armadillo, Santa and Superman
- The One Where They All Turn 30
- Joey's return to 'Days of Our Lives'
- Monica reveals the ugly truth about London to Chandler
- The One Where They're Up All Night (probably one of my favorite episodes in the whole series)
- Joey's 'Soapie' Award
- Denise Richards guest stars as Monica and Ross's hot cousin
- Rachel runs into an old sorority sister (Winona Ryder) she made out with in college
- Chandler & Monica fly out to Vegas to reconcile with Chandler's father and invite him to the wedding

The only throbbing flaw I found in Season 7 was in the 30th birthday episode. It revolves around Rachel's birthday and proceeds to flashbacks of everyone else's 30th. The only problem is that in Season 1's episode 'The Ick Factor', Monica reveals she is 26, which would've made her 30 in Season 5. Since Rachel's birthday is in Season 7 and Monica and Rachel knew each other from school, you have to assume they were the same age. I just wish the time line had been better, but I understand it's something the writers have to deal with.

Weak Points:
- Monica tries to recover an old cookie recipe passed down in Phoebe's family
- Joey's lead on Mac And C.H.E.E.S.E.
- The One Where Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs
- The One With The Cheap Wedding Dress

The whole season was a simple stall. I thought the writers did an excellent job with it and the acting was tremendous, as usual. Season 7 also entailed probably the most gripping Season Finale of the series and set the stage for a remarkable eighth season. This is a 5 star season any way you slice it. The worst of 'Friends', if this is it, is still one of the best things on TV.

1985090,5,B0001AW066,"Friends - The Complete Seventh Season missed the mark a little bit but I think this is a much better season than seasons 8 through 10.

The One with All the Cheesecakes and the Christmas Candy are also standouts. A lot of guest stars appeared in this season like Susan Sarandon, Jason Alexander, Denise Richards, and Kathleen Turner.

1985155,3,B0001AW066,"The seventh season of ""Friends"" represents the show at it's worst. It seems as if the writers and producers were running out of steam and were losing some of the hillarious creativity that made the show Must See for the previous six seasons. The actors did what they could to try to elevate the material but, for the only time during the show's run, the cast seemed bored and detatached. Something was just amiss during this season in general. The show had a strange feel to it and to a new viewer, the once mighty ""Friends"" may have seemed like a medicore sitcom that was overhyped for no reason. Maybe  for the first time the loyal fans of the show felt that maybe it was time to bow out (thankfully season eight reinvogorated the writers, the cast, and the audience and provided a renassiance of sorts that would last until the end of the show's run). The entire season revolved around Monica and Chandler's wedding and every other storyline seems to be filler until the writer's could marry the two off in a May-Sweeps season ending episode. I believe this was the season when Perry's drug addiction was reaching its climax and, for the first and only time, his personal troubles began to affect his acting (thankfully Perry recovered and did the right thing by taking time off to get his problems in order). Chandler who once was arguably the funniest character on primetime, now became a corny shadow of himself. Monica reached an all time controlling high as she planned her wedding, and Cox again finds herself in a thankless role. To her credit, Cox does make Monica amusing and still tries to retain her likeability, but the writers prove too strong for the nearly unfailing Cox and Monica becomes a caricature (it will still be another season or two before Monica is restored to a multi-layered charming character again). Rachel's major storyline involved her relationship with her much younger assistant Tag. Rachel's work situations are always funny and Aniston again plays Rachel to a charming, if somewhat befuddled, T (as most fans know however it is not until season 8 when Aniston is really given the material and opportunity to shine). Phoebe is again not given a lot to do this season but mainly support the other characters, and again, Kudrow proves to be unfailing in her portrayal. Kudrow is maybe the only actor who is not bogged down with the material this season and she saves even some of the worst episodes (i.e ""TOW Rosita Dies""- hysterical Phoebe moments as a telemarketer trying to stop Jason Alexander from committing suicide). LeBlanc's Joey gets to reprise his role as Dr. Drake Ramoray on DOOL. LeBlanc is funny and, along with Kudrow, he is also able to provide some memorable lines and scenes in an otherwise bleak season. Schwimmer's Ross is not really given much of a story arc this season and Schwimmer is effective and funny in his role. While season seven is problematic, it is still ""Friends"" after all so there are bound to be some meorable episodes, including, ""TOW Monica's Thunder,"" ""TOW Phoebe's Cookies"" (absolutely hysterical Pheebs/Monica story and scenes), ""TOW Rachel's Assistant,"" ""TOW Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs"" (it's a Thanksgiving episode so it's bound to be a highlight), ""TOW They're Up All Night,"" ""TOW They All Turn Thirty"" (Aniston feels so funny and real here and the flashbacks to all their thirtieth birthdays are classic), ""TOW Monica and Chandler's Wedding"" (a great episode all around every actor is finally back on their game here and the episode itself feels like it belongs in one of ""Friends"" earlier and funnier seasons. This episode also provides one of the greatest shocks in ""Friends"" history and sets the stage for one of the stories that will rejuvenate the following season..Rachel's pregnancy).",1150243200,8,3775,4.870917573872473
1985156,4,B0001AW066,"Seven Years into the show, you can tell it is starting to get worn down a bit. However, this season doesn't come with all negativity. This season has its share of Great episodes!

The episode in which Ross plays the bagpipes and asks everybody to sing along then Phoebe does its so damn funny I seriously laughed all night about it.

Another highlight is watching two of our Friends get Married.....for real not drunk.

Season Seven also sees Phoebe moving in back to her old house after it had been burnt, Rachel deciding to live with Joey and starting a relationship with her assistant Kip, Ross well, just being Ross.

I wasn't completely dissapointed with this Season, but I could tell from the first few episodes that by now it had started to lose a little steam, but of course would come right back in later seasons.

I don't know if I would totally reccomend this season out of all 10, it sure isn't the worst, but you will find better.

But PLEASE if you can get hold of it SEE THE EPISODE THE ONE WITH JOEYS NEW BRAIN and see that bagpipe scene, ONE OF THE FUNNIEST MOMENTS OF ALL 10 YEARS FOR ME!

Anyway, enough with the bagpipes,

My Personal Top 5 Episodes of this season are:

The One Where They're Up All Night

The One Where They All Turn Thirty

The One with Joey's New Brain

The One with the Cheap Wedding Dress

The One with Monica and Chandler's Wedding

Yes, some episodes were better than others and some plotlines were tedious, but I still thought this was a great season.  The main theme of this season is the planning of Monica and Chandler's wedding, but there are many storylines scattered throughout, such as Rachel's romance with her assistant, Joey returning to Days of Our Lives, the brief return of Phoebe's scientist boyfriend, and Ross learning to play bagpipes.  This season will have you in stitches!

There was actually a glimmer of hope that Ross and Rachel might get back together but they turned it into a 'false-alarm' One of my most fav episodes will have to be TOW They All Turn 30. It showed a little more mature them (except for Joey. Childish as usual) and flashbacks of Monica, Chandler, Joey, Phoebe and Ross' birthdays. Although my most favorite 'SCENE' would have to be from TOW Joey's New Brain where Ross plays his bagpipe to Monica, Chandler, Rachel and Phoebe. It was the funniest, and you could see Jen cracking up while Phoebe sang (or more 'screeched' along) with the bagpipe. And I always like wedding days in sitcoms, because there'll always be problems involved. If you want to laugh your head off, then you just have to buy this season of Friends.

1985185,3,B0001AW066,"Yes, yes, I still own Friends 7th season.  However it is definitely just to complete the 10 season set.  As in the title, I lost interest in this great sitcom after this season.  Of course I rekindled my interest when I started collecting the DVD's when they were released, and thankfully seasons 8, 9, and 10 did not follow this disappointing trend of mundaneness that season 7 (and a little of 6) had.

This season loses touch with what made the sitcom so great...variety that involves all six characters in episodes that are fresh and just plain funny.  Sure, there usually is a theme that runs over each season, and some may argue about Ross and Rachel's love saga being repeatative and annoying.  However, their acting chemistry is just so good and their love/hate relationship has been written and acted out so cleverly that I never felt bored.

The whole Monica and Chandler build-up to their engagement in series 6 was painful enough, but to drag out the wedding plans for an entire season was just a little too much for me.
Thank goodness for the few scattered gem episodes like Ross and Joey's napping episode or this series would have received 1 star from me...it's that bad.

Compare season 2 (in my opinion the best) to this and you will be at opposite ends of the spectrum when it comes to comic variety with six funny and loveable characters.  Just curious...what ever happened to THAT Chandler?!",1119744000,2,1411,4.680161943319838
1985186,5,B0001AW066,"Season 7 is probably known to the Friends fan community as the dark years probably until Season 10 came along. Everything plunged all at the same time, the ratings, the hype, creativity, personal lives of the cast (Matthew Perry's addiction), and that show called Survivor: Australian Outback. But of course I have to mention that the season was doomed from the very start because critics are already panning the season because they anticipated that the season would be populated by the predictable wedding preparation plotlines for Chandler and Monica's wedding and it didn't help that the season did focus too much to it.

But years have passed and people can now view Season 7 without the distraction and preconceptions and I myself think it is a hugely underrated season. Standout episodes have to be TOW Monica's Thunder, TOW Rachel's Assistant, TOW the Nap Partners (very funny, bridesmaid competition), TOW They All Turn Thirty (hugely entertaining episodes, Lisa Kudrow especially stole all scenes she was in), TOW Joey's New Brain, TOW Monica and Ross' Cousin, and the big finale TOW Chandler and Monica's wedding.

A lot of people think that Matt le Blanc was the MVP of Season 7 and they could be right. But personally I think Season 7 is one the most ensemble-based seasons of Friends, nobody took really the spotlight. Everybody got a fine share of episodes like Jennifer Aniston in TOW Rachel's Book, David Schwimmer in TOW Monica and Ross' Cousin, Lisa Kudrow in TOW they all turn thirty and TO the Cheesecakes, le blanc in TOW Monica's Thunder and Cox and Perry in TOW Chandler and Monica's Wedding.

Compared to other seasons of Friends, season 7 is probably still the weakest but that doesn't say much because the show at it's weakest still delivers superb episodes.

Winner of innumerable television awards, the show features the lives of six friends in their late-twenties/early-thirties living in New York City - Monica Geller (Courteney Cox), Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow), Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston), Ross Geller (David Schwimmer), Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc), and Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry). The six friends spend the majority of their time in a coffee house named ""Central Perk"" or in either Monica's apartment or Joey and Chandler's apartment.

The Friends (Season 7) DVD offers a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere in which all of the friends toast Monica and Chandler's engagement. In later episodes Monica discovers that her grandmother's secret cookie recipe is the recipe for Nestle Tollhouse cookies, Chandler expresses his overwhelming fear of dogs, and Dr. Drake Ramoray makes his return on Days Of Our Lives...

1985188,5,B0001AW066,"This season picks up on the night Monica and Chandler got engaged. They all plan to go out to The Ritz for drinks, in celebration of Monica and Chandler's love. But while everyone is in the midst of getting dressed, Monica finds Rachel and Ross kissing each other passionately, right outside Monica's apartment. The kiss was initiated by a little flirtation between the two. Monica becomes angered, for she feels that Rachel is trying to steal Monica's thunder.

Meantime, Rachel, who has been working at Ralph Lauren for almost two years now, has been made an executive in her department. Not only is she a big exec, she has also been made part of the hiring team, where she is allowed to hire an assistant for herself. She has two interviews for the job. The first is a woman named Hilda, who is more than qualified for the job. Rachel is considering giving the job to Hilda, until she meets her second interview: Tag Jones. Tag is 25 year old inexperienced business office worker, but Rachel is completely breathtaken by his naturally good looks. She ponders over it with Chandler and Phoebe, who tell her that the right thing to do is to hire Hilda because she is qualified for the job. But hires Tag instead. Phoebe meets Tag and is a little surprised at Rachel, where she tells her that because he is now her assistant, she cannot get involved with him. Meantime, Monica and Chandler discuss how it is important to tell each other their secrets. Chandler tells Monica how Ross had a certain accident while on Space Mountain in Disney World. Monica decides to Ross finds out about Monica knowing, leading Ross to tell Monica that, while he and Ross were in a bar, back in college, Chandler met a woman and began kissing her. It is revealed that it wasn't a woman, but a man.

In another episode, while working in her restaurant's kitchen, Monica runs into none other than...Janice. They catch up on how they are doing until Janice spots the ring on Monica's finger. Monica tells Chandler about who she ran into. Monica reveals that Janice is dating a guy named Clark and that, ""...she also kind of invited herself to the wedding."". Chandler gets upset, but Monica didn't know what to do. Chandler says that it would have been much easier to lie. Monica reveals that he can lie to her on Saturday night because he and Monica are going to dinner with Janice and Clark. They try to stop her from coming to the wedding by telling her that no friends are invited and that it is strictly family. But Janice twists that around in thinking that they consider her to be family. Later, Janice stops by and asks to spend the night with them, for she is touched at thinking that they look at her as family. But Monica finally gets her to leave the apartment and not show up at the wedding by lying in saying that Chandler still has feelings for her. Meanwhile, Joey has a one-night stand with a girl named Erin. He has Rachel tell her that he is not looking for a relationship, but Rachel and Phoebe warms up to her. Rachel and Phoebe persuade Joey to give her a chance, for they really like Erin.

On Thanksgiving, Rachel invites Tag over, for he had just broken up with his girlfriend. She figures that this may be her chance to tell Tag how she feels about him. She finally tells him out on the terrist, but he finds that his car is being stolen. Phoebe reveals that she has a dog in her room named Clunkers. The dog belongs to a couple of friends of Phoebe's and she volunteered to watch him, while they were on vacation, but Chandler reveals that he is afraid of dogs. Chandler has also taught the gang a game, where you have to try and write down all 50 states in six minutes. That does not sound like a problem, but here's the catch, you have to write them down from memory. Ross tries it and gets all 50, but Chandler finds that Ross forget four states, where he tells Ross that if he does not figure out the last four states, he gets no dinner. Rachel and Tag talk about their conversation, leading them into a dating relationship.

The season ends with Monica and Chandler's wedding. Chandler's much mentioned, but never before-seen, father, Charles Bing is invited to the wedding. Chandler takes off in fear of getting married. Ross finds him and helps him feel better, but Chandler finds out from Rachel and Phoebe that Monica is pregnant. Monica reveals that she is not, but who is? Who is pregnant? ...Rachel.

Buy the complete seventh season and you'll find yourself getting a seventh surgery, repairing your split sides. You'll all enjoy it. Guest stars include: Denise Richards, Susan Sarandon, Hank Azaria, Gabrielle Union, Wynonna Ryder, Gary Oldman, Jason Alexander, Morgan Fairchild, Christina Pickles, Elliott Gould, & Kathleen Turner.

1985190,5,B0001AW066,"As a huge fan of the show Friends, I just had to get FRIENDS: THE COMPLETE SEVENTH SEASON on DVD when it came out. I own the first seven seasons, and they are some of the best DVDs I own.

Funniest episodes of FRIENDS: THE COMPLETE SEVENTH SEASON are:

*The One with Phoebe's Cookies - Any episode with a story based on Phoebe's childhood/family is going to be hilarious, and this one doesn't disappoint. Phoebe's grandma left her the recipe to her top-secret, best-ever chocolate chip cookies, but Phoebe loses the recipe in a fire. Her and Monica go on a mission to recreate the cookies, which ends up with a hilariously ironic conclusion. My favorite episode of the season.

*The One where Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs - When Phoebe tries to hide a dog in Monica and Chandler's apartment, the gang finds out Chandler's big secret: he hates dogs. This is one of those episodes that you can quote over and over again, with hilarious bits of dialogue (such as: ""You don't like ice cream?"" ""It's too cold!"").

*The One with the Holiday Armadillo - All the holiday episodes of Friends are great, and this one is one of the best. Ross wants to teach Ben about Chanukah, and he decides to dress up to make Ben more interested. Somehow he ends up dressed as a giant armadillo, which is worth a ton of laughs.

Every episode on FRIENDS: THE COMPLETE SEVENTH SEASON is hilarious. You get to see Chandler and Monica get married, Monica becomes known as the ""candy lady,"" and everyone turns 30/talks about their thirtieth birthdays.

1985202,4,B0001AW066,"Warner Brothers has delivered a nice package in the Season 7 Friends DVDs but it could have more.  The episodes aired completely uncut with added footage are enjoyable, and the gag reel is fun.  The commentaries are my favorite, they provide such great insight into the 'heart' of the show and what it  was to create it.  I only wish we could've gotten a commentary by any of the cast members, particulary Jennifer, who did such a great one on ""The Good Girl"". However, Marta Kauffman, Kevin Bright and David Crane are just as good.

The rest of the set lacks in subtance.  Screen tests, storyboards, interviews & original scripts would have been welcome additions.  Friends was such a phenomenon on television, its a shame to not see more promotional material and behind-the-scenes bits. Perhaps on the 10th season DVD?

I bought the set for the episodes because they are the core of the show. The funny, the dramatic, the silly.  The moments we know so well.  And there are plenty of them..from Joey's new role, to Monica's thunder to Rachel's sapphic experience, they're all here.",1099440000,3,1083,4.774193548387097

Compare Chandler in # 7 to the character in past seasons:  where is the sarcasm, the quick wit, the all-around humor?

The main focus is the buildup to the wedding, which involves buying cheap wedding dresses, a maid of honor, an uninvited (gasp!) Janice, and famous tuxes. There are many episodes not about the wedding including, in my opinion, the BEST episode of season seven: The One Where They All Turn Thirty. Of course (Spoiler warning of season eight) there HAS to be some Rachel and Ross. We find out in the last episode that sometime during season seven Ross and Rachel sleep together and conceive (accidentally) Emma.

The seventh season is by far one of my favorites, my all time favorite episode is "" The One With Chandler's Dad.""  It is the one show that my mother and I can agree to watch.  My Thursday nights were booked for watching Friends until its untimely end last season.  The charecters are all independant of each other but don't seem to do their best work unless they are all together. The plot lines are not an impossibilty and do to some extent happen to everyday people.  So what if some see them as yuppie Manhattenites, someone has to be.

1985240,4,B0001AW066,"This is a good season, but my opinion is suspicious, because I like them all. Anyway, it's impossible to not notice how this season is inferior to 1-6.
Altough I'm a great fan, I am not fanatic. Unlike some reviewers and FRIENDS fans in general, I would never make the mistake of confounding the characters with the actors. The characters, I love them, and that's why I like the show. The actors, I don't give a sh...t. (of course, they don't give a sh..it about me also).Why?
Because it's clear they just realized they hit the jackpot and all of them were on a race to squeeze the greatest quantity of money possible while the show lasted. They were spoiled by NBC and Warner in a way no sitcom star ever was.
In interviews (like the recent Jay Leno's Tonight Show, the day of the last episode, or even in Oprah) all the cast have an extremely annoying aloof attitude towards the interview. They don't seem interested at all in the questions, of giving new information, of enjoying it (Schwimmer being the most boring of them, and Le Blanc the more friendly - but one can not say if that's because he knows he will remain at the spotlight with his spin-off ""Joey"" and still need ""audience acceptance""....)
They are rich and they really live like extremely rich people, all with buying houses that cost more than three million dollars, and I've never heard any donation or charity work made by them.
As another reviewer put it, the fact that, up until now, there are simply NO interviews or introduction by ANY of the six cast members can show only indifference.
That's it. I enjoy the product,not the actors.",1086048000,2,1609,4.570934256055363

I really care to hear those things on a page reserved for sensible reviews based on a product one may even know something about.  I really care that Seinfeld is apparently so much better.  I really care that your wasting your time sending rediculous comments and debating a television show using posted reviews.  That's really constructive of you.
Enough with that sarcasm.  This is probably my favorite season of the show, despite some apparent behind the scenes issues, I personally think this is the season that sort-of reinvented the show.  Maybe it was just the fact that I can name a dozen things I didn't like about season 6, but it may also be that season 7 was just that good.  The guests in this season are among the best, Gary Oldman is simply hilarious in his brief role in the season finale.  Highly recommended.",1084924800,3,902,4.7006369426751595

1985264,3,B0001AW066,"I stopped watching Friends after the second season, when I started working in high school and became interested in other things.  Thankfully, my spouse's interest in the series resulted in us buying every season on DVD, and I was quite surprised to find a very, very good show.
Season 7, while containing many highlights, ranks least among the Friends seasons currently in release (1-7).  Although I recommend it heartily to any fan, I would caution anyone considering this Season to be their first Friends purchase (either start at 1 or 4).
Some comments:
1.  For whatever reason (health, addiction, or possibly bad writing), Matthew Perry is not in full form this season.  In fact, during the season opener, he appears to have some trouble either physically speaking or remembering his lines (he has no timing in this episode).  Luckily, he gets better, and by the third episode, appears to be back in form.  However, as a character, it appears the writers decided to focus away from him and eliminate his one-liners (odd, considering the end-of-the-year wedding would seem to put him in the forefront).  As is, he is now playing straight man to the other five, when the opposite should be true.  Perhaps the writers knew of his personal problems and thought he could not handle that role.  My understanding is that this improves in Season 8, so hopefully Chandler really becomes Chandler again.
2.  Because the season seems singularly focused on Monica/Chandler's wedding, the writing is more frequently on autopilot in this season.  To compensate, there is a deluge of star cameos.  Unfortunately, the cameos work about half the time (Jason Alexander, yes; Denise Richards, no).  Kathleen Turner plays an important relative to a primary character (I won't spoil it for you)...however, despite designing an entire episode for her (as well as a significant part of the finale), her role is underwritten severely.  Considering the nature of her character, they could have used her better (and funnier), and her appearance, while a shrewd choice, is disappointing.  As always, Christina Pickles and Elliot Gould do a wonderful job as Ross and Monica's parents; they have probably been the best ""recurring cameos"" in television history.
3.  The finale is poorly conceived.  Our knowledge of Chandler would expect him to get cold feet.  What do the writers do?  Fulfill our expectations and give him cold feet.  Wouldn't it have made more sense to have Chandler be perfectly fine with the wedding...yet, write or do something to make all the others THINK he was losing it?  As is, this is a ho-hum episode until the final five minutes...when the inevitable occurs (in a well-done fashion) and a key secret is revealed.  However, this falls even with Season 3 as probably the worst final episode of friends.
Despite these pitfalls, Season 7 had its moments:
1.  The One with the Holiday Armadillo.  This is, by far, the best Friends episode ever written (up to the end of Season 7).  Its concept is wonderfully conceived (and relevant, considering the growing number of Jewish--non-Jewish parent couples)...and its execution is hilarious...downright hilarious.  This is the episode that, when I saw it in syndication, renewed my interest in Friends and caused me to buy the first season on DVD.
2.  Matt Le Blanc.  Perhaps in order to make up for Matthew Perry's decreased function as a character, Joey became much stronger.  Season 7 is Joey's time to shine.  His character became both funnier and more complex (watch him in The One with All the Cheesecakes...as he and Phoebe's friendship becomes temporarily strained).  This season established Matt Le Blanc as more than a lucky, prettyboy actor with a role that simply matches his personality...Joey became flesh and blood in this season.
Overall: 3 out of 5 stars.  Not a good first Friends DVD purchase, but worthwhile for fans and collectors...if you have the first 6, might as well get this one too.",1083715200,5,3954,5.007656967840735

I have seasons 1-7 so far and I will buy them all, but I honestly think it is missing one thing. The Cast! You may not agree with me or you may. Either way it must be said. I am a collector of T.V. season sets, I have a lot of them. When ""Will & Grace"" came out with their first season set, they were on it, introducing the set. You could tell they were proud. Unfortunately, in all the Friends sets, they chose not to come on them. I take this personal. It says to me, they probably wanted a lot of money to do this. I am not saying they shouldn't get paid for it but it does show you they could care less about their Fans. Sad, but, true. I really don't want to believe that but the facts are the facts. They could at least show up on them for only 10 minutes. We have Marta Kaufman, who I am sure is proud of the show but she seems like she is a name dropper who likes to pretend like she is closer to the cast than she probably is. And, I am sure she laughs at EVERYTHING!! they do. That's the way it is when you like to think you matter. Oh,well, it's just an observation. All I am saying is  when the 10th season comes out on DVD,someone from the cast should show up and give the Fans what they deserve, stop sending Gunther out to do your intro's. Courtney seems like she would do it, she seems kinder than the rest. Stop all the fluff, some of us notice these things! I really am going to miss the show.
