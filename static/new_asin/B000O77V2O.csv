8596184,1,B000O77V2O,"I purchased the Wiggles' Wiggledancing DVD only to learn that it does not play on any DVDs meant for the U.S.A.  So if I lived in Australia it would be great.  It's a shame they don't let the buyer know that during the purchase process.  I paid over $38.00 with shipping, and have nothing to show for it.  I cannot return it because it was opened, but I could not know it wasn't meant for the U.S.A. unless I opened it.  I am finished buying from Amazon.",1278028800,,454,4.172413793103448
8596185,5,B000O77V2O,"This was the first DVD of The Wiggles I bought for my 2-year-old son. That was 1 month ago and he already knows all the steps to the songs and watches it every day. He wants all his friends to see it with him and he's become such a fan (we're Spanish and he doesn't understand English yet). The Wiggles might seem a bit awkward at first but they are incredibly professional, great musicians, dancers, great with kids and Sam is such a good singer. I totally recommend it. It's a Christmas concert so it's the best moment to get it!",1194825600,,531,4.267326732673268
