8088626,4,B000BLI5R8,"Viva la Muerte is among the best films i have watched, there is a scene which is pure surreal, the one with the bull killed, it is so poetical, there are another movies which in order to shock shows animals killed like Cannibal Holocaust in order to give a continuation to the movie.
There are more great things about this movie, but this is one of the scenes that impact me for its beauty.

I Will Walk Like A Crazy Horse is good, not as much as Viva la Muerte, yet with shocking images.

finally, The Guernica Tree is based upon the attack at that place during the spanish civil war in 1937.",1192492800,4,593,4.238938053097345
8088627,4,B000BLI5R8,"Fernando Arrabal is a poor man's Jodorowsky, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  Arrabal's films don't have the many layers that Jodorowsky's films do, but there are always excellent moments in them.  Viva La Muerte is the best of the 3 films here.  Viva takes place during the brutal repressive Franco regime, and it's very critical of Franco and the Catholic church in particular.  Some scenes in Viva are truly startling, including a woman dancing around in steer's blood (the animal is slaughtered on screen), and a priest being castrated and feeding himself the object of his castration, so to speak.  I Will Walk Like a Crazy Horse has some great scenes, but overall it seems like warmed over Jodorowsky, and a strange emphasis on coprography in some scenes.  It is also quite obvious in its theme of nature vs. civilization.  The Guernica Tree is the weakest of the bunch, with very little of Arrabal's surrealism.  It's mostly a political film, and unless you're into Spanish politics, you probably won't understand it or enjoy it.  It makes some good points about speaking out against repressive regimes, but it's not particularly moving when it should be.  And there are some silly scenes just done for shock value.  It does, however, have a spiritual, beautiful ending, which makes it worth seeing.  Is the box set worth buying?  Probably not, because only Viva is really worth owning.  But all of the films are worth seeing at least once.",1179100800,7,1452,4.873469387755102
8088628,2,B000BLI5R8,"I am a huge fan of surrealism, but these three movies pale in comparison to to some of the work of Arrabal's contemporaries. The images are interesting (at times), but the plots are boring and filled with pseudo-political massages and personal frustrations from what seem likes millenia ago. These 3 movies haven't aged well. I was disappointed by this set.",1161302400,4,357,4.966666666666667
