8627495,5,B00GTX9EL8,"This instructional DVD from Carrie Biggers of Carrie's Cakes is a clear and concise course in fondant making, covering cakes with fondant, and decorating using chocolate clay.  Carrie demonstrates all in this professionally recorded DVD.  All recipes are included-the handmade fondant tastes better and covers cakes better than anything else available commercially.  My own skills are much improved after applying what I learned in this DVD.",1387411200,,441,5.651515151515151
