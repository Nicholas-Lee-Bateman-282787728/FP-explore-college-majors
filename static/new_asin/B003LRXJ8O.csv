4153649,5,B003LRXJ8O,"I first saw this movie when TCM ran it during Black History Month. It was on late one night. I missed the very beginning of the film and watched the rest and was very pleased with the movie. I found it on Amazon and I purchased it. The movie is exactly how it was shown on TCM and I was pleased to know that I had only missed about the first 10 mins. of the movie.  There is no rating for this movie so I just wanted to let people know that there is profanity in the movie, all the typical curse words although the ""F"" bomb is only used twice.  There is no nudity which is great because I did show this movie to my two daughters.",1332633600,8,629,3.90625
4153650,5,B003LRXJ8O,"For a start I was surprised that I couldn't find this one on Amazon.com since I started collecting Blax film over 5 years ago. I remember seeing it on syndicate TV back in the early 80's...maybe. I'm not sure exactly when it was. Anyway, I say it's underrated because for a start, it has the late Ms.  Claudia McNeil, the late Mr. Brock Peters, and Ms. Leslie Uggams in the cast. So already you know the acting is fierce! The other cast members give amazing star-quality performances as well. The movie was well-written, following on a positive theme-not seen often in the ""Blaxploitaion"" genre. I had seen this movie originally on Flix, and promised myself that I would look for it. After some time looking online with no success, I actually stumbled across it at a mall kiosk that seemed to specialize in hard-to-find movies. I think this movie should be more available, because it's a good one!",1321228800,22,897,4.677215189873418
4153651,4,B003LRXJ8O,"I began watching this movie on television a couple of years ago. I did not see the beginning of it, so when I saw that it was available to purchase I quickly ordered it. The movie was made in 1972 and the clothing,cars,and hairstyles reflect that era. the main theme in the movie is you should never give up on your dreams and you can overcome obstacles put in your path. the movei starred Brock Peters, Leslie Uggams, Claudia McNeil( you may remember here from the original Raisin in the Sun), Paula Petitt who gives an amazing performance as Billie Jean. There was also a cameo appearance by Ruby Dee. This movie is worth watching. The only issue I had with this movie is the picture quality was okay, but then again the movie was made in 1972.",1315785600,11,746,4.413043478260869
4153652,4,B003LRXJ8O,"I remember seeing this movie a few years back with my sister. She really introduced me to films from the 70s era and this movie happened to be one of them. I never caught it from the beginning and always wanted to see it again but it never came back on TV. I had searched for this movie for a while and it never seemed to surface. I'd ask people if they had heard of it, and was beginning to think it was all in my head but amazon had it surprisingly. I have yet to sit down and watch it but Im hoping that it is as good as I assumed it was then.",1313193600,9,546,3.756521739130435

4153674,5,B003LRXJ8O,"Seen on local tv show, never heard of it and had to buy it.  Well worth the investment.  I'm very surprise the actors were primarily one hit wonder.  In this case a no hitter.  Excellent movie, I somewhat compare to Precious.",1384473600,,225,4.414634146341464

4153678,5,B003LRXJ8O,"I remember seeing this movie when it first came out back  in the early 70's, I was only 11 yrears old. My syblings an I grew up goin to the movies (movie threaters and drive-ins).  I remember loving this movie because back in the day dark skin was seen as being a negative, but i always saw the beauty in it, and the movie drew me in from the begin. The feature song stuck in my mind forever, ""Black girl, preety little girl, you've been in the sunshine much too long..."" I looked for years, off and on, for it and could not find it. It played on TV1 years back and I missed it because that network was not offered in my area, I began searching for it. Thank God for today's technology and internet, I've found it. YAY!!!!!

4153679,5,B003LRXJ8O,"I remember this movie and I really liked it. In a lot of families black, white, and etc the momma made the daughter marry or move out of the house when she gets pregnant or quit school. This is a very good movie it touches what really happens in single parent household with troubled children and frustrated adults.",1367452800,,315,4.448275862068965
4153680,1,B003LRXJ8O,"Black girl is a 70s movie that seems to have gotten lost in the shuffle when it comes to 70s black cinema. Definitely a must see. As for the quality........not so good. I don't know what type of machine was used to reproduce this for dvd, but it not very good. Volume was very low the entire movie. Picture was so fuzzy that the title couldn't be read. Very poor quality.",1347580800,12,371,4.23943661971831
4153681,5,B003LRXJ8O,"I remember seeing this movie late at night on cable and looked everywhere to find it. I remembered seeing a interview on the Tavis Smiley show with Ruby Dee and I decided to write him to ask her if this movie will be released on DVD since her husband (now deceased) Ossie Davis directed the movie. I got a response saying that the request ""didn't fall on deaf ears"" so I just chucked it up as a general response. But before I knew it, Black Girl was released on DVD. I think the acting is great especially from Billie Jean's sisters. This movie fell under the radar but needs to be a part of the other great 70's movies. It's short, but it is so culturally authentic.",1343174400,2,667,4.25984251968504

8399784,3,B003LRXJ8O,"This is not a great film.  The storylines don't resolve and some of the acting is very indie.  However, there are one or two very powerful and well portrayed scenes.  Not as bad as John Waters.  Not as good as ""A Raisin In The Sun"".  Not as entertaining as Jerry Springer.  Not as claustrophobic as ""The Glass Menagerie"".",1505088000,,321,4.448275862068965
