1843788,4,B00008G8MP,"I was stationed at RCAF Alert several decades before this event but knew some of the crew. Alert is the most northern occupied settlement in the world and is used nowdays to listen in on Russian submarine movements. They shot the film near Edmonton AB, which is about 3,000 miles south of Alert and with a completely different terrain. Having said that, they did a pretty good job of showing just how harsh conditions can be. My understanding is that the Chamberlain character was somewhat overdone as far as the guilt thing, but overall it's worth the watch.",1234224000,4,559,4.714285714285714
1843789,5,B00008G8MP,We have looked for this movie for awhile. Our kids remember it from long ago and loved it. I believe it is a true story but even if not it could have happened and the events are certainly believable. Good choice for our family.,1232150400,3,227,4.181818181818182
7982852,5,B00008G8MP,"I really like this film. Many details fit with my experience: the conversation between the waiting tired passengers, the friendly smalltalk between the staff, the noise in the plane and how the passengers try to make themselves comfortable, the routine that can (and does) make careless, the desperation of the captain who feels responsible and wants to prevent any more deaths...
It was all played well and without exaggerating.
At some points of the story I would have liked to tell the acting persons to think a moment before they do something. But as the film is based on a real crash  this can't be helped. Anyway perhaps the desperate fight against the cold would have kept anybody from thinking longer.
I would have liked to know the reason(s) of the crash. The film leaves this out - for the people trying to survive in the cold this isn't important, so it is correct for the film to ignore this. I'd like to know anyway!
Most impressive for me:The pictures of the frozen landscape gave me a shiver even in a warm livingroom and the music is really really haunting.",1522108800,,1073,4.647368421052631

7982861,5,B00008G8MP,"Better than John Wayne's 1953 film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Island-in-the-Sky/dp/B000ITIFAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Island in the Sky</a>&nbsp;this movie also details how despite the best efforts of rescuers people suffer and die of exposure above the Arctic Circle.  The film is based on the true story of a Canadian Hercules aircraft crashing near Alert, Nunavut in October 1991.  Alert remains the northernmost permanently inhabited town in the world.  In the movie, the pilot switches from Instrument Flight Rules to Visual Flight Rules on approaching the runway.  Unfortunately, the plane pancakes into snowdrifts on descent.  The actors and actresses make you feel the cold.  Recommended.
