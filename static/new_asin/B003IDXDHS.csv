8397344,2,B003IDXDHS,"This DVD about BBQing disappoints.  I can get recipes in my many, many cookbooks.  I was really hoping to learn HOW TO BBQ without drying out the meat or whether there are different ways of handling different meats when grilling, etc.  This was just a DVD showing different recipes....plus it didn't come with a booklet containing the recipes, so you would have to hurry up and write down the ingredients and the amounts while watching!  Also, why give us a recipe for duck?  That isn't a common meat people BBQ often!  It appears that the recipes provided would be delicious, and the man in the DVD is entertaining and enthusiastic.  The Title is misleading as it promises an ""education"" in BBQing!",1374624000,2,699,4.7272727272727275

8397348,4,B003IDXDHS,This DVD is a great collection of recipes and techniques even for a beginner.  Steve is great about going step by step explaining exactly what he means and how to do it!  It is a little fuzzy on measurements.  I thought maybe the recipes would show up at the bottom of the screen as he was preparing the dish but they do not and some he says the amount but other recipes it is never mentioned.  That was a bit disappointing and difficult!  But overall a very well made DVD with 3 hours of content.,1309910400,6,497,4.189473684210526
8397349,3,B003IDXDHS,"the video is fun to watch & i learned some good things abt grilling & how to do certain things.  My only real gripe is that the recipes included w the dvd that are stored in its files in pdf don't match the recipes on the video itself.  I tried doing the babyback ribs w the dry rub & i was thoroughly confused with what to do.  I have his bbq bible too which has the same recipe but even there it was different than what was on the video  AND w what was on the pdfs.  It was the same w the recipe used to make the mop sauce - the bible called for 2 cups of vinegar but the dvd only called for maybe a half-cup, if that.

Nevertheless, the babyback ribs came out incredibly delicious & the dry rub i concocted from the 3 recipes was incredibly flavorful.  I got a lot of compliments.  I'm glad i got it.",1309392000,4,803,3.9135802469135803
8397350,5,B003IDXDHS,"Steve is the king of bbq and everything you can think of to cook on a grill he has done perfectly! This dvd will show you how to cook like a pro in no time, My favorite is the ribs.
