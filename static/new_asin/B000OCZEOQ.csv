8184654,4,B000OCZEOQ,"this particular rumba dance lesson is the ""international style of rumba"".  so forewarned that this is not the traditional american standard rumba steps.  also this is the vhs version.  i don't know if the dvd version has the same content.  this vhs version was obviously crudely made using a home videocam and the lighting in the living room is rather dim to clearly view the instructors since they were just using lampshades (ugh!).  but you get your money's worth on the brighter side because this video has loads of steps you can adopt to your repertoire.  i could have rated this 5 stars but only gave 4 due to the poor quality of the picture which was very dim.",1318204800,,666,4.554621848739496
8184655,4,B000OCZEOQ,"Two DVD's, each one-hour long.
Disk one covers basic patterns.
Disk two is for intermediate and advanced dancers.

Problem: No music, just a horrible beat clock timing, with drives me nuts.  Where is the sample rumba music?
Disk one is too slow and boring. Rumba should have some life to it. I can easily fall asleep watching the first disk. Very slow pacing on the first DVD. On the second DVD the pace picks up, and is a little less boring.
The second DVD has some good patterns, which can be used in Cha-Cha, and other dances. Some Rumba instructional DVD's sold at Amazon are only an hour long, with the instructors talking endlessly. These are not overly talkative.

I recommend this Rumba DVD. They are good reinforcement for what you learn in a dance studio and an addition to your dance lessons. For me, they are a good to review now and then.

Still a lifeless DVD, but has some good instruction. NEEDS MUSIC!! January 11, 2012.",1245715200,2,937,4.559523809523809
8184656,3,B000OCZEOQ,"This is one of four DVDs I've bought now on learning the rumba, this being the most expensive.  I learned things from this one, but am not sure it was worth as much as it cost.

Pro:  extremely thorough coverage.  If you're a beginner and there's anything, I mean anything at all that you're having trouble ""getting"", it's probable explained somewhere here in great detail.

DVD chapters are set up so you can skip through to see what you want, it's nice and easy to navigate.

They cover a reasonable number of patterns and the instruction is good but --

Con:  they go veeery slow through the instruction of each pattern.  So slow that you can forget what dance pattern they're trying to teach you.

Quite a few of the patterns they teach are only slight variations on basic patterns.  Somehow the instructors seem near-lifeless and I was literally falling asleep before they'd get done trying to teach one, simple little pattern.

On the up side, if you learn fast, you can watch them do the beginning demo for each pattern and then skip forward on the DVD to the next step.  But be prepared for a dance lesson that kind of sounds like a math lecture.  There is no music in the lessons, only drums, but it's adequate for instruction.

All in all, I did learn things from this that were not covered on the other DVDs, and you get more run time out of this set than any other two DVDs combined.  But a lot of the run time isn't doing me any good because they teach at such a slow pace (by far, the slowest teaching pace I've seen anywhere yet).",1226016000,2,1545,4.387323943661972
