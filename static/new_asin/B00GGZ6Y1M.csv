This is a biography of Tina Turners struggles from her musical beginnings with Ike and the trials and tribulations she experienced before she finally and rightfully so became a superstar unmatched to this day but by only a few other female performers. Do not expect to see tons of concert footage as this is a biography of mostly personal experiences. There are clips of Tinas performances thru her astonishing career but again it is more of interviews with people who was in Tinas life during her beginning until her present. Some of the information given in some of the interviews
may not be 100% satisfactory to the most die hard Tina Turner fans but the interviews in this disc are new information and not the same stories that havealready been played on every network over and over many times. If you enjoy Tina Turners music that has evolved over more than 5 decades I think you will enjoy watching this biography and adding it to your DVD collection.",1481241600,,1020,4.640883977900552
8622953,1,B00GGZ6Y1M,"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS VIDEOBIOGRAPHY OF TINA TURNER!!!!!! The material on the DVD, is nothing whatsoever that is promised in the product description, nor what is promised on the cover of the DVD!!!!!!  The videos that it states to be included are not on the DVD, and the so called EXPERTS that are interviewed discussing Tina Turner's life, don't even have their facts right, and some are blatantly wrong!!!!  It's obvious there was NO FACT CHECKING done prior to completing the finished product!!!!!!  I am returning this piece of garbage for a refund!  Arlette",1391558400,10,561,4.9361702127659575
