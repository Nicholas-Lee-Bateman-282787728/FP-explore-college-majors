1) I'm only doing these reviews to give the ep 5 stars; I will give EVERY ep 5 stars as a nod to the general greatness of WNTW. I admit I'm biased. (But really, if the knowledge, fun, and drama aren't enough, the brilliance and wit of Stacy and Clinton push every ep to a 5 anyway.)
2) While I don't have time for big writeups on each DVD, a few observations: Really enjoyed this ep's matrimonial motif; it provided an excellent change of pace (something WNTW often did). Sociologically, it was interesting watching Yesenia bond with her mother-in-law, which didn't seem possible off the jump (yikes!). One could actually feel the whole wedding party pulling together, and as for the big event, well, I'm a sucker for a marriage ceremony. Stylistically, even though the shopping was for fancier pieces, there were still many tips about fit, color, etc. Now can we talk about how talented Stacy and Clinton are? The outfits shown during the rules were provided by wedding clothiers, but S and C had their own ideas about dresses the ladies should try and they were all beautiful. And, as they would do occasionally during the show's run, the dynamic (and competitive) duo split up on the shopping day, which was fascinating. I give Clinton an A for the groom's suit and the inspired choice of a tux jacket for the man of honor ... but I give Stacy an A plus, because not only did she find gorgeous dresses for the three ladies, under the gun she seamlessly reacted to the addition of black into the color scheme by among other things adding accessories. BTW, the call during which they discussed all this was hilarious - and not just because they were using flip phones! And let's not forget Nick and Carmindy, who took at least 10 years off each mother.
3) Oh yeah, the cost ... $19.95 for one ep? WTF! I'm a big enough fan of the show, and have the resources, to buy them. But do I see anybody else purchasing them? Nope. And does anyone have any ideas how I can get DVDs of eps from the middle seasons of this great show????",1464048000,,2300,4.439716312056738
