7905640,4,B000009Q6B,"FLYING DAGGER (1993) came out at a time when ""wire fu"" costume fantasies (in which the actors, hoisted on wires, fly back and forth during their swordplay/kung fu battles) were flooding the Hong Kong market (SWORDSMAN II, BUTTERFLY AND SWORD, KUNG FU CULT MASTER, DRAGON INN, etc.). It wasn't the first comedy in the genre, but it remains, arguably, the funniest of them, easily surpassing HANDSOME SIBLINGS and ROYAL TRAMP I & II. Boasting enough fighting & flying thrills to engage the action crowd, it's a typical HK melange of comedy, romance, fantasy, acrobatics, and swordplay, yet is very well put together and utterly delightful from start to finish.
It tells the story of a race by opposing teams of bounty hunters, Big Dagger and Little Dagger, and their female rivals, Big and Little Bewitchment, to track down wanted criminal Nine-Tails Fox and his wife, Flying Cat. Eventually the two teams join forces to bring the criminals to justice, only to find out that the wanted parties were framed by Master Lui who had initially hired Big and Little Dagger to pursue Fox. This all leads to a big battle at the end with seven good guys fighting Master Lui and his two super-powerful henchmen. In the course of it all, the male and female bounty hunters pair off romantically.
Hong Kong comedies are often hit-and-miss when it comes to actual laugh content, but this one is full of clever and inventive gags throughout. Some of the best gags involve the disembodied hand of ""Never Die,"" one of the villains the heroes encounter. After being chopped off, the hand lives on and chases the heroes, often grabbing them in spots they don't want grabbed, but eventually it becomes their ally and helps them out of rough spots. Think of ADDAMS FAMILY'S Thing as an action hero and you'll get the idea. And the trick effects are easily as seamless as those of the ADDAMS FAMILY.
The good-looking cast is full of top Hong Kong names, most notably Jacky Cheung (A BULLET IN THE HEAD) as Nine-Tails Fox and Maggie Cheung (IRMA VEP, IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE) as Flying Cat. This is easily one of Maggie's best action roles and ranks alongside her work in DRAGON INN. Tony Leung (also in DRAGON INN) and Sharla Cheung Man (ROYAL TRAMP) play the older bounty hunters who pair off, while the exceedingly cute ""little"" partners are played by Gloria Yip and Jimmy Lin, who bring to the film an attractive dose of youthful charm.",992649600,4,2412,4.718009478672986
7905641,4,B000009Q6B,"I would not hesitate to recommend this film to anyone who can overlook ridiculous plotting and laughable situations to concentrate on the main strength of this film, the incredible amount of FUN involved.
I've watched this film so many times and every time it just makes me crack up.  I mean, where else would you get a film that has shades of ""Evil Dead II"" with its dismembered hand running about attacking people and a decapitated invincible kung-fu master walking around bumping into things after losing his head, next to scenes of laughable comedy such as the character ""Nine Tails Fox"" who, armed with a long fluffy tail connected to his backside, can defeat enemies with his special move known as the ""Fox Farts"".  You can guess the rest and believe me silly does not even begin to cover it.
The plot follows the exploits of two brothers who are bounty hunters on the trail of a master criminal for a substantial reward.  The only problem is that they are not the only ones after the reward.  Two female witches make the inept bounty hunters lives a misery before they realise that the only way to catch the villain is to work together.  Various bizarre and surreal sub plots twist their way around the main storyline, making the film a little hard to follow in places, with people turning up out of the blue only serving to complicate matters even further.  But overall you cannot criticise the scriptwriters for coming up with something totally original and unpredictable.
The name ""Flying Dagger"" is appropriate as the over the top wirework has the characters spend more time in the air than they do on the ground.  These fight scenes are very well done if you like your fighting hyper kinetic with super speed editing and characters literally flying all over the place with amazing speed.  It all makes for a wonderful spectacle.  Blood flows freely in a totally over the top comic book fashion so it is hard to take it seriously.  The film couldn't be classed as gory as it always seems to be well balanced with the comedy scenes so the film never gets too dark.  Serious martial arts film purists may be put off by the light hearted tone of the picture, but if you're after a film that is fast, fun, hugely entertaining and completely surreal, you can't really go wrong with ""Flying Dagger"".",991008000,3,2304,4.650246305418719
