8436265,1,B004MWLY2A,Simply the worst gay film in a long time. Looks like someone's bad home movie. Annoying soundtrack and no plot of any sort. Why should anyone pay to see this film? Dont waste your time.,1309219200,7,185,4.314285714285714
8436266,1,B004MWLY2A,"Apparently I'm a stick-in-the-mud, an old-fashioned sort who wants plot and/or characters in a film.  ""XX"" strikes me as a self-indulgent film-school effort that must have been privately released by a vanity press.  The soundtrack is annoying, the characters (such as they are) uniformly unlikeable, the film grainy (yes yes, I'm sure that's an ""artistic effect,"" like leaving bits of eggshell in the omelet), any sort of ""plot"" missing altogether, and the whole thing largely unbearable, even on fast-forward (no, don't bother, nothing ever happens).  It even manages to make sex dull, which is no small achievement.  On the other hand, the filmmaker has finally pushed Richard Gere's KING DAVID out of my Number One Worst Movie Ever spot, which nobody else has achieved in the last 20 years, so I suppose that's something.  I don't even know anyone to GIVE this to.",1304380800,12,867,5.034965034965035
8436267,4,B004MWLY2A,"Todd Verow has done it again.
Using cutting edge techniques he has created an end of the world, sci-fi like look at life.
Told in 20 short clips the film lets the viewer see what life might be like if we were all facing the Armageddon.
As usual, central to his theme is how gay men will react, and he paints a very nihilistic picture of drugs, unsafe sex and utter abandon!
But in the end his message comes across with some light, that maybe we can survive as a race and a culture.
Not Todd's most narrative film, but due to be a classic.",1298851200,8,538,4.133333333333334
