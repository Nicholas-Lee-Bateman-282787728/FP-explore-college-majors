5322765,1,B009ES1M7Y,This was a waste of time boring . It's just a bunch of people talking about a serial killer . I want my 64 minutes back,1398297600,,119,3.6153846153846154
5322766,2,B009ES1M7Y,"This movie was truly one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time.  It came with a bunch of other DVDs in a  horror pack.  The description made it sound like a ghost hunters type movie, it was not.  First off there is no context to the film.  It's just a bunch of disconnected scenes that don't make a lot of sense.  There is a sheriff on the video telling the story and he is about the only person who speaks clearly and makes sense.  The sound quality is also very poor, some of the people are pretty much shouting and others are whispering and no attempt has been made to equalize the sound.  I was constantly having to turn it up, then turn it down.  It was really disappointing.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, especially not people who like ghost hunters, you will be very disappointed.",1398297600,4,810,4.269736842105263
5322767,5,B009ES1M7Y,"Definitely had some creepy moments throughout the film and sufficiently started ramping up the creep factor in the latter half. I learned a lot of jargon from this film (such as what EVP is) and while it was a really fascinating watch, it also did manage to spook the hell out of me while opening my eyes to a lot of things.  The length is just at the right time where it feels substantial enough and it won't overstay its welcome. If you have any interest in the real life paranormal occurrences (and not some overly dramatized Hollywood film, but the REAL deal), and especially if you live nearby the Midwest where this took place, then I highly recommend this.",1376265600,,663,4.525
5322768,2,B009ES1M7Y,"As many of the other reviewers have mentioned, this film is a very vanilla approach to a so-called, documentary about a haunting.  If you would like to really learn the true details of the notorious, 1996 events at the 18-acre, Fox Hollow Farm, including news footage, photos and all the forensic details about the American Serial Killer, Herb Baumeister's crimes, then see the Paranormal Witness television show's version of the story (Season 2, Episode 8), which includes the haunted happenings as told by the real-life, new owners and tenant of the property, post-Herb.  11 bodies were found on the property after Herb ended his own life and 9 others were found elsewhere. I am not easily scared but the Paranormal Witness re-telling of this particular story was both chilling and riveting.  The episode is right here on Amazon.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fox-Hollow-Farm/dp/B009HND0AS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fox Hollow Farm</a>",1373328000,35,983,5.86013986013986
5322769,1,B009ES1M7Y,"This is a very boring documentary of a bunch of psychics who visit the farm house of alleged serial killer Herb Baumeister, founder of the Sav-A-Lot thrift store chain in Indianapolis in 1988. Apparently Herb would pick up drunk gay men and bring them back to the farm and kill them in his indoor swimming pool, then bury them.

The crew uses an EVP to create unintelligent sounds which they are able to translate as voices. The highlight was when the hanging light moved a little. I had to chuckle when they brought in an ""independent"" psychic (apparently not one with the Psychic Network) who was able to feel something and she didn't know the history of the house! Of course if you go to great lengths to take a psychic anywhere they are going suspect a reason and feel something.

Unless you are a big fan of bad psychic entertainment, avoid this feature. Not worth watching for free.

Parental guide: No sex or nudity. Apparently the dead have a potty mouth and the f-word is something like F#$%.",1356998400,2,1001,4.581005586592179
5322770,2,B009ES1M7Y,This movie was more of a documentary of the horrors that happened at Fox Hollow Farm! I thought it was going to be more about the paranormal investigations themselves and it was more about the serial killer himself. I could have watched that on Investigation Discovery and saved my money!!,1351728000,2,289,4.8
5322771,5,B009ES1M7Y,"Review-I will tell you what, if this film is out to scare the sh*# out of you. It worked on that level, if this film is out to say it is a true occurrence and this is 100 percent fact, I am not a believer. This film runs around 64 minute and the first twenty go from night vision to camcorder to camera in seconds, just trying to cover as much ground as possible. Which is the main downfall of the first half to me, it just went back to forth, to forth to back without really building any characters. But, in the last 30 minutes with all the lights shut off and to follow what happens, it is just pure brilliance. This film scared me to the point I had to turn the light on at one point, and I am not scared easily. When the victim's voices start to be heard is when this film delivers on its promise. You are going to be creeped out and the best part is that the actors in the situations they are in are so believable that you and me would do and think the same stuff. The actors if they are actors all go by their real life names and claim to be this or that, but I still think they were actors playing a part.

This film does not dumb you down by giving you hokey ghosts or unbelievable attacks; it plays it smarts and makes it all seem so realistic. Dan Hall will sell me over and over that this is legit, but as scary and good as the stuff was towards the end, it just cannot be real. The only downfall to this very short film is the first half, which was so confusing and really trying to set up the second act, which was anything but confusing. The second act will make you believe in ghosts and spirits, if not just for that one moment. Obviously all people involved did their homework and made this film as authentic as they could.

 Some scary moments in this film, that are not physical or gore, but mental and makes the hair on your arm stand up. I have to watch this film again, it cannot be real. No way.",1349913600,5,1918,4.028871391076115
5322772,1,B009ES1M7Y,"I saw the new SyFy show Paranormal Witness and wanted to learn more about this home.  I am an Indianapolis resident and remember the news about this.

5322776,5,B009ES1M7Y,"Hall's film and retelling of this ""not so distant"" tragedy in Indianapolis is as much surreal as it is believable. A horrific ongoing series of murders, carried out by a man who preys on homosexuals, is investigated by psychics, paranormal experts, mediums and even a shaman. The first part of the film captures the background and tactics used by the serial killer and the second part the investigation of the area and residence around which the gruesome murders occurred.

5322781,2,B009ES1M7Y,"Very confusing beginning to this documentary. It takes about 10-15 minutes before the viewer can sort through what is going on. The movie repeats itself and relies on lots of audio effects. Certain discoveries in the movie have no resolution. Like what happened with the guy with the radar?

The EVP'S were ridiculously interpreted. Those ghost hunters should have been ashamed to put their names on this crapumentary at end. I can't see how they got work after it.

There was just nothing good to take away from this. All in all, a waste of an hour and 6 minutes.  I would give it less than one star if I could.

Baumeister committed suicide before he could be arrested or charged for the murders.

You get tiny spurts of some sort of narration that adds nothing to the flow of the film at all. Throughout the entire thing you have different people talking in this constant, rambling way. There is no uniformity of thought nor certain focal points to bring things together. Whether it's a psychic, a paranormal investigator, private investigator, or an eyewitness -- you cannot tell what one person is referencing apart from another. For example, the older private investigator with the mustache mumbled his dialogue and spoke constantly as if he was in mid-sentence. In fact, everyone seemed to speak in this slightly disinterested, matter-of-fact way. There was no ""first, on this date, at this time, etc."" to preface any statements before they were made -- something you would expect in a documentary. These things were certainly made worse by the atrocious editing.

The overall mood of the film became quite silly, namely, due to way too many paranormal cooks in the kitchen! Then there were the many bizarre and superfluous visual and audio effects, that really only served to irritate the viewer. The tone became comical as the host of psychic murmurings reached a dismal and overbearing height. It literally became a paranormal circus of one awful, annoying, bad-psychic clich after another!

5322966,1,B009ES1M7Y,"I wanted to like this ""documentary"" about a paranormal investigation into a serial murder case unfamiliar to me.  I can't give it the title of documentary however because all it appears to be is a bunch of randomly strung together bits of footage the producer thinks tells a story.  I found it disjointed and hard to follow.  It offers no insight into occurrences nor does it provide any narrative tie-in with the purported actual murders even though two private investigators are part of the people being interviewed, if you can call random and repeated sound bites an interview.  I couldn't finish the show but I will instead look up the case to see if other work has been done.",1452902400,,680,4.689075630252101

5322972,1,B009ES1M7Y,"This could have been an interesting documentary, but obviously the film maker does not understand what a documentary is supposed to be. There are a lot of interviews, footage of paranormal investigations, clips from local news and it is by far one of the worst editing jobs I have ever seen. It jumps back and forth from one interview to part of a paranormal investigation, back to another interview with no real cohesion; a lot of what is lumped together does not make sense. There are people interviewed talking about serial killers etc who obviously don't know the first thing about serial killers - I am no expert either, but know enough to know bologna when I see it. They added all sorts of visual and sound effects - I guess they thought it would enhance the scariness or something, but it just comes across as childish and stupid.

A dead gay guy being trolled by fake psychics....that would definitely be a more likely response. But leave it to the wonder bread paranormal society to severely butcher it and post it as they want it to be..not how it is.  Please, every one of these clowns knew it was a serial killer location, they did their research. Any fool can walk around the woods and home going...oh yeah, cold spot..definitely buried here...And here..oh yeah..there's a wisdom tooth buried 8 feet under my right toe. Not impressive at the least. The dead gay guy was the only high point in the whole documentary. Oh this is a positive vortex..this is a negative vortex. Shaman? My pet donkey.

5322998,3,B009ES1M7Y,While I like true crime documentaries and low-budget ghost hunter movies and shows this is a sincere if somewhat flawed effort to put the two together. Probably better as a straight documentary they could have left the psychics at home and actually made and even scarier piece of work.  This is more of a forensic file type subject with a ton of material to pursue. They could've organized it better and not going looking for ghosts who may or may not be there. In any event he truly trouble story about a very sick case. I do like the fact that they  left open but failed to fully play up the idea that the one on killer may not have acted on his own. I don't want to give anything away because if you like true crime stories and don't mind a little bit of ghost hunting mixed in.  I thought about trying to describe the actual storyline but it would take up too much space and give too much away so I'm going to stay very good this time.  This is better than average fair. I only gave it three instead of four stars because the material was so rich I think they could've done a lot more with it playing it straight.,1438819200,,1117,4.205607476635514

The first half that I watched went over the forensic evidence and offered conjecture as to what took place.  Conjecture is not fact.
