3907006,3,B002CQUCDA,"Meh! Christopher Lee when he was very young - late 12th century, thereabout *snicker* - Actually the story was fine...suspense, surprise, etc, everything you'd expect from the old black & white thriller. But the end was rushed - like they spent so much time building the story they forgot a proper ending.",1412121600,3,305,4.884615384615385
3907007,3,B002CQUCDA,"Good period fun. If you like cheesy italian/Spainish films of the 60s early 70s vintage, then you'll find this right up your alley. Otherwise, give it a pass.",1408320000,2,158,4.678571428571429
3907008,3,B002CQUCDA,"CONSIDERING THE AGE OF THE MOVIE, IT WAS NOT BAD.  I GUESS YOU COULD SAY IT WAS TYPICAL OF THE DAY.  CHRISTOPHER LEE DID NOT HAVE AS MANY SCENES AS I THOUGHT HE WOULD, THOUGH.  IF YOU HAVE 90 MIN TO KILL, GIVE IT A TRY.",1402012800,,219,3.717391304347826
3907009,3,B002CQUCDA,"I usually enjoy these creepy old tales of curious goings on in a dark manor. But pseudo lesbianism aside, it was actually rather dry. Sometime the acting has a bit of a chomp to it, as though the actors say, ""Yes, I'm making this crap, but I'm going to act the crap out of it.""  This one didn't have that.  The acting was flat and overly dramatic at the same time if you can imagine such a thing. Even though I did watch the entire movie, it's just not one I'd recommend.",1400544000,4,471,4.108695652173913
3907010,5,B002CQUCDA,"They do not make movies like this anymore. Unfortunate. Although not the best Karnstein, you gotta love it.  Would love to see the original version in a theatre.",1400371200,3,161,4.75
3907011,3,B002CQUCDA,"In TERROR IN THE CRYPT, horror god Christopher Lee stars as Count Kharnstein. He's a Count w/ a family problem. It seems that someone is using occult means to resurrect a long-dead relative, and she's a witch! Now, the Kharnsteins are being killed off one by one, and the Count's daughter is obsessed w/ a mysterious female visitor. She may even be possessed! Plus, there is vampirism afoot! TITC is an adequate Italian spooker released stateside through American International Pictures. Worth a watch...",1379894400,14,504,5.0843373493975905
3907012,1,B002CQUCDA,"Can't believe this is a legit licensed release. Amazon supplying pirate quality DVD-R copies? Is this what the ""digital revolution"" was all about? Look forward to my personal release of the Star Wars series, coming soon",1244937600,7,219,5.111111111111111

8364339,4,B002CQUCDA,Black and white period horror film in the style common through to the late 60s.,1526428800,,79,4.333333333333333
8364340,4,B002CQUCDA,"I really enjoyed this. A fine atmospheric example of Gothic horror with Christopher Lee that waivers between witches, ghosts, vampires, a touch of lesbianism thrown in for fun, and a bit of black magic. Add a dash of a suitor using brains rather than brawn to solve a centuries old mystery, a crazy peddler, and a secret tomb-- whats not to like here? I do wish the print was better, but that's mot the fault of the film. I've been watching a lot of these Italian Gothics lately and this one is pretty good.",1505433600,,507,4.404255319148936
8364341,3,B002CQUCDA,This was a pretty good Euro goth film. Not on the level of a Barbara Steele film but it is still worth a watch.,1488585600,,111,3.6666666666666665
8364342,3,B002CQUCDA,"Worth seeing for a young Christopher Lee in it.  Not great but not awful either.  Felt way too long.  I was like, ok ok get on with it.  Previous posts are pretty accurate.",1477785600,,172,4.121212121212121
8364343,3,B002CQUCDA,"This was another Carmilla-based film.  Evidently, Italian filmmakers of the sixties and seventies really liked the Le Fanu novella.  This version, though, adds witchcraft.  Not the best Carmilla film, but it's worth a watch on some dark, windy night.",1469664000,3,250,5.358974358974359
