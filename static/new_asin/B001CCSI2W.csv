3508526,3,B001CCSI2W,"This is a good movie, but it takes place in China. The martial arts form in this movie is king fu, not karate. This is another of those remakes of an 80s movie which will dissapoint fans of the original. Hollywood thinks we are stupid, and we keep proving them right.",1409529600,,267,4.254901960784314

3508531,5,B001CCSI2W,"I don't know why I love Karate Kid pt 1 and 2... They are both good movie.. Daniel takes a lot of teasing and bulling in both movies... He ends up getting the respect he deserves though, in both movies.. Hope you also enjoy them..",1377043200,,230,4.133333333333334

it has all the classic movies and scenes i would reccomend it",1361318400,,108,3.909090909090909
3508533,4,B001CCSI2W,Yes it seems dated.  Yes the fight action is not that great. These are very family friendly movies with strong values and some pretty good acting.  I am excited to have all three movies in one set.  I watch this at least once a year!,1358640000,,233,4.133333333333334
3508534,5,B001CCSI2W,"So you want to watch a the Karate Kid Trilogy. Well it's fun, it's entertaining, it's harmless, it's predictable. Of course the original is the best, but the other two are not bad at all.  The second one flows right from the first one nicely, but the third one is a bit of a stretch, and I don't think the acting is up to par of the other two.  I am glad I have the trilogy and if you liked the original you will find the other two interesting. Always the bad guy and Daniel must overcome the odds. All three feel good movies.",1293840000,,526,4.048076923076923

3508536,4,B001CCSI2W,I purchased these for my 11 year old grandson.  He participates in martial arts classes and I thought they would be entertaining as well as a way to promote good morals and values.  I was pleasantly surprised at what a big hit the karate kid was with this new generation.,1260057600,,271,4.4

8286716,5,B001CCSI2W,"Karate Kid is a timeless movie that has been viewed over the years through many generations.  This is a Great all time family movie, that shows a different perspective of life.  It is great for the kids and family and shows the difference between Good and Evil, and Choices and Consequences.  Great Examples of good Values, e.g.,. Respect, Discipline, Self Control, Goal Setting,  Perseverance, Confidence, Choice, learning and dealing with Life issues.  I have watched this with my kids many times over the years, and still watching.

Karate Kid 1 & Karate Kid 2 are the best in the Trilogy, in my opinion.  The 3rd video is a bit of a stretch.  It appears producers are trying to get another movie out, and barely fits with the two previous Karate Kid movies.
*Make sure to watch the bonus clips and interviews with the writer, producer and characters on the main menu.  This movie has affected so many peoples lives over the years.

Highly Recommended for Everyone, however, it may not be suitable for younger children.",1443571200,,1022,4.788571428571428
