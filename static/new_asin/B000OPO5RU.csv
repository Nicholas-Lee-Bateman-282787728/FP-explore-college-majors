2798713,5,B000OPO5RU,"This film is set around Finland's evacuation of more than 70,000 children to Sweden, Denmark and Norway during World War II. The story focuses on one of the war children, a nine year old Finnish boy and emphasizes the intricate psychology of its characters, brought to life by its powerful cast. The film is directed by Klaus Haro, Finland's most significant director. The screenplay is by Jimmy Karlsson and Kirsi Vikman, based on the novel by Heikki Hietamies. The film provides insights into the ways adults use children to fulfill their needs. This is an amazing piece of art that will capture your emotions with its spectacular acting, cinematography and narrative.

2798714,3,B000OPO5RU,"When Russia bombed Finland in World War II, more than 70,000 Finnish children were sent to neutral Sweden by their parents to escape the horrors of war. This film personalizes that history by focusing on one family's story. The film begins when Eero Lahti makes an emotional return to Sweden as an adult for the funeral of the mother who welcomed him into their home, and with him confessing to his aged mother about his lifelong feelings of abandonment by her. The movie then reverts to 1943 when Eero was only nine years old. The Swedish host family, Hjalmar and Signe, had its own motives, both good and bad, for hosting a ""war child"" from Finland, and then its own ways of dealing with Eero once he was with them. Eero's biological mother, Kirsti, had her own deeply mixed emotions of guilt, regret, and love, along with horrible choices to make during the war. In between these two mothers is little Eero who as an adult still deals with the psychological complexities of two mothers who loved him in their deeply human but broken ways. In Finnish and Swedish with English sub-titles.",1209427200,17,1089,4.677083333333333
2798715,5,B000OPO5RU,"This film has always haunted me.  I saw it two years ago on a long flight and was completely struck by it's quality...the photography is completely breathtaking, the writing and storyline is top-notch, and the acting and directing is superb.  Being adopted I think this film has an added bittersweetness for me yet it's accessable to anyone because of its complete loyalty to the characters.  This film is a true delight, and heartbreak, from beginning to end.  It plays like a dream within a dream.
The woman who plays the adopted mother steals the show as you see her emotional range from one end of the spectrum to the complete other end.  I felt every single thing she was going through.  This is film making at its most beautiful.  Bravo!!!!!",1195603200,51,747,4.7
2798716,5,B000OPO5RU,"This movie was deeply touching.  In many ways it was the Finnish version of Terms Of Endearment.  The main character, Eero is sent from his home in Finland when attacks by the Russians during WWII intensifies.  He is taken in by a farm family in Sweden, initially the new mother rejects him and is harsh but eventually their attachment strenghthens until he is truly their child.  After some time passes, his mother requests him to remain with this new family, all are pleased.  Not long after, he is returned home and all are traumatized.  It is not until years later that we realize that the emotions faced by the adults who loved him and made choices in his best interest.
The movie moved rapidly with great cinematography, I don't usually notice lighting but the attention to lighting scenes and the use of black and white for the present while the flashbacks to the past are in color was a brilliant way to transition the movie as well as moving the plot forward.
The actors were superb, they were the parents.  Eero, the young boy was very convincing with his facial expressions.  The music was topped of this epic.  This goes down as one of the great foreign films of this decade.",1186790400,2,1187,4.587677725118484

Eero's indomitable spirit shines through as he adjusts to his new surroundings, dealing with the language difference and new relationships with his foster parents and the other schoolchildren.

It deals quite well with a difficult emotional topic.  Sending young children away for an undetermined time to unknown people in another country in order to protect them is unimaginably difficult.  But then from the other side,  it must be equally difficult to love and care for these children and then release them at war's end.  This film shows both sides of this dilemma.  The emotional impact upon young children in this situation is well depicted by the young man in the film.  Overall it is worth watching.",1368489600,,644,4.491379310344827

2798729,4,B000OPO5RU,"Let me state upfront that I am a big fan of the Film Movement library of indie and foreign films, so much so that I finally gave in last year and started a subscription to their DVD of the Month series. Meanwhile I am still catching up on Film Movement releases from years past.

""Mother of Mine"" (2005 Finnish-Swedish release; 110 min.) brings the story of Eero, a Finnish boy of about 8-9 yrs., and how his family is struggling in WWII. Eero's dad is killed while fighting the Russians and at that point Eero's mom breaks down and is unable to care further for the boy. Eero gets shipped of to a family in a remote part of Sweden. Eero is having a hard time adjusting to the family and his new environment, and the Swedish mom does not make things easier for him as she appears cold and uncaring, making us wonder why she is so hostile. Fortunately the Swedish dad is gentler and Eero gets along great with him, although Eero still longs for home in Finland. Why is the Swedish mom so cold to Eero? Will Eero eventually settle in with his Swedish foster family? Will Eero ever see his mom again in Finland? To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first and foremost, this is a moving family drama without being too sentimental. The acting performances are ace throughout, although none more so than from the little boy who plays Eero. Keep you eye out also for the Swedish dad, played by Michael Nyqvist, yes he of the Mikael Blomkvist character in the Dragon Tattoo/Millenium trilogy! Last but not least, at the beginning of the movie we are told that in real life about 70,000 Finnish kids were sent to Sweden during WWII to shield them from the war. Bottom line: I very much enjoyed this movie, and it is yet another worthy addition to the rich Film Movement catalog. If you are in the mood for a quality foreign movie, ""Mother of Mine"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1357344000,,1955,4.4581005586592175

2798731,5,B000OPO5RU,"It is incredible how film as an art form can bring the human condition right before our eyes so that we may feel what the characters are living through. Plenty of reviewers have already covered the essence of the plot, so I will skip that. But I must caution readers of these reviews because there are many spoilers in these reviews (not here).  I can only say that the setting of the film is spectacular, the acting flawless, casting is perfect for the requirements of each role, and the progression of human emotions in this heart-wrenching story reaches deep into one's soul, making one realize just how vulnerable our children are and how indispensable mother's love really is.  Beyond that the viewer also realizes that parents do what parents can, and that we are ultimately all flawed inside, to the detriment of the little ones we bring into this world.

2798733,4,B000OPO5RU,"Subtitled, but there is not so much talk that you miss the movie and acting for trying to read all the text.

At the beginning of WWII, Sweden wanted to help its war-torn neighbor Finland by offering the more than 70,000  Finnish ""war children""  temporary homes with Swedish families.  (Can you imagine how incredibly hard that must've been for the parents to do - or how scary and hard it must've been for the children?)

The kids were put on boats, and then a train - LOTS of children, very few adults to look after them.  Young kids trying to take care of and calm their baby siblings, stoically trying to protect them only to have them taken away as siblings were generally separated. So the poor kids had to deal with so much fear and grief and on top of that the guilt of not being able to protect their younger sibling. They didn't even speak the same language.  First they picked the youngest and then the prettiest girls, so they had to also suffer the torture of being picked over in that way.  And after a time the children started to get settled in their new life - and then they were uprooted again to be returned home.

War is HARD on EVERYONE and its effects are long lasting. And we should all remind ourselves of this during peace times, so we can appreciate the peace and work hard to avoid war. And younger generations need to understand it too, not only to appreciate what they have but to also understand that hard times are survivable and it is our loved ones that are valuable - not our possessions.

This is the fictional story of one child.  It is heart-wrenching at times, and it will make you want to just slap some of these people at times.  But humans aren't perfect.  It is a GOOD story, a good movie and at the end of the movie, I think you will be glad you watched it - and I hope you share this with others.",1348185600,8,1840,4.283236994219653
2798734,5,B000OPO5RU,"I'm so moved by this film that I find it hard to come up with the right words to describe it.  I just want to add my five star rating to the others to encourage viewers to watch this.

I will say that the story is fascinating.  We get a bit of what happened to Finland during WWII.  (In my ignorance I didn't know that Finland had sided with Germany.)  It's not a political story, though, it's a human one, set against the trials of their circumstances.  The film is so well done, the script, the cinematography, the actors, that anyone can relate to the lives of these people.  They had hard choices to make and they had to live with them. Despite the hardships the film is not at all depressing.  There is a lot of love and beauty in it.  We see the sea, the Skane geese, the beautiful but simple homes, as well as the beauty of the people involved.

I won't spoil the experience of possible new viewers by revealing too much of the plot.  Just see it for yourself and enjoy it.",1343001600,,980,4.18716577540107

2798738,5,B000OPO5RU,"I found the acting utterly superb and the cinematography beautiful in the film ""Mother of Mine"".

The phrase that came to mind when I wondered how to describe this film is ""When the child was a child ..."" which is part of a poem used in Wim Wenders' film ""Wings of Desire"".  And that refrain in that poem by Peter Handke holds a different meaning for me in its original language, German.  It seems more haunting, sadder, and unanswerable.

When I see a film of this caliber, I lack the articulateness to begin to do it justice.",1330041600,,527,4.402061855670103

2798740,5,B000OPO5RU,"This film is superbly acted by the entire cast.  You can totally relate to the characters. They don't portray some idealistic view of the human condition; they have real back stories and real hurts and joys that construct who they are as a person, and how they interact.  The most interesting character to me is the foster mom, Signe.  Her reaction to Eero's arrival seemed very genuine, and is explained later in the movie (don't want to spoil it!).  Her turn-around could've been more fleshed out (perhaps much was left on the cutting room floor?) but is believable.  The ending - well, I agree with others here in that I expected something quite different.  So, if you leave out the last two minutes of the movie, I loved it!",1308960000,2,728,4.604651162790698
2798741,5,B000OPO5RU,"This film was beautiful, heartbreaking, and a joy to watch. I was fortunate enough to see it during a long bus ride. The usual film shown during these rides is some Lindsay Lohan movie, or something equally horrific. When this film was shown instead, I was instantly fascinated by the storyline, and how the life of this young boy drastically changed due to the war which was claiming his country. The storyline is truly impeccably written, and it gives the viewer an insight into the life of a child who had to lose his parents to war--being displaced from his family and country, to be temporarily taken by a family in a neutral country. The twists are brilliant ant heartbreaking, and the characters are all too human. No one is whom one thinks them to be in the beginning-- there are many surprises along the way, all culminating in an end which is truly too real for words.

I absolutely recommend this film--and I have purposely made my wording vague, so as to not ruin anyone else's viewing experience. You won't regret buying this one.",1295740800,,1043,4.6378378378378375

2798743,5,B000OPO5RU,"... for us to watch this poignant film about a child displaced by war, without remembering the issues of that war, or recalling our own or our families' roles in that war? ""Mother of Mine"" is set in Finland and southern Sweden in the last years of World War II, but war per se is only a backdrop, a cause without a Cause, to the tragedy of the boy Eero, whose father has been killed in battle and whose mother sends him away for his own safety. Eero is twelve years old, speaks only Finnish, but he is taken to live on a farm in Skne, a rural province of Sweden, by an agency that transported at least 70,000 Finnish children as refugees to such safety. The Swedish family that accepts Eero has recently been traumatized by the death of their own child, and the Mother find's Eero's arrival horribly painful. Meanwhile, Eero's natural mother has found another ""man"" to love; she will eventually need to choose between the new man and the son whom she's given away.

The film narrative is structured as a 'flashback' in the mind of Eero as a 70-year-old man, summoned to the funeral in Sweden of his adoptive mother. Returning from Sweden, Eero visits his birth mother in a nursing home, despite the truth that he has never reconciled himself to her 'abandonment' of him. In a lovely reversal of the usual cinematography, the story of Eero's boyhood is filmed in color, while Eero's visitations after most of a lifetime are filmed in black-and-white.

The War, nevertheless, was a presence in my mind while watching this film, possibly because I spent some of my own childhood in Sweden, possibly because I'm just old enough to remember the post-war years clearly. Finland was aligned with Germany in that War; Eero's father fought against the ""Allies"", specifically against Russia, and Eero's mother worked for the German Occupation Forces. Her new lover was a German soldier. Sweden was purportedly a 'neutral' country, but Swedes of a certain age will forever feel a certain discomfort about that neutrality, which allowed the Germans to transit and attack Norway. At the same time, large numbers of Norwegian Jews fled to Sweden for asylum, and it's true that throngs of Finnish children were fostered during and after the War. It's also true that children of many nations were separated from the families and sheltered in foreign lands. The greatest WW II novel of all, in my opinion -- Austerlitz, by WG Sebald -- tells the story of a Jewish German boy rescued to exile in England.

Most viewers, I'm sure, will accept this film on its own a-polotical, a-historical terms. It's a potently sentimental story, a heart-render with an unexpectedly 'gentle' ending. The acting is incredible. Why is it that unknown, never-seen-before-or-again actors are so much more skillful in their portrayals on the screen than all the touted, overpaid, Oscar-acclaimed stars? Eh? Oh well ... Great photography, crisp editing, excellent dialogue (in Finnish and Swedish, but well subtitled).

Told in flashback, the story begins during WWII, Young Eero's father has died.  He is one of 70,000 Finnish children who were sent to Sweden families for temporary custody and safety.  Eero is sent to a childless family where he doesn't understand the language, is unwanted by the surrogate mother, Signe, more accepting by the father Hjalmar, and often confused about the whereabouts of his own mother, confused by her actions.

Although the relationship between Signe and Eero is cold and distant, predictably, the mood changes when Signe confides in Eero the truth about the death of their child.

About the film, Klaus Haro, the director, said:  ...... we can  capture something universal in the feelings of exclusion and rootlessness that we associate with the experiences of the war children. The themes are strongly relevant to any child who has been separated from his/her parents, to anyone for whom growing up has generally been hard due to the secrets they carry in their heart"".

8186083,5,B000OPO5RU,"This film magnificently portrays the plight of the Finns and the goodwill of their Swedish neighbors during the Winter War/WWII in Scandinavia.  The subtitles could not, however, convey one very important moment in the story: when Eero first arrived at his new school in Sweden, the students sang the Finnish National Anthem in the Swedish language. Finland is a bilingual country and the national anthem is sung in both Finnish and Swedish. Although at the time Eero did not understand the Swedish words to his anthem, he certainly knew the music and understood this as a sign of welcome and solidarity. Even if you are not a Finn, or of Finnish heritage, if you understand the importance of this scene, it will likely move you to tears. Overall, the scenes depicting the Soviet Union's (Russia's) aggression against its peaceful neighbor, the Finns, and their valiant fight against the superior power, serve to remind us today that history does indeed repeat itself, but the good and compassion in the hearts of even a few will overshadow the evil of many.",1422057600,,1058,4.910614525139665

8186085,5,B000OPO5RU,"Right from the beginning the film presses foreboding emotions and an unsettleness that does not lead on a merry chase; the weightiness of the story is steady to the very end of the film. I was particularly moved to anger though, in seeing Kristi engulfed in a trance of grief after the death of her husband. More than anything, I sympathized deeper for Eero. Even more upsetting to me, was when Kristi completely surrendered Eero all for the sake of fear and wanting to seal her safety by marrying the German solider. Still and all, I was pleased with how each character grew and how their lives exuded integrity and resolve.

Most interesting to me was Mother Signe. She was untouchable and the most enjoyable character, in that it took a great deal of time to uncover the mysteries surrounding her personality and emotions. I couldn't understand why she rebuked Eero so harshly, but when we came to identify the reasoning behind her pain, it all made perfect sense and I immediately fell in love with her courage and decision to love Eero. Did you cry when she was separated from Eero!? Oh my word, such a gripping movie!

The ambiance of war is inescapable, right from the opening sequence. We see the disarray and fear that WWII evoked; it was overwhelming and at times, difficult to watch. I was heartbroken for both Kristi and Mother Signe, having lost a child each in their own way, and the children! Oh my gosh, I was completely undone when I saw the children separated from their mother's. I honestly do not know what I would do given the circumstances. I want to say that I would hold on to my babies, and avoid giving them up all together, but then again, would that be selfish in my part?

Also, I've read many books and have watched numerous documentaries related to WWII, and yet interestingly enough, I had never known the Finnish/Swedish side of the story. I was provoked to discover more; I was particularly amazed to observe how the Finns were persistent in their resistance against the belligerent Russians at the time.",1418083200,,2038,4.655555555555556

8186088,5,B000OPO5RU,"My wife and I, who lived through this period of history, loved learning about this.  My wife went from Belfast to to an uncle's farm with her mother and brothers to escape the bombing during WWII.  She was very moved by this story of a young boy who went by himself to a strange land, to strangers who spoke a strange language.  And he left a mother who placed his welfare in second place.

The acting was superb, the story gripping, the subtitles easy to read.",1394064000,,461,4.325581395348837
