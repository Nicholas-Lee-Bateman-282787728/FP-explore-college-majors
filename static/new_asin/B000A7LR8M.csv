2377853,4,B000A7LR8M,"I bought this mostly to get a copy of ""The Dunwich Horror"" - but having never seen ""Die, Monster, Die!,"" I figured this would be the best route. I remember seeing 'Dunwich' back-in-the-day (first release) at a drive-in, and though I hadn't read the story prior to that, enjoyed it a lot. Now, after having read the story, I find it to be a decent adaptation (with quite a few liberties taken). The one thing that stands out about it for me is the wonderful opening credit sequence - produced by Sandy Dvore. Practically telling the entire story, while morphing the 'silhouettes' - using a simple palette of blue and black - is a masterful presentation. As for the rest of the film, I find it entertaining - containing enough Lovecraftian references to please my expectations. I'd have to say that my favorite actor was Ed Begley, Jr. He portrayed my impression of Dr. Armitage quite well. Dean Stockwell was quite adequate (the sequence on Sentinel Hill, where he 'battles' the Dr. is my favorite live-action sequence). Sandra Dee is always 'pleasing to the eye,' though I really didn't think her, or her character, added much to the film. Still - my overall enjoyment would give this 5-stars.

However, there is the small matter of the other film included in this set. It literally took me almost ten attempts to finally watch it all the way through. I haven't been pained that much trying to watch a film in a long time. The effects were...odd and unnatural - but not in a good, applicable way. The acting was, well, people saying lines rather than filling a role. There were a few wonderful lines from the great Boris Karloff - enough to please a horror film like myself. Still - my overall impression was very unfavorable. I would rate this film on it's own as 2-stars. As a closing note for this film - the quality (at least in this edition) was rather poor. I don't know if that's the best that could be achieved - nor do I really care, since this film is - in my opinion - merely filler.

Now - how did I come up with a 4-star rating from this mix? Well, I gave the benefit of the doubt toward ""The Dunwich Horror"" (and the previously mentioned title sequence). Maybe I should downgrade that to 3 stars overall, but I don't want to discourage anyone from checking out ""Horror"" merely because of the inclusion of ""Die.""",1491264000,,2325,4.533333333333333

Dean Stockwell's is probably the best performance in the film--Sandra Dee just writhes suggestively--but the film as a whole has so little to do with Lovecraft's story that I can only say it is loosely inspired by its source. The special effects are frankly ludicrous, and the  ""horror"" itself is glimpsed briefly as what appears to be someone shaking colored mops, then a strong wind which somehow kills people, and in the end a round rubber thing with tentacles that jiggle a little.

Five years later Hollywood flipped the bill for another Lovecraft story & left the title the same "" The Dunwich Horror"" rumors of Americas virginal sweet heart Sandra Dee in a nude scene was probably enough to guarantee box office success, but they gave the story the treatment it deserved & introduced thousands to H.P.

They spared no expense to scare Sandra outta her pants along with the rest of the fans of horror movies!  I was pleased to find this gem on D.V.D. at a reasonable price & happy to add it to my H.P.

Dean Stockwell naturally couldn't pull off the hulking, half-human Wilbur Whately of Lovecraft's short story but he is effectively creepy and intense in the film.

2377941,3,B000A7LR8M,"I've seen this before and it is just as awkward the second time around. This ranks in my mind as a drive-in classic. The film is creepy, corny, campy, and has some good horror elements as well as some brief T&A. I would rank it higher if the script were a little more polished.

Many people reading reviews may wonder why HP Lovecraft fans get so rabidly offended when his works are translated to the big screen. The simple answer is virtually none of the adaptations are remotely close to the stories. Lovecraft 1) rarely has any romantic couples as his protagonists, 2) does a good job of slowly building dread and tension as he slowly doles out details (most of which would be hard to hold back in a film), 3) rarely offers a happy resolution to the problem the protagonist encounters, and most important 4) tends to leave the protagonist the reader follows in a state of madness or death at the end. That is a quick and dirty summary of a very non_Hollywood formula by a long dead master horror writer. The story this film is named after is public domain, easy to find, and a good read.

I still give this film a solid 3 stars, but it really needs to drop the pretense of association with HPL's story and be renamed the Witchy Seductioning or something along those lines.",1418083200,,1275,4.444444444444445

Obviously, for a good Elder summoning ritual, all you need is some X, a roofie or two, a cute virgin, a 70's porn 'stache and the Necronomicon.

A young woman has been impregnated but one of the kids she gives birth to isn't entirely human. Meanwhile, a college student played by wholesome Sandra Dee falls under the spell of one Wilbur Whateley (Dean Stockwell, in a role Peter Fonda was originally up for) and it's up to a group of people who know Wilbur and his secrets to stop Wilbur from succeeding in the diabolical plans he has for the young, wholesome college student, soon to be his bride.

Lovecraft's short story, it is clearly based on that story and successfully brings out the mood, the horror, the mystery and the suspense that was at the heart of the original story.  Many of the core elements of Lovecraft's story are faithfully included.  As a movie it is fine entertainment, but a lot of the movie elements are unexpected changes from the Lovecraft story.  While the cast gave good performances, the introduction of Sandra Dee as the central character is a reasonable but unexpected new element.  The selection of Dean Stockwell to portray Wilbur Whateley was extremely odd -- Lovecraft's Wilbur was very tall, very unattractive and rather repulsive and weird, whereas Stockwell was short, handsome and charming.  All the other casting fit in with the story.  If you expect an accurate visualization of EXACTLY what Lovecraft wrote -- you will be slightly disappointed.  If you want to be entertained by a movie based on many of the elements of Lovecraft's story and which emotes the feelings the original story engendered -- you should like the movie.  Some of the special effects were rather campy, other special effects were not bad -- keep in mind the movie was made nearly a decade before the original Star Wars movie began the revolution in special effects techniques.",1408233600,,1349,4.96

Each has the same elements and actors, but because of the editing each has a different sequence of events. In all the versions, there is a university that has possession of a copy of the Necronomicon. In each of the versions, there is a back story about events some thirty years prior when several characters were born. In each version, one of the children are monstrous and has a destiny to open the door for the old ones to return. In actuality the versions have some areas that are completely different. In my opinion, the character development is inadequate and each of the versions leaves many unanswered questions.

Depending on the version Dean Stockwell is either a good guy trying to prevent the return of the old ones, or he is a bad guy trying hard to bring about the return of the old ones. All of the movies have something bad in the upstairs room that you only briefly get to see if at all.

I have not read the book this is based (nor have I read any Lovecraft for that matter, unfortunately), but from what I gather, this is a very good adaption of his work. And it is a very interesting film! Even if uneven in a few spots. But that's almost understandable due to its low budget, and the era it was made in.

But, even though made on a low budget, it does manage to throw in some really nifty special effects from time to time; but I could have almost done without all the jerky/flash edited hallucinatory segments that were more confusing than interesting. But the overall mood and tone of the picture is very well crafted, and the pacing is perfect for the story that is told.

Both Dean Stockwell and Sandra Dee were very good, and offered very realistic performances, making the viewer believe in and care for their characters. I have read that Peter Fonda was the first choice for this, but thank goodness that he declined, because I feel it would have given the movie a completely different tone with him in it. Well, picture something like ""Race With The Devil"" and you probably get the idea. Dean was effectively creepy, yet almost naive and innocent at the same time, and Sandra Dee was very relaxed and a very mature actress by this time in her career, and showed no signs of her ""Gidget"" days, which is a very good thing.

Very suspenseful, and even lightly comedic in some spots, I feel this is a very timeless tale that was captured on celluloid succesfully. However, as much as I usually detest remakes, this is one that I would love to see someone like John Carpenter get a hold of and remake. He came close with his own Lovecraft inspired ""In The Mouth Of Madness"" a few years back, and I think a remake of this would be right up his alley, so to speak.

I highly recommend this!

Thank you,

Of course with a different actress and a more up to date scenario,the the outcome would be different and I'm sure much more entertaining. The movie caught some of the elements of Lovecraft,but I am so spoiled by today's technology and special effects and sound that a 3D version could potentially be quite scarey.

2377999,1,B000A7LR8M,"I originally gave this film a three-star rating based on memories of seeing it thirty or more years ago.  I decided to watch it again and realized it is a TERRIBLE movie.

Based on the classic story by horror master H. P. Lovecraft, it retains the basic structure of Lovecraft's tale, but tosses in new characters and situations that detract rather than add.  Wilbur Whately (Dean Stockwell) is transformed from a misshapen monstrosity to a suave, handsome young man, and a young beautiful college student (Sandra Dee) is added to provide some sex interest.  The acting is appalling, especially by actors who usually are quite good, such as Stockwell, Ed Begley and Sam Jaffe.  The dialogue is stilted.  The special effects are ludicrous, with the hideous monster presented as flashing, multi-colored lights and writhing tentacles.  The fertility cult is a mass of naked people cavorting in a meadow.

Unless you're interested in seeing a half-naked Sandra Dee writhing on an altar or seeing a very young Talia Shire in one of her earliest roles, avoid this one at all cost, particularly if you are a Lovecraft fan.  I truly believe it is almost impossible to capture on film the essence of Lovecraftian horror, filled as his stories are with adjectives such as ""indescribable"" and ""unnamable"" and references to ""colors that lie outside the known spectrum"".

2378008,3,B000A7LR8M,"Die, Monster, die is a somewhat slow moving version of an H P Lovecraft story that is heavy on atmosphere and has some very good acting by the stars, especially horror film veteran Boris Karloff.

The problem with this film and many others from the '60's is that the special effects tend to be somewhat crude and done on the cheap.  ""Die, Monster, Die"" would have benefited greatly if they let us see more of how the people were slowly being mutated by the radiation from the meteorite that was taken into the house.  Instead, the scenes with the human mutants tend to be brief and their fatalities not that shocking at all.

However, despite these problems, I would give this film high marks for atmosphere.  Filming it at a gloomy, fog bound mansion in England was a great idea...just wish the special effects were more shocking.  I've watched the movie several times just for the atmosphere!

""The Dunwich Horror"" is yet another film that desperately needed to let the audience SEE the ""horror"" close up as he/it attacks people. Instead we see the action from the monster's point of view as people cringe at his/its lethal approach.  To compensate for this MAJOR problem with the film we are allowed to see him/it for a few frames at the end.

TDH has an interesting premise...weird rites to allow the ""Old Ones"" to invade and conquer Earth, but, of course, that never happens.

I would recommend both of these films for atmosphere, but not for special effects.

He worked on all the early Edgar Allan Poe pictures and after the success of THE HAUNTED PALACE (1963), was given his chance to direct on another adaptation of an H.P. Lovecraft story. H.P. Lovecraft (1890-1937) was a writer who came into his own in the 1960s with the republication of many of his horror stories which were turned into a series of films by American International Pictures and a number of episodes of Rod Serling's NIGHT GALLERY. The story chosen, THE COLOR OUT OF SPACE one of Lovecraft's best, became DIE, MONSTER DIE in 1965. Despite the blatant drive-in title, the film turned out to be surprisingly good and it contains one of Boris Karloff's best late  career performances. It was shot in England and had the services of the ill-fated Nick Adams (his early death resembled Heath Ledger's) along with a solid British cast. The photography is impressive, the settings cheap but interesting, and the performances triumph over the OK script. The first half is wonderfully atmospheric and reminded me of the HARRY POTTER pictures. The second half, which is more plot heavy with the typical B movie rushed conclusion (taken from Karloff's 1936 THE INVISIBLE RAY), is less satisfactory but it can't take away from the overall aura that the film generates. Underrated and very much worth your time.

The same cannot be said of THE DUNWICH HORROR which followed 4 years later. This film was shot in America and is full of late 1960s hip trendiness which give the movie an incredibly dated feel. Actually I remember seeing this film in high school when it came to town in 1970. My date and I were not impressed as we weren't really into the counterculture at that time. It did contain a few good scares but those were mostly accidental. I remember afterwards how disappointed we were at how atmosphere had been sacrificed for drugged out visuals. The essential elements of the story are in place with a modern day warlock attempting to resurrect an ancient race of beings by mating them with women. Dean Stockwell as the warlock, gives a subdued, intense performance despite the rather poor script and he receives able support from Sam Jaffe and Ed Begley. Sandra Dee however remains Sandra Dee despite this attempt to jazz up her image and she doesn't help matters. One interesting bit of trivia is that DUNWICH HORROR features an early appearance by Talia Coppola (later Shire) 6 years before ROCKY. It's hard to believe that these two movies were made by the same director but it goes to show the difference between a British technical crew and an American one and how attitudes in the movie business had changed in just 4 years. This DVD is worth it for the first film with the second an interesting time capsule.",1250553600,,2806,4.771604938271605
2378015,4,B000A7LR8M,"""The Dunwich Horror"" is a bizarre occult thriller based on H. P. Lovecraft's short story of the same title.  It was directed by Roger Corman who directed many Vincent Price features based on Edgar Allan Poe's short stories such as ""The Fall of the House of Usher,"" ""The Masque of the Red Death,"" and ""The Pit and the Pendulum.""  Like the great Mario Bava himself, Corman was able to produce lavish films with small budgets.  The set pieces of ""The Dunwich Horror"" have a mod, psychedelic flair.  The animated opening title sequence has a great musical score by the famous Les Baxter who wrote the lyrics for ""Born Free.""

  Sandra Dee of ""Gidget"" fame is wonderful as Nancy, a cute, nave, college librarian who is lured to Dunwich by charming, but mysterious, Wilbur Wheatley (Dean Stockwell of ""The Manchurian Candidate"").  Wilbur lives in a spooky, fog-enshrouded mansion with his grandfather and a grotesque creature that is kept behind a locked door on the top floor.  Wilbur plans on stealing the ""Necronomicron,"" an ancient occult text book, and reciting words from it while sacrificing Nancy.  All this in order to open a gateway into another dimension.  Dr. Henry Armitage (Ed Begley) struggles to get the ""Necronomicron"" back and prevent the disaster.  Meanwhile, the creature escapes and begins killing townspeople in gruesome fashion.

  ""The Dunwich Horror"" capitalized on the popularity of ""Rosemary's Baby;"" both films deal with the raping of a drugged young woman and demonic birth.  Some of the special effects are obviously low budget, such as the burning of the house.  The altar on the cliff looked extremely unrealistic.  (Why hadn't the superstitious villagers destroyed that?)  However, the interior sets were lavish and Mario Bava-like in their use of vibrant primary colors.  Look for Talia Shire of ""Rocky"" fame who was cast in the small role of Nurse Cora.

  This bizarre blend of occult horror and science fiction is highly recommended for those who enjoy horror films made in the 60's and 70's.  It is very campy, especially the dream scenes where brightly painted, naked hippies (looking like savages) are fondling and chasing Sandra Dee who is dressed in sheer black.  Modern horror fans will probably want to pass on this one.  However, a remake is scheduled for release in 2009.  Dean Stockwell returns to portray the elderly Dr. Armitage.  I'm looking forward to it.  Today's high tech special effects should give new life to ""The Dunwich Horror"" and give justice to the H. P. Lovecraft short story on which it is based.",1231545600,,2554,4.971631205673759
2378016,3,B000A7LR8M,"On the big screen adaptions of H.P. Lovecraft have been few and really nothing to write home about.  Probably the reason why is that, unlike say Stephen King, HPL's characters are pretty much doomed victims. They have come into contact with power so alien and vast that their destruction is assured. Humans can't win. His protagonists are always male, bookish: scholars, antiquarians.  Characters such as these were prevelant in horror fiction back in the late 19th early 20th century. Another strike is that the horrors in his fiction is not visceral but cosmic in power and scope.  Ed Begley is fine as Professor Armitage, Dean Stockwell rather odd as Wilbur Whatley and Sandra Dee a character who never existed in any Lovecraft story as sex did not figure into his tales.  The chilling effect of HPL's stories is that we are afforded only brief glimpses of the Great Old Ones that force to recoil in horror. Visual effects circa 1970 could not do them justice and even John Carpenter makes the mistake of showing too much in IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS -- probably one of the best Lovecraftian movies ever done.  THE DUNWICH HORROR, having said all of that is still goofy and kinda fun entertainment.  I tend to collect films based on HPL and will watch this movie from time to time.  Among the AI films I still think Corman's THE HAUNTED PALACE (based loosely on a Poe poem and Lovecraft's ""The Case of Charles Dexter Ward"") is probably the best of the lot.  The HPL Society adaption of THE CALL OF CTHULHU is probably the best Lovecraft adaption of them all.  Have to wait and see what happens with the upcoming AT THE MOUNTAINS OF MADNESS.

It better, because that's really all I should need to say. You already know ""The Colour Out of Space."" If you don't, get thee hence to the library. And you should already be familiar with Samuel Z. Arkoff. If you're not, get thee hence to the video store. All you need to do from there is combine the two, and you have Die, Monster, Die!. You really can't go wrong. ***

The Dunwich Horror (Daniel Haller, 1970)

These days, you can get The Dunwich Horror and Die, Monster, Die!, the two Arkoff/Haller Lovecraft adaptations, packaged on one chock-full-of-cheesy-goodness DVD, and lemme tell you, it's oh so worth it. This is the better of the two films, if only because Arkoff didn't rely on one big star to propel the film--he recruited a stable of the rising and falling of the day that includes Ed Begley (Sr.), Dean Stockwell, and Sandra Dee among its principles. Fans of prurience for the sake of prurience take note: this is, in fact, the one film in which Sandra Dee has a nude scene. (I use the term loosely--a quick flash of ******--but still, it's SANDRA DEE.)

Once again, I say: if I need to recap the plot for you, you need to go read Lovecraft. The Dunwich Horror is a slightly more faithful adaptation, thanks to the waning of the nuclear hysteria that was still in full rage when Arkoff and Haller collaborated on Die, Monster, Die!. Ever the bandwagon-jumpers, though, this movie is all about psychedelia. Lots of heavy filters here, man. I'm sure this movie is a blast to watch when stoned to the gills. A fun, fun movie. *** ",1180137600,,1899,4.521865889212828

This kind of movie does not exist anymore, and will probobly never again, because nobody can make them like this anymore. If you are tired of the creepy little kid horror movies of today and tired of that con artist M Night Shalomanon (or whatever) and want something fresh and quite entertaining, buy or rent this, plus its a double feature.

Boris plays an awesome roll as always, one of the few last films before he passed away, and Nick Adams, a truly awesome actor, who is sadly missed, who knows what kind of ""star"" level this actor would have today if he was still alive, but, his acting will truly be missed. However, the second film is just a pure dud to be honest. I would have given it a 4 if it wasn't for this film. I like Stockwell, but, this isn't one of his best films..and the late Sandra Dee in a horror film?..you got to be kidding!..anyways, this film is nothing but a filler at best.",1174608000,,641,4.136
2378046,3,B000A7LR8M,"Well, to keep this brief for those who are tire of long rants, I liked it.  Rent it, if you are an HPL fan.  It stays fairly true to the Call of Cthulhu story, but throws a ton of cheesy 70s style flower children prenteding to perform ""unholy rituals"" action scenes.  Well, you get a few [...] shots, so, for some that may redeem these cheesy attempts at scary rituals, which ran amok in that era of horror films.

The guy from Quantum Leap does a decent job of being the moody, evil sorceror descendent, carrying on the ""family business"", and yo get to see a little skin from the one time wholesome actress, Sandra Dee.  yes, that's right, Sandra Dee.  She either wanted to change her image or needed some cash.  At any rate, if this movie would have been made in more recent times, it would have been awesome.

It was nice, dark, and creepy, and is worth a watch, by old Hammer, Arkoff, and Corman horror buffs as well as he usual HPL fans.

2378048,5,B000A7LR8M,"I read all of the other reviews and was amazed. While it is true that the low budget affairs seem to give Lovecraft a bad name in the cinema realm, one has to admit that Lovecraft's nightmare fantasies are not as easily translated onto the big screen. Take Lawrence Bernabo's review - (a so-called Top 10 Reviewer) - "" Lovecraft's story of ancient horror and interdimensional monsters is reduced to standard black magic nonsense."" Obviously Mr. Bernabo has never read the story else he would have realized that much of Lovecraft's protagonists are into little more than ""black magic nonsense"" and that is how these extra dimensional horrors gain a foothold back in this reality.

If you read the Lovecraft Mythos, you realize that HP was trying to describe the indescribable. How DOES one quantify and use adjectives to explain something that is horrific AND abstract?

With all that said, I thought this movie was excellent for its day. There is plenty of the Gothic horror to it as well as the mood of the film is just plain eerie enough to want to make you keep the lights on in the house while watching it at night. Dean Stockwell's character played a modern day Aleister Crowley quite closely and Sandra Dee was fair in her role as well.

Overall I rate this film 5 of 5 stars and stick by it. Get a copy and enjoy it. Makes a perfect film to watch for Halloween horror fests and I'd recommend getting it along with ""Dagon"" and ""The Mouth of Madness"" to give you the Cthulhuian Mythos feel.",1135987200,,1495,4.57089552238806
2378049,4,B000A7LR8M,"As a gothic style horror this little film has about everything anybody could want - excluding violence. Granted for the most part it is not very scary, and is sometimes campy and there are a few plot elementes that don't make sense.

Here are the positives: Sandra Dee is beautiful in a good girl kind of way. Dean Stockwell is sinister cool and creepy and ultimately deranged. Ed Bagley Sr. gives the film its anchor and an added dimension of credibility. Sam Jaffe as the wanabe warlock Dad is perfectly cast. (Jaffe wisely plays his character as if he were Mosses or John the Baptist.) Even a young pretty Talia Shire is thrown in for good measure. Not a bad cast by any standards!!

There is a wonderfull, creepy haunted house backdrop. Lots of fun supernatural mumbo jumbo delivered as if in normal every day conversation. Extremely colorful photography, sets, location shots and special effects.

There is welcome humor. Production values are far far superior to other horror films of its ilk. Most of the effects are achieved by lighting and the use of intentional coloring in the sets and costumes from pure whites of the insane asylum to deep purples greens, blues, and reds in Wilber's home -

Quite possibly this film influenced the latter styles of Dario Argento and Sam Reme. Very neat colored strobe-light special effects look great in very dark room. Dynamite music score and wonderful cartoon opening credits give the impression your about to see something important.

To top it all off MGM did a fantastic job on this one. The picture is absolutely perfect clean crisp clear, like it was made yesterday. The only complaint is that the sound is in Dolby mono although very good.  This film absolutely deserves a 5 channel surround sound. It would add immensely to the atmosphere and special effects.

This film is an old fashioned fun, creepy and atmospheric horror story. But be warned if you are into blatant nudity , gore violence, blood, carnage and visible rubber monsters in your horror you will be disappointed. It has none of those elements.

The film only loosey follows the H P Lovecraft short story but many elements are kept intact. I think the film stands alone on its own merits. Lovecraft's egg monster roaming the contryside may have been silly on film. Plus the film has a cute babe not in the short story. And few horror movies can do without at least one cute babe.",1133654400,,2400,4.738609112709832

2378051,3,B000A7LR8M,"American International Pictures (AIP) and Roger Corman found great success translating (often times loosely) the works of Edgar Allen Poe to the silver screen with such popular films like House of Usher (1960), Pit and the Pendulum (1961), The Masque of the Red Death (1964), and The Tomb of Ligeia (1965).  This being the case, why wouldn't the terrifying, mind bending works of H.P. Lovecraft, creator of the Cthulhu mythos * (a shared world in which authors use as a setting for their stories, usually within the realm of horror, science fiction, or fantasy) among other things, fair equally as well?  They did try, releasing such films as The Haunted Palace (1963), Die, Monster, Die! (1965), and The Dunwich Horror (1970), but found limited success.  The films were entertaining, but if you've ever read any of Lovecraft's stories, what you see on screen is comparatively tame to the visuals created within your mind from the text of the written word.  Directed by Daniel Haller (Die, Monster, Die!), who later found work directing television shows like Buck Rogers in the 25th Century, The Misadventures of Sheriff Lobo, and Knight Rider, the film stars former teen idol Sandra `Queen of the Teens' Dee (Gidget, A Summer Place) and Dean Stockwell (The Boy with Green Hair, Blue Velvet, Married to the Mob).  Also appearing is Ed Begley (12 Angry Men), Lloyd Bochner (The Naked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell of Fear), and Talia Shire (The Godfather, Rocky), who is actually credited in the film as Talia Coppola as she had yet to take the name of Shire from her impending marriage to composer David Shire.

The story begins essentially at a university as a lecture, held by Dr. Henry Armitage (Begley), a doctor of Philosophy, is letting out.  One student, Nancy Wagner (Dee), is tasked with returning the Necronomicon (the book of the dead) back to its rightful place within the schools library (how in the world the University ever came to possess this I have no idea).  As she's returning it to its secure location, she's approach by an odd looking man we'll later know as Wilbur Whateley (Stockwell), who has a great interest in the ancient tome, and not just for edification purposes.  The two become acquaintances, but there's a feeling of Wilbur having ulterior motives with regards to his interest in Nancy, other than gaining unfettered access to the book.  We later discover Wilbur, who lives in nearby Dunwich, has a history in the occult, leading all the way back to his great grandfather, who was killed by the peoples of Dunwich for his strange beliefs.  Has Wilbur (the townsfolk refer to him as Weird Wilbur) taken up where his forefathers left off?  He certainly has, but how do Nancy and the Necronomicon fit into whatever plans he has?  And what's that thing locked away in the upper recesses of Wilbur's house?  Based on all the strange noises it makes, I bet it's something very nasty (and slimy)...

Honestly, I have yet to see a well-rendered film adaptation of any of Lovecraft's works.  Perhaps the closest came in the form of a film not even based off a Lovecraft story, but certainly inspired by his writings, in John Carpenter's In the Mouth of Madness (1995).  The problem is in the idea of The Old Ones (these were creatures who came from outer space, inhabited the Earth long before man, and have since been banished to a different dimension), in that they are such hideous, vile, unfathomable creatures that to even catch a glimpse would result in complete madness and permanent insanity.  How do you depict that on the screen, especially in and AIP film, not known for their extravagant spending (cheap special effects and psychedelic lighting only go so far)?  Stockwell was hardly frightening (especially with his Mike Brady hairdo and mustache) and often looks like he just arrived from the set of a homersexual porn film.  I think his character was meant to appear suave and smooth-tongued, but he came across as creepy, oily, and, well, just weird.  That guy from the movie Manos, the Hands of Fate was a more menacing warlock.  If Wilbur were any more laid back, he would have been tokin' a doobie.  I had a really difficult time believing he was capable of doing some of the things he later did...as far as Dee's character, she spent much of the film in a state of enchantment, so not much going on there.  There are some cheap thrills, seeing once teen idol Dee virginal character being violated by the forces of darkness (oh no, not Gidget!), but it seemed like that was played upon too much.  And for the record, Dee does not get full on nekkid in this film as she's wearing a robe with slitted sides, and the camera spends way to much time ogling her, going up and down her sides as she lay on an altar (I thought I did see a nipple at one point, but it could have been a mole).  Incidentally, Dee's real life defrocking came a few years earlier, as her marriage to teen idol Bobby Darin disintegrated and she was unjustly stigmatized with the air of being a divorce (i.e. damaged goods) rather than a competent actress.  The direction of the film is decent, and there are some creepy scenes, highlighted very well by Les Baxter's superior haunting score, but ultimately the film, while entertaining, was a little bit of a letdown for me as it lacked the truly nightmarish qualities one would expect from a Lovecraftian story.  And who didn't see that ending coming?

The wide screen picture (1.85:1), enhanced for 16 x 9 TVs, looks very sharp and clean.  The Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono comes through clearly most of the time.  The only special feature on this DVD is an original theatrical trailer.  By the way, the title for my review is probably the funniest line in the film, as stated by a farmer, about his dog, as the dog reacts to the unseen (but certainly heard) approach of a hideous, slobbering nightmare creature, which, subsequently devours the house (I think Rusty survived, though).

The other grew up to become the hideous, poodle-haired creature with titanic sideburns known as Wilbur Whately (Dean Stockwell)! Wilbur sets out to unleash the dreaded ""Old Ones"" from their millenia of slumber. He needs two things to get started, #1- The Necronomicon (book of the dead). And #2- A female virgin. Wilbur steals the necronomicon from the local college, and snags a young coed (Sandra Dee), by drugging her. He introduces the girl to a group of demoniacs who look more like the cast of HAIR.

Lovecraft, but I do enjoy low-budget films that often avoid the Hollywood cliches that are often found in those overbudgeted blockbusters (such as Spielberg or Lucas). What I do understand is this movie is not true to the actual story, but for me, that's not what matters, what matters to me is it's a silly B-movie. Even Lovecraft himself stated that Hollywood should not try to adapt his stories into movies, but of course they had, and this was one of them. The acting is downright hilarious here! Especially Dean Stockwell, playing Wibur Whately, with his dated hairstyle and mustache. I really love his obsessive, emotionless behavior, as he so desparately wants this book called the Necronomicon, which was kept locked behind glass at an imaginary university. Wilbur desperately wanted that book to open up the gates from another dimension. Sandra Dee (once married to singer Bobby Darin), who was previous known for playing innocent teens in films like A Summer Place or Gidget, plays Nancy Wagner who gets seduced by Wilbur, by drugging her tea, in order that she be used as a sacrificial victim. From my understanding, there was no Nancy Wagner in the actual story, or any sacrificial victim. Nor does Grandpa Whately try to stop Wilbur from summoning the Old Ones in the story (in fact, in the story, Grandpa fully supported what Wilbur is doing). Throughout the film, you hear strange sounds, psychedelic effects, and silly music played on Moog synthesizer, harpsichord, and Theramin, conducted by Les Baxter (back in 1970, the Moog syntehsizer was still an electronic curiosity, and there were tons of Moog albums flooding the market at that time from Mort Garson, Wendy Carlos, Gerson Kingsley and Jean Jacques Perrey, Beaver and Krause, Hugo Montenegro, Ruth White, and so on, and so it looks like Les Baxter had a try at it with this soundtrack, although lots of other keyboards are used as well as orchestration). There really isn't getting around the fact this film is from 1970. Also of note was it was made by American International, which had not only made low-budget horror flicks, but Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello beach flicks (Beach Party, Muscle Beach Party, Beach Blanket Bingo). Somewhere you'll find the sister of director Francis Ford Coppola (Talia Coppola, also known as Talia Shire) playing Nurse Cora, assistant to Dr. Cory. Many people have complained that the film goes at a slow pace, I hadn't really noticed that myself, in fact I had little problem watching the whole movie in one go.

Biggest complaints seem to be that Stockwell should have had his hair straightened (so 90s & millenial, in the 60s folks weren't so hung up about the Uniform Hair look), the flick was low budget (duh!), not enough special effects for the monster (yeah, it would have been SO great if they'da had COMPUTER GRAPHICS, you know, like in Aliens 'n' The Thing, complete with lingering scenes of slimy tentacles & dripping puss---for all you jaded unimaginative types out there), clips of painted dated hippie types (anyone ever hear of pagans, Druids, Picts, etc.---they probably didn't have executive hairdos or baseball caps), the ending was anticlimactic (?) (Yeah, it COULD have been more like a Schwarzennegar or Bruce Willis flick with lotsa EXPLOSIONS and stuff, and plenty of sweat and dirt, straining jaw and neck muscles, gritting teeth), wasn't EXACTLY like the original story (and what movie IS?  After all, big movie executives feel compelled to dumb down their products for the vast movie going public---that goes for ALL movies, so why pick on this one), the acting was ""flat"" (yeah, there should have been more EMOTIONS displayed, you know like was done with The Lord Of The Rings or a Springer show---EMOTE for the audience is on a base level and might not ""get it"" otherwise), screenplay was lacking (yeah, we could have gotten more into Sandra Dee's character background, and so forth), the movie has a ""dated"", ""campy"" feel (how dated and campy do you think the overwhelming majority of movies churned out of Hollywood and by the ""Indies"" nowadays are going to appear 30+ years from now?), etc.

I agree that the movie is a bit campy, but I love it.  Yes, the movie is a departure from HP's original tale, but it stands on its own, and does respectfully adhere, in its own way, to the Arkham mythos.  I LIKED the special effects, the tastefully short clips don't interfere with the imagination.  I loved the soundtrack, it is quite memorable (if you have an attention span past, say, that of a puppy).  Graphics, photography, sets, acting, casting, direction---in fact, I find very little wrong with this movie.  It is a WORK OF ART!  If you don't agree, go pop in your copy of Total Recall (hey man, check out the guy with the talking head growin outta his belly or wherever) or something.  BLAMMO!  Subtlety is truly a dying art.

2378097,3,B000A7LR8M,"This handsomely filmed AIP Lovecraft offering has more to recommend it than not:  colorful production, good cast and performances, and a pretty good script.  The alterations made to Lovecraft's original story are acceptable, given production limitations.  The Les Baxter soundtrack is hit-and-miss, the intrusion of rock music into the eeriness somehow out of place  -  as is the Mod Era look of the entire piece, which is partially effective (in the sense of connecting bizarre cults to a tie-dyed druggie generation), but as often as not feels discordant.
Dean Stockwell plays handsome backwoods young man Wilbur Whateley, son of a deranged, mad old cultist (Sam Jaffe), whose wife Lavinia went mad giving birth to Wilbur.  The townsfolk never took kindly to the Whateleys, and Wilbur gives them the willies.  He's always off looking for arcane books of devil worship, presumably to continue his raving father's attempts to conjure-up some strange sky-demon.
Wilbur encounters wise old Dr. Armitage at Arkham University (Ed Begley), who is more intrigued by Whateley's family history than put-off by it.  Armitage's assistant, pretty naif Sandra Dee, is quite taken by the charming Wilbur, and spends the weekend at his ancestral house.  Crazy old Jaffe warns Wilbur that what he wants to do with the girl will come to no good, and it doesn't  -  he wants to impregnate her with his seed under the appropriate circumstances, and create Something Other.  Dee's presence contributes to upsetting the Family Secret, long locked up in an attic room  -  Wilbur's invisible not-quite-twin brother, who breaks free, burns down the house, and wreaks havoc throughout Arkham until Armitage confronts Wilbur in a magic showdown.
The first half of the movie is quite good, and the second half, though uneven, is not bad.  Wilbur's brother, once made (briefly) visible, is a pretty obvious spring-and-wire mask affair, but it isn't seen enough to detract from the rest of the piece.  The movie's biggest problem is its anachronistic rock score, and repetitive pointless padding scenes of Wilbur performing incantations over Dee on a hilltop stone slab.  The finale is abrupt and disappointing.
But the performances and the high quality of the production itself are worth watching, especially if you're a Lovecraft fan.  The ""demons"" in this version are converted to more prosaic devil-worship, which isn't as effective as Lovecraft's vision, but probably more passable to an American audience of the time  -  not to mention, easier on the budget.",1023667200,,2536,5.199507389162561

2378099,4,B000A7LR8M,"The stories of H. P. Lovecraft are difficult to adapt to film. Nevertheless, this Grade B movie is better than one might expect. Inevitably, there are some differences, but the tale of HPL's famous Cthulu Mythos cycle remains surprisingly intact. New characters appear that are not authentic Lovecraft. Sandra Dee's character introduces a sexual element that is anathema to Lovecraft's rather prissy sexual attitude. A side-view of Dee's bare left thigh and buttock is about it for the proclaimed nude scene. Dean Stockwell is not as monstrously horrific (in spite of his goofy hairstyle) as the Wilbur Whateley of HPL's story. Wilbur displays an obsessive interest in the dread book of evil, ""Necronomicon,"" encased in glass at Miskatonic University. He speaks the incantations in a forgotten language that summon Yog Sothoth and the elder race of ancient beings from beyond time and space. Professor Armitage (Ed Begley) speaks the counter spell and tries to keep Wilbur from the book. Bearded Sam Jaffe is effective in a small role as old Wizard Whateley. In a flashback segment, draped in his dark cloak and carrying the rune staff of unholy sympbols, he summons the ""Old One"" who mates with his feeble-minded daughter, Lavinia, and spawns Wilbur and one other. In an eerie scene, the whippoorwills' wailing cry seek to capture the expiring Whateley's soul as it leaves the body, another authentic Lovecraft element. The dread Devil's Hop Yard atop Sentinel Hill is a grim setting of terror and sacrifice. When Wilbur's otherworldy brother escapes from his lair, initially invisible, he wreaks havoc on the remote farms in fine monster-on-the-loose fashion. The climax of the film, however, amidst the stone figures and high places lacks the powerful punch needed. Regardless, this is a good attempt to translate Lovecraft on film.

2378100,2,B000A7LR8M,"This film is taken from one of HP Lovecrafts better stories, but here its been turned into typical early 70s AIP schlock. The acting is decent, and the film generally looks good considering its low budget.  The film is actually more loyal to the original story than most Lovecraft adaptions, though there have been signifigant changes.  New characters have been added, others dropped, and the storyline has been altered and simplified.  Few of the changes do much good, most are negative.

The film moves very slowly towards it's conclusion, as the story is a bit thin for a feature length film.  Once Wilbur and Sandra Dee get together in the first twenty minutes, the film plods along until it's time for the climactic ending.  Much of the runtime is filled with a lot of 60's psychedelic effects, long dull conversations and occult mumbo jumbo.

2378121,3,B000A7LR8M,"Probably one of the best Lovecraft-based movies ever made, especially considering the era and (apparent) budget.  The opening sequence itself successfully conveys a creepy tone.  Overall, stays relatively close to the HPL original.  When you finally get a good look at the ""horror,"" you want to laugh, but it's kept invisible through most of the movie.  Dean Stockwell's Wilbur projects a sinister cunning, although not quite the total alieness of the original character.  I highly recommend it to any HPL fan willing to accept some liberties in cinematic interpretations.",1007424000,,572,5.382022471910112
2378122,5,B000A7LR8M,"I thought this movie ruled. Okay, maybe it strayed from the story a bit, by taking a nine-foot tall alien freak and turning him into Dean Stockwell, and by adding a very hot Sandra Dee, but they at least tried. This is the only instance of movie exploitation, I think, that wouldn't have cause H.P. Lovecraft to roll over in his grave. And maybe Wilbur's star-spawned twin brother was a little goofy, but I thought it had that kind of rubber-suit-monster Night Stalker charm. Overall, the movie had a kind of narcotic gloss that aided well in the suspension of disbelief. I recommend this movie highly---both to Lovecraft fans and to ordinary horror buffs. It's cool, and even if this movie did damage Sandra Dee's career, she was hot. After all, monsters, even the slimy ones from outer space, need love too.

2378123,3,B000A7LR8M,"Sandra Dee and Dean Stockwell star in the average horror film THE DUNWICH HORROR, which bombed so bad at the box-office that it ended poor Sandra's movie career.
Wilbur Whately (Dean Stockwell - 1945's THE SECRET GARDEN) is a demonic occult warlock looking for the right girl to place on the altar..., and finds her in a wide-eyed college student (Sandra Dee - GIDGET, A SUMMER PLACE).
It's not long until the gates of hell open and the demons come forth, and begin their reign of terror over the town of Dunwich.
...How this film has an ""R"" rating I'll never know.
Stockwell looks like a cross between Art Garfunkel and George Segal on a bad-hair day.  His acting, too, seems a little stilted.

2378124,3,B000A7LR8M,"For a slow afternoon, this isn't bad - consider:  Dean Stockwell doing the most amazing eye riffs outside of gay softcore.  Lloyd Bochner, once again blowing a chance to become the American Christopher Lee.  Talia Coppola Shire, two years before the Godfather - a complete fox.  !!!Actual Sandra Dee nudity!!! (Not the second time she crawls up on the slab, the first.  Don't blink.)  And work through the credits at imdb - they CLAIM the guard who gets a spear through the lower tract from Dean Stockwell in the museum is Prince Iaukea!  I'm dubious - that'd make the Prince in his early fifties now, but let's go along with the gag.
Yes, the fx were pure cheese, but, hey, Corman was the executive producer, and this was 1970, folks.  EAP and HPL adaptations were usually nothing more than the title and a baked-from-scratch script.  I saw it new, and was pleasantly surprised that the Other Twin was NOT just a wind machine and flashing lights.",987292800,,947,4.656626506024097
2378125,4,B000A7LR8M,"This film has received more bad reviews than any other horror movie I have ever read about, and after seeing it I can't even begin to understand why! Based on the H.P. Lovecraft short story of the same title, THE DUNWICH HORROR follows warlock Wilbur Whatley's desperate quest to restore his fiendish family to their rightful position as rulers of the universe. However, there are two crucial factors needed in carrying out this mad plan. Firstly and foremost, Whatley must locate a copy of the Necronomicon, an ancient book of evil spells, and the sacrifice of a pure, but still sexually attractive female(that's where beautiful college co-ed Sandra Dee figures into the story). As the wild-eyed Whatley, Dean Stockwell is clearly having a ball, and was obviously warming up for his hammy role in David Lynch's sci-fi opus DUNE. Ed Begley, in his final film role, also seems to be enjoying himself as Stockwell's chief Nemesis, Dr. Armitadge. However, the best and most convincing performance by far is given by lovely young Sandra Dee(of GIDGET fame) who makes an effective SCREAM QUEEN debut. This film has received many negative notices, but it's not bad at all, even by today's standards. The film was made on a noticeably low-budget, but manages to produce some genuine scares and has a menacing air of creepy, Gothic atmosphere throughout. Furthermore, this movie is one of the better attempts to capture literary mastermind H.P. Lovecraft on celluloid. If the film seems rather long(it's 90 minutes), remember that Lovecraft's original story was only about 35-40 pages long. For the most part, the screenwriters have added some genuinely effective touches to flesh out the story. In my opinion, the film is fairly successful at sustaining the viewer's interest for most of its 90 minutes, and most importantly, director Daniel Haller has successfully captured the mood and flavor of Lovecraft's original story. Also, fans of the old DARK SHADOWS/NIGHT GALLERY series will be delighted by this little flick which is similar in tone and style to those early '70's TV horror classics.",969753600,,2089,5.075581395348837

8075630,4,B000A7LR8M,"An early Lovecraftian adaptation that packs less punch, but rather nostalgia as I recount the subsequent films it clearly influenced.  MORE MOVIES LIKE The Dunwich Horror:  For more movie adaptations from Lovecrafts writings, try The Resurrected (1991), The Reanimator (1985) and Dagon (2001). Although not specifically of Lovecraftian origins, his influence is most palpable in In the Mouth of Madness (1994), The Void (2016), The Shrine (2010) and Baskin (2015)all of which are more gruesome to varying degrees.

Based on H. P. Lovecrafts original story, Director Daniel Haller (Monster of Terror) tells the tale of the peculiar Wilbur Whateley (Dean Stockwell; Quantum Leap, Dune), a young academic who visits Arkham Miskatonic University to study Necronomicon. Wilbur is a student of the occult with a fascination for Yog-Sothoth, the Old Ones, and opening a gateway to another dimension.

Wilburs interests lead him to Nancy (Sandra Dee), whom he bewitches with his charm and lures her to his home in Dunwich, where he has a unique family history.

To call this horror feels a bit incomplete.  Dwelling more in the grey realm of horror fantasy it employs surrealistic dream-like horror elements, some entranced Woodstock-style nudity, a more historical exposition delivery and sexuality in lieu of monstrous make-up, scares, dread and blood.  Moreover, all the violenceincluding a tentacle monster attackare reduced to implied acts which, by todays standards, pack zero intensity.  Likewise, a drawn-out scene with a sacrificial virgin at the altar should have induced tension, but I never felt any.

Sure, Im less impressed by many older horror films in terms of their execution.  They were made in an era when it was easier to scare, spook, impress, wow or simply show someone something they hadnt yet seen on the screen.  Not just that, but at the time fewer stories had been told on screen. Quite to the contrary, my enjoyment of visiting this classic is noticing how it may have been the first (or one of the early films) to utilize certain techniques and motifs that would later be borrowed by Evil Dead (1981; the Necronomicon, the elemental evil POV ravaging through the woods after victims), The Kindred (1987; the tentacle monster brother), and many more.

So, yes, I enjoyed it. Would I recommend it? Not sure. Id say no if you enjoy gore, effects, scares or tones of dread; yes, if you want to recount Lovecraftian mythology on screen.  This certainly makes me want to explore more Lovecraft adaptations.",1518134400,,2521,5.134474327628362
8075631,5,B000A7LR8M,Was a happy accident to order. Love the campy atmosphere. Really young Dean Stockwell & Sandra Dee. Also Sam Jaffe plays his part well.,1515974400,,135,4.666666666666667
8075632,4,B000A7LR8M,"As previous reviewers have noted, this adaptation of the classic HP Lovecraft tale does take a few liberties & is hardly a major production. Yet it remains a solid & enjoyable film, in part due to the actors involved -- and yes, that IS the lovely & virginal Sandra Dee in her final film performance, one that's quite out of character for her. Viewers used to CGI & astonishing visuals these days will be left floundering a bit; but in fact, the film does work very well by depending more on atmosphere & strategic use of shadows & basic old-fashioned effects. Lovecraft has always been difficult to film effectively -- the HP Lovecraft Historical Society is one of the very few successes, with their deliberately throwback films utilizing the styles of the 1930s so marvelously -- but this is a respectable effort all the same. It's no classic, of course, but it's definitely a lot of fun, just as long as you're willing to accept its earlier style of filmmaking: a little clunkiness, a lot of mood, and a good story to work with. Keep that in mind, and it's well worth watching -- recommended!",1511913600,,1095,4.62051282051282
