i will never be able to understand how on earth it is possible to send a grown up against her will into a mental clinic. how it is possible to take someone's rights away. i'm just thankful to live in the 21st century.

8257427,5,B00153ZS26,I cannot imagine a movie of this quality and honesty being made in this country.  A Love to Keep is an excellent picture of how lesbianism was viewed and persecuted in our not too distant past.  Through a series of flashbacks we see the lives of two women in love through their happiness and tragedy. We also see the historic progress from persecution to greater acceptance and the cost to the individuals involved.  The story is well knit and well acted.  My thanks to the Spanish director and actors who have brought this film to life.,1220832000,11,537,4.5625
