7965170,5,B000068QMQ,"Michael Reinne known as the alien in the classic the Day the Earth Stood Still plays
the part of Jekyll and Hyde. This was a  tv version as they did in the 50's but
it's much better than that. Too bad it never got a decent remaster. It has the feel
of a classic black and white horror movie. It also features Sir Cedric Harwick and
Lowell Gilmore who you'll know from some old universal movies like Black Castle and
other TV roles. The script and directing and settings are great and the acting is
superb by all. No actor today could touch this. It also has a stage feel to it which
makes it even better. The transformation scenes are great for it's time. If you like
Jekyll and Hyde story with Jack Palance which is also excellent you'll love this. I
know most horror fans today would find this old looking and boring. too bad it's great!",1364688000,,839,4.276729559748428
7965171,2,B000068QMQ,"This is such an excellent film, I hate to give this low rating, but it is due entirely to the absolutly horrid DVD release from Rhino.  This was an episode from ""Climax"".  On this DVD, they have actually replaced all the original beginning and ending titles with their own.  While the DVD looks sharper than the VHS, the VHS is completely original with all titles and commercials.  If I had to chose, I'd take the VHS.",1284508800,,418,4.4605263157894735
7965172,5,B000068QMQ,"This film version is crisp and straight forward. Gore Vidal adapted it and in Black and White it is effective. This production is Spartan in effects and sets, yet contains the core essence that Robert Louis Stevenson imbued his book with.
  The grace of the actors is displayed, and the evil of Hyde is represented by a Mole (with hair) that grows upon his face as THE major change of personalities.
  The chracter differences are subtle and sublime compared to other versions.",1061769600,4,477,4.780487804878049
