3721081,1,B001NPDO90,"As adults who grew up watching the classic animations ""the year without a santa claus"" and ""rudolph the red-nosed reindeer,"" we really wanted to like this, but it just doesn't compare to the old classics of yesteryear.  maybe it's because we watched the old shows for years, and maybe that holds a bit of nostalgia because of our childhood, but this pale rip off of the rankin-bass animations of the 60's is really off the mark.  it has none of the charm or fun of the originals, not does it have any of the memorable characters or music.  it LOOKS really great, and the style of animation is very true to the old shows, but the writing is just dreadful.
the only good part is the re-hashing of the old song between the Miser bros.from the first ""year without..."" someone obviously spent a great deal of effort to recreate the look and style of the genre, and the animation IS well done, and it has moments of cuteness, but, for anyone who loved the original, and is over 5 years old, this show is really LAME!",1261267200,23,1010,4.419354838709677
3721082,1,B001NPDO90,"The ""sequel"" to the beloved Rankin & Bass classic is just a pathetic mess from beginning to end. The colors are foreign, the acting uninspired, the characters paper thin. The close up perspective of the scenes lacks depth; you do not get a felling that an entire world lies outside the camera's frame as you do with the classic. And poor Heat Miser and Snow miser look pathetic (note Heat Misers picture on the DVD box looks nothing like the pathetic impostor in the show). And don't get me started on Mrs Clause or the insipid Little People clamation video inspired ""elves"" (the original elves were far to embarrassed to be a part of the debacle). Beyond all this the story seems torn between attempting at one moment to appeal to the melba toast morality of mothers of toddlers and the next trying and painfully failing at appealing to adults (witness the creepy, charmless flying henchmen of the obnoxious villain). There is just nothing here but a faint twisted shadow of the original. Don't waste your money (instead send it to me to compensate me for the 45 minutes of my life I will never get back)... Some one, please make a special in the true spirit of R&B, or, at very least, one that sort of looks like the original... Merry Christmas",1260921600,26,1246,4.591928251121076
3721083,2,B001NPDO90,"I will give this 2 stars for nice stop-motion animation and colorful sets.  They tried but they had a lousy story to work with.  I realize that Rankin-Bass is history now but the ""modern"" take on these characters and the ""new"" story is just wrong on so many levels.

Mrs. Claus has none of the charm of the Shirley Booth character in the original ""The Year Without a Santa Claus"" and she looks like she is about 50 years older than Santa and she can't sing.  Santa also lacks the charm of the original although still voiced by Mickey Rooney.  The new elves, while admirably diverse, are charmless too and lacking lovability, especially the head elf who sounds like an accountant instead of one of Santa's jolly helpers.  How modernly droll (not).

The Miser Brothers are OK but the new ""improved"" CEO version of Mother Nature and the huge-chinned North Wind? What on Earth? A useless peripheral character with zero interest as a villain.

The music is the worst I've heard on one of these, sounding like someone's teenager wrote it in the garage on their WalMart guitar in about 2 days.  You won't be singing these songs again and again nor hearing them covered by any recording artist on a Christmas album.  The original Misers song is the only highlight musically.

Too bad -- I really wanted to like this.  A poor effort at capturing the magic of the old Christmas stop motion specials clearly made to make money and not delight children and adults alike.",1260576000,34,1458,4.63035019455253
3721084,5,B001NPDO90,"I bought this for my 11-year old and he LOVES it! In fact, he's already watched it three times.

Because I'm a fan of the old-school Rankin/Bass stop-motion cartoons, including The Year Without a Santa Claus, I thought the Miser Brothers' Christmas would be a nice addition to our holiday collection (especially since the Heat Miser song has been a staple with me for decades!)

Even my husband liked this 44-minute DVD. In a nutshell, Mother Nature has a family reunion with her ""children"", including The Tides, Earthquake, North Wind and the Miser Brothers (Heat Miser and Snow Miser).

The narcissistic lavender-hued North Wind poses an unusual question during the meeting: if something happened to Santa Claus, who would deliver the presents to the good children? Since the North Pole falls under the domain of the North Wind, it's determined that he would be in charge.

Enter evil plan to destroy Santa and take over Christmas!

Will the Heat Miser and Snow Miser be able to put aside their differences to help Santa? And what happens when Santa throws out his back right before Christmas? Who sabotaged Santa's sleigh...and can elf Tinsel, chief engineer, remedy the situation?

The animation is fantastic in this DVD (yes, it appears to be stop-motion!) The hair of the Heat Miser is especially cool, as is the slick icy mane of the Snow Miser.

If you enjoyed the Miser Brothers in The Year Without a Santa Claus, I think you and your children will like A Miser Brothers' Christmas. I know we did!

Reaching into the depth of my cold cold heart I went on amazon and ordered the movie, only to find out when it showed up that it was the sequel... I'm dumb.

My kids absolutely love this movie and you just can't find it on streaming services, so if you want it you either have to wait for ABC Family to air it or buy the DVD.  Ever since it first aired on ABC Family my kids have felt that it is a must watch every year at Christmas and now it has grown on me too.  The Heat Miser/Snow Miser song is quite catchy and will end up sticking in you head for a long time after watching.  It is claymation in the style of the old Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer and Santa Clause is Coming to Town, so for me it also has a nostalgic quality that reminds me of my childhood and sitting in front of the TV enjoying those little movies every Christmas and since it never felt like Christmas to me until those had came on, I can really understand where they are coming from.",1470355200,,851,4.0476190476190474

3721401,3,B001NPDO90,"This is not the original movie. The original Rankin/Bass classic is titled A Year without a Santa Claus.
While this movie does offer some parallels to the originalSantas visit from the doctor, the miser brother feud, the accident between the Miser Brothers territory it is better to view it as an original project rather than a sequel or remake.
Synopsis: Santas sleigh flies in between Heat Miser and Snow Misers territories while they are feuding and falls out of the sky. Santa is injured and the brothers, who are blamed for the incident, are now responsible for Christmas.
The movie elaborates on some aspects touched upon by the original filmit gives the brothers a backstoryand includes the original Heat Miser and Snow Miser songs along with some original music.
The movie displays interesting textures: the wood looks like wood, the clouds (in certain scenes) look like cotton, the rocks look like rocks, the ice looks like icethe fire looks out of place in some scenes because the CG animation does not always blend well with the stop motion animation. Attempting to mimic the stop motion animation of the original is admirable, and while this version does hold its own charm, the newer materials and methods give the show a markedly different look from the original special (which may come as a shock to those who are expecting a more exact duplicate of the Rankin/Bass classic).
If you enjoyed the original A Year without a Santa Claus and Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause (the dynamic is similar), you will probably enjoy this movie.",1393804800,,1547,4.885931558935361

But instead this stop-motion animation feature never went there. The North Wind character tagged as the bad guy didn't get much of an introduction either. The music was not as good as what they used to do for these... indeed, the reason anyone remembers the original special was because of the Miser Brothers songs. And the premise of the story is that both brothers were pretty ambivalent about Santa, but Year Without a Santa Claus Snow Miser loved Santa Claus. What happened? There's nothing like that here, although when the do try to revamp them it's the best part of the show. And the premise of the story is that both brothers were pretty ambivalent about Santa, but in the other film Snow Miser loved Santa Claus... it was just Heat Miser who didn't have any use for him.

I agree that the worst things were the change (look) of Mrs. Claus. Her hair was styled up with a rubber band looking thing like you would do for a Barbie doll. The original Mrs. Clause was adorable both physically, and vocally. The songs were AWFUUUUUUUUULLLLLLLLLL, and the wind villian was just full of hot air. He really wasn't necessary in the story, and made for a predictable villian/movie out come. I loved how they got Mickey Rooney to play Santa Claus again. They gave santa a good joyful feel to his character. I also enjoyed the physical re-design of the Santa character. Also, I didn't mind the changes they had made to mother nature. In the first movie I never cared for her looks (a swamp hag with bad fashion sense). At least in this version her physical appearance was cute. I loved her voice. It was soothing to hear. I don't know how I feel about the subtle changes they had made to the brothers? Snow looked a little too harsh...Heat basically looked the same, but had new clothes. To get to the over all point, this is a movie that will keep kids occupide while you wrap Christmas gifts. However, for the adults who just want to see a sequel, then understand you can't have high expectations on this film. Enjoy it for what it offers you.

Bad: It's Ranken & Bass without Ranken & Bass...different director, different song writer, some of the character designs are off too.
