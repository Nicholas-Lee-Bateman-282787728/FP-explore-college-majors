8345463,5,B001V5K3N2,"Until now the Polish contribution to the allies taking Monte Cassino has been never been told in any documentary or movie about this very important battle of WW11.  At best it was only briefly mentioned at the end of a documentary on the subject but never fully explored.  While Monte Cassino was truly a bloody conflict, and involved the participation of many allied forces including Americans, British, Indians, French Colonials, Canadians, South Africans, New Zealanders and the Poles, it was the Polish forces and their sheer guts and determination who won the final battle and opened the way to liberate Rome from the German and Italian fascist forces.  At last some of the surviving Polish veterans were given their long overdue opportunity to tell their story.  The documentary covered every facet of the battle and also had American and British veterans recount their stories of what was one of the bloodiest battles of WW11.",1333584000,5,933,5.038961038961039
