8191120,4,B000PFU8IO,"The video quality of this DVD is not the greatest.  Its a single camera filming a didactic presentation made in the 90's. the material is interesting and Turner is certainly knowledge on the top of behavior and training. If you can put up with the video quality it's worthwhile. Many of the behavioral principles discussed are still relevant. However it is not easy to see the graphics which are shown on an old overhead projector which is filmed from a distance with a single camera.
If you are very interested in academics about behavior and you don't mind poor quality filming this is a worthwhile watch.",1373414400,,607,4.726415094339623
