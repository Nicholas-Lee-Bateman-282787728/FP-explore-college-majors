The fun toy train layouts keep his interest and he dances and sings along with the music.  Within two weeks my son has all the music memorized.  His favorite songs include ""smooth operator"", ""I've been working on the rail road"" and ""old macdonald had a train.""  Fun video.",1342051200,,406,4.2894736842105265
