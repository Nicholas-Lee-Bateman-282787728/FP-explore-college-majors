This is a perfect film for the entire family.",1034035200,2,173,4.612903225806452
196371,5,1577421531,"This movie is an artful combination of humor, moral instruction, and a reminder of what is really important in life. It is beautifully written and the acting is fantastic.",1018483200,7,171,4.931034482758621
196372,4,1577421531,"Grace McQueen is a senior citizen looking for an opportunity to be of service. She's turned down by agency after agency until she decides to do what she loves;story telling. She manages to get a spot on a public tv station and becomes a hit. Then the fun begins. She is ""discovered"" by some ad executives who see a gold mine in exploiting her talents.
  A whirlwind of network ratings, make overs and new name (Granny Goodheart) overwhelms Grace. How she navigates through this mess is a delightful commentary about how we treat our elders, our own children and ourselves in a doggy eat dog world of our own making.
  Jessica Tandy is wonderful as Grace, the grandmotherly figure unwilling to let the studio bosses remake her image. Stephanie Zimbalist stars as the ad executive who is so caught up in her work to the point of neglecting what matters most, her daughter. In this film we re-aquaint ourselves with the taste of what it means to be a family and affirmed in one's old age.
  Now sit back and enjoy the Story Lady as she reads you a tale where ""they live happily ever after. The End.""",984614400,15,1096,4.51010101010101
196373,5,1577421531,"This is a cute story about an elderly lady (Jessica Tandy) who is moving in with her daughter and son-in-law.  She's feeling like she needs to be needed so she starts seeking things to do outside the home while they are at work.  She tries volunteering at the local school, library and hospital, all to no avail.  Then she discovers public television and starts reading stories to all who will listen.  When the networks takes notice it all snowballs from there.  Very good movie, clean, fun and entertaining!",1287187200,,509,4.738636363636363
196374,5,1577421531,"This DVD is a beautiful movie about a senior citizen who still has much to give. She contacts a cable TV station, and with their help begins a career as The Story Lady who recites the great fairytales by the Danish author Hans Christian Andersen. His stories are in safe hands in the magnificent actress of Jessica Tandy. Indeed worth while seeing many times!",1273449600,,359,4.625
196375,4,1577421531,"This was an excellent movie with Jessica Tandy starring as Grace an older lady who goes to live with her daughter. Lacking something to fill her time she reads stories on a public cable channel having her own show. It is truly captivating to listen to Tandy read these children's fairy tales that we all have grown up with. That is the special thing in the movie. An ad exec discovers her played by Stephanie Zimbalist and tries to make Grace over for network tv. Along the way Grace meets Alex- the ad exec's daughter whose mother (Zimbalist) never has time for her and they develop a relationship which is nice to see. This movie shows the importance of being yourself and when people are trying to change you- how to stick to your guns and not cave in to pressure and how tough it can be to find something to fill your hours as an older person who isn't working. Overall, a great movie that shows the importance of family and friends and staying true to who you are.",1233273600,,969,4.388888888888889
196376,1,1577421531,"It's a duplicated (""home-made"") DVD-R, not a commercial release. The cover looks nothing like what you see on Amazon, and it's not the high-quality Image Entertainment release. The cover art is an ugly, distorted looking image, and appears to be duplicated on a color copier.

The biggest reason you should not buy a DVD-R: it has no monetary value in the after-market, if you want to sell/trade it to a store in the future. Anybody can duplicate a commercial DVD; duplicates are always worthless, except as archival back-ups.

This is not a review of the movie, it's a review of the product itself and of Amazon's failure to respond to numerous complaints about this junk. You will be spending a high amount of money for something that has no value.",1232841600,8,750,4.7615384615384615
196377,1,1577421531,"Just a word of warning, the DVD of The Story Lady that Amazon is currently shipping is not the edition advertised. It IS NOT the original Image edition, but instead one from Screen Media Ventures, oh and it's a DVD-R. The cover is not even remotely close to the one shown on the page, the UPC code is a sticker stuck on the case, and again the back of the case says it's a DVD-R. Just wanted to make everyone aware before you purchase an inferior DVD-R and have to waste time trying to get a refund. Once Amazon creates a separate listing or stops selling this version as the long out of print Image DVD release, I will delete or modify this review.",1232323200,27,649,4.241935483870968
196378,5,1577421531,This is a heartwarming family friendly movie.  It would even be appropriate for the school setting.  Safe for children of any age to view.,1221868800,2,138,4.708333333333333
196379,5,1577421531,"My mother who loves this movie, she has looking for years. So one day I popped in my favorite place, Amazon and whala there it was. Thank you This has made her happy and it made me feel worthy.",1168560000,,193,3.9743589743589745
196380,5,1577421531,"There is not much Christmas in this movie, but there is a lesson to all workaholics, especially single parents. I love the Jessica Tandy-Hume Cronyn partnership, but she does very well on her own, along with quite a cast. It must be hard on a senior citizen to have to give up their independence and move in with their grown children, but Grace has enough spirit of her own to go so far as to star in her own cable show. It is too bad it didn't end there, but if it had, a young businesswoman growing apart from her daughter might never have seen the need to cut back on her work schedule to spend more time with her. Watching the mother, rushing from a late meeting to the school for her daughter's play reminds me so much of the father in Hook rushing from work to see his son's baseball game. Both parents miss out, but in the end, both are taught children need to come first in their lives, not work. In The Story Lady, I could understand Alexadra's disappointment that her mother missed her play, but got all teary-eyed when in the end she tells her mother she loves her. I know the actor who plays Grace's son-in-law from his role on Murder, She Wrote, and it was funny seeing Charles Durning playing a judge rather than Santa Claus as he does in Mrs. Santa Claus and It Nearly Wasn't Christmas, and Ed Begley, Jr. as a heartless jerk taking advantage of a seemingly-naive woman. I did find it a bit hard to swallow some of the goings-on (Granny Goodheart for one) but if I look forward to watching it every year, there must be a good reason.",1167523200,,1548,4.304794520547945
196381,5,1577421531,"I am more used to movies starring the husband and wife team of Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn. However, Tandy sparkles in this delightful tale of a ""senior citizen"" who didn't quit. When advanced age caused her to move in with her grown daughter and son-in-law, she found she had too much time on her hands, and went looking for work. After being turned down again and again, she stumbled upon a channel on the TV that interested her. After being told anybody, through cable-access TV, could have their own show, she went for it, and a world of children with busy parents found themselves seated in front of their sets while Grace read stories out of a book. The TV studio producer, enchanted by her, came up with a title for her show -- The Story Lady. One young lady who got hooked on it introduced it to her mother, a TV ad exec (played by Stephanie Zimbelist), and that's where the story takes off. She and her partner, played by Ed Begley, Jr., convince Grace to sign a contract, and try to take control of her. But Grace, and we viewers, find out in the end she proves more than a match for them. A final escapade lands Grace in trouble with the law, but again her indomitable spirit wins out, and she ends up teaching the judge (played by Charles Durning) how to portray himself as Toad of Toad Hall to his daughter. Funny, warm, fast-paced, sentimental, and very delightful.",1096243200,7,1381,4.462450592885376

Two years ago, I found it online and bought copies for all of them (they are grown now) and gave them that as a Christmas gift.  It's funny, warm, and has a great storyline.

7799053,5,1577421531,The video was magnificent. I bought it for my 80 year old mother after she had been a widow for about a year. I had seen the movie on TV and just had to share with my mother. It is a warm and uplifting movie.,1356048000,,208,3.6444444444444444

7799055,5,1577421531,"The plot has been very completely and well written, about all I can add is that this was one of Jessica Tandy's last movies and somehow got overlooked.  However, it is a genuinely warm and entertaining movie with the moral that well meaning senior citizens are often lost in the fast paced whirl of modern society.",1293235200,,314,4.607142857142857
7799056,5,1577421531,"Since so few good family movies are being made today I find myself looking back to the older films especially with Jessica Tandy and actors of that genre.
This is a wonderful example of how entertaining a movie can be when the immagination is enticed and the moral of the story is about the importance
