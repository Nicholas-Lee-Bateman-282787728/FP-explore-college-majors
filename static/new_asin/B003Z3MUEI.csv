4232189,4,B003Z3MUEI,"i am delighted that timeless is releasing season two, i have watched season one, all 39 episodes too many times to count.....

however looking at the photo above, this item has the appearance of having the same horrible packaging as season one....it is difficult to comprehend why the producers of this product would do this again.....i do hope my observation regarding this is wrong, wrong, wrong.....

my season one arrived with scratches and scuff marks on the disks, so i ordered a second set and lucky for me i had not gotten to UPS quick enough to return the first set, as the second set was even worse than the first....i kept the first and i bear with the skips.

it is pitiful to pay so much money and have new disk arrive in that condition,  i have purchased many a used dvd and cd and they arrived in flawless condition for a fraction of the original price....",1282780800,30,871,4.493670886075949

4232212,5,B003Z3MUEI,With a jazzy new theme song Wagon Train hit a high note and presented some 37 episodes in the 1957-58 season. Ernest Borgnine once again guest stars as do many other Hollywood legends. Ann Blyth plays two roles in one particularly dramatic episode.  The previously minor characters of Bill and Charlie are given more to do and really flesh out the series.  No special features.,1504051200,,377,4.7846153846153845
4232213,4,B003Z3MUEI,I bought these as a gift because the recipient loves Wagon Train. They were so happy with it. My only gripe is that you can't get continuous play. You have to always select the episode manually to play.,1498867200,,202,4.342105263157895

4232260,5,B003Z3MUEI,"They had a winning formula, but changed the format a bit downgrading the show. It's still a winner, but was better. The problem is that the two main characters Ward Bond and Robert Horton are in very few shows together. They play off each other very nicely and make the show great. What the producers did was put them in shows separately alternating shows with each of them. It's a real shame because they add a certain enjoyment to the stories. Ward Bond has a commanding presence that is unchallengeable, but, Robert Horton challenges him at every turn making for wonderful episodes. With only one of them in each episode you lose that banter between them. Overall the stories are still very good, well written and the acting is superb. There is a very special episode that made me cry and would make the most hardened of you cry about a dying little girl and a Christmas party, along with her friend a rough bad girl. Who turns out to be a good person inside. There is another great story with Betty Davis, and one with Lou Costello playing a drunk with a little girl he became custodian of.  There is another great story with the always wonderful Dan Duryea. There are many memorable episodes in this set making well worth the investment.  There are a few episodes with both main characters and those are of course the best episodes. The first season was better but this season is good.

4232285,5,B003Z3MUEI,"The second season of one of TV's most popular and best-loved Westerns takes up almost exactly where the first left off, as Major Seth Adams (Ward Bond) and long-time friends Bill Hawks (Terry Wilson) and Charlie Wooster (Frank McGrath), vacationing in San Francisco after their long journey west, manage to get themselves shanghaiied in Around the Horn, while scout Flint McCullough (Robert Horton) calmly travels overland with never a hint of their situation.  (It's notable that while Hawks is described as a married man in both the first and final segments of this season, we never see his wife Emily again, and by Third she's no longer mentioned at all.)  What follows is 37 further episodes of adventure and human conflict, illuminated by many noted Hollywood stars, including comic Lou Costello (of Abbott &) in his only dramatic role as a drifter far too fond of the bottle who's redeemed by his bond with a 12-year-old girl, and Bette Davis as the widowed mother of seven youngsters who suddenly learns that she's dying and must make provisions for her children's future.  There's Cliff Robertson as an Irish freedom-fighter on the trail of an informer, Jane Wyman as a lady doctor struggling to cope with social censure, Chill Wills as a one-eyed scout, James Coburn as a stagecoach robber, Sessue Hayakawa as a samurai trying to return his dead master's ashes to Japan, Virginia Mayo as a king rancher's daughter struggling to carry on as her father would have wished, Patty McCormack (""The Bad Seed"") as a rebellious young girl whose only chance for redemption lies with her friendship with an invalid counterpart, Anne Baxter as a dance-hall girl who takes in an orphaned Indian infant (with Henry Hull a delight as the spry oldster who becomes her greatest partisan and helper), Lloyd Nolan as a veteran gold hunter whose discovery of the precious metal threatens the entire train, Dan Duryea as the only survivor of a party that perished in a mountain winter, J. Carroll Naish as the sly father of a gang of robber brothers, Brian Donlevy as an undercover police detective, Phyllis Thaxter as a hopeful maiden lady, Anna Maria Alberghetti as a Comanchero's daughter, Vera Miles as a nun, Richard Anderson as a one-armed Quaker doctor who may be the only chance for a party stricken with sickness, Wally Cox as a westbound schoolteacher, Cameron Mitchell as a fugitive trying to escape his past and doing pretty well at it till he's spotted by a lawman, Robert Loggia as a Californio adopted by the Pawnee, Ann Blyth in a dual role as a maimed San Francisco singer and her daughter, and many others.  A young Dean Stockwell (of ""Quantum Leap"") appears twiceonce as a Mexican youth who witnessed his father's hanging and is out to even the score, and once as a white one who was taken in and raised by a Cheyenne exile after his parents were murdered.  So does Robert Fuller (who in the final two seasons of the series would play scout Cooper Smith), once as a recently-married young gambler who must fight to survive the snow and cold when his wife is severely injured and he has to stay behind with her while the train goes on to find a doctor, and once in a delightful small role as the 18-year-old suitor of Bette Davis's oldest daughter; and John McIntire, who would take over as Christopher Hale after Ward Bond's death, shows up as outcast preacher Andrew... Hale!  (Chris's brother?!)

Continuity, as is often true of Golden Era TV Westerns, often leaves something to be desired: this season is variously said to be six years since the end of the war (1871), five years since its early stages (1866), and ten years since 1860.  The writers also haven't done their research about Indians, and much of the costume and culture of the red men should be taken with a large grain of salt.  And geography's a bit muddled: a wagon train crossing to California shouldn't encounter threatening snowor the debri of a party lost in last year'suntil the Sierras, but several segments focusing on that threat seem to take place in the Rockies.  Still, there's plenty of drama, excitement, romance, andthe great strength of this serieshuman emotion, change, and conflict, not to speak of at least one female director (Bretaigne Windust, whose name appears on several segments) and a frequent female scriptwriter (Jean Holloway), both unusual for the time and genre.  Anyone who loves Westerns of this era can't consider his DVD collection complete without a row of embossed tin arch-top boxes on his shelf.",1395705600,5,4511,4.830310880829016

I've had problems many times before with DVD products from this company.  Sometimes, I had to return box sets three times before I managed to finally get one that was satisfactory.  Actually, the stores that I purchased the DVD sets from were nice enough to allow me to switch the defective discs with ones from another set.  After going back three times to do this, FINALLY, I managed to get me a DVD box set that had no defective DVD dics.  I really had to work hard for it.  This company has a lot of good Western TV shows out in DVD box sets, unfortunately, a lot of those DVD box sts contain low-quality discs that are defective.

To this day, fans (old and new) write to websites extolling the virtues of the show and how it influenced them to be better people and instilled good values in their lives.

This second season collection is an improvement upon the first season as the discs are now easier to remove and replace in their cardboard sleeves.  Timeless Video has done a great job on the graphics.

We can soon enjoy the third season which will be availabe for distribution in May.  Hopefully, Timeless will continue to publish the fourth and fifth seasons which completed the best of the 8 years in which the show ran.

These seasoned professions play off each other with hilarious results. The picture on these Wagon Trains is crisp and bright, not like the muddy looking versions with muffled sound that aired on broadcast and cable reruns for decades. It still amazes me that with such quality, nearly 40 hour long episodes were produced per season for much of the show's run.

4232333,5,B003Z3MUEI,"Loved the westerns of the 1950's & this was one of the best. Ward Bond set the tone & was the father figure that was missed when he passed on. I love the music & it's the intangible things that really makes this series special..things that might not seem important, but adds historical & ironic significance to the well written stories as they unfold. The goods the wagons were carrying...things we take for granted..water, shelter for the night...how our ancestors crossed the continent in these wagons still amazes me. Clarity of picture is excellent & I have no problem with the tin the discs came in. I took other's advice & bought the 2nd season (you reviewers out there do help me make purchases..thanks). Sure brings back great memories. BUY!",1295654400,21,749,4.769230769230769
4232334,5,B003Z3MUEI,"My set arrived recently. Had no problems with packaging or dvd hanging up or not playing.

I am so pleased to own Wagon Train, Season 2. I am looking forward to Seasons 3 thru 5. Timeless Media I will buy those seasons, guaranteed.

Sound quality is above average. Screen shots are excellent. Can't say enough good things about this dvd set.

The show! My oh my. One of the greatest ever produced and brought to the tv screen. Thank you for giving me joy in seeing this show again. I have such fond memories of this show. Ward Bond and Robert Horton were magic together. There is just no other word ""magic"".

I am so looking forward to Seasons 3 - 5. Timeless please make it happen.",1294876800,17,682,4.346456692913386
4232335,5,B003Z3MUEI,wagon train was a greatly admired tvshow during ward bond's tenure. These shows were well written and the on screen chemistry between Ward and Robert Horton ws great. There are imperfections in the episodes but you're warned about that in the beginning. As usual Amazon delivired the goods in a timely fashion.,1293494400,13,310,4.980769230769231
4232336,5,B003Z3MUEI,"Wagon Train is my all time favorite TV show & I'm very pleased with the season 2 DVD set recently released by Timeless Video.
The content is what really makes the set great.  Of all the seasons of Wagon Train this is the one with the most really good episodes. Some favorites are Jennifer Churchill (romantic comedy with Rhonda Fleming) , Millie Davis (tender and amusing, James Coburn as Three Fingered Ike in a small role), Steve Campden (snow, cave, saber tooth tiger), Mary Ellen Thomas (with a Christmas theme), Sister Rita (with Vera Miles), and The Last Man (with Dan Duryea). Many of these are very good ""Flint"" stories.

Picture quality is excellent, revealing details about clothing and expressions that couldn't be seen on videos made from capturing the programs from TV.  Episodes tend to run 50 minutes, or as long as 50 minutes 25 seconds, with some footage not on any TV airing in recent years.

My friends and I haven't noticed any imperfections in our season 2 discs (no spots where the the discs skip or hang while playing an episode.)  (Some season 1 sets did have an imperfect disc or two that would skip or hang on some DVD players.)

The packaging (cardboard book holding the DVDs, packaged in a tin box), wouldn't be my first choice, but Timeless does seem to have done something to improve the cardboard book.  Removing the season 2 discs from the cardboard book is easier than it was to remove the season 1 discs from their book.  (I have chosen to keep the discs in Tyvek sleeves in a small box to get to them with less chance of scratching, but I might be being over careful.)

If you liked the Wagon Train Season 1 set, you will like the Season 2 set even more.
If you don't have either and can only afford one, I recommend the season 2 set. Either set is very good viewing.
I hope to see seasons 3, 4, and 5 in the near future.",1292716800,61,1856,4.435294117647059
4232337,5,B003Z3MUEI,"I too was a cowboy-mad schoolboy when I first saw these episodes and am thrilled to see them again and to own them.  I think the embossed tins are fabulous.  If I'd just been given the tin when I was a lad, I'd have been in seventh heaven, never mind with the actual show inside.  I am very pleased with the quality of both sound and vision.  My only reservation when first placing my order for Season 1 was that the episodes might not have worn too well in story-telling terms, that they might be a little too corny by now.  Nothing of the sort, the dramas are well scripted for the most part and stand up.  There's also more western action than I realized or remembered.  I loved Wagon Train and now we get to see it all again.  I look forward to Season 3 and all the rest to come.",1292457600,24,783,4.105263157894737
4232338,5,B003Z3MUEI,"I am not one of those concerned about the price of such classics as ""Wagon Train"",
just very grateful to now own the first 2 seasons of that great western.
With the packaging I have simply transferred the discs onto proper containers,
that was done in the case of season 1  by throwing out episodes of ""Medium"" - having grown tired of Alisons moaning,
and replacing the containers with ""Wagon Train"".
Season 5&6 of ""Hawaii Five O"" met a similar fate, I believe having the first few seasons of that program are sufficient, then likewise ""Wagon Train"" season 2 filled those containers nicely.
I spent some time using a Library colour copier to give those covers a nice finish, yes it is a pain doing all this
but the outcome is worth it.
I placed the tin containers onto the copier then reduced the size to 90%.",1291939200,6,809,4.503401360544218
