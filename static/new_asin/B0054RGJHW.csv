8605240,5,B0054RGJHW,"The Flizbins series has an amazing message that yound children can understand. It's colors are bright, the songs good (without completely annoying the adults around), and the stories are cute. My toddler gets captivated by shows with music so when I let him watch TV this show is perfect!

The only downside is that there are only 2 shows. WE need more please!",1357516800,2,360,4.714285714285714
