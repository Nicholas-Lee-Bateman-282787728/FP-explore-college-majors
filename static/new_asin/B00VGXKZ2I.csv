8710086,1,B00VGXKZ2I,"Somebody must have physically/legally/emotionally blackmailed Bill Pullman (Independence Day. A League of Their Own) into staring in this train wreck. He's by no means a Hollywood heartthrob. But even he deserves better casting decisions.

The pilot has eldest son Skip Gilchrist (Josh Gad) having been kicked out of college for having started a fire. Being the president's son, he is not sent to prison. But he is also (mysteriously!) not hounded by the media either. Nope!!

Everything is nicely hush-hush in this alternate reality. Skip is free to continue screwing up again and again. And believe me he does.

He gets his next chance when ""accidentally"" talking about his sister's sexual escapades---and the fact that she has gotten pregnant from her boyfriend.  Whoops!! Tact really isn't one of his strong points.

When Skip is not divulging intimate details of his sister's personal life, he is helping unravel Dad's trade agreement and who knows what  else related to national security. Without being in school, Skip has plenty of free time to kick around the White House. So he uses it to cause all kinds of trouble for his family and the nation. How on earth is this 'cute' in an adult man?? After just 2 and 1/2 episodes, I wanted him locked up. I'm sure the fictional president certainly could have arranged it. So why on earth did this never happen???

Watching (or trying to watch) at least one of the episodes, you forget that Gad is not only playing the eldest son, but the oldest child. He comes across as an overgrown toddler on an overdose of caffeine and sugar. Not even the  Secret Service agents assigned to him can prevent mistakes. He just keeps giving the family stuff to deal with--as if they don't have the world to deal with.

Although the toddler would perhaps be carefully watched. I think this show was deliberately scripted to fail from inception. .",1441065600,,1881,4.834890965732087
