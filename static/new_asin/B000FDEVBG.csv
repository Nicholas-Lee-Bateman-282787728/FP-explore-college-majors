8120925,4,B000FDEVBG,"SAND TRAP veers between the extremes of film noir and lowbrow comedy with such ease that you'd wish you'd thought of it first. Not about golf, SAND TRAP is the story of how snotty Jack the Lawyer and Too-Sexy Margot decide to kill Margot's nebbishy heavily-insured husband, Nelson.

They try to kill him, except Jack and Margot could screw up a cup of coffee. Jack tosses Nelson off a 200 foot cliff in the New Mexico desert, but when Margot and Jack report the ""accident"" and lead the cops to the spot, there's no body. Panicked, Jack and Margot begin searching for Nelson's ""corpse,"" but never quite explain to the cops why they're looking for a dead man with a high-powered rifle in Jack's hands. The Sheriff's suspicious, but he can't add 2 + 2 and get 4. What makes it worse is that when they do find Nelson, it turns out that Jack can't hit The Great Wall Of China at three yards with a bazooka shot.

When poor sun-addled, injured Nelson realizes that Jack AND his beloved Margot want him dead, this balding four-eyes suddenly becomes a middle-aged John Rambo (CPA), a hunter-killer in Conan The Barbarian armor made of old hubcaps and stuff.

Alternately dark and silly and alarming and amusing, SAND TRAP is no Oscar winner, but it sure is entertaining.",1235347200,2,1262,4.6
8120926,4,B000FDEVBG,"Here we have your typical story of a wife-gone-bad (if she wasn't there already?) who teams up with the family's blood-sucking lawyer.  They both hatch an idea to team up & bump-off hubby so they can spend all his $$.

The cuckhold hubby starts out the film as a momma's boy who is scared of his own shadow.  After being trapped in the desert and finding out the truth about both his best friend (the blood-sucking lawyer) and wife being out for him, he morphs into a wild-animal who is out for revenge.  The story has some theatre-of-the-absurd elements in it as the film progresses.

Elizabeth Morehead steals the show as the sadistic but smokin' wife.  She seems to have a good time going back & forth between pretending to be the ""devoted wife"" and being the vindictive femme fatale.  She also looks terrific with her shirt off as well!

This is certainly not a movie that should be considered for Academy awards.  It has some things in it which untenable, such as a person being stuck in the desert for several days, ostensibly without any water @ all.  There is no debate about that.  However, for a ""B"" movie, it's pretty darn good and has an unbeatable price.",1206144000,4,1167,4.535885167464115
8120927,3,B000FDEVBG,"""Sand Trap"" is a straight-to-video movie that starts off pretty well, but runs out of steam in the second half. This is about a couple, Nelson and Margo Yeager, who head to the desert with a friend, Jack, who allegedly has a hot tip on some investment property. At the risk of revealing too much of the plot, I will only state that Jack has more in mind than purchasing land. What unfolds is a suspense film that is a little light on the tension. It eventually slides into the absurd as Nelson fashions a warrior outfit out of spare car parts and a couple has sex in front of someone they nearly kill, simply for the sake of advancing the plot. Nonetheless, there is enough here to hold modest interest, most notably a few scenes involving a topless Elizabeth Morehead. Ms. Morehead, who plays Margo in this film, is possibly best known as Noel, the concert pianist George Constanza dates in an episode of ""Seinfeld."" That alone is probably enough to recommend this film for some people. Aside from that, the acting is at least competent, the production values are decent and the transfer is good, even though it is presented full screen. Overall, you're not missing much if you miss this one. Film: 2.5/5; DVD: 3/5 stars",1194480000,3,1221,4.579908675799087
