8249513,3,B00139W14U,"This Time-Life release is one of a series of DVDs released under the banner ""The Golden Age of Comedy"" that focus on comedy shows and specials from the first dozen years or so of the then fledgling new medium of television.  ""Clubhouse Comedy"" contains three segments . . . a Phil Silvers special (post ""Sergeant Bilko"") from October 8, 1960, portions of ""The Ernie Kovacs Show"" circa May 1956, and a short clip from ""The Soupy Sales Show,"" broadcast on April 13, 1962.

I bought this release mainly for the Kovacs show as much of his television work is lost and, consequently, very little has been released on DVD.  Supposedly, the archivists at Koch Vision (the folks responsible for the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Studio-One-Anthology/dp/B001E1HCQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Studio One Anthology</a>) are working on what is expected to be the definitive DVD release of Ernie Kovacs' years on television.  Because so comparatively little was saved, what's here is not necessarily representative of Kovacs' best work, though real life wife Edie Adams does an amusing parody of Marilyn Monroe and Kovacs plays one of his regular characters, Percy Dovetonsils, in a funny skit.  However, ""The Ernie Kovacs Show"" ran a full hour (including commercial breaks) and this presentation runs just a little over 29 minutes, with no commercials.  Famed NBC announcer Bill Wendell can be glimpsed in this episode.

""The Phil Silvers Special"" is the longest of the segments on this disc, running about 35 minutes or so.  Even with the commercials shorn from the DVD presentation, the running time suggests that this special is incomplete; it's possible that Time-Life may have not been able to clear all of the performances.  It has its moments and was even written by Nat Hiken of ""Sgt. Bilko"" fame, but it's not top drawer Silvers.  Polly Bergen is engaging as Silvers' lone guest on the show.

The disc is rounded out with a bonus short (less than 5 minutes) of ""The Soupy Sales Show.""  Like Kovacs, many of Sales' shows are no longer in existence, so even a short clip is worth a view.  The short is a silent slapstick routine involving Soupy, a mailman and a garden hose.

All three segments on this DVD are sourced from kinescopes and, while watchable, the video leaves a bit to be desired; for the most part, the audio portion is acceptable.  Those interested in Kovacs' television work should also check out&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Best-of-Ernie-Kovacs/dp/B000056B07/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Best of Ernie Kovacs</a>, and fans of Soupy Sales have their choice of Soupy's 1960s show,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Soupy-Sales-In-Living-Black-White-B-W/dp/B000I2J6EG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Soupy Sales: In Living Black & White (B&W)</a>, and his 70s revival show,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Soupy-Sales-Collection-The-Whole-Gang-Is-Here/dp/B000DZ95NK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Soupy Sales Collection: The Whole Gang Is Here!</a>, though both of those DVD releases are becoming increasingly difficult to find.  CBS Paramount has given Phil Silvers a first-class release with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sgt-Bilko-50th-Anniversary-Edition-The-Phil-Silvers-Show/dp/B000EBGE9G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sgt. Bilko - 50th Anniversary Edition (The Phil Silvers Show)</a>&nbsp;but, to date, they have not followed up with season-by-season releases of that series.

Bottom Line:  Despite the less than stellar audio/video presentation (understandable given the source elements), fans of Phil Silvers, Ernie Kovacs and Soupy Sales will find this DVD to be a worthwhile addition to their collections.  My rating for ""Clubhouse Comedy"" is closer to *** & .",1238457600,4,3895,6.233208955223881
