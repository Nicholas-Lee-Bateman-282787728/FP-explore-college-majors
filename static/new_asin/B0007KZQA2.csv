8047823,5,B0007KZQA2,The movies were exciting and gave me a good chance to practice my fading French.  It is interesting to compare the French presentation of a crime thriller to our own.  The camera angles are possibly more insightful and original.  They are well worth the purchase price.,1274313600,,269,4.804347826086956
8047824,3,B0007KZQA2,"The movie itself is very good. Unfortunately, the film was made in French and dubbed in English. The quality of sound is poor. Such much so, that one cannot understand everything that is being said. I thought buying the DVD and using the subtitles in English would make the dialogue easier to follow. Not so. The subtitles do not match what is being said by the actors. They left out descriptions. They rephrase conversations completely. They botch up slang. They did a POOR job. It is amateurish and distracting. Good movie spoiled by shoddy translating.",1123459200,16,555,4.852631578947369
