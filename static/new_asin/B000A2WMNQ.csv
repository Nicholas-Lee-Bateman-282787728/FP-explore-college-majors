2352211,4,B000A2WMNQ,"Historic Classics 50 Movie Pack is a terrific bargain--if you like interesting, lower budget movies.  Other reviewers have listed the titles and actors; be sure to check those out.  You won't find any blockbusters on the list, but most of them are excellent stories, with good acting.

We've been spoiled with full color spectaculars with big name stars, like ""Troy"", starring Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom.  Many of the films in this collection are in black and white and feature actors you've never heard of--but they're very worth watching.

These are the kinds of movies they used to show on local TV stations after school, but that was 40 years ago.  For the price, this is a wonderful bargain, and you'll find some very pleasant surprises here.

I think you'll enjoy it!",1188345600,14,774,4.818181818181818

Users of a popular internet reference website specializing in films have rated on a 1 to 10 scale the 44 theatrical releases contained within the HISTORIC CLASSICS 50 MOVIE PACK.

The median number for all of these titles is: 5.2.

The lowest scoring film here is OLD TESTAMENT-- a foreign-made flick that got a 2.7, while the most popular title of this collection is the 1925 silent feature LADY WINDERMERE'S FAN, which rated a solid 7.7.

Use this overall number as a guideline only. It doesn't take into consideration condition of source material or quality of transfers. This reviewer purchased the HISTORIC CLASSICS box set with little reservation. The obscure titles (including four silent features) were enticing, and the incredibly reasonable price for such an enormous package made the decision that much easier.",1174780800,17,847,5.160583941605839

2352214,1,B000A2WMNQ,"These DVDs are poor quality.  Some have dubbed-in dialog, some are kinescopes from the 1950's, and all are grades below a B-rated movie.  The common denominator is the poor production by the original directors which no amount of nostalgia will forgive. The TV plays are really the bottom of the bottom.  Unlike ""I Love Lucy"" TV productions or full length movies from the 1950's, these have not withstood the test of time.",1156809600,15,421,4.819444444444445
2352215,3,B000A2WMNQ,"There are several of these 50 movie packs available (mystery, comedy, sci-fi, etc.) and for any fan of a particular genre, they are a good value even though the movies aren't top of the line entertainment. If you're in the mood to see a period piece and not really so interested in the quality of it, you can pop in one of these discs and be mindlessly entertained. Keep in mind that these movies were made without the budget and attention to detail of modern movies before purchasing them though. Many of the movies show the movie-making fads and limits of the eras they were made in. For instance, the movies made in the 50's through the 70's tend to be a bit overblown in their dialog and feature flimsy sets.

The packaging for these discs is actually pretty good considering the price. Two movies are on each side of 12 two-sided discs (4 movies each). Each disc come in light cardboard sleeve with the title of the movie, a synopsis of the plot, the main star and the running time. The sleeves come in a box which is about as big as two regular plastic DVD cases.

Personally, I'm rather glad these sorts of sets are released with the type of movies that will never be released in any other way. At about $16 for 50 movies, it doesn't take many hidden gems in the collection to make it well worth your while.",1155081600,59,1314,4.381147540983607

2352218,3,B000A2WMNQ,"This is a collection of 50 movies on 12 two-sided disks. All the films are historical classics, meaning they are based on history or famous literature, and that they are excellent productions, some of which are even famous. The collection includes both theatrical films and television productions from the 50's. There is also a companion, ""Mystery Classics: 50 Movie Pack.""

Many of the films are Biblical, including Constantine and the Cross, Saul & David, The Old Testament, Herod the Great, Esther and the King, The Pilgrimage Play, King Solomon's Treasure, David & Goliath, Our Daily Bread, Gideon & Samson, The Nativity and Pontius Pilate. Many are based on literature, like David Copperfield, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, Captain Scarlett, The Jungle Book, Oliver Twist, Little Men, The Legend of the Sea Wolf, Cyrano de Bergerac, Scrooge, Vanity Fair, Becky Sharp, Lady Windermere's Fan, The Three Musketeers, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and A Tale of Two Cities. Others are based on the lives of famous people, like Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther, Daniel Boone, Henry the VIII and His Six Wives, Man of the Forest, Betsy Ross, The Jackie Robinson Story, Spartacus and the Ten Gladiators, Scott of the Antarctic, The Emperor Jones and Trial of John Peter Zenger. There are many others - well, 50 in all.

All of these films feature actors of the first order: Orson Welles, Charlton Heston, Warren Beatty, John Carradine, Jose Ferrer, Sir Lawrence Olivier, Hugh Grant, Donald Pleasance, Edmund Purdom, Oliver Reed, Michael York, Sir John Gilgud, Ronald Colman, Myrna Loy, Thomas Mitchell, Keith Mitchell, Boris Karloff, Richard Greene, Sir Ralph Richardson, John Mills, Dame Edith Evans and more.

None of these films have been restored, so you can expect the range in quality to be from poor to good. Some of the films are silent. Some, as I said, are television dramas. Many of the films are Brittish or of other nationality. It's a mixed bag, but it contains many gems. This is your chance to see productions that may not be restored or available individually for years.

I've only seen the first two so far; but based on them, I'd recommend the lot. The first one was Constantine and the Cross, and was excellent. When I say excellent, I'm not referring to the quality of the transfer; I'm referring to the quality of the film as best I can make out from a poor reproduction. It stars Cornel Wilde as Constantine and is filmed in Italy by an Italian film company, but it is in English. The acting, sets, costumes, etc. are all excellent, and, because of the setting and film company, is full of Italian flavor.

The second film was A Bolt of Lightening, a Westinghouse Studio One television drama that was directed by one of my teachers from college! It stars Charlton Heston and is superb. When I say superb, you have to understand how television dramas were shot back in the 50's. Everything was live, so there was no editing and no retakes. While one scene was going on, the crew was setting up the next scene, just like in theatre. There's even one shot where the camera panned too far to the left and caught a shot of some of the crew through a window getting ready for the next scene. The DVD even includes the commercials, which were also shot live.

The thing to look for in these productions is the writing. I expect the writing all to be excellent, expecially in the television dramas. These latter were 45 minute dramas that stood or fell on their writing. You can easily see how they're structured, how they build dialogue, how they develop plot, how they work the camera angles. It's kind of a cross between theatre and film, but would be a good model for a young, independent filmmaker to follow. The acting in these dramas is also superb; but, like theatre, they contain a few flubbed lines.

You may be disappointed in the quality of the transfers for most of these films, especially since they haven't been restored - and especially for the television productions; but you won't be disappointed in the films themselves if you give them a chance. And, as I said, there are many gems here. With the television dramas, just realize that that is pretty close to the way television looked in the 50's. So it's an education, okay?

2352219,5,B000A2WMNQ,i have reviewed many of these 50 pack movies and as always you get some good some bad and some that can't be listed as anything. their are some very intresting movies here and more than a few silent movies also.once again if you are looking for great transfers stay away but if you are a little more bold you will find some gems in this batch. these films are mostly family friendly as are most of these sets so you can watch them as a family and not have to worry about anything you don't want your kids to see. take a chance and enjoy. for 40 to 50 cents a movie what have you got to lose.,1136419200,27,591,3.9747899159663866

8072891,5,B000A2WMNQ,I have seen many of the movies in my childhood. They were as good as in those days. I remembered my childhood.,1373328000,,110,4.045454545454546
8072892,2,B000A2WMNQ,"All of these movies are in the public domain.  If you own a television, you might catch some of them on classic movie stations for free (or for a prorated portion of your cable or satellite bill).  However, for people without satellite/cable or like me--I own a tiny LED DVD player but no TV--the best of these seem a reasonable buy.  This one, however, is not a good buy.

In every collection, there are a few gems, several mediocre to poor movies, and a few that would have been good had not it been for some single terrible choice.  (Horrendous scores and confusing editing are common means to destroy otherwise good raw footage).  I own five collections and the best, by far, is the mystery collection.  This one (which should be titled ""myth and literature,"" as I noticed little history, and most of that laughably inaccurate) is the worst of the collections, and I'll get rid of it, as none of the films were so good that I'd want to see them again.

Serious students of film might enjoy some of the bad films because they are by important directors (like the awful Abraham Lincoln by Griffith, which only a film student could love), and they would surely tolerate the silent films better than I do.  Typical mainstream people wouldn't tolerate the black and white, which most of the films are, but I prefer black and white to color, I can tolerate a few scratches and missing frames, and as a less-than-serious fan of film, I've enjoyed that these collections have turned me on to one dead actor and one cinematographer who impressed me so much that I sought out other work by them.

The silent films in every collection are made worse by this company simply tossing any old public domain music over scenes whose mood doesn't match the music--so you'll get ""Pomp and Circumstance"" blaring over a tender love scene--and this is much, much worse than no music at all, so I strongly advise watching the silent movies with the sound turned off.  I bet you my life savings that they could have gotten some senior in a B.F.A. music theory program to edit the same music more appropriately, scene by scene, for free, just to get the line on their resume.  In other words, the cheapness of this company, I understand: pay nothing for the movies, do little with them, and sell them in a cheap cardboard box at a low but profitable price.  Cheap and stupid, I don't understand, and they are that in their scoring of the silent films.

This collection's highlights for me were a few TV teleplays from the 1950's, most more impressive when you realize they were performed live yet without sets falling down noisily or extras' footsteps being heard as they rush to the upcoming scene.  (Nor could you easily see these old teleplays anywhere else, I imagine.)  I enjoyed the one-hour version of A Tale of Two Cities, starring Wendell Corey while he still had some flesh and health.  The bulk of the central story is there, and that they crammed it into an hour without making it feel rushed is impressive.  I also enjoyed the teleplay that examined the night the War of the Worlds radio broadcast caused hysteria across the U.S., which has the bonus treat of showing a couple of now-famous actors in bit roles in their youth.  In theatrical release films, the Jackie Robinson Story is sweet and good 20th century history (and a ""lest we forget"" lesson), and the documentary of the British ""conquest"" of Everest is mildly interesting.  Kansas Pacific is okay.  The biggest tragedy of the collection was the film set in Napoleon's exile, which was wonderfully acted but so badly scored I literally winced throughout, as if I were being slapped upside of the head every time I began to enjoy a scene.

So I'd say the entertainment value of the half-dozen tolerable films in here was a buck per film.  Even considering that I'll get back half the cost re-selling it, this still makes the collection overpriced.  Again, other titles among these collections seemed a better value to me.",1245196800,,3973,4.659025787965616

This deal is even better when you consider that many of the movies in this collection are available as individual movie DVD's at prices of $5 and higher. Many of the movies in this collection are presented in better condition than they are from other DVD companies.

8072898,4,B000A2WMNQ,"Having read all of the reviews for Historic Classics 50 Movie Pack, I have to say I'm not quite sure what the reviewers who rated this box set 1 or 2 stars were expecting. I own other sets in the '50 movies' series distributed by Mill Creek, and this review could easily apply to all of them, as well.

Yes, the video and audio quality on most of the movies are sub-par, and yes, none of them are really what you can call 'classics' (the title of this box set notwithstanding), but pay attention, people. What are we talking here? 50 cents a movie? You can buy a used set in great condition for around 15-20 bucks, which comes to even less per movie. There are fifty, count 'em FIFTY movies here! What were you expecting for that price? Were you really expecting great picture quality and flawless Dolby stereo sound? You probably should have taken the time to read the reviews here and you would have known better.

The quality of these movies isn't THAT bad. I have seen about half of them so far, and I have had no problem making out what's happening on my screen, nor have I had to wish the movies came with subtitles; I can understand the dialog just fine. For the price I paid for this set, it's a steal!

As others have said, these are mostly 'B' and 'C' grade flicks, but there are a surprising number of big name stars here. There's something about watching old movies that are still fairly grainy that I like. I don't know, maybe it brings back memories of when these same movies were shown on late-night TV. Remember how those old movies looked? They weren't restored and spit-shined, they were sort of grainy yet very enjoyable nonetheless. That's what you get here, folks. Nothing fancy. No blockbusters.

As a big fan of old-time radio, I find these old-time movies to be a lot of fun! Yeah, a stinker now and then will raise it's ugly head, but the old saying is so true, 'They don't make 'em like they used to', especially in today's modern Hollywood that spits out crap on a regular basis. No, in this box set you will not find nudity, foul language, sexual innuendos every five minutes, special effects to cover up a poor plot and the obligatory, ever-increasingly annoying computer graphics. What you do get are entertaining old movies, many of which cannot be found anywhere else on DVD in any condition.

So, if you're willing to part with a few paltry bucks, I daresay you will find this more than a bargain. That is, IF you know what to expect up front!
