8199670,3,B000R9COEO,"I give three stars not for the movie, which is a favorite classic, but because of the dvd.  There are better versions on you tube. No chapter selection. No main menu. If you try to advance, not ff, you go straight to the end. It was not remastered and of all the classics this one should be remastered. Poorly edited line cut out.  Shame it was treated in this manner.",1452124800,,368,4.242857142857143
8199671,5,B000R9COEO,This review doesn't review the movie only. I read all the reviews so I could understand why in the world this movie would not be a solid five stars!  The complains were not about the content of the movie but about the quality of the DVD. I believe I also ordered this movie and the picture quality was not as good as I had hoped but I love the movie!!!! My whole family does very much and we watch it often. If you haven't seen it before I'd rather see it this way then not at all. It is worth it!,1445990400,2,497,3.9207920792079207
8199672,1,B000R9COEO,"Im very disappointed in this dvd.  There are quite a few parts that have been taken out of it.  I purchased a VHS quite some time ago and have watched it many many times (one of my favorite movies) so when I started updating my movies to DVDs, it was so obvious parts were taken out.",1424131200,2,283,4.035714285714286
8199673,5,B000R9COEO,"This movie was made 78 years ago and I was amazed that you had it on DVD.  I was so pleased to purchase it, mostly as a token to the past.  I used to ask my son to call me 'Dearest' just as little Lord Fauntelroy called his mother.  (He did once!)",1403654400,,247,3.7115384615384617
8199674,1,B000R9COEO,"I ordered this movie for my husband as a stocking stuffer for Christmas.  Boy were we surprised when he slipped the disk in and on came ""Mandingo"".  What gives?  A lack of quality control somewhere, I think.  I am returning it ASAP.
I have never had a problem before, this is definitely a first.",1324857600,,295,4.407407407407407
8199675,5,B000R9COEO,"This story has been filmed several times through the centuries. Each brings with it the strengths and weaknesses of the time period in which it was made. A few examples are:
1914 - Gerald Royston - Cedric Erroll
1921 - Mary Pickford - Little Lord Fauntleroy/Dearest
1936 - Freddy Bartholomew - Cedric `Ceddie' Erroll
1976 - Glen Anderson - Lord Fauntleroy
1980 - Rick Schroder - Lord Fauntleroy (Ceddie Errol)
1995 - Michael Benz - Cedric Errol
2003 - Aleksei Vesyolkin - Cedric

As with any story everyone has there favorite interpretation. This is a review of the 1936 version.

Ceddie (Freddy Bartholomew) is a well meaning kid, which is wise beyond his years and very well mannered. He lives alone with his mother Dearest (Dolores Costello Barrymore.) He is the product of his environment (America depression era) where he is mentored by a wise grocer (Guy Kibbee,) and befriended by others such as the shoe shine boy (Mickey Rooney.)

Turns out that he is the long lost grandson of the Earl of DorinCourt (C. Aubrey Smith,) and heir to an estate in England. So he is ""Little Lord Fauntleroy."" He is removed from the only home he knows and whisked off to England. There he does not realize that his grandfather can not stand his mother (they never met) so she has to stay in another house.

All is going swimmingly until the ""Real Little Lord Fauntleroy"" the son of the other brother shows up. Now what will happen? Is `Ceddie' destined to be second fiddle? Will his mother go back to America? What do his old friends think when they find out? Looks like curtains for everyone.",1292716800,2,1581,4.655913978494624
8199676,5,B000R9COEO,"This movie has always been a favorite. I taped it when it was on TV, and
now I have it on DVD. I couldn't be happier!",1221004800,,117,3.5384615384615383
