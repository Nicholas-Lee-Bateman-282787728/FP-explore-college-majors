4445660,5,B004QL7JTE,"A movie with a remarkable soundtrack and a father-son depiction that feels real and is not smothered in nostalgia.  There is a Grateful Dead concert scene that is a little weak, but other than that, a great film.",1312588800,2,212,4.578947368421052
4445661,4,B004QL7JTE,"I saw this film the first week it came out. The story itself was very moving, the acting was also wonderful. The Greatful Dead scene was a little too fake for me, but the film overall was great and I am ordering the DVD now!",1312416000,3,224,4.0
4445662,5,B004QL7JTE,"""Music elicits measurable responses in the brain's activity"" After Henry (Simmons) has a fight with his son Gabriel (Pucci), he decides that home is no longer for him and leaves. 20 years later Gabriel is found with a brain tumor that eliminates long term memory. After thinking he is still in the sixties his parents struggle to find a way to communicate with him. When a therapist discovers that music is the answer his parents have to adjust their lives to get their son back. This is an amazing movie. Much like ""Barney's Version"" and ""Trust"", this is a movie that didn't get the advertising that this deserved and will not be seen by the audience it should have. An extremely touching movie that deals with a strained father and son relationship, and the struggle to reconnect. There is not enough good things I can say about this movie. Much like ""Trust"" this is a movie that has the possibility of helping people and can become much more then just a movie. I cannot recommend this enough, do yourself a favor and watch this movie. You will be moved to tears and be left with an absolutely satisfying feeling. Why can't more movies be this way? Overall, one of the best movies in the last 10 years, and next to ""Barney's Version"" the best movie of the year. I easily give it an A+.

Would I watch again? - Absolutely.

*Also try - Barney's Version & Mr. Holland's Opus",1311984000,5,1374,4.514056224899599
4445663,5,B004QL7JTE,"""(Rhythm) is there in the cycles of the seasons, in the migrations of the birds and animals, in the fruiting and withering of plants, and in the birth, maturation and death of ourselves,"" -Mickey Hart (Grateful Dead)

What is it about music that resonates so much with people?  Is it chemical?  A part of the brain that responds to the frequencies and rhythm of certain sounds played in a progression?  Or, is it just the fact that it makes one ""feel"" something?

Music, like any other form of art brings out a ""feeling"" in the one experiencing it.  Those feelings will be different for everyone and some will be permanently effected by them.  Music can do many things.  It can heal, damage, make you dance, give you a headache and even make you ""high"".  According to many music therapists, it can also help recall memories.  ""The Music Never Stopped"" explores this phenomenon beautifully and is a testament to our souls connection with our music.  Set in the 80's with flashbacks to the 60's and 70's ""The Music Never Stopped"" has some of the best music from the bands of that era.  The film runs the gamete of emotions and has some powerful performances from the actors and classic bands such as The Grateful Dead, Bob Dylan, and The Beatles.

Gabriel, a 30 something man with a brain tumor is unable to form new memories.  He can remember his life growing up, playing music and following his favorite bands around the country, but he can't remember what his nurse just said to him 5 minutes ago.  Lou Tayler Pucci plays the down to earth ""hippie"" Gabriel graciously and I was very impressed with his performance.  He was subtle but beautifully represented those of us obsessed with music and it's meanings.  I felt a real connection with Gabriel and his relationship with his father Henry, played impeccably by J.K. Simmons.  They have such an interesting and ever-changing dynamic, it was a pleasure to watch it all unfold.  Henry is devastated by the diagnosis Gabriel has received and feels helpless.  That is until he see's Gabriel's eyes light up at the sound of a familiar piece of music.  He realizes that through music he can connect once again with his son and hopefully repair their broken relationship.

Based on the case study ""The Last Hippie"" by Dr. Oliver Sacks, ""The Music Never Stopped"" is a wonderful story and I highly recommend it.  It pulls on the heart strings of young and old alike bringing them together with the power of great music. With a PG rating, ""The Music Never Stopped"" doesn't feel like an after school special on father and son relationships.  It's obvious that the lesson goes much deeper than that.  The film is about connecting to each other through music and taking the time to understand each other through that medium.  The father/son dynamic is the ideal setting to get this point across and there are some very dramatic scenes that may bring a tear to your eye.  It sure did for me.",1311897600,25,2929,4.669921875
4445664,5,B004QL7JTE,"I am normally not a movie buff and find it very difficult to sit through any film, at home or at the theatre.  I happened on this movie on cable today after waiting for it to come to a local cinema.  I must say it was probably one of the best movies I have seen in my lifetime and was so sorry when it ended.  The music was wonderful, family interaction was true and well done.  You will laugh at triumphs, cry at times and just enjoy the music. I think I will have to watch it again tomorrow.",1311811200,13,493,3.9494949494949494
4445665,5,B004QL7JTE,"Oliver Sacks, M.D. is a physician and professor of neurology and psychiatry at the Columbia University Medical Center. In 2007, he was named the first Columbia University Artist, in recognition of his contributions to the arts. THE MUSIC NEVER STOPPED is an adaptation (by Gwyn Lurie and Gary Marks) of  ""The Last Hippie"", a short story/essay from  Sacks' ""The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat"", a collection of case history stories. Dr. Sacks is a neurologist who has  spent his career diagnosing, evaluating, and treating a variety of neurological disorders (and the oftentimes the profound personality shifts that resulted in brain injury or trauma). This information provides a bit of reality ground to the film and makes it all the more important to see and respect.  As directed by Jim Kohlberg, this film is a quiet, reverent, at times  disturbing exploration of the many aspects of brain function and malfunction and an example of adaptation to these challenges.

Gabriel Sawyer (Lou Taylor Pucci) was a bright youngster in the 1070s when the Vietnam war was altering the nation's perception of right and wrong as expressed in the music of Bob Dylan, the Grateful Dead, Cream, the Beatles, etc.  Longing to be a professional musician he foregoes his parent's wishes that he attend college and with regret leaves his girlfriend Tamara (Tammy Blanchard) and takes off for New York's Greenwich Village. Fast forward to 1986 and Gabriel is hospitalized for an enormous brain tumor, surgically removed, but leaving Gabriel without the ability to remember.  At this point Gabriel's parents are located and his father Henry (J.K. Simmons) and mother Helen (Cara Seymour) visit him in the hospital, longing to reconnect with the son that has been absent for fifteen years.  The lack of memory emphasizes the schism between Henry and Gabriel and Henry's depressed state results in his being  placed on sick leave from his successful job to deal with the trauma of his family.  Music having been so important to Gabriel as  young man introduces the music therapist Dianne Daley (Julia Ormond) who meticulously follows the cues form Gabriel's attention span and is able to open the doorway to his memory loss through his love of the music of his time.  Henry latches on to this and decides the only way he will be able to rebuild the broken fence of his relationship to Gabriel will be through music and together the two find connection despite the neurological blockades.

The cast is exemplary: J.K. Simmons is splendid as the father, Cara Seymour makes the mother wholly credible, Julia Ormond gives a selfless, fine performance, and Lou Taylor Pucci brings life to the long injured Gabriel.  The music is by the recordings of the period with special music supplied by Paul Cantelon.  Stephen Kazmierski's camera work allows almost unbearably touching close-ups of each of the actors that open the story for us.  This is a film based on a true case history, but this is also a story that is immensely touching and uplifting simply from the way it has been written, directed and acted.

4445666,5,B004QL7JTE,"I saw this film at Sundance and right away it became my favorite for the year. This film has a great and touching story, but so many do. What sets this film apart from so many others, is that it isn't trying too hard. The idea behind this film is simple and it is simply made -- no ultra crazy cinematography, no avant-garde editing. The script is also simple in the fact that it doesnt try to add ficticious elements to real life problems to try and make them ultra dramatic. This film really gets down to the clean basics of film making -- just substance, no fluff.
Aside from production, I really enjoyed this film becasue I am a huge fan of 60's and 70's rock and roll. All of the visible themes of this film are interweaved with being able to indentify with music. Anyone who has ever been moved by a particular song, album, or band will ""get"" this film. Anyone who grew up while the Beatles, Bob Dylan, Grateful Dead, and Hendrix were all releasing music and during the Vietnam War will be able to relate to the emotion of this story. This Film does not take place in the 60's, but relives it.
Without giving away to much of the plot, I will simply say that this film is about the relationship between a father and a son -- both love music and are moved by the music of their day, but don't have much else in common.
This is a must see, at least once.",1306886400,56,1357,4.203065134099617

4445691,4,B004QL7JTE,"This is about a father and husband reconnecting with his son and wife.  Music helps him reconnect with both.

The movie is told in flashbacks, between the late 1960s and the present, circa 1986. It's well-acted  by JK Simmons, who plays Henry Sawyer the cranky, impatient, demanding dad and husband.  Lou Taylor Pucci plays Gabriel, the music-loving Deadhead, whose love for music he got from his father, who forces him to listen to 1950s music like Bing Cosby.  Henry is insistent that Gabriel become the man that he demands him to be, rather than let Gabriel be the musician he wants to be in the Village.  It's the late  1960s and Vietnam is raging.  Gabriel's classmates are getting drafted to fight an unpopular war. Mother Helen, played by Cara Seymour, is the beaten-down wife who seems to have lived her entire life pleasing Henry and Gabriel, without any concerns about her own wants and needs as a wife and woman.

While music and bringing people together is the central theme of this movie, it's also a wonderful character study of the father, who has to learn to let go of his demands on others and let them be the people he denied them to be.  He makes strides via the music therapist Diane Dailey, who shows Henry and Helen how the music of the 1960s and early 1970s is impregnated in Gabriel's mind.  Listening to the music brings Gabriel out of his shell as he opens up about lost memories he shares for the first time with the adults who once suppressed them in him.  The plot moves along slowly for 50 minutes until Helen and Henry have a tear-jerking argument and Henry has an epiphany.

The Greatful Dead music connects father and son, but only after several emotional scenes.  Other music of that era also are played, songs that were protest songs against the Vietnam war that destroyed so many families.

What confused me were some of the timelines.  Gabriel was born in 1951.  He dropped out of high school in 1969.  Greatful Dead wrote the song ""I will get by"" in 1987.  Jerry Garcia died in 1995.  But Gabriel ran away and was out of touch with his parents for ""almost 20 years.""  There seems to be a discrepancy here.

Regardless, this is a very touching generational story of a father and husband who learns to change his demands, a son who reconnects with his parents, of redemption and second chances.",1519430400,,2330,4.5907990314769975
