4481803,2,B004V4ARBS,"The acting, script, and production quality of this movie are mediocre at best.  I also didn't like the fact that the movie contains profanity, which I wasn't expecting in a movie that's supposed to be a family friendly movie.  Plus, the plot falls apart in a couple spots.  Just not a very good movie.",1344297600,4,301,4.537037037037037
4481804,4,B004V4ARBS,"This is a movie suitable for the entire family. Positive family values are presented as the standard although there is an unsolved mystery about the daughter, Mia played by Ali Faulkner. The story moves along at an acceptable pace and the acting ranges from adequate to good.

The overall ambience provides the feeling of Central Texas life and customs in an entertaining way. I've lived in Central Texas and a lot of the scenes and situations rang true to my experience there. The story takes some twists and turns and offers some surprises as well; all told it is a pleasant evening's entertainment.

Although there is one rather intense scene I generally recommend the movie for the entire family.",1340150400,3,700,4.873949579831932
4481805,1,B004V4ARBS,DeDee pfeiffer and C. Thomas Howell were big stars in the 80's but they must of needed the money to appear in this movie. The directing is terrible and the story is very weak. Ali Faulker is just cute and that's it. I'm being generous when I rate this movie with one star. You can make a better movie with your own smartphone.,1333152000,2,326,4.190476190476191
4481806,1,B004V4ARBS,"I kept waiting for this movie to come together and it never did.  I really don't know how this got produced.  It wasn't well acted, the script never came around, and it just had no really point.  The girl hardly grieved for her mom that she was close to.  I hardly know what to say.  Not a good flick!",1329004800,3,301,4.033898305084746
4481807,5,B004V4ARBS,"I don't think this was a movie meant to be a ""Christian Movie"", it was meant to be a righteous movie. Where people do the right thing. In a small Texas town there will be language that doesn't fit well with some, but there it is. Sunday doesn't play the whole week. The visiting newspaper owner went along with the naysayers and proved himself right, then took on the duty of playing a dad even though he wasn't. Or was he? Look at the movie a second time and you might wonder if the story was made up or memory lost. Mia and MIA, curious.",1324080000,4,539,4.142857142857143
4481808,3,B004V4ARBS,"Mia Williams grows up without a daddy. The other kids at school tease her, and she leans more heavily into the fantasy world of wanting to be just like the dad in the stories Mom tells her stories about her MIA journalist father.

Ten years later the story picks up with Mia, now a journalism major, at the local college while Mom still runs the popular Arrow Lake Bed and Breakfast. When Mom dies in a tragic car accident, Mia must face keeping the business running while trying to continue with her studies. A stranger, a big-time journalist entrepreneur buying up local newspapers, arrives in town about the time of the accident and chooses the Arrow Lake B&B as his headquarters. Lo and behold, this man, whose name is Daniel Williams, address: same city as MIA Daddy, drives up in a car damaged by a deer hit and run, or so he says.

It's not a far jump to Mia's late mother's quick jump to conclusions that this Daniel Williams is the man who left Mia's mother high and dry and pregnant and starts spreading the gossip around the Texas community. With the whole town against him, Williams gives in to pressure and takes a paternity test, all the while claiming he knows nothing about Mia or her mother. In a sweet last twenty minutes or so, Mia is threatened by the big sleaze on campus, things get righted--even things that weren't wrong--and all gets better with the world.

I spent the first half of the movie wondering where we were until I finally read ""Texas"" on an envelope address and realized the constant mumbled telephone greeting was ""Arrow Lake Bed and Breakfast."" I wanted to like this movie a lot, and while I could look beyond the C-level filming and editing, and the B- to C-level characters, I had a hard time with skin-tight costuming and the C and D-level dialogue. It was hardly a conventional mystery unless you counted the mysterious lack of clients at the B&B, which was gorgeous, by the way. Recommendation: Skip to the last half hour.",1323648000,3,1966,4.579545454545454
4481809,3,B004V4ARBS,"I too would agree that this did not at all seem like a christian film. It swore, used the Lord's name in vain, and  even included a sexual crime in it. Not a christian film. I had let my kids watch thinking it would be appropriate. big mistake. Also the ending left me hanging and not at all satisfied with the ""explanation""",1318896000,17,324,4.225806451612903
4481810,3,B004V4ARBS,"The plot could have been worked better.  The acting could have been beefed  up.  Somehow, I was under the impression this was a Christian movie or at least one with a Christian world view.  Now, unless I missed it, the only time ""God"" was mentioned, was if someone was exclaiming.

The little girl who always wanted to be a writer.... Gosh! AND who should just come along right at the right time in her life.  AND who would he be but maybe her long-lost-father...the publisher??!!! WOW! How do writers come up with plots like this? Oh! I know.... the are just in or out of high school and decide they always wanted to be writers......

The male lead here was the best actor... but he hasn't aged well...(have any of us?)... He means well, but darn!, I just couldn't stick my neck out for the little girl as he does in this flick.

Movie is ok... made ok... but my wife and I were not impressed.",1315094400,9,894,4.343373493975903
4481811,5,B004V4ARBS,Great movie I enjoyed it.,1416182400,,25,4.2
4481812,1,B004V4ARBS,"By far, this is the worst movie that I've ever seen. The acting was horrid and the plot so confusing that I never did figure it out by the end. It is worth seeing only to say that one has seen the worst movie ever made.",1402099200,,219,3.782608695652174
4481813,3,B004V4ARBS,"Secret at Arrow Lake is a heartwarming family drama about a mother's love for her child. After a misfortunate accident, the story takes a twist that brings the father's love back into her daughter's life. Mia Williams, (Ali Faulkner) was raised as an only child by her mom, Sara (DeDee Pfeiffer), in the family Bed & Breakfast .

Mia grew up believing her father was lost, M.I.A., in the Gulf War. When a tragic accident results in the sudden death of her mom, Mia finds herself alone to care for the family business. Daniel Williams(C. Thomas Howell) a hard-edged businessman from New York, arrives at the B&B and Mia suspects he may be her lost father.

The townsfolk believe he may be responsible for Sara's death. As events unfold, Daniel clears his name and finds acceptance from the community and Mia finds a father at last.",1393200000,,830,4.678082191780822
4481814,5,B004V4ARBS,A great movie for a great price!  My daughter loved this movie and we watch it as a family often!,1383004800,4,97,3.85
4481815,3,B004V4ARBS,"This movie started out with good potential and it held my interest the entire time.  THe beginning was really good for plot development.  However the ending left me pretty confused.  I wonder who Mia's real dad was?  And it made me wonder why the mom went through all that trouble of changing her name legally if she wasn't really married to a guy named Daniel Williams?  Was she married or not to Daniel Williams?  Maybe he was just a guy she fixated on when she found out she was pregant.  So who was Mia's real dad?  And if Daniel's not really her dad, why would he be staying at the B&B when it's obvious he's used to much better accomadations.  Lots of questions....movie ended abruptly without thoroughly answering everything.  Leaves you guessing.",1375315200,2,754,4.643939393939394
4481816,3,B004V4ARBS,The movie is a great movie.  Problem was that the subtitle trailed after the scene.  Confusing when you are reading while listening to a dialogue that did not match.,1360540800,,165,4.655172413793103
4481817,4,B004V4ARBS,"Did anyone else notice the blatant typo on the DNA report's letterhead --- ""Labortories""  ???  Was this just a play on words or an oversight?",1360540800,,141,4.6
4481818,4,B004V4ARBS,"I have to be careful here not to play the spoiler role, so I won't say much about the plot, but I found it interesting. The critics here who point out the poor acting need to read Teddy Roosevelt's quote on criticism. There are films with bad acting where it is obvious that the people are acting and not playing a role naturally - but this one showed no signs of that. One of my favorite actresses GiGi Erneta only had a small role in this. Ali Faulkner is a rising star. The adult leads were good. I'm glad I didn't take the advice of reviewers who recommended I not waste my time on it. It is not really Christian in nature so if you're looking only for movies that have a message of eternal life, this one won't fit the bill.",1360195200,5,729,4.140845070422535
4481819,2,B004V4ARBS,The movie was okay for a cold winter afternoon when you cannot get out and do anything outside. The whole movie is dedicated to whether Daniel is or is not her father. We get some information from a paternity test. Then he says something in a bar. And finally Daniel says something else toward the end. I think I understand what he said but I would not bet on it. Could have been made clearer.,1356739200,,393,4.253333333333333

8442878,5,B004V4ARBS,"Outstanding film, gotta see to believe what happens. In a world so consumed with me, me, me, and to heck with anyone else. This movie demonstrates the true meaning of love, the kind of love that passes all understanding, the kind of love that comes from GOD our father in heaven, that comes forth in an man to his daughter or is ?????",1435536000,,334,4.317460317460317
8442879,2,B004V4ARBS,"I would give this tops 3 stars if not but for the horrible casting and acting which downgrade it to a 2 star for me.  The plot was ok but the twists and turns it promised were way too obvious to me.  The lead actress was pretty good but the rest felt as it was their first time out or maybe it was just lacking good direction.  Even C Howell was walking thru it.  I usually enjoy his acting except that he is so painfully thin its difficult to watch  in this type of role. As for the language and subject matter, it was mild compared to the content of most prime time tv shows.",1430265600,,577,3.982608695652174
8442880,3,B004V4ARBS,"I think I figured out the problems with the plot. So many people have spoken about how confused they were at the end. I was as well.  But after reading others reviews I began to put things together and here is what I came up with.  The DNA test came back negative.  It shows the letter twice in the movie so Daniel Williams could not be her father.  Daniel also knew about the article from the newspaper that Mia had from her mom but he had not know her mom.  Here is my guess:  The DA said something to Mia about her rapist father being her rapist and that he probably impregnated a lot of women in the county.  I think that Mia mother, Sarah, was raped by Chuck's father and was too embarrassed to tell her daughter so she found an article about an MIA from Afghanistan and thought that no one would ever find him.  She then went to New York to have her name changed and fabricated the whole story about Daniel being Mia's father.  All went well until she passed away and Daniel show up.  That's when the problems started.  I don't why they could not have told us more and I don't even know if this is what the writer was actually thinking.  However, after movie like this leaves you guessing, I just wanted to come up with the missing pieces and this is my guess.",1429920000,2,1266,4.20746887966805
