3666874,4,B001KO1BCQ,"I enjoyed the set because I like Sam Elliot. ""You Know My Name"" and ""Rough Riders"" were a 4 rating and ""Desperate Trail"" was a 3 rating.  We were surprised at the ""R"" rating of ""Desperate Trail"" as we usually don't purchase R movies.",1249776000,10,233,4.295454545454546
3666875,5,B001KO1BCQ,Sam Elliott is one of my favorite actors.  I could listen to his voice reading the New York City phone book and be enthralled.  This boxed set contains three terrific movies featuring Elliott.  The Rough Riders is a two disc mini-series that I especially liked.  This set is well worth the money.,1249603200,49,296,4.634615384615385
3666876,5,B001KO1BCQ,"Movies are well made.  The acting is professional.  Stories are intereseting to watch.  Definitely would recommend this series for anyone who loves westerns.  Sam Elliott is a class ""A"" actor in my book.",1242432000,2,203,5.0606060606060606

3666880,5,B001KO1BCQ,"As a huge Sam Elliott fan, I have been waiting for a compilation of his work. This mini effort of Westerns is surely a great start.
With his rugged good looks ( No one wears a mustache like Sam), his swagger ( without being arrogant)and ""that"" voice....no matter what role he portrays, he's going to shine. I liked him very much in the original ""Quick & the Dead"", and as General Sam Houston. My personal favourite role, of course not a western, as Gar, in MASK with Cher. They had great chemistry on screen; so, of course, does his wife Katharine Ross ( but being female, I'd rather not see him with his wife).
I'd buy the compilation, if I didn't already have them singular.",1236470400,38,676,4.416
3666881,4,B001KO1BCQ,"WARNER's SAM ELLIOTT WESTERN COLLECTION features Elliott in three of his best films.

SYNOPSES--

DESPERATE TRAIL--  After years of physical abuse, the daughter-in-law (Fiorentino) of Marshal Bill Speakes (Elliott) kills her husband. She's sentenced to hang but manages to escape with the aid of Jack Cooper (Sheffer). Marshal Speakes will do almost anything to bring her to justice and avenge his son's death.

ROUGH RIDERS--  Made-for-TV biopic about Teddy Roosevelt (Berenger) and the volunteer cavalrymen who in the Spanish-American War of 1898 charged up the heavily-defended San Juan Hill alongside him. Top-notch cast includes co-star Elliott as Capt. Bucky O'Neil.

YOU KNOW MY NAME--  TV movie about real life cowboy and pioneering film director Bill Tilghman (Elliott). An ex-buffalo hunter and deputy of Wyatt Earp, Tilghman is intent on producing realistic westerns, but faces opposition when he favors unknowns for his pictures rather than established stars like Tom Mix. Tilghman also has to deal with a former lawman rival named Wiley (Howard), who makes constant trouble for him.

John Buford. On July 1st, 1863, the heroic efforts of Buford's two brigades of dismounted cavalrymen slowed Gen. Rob't E. Lee's advance on the town of Gettysburg, and made possible the victory that came two days later.

3667004,5,B001KO1BCQ,"These were some of Sam's best movies.  Rough Riders was worth the price alone.  It was a TV movie and sleeper, but portrays the charge up San Juan Hill with a lot of action and ""I believe accuracy"".  Props and costumes excellent.  Gary Busey and Tom Berenger both had General Joe Wheeler and Teddy Roosevelt dead on....would recommend these movies to everyone....",1387670400,3,363,4.806451612903226
3667015,5,B001KO1BCQ,"Despite Hollywood's insistence on screwing up a good story, this, I believe, captures the essence of the Rough Riders and their battles in Cuba.  It shows a group of flawed men who rose above themselves to achieve a moment of greatness.  Historical accuracy suffers as little as Hollywood will allow.  Berringer deserved an award for his rendition of Roosevelt, which is not similar at all to what he usually portrays.  The supporting cast does an outstanding job.  I could watch this every night.
You Know My Name and Desperate Trail are solid westerns, but not at all noteworthy.  Buy this for Rough Riders.",1386979200,,609,4.864077669902913

3667022,5,B001KO1BCQ,Sam Elliott is a great actor - you will like this DVD if you like Western movies.  This was a good deal.,1376265600,,104,3.727272727272727

3667024,5,B001KO1BCQ,"I just think Sam Elliott is great- whether playing the villain -as on ""the desperate trail""or the good guy in ""You know my name"" and there were varying shades in his portrayal of Bucky O'Neill the matter of fact,pulling no punches, doggedness as the no nonsense sheriff to the sinister and ruthless and tough as nails Rough Riders captain. Gary Busey is just plain unpredictable and far out EXCELLENT as General Joe Wheeler in"" Rough Riders"". The shoot outs on these movies are exceptional as on ""Trail"" the opening scene with the bungled stage hold-up featuring finely cast blood thirsty killer/robbers, must be one of the best western action scenes for realism, and Mate there is more to come!! The clothing of all the VERY FINE actors is in faithful keeping with the traditional clothing of the Old West and the same consideration for accuracy of dingy portrayal of the old saloons,hotels,people scratching out an existence,the jail,even the dim lighting the whole  atmosphere is very well done. No-Excellent -Yeah!!!",1375660800,3,1020,5.035502958579881
3667035,3,B001KO1BCQ,"This is an odd collection of movies. Rough riders (a two part mini series) is a great movie how ever I wouldn't expect to see it in a Sam Elliot collection as his screen time is minimal compared to the ""star"" who is Tom Berenger. ""You know my name"" is, in my opinion the weakest of the three with ""The desperate trail"" being the outstanding feature.  You can't help feeling that once you've seen Elliot in a western role you've seen them all. His characterization tend to be very similar whether you're watching Roadhouse or Tombstone, that said I'm still a fan of his work.
This is a very good set and still better than most. ""Desperate trail"" is worth the purchase alone so value for money is not an issue.
I've given it three stars because Elliot, in my mind is only loosley the feature. It have more accurately  been titled Western collection with Sam elliot (a subtle but nonetheless better discription). If you want a comparison the Tom Selleck collection is a better set. Selleck plays three distinct and seperate roles in three diverse story lines.
purchase by all means just be prepared not see as much of Mr Elliot as you would expect.",1367625600,8,1145,4.553398058252427

Actors such as: Sam Elliott, Tom Selleck, John Wayne, Burt Lancaster, (and others) seemed born to play Western character roles.  This Collection will not let you down.  In the Rough Riders, actor Tom Barrenger playing Teddy Roosevelt. Sam is the Seasoned D.I. type for all Basic Training, and battles, in the Spanish American War of 1898.

The other two films portray Sam as the relatively soft speaking - don't ask twice type good guy - but do not cross him too much or else, character.  Kind of similar to his roles in ""The Sacketts"", and ""Conagher"", both of those films are now Classic Westerns.

1) The Desperate Trail - I like my lawmen to be honest and upright and law abiding so was a little disappointed to find this not the case here, likewise the ending was a little too contrived. In spite of these criticisms I enjoyed this film.
2) Rough Riders - A lesson in US history. Teddy Roosevelt and the US adventures in Cuba. I don't know how true to life this story really is but I was suitably impressed. I felt I learned something and enjoyed the learning experience.
3) You Know My Name - Ex western lawman Bill Tilghman's last appointment. This another piece of US history, the prohibition years. Tilghman was not as well known as some of his contemporaries but Sam Elliott certainly gives him a presence in this film. Much recommended.",1256774400,4,813,4.613793103448276
