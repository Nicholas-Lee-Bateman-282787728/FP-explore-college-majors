This anime is pretty boring. I realized about 7 episodes into the series that all these battles that took place for no reason. There is no clear enemy. It's like a child playing with with toy soldiers. There is no point to anything that happens in this series. The good guys and bad guys have no goals or allegiances. It seems like they have a simple code: ""Wow! Another mecha, lets blow it up!"" They simply fight for the hell of it. The animation is average, the voice acting is pretty good, and the soundtrack is okay. Nothing important happens in this series. It just kinda exists. I can't recommend it. It's a serious bore.",1357257600,,869,4.465408805031447
