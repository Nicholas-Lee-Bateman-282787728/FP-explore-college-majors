2472366,1,B000CS45JC,"I ordered this because I wanted Leslie's Muscle Mile One workout.  The Muscle Mile One workout is a previously released workout, which I believed was being re-packaged.  However, my order arrived (I ordered both the Muscle Mile One and the 30 Minute Walk) and to my dismay, this is the wrong workout.  The case and disk indicate that it should be the Muscle Mile One, but the program is actually the Walk Diet - 1 Mile Workout.  I checked the 30 Minute Walk and it is the correct workout program, so I'm hoping that this production error will be corrected ASAP.

(Additional Comments - I contacted Amazon regarding this issue and they quickly sent a replacement disk.  I received the replacement today and the program contained on the disk is still incorrect.  I can assume that this was a mass production error and all disks produced for release contain the wrong workout.  I contacted Leslie Sansone's website to inform them of the error and received a quick thank you but no information on correcting the problem.  I would urge everyone interested in the Muscle Mile One to NOT BUY THIS WORKOUT until the production error is corrected.  If you want the Muscle Mile One workout now, go to Leslie's website and buy the originally released and correct workout there!!)",1142380800,52,1268,4.748858447488584
2472367,5,B000CS45JC,"I have a couple of Leslie's compilation DVDs, and this workout is found on her Intensity Walk DVD along with Walk and Jog and 4 Mile Super Challenge.  I really enjoy this 1 mile routine, I mostly use it as a warmup to my weight workouts.

Leslie is joined by Mary Kay and Sandy, they use the weighted balls for part of the workout.  Sandy does the workout without the balls, so I just follow her.  You see all the basic steps (walking in place, side steps, knee lifts and kicks), along with assorted simple arm movements.

I like the smaller cast here, gives it a more calm feel.  It really is a nice little routine and before you know it, it's over and you have walked a mile.

I recommend this if you can find it on a compilation DVD, perfect for those who want a short walk.  5 stars.",1259193600,7,787,4.1655629139072845
2472368,3,B000CS45JC,"After a few weeks I had to add weights to the routine to keep a sweat and after a month I bought a new workout from her that I love, I'll have to agree with the other reviews I do think it is the wrong workout for the description, however it was a great wrokout for me, it was low impact, took no eye hand cordination which I do not have and got me back in shape to do more intense workouts after the birth of my daughter.  I would recomend it to someone with limited motion, pre or post pregnancy and elderly, for those of us that fit those categories GREAT workout.",1255910400,,567,4.017699115044247
2472369,1,B000CS45JC,"I ordered Walk Away Pounds Muscle Mile One and received The Walk Diet. The packaging is correct and shows that it is Muscle Mile One, but when I play it there is the Walk Diet and the reason I know this is because I have that VHS tape.",1248739200,3,235,3.9166666666666665
2472370,4,B000CS45JC,"All the reviews are right about this dvd. This is the diet walk in a new case so don't bother to buy this one if you own the other. If this is your first Leslie Sansone DVD and your new to the program, this would be a good start. It's very easy and starts with her basic moves. It only contains a one mile walk.",1233619200,,311,3.8
2472371,1,B000CS45JC,"I did not receive the DVD I ordered!!! I ordered Leslie Sansone's Muscle Mile, but I received her Evening Walk. I did not want this DVD. I returned it, but haven't heard back. So I guess I'm just out of luck. Buyers beware!!! If I ever do get the DVD I ordered or my money back, I'll post a response.",1227484800,,300,4.016666666666667
2472372,1,B000CS45JC,"I saw this video and thought it would be a great video for mornings when I'm pressed for time. One mile with weights - terrific. I feel robbed. No weights are used, the music has such a strange beat that it's hard to get into. This is a beginners workout. I have Leslie Sansone's 1-mile challenge and it is really a great 1-mile workout that gets results. I was looking for diversity, but this video is not what the wrapper promises it will be. The only good thing is that Leslie Sansone is finally creating videos with chapters so that you can move quickly to another part of the DVD. However, for a 1-mile workout it's almost useless.",1146096000,14,636,4.398305084745763
2472373,1,B000CS45JC,"This was SO misleading.  The back of the DVD suggests this workout uses weights.  It does not.  Furthermore, it isn't a new workout at all.  Remember that awful ""Walk Diet"" DVD by Leslie?  Well this is the same one without the added two mile walk.  I think it has a new title because after reading the ""Walk Diet"" reviews, no one would ever buy it.  So of course, they had to change the name and give it a new cover.  This is just outrageous deception.  No wonder everyone thinks they received the wrong disc.  They didn't, they were just victims of fraud.",1145404800,22,556,4.362745098039215
2472374,1,B000CS45JC,"Like the other reviewers stated, I ordered the 30 Minute Walk Workout and the Muscle Mile One together, and also received the Walk Diet. I am very disappointed, and would hope that the error is fixed and hope to get the correct DVD at no extra charge!",1143244800,18,251,4.361702127659575
2472375,1,B000CS45JC,I am a big fan of Leslie Sansone. I was excited to find out she had a new release. I wanted a short tape to do before work. When I received this tape I felt liked I had been ripped off. It was boring and worthless. This tape would only interest someone who has never exercise before. This was a total waste of my money.,1142985600,23,319,3.923076923076923
2472376,1,B000CS45JC,i ordered this video along with the 30 minute walk also thinking it was something brand new.  to my surprise when i put it in i realized it is the same workout as the walk diet one mile which does NOT use weights where this one suggests it does.  i also hope that the mistake will be corrected before other people get just as disappointed.  do not buy it until error is fixed,1142640000,21,375,4.109589041095891

8101543,5,B000CS45JC,"One of my favorite walking workouts . The ladies are calmer on this one and I really enjoy the pace of this DVD. Not too fast, not too slow. Perfect to get that one mile in, when you don't have a lot of time.",1411344000,,208,3.75
8101544,4,B000CS45JC,"This one is short and sweet.  It's not terribly taxing but when you don't have a lot of time and just want to move a bit, it's good.",1409702400,,132,3.7142857142857144
8101545,5,B000CS45JC,"I found this at Big Lots about a month ago.  It is perfect for me at my age of 64 and not being used to much exercise.  Since I have a hard time getting up and down, I like that I don't have to get down on the floor to cool down...it is done standing.  I really appreciate that there are just two other ladies exercising with her...I have seen some of her other tapes where there is a room full of folks with her.  Those are too distracting.  You can use weights if you choose, but of course it is an option.  And the music is not loud and blaring...so you can understand her instructions. It is just a nice simple walk  and I am grateful for it.  I have noticed in several reviews that some people who ordered from Amazon did not find the correct dvd in their package. As great as Amazon's service is, I am sure they will stand behind it if it is not accurate.",1405036800,,861,4.023529411764706

8101548,4,B000CS45JC,an excellent video. really gets you moving. you can exercise in your time frame in the privacy of your home.,1326240000,,108,4.45
8101549,5,B000CS45JC,"I really like this workout. It's quick, not too easy, & not too hard. You'll work up a sweat without being unable to move the next day. You know what I mean! The steps are simple but super effective for a great workout! As you get fit, you can make the workout a little harder by using hand weights, or using more arm movements. But just as it is, it's a great workout for the entire body. I'm going to recommend this DVD to everyone I know. We all need to exercise and eat healthy. It's cheaper to be healthy than to be ill. Think about it!",1310515200,,541,4.065420560747664
