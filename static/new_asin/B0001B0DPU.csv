Is another of my rick's favorites, takes me back to my college years, the tape only contains 6 videos but worth the money since Rick couldn't perform any better. Buy it.",1345766400,,544,4.396039603960396
8009588,5,B0001B0DPU,"I picked up a copy of this over the weekend at a library sale and boy did it put me in a time warp!  Can it really be 25 years since Rick Springfield hit the top of the charts with JESSIE'S GIRL in 1981?? This is a collection of 1981-1983 videos when the music video format was brand new.  Watching these videos again for the first time in decades, one sees they had rather limited budgets, sets, and special effects compared with later music videos but back then Rick was among the five or so artists at the forefront of rock videos.  Seeing them strung together we see there is a bit of repetition in plot and a lot of ""rock star"" breaking things (windows, mirrors, etc.) but Rick is always appealing, seemingly modest and down to earth and certainly one of the best-looking rockers of all time.  The most ambitious video HUMAN TOUCH cast him as a sci-fi hero but again it's mainly limited to one set.  The videos here are JESSIE'S GIRL, DON'T TALK TO STRANGERS, WHAT KIND OF FOOL AM I, AFFAIR OF THE HEART, HUMAN TOUCH, and SOULS.  Curiously missing is one of his bigger hits I'VE DONE EVERYTHING FOR YOU from 1981 which I remember had a video and of course there were a number of videos made after this 1983 VHS release.  Rick has a number of DVDS out from movies, concerts, and documentaries - it would be great to see his music videos all together in one collection on DVD.",1143417600,4,1379,4.342412451361867
