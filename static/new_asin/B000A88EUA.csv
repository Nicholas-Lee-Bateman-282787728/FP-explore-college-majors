2379371,5,B000A88EUA,"Ok let me start off by saying that this is the Tom and Jerry of old. It feels like the Hanna-Barbera circa 1940 - 1958 Tom and Jerry. It's fun and funny the way Tom and Jerry should be. There is ""cartoon violence"" but it is used the right way, Think Three Stoges where slapstick is not the joke but used to tell it. It's classic Tom Jerry in modern times lapooning Hollywood and reality tv with wit. Too much nowadays family films are laden with heavy handed morales well I'm here to say it's ok for all ages to just watch a movie laugh, be entertained and enjoy. Here there is no great moral life lesson, no deep philosophy just pure entertainment. So if you love classic Tom and Jerry or for that matter if you love comedy thats not heavy handed or low brow you'll love Tom and Jerry - The Fast and the Furry !!!",1156896000,18,814,4.158227848101266

2379374,3,B000A88EUA,Not one of our T & J favorites.  Starts adding too many other characters.  We like the T & J tried and true formula of the two of them and their antics.  My grandsons think they are hilarious.,1442793600,,192,4.0

2379377,5,B000A88EUA,A classic cartoon that my grandson loves,1438732800,,40,4.857142857142857
2379378,1,B000A88EUA,"Okay first off, can I say that it's awesome that Joseph Barbera wrote the story and executive produced...but some how that can't save this cartoon...sigh

This starts off with the usual cat and mouse chase...no real reason behind it, but the mass destruction and mindless mayhem brought out some good laughs from me. After the extended chase sequence that resulted in the TOTAL annihilation of the human lady's home Tom and Jerry are living in, the duo gets kicked out. As Tom and Jerry leave the smoldering premises, they both catch a commercial for the The Fabulous Super Race show with a richly grand prize. Both cat and mouse race (ha ha) to the junkyard and piece together their race cars to be contestants. Once completed they make their way to the studio to enter the contest, via a few nods to Pee Wee's Big Adventure's studio end scenes.

Next up, we are introduced to the racers, a madcap group of wacky racers...you see what I did there. So anyway, this is pretty much an updated sort of wacky racers that just happen to have Tom and Jerry. The race starts in Hollywood with the race supposedly ending in Mexico. However, with Tom and Jerry's constantly trying to kill each other, the race's TV ratings are through the roof so the Powers That Be decide to extend the race into different stages around the world. So with each ""stage"" of the race we start losing racers which is good because with the 6 total racers at the start there really wasn't much screen time for our favorite duo. So finally half way through the movie, in the Antarctic stage we are down to just Tom and Jerry and the next stage is in Australia.

As Tom and Jerry race start up the next stage Australia another racer manages to catch up, and the next stage is run where the other racer manages to die (yes, you read that correctly) so now we are back with just Tom and Jerry. The producer/director of this race tells his assistant that the public is getting bored with the race and will soon tune out so the race must be sped up. So it is decided that once this leg of the race is complete that Tom and Jerry must make it to the finish line in 5 minutes. So into jets they go and fly across the globe destroying everything in their path. The duo manage to cross the finish line at the same time winning the million dollar prize.

Hurray! Tom and Jerry win, but it's short lived as the lady from the beginning of the movie barges in to mansion that Tom and Jerry live in now and demands that it's hers since Tom and Jerry destroyed her other one. So the chase is on again and more destruction as the credits roll.

The Good:
There a some pretty good laugh out loud moments, but they are few and far between. The most laughs, for me are in the first seven minutes and that's about it.

The Bad:
This is like a 7 minute cartoon stretched to 75 minutes. The cars are almost magic as it seems because they can be modified at any given moment depending on the stage. Now I know this is a cartoon, but it goes beyond ridiculous. The violence...let's talk about this for a moment. I know Tom and Jerry are violent, I get that, but everybody and everything is beating something or someone up. Tom is a homicidal maniac in this. I've never seen him this maniacally vicious and who leaves a path of destruction wherever he goes. Brutal, just brutal for a Tom and Jerry cartoon.

The Ugly:
The animation is horrendous, it's stiff and feels really cheap. The show drags on and on with each stage, and finally towards the end of the movie it is decided that the race needs to end in 5 minutes. The race should have ending after 15 minutes instead of in 75 minutes; it needed to be very short. Surprisingly, Tom and Jerry had very little screen time, there were a lot of time spent on the announcers of the race and the other racers. Often I'd be wondering where Tom and Jerry were as they were the only non-annoying characters in the whole show.

I hate this cartoon! Everything about this movie was horrible, the dialog, premise, animation, and character interactions. I hope to never see The Fast and the Furry again, which is sad since Joseph Barbera produced this and was given story credit.",1434067200,,4164,4.405721716514955

2379433,1,B000A88EUA,"There is about 1 minutes worth of actual classic Tom and Jerry cartoon humor in this movie.  The rest of it is mean spirited, pointless, and mostly unfunny action sequences.  In fact there's one scene where the two speed by a European castle and in the chaos, it turns into a series of mobile homes.  Please, tell me how that's funny?

Because it's not.

There's another scene where a reporter gets nearly choked to death, another where Tom's owner just wails on him with a broom, I mean, how are these things funny?  This movie is contrived and unnecessary.",1248220800,2,558,4.585858585858586
