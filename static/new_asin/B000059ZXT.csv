7934688,3,B000059ZXT,"Following the tremendous success of The Private Life of Henry VIII and The Rise of Catherine the Great, Alexander Korda decided to take on the Don Juan legend for his next film. This was not to be just another biopic but was rather to be a subtle look at aging and its effects on a legend.

Douglas Fairbanks plays the legendary lover trying to maintain his prowess in an aging body. He is separated from the wife(benita Hume) who loves him despite his exploits and is being followed by Rodrigo(Barry Mackay) who longs to be him. on a return trip to Seville after tweny years away his imposter is killed allowing him to attend his own funeral and to finally escape his legend for a short while. After a brief stay in France he finds that he is no longer as charming to the ladies as he once was for the simple reason that he has aged.

This is more of a comedy than Korda's other biographical films and the casting of the aging Fairbanks was a gem. There is still some of the swashbuckler left in him but his glory days are long past. Fairbanks plays this to the hilt. This film was to be Fairbanks' swan song. He died shortly thereafter a result of his own legend and the advent of the talking film. He never quite reached the status that he had once has as a silent star. For Korda this film was a dismal failure byt is quite watchable in retrospect.

The Eclipse version has not been greatly restored but the transfer is quite good. There are a few instances of inconsistant sound but all in all not a bad low priced presentation.",1383523200,,1533,4.334494773519164
7934689,4,B000059ZXT,"""The Private Life of Don Juan"" is a 1934 comedy from Alexander Korda and is notable as the swan song of screen legend Douglas Fairbanks. The Don Juan character comes from a 14th Century Spanish play, several books and plays (including works by Byron and Moliere) and the Mozart opera Don Giovanni (1787). The first film was in 1926 starring John Barrymore. Don Juan would be played later by Errol Flynn (1949) and Johnny Depp (1995).

Douglas Fairbanks (1883-1939) was one of the biggest stars in the early years of Hollywood, referred to as ""The King"" of Hollywood. Along with Chaplin, DW Griffith, and Fairbank's wife, Mary Pickford, he founded United Artists (1919). He founded the Motion Picture Academy (1927) and was its first President, was the first to put his hands and feet in the cement at Grauman's Chinese Theatre, and hosted the first Oscar ceremony in 1929.

Fairbanks virtually invented the swashbuckler film and appeared in such classics as ""The Three Musketeers"" (1921), ""Robin Hood"" (1922), and ""The Thief of Bagdad"" (1924). He wasn't really known for his lothario roles, which were more the focus for his contemporaries Valentino and Barrymore.

Fairbanks was in England along with his son, looking for work, when he came upon Korda and hence this film.

Korda loved film biographies. Among his most famous are Oscar winning ""The Private Life of Henry VIII"" (1933), ""The Private Life of Helen of Troy"" (1927), ""Rembrandt"" (1936), ""That Hamilton Woman"" (1941), and ""Bonnie Prince Charlie"" (1948).

Merle Oberon (1911-79) plays one of Fairbank's love interests. She started in films in 1928 but it was her role as Anne Boleyn opposite Charles Laughton in ""The Private Life of Henry VIII"" (1933) that brought her to stardom. She was nominated for an Oscar for ""The Dark Angel"" (1935) but is probably best remembered for her role as Cathy in ""Wuthering Heights"" (1938).

FWIW - Oberon appeared in several Korda films and eventually they married in 1939 and then divorced in 1945 when she married cinematographer Lucien Ballard.

Binnie Barnes (1903-98) plays a maid. Barnes was a major star of the 30s, appearing in ""Private Life of Henry VIII"" (1933),  ""Diamond Jim"" (1935), ""Last of the Mohicans"" (1936) and ""3 Musketeers"" (1939). Her philosophy was - ""I'm no Sarah Bernhardt. One picture is just like another to me as long as I don't have to be a sweet woman.""

French born Georges Perinal (1897-1965) is the photographer. He worked often with Korda (Henry VIII, Rembrandt, Catherine the Great) and won an Oscar for ""The Thief of Bagdad"" (1940) and was nominated for ""Four Feathers"" (1939).

The NY Times called the film ""a visually attractive costume comedy"" but disliked Fairbanks' performance noting - ""the microphone is ruthlessly unkind to him. Neither in voice nor theatrical skill is he gifted to read lines.""

1934 was an OK year for films. The top box office slots went to ""Viva Villa"", ""Cleopatra"" and ""The Barretts of Wimpole Street"" and ""It Happened One Night"" was the big Oscar winner. That year ""The Thin Man"" series began, Karloff and Lugosi appeared in ""The Black Cat"", Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers danced in ""The Gay Divorcee"", Laurel and Hardy laughed it up in ""Babes in Toyland"", and Howard Hawks' ""Twentieth Century"" came out.

Unlike most of Korda's films, this biography is more fiction than fact, but the character was so well known it does take on an historical tone. The aging Fairbanks is marvelous as the aging lothario, and one can't help but make comparisons with John Wayne's ""The Shootist"" (1976), Edward G Robinson's ""Soylent Green""(1973), Errol Flynn's ""Too Much too Soon"" (1958) or John Barrymore's ""The Great Man Votes"" (1939). Fairbanks is particularly good when philosophizing about the vagaries of fame.

This isn't the best film, but it is an opportunity to see the famous Douglas Fairbanks in a talkie and in a role that requires acting rather than swashbuckling alone. Although his contemporaries were disappointed, the passage of time has let us evaluate him more appropriately.

Bottom line - worth viewing.",1331683200,,4071,4.994091580502215
7934690,2,B000059ZXT,"Though appropriately cast in the title role, ""The Private Life of Don Juan""  (1934) proved a less-than-spectacular swansong for Douglas Fairbanks. Director Alexander Korda's attempt to duplicate the success of ""The Private Life of Henry VIII"" was a doomed enterprise. To make matters worse, the aging Fairbanks had little enthusiasm for his sound films, with the exception of the light-hearted ""Mr. Robinson Crusoe"" (1932). Despite Korda's fine production values, one wishes that Fairbanks had not made this flat and depressing ""romantic satire.""",1205625600,14,546,5.658536585365853
7934691,3,B000059ZXT,"Even by the often unstable conditions of the movie industry, Sir Alexander Korda (1893-1956)had quite a varied career. He started out in 1916 as pioneer director in his native Hungary, then emigrated to Austria in 1919, where he made the epic Samson and Dalila (1922), before ending up in Hollywood like so many talented figures from Central Europe. Although he was quite successful here--one of his hits was The Private Life of Helen of Troy (1927)--he was, I believe, ruined in the Market Crash of 1929 and returned to Europe. After a brief sojourn in France, he went to England and founded London Films in 1932.
Korda's London Films productions were the absolute antithesis of run-of-the-mill British movies at that time: cosmopolitan rather than provincial; literate rather than stagy; and often distinguished by an unusual visual flair. Nevertheless, precisely the things that made Korda's movies attractive to educated moviegoers in the 1930s are exactly the things that are likely to make them a deadly bore to present day viewers. The Private Life of Don Juan well illustrates the strengths and weaknesses of Korda's work as producer, especially in the casting. As one of the ladies of Seville, Merle Oberon looks photogenic enough and performs well, but as the aging Don Juan, the aging Douglas Fairbanks doesn't cut a happy figure, and his rather prosaic American enunciation clashes with the sculpted tones of British thespians. Moreover, the movie's coy attempts at risque humor, in contrast to the gutsy ribaldry of contemporary American pictures, come across today as the kind of stuff primarily intended to titillate someone's maiden aunt.
But Korda as a director is a rather different story--he may be the unique example in movie history of a producer whose best director was himself. Sadly, many of Korda's silent films have vanished, but the extant evidence from the 1930s suggests that Sir Alexander was on occasion capable of rivalling such masters of staging and composition of the 1920s as Lubitsch and Lang. Although The Private Life of Don Juan is not as effectively filmed as The Private Life of Henry VIII nor Rembrandt--his real masterpiece--it is still a stylish piece which exploits the scenic possibilities of 18th century Spanish architecture such as imposing facades, latticework, jalousies, wrought iron gates, and various structural decorations for all they are worth. One particularly impressive example of Korda's eye for composition is the scene of Don Juan's supposed funeral, with masses of black-garbed mourners juxtaposed against the neutral tones of the set, a scene that quite transcends the rest of this etiolated farce.
As might be expected in a Korda picture, the production values are first-rate. The delicious sets were designed by Korda's brother Vincent and the costumes by Oliver Messel; the great French cinematographer Georges Perinal did the photography; and the movies features quite a good score by Ernst Toch. As an added bonus, The Private Life of Don Juan includes one of the few screen appearances by Natalie Paley, a luminary of cafe society and Romanov princess who tried unsuccessfully to break into the movies.",983923200,5,3174,5.201171875
