8358265,3,B0029U1044,"A strange and interesting movie.  Unfortunately ""Synergy Entertainment"" seems to have dubbed the DVD straight from a VHS tape.  When they had seen the fruits of their labor and realized they had not completely destroyed the film - they then burned their logo into the screen periodically - like a frat boy proudly claiming a fart.  Perhaps, had they not done this, I would have lost the case and forgotten who ruined the transfer.",1320278400,2,430,4.783783783783784

In Euro-made THE DRIVER'S SEAT, Elizabeth Taylor plays an unmarried woman on a quest for her own private Kevorkian. Oddball Andy Warhol cameos here as an oddball Lord/diplomat.

SYNOPSIS--
The highly neurotic Lise (Taylor) arrives in Rome on a mandatory vacation and seeks out in the city's seamier districts a mate willing to love her and leave her... DEAD. Lise desires to be ceremoniously bound and then murdered with a knife. From appearances alone this woman is clearly unbalanced: smeared mascara, a max-tacky wardrobe and wild behavior are an attempt to stand out from the crowd as well as her desperate cry for help.

Macabre atmosphere captured through skilled cinematography, sets and lighting amply give a sense of the insanity that haunt's Lise's conscience. The obvious semi-deranged self-absorption of this character is wonderfully conveyed by Liz in one of her least remembered yet most-difficult roles.

If you're seeking typical popcorn fare you'd do best to try elsewhere, but if a logic-challenging movie with an offbeat performance by one of Hollywood's greats is your goal, then look no further-- cuz you've found it!
