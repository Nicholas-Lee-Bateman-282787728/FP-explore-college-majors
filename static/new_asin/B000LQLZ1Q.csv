8163684,1,B000LQLZ1Q,"This DVD was apparently made in one take with a 1980's era camcorder on a fixed tripod in a VFW hall's basement.  It comes to you in a homemade looking case with a jacket printed on an inkjet printer.  Get a marker, because it's also burned onto a plain white DVD, and you'll have to write the title on it if you don't want to lose it.....but then again, you probably do.  It didn't play on my DVD player, and had to be run off of my computer.  The price of a single DVD I'm sure covers the entire production, instructors' fees, manufacture, and shipping to your house, with a little left over to ship it back when you realize how lousy it is.  You should really check your local library, or take a dance class if you want to learn Viennese Waltz.",1261440000,2,747,4.195804195804196
8163685,5,B000LQLZ1Q,"If you wish to learn this most elegant of dances or just want to brush up on technique, order this dvd. Foster and Judi have over twenty five years experience teaching the Viennese Waltz and in this genre, they are in their element. Every step is clearly defined for both partners from several camera angles eliminating any confusion plus, Foster verbally explains what he is doing as it's being done to further accelerate the comprehension process. As Foster notes during each of the lessons, you will need to set your dvd on segment repeat a few times to polish what is presented, no sitting on the couch, please, then you can feel confident about displaying your new skills on any dance floor. Bravo, Foster and Judi  :)",1182297600,6,723,4.692913385826771
