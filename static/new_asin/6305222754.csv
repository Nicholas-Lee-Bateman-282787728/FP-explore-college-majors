989667,5,6305222754,Decent DVD conversion of this old comedy. I became familiar with this film via TV many years ago as a kid. Really liked it back then. Had tried to find the film for years to see it again. Still found it quite funny even though it is many decades old. Of course if you are looking for the colorful language of more recent films you won't find it here. In 1940 whatever they didn't do that stuff. They actually had to have decent writing.,1423872000,3,436,4.2023809523809526
989668,3,6305222754,"I love Fred MacMurray but I didn't love this movie.

It has been compared here, by other Amazon reviewers, to ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" (AOL), but it lacks the warmth and charm of AOL's loveable characters who may be crazy but are not the least bit sinister.  This movie wants to be another AOL.  It just doesn't get there.

Save your money and use it for one of Fred's many other great movies.  I recommend ""Remember the Night"" (A warm-hearted Christmas movie) or ""Double Indemnity"" (A GREAT murder mystery).",1423872000,,506,4.640449438202247

One of  Fred MacMurray's better comedic performances.

If you like comedy, Fred MacMurray or Marjorie Main then I'd recommend this.

The evil mirror image version of ""Ma Kettle""  Marjorie Main portrays in this move only adds to the shivers and fun.

The DVD is a burn on demand and I was worried about the quality and playability, but it has worked quite well  in both of our players and a friend's DVD player.  I highly recommend adding this DVD to your comedy collection.",1423353600,2,564,4.514851485148514

Pete immediately runs afoul of a murderous family of gun-happy maniacs led by an iron-fisted mother (Marjorie Main) sporting a bullwhip that she uses on everyone and everything.  They're after a stash of money and they don't care who they have to kill to get it.
There are mainly just two sets used in the course of this film, a house with secret passages, and an old barn.  All of the action takes place in a single night, so most of the scenes are poorly lit.  It's pretty pedestrian until the final act.  The humor is unbridled slapstick and a lot of yelling.  I bought it because it stars Marjorie Main.",1396742400,,845,4.371794871794871

990336,5,6305222754,"MURDER, HE SAYS (1945) - Not Rated, but obviously a `G' for great.  95 minutes

""Murder, He Says"" is a hilarious 95 minute comedy about a pollster who finds himself at the mercy of a clan of homicidal hillbillies.  Fred MacMurray, at his comic best, plays ""Pete Marshall"" a pollster for the Trotter Polling Company.  His job is to travel the country asking people about their lifestyles; asking people such daring questions as: Do they have indoor-plumbing, a refrigerator and stove? When another pollster goes missing,  MacMurray is sent to a tiny, backwoods town find him. The local folks send MacMurray ""up the road"" to the Fleagle Homestead, a family of radioactive, glow-in-the-dark hillbillies, lead by Marjorie Main of ""Ma & Pa Kettle"" fame. Ma Fleagle carries a mean looking shotgun and is suspicious of every stranger. Not surprising, as she and her twin boys, Bert and Mert (think Dweedledee and Dweedledum) both played by Peter Whitney, are searching for stolen loot hidden on their property.  This fast-paced farce is in the grand tradition of ""The Old Dark House"" (1932) and Frank Capra's ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" (1944) and will keep you laughing with some the most original, side-splitting gags I've ever seen in a Universal comedy.

Fred MacMurray turns in one of his most comic performances in 1945's MURDER, HE SAYS. He plays Pete Marshall, a pollster come to a remote mountain community to locate a vanished colleague. He winds up in a rundown old dark house in the woods, and following cryptic clues to hidden treasure and tangling with that house's residents, a murderous family called the Fleagles.

I've been waiting forever for MURDER, HE SAYS to come out on DVD, and now I can stop being sad.

MURDER, HE SAYS also carries just a whiff - a very toned down whiff - of THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE. And like THE GHOST BREAKERS, this one sends up the Old Dark House genre. Most of the gothic elements are present: the unsettling murder, the creepy house, the secret passageway, false identities, that sinister figure lurking in the shadows and occasionally ambushing the cast. The characters that MacMurray bumps into here are uniformly peculiar and all Fleagles of various persuasion: the crooked, whip-wielding matriarch (Marjorie Main, predictably strident); her shady professorial husband (a sly Porter Hall); an insane girl who keeps singing the same nonsense lyrics (Jean Heather); the brutish twins, one of whom can be immobilized by aggravating that crick in his back (Peter Whitney, playing both twins, thanks to some pretty seamless optical effects). An escaped convict (Helen Walker) surfaces soon enough, but even she's not what she seems.

Fred MacMurray is the glue, of course. He centers the film and he's terrific. The film gives you plenty of chances to grin real big. I couldn't stop chuckling when MacMurray pretends that another guy's legs were his own. And I love that sequence with the rotating Lazy Susan table and everyone trying to stay away from the poisoned dinner plate.

A poll taker bicycles to a rural area to search for his missing predecessor. Peter runs into a screwy murderous family who are looking for a hidden fortune in stolen bank loot. (Another search for unearned wealth.) The mother of this family had many husbands who left this earth unexpectedly. Twin sons with guns add comedy and violence to this story. There is a family member who broke out of jail (but Claire isn't really a family member). Their old house is suitably spooky with hidden doors and passages for extra mystery (a spooky mansion indicates a family that has seen better days). The grandmother just died, and may have passed on the secret of the treasure in a rhyme of nonsense lyrics. Who can understand or interpret it?

There is a luminous toxin that make people glow in the dark (like a ghost) before they die. What if the real Bonnie breaks out of jail? A loony daughter knows the meaning of those nonsense lyrics. Her talking tells Claire and Pete how to find the missing key to a safety deposit box! Can they escape with their lives and find a happiness? There is a comic chase with guns and dogs. Can a dead man return for the loot? Can the bad guys be tied up to save Claire and Pete? Will the police arrive in time to round up the gang?

The humor in this film is similar to what made the `Three Stooges' famous in that era. Its staging suggests an adaption from a Broadway play. The story is like a version of ""Arsenic and Old Lace"".

The two films' one commonality is that ornery old battleaxe Marjorie Main. Not that she's at all the reason I got this DVD set. I'm mostly here for those nonsense lyrics I couldn't get out of my head when I was a kid and singing: ""Honors flysis income beezis, onches nobsis inob keesis."" Somewhere, Irving Berlin is rolling over in his grave.

- MURDER, HE SAYS

Fred MacMurray turns in one of his most comic performances in 1945's MURDER, HE SAYS, playing Pete Marshall, a pollster come to a remote mountain community to find a vanished colleague. He winds up in a rundown old dark house in the woods, following cryptic clues to hidden treasure and tangling with that house's residents, a murderous family called the Fleagles.

I've been waiting forever for MURDER, HE SAYS to come out on DVD, and now I can stop being sad. MURDER, HE SAYS is a dark, zany, macabre comedy which borrows a bit from Bob Hope's THE GHOST BREAKERS, a horror comedy which these characters actually reference. MURDER, HE SAYS also carries just a whiff - a very toned down whiff - of THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE. And like THE GHOST BREAKERS, this one sends up the Old Dark House genre. Most of the gothic elements are here: the unsettling murder, the creepy house, the secret passageway, false identities, that sinister figure lurking in the shadows and occasionally ambushing the cast... The characters that MacMurray bumps into here are uniformly peculiar and they're all Fleagles of various persuasion: the crooked, whip-wielding matriarch (Marjorie Main, predictably strident); her shady professorial husband (a sly Porter Hall); an insane girl who keeps singing the same nonsense lyrics (Jean Heather); the brutish twins, one of whom can be immobilized by aggravating that crick in his back (Peter Whitney, playing both twins, thanks to some pretty seamless optical effects). An escaped convict (Helen Walker) surfaces soon enough, but even she's not what she seems.

Fred MacMurray is the glue, of course. He centers the film, and he's such a terrific comic actor. The film gives you plenty of chances to grin real big. I couldn't stop laughing when MacMurray pretends that another guy's legs were his own. And I loved that sequence with the rotating Lazy Susan table and everyone trying to stay away from the poisoned dinner plate. I won't even go into the glow in the dark shenanigans and the ghost Smedley. Somewhere in all this, MacMurray even finds the time to romance the escaped convict, who admittedly is pretty easy on the eyes. Hard-bitten she's not.

- FEUDIN', FUSSIN' AND A-FIGHTIN'

So when I got this two-disc set off the TCM website, it was solely for MURDER, HE SAYS. But, it turns out, FEUDIN', FUSSIN' AND A-FIGHTIN' isn't a half-bad musical comedy, not when it stars the always entertaining Donald O'Connor. This story takes place in the old West.

The feud between two neighboring rival frontier towns, Rimrock and Big Bend, always comes to a head in the annual foot race, a contest which Rimrock had been steadily losing for years now. With most of Rimrock in hock to Big Bend, its fate as its own independent town rests on this upcoming race, what with Rimrock mayor, Maribel Mathews (Marjorie Main), having wagered most of the town's money on the outcome. And so the desperate search is on for that runner fleet of feet.

Fast-talking hair tonic salesman Wilbur McMurtry rolls into town for a quick stopover. But his sales pitch at the disinterested residents causes him to be late for the departing stagecoach. When he sprints after the stagecoach (and catches it), Wilbur is promptly detained under the mayor's orders and locked up in the livery stable until the big race. Rimrock has its fleet-footed candidate.

Coming out in 1948,  FEUDIN' FUSSIN' AND A-FIGHTIN' is modest in that low budget kind of way, but it's got its charms. Donald O'Connor is the best thing about this movie, no surprise. Nothing tops his classic ""Make 'Em Laugh"" number in SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, but his performance of the Al Jolson standard, ""Me and My Shadow,"" is ridiculously good and shows off his athleticism and his fantastic hoofing. The other musical highlight is O'Connor's romantic duet with Penny Edwards in ""S'posin'."" Penny Edwards, by the way, can dance. It's a shame that she mostly made her hay co-starring in B-westerns, and that her dancing skills were pretty much mothballed.

There are some funny gags, like the physical routine O'Connor always observes whenever he's about to beat feet or the creek sequence, with O'Connor somehow time and again coming up with a progressively bigger fish. But mostly the humor is pretty lame. There's a parallel drawn as O'Connor is treated like a horse during his training as a sprinter, and we see O'Connor being led on a leash as he trots in a circle (how is that funny?). For fans of Ma and Pa Kettle, Marjorie Main reunites with Percy Kilbride, but I'm not one of those fans, so their interactions here leave me with a lukewarm reaction. I'm not much for hillbilly hokum. FEUDIN' FUSSIN' AND A-FIGHTIN' is worth watching for Donald O'Connor. If you walk away with only one memory from the watching of it, that memory will most likely center around O'Connor's ""Me And My Shadow."" Which is one of his best numbers ever.

Great cast, acting and comedy but there is a certain character I fell so in love with and that was Laney. The actress who played who is so beautiful and plays the character in such a cute innocent adorable way every time I see her I just wanna take her in my arms and kiss her.

This is the best comedy I have seen. And without the language and smut of more modern comdedies. It's all a comedy of errors, Fred landing in with the murderous hillbilly family headed by Marjorie Main. And identical twins played by I think Peter Whitney, one can be incapacitated by a chop to the neck while the other doesn't feel a thing, puts Fred in some dangerous situations. It's a must see.",1202774400,,565,4.231481481481482

festival on saturday's and sunday's and would like to see the film again I can still see that girl singing and turing the handle of the coffee grinder and would love to own it.

I would go and get it right a way and drive 100 miles to get it if I had to , I think my kid's would love it as much as i did .

991095,5,6305222754,"This is my favorite movie, I would watch it over and over. Fred Macmurray is one of my favorite actors especially in his comedy rolls.

The story is about a guy looking for a fellow worker who hasn't been seen since going to the Fleagles, a Ma and sons who don't take kindly to strangers snoopin around, especaiily since they are trying to find the hidden money. A story of murder, mayhem, & romance all rolled up in this funny comedy. A must see!",1138665600,6,447,4.321428571428571

I have not been able to find it sense. I go on the movie channels to see if anyone has it in their movie line-up but, NO ONE does! Now, I must admit, $58 is quite a chunk of change to pay for a VHS tape. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE put this jewel of a movie on DVD. I'm a college student, so enough said about how much money I have for non-essentials. so, PLEASE, put this movie on DVD!",1119916800,22,529,3.8623853211009176

991256,3,6305222754,"Fred MacMurray stars as a pollster looking for a disappeared colleague in hillbilly country who gets mixed up with Marjorie Main and her half-witted brood trying to recover some hidden money.  The film is non-stop action, as everyone is chasing or running away from everyone else.  There's glowing animals (and the odd person or two) and it's set in one of those only-in-a-movie houses with secret passageways behind the walls.  The characters aren't played with much subtlety, and the laughs are sometimes forced, but it's all played with a lot of energy.  A better director might have given the film a little style instead of just hammering home every scene, but if you like a lot of slapstick and chase films, you'll probably enjoy this one a lot,",1012003200,11,750,4.8359375

Marjorie Main is hilarious as the whip-cracking mother of twin sons and a ""touched"" daughter, (although none of them are playing with a full deck), looking for stolen money... and Fred MacMurray, a traveling survey-taker who's looking for a missing co-worker and how they found each other and the fun antics that occur! Just as I loved it as a child, my children love it now. I've been trying to find this moving to rent for ages, with no luck. I was thrilled to find it at Amazon.

991259,5,6305222754,"A curiously little-known film, this is a first-class example of a real ""sleeper"".  In the same native cornball-surreal black-comedy mode as ARSENIC AND OLD LACE (but much looser, sillier and funnier).  MacMurray plays an insurance salesman/pollster who stays with a zany family of hillbillies who are also ""hayseed"" murderers! Although sometimes a bit too strident, this is slapstick of the highest caliber (and definitely ahead of it's time).  Mother's cooking features a poison that glows in the dark, and in the climatic sequence, the assembled characters keep turning off the lights and keep spinning the lazy susan table to avoid ingesting the poison.  This bit is unique among farces; it's a classic of slaptick craziness!  The little-known Peter Whitney excels in his dual role while Marjorie Main (as the yowling, whipcracking Ma) and Mabel Paige (as the unloved Grandma) are stand-outs.  The work of director George Marshall is a bit square at times, as it isn't up to the brilliant madness and invention of Lou Breslow's screenplay.  The peroxided & buxom Barbara Pepper does well as Bonnie (she was Doris Ziffle on GREEN ACRES). Pepper was originally considered by Lucille Ball for the role of Ethel on I LOVE LUCY.  This excellent black farce is a rare gem. Highly recommended!",959472000,7,1289,5.104761904761904
991260,5,6305222754,"A truly hilarious and fun-filled movie in which MacMurray is nothing less than terrific. Fred plays a statistics gathering insurance salesman in the Ozarks. It's goodbye to sanity when we meet these hilarious hillbillies!  The crazy twin killers are brilliantly portrayed by Peter Whitney (as Mert  and Bert Fleagle) Barbara Pepper plays their sister Bonnie and Marjorie  Main is an absolute riot as Mamie Johnson. Bonnie has hidden 70,000 dollars  somewhere in the abode and MacMurray is kept confused by Main as a frantic  search for the dough ensues. The antics  and clever direction keep the  laughs coming at rapid fire pace, and this movie is a unique gem.",944611200,38,662,5.018348623853211

McMurray is hysterical in his role of a salesman who stumbles  upon a house of cooky crazies and gets involved in an intruiging case of  murder. In ways it's almost a little spooky, but mostly it had me rolling  in the aisles. I especially liked the part where Fred is stuck in that box  with one of the twins legs dangling out and it looks like he's sitting  down. Everytime I see that I almost die of hysterics. I love old movies and  love reviewing them, and if anyone else loves old movies such as these,  please email me!  I love talking about them.",944092800,24,714,4.1231884057971016
