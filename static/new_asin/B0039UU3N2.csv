8611253,5,B0039UU3N2,"One of the best and most touching films that I have seen. I wish it had found a major release. I was at the film festival that this premiered at to a sold out audience where it received a standing ovation and won for Best Short Film and Best Music. I was happy find it avaiable on Amazon to watch over and over and turn my friends on to it. I love music and this music was so touching, honest, and raw. Loren Haynes is amazingly talented, as he wrote the film, directed the film, wrote the music and it is incredible to watch him perform it all.  I took the time to write this review to share the experience. But, also because I read the existing reviewer and it is obviously a vindictive and jealous person. As it just was filled with meanness.",1277164800,,745,4.173611111111111
