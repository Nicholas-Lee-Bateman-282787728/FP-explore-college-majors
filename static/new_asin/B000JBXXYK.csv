2668485,1,B000JBXXYK,what to do w an actress who can barely act?? ---shoot her from behind !!!! since there isn't much of anything going on on her face or in her eyes-- the filmmakers had to resort apparently to shooting the film this way-- check it out for yerself-- throughout most of the film scenes are shot this way-we see her hair--- not her eyes---not her face why- because nothings going on w this actress---shes cute shes sexy - so we see her nude-- shot upon shot of her cleavage-- her legs-- ok-- but no acting !! -- the film is boring when shes in scenes--every one else in the movie is very believable-- esp compared to her- glueinhall acts generalities--neglects to create a character-- shes one of these so called actresses who is just a hottie that tasteless producer directors who also have minimal talent (?) want to work w--you won't ever see this gluein hall in anything substantial-- you will never see her create a character---she can act natural enough in front of a camera- shes only slightly self conscious---a lot of actors of this generation think acting is  just acting natural -- because they are not capable of anything more--  furthermore-this is a movie w no real plot---the prurient meaningless sex may keep the eyes of the dullards who expect nothing out of a movie interested i guess--- nothing real or creative goes on here- another emporers new clothes--  an embarassing paucity of riches here- the scene where glue in hall sings off key at the dinner table-- supposed to be poignant telling--- its just annoying---- when she slams the door at the end of that scene--- its a rich example of this actress who can curse and slam a door-- but w no character having been created-- its just meaningless---the reason why we have never seen betty davis meryl streep hepburn---or other actresses nude is not only because of standards imposed by themor others-- its because they were too busy acting  & creating a character involved in compelling stories---and want that shown !! brando said the key to film acting is not blinking-- the eyes are the windows to the soul ! in a better movie for example nicholson and ann margaret lets say -- these were compelling characters first---- not just hot bodies---another great nicholoson movie where hes got an actress around his waist--- doing it and banging into walls--etc--- that was compelling !! but this nonsense is disgusting not because of the gratuitous sex--but because of whats missing besides the sex and prurience--- its shocking to see the characters father molest her as she cries in his arms-its mildly interesting watching a bad actresss doing drugs and all the other pathetic things going on here-- but we have little sympathy for her-- due to her not makling the character real enough---stars usually insist on their being shot from the front in scenes--so we can see their work !!!!!!!!! she had no work to show so we see her eyes-- blank and dead anyway-- for only fleeting moments-- in a movie where shes in almost every scene !! i know a druggies eyes are supposed to look dead sometimes i guess-- but an actress playing her has to give more to keep us interested-- theres a new surreal tv show on now-- where we see real drug addicts acting badly-- and the last one i saw -- a young girl -obv on drugs-- was so much more compelling to watch than poor maggie here---if maggie was doing any realwork here wouldnt the myriad scenes w her have been shot so we could see her eys and face !  and one more thing-- i learned in college-- that drama involves a character changing somehow--- since this character stays the same throughout -- theres no real drama going on anyway---- we see her more clearly in each scene as the spoiled screwed up white trash sexually abused mess she was in the first scene---supposed to see it anyway----mediocre movie-- acted better by everyone but the lead---sad indeed !,1169942400,8,3872,4.696612665684831
2668486,4,B000JBXXYK,"The reason I was interested in seeing this movie was the Oscar buzz on Maggie Gyllenhaal. I was certainly hoping she would be getting a more challenging role after Secretary. Sherrybaby is a very heavy duty film to watch, because there's a lot issues involved by Sherry. She gets out of jail, on a probation and intends to reconnect to her little girl. She had to start all over again by finding a job and trying to stay clean at the same time. She was willing to offer her potential employer sexual favors if she gets hired. She goes to AA meetings and still ramdomly has casual sex with strangers while trying to stay away from substances. At this point I am already comparing Maggie's performance and character to Maggie Cheung's Clean, because it's almost like watching a remake of Clean with some additional disturbing issues like father-daughter incestious love and a ton of nudity and sex. Yes, the movie really focused well on the road of recovery in Sherry's life, and about the choices she makes and how she must survive her past in order to make better choices. After viewing this film, I am thinking had the studio pushed for Gyllenhaal, she could've taken the Oscar nomination held by Meryl Streep.",1169856000,2,1211,4.690140845070423
2668487,5,B000JBXXYK,"Laurie Collyer both wrote and directed this very fine little film that examines the world in which addicted people live, even after they have 'paid their debt to society' by being imprisoned.  She does not play to the sympathy of the audience: she rather empathizes with one woman's plight in her struggle to gain control of a life she has never been able to successfully assemble.

Sherry Swanson (a brilliant tour de force by Maggie Gyllenhaal) has been in prison for robbery, drug possession and heroin addiction for several years and as the film opens she is released to her hometown in New Jersey where she is assigned a parole officer (Giancarlo Esposito) and a 'safe haven' home.  She longs to see her five-year-old daughter Alexis (Ryan Simpkins) whom she barely knows and who has been living with her brother

Bobby (the excellent Brad William Henke) and his wife Lynette (Bridget Barkan). After encountering much prejudice and abuse heaped on ex-cons looking for work, Sherry manages to find a job working with kids and tries desperately to re-connect with Alexis but is rebuffed by Lynette and warned by Bobby that should she bring drugs in the house he will send her back to prison.

Sherry stumbles through her out-of-prison existence, connecting with old friends at an AA meeting, having a fling with her old flame Dean (Danny Trejo), attending a birthday party for Alexis given at her parents home where her father (Sam Bottoms) comforts her in a sexually intrusive way, and struggling with her roommates until she moves out on her own.  She aches from not belonging, from the fact that her life on the 'outside' is as much a prison as on the 'inside', and she returns to drugs.  Given an ultimatum by her parole officer she finally thinks she can put her life back together, but a planned outing with daughter Alexis forces Sherry to face the fact that she is not capable of the skills of mothering and she is able finally to ask for help from her caring brother.

Maggie Gyllenhaal is Sherry with every  fiber of her being. It is a performance worthy of top honors.  The beauty of the film is the fact that it does not opt for Hollywood happy endings: it merely stops with many questions unanswered - as is the case in life with people who suffer the agonies of addiction.  It is beautifully acted and filmed and it deserves the attention of not only lovers of fine film, but also people who want to try to understand the horrors of drug addiction in a society unprepared to cope with it.  Highly Recommended.  Grady Harp, January 07",1169683200,36,2550,4.677852348993288
2668488,4,B000JBXXYK,"Maggie Gyllenhaal as Sherry demonstrates a character who has to fight the system (hostile Parole Officers, advantage seeking counselors), her own internal demons (addiction, immaturity, and low-self esteem), and the external demons (a father who appears supportive but only so he can continue the sexual abuse of his self-destructive daughter, though is it any wonder? Plus a daughter who doesn't know her).  Sherry's only real ally is her brother who shows genuine caring and support for a sister who lives a reverse (perverse) philosophy existence contrary of everything he believes in (he even notes that he quit smoking displaying his strength to her weaknesses).  Sherry is self-destructive, and a victim, yet she's a fighter too.  Dean, who she believes is her friend, still uses her for sex unbeknownst to her own nave nature. Additionally, she's quite willing to use her sexual prowess to get ahead, because her low self-esteem has her believing it's all she has.  So sad, and just so Realistic.  A MUST see.",1169683200,5,1016,5.133333333333334
2668489,3,B000JBXXYK,"Maggie Gyllenhaal is on a roll.  She's had several fine performances, but this time she outshines herself in 'Sherrybaby'.  In this movie she plays an ex-convict on parole after three years in prison.  Getting out is a hard transition, and Gyllenhaal knows her character thoroughly.  Being someone who stole money to supply a heroin addiction, her road to recovery in and out of prison is rocky at best.  She has tough parole officers who won't give her an inch and starts living in a half-way house with others who are a living hell.  A recovering addict and former inmate, her nerves are frayed, so it is understandable that she is impatient to get her life back together.  Her daughter, Alexis, has stayed with her brother, Bobby (Brad William Henke) and sister-in-law, Lynette (Bridget Barkas).  Alexis is happy to see her mother, but is torn between her and her uncle's family whom she accepts as her own.  Her sister-in-law is protective and isn't willing just to give up her foster child at the drop of a hat.

The film is written and directed by Laurie Collyer, who, along with Gyllenhaal, keep the movie real throughout.  It is always a step forward for Sherry who is torn between being a good citizen and model mother, and the old Sherry who got herself into trouble in the first place.  Often times she finds herself going to AA meetings one minute; then offering sex to get ahead, the next.  We don't always like the character, but, this is really to the film's credit.  She's a believable, but not always a good, protagonist.  One old acquaintance, has some good advice, ""If you wouldn't talk about what you want all the time...Maybe it will come to you.""  Her recitation of the St. Francis Prayer at AA meetings pinpoints her condition, ""Give me the help to change what I can,  accept what I can't, and the ability to know the difference.""  It's at the crux of the problem.  While some of the movie develops like a fine TV adventure, key elements, especially Gyllenhaal's remarkable performance, make the movie a fine film.",1169596800,5,2037,4.703389830508475
2668490,4,B000JBXXYK,"This is certainly not the ""feel good"" movie of the year but it is one of the best actibg turns I've seen recently. Maggie Gyllenhaal, who has been known mostly for roles as quirky women (""Secretary"" was just one), is the reason to see this tale of a drugged out criminal who is trying to get her life back in order and regain her young daughter. We never learn who the child's father is or the circumstances of the child's birth. Actually all we know is that ""mommy was sent to prison for stealing"". And, though you keep rooting for Sherry (Maggie's title role) to ""make it"", you know it's a tough road.

Despite the plot flaws, and missing pieces, you will be unable to take your eyes off of Maggie. (The fact that there are multiple scenes of Gyllenthaal's gorgeous nude body are just ""icing on the cake""). There's lots of expletives here too so it's not a family film.

Her acting is stunning!

The star rating is based on the fact that the DVD release is devoid of any supplementals except for the film's trailer. There must have been deleted scenes - helping to flesh out Sherry's background - but none are included. And a Director's commentary would have helped too!

Maggie was nominated for a Golden Globe - but lost - and should be in the Oscar noms, which will be announced next week.

This film is definitely worth watching just to see this performance , which ranks on a par with Charlize Theron's turn in Monster a few years ago.

2668491,4,B000JBXXYK,"this young woman's struggles didn't move me but sadden me a lot. a story being told many times already, almost similar to holle berry's 'Losing Isaiah'. same helpless and hopeless situation and storyline. maggie gyllenhaal did a very good and unpretentious job in this actually pretty boring movie. the father's was a mis-cast, looked too young to be her father. furthermore, why everytime a production out of hollywood would have to put a woman to find a job by bending over or kneeling down in front a man? it's not just cliched but also very disgusting.
well, tough luck. if sherry's brother and his wife(especially the wife) got kids by themselves, then they might not be so parentally protective and selfish to sherry's daughter. if sherry not turned out to be drug addict and imprisoned so long, this story might not even have happened. what goes around, comes around. you could blame to sherry's bad zodiac and feng suei.",1168128000,5,928,4.8427672955974845
2668492,5,B000JBXXYK,"I went to the screening in LA last night for Sherry Baby. I wasn't going to attend but I am so glad that I did; even gladder still that the invite made it to me in the first place!

Suject matter is very adult but presented so telling and so honest and Maggie redeems her character with perfection. I've seen Maggie act before but never like this. Everyone did such a marvelous job. It's like watching people you know; not like being in a movie theater.

Great job!! Buy this movie as a permanent addition to your collection and watch it with your friends. The discussion it will bring forth after you watch the movie is worth the price of admission & more!!",1168128000,28,658,4.341463414634147
2668563,3,B000JBXXYK,"....liked Maggie G's performance, just thought the script could have ended better. Ya never leave the audience hanging with this kind of film. Obviously the Sherry character was finally waking up, but they could have shown her in rehab with the PO standing in the distance with a smile on his face. Those few moments would have given us, the viewers, a little closure for this story. Otherwise, I did like the story even if it was a bit hard watching because of the circumstances.

I have spent time with women with this types of issues, and Maggie does a great job at portraying the emotional ups and down , high and lows. I just didn't like that there wasn't a resolve with her father and that situation but I mean i still liked the movie. She is a great character actress",1511395200,,419,4.3164556962025316

2668593,2,B000JBXXYK,"She allows a child rapist free access to her daughter, and so does the girl's legal guardian -- even though it was clear he knew what the perv was, too. The perv was obviously a psychopath, too, treating his own adult daughter (desperate for his attention even then) like she was invisible and worthless, paying no attention to her until feeling her up -- when she was crying over her own daughter, desperate, and collapsing, seeking her ""father's"" support, poor delusional creature that she was. It was chilling to watch that scene. Neither the main character or her brother even try to keep the monster away from the little girl, never mind trying to get him arrested...only a matter of time until history repeats itself.

2668594,1,B000JBXXYK,"Poor portrayal by the lead actress. I could only get through about 15 minutes. She is stamped with the last Hollywood iteration of what a Christian is, someone who carries around a Bible but acts just as they did before.

2668595,4,B000JBXXYK,"Very well made, especially when you realize it was a low budget movie. The only thing you have to prepare for is that it is sad almost from start to finish. Not a movie you would want to watch after a bad day at work or if you are stressed out and need some cheering up.
Very honest and doesn't hold back or sugar coat things. Also not something you should watch if you have kids in the room.

My only complaint is her father looked like he was the same age as Sherry so there were a couple of scenes I didn't realize who he was at first even though the word Dad is spoken.
Maggie Gyllenhaal definitely gave it every thing she had to make this character come to life, she ""left it all on the field"" if you are familiar with that sports saying.",1492646400,4,743,4.054421768707483

I'm not secluded and don't live under a rock; I understand that these people exist and I feel compassion towards them. But having actors act out the actual sex scenes is unnecessary. It used to be that movies allowed ones mind to imagine the horror of the goings-on inside the drug world. And great actors were able to get the point across by acting, not actually doing, if that makes sense.

It is an unbelievable acting job to carry out the desperation of this single mom to connect with her 5 yr. old. Besides the veracity of Sherry's character, all the other seedy, immoral trash in her surroundings, Maggie Gyllenhaal manages to step up from her gutter in such a visceral way in the end I can only admire her attempt. The editing is so seamless it approaches documentary realism even in the forced, awkward 'family situations,' where Sherry is only physically present while everyone else pretends to normality. There is one scene signalling the source of the dysfunction, when an embrace with a family member becomes a quick grope without further comment. Like ""Ruby,""or ""Thirteen,"" this was an Academy Award attempt that Hollywo"" od should have paid attention to. Instead, Hollywood nominated a singing cowboy-type film rather than suggest a ""Midnight Cowboy"" sleeper. This is a modern ""Of Human Bondage"" story and acting job that would make Betty Davis proud.",1444953600,11,1085,5.067039106145251

2669198,4,B000JBXXYK,"This 2006 film is a good, powerful, shocking and extremely upsetting social drama. It certainly is something that you don't forget easily. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

The film begins when a young woman named Sherry Swanson (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is released from prison, meets her parole officer and starts looking for a job - and also tries to repair her relationship with her little daughter Alexis, who in her absence was raised by her brother and his wife. It is going to be a very bumpy ride, as Sherry is a former heroine addict - and the hardships she faces make her crave a moment of articificial bliss... She will get however some help from another former convict/addict, Dean Walker (Danny Trejo).

This is a very tough film, so tough that by moments I found it almost impossible to watch - especially in the most heartbreaking moments between Sherry and Alexis. I found this film more disturbing than most of the horrors I saw, even if finally not so much happens, other that day to day struggle of a broken, suffering human being.

There are some hints about Sherry's past and they make this film even tougher to watch... but I will say no more here.

The performance of Maggie Gyllenhaal is incredible and I am very surprised that she wasn't at least nominated for an Oscar. She very much carries this film on her shoulders - and other parts of her body, which she displays here a lot... After watching her in this film and in ""Secretary"" I am in awe of her talent and also of her courage, because she sure as hell doesn't pick easy roles... Danny Trejo gives also a great show in a rather atypical role. Giancarlo Esposito (of ""Breaking Bad"" fame) is also very good as a tough, no-nonsense parole officer.

I would probably rate this film five stars if it was not for the very ending, which I found weak - almost as if the director didn't know how to wrap the film and decided to just rush it and get it over with.

That being said, it is still a good, powerful drama and even if it shook me badly, I am glad that I discovered it. This is not a film which you will enjoy - but it is very much worth watching. A recommended viewing.",1442707200,,2174,4.43609022556391

2669222,2,B000JBXXYK,"I'm not quite sure what so many people are seeing as great acting. I'm not seeing bad acting, or directing for that matter. The real challenge with the movie is not in the acting it's in the story. The human tragedy depicted in the movie is simply just that a human tragedy, nothing you cannot see playing out in lives of people all over the world each and every day. If seeing this storyline in a movie is that moving perhaps getting out of the delusion that might be 'normal' life is reasonable tactic for finding some reality in one's life.

What I was always looking for in this movie was just one redeeming player in the drama, again not the acting but just one character that was awake and aware that the tragedy was going on around them. For a moment I thought it might be the brother or father of Sherry until the scene where the father fondles sherry at her daughters birthday, the brother see's it but avoids doing anything about it... At almost each and every turn either Sherry herself or those in her life cannot seem to find even a shred of compassion and decency with which to move this girls life forward in any direction other than the same darkness that it is accustomed to.

If what this movie was intended to portray is a truly sad state of affairs in the life of a sexually abused (and confused) young women; a life where she seems to be destined to never come across anyone that can provide true caring (or love) without taking something valuable in return, then give it a five star rating.",1440806400,,1512,4.396428571428571

In the last 5 minutes Sherry, a selfish drug abuser, realizes she is not equipped or even willing to raise her child alone after over an hour of screwing up and being an unattractive person. I was surprised the brother didn't say something about the father abusing her. Screwed up family. Nothing attractive watching her smoking all the time or all the AA-ers smoking outside the meeting, for that matter. Good thing ""Bill"" wasn't at the meeting. She would have given him some ""pleasure"" to skip the 12 steps. Okay, now the good part. Maggie G. reminds me (looks like) Susan Blakely when she was in ""Rich Man, Poor Man"". Maggie G. also did a great job portraying a character I couldn't like. Not enjoyable.

After thinking about it, here is what really bothers me about the film... while the movie captured the alienated parent's feelings of longing for the child and even the trap of buying gifts and planning ""outings"" to have ""fun"" with the child (overcompensating), as well as the particularly disturbing behavior of the sister-in-law in  telling the child to call her Mother by her first name... but it didn't portray Sherry as a basically good person who was struggling with drugs Instead, they portrayed Sherry as immature, impulsive, selfish, and hopeless. She wasn't struggling to get better. I think anyone who is an alienated parent would dislike a movie that fully blames the alienated parent. Many alienated parents (particularly in divorces or where dysfunctional families take away the biological parent's child) aren't hopeless, or even bad parents. And then there is the question of why Sherry got involved with drugs and stealing... her being sexually abused by her Father. They never resolved that or had her show any type of upset over it. We also don't see Sherry fighting her way back. Getting better as she gradually gets back in her daughter's life... learning what she would have to do and learn to be a parent.  Heck, I don't think any viewer would think Sherry would ever be successful in the inpatient treatment. And then there is the little girl's sobbing... very disturbing...  the conflict she was feeling. Poor kid. Poor viewers.",1432684800,,2201,4.908602150537634

But when she repeatedly used sex to get her way with everything she wanted, that was ""it"" for most of the audience - who were by no means prudes - who were both laughing and groaning - and calling the actress names by that point. I think the best point the film made with this particular population was that ""this is what you don't do in early recovery"" - or maybe - ""this is what complete lack of insight looks like"" - anyway - the best response from anyone was ""profoundly irritating"" and most of them ""hated it"" - so, there you go.

2669439,4,B000JBXXYK,"I've always said one thing about drugs, to my children and to anyone willing to listen--that the cost of using is EVERYTHING. Drugs come with a markup that literally costs anything and everything the user cares about. Sherrybaby is a glimpse into the life of a recovering addict, and what using has cost her.

Maggie Gyllenhaal is utterly breathtaking in her portrayal of Sherry Swanson, a former heroin addict who has just been released from a three year prison stay. I don't know if this is the case with most people, but especially for those who have grown up in a crime infested community--there is some sort of an unmistakable radar that even an ex-user sends that is instantly recognizable. Obviously, Maggie Gyllenhaal is not a former heroin addict, and as such her stunning portrayal of Sherry is solid proof of her rare talent. Gyllenhaal flawlessly captures every nuance, street lingo, even the manner of carrying herself physically--of those of the hardcore drug subculture. If the viewer didn't know better, he would think he was watching the real thing. There is simply not a moment where Gyllenhaal is not Sherry Swanson.

The film opens with Sherry on a bus heading to her destination--a halfway house.

 Sherry gets off on the wrong foot with nearly everyone. Completely acclimated to prison life, where a bumped shoulder is cause for damage, she becomes enraged when a harried business man brushes past her. It is clearly innocent, just a moment in the middle of a busy day of urban life. Sherry screams profanities at the man shouting ""Excuse me sir!! You just bumped into me!!"" At that point we prepare for a bumpy ride as we see that Sherry may be out of prison physically, but is still very much 'inside.' Once she settles in at the halfway house, she locks horns with an aggressive woman who seems to feel rejected by Sherry. While the woman in question is clearly a negative type to be avoided, much of the ensuing clash may have been diminished if Sherry had not been so obtuse in her rejection. The woman picks at Sherry who is already irritated by her inability to speak to her child on the phone. The pair come to blows, and Sherry dishes out some truly hateful insults. House manager Dorothy Washington calms them down by threatening to call 911. Not wanting a one-way ticket back to prison, the two back off.

There is the chronic inappropriateness of Sherry's attire. In skimpy clothing Sherry saunters down the street, wearing a combo of a yellow crochet halter top, mini floral skirt and towering black platforms that make her look like a refugee from 1965. Her hair is an over bleached blonde, a brassy pile of a prison color job. She only makes herself look more severe when she impulsively dyes her hair a dark brown, and hacks it into an unflattering shag. Sherry looks bizarre even among her street dwelling neighbors. The entire physical presentation, coupled with an immaturity that is jaw dropping, serve to make certain that Sherry will continue to be marginalized. Sherry succeeds in getting noticed, but it is not the kind of attention any stable person welcome. Despite her seedy presentation, Sherry is beautiful, albeit of a slightly faded beauty which bears testimony to a life lived rough for years. Whether her looks are a curse or a benefit, Sherry is fixated on her physical attractiveness. She uses her body in a manner which is pathetic, almost comedic were her vulnerability not ever present beneath the hard exterior.

Sherry's brother Bob and sister-in-law Lynette have been raising Sherry's daughter Alexis, and the small family is tightly bonded. Sherry has been living on an assumption that upon her release, she will seamlessly assume care of Alexis. Sherry is exasperating in her demands on the couple. She does not seem to realize the priceless gift they have given her in taking care of the child, who would have otherwise been lost in the nightmare of the foster care system. Sherry feels only anger and resentment, especially toward Lynette. Lynette may initially come off as a controlling harridan; we soon see that she is justified in her wariness. Bob and his wife have worked hard to build a child-centered home, a haven of stability and warmth. Only once does Bob hint at how difficult it has been to assume parenting in Sherry's place. The viewer only knows that Sherry was an addict from the ages of 16-22; there is the real possibility that Alexis may have been born addicted to drugs. There is the impression that it has been a hard road for all involved. Sherry fails to contemplate the sacrifices that may have been made to parent the child she abandoned to drugs and crime. Lynette maintains a lovely home, and has a strong relationship with her husband, if strained due to issues with Sherry. Lynette is a person with her feet on the ground, and might have pursued a career or had her own children, which Bob admits they have postponed for Alexis' sake.

The family dynamics between Sherry and the rest of the Swansons quickly darken, revealing deep complexities and strain. Life has gone on for the Swansons during Sherry's incarceration, and she fails to grasp that it would behoove her to tread lightly. Rather than wisely taking baby steps, Sherry intrudes on her family with the subtlety of a steam roller. Except for Bob, who is kind to a fault, none of the other Swanson family members seem exactly thrilled to see Sherry home. Lynette is rattled from the first day for obvious reasons. Sherry's relationship with her father is profoundly disturbed. When he arrives at Bob's for a family dinner, Sherry begins to behave like a child. She competes with Alexis for her father's attention, and postures strangely until she has embarrassed everyone in the house. Sherry's new stepmother is passably polite, but reveals her discomfort toward Sherry through facial expression and body language. The father's wife also seems very close with Lynette, and since it is unlikely that she is aware of the dysfunction between Sherry and her father, she may view Sherry as entirely selfish, and the source of pain for her family. The viewer may better understand Sherry later on in the film, when one horrifying incident will bring Sherry's psyche into sharper focus.

Alexis is completely overwhelmed by her mother, and is by turns hyperactive and tearful, confused by the disruption to her life. Lynette has long established a healthy routine of predictability into the child's life, and Sherry is disrespectful of her parenting efforts. Within days of her release Sherry insists she must live with Bob and his family, straining the household to the breaking point.

The atmosphere in the home deteriorates rapidly, and tensions escalate. Sherry reveals her immaturity in below the belt tactics, like accusing Lynette, who is slightly overweight, of being jealous of her figure. Despite Bob's unfailing kindness, he will brook no disrespect toward his wife, and Sherry finds herself escorted out of the home and placed in a motel.

It is said that an addict is only as mature as the age which he/she began using. Sherry admits to becoming addicted to heroin at 16, but there is another dark factor which may have stunted her development at an even younger age.

Though Sherry has experienced exploitation and abuse, particularly at the hands of her father, who is revealed to be a deeply disturbed, there are strengths in her life. She genuinely loves children, and demonstrates a talent in working with them. In one notable scene she grabs angrily at an abusive mother who is cruelly browbeating her young child. Though her delivery is inappropriate, her desire to rescue an abused child is admirable, and the audience will rooting for her. Bob loves her unconditionally, though she sometimes abuses this. Another positive in Sherry's life is Dean Walker, an honest and kindly sort who is willing to be a true friend to Sherry. Walker, beautifully played by Danny Trejo, offers Sherry desperately needed emotional support and wise guidance. This comes as a surprise, as viewers might assume Walker will be another cheap hook-up, just like that with the Genesis program director, of all people, in the first scenes of the film. (The sex scene with the program director is ugly, sordid, and was entirely unnecessary. It truly detracts from the film.) Sherry's initial intimacy with Walker, which she initiates entirely, evolves into a tender friendship. Walker is also an ex-convict, and recovering user. But unlike Sherry, he is possessed of a mature character, is living clean, supporting his children who live in Oklahoma. One gets the impression that Walker's freedom and life of quiet serenity have been very hard-won. While he is nobody's fool, he allows Sherry into his life, making no more promise than to be a friend. And he is there for Sherry when she falls, and seems to understand the depths of her pain. But he is also capable of giving Sherry some stern advice when needed.

There is a watershed moment in the film when after a devastating scene with her father, Sherry goes back to using heroin. The consequences will be very severe. For Sherry's parole officer, Officer Hernandez, played to perfection by Giancarlo Esposito, is virtually clairvoyant with his parolees, silently shadowing them.

Sherry is given two very harsh options as a result of her violation, and for a while she plans to abscond.

Sherry manipulates Bob into allowing to take Alexis out for a day. All parties are woefully unprepared for a long unsupervised visit. Alexis is crying and begging to stay home; Lynette is nearly hysterical. Predictably the outing is disastrous, and Sherry is finally forced to realize some hard truths about her situation. Unwilling to disturb Alexis further, Sherry concedes what the viewer knew all along. Sherry must admit, if only to herself, that Alexis' real parents are Bob and Lynette. That the bond forged over five years between the three cannot be undone or overlooked without destroying the most innocent party of all--Alexis.

Though the film is heartbreaking, it is not without some points of light.

Sherry will hopefully face the consequences for her actions, and commit to a clean life.  Sherry's brother Bob is a strong and loving person in her life. Hopefully Sherry will realize that her father will always be a destructive force in her life and will protect herself by establishing a permanent distance between them. (Sometimes, as in cases of sexual abuse, getting out of the proximity of the abuser is the only answer.) There is the hope that once Sherry attains some stability, Dean Walker will still be in the picture. And most of all: even though it is highly unlikely that Alexis will ever live with Sherry, she might achieve a meaningful relationship with her.

Everything will surely fail if Sherry does not establish a lasting lifestyle of sobriety. And that can only be achieved, as every recovering user knows--One day at a time.",1384732800,3,10953,4.9049676025917925

Tragically that same friend had passed away at the age of 27 last year (May 2011) of a heroin overdose. To this day we're not sure if it was intentional or accidental. Watching this film again the other night reminded me how much it hits close to home - in more ways than one. 'Sherrybaby' tells what lies in store for a woman (Gyllenhall, in an Oscar-worthy performance) who has fallen into the abyss of hard drugs, prison, loss of her child and is trying to return within a system that seems to be hell bent on controlling every aspect of her life (led by the phenomenal Giancarlo Esposito, a hardassed parole officer). Seeing behind her habit and what drove Sherry to her irresponsible behaviors displayed, it could be difficult to watch the destructive and depressing scenes that are shown. Danny Trejo appears as well, perfectly cast as Sherry's on-again/off-again lover and former addict. I would recommend seeing this movie if you want to study great acting, but stay away from it if you don't like gritty realism and a somewhat bleak storyline.",1332028800,2,1193,4.658767772511848

2669448,4,B000JBXXYK,"This film is a depressing agony to watch.  Gyllenhaal is absolutely excellent as an addict who faces the bleak prospect of building a life on the outside, a survival struggle with things that are taken for granted by most of us.  Aside from a few strained relationships, she has little structure in her life beyond the starkness and naked reality of the correctional system.  Her child is frightened of her with good reason, and she has no idea how to re-build a fundamental relationship that she has ruined by her own failures and compulsions.  She is full of rage and has few assets beyond her body.  Even her father, in a brief horrific scene, reveals himself as a fundamental betrayer, a participant in her confusion and chaos, an indication of so much that pointed her toward ruin in her life.

I could barely stand to watch this, Gyllenhaal plays it so well that you feel what she is gong through and hope against hope for her.  The other actors are equally strong, in particular the young daughter who alternately plays and cries.  It is so painful to watch them all together, a downward spiral just waiting to happen.

Recommended, but be prepared.  It reminded me of what a thin veil the structure of our lives really is.",1288396800,2,1230,4.626728110599078
2669449,4,B000JBXXYK,"A little more honest than I expected, `Sherrybaby' really delivers a severe punch to the gut thanks to a daring performance by Maggie Gyllenhaal.

The film tells the story of Sherry Swanson, a former wild child who was just released from prison after serving a three-year stint for stealing and drug use.  She has tight rules to follow in order to ensure her freedom, but her main concern is her young daughter Alexis.  Alexis has been living with Sherry's brother Bobby and his wife Lynette for the entirety of Sherry's jail-stay, and now that she is out there is an obvious tension mounting between the three of them.  Sherry wants to take over instantaneously as a mother, yet she's never really been one and so making that transition is difficult.  As the pressure begins to suffocate her, she begins to crave her former life as a way to escape the inevitable.

Has she really learned her lesson?

The film is certainly flawed in areas, and there are times when the construction can seem almost `Lifetime' worthy, but the deeply rooted performances and the scripts ability to remain honest without being preachy (there are insinuations that help explain Sherry's behavior without ever feeling the need to divulge the truth, which is commendable because it allows the audience to think for themselves instead of spoon feeding them sympathies) anchors the film rather well.  I will admit that the film has us sympathize with Sherry a little too much.  While it brings itself back in towards the end (when we witness Sherry realize her own faults), it lacks an objectivity that I think would have made this film nearly perfect.  Despite the brilliant way in which Maggie exposes Sherry's selfishness, we tend to see everything as Sherry sees it, and so we stand firmly at her side, and technically she doesn't deserve that from us; at least not yet.

The performances here are all so richly developed.  If you sidestep Lynette's character (which is really nothing but a walking clich) and the truly unnecessary love interest (for me, it totally takes away from the film in an odd way) you have a deeply moving look at a broken family.  Sam Bottoms, Brad William Henke and Maggie Gyllenhaal are all superb here.  Sam Bottoms only has a few scenes (two I think), but he works an uncomfortable subtlety into his character that really underlines his serious flaws without making them the forefront of the scene.  In fact, this film carries with it an uncomfortable subtlety that really helps make it feel more human.  I loved what Henke did with his character, maybe because I've lived it and so I completely sympathize with his position.  Being stuck between your wife and her opinions and your blood and their mistakes is a very hard place to be, and despite your own emotions, you can continually feel neglected because everyone around you is selfishly expecting you to be 100% on their side.

And then there is Maggie.  The way she crafted this character, with such daring and fearless gusto (yet always maintaining the discomfort that comes from realizing you are a train wreck) is just superb.  She permeates each scene with a radiance that draws you to her.  There is this beautiful honesty that comes from the tragedy she unfolds before us.  Just watch her eyes while others are talking to her.  Gyllenhall understood that Sherry needed to be faulty, yet she needed to be honest.  She's honest to a fault.  She craves everything she feels as though she lost while locked away, and she wants it right now.  Her dinner scene, the singing scene, to me was the most raw and personal because you could see a desperation to be loved and noticed that just bled into her every word.  The way she bounces on the sofa when the family seems to be ignoring her.  She needs to be at the center of everyone's lives because she needs to be sure that they love her.

So, I do recommend this film.  It needed a little polishing, but it is far more honest than I expected.  It reminds me a tad of `Rachel Getting Married'.  The two films are very different in structure but they carry a similar weight and they craft a similar portrait of a young woman trying to atone for her past mistakes.

Watch them both.",1281484800,,4196,4.688524590163935
2669450,3,B000JBXXYK,"You've seen Monster and thought it was a fantaastic film. Imagine an imperfect monster with one of your favourite actresses, Maggie. The film is a watered down Monster and there are many disturbing things about the character's life.

The storyline is just sad and though it's been played out quite well my Maggie Gylenhaal, I feel I could've lived without this film and this would be my least favourite Maggie Gyl film.

2669456,4,B000JBXXYK,"See this film for a tour de force performance by Maggie Gyllenhaal.  She is amazing at getting you to care about a burned out self-destructive, selfish, drug addict.

The script leaves a lot to be desired.  Somewhere I read that the writer based the film on the life of friend of hers.  So it is a stunning portrait of this person, be she fictional or real.  However, as a film, the structure is weak.  We see Sherry as she encounters problem after problem and I had the feeling that disaster was around the corner at every moment. And it usually was. There were a few happy moments when she worked with kids at a daycare center, but most of the action was about pain and trouble.  Too much of this makes for a one-dimensional film.

At one point, near the end of the film, we see an encounter with her father when his comforting hug turns sexual which I guess is supposed to account for how Sherry became a drug addict in the first place.  As much as I appreciate the writer not hitting us over the head with this bit of information, it is glossed over so casually that it left me wondering if that was really it?  Surely she seems addicted to sex as well as drugs. Well, the girl really is a mess.  And yet I kept pulling for her.

Somehow this seems closer to a documentary of what a person goes through upon emerging from prison, than a piece of fiction.  It is hard to watch and I think a lot of people might have a hard time with it.  Gyllenhaal's beauty and charm carry the show.  She is a fearless actress and for that I give the movie four stars.

SherryBaby features a tour de force performance by Maggie Gyllenhaal as Sherry Swanson, a recovering drug addict just released from prison wanting new chances in life and a real relationship with her five year old daughter. The plot moves along at a good pace and the acting was very convincing; I was never bored and unlike some other reviewers I thought the acting by the principle cast was uniformly well done. The cinematography and the choreography show careful forethought and good judgment; and there's excellent character development, too.

When the film begins, we see Sherry Swanson (Maggie Gyllenhaal) returning home on a bus after being released from prison for possession of drugs and robbery. Sherry desperately wants to contact her brother Bobby (Brad William Henke) and his wife Lynette (Bridget Barkan) who have been taking care of Sherry's very young daughter Alexis (Ryan Simpkins). However, Sherry first checks into a halfway house and a drug rehab plan, there she meets Andy (Rio Hackford) who doesn't exactly mind some time alone with Sherry even though he's the director of the halfway house! Look also for an excellent performance by Michelle Hurst as Dorothy Washington, the matron of the halfway house who settles fights and organizes things; and this gets important when Sherry fights pretty badly with Desi (Sandra Rodrguez), another resident of the halfway house.

Sherry realizes the halfway house is too rough an environment for her; the stress could cause her to relapse and use drugs. Her brother Bobby and his wife Lynette, who aren't too thrilled to even see her again, decide anyway to let Sherry stay with them a brief while. Sherry also looks for work; she wants to work with kids and she's prepared to do whatever it takes--including romantic favors to a total stranger and countless promises to her parole officer Mr. Hernandez (Giancarlo Esposito) that she'll avoid drugs and be good with the kids.

Unfortunately, however, the tension only mounts and other reviewers are right to note that life on the outside is somewhat like a prison in that there are so many social barriers and law enforcement restrictions that could cause trouble for Sherry. Ultimately, Bobby and Lynette throw Sherry out although they pay for her motel room; they just can't deal with her. They themselves cause part of the trouble by telling Sherry's daughter Alexis to call her Sherry instead of ""mommy."" Ouch! Sherry's father also does his share of damage, too.

Of course the plot can go anywhere from here. Will Sherry be able to bond with her daughter Alexis and her other family members once again? What about Sherry's job working with kids--how will that play out? Will Sherry be able to stay clean? No plot spoilers here, folks--watch and find out!

The DVD has the theatrical trailer; I wish we had some commentary or an interview or two but we don't get any of that. That's a disappointment. I'll take off half a star for that!

SherryBaby does an excellent job of portraying the struggles of a woman who desperately wants to reenter society after being in jail for drug possession and robbery. The movie shows us that this is far from easy; people in Sherry's position aren't truly free at all even after they are released from jail. They have their personal problems in addition to social barriers and responsibilities to law enforcement officers who may have to monitor them. I highly recommend this film for people interested in these issues. Indeed, anyone who wants a film about life with gritty realism and excellent acting would do well to add this DVD to their collection.",1244505600,6,3621,4.9457236842105265

My negative feelings result from the hopelessness of her life and the only likeable character being her brother, and that took a while to develope. I was concerned why her patrol officer gave her so many breaks in the beginning that lead to her down fall. Did her father always molest her and did that lead to her inevitable down fall? Her use of her body to get a job, housing and drugs tells of the perpetual downward spiro. This along with her inability to resist re-addition tells the terrible tale all should heed. VERY GOOD movie but not a cheerful one and not even a good cry, just an over all feeling of depression. Its message is simply about the hopelessness of drugs and sex that leads to an attitude and conduct she does not really see, that would continue to drag her down.",1239494400,2,940,4.529411764705882
2669472,5,B000JBXXYK,"Easily Maggie Gyllenhaal's best movie to date.  If you saw her in Secretary and were fascinated by the twisted sexuality you should definitely see her in Sherrybaby. She has such a natural style and is so immersed in the role you will not believe she is acting but just being herself.

Please read the other reviews if you want the details of the plot.

The purpose of this review is to tell you that this movie is visually rich and features Maggie Gyllenhaal's perfect legs and thin but shapely body and perfectly natural and very enticing breasts in almost every scene.  She wears tight fitting tops with no bra, mini skirts, short-shorts and has many nude scenes. Some of the scenes are gritty and dirty while others are passionate and show her soft side.

I got this movie expecting a few shots of her long legs and was pleasantly surprised to find it was full length tribute to her very natural and uninhibited sexuality. Did I tell you she has a beautiful body??  In one scene she even wears a see through thong and nothing is left to the imagination.

Get this movie if you are a Maggie Gyllenhaal fan. If you haven't seen any of her previous work you will be a fan after seeing this movie.

Acting was excellent!
The script and the flow definitely was lacking.
Subject matter is important to address and the movie made good points, but again, certainly lacked in content.
I would have liked to have known it was as sexually graphic as it is.

While she was incarcerated, her brother and his wife help take care of her young daughter and are more or less like parents to her.  The story focuses on Sherry changing her life so that she can be a mother to her daughter.  Later in the film we see that Sherry is far from recovered... she relapses and she continues to make bad decisions.

It seemed a little cruel with how Sherry's brother and his wife told the child to call her mother ""Sherry"" instead of mom, but what happens later in the film makes it all the more understandable.  We see that Sherry is mostly a child herself emotionally and came from a dysfunctional environment where she had been molested by her father.

The film was sad, but these kinds of stories are played out everyday in real life.",1222214400,,845,4.419354838709677
2669475,4,B000JBXXYK,"The intelligent, engaging ""Sherrybaby"" probably reveals more about the people who watch it than it ultimately does about its own characters.  As seen in many of these reviews, some viewers will empathize with Sherry, feeling bad that her kid is essentially being taken from her by her brother and his wife.  Others will recognize and appreciate the sacrifice Sherry's brother and his wife are doing in raising a little girl who'd otherwise be subject to an unstable mother.

I related to both views.  Sherry has a good heart and is a strong woman in many ways, but she's in a damaged emotional state that makes it all too easy for her to weaken and turn again to drugs.  Sherry's brother Bobby and his wife just want Sherry's daughter to have a decent upbringing, but they can often be needlessly insensitive when discussing the little girl with her mother.  In other words, these characters are genuinely complex and make for an interesting, thoughtful film.  But you'll have to be open to a film that doesn't offer easy answers.

Myself, I saw a ray of hope at the end for these characters' futures.  In the unlikely event that there's a ""Sherrybaby II"" (for better or worse, small, interesting art house movies generally don't get sequels), I like to think that we'd see that these characters had eventually reached a situation or accommodation among themselves where everyone has gained a little peace and a sense of being fairly treated.

""Sherrybaby"" features an anamorphic widescreen image that looks great on a flatscreen TV, and the movie sounds great, too.  There are no extras to speak of, except for a trailer that goes a little over-the-top in its praise of Maggie Gyllenhaal's admittedly excellent portrayal: the trailer actually uses the phrase ""Oscar bait!"" like those classic movie-parody skits on the old SCTV show.  But don't let a few goofy moments in the trailer put you off.  ""Sherrybaby"" is definitely worth a look.",1221436800,,1938,4.889908256880734
2669476,4,B000JBXXYK,"This was a fascinating movie, with a first-rate performance by actress Maggie Gyllenhaal as an ex-con on parole, a woman trying to pick up the pieces of her life, including a daughter who has been raised in her absence by her brother and sister-in-law.

The beauty of this movie is in the subtle and greatly understated moments.  One scene in particular - during the reunion between Sherry and her father, has little dialogue, but watch the way she tries to get his attention; it's sad and disturbing.  The viewer sees the entire reason why Sherry turned into an ex-con and a drug addict, in one moment.

The story itself is very emotional and thought-provoking.  Sherry rolls into her daughter's life after being in prison.  In her absence, her daughter was raised by her brother and his wife, and instead of being grateful, Sherry is angry and belligerent.  The stark realism of the movie tells a sad and painful truth - most of the time, in real life, this is exactly the way things happen.

I really enjoyed this movie, even though watching it was a painful and emotionally draining experience.  Rarely does a film have the ability to leave you a changed person, even in a small way, or provide some kind of mirror into the demons lurking inside your own soul.

Her daughter is living with her brother Bobby and his wife and Sherry wants to do right for her daughter but obstacles and old habits creep back up again.

Once she's released, she contacts her brother, Bobby, who has been keeping her child (Alexis) for her while she's been in the clink. The movie then follows Sherry as she tries to stay clean and put her life back together post-prison.

Gyllenhaal is AMAZING in this film. Really amazing. (I am a fan since The Secretary, but this cements it.) If anyone has any doubts as to whether she can act, this should answer them. The storyline is a downer, though, as nothing seems to go right for Sherry. The tension between her and her brother over the fate of the child, the vestiges of an abusive relationship with her father, her struggles with addiction, her desperate need to be loved - it all adds up to rather morose entertainment.

But it is charged with meaning and blessed with good performances, making it worth seeing in my book. FYI - there is LOTS of language and nudity.",1198886400,3,1134,4.693467336683417
2669479,2,B000JBXXYK,"After seeing this movie uncut on cable, while I am a big fan of Maggie, and while her performance is second to none, overall, this is one of her films I'd rather not see a second time, so I couldn't honestly advise anyone to buy this DVD without checking it out first.  It's a film I'm glad I saw at least once since I am a Maggie fan, but it is really a totally depressing experience on a number of levels throughout, the script needed major rewrites, especially as to believability issues, the ending is all wrong and contradicts the whole movie, and there really was no call to more or less exploit Maggie's beauty here in needlessly graphic sexual encounters and nudity, in way too many such scenes.  She agreed to such to make the film, I suppose, so who am I to judge?  Still, her acting talents are enough to do without the ""soft-porn"" and those several segments only detract from the viewer's finding of some empathy and understanding of her character.

The movie, one of many Gyllenhaal has been in these days, is compelling enough to sway one from fast forwarding, but aside from the excessive nudity/sex, there are just too many negatives here for me to imagine anyone actually wanting to repeatedly watch this, let alone buy the DVD which has few extras and seems not to have even put in closed-captions, which is unacceptable in these days.

Gyllenhaal's character is interesting, but it's never really background, explained enough with her story starting somewhere in the middle and never really explores the roots of same, except for too subtle and brief references throughout the film, none of which add much to the overall experience.  There are too many unanswered questions all along the way, which could've been easily incorporated into the mix with perhaps some flashback sequences, or at the very least, more exposition which would make our understanding and sympathy for who we're apparently supposed to be pulling for, Sherrybaby, much more rewarding.  An off-screen narration could've easily solved this problem as well, but such is nowhere to be found.

On one hand, we are asked to identify with Sherry, and her state of mind, but her behavior contradicts her deepest held wishes, and there are just too many unbelievable characters and situations surrounding her, to make the whole into something the viewer can identify with.  Until the very end, which seems tacked on as a shallow ""happy ending"" but which comes out of nowhere (maybe they ran out of film or the production company out of money to give this a decent finish), Sherry is not only not likeable, but is obviously living in some selfish, drug/alcohol fantasyland, which only serves to hurt her young daughter, even moreso than she already has when we meet up with her.  While the movie deals with her attempted reconciliation and reconnection with her ""baby,"" aside from the little girl's equally powerful performance, surrounding characters all seem quite unlikely and undeveloped, and for a film which attempts to be a slice of ""real"" life, perhaps the makers of this should've spent a little more time developing those ""supporting"" characters.  For most, if not all of them, are dealt short shift here in the writing, and eventually detract from the film's seeming potentials.

Hints are given along the way which suggest that Sherry's childhood and early adult experiences led and lead to her self-destructive nature, but it would've been nice to see a more believable and detailed explanation.  This would've obviously necessitated less Maggie screen time, and more from her supporting cast, and made less of her amazing performance, but in this case, it is really needed.  By the end of this movie, which presented some sort of revelation in Maggie's character, both inner and behavior-wise, for the good, it felt unrealistic and was most unsatisfying.

I can't help but to think that this would've been so much better with at least just a little bit less sex and nudity, and at least just a little bit more of basic character development.  The film asks us to identify with Sherrybaby but mostly, she is a mess even after being released from prison for silly drug ""law"" reasons, and her prayerful longing to just reconnect with her most loved thing in life, her daughter, would've never happened in the real world we live in.  Let alone the fictional world this film portrays.

Any movie in this genre primarily demands as its first and foremost tenet, that we CARE about the main character we're SUPPOSED to care about, but Gyllenhaal's ""Sherry"" never comes close to that.  By the film's soapy, sappy end, that needed quality never really materialized.  At least, this viewer didn't care at the finish whether she ever got close to her daughter or not.  In fact, all I came away from it with was the feeling that she was an unfit ""mommy"" from giving birth to way beyond the phony ending.  All I could empathize with were her psychologically abused daughter, and her brother and his wife, and I would've liked to see a more ""tough love"" solution, and a restraining order till Sherry ever got her act together.

Maggie Gyllenhaal is a great actress, and her performance is superb, but she needs to concentrate more on selecting better material, and quality over quantity in the projects she agrees to in the future.  The excessive sex and nudity was also and remains beneath her plain old acting talents at this stage in her career.  Her genuine beauty and amazing ability to brilliantly capture the essence of any character she's ever played, should be enough by now (and hopefully in the future), to garner less exploitive roles, where she doesn't seem to need to shed her clothes without necessity, several times in a film, where doing such seems to eventually damage her overall talents and prospects for better films.  As well as subtract from the audience's feeling of empathy and compassion for whatever character she's playing.  Especially such as Sherrybaby.

I didn't like ""Sherry"" from beginning to end, and I find it hard to believe anyone would, given the weak material and her character's past and present abuse of her supposedly loved child.  Again, this would've been a lot better with a lot of rewrites and more careful thought about audience identification as a driving force in overall believability and enjoyment of a film that is just too much of a downer for me to ever recommend actually buying this for anyone except a Maggie Gyllenhaal collector.",1191110400,3,6468,4.865209471766849

Rarely have I seen a performer more completely inhabit a role than Maggie Gyllenhaal does in ""Sherrybaby,"" an exquisitely realized drama that hits nary a single false note en route to its heartrending climax.

Sherry Swanson is a recovering heroin addict who has, as she herself puts it, ""made all the wrong choices in life.""  Now out on parole and living in a halfway house in Northern New Jersey, Sherry finally has the chance to make things right both in her own life and with the young daughter she was forced to give up to her brother and sister-in-law when she went into rehab and prison.  Sherry is a survivor, but one whose hold on life is often a precarious and tenuous one even at the best of times - and these are clearly not the best of times.

The beautiful thing about ""Sherrybaby"" is how, in her first full-length fictional film, writer/director Laurie Collyer allows the drama to unfold naturally, never pushing the material in any particular direction just to make a point.  Indeed, there is nothing forced or contrived about the narrative at all.  Displaying remarkable confidence as both a filmmaker and a storyteller - and evincing a strong feeling for the rhythms of everyday life - Collyer never allows the movie to slip over into the realm of melodrama despite endless opportunities to do so.  As a director, she's smart enough to know what a great thing she has in Gyllenhaal, and thus she allows the actress full rein in developing the character.  Every action, every movement, every facial expression on the part of the actress feels absolutely authentic to the person Sherry is.  Like any living, breathing, fully developed character, Sherry is a walking mass of contradictions.  Feisty, hardnosed and quick-to-anger as she can be at times, she also possesses a tenderness and vulnerability that make us believe she can truly change.  And Gyllenhaal captures all those moods and contradictions perfectly without ever once veering into overstatement or scenery-chewing histrionics.

Although I don't think Gyllenhaal is ever off the screen for a single moment in the film, her tour de force performance is not the only one worth taking note of here.  There is also exceptional work by Brad William Henke, Bridget Barkin, Danny Trejo, Sam Bottoms, Giancarlo Esposito, and, above all, Ryan Simpkins, who, at the tender age of seven, is already a powerhouse of acting talent as Sherry's beloved daughter, Alexis.

Naturalism in both performance and atmosphere is what makes ""Sherrybaby"" such a compelling and convincing movie-watching experience.  The film has the rare power to draw viewers into its own private world and to make them an integral part of the characters' lives.

""Sherrybaby,"" in addition to being one of the best movies of 2006 in its own right, will be forever remembered as a showcase for one of the finest pieces of acting ever put on the screen.",1187395200,3,2899,4.932098765432099

I found several of these scene distasteful.  Meanwhile Sherry is trying to reconcile with her daughter after being away in prison.  Her daughter is now living with Maggies brother and his wife.

2669486,4,B000JBXXYK,"Laurie Collyer's Sherrybaby presents the bleak picture of a woman just released from prison trying to reconnect with her life, her family, and most importantly with the child she left behind.

Maggie Gyllenhaal gives the performance of her career as the title character who is caught in a life spinning out of control. Fighting her own demons and addictions she must come face to face with her past in order to reclaim her present. The film features stand out performances by Brad William Henke as her brother Bobby, Giancarlo Esposito as her parole officer, Danny Trejo as Dean Walker, the man trying to get into her life and a surprisingly good performance by Ryan Simkins as her daughter Alexis. Despite all these performances the film is dominated by the work of Gyllenhaal. She appears in literally every seen and is fearless in her determination to get the part right.

The disc does not offer any special features but does include a 5.1 soundtrack. The cinematography by Russell Lee Fine perfectly shows off the New Jersey landscapes that make up Sherry Swanson's life. First time director Collyer deserves kudos for her work also.

This small gem was one of the sleepers of 2006 and should not be missed.",1185148800,3,1212,4.845410628019324
2669489,3,B000JBXXYK,"sherrybaby is from the start until the end a great movie.. it's unfortunate that the ending destroys everything the movie worked so hard to attain.

it's about a woman (maggie gyllenhaal) who gets out of rehab and tries to get her life back on track, easier said than done because she lets her little girl stay with her brother and his wife, and they emotionally kidnap her and treat maggie gyllenhaal like far less than human because she used to use drugs.  this is masterfully portrayed by the actors, particularly gyllenhaal.  throughout the movie, something is accomplished which i've never seen in a movie - total cynicism about society.  the srangers gyllenhaal meets are mean to her, but the meanest of all are the ones she considers her friends.  one scene even shows that her own father used to molest her.  this is great, dark subject matter that makes for a wonderful movie.

but then in the end... well i won't say exactly what happens but basically all the darkness is erased and you're supposed to believe gyllenhaal's character is going to be A-OK just because she has a positive attitude - the exact opposite of the rest of the movie!!!!!  ridiculous and terrible.",1181088000,3,1180,4.75

In Sherrybaby, Maggie proves that she's an actress who's not afraid to take risks and in this case come up a winner.  To the point that no one in the supporting cast can touch her.  She dominates her scenes with a realistic honesty that you can only admire.  My ONLY complaint is the films pacing.  When filmmakers opt to tackle dreary subject matters, I think it's important to periodically give your audience some breaks so at the end of the movie your audience isn't jonsesing for Prozac for a pick me up.  Overall, it's a good character piece and a great proformance from Maggie Gyllenhaal.",1178582400,2,728,4.6484375

2669494,5,B000JBXXYK,"She is what she is.  She is not able to restrain herself.  She needs gratification.  She can't postpone it.  She succumbs to whatever it is, sex, heroin, alcohol, nicotine...love.  She is impulsive and she flies off the handle easily.  She doesn't know that she behaves badly.  She doesn't know that is not the way to dress.  Or perhaps she does.  She needs to be gratified, and so probably that is why she dresses that way.

She was sexually abused by her father who loved her.  But who does she love?  She desperately wants her daughter to love her.  Do you love me? she asks.  Say, ""I love you, Mommie.""  The child does, but suddenly--and this is the denouement of the movie--Sherry realizes that there is some question about whether the child should love her.  Yes, she has the stretch marks, but really does she deserve the title of ""mother""?  And does she love herself?  Probably not, and maybe that is her biggest problem.  It is said that women who are always seeking sex are really seeking a love that they cannot find.  One always feels that if only they would pick the right man.  But this is an illusion.  There is no right man until she is the right woman.

Maggie Gyllenhaal does an outstanding job of becoming this woman who is lost in this world without a compass as to how she should behave and why, who is lost to everything but her immediate feelings.  She is a child emotionally and she cannot understand why it is that life is so hard for her and why the world is so cruel.

This is a masterful portrait of a kind of person that is part of humanity.  A good person at heart, not someone who would do others deliberate harm, but a person who is blind to who she is and to how others see her.  Into what world does she belong? is a question I kept asking myself.  I don't know the answer.

Laurie Collyer's direction is exquisite.  The players and especially the little girl are wonderfully directed.  Everything is like the people next door without a hint of anything phony.  The contemporary Garden State setting is real and the details and the atmosphere are as genuine as the New Jersey Turnpike.  And the ending surprises.  It is perfect but in a way that I suspect most viewers will not be able to predict.  I know it surprised me.

My hat is off to Laurie Collyer and Maggie Gyllenhaal.  Thank you for this modest little masterpiece and for not compromising reality or putting in any unnecessary fig leaves or giving in to any notions of political correctness.  This is just a pure slice of life movie with a beginning, a middle and an end, beautifully realized.  And yes it is rated R.",1177977600,9,2612,4.441860465116279
2669495,5,B000JBXXYK,"Sherrybaby is the story about starting life over when you've hit rock bottom.  Maggie Gyllenhaal plays Sherry, a 22 year-old ex-junkie on parole with a sincere desire to turn her life around and regain custody of her 5 year-old daughter.  While Sherry was in jail, her daughter lived with Sherry's brother and his wife, and the sister-in-law now has an iron resolve about keeping the child and not returning her to the flaky ex-con mother.

Actor Maggie Gyllenhaal expertly captures the spirit of a woman who desires change, and desperately wants to be a mother, but for whom motherhood and stability do not come naturally.  The climax of the move features her attempt on a day on the town with her daughter, a disaster of a day despite all of Sherry's best efforts.  Throughout the movie, Sherry battles addiction, past demons, and the hard luck reality that not many employers or professionals want to take a chance on an ex-con.  Since she's known nothing else, Sherry often turns to using her body to get what she wants in the ""real world.""

Gyllenhall's outstanding performance is complimented by that of Danny Trejo as a tough, tattoo-ed recovering addict who provides Sherry with stability and wisdom.  Actor Trejo's appearance is that of an ex-con (which he is in real life) tough guy who knows a bit about how the world works, but in this role, he plays a spiritual man with a soft, kind resolve under his tough exterior.  His character is a guardian angel in an unlikely disguise.

Sherrybaby proves once again that Maggie Gyllenhaal is one of the most outstanding actors of her generation, and gives Trejo a chance to shine in a leading role.  I look forward to following the careers of these terrific actors.",1177804800,3,1720,4.777027027027027

Its more depressing than inspirational. Don't let the box kid you, this is every bit the kind of movie which begins as a writer/director/actor's labor of love. You cannot really say like or love with a movie like this. Liking or loving a movie like this might just be a little sick, because the part of you which is emotional and heartfelt cannot like to see a character go through the life experiences that Sherry (Gyllenhaal) encounters, and the part of you which is rational and intelligent, knows this is basically a pretty accurate adaptation.

WHY I WOULD RENT IT AGAIN

If you have the choice between Sherrybaby or Half Nelson, please, please pick Sherrybaby. It's wrought with grief, spirit, hopelessness and realism. I heard a fantastic interview with Gyllenhaal on an NPR program about this movie and it causing her disdain for sex scenes. After watching it, I knew exactly why she made that comment. The character of Sherry reminded me to be thankful for an ubernormal childhood, and what is turning out to be, a pretty good time as an adult.",1177200000,,1084,4.724867724867725
2669498,4,B000JBXXYK,"Maggie Gyllenhaal turns in a breath-taking performance as a young mother, just out of prison, with little going for her but a desire to be reunited with her young daughter. A recovering drug user, her life is barely on the upswing after hitting bottom, and it's clear that getting a life on track that maybe never was will be a long uphill battle. A diffident brother, a prickly sister-in-law, and a sleazy father make up the dysfunctional family who half-heartedly support her, and her daughter is confused and fearful. Meanwhile, a humorless parole officer and a male friend from a 12-step group provide the sole sources of stability in her life.

This is a story that has been told before, and like a similar film, ""Down to the Bone,"" it is told without sentimentality or false hope. While each film ends after its heroine has pulled through a personal crisis, one is left with the very real prospect that further trials and ordeals lie ahead. Hardly any scene in this film allows the tension in its dramatic situations to relax. Even moments of release are filmed and cut in an edgy way that portends disaster. The supporting performances, especially Brad William Henke as the long-suffering brother, are strong and compelling. Ebert and Roeper rightly gave this film two thumbs up.

2669499,3,B000JBXXYK,"Sherrybaby is the story of Sherry Swanson (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a woman recently out of prison and on strict parole. Her brother and his wife have spent the last three years taking care of her daughter, and she desperately wants to be a part of her daughter's life again. Sherry, though, doesn't seem to have ever learned social graces, and this extends not only to offering favors to the director of her halfway house, but also in her explanation to her five-year-old daughter as to why she was gone so long. She tells her daughter, rather inappropriately, that she stole money from people to buy drugs.

When we meet Sherry's alcoholic father, we understand her inability to cope, although it's not terribly surprising. What surprised me was that we learned that her brother was aware of whatever relationship the two of them had and didn't talk to Sherry about it. That's certainly not unbelievable, as it's not uncommon for people to ignore the elephant in the room, but it's frustrating.

Gyllenhaal's performance was strong, but everyone else turned in rote performances with little or no emotional depth.

This DVD did not come with captions or subtitles, so this reviewer, who is hearing impaired, had difficulty following all of the dialogue. In 2007, there shouldn't be a DVD on the market that doesn't have captions or subtitles.",1176249600,9,1339,4.942222222222222
2669500,3,B000JBXXYK,"Looking at the accolades on the DVD box, I am going to

have to take a minority view here and go with 3 stars,

a lukewarm recommendation with some cautionary thoughts.

Yes, the acting is first rate.  The film is not boring

and it is certainly well paced.

But as I watched this film, I had two big reservations.

First, it is relentlessly depressing.  What little sign

of ""hope"" there is for Sherry at the end is very little

and pretty late considering the completely messed up

person she is.  I did not see anything in her post release

behavior to indicate a genuine desire to reform.  Indeed,

her use of sex to get what she wants shows just how she still

wants the quick fix to everything.  She goes back to drugs

and drinking pretty quickly.  She has anger management issues,

impulse control problems, and a sick need to be the center of

attention.  Put bluntly, I did not see anything here to suggest

that she was anywhere near being in a position to deserve to be

part of her daughter's life.  (Despite what events may have

led her down her path.)

Second, this film seemed really fast and loose with

what I would think is acceptable reality.

1. Within days of her release she engages in sex acts with

the manager of her halfway house and a rather lecherous job

placement officer.  It seems more than a little unlikely that

she would meet TWO men who would risk their jobs (and health)

to have sexual relations with this woman.

2. As a convicted felon, I do not think she would have been

eligible for any position working with children.

3. I think her interaction with the parole department is not

very believable.  Either she would have, as a low level threat,

been ""lost in the system"" or she would have been violated and

sent back to jail for her numerous transgressions (fighting in

the halfway house, moving around without permission, drugs, etc).

4. As a convicted felon and single parent, she would almost

certainly have lost custody of her child and minimally, I would

expect DYFS to have an interest in her interaction with the child

after her parole.

The film left me with the impression her family had little or

no contact with her during her incarceration.  And now that she

is out, they wish she would just go away.

This film is a work of fiction, but I bet there are many families

who face a very similar situation in real life.  For those people,

watching this film would probably be torture.

For the rest of the world, an okay film, not very uplifting, and

I believe just a little too unrealistic in portraying the world

Sherry would encounter.

One other side note.  I thought it was interesting that the DVD

includes no special features aside from the movie trailer.  As more

and more films come with all kinds of commentary, how the movie

was made, and other special features, it is interesting to see

a film released and just left to stand on its own.",1176076800,3,2921,4.496153846153846
2669501,4,B000JBXXYK,"Maggie Gyllenhaal played her part to perfection, scarily so.  She's the perfect sociopath, only thinking of herself while using her daughter, as well as anyone else she encounters, as a foil.  She's a master manipulator and feels no remorse for using anyone unlucky enough to cross her path.

2669502,4,B000JBXXYK,Maggie Gyllenhaal is great in this movie.  She plays a down and out single mother trying to earn her place in her child's life.  This movie brings you into Sherry's life and breaks your heart along the way.,1174435200,,206,4.394736842105263
2669503,4,B000JBXXYK,"Unflinchingly absorbing from the first scene to the last, Maggie Gyllenhaal brings a candid, earthy aura to ""Sherrybaby,"" her most impressive acting vehicle up to this point. New to DVD, this gut-wrenching look at an ex-convict's struggle to establish control over her life truly sizzles.

Any doubt of Gyllenhaal's abilities is erased only minutes into the film. At the drop of a hat, she makes Sherry Swanson turn from sexual to vulnerable, violent to passive, indifferent to invested, self-assured to insecure. Through it all, she is endearing enough to win over even the most ignorant viewers - the kind who shield their eyes when real-life Sherrys pass them on the street.

When we first meet her, she saunters off the bus in Newark, finally home after three years in prison. Contrasting with the business suits that surround her skimpy strawberry blonde get-up, she hollers after a man merely for brushing against her in a hurry to cross the street; the unfolding of a misfit begins.

Parole Officer Hernandez is played by the ever-brilliant Giancarlo Esposito, who has a knack for playing deceivingly straightforward authority figures. Appropriately hard-headed in his treatment of Sherry yet sympathetic to her misfortune, his character provides a three-dimensional look at the work of those who look after prisoners post-incarceration.

Sherry's heart-rending yet uneasy reunion with her tiny daughter Alexis, portrayed by Ryan Simpkins, sets the stage for the crux of the plot. Having been raised during her mother's incarceration by Sherry's brother Bobby and his wife Lynette, played by Brad William Henke and Bridget Barkan, Alexis is thrown a curveball when her mother suddenly arrives. With an ability to act natural on screen, Simpkins makes Alexis a fully realized character despite her extreme youth, underscoring key plot elements with a pure, uncensored nature par for the course in young children.

Fully intent on being a better mother, Sherry collides with her brother and sister-in-law, who closely regulate her interactions with Alexis out of legitimate concern. When she realizes they have instructed Alexis to address her not as ""mommy"" but as simply Sherry, tremendous tension ensues, finally ballooning out of control. Sensing the tension between the three adults, the toddler breaks down in tears, unsure of her position at an age when it is all she has to rely on. The juxtaposition of Sherry's urban life with her family's quiet existence in suburban Mountainside underscores their inevitable differences.

Dominant male figures are perhaps overly important to Sherry's definition of herself. Her relationship with her father, wisely underplayed by Sam Bottoms, is more pivotal than first meets the eye, providing context for her conflicted past. She also develops a relationship with recovered addict Dean, played by Danny Trejo, who becomes an unlikely anchor with his wizened, world-weary outlook.

It's easy to dismiss Sherry as someone who is raunchy and immoral, but an attentive viewing reveals the reasons behind her complexities. Gyllenhaal draws her character like an artist draws a painting, giving her depth and dimension that takes the viewer deeper and deeper in as the plot progresses. To call her a fearless actress would be an understatement.

Gyllenhaal fronts a top-notch cast in this gritty, unglamorous slice of life. For powerful acting, an engrossing story and wall-to-wall on-location shots of New Jersey to boot, ""Sherrybaby"" delivers the goods hand over fist.",1173830400,85,3517,5.3471971066907775

Gyllenhaal as Sherry is a virtual time bomb to watch ,You never know when or if she is going to go off the deep end.

Her intentions are good but she just cant seem to get it together,with scenes  of her father groping her breasts while he consoles her and her acting like its an everyday normal occurrence to scenes of her being very sexually promiscuous without a fore or after thought about the consequences' in her mind that's what women do to get a reward or to be loved .

It can be heart breaking at times but sometimes you want  to shake her and say NO~!! This is not how it works..

Gyllenhaal is definitely Oscar worthy in this role and was snubbed by the academy as she was in ""Secretary ""

Sherry is frustrated because her brother and sister-in-law have become parental figures in her daughter's life. Sherry's daughter shies away from her mother. Although Sherry is deeply flawed, I think most viewers will root for her. Gyllenhaal brings her characteristic charm and humor to the role, even as her character faces dark circumstances.

SHERRYBABY has garnered accolades from the general public and professional critics alike. And although Maggie Gyllenhaal's (WORLD TRADE CENTER) performance as an embittered, used-up druggie just released from prison is well-rendered, the story, as a whole, wasn't completely entertaining nor cohesive.

We first meet Sherry Swanson as she walks down the street after being released from jail. She journey's to a half-way house for recent parolees and rents a room. Her goal, though, is to reconnect with her estranged four-year-old daughter, Alexis (Ryan Simpkins), who lives with Sherry's brother Bobby (Brad William Henke, NORTH COUNTRY) and protective wife Lynette (Bridget Barkan). Bobby and Lynette have taken on the mantle of parents to Alexis, and although Bobby is willing to let Sherry get close to Alexis, Lynette is anything but willing. This obviously angers Sherry and conflicts with her desire to be a good, close mother.

Added to this stressor is Sherry's physical desire for male companionship and the heroin she used to use. She tries to stay on the straight-and-narrow but soon falls back into her old lifestyle.

Battling her motherly bond along with a history of incestuous abuse by her father, Sherry has so much on her plate that it overwhelms her, causing her to make bad choices.

The culmination of these poor judgements presents itself when she tries to abscond with Alexis and crosses state lines (a huge parole violation). But can she understand what's happening to her? Can she make the connection between her own poor upbringing and that of her daughter's uncertain future? This comes to fruition in a public bathroom where Sherry loses her cool and frightens Alexis to the point of incontinence.

In the end, Sherry does the right thing and returns Alexis to the safety of Bobby and Lynette's home. But at what cost to herself? What will happen to Sherry now that she's given over much of her parental and motherly duties to her brother and sister-in-law?

This is where the biggest script concern lay for Sherrybaby. The resolution is too loose, only showing us Sherry driving away from Bobby and Lynette's home with no understanding as to what will happen to her and Alexis.

Nothing should be taken away from Gyllenhaal's performance, though. She is the shining star in this otherwise mundane story. And it is her, and only her, that will keep you watching the film.",1171411200,4,2426,5.077889447236181

She brings this train-wreck of a woman to vivid life, totally disappearing into the character. Many have described this film as sad, bleak, and disturbing. It is all of these things because the story seems so authentic and real, and her performance is so good. She seems like a real person rather than an actress playing a role: everyone has met someone like Sherry. I believe this is a much better film than some of the reviews here would suggest. So many films today are fluffy, forgettable and emotionally unengaging. This one is strong medicine: it grabs you and pulls you in. My wife liked it a lot, but actually had trouble sleeping after watching it. Since when do all movies have to be syrupy, feel-good confections with an unambiguous happy ending?

2669532,4,B000JBXXYK,"The role of the ""bad girl"" has been very, very good to young actresses lately--just think of Julia Roberts (""Erin Brockavich""), Charlize Theron (""Monster""), Angelina Jolie (""Girl, Interrupted"") to name a few that have won Oscar accolades by going blonde and tough.

Now, it's Maggie Gyllenhaal's turn, and she doesn't disappoint at all.  In the first role where she is asked to carry an entire movie, Maggie displays impressive acting chops...( and nice gams, too.)

Sherry Swanson (Gyllenhaal) is first seen as she returns to her hometown area, on parole from prison.  She is a dirty sweet, tough-on-the-outside girl who flaunts a cool, but thin veneer of confidence.  She also smokes cigarettes with more moxie than any movie blonde since Gena Rowlands.  As she checks into the halfway house, she takes no guff from the girls, and immediately begins using her sexuality on men to get what she wants. Her single-minded goal is to reunite with her very young daughter, Lexie,and  take custody of her again.  To do that, she has to fight through the barrier of her brother and his wife, who have cared for Lexie while Sherry was in prison.

When she finally reaches her brother Bobby's home, Gyllenhaal's character begins to reveal her true self.  Her look, which before was predominantly one of blankness, dissolves into expressions of repressed anger, sadness, and need.  Gyllenhaal's expressive face registers every emotional state without having to resort to overacting.

When her father arrives at Bobby's house, Sherry shows that beneath it all, she is more of a needy child than Lexie.  Later on, the reasons for her arrested development are made obvious, when her father comforts her in a very inappropriate manner.  As Sherry undergoes a transition from blonde to brunette, her facade of toughness begins to dissolve.  Sherry begins to crumble.  In the end, she finally admits that she's not ready to raise her daughter, and belatedly acknowledges her brother's role as caretaker.

Maggie Gyllenhaal's expertly shaded performance is the primary reason to see this movie.  But, beyond that the movie doesn't have that many strong points. It is good at showing the way that social workers interact with offenders--sometimes with toughness, sometimes with a coziness that borders on impropriety.

""Sherrybaby"" is a movie with limited ambitions.  It amounts to a good, but not great ""Indie"".  The musical score seems so ""Indie-fied"" that it is really kind of annoying, and the denouement of the story is a bit pat.

Most importantly, Maggie Gyllenhaal here has made an announcement that she is an actor to be reckoned with.",1171065600,5,2627,5.088785046728972
2669533,3,B000JBXXYK,This is a depressing film about a single mother sort of trying to get better. The only reason for the 3 stars is Maggie Gyllenhaal who is superb.,1170892800,,145,4.214285714285714
2669534,5,B000JBXXYK,"I'll start with a warning: ""Sherrybaby"" is a very downbeat, gloomy movie.  Sherry Swanson, played brilliantly by Maggie Gyllenhaal, has had a very depressing life and the movie's bare-bones look at her attempts to reform and become a good mother to her daughter hits some abysmal lows in the way she continues to be degraded by the harsh judgments of the world and, predominantly, herself.  It's just not a feel good movie, so anyone looking for frivolity or endless repeat viewing had best look elsewhere.

Now, having gotten that out of the way, I want to implore you to watch ""Sherrybaby"" anyway, because while the movie isn't bouncy fun it is an unflinchingly honest and devastating portrait of a young woman in crisis.  Sherry makes some bad choices, sure, but thanks to Gyllenhaal you see the extent of the damage that has been done to her, and you find yourself on the edge of your seat because you desperately want her to be all right in the end.  To say that Sherry's life hasn't gone according to plan would be an egregious understatement.  By sixteen she was performing for seedy older men for money under the moniker 'Lolita,' hooked on heroin, and it is implied that she was sexually molested by her father.  Most of her old acquaintances are either dead of overdoses or in jail, and she has no idea where her daughter's father is -- assuming he's still alive, that is.  In Gyllenhaal's blank stare you can feel every wound and imagine every dream that has been dashed forever in Sherry's bleak existence, and in her prematurely world-weary creases the fear that she will never get the normal life she so desperately craves becomes palpable.  It is a performance that is at once bold and understated, and the fact that Gyllenhaal failed to get nominated for an Academy Award seems to be the final nail in the coffin of that institution's ability to reward such daring indie performances as this one.  It's a triumph so lived-in that you can almost smell the stale aroma of cigarettes following around her.  The supporting players are also very good, but this is Gyllenhaal's vehicle, and it is her work that makes the film work so well.

And what a film!  Sherry's fumbling attempts at motherhood and sobriety don't tug at your heartstrings so much as rip them out and scrape them across the floor, but rarely does that experience feel so exhilarating as it does here.  ""Sherrybaby"" is not a movie for the faint of heart, but it is a movie for anyone who has a heart -- and it will stay with you long after the final reel.  How many movies can you honestly say that about?",1170633600,12,2585,4.62582056892779
2669535,4,B000JBXXYK,"Out of prison, clean at last, Sherry Swanson (Maggie Gyllenhaal) dreams of being a mother to daughter Alexis, who has spent the last three years with her brother and sister-in-law. Sherry was arrested on drug possession charges, her drug of choice being heroine.  Now she confronts her demons in the form of family....sister-in-law Lynnette has bonded with the young girl, and has postponed her own family to raise her.  How can Lynnette reconcile giving up her care to the fragile, emotionally shattered Sherry?

Moving from man to man and trying to erase her memories of life with her own father, Sherry is a selfish and childish shell of what she might have been, who can only relate to men on the basis of her sexuality.  She couples with the manager of a half-way house, finds a troubled partner from her days as a stripper, and tries to seduce her parole officer (Giancarlo Esposito in a wonderfully understated role on the big screen...you remember his intensity from television's ""Homicide"").  A meeting with her father results in a reinforcement of this childlike behavior.  The film is a frank and seamless report of Sherry's encounters with life, bouncing off the bad times without learning from them and continuing on in a subtle dance of drifting from place to place, of living with life without coping or facing down your own issues.

The encounters that Sherry wants the most, the times she gets to be with Alexis, don't go well; Alexis is uncomfortable, a little defiant, afraid.  As Sherry begins to realize that what she hoped for, what she left her addiction for, what she focused on in prison...the relationship with her daughter is almost impossible to repair, she begins the slow spiral downhill of giving up on herself.  Cheap and brassy, surrounded by a gritty, realistic portrayal of the surroundings of the worst of New Jersey, Maggie Gyllenhaal as a bottle blonde is incredibly believable as Sherry.  You sense her vulnerability, you are drawn to her charisma, but ultimately, you are repulsed by her behavior and afraid to believe in her.  She doesn't believe in herself, after all.  The breathless waiting you have for Sherry to give up on herself, to return to her destructive self, to feed her demons, creates suspense in the film.

Laurie Collyer directs a character study of Gyllenhaal's challenge with real life and backs it up with tight, focused camera shots of Sherry from every angle, revealing her inner thoughts, with the contrast of middle class New Jersey and the ugly, dirty streets available to ex-cons.  She sets the mood with the music and tries hard to present Sherry's tale as a feature film; but it disintegrates into more of a documentary as Collyer lets the tale meander and repeat itself through Sherry's ups and downs - there is no clarity to the point that is being made.  The film becomes a showcase for the central performance.

Gyllenhaal, who opened my eyes with her work in ""The Secretary"", chose the role in character with what she consistently presents on the screen - her ability to inhabit the character.  Contrary to most actresses of her generation, Gyllenhaal is not afraid to make unique choices and to build her reputation as an actress to be reckoned with.  In  ""Sherrybaby"", a film that was less than a critical success, that went almost directly to video, she shows that she can carry a film, and doubtless will reap the rewards of better and better scripts in upcoming years.  She is marvelous here.

The film is less so, but still worth a view.  Don't buy the DVD for the extras, there are none - it is a stripped down version designed to allow the public to experience Gyllehaal's performance, ashamedly at award season.",1170547200,15,3694,4.83015873015873
2669536,4,B000JBXXYK,"About halfway through watching this fine movie, I realized that I was just as tense as hell.  Tension, of course, implies emotional investment, and emotional investment implies that a movie is really clicking.

The movie is about a recovering heroin addict who has just been released on parole from prison, and about her increasingly frustrated attempts to get to know the daughter she had to leave behind.  I won't go into the rest of the plot, but suffice it to say that Sherry's struggles had me on edge.  I wouldn't even consider classifying the movie as a suspense film . . . but I found myself in absolute suspense, feeling during practically every scene that things were on the verge of going wrong, and BADLY wrong at that.  I found that I was feeling more suspense over what was going to become of poor Sherry than I can remember feeling at the movies in a while.

Needless to say, the best reason to see the movie is Maggie Gyllenhaal.  Shr's really pretty great.  She really inhabits the character, and what's she's doing often feels less like Acting than it does like . . . well, like you're just watching a real person.  Some people are put off by that kind of performance, but for the rest of us, she's pretty sublime here.  (And I've got to say it . . . DAMN is she hot.  Call me whatever you like, but it's true.  The costume designer for this movie, who apparently had the idea for Gyllenhall to AT NO POINT wear a bra, ought to be given some sort of special Oscar.  Sexist rant now ceases.  Seriously, though . . . HOT.)

I was also delighted to find Danny Trejo playing a normal character in this movie.  He's usually playing a criminal or some other type of thug, but here he's just a charming, helpful ex-con trying to help Sherry stay clean.  I suppose there's a darker side to that story if you really care to see it, but I'm too pleased to see Trejo getting different kind of work, and being good at it, too.

I also admire how economical the screenplay is.  The film is only 96 minutes long, but it feels neither too short nor too long.  Every scene serves a solid purpose, and none of them are squandered.  You don't get that in very many movies.  Usually even the best movies have scenes that could easily have been cut.

Highly recommended for anyone who likes movies about character.

(One final note.  I'm interested in how this movie serves as a darker sort of companion piece to one of 2006's biggest moneymakers, ""The Pursuit of Happyness.""  Both movies are about troubled single parents who spend the entire movie on a nearly Homeric quest to achieve a specific goal.  It would make for an interesting double feature, and I'm intrigued by the fact that two of the year's most-lauded performances come from such thematically similar movies.)",1170374400,8,2774,4.518072289156627
2669537,3,B000JBXXYK,"Maggie Gyllenhaal emerges as an undeniably powerful actress in the title role of this low-budget 2006 indie. Rather than providing her usual scene-stealing turn, she gets to convey the nuances of a full-blown character by delivering an astonishing range of emotion as a struggling ex-convict. The film reminds me quite a bit of Ulu Grosbard's overlooked 1978 ""Straight Time"" in which Dustin Hoffman plays a paroled ex-burglar who cannot shake his former life.  Both provide incisive looks into the hardscrabble existence of people trying desperately to reform, but in doing so, the stories become so desultory and the situations start to have a by-the-numbers feeling that the dramatic momentum dissipates toward their inevitable conclusions.

Directed and written by Laurie Collyer, the film takes an unflinching look at Sherry Swanson, a former heroin addict just released on parole after three years in prison for robbery. Returning home to New Jersey, she is desperate to stay clean and sober in order to reclaim her young daughter Alexis from her sympathetic brother Bobby and his conflicted wife Lynette. Without drugs, Sherry's addictive behavior manifests itself in cigarettes, alcohol and emboldened sexual acts to get what she needs. Yet, her biggest addiction is her relentless pursuit of an idealized image of herself as a mother, and it is her disconnect with reality that produces the film's most poignant moments. Otherwise, the movie gets increasingly frustrating to watch because Collyer provides only hints of what Sherry brought her to her dilemma. What we see mainly are flashes of short-tempered narcissism when we see people understandably looking to emotionally disengage from her, including her indiscriminate father.

There are some surprisingly graphic scenes that show how Sherry uses her shopworn beauty as emotional armor when Collyer could have better used them to underline her melancholy mental state. In the face of these script shortcomings, Gyllenhaal displays enough dexterity to fill in a lot of the blanks, especially when she shows how Sherry starts realizing the depth of her accountability for her problems. Brad William Henke provides solid support as Bobby, as does Bridget Barkan as Lynette, Danny Trejo as a supportive fellow addict, Giancarlo Esposito as Sherry's hardened parole officer, and ebullient little Ryan Simpkins as Alexis. I have to admit I could not wait for the 96-minute movie to be over, but it is worthwhile for Gyllenhaal's courageous work as it is she who holds the film together. Sadly, the 2007 DVD does not contain any significant extras (a commentary from Gyllenhaal and Collyer would have been most welcome) other than the trailer.",1169942400,22,2701,5.320843091334894
