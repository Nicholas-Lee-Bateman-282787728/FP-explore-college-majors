8253292,5,B0013XZ75Q,This was a really interesting and enjoyable movie. It is hard to believe it was made on a low budget. The acting was really good and the story keeps you on the edge of your seat.,1239321600,,178,3.9722222222222223
8253293,3,B0013XZ75Q,"Although this was a relatively low budget production, the young actor who played the autistic boy did a fantastic job. I look forward to seeing him in future movies as his career progresses.",1237507200,,190,4.787878787878788
8253294,2,B0013XZ75Q,"The premise is decent, but the execution is not very well thought out, particularly concerning the supernatural elements.  Overall, the film feels too long, with many scenes ending up very wordy with characters just standing around talking endlessly and unrealistically to each other.  There are a few good performances, including those from Jeff Boyet and Josh Childs, but a few good characters can't save a whole film.",1217376000,,420,5.253731343283582
8253295,5,B0013XZ75Q,"I was fortunate to see Prism during its premier in Nashville, TN and found it captivating.  The woman psychiatrist, Karen Garcia, is an excellent actress. She takes you with her through the twists & terns of her journey to discover the origin of the strange things going on in the mental hospital.  You won't know if they are real or imagined and even more questions arise when the movie is over.  The profiles of the various patients show some as loveable, others funny and most of all show the David Simmons'  talent for getting the most from the actors in a wide range of situations.  Jeremy Childs is especially memorable as Morton adding to the heart pounding experience.  Prism is a movie you will want to see more than once.",1208304000,,731,4.584615384615384
8253296,5,B0013XZ75Q,Director David Simmons offers us a rare glimpse into a world that many of us dare not explore.  With skill and sensitivity he creatively blends the super natural with the uncertain science surrounding autism and the treatment of psychiatric patients.,1206921600,,250,5.25
