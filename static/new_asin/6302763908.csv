509639,5,6302763908,"This episode of Northern Exposure is one of my all-time favorites.  The music, the visuals with Cicely all decorated for the annual Raven pageant...I have come to associate all of that stuff with Thanksgiving now just as much as I do turkeys and pilgrims.  Yes, it is depressing *in a way*, because Joel is such a sourpuss at first.  But he gives a wonderful comic performance and Maggie's interaction with Mike Monroe is sweet too.  Definitely one to watch over and over during harvest season.",975888000,10,494,4.776470588235294
509640,5,6302763908,"This is one of my favorite episodes because it first introduces Officer Barbara Semanski to Cicely, the future bride of Maurice Minnefield.  The whole town is struck with ""Spring Fever""in anticipation of the  ice breaking and to go along with that is a healthy dose of mass  ""horniness"".  Joel and Maggie go at it for the first time and  Holling gets his horns clipped when Officer Semanski, played brilliantly by  Diane Delano, lands a TKO in the boxing ring before the whole town.  Chris  has his own scheme for reminding people about ""chaos"" by ripping  off stereos and Ed tracks him down.  A quote by Chris ""Sometimes you  gotta do something bad just to know you're alive""..Excellent episode!",957744000,22,696,4.813559322033898
509641,5,6302763908,"I have seen all 110 episodes of NX and this is by far one of my favorites!  Maurice Minnefield throws a huge party so that means we get to see the wonderfully strange ""Adam"" going his ""chef"" act and  Joel thinks Maurice has not invited him to the party.  Even Adams' wife,  Eve, the hypochondriact, and their new baby are there.  Together with the  rest of the cast, even Ron, the gay guy, this is an episode not to be  missed.  One thing after another happens in this highly quirky and  eccentric little Alaskan town, a TRUE delight!",948153600,8,534,4.36734693877551
509642,5,6302763908,"I absolutely loved this celebration of our nation's first official holiday! This episode embodies all that Thanksgiving is meant to be about. Fall is ""in the air"" (pumpkins & skeletons) as tomatoes go  flying toward the Caucasian population on the streets. Dr. Joel  Fleischman... a Jewish member of society, originally does not see history  in relation to the upcoming Thanksgiving celebration through the eyes of  his fellow native Indian citizen. However, thanks to the Alaskan gov't,  Joel finds out that he is further ""enslaved"" to a fifth year of  medical service to the state of Alaska. Upon realizing that this  proposition is quite valid & legal, Joel resigns himself to the  situation and begins to view things as hopeless. Alas, his ""eyes""  are now beginning to see things for the first time as a fellow native  Indian. The feeling of hopelessness allows Joel to participate in the  annual Fall Festival Parade typically reserved for only the native Indians  (a culture of fellow victims of a sense of hopelessness, historically  speaking). All is not lost, however. Joel, along with Maggie's current love  interest (played by actor Anthony Edwards..E.R.), decide to lay all mental  obstacles aside during the town's Thanksgiving feast...just long enough to  enjoy it!!!!! You will leave this episode feeling warm & fuzzy each and  every time you watch it!!!!!!",940377600,17,1372,5.163636363636364

509675,5,6302763908,"Cicely is surrounded by astounding natural beauty and some mystery. Every person in Cicely has their place. They work, live, help each other, and ponder about life, love, loss, art and the question ""who would you eat?"" Even tragedy and pain turn into spiritual nourishment, I am referring to Maggie's 5 or 6 dead boyfriends, Chris' destined death at 40, and Joel's Glacier Dropsy, etc.

The show is funny as hell, ""Sunrise 4:02, sunset 4:48"".  I am grateful to have 2 or 4 seasons of this original, beautiful, intelligent drama to enjoy. Seasons 3 and 4 are gems, seasons 5 and 6 are pretty awful. It's obvious the writers of season 6 have never been to Alaska.

509977,4,6302763908,"I grew up in a tiny Alaskan fishing village with no roads and only thirty some residents. We didn't get television until the Eighties and there was some discussion about whether we needed it at all. But I think everyone was glad we had it when this show came out. Even though it wasn't filmed in Alaska, the eccentric and independent characters and offbeat humor was very Alaskan. And we have discovered it's rare to capture than in film (""The Proposal"" starring Sandra Bullock? Puh-leeze!!) Or books (Brent Purvis' mysteries MINK ISLAND and TSUNAMI WARNING are the only ones that come to mind. They capture it--highly recommnded for Northern Exposure fans).

This show brings back a lot of memories of watching it by generator power, knowing everyone else in the village was watching it at the same time, and that we'd discuss the antics in Cicely the next time we saw each other, probably at the single room post office open twice a week.

Series was of course, groundbreaking, coming at the end of the Cold War, and ''Everything is Genetic'' elements of science in the Western social sphere. Society has denegrated at an amazing rate, but being this was voted ''Best Show of the Century'' by a very left-leaning newspaper, it makes an interesting comparison to what was acceptable in terms of social convention in the early 90's, and now, some 20 years later. The show can be slow at times, and yea, its dated, but I've only gotten through the first year. -One nice thing, is, Mourice, for example,is an ''archtype'' conservative. They don't over-write his part (as in the American Version of ''The Office'', which is only derogatory to the conservatives'' in that show). They just play him ''straight-up'' as a normal conservative person. Chris in the Morning was and is amazing, the little quirks he gets into, but thats more 2nd, 3rd 4th season, 1st season they were just getting their characters legs.",1429660800,,1023,4.885057471264368

510022,5,6302763908,"I never watched Northern Exposure when it was originally broadcast - I'm catching up, 20 years ex post facto.  For the most part, it's a very loveable show.  The characters are interesting.  Rob Morrow is a good but underrated actor and I can't even name one film or other TV show I've seen him in.  I don't think any of the actors on this show were famous but that's part of what makes it brilliant I think.  We see the same actors in every other TV show or film nowadays so fresh faces are always very welcoming...to me anyway.",1421625600,,529,4.303030303030303
510023,5,6302763908,"I purchased the entire series when they first came out. I watched the series when they first ran on TV. All the musiic that was used on the show, is on the DVDs. I agree that the music was crucial to many of the storylines. For instance, when a man committed suicide when he heard Pencil Neck Geek on the radio. So many people wrote very good and thoughtful reviews  here on Amazon. I just want to say that the series hit a warm spot in my heart for the beautiful setting, the people that are very real in our diverse world. Much more so than the regular fare on television. I mean you had top shelf actors such as Rob Morrow, Janine Turner, and of course Barry Corbin, all brilliant. But the realism comes from people that are true to life average people with remarkable stories. Walt in real life was a Silver Star recipient for heroism in WW2, he was a Tank Commander. Chris was a Boilermaker before becoming an actor. So his welding was part of his past real life. I worked with his dad. Marilyn was in the waiting room waitng for her mother who was auditioning for a role, when she was discovered. The character development was so good  Ed who was an inspiring film maker knew many famous filmakers and was a shaman in training stalked by the demon of low self esteem. His very apt teacher was none other than Graham Green. If Ed's face looks like someone youv'e seen, you have his father is Billy Drago,characters run in his familyi. Adam adds a whoe other dimension to the show. The situations touch on everyday hope, joy, sadness and show how quirky we humans really are. I have never in my life watched a show where like Holling, admit that he hates sports, unthinkable !. Everyone that was in this show can be proud and lucky at the same time, that they were part of this wonderful show. I'll leave you with a line that Ruth Ann said to Dr. Joel when a patient had died. She told him your'e only a doctor Joel. We can be so full of ourselves.",1421452800,,1952,4.301630434782608

510025,5,6302763908,"This is the only season they released where the music is original, thanks to Columbia, so it gets 5 stars. It is WONDERFUL to be able to go back and revisit this series 24 years later, but it also makes me a little sad for tv today because it looks like a movie compared to any sitcoms of the last 15 years. Anyhow, if you're on the fence, go for it. For between $10-15 (Amazon's price fluctuates), though you only get 8 episodes, they're really high quality. I'd missed Ed more than I knew and liked Joel more than I'd remembered.

Someone should have said that it has multiple quirky characters all bouncing off each other & the environment with a mixture of comedy & drama that has to be seen to be believed.

510033,5,6302763908,"Until 1990, there was nothing like it on television. A drama set in current small fictional town, Cicely, Alaska. The main character, Dr. Joel Fleischman, is a New York City trained doctor (played very well by Rob Morrow), who discovers upon his initial trip to Anchorage, Alaska that he is going to a small town in the middle of nowhere or so he thinks. If he doesn't serve as a doctor in town and forfeit his college loan of $125,000, he could go to prison so he has nowhere else to go. The contract was ironclad and bulletproof.

But for a New Yorker like Joel Fleischman, he is surrounded by eccentric characters. At first, you find him to be arrogant and self-serving but you learn to like him and the town of Cicely itself. Janine Turner plays Maggie O'Connell, a pilot and his landlord. Broadway legend John Cullum plays lovable bar owner, Hollin. Cynthia Geary plays his young girlfriend and partner. Barry Corbin plays retired astronaut and millionaire, Maurice, who seems to own the town. Darren E. Burrows plays a Native young adult and a movie buff. John Corbett plays Chris, the radio broadcaster and artist. There are other characters like Elaine Miles who played mild mannered and lovable secretary, Marilyn, and Peg Phillips who ran the general store.

They actually filmed the show in Washington rather than Alaska but it's still beautiful. The series had a combination of comedy and drama. The first season lasted only 8 episodes perhaps because the network (CBS) wasn't sure if it would pan out in 1990.

The series came on as a summer replacement in 1990 for only 8 episodes but the critics and fans adored it. It was different and explored a culture about people in small town Alaska.  Part of the appeal was the realistic cast, quirky drama, and the chemistry between Fleischman and Maggie who often disagreed at times.

The DVD comes with extra footage such as the film spoofs with the cast, deleted scenes, and others. The quality is first rate and the show is wonderful and fresh to watch again 25 years later.",1414022400,,2035,4.72112676056338

510078,4,6302763908,"Pretty much everyone that is likely to read this by now knows about the show.  Many probably watched it when it was originally on TV in the early 1990s.  It is the story of a doctor from NY (played by Rob Morrow) who , in order to pay for medical school, took a scholarship that required him to work for 4 years in Alaska.  He thought that he would be working in Anchorage, only to be shipped to the small town of Cicely.

The first season only had an 8 episode run (being a mid-season replacement show).  Most of the episodes in the first season dealt with the fish out of water aspect of Dr Fleischman living on the edge of the Alaskan Wilderness and his trying to get out of the contract keeping him in Alaska.  Toward the end of the season the show begins to focus on the quirky residents of the town.

The cornerstone of the show was the quality acting and writing.  The cast was truly ensemble, mainly comprised of relatively unknown actors and actresses.  It does have the feel of an early 1990s series, so some of the references in it are somewhat dated now (sharp viewers will get the dig at Twin Peaks, probably the most popular show on TV around that time) but overall the themes of the show hold up well almost 25 years later.

As for the DVD set itself, unfortunately Universal went the cheap route.  There are two double sided DVDs with 2 episodes on each side.  There are also deleted and extended scenes for each episode, but unfortunately no making of or behind the scenes features to speak of.  Also be aware that there may be discs out there that were burned incorrectly.  When I originally bought season 1, the first disc had the same episodes on both sides.  So you want to make sure to check them right away so you can return it if necessary.  The show itself is 5 star quality, but the DVD set is bad enough that It warrants dropping it down a star.",1400889600,3,1872,4.305714285714286

The storyline starts out in a straight forward enough way - New York doctor moves to Alaska to practice in order to have his student loans forgiven and meets a bunch of quirky characters. But as the episodes progress, they become less and less straight forward and more and more wonderful. We're now in Season 3, and in the last episode Chris struggled to decide how to bury his best friend's corpse. Cosmic! This series is sort of like Seinfeld on hallucinogens; it's far more entertaining than Cheers, or that other Kelsey Grammar show (can't remember the name). Almost as good as Mash.

Seasons 1 and 2 together was not advertised as be packaged in a ""Parka"".  Apparently the ""Parka"" is no longer available, at least for Season 1, because the product was not packaged in the Parka as advertised.

I have purchased many items from Amazon.com and this was the first time I did not receive the item as advertised.  I realize that some items will come with a limited edition and only so many of that product will be available.  However, I think it is amazon.com's responsibility to update their products decriptions or let it be known that the limited edition product is no longer available.

Northern Exposure is about a young doctor who unwilling is placed in a small town named Cicely in Alaska as part of a student loan repayment deal.  He thought he would be placed in Anchorage, Alaska.  The idea of a young highly educated Jewish New Yorker living in a place that is strikingly different sounds like the Peace Corps to me!

510269,5,6302763908,"Chris in the Morning...the one and only DJ at the little radio station (KBHR), in Cicely, Alaska is about to give the traffic report...""Maggie O'Connell just drove down Main St, and she's going a little too fast"". That about sums up the pace of this little remote town, elevation 6,572, that with the addition of Dr. Joel Fleischman, newly arrived from New York City, has a population of 215 quirky, but very lovable residents.

Dr. Fleischman(Rob Morrow) is being held against his will. Going through medical school with the financial help of the good people of the state of Alaska(as he is constantly reminded), he is now committed to serve his time...a few years of medical services in return for his Columbia University education. It won't be so bad...a condo in Anchorage, golfing on the weekends, a nice office in the city..but wait..hold the phone...instead of Anchorage, he's roped into serving his time in Cicely!

Joel is always trying everything to find some loop-hole in his contract,and you will fall more in love with the wonderful characters and the beautiful surroundings with each episode. And...you'll have lots of laughs doing it. He is like a fish out of water as this big city yuppie deals with the everyday happenings in Cicely. ""I'M A DOCTOR"", he says over and over, as he contends with wild animals, plumbing problems, the wilderness, and interacts in the seemingly odd lives of the residents.

The stories you will find to be some of the best writing TV has to offer.
You can't help but to become attached to the residents. From the native Indians, to the ex-astronaut, the beauty queen, and to the folks who just found themselves there, wanting to start a new life and stayed. And apparently, Dr. Fleischman can't help it either, as by the end of the first season we see he has begun to warm to them and has started to discover the beauty of his surroundings as well.

The story lines will definitely keep a smile on your face. Right from the start there is even some great romantic tension between the Doc and Maggie(the local bush pilot, who also happens to be Joel's landlady).The cast is a marvelous ensemble. It includes Janine Turner, Barry Corbin and John Corbett.

Also included are deleted scenes and outtakes. The picture is beautiful, the sound is in DD2.0 surround, and there are captions in English for those who need them(this is always a plus in my book). It may also be viewed with French or Spanish subtitles. One thing I might have liked would be an insert with info about episode placements. Most of the discs are 2 sided, and that would have made it easier to find my place when I had to leave off.

The question is, is it better to go with a multi-pack or one season at a time. The prices from the outside sellers seem to be best at this time, but you should check for the best deal on the individual seasons(adding shipping charges from outside sellers) and see which comes out cheaper(amazon vs. merchants). Sometimes if you can find a good deal on a multi-season set from a merchant, it might work out best as you will only have the one time shipping fees(same for any number of DVDs). If you are patient you can put this(or each season) in your cart and watch for a good deal. Also keep in mind there are two more season(5 and 6) and the entire series is also packages together for sale as well.

If you are a fan, you will enjoy reliving some time in Cicely with the Doc, Holling and Shelly, Chris, Ed, Maurice, Marilyn, Maggie, and one very large moose! If you have never seen this and are looking for some really fine entertainment, you will find that here...but..be careful, you may want to pack it all in and move there! This would also make a great Christmas Present for anyone who loves this show.

510304,5,6302763908,"The early 1990s saw a major public interest in the bizarrity of smalltown shows, clearly evidenced in three shows: TWIN PEAKS, PICKET FENCES, and NORTHERN EXPOSURE.  Each was very different and completely unlike anything on television before or after.  NORTHERN EXPOSURE was the lightest and most wacky of the bunch.  The series revolved around Dr. Joel Fleischman (Rob Morrow), a young New Yorker fresh out of medical school.  His tuition was paid by the state of Alaska, on the condition that Dr. Fleischman be stationed in Alaska after his graduation.  Expecting to be positioned in Anchorage, Fleischman happily accepts.  But to his immense dismay, he finds himself thrown into the middle of nowhere, also known as Cicely, Alaska, a town with a population of 215.  At first Fleischman wants nothing more than to escape from the bizarre town and its even more bizarre inhabitants, but as time goes on he comes to appreciate the town and the individuals living there.  Those individuals include cocky pilot Maggie O'Connell (Janine Turner), burly ex-NASA pilot and ""owner"" of the town Maurice J. Minnifield (Barry Corbin), amiable young aspiring filmmaker Ed (Darren E. Burrows), and peaceful early-morning radio DJ Chris Stevens (John Corbett).

NORTHERN EXPOSURE is a show like no other.  The first season contains a mere 8 episodes, but is as charming as any series in history.  The simplicity of life in Cicely, the beauty of the scenery, the companionship between the town's inhabitants, fills one with love and warmth, and was no doubt a major factor in what made the show so attractive to viewers when it debuted in 1990.  The acting is wonderful all-around, the writing is witty and often absurd, and though the first season has not one dramatic scene, it's profoundly moving and irresistably enjoyable.  For TWIN PEAKS fans like myself, I warn that NORTHERN EXPOSURE has little in common with that show, although the fifth episode of this season contains a very silly and funny spoof of it.  Still I would highly recommend this show for anyone willing to try a new flavor of television.

As for the DVDs, the NORTHERN EXPOSURE sets are probably the most infamous TV DVDs ever released.  On subsequent seasons, almost all music contained in the show was replaced with generic tunes (save for the theme).  I personally find this despicable, but Universal has no intention of re-releasing the seasons with the original music at the moment.  Season one, however, contains all the original music.  The picture and sound quality are excellent, and the menus are very nice.  It can be a little confusing to watch the series in order, however, as the first side of disc 1 actually contains the second batch of episodes, and the episodes are not numbered, nor is there any booklet for easy navigation through the season.  I recommend tv.com for a chronological episode listing.  Lastly, the packaging.  Consumers have complained about the parka packaging used for the first two seasons, but I myself believe it is the most charming and wonderful TV-DVD packaging ever.  I absolutely adore it, and I'm very sad that Universal did not continue doing this for the rest of the series.  Nevertheless, this is a fine set, and it's better to have a lightly toyed-with release of the series than none whatsoever.",1173312000,14,3306,4.978142076502732

Such a great cast with exceptional writing.

The DVD's them selves are a little short on content. For one I was surprised to see only 8 episodes for season 1 and 7 for season 2. I bought the two seasons combined and still think there are some shows missing. There is plenty of lost footage and outtakes but nothing amazing to write about. You do a get a little insight from the actors by their outtakes. I was hoping for a little more just based on the quirkiness of the show.

Overall this is a great series to own and cherish. I would definitely look for on sales though. In my opinion $50 is a little much.",1156204800,3,931,4.254237288135593

510308,5,6302763908,"When I'm having one of those crummy days that I just assume forget, I find that one of the best things to do is to put on a DVD from the '90s comedy-drama, ""Northern Exposure"". There is something about this TV show, it's characters and the self-contained world it creates, that just makes you forget about everything else around you. It just sucks you in. In the first season we meet Dr. Joel Fleischman (Rob Morrow), a rather insecure, self-analyzing, New Yorker (think of a younger, better looking version of Woody Allen), who is expecting to be paying back the $125,000 worth of medical school tuition, that the great state of Alaska subsidized, by working in the big city of Anchorage. But the pencil pushers have a different ideal and he winds up in the tiny, rustic town of Cicely, Alaska (Pop. 215), which while beautiful, is basically in the middle of no-where. The town is populated by some rather free spirited folks, who seem to downplay prevailing logic (much to Dr. Fleischman's consternation) and take a rather layed back, somewhat surreal attitude towards life and the many strange situations it might present. This is one of those places where everyone knows each others business and they arn't afraid to express their opinions. This is just the broadest sketch of what the show is about. The series created by Joshua Brand & John Falsey is well written (how many TV shows quote Neizche & Walt Witman?) and each episode feels more like a philosophical meditation, rather then a straight ahead TV plot. The ensemble cast is absolutely wonderful and brings insight into some of the more interesting characters to come out of the TV medium. How many TV shows have among it's characters a neurotic physician, an ex-astronaut, an ice queen Bush pilot, a philosophizing  radio DJ, a teenage beauty queen, and a half-indian filmmaker? This is one of those shows that once you start you won't be able to stop. It's that addictive. Highly recommended!",1151539200,6,1958,4.8273809523809526

I haven't watched the show in a couple of years due to the time that Hallmark played it and I lost touch with what is still is my all-time favorite show.

510322,5,6302763908,"""Northern Exposure"" started as a mid-season series on CBS in the 90s.  But, I was too young to watch such TV since mostly my interests were in cartoons and teen sitcoms like ""Growing Pains"", ""Family Ties"", ""Who's the Boss"".  This series probably will grow with you after you get through the pilot episode.  Now, I can look back and see why this show has its charm.  This probably paved the road for NBC dramedy series like ""Providence"" and ""Ed"".  It kinda re-opens the book on the whole idea of growing up in secluded town of friendly folks.

Okay, the orange parka is cute and the price is well pricey for just 8 episodes.  So, I suggest just watching a few episodes by checking out from library or renting it.  Overall, DVD format itself is probably just basis for those who dread all those fancy menus.  The price you pay for quirky TV show with interesting music is the simple treatment.  No frills with exception of some random clips/bloopers added in.  Supposedly getting rights for music is very time-consuming and also expensive so the rest of the seasons have replaced the original music.  Thankfully, this first season keeps all the music and you probably will enjoy the selection.

Overall, this is just a simple release but everything is intacted.  So, beware of future releases since music will be replaced which may be pretty obvious in certain scenes.  By the way, there is no insert which tells you what episodes are on the discs.  So, you probably want to search online for a self-made DVD insert.  Also, these are double-sided DVDs which mean you gotta be careful of scratching when flipping discs.  Not my favorite format but it does reduce the number of DVDs to carry around.  Plus, you got that fancy parka to show off to friends if they remember this wonderful series.",1141776000,4,1790,4.67948717948718

510329,5,6302763908,"I give this set five stars, but I completely understand those who give it one based on 1) the paltry number of special features and 2) the astonishing price.  I'll give one defense for the latter:  by pricing the first two seasons at the same price of later one's, they help even out the expense caused by the very expensive licensing of music.  NORTHERN EXPOSURE was one of the first series to feature large amounts of music by original artists and in retaining much of the music from the original run they have to pay extremely large amounts of fees.  The cost of the music is the reason why we have not yet seen ALLY MCBEAL on DVD.  So, I can be philosophical about the cost of the first two seasons, though I will agree that the cost is excessive.

On one level, NORTHERN EXPOSURE was incredibly unlucky in its debut.  Only a few weeks before its appearance TWIN PEAKS appeared, filmed only a few miles away from where NORTHERN EXPOSURE was made (both shows were made in Washington state, not far from Seattle, despite the supposed Alaska locale).  Because TWIN PEAKS was so much more extremely, it made NORTHERN EXPOSURE seem tamer than it was in reality.  In fact, NORTHERN EXPOSURE was conceived and developed separately from TWIN PEAKS, though the former quickly acknowledged the latter in its first season by visiting the waterfalls where TWIN PEAKS was filmed and making explicit reference to the log lady.

Still, if one wants precedents for NORTHERN EXPOSURE, one could better compare the show to GREEN ACRES filtered through the changes that had taken place in television narrative in the 1980s.  Like Oliver, Joel Fleischman finds himself in a rural setting surrounded by a group of eccentrics who take him as stranger than any of themselves, albeit Oliver goes to his farm willingly while Joel is forced to go to Alaska.  Although NORTHERN EXPOSURE would later win an Emmy as Best Drama, it was in reality a quirky comedy.  Its closest descendent might be THE GILMORE GIRLS (though Amy Sherman-Palladino credits BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER as her favorite show and the one that has most inspired her, her creation THE GILMORE GIRLS is much closer to NORTHERN EXPOSURE), another hour-long comedy.  Amazingly, both NORTHERN EXPOSURE and ST. ELSEWHERE were inspired by the experiences of the same doctor, who was co-creator Joshua Brand's college roommate.

Most shows that debut during spring or summer seasons fail, but there have been some astonishing exceptions, such as HILL STREET BLUES and BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.  NORTHERN EXPOSURE has the very odd distinction of having been a summer or spring only series for two straight years.  It debuted with eight episodes in July 1990, returned with seven episodes in the spring of 1991, before its first full season beginning in the fall of 1991.  What I find amazing given the great irregularity of its early schedule was that they were able to hold together the original cast, and that their characters were so well defined so quickly.  Though they would develop and mature with the ensuing seasons, Joel, O'Connell, Holling, Ed, Maurice, Shelly, the ultra-laconic Marilyn, and Chris Stevens, the spiritual center of the show, were there from the very beginning.  The show would grow quirkier and the narrative became far more contextualized with ensuing seasons, but it was a great show from the very beginning.

I agree that the first two seasons of the show are way overpriced.  I would have personally have preferred to see the two seasons combined in a single set, but mainly I'm just glad that these are available.  Definitely one of the great television series of the nineties.",1136419200,2,3647,4.875202593192869
510330,5,6302763908,"As soon as you see the title of this fourth season episode of ""Northern Exposure,"" you might wonder if there is a connection between ""Aurora Borealis,"" the last episode of the abbreviated first season, and ""Northern Lights.""  Yes, there actually is a connection in that the former is when Chris Stevens (John Corbett) discovered that Bernard (Richard Cummings Jr.) was his brother, and Bernard is back helping Chris in the Morning on KBHR helping people cope with the oppressive darkness.  Also, we once again find Chris working on his winter sculpture.

""Northern Lights"" (First aired March 1, 1993), was written by Diana Frolov and Andrew Scheider, and primarily focuses on the winter rituals of the local inhabitants.  For example, Holling Vincoeur (John Cullum) is hibernating, leaving Shelley (Cynthia Geary) to run the Brick all by herself.  As mentioned above, Chris is again working on his winter sculpture, but halfway through the process his muse abandons him, which is not a good thing.  Then there is Ruth-Ann (Peg Miller), who has taken to painting.

Then there are the major conflicts of the episode.  Cicely has its first homeless man in Lane Bristol (Scott Paulin), who appears on the street and starts begging for money.  Maurice (Barry Corbin) wants the bum thrown out of town until he learns that Bristol was also a marine, at which point Maurice does a complete about face to try and help his fellow jarhead.  Then there is poor Joel (Rob Morrow), who is looking forward to his first vacation away from Alaska.  After all, we are down to that time of year when the sun only shines for an hour each day, if that.  But the state of Alaska denies him time for a vacation because the community would be endangered by not having a doctor.  Of course an irate Joel decides to see if that would be the case by going on strike, somehow thinking the state of Alaska, having sent him to Cicely in the first place, will be reasonable and/or compassionate with regards to his plight.

This is a fairly literate episode, not just because Chris is quoting the likes of Goethe, Dylan Thomas, John Henry Newman, the Book of Psalms, and Isaiah, but also because ""light"" is a master metaphor in the episode from start to finish.  It extends even to the beer than Lance is drinking and the earrings that Shelly is wearing when Holling finally wakes up.  So you might think this episode is all about Seasonal Affective Disorder (appropriately abbreviated as SAD), but it really is all about letting a little light in your life.",1135382400,4,2527,4.761467889908257
510331,5,6302763908,"""Northern Exposure"" was the quirky television program about Dr. Joel Fleischman (Rob Morrow), who graduates from medical school in New York and shows up in Anchorage to work for four years because the state of Alaska paid for his education.  However, Joel ends up in the tiny town of Cicely in the Alaskan interior instead, setting up one of the best ""fish out of water"" television series of all-time as the young doctor has to deal with the strange characters of his new home.

""Spring Break"" (Written by David Assael, First aired May 6, 1991) is a second season episode in which the long hard winter has the citizens of Cicely on edge.  The title refers to the much anticipated moment when the ice of the frozen record breaks and heralds the coming of spring.  But there are other telltale signs that spring is coming in.  Holling is looking for somebody to fight, but cannot find anybody willing.  That is, until Sergeant Barbara Semanski comes to town to investigate the minor thefts that are taking place all over town.  But Ed is already on the case trying to figure out who is the kleptomaniac who commits a rash of break-ins during the meltdown each year, and Sergeant Semanski has to deal with catching Maurice's eye.

Meanwhile, Shelly is reading classical literature, Maggie is having sexual fantasies about Joel, and Joel is desperately looking for female companionship.  A solid enough episode, but ""Spring Break"" strikes gold at the end when we get to Cicely's annual Meltdown Dance and then the glorious Running of the Bulls.  The latter involves the men of Cicely running naked through the town and if you want to point to a moment where you can saw Joel becomes a real member of the town, this could well be it.  Besides, the execution of the Running of the Bulls is almost as good as the idea itself.

Final Note:  Apparently if you like to pay attention to tiny details and want something to look for when you rewatch a favorite ""Northern Exposure"" episode, then keep track of Shelly's earrings (no, you are not required to make this a drinking game).  In this episode Shelly wears watermelon halves, blue vinyl records, globes, and a bowling pin & ball.  I never knew this was a running gag on the show (obviously not interested in jewelry), but now that I now about this every time I see Shelly on the show now I have to punch pause and see what is dangling from her ears.",1134777600,5,2393,4.610849056603773

The pilot alone is almost worth it's cost if you were a big fan of the show in the early 90's.  Watching Fleischman enter Cecily for the first time and meeting all of the major characters along with him was great.  It obviously gives you much more insight and background on each major character.  And it is also one of the funnier episodes I've seen.

I don't have any issues with the sound or visual quality as others have mentioned, it looks and sounds just fine, and is pretty much what I expected.

Hard-core fans are willing to shell out for these DVDs, but we're all getting pretty disgusted with the way this great TV series' release is being handled. The long drawn out wait for a handful of new episodes each year is killing the momentum and good will of their audience.

And enough with the parkas! Give us CONTENT not packaging!

The show is still great to watch and the fans want very much to buy the series on DVD. Unfortunately, everyone who buys these DVDs is feeling very ripped off, frustrated and mad at Universal for their extremely untimely and ill-conceived release of this show.",1102550400,22,1408,4.4941176470588236

And I too am disgusted at Universal's greed shown by such things as the flimsy two-sided & therefore unlabeled discs, the effort into promotion rather than quality packaging such as there is no listing of individual programs anywhere .. impossible to refer to a case or disc label or anywhere else to find out what's included on each disc. It could have been packed SO MUCH BETTER!! .. without the cutesy & useless little parka thing. For the high price given the limited number of episodes, Universal should have done it right! .. Still I'm happy to have it at all .. once one actually gets to the episodes themselves they are as exquisite as always.",1101859200,9,811,4.449664429530201
510425,3,6302763908,"The positive side of this is that it's wonderful to have these episodes on DVD. I've been waiting for a long time. Hope to see the full series available someday. But, as a consumer, I deserve better. I'm not going to grovel and say ""It's OK to give us a cheaply-made product, just so I have any version of NX on DVD!"" I don't mind paying a high price for a quality production, but this is an embarrassment to Universal. It's like they let the interns take over or something. Actually, my interns produce better work than this - maybe they SHOULD'VE turned it over to the interns.

I'm one of those fans who's willing to pay the price because I love the series, but who thinks we're getting ripped off with the sloppiness and cheap production of this DVD. I don't believe for one minute the music licensing is the cause of this. If the DVD had been produced properly, I'd be OK with the price, but this is the flimsiest version of a TV season DVD I've ever seen.

The annoyances of this DVD set: The parka package is a cheap gimmick I could do without. Just makes it annoying to pack and store. I took it off and stuck it in a closet somewhere. I would rather have seen the effort that went into the parka go into the DVD (I know it doesn't work that way). Flimsy, two-sided discs are really annoying. They had to do this for a mere 8 episodes? Rubbish. It makes it frustrating to play. Labeling is confusing, hard to read, poorly done.  I wouldn't even care to pay this price for a mere 8 episodes, if the quality of this was as it should be. And, it looks as if we have the same sloppiness to look forward to with the second season. I also wasn't impressed with the extras. They could've boosted the quality by giving fans something special here, but don't seem to be committed enough to this project to do so.

It is great to see the episodes here. Aurora Borealis is one of my favorites. I'd buy the set just for this one. The only draw to this set is if it has episodes on it you really want to have. If it does, you'll probably give in to the price, put up with the poor quality and buy the set. That's how good the show was.

I'm hoping someday we'll get a properly-produced box set of this series that is produced with the care it deserves. I'm not holding my breath though, so this seems to be what we're going to get and have to look forward to with future releases. Too bad - this show and its fans deserve better.",1101513600,18,2424,4.204301075268817

If you really think the price of this set is too high (as I do), you've got to grit your teeth and NOT BUY IT!

On this set, during the show our volume has to set up to 28-30 to hear the actors but if the theme or other music comes up, you have to quickly set the volume down to about 15-18 or get blasted out.

  It went out on top and with class, and I'm happy to see it back again in this format.

  The cost is pretty steep for the amount of content, however the tremendous cost and negotiation involved with the music licenses (which are shockingly expensive beyond what most people would ever guess) have set the price.  This and future sets will likely carry a hefty price tag, but I'm pretty sure it was this way, or no way at all.

  One thing they did, unfortunately,  to bring the cost down (slightly) was to use double-sided disks which was clearly, from the reviews (and in my own humble opinion), an awful mistake.  I'm already paying big bucks to get my eight episodes, so I would really rather have dropped the extra buck or two for good quality, single sided, nicely labeled disks, and I pray the studio took their lumps on this grave error and ship us a nicer product for the remaining seasons (and some kind of paper insert, even just one loose page for God's sake, would be appreciated).

No one watches television in the summer. And heaven knows smart people do not watch television in the summer. I am so glad the clowns in programming were wrong.

Northern Exposure was a suprise hit. Why? Because the writing is good, the characters are strong and evolve as the series progresses. The content is challenging.

(Sure, ""The Sopranos"" is a better show on balance, but who is more amiable company--Ed Chigliak or Paulie Gualtieri?) This 2-CD set of the first eight episodes of Northern Exposure takes us back to the show's halcyon days, when we got our first taste of Joel and Maggie's quasi-romantic sparring, of Holling and Shelly's May-September love, of Chris's half-brilliant, half-chiselbrained philosophizing, of Maurice's slow burns and Marilyn's unflappable calm. Northern Exposure takes us to its own cozy, quirky little world and envelops us in it--a perfect sixty-minute vacation. The CD transfers on the new discs are crisp and excellent, as this extremely scenic show deserves. Yet although I appreciated the whimsy of the cute little orange zipper parka that encloses the CD box, I would gladly have traded it for a booklet on the production of the first season, and a few more extras.

The price is completely whacked considering this show is a decade old, there are only 2 discs with eight episodes (yes, I know there were only 8 the first season, but hence my reason for complaining about the price!!!), the lack of extra features for such a series, AND....the thing that REALLY ticked me off....it seems that since they are charging an exhorbitant price for this set, they COULD have paid someone with a brain to arrange the episodes in PROPER order on the discs!!!!

510468,5,6302763908,"I must have received a new, revised edition of this DVD with the other previous customer reviews/complaints in mind when Universal remade it. There are absolutely no flaws, a decent amount of extras (although not exceedingly entertaining it is still nice to see happy times amongst cast and crew between takes) but, most importantly contains the Pilot episode! Although a Johnny-come-lately to the series (I didn't start watching the series until it's premier syndication on A&E back in '97), I fell head over heals for this series and along with The Wonder Years has got to be the best television series ever written. I have watched this series in it's entirety 7 times and it just got better and better each time. Upon watching this series it becomes axiomatic that each actor was as carefully chosen for their corresponding roles as was the plot of each episode as well as the general plot and direction the series was predetermined to take. Masterfully written with character developement at it's best with not a shred of contradiction by the end of the series. It's just too bad Rob Morrow felt he had to leave the series in search of other prospects by the end of the fifth season or this series might very well have run for another five years. Rob and Janine's on set chemistry is something Moonlighting could only have hoped to achieve. It will be a long time before another Television series comes along as good as this one. I have waited seven years for this to come out on DVD and owning the first season is a dream come true (no more waiting until 1:00 a.m. to see commercial-drenched episodes on the Hallmark Channel) and I greatly anticipate owning the reamining five seasons as they become available.

From the quirky and unusual characters to the fact that while the show was airing I could drive to the town of ""Cicely, Alaska"" (actually the town of Roslyn, Washington) and literally walk the streets and visit the same stores and restaurants they did, and see where the scenes were filmed.

What this show did so well was take ""Seinfeld-like"" daily events and situations of this unordinary and unusual town and capture the tensions and pulls between the characters. The interactions are always so well written that show had a level of realism in the personal relationships that made the strange events that much more captivating. Perhaps the early ""Moonlighting"" episodes were the only show that captured the on again-off again relationship tension between the lead characters as well as Northern Exposure did. Joel Fleischman is one of the better characters ever produced at depicting prolonged culture shock, and his early reactions to the differences between NYC and this little town in the middle of nowhere are priceless.

The packaging of the set itself is unique with the ""down jacket"" zipped up to cover the package, although not easy to store that way.  I would have liked to see more bonus materials as well, so perhaps this will be available in set two?

To pay for his medical school expenses, Dr. Fleischman entered a financial program created by the state of Alaska on the condition that he would practice medicine in Alaska upon graduation for a specified number of years.  Begrudgingly, Dr. Fleischman travels to Alaska believing that he will be working in one of the major cities.  Instead, he is required to work in the small and isolated fictional town of Cicely (filmed in the town of Roslyn, Washington), whose residents are rather quirky and which is owned and controlled primarily by a wealthy retired astronaut, Maurice J. Minnifield (Barry Corbin).  Other residents of Cicely include Dr. Fleischman's assistant, Marilyn Whirlwind (Elaine Miles), the pilot Maggie O'Connell (Janine Turner), bar owner Holling Gustaf Vincoeur (John Cullum), his girlfriend Shelly Marie Tambo Vincoeur (Cynthia Geary), the somewhat nosy buy very friendly Edward 'Ed' Chigliak (Darren E. Burrows), store owner Ruth-Anne Miller (Peg Phillips, 1918-2002) and the town's favorite local radio DJ Christopher 'Chris' Stevens (John Corbett).  Over the course of the series, a tense relationship develops between Dr. Fleischman and Maggie, Maggie's boyfriends continue to accidentally die off, Maurice fights his own inner demons and Dr. Fleischman slowly adjusts to life in untamed Alaska.
Many people were not pleased when ""Northern Exposure"" was cancelled after its 1994-1995 season, but its 110 episodes are well worth watching.  The short first season includes the eight following episodes:
1. ""Pilot"". Dr. Fleischman arrives in Anchorage, which doesn't need him; but the town of Cicely does.
2. ""Brains, Know How and Native Intelligence"".  Dr. Fleischman attempts to treat Ed'd uncle (Frank Sotonoma Salsedo), a tribal medicine man; and Maurice is not happy to hear revelations about Walt Whitman as read by Chris on Maurice's radio station.
3. ""Soapy Sanderson"". A hermit, Soapy Sanderson (John McLiam), is convinced by Dr. Fleischman to put his affairs in order with surprising results for Dr. Fleischman and Maggie.
4. ""Dreams, Schemes and Putting Greens"".  Dr. Fleischman gets involved with Maurice's scheme to get Japanese investment in Cicely, and Holling proposes to Shelley.
5. ""Russian Flu"".  One of my favorite episodes, all the residents of Cicely become ill and Dr. Fleischman learns a few things about traditional Native American medicine.
6. ""Sex, Lies and Ed's Tapes"".  The relationship between Holling & Shelley is rocked, Ed suffers writer's block and Maggie and her boyfriend Rick (Grant Goodeve) worry about ""Maggie's curse"".
7. ""A Kodiak Moment"".  Maurice wants to adopt Chris, and tension rises between Fleischman and Maggie when she takes over his childbirth class.
8. ""Aurora Borealis- A Fairy Tale for Big People"".  Strange behaviors erupt in Cicely with the northern lights, and Fleischman is rescued by a man (Adam Arkin) that nobody thinks exists.
""Northern Exposure"" was a truly wonderful show.  The first season DVD set includes all eight episodes, as well as deleted scenes from each of the episodes.  Though the set is a bit pricey, I rate it overall with 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it.  After ""Northern Exposure"", John Corbett portrayed the character ""Ian Miller"" in the 2002 film ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" and the character ""Aiden Shaw"" in several seasons of the HBO TV show ""Sex and the City"" (1998-2004).",1088035200,13,3609,5.318101933216169

After reading the reviews so far of this long awaited release I think it is clear to be precise in saying that it is worth every cent and then some, since well, it is the best show ever, but it is understandably over priced if you don't agree with it being the best show made thus far.  I am in college and can't afford much at times, but I made sure I could get this and I have not been disappointed.  The fact that I don't have to watch the crummy recordings I have makes the little annoyances of the marketing, packaging, and whatever you all want to gripe about tolerable.  If another show I would give it four stars for the facts of the 'problems' and pricing if you know nothing of the show and browse reviews to base purchases, but the show is incredible and brilliant in it's overall design and orchestration of events, stories, and of course, characters.  The blend of myth, lore, and reality in such a setting is powerful enough to make Roslyn a Mecca for us fans from around the world.  I went a few years ago and in what was Ruth Ann's store there is a map and book of people who have visited from everyplace and more that the show was aired.  That has to say something.  The show is that inspirational and appeals that much to so many.  So buy it!  That way those corporate marketing people will release the rest of the seasons for us who just simply love the show and can appreciate the convince and quality of DVD, and the bonus material, which I like.  Oh, and compared to buying them on VHS, this is cheap!  And I like the Parka!  Come on, it's a Parka!  For a DVD!",1087862400,10,1659,4.228571428571429

510620,4,6302763908,"Northern Exposure is a rare, truly original series.  The show follows the experiences of transplanted New Yorker, Joel Fleischman (Rob Morrow) in the Alaskan town of Cicely, where the citizens are some of the strangest people on earth.  Joel is baffled by the quirks and oddities of locals and it doesn't get any better for him as he is bound for four years of indentured service as repayment for a loan to go to medical school.  Despite the quirks, the people of Cicely are warm and caring people. Its that soft undertone that helps keep Northern Exposure from tipping over the edge of being just plain weird.  The only drawback to the collection is that since the first season was a midseason replacement, it is a scant eight episodes.  It would have been nice to see this and the second season packaged together.",1087344000,3,815,4.671328671328672

On DVD's: to quote a woody allen movie (originally talking about LP's adapted to CD's), DVD's ""sterilize the sound.""

By better sound I mean: I can hear the songs clearly playing in the background.  Or, I don't have to adjust my stereo's volume up and down between non-musically accompanied conversation and full volume musical numbers.

They could have learned a lesson from Homicide: Life on the Street, who released a combined DVD package of the first two seasons. Additionally, I find the deleted scenes entirely useless. TV shows need to be edited for time through a natural process because of the format, unlike in film, in which the artistic decisions are more of a factor in deciding what stays and what goes (or so one would hope.) The strength of this DVD collection is simply that the original show was so terrific, groundbreaking, smart, and funny.

510648,5,6302763908,"I was just watching my old (and sparse) video collection of Northern Exposure episodes last year and it struck me how much better this ""fine wine"" had become over time. The prospect of seeing this remarkable series on DVD had been fairly bleak up to then because of licensing problems related to the soundtrack. Frankly, I had given up hope.
Watching Northern Exposure on DVD is a completely new experience. The picture and sound quality is simply incredible. And I had forgotten just how important the music tracks were to the story. You've got to salute Universal for doing this right. And, as others have pointed out, this is the reason for the hefty price tag.
This is one of the most important additions to my DVD collection. Northern Exposure isn't just a TV series. It transcends both television and cinema as a poetic statement about the human condition. What is captured here is that which has eluded most artists, writers, philosophers, musicians and filmmakers. This is the holy grail of storytelling with a human face, stretching from the Northern Lights into inner space. I never get tired of going to Cicely, Alaska, or watching its characters and scenery in the turmoil and beauty of life, literally relishing each frame of video second by second.
Okay. Enough hyperbole. What's really great about these 8 episodes is that you have the initial working seeds for the entire series. Everything you've got to know about these characters...Fleischman, Maggy, Shelly, Holly, Maurice, Chris, Ed, et al...is right here in these 8 episodes. My favorite episode is the very first appearance of Adam. Watching the interaction between Adam (the recluse hermit and Vet) and Joel (the yuppie doctor) is simply amazing.
I always found myself wanting to kick Joel for being such an ass. But character development is the whole point of Northern Exposure, and it's simply wonderful watching Dr. Fleischman change throughout the series, and how Maggie plays off of this character. I still have the later video where Maggie and Fleischman actually...well, don't let me give away any spoilers if you're new to the series. Trust me, you won't be disappointed.
Finally, STOP BASHING UNIVERSAL!!! People, this DVD set MUST sell in order to give the company a return on its investment. It's all about economy of scale. Not putting Northern Exposure on DVD is a crime. But us not buying this for ourselves and posterity is also a crime. Blame the music companies for sticking it to Universal (and everybody else too). I will grant you that I could have done without the parka packaging; they should have put those dollars into a show guide and DVD labels on 4 DVDs (rather than the two double-sided DVDs, which just makes them more prone to DVD rot if you don't handle with care).
To put Northern Exposure into perspective, I generally like all kinds of genre: action, comedy, fantasy, historical, science fiction, musicals. I would place Northern Exposure at the very top just on its entertainment value alone. The fact that it is also insightful, endearing and intelligent is just amazing.",1086825600,6,3081,4.938342967244702
510649,5,6302763908,"Northern Exposure had a limited first season run as a summer series but these first 8 may be some of the best episodes of the series.  It's a treat to see them here uncut with a few extras that really add to the fun.
Some have complained that only 8 episodes are on these disks but that's explained above.  Some internet talk back and forth provides explanation for some of the complaints you may see in these reviews.
First, the cost is likely due to the fact that the distributors wanted to keep the original music from the show and that adds to the expense of the disks.  This is a problem that apparently has slowed or halted the release of another great series that should be on DVD - WKRP in Cincinnati.  Apparently those producers never gave much thought to releasing these on VHS (some episdoes were on VHS) or DVD and so are now stuck because of the huge cost of the royalties needed to keep the original music played in the series.  Northern Exposure would still be excellent but would not be great without the original music.
Second, why not include both first and second season in one set since both had a limited number of shows made?  Cost is sited as a reason here, too.  However, rumor on the internet has it that Universal will release a set of both seasons some time before the end of the year as soon as the royalty issue can be worked out.  Supposedly, this set will have episode commentary on it as well as other features.  We'll see.
Regardless of these issues, this is a good set and a great show.  There are a few things about the show that, over time, could have improved it immensely.  But I don't want to concentrate on that here.
The story of Dr. Joel Fleischman's exile to Alaska to fulfill the requirements of the loan that put him through med school is the reason for our visit to Cicely, Alaska.  However, the series takes off from there and builds into characters and situations that go beyond Joel's plight.
Rob Morrow is excellent as the good doctor bringing humor and desperation to a character thrown into the unknown and Barry Corbin plays the eccentric Maurice Minnefield, astronaut, visionary and entrepreneur to perfection.  Janine Turner as Maggie is both sexy and tough. John Corbett's Chris is the epitome of the quirky Cicelian character and plays some really eclectic tunes on the radio.  John Cullum plays a terrific Holling Vincoeur, owner of the best tavern/restuarant in town and lover to cute Shelly Tambo (Cynthia Geary).  Geary is good as the young vixen that charmed two older hearts and adds an unusual perspective to the show.  Darren Burrows makes the young native American Ed into a solid character who brings depth to the scenes in which he is featured as the soul of Cicely.  Elaine Miles is a novice actor but that lack of experiene only adds to the charm of her character, Marilyn.  Peg Phillips doesn't have a lot to do as Ruth-Anne at first but creates a realistic character who can be a bit grating but also compassionate.
It's interesting to see some of the deleted scenes that have been added to the disk but the ""gag"" scenes are often priceless and show the cast having fun with a show that was unique and that wasn't guaranteed a time slot when it first came out.
If the rumors are true, it may be better to wait for the combined set.  But if you are like me and couldn't wait to finally see this on DVD buy it now and enjoy a visit to Cicely.",1086825600,4,3412,4.474193548387097
510690,5,6302763908,"I thought I would take the opportunity to correct some erroneous information out there about the new Northern Exposure dvd. It does include the pilot episode, but for whatever reason the dvd's (at least mine) are marked incorrectly. All 8 episodes are on two discs. 2 episodes on each side. The pilot is in fact on Disc 1, side 2 (rather than side 1 as you would expect). I think this error in printing the dvd's has lead some folks to believe that there was no pilot included when in fact there is! Same goes for the second disc. The final episode of season 1 is on disc 2 (side 1) rather than disc 2 side 2 as you would expect. So, you run the risk of not seeing the episodes in the correct order. Having said this, it is fabulous to finally see Northern Exposure again. Can't wait for season 2!",1086566400,8,797,4.25
510691,5,6302763908,"Perhaps I am one of the first true NX diehards to review this DVD. I have owned it since the day it was released, and have watched it multiple times. The bottom line is Northern Exposure represents a zenith in television writing and storytelling. DVD simply brings all the richness and texture this wonderful niche of life deserves. NX is a vacation from the sham and drudgery of our daily lives, and should compel us all to demand more from today's television. After all, isn't that why we watch?
NX gave us 5 years of complex characters and witty banter that is as close to theater as TV can come.
Speaking of demanding, I strongly recommend buying this DVD, but also suggest writing Universal about improving production. There have been multiple complaints, so I went back and reviewed my original CBS series VHS tapes versus the DVD. Here is what I found:
1) The music is all original (Kudos Columbia)
2) No scene's are missing, though some Intro scenes have been moved after the title song (Boo Columbia)
3) The DVD's are mislabeled, and no liner notes (Boo Columbia)
4) Original credits font changed (???)
5) Dobly Surround 2.1 (Boo - c'mon and make this 5.1 if your paying all the royalty fees for the music)
The next DVD can be perfection with a modicum of production improvement. Let me just say that diehards really want the original preserved just as it was, with no changes. Just like classic cars!

first off i sincerely hope that the suggestions made here in these pages actually reach the folks who are in charge of Universal.
some real problems i have with the the treatment:
flipper (2-sided) DVD's
confusing labeling as to which side is which on the disc itself
nothing in the way of numbering each episode...
no episode summaries, original air dates, written/directed by...
i didn't exactly expect commentary, but it would have been a nice extra.
the menus are not user-friendly, in my opinion. after watching an episode, it takes you to the deleted scenes menu, instead of the episode menu. no biggie, but its a bit like going around the elbow to get to the arse.
the parka is a nice novelty. but it's just that: fluff.

510695,4,6302763908,"Northern Exposure is on my shortlist of greatest television shows ever (the other shows on the list being MASH, The British Robin Hood series that starred Michael Praed, The Simpsons, Six Feet Under, and the Simpsons). Therefore I am very happy to finally have the first season on DVD. One only wishes that this great show could have gotten the treatment that its superior quality deserves.
To begin with...even though the first season only comprises eight episodes. And despite the shoddy way the DVD's are put together, this set still warrants acquiring (even if Universal does not deserve money for the product).
Northern Exposure is a series that was ""on"" from the beginning. The Caricaturization so often found in first seasons is almost completely lacking. The plot picks up and takes off.
Most of this is due to one of the greatest ensemble casts of all time (John Cullum and John Corbett lead a long list of my favorites). This cast, wedded with excellent writing, made Northern Exposure a truly transcendent show from the very beginning.
Why then the crappy treatment?
I don't mind the parka-packaging. However, I would willingly trade it to not have to deal with flipper discs and previews I am forced to fast-forward through rather than skip. It is even more annoying that there is not a printed list of which episodes are on which discs (this could confuse some--particularly with the flipper discs).
Sixty bucks is a bit much to shell out for something as poorly put together as this DVD set. Yet, the episodes are worth acquiring--any way you can.
I recommend these episodes. I also heartily recommend someone at Universal pull their heads out of wherever they stuck it.

Second, they only give you two poorly labeled discs, no insert or booklet about the show its creation, or at least the chapter breaks, nothing! Third, the alleged ""hours of extras"" which are said to contain deleted scenes and hilarious outtakes are lumped together per episode, with no indication of what it contains.
It's obvious to me that the idiots at Universal spent more time and thought on designing the lame little orange parka that contains the discs than on the presentation of the discs themselves. I have seen $9.95 anthologies of Beverly Hillbillies that looked far better and give much more to the buyer than this pathetic mess.

The discs are also double-sided, which is made even more of a pain because they're incorrectly labelled (the labels should be on the opposite side to the data, but here they aren't). Worse there's no inlay or episode list, so you have to be very careful you watch them in the right order.

Mr. Thomas from Clawson is unfortunately not correct when he writes that Universal is lying about music rights issues. Yes, the videos that were released in the 90's cost much less, but music rights issues were not as complicated back then as they are now. DVD is SOOO popular that the struggling music industry is desperately trying to piggy-back on the success of the format.  That leaves shows like this up the proverbial creek. When Northern Exposure was made and all the music licensed, there was no option in contracts for such continual repackaging beyond videocassettes. With this DVD release, Universal has had to go and re-license all the music.  That is definitely why the set is so expensive. Personally, I think it is worth it.

My only disappointment was the number of episodes it contained. If the idea of putting in only 8 episodes was to make me gasp for more, it worked. But I'm used to getting more for my buck, and 8 episodes was really expensive. I know I'm hooked already, and I can't wait for the all the rest of the episodes to make it onto dvd, but I can imagine the price I'll have to pay to catch it all if every dvd comes with only 7-8 episodes.

When I unwrapped the  DVD and subsequently unzipped the packaing I opened the case, and much to my surprise and dissapointment I found no insert ,  I thought at first this was a mistake, but then when I put in the DVD to see they had mislabeled the discs, And I saw the menu layout I realized it was no mistake, it was a sign of shoddy craftsmanship
As a person who authors DVD's for a living I know how simple it is to make a ONE and it really takes someone who just does not care or an absolute nimrod to a make a DVD this bad.
Presentation really is everything in this buisness and Universal has shown their true colors with this product, they care nothing for the show only ripping people off.
All of this I can forgive , but be forewarned I have only watched three of the episodes and so far two of them have left off the first establishing 3 minute intro before the credtis. THIS IS UNBELIEVEABLE!!! and  anyone who knows the show understands why this is an atrocity.

I recently read in my daily newspaper that the price for this set is so high because Universal had to pay for all the rights for the music in the show. If you remember, the show had alot of nice and quirky music that added to the appeal of the show. Universal obviously decided to retain the original music of the show instead of replacing it with something else. I for one am glad they went this way and I hope they retain this position. My opinion is that if you want the rest of the series to come out, make sure to support this release.",1086048000,2,777,4.019354838709678
510734,3,6302763908,Can't give it any more stars.....not because of the quality...but the price.  I see where someone makes comments that the reason for the high price is the ammount of royalty Universal had to pay for the music rights......this doesn't make sense.  A few years ago Universal released a dozen titles on VHS and they didn't overcharge for those because of music royalty.  In fact those Northern Exposure titles were all priced in line with any other VHS on the market.  There is no excuse other then plain greed...greed....greed....and a stupid collectors packet that I will probably through away anyway because it doesn't fit on my shelf with other DVD's in my library.  Why Universal has to lie and make excuses for overcharging is annoying......it isn't because of the music rights...that is for sure.,1086048000,5,800,4.984962406015038
510763,5,6302763908,"I have waited many years for this series to come to DVD, and it has been worth the wait.  I agree with the price being high for just 8 episodes, but I also agree that some things are worth the extra bucks.  However, I really would have liked to have a booklet explaining the episodes, dates, etc.... maybe for the next season?  I liked the parka, but if that means sacrificing the booklet of info, then I can do without.... I hope we don't have to wait a long time for the next season.",1085961600,3,485,4.138297872340425
510764,5,6302763908,"Northern Exposure is, quite simply, one of the greatest television shows ever produced.  I do, however, disagree with at least one reviewer who referred to the first season as the best and only one of true importance.  One of the interesting things about watching the first episodes of NE, as is the case with any enduring series, is studying early character development.  The actors experiment with line delivery and ways to allow their characters to emote.  Opinions and attitudes are expressed in ways far more blunt and obvious than they would ever need to be again.  Subsequent seasons fleshed out the characters, making them even richer and more textured.  That being said, a better foundation could not have been layed than that of NE's debut season.
Quirky is a word used far too often in the description of NE.  It always seemed to diminish what the show had achieved with it's brilliant writing, outstanding acting and overall creative innovation.  But, by deviation as it's definition, quirky, as it turns out, is the perfect description.  Northern Exposure managed to successfully deviate from the dreck that dominated television at the time it aired, before and since.
I hope the rest of the seasons are released soon, sans the parka and with the addition of at least a modest booklet giving us original airing dates, etc...
I would subtract a star for poor packaging and the labeling error, but the show is simply too good.  As for the price, I am more than willing to pay it if it means keeping the original soundtracks intact.  Comparing the price of Northern Exposure to ER really isn't fair.  The studios and the retail market, of course, anticipate much, much larger sales for a show like ER.  This gives a chain like Best Buy the confidence to buy in bulk, receiving a sizable discount for doing so, and passing  the savings on to the customer.  Like it or not, NE never enjoyed the fan base of a Felicity (which, from what I read, had to hack up it's soundtrack in order to keep it's production costs low).  This is the price that we as NE fans quite literally have to pay for having taste.  Let's just hope that the record labels cut the show a break and that we don't wind up spending more for a full length season of NE than we did on our DVD players.",1085961600,2,2275,4.619402985074627

510766,5,6302763908,"NX is a fantastic show.  The extras are super.  And most importantly the music appears to be intact - please understand how key this is.  Other shows I enjoy (though not as much as NX!) such as Felicity, Roswell, etc have all been released to DVD with different/inferior music.  It's jarring to see classic scenes with different music (usually sloppily mixed btw).  I haven't made it through all 8 episodes yet, but if the music is intact throughout it is well worth the money.  I'd gladly pay $10 an episode for NX up through when Joel left.
Appreciate what we have here, folks, and the integrity of the producers to stick by their commitment to deliver the episodes intact (not the re-run butcher edits or with different music).  I still need to do some comparisons with my VCR tapes to make sure they didn't use the syndication edits - but I'm betting they didn't.  Because they're doing it right.
Buy these and buy them again and let's make sure they put every season out.
Name me a show on television now that looks, sounds, and feels this good.  Great writing, acting, directing, etc.  What more do you want?!!  Pay for it.  Quality costs money.  Reward quality with your money, so that the entertainment world will make more quality shows like this vs what we've been getting recently.
In the current environment this show would have been cancelled after only a few episodes.",1085875200,6,1382,4.661157024793388
510767,4,6302763908,"While the quality of the show is outstanding, I have two bones to pick with those that produced it.  First, they mislabeled disc one, the side labeled ""Disc One, Side One"" is actually ""Disc One, Side Two.""  This caused us to watch it out of order.  The second is the advertising that it is the ""Complete First Season,"" and while this is technically true, no where on the packaging (either exterior of interior) does it state that there were only 8 episodes on the first season.  So, to have paid full retail price for only 8 episodes seems unfair(I bought The West Wing, Season 2, at the same time, at the same price as NX, and The West Wing had more than 14 episodes on it, and they didn't go the cheap way of bundling everying on the front and back of the discs.
While I love this show, the goofy packaging doesn't make up for the fact that I feel ripped off.

510768,3,6302763908,"It's wonderful to have Joel, Maggie,Chris, Maurice, Ruth Ann, Ed, the Brick gang and the Moose available on DVD. They've made us wait a long, long time for it. Many have commented on the excellence of this series, and they're right. That said, let's examine the faults of this DVD. What cynicism prompted makers of this DVD to include no insert to tell us about the series or, at the very least, what episodes are on which disk? What made them include ineradicable promos for shows in which many of us have no interest and will have to fast forward through forever? What made them think that charging $45 or more for eight episodes with the above deficiencies was ethical or moral or even good business? This DVD was put together by people who apparently have no concept of the spirit of this show and know only the greed of trying to bilk lovers of NE of more for less. Why didn't they at least provide a decent combined package of the early episodes to make it a reasonable value? As much as I love ""Northern Exposure"", this makes me want to boycott future releases if this is the way they intend to treat the fans. The cheesy parka the DVD comes in doesn't cover the multitude of sins the makers of this DVD have committed. They should be ashamed of themselves. OK, I'm a person who thinks there should still be decency in this world. Sue me.
The fact remains that this is a series that had some of the best writing and character acting ever to be on television. Episodes are profound, lyrical, lighthearted, mystical,  and tragic by turn and sometimes, miraculously, at the same time. It is an artistic and entertainment tour de force which shouldn't be interrupted by commercials or ""previews"". ""Northern Exposure"" deserves to be released by some company that respects it for the jewel it is instead of one whose greed and crassness take so much of the joy out of finally having some epiosodes on DVD.

Obviously this is great to see again, and it will take you right back to watching it the first time.

510843,5,6302763908,"As most of you who are interested in buying this set already know, Northern Exposure is a great television show.  The sharp intelligence of its creators is evident in every aspect of the production: from the characters to the wonderful music.  The DVD set features amazing visual quality, nice extras and ALL THE SONGS FROM THE ORIGINAL BROADCASTS.  This is no small feat.  Remember, there are great shows from the same era released on DVD (i.e. Wiseguy, Felicity, etc.) that have not been able to secure rights to songs that were crucial to their original success.  Northern Exposure is more dependent on the original soundtrack than other shows.  For example, during a single episode included in this set, ""A Kodiak Moment,"" the music ranges wide: from an aria from Verdi's ""Rigoletto"" to ""Rhinestone Cowboy"" by Glen Campbell to Shep & The Limelights' ""Daddy's Home."" All that in one episode, and it's all here on DVD. Yeah, it's an expensive set. But Universal should be praised for taking the time to do right by the show, especially for spending the money to secure the music.  That is what we, as consumers, are paying for and it is worth it.  Wait a couple of months until the set is discounted, but please do not let the price of this set sway you from owning a wonderful piece of television history.",1085616000,37,1308,4.706140350877193

And as much as I loved this series, I can't recommend it in this state until the producers vow to restore the soundtrack to its broadcast condition. I guess licensing and copyright costs were just too much, so subtleties of mood and atmosphere are forever lost to viewers of these DVDs.

I got up and flipped it, and got my pilot, and the first couple of episodes.  It is great to see the old episodes, and in high quality DVD.  I am upset that they don't have it in widescreen, so it is a pain b/c I have to take my DVD player out of progressive scan, and re-configure my TV to play the old and outdated 4:3, I mean, they did film it, so they should have been able to put it in widescreen.

510846,3,6302763908,"I can't help feeling cheaped off with this one - the dvds themselves are blank, shiny silver except for the tiny inner ring label.  Episodes 3 and 4 are on side 1 of disc 1, so it's a safe bet that were no rocket scientists involved in the production process.  The plastic dvd case is devoid of any booklet or insert, where's the episode list or liner notes?  Just a little something to say thanks for blowing 50 bucks would have been ok - they didn't even bother to put some advertisement flyers in there.  The little parka zipper case is damn cute, if gimmicky.
So with that said, the transfer is effing beautiful, it's glorious to see the episodes in broadcast+ quality... and that's what really matters.  The extra features and deleted scenes are great to see, I can't say how much I appreciate that they took the time to dig them up and include them.
Is it worth the 40+ bucks?  It really seems like it while you're watching, but as soon as you take the dvd out to put it back in the case, that sour taste creeps back into your mouth... like maybe you've been had a little.  Considering the number of episodes and the total running time (features included), it really is hard to see how they came to the conclusion that 60 bucks was a good starting price tag to slap on.  If Universal tries to pull the same stunt with (mini)Season Two, I'm afraid that sales will be so weak that they will scrap plans to put out any more seasons.  I can't see a lot of people falling for the same trick twice, especially after they've already gotten a fix.",1085529600,8,1545,4.336805555555555

And Universal wants to charge me that much for the *eight* NX first season episodes?  Not in this life, fellas.  I'll just rent the NX shows, recognizing that this could damage the prospects of further Northern Exposure releases.

Why couldn't they have combined this set with the second season (which was only seven episodes long), the way the first two seasons of Homicide were combined?
I will hold off on buying this until I see a price drop or some sort of sale.

Well, not quite.  As perhaps an obsessive viewer of the show, one of the things I noticed while watching the First Season on DVD was the absence of certain background music.  As the two CD soundtracks reflect, ""Northen Exposure"" was a superb venue for diverse, expressive and sometimes downright fun music.  Unfortunately, it appears that the creators of the DVD were not able to secure the rights to some of those songs for reproduction on DVD.  It is a slight detail, but one that I noticed.  Many of the scenes are made by the music.  Now, some of those scenes have a different feel to them.

$5.25/episdoe for Season 1 of Northern Exposure (8 episodes)
$3.82/episode for Seasons 1 and 2 of Homicide (13 episodes)

510951,4,6302763908,"Almost since the show began airing, I have been a fan of Northern Exposure.  I made several trips to Roslyn, WA to watch filming (I even talked to John Corbett once!) and I used to buy everything and anything related to the show.  In fact, it was more than TV to me, it represented a philosophy, an ideal way of life.  I loved the depth and diversity of the characters, their interactions with one another, how they approached life and its conundrums with a certain wonder and intelligence...  No TV show has ever portrayed human beings with such care and attention to what makes us essentially human.  I'm glad that some episodes will finally be available on DVD (I have every one taped, but the quality is poor and degrading fast...)  However, it seems a misnomer to call this set the 'first season.'  I was under the impression that the first eight episodes were a mid-season trial run, not an official season.  It would have been better to package these with the real first season.  Oh, well... Kesho, Cicely!",1082851200,5,1013,4.614525139664805
510952,5,6302763908,"I've never seen an American show such as this. It's simply brilliant, it protraits almost every human behaviour, and it teaches a lot of lessons. And it finally arrives as a DVD pack! I don't know if anyone with direct contact with the DVD-makers reads this, but if they do, try do bring the show in DVD to Europe! I'm a buyer, that's for sure. I totally recommend ""Northern Exposure"", it's definitely a winner.",1081814400,9,411,4.5675675675675675
510953,5,6302763908,"My favorite show (and I grew up with TV).  There has not been another show,(before or since)that has captured my imagination like Northern Exposure.  This is a real entertainment value at twice the cost!  I encourage fans of the series to purchase a copy.  (It would make a great gift too!) The success of this DVD will influence the studio's decision about releasing the remaining seasons on DVD.  Buy it!  Enjoy it!  Spread the word! Please!",1081209600,7,443,4.75

I have waited so long for this, and I can't wait to receive my shipment of the first season.  If you have never experienced Northern Exposure, this is one DVD collection that you will absolutely love.  I am hoping that the other seasons will soon follow the release of the first one.  This is my favorite all-time show.  The characters made me want to move to Cicely Alaska to live with them!  I have seen every episode muliple times, and I never grow tired of watching it.  Northern Exposure was a really great show that will be awesome in DVD.  You will not be disappointed if you purchase this series.  You will be an instant fan!",1081123200,6,720,4.353383458646617
510955,5,6302763908,"I can't quite express how happy I am knowing that episodes of ""Northern Exposure"" will be released on DVD. I remember coming across the show quite by accident in late summer 1990. I had been a big ""Twin Peaks"" fan that year and when I saw ""Northern Exposure's"" beautiful scenery, intelligent storylines and quirky characters I knew I'd come home. As much as I loved Agent Dale Cooper and the Log Lady, I felt more comfortable hanging out with disc jockey/philosopher Chris in the Morning and Native American filmmaker Ed Chigliak. It was a hip show with a heart. And in 1993 I nearly took a job working on the set in Roslyn, Washington. I sure wish I had gone ahead and done that.
Is it just me or do you get chills remembering that scene where Holling buries the remains of Jesse the Bear as Enya's ""Caribbean Blue"" plays. If a show can affect you in that sort of way you know it's a classic.
I hope Universal will released the entire series, even the ones with Dr. Capra (Paul Provenza) and Mike ""BubbleMan"" Monroe (Anthony Edwards). I'll buy 'em all. My tapes are falling apart!",1081123200,11,1081,4.49238578680203

Despite the intially high price, it is great that the series is finally being released.  I ordered this for $55 CDN on Amazon.ca, but then immediately cancelled the order and reordered the next day when the price had dropped to less than half the price.  Hopefully the remaining seasons will be releases soon with similarly low prices.  We cannot wait to have the complete collection on DVD.",1079481600,,570,4.6138613861386135

I agree that the cost is rather excessive...but...I don't want to wait another 9 or 10 years till they decide to put these excellent episodes on DVD format. I will probably be more than willing to shell out the cash to get these DVDs as the are released. In my 30+ years of television viewing this has to be one of the best programs ever to grace the small screen. Hopefully they will release the whole cosmic enchilada and I won't be short a season when I'm done collecting. Time has done justice to this show. It seems to appeal to me more as the years go by. It is a shame it only lasted a few years. Big things come in small packages I guess. As Marilyn would say, ""Yes!""",1079222400,12,825,4.130434782608695
511018,5,6302763908,"Certainly not the best deal in television series boxed sets, but this collection of the first 8 episodes of Northern Exposure is long overdue.  This was one of the most original shows on television but it is Joshua Brand and John Falsey who should be given top billing.  They were the creators of this marvelous series, which spanned between 1990 and 1995.  The thought provoking stories, razor sharp humor and wonderful backdrop (Washington not Alaska) set Northern Exposure apart from anything being produced at the time.  Even still it had a hard time gaining ground, not enjoying a full season until its third year.  The characters are memorable, ranging from Dr. Fleischman's quirky secretary Marilyn Whirlwind (who has only fleeting appearances in the first season) to the former astronaut  Maurice J. Minnifield who essentially bankrolled Cicely on the fortune he amassed after his days in NASA.  The stage is beautifully set in these two discs, but it would seem to me that they could have included the second season as well, making it more worth its price.  ...",1078531200,11,1070,4.97191011235955

If I had 3 wishes, one of them would be for Cicily to be a real town, with these people, and me living right there amongst 'em!  I'd like to give Joel a little competition for Mary Margaret!  I feel like I know all of these people.  I've been asked many times, which of these characters could this show do without.  I would have to say, none of them!

511053,5,6302763908,"In these glorious days of season DVD releases of television series, ""Northern Exposure"" is a very welcome addition.  The premise is lifted out of the situation comedy handbook - a new doctor is forced to practice in a remote Alaskan village to pay off a medical school scholarship.  At the surface, it sounds like a collision course with wackiness.
Fortunately, we are spared the cheap shots this premise suggests.  Dr. Fleischman (Rob Morrow) is indeed a fish out of water, but we don't see him struggling with his furnace or complaining about the harsh environment (at least not very much.)  Rather, the tension of this series relates to his attempt to practice medicine in a community filled with bizarre and wonderful characters.
There is an ex-astronaut attempting to create a media empire in this remote community.  He owns a radio station featuring a DJ more interested in philosophy than spinning records or reporting the weather. The town eatery is owned by an ex-trapper living with a woman 1/3 of his age.
Of all of the characters Dr. Fleischman contends with, the best by far is his receptionist.  Marilyn Whirlwind (Elaine Miles) is a rare actress who can emote without saying a word or lifting an eyebrow.  In fact, ""Northern Exposure"" is a rare series that is not afraid to effectively use a moment of silence to underscore a dramatic point.
The show is funny, but not in an obnoxious or obvious fashion. The characters are warm and richly drawn.  Actually, it is a happy surprise that this show lasted as long as it did.  We are fortunate that it has come to DVD to enjoy new life.  A well-enhanced DVD presentation will hopefully add extras, commentary, and other goodies to enhance this fine series.
Strongly recommended.",1077148800,22,1739,4.844594594594595

When I first watched NE I couldn't make up my mind whether I liked it or not. In a short period of time I became an avid viewer and a big fan of the show about the people and the town named Cicely, Alaska.
It will be good to watch Holling,Ed,Maurice,Maggie,Joel and all the other folks who lived in or past through NE on DVD format.

Evne though i only watched about 10 episodes before it was pulled I feel in love with the characters and the town.
But Universal has made a major mistake.  Other Studios (Fox, Warner Brothers, Columbia) are releasing Season sets with 20 to 30 episodes at 60 dollars a piece (at most stores 40), but Universal is planning on giving us 8 episodes at the same price!  Thats a Little expensive.  If it had been the complete First and Second Season it would be another story, but its not.  Bad judgement called on Universals part.

Hopefully the sales are good; good enough to send a message to those who create these types of shows that this is what the viewing public wants: smart, witty, intelligent television.
The casting to me was perfect, especially Rob Morrow as Joel and Janine Turner as Maggie. The story lines were a little odd at times, but they worked and gave the show character.  Each hour show was a little ""dramedy"" unto itself.
Eventually the show's popularity got the better of it, egos flared, and like all good things, it came to and end.  At least there were three good seasons, this first season being one of the best.

Fans have been eagerly awaiting this news since the July '03 report from USA Today that it was in-the-works. Today, TVShowsOnDVD is pleased to tell you that Northern Exposure - The Complete 1st Season will arrive on DVD this May 25th.
The series premiered with a short 8-episode run in the Summer of 1990, an hour long ""dramedy"" about a Jewish doctor (played by Rob Morrow) who's deal to get paid up for medical school meant he had to go where he was assigned...in Alaska, since the state was the source of the money. Dr. Joel Fleischman is assigned in the end to Cicely, Alaska, a town full of strange but lovable characters including former astronaut Maurice J. Minnifield (Barry Corbin), a radio D.J. (""Chris in the Morning"", played by John Corbett) with a strange outlook on life, Ed Chigliak (Darren Burrows )...and Maggie O'Connell, of course, played by co-star Janine Turner.
Universal Home Video announced the DVD release of the debut season this morning, on a 2-disc (double-sided ""DVD-14"") set running at 384 minutes. List price is $59.98 for this set, which comes in a special limited-edition ""Parka"" packaging that is sure to be a collectible item. 4x3 video and English Dolby Surround Sound represent the original over-the-air presentation of this show, and on the DVD you also get French and Spanish subtitles to choose from. The discs are closed captioned for the hearing impaired, too.
With such a short season, Universal didn't want to disappoint the fans with too short a DVD release, so they are adding some nice bonus material to this box set. Look for these extras:
Deleted Scenes
Video Documentary Footage
Mock Movie Footage
""Unexposed"" Footage
This is a long-awaited, highly-anticipated release that fans have been clamoring for. Universal has delivered with a set that is sure to please everyone. Stay tuned, because we'll be back soon with pictures of the ""Parka packaging"" cover art.",1076976000,94,1932,5.003105590062112

Having had DVD for two years now, I just can't watch VHS or broadcast TV anymore.  Apart from the obvious video quality and sound issues, the incredible ease of navigation and repetition abilities of DVD's make VHS tapes more obsolete to DVD's than dinosaurs are to humans; it is that drastic a quality difference!
