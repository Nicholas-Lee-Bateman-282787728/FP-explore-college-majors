8289785,2,B001CUBAV0,"So far, I really like this series ""Intervention.""  By watching others struggle, I really think viewers can examine themselves and work on self-improvement.  But this particular episode tested my limits.
One of the guys, Michael, physically abuses his family members.  I had never heard of rage addiction, but his drug use was obviously fueling that problem.  At one point, when his father wouldn't obey him, Michael started punching him.  For those who believe ""Honor Thy Parents,"" it will be incredibly difficult to watch.  His family had legal grounds to have him arrested, pulled from the home, and facing a battery charge, yet he kept on being violent.  I wish someone could sit him down and tell him how much jail time he could do for getting physical.  He seemed like a very undeserving individual.
The other guy Adam was less of a problem.  However, he cursed out his younger sister something terrible.  When a dealer wouldn't supply him, he used a homophobic epithet out loud.  He wants to work in Hollywood and I don't see how documented bigotry is going to help him in the business.
It's one thing to con folk for money or steal, but the actions I saw here were appalling.  Both of these dudes need to learn ""you reap what you sow.""  In fairness, my discomfort with this episode may have helped me to grown.  There are addicts who are only hurting themselves and there are addicts that hurt others and really need a spanking from their parents.  I am still struggling with dividing ""the good ones"" from ""the bad ones.""
Overall, this episode was the most eery to me.  I hope others won't be biased against this amazing series due to this one example.",1293321600,,1659,4.688581314878893
