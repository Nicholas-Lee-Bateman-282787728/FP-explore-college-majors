Some of his jokes may come off too quirky (some of my friends were somewhat offended by his representations of Japanese people for example) but you can tell he doesn't mean anything by it.

3421685,4,B0018Y5NVI,"I was excited when Amazon added Food Network shows to the Instant Video collection, especially so for ""Good Eats"". The show is quirky and is not your stuffy cooking show. The mini-skits and the characters (portrayed by about 4 different actors) will make you chuckle and the science demos are very enlightening. I find myself applying the principles taught in the episodes to many aspects of my cooking. The recipes vary from traditional, with slight embellishments, to the slightly off-beat (i.e avocado icing). I have a background in science, yet my non-science nerd family members also enjoy this show just as much. I highly recommend to anyone who is interested in cooking science and likes to have fun in the kitchen.",1381708800,,722,4.975206611570248

3421697,5,B0018Y5NVI,"I found Good Eats in 2001 as a bachelor that wanted something to take me from frozen dinners to home cooked goodness that went beyond the old family staples. So I started watching cooking shows. Pretty soon I found Good Eats. At first I was surprised at the odd presentation, but after one episode I had scheduled a Tivo season pass...

Now over a decade later I still find it practical and informing. Unlike other cooking shows he explains what is happening and shows enough variation that I'm not afraid to deviate from the instructions with good results.",1379462400,,557,4.683673469387755

3421702,5,B0018Y5NVI,"I have to say that I love Alton Brown's style and the background work that goes into the show. The campy skits, the history and science behind the dishes, ingredients, and cooking for each show really draw me in! If you love details and little kernels of knowledge about the food you're cooking, I doubt you will have anything but love in your heart for Alton and the Good Eats show. Sitting here racking my brain for negatives, there really are not any that I can pinpoint.

My wife cares much less than I do about how things work and shows less of an interest in watching Good Eats than I do, so I know the show will not tickle everyone's fancy. I love it.",1378598400,,658,4.264

3421709,5,B0018Y5NVI,"I've been watching Good Eats since season 1.  At that time, Emeril was probably the most popular chef on Food Network and though I watched some of those shows, the one thing that was consistently disappointing is that Emeril's show was more about entertainment than it was about showing *how* to make something.

Enter Good Eats and things change drastically.  Not only do you now know how to make a particular recipe, but you might just understand everything about how the recipe works and why it gives a particular result.  With that knowledge, you can now change it up any way you want and the results are still predictable.  Alton didn't sacrifice the entertainment value of the program, either.  As the seasons have passed, his ability to provide engaging characters and some pretty impressive video transitions/effects has only improved.

If only there were more shows like this.  I'm sick and tired of shows that might show a technique pretty well, but then don't give you ingredient amounts (go to our website, sacrifice your email address for the recipe is the usual way that works) -or- those shows that seek to entertain rather than educate.  This show has it all.  My only complaint is against Amazon not having all of the seasons - even if they weren't free, I'd buy them.",1377302400,,1285,4.8

3421737,5,B0018Y5NVI,"I got tired of cable/satellite/network TV years ago, finally ""cut the cord"" in 2008 and just use the web for news/entertainment. The ONLY thing that prevented me from doing that even sooner was Good Eats, one of the most intelligent and entertaining food shows ever created.

So--happy day--got a tweet that it was now available on Amazon Prime and settled in for a Season 12 marathon last weekend. It was wonderful. Lots of good information, no pretense, and the recipes are lovely, made even better by the explanations of WHY such and such ingredient is incorporated in exactly this way.

I have only a couple of gripes--I'd like to see ALL the episodes available at a good package price; I'll watch them over and over. And (this isn't about the show but rather Amazon Prime, or maybe Apple), I'd like to be able to view this on something bigger than my iPhone or iPad. The iPad apparently won't pass a Kindle/Amazon Prime HD signal through an HDMI port, which is disappointing.",1373328000,,980,4.7251461988304095

3421755,5,B0018Y5NVI,"This show doesn't need a long review. It's nearly perfect. It's Mr. Wizard meets Julia Childs, with a rich Monty Python reduction sauce. You'll learn both the ""how-to"" and the ""how-come?"" of cooking. He teaches the science of food, the skill and techniques you'll need, and is also very informative on the proper hardware and utensils you'll need. He even occasionally teaches you how to build some of the equipment for things that aren't worth buying! Fun!

In conclusion, this show is the best cooking show and watching it together has done wonders for my wife and I's abilities in the kitchen.",1369785600,12,596,4.8431372549019605
