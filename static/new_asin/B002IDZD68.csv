They do classics like ""model worker"" ""because you're frightened"" ""motorcade"" etc. Devoto even mentions the late, legendary guitarist John McGeoch before ""rhythm of cruelty"". Also a smoking version of ""shot by both sides"". 18 songs from the Manchester performance as well as clip of ""a song from under the floorboards"" from London and a rehearsal of ""feed the enemy"". Plus a bonus live cd. Awesome! I only wish they had done ""back to nature"" and ""give me everything"". Oh well, you cant have everything!",1394496000,2,672,5.063063063063063
8370830,5,B002IDZD68,"Great news!. But the last record, No thyself, isn't at the level for Magazine. Anyway it's a pleasure to meet an old friends. All the video get a greal level but it's a pity to see Howard with these awful trousers. Highy recommended anyway. Great packaged.",1334275200,2,256,4.586956521739131
8370831,5,B002IDZD68,"I am devoted to Magazine. Led by the wonderful Howard Devoto, Magazine delivered a sequence of fantastic albums in the late 70s/early 80s. The attitude of punk, music influenced by the Eno of Low and Heroes era, with the lyrical brilliance of a Bob Dylan in a difficult mood. Howard has an unusual singing style, something of an acquired taste. Perhaps in a similar way to Bob Dylan, you wouldn't say he has a great voice, but he is a great singer in terms of impact, delivery, and conviction. I love all five original Magazine albums: Real Life (1978),  Secondhand Daylight (1979), The Correct Use of Soap  (1980), Play (1981) and Magic, Murder and the Weather (1981). I play them regularly. Now, in 2009, after 28 years of doing various other things, they have reformed for a modest number of concerts. Reviews have been stellar, and looking at this DVD, you can see why. They are absolutely magnificent. The show is beautifully recorded and filmed. The band plays an excellent selection of their songs. Watching it I could hardly believe that I was seeing it for real, after so long without any new Magazine product. I only wish I could have been there. In interviews, Howard hasn't ruled out the possibility of recording a new album. Yes please!",1255392000,13,1249,4.724770642201835
