3528840,3,B001DE647U,My grandchildren love all the Shirley Temple movies. I just feel they are terribly over priced. I may just buy the set rather than renting them.,1373760000,,144,4.576923076923077
3528841,5,B001DE647U,"This classical story portrayed by darling Ms. Temple has always been one of my favorites. I rented it for my girls to watch and they sort of enjoyed it, unfortunately it was a little too slow for these modern kids used to being constantly pelted with images and action. Plus, they thought Shirley looked sort of funny with her fake teeth... oh well. All that aside this is a great Shirley Temple movie and the story's adaptation is well done.",1359331200,,442,4.5375

3528843,4,B001DE647U,This was definitely made for deeply discouraged people during hard times.  All the actors elevate it far higher than what's on the script.  The hateful school headmistress and her servants do an especially good job of creating sympathy for other characters.  The loose and relaxed song and dance routines stand out as extremely joyful islands in an otherwise somber plot.  I will try more of her movies now.,1345420800,,407,4.9411764705882355

3528866,3,B001DE647U,"The Little Princess, 1939 film

This story is set in 1899 England. It shows the unique London Bridge and other sites. Queen Victoria rules Imperial England. Kilt wearing Scots troops march, the Boer War began. Why are they sending so many soldiers to a little war? asks Sarah. Her father will go to South Africa, his daughter to Miss Minchins Seminary. This is one of the most exclusive schools in London. Is there room for Sarah? Her fathers wealth and family ensure Sarahs acceptance. The other girls meet her. Sarah lost her mother. She says goodbye to her father, and cries. Sarah has a problem with buttoning her shoes. There is a change in position at the dining table.

There is a letter for Sarah from her father with bad news. Outside there is a parade of Volunteers who will go to South Africa to raise the siege at Mafeking. Lord Wigham complains about his nephew, Mr. Jeffrey, who volunteered for the war. Sarah talks to Miss Minchin. Jeffrey married Rose but it must remain secret. Casualty lists are posted, the good news is the relief of Mafeking! Sarah has a birthday party, gifts are exchanged. Captain Crewe has died, his property confiscated by the enemy. Sarah is penniless! What will happen to poor Sarah now? She cries, her status is changed, so too her room and dress. Sarah is now a serving girl like Becky. Rose is discharged. Lord Wigham is informed of his nephews relationship. Bert joined the army. Sarah goes to a military hospital and visits their wards.

The life of a servant girl is hard. The hospital has a new patient, he suffers from memory loss after malaria. His identity is unknown. At night Sarah has a fantastic dream. She awakes to warmth, food, and clothing. Miss Minchin accuses her of theft! Sarah runs to that military hospital. Visitors are kept out, there is a Royal visit. The Queen commands, Sarah will visit all the wards. Will she find her father? She sees Rose with Jeffrey, he was injured in an accident. A wounded man calls for Sarah. But his memory is bad. [A sentimental scene.] The sight of Sarah restores his memory! They all salute as the Queen passes.

This movie was designed for the Anglophone market, a Hollywood movie set in England with many English actors. The Boer War initially went against the British army. The Boers resisted the invasion by the British (was there gold in their lands?). No mention of German forces in Southwest Africa and their imperial ambitions. It was adapted from the novel by Frances Hodgson Burnett. Films are made from organic substances and will deteriorate over time; this one was not restored.",1464652800,,2592,4.71523178807947

3528877,5,B001DE647U,"I've seen this film many times, including with my children .  I love it and I love Shirley Temple.  What a remarkable talent at such an early age.  This film was in color and while I don't often agree with the decision to colorize in this case it added to the story.  It touches a lot of emotional issues for Shirley,  Mother deceased, father in the military, leaving India to fight in the Boer War which required Shirley to adjust to  a new environment a boarding school in London with a great reputation but owned by a not-very-sympathetic woman.  Of course Shirley meets all the problems confronting her in the best possible ways and becomes a friend of the other adults in the house, and two others nearby. who are very supportive.

3529009,4,B001DE647U,"I grew up watching A Little Princess from 1995, so I wanted to see this version, especially since Shirley Temple is in it. It was a good movie, but I like the interpretation in the 1995 version more. In this one it was all about Sarah and it doesn't really introduce the other characters. I like the music from the 1995 movie more than this one. In this movie they just show up to the school, but in the one from '95 there's more of a background to the story.",1396396800,,459,4.111111111111111

Highly recommend buying the black and white whoch also has a color option.  This one on Itunes is also a bit fuzzy as I saw on its trailer.  Think poor quality bought videos ought to be returnable within a couple of minutes, even if watched a bit which is when the poor quality can be seen.
