The review who said the movie was awful made me laugh, it's the worst film of all time on purpose.  It was supposed to be bad. Kudos to the film makers for taking the time to make this a classic.

I was expecting something like 'Machete', but it was a really lame parody of action movies. I certainly wouldn't but this. I'm just glad I rented it instead and could return it.

They made no attempt to disguise the use of the same pool when Mr. Sorbo was allegedly cleaning multiple pools--unless, since I am in a rainy state, I simply don't know that all of the pools in California have the same pattern around the edge.  There was both male and female frontal nudity so the frats would love that.  The funniest part of the movie was when one of Mr. Trejo's minions was trying to tell him which of Mr. Trejo's brothers Mr. Sorbo had killed. When he didn't guess the brother's name on the first or second try, he finally tells the gent to tell him the man's name because he has 14 brothers!  When he was told the name he said, ""Oh, that's too bad, he was my 9th favorite brother.""  Still it was funny seeing Mr. Sorbo as a totally clueless caricature and Mr. Trejo in another funny role.",1400112000,,936,4.381502890173411

4979134,1,B0068MNO02,I ordered this one because I really liked Machete with Danny Trejo.  I found this one totally dumb and not entertaining.

4979136,4,B0068MNO02,"Kevin Sorbo came to Origins Gaming Convention in June.  I brought him Bitch Slap to autograph.  He said if I liked that movie, then I had to get this one.  So far, I've bought 2 copies.  I really need to get a 3rd for lending purposes.  Anyway, this movie is Funny.  I mean like spit take funny, if you're the one doing the spit take.  Humor bar is just above amoeba level.  There isn't ONE thing here that is politically correct.  Slang descriptions of everyone is used so if you're easily offended, tough.  Move on.  The action sequences are very badly choreographed & meant to be.  One fight scene, had they shot it correctly would've looked fantastic.  But, due to the camera placement, the punches are coming about 2' short of hitting anything.  Again, done on purpose.  Stereotypes galore.  Violence, nudity, 2nd grade humor with an adult slant, liberal cherry picking of story lines from other movies, more nudity & the ""director's"" commentary popping up through out the entire thing.  That last thing annoyed me which is why it's not a 5 star movie.  Get it.  It's worth it.",1374105600,5,1082,4.62962962962963

4979139,4,B0068MNO02,"I watched this movie with my friend a few hours ago, and it was awesome. It was very dirty, racist, sexy, and my style of comedy. This is a movie within a movie where director Saint James St. James tells how 'Poolboy II' was deemed too terrible to release. Kevin Sorbo stars as a Vietnam Veteran named Sal Bando. After the war, Sal comes home to start his own pool-cleaning business. When his wife and son are killed, he goes on a one-man war against the Mexicans. I highly recommend POOLBOY: DROWNING OUT THE FURY!!!",1336953600,3,517,4.4526315789473685
4979140,3,B0068MNO02,"""Poolboy: Drowning Out the Fury"" is not a serious action film. Clearly, the title explains it's genre. 'Drowning Out the Fury' is a sequel to ""Poolboy"" - a film moviegoers never heard of because the studio banned it from being released, or so claims fictioness filmmaker Saint James St. James. It was shot in 1990 by Saint James St. James who at the time was 10 years old. The film stars Kevin Sorbo (hey, wasn't he Hercules?!) as the film's hero who returns to America after serving in Nam. When he returns, he discovers his nation (and the pool cleaning business) has been hijacked by Mexicans. He then proceeds to clean up the nation and re-claim the pool cleaning business once and for all. The script is more racist than ""Blazing Saddles"". It's all in good fun if you don't take the jokes seriously. Danny Trejo co-stars along with other notable appearances by Jason Mewes and Richard Karn.",1335744000,8,895,4.670886075949367
4979141,5,B0068MNO02,Great movie within a movie about the worst film ever made. Sorbo is hysterical as the main guy fighting to get his pool cleaning business back from non other than Danny Trejo and his band of thugs... i laughed all the way through and there are great cameos from all sorts of Hollywood's best B actors.,1334534400,3,301,4.392857142857143
4979142,4,B0068MNO02,"He's the Poolboy, a ""hardcore Vietnam vet with eight-six purple hearts and was trained to kill, and has just come home to find [his] wife and son dead, drowning in a pool.""  To seek vengeance, he wages war with the local Mexican immigrants; when he kills the ninth favorite brother of Caesar, the war escalates into all-out mayhem.

Suffice it to say that POOLBOY: DROWNING OUT THE FURY is not for everyone.  Its over-the-top xenophobia, violence, and sex is meant to incite and push buttons, and get a few guilty laughs (a sax-playing Hitler?).  So if you're the kind of person who doesn't like hard-R comedies, stop reading this review; it won't do anything for you.

POOLBOY isn't the greatest grindhouse parody of recent years; but it's off-the-cuff vulgarity and humor make it a memorable entry into this new genre.  Kevin Sorbo has great comedic timing, as does the film's writer Ross Patterson (who co-stars as Saint James St. James, the director of the film-within-a-film).  Danny Trejo does his Danny Trejo thing (which admittedly no one else can do); also look for Jason Mewes, the vocal half of Jay & Silent Bob.  The entire cast/crew provide jokes that are (often literally) below the belt; they may not all be winners, but they come so fast and furious that it won't really matter.  Grab a beer, put aside your tender sensibilities, and prepare to have a few laughs that you may feel bad about later.  Those are the best kind, right?",1333843200,6,1446,4.748

8494896,5,B0068MNO02,"Saint James St. James is a great director of intentionally bad campy satirical movies such as FDR American Badass and Hellen Keller Vs. Nightwolves. He parodies grindhouse movies with lowbrow goofy humor. Poolboy: Drowning Out The Fury is a spoof on Vietnam movies and revenge flicks. The humor is blue comedy and very ""Politically Incorrect"" ethnic humor, so if you are one of those people who is easily offended 1. You have a personal problem 2. This movie is not for you. If that doesn't apply to you, then grab a bowl of popcorn and enjoy. This one is a chucklefest that will put a grin on your face.

I also heard from an undisclosed source that this is a favorite movie of a certain current political figure in American Politics. I am not at liberty to disclose my source or name the person.",1495411200,3,797,4.534722222222222
