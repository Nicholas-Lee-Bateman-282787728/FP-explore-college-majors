8479383,2,B000DT8OQU,"In spite of the boldly advertised ENGLISH SUBTITLES on the case label, they are NOT available there. I checked with DVD analysis software; it's not incorrect operation.

All it has is subtitles in Polish when the language spoken is not Polish. In exchange, though this should contain only Episode #1, the disk contains episodes #2 and #3 as well, though again, without subtitles in English.

If you understand Polish, this is a buy-one-get-three bargain; if you don't, it's useless.",1416096000,,482,5.0886075949367084
