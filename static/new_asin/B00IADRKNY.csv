Just when it starts to get in depth about one subject, bam, it jumps to another and leaves you hanging. There is some information I found interesting, but then some of it was to ""mystical"" for me. Programs like this make me think anyone with some cash can buy a PHD, there doesn't seem to be any real criteria for getting one or connection as to why anyone would need one.

6255564,4,B00IADRKNY,"Though described by others as, ""completely erratic and unorganized,"" I found it to be a fairly well done documentary. What keeps me from going to a full five stars is that it seemed a bit long. It is a mixture of several conspiracy theory-type elements, and I honestly think it might have been better to break the movie up into multiple movies that each just focused on a single topic.

The most interesting part of the movie was the small humanoid, nicknamed Ata. Unlike the Bigfoot TV shows where they always leave you hanging, here we had something that was most likely the real deal. However, it seemed tacked onto the film almost like an afterthought.

All in all, it was filmed well. The information was presented professionally, and it is worth watching. However, there is just something about the documentary that leaves you wanting more. I had somewhat of the feeling I had after watching the movie Thrive. When Thrive was over, I was excited and I felt like it was something everyone should see. However, even though it contained some similar information, by the end of Sirius rather than being blown away, I was just hoping they would rap it up.

I have a saying for unusual skeletons found that don't play into Darwinian evolution: If it doesn't fit, you must ignore it. Here we have something that obviously doesn't fit the story we have been given...and all you hear is crickets chirping.

I give it four stars out of respect for the little guy Ata and the good production of the movie. If it had been edited better and made a little more concise, it might have been a real winner.",1412208000,21,1595,4.605633802816901

Now as far as ""CE-5"" human initiated contact with extraterrestrials, much about him causes me to question his theories (truth to him). But a mind that really seeks knowledge would test his hypothesis before discrediting and attacking his character. Otherwise, I guess it's just ignorant. We know so little about our creation and our place in the universe, why not use others theories to research and develop your own.

6255606,3,B00IADRKNY,"Greer spent part of his adult life saving people, and the rest of his career working tirelessly to get the truth out about the government cover up of UFOs and alien technology. I remember visiting his website some 15 years ago, and even back then, it was good, honest reporting, without the sensationalism found everywhere else. That said, this film (if you can call it that) is SIRIUS-ly flawed, and quite frankly, somewhat embarrassing

It starts with a title sequence that is concerned more with the architecture of buildings that do nothing to set up the story or introduce characters, etc. Remember, movies are first and foremost storytelling, and whether the audience knows something about the subject matter or not, it is important to create a narrative (even in a documentary) that gives the viewer a complete understanding of the circumstances, events, people, places and things.

Next, the use of parallel editing, where several story lines are advanced simultaneously, is a convention used in many films, and it can be a dramatic and effective one at that. However, the editing here is disjointed and even confusing at times. Again, if you know the background, you can fill in the blanks (which some of the reviewers here use to defend the movie); but for those seeing this information or hearing these testimonies for the first time, it lacks coherence.

Regarding the little creature... while this is a most fascinating discovery, the idea that it is built up throughout the film, only to have the results be inconclusive at the end, is a major cinematic let down. There is no discussion of the many small craft sightings, that could put the size of this potential alien into perspective; nor any discussion of the fairy lore or other mythical and historical sightings that some have suggested could be of extraterrestrial origin -- which is an interesting hypothesis I might add -- and a missed filmic opportunity.

As far as the various montages of images and brief testimonies of ex-military witnesses, while this was good stuff, it seems that the editor could have spent at least a few more weeks, picking and choosing and cutting and ordering the shots.

While the whole military industrial complex theme is an important one to explain the reason for the cover up of technology, the tie in with September 11th seemed to take something away from the very serious topic of the military stealing energy patents, etc. The 9-11 conspiracy thing has been dealt with in countless documentaries, and to just mention it in passing, seemed out of place -- however important to the overall story it may have been.

It seems to me that they either ran out of money (and time) and rushed together the final cut; or worse, the filmmakers deliberately sabotaged Greer's story.

With all of the hype leading up to this film and the disclosure, the film was very disappointing.

I'd like to see this re-made as soon as possible. Oh, and one more thing... I'm assuming using Sirius has to do with alien visitors coming from that star system, but I can't recall a single mention of it.",1440460800,8,3084,4.849809885931559

6255614,3,B00IADRKNY,"There are a lot of UFO related documentaries about UFOs and most of the ones I've seen are pretty awful. This one isn't great but it's better than most.

Here's the scoop. This documentary centers around Dr. Steven Greer and his efforts to have the U.S. give full disclosure on UFOs. It also deals with his efforts to determine if the tiny, humanoid-ish skeleton he has access to is, in fact, human or something from another world.

This is painted in rather broad strokes. Greer begins with President Eisenhower's warning to the American public on the dangers of the military industrial complex. He feels this is at the heart of why UFOs are guarded to the degree they are. He also thinks that there are any number of inventions pertaining to free energy (as well as other things) that have been suppressed by said complex. He figures these control the money through their control of energy.

Another aspect of the documentary deals with Greer's giving rise to the term CE5 which is us (homo sapiens) initiating contact with extraterrestrials. He, along with his adherents, are shown in the desert performing a type of meditation which will draw UFOs to them. He feels he has had some degree of success in this regard.  Greer carries a side arm. He is paranoid and for good reason. He lists some number of individuals that attempted to divulge UFO secrets, or file for ""unpopular"" patents that have been killed or simply disappeared. He figures the risk to get the truth out is worth it.

I liked the way the director moves off a subject only to return to it a while later. It helps keep things moving. As I mentioned, this is painted in broad strokes and some of the items covered needed more room to breathe. I am not a big fan of things psychic so that aspect of the documentary put me off a bit. But this is still worth viewing. It all seems so silly that the cat is out of the bag and those in power (whomever they might be) just won't give in. That smacks of something sinister. So have at it and get out of it what you will.",1437696000,5,2032,4.466307277628032

6255616,1,B00IADRKNY,"I am certain that we are not alone in this universe and therefore I read and watch just about everything available on the subject. But my very first reaction to this documentary was alarm at the worship quality of CSETI members towards interstellar beings. Then, immediately into their case against the secrecy of government (of which I fully believe by the way), all representative shots and images were of, drum roll....Republicans! So, was this doc really just a cleverly democrat-crafted political beatdown on conservatives? Where was the mention of George Soros (leading financier of Obama) and his billions in Brazilian oil? Or the screenshots of the Clintons hand in hand full of cash from Saudi oil tycoons? Chirp. Chirp. Chirp. Even Leslie Keane (UFOs: Generals Pilots & Government Officials Go on the Record), herself a left wing democrat, had the integrity and maturity to stay neutral when making her case.

The little corpse may have been a fully human being with severe deformities or he may have been an alien cross-breeding experiment gone wrong, who knows? We really don't have any definite answers on him and I think he was way overplayed just to get viewers.

Any time a group, no matter how well researched their area of study is, uses their work as a campaign platform for a political party it immediately delegitimizes their case. It arouses distrust and thereby the viewer/listener cannot be fully sure of the truth in any of its messages. Furthermore, the New Age/Masters of Initiation total trust and worship aspect of CSETI towards alien beings (whom they don't even yet know!) is not only alarming but it's just plain creepy.",1437091200,2,1652,4.981884057971015

6255621,3,B00IADRKNY,"It was interesting to watch but I think the people who are in the movie are too conspiracy minded and are also hoping too much for aliens to rescue are world.  I thought it was kind of funny when a bunch of them sat out in the Colorado wilderness, where the sky is very dark to see more of the beautiful nighttime heavens, and when something flew overhead amongst the stars they assume it happened because of their meditation.  They assume it was an alien craft making itself known to them because they were concentrating on sending their energy to the sky.  I have been out in the wilderness many times where it is darker since one is not near city lights and I have seen things shoot across the sky.  I of course call it a ""falling star"" but it is a meteor.  I was not meditating nor trying to throw off any energy.  The meteors fly by because they are there and you can see them better when it is really dark.  Some years ago I heard a story that was told by a reliable astrophysicist about two policemen in California who thought they saw one or two UFOs in the sky and this was in the daytime.  What it turned out to be was some naturally occurring phenomena and not UFOs or alien spacecraft.  I don't remember what it was they actually saw but I think they saw a planet or planets that can be seen occasionally in the daytime.

Likewise, I suspect they're right about the Earth having had a long history of contact with extraterrestrials.  Close encounters of the 5th kind?

That alien carcass was not convincing, it seemed a little foolish to make it a part of the movie if its just inconclusive.  It really looked like an aborted fetus or really messed up preemie.  It was nice to see he has a calling, something to pursue, but I bet he could do wonders convincing us all to recycle our trash or maybe explore our oceans for answers to our human beginnings.

6255647,2,B00IADRKNY,"I was interested in watching this documentary because of the tiny creature that was found and examined by Stanford pathologists as well as some other scientists. However, the film includes sooo much extraneous information - much of it that detracts from the credibility of the subject as well as Dr. Greer (most specifically new-agey prayer type groups supposedly camping out in high UFO sighting areas to send happy messages and good energy to the aliens).

In the end the information about the tiny being comprised at most about 10 minutes of the overall video. The being has human DNA but with much more extra ""junk DNA"" as it's called, and the implication is that the differences could be based in the junk DNA, as that is an area in which we (scientists of the world) are lacking in understanding. A leading Stanford geneticist who is the top in genetic mutations and anomalies says the being does not fit the criteria for any known genetic mutations/anomalies. So, while the creature is indeed real, there isn't much more info than that at this time.

While I do believe there is much that we do not know or understand about our world, universe and beyond, this film didn't do much to credibly add to my knowledge or information on the subject.",1423958400,2,1250,4.729357798165138

Beware when you watch so-called ""new age"" media because looking back into history, every ""movement"", ""revolution"", ""trend"", etc. has been orchestrated by the powers that be for very specific reasons. The ""new age"" movement is one of them. They want you keeping your mind way into outer space instead of trying to understand your own INNER SPACE first. You will notice that they through in all the N.W.O./government conspiracy stuff (which is credible and valid) but then mix it with this new-age hogwash. Anyone paying attention can clearly see that the ""flower power"" movement is the equivalent of the new age and both are meant to KEEP PEOPLE 'SPACED OUT' INSTEAD OF TAKING CHARGE AND SYSTEMATICALLY ENDING CORRUPTION.

6255652,3,B00IADRKNY,"If alien craft are flying through our atmosphere and contacting humans then many assumptions can be made. Since we have a very weak grasp of the details we are forced to assume. These human assumptions are formed in the brain under the pressure to either believe or disbelieve. People could ague for hundreds of years about the validity of the assumptions and the validity of the supposed facts. This movie is a collection of information and one man's interpretation of the information he has collected and the experiences he has had. Most of the information I have collected over my lifetime and most of the experiences I have had force me to believe most of what is in this documentary. This movie causes me to strengthen my suspicions but not deeply believe. I keep an open mind that what this guys is saying could very well be true BUT an open mind has to entertain that some of what's contained in this film is false. The most disappointing aspect of the film was the hippy like meditation to call the UFOs into view BUT when I review my life the only tangible evidence I have for what could be life after death or an intelligence outside our current reality has been my very own experiences. These are very much like his own personal experiences as he describes them. To assume he's telling the truth should help the world and to assume he's lying is to contribute to its destruction. I say this because most of his suspicions I believe are correct and to ignore them is to let the genie out of the bottle. The danger with zero point energy is if it is truly a dead end then it could be diverting funds away from possible revolutionary energy sources like Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactors(LFTR)s. Ironically the opposite could be argued. The trick is to be informed as best as you can and decide. The little mummy being's DNA test didn't surprise me at all because these things are filtered with software and it really depends on the software used, how it is programmed how it is set and ultimately what you intend on finding out. Even if all of that was set perfectly the results could be very ambiguous because if it is truly an alien human hybrid the software may not know how to properly tease out the patterns especially if( hold on) we were genetically polluted thousands or millions of years ago. You see this can quickly degrade into an argument about how many angels can really dance on the head of a pin. It's interesting, informative and potentially earthshaking.

The story eludes to the sad fact that human beings are at present still enslaved by mind numbing ignorance and fear induced by a ""petro- fascist"" cabals' manufactured disaster management teams working to dis-arm our evolutionary potential. Knowing we are not alone and that all points of space inwardly and outwardly are connected is an inspiring message. This film should be shown in schools and universities throughout our world.
