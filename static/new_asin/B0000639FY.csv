7959067,5,B0000639FY,A very good idea for a sports junky.  My relative loved it.  It is so funny and very entertaining for anyone.,1401667200,,109,4.142857142857143
7959068,2,B0000639FY,"This video has old and outdated material. While some of the footage was interesting, the footage was fuzzy.  The apprears to be a DVD of a VHS video.",1326758400,,149,4.321428571428571
7959069,1,B0000639FY,"This is just old, I mean VERY OLD, tv blooper shows joined together.  My friends and I watching were not familiar with any of the ""stars"" mentioned they were so old.  I'm not sure of the dates, but looks like 60's and 70's teams and players.  The basketball shorts are short-shorts.  The sports sequence opening the DVD shows soccer among the types of sports bloopers; however, there are no other soccer segments.  To be fair, soccer is not listed on the menu at the beginning.",1244851200,6,477,4.564705882352941
7959070,4,B0000639FY,"The audio quality needs work.  Still, there was a lot of material for the money, so I'd recommend it for a party.",1240531200,,113,4.136363636363637
7959071,4,B0000639FY,"This bloopers video has a great concept--good bloopers and classical music.

The music and bloopers go well together and often have humorous themes.  It really helps.  As good as bloopers are, they can get boring after awhile.

The bloopers are good, but not great.  Many of the bloopers are the same as the video Simply the Best--101 Sports.  Most are funny.

There are two problems with this video which cause it to receive four stars instead of five.  One problem is that the video has few bloopers from professional U.S. sports, and instead gets bloopers from college, the CFL, and so on.  While I'm at it, can I add for the record that rodeo ""bloopers"" are not funny?  Seeing a bull rider being wrenched around by his arm for five seconds IS NOT A BLOOPER.

The other problem is that the video is short--a mere 55 minutes.

It is good for a bloopers video, and non-sports fans will still love it (except for the rodeo bit).  Enjoy!",1123113600,,936,4.532934131736527
7959072,5,B0000639FY,This Sports blooper tape is by far one of the best. If you like genuine sports fun this is a must for your collection.,977443200,2,118,3.9583333333333335
7959073,3,B0000639FY,"This is an average blooper selection.  The bloopers themselves are pretty good, but the clips are quite long.  I think of a blooper tape as being ""one right after the other"" mishaps.  These bloopers tend to  spend a lot of time ""setting up"" the bloopers verbally for the  viewer.  Since these are bloopers from around the world there is some  explaining of the cultures where these mishaps occur.  While it is  interesting, it takes up too much time on the video and there are less  bloopers overall.  I just want to see mess ups, crashes, running into other  team members, etc.  Compile a bunch of these types of clips, set them to  some good background music, and let me have some CONSTANT laughs!",960595200,,699,4.5772357723577235
