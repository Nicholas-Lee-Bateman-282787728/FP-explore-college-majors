1680990,5,B000060MUZ,"NO MAN'S LAND opens in the small hours of an impenetrably foggy night with a small contingent of Bosnian replacement soldiers groping their way to the front lines during their 1990s war with the Serbs. Sunrise finds them inadvertently caught between opposing forces, and then the Serbs start shooting. A couple of hours later, circumstances find Ciki and Nino, Bosnian and Serb respectively, marooned and wounded together in an abandoned trench between the combatants. The relationship between the two antagonists predictably starts with animosity, as depicted in a scene in which they volley shouts back and forth, like two children, about which side started the conflict. (Unsurprisingly, the one holding the loaded gun at the moment has the last word.) Then, they almost reach a rapprochement upon discovering that they both come from the same town and both know the same girl, a blond with big ... well, you know. However, the situation is complicated by the presence in the trench of another Bosnian soldier, Ciki's friend, under whose apparently dead body the Serbs had planted a Bouncing Betty mine, which, once the weight holding it down is removed, pops to a height of three feet before exploding. Unfortunately, the ""dead"" man isn't lifeless, only temporarily rendered unconscious from an artillery round. In any case, once a local French contingent of the UN ""peacekeeping"" force and the British news babe from a global TV news network get involved, the situation deteriorates.
The actors in NO MAN'S LAND will be unfamiliar to U.S. audiences. Branko Djuric and Rene Biturajac are very good as Ciki and Nino respectively. Sergeant Marchand, the long-suffering, honorable NCO in charge of the French UN detachment, and whose sincere efforts to make a difference for the better are foiled by his timid, politically correct superiors, is sympathetically played by Georges Siatidis.
This tragicomedy, Bosnia's official entry for the Foreign Language Academy Award, reminds us that tribal conflicts, especially those based on ethnic or religious hatreds (as opposed to simple land grabs), are frustratingly impervious to a rational explanation or resolution. And, furthermore, the well-intentioned efforts by outside do-gooders to reduce the odium will likely be ineffectual in the long run, and may make things worse in the short run, especially if the raisons d'tre have been poorly defined.
This is a short (97 minute) but thought provoking film. As I was lucky enough to see a pre-release screening, I highly recommend it for adult viewing, though one will likely have to make the effort to find the art house theater in which it will appear.",1006387200,16,2652,5.1985981308411215

It is also the most difficult film, because it is so realistic. I loved the humor, for it shows the people as they are. They use that language and talk like that most of the time, particularly in difficult moments. The ""live news"" part was very emotional but without it the film would not be complete. The presentation of the history overall was accurate. The soldiers who were there without knowing the real reason, their understanding and mixed feelings about each other, the actions (or lack of it) showed the truth, the reality, Bosnia as it really was.",1438128000,,672,4.56198347107438

1681053,2,B000060MUZ,"It seems odd to me that this film won any awards.  The transitions from dark humor to serious drama were awkward from my perspective.  Several times, in a matter of minutes, the main characters move from trying to kill each other, to  joking and working toward a common goal.  To me, it looked silly and contrived.  If you want to see a better example of this situation, watch ""Hell in the pacific"".  It's interesting that the opposing sides are portrayed as hapless pawns that are the victims of their own ethnocentric, and nationalistic  propaganda.  Who started the war?  Why, the other guy of course!  The only thing they seem to agree on consistently, is that the UN is weak, and ineffectual.  Some truth(Rwanda) in that.  I did notice that in one scene, the UN commander orders that each side be given false information regarding the other to instigate a clash between them.  Let me see if I understand this.  The UN is trying to instigate clashes between the warring factions, so it can sit back and watch?  Did that make sense to anyone else? Was that supposed to be a serious accusation the writer/s were trying to make?  Also, the media are viewed as vultures, and have no genuine interest in anything but a story that sells.  Some truth in that too, but that point is made more effectively in movies like ""Salvador"", to name one.  This film, in my opinion, tried to do many things, but did none of them very well.

1681082,4,B000060MUZ,"This movie is not a comedy as the synopsis and trailer imply.  It might be classified as black comedy, but even that would be a stretch.  Rather, this movie is a searing commentary on the ferocity of the Bosnian-Serbian conflict and the United Nation's generally incompetent and dishonest involvement in that conflict.  If there is anything funny going on in this movie, it is the stupidity and hopelessness of multi-cultural societies.

Two soldiers, one a Bosnian, the other a Serb, become trapped between opposing battle lines.  This is the so-called ""no man's land"" from which the film takes its title.  A third soldier's body has been booby-trapped with an anti-personnel mine.  As it turns out, he is not dead, and the second-half of the movie revolves around efforts to rescue him without blowing him and everyone else to pieces.

At first, given their collective fate, it appears the Bosnian and Serb soldiers will come to some sort of mutual understanding, something like a two-man cease fire agreement.  Such a plot turn would have converted this movie into just another why-can't-we-all-get-along war movie:  Wounded soldiers rediscover their humanity and learn that they have more in common than they thought.  Luckily, such a sappy, worn-out story line does not develop.

Instead, the soldiers' hatred toward each other only increases throughout the film.  Local UN troops, against higher orders, insert themselves into the situation and attempt to rescue the booby-trapped soldier, while also trying to keep the Bosnian and Serb soldiers from killing each other.  Also thrown into the mix is a British TV news crew, headed by a stereotypical, pushy, foul-mouthed female reporter, who is carefully managed by the UN commander.  He ultimately fools her into reporting a story that never happened.

This is a well-made movie.  The acting, directing, and cinematography are all up to standards.  Subtitles are used for some scenes.  French, English, and German are also spoken throughout the film, which is the only comedic relief in an otherwise very tragic movie.",1351900800,,2075,5.177177177177177
1681083,4,B000060MUZ,"This movie is interestsing in a quirky way, subtitles and all. It points out how insane war between neighbors can become and how useless the UN peacekeeps can be.

1681084,4,B000060MUZ,"A 'futility of war' themed film which climaxes with a 'dead-end' conundrum which can transfer to many of today's conflicts and which depicts perfectly how there are no winners in war .
Low budget, low level of special effects but high emotion, tension and a quality of writing that maintains interest and momentum.

Fortunately, such is not the case.  The action starts with a scenario not altogether unfamiliar (it was used, for instance, in the sci-fi film Enemy Mine), in which, by a series of unfortunate circumstances, two Bosnians (one of them immobilized) and a Serb find themselves trapped in a trench together in the middle of a battleground.  Things proceed tensely, if somewhat predictably, until the United Nations and the press get involved.

Through their exchange of words and thoughts the movie displays the gigantic proportion of farce that the war has reached. The lighter moments in the movie have been injected with brilliant sense of precision and wit. Interestingly, even such a prolonged session together does not help to let the very soldiers realize the futility of their hostility.

1681136,5,B000060MUZ,"Directed by Danis Tanovic, and starring one of the most popular Bosnian actors, Branko Djuric, a veteran of Yugoslavian cinema Filip Sovagovic, and Rene Bitorajac, ""No Man's Land"" (""Nicija Zemlja"") is a great insight not only into the war in Bosnia, but also into the irony of it, as well as into the typical ex-Yugoslavian form of cinema.  Danis Tanovic truly showed the Balkans in a nutshell.

Two Bosnian Muslims and two Bosnian Serbs are caught in a trench between enemy lines - in no man's land.  The area is off limits to all warring parties, meaning that neither party is prepared to officially investigate the matter.  Enter the United Nations, popularly known in Bosnia as the Smurfs (due to blue helmets and the fact they had absolutely no power in Bosnia, in fact, they were the national laughing stock).  Lulled by constantly being ignored and by constantly saying ""no"", the UN is confused as to what to do, especially as they come into a situation in which one of the occupants of the trench might die.  Originally turning their back on the entire situation, one UN peacekeeper's morals force the higher-ups into dealing with the situation through the involvement of the international media.

Excellent in its entirety, the movie is comical and tragic at the same time, educational and frustrating, hopeful and without hope.  The only critique I have is that Tanovic picked Sovagovic (a Croat) to play a veteran Serb, and Sovagovic's Croatian accent is unmistakable and out of place throughout.

I highly recommend this film to everyone, period.  I will end with a great quote from the film - a French peacekeeper tells a British journalist:""Not doing anything IS taking sides.""  Enjoy the movie.",1176422400,,1709,4.919860627177701
1681137,4,B000060MUZ,"Worth seeing, no doubt. However, makes you wonder what a true genius like Akira Kurosawa would have done with such an original premise.

This director here misses having a masterpiece of a film on his hands by something like a hair.

Had the three main characters been better developed the audiance would have had more  reason to

1681140,4,B000060MUZ,"I did not find the film to be a dark-comedy as some of the other viewers. Satire, yes. Humorous, no. This film takes place in the Balkans in 1993. The area: Bosnia and Herzegovina. Two Bosnian soldiers are lost in 'No Mans Land.' That omninous area no sane person would dare be, unless they are ordered to, or are lost. For two Bosnian soldiers it's the latter. Ciki (Branko Djuric) and his comrade-in-arms have found themselves lost on the Serbian side of the battlefield. However, in order to take shelter from the bombings and snipers, they hole themselves up in a trench. This is no ordinary trench, and their lives are about to get a hell of a lot more complicated.

The trench they have holed themselves up in is also laden with hidden land mines. Some of which are of the 'bouncing betty' type. The mine does not go off until after you step off of it. And once you step on one, there really isn't much anyone can do. Also sent to look into the sector is a Serbian soldier named Nino (Rene Bitorajac). He stumbles across these two Bosnian soldiers by accident. However, one of the Bosnian soldiers is lying in the trench wounded. Unknown to him, he is lying on top of a mine. His slightest movement will cause the mine to detonate. A Catch-22 type situation now exists. Somehow, Ciki must get his fellow Bosnian free.

This is where the UN comes into the picture. And it shows just how political and ineffectual the UN was at the time. However, one French NCO, refuses to let politics interfere. He attempts to involve the UN one way or another in order to help these three soldiers get out alive. When a bomb expert is called in however, things don't look to good for the wounded soldier lying on the mine. Will the UN succeed? And will the two Bosnian and the one Serbian soldier make it out alive? This I will leave for you to watch. The film is recommended. It is good, contrary to some of the diatribes other reviewers have leveled at the film. [Stars: 4.5]",1163462400,2,1968,4.433701657458563

1681142,4,B000060MUZ,"No Man's Land is Danis Tanovic's directorial debut, which won the oscar for best foreign language film in 2003, is an absolutely perfect example of what a young filmmaker wants to achieve from his first feature film. Not only did it win the oscar, but it also won a truck load of acclaim from critics and audiences alike. Tanovic also wrote, and composed the music for the film, and achieved a best screenplay award at the Cannes Film Festival, and a best foreign language film award at the golden globes. No Man's Land is another foreign language film you must watch, even if you're not a movie buff. The film is from Bosnia-Herzagovina, and the primary language is Bosnian, but also has French and English spoken in the film, so the film isn't entirely in Bosnian, but it's still the most spoken language in the movie.

No Man's Land is set in Bosnia-Herzagovina during the Bosnian war in 1993, when the fighting between the two sides was at it's heaviest. The opening scene has a group of Bosnian soldiers walking through the foggy night, where we hear them talking about their guide getting them lost and that they're lucky he hasn't led them to the enemy. They then decide that they should wait for sunrise, so they can see where they're going and then know if they're at the place they have to be. Morning arrives, they get up and start walking again, the squad get sepperated and most of them are killed, except for two of the troops named Ciki and Cera, Ciki is trapped in a trench and is wouded, Cera is unconcious and is thought to be dead. The Serbs who shot at them, decide to send a pair of soldiers to inspect the trench for survivors, they arrive at the trench and find the supposed dead Cera, and decide to set a booby trap using the body of Cera, and a bouncing mine, the bouncing mine is a bomb that when weight is added on, it is activated, and once the pressure is relieved, it jumps up and explodes. Ciki kills the one troop and wounds the other(Nino), thus having to work with his enemy in order to survive. The basic story is about two soldiers trapped between enemy lines in a no man's land, thus the enemy can't kill the soldiers because they don't know who's troops are who, and let's not forget the poor Cera who is trapped on a mine he cannot get up from nor move. The rest of the film follows how UN forces try to get the troops out alive and safe from eachother.

The film's script and plot is very original, with not the average plot involved. The cinematography captures the heat involved in the conflict and captures the hell of war, and even in it's cease fires. Tanovic's direction brings out the very best in the actors, they show such hate and conflict between their characters and themselves, with dialogue that is somewhat ironic and very humourous.

All in all, the film has a very original plot and feel to it, but loses it's freshness after a fourth or fifth view, but doesn't fail to entertain and make us feel laughter and sadness. This is a very good watch and deserves every bit of attention, you will not be dissapointed here, it's got what war movies got to have, drama, action, comedy, and sorrow for the characters we are viewing. A must see.

There are no extra features on this disc, but has perfect picture quality and sound, a truly magnificent picture, with cracking sound, but an effortless disc when it comes to extra features. The film: 4/5, the extras: 0/5.",1154822400,,3416,4.478330658105939

This film actually tells a meaningful story and the characters here are people, not just ""soldiers"" (there's a big difference).

1681155,4,B000060MUZ,"Danis Tanovic's gritty portrayal of the brutal and ideologic war fought between Serbs and Bosnians in Bosnia-Herzegovina is portrayed in a realistic and inevitably unfortunate manner in ""No Man's Land"".

The aftermath of a deadly skirmish results in two wounded soldiers on opposing sides to be hunkered down in a trench between their respective lines in no man's land.  Also trapped in the trench is another Bosnian soldier who is lying over a pressure triggered land mine primed to explode once he moves off of it.  Initially the soldiers attempt to cooperate to extricate themselves from this conundrum.  Philosophical differences abort this attempt and they are soon at each others throats.

They are soon discovered by a blue helmetted U.N. peace keeping force who try to intercede to rescue the men.  This leads to the pathetic reality that the U.N., on a humanitarian mission, is toothless in mediating a settlement to this stalemate.  The mixed messages from the U.N. chain of command results in a half hearted effort.  The presence of the world press, covering this issue forces them to act.

Unfortunately the crisis does not end happily.  Director and screenwiter Tanovic's heavy hand drives home the tragic point that people with different beliefs have a difficult time living together peacefully which ultimately leads to chaos.",1131321600,,1341,5.166666666666667
1681156,5,B000060MUZ,"I'm a big fan of the aforementioned film, but No Man's Land is truly incredible in how much it conveys about the Bosnia-Serbia war.  Its absurdities, its tragedies, and even its tragicomic humor is all conveyed with very little artifice and incredible acting from largely unknown faces (at least in American cinema).  It also strikingly humanizes and personalizes this conflict and war in general by focusing almost exclusively on two individuals, one Bosnian and one Serbian, trapped in a trench between the lines.  Later, the role of the UN peacekeepers and the media is brought in with a great deal of honesty and, again, sarcastic humor at the relative impotence of both in the midst of such a complex and explosive situation.

The movie shows the Balkans War--and all wars--for what it was: a stupid, senseless absurdity.",1108857600,4,418,4.698630136986301
1681158,5,B000060MUZ,"It's only natural that I had to review this movie... I survived the war in Bosnia, thus I feel as if this movie is also a part of me and what I went through.

A Bosnian soldier, along with his comrades, gets lost in the fog near the enemy (Serbian) lines. As the night ends, the Bosnian soldiers are awaken by the Serbian soldiers who are out to kill them. As the Serbian soldiers kill majority of Ciki's crew, he seeks shelter in an abandoned trench. But what's this? Serbian soldiers don't easily give up as they send two more soldiers (a veteran and a newbie) to find Ciki and kill him. Little do they know Ciki has a gun with which he kills the old veteran and captures the young Serbian Soldier. Now for the completely irony, Ciki, who is also wounded, gets captured by the young Serbian solider who was his prize moments ago...and so  the plot moves on with more twists and turns.

It is important to keep in mind that this movie was the first film from Bosnia that was up for any kind of an award. I was personally not surprised when it won an Oscar. It was only obvious, it won numerous awards in Europe, and it was a given that it was going to bump French's Amelie outta the cell. Even though Amelie was expected to win, No Man's Land swiped an Oscar for the best Foreign Flick. A film that is hatefully loved if you will.

What I liked the best about this movie is the fact that it showed both sides, a Bosnian and a Serbian. And also, the UN side which is LOVED to be hated. Is it just me or does pretty much every new war movie (Black Hawn Down) show what kind of pricks the UN really are? Think of UN as that evil snake from the story of Adam & Eve, they basically come in, stir up some more trouble (that is not needed of course), give both sides some weapons and basically watch them fight it out. This is roughly what the UN's role in this movie is, they're there to help, but they're not really helping. Instead, we see the UN official do what they did in Bosnia for three years, sit behind their big desks, flirt with the secretaries, and give out press conferences that not only confuse the people in the war, but people in other countries as well. As you can see, the UN plays a rather big role in this movie, and what a role it is. By the end of the movie you will absolutely despise the UN, and there is a good reason why.

This movie is much more to a Balkan mind than it is to someone who knows nothing of this war. It showed everything that someone from a war could see, it captured the lovingly hateful chemistry between the two enemies, and how both sides blame each other for starting the war-- which brings me to the only flaw of the movie. The Director/Writer did not really explain how the war began. I realize this movie seems flawless for those who know everything about the war, but those who have just been tuning in, will be a bit lost. Nonetheless, everyone will be able to enjoy the anecdotes that are thrown in every now and then at the beginning of the movie, however, everyone will be baffled and saddened by the ending of this dark comedic drama.

1681159,5,B000060MUZ,"In the bittersweet anti-war tradition of Dr. Strangelove or Catch-22, but perhaps at a more authentic level, this bare-knuckled film isn't a great war movie because it blows your mind with gory war footage.

It's a great war movie because it's confident in its emotions. It is absurd in its unbearably tense metaphor for the insanity, stubbornness and futility of the Balkan civil wars. It is  infectious in its conviction that you'll get the message anyway.

Although the plot can't and doesn't totally escape a sense of being contrived (it's almost too neat a symbol to have the kind of credibility and impact it needs) it never loses sight of the sombreness of warfare.

Instead it sets up its case poignantly within the context of its comedy, and is studded with stirring moments. E.g., when a soldier looks at the mine under his friend and in moving the man's arm brings a tightly gripped photo of his girlfriend into the frame.

It astutely shows us the impact of CNN-style media on modern warfare. The reporters relish their power and everyone is playing to the cameras: especially the U.N. brass, who are so terrified of bad publicity they're morally paralyzed.

Lastly, for a War Movie it sure is pleasant looking. Instead of the usual grungy and muddy battlefields from distant lands, it's set in a picturesque field. The cinematography is fantastic.

A crisp, riveting hour-and-a-half. I've recommended this film to practically everyone I care about.",1102723200,4,1461,4.963114754098361
1681160,5,B000060MUZ,"The problems plaguing the Balkans go on and on without end. Historians, political scientists, sociologists, and a plethora of other academics have isolated a number of these difficulties. There is, for example, the Ottoman domination of the region for roughly 500 years. This occupation cut off the area from the rest of Europe and its attendant social, political, and economic currents. Too, the Turks elevated tensions between ethnic groups in an effort to hold on to power once the Ottoman Empire began disintegrating, tensions that continue to fester today. Finally, don't discount the absolutely atrocious attitudes Western Europe held about the area throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The Great Powers drew up borders with little regard for the peoples in question, virtually ensuring that Serbs, Croats, Bosnians, Macedonians, Albanians, Greeks, and all the rest would continue to fight amongst themselves in an effort to restore their traditional lands. To sit back and wonder why those darn people in the Balkans can't seem to get their act together is to admit an ignorance of history. At the same time, figuring it all out doesn't seem to help either. Understanding what ethnic groups were fighting in the former Yugoslavia, and why they were fighting, was about as easy as deciphering the situation in Beirut in the 1980s.

Enter director Danis Tanovic's ""No Man's Land,"" a film that captures perfectly the mind-boggling conundrums of the Balkan battlefield during the years after the Cold War. The film also transcends the peculiarities of the region to make a statement about the absurdities of war in the age of mass media. It all starts in the early 1990's in Bosnia, where Serbs and Croats are battling it out for control of the region. A small squad (platoon?) of Bosnian soldiers runs smack dab into a Serbian emplacement and pays a heavy price for the mistake. Two of the soldiers, Ciki (Branko Djuric) and Cera (Filip Sovagovic) manage to find refuge in an abandoned trench that just happens to run between Serb and Bosnian lines. While trying to figure out what to do with the seriously wounded Cera, Ciki hears a couple of Serbs coming down the trench. He hides in a bunker, helpless without a weapon, as the Serbs booby trap the prostrate Cera with an especially dangerous landmine. When an opportunity to pick up a gun presents itself, Ciki kills one of the soldiers and holds the other, Nino (Rene Bitorajac), hostage. The two bicker back and forth about who started the war, an interesting argument that radically changes in its answer whenever one of the soldiers gains an advantage over the other.

In the meantime, Cera suddenly wakes up and attempts to move. Both Nino and Ciki, realizing they will die too if the landmine goes off, try to keep the wounded man stable. How to resolve such a dilemma? Why, call in the good old United Nations and its blue helmeted peacekeeping forces, of course! Yeah, right. The UN is about as helpless in this conflict as a rat caught in a trap. Even when a series of incidents eventually alert the peacekeepers to the unfolding events in the trench, the smarmy UN General Soft (played by an oily Simon Callow) oscillates between helping the trapped soldiers and writing them off as a lost cause. A pushy reporter at the scene, Jane Livingstone (Katrin Cartlidge) doesn't help matters much. She constantly badgers the French peacekeepers to allow her access to the trench so she can broadcast the whole thing live for stellar ratings. The peacekeepers don't know what to do; they only gained access to the trench by negotiating a temporary ceasefire that could end at any second, and they are hard pressed to keep Ciki and Nino from killing each other. Poor Cera, caught up in all this brouhaha. A German mine expert brought in to defuse the device can do little to help.

The conclusion to the film is grim, but Tanovic infuses many parts of his film with great humor. The image of first Nino and then Ciki dancing around in ""No Man's Land"" in only their underwear, trying desperately to send a signal to their countrymen not to shoot, is hilarious. So are their arguments about the war and who the aggressors are. These disagreements essentially degenerate into a pouty, childlike exchange along the lines of ""You did."" ""No, you did."" It's nicely done how Tanovic uses such dialogue to show us the banality of war. He also uses the two men as a symbol of the larger ethnic squabbles. For instance, notice how the two achieve an uneasy peace after learning that they spent time in the same town and have a common acquaintance. This is very much in keeping with the Balkan conflicts, where many of the combatants lived and worked together in the same town for years before picking up rifles to kill each other. The role of the media in the incident comes in for especially severe criticism from Tanovic. Through the Jane Livingstone character we see how the hysterical push for a story at all costs shapes how the United Nations responds to the tragedy. The threat of bad press is the only thing that pushes Soft to take action. ""No Man's Land"" takes a unequivocally negative view of everyone involved in the conflict.

Don't expect to see many extras on this disc. MGM is notorious for being rather spotty in the supplements department. I remember seeing a trailer for the film, and nothing more. Oh well, the film is good enough that you don't need much to understand what it is trying to say. I applaud Danis Tanovic for making such a pitch black, piercing statement about the Balkan conflicts. This one places him right up there with Kubrick's ""Dr. Strangelove,"" a position that few attain.",1102723200,21,5675,4.823408624229979
1681161,3,B000060MUZ,"No Man's Land is an extremely social film about the absurdity of war and the lack of humanity that surrounds it.  It takes a very recent conflict with the Bosnians and Serbs and translates it into a message that is very relevant in today's current Iraq conflict.  While it begins as our normal, mundane and clich war film, it quickly changes ""when the fog lifts"" and our two heroes are forced into a situation that they never chose to be in.  Director Danis Tanovic uses a new trick of storytelling by eliminating the hordes of soldiers and limiting our interaction with just two people that are to represent their own country.  This impressed me about this film.  Each character in this film represents their own country.  Nino is the Serbs, Ciki is the Bosnians, and the French officer tries to place the peacekeeping French.  When you take the human away from the picture, you begin to see this as a battle between countries with a ""neutral"" character standing in.  It also reminded me of a boxing match.  We had our two fighters whom never really became friends because they had to fight, and the referee called the UN who was there to blow the whistle if it was ever too rough.

After you begin to see that we have moved from a platoon war film to a simple two-person fight (worthy of the stage) of which each symbolize their own country, the rest of this film falls into place.  Well, I was hoping that it would at least.  I wasn't crazy about this film.  I was expecting to see a tour de Force of imagery and triumph because it was able to beat out Amelie for best picture, but sadly I think the Academy went with this film because of the message that it sent throughout the picture.  As I said before, this is a very social film.  It dabbles in the idea that wars are sometimes fought for the wrong reasons and for forgotten times.  There is a conversation between the Serb and Bosnian near the beginning of the film that I thought was interesting.  They were talking about how this war started, and neither could remember who was the aggressor and who was the pacifist.  Why was this war still happening?  Nobody knew, but the anger and hatred was still in full demand.  They each continue fighting over who caused this accident to happen to our man under the mine.  Instead of helping and trying to save him, they fight.  I saw this as yet another ""jab"" against war.  Most of the time the soldiers are so upset that being a savior comes second nature to fighting.  We can definitely see this in our current battles overseas.

Another key element in this film was the lack of use in the media, and the way that the UN is portrayed.  First, the role of the media in this film.  While they were key in brining the UN to the site of the accident, they are not very forceful in knowing the truth.  I found this to be shocking and very realistic at the same time.  They got their story, they pulled their ratings out of the ground, but the need to know the truth and to be of some help was obviously lacking.  This was a huge punch in the media's faces.  They are portrayed as cold, heartless celebrities that use the camera as their weapon of choice.  Let us not forget the UN as well.  No Man's Land hugely knocks the role of the UN in this conflict.  One of the quotes from this film, ""Neutrality does not exist in the face of murder. Doing nothing to stop it is, in fact, choosing. It is not being neutral"" is a direct slam on to the policies of the UN.  For most of these conflicts, troops are there to keep the peace, not to interfere.  Therefore, the UN is asking their troops to ignore the violence, and allow the UN to be there just to say they were there.  This is obviously the way that director Danis Tanovic wanted to portray the UN and it came out very clearly.  It was a genuinely emotional scene that seemed to resonate from the director's heart.

Overall, this was a decent film.  I was expecting much more than what was present due to the fact that it beat out Amelie for best Foreign Film at the Oscars, but it carried itself well.  I felt it could have been more comical and a little less politically social commentary.  By the first thirty minutes of this film I could see what the director wanted to accomplish and I needed something different.  I wanted to be shocked and surprised, but instead I found a half-creative film that could have pushed the envelope a bit more to allow it to reach new heights.  I think you should see it once, but a second viewing is right out of the question.  Instead, spend more time seeing Amelie.

1681185,5,B000060MUZ,"""No Man's Land,"" starring Branko Djuric as Ciki (pronounced Tcheeky) and Rene Bitorajac as Nino shows the pragmatics of war. These two men represent each side of the Serbian-Bosnian conflict.

Both are convinced that the other side started it, and later, both are convinced the other side is bombing them directly. Both learn of the injustices done in the name of war done by their own side.

The tension of the story is not the war, but the survival of three men, Ciki, Nino, and Cera (pronounced Tsera, played by Filip Sovagovic).

Ciki, a Bosnian, and Nino, a Serb, end up in a foxhole. Neither wants to be there, and both need the other to get out alive. They don't care about the other, even as they find some common ground like a former lover they each had. The war and its wage of death is the vault between them truly acknowledging the other's humanity, but they lean on each other awkwardly, but effectively to persuade the UN to save them, and Cera, also a Bosnian.

The trouble is that Cera lays upon a mine that will detonate when he moves. Naturally, then, he stays still. The fear of the mine blowing up provides the need for them to work toward a solution. With no obvious fix, they attract the UN, who are a mix of competent and incompetent, passive and intentional leaders. The UN's indecisiveness jeopardizes the soldiers, and their philosophical unwillingness to resolve the problem only exacerbates the anger between the soldiers.

It carefully stands away from the divisive, bitter fight, indicating that the both sides aren't pure in motivation. Each character is so far removed from whatever started the conflict, that any ending becomes a tragedy.

There are two sides to any war: those who are governing it, and those who are fighting in it. Within that war, among those fighting in it, are two more sides: those who believe in the fight, and those conscripted to be there. All are part of this movie.

""No Man's Land"" shows that the Big Muddy, as Pete Seeger once sang of WWII, is not just in 1942 or Vietnam. In the trenches, as a force of war's reality, evil occurs. It is the default of war that men are asked to kill, and it is the default of man that the living will die.

I fully recommend ""No Man's Land."" For a look at a similarly powerful movie about the Irish conflict, see Daniel Day-Lewis and Emma Thompson in 1994's ""In the Name of the Father.""

This was the oscar winner when an indian film called Lagaan was nominated,  and i wondered what  could be better than a brilliantly made film like Lagaan.  But after watching No mans Land,  i think Lagaan really did not have even the slightest chance of winning the covetted oscars
Watch it people,  it taught me to be more humble and humane in life",1077753600,4,457,4.369047619047619
1681187,4,B000060MUZ,"Shot in a sort of ""reality TV"" way, the movie takes you through what seems to be a simple enough situation - 3 men caught in the dividing line between 2 warring sides and need people to rescue them. The ensuing chaos and confusion results, after the UN had to be called in to resolve this issue... one of the men had been laid onto a booby trap which will detonate if he moves, which complicates things even further. The news reporters representing the big news networks around the world are portrayed as anything but angels, so are the UN peacekeepers who are supposedly stationed there to keep peace. There aren't special effects in this movie, a number of shoot-them-up scenes but witty dialogue, a great script and convincing acting dominated the whole movie.  It may not be as politically correct as some people would have preferred, but it is a valid perspective anyway, depending on whose side you're with. This movie is based on the real-life Balkan war that happened not so long ago. The length of the movie (it seemed to have taken almost 2.5 or 3 hours to watch)  is probably why I took off a star for this review.... a storyline as this, although supported by great dialogue and acting, shouldn't have taken so long to finish... Still, it was funny, entertaining, and serious at the same time. Definitely worth watching!",1072310400,3,1332,4.663829787234042
1681188,5,B000060MUZ,"""No Man's Land"" is a triumphant and dark satire with raw power that is both undeniable and mesmerizing.  And that says a lot, being that I'm not the biggest fan of foreign films.  The film is funny and tragic at the same time.  Very rarely can you come across a decent movie that can successfully combine drama with comedy, let alone finding one that is superb.  ""No Man's Land"" is indeed superb on all levels.
The film takes place during the horrific Bosnian-Serb conflict.  In a strange turn-of-events, a Bosnian soldier ends up being trapped with a Serbian soldier in a trench (a wounded comrade of the Bosnian soldier is also in the trench).  Both the Bosnian and Serbian sides refuse to help the two, so it's up to the UN to try to come up with a reasonable solution.  Now, that would sound like a great idea, except the UN is portrayed as being extremely lazy and incompetent.  While in the trench, the two armed soldiers have nothing to do but to wait for help... that is, if they don't kill each other first.
This is a unique film that is fresh and daring.  Not a single boring minute went by during my whole viewing of the movie.  It's tragic, and yet comical.  The movie is able to work on every emotion, which is something that is very hard for a film to do successfully.  While it is indeed a satire, the film does a good job of setting up the stage for the Bosnian-Serb conflict and gives us an idea of what was happening during that time.  It's a film that will make you want to learn more about the conflict, which is something I highly recommend.  After you read more about it, then watch the movie again and I guarantee you that you'll enjoy it a lot more the second time around.
The DVD is pretty standard, offering very little special features.  The picture quality is crystal clear and the sound is great.  The movie offers English, French and Spanish subtitles.  Don't let the subtitles scare you, as they are extremely easy to read and follow.  It's also easy to tell what's going on without reading too much into it.  The only special feature available, aside from the subtitles, is the original theatrical trailer.
""No Man's Land"" is an unforgettable experience that portrays a dark time in history.  It is comical and sad at the same time.  For somebody who isn't the biggest fan of foreign films, I must admit that I loved this movie.  An interesting viewing, if you ask me.",1070064000,5,2400,4.468965517241379
1681189,4,B000060MUZ,"""No Man's Land"" is a great movie that deals with the Bosnian War.  It has many unique scenes that give the audience more enjoyment to watch.  The storyline was wonderfully written.  It blends multiple stories into one movie.  This is highly difficult considering most of it explores trying to rescue a soldier from a mine that'll detinate if he moves.  The acting is great.  The gun shootouts scenes, they express their characters' life threateneng terror realistic looking.  The environment (the set) looks as if an actual war is breaking, which is good.  Such wonderful efforts deserved the Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Film(spoken mostly in sebro-croatian).  It later won.  ""No Man's Land"" is a great movie for those looking for action and drama.  Such substance will keep everyone entertained.",1068422400,,802,5.1395348837209305
1681190,5,B000060MUZ,"I couldn't help but love this movie. The writing is amazing, the acting is top-notch, and the story is simple and moving. I was compelled by every moment of this movie.
(...)
This aside, there are no flaws in this movie. It is perfectly done. The acting, as I said, is amazing. You even forget that the actors aren't speaking English throughout most of the movie. Particularly good was the Bosnian soldier sitting on a mine. He knows that if he moves, he's dead. He knows they can't defuse the mine. He's dead, he knows it, and it shows. It would be really easy to overplay or underplay this part, but the actor (I can't recall his name) does it perfectly. He doesn't wail about ""woe is me"" as you'd suspect. He takes it like a man when others are around, his only comment being ""Why is this happening to me?"" Yet, when the others aren't looking, there's a particularly powerful scene in which he silently cries to himself.
Another notable part is the French Sergeant. He's the crusader; he's sick of sitting around doing nothing. Yet, even by doing something he ultimately does nothing. Brilliant.
I would highly recommend this movie to any who want a real perspective on the Bosnian war, or the futility of war in general. I would give it six stars if I could.",1064102400,,1262,4.5152838427947595
1681191,5,B000060MUZ,This is an excellantmovie on the insanity of war but it is much more than that.  It is also the amazing ineptness and weakness of the UN forces.  Perhaps the greatest achievement of the film is the intimate protrayal of the Balkan situation.  The madness of the ideas of ethnic cleanliness which can be found in all the countries of the Balkans is a difficult thing to portray in film.  This could only have been done by a native of the pennisula who understands its problem.  The only real drawback is that the translation of the English subtitles are not as exact as I would have liked but that doesnt really detract from the film as a whole.,1060300800,,644,4.423728813559322
1681192,5,B000060MUZ,"Perhaps this is out of line but from a Western point of view Muslims persecute those who are of a Western background.  As this movie shows and as anyone who is relatively informed of world events knows, Muslims are also persecuted.  This movie takes the viewer, in a modern day Catch-22, into the heart of the conflict: individuals.
The movie is strangely lacking in sensationalism.  It presents situations and the slow unfolding of the situation.  It is the subtlety of the characters' interaction with one another that allows the drama to unfold.  The drama begins with human beings and human beings reveal why it is that war is so complex.  In the trench in which the movie unfolds, the human element begins to surface.  We feel a connection with all of the characters and while we may not understand we begin to feel.
The Serbian and the Bosnian, bitter enemies, find connection on a human plane.  One of the Frenchmen working for the 'neutral' United Nation's peacekeeping force shows his human side when he tires of playing passive observing, revealing that not to choose sides is to choose sides.  The British television journalist shows her human side when she begins to understand the fine line between good journalism and exploitation.  Even the man sitting on the mine shows just how human all of this is.  All these elements merge in the trench.
While I watched it in subtitles it became obvious that the language differences revealed just how complicated human interaction can be. Something as seemingly simple as failure to communicate can not only be bridged by tragedy but how failure to communicate can lead to tragedy as well.
From a Western point of view, the world is pretty much black and white, good guys and bad guys, win or lose, right or wrong.  This movie slowly reveals, with the 'Western' mode of thought shown as complicating rather than helping, the absurdity of war.  There are no easy answers, war is never so cut and dry as we seem to sometimes think.
There are no clear answers, we can never really know or understand what happens to men during warfare and we are ultimately all just human beings in the end with all our complications.  War is complicated.  So are we.  This movie unfolds the complication from a very human point of view that shuns Hollywood's antics.  And it does so brilliantly.
The movie has lingered with me in a way few movies have.",1058832000,,2388,4.729468599033816
1681193,5,B000060MUZ,"As soon as I finished watching this film I went onto the Academy database to find out what film won Best Picture the year that NO MAN'S LAND won Best Foreign Film. The year was 2001 and A BEAUTIFUL MIND won, which I watched last week (it's summer, I'm playing catch-up).
Nothing against A BEAUTIFUL MIND (which was certainly an excellent film,in spite of the controversy over what was fact and what was fiction), but were it not for the incredible ignorance of people who refuse to see films with subtitles, NO MAN'S LAND could have taken the top prize. This film never takes a false step-- even as it tackles the enormously controversial (there's that word again) subject of the conflict in Yugoslavia, the film refuses to take any side but one of rationality in a place that had none.
The situation is simply set up. A Croatian relief patrol, lost in fog, is killed by Serb forces except for one soldier, who falls into a trench between lines-- later found by a two-man Serb patrol looking to secure the area. Certainly the Serbs have been widely regarded as the ""bad guys"" by the court of public opinion (as well as The Hague), but in Nino (Rene Bitorajac) we are given not a villain but a young soldier who can spout rhetoric but really doesn't know what he's doing or why he's doing it. On the other hand, it is Nino's companion who rigs the mine beneath Cera (Filip Sovagovic) with the intent of blowing up whoever tries to recover the dead-- a decidedly atrocious act, particularly when Cera proves to be merely unconscious and thus has the rudest of awakenings when he realizes his situation. Then we have Cera's friend and fellow soldier, Ciki (Branco Djuric), who hates Nino not only for the war but for what has been perpetrated on his friend.
Lest you think that this is a film of wartime angst, I hasten to add that Nino, Ciki, and Cera are able to cope with their situation with dark humor (""Who started the war?"" ""You started it!"" ""You started it!"" ""You started it!"" ""Who has the gun? Now who started the war!"") and ultimately some small level of cooperation in order to get out of the trench without having either side fire on them (their solution is both ingenious and funny). It's at this point the ""alphabet soup"" of cultures really begins. Both sides call in U.N. peacekeepers (colloquially referred to as ""Smurfs""), who are French, a British television crew who has been monitoring the radio frequencies shows up to cover the developing story, and finally a bomb expert is called in to try to extricate Cera-- and the expert is German. Thank heavens for subtitles, because by this time everyone in the audience needs them!
Of course the situation, already tense, is exacerbated by the U.N., who is afraid to do anything lest they be accused of taking sides, and the camera crews, who offend the combatants by their mere presence. We are given so many elements here that I had no idea how film would end until it actually did-- there were so many ways it could have gone. Along the way we are given other characters to care about, especially Jane Livingstone, the British reporter (Katrin Cartlidge), who is after the story but also would like to see the U.N. forced into action, and Marchand, one of the U.N. peacekeepers(George Statdis), whose humanity and conscience will not allow him to simply walk away-- even when ordered to do just that.
Ultimately there are no winners in war, and to that degree this film IS an anti-war statement. But the main purpose here is to show what happens to human character in untenable situations. Roger Ebert, in his review, mentions that he was not prepared for the beauty of the film-- Yugoslavia is STILL a beautiful country, no matter how war-ravaged. The final image is one of stillness, aching in its simplicity-- just as Thoreau said ""In Wildness is the Preservation of the World,"" preservation also lies in learning to be still.",1057968000,,3894,4.653120464441219
1681224,5,B000060MUZ,"If you're looking for a hero war movie, like ""wave the flag"" type ones and so on, you won't like this movie. It does not contain screaming rednecks with M16 riffles, no action scenes, no military gadgets are used (except one murderous bouncing mine) nothing for the couch warrior, nothing for the weaposn addict, nothing for budweiser and BBQ steak consumers. If you're a marines or seals fan, your IQ is probably (with some exceptions) not high enough to enjoy this movie.
This movie is about how stupid war can be, how mean the circumstances can be, how stupid the people in charge can be. There is nothing cool in wars. The heroes are loosers even though they may become successful businessmen and women after the war. Unless a nation defends it's own territory, there is no reason to participate in a war. The absurdity of war is reflected by this movie better than many movies before. If you are a war fan and have the patience to watch this movie to the end and understand it, you will probably change your mind.
The serbian/croatian/bosnian conflict destroyed one of the main centres of European culture, that was Sarajevo. One of the actors in this movie, Branko Djuric, was one of the members of the comedy group ""Toplista Nadrealista"" that was one of the best political comedy shows I ever saw in my life. Emir Kusturica, one of the most acclaimed independent directors in the business, was also working in Sarajevo. Not to mention the multitude of rock and pop bands emerging from Sarajevo. Yougoslavia was a country that had 4 (no other country on earth had that many) centers of major culture: Belgrade, Ljublijana, Sarajevo and Zagreb. The artists colaborated and there were huge synergy flows between the 4 cities. The war ended that. At this time, the region (there is no real YU anymore) is licking its wouds and tries to recover. However it will take a long time until the hate (that is so perfectly reproduced in the movie) will go away and the artists will find the way to each other again.",1056844800,4,2010,4.664788732394366

1681226,5,B000060MUZ,"Sometimes the best movies are crafted from simple concepts, leaving the screenwriter and filmmakers a much larger canvas to work with to create a film with a story which is both enriching and emotionally rewarding for its audience. NO MAN'S LAND is one such film. Winner of the 2002 Oscar and Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film, and the recipient of a Jury Prize at Cannes, NO MAN'S LAND is a movie which manages to cleverly send up the bleakness of war while letting the black humor complement the film as opposed to lessening its impact.
This Bosnian film, written and directed by Danis Tanovic; centres around  Ciki, a Bosnian troop who is wounded by enemy fire and seeks refuge in a nearby trench only to find himself trapped with one of his wounded comrades ... and one of his Serbian enemies. What makes a bad situation worse is that Ciki's ally is caught on a spring loaded bomb which wil detonate if he moves, killing all three of them, so the only option that offers hope for the trio's survival is for Ciki to trust his enemy while he goes and gets UN assistance for his friend.
It sounds like from here the film will be a huge bore: two enemy troops stuck in a trench relying on trust for survival.  If this were a RAMBO movie Sly would have just contorted his facial muscles, grunted and pumped the sucker full of shells, screaming while his pecs quivered with a life of their own. But NO MAN'S LAND is more cerebral, and one of the best movies I've seen so far this year. The visual design of the movie is superb, with believable performances and a plausible yet acerbically witty script. A definate must see. For people who would avoid NO MAN'S LAND on the basis that the movie is subtitled, now's probably a good time to expand your viewing horizons a little and give this a try.

1681227,4,B000060MUZ,"Obviously, you don't need to have a big budget to make a good movie, as No Man's Land has proven.  The story-line is simple enough, a Bosnian & a Serb is trapped in a trench.  One of their fallen comrades needs to be rescued & yet, it can't be done simply as he's lying on a landmine.  During their free-hours, the enemies try to reason who's at fault for starting the war at the first place; & how can we not laugh when one of the Bosnian Commander feels disgusted with the genocide happening in Rwanda as he read it from the newspaper whilst genocide is happening right at his own backyard.  United Nation is portrayed as a huge bureaucratic blunder.  Its intention is genuine & meant well but then again, it remains ineffective for resolving the conflicts in the region.  In the end, everybody is a loser.  We have been told many times before about the senselessness of war & yet, United States has just finished its war with Iraq & shifting its attention to Syria.  We simply don't learn from history, I take it.  An uneasy & unsettling movie to sit through despite its hillarious moment.  Highly recommended & definitely deserving its Oscars.",1052092800,,1147,4.5512195121951216
1681228,5,B000060MUZ,"Here we have Catch-22 updated replacing the island of Pianosa and WWII with a trench in No-man's Land between the Bosnian and Serb front lines in the Bosnian War.  Tanovic's rendering of an intricate story-line is powerful and told with biting, subtle, and satirical black humor.  Tanovic comes across as an insider and a witness (which no doubt he was) to the pointless atrocities and dirty warfare that the real world break-up of Yugoslavia and successive Serbian wars created.
Some of the films funnier moments prove Tanovic's insight into the UN, world media, and the pointlessness of the war.  When a German Explosive Ordnance Expert is to show up, the French UN members wonder where he is.  They watch the clock, say he is supposed to show at 3:30 and sure enough when the clock rolls to the half hour, the German promptly drives up.  Both the Bosnian  and Serbian Field commanders put in calls to UNPROFOR to resolve a situation when two half-naked people parade around No Man's Land waving white flags.
The plot line basics have been well-covered by other reviewers, so I will move to my observations.  The reason this movie garners such well-deserved praise is that it very artfully and entertainingly drives home a powerful message and agenda that has topical implications to ongoing world events.  It questions the function of the United Nations engagement in simply a ""sidelines"" non-interventionist humanitarian role when atrocities of war are ongoing.  It reinforces the wastefulness of war.  It highlights the international media's crucial but sometimes manipulative role in modern war coverage.  But most of all, it tells a story we care about...a story that matters.
And as we are asked these days to draw lines in the sand, the French Sergeant Marshand words ring true, ""You can't be neutral facing murder. Doing nothing to stop it is taking sides.""  Though as politically charged as that statement is and this movie implies, the movie never preaches.  The message is in the art and as bitingly sharp as Joseph Heller's Catch-22 was in its day.  This is a great and relevant war movie for these times and all times.",1050192000,,2133,4.921787709497207
1681229,5,B000060MUZ,"It is the funny side of war, if war has anything funny about it, yet in the end it leaves you pondering some things. For example: hate, sorrow, the duty to your country and the duty to your fellow man. It's got a couple of absurdities but that's exactly what makes it comic. There's a point where the bosnian soldier tells the serb soldier about a girl he slept with and he describes her and it turns out that the other one went to school with her. The way they talk about it would make you think they're aquaintances of old talking about common friends. That's my favourite part. I couldn't stop laughing. Then you have the third charater lying on a mine and afraid to move, yet spitting sarcastic remarks every chance he gets. I guess that lying on a mine, ready to explode if you move, gives you a rather good insight into bitternes.  Do watch it. The place it was filmed in is beautiful, even if it's scarred by war. So if by now you feel confused, watch the movie, then you'll know what I mean. I'm sure this helped.",1046390400,,1021,4.290155440414508

I wasn't expecting the unconventional ending, so my opinion of the movie wasn't too positively enthusiastic. When I watched it another time, I was aware of the storyline and my observance of the details and circustances was better this time around. By the end of the second viewing, I fell in love with the film. Since then, I've watched it twice more.

1681231,5,B000060MUZ,"This compelling tale underscores the futility of war and the complete impotence of the UNPROFOR to make any difference in the civil unrest in the Balkans. The story begins as two soldiers, a war-weathered Bosnian and a rookie-soldier Serb, become stranded in a trench in ""no man's land"" together. The Serb's friend and fellow soldier is also in the trench, lying on top of a bouncing mine, which will detonante if he moves. The film shows the efforts of the the soldiers to elicit rescue by UNPROFOR peacekeepers. There tension and hostility between the soldiers in the trench alternate with moments of kindness, even tenderness, and genuine teamwork in their effort for rescue, until they remember that they hate each other. The French peacekeepers are ordered not to take action by their British commander, because it is too dangerous. A cunning French peacekeeper works behind the scenes, in conjunction with a BBC journalist, to pressure UNPROFOR to permit them to attempt an evacuation of the stranded soldiers. In the end, the rescue effort is to no avail and none of the three stranded soldiers are rescued alive. The movie is very real, from the Bosnian soldier's high-top basketball sneakers, the French UNPROFOR peacekeeper snoozing on duty, the Bosnian commander's lew flirting with the BBC journalist.

1681267,5,B000060MUZ,"Stunning photography, simple story, real-life problem, great piece of acting and no-hero centric play form the success of the oscar winning movie.
The movie revolves around 3 men who are trapped in the trench of a land surrounded by both Serbia and Bosnia and part of neither. The rivalry between the countries is well exemplified by the two that argue while trapped in the trench - one trying to kill another and show the vengence and one not allowing other to survive, Wow! beautifully taken. When the two identify a girl that both know, they should become friends but the hatred between the countries overrides them. The dialogues are really punching.
Also shown well is the media trying to make out of all these. Humanity is not behind all these acts. Although it is true that media helps in some cases, sometimes this is more driving.
And so is the ending; though the movie ends in a tragedy, the director has done an excellent job of leaving the solution to the problem. The soldiers who are trapped are dead and made dead and so what is it for the whole saga is? Very complicated question. Countries that fight across the border have to think seriously about this. The culprits are the innocent soldiers who are trapped.
Though the movie is in multiple languages, I did not have a problem understanding the movie as the theme is universal (Of course there was sub-titles).

1681268,5,B000060MUZ,"Eschewing the well-worn path of filmed fighting and choosing to embark on a mission of spotlighting international bureaucracy, director Brank Djuric shines in ""No Man's Land"" at a radiance brighter than any other war movie in recent memory.
The movie grabs its backdrop from the warm years of conflict in the so-called ""powder-keg"" of Europe -- the Balkans -- and thrusts two individuals from each side into a stew of regret, fighting, and an increasingly awful awareness that they are more alike each other than each had suspected.  A black comedy designed to make the viewer think more about the vagaries of war and less about the particulars of the Bosnian/Serb conflict, it deeply uncovers the fact that war has almost always been a tool for leaders, rather than simply one dispatched upon by individuals.
Further scenes highlight a chain of humanity that is consistently broken by the forces of power politics that accompany any modern-day war. Given different circumstances and different propaganda, sharing a lager in Belgrade would not have been hard to see.
But that is not to be. What ""No Man's Land"" highlights so much better than the sappy ""Saving Private Ryan"" or obtuse ""The Thin Red Line"" is that, when geopolitics are being played on a grand chessboard, it never truly will. Not many leaders really mind about the pawns.",1040860800,3,1336,4.964285714285714

As historical and political education, this film should be seen in high school and college classes across the nation.  I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars only because the film editing should've/could've been better...the first 15 minutes are pretty slow getting off the ground.  Better camera work and sound would've made this film much more visceral and hard-hitting...then again, I'm sure the director didn't exactly enjoy a Hollywood budget.

Told with dark humor, and with an unforgettable central metaphor illustrating the paralysis of action when faced with an insolvable dilemma, this film is realistic while delineating the aburdity of it all.
We get the two former neighbors that knew the same girl, and by any measure should be friends, unable to keep peace amongst themselves long enough to allow a third man in a terrible predicament to be saved.  We have French UN peacekeepers frustrated because they can't keep any kind of peace.  We have UN commanders doing anything they can to avoid an action or a decision.  We have media anxious to get the story and we have everyone lieing to everyone else.  And in the middle of it all we have one poor...with the worst luck imagineable.
The random unfairness of war is what we have, drawn in swift and sure strokes by someone who (I would imagine) has seen it all first hand.  Told impartially, there are no heroes here, there are no sides taken, and we are left in the end with the a last and final haunting image that is nothing but pure futility.  No move is a good move, no action is a right action, and the absurdity of the situation is only surpassed by its tragic & cruel irony.
Tough and true reporting from the frontlines.  Well worthwhile.",1037664000,5,1371,4.522267206477733

This movie is a powerful metaphor for the 1992-1995 war that, indeed, blew Bosnia to pieces.  Bosnia, caught in an empty No Man's Land.  In the beginning it was just the Bosniaks and Serbs and Croats down in the hole, nobody else paid attention.  Then came the UN with their empty-headed platitudes and unwillingness to do the hard work required to stop the war.  Then came the press, generally well-meaning and sporadically courageous, but cursed with a short attention span, an addiction to prurient images, and an inability to truly understand the depths of the conflict and what lay beyond the visual images.
This was the war.  Finally, the UN left, then the press left.  And there lay Bosnia, prostrate in the sun and blown to pieces.",1036540800,6,932,4.823899371069182
1681273,5,B000060MUZ,"Academy Award winner in 2002 for Best Foreign Film, this film about the recent war between the Bosnians and Serbs is not only grimly realistic, it is also is a metaphor on the absurdity of war in general.  When two soldiers from opposing forces become trapped in a trench together, the seriousness of the situation escalates when a third wounded soldier, at first presumed dead, is actually alive.  Problem is that he has been placed on a mine that will kill them all if he is moved.  And, as the soldiers argue, it becomes clear that the one with the gun is the one who will always win the argument.  Eventually, the UN becomes involved and the absurdity thickens.  There were parts in the film where I laughed out loud, as the grim realism of the constant power struggles that are endemic to human nature are explored.
The titles were in English so I could follow the film, but one of the themes was that everyone spoke a different language, further complicating the matter.  There's the British diplomat, the French U.N. troops, the German land mine expert, and the three soldiers trapped in their outrageous situation.  The soldiers had a lot in common, speaking the same language and even had some common memories of a local girl they both knew.  And the scene is indeed comical when, in order to alert the U.N. officials to their situation, they both take off their uniforms and wave white flags.  But they are sworn enemies and want to kill each other also.
The acting is outstanding, with actors from that particular area of the world.  But the screenplay itself its one of the best I have ever scene.  Every bit of dialogue moved the action forward and was layered with meanings that went far beyond the situation.  The setting didn't require huge special effects and could actually be turned into a stage play although it might be hard to stage it in so many languages, as this ""tower of Babel"" kind of language confusion was one of the central themes of the film.
This film is destined to join the ranks of some of the greatest symbolic war films of all time, including ""The Red Badge of Courage"" and ""All Quiet on the Western Front.""  However, as this is a modern film, it includes the irony and absurdity that represent our culture today.  I give this film my highest recommendation.

1681275,5,B000060MUZ,"Above all else, this is a marvelous piece of filmmaking that achieves several purposes at once.  On one level, director Tanovic manages to personalize the war in Bosnia to a remarkable degree.  Just as Serbian soldier Nino is constantly trying to introduce himself to other people in the film, whether friend or foe, Tanovic introduces them to us.  We come to know them, and like them, and want them all the become friends with each other.  The film also manages to be funny, tragic, absurd, and sad, all at the same time.  The camera manages a slightly detached viewpoint throughout, enabling us to move easily from one very funny moment to an utterly tragic one with no apparent effort.
Reading many of the other reviews here, one could easily gain the impression that this is a film rife with political discussion of the relative merits/demits of each side of the struggle in Bosnia.  In fact, there far less political discussion in the film than one might expect.  The ""debate"" more or less consists of the two main protagonists forcing the other to admit under gunpoint that the other side had started the war.  The reason for the ideological vagueness is the film is not so much about the particular conflict in which it is set, but armed conflict in general.  The predominant effect of this film is to make the armed conflict come across as monumentally silly.  Tragic, yes, but silly for all that.
The movie also does a marvelous job of expressing the sense of futility and hopelessness over this and many other contemporary conflicts.  Anyone who has witnessed the recent joint absurdities in the West Bank is acutely aware of this.  Palestinians send out suicide bombers they know will provoke a military response from Israel, and Israel in turn engages in missile or helicopter attacks or military incursions into Palestinian neighborhoods that they know will provoke more suicide bombers.  One is left looking at the situation not know what the solution is.  Likewise, in this film, we are presented with a dilemma that we can't imagine being able to get out of.  And the ending (which I won't give away), illustrates this marvelously.",1028419200,4,2147,4.843835616438356

Starting off as absurdly funny, the movie gradually turns into a tragical symbol of the entire conflict with all its national and itnernational players.  The premise is simple--a Serbian and a Bosnian are trapped in a trench and cannot get out, because they will be shot by the other side. Overcomming initial hostility they become friends, only to succumb to the tension, century-old built-in distrust and at the end tragedy. I will not get into more details, but this simple plot provides the viewers with a very accurate descriptions of the emotions behind each side and the deadend, hopeless situations such long term tensions breed. If there is anything that this movie is trying to teach is that the situation is not that simple, that while the conflict is murderous, each side has is right in its own way.

Together, but with fear, distrust, and violence, they try to find a way out of the situation. To complicate matters, in the trench, the Serbs had placed a mine under the body of a Bosnian they thought was dead but was only knocked-out. He awakes, but if he moves all three will be blown up. I thought the film was an excellent study of two characters stuck together involuntarily, who, for their own mutual benefit, must learn to get along.
 I found it gripping. This is an anti-war movie. Neither the Bosnians not the Serbs are depicted as good or bad. The thing that lacked credibility was that given both soldier's wounds, I don't know how they managed to function at all. In real life I think they would have been in much greater pain, more incapacitated, suffering from shock and dehydration, etc.
There is a UN general who is portrayed as an incompetent goofball. He is concerned only with politics, procedures, and playing chess in his office with his pretty secretary. His one dimensional character didn't fit in with what was going on in the trench, and it didn't work as a contrast either. If the purpose was to show that he UN military command was impotent, they could have done it in a less silly manner.

I was not disappointed.  This film evokes the disparity of the war between these people---people who looked the same, spoke the same language, and had the same human emotions.  These people, thrown into conflict at the whim of their government are thrown into a trench together in the midst of a battle.
A Serb and a Bosnian soldier eloquently evoke the injustices of the war from both perspectives.  They even bring an aspect of hilarity to the irony of this conflict.  This film is so incredibly well-done it is difficult to review.
The UN forces are featured as well, and their lack of ability to do anything during this conflict is highlighted.
While it is a comedy, this film shows the despairity of this war, it's terrifying effect on people who lived for nearly 40 years as friends and neighbors, and the lack of assistance the UN provided for them.
This is the best film I have seen this year, hands down.  Minimal knowledge of the conflict is recommended, else some of the jokes and important moments may be lost.  Overall, it is an amazing work, to be enjoyed by all.

1681282,5,B000060MUZ,"Usually movies that are morally ambiguous do not appeal to me.  Happy endings and clear cut morals are the reasons I watch movies.
In No Man's Land, however, the moral is that there are no morals and we should not rush to make moral distinctions.  The movie is a critique of the foreign policy of NATO/U.S. based on a single incident.
Two Bosnians are trapped between Serb-Bosnian lines while on a patrol in heavy fogg.  One is grieviously wounded (and presumed dead) and when two Serbs show up the unwounded Bosnian hides while the Serbs booby-trap the wounded man with a landmine.  The remaining Bosnian kills one Serb and wounds the other.
Predictably, the Bosnian and the Serb trade accusations over who started the war and the answer invariably lies with the disarmed soldier.  Alternately, they are bitter enemies and reluctant adversaries.
When a do-gooding French Sergeant comes to the rescue, he learns that the answer to ending the conflict between the two men is not as simple as he initially believed.
The allegory is that when the great powers intervene, they must recognize the intractability of ethnic conflict and that the moral high ground generally lies with whomever can say: ""Because I have the gun.""",1022025600,2,1220,4.902912621359223

1681284,5,B000060MUZ,"A most deserving winner of the Academy Awards for Best Foreign Film, No Man's Land boasts a script that is complex and disturbing and unflinchingly honest. Danis Tanovic is the genius behind the understated film that examines the role of U.N in the Bosnia-Serbia skirmish with dark and sardonic satire. It tells of a Bosnia-relief group attacked and mired at the frontline. Chiki (Branko Djuric) and Cera (Filip Savogoric) are the sole survivor but even that their fate is undecidedly perilous when a vicious Serb soldier accompanies novice Nino (Rene Bitorajac) to plant a bomb under Cera. It is detonated by pressure-release. Cera is immobilized and Chiki is reluctant to leave him. Nino is held hostage. U.N. sergeant Marchand (George Statdis) cannot bear to watch further - he decides to engage his men to relief the situation.
No Man's Land may deceptively be high-brow and slow-moving but the impact of the film comes out only after the movie which engages you to reflect. It is seethingly savage in reflecting the paradox of war and offers refreshing insight in the intervention of U.N. Compassion is helpless in extinguishing the mindless hatred between Bosnia and Serbs; one wonders when can U.N be ever neutral in a war. Reporters are news-ravenous and profits from their misery. The difference in culture further extracts the U.N from really interacting with both sides. What's most memorable is the cross-fire between Nino and Chiki in deciding who started the war. Questioning slowly becomes an intimidation to make each other admit that they are at fault.
No Man's Land is highly original and even more outstanding for the fine performances from the cast. It is hauntingly disturbing especially in its climax and simplifies the situation without compromising on the material. Unlike most war-film that examines the brutalities, No Man's Land is a brutal dissection of the rationale of intervention and its limitations.",1020038400,5,1932,5.156050955414012
1681285,4,B000060MUZ,"This movie is a great satire about the absurdity of the Yugoslavian conflict, in particular the happenings in Bosnia.  What I like about this film is Danis Tanovic's unwillingness to make any of his characters likable.  The soldiers trapped in the trench are portrayed as steeped in illogical hatred.  The reporters are shown as jackals.  UNPROFOR is cast as ineffectual or flat-out stupid.  The only character you can really root for is Marchand (a U.N. 'Smurf' sick of sitting on the sidelines).
The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because I really thought ""Amelie"" (against which 'NML' competed for the 2001 'Best Foreign Film' Oscar) was the superior film.  Yes, I know the genres are totally different.  Too bad the MPAA doesn't go the Golden Globe route and give a comedy a chance against a brilliant 'message movie' like ""No Man's Land.""",1019952000,,860,4.809523809523809
1681306,5,B000060MUZ,"""War; What is it good for; Absolutely nothing!"" So goes the famous song by Edwin Starr. And No Man's Land is such a film that ventures out to prove that statement. Not through massive amounts of violence and bloodshed, nor through grieving families. Rather, No Man's Land is a film that uses human characters and their emotions to convey this message across, and it does so very well.
No Man's Land has a very simple premise, yet uses it to full effect. The film's background is set against the Balkan Conflict of 92-95. While fighting is going on, two soldiers get trapped in the same trench, and both soldiers, Chiki and Nino, are from opposite sides of the war. Also in the trench is another Bosnian soldier, Cera, who is lying on a mine, which will detonate if he moves at all. Eventually, Chiki and Nino have to learn to keep calm before they can get out of there. They begin talking, and neither really understands why this war is being fought and points fingers at the other side. In between such talks, hostilities increase as both soldiers constantly threaten to kill each other. Meanwhile, Cera is stuck on the mine, and is the only one who stays calm throughout. Eventually the matter gets spread to the United Nations, as well as to the international media (who tapped in on the UN's radio frequency to get information) as the struggle to save the soldiers rages on.

The director, Danis Tanovic, succeeds in portraying these events very well. The characters he creates are portrayed as actual emotions, and succeeds in carrying these emotions over to the viewer. One cannot help but feel pity towards Cera, Chiki and Nino at some times, and anger at others. The media is portrayed in a negative way as the reporters stir up trouble only to improve their fame and pay. The viewer is made to hate the incompetent leaders who refuse to take action to save the soldiers, while admiring the brave UN soldiers who work their hardest to save the three men. The discussions between Chiki and Nino are quite the highlight, as their relationship fluctuates throughout. At one time, they might as well be best friends, discovering that there was a common friend between them, while at the other, they are worst enemies, ready to take the life of the other away in an instant. Their relationship continues as such until the final climax. Cera is the one who represents reason and rationality and keeps both men calm and controlled for a limited period of time.
Though No Man's Land is a low-budget film, it doesn't scream of poor production values at all. The battles depicted are small scale; nowhere near Speilberg, but effective nonetheless. Most of the film takes place in the one small trench, with a few segments just on the front lines, and around the UN offices. Additionally, the use of language throughout is well-done. Most conversations are done in the local Bosnian language, while the UN troops switch between French and English, adding to the realism of the film, and introducing the communication problem between the different forces throughout.
Speaking of language, the script of No Man's Land is, for most part, well-done. The people's emotions are captured very well through the type of language they use. The conversations between Chiki and Nino are well-written, humorous, and thought-provoking. The only real weakness in the script lies in the clich of the scenes involving the media. Such lines have been used many times in the past before which involved negative depiction of the media in war situations (e.g. Three Kings).
Sound throughout the film is used quite well. Most of the scenes are pure dialogue with no dramatic background music; just plain silence. And this silence is used to great effect to bring the environment and tensions of war out.
The actors essay their individual roles quite well. Branko Djuric (Chikki), Filip Sovagovic (Cera) and Rene Bitorajac (Nino) both act out their respective roles very well. Their characters are brought to life, and the viewer is lead to believe that these men are actual soldiers themselves who have dealt with similar situations before. The UN officers do just as well, especially Georges Siatidis, with whom we share his frustrations. Katrin Cartlidge as reporter Jane Livingstone is good. She follows many of the aforementioned clichs of members of the press, but does a good job doing so.
Direction is well-done and helps the movie flow. The events are brought about in a very believable manner at a believable pace. The whole movie moves at a semi-brisk pace, with a lot of events taking place over a short period of time, yet the film doesn't feel rushed at all. The director works well at placing the viewer in the middle of all the action, as they try to understand the emotions displayed by the characters.
No Man's Land, unlike countless war films, make an anti-war statement effectively. As opposed to the bulk of war films that glorify war and give it the impression of being desirable, No Man's Land explores what war truly is: hell. And it does so through a simple depiction of events involving human characters, not through massive amounts of destruction or blood spill. This film truly is a modern classic, and was not entirely undeserving of the accolades it won (including the Golden Globe and Oscar for best foreign film). No Man's Land comes highly recommended.

1681307,5,B000060MUZ,"No Man's Land is possibly the best film that I've watched in a while. It's a poignant story of humanity and life. Against the backdrop of the Bosnian-Serb Civil War, the story revolves around a Bosnian and a Serbian soldier both trapped at the lines. Their only chance to bury the hatchet for once was ruined by the very cause that started the rivalry between them and their sides: the war. Both eventually opted for tit-for-tat actions that hurt each other while a third man layed motionlessly on top a bouncing mine waiting for rescue. The film exploits larger issues at hand: an over-emphasis on who's right and wrong and the lack of intervention by the UN. As the UN forces encountered the situation at hand, their eventual indifference shed some light on how by being non-interventionist could have resulted in the war going on forever. Perhaps it's time for reflection on what's important: saving lives or saving face?

1681308,5,B000060MUZ,"This powerful movie left me with mixed feelings. Being Bosnian myself, one of the hundreds of thousands whose life was affected with this fully unnecessary war, I was not prepared for conclusion of this movie. If we assume that key for the movie was the sentence 'Being neutral means taking a side...' (free interpretation), end of this movie brings the conclusion that there is nothing that could have helped Bosnian people; their hate and will to kill each other is stronger than their urge for survival. In a way, this movie is giving alibi to the rest of the world for doing nothing... anything... for years. I can hardly accept that, my personal belief is that foreign intervention could have brought end to this war much earlier (like it did, after almost 4 years of killing and suffering).  Insisting on neutrality was a death sentence for Bosnia and countless Bosnians. However...
In a best tradition of Bosnian movie making, this movie brings Bosnian spirit to shine, despite deficiencies in translation (sometimes impossible task, I agree, yet, some of translations to English are simply clumsy). I think this is a 'must see' movie, if for nothing else than for refreshing entertainment.

1681309,5,B000060MUZ,"Equal parts humor and horror, Danis Tanovic displays superior directorial ability in ""No Man's Land,"" which goes against the normal traditional war films, and takes a stand against its subject matter. Through the use of extremely dark and satirical humor, the film is a testament to the various absurdities of war, from the hatred those who fight it continually manufacture, to the senselessness of everything that goes on around its characters.
The story is filled with many characters, all of which play important roles in bringing forth the central message. The three men at the center of the mayhem are Bosnian soldiers Chiki (Branko Djuric) and his longtime pal Cera (Filip Sovagovic), both of whom are part of a relief team that becomes massacred by Serbian soldiers. After the bloodshed, Chiki finds himself in a trench between enemy lines, his entire team murdered before him.
Soon after, the Serbs send two men to search for survivors of the onslaught to take as prisoners. One of these men is Nino (Rene Bitorajac), a new addition to the front lines, and a nameless man who is killed when Chiki open fires on the two intruders. Nino is wounded, and taken prisoner, while Cera, who was wounded but not killed, regains consciousness only to discover that Nino and his comrad placed a bouncing mine underneath his ""dead"" body moments before they were taken down.
As the men begin bickering, Tanovic makes good use of the opportunity he is given, instilling the characters with black humor that is both humorous and meaningful when pondered. During an artillery storm, Chiki and Nino bicker over whose side it was that started the war; Chiki later ends the argument by pointing a gun at his enemy and forcing an admission of guilt from him, which Nino later uses against him once the power changes hands.
Moments such as these provide a hearty dose of laughs, but they go much further than that. The unusual relationship between Chiki and Nino takes many turns; at one point, they make the discovery of a mutual friend between the two of them, and they share a happy moment. In another time and place, these two men would be the best of friends; in this time and place, they hate each other because they are told to. This juxtaposition of different moments of friendship and angst brings home the feeling of senselessness and frustration that accompanies wars, and the unending search for answers as to its purpose.
Tanovic also chooses to instill much more into the film through various other well-drawn characters. A striving female reporter played by Katrin Cartlidge is a halting reminder of the exploitation of war through the media, while the U.N. high official, played by Simon Callow, is a provocative display of the indifference of other countries in such trying times. As the leader of a French unit in the humanitarian forces of the U.N., Marchand, played by Georges Siatidis, seems to have the clearest understanding of the events going on around him (""You can't be neutral facing murder. Doing nothing to stop it is taking sides."").
The beauty of a film like ""No Man's Land"" is its complexity: every subplot, every character and their hidden themes, all relates back to Cera, lying on his back with a mine underneath him. Each complex character, whether it be out of friendship, remorse for the placement of the mine, hunger for a breaking news story, or the yearning to make an impact on the ongoing battle in hopes of bringing it to an end, all of these messages are interconnected in a way that makes the film meaningful rather than just skillful.",1018656000,8,3569,4.833333333333333

Also in that trench is a Bosnian soldier who is lying under a bomb that, if it is detinated, will blow up everything in a fifty foot radius.

1681311,5,B000060MUZ,"I recently had the distinct pleasure of viewing this movie.
It's premise begins with two soldiers from opposing sides being
trapped in a trench between two armies fighting a civil war.
  Scene after scene of sidesplitting antics follow in rapid succession.
  Initially only one of the men is armed. He points his rifle at the other and demands to know which side started the war. Being intimidated by the muzzle at his head, our trembling gladiator replies ""we did"". During a moment of carelessness the
weapon changes hands, and again the question of who started the
war comes up, and so on.
  Another scene shows a soldier in another trench reading a
magazine and being horrified by the war in Rwanda, as if his cir-
cumstances were better. His expression alone was worth the price
of admission.
  In addition there is a third soldier in the trench. He was believed to be dead. While unconcious his body is placed on a
land mine and now he is unable to move without detonating it. He
is a comrade of one of the other two, who shows a great deal of compassion to his friend's plight by giving him water and scratching him when he itches. The feelings of pity quickly evap-
orate when our immobile friend states he has to go to the bath-
room.
  If things weren't zany enough, soon a French member of the UN
peacekeeping forces becomes involved in what has become an uneasy
truce. He hopes to deactivate the mine but has neither the equip-
ment or knowhow, and spends most of his screen presence trying to
find someone who speaks French or English. The chaos of so many different nationalties trying to communicate is a movie in its own right.
  Soon the UN high command dispatches a mine technician to aid
the now weary French unit. He of course is a German. The merriment continues unabated as several media types scurry to the unfolding events and bring even more craziness to what has
become a three ring circus.
  My only problem with the movie is the down turn it takes at
the end, but I won't give anymore of the plot away. All in all
though, the experience was certainly worthwhile!",1018396800,,2089,4.536
1681312,4,B000060MUZ,"This years Bosnia's Oscar candidate is a war satire about recent conflict in this area.
It is filled with Bosnian humor, which is ironic, black, self-mocking and bizarre.
Bosnian solders, his friend that is laying on a mine and his Serb enemy are caught in the trench between two lines. With nerves on the edge, the mine, that can explode any minute and bullets over their heads, even appearance of UN soldiers and TV crew doesn't calm things down until the grand finale, when (almost) everything is calm and peaceful again.
I agree with some critics that say that the story uses many war-film clichs. If you want another, more tragic view of conflicts in ex Yugoslavia, see  an excellent Macedonian film  `Before the Rain', which was also Oscar nominee some years ago and is in my opinion more truthful, honest and realistic.",1014768000,4,826,4.769230769230769

Having almost a documentary approach the film shows a couple of hours in the lives of two soldiers one Bosnian and another Serbian who happen to be caught in the same trench where another soldier lies on a mine that may be detonated by any move of his. Later on, two more forces will be added: the UN and the Press, giving a new breath to the movie. I won't give more about this film, because doing it would mean take the `pleausure' of those who haven't seen it yet.
More than clarifying, the film rises questions that expect to be answered by the audience. For instance, early in the movie, the two soldires argue which nation has started the war, blaming each other's country. Another insteresting point mentioned in the film that is hardly ever showed in the movies is the UN role in wars. The script is very well balanced, once it shows both sides of its work, there are soldiers who really want to help and do something to make the war over-- like Marchand --, but, on the other hand, some people only want publicity and play political games. Another thing is the difficulties that UN faces in order to at least try to help people, for instance, the communication is extremely hard, due to the fact that there are people from many places in the world and many of them can't even understand English, mainly the soldiers.
Some people complain that the screenplay is very clichd when it comes to the press, but I don't think so. It loosely reminded me of ""Three Kings"" -- which by the way is a terrific movie. I think the press is shown the way it is. They are desperate for breaking news; the reporters are dying for discoverying something brand new and exclusive, but it is hard, once everybody is covering the same war. The press looks inquisitive and it can be helpful sometimes, once one knows how to use them, see Marchand using a reporter to pressure his superiors to allow him to help the three soldiers.
The cast is very good. The native actors delivery extremely fine. I don't know if they've been to the war but they look as if they've been on the front for a long time. Seeing Katrin Cartlidge's face in the middle of all those people seemed like finding a friend in a hostile place. She is so fine as reporter that we root for her being able to telecast everthing without being censured by UN. But the one I liked most was the French actor Georges Siatidis -- who plays Marchand. We can easily see why he joined UN and how frustrated he is because he cannot help the soldiers, once his superiors forbide him of doing so. Most of the time he gives just one look and you can see all he means.
All in all, in this time of wars everywhere this film is very helpful. I don't think it is a kind of film for everybody, but it is, certainly, recomended for those who care about serious issues that may affect the world as a whole. The writer director Danis Tanovic deliveries a very disturbing and realistic film, showing that sometimes there are no solutions -- or help -- at all, and the only thing that can be done is avoiding start a new war.",1012176000,28,3187,4.367003367003367
1681314,5,B000060MUZ,"It's hard to believe this perfectly balanced very funny, dark war satire is the debut feature of writer-director Danis Tanovic. The film has been winning various Festival awards and took the best screenplay prize at Cannes.
I'll keep quiet about the too much of the plot because the film
is full of small moments that work best if they surprise you.
If you have the idea that this film is only about two guys in a trench who do some decent contemporary updated variation of Waiting for Godot you're in for a big surprise. There's a lot that transpires in the course of the film and characters do not just include a Serbian and Bosnian Soldier but others as well including a female t.v. reporter, several French members of a U.N. peacekeeping unit, a British commander (played by the only face some will recognize in the film: Simon Callow), a German bomb expert and others.
This is a sharp witty clever satire that is closer in spirit to
Preston Sturges and Duck Soup, than to Stanley Kubrick but isn't any less poignant in what it has to say about war, particularly the kind of wars fought throughout the middle east.
The film-maker is neutral and refuses to take sides, but the message of the film is clearly that remaining neutral in a conflict allows more killing and brutality to occur.
The film consistently surprises you. You literally aren't sure what will happen from moment to moment. Sometimes nothing, sometimes a great deal. Sometimes it's cruel, sometimes it's
laugh out loud funny, often it's both. Why are we looking at this beautiful shot of clouds and blue sky at one point in the film? Because it's what that guy on his back sees. But we don't realize that right away.
The film isn't flawless.  The main problem that's set up surely isn't quite the un-solvable problem it is portrayed to be, but that is also the point about how absurd conflicts often can be.
With every scene the film opens up. The tension increases and then we get to laugh a little more than we should and tension is relieved as the the conflict grows and gets less personal, but then the film comes full circle and delivers what it must--what we expected but almost forgot. It leaves us with a haunting image that reminds us what the stakes have always been. It's not exactly a surprise ending, but it's an ending that has been arrived at without the kind of crass trickery and pretenses we normally get in war films and particularly films that are war satires. There are so many way this film could have and probably should have failed, but instead It's not only successful it also feels fresh and sharp.
No Man's Land is a superb film, it's smart, funny and has something to say.  Put it at the top of your list and see it very soon.

Even at the end, you're left hanging (though it is a complete, rounded, fulfilling experience for the movie-goer). Real life wrapped in allegory--including masterful dialogue, incredible acting and brilliant direction--NML somehow clarifies one of the most confusing conflicts in the world. I had only a minor criticism:the further it gets from the main characters, the more it moves toward caricature. That aside, it is an absolute MUST SEE!!!",1009670400,4,581,5.53932584269663
