Fans who don't speak Japanese or intend to watch the series on blu-ray should stick to the American blu-rays, though, because this has no English subtitles. For a lot of people that alone will devalue this item, but they're so cheap now (Mine was only around $23) that this gets 5 stars from me.",1406764800,,422,4.4935064935064934
