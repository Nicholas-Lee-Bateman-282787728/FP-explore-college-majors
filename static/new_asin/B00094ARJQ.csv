2262018,1,B00094ARJQ,PRODUCT IS DAMAGED.  DOES NOT PLAY PROPERLY DURING LAST 15 MINUTES OR SO OF THE MOVIE.  I AM QUITE UPSET.,1156550400,,105,4.2
2262019,3,B00094ARJQ,"Its not often in hollywood that a movie comes along with an original idea,but with weekend at bernie's,thats what we get.

Weekend at bernie's stars andrew mcCarthy and johnathan silverman and terry kiser.the movie is about two office workers who find out that someone is stealing money from the company that they work for and they share that with thier boss(kiser)

So he rewards them for thier findings at a weekend at his house in the hamptons.then they discover that when they get there that thier boss has been murdered.then they decide that instead of going to the police,they pretend that old bernie didn't die.

What makes this movie funny is the fact that nobody notices that bernie is dead!

The movie also stars catherine mary stewart who i thought was the hottiest woman in the entire movie,and yes you heard me correctly.

All in all i give the movie 3 stars because of its original idea and because it wasn't made out to be something that it was supposed to be. If you like watching live people playing dead people then this is your cup of tea.",1140912000,7,1058,4.6063829787234045

2262150,5,B00094ARJQ,"Ah, Weekend At Bernie's. One of those movies that, let's just be honest, could have only worked well in the 80s. It just has that perfect 80s-ness to it.

Weekend At Bernie's came out in 1989, the tail end of the 1980s. Starring Jonathon Silverman and Andrew McCarthy, WAB is a movie about two accountants, Richard and Larry respectively, who work at a very successful insurance firm in New York City. Their boss and company CEO Bernie Lomax, played by Terry Kiser, has ties to a local organized crime crew and is embezzling from the company. At the beginning, Richard and Larry discover someone is ripping the company off. Alerting their boss, unknowing that it's Bernie himself stealing from the company. Bernie then arranges for not only them to come to his beach house over the weekend, but for his mob connections to have the two friends taken care of. However, it backfires when the mob boss has Bernie killed instead.

During a case of mixed connections, Richard and Larry find out about the deal (but not the fact the killer was never after them to begin with), get worried, and come up with a plan that basically is no one else knows Bernie is dead, so they'll keep the charade up that he's alive until they're able to get off the island.

Despite however morbid it sounds, it's far from it and is actually a light-hearted comedy. This is one of those movies I love watching and can watch this constantly when I want to. There's just something about the movie that I love and often has a cheering up effect on me. Andrew McCarthy, Jonathon Silverman, and Terry Kiser work very well in their performances.

Is the movie worth checking out? I would say yes.",1302566400,2,1664,4.592592592592593

They walk him around a resort, go boating with his remains, have parties. They even convince the hitman who killed Bernie that he's still alive! So, you guessed it, the hitman tries and tries again to ""kill"" Bernie. The physical humor is absolutely the best. It's a unique concept. I guarantee that you will laugh until you hurt.

2262171,4,B00094ARJQ,"Oh, WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S. I remember watching this at a prepubescent age over and over, at a time when the mere sight of someone getting hit by something was funny (so I guess there's the EPIC MOVIE and the like's audience... finally found it). Now, at a college age, I still can enjoy this movie for what it is: a moronic, implausible, yet strangely compellingly funny movie (double adverb, impressive).
 The plot, as many may know, involves Larry (Andrew McCarthy) and Richard (Jonathan Silverman), two young up-and-coming insurance guys at a prestigious firm run by Bernie Lomax (Terry Kiser), so rich his car is bigger than Larry's apartment. So Larry and Richard are overjoyed when they discover someone has been stealing from the company and bring this to Bernie's attention. He seems appreciative and invites the boys to his beach home for the weekend. They of course agree, and we cut to Bernie asking mobster Vito (Louis Giambalvo... had to look him up as well) to have the boys murdered. Yes, Bernie has been doing the stealing and needs the only 2 guys on his trail snuffed out. Vito decides Bernie is the one he needs out of the way and hires crony Paulie (the reliably funny Don Calfa) to dispose of ol' Bern. So Larry and Richard arrive to a beautiful beach house, beautiful women, a full stock of alcohol, and a party on the way. Oh yeah, and their dead boss, who has been all set up to appear like he has overdosed. Of course they want to call 911 (more Richard than Larry, as Larry's a bit more upset that Bernie couldn't have waited until Monday to kill himself), but then the party starts, and no one seems to notice that Bernie's dead (here's where the critics really start puffing on their 'oh, how ludicrous' pipes), so Larry suggests they just pretend (for a bit) that he's not dead and have a little fun. This plan goes from waiting 10 minutes to waiting until the next day, when they discover Bernie's plan and also that Paulie is on their tail to finish them and Bernie (who he believes is still alive as the boys are doing a pretty nice job of keeping him seemingly animated) off. Add in the girl of Richard's dreams Gwen (Catherine Mary Stewart) to act surprised at every plot turn as Larry and Richard dodge bullets and neighbors, and you have yourself a comedy.
 Yes, it's all handled quite ridiculously, but come on, writer Robert Klane and director Ted Kotcheff are not aiming for Shakespeare here. What the film sets out to do is make people laugh, and I cannot deny it that. Most of the laughs are due to the amazing performance by Kiser, who looks and appears dead the whole way through. Whether flying off the back of boats, over railings, and down ramps or walking with Larry and Richard around town happily, Kiser actually convinces us that he is out of the picture. McCarthy and Silverman are also very funny with their contrasting personalities, Richard the voice of reason and Larry the horndog that has more bad ideas than good ones. So don't expect a comedy classic here, but I would be hard-pressed to find someone who appreciates dumb comedy when it is done well that doesn't at least smile throughout the film.",1199577600,,3155,4.602131438721137
2262172,5,B00094ARJQ,This sequel is even funnier than the first movie. I've seen it many times and keeps me laughing.  This is a movie that you can watch over and over again.,1190505600,,153,4.1
2262173,4,B00094ARJQ,"Critics are soooo judgemental and overly serious that of course they threw this movie one star easily. Hell I could toss it one star easily too because I see everything that is bad about it. But I still can't help but to see it as great fun ayway. It stars Jonathan Silverman and Andrew McCarthy as 2 bafoons who wanna work for a rich businessman named Bernie Lomax (Terry Kiser). They know something about his business that they don't realize he wants to kill them for knowing.

  He invites them for a weekend at his beach home but he gets killed before they get there. They slowly realize that he's dead and people on the island are slower than them because they just don't see that he's dead. So they fake him being alive just so they can live it up and enjoy his place to themselves. They soon have to save themselves from the guy who killed Bernie. The result is a really really stupid movie with pretty awful acting but will you enjoy the movie anyway ? Hell yes! Terry Kiser actually is hilarious and gives a fun performance as...a dead body. It's silly that no one can even tell that Bernie is dead and try to carry conversations with him. Hell his g/f has sex with him and doesn't even know she had sex with a dead body.

  Of course those are good reasons critics gave it one star but to me those are good reasons to enjoy how stupid this movie is. I mean why just give a movie one star when it's at least well done enough to get some good laughs. If you wanna see garbage that's not only easy to just toss one star but Zero Stars, then see Weekend at Bernies 2! Plus when Men at Work did something similar with a dead body it wasn't as clever and well done as this movie or as funny.",1178064000,,1695,4.2

Watching the movie recently with my roommate, I couldn't help but thinking about the sort of Los Angeles society that could have a raucous cocktail party and never notice the dead body on the couch - that a giant group of people could cavort and network, occasionally even talk with/ get groped by the corpse and still find conversations about car prices important enough that even the dead can't steal their attention from themselves.  For a while, I saw Weekend At Bernie's as perhaps a little wiser than I'd given it credit for as a kid - maybe in modern LA, it IS possible that two corporate dweebs could siphon an identity from a dead sleazebag.  But there's no way to keep it from falling victim to Eighties Movie Syndrome - a romance that seems free of actual interaction briefly sidelined by criminals that seem free of any ability.  And, like so many movies of our youth, the jokes seem now to be dismal even when we can pick them out - a dead body being dragged by a boat now seems impossible to be mistaken for waterskiing, even if I used to think it was hilarious.  What I mean is have no hope - it's worse than you remember, and you probably didn't remember it well in the first place.",1157328000,3,1299,4.4411764705882355
