2698820,5,B000KX0IMC,Excellent movie! The film is much more polished than its predecessor and was a joy to watch. The character development was mindblowing. The subtitles are also extremely well done.,1355788800,3,179,5.206896551724138
2698821,5,B000KX0IMC,"I couldn't be happier with this sequel as it does a very good job telling the back stories of the stars of the movie.  The Departed tried to condense this, but you really can't.  Definitely a must buy.",1346025600,,201,4.2631578947368425
2698822,4,B000KX0IMC,"Both actors are great in their roles but the storyline is not great.  You have to watch the entire 3-part DVD if you started this.  The sequence in the 3-part serie should've been created with the 1st, 2nd and 3rd.  The release of the 3rd part first made any newer release disappointing.",1340150400,,287,4.480769230769231
2698823,5,B000KX0IMC,"I have read the two review posted so far, and I think that the writers have missed some of the greatness of this film.  To be fair, the reviewers rightly picked up on the homage to the Godfather films, but this picture is its own creation.  I have never seen a better cast do a better job with complex characters and interpersonal nuance.  I watched the film Sunday night, then, on vacation, after breakfast on Monday, and that night with the commentary.  The commentary is great in its own right because it focuses on the cast and the effort to interpret and present the complexities between characters.  Inevitably, we who do not know Chinese and need subtitles must miss a great deal, but this film is a masterpiece.",1271721600,3,719,4.5859375
2698824,4,B000KX0IMC,"a very pretentious imitation of hollywood's 'god father'. but this hongkong mafia don is a much too exaggerated and pretentious one, also badly acted. the plot is a bit too far-fetched, trying to be very complicated and at times, quite messy. putting a short and fat guy as a powerful key player was a very bad casting job too. not bad, but definitely not great. my only impression after finished watching this film is nothing but way too pretentious.",1176163200,,451,4.7215189873417724
2698825,4,B000KX0IMC,"Infernal Affairs II is one prequel you definitely shouldn't see before the original - so much of the interest comes from spotting throwaway details that assume more importance in the original film, and the character revelations are far more fascinating if you've seen the original. Take the opening monologue: standard enough - until you see who it is that Inspector Wong is opening up to: what we know about their eventual fates and the implications it has about their relationship is far more intriguing than if you choose this outing as your starting point.

With no Andy Lau or Tony Leung this time round, their younger selves played by the lacklustre Shawn Yue and Edison Chen are sidelined in favor of their superiors. It's a wise decision: Tsang and Francis Ng are superb, although curiously Anthony Wong isn't as good as in the original in a more expansive and more morally compromised role. The first half hour is awkward, but the deferred violence following the death of the local triad boss is well handled and the film fires into life with some genuinely great filmmaking once the consequences start catching up with the various characters.

The influence here is clearly the Godfather films, but whereas Godfather II was ultimately just a typical sequel exercise in underlining and escalation, this back story really does add layers to the original, with Eric Tsang becoming a genuinely tragic figure in his final scene. Where Godfather II tended to use history merely as a backdrop, here the handover of Hong Kong becomes an integral part of the film. The final montage of power being handed over from one nation to another, as police badges are replaced alongside criminals photos on the wall carries real weight and substance: it's what the film is all about - the loss of authority and the gaining of power, given the feeling of a requiem rather than a triumph by Chan Kwong Wing's eloquent score. Not as good as the original, true, but still very impressive indeed and miles ahead of Scorsese's bloated remake of the original.",1169078400,17,2044,4.870689655172414

8159494,5,B000KX0IMC,"Infernal Affairs II is a great movie about the youth of Inspector Lau and Yan when they were part of the Triad and the police organization respectively and how to have gotten to become moles. Added to that,it also tells the story as to how they became infiltrators and the adjustments they have made in order to become credible and how they worked hard to meet the expectations of their bosses. Added to that,it also gets into their personal demons and the discomfort as moles. While this maybe far from being a masterpiece unlike the first film,it still manages to be a fantastic prequel. As a stand alone film,I think that it definitely still qualifies as a good film in spite of the comparisons between the first film and this one cannot be avoided.",1410220800,2,752,4.619402985074627
8159495,4,B000KX0IMC,Quality and packaging was great but the movie was a little long for my taste. I like the fact that they realy went deep into the story but they extended the movie quite a bit. But thanks another addition to my collection.,1370563200,,221,4.285714285714286
