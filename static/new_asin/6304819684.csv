7878057,5,6304819684,"i first saw this film in 1996 and it helped me come out.  i saw it again this year and it's still as beautiful.
the reason why i say buy this film is because it is one of the few times you will see a gay couple portrayed honestly, with dignity and without any of the scene frippery that seems to have to accompany most gay films.
i won't tell you anything about the story line but will say that this is a rare portrait showing that men can love one another fiercely, tenderly and beautifully.  by concentrating on the issues the two men are facing rather than their relationship together we get a truthful portrayal of our love and any political points are reserved for the wonderful political art made by one of the characters.
i can't recommend this film strongly enough.  it gave me something tangible to realise that men can love men beautifully before i came out and continues to sustain me now.
truthfully, the warmest, most truthful gay film i have ever seen",1089849600,5,965,4.440677966101695
7878058,5,6304819684,"This magical and mystical little Minneapolis-based film is basically about two cute (but not 'Hollywood perfect'), quirky guys who fall in love at first sight (much to the pretend annoyance of their friend, the catty narrator who propels the story).

They struggle with all the problems of life: living together; the death of parents; coming out; homophobia from family, peers, and workplace; their future. Matt Guidry and Gregory G. Giles could not be more perfect in their portrayals of Mark (an HIV+ artist) and Joey (a garbage collector who sees art and beauty in what is 'junk' to others). Mark's cynicism softens in the light of Joey's loving, giving nature and they complement one another perfectly.

Their story is far from maudlin. It is gritty and real, and they both have demons. But Mark and Joey also have each other, and their sweet story is just about as lovely, intelligent (with homages to Gregg Araki's The Living End as well as Hamlet), and warm as any on screen. A bright, shining little gem.",1019260800,12,1012,4.84393063583815
7878059,3,6304819684,"I'm writing this after having seen the film only once, so please take that into consideration. For some reason I had a very different idea of what the story was going to be about. Maybe because every review mentions that one of the characters is HIV+.
The film was clearly made on a meager budget but it's a small story and isn't necessarily hurt by that. And the two leads are talented enough and attractive enough to be enjoyable to watch on their own.
The problem for me was that the director-writer seemed to have no very clear idea of what he wanted to communicate. I had the impression that some of the events of this story were probably taken from real life because he seemed to think they would be emotionally resonant on their own. Maybe they were for him but they meant nothing to me. He leaps from one event to the next without accumulating much to the narrative, so it adds up to not very much.
The main pleasure remains the two main characters and their love for each other. That they love each other is never really in doubt and never really in danger. But at least the director leaves it alone for the most part and so they hold you pleasantly engaged while he wanders all over the landscape.",1009756800,4,1207,4.392857142857143
7878060,5,6304819684,An amazing movie about a sculpture who builds a model gothic cathedral to get over the death of his father. Totally believable unique real gay men.,991872000,6,147,4.6923076923076925
7878061,4,6304819684,"Despite the mixed reviews, I gave this movie a chance and ordered it a while back. Now, having seen it recently for the second time, I must say I really like this film. Its experimental qualities (face-to-camera  narration, montage sequences, flashbacks, fade-to-black transitions) are  more an homage to decades-past independent filmmaking than they are  techniques to be taken totally seriously. What I like most about this film  are the characters of Mark and Joey, who become sweetly endearing and  lovable in their own off-beat sort of way. In the end, when Mark and Joey  are at odds with themselves, while unwittingly trying to find their way  back to each other (accompanied by a beautiful piano score, I might add),  my heart longs for a satisfying ending and is not disappointed.",963187200,9,789,5.015384615384615
7878062,1,6304819684,"I thought the movie could have been just a little better than what it was.  It was slow, long, and boring.  The movie tired to present a nice theme of a one on one couple falling in love and staying faithfull to one another,  but did a bad job of it.  The movie, like almost other gay films, was  centered around a HIV postive character.  I am personally tired of gay  movies with Hiv or AIDS sad being one of the main plot in films.  There are  more things in gay life other then HIV.",953078400,10,485,4.021052631578947
7878063,5,6304819684,"Deceptively low-key film about an oddball Midwestern gay couple, one of whom works a variety of temp jobs to supplement his ""art,"" the other of whom picks up trash on the highway.  Dishy friends, AIDS, and the  building of a cathedral are only a few of the plot elements this film  juggles with breathtaking dexterity, never wobbling in tone or focus up  till the surprising ending.  Technical credits are a little dicey at some  moments, but film has an overall freshness that can't be disguised or  replicated.  A probable candidate for cultdom, would make a great double  feature with Bill Sherwood's ""Parting Glances.""  One of my  favorite gay films of the 90's by a longshot.",916963200,26,680,4.826086956521739
