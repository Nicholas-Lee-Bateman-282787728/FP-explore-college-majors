8420466,1,B004ALIG1K,"So me and my two friends (Mike, and John) met up to study for a history test. We all got to his house and popped in the movie. I had no idea, but this night would change my life forever. The movie starts out pretty normal, but we found it kind of strange there were no words, but only music.. Eventually it progresses and gets very, very erie and strange.. Things just keep getting weirder and I cant do this.

One of my friends, Mike has completely vanished. I can't get ahold of John. Someone knocked on my door and when I went to look I saw a face completely covering the peephole and a giant smile started to form. I called the cops again and instead of it turning into static they got really strange. ""Sir, are you affected by any drugs at the moment?"" ""No."" ""Are you coming home anytime soon?"" ""Excuse me?"" ""Come home."" and the phone call ended. My mail slot swings every now and then. Someone is sliding pieces of baby dolls through it. I try to call people now and all I can hear is static and bad baby doll noises and this crying and screaming. My TV is busted but when I go to piss I can hear it on. I might be going insane. Whoever lives above me started to scream in pain and crying deeply recently.

I hear giant footsteps from their apartment, I hear bangs and something falling to the ground. From the neighbors to the right of my apartment I hear what sounds like a baby that never gets tended too and then it sounds like a baby doll whose batteries are dying. My phone has been ringing now and it's John telling me things in a language that I have never heard before, nor could even manage to repeat. I kept getting emails of pictures of black and small colorations, now I can't even access my email. Someone knocks on the door, then they slam against it. I hear the bolts unlocking one by one and I run to make sure to lock all of them back and sit down crying. What do I do? My electricity keeps dimming. My water, sinks, bath, shower, all smell like something dead. I keep seeing a shadow of someone behind me raising something up in the air, and I just take off to the other side of the apartment with my head against the wall. I have boarded my windows shut, someone was throwing rocks through them. I never could see someone was throwing rocks through them. I never could see who. I have boarded my bedroom in, I hear crying and screaming in there now. And right now while I'm typing this I can see the reflection off the computer screen of some shadow behind me.",1314835200,,2486,4.220588235294118
