8339606,5,B001SAOTU8,"This is a very good DVD. I have taken Chen Tai Chi for 6 years now and started taking the broadsword in Jan. 2016. I got the DVD to help me learn the moves that I sometimes forgot from class and to help in practice. I have a couple of Master Ren's other DVDs and they all show the whole form in its entirety in regular time, slow time, and slow motion. That way if you miss a step, you can go back and review it again. It helps a lot when you are following along. It is definitely worth the price of getting this lesson on the form. And I wholly recommend it.",1469232000,,559,3.912280701754386
