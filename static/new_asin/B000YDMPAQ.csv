3027058,2,B000YDMPAQ,"This movie is exactly what the title says: 2 days in Paris in the life of a couple of hysteric, insecure and basically unbearable individuals.
No plot, forced situations, a tad of overacting.
Some American viewership is granted by the role of Adam Goldberg, who plays the perplexed, French-challenged fiance.
Barely worth your time.",1202342400,7,332,5.166666666666667
3027059,4,B000YDMPAQ,"Julie Delpy and Adam Goldberg stop in Paris to visit Delpy's parents after a stressful trip to Venice. The story is simple-Delpy keeps running into ex-lovers and Goldberg imagines that his girlfriend is a slut and comes to the conclusion that he ""doesn't know her at all"".

As serious as this plot sounds, I was laughing for most of this film. There is enough humor in this script to keep the film light. Many of the funny scenes arise out of cultural differences refreshingly void of the typical French vs. American cliches. Much of the humor is ""French""-like the scene at the dinner table when the family yells at each other one minute and then starts laughing a few minutes later. Americans would describe this as ""bi-polar drama"", but the French view this sort of passion and recovery as normal. There are also subtle cultural references like the ""385 Bitches"" and Delpy's sexual attempts to be on top-a French man would be able to explain to you that French women are known for their independence. Unlike other reviewers here, I found Delpy and Goldberg a charming couple and enjoyed watching their antics. I never wondered why this couple was together-it seems like couples are usually fighting when travelling through Europe together. It was interesting to see what comes out of the arguments I've always heard on the streets! Many of the minor characters in this film are extremely charming-especially Delpy's parents. A fun film if you get it. If you're in a bad relationship right now, this film might be too close to home.",1201996800,21,1533,4.806818181818182
3027060,5,B000YDMPAQ,"Such an enjoyable, non-formulaic, funny movie. Julie Delpy and Adam Goldberg are fantastic, hilarious, and so charming. This reminded me of what I love about Woody Allen's best movies. I hope JD continues on her path as a director (acting as well), as this is a fantastic showcase of her talents.",1201996800,5,296,4.823529411764706
3027061,3,B000YDMPAQ,"(2.5) Sometimes more unpleasant than funny, '2 Days in Paris' brings out the differences between a New York couple who visit her native Paris.  As the trip reveals serial lovers in her past, his resentment grows, especially as he takes her scenes with others out of context.  Not entirely different than 'Conversations with Other Women' with two different points of view (although not presented with a split screen), this film reminded me of a substandard '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Annie-Hall/dp/6304907729/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Annie Hall</a>'. Adam Goldberg is no Woody Allen, but Julie Delpy does bring some depth and complexity to her character.  When circumstances bring about confusion, it's very funny.  When the characters start to whine, they neither inspire nor entertain.",1201651200,15,832,6.085470085470085
3027062,3,B000YDMPAQ,"Roughly speaking, this is a story of a French woman settled in the USA and visiting in eight years her Paris-based family with a Jewish-American boyfriend.

3027063,4,B000YDMPAQ,"Having just come home from spending a month in Paris, seeing this movie was a real treat.  It's not a movie about Paris, so much as it is a movie about two very different people grasping at love.  Viewers looking for Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triomphe panoramas will definitely be disappointed; think more along the lines of too-real Sunday markets, Canal St. Martin, and the outskirts you just won't find in your Guide Michelin.

The dynamics between the two protagonists are great; their stories are fascinating, and are slowly revealed, explained, and analyzed.  This isn't a movie about truths; it's about the way people love, learn, and struggle to understand themselves and each other.",1196640000,8,689,4.965217391304348
3027064,3,B000YDMPAQ,"I liked this film, although it hasn't the kind of aesthetic coherence that a 5-star would have. It is, instead, a fun little picture. The sexy side of the picture is refreshing because it, too, is eccentric and fun-loving, rather than heavy and 'real'. There is a very odd running gag between the girl and her parents who have enjoyed looking at and sharing naked pictures of the American boyfriend. He is very prudish about this and any number of other expressions of French sexual permissiveness,and, although his prudery seems a little old-fashioned, it does make for some laughs. It is after all a comedy and not meant as a social critique.  The French parents are a scream. The weirdo, animal rights terrorist who sets of a bomb in a McDonald's is very strange, but the set-up works and gets a laugh. Adam Goldberg basically plays a Jerry Seinfeld-type - the American Jew with a big heart. It is not exactly fish-out-of-water, but it attempts something along those lines. As such, I found it refreshing and amusing.",1195257600,9,1020,4.762711864406779
3027065,4,B000YDMPAQ,"Julie Delpy has a most acerbically idiosyncratic ear for dialogue, and she seems to have this facility in both English and French. The disarming actress actually co-wrote the perceptive script to Richard Linklater's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Before-Sunset/dp/B0002YLC24/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Before Sunset</a>&nbsp;(2005), the reflective nine-years later sequel to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Before-Sunrise/dp/B00002E224/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Before Sunrise</a>, with Linklater and co-star Ethan Hawke. This time, she takes charge of the script and direction, as well as the leading role of a French photographer named Marion, who stops at her part-time flat in Paris with her angst-driven American boyfriend Jack. On their way back to New York from a disastrous trip to Venice, the fractious couple stops over to visit her eccentric parents, but it turns into a more revelatory trip about her past than either is prepared to face.

While the similarities to the Linklater films are self-evident, the 2007 film reminds me most of Woody Allen's epochal&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Annie-Hall/dp/6304907729/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Annie Hall</a>&nbsp;but obviously over a much more concentrated period and with a far more bracing tone. The ramshackle, seemingly unstructured scenes pick up a detail of life that for better and worse, one rarely gets to see on screen. Taken as a series of off-kilter episodes, the movie is entertaining, especially a rabbit dinner scene that firmly establishes Jack as the family outsider. Viewed as a whole, however, it falls short in making a more resonant observation about the characters other than their mounting incompatibility. Part of the reason is that we can already tell from the first scene when the couple is waiting for a taxicab that they thrive on conflict, so what tethers them has a degree of questionability from the outset.

Another reason is a discernible imbalance between the leads. With the Linklater films as her obvious training ground, Delpy brings such an intelligent spark to Marion that every moment feels spontaneous. Her assured and particularly Gallic sense of self grounds the film when it threatens to get overwhelmed by its eccentricities. Casting the often nerve-grating Adam Goldberg as Jack is a bold move for Delpy and not an altogether successful one. With his intense stare and constantly put-upon manner, the actor comes across as more irritating than clever even though Delpy generously gives him the lion's share of the laughs. It is she who makes them believable as a couple. What he does do well is portray his faltering confidence and increasing paranoia in primal strokes.

Over those two defining days, Jack meets Marion's artsy, offbeat friends, three of whom are ex-lovers, and the unwanted attention of a number of other men. The funniest, most unexpected scene is in the Metro when they try avoiding a death-stare stranger who has no hesitation circling them like a buzzard. A genuine spark is provided by Delpy's real-life parents, Albert Delpy and Marie Pillet, who play Marion's bohemian, exasperating parents. With Delpy showing obvious talent behind and in front of the camera, the film is caustic fun and an effective, sometimes wistful rumination on what couples really know about each other. I just wish it came together a bit more than it does.",1194566400,8,3495,5.7957198443579765

2 Days in Paris is a funny and surprising film written, directed, edited, and starred by the talented Julie Delpy. It has a taste of Woody Allen and a taste of European films.

The film was nominated for a Csar award for Best Original Screenplay (Meilleur scnario original). The script is brilliant indeed.

Julies real parents play Marions parents. The father is hillarious.

The best: the lack of communication between different cultures, Albert Delpys character and his passion for destroying cars that are bad parked (it would be so great to be able to do that!), the American Republican losers, Jacks paranoia for Marions man-eater complex, the fairy, the music, and the scene where Marion shouts at the racist taxi driver and criticizes France.

3027205,5,B000YDMPAQ,"Gifted and rebellious avant-garde filmmaker auteur Julie Delpy takes the bull by the horns in 2 Days in Paris and seems to want to steer a change in cinema.

It seems as if her desire is to create another wave in French cinema following the first new wave movement by Francois Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, and finally be Alain Resnais.  In the end, she succeeds. Her camera angles and camera eye are quite refreshing. I rented this movie in High Definition (HD) so my point of view might be askew yet HD's effect did add to the story telling of this movie. Along with the typical story of a couple, Marion, a photographer, Delpy, and Jack, an interior designer, played by  Adam Goldberg, fighting after vacationing in Venice: a typical Hollywood formula script, Point A to Point B to Point C, yet the change from typical Hollywood cinema changes when they get to Paris. That's when the auteur takes over in telling her story.

Paris is where her parents live. This movie is steeped in French culture. At the dinner table, the father requests the rabbit's head. The camera zooms in on the braised rabbit head as the father anxiously waits to be served. Another French culture reference is when the couple are in a Parisian taxi. Marion takes the bull by the horns and starts to argue with the tough guy Parisian cab driver. Traffic is hell in Paris. Yet Marion's verbal combat with the cab driver also shows another side of her cinematic vision: women are strong enough to stand up for themselves. While the two are arguing, Jack sits quietly next to her and stays speechless. He knows his girlfriend's temperament, quite strong indeed. Strong enough to argue with a rough and ready Parisian taxi driver.

This movie is more about social commentary than a typical Hollywood type of movie. The lead character, Marion, is strong willed, yet her soft, gentle woman side is shown. Delpy, who directed 2 Days in Paris, as well as co-wrote and edited it, is a woman on a mission. I think that mission is to share her cultural upbringing with her boyfriend, Jack. They take a walk on a Parisian side street, where a former love of Marion says hello from his flower shop. On a personal level, she also is absorbed by the culture by wearing Parisian fashion dresses, dealing with Parisian artists, and showing Parisian monuments. Yet it's not all about Paris, it's mostly about France, and its culture. For those unaware, this movie is in French when she talks to her parents, but in English when she talks to Jack.

For those looking for a typical Hollywood movie, this one isn't it. This movie is more about the director, Delpy's personal vision about what a movie should be like, and her opinion about what is wrong with the way women are treated globally. The best approach to watch this movie is by considering it a new wave style film with a personal stamp by Delpy. She's one of the leading French movie directors, and, one of the leading woman film directors in the world. She has taken filmmaking to a new subjective plateau. 2 Days in Paris is stamped with her personality and character all over the movie. It's her vision about what movies should be like, the movie director as auteur.",1466035200,3,3184,4.646536412078153

3027249,2,B000YDMPAQ,"A bilingual cringe comedy about a pair of brittle New Yorkers whose two-year-old relationship is tested to the breaking point by a brief vacation.  Comparisons to ""Annie Hall"" seem inevitable--Delpy's co-star, Adam Goldberg, is like a more robust, tatooed-hipster version of Woody; Delpy's not exactly playing against type as a talky, excitable beauty who's had pretty bad luck with men (we get to meet a few of them).  I guess writer/director JD's to be commended for her honesty in portraying both her main characters through the disillusioned eyes of love gone sour, but past a certain point we didn't find it all that pleasant to watch.

Goldberg's character, Jack, is a snide, self-centered wuss who fusses about his migraines and sinuses and has to take cabs everywhere (prob'ly b/c JD has a lot to say about Paris cabdrivers).  And I'm sorry to say that Delpy tries to level the playing field by making her own character, Marion, almost as annoying.  It seems that Marion's freaked out by being back in a scene that she's outgown:  she's felled by a panic attack at an art party, then 86'd from a caf for picking a fight with one of her exes, then gets into it with a racist cabbie on the way back to her parents' apartment.  The couple's terminal meltdown seems to be too painful even for JD herself--she excerpts the climactic scene in pantomime with voiceover...

Delpy's obviously a talented filmmaker who's done some great work as an actress for Kielowski and Richard Linklater, but I didn't think the insights she has to offer here really justify spending 90+ minutes in the company of these foolish, unlikable people.  The vignettes of the small-frogs-in-a-small-pond (so to speak) Paris art scene are kind of funny; there's a nice mean-spirited riff on doofy Da Vinci Codebreakers, a cute scene where Jack bonds with an ecoterrorist in a fast-food place, but all in all, I'd approach this one with caution.",1419724800,,1921,4.868098159509202

3027260,3,B000YDMPAQ,"2 DAYS IN PARIS isn't going to be the kind of film to win any Oscars; its subject-matter is a familiar one (the American floundering in a foreign culture), and the conclusion equally predictable.  Nonetheless Julie Delpy's film does have its incidental pleasures, notably two winning central performances from Delpy herself as Marion and Adam Goldberg (as Jack).  Although different as chalk from cheese, they nonetheless try to sustain their love-affair in the face of almost insuperable obstacles - Marion's overbearing, non-English-speaking parents, a bohemian ex-boyfriend of Marion (Daniel Bruhl), plus a host of other impediments - imagined or otherwise - that befall Jack's stay in Paris.  The film takes some predictable potshots at Americans abroad; their monolingualism, their expectations that everyone should think like them, irrespective of cultural differences; and their obsession with private as opposed to public issues.  On the other hand the French are not immune from criticism either; Lukas (Bruhl) is portrayed as a libertine paying scant regard for such things as reliability or privacy.  The film's conclusion is predictable enough, with the lovers vowing to separate yet unable to do so, but it has been an enjoyable trip along the way.",1395532800,,1261,5.413265306122449

Julie Delpy, wrote, starred and directed this film. She is a superb actress, and this is truly a labor of love. Adam Goldberg is her lover and they have come to her home in Paris after a disastrous vacation in Venice. They live in the US, and this was to be the vacation to make them stronger. Unfortunately, Adam only took pictures in Venice and his neurotic personality laid him low with sinus, cold issues. They arrive in Paris, Jules's parents only speak French, so this becomes a culmination of funny misunderstandings. Papa is a flirt and so is Julie. Adam soon finds that every other person they meet, Julie has slept with. He wonders just exactly what she is. One misunderstanding leads to another, and they have a fight. Julie, is very  passionate about politics and if you don't agree , she goes off on you. One mess, again leads to another , until they finally meet to talk.

The was a laugh out loud film in many places, and this saved the lim from bogging down. Both Julie and Adam were terrific in their roles, as were the other actors. A film for everyone, a good one for a rainy day.

3027305,3,B000YDMPAQ,"OK, I didn't do my research before ordering this movie.  I thought it would be frothy, funny and romantic.  It's a little bit funny, not the least bit frothy, and not really romantic.

I did not realize until the credits rolled just how much of a Julie Delpy movie this is.  She wrote the script, starred, produced, wrote some of the music.  Her real life family played her family in the movie.

This often reminded me of a Woody Allen flick, specifically Annie Hall.  However, this is a much edgier movie.  Jack and Marion are both too caught up in their own issues to connect effectively with each other.  It's not really a love story.  Ultimately the focus becomes the clash of two cultures.  Marion is a Paris girl.  Jack is an American with a Jewish name who is not a practicing Jew and is often mistaken for an Arab or a terrorist.  They are on Marion's turf.  Jack usually flounders, and she doesn't do much to help him out.

Marion's voice-over narration is the strongest part of the movie for me.  She shows insight and self-awareness that is usually lacking in her scenes with Jack (in fact toward the end of the movie I am almost ready to side with Jack that she has serious anger management issues and is in dire need of professional help.)  I felt like the viewer is meant to pick a side, Jack's or Marion's.  But that would require a level of involvement that I just didn't feel.

I also thought the soundtrack was appealing.

I know that Julie Delpy has made other movies with the same basic premise.  I understand there is at least one more to come, Two Days in New York.  Actually it will be interesting to see Marion in America.  I may eventually check out Before Sunrise and Before Sunset, but I am certainly not ready to admit this is Julie Delpy's world and we're all just living in it.",1326758400,2,1807,4.409090909090909
3027306,5,B000YDMPAQ,Amusing and heart-felt. The chemistry between Delpy and Goldberg is outstanding; it truly does feel like they been with each other for years. This movie answers must needed-to-know questions: How many ex-boyfriends can you run into in your homeland? How do you order a Big Mac in a foreign country? Why would one pose for an embarrassing photo that you'll know will end up haunting you?,1300752000,,386,4.863636363636363
3027317,4,B000YDMPAQ,"The film opens with a night-train scene from Venice to Paris that should resonate with anyone whose done train travel in Europe. In the scene Marion (Julie Delpy) does a photo montage complemented by her voice narrating that flys through a lot of information quickly, contextualizing the viewer within a foreign environment (assuming the viewer is American). This technique is one of the film's strengths and she uses it throughout to catch people up to speed on Paris life.

The 2 main characters in love exemplify the difficulties and blisses of a cross-cultural relationship as they realize their affections for one another do not prevent cultural clashes. What's kosher for one is not for the other, but because they are open (eventually) they stay together.

The movie is very funny in its American v. French ideas.
Ms. Delpy played all of that up to its funniest.

This is very much a Julie Delpy project. She wrote, produced, directed, starred, edited and musically arranged the movie, and the results are in: it is an excellent and original film not only about 'couple-hood' but the process of understanding, misunderstanding and simply 'getting-along' with the rest of humanity.

Adam Goldberg performs admirably as Jack, a New Yorker with an interesting bouquet of nueroses and a snappy comeback. Julie's father Albert played the delightful part of her (walk-on part please... ;) whacky bohemian dad.

3027344,5,B000YDMPAQ,"2 Days in Paris is a refreshing, layered, truthful depiction of relationships. The film makes shrewd observations on how a relationship influences the human heart, soul and mind. The coupling without losing the individual. Sometimes you get blinded, often you are insecure and eventually, you might get it right. This chatty, extremely funny and insightful romantic comedy finds talented actress Julie Delpy directing her own script. She co-stars with ex-boyfriend Adam Goldberg, her own parents and even her cat makes a cameo appearance.

This sharp film reveals the minutiae and varied aspects of a relationship. Marion [Delpy] is a 35-year-old French woman who lives in New York. She's a photographer and has been with her serious, brooding, introspective boyfriend, Jack [Goldberg], an interior designer, for two years. After a trip to Venice, the couple stops in Paris to see her parents. During those 48-hours, Marion runs into several ex-boyfriends, throwing him into an insecure spiral and he starts to question her commitment. It's a turning point for them as the relationship will either wither or bloom in the City of Love.

Delpy attacks Parisian stereotypes in a way only someone French can really do. She shows the real, gritty parts of Paris; the political undertones, the racism, the immigrants and the less-romantic side-- the dark underbelly.  2 Days in Paris simultaneously evokes Delpy's love of the city and her distain for its politics and hypocrisy.

2 Days in Paris is thoughtful, genuine and amusing in its reflections on love and self-identity for a career-oriented woman in her 30s. She's independent, has had many loves and relationships in her past. In this refreshing film, the focus is a career-oriented woman who does not want children, has slept with more than a dozen men and is neither regretful nor apologetic and loves her cat and boyfriend equally.",1231286400,2,1886,5.173770491803278

3027365,4,B000YDMPAQ,"For anyone who has ever experienced cross cultural (cross Atlantic) love affair, this movie is the bull's eye in describing obstacles in the relationship of two people who come from two very different countries and backgrounds.  I personally wanted to see a film that was Julie Delpy's own little personal project since she has already shown her incredible talent as an actress and now is ready to reveal herself to the world as a writer, director and musician.  She is obviously multi talented and smart and she is still beautiful even without any makeup on her face during certain shots in this movie.  The relationship is between two neurotic people: French woman (Delpy), a photographer, and an American man (Goldberg) an interior designer.  Their professions have a hint of artistic tendencies without any pretensions.  Both are in their mid-thirties and well aware that by now each had their own share of heartache and disappointments from past relationships.  Can these two lovers from two different backgrounds, one too repressed and another unable to control her impulses capable to salvage their relationship and build from there?  This is really what the film is all about.  This is not about pure love, first love, biggest love or the last love - it is about two middle aged, somewhat damaged people trying to be adults, rationalize each other's shortcomings and still be acceptable and forgiving of them.  It is about making compromises rather than facing loneliness and superficial idea that things could be better with someone else.  Film has many funny moments that anyone can relate to: racist cab drivers; overzealous mother who likes to do the laundry and have it neatly folded in the lover's bedroom; free spirited father who just has to get his way with the people parking their car(s) in the way of pedestrians walkway; sexual repression vs. free spirit ready to contain itself to a committed relationship.  I like the movie because it is honest and true.  It is definitely Ms. Delpy's labor of love.  If there is one weak point in the movie that it is its ending.

Delpy connat bien les tats-Unis o elle habite, certes avec des interruptions, mais depuis ses tudes (ce qui doit faire une petite vingtaine d''annes). Elle est donc trs bien place pour faire un film sur un Gringo dcouvrant les Franais. C''est bien men, bien vu et drle pendant la premire moiti du film.

Mme si on ne sait rien de sa vie prive et de ce qu''elle a vraiment mis de ses expriences dans le film, elle se montre trop pour qu''on ne sache pas sparer Delpy de son personnage Marion. Le seul intrt du film est ce qu''une expatrie voit de la France et la ralisatrice aurait d se limiter  cet aspect, surtout que son acteur, Adam Goldberg, est crdible (sans plus cependant ; habitu des sries tlvises qui ont fait connatre son visage, il essaye de s''en sortir en jouant un personnage de sous-Woody Allen auquel on a la charit de croire). Le petit monde parisien est bien croqu, malgr les clichs bobos sur les chauffeurs de taxi ; ils sont la cible d''un tonnant  racisme de classe , trs courant  Paris il faut le dire. Ce qui est moins bien vu est tout ce qui a trait au couple et comme l''histoire  ce propos prend beaucoup de place  la fin et qu''elle n''est pas assez structure, la dynamique du film en ptit. Deux moments dsagrables sont un chauffeur de taxi qui n''aimant personne ne peut tre qu''antismite et un bourgeois expatri qui, tant cadre, ne peut tre qu''amateur d''adolescentes thalandaises (bons et mauvais expatris ? on a devin qui faisait partie du premier groupe). Autre chose d'tonnant : une constante vulgarit et beaucoup de gros mots hors de propos (les parents sont tonnamment et inutilement orduriers).

Fans of the angelic Ms. Delpy, or of Paris, will have to check this out, naturellement, but it is best to keep your expectations rather low.  Delpy demonstrates a sure hand with framing shots, and really, it's not possible to make Paris look unappealing, but Delpy and Adam Goldberg as the respective halves of an estranged couple sure give it the old college try, with more or less constant bickering marring the pretty views.  Enroute home to New York after a disasterous trip to Venice, Marion (Delpy) and her crabby, misthanthropic boyfriend (Goldberg) stop off for a weekend in Paris to visit her parents.  These two have been together for two years, which is long enough for once charming and endearing clashes in personal style to become grating and hateful, and that is the point at which these two have arrived.  Within the familiar environment of her childhood home, Marion is transformed in the eyes of her culture-shocked beau into something of a potty-mouthed slut with an indiscriminate and prolific past; he is not sure how to cope with this unflattering metamorphosis or the revelation that Marion has seemingly slept with half the men in Paris prior to moving in with him.  There are some nuggets of comedy gold here that Adam Goldberg might have been able to mine were he more like Bill Murray and less like himself, which is to say, dour and hairy.  As much as the audience wants to sympathize with his linguistic and romantic plight, Goldberg makes his character deeply unappealing, and we think yeah, it might be better if he were out of the picture altogether.  Three stars for some charming street scenes of Paris, and for the delightfully bawdy performances of the actors playing Marion's maman and papa--they are Delpy's real-life parents and are the best thing in it.",1222128000,5,1864,4.839622641509434

3027373,2,B000YDMPAQ,"2 days in Paris (2007) was produced/written/directed/edited/scored/starred by Julie Delpi who also recruited her real parents to play the parents of Marion, her alter ago.

Julie Delpy who was absolutely charming as Celene, the heroine of two Richard Linklater's movies (Before the Sunrise and Before Sunset), tried to make the similar film or rather follow-up about the couple that have been together for few years, experience some problem in their relationship, and try to work them out. Judging by the fact that Delpy has thrown so much of herself in all aspects of creating the film, she deserves my deepest respect. The problem is, as much as her movie walks the same territory as Before the Sunrise and Before Sunset (it takes place in Paris as the title suggests), it is not as good as they were. The chemistry between two main characters, the French Marion (Delpy) and New Yorker, Jack (Adam Goldberg) is completely non-existent, the plot is very thin but it is not even the biggest problem. The film has no subtlety, elegance, wit, or charm, and if it does, they are very well hidden. Yes, few times Woody Allen's name came to my mind because Adam Goldberg seemed doing homage to Woody Allen's character, neurotic, unsecured, and whining - and not particularly good one. He was mean, often without the reason. The scene in the beginning of the movie when Jack gives the group of the Americans tourists the apparently wrong directions to Louver just because he is sure that they are conservative Bush supporters does not make him a white knight, and it is just not funny. I also did not find charming Marion sending to her family via e-mail the picture of naked Jack with the colorful balloons. I have nothing against pictures a la nude, and from what I was able to notice, Jack had nothing to be ashamed of but how about privacy and trust in the relationship? Whatever happens between two people in their intimacy should stay between them because it belongs to them only. How about simply asking a boyfriend if he would not mind his funny picture be sent to his girlfriend's family? Does sensitive, intelligent, feisty Marion ever think of it? I was so much in love and could not get enough of one afternoon in Paris few years back with Celene and Jesse. 77 minutes long Before Sunrise was so clever, so romantic, and so moving that it made me want to see another movie with French girl and her American love, to find out what could've happened to them. Well, little did I know that it would be ""2 Days in Paris"". It is sad for me to admit, but Delpy's follow up to two of the most romantic modern screen observations of the relationships was a disappointment. I should mention that Delpy's movie has some positive sides to it. I liked how she showed HER Paris, very real, tough, and not sentimental. I liked for the most parts her parents Albert Delpy and Marie Pillet in their roles. There is one scene that I enjoyed and every time I think of it, it makes me smile. On their way to visit Jim Morrison's grave at Per Lashes, Marion asks Jake, Why do you want to see Jim Morrison's grave? You don't even like The Doors. And he answers, ""It is a famous grave...I am a huge fan of Val Kilmer"". Sadly, all the bright points were not enough to save the movie - I never thought that two days in one of my favorite places in the world may be so unbearably long and disappointing.",1215043200,2,3383,4.555008210180624
3027374,1,B000YDMPAQ,"Maybe it was intentionally played out as such, but this film left me disappointed and bored. Not the least of the reasons for the ennui is that Delpy already made this film, much more effectively, with Ethan Hawke under Richard Linklater's direction. Supposedly this film, as with Sunset, is somewhat based on her romance with the male protagonist. Maybe it helps the drama to know that Hawke left Uma Thurman for Delpy and that the pivotal rant on the riverboat rang with an authenticity that one can not make up. Maybe this boyfriend, Greenberg, is as neurotica and hypochnodriac as he is played. The result is that Sunset is emtionally engaging while 2 Days seems like it's never going to end.
Both Delpy and Greenberg essay stereotypes. He is the shlub hybrid of Woody Allen crossed with Jerry Seinfeld, without any of the redeeming characteristics of either. He's not that funny, and all I could feel after every moment of him on film was oy. If this is based on real life, whatever did Delpy see in this guy? Delpy for her part goes from the fast talking, liberated lover who still carried a torch lit by a sense of guilt and revenge in Sunset to just a fast talking and shallow promiscuous bonbon in 2 Days, a French blonde pretending to be Woody Allen. Not my cup of doppio I am afraid. Both characters are relentlessly grating. Nails down a chalk board the entire time they are on film. The scene of her getting him to put on a condom is possibly the least funny sexual comedy ever recorded. He gives up. I did too, and the film had hardly gone 30 minutes. It got worse as it went on.
And while the city of Paris was a notable supporting player in the Sunset film, the city this time looks like if it could get out of this movie it would. More's the pity this wasn't filmed someplace more grim, as there's nothing to laugh at here.
Delpy wears glasses and has an ugly astigmatism and is somewhat autistic according to the storyline. None of that means much or explains much, but there you have it. Supposedly she took up photography and then Greenberg usurped that role on whatever trip this is supposed to be. Perhaps that is a political statement on US/Franco relations. Perhaps I'm hoping she might actually have been reaching to say something. In any case, it is a far cry from the story that unfolds in Sunset as two lovers reunite at first just to find out what happened to each other and then come through the anger and recrimination of missed opportunities and settled decisions that have imprisoned each while the other always hoped for another chance. This is just two self-absorbed, mean spirited whiners, ugly american nails ugly french tart. I am reminded of the Eric Idle bit in the tourist sketch about the guy who whines and whines in a stream of consciousness about Whatley's red ale and they don't make the scones like they do in Dorset and.....
Hopefully Delpy is capable of better. Maybe give up on the old boyfriend routine. She isn't Joni Mitchell in film, so leave the forlorn romances to someone else. That or just do such films with Hawke. There was a real chemistry present that is conspicuous by its absence here. The only saving graces of this film are her parents, who are deliciously off the rive gauche throughout the movie, and the actress who plays her sister. Mom's a little nuts, and Dad has obviously OD'd on Cialis. The sister is as much of a hoot as Christopher Walkin was as Diane Keaton's brother in Annie Hall. That's small compensation for enduring Delpy and Greenberg.",1214179200,7,3520,4.580031695721078

Jack is neurotic and insecure; Marion is flighty and insensitive.  Both are whiny and judgmental.  An amusing film could be made about this couple, but writer/director Julie Delpy doesn't seem to realize how irritating they are and wants us to love and identify with them instead.

There are a couple of strong points here.  Delpy's real life parents (Albert Delpy and Marie Pillet) are wonderful as her fictional parents.  Also, the depictions of Paris's cab drivers, restaurants, and street life make it feel like a real city, not merely a picturesque backdrop for romance and intrigue.  But that's not enough to save this self-indulgent bore of a film.",1208649600,4,800,5.061068702290076
3027388,4,B000YDMPAQ,"For anyone who has spent time in Paris, so many little details, experiences, subtleties and attitudes found in this movie will be all-too-familiar.  Ms. Delpy has managed to accurately discern and distill much of the Parisian experience from the outsider's perspective.  For those who haven't experienced it for themselves, much of the rich detail and enjoyment of this movie will be lost on the viewer, and dare I say, without hopefully sounding too snobbish, an understanding of the spoken French is a plus as well for catching the extra humorous bits that don't quite make it to the subtitles.

Loved the cab drivers, fast-food clerk, parties, bizarre people, attitudes, etc...  I've met them all and often!

Ms. Delpy's family were a hoot.

People often ask me why I love going to Paris so much, and my answer to them is usually that I never fail to see entertaining high drama while there.  Et voil&agrave;.

So, if you love hanging out in Paris, you will love this movie, hence my 4 stars.",1207353600,4,995,4.777777777777778
3027389,2,B000YDMPAQ,Found the movie not as funny as I thought it would be. Also too exaggerated to the point of uneasiness where I didn't even recognized the French even though I'm a native from France.,1206576000,3,182,4.382352941176471
3027390,1,B000YDMPAQ,"Though Delpy has been reasonably competent in earlier films, in this one - almost totally her product - she is not only boring but irritating.

3027391,4,B000YDMPAQ,"Julie Delpy's character rings modern and true, like Sex and the City set in bohemian Paris. It's refreshing to see a female lead fumble through a relationship as carelessly and self-centeredly as men do, and always have. This is the modern woman with choices, and they overwhelm her even as she comes to realize that she no longer wants to go through the endless cycle of breaking up, rebounding, and finding connection again, and again. Goldberg's character has our sympathy, and we feel for him as he watches Delpy flirt her way to commitment. This is an engaging and quirky role reversal. And Delpy's deft script allows us to ponder political questions from terrorism to women's rights to the environment: her father keys cars parked carelessly because he ""doesn't like them."" It isn't always pleasant--the couple argues through much of the film, and it often veers into the mundane--but that makes it more lke life. And Delpy makes us laugh along the way.",1206230400,3,959,4.889570552147239
3027392,5,B000YDMPAQ,"I am an American who lived in Europe for years and I can't tell you how true this movie is. So many of the scenes in this movie actually happened to me. The entire scene with the woman's parents is so funny and true. I laughed so many times during this movie. It is also nice to see a movie that is not freighted down with all the B.S. we weigh down movies with in the U.S. (all the illusions about relationships ""lasting forever"" and all that kind of stuff that movies in the U.S. get weighed down with), etc. The Delphy character is really typical of a specific type of European woman who admits she only is going to stay with a guy for 2 years, but that it will be fun. Very, very good movie.

BTW, Paris is EXACTLY like that. That scene in the McDonalds actually happened to me.",1203984000,4,782,4.144736842105263
3027393,5,B000YDMPAQ,"There is not a dull moment in this film. Delpy has a blast playing with cliches and truisms about the French - and Americans. She pokes at the racism,  promiscuity, xenophobia, intellectual pretensions and vulgarity that come to light as soon as one scratches the surface of the French psyche.

On the other hand, she also shows the hearty, food-loving, stylish and alive core of the French where the family sticks together for better and worse and where life is appreciated for its own sake.

An argument for the French is not a time to reach for the gun, or call the psychiatrist - it is an opportunity to display how you feel, and get the emotional charge out of your system. A healthy way of being in the world, which sometimes scares the crap out of the typical American ...yet what do you prefer: the true person or fake politeness?

The film plays with national and class stereotypes in a tight, fast-paced, brilliantly scripted story which nevertheless finds plenty of space to touch genuine and deep human emotions and predicaments. Delpy explores the nature of connection tethered to the inexorable fact the we know all too well: that ""love"" and commitment involves daily negotiation, adaptation and acceptance of teh partner for who they are. A relationship where personal quirks and idiosyncrasies are not only indulged but in some weird way celebrated. Where one never knows when or why the break-up occurs, sometimes hanging in on the precipice of chance.

In other words, Delpy's Paris, and her French and Americans are real people and the story is a story about reality, even though, paradoxically, the film itself is made to poke fun at cliches. I laughed most the time, and at other times I was sad. What more can one want from a film?",1203811200,8,1753,4.753289473684211
3027394,3,B000YDMPAQ,"I've opined in the past that Julie Delpy has been underutilized by Hollywood and Paris - my feeling being that she's deemed too American for French tastes, too French for American tastes.  So, like in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Before-Sunset/dp/B0002YLC24/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Before Sunset</a>&nbsp;(which she co-wrote), Ms. Delpy has taken things into her own hands here by writing, directing, editing and composing this film.  Impressive!  For good measure, she did the majority of the casting as well, corralling her parents (who are actors) and Adam Goldberg into the production.

Like 'Before Sunset,' the film is a torrent of words.  It looks improvised, but it's not.  For example, as Delpy points out in the 'Making Of' featurette, the dinner scene where Goldberg meets Delpy's parents in a cross-cultural gaffe-fest was, in fact, highly scripted.

The head-scratcher is why these two characters (Delpy's and Goldberg's) are a couple.  As the film goes on, Goldberg's character goes from quirky to annoying to downright unlikeable.  I know she's playing a role, but as a Julie Delpy fan I found myself wanting to urge her that she deserved better.

That criticism aside, there are some very well-observed, flat-out funny passages in the film.",1203120000,3,1305,5.715025906735751

3261556,4,B000YDMPAQ,"Julie Delpy and Adam Goldberg stop in Paris to visit Delpy's parents after a stressful trip to Venice. The story is simple-Delpy keeps running into ex-lovers and Goldberg imagines that his girlfriend is a slut and comes to the conclusion that he ""doesn't know her at all"".

As serious as this plot sounds, I was laughing for most of this film. There is enough humor in this script to keep the film light. Many of the funny scenes arise out of cultural differences refreshingly void of the typical French vs. American cliches. Much of the humor is ""French""-like the scene at the dinner table when the family yells at each other one minute and then starts laughing a few minutes later. Americans would describe this as ""bi-polar drama"", but the French view this sort of passion and recovery as normal. There are also subtle cultural references like the ""385 Bitches"" and Delpy's sexual attempts to be on top-a French man would be able to explain to you that French women are known for their independence. Unlike other reviewers here, I found Delpy and Goldberg a charming couple and enjoyed watching their antics. I never wondered why this couple was together-it seems like couples are usually fighting when travelling through Europe together. It was interesting to see what comes out of the arguments I've always heard on the streets! Many of the minor characters in this film are extremely charming-especially Delpy's parents. A fun film if you get it. If you're in a bad relationship right now, this film might be too close to home.",1201996800,21,1533,4.806818181818182

3261560,4,B000YDMPAQ,"Having just come home from spending a month in Paris, seeing this movie was a real treat.  It's not a movie about Paris, so much as it is a movie about two very different people grasping at love.  Viewers looking for Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triomphe panoramas will definitely be disappointed; think more along the lines of too-real Sunday markets, Canal St. Martin, and the outskirts you just won't find in your Guide Michelin.

The dynamics between the two protagonists are great; their stories are fascinating, and are slowly revealed, explained, and analyzed.  This isn't a movie about truths; it's about the way people love, learn, and struggle to understand themselves and each other.",1196640000,8,689,4.965217391304348
3261561,3,B000YDMPAQ,"I liked this film, although it hasn't the kind of aesthetic coherence that a 5-star would have. It is, instead, a fun little picture. The sexy side of the picture is refreshing because it, too, is eccentric and fun-loving, rather than heavy and 'real'. There is a very odd running gag between the girl and her parents who have enjoyed looking at and sharing naked pictures of the American boyfriend. He is very prudish about this and any number of other expressions of French sexual permissiveness,and, although his prudery seems a little old-fashioned, it does make for some laughs. It is after all a comedy and not meant as a social critique.  The French parents are a scream. The weirdo, animal rights terrorist who sets of a bomb in a McDonald's is very strange, but the set-up works and gets a laugh. Adam Goldberg basically plays a Jerry Seinfeld-type - the American Jew with a big heart. It is not exactly fish-out-of-water, but it attempts something along those lines. As such, I found it refreshing and amusing.",1195257600,9,1020,4.762711864406779
3261562,4,B000YDMPAQ,"Julie Delpy has a most acerbically idiosyncratic ear for dialogue, and she seems to have this facility in both English and French. The disarming actress actually co-wrote the perceptive script to Richard Linklater's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Before-Sunset/dp/B0002YLC24/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Before Sunset</a>&nbsp;(2005), the reflective nine-years later sequel to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Before-Sunrise/dp/B00002E224/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Before Sunrise</a>, with Linklater and co-star Ethan Hawke. This time, she takes charge of the script and direction, as well as the leading role of a French photographer named Marion, who stops at her part-time flat in Paris with her angst-driven American boyfriend Jack. On their way back to New York from a disastrous trip to Venice, the fractious couple stops over to visit her eccentric parents, but it turns into a more revelatory trip about her past than either is prepared to face.

While the similarities to the Linklater films are self-evident, the 2007 film reminds me most of Woody Allen's epochal&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Annie-Hall/dp/6304907729/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Annie Hall</a>&nbsp;but obviously over a much more concentrated period and with a far more bracing tone. The ramshackle, seemingly unstructured scenes pick up a detail of life that for better and worse, one rarely gets to see on screen. Taken as a series of off-kilter episodes, the movie is entertaining, especially a rabbit dinner scene that firmly establishes Jack as the family outsider. Viewed as a whole, however, it falls short in making a more resonant observation about the characters other than their mounting incompatibility. Part of the reason is that we can already tell from the first scene when the couple is waiting for a taxicab that they thrive on conflict, so what tethers them has a degree of questionability from the outset.

Another reason is a discernible imbalance between the leads. With the Linklater films as her obvious training ground, Delpy brings such an intelligent spark to Marion that every moment feels spontaneous. Her assured and particularly Gallic sense of self grounds the film when it threatens to get overwhelmed by its eccentricities. Casting the often nerve-grating Adam Goldberg as Jack is a bold move for Delpy and not an altogether successful one. With his intense stare and constantly put-upon manner, the actor comes across as more irritating than clever even though Delpy generously gives him the lion's share of the laughs. It is she who makes them believable as a couple. What he does do well is portray his faltering confidence and increasing paranoia in primal strokes.

Over those two defining days, Jack meets Marion's artsy, offbeat friends, three of whom are ex-lovers, and the unwanted attention of a number of other men. The funniest, most unexpected scene is in the Metro when they try avoiding a death-stare stranger who has no hesitation circling them like a buzzard. A genuine spark is provided by Delpy's real-life parents, Albert Delpy and Marie Pillet, who play Marion's bohemian, exasperating parents. With Delpy showing obvious talent behind and in front of the camera, the film is caustic fun and an effective, sometimes wistful rumination on what couples really know about each other. I just wish it came together a bit more than it does.",1194566400,8,3495,5.7957198443579765

3261696,5,B000YDMPAQ,"Its so ugly when you speak French! (Marion / Julie Delpy)

2 Days in Paris is a funny and surprising film written, directed, edited, and starred by the talented Julie Delpy. It has a taste of Woody Allen and a taste of European films.

The film was nominated for a Csar award for Best Original Screenplay (Meilleur scnario original). The script is brilliant indeed.

Julies real parents play Marions parents. The father is hillarious.

The best: the lack of communication between different cultures, Albert Delpys character and his passion for destroying cars that are bad parked (it would be so great to be able to do that!), the American Republican losers, Jacks paranoia for Marions man-eater complex, the fairy, the music, and the scene where Marion shouts at the racist taxi driver and criticizes France.

3261702,5,B000YDMPAQ,"Gifted and rebellious avant-garde filmmaker auteur Julie Delpy takes the bull by the horns in 2 Days in Paris and seems to want to steer a change in cinema.

It seems as if her desire is to create another wave in French cinema following the first new wave movement by Francois Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, and finally be Alain Resnais.  In the end, she succeeds. Her camera angles and camera eye are quite refreshing. I rented this movie in High Definition (HD) so my point of view might be askew yet HD's effect did add to the story telling of this movie. Along with the typical story of a couple, Marion, a photographer, Delpy, and Jack, an interior designer, played by  Adam Goldberg, fighting after vacationing in Venice: a typical Hollywood formula script, Point A to Point B to Point C, yet the change from typical Hollywood cinema changes when they get to Paris. That's when the auteur takes over in telling her story.

Paris is where her parents live. This movie is steeped in French culture. At the dinner table, the father requests the rabbit's head. The camera zooms in on the braised rabbit head as the father anxiously waits to be served. Another French culture reference is when the couple are in a Parisian taxi. Marion takes the bull by the horns and starts to argue with the tough guy Parisian cab driver. Traffic is hell in Paris. Yet Marion's verbal combat with the cab driver also shows another side of her cinematic vision: women are strong enough to stand up for themselves. While the two are arguing, Jack sits quietly next to her and stays speechless. He knows his girlfriend's temperament, quite strong indeed. Strong enough to argue with a rough and ready Parisian taxi driver.

This movie is more about social commentary than a typical Hollywood type of movie. The lead character, Marion, is strong willed, yet her soft, gentle woman side is shown. Delpy, who directed 2 Days in Paris, as well as co-wrote and edited it, is a woman on a mission. I think that mission is to share her cultural upbringing with her boyfriend, Jack. They take a walk on a Parisian side street, where a former love of Marion says hello from his flower shop. On a personal level, she also is absorbed by the culture by wearing Parisian fashion dresses, dealing with Parisian artists, and showing Parisian monuments. Yet it's not all about Paris, it's mostly about France, and its culture. For those unaware, this movie is in French when she talks to her parents, but in English when she talks to Jack.

For those looking for a typical Hollywood movie, this one isn't it. This movie is more about the director, Delpy's personal vision about what a movie should be like, and her opinion about what is wrong with the way women are treated globally. The best approach to watch this movie is by considering it a new wave style film with a personal stamp by Delpy. She's one of the leading French movie directors, and, one of the leading woman film directors in the world. She has taken filmmaking to a new subjective plateau. 2 Days in Paris is stamped with her personality and character all over the movie. It's her vision about what movies should be like, the movie director as auteur.",1466035200,3,3184,4.646536412078153

3261746,2,B000YDMPAQ,"A bilingual cringe comedy about a pair of brittle New Yorkers whose two-year-old relationship is tested to the breaking point by a brief vacation.  Comparisons to ""Annie Hall"" seem inevitable--Delpy's co-star, Adam Goldberg, is like a more robust, tatooed-hipster version of Woody; Delpy's not exactly playing against type as a talky, excitable beauty who's had pretty bad luck with men (we get to meet a few of them).  I guess writer/director JD's to be commended for her honesty in portraying both her main characters through the disillusioned eyes of love gone sour, but past a certain point we didn't find it all that pleasant to watch.

Goldberg's character, Jack, is a snide, self-centered wuss who fusses about his migraines and sinuses and has to take cabs everywhere (prob'ly b/c JD has a lot to say about Paris cabdrivers).  And I'm sorry to say that Delpy tries to level the playing field by making her own character, Marion, almost as annoying.  It seems that Marion's freaked out by being back in a scene that she's outgown:  she's felled by a panic attack at an art party, then 86'd from a caf for picking a fight with one of her exes, then gets into it with a racist cabbie on the way back to her parents' apartment.  The couple's terminal meltdown seems to be too painful even for JD herself--she excerpts the climactic scene in pantomime with voiceover...

Delpy's obviously a talented filmmaker who's done some great work as an actress for Kielowski and Richard Linklater, but I didn't think the insights she has to offer here really justify spending 90+ minutes in the company of these foolish, unlikable people.  The vignettes of the small-frogs-in-a-small-pond (so to speak) Paris art scene are kind of funny; there's a nice mean-spirited riff on doofy Da Vinci Codebreakers, a cute scene where Jack bonds with an ecoterrorist in a fast-food place, but all in all, I'd approach this one with caution.",1419724800,,1921,4.868098159509202

3261757,3,B000YDMPAQ,"2 DAYS IN PARIS isn't going to be the kind of film to win any Oscars; its subject-matter is a familiar one (the American floundering in a foreign culture), and the conclusion equally predictable.  Nonetheless Julie Delpy's film does have its incidental pleasures, notably two winning central performances from Delpy herself as Marion and Adam Goldberg (as Jack).  Although different as chalk from cheese, they nonetheless try to sustain their love-affair in the face of almost insuperable obstacles - Marion's overbearing, non-English-speaking parents, a bohemian ex-boyfriend of Marion (Daniel Bruhl), plus a host of other impediments - imagined or otherwise - that befall Jack's stay in Paris.  The film takes some predictable potshots at Americans abroad; their monolingualism, their expectations that everyone should think like them, irrespective of cultural differences; and their obsession with private as opposed to public issues.  On the other hand the French are not immune from criticism either; Lukas (Bruhl) is portrayed as a libertine paying scant regard for such things as reliability or privacy.  The film's conclusion is predictable enough, with the lovers vowing to separate yet unable to do so, but it has been an enjoyable trip along the way.",1395532800,,1261,5.413265306122449

Julie Delpy, wrote, starred and directed this film. She is a superb actress, and this is truly a labor of love. Adam Goldberg is her lover and they have come to her home in Paris after a disastrous vacation in Venice. They live in the US, and this was to be the vacation to make them stronger. Unfortunately, Adam only took pictures in Venice and his neurotic personality laid him low with sinus, cold issues. They arrive in Paris, Jules's parents only speak French, so this becomes a culmination of funny misunderstandings. Papa is a flirt and so is Julie. Adam soon finds that every other person they meet, Julie has slept with. He wonders just exactly what she is. One misunderstanding leads to another, and they have a fight. Julie, is very  passionate about politics and if you don't agree , she goes off on you. One mess, again leads to another , until they finally meet to talk.

The was a laugh out loud film in many places, and this saved the lim from bogging down. Both Julie and Adam were terrific in their roles, as were the other actors. A film for everyone, a good one for a rainy day.

3261802,3,B000YDMPAQ,"OK, I didn't do my research before ordering this movie.  I thought it would be frothy, funny and romantic.  It's a little bit funny, not the least bit frothy, and not really romantic.

I did not realize until the credits rolled just how much of a Julie Delpy movie this is.  She wrote the script, starred, produced, wrote some of the music.  Her real life family played her family in the movie.

This often reminded me of a Woody Allen flick, specifically Annie Hall.  However, this is a much edgier movie.  Jack and Marion are both too caught up in their own issues to connect effectively with each other.  It's not really a love story.  Ultimately the focus becomes the clash of two cultures.  Marion is a Paris girl.  Jack is an American with a Jewish name who is not a practicing Jew and is often mistaken for an Arab or a terrorist.  They are on Marion's turf.  Jack usually flounders, and she doesn't do much to help him out.

Marion's voice-over narration is the strongest part of the movie for me.  She shows insight and self-awareness that is usually lacking in her scenes with Jack (in fact toward the end of the movie I am almost ready to side with Jack that she has serious anger management issues and is in dire need of professional help.)  I felt like the viewer is meant to pick a side, Jack's or Marion's.  But that would require a level of involvement that I just didn't feel.

I also thought the soundtrack was appealing.

I know that Julie Delpy has made other movies with the same basic premise.  I understand there is at least one more to come, Two Days in New York.  Actually it will be interesting to see Marion in America.  I may eventually check out Before Sunrise and Before Sunset, but I am certainly not ready to admit this is Julie Delpy's world and we're all just living in it.",1326758400,2,1807,4.409090909090909
3261803,5,B000YDMPAQ,Amusing and heart-felt. The chemistry between Delpy and Goldberg is outstanding; it truly does feel like they been with each other for years. This movie answers must needed-to-know questions: How many ex-boyfriends can you run into in your homeland? How do you order a Big Mac in a foreign country? Why would one pose for an embarrassing photo that you'll know will end up haunting you?,1300752000,,386,4.863636363636363
3261814,4,B000YDMPAQ,"The film opens with a night-train scene from Venice to Paris that should resonate with anyone whose done train travel in Europe. In the scene Marion (Julie Delpy) does a photo montage complemented by her voice narrating that flys through a lot of information quickly, contextualizing the viewer within a foreign environment (assuming the viewer is American). This technique is one of the film's strengths and she uses it throughout to catch people up to speed on Paris life.

The 2 main characters in love exemplify the difficulties and blisses of a cross-cultural relationship as they realize their affections for one another do not prevent cultural clashes. What's kosher for one is not for the other, but because they are open (eventually) they stay together.

Delpy's mastery pushes the movie from cliche romantic comedy to true ""film"" enjoyable by people who like either. It will particulary appeal to Americans who have/like traveling in Europe and searching for connections abroad.",1294099200,,988,5.2075471698113205

Her character in this movie of hers reminded of Annie, from Woody Allen's movie ""Annie Hall"", of course.

The movie is very funny in its American v. French ideas.
Ms. Delpy played all of that up to its funniest.
I love her social consciousness thing. Bemoaning the ugly things of the world, but not being able to do a thing about it other than to only get angry at people.

Marion wants to show her American boyfriend Jack something of herself, by showing him something of the city she grew up in. They both get more than they bargained for, with absurdly comic results.

This is very much a Julie Delpy project. She wrote, produced, directed, starred, edited and musically arranged the movie, and the results are in: it is an excellent and original film not only about 'couple-hood' but the process of understanding, misunderstanding and simply 'getting-along' with the rest of humanity.

Adam Goldberg performs admirably as Jack, a New Yorker with an interesting bouquet of nueroses and a snappy comeback. Julie's father Albert played the delightful part of her (walk-on part please... ;) whacky bohemian dad. Aleksia Landeau, Adan Jodorowsky and Daniel Bruhl handle their funny, extremely quirky roles so very well.

3261841,5,B000YDMPAQ,"2 Days in Paris is a refreshing, layered, truthful depiction of relationships. The film makes shrewd observations on how a relationship influences the human heart, soul and mind. The coupling without losing the individual. Sometimes you get blinded, often you are insecure and eventually, you might get it right. This chatty, extremely funny and insightful romantic comedy finds talented actress Julie Delpy directing her own script. She co-stars with ex-boyfriend Adam Goldberg, her own parents and even her cat makes a cameo appearance.

This sharp film reveals the minutiae and varied aspects of a relationship. Marion [Delpy] is a 35-year-old French woman who lives in New York. She's a photographer and has been with her serious, brooding, introspective boyfriend, Jack [Goldberg], an interior designer, for two years. After a trip to Venice, the couple stops in Paris to see her parents. During those 48-hours, Marion runs into several ex-boyfriends, throwing him into an insecure spiral and he starts to question her commitment. It's a turning point for them as the relationship will either wither or bloom in the City of Love.

Delpy attacks Parisian stereotypes in a way only someone French can really do. She shows the real, gritty parts of Paris; the political undertones, the racism, the immigrants and the less-romantic side-- the dark underbelly.  2 Days in Paris simultaneously evokes Delpy's love of the city and her distain for its politics and hypocrisy.

2 Days in Paris is thoughtful, genuine and amusing in its reflections on love and self-identity for a career-oriented woman in her 30s. She's independent, has had many loves and relationships in her past. In this refreshing film, the focus is a career-oriented woman who does not want children, has slept with more than a dozen men and is neither regretful nor apologetic and loves her cat and boyfriend equally.",1231286400,2,1886,5.173770491803278

3261862,4,B000YDMPAQ,"For anyone who has ever experienced cross cultural (cross Atlantic) love affair, this movie is the bull's eye in describing obstacles in the relationship of two people who come from two very different countries and backgrounds.  I personally wanted to see a film that was Julie Delpy's own little personal project since she has already shown her incredible talent as an actress and now is ready to reveal herself to the world as a writer, director and musician.  She is obviously multi talented and smart and she is still beautiful even without any makeup on her face during certain shots in this movie.  The relationship is between two neurotic people: French woman (Delpy), a photographer, and an American man (Goldberg) an interior designer.  Their professions have a hint of artistic tendencies without any pretensions.  Both are in their mid-thirties and well aware that by now each had their own share of heartache and disappointments from past relationships.  Can these two lovers from two different backgrounds, one too repressed and another unable to control her impulses capable to salvage their relationship and build from there?  This is really what the film is all about.  This is not about pure love, first love, biggest love or the last love - it is about two middle aged, somewhat damaged people trying to be adults, rationalize each other's shortcomings and still be acceptable and forgiving of them.  It is about making compromises rather than facing loneliness and superficial idea that things could be better with someone else.  Film has many funny moments that anyone can relate to: racist cab drivers; overzealous mother who likes to do the laundry and have it neatly folded in the lover's bedroom; free spirited father who just has to get his way with the people parking their car(s) in the way of pedestrians walkway; sexual repression vs. free spirit ready to contain itself to a committed relationship.  I like the movie because it is honest and true.  It is definitely Ms. Delpy's labor of love.  If there is one weak point in the movie that it is its ending.

--------
Delpy connat bien les tats-Unis o elle habite, certes avec des interruptions, mais depuis ses tudes (ce qui doit faire une petite vingtaine d''annes). Elle est donc trs bien place pour faire un film sur un Gringo dcouvrant les Franais. C''est bien men, bien vu et drle pendant la premire moiti du film. Malheureusement ensuite le film s''embrouille et perd de sa substance et donc de son intrt. En effet, la personnalit de cette jeune femme (au demeurant fort bonne actrice) n''est pas assez dense et il est dommage qu''elle imprgne tout le film : Delpy a fait le film, l'a mont, a fait une partie de la musique et y fait jouer ses parents. Mme si on ne sait rien de sa vie prive et de ce qu''elle a vraiment mis de ses expriences dans le film, elle se montre trop pour qu''on ne sache pas sparer Delpy de son personnage Marion. Le seul intrt du film est ce qu''une expatrie voit de la France et la ralisatrice aurait d se limiter  cet aspect, surtout que son acteur, Adam Goldberg, est crdible (sans plus cependant ; habitu des sries tlvises qui ont fait connatre son visage, il essaye de s''en sortir en jouant un personnage de sous-Woody Allen auquel on a la charit de croire). Le petit monde parisien est bien croqu, malgr les clichs bobos sur les chauffeurs de taxi ; ils sont la cible d''un tonnant  racisme de classe , trs courant  Paris il faut le dire. Ce qui est moins bien vu est tout ce qui a trait au couple et comme l''histoire  ce propos prend beaucoup de place  la fin et qu''elle n''est pas assez structure, la dynamique du film en ptit. Deux moments dsagrables sont un chauffeur de taxi qui n''aimant personne ne peut tre qu''antismite et un bourgeois expatri qui, tant cadre, ne peut tre qu''amateur d''adolescentes thalandaises (bons et mauvais expatris ? on a devin qui faisait partie du premier groupe). Autre chose d'tonnant : une constante vulgarit et beaucoup de gros mots hors de propos (les parents sont tonnamment et inutilement orduriers).

Fans of the angelic Ms. Delpy, or of Paris, will have to check this out, naturellement, but it is best to keep your expectations rather low.  Delpy demonstrates a sure hand with framing shots, and really, it's not possible to make Paris look unappealing, but Delpy and Adam Goldberg as the respective halves of an estranged couple sure give it the old college try, with more or less constant bickering marring the pretty views.  Enroute home to New York after a disasterous trip to Venice, Marion (Delpy) and her crabby, misthanthropic boyfriend (Goldberg) stop off for a weekend in Paris to visit her parents.  These two have been together for two years, which is long enough for once charming and endearing clashes in personal style to become grating and hateful, and that is the point at which these two have arrived.  Within the familiar environment of her childhood home, Marion is transformed in the eyes of her culture-shocked beau into something of a potty-mouthed slut with an indiscriminate and prolific past; he is not sure how to cope with this unflattering metamorphosis or the revelation that Marion has seemingly slept with half the men in Paris prior to moving in with him.  There are some nuggets of comedy gold here that Adam Goldberg might have been able to mine were he more like Bill Murray and less like himself, which is to say, dour and hairy.  As much as the audience wants to sympathize with his linguistic and romantic plight, Goldberg makes his character deeply unappealing, and we think yeah, it might be better if he were out of the picture altogether.  Three stars for some charming street scenes of Paris, and for the delightfully bawdy performances of the actors playing Marion's maman and papa--they are Delpy's real-life parents and are the best thing in it.",1222128000,5,1864,4.839622641509434

3261870,2,B000YDMPAQ,"2 days in Paris (2007) was produced/written/directed/edited/scored/starred by Julie Delpi who also recruited her real parents to play the parents of Marion, her alter ago.

Julie Delpy who was absolutely charming as Celene, the heroine of two Richard Linklater's movies (Before the Sunrise and Before Sunset), tried to make the similar film or rather follow-up about the couple that have been together for few years, experience some problem in their relationship, and try to work them out. Judging by the fact that Delpy has thrown so much of herself in all aspects of creating the film, she deserves my deepest respect. The problem is, as much as her movie walks the same territory as Before the Sunrise and Before Sunset (it takes place in Paris as the title suggests), it is not as good as they were. The chemistry between two main characters, the French Marion (Delpy) and New Yorker, Jack (Adam Goldberg) is completely non-existent, the plot is very thin but it is not even the biggest problem. The film has no subtlety, elegance, wit, or charm, and if it does, they are very well hidden. Yes, few times Woody Allen's name came to my mind because Adam Goldberg seemed doing homage to Woody Allen's character, neurotic, unsecured, and whining - and not particularly good one. He was mean, often without the reason. The scene in the beginning of the movie when Jack gives the group of the Americans tourists the apparently wrong directions to Louver just because he is sure that they are conservative Bush supporters does not make him a white knight, and it is just not funny. I also did not find charming Marion sending to her family via e-mail the picture of naked Jack with the colorful balloons. I have nothing against pictures a la nude, and from what I was able to notice, Jack had nothing to be ashamed of but how about privacy and trust in the relationship? Whatever happens between two people in their intimacy should stay between them because it belongs to them only. How about simply asking a boyfriend if he would not mind his funny picture be sent to his girlfriend's family? Does sensitive, intelligent, feisty Marion ever think of it? I was so much in love and could not get enough of one afternoon in Paris few years back with Celene and Jesse. 77 minutes long Before Sunrise was so clever, so romantic, and so moving that it made me want to see another movie with French girl and her American love, to find out what could've happened to them. Well, little did I know that it would be ""2 Days in Paris"". It is sad for me to admit, but Delpy's follow up to two of the most romantic modern screen observations of the relationships was a disappointment. I should mention that Delpy's movie has some positive sides to it. I liked how she showed HER Paris, very real, tough, and not sentimental. I liked for the most parts her parents Albert Delpy and Marie Pillet in their roles. There is one scene that I enjoyed and every time I think of it, it makes me smile. On their way to visit Jim Morrison's grave at Per Lashes, Marion asks Jake, Why do you want to see Jim Morrison's grave? You don't even like The Doors. And he answers, ""It is a famous grave...I am a huge fan of Val Kilmer"". Sadly, all the bright points were not enough to save the movie - I never thought that two days in one of my favorite places in the world may be so unbearably long and disappointing.",1215043200,2,3383,4.555008210180624
3261871,1,B000YDMPAQ,"Maybe it was intentionally played out as such, but this film left me disappointed and bored. Not the least of the reasons for the ennui is that Delpy already made this film, much more effectively, with Ethan Hawke under Richard Linklater's direction. Supposedly this film, as with Sunset, is somewhat based on her romance with the male protagonist. Maybe it helps the drama to know that Hawke left Uma Thurman for Delpy and that the pivotal rant on the riverboat rang with an authenticity that one can not make up. Maybe this boyfriend, Greenberg, is as neurotica and hypochnodriac as he is played. The result is that Sunset is emtionally engaging while 2 Days seems like it's never going to end.
Both Delpy and Greenberg essay stereotypes. He is the shlub hybrid of Woody Allen crossed with Jerry Seinfeld, without any of the redeeming characteristics of either. He's not that funny, and all I could feel after every moment of him on film was oy. If this is based on real life, whatever did Delpy see in this guy? Delpy for her part goes from the fast talking, liberated lover who still carried a torch lit by a sense of guilt and revenge in Sunset to just a fast talking and shallow promiscuous bonbon in 2 Days, a French blonde pretending to be Woody Allen. Not my cup of doppio I am afraid. Both characters are relentlessly grating. Nails down a chalk board the entire time they are on film. The scene of her getting him to put on a condom is possibly the least funny sexual comedy ever recorded. He gives up. I did too, and the film had hardly gone 30 minutes. It got worse as it went on.
And while the city of Paris was a notable supporting player in the Sunset film, the city this time looks like if it could get out of this movie it would. More's the pity this wasn't filmed someplace more grim, as there's nothing to laugh at here.
Delpy wears glasses and has an ugly astigmatism and is somewhat autistic according to the storyline. None of that means much or explains much, but there you have it. Supposedly she took up photography and then Greenberg usurped that role on whatever trip this is supposed to be. Perhaps that is a political statement on US/Franco relations. Perhaps I'm hoping she might actually have been reaching to say something. In any case, it is a far cry from the story that unfolds in Sunset as two lovers reunite at first just to find out what happened to each other and then come through the anger and recrimination of missed opportunities and settled decisions that have imprisoned each while the other always hoped for another chance. This is just two self-absorbed, mean spirited whiners, ugly american nails ugly french tart. I am reminded of the Eric Idle bit in the tourist sketch about the guy who whines and whines in a stream of consciousness about Whatley's red ale and they don't make the scones like they do in Dorset and.....
Hopefully Delpy is capable of better. Maybe give up on the old boyfriend routine. She isn't Joni Mitchell in film, so leave the forlorn romances to someone else. That or just do such films with Hawke. There was a real chemistry present that is conspicuous by its absence here. The only saving graces of this film are her parents, who are deliciously off the rive gauche throughout the movie, and the actress who plays her sister. Mom's a little nuts, and Dad has obviously OD'd on Cialis. The sister is as much of a hoot as Christopher Walkin was as Diane Keaton's brother in Annie Hall. That's small compensation for enduring Delpy and Greenberg.",1214179200,7,3520,4.580031695721078
3261882,1,B000YDMPAQ,"This was a difficult movie for me to get through. In fact, I found myself completely disinterested and literally waiting for the movie to end. The male lead character seems merely an incredibly bad homage to Woody Allen.

I've seen Adam Goldberg before in non-lead roles and enjoyed his style of sharp, sardonic humor, but it was just a non-stop whine-fest throughout this entire film...and utterly petty for the most part.

Don't get me wrong, I love neurotic characters - Julie Dempy's character, for the most part, is fantastic - and I very much enjoy dark humor, but Adam Goldberg's character was just a complete drag and made it very difficult to remain engaged.",1214092800,10,667,4.842105263157895
3261883,1,B000YDMPAQ,"I had high expectations of this movie after its review but it was about as interesting to me as watching water boil. Take these two out of that beautiful setting and the movie wouldn't have been watchable. Much of the dialogue is in French, which we're privy to with the captions. Adam Goldberg is excluded from many conversations at family meals, conversations Julie Delpy has with friends and old lovers who seem to pop up with amazing frquency in this short time. The 'eccentricity' of her artist father is illustrated in one scene by his scratching marks on cars with a key if they dare have a tire up on the sidewalk. Funny? I think not. Delray is a bit ditzy and screams a lot. Goldberg pouts a lot. In the end, they seem to have some sort of bond that never becomes clear to me. My recommendation is 'don't waste your time'.",1210982400,5,831,4.437908496732026
3261884,2,B000YDMPAQ,"A young couple, Marion (Julie Delpy) and Jack (Adam Goldberg), find their relationship imperiled during a visit to Marion's home town of Paris.  Jack is neurotic and insecure; Marion is flighty and insensitive.  Both are whiny and judgmental.  An amusing film could be made about this couple, but writer/director Julie Delpy doesn't seem to realize how irritating they are and wants us to love and identify with them instead.

There are a couple of strong points here.  Delpy's real life parents (Albert Delpy and Marie Pillet) are wonderful as her fictional parents.  Also, the depictions of Paris's cab drivers, restaurants, and street life make it feel like a real city, not merely a picturesque backdrop for romance and intrigue.  But that's not enough to save this self-indulgent bore of a film.",1208649600,4,800,5.061068702290076
3261885,4,B000YDMPAQ,"For anyone who has spent time in Paris, so many little details, experiences, subtleties and attitudes found in this movie will be all-too-familiar.  Ms. Delpy has managed to accurately discern and distill much of the Parisian experience from the outsider's perspective.  For those who haven't experienced it for themselves, much of the rich detail and enjoyment of this movie will be lost on the viewer, and dare I say, without hopefully sounding too snobbish, an understanding of the spoken French is a plus as well for catching the extra humorous bits that don't quite make it to the subtitles.

Loved the cab drivers, fast-food clerk, parties, bizarre people, attitudes, etc...  I've met them all and often!

Ms. Delpy's family were a hoot.

People often ask me why I love going to Paris so much, and my answer to them is usually that I never fail to see entertaining high drama while there.  Et voil&agrave;.

So, if you love hanging out in Paris, you will love this movie, hence my 4 stars.",1207353600,4,995,4.777777777777778
3261886,2,B000YDMPAQ,Found the movie not as funny as I thought it would be. Also too exaggerated to the point of uneasiness where I didn't even recognized the French even though I'm a native from France.,1206576000,3,182,4.382352941176471
3261887,1,B000YDMPAQ,"Though Delpy has been reasonably competent in earlier films, in this one - almost totally her product - she is not only boring but irritating.  Pointless and tasteless, this film does not even show the wonderful city of Paris to good advantage.",1206403200,5,244,4.809523809523809
3261888,4,B000YDMPAQ,"Julie Delpy's character rings modern and true, like Sex and the City set in bohemian Paris. It's refreshing to see a female lead fumble through a relationship as carelessly and self-centeredly as men do, and always have. This is the modern woman with choices, and they overwhelm her even as she comes to realize that she no longer wants to go through the endless cycle of breaking up, rebounding, and finding connection again, and again. Goldberg's character has our sympathy, and we feel for him as he watches Delpy flirt her way to commitment. This is an engaging and quirky role reversal. And Delpy's deft script allows us to ponder political questions from terrorism to women's rights to the environment: her father keys cars parked carelessly because he ""doesn't like them."" It isn't always pleasant--the couple argues through much of the film, and it often veers into the mundane--but that makes it more lke life. And Delpy makes us laugh along the way.",1206230400,3,959,4.889570552147239
3261889,5,B000YDMPAQ,"I am an American who lived in Europe for years and I can't tell you how true this movie is. So many of the scenes in this movie actually happened to me. The entire scene with the woman's parents is so funny and true. I laughed so many times during this movie. It is also nice to see a movie that is not freighted down with all the B.S. we weigh down movies with in the U.S. (all the illusions about relationships ""lasting forever"" and all that kind of stuff that movies in the U.S. get weighed down with), etc. The Delphy character is really typical of a specific type of European woman who admits she only is going to stay with a guy for 2 years, but that it will be fun. Very, very good movie.

BTW, Paris is EXACTLY like that. That scene in the McDonalds actually happened to me.",1203984000,4,782,4.144736842105263
3261890,5,B000YDMPAQ,"There is not a dull moment in this film. Delpy has a blast playing with cliches and truisms about the French - and Americans. She pokes at the racism,  promiscuity, xenophobia, intellectual pretensions and vulgarity that come to light as soon as one scratches the surface of the French psyche.

On the other hand, she also shows the hearty, food-loving, stylish and alive core of the French where the family sticks together for better and worse and where life is appreciated for its own sake.

An argument for the French is not a time to reach for the gun, or call the psychiatrist - it is an opportunity to display how you feel, and get the emotional charge out of your system. A healthy way of being in the world, which sometimes scares the crap out of the typical American ...yet what do you prefer: the true person or fake politeness?

The film plays with national and class stereotypes in a tight, fast-paced, brilliantly scripted story which nevertheless finds plenty of space to touch genuine and deep human emotions and predicaments. Delpy explores the nature of connection tethered to the inexorable fact the we know all too well: that ""love"" and commitment involves daily negotiation, adaptation and acceptance of teh partner for who they are. A relationship where personal quirks and idiosyncrasies are not only indulged but in some weird way celebrated. Where one never knows when or why the break-up occurs, sometimes hanging in on the precipice of chance.

In other words, Delpy's Paris, and her French and Americans are real people and the story is a story about reality, even though, paradoxically, the film itself is made to poke fun at cliches. I laughed most the time, and at other times I was sad. What more can one want from a film?",1203811200,8,1753,4.753289473684211
3261891,3,B000YDMPAQ,"I've opined in the past that Julie Delpy has been underutilized by Hollywood and Paris - my feeling being that she's deemed too American for French tastes, too French for American tastes.  So, like in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Before-Sunset/dp/B0002YLC24/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Before Sunset</a>&nbsp;(which she co-wrote), Ms. Delpy has taken things into her own hands here by writing, directing, editing and composing this film.  Impressive!  For good measure, she did the majority of the casting as well, corralling her parents (who are actors) and Adam Goldberg into the production.

Like 'Before Sunset,' the film is a torrent of words.  It looks improvised, but it's not.  For example, as Delpy points out in the 'Making Of' featurette, the dinner scene where Goldberg meets Delpy's parents in a cross-cultural gaffe-fest was, in fact, highly scripted.

The head-scratcher is why these two characters (Delpy's and Goldberg's) are a couple.  As the film goes on, Goldberg's character goes from quirky to annoying to downright unlikeable.  I know she's playing a role, but as a Julie Delpy fan I found myself wanting to urge her that she deserved better.

That criticism aside, there are some very well-observed, flat-out funny passages in the film.",1203120000,3,1305,5.715025906735751

8232203,1,B000YDMPAQ,"The movie seemed promising at first. An unmarried couple consisting of a hypochondriac American man and a blond French woman travel from New York to Europe on vacation with the idea of reviving their failing relationship. Having first gone to Venice, Italy, they then travel to Paris to meet her parents and sister. Problem is, when walking through Paris, the girlfriend meets up with a lot of her old paramours, which displeases the boyfriend.

I was expecting a romantic comedy or farce, but while there were a few laughs, overall the movie was stilted and unconvincing and we didn't finish. The minor characters were little better than stereotypes, but worst of all was the couple, who spent so much time arguing and fighting that it was impossible to believe they even liked, let alone loved, each other, or could even stand each other's presence. They boyfriend's overdone hypochondria and girlfriend's nonstop chattering was too much even if this film had been intended as a farce.

It may be a French film, but the fact that I've seen French reviewers who also disliked this movie says plenty. Spend no time with this movie.",1521331200,,1131,4.885416666666667
