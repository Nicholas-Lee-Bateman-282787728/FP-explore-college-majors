8532624,1,B000NVL7D0,"I have bought video from Discovery Channel before, and this was the first time I've had a problem. The disk just freezes in certain spots, and locks up the whole DVD player. It doesn't happen with other disks, so I can rule out my player. I cleaned the disk, and even used a disk repair on it, but it still is not working properly. I ordered another episode of B.B. and had the same problem. I'm not happy with the quality of Discovery's product and will probably not buy any more disks.",1210291200,,487,4.304347826086956
