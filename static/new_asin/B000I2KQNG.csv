8143638,1,B000I2KQNG,"The audio and visual quality of this film is a bitter disappointment.  It's difficult to imagine that the producer (Madacy Entertainment, Quebec, Candada) was unaware of the serious shortcomings of this production - all the more reason to be cautious in purchasing anything from them in the future.  In fact, this production is so deficient and disappointing that its an affront to the men who died in the Pacific theater.  ""Thoughtless, commercialized crap!"" is probably the kindest thing one could say.",1291852800,4,504,5.197530864197531
8143639,1,B000I2KQNG,"I'm not sure how the soundtrack made it past QC, but half the time you can't hear the amateur-quality narration for the sound effects and music in the background.  Video clips replayed several times don't add anything to the experience, and in the end it's time you'll never have back again.  Get something from Time Life instead, which actually previews its discs before selling them.  Spending money on something this bad is affrontery towards yourself.  Iwo Jima's hardly in here anyway.",1225065600,3,490,5.012345679012346
8143640,2,B000I2KQNG,"This is a 2-disc set bloated to 5 discs by redundant playing of the same scenes for different narratives. Audio quality variable with the narrations often overcome by the music. Editing poor as infrequent use of maps and credits given at the end of first half of disc and again at end of disc. Iwo Jima only occupies one half of disc 5 and naval battles are glided over, so misleading title. In all, kind of boring to watch.
