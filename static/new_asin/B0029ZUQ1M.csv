3883151,4,B0029ZUQ1M,A cracking good anime until half way through when it starts repeating itself heavily.  I do have to agree with the first reviewer.  The case that the five dvds are packaged in is made with some pretty cheap plastic.  The tabs that keep the dvds in the case started falling apart on day one.  And by day five they were all broken.  Invest in some cases to keep these precious dvds safe!,1254009600,,385,4.291666666666667
3883152,1,B0029ZUQ1M,"My rating has nothing to do with the series.  This is my favorite anime series of all, however, I have to give this specific product 1 star because it comes in a poorly designed DVD case.  Upon opening my box, I immediately saw what the problem was.  The studio producing this anime, Right Stuf, has crammed all five DVDs into a single clamshell case, and this case can barely fit them all.  Upon opening the DVD case, two the of the DVDs spilled out and almost hit the ground.  After examining the case, I saw that part of the lock that keeps the DVDs in place had broken and could not hold the DVDs in place.  While this can be attributed to a damage in transit issue, I also attribute it to the poor design of the case and the cost cutting measures of Right Stuf.  To shave off some costs of including individual cases, they're sacrificing the quality and safety of the product by shoving it all in a single, easily damaged, case.  Also, the DVDs can only be taken out two at a time and it's inconvenient to swap them in and out, especially with a broken case.

Do yourself a favor and purchase the box set with individual cases.  I used to own that unit and it was much easier to use with less stress.",1251849600,8,1205,4.245614035087719

3883163,2,B0029ZUQ1M,I was hooked on the show from the first episode but overall I became more and more disappointed. They end up spending about 3-4 episodes just recapping the whole show which just wasted my time and the time and money they could have spent on new episodes. Also the animation got worse as the show went on which at times made me wonder if it was worth finishing. If you do manage to watch the whole show it then ends in the middle of the story with no end in site. I have never read the manga but after looking it up on line it only got through 7 of them and there are 21 volumes of the manga. So if you really want to try out this story I would suggest the manga as that is the only way you will even feel it has been finished off properly,1400889600,3,738,3.9266666666666667

However the packaging was just terrible, I had to find sleeves to fit the discs in becouse the no longer stayed secured in the case. That was a bit of a bummer.",1393027200,,424,4.379746835443038

If you don't like being left hanging, i suggest you turn yourself towards the book then the anime.",1388707200,,393,4.0256410256410255

3883171,5,B0029ZUQ1M,"This anime I found to be witty and fun and also very candid at times. Other times, a bit too dramatic. But I guess that is totally compliant with the age of the main characters. Especially since this is a love story :) and yes, as in many other anime, there are some fillers but..if you get bored you can skip them or at least that's what I did. They did not affect my experience with this series.

I watched this as a teen and..well, nostalgia made me want to see it again. I actually remembered it which I cannot say about all anime I have watched. I found it at what I would call a great price here and, so far, I have nothing to complain about. I like the fact that it's all in one DVD case (I think there are 5 DVDs) and as such it doesn't take up a lot of space. However, this can mean it is easier for the case to get damaged during transport so take that into consideration. I was lucky and nothing seems wrong with it, but that's just...luck.

Good quality/price ratio and a nice series! I think this anime deserves at least a chance, as for this edition, for me it was perfect.",1368403200,,1087,4.098591549295775
3883172,5,B0029ZUQ1M,"This is one of my favorite anime series. If you aren't a bit of a romantic at heart then you probably will not find this entertaining. I'd definitely describe this as a rom/com but there is enough drama thrown in to add an element of tension and keep you on your toes. First saw a few episodes of this series many years ago in college when I was part of the anime club and it stuck with me ever since till here, years later, I decided to track it down and order the complete series. For the price, I definitely think it is worth it.",1360800000,,532,4.076190476190476
3883173,5,B0029ZUQ1M,"Or hard to top most of them anyway.  The 'positive' reviews definitely say it all - there is no other way to say how wonderful this series is.  Wholly and completely, even if you watch and happen to feel the 2nd half loses some steam you will still be watching and/or have watched one of the finest anime you'll ever lay eyes on, if not only within this genre, possibly among all of them.

The only thing I want to add is something missing from the Amazon list of inclusions, which is to say something that isn't noted.  Where they have listed: ""Special Features: None"" that's incorrect.  I realize not EVERYONE cares whether special features are included, ""His and Her Circumstances"" contains: Director Notes, Translation Notes, Production Notes, Character Bios (something I always read and love regardless of the title - I think these are often quite funny when done properly and they help when watching because you can watch *through* the character's eyes so to speak; and see things as they would see them.  There's also: Storyboards, VA Interviews, English VA Outtakes, Phone Messages, the Original Trailer, and of course, trailers.  (Trailers are basically a staple on any DVD/BD collection even when there are no other special features.  When the trailers are for titles I've already seen I still watch all of them for fun and fairly often I run across something I haven't seen in a while causing me to go to my own library like collection so i can re-watch something I haven't seen for a while.)

Back on point - ""His and Her Circumstances"" has a nearly zero percent chance of boring you or leaving you wishing you'd never seen it.  When I first bought it I did so ""sight unseen"" (basically) and from the trailer alone.  I didn't read a single review until AFTER I'd seen it.  This is an entirely superb 26 episodes.  I'm writing this now actually because I'm back on Amazon buying another set.  My first set was loaned out to a friend and accidentally damaged (just one disc) but since I didn't want an unplayable disc she got to keep the set and go hunting for the single replacement and I'll replace the entire collection for myself.  For under 30 bucks it's a steal anyway...I'd pay double in a heart beat.  (Maybe I shouldn't say that here where an Amazonian might see it and jack the price up!  But it should also speak volumes about what I thought of the series.) :-)

A quick list of some others: ""Suzuka, Ai Yori Aoshi, Peach Girl, Love Hina, To Heart, Boys Be, Rumbling Hearts, Kanon, Clannad, Air"" (there are still more of course) - and some definitely go a different route than others with truly heart-wrenching moments, a couple of which bring me to tears every time I watch them. (I'm a 40 year old man unashamed of a single tear shed simply because they are **THAT POWERFUL**).  If you've seen any or all of those I listed I assure you, you will like ""His and Her Circumstances"".  And if you're looking for more recommendations, well there ya go! ;-)

I hope you enjoy as much as I have, each and every time!!",1359676800,,3032,4.5777777777777775
3883174,5,B0029ZUQ1M,"i love it
it is a great show
i would recommend it to all my friends and everyone i know
THANK YOU!!!!",1358553600,,101,3.6363636363636362
3883175,4,B0029ZUQ1M,"First of all, I would like to state that this review comes from a person who formerly had no knowledge of this show or what it was about. I bought this from Amazon on a whim, looking for new titles I hadn't seen before.

Kare Kano really starts off as a story about the blossoming friendship/romance between the main two characters of the story, but actually progresses past that and delves into the stories of all the fellow classmates. In that regard, it is similar to Azumanga Diaoh and indeed, this anime has many funny points. For anyone who has been to a public high school, I think it will be easy to relate to the characters in this story, even if romance isn't your thing (certainly isn't mine). The two characters actually grow as people throughout the story as do a number of the other characters. Personally, I think that kind of thing is rare in film today, especially in a series.

So I was pleasantly surprised when I watched this all the way through and actually enjoyed it.

My only source of contention with this series is that it didn't feel like the ending was really an ending. I don't know if that was intentional or not, but I felt I was left hanging.

Also, it should be noted that there are several different styles of animation utilized in this series, which kind of keeps things going. There's a bit of live-action play, storyboard art used in place of actual animation, manga panels, etc. This should come as no surprise to those who have seen Gainax's other titles (FLCL comes to mind). Personally, I felt this unconventional use of different styles kept the stories from getting too boring or stagnant.

I would gladly recommend this to people to watch who enjoy a more down to earth story than what might typically be found in anime.",1335916800,,1764,4.55205047318612
3883176,4,B0029ZUQ1M,"This is a really good series, but they never finished it! At the end of the DVD it is incomplete so there is no ending. :( then the box is reallllly cheap. When I opened the box, a chunk of it broke off at the side. And one of the DVDs inside doesn't stay in, it always falls out.",1325980800,,280,3.76271186440678
3883177,5,B0029ZUQ1M,"Yukino Miyazawa, a seemingly perfect girl, came to high school with the wind at her back, in theory at least. In truth, this model student was actually an obsessive narcissist who works herself ragged to win the praise of teachers and the awe of classmates. Her secret seemed safe, until she met Souichirou Arima, another seemingly perfect student, who ends up outclassing her. She at first doesn't know how to handle this, but then comes an opportunity when he actually confesses his love for her. But what at first appears to her to be as an ace in the hole ends up being the beginning of a life changing year in this unusual series.
The story is told primarily through the eyes of Yukino, the seemingly perfect girl, who in truth is rather eccentric and an absolute delight to observe as she tries to adapt to her new reality. We also get to meet Arima, the nice guy with the troubled past, as well as the large number of additional cast members that come into the story line as it progresses. The story is told mostly in a straight forward manner, but there are several episodes that use flashbacks, occasional live shots, and even partly drawn single frame shots, which make this story all the more interesting. If there is any flaw in this story, it may be that the characters sometimes come off as harsh at times, but not having seen the Japanese version, I can't tell if the dialogue was correctly translated, so there may be less to this than I think.
Do these characters live happily ever after? They don't say. (in fact, at the end, there's a hint of a whole other story line beginning) But I can say that this story is nicely told, and very well drawn. There's a lot to like about ""His and Her Circumstances"" and I think it's more than worth your time.",1295481600,5,1764,4.4813664596273295
3883178,2,B0029ZUQ1M,"This anime as well as its plot and characters have a lot of potential but this anime as a whole is plagued by issues that the thrill of watching it. They are listed below:

- Has too much filler and drama. It also goes off n tagents which shows the filler that this anime has.

- The plot synopsis constantly keeps on showing at the start of nearly every episode after the first one. It explains thew story to us like we're idiots and didn't understand what we saw, when we actually did. This is one part of this anime's filler.

- There's not enough comedy in it. While there are some funny parts, they are few and far between.

- There's not enough character development, This anime's characters act more dramatic, weird and indescisive rather than quirky, fun and interesting. They act more like the characters from the anime: ""Neon Genesis Evangelion,"" which is not a good sign and shows that these characters need to go see a psychiatrist.

- Hideki Asaba, a character in this anime keeps acting gay towards Arima.

- Kazuma's male friends kissed him too much in one episode.

- This anime doesn't have a conclusion and makes no sense. The plot is interesting but it doesn't really go anywhere and nothing really happens in it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
""His and Her Circumstances"" would've been more developed and had an actually conclusion, its a waste of time. 5/10",1293494400,4,1433,4.91701244813278
3883179,5,B0029ZUQ1M,This is a MUST HAVE !! I have watched this hundreds of times and it never gets old.,1272499200,,83,3.6666666666666665
3883180,5,B0029ZUQ1M,"""His & Her Circumstances"" eases anime watchers with touching teenager romance, even if quality declined at the end.

This series has suffered from mixed reviews throughout its run. Director Hideaki Anno, known as the director of ""Neon Genesis Evangelion,"" helmed the production of this series. However, the series literally degenerated as the director fought with Masami Tsuda, the original manga artist of this series.

For anyone unfamiliar with the manga, ""Kare Kano"" is about a girl named Yukino Miyazawa. She is a talented, beautiful overachiever who strives for perfection. She's frustrated with having to compete with Soichiro Arima, a boy who is also one of the top students.

Unlike Arima, Miyazawa is a spoiled slob at home who studies endlessly to maintain her grades. Arima discovers her alter-ego when he arrives at Miyazawa's house to return a Brahms CD he borrowed from her. At first, he threatens to reveal her secret facade by forcing her to do his work for the student council for a few days. However, their feelings gradually deepen for each other. After a small argument, they begin to care for each other.

""His or Her Circumstances"" takes a closer look at the complications of high school romance. It also looks into the deeper problems of Arima's own family conflicts. His own parents were blackmailers, who deserted him because of a huge debt they couldn't pay off. Although this series tends to ramble during some episodes, it never loses its charm until the director of the series quit working on the series.

Certainly this series has its flaws. The ending sequence is a boring motion sequences with a live camera in a Japanese high school. Parts of the series were taken out of the DVD because of arguments between animation studio Gainax and the manga artist. The last story arc of the series remains unfinished.

Yet the series never loses the charm it retains in the opening sequence. ""His & Her Circumstances"" easily has the best opening animation of a shoujo series ever. The theme song, ""Tenshi no Yubikiri"" (translated as ""The Angel's promise""), is a lovely ballad as charming as an American Motown song. Viewers will be even more impressed by Anno's ability to mix the psychological elements of ""Evangelion"" seamlessly into a romantic atmosphere.

Overall, ""His & Her Circumstances"" is a must-buy. The warm relationship of Miyazawa and Arima is worth every penny, no matter how you may argue about the unfinished ending. Everything, from the beautiful character designs to the touching anime shading, is too wonderful to pass up.",1271116800,3,2565,5.021176470588236
3883181,4,B0029ZUQ1M,"His and Her Circumstances is a story of 2 high school students who are seen as exceptional and perfect individuals. Sadly both only put up a front so they can get ahead and please the ideals of others. When they discover that they understand each other rather well Yukino and Arima develop a friendship that begins to form a romance; however, the dark secrets within Arima's past make their relationship difficult, but Yukino tries her best to save Arima from destroying himself with depression.

This DVD set features all 26 episodes and while the series loses some steam in the final episodes, the entire series is definitely worth owning. The writing style and emotional nature of the show is refreshing and pleasant. The DVD set from Right Stuf is well packaged, very well priced, and comes with a nice set of extras. The English dub and Japanese audio tracks are both exceptional.",1263340800,17,885,4.822368421052632
3883182,5,B0029ZUQ1M,"A fun, romantic comedy. The two main characters are both the stereotypical perfect students, except it's really a facade. The humor is how the facade is revealed and the trials and tribulations the two main characters go through after they start being themselves -- or more to the point, learning who they are.

This isn't a perfect series -- in fact, it's pretty obvious the budget was a big issue by the end of the project. And as another reviewer indicated, the quality of the DVD case could be better. But the first half of the series (especially the first two to three disks) are amazingly well done with insights into relationships, growing, and discovering who you really are coupled with comedic elements. The presentation often uses anga-like elements, giving it a unique style. And it works really well (at least until the budget runs out).

It reminds me of Fruits Basket (though His and Her came out first). Presentation wise, a lot of different Anime styles are used throughout (e.g. exaggerated ones for comedic scenes and more realistic ones for serious ones). And there are lots of tidbits of wisdom. The difference is His and Her is mainly focused on the relationship and discovering who you are while Fruits Basket is more about life in general (including relationships).

Rightstuf also did an amazing job producing the English version. There is a lot of Japanese on screen at times (the manga-like presentation elements) and Rightstuf actually spent the extra time to present the English version in the same area on the screen, using similar colors -- something that sounds easy but is actually very difficult.

The way I look at this series is to consider the really well done first half as the main feature, with the weaker second half as extra bonus material. Or to put it differently, the first half is so well done that most people will overlook the weaker second half.

It's that rare series that manages to be different and yet really good.",1257984000,11,1967,4.8076923076923075
8358809,1,B0029ZUQ1M,"I liked the story line, but could not take the back and forth on the changes and quality of the animation. 3rd Disc was a repeat of prior story in disc 1&2, then there is no clear ending to the story, so I think it is not worth the time or money.",1511568000,,246,3.75

However, I once heard the English voiceover.  The characters seemed less likeable because of the way in which they were saying things made it seem to have a different, less likeable meaning than the Japanese voices with subtitles (maybe those nuances are also in the Japanese one but I didn't catch them cause I don't speak Japanese).  Anyway a great show.  I've never watched it all the way through, but I've watched pretty far.  The beginning is very good and evokes romanticism brilliantly.",1492732800,,637,4.535087719298246
8358814,4,B0029ZUQ1M,"How to describe this anime? Well, it's a rollercoaster of emotions, in a good way. Its comedy hits just the right spots, the drama is good and poignant, the emotional scenes are handled very well and, most importantly, the romance is very believable. It's a great, unique shoujo. Unique because it is absolutely dripping with all your classic Anno-isms that most seasoned anime fans know by heart thanks to Evangelion. Some might argue it lessens the experience, but I believe the character study that Kare Kano turns into is an incredibly rewarding and enlightening experience. It's a romcom at times, but at others a very serious and deep psychological analysis of the two highschool leads. It's relatable in ways that haven't been surpassed yet in contemporary shoujo.

The really big flaw that deserves attention is the obvious hectic, unorganized production schedule behind the scenes. Most episodes begin with a big recap, there are almost two entire recap episodes, one in which the opening theme plays twice. Lots of shortcuts are taken with the animation: stills, uncolored and faceless background characters, one entire episode where the animation takes a huge dip it looks like another series altogether, another being a 23-minute long clip show, and most bizarre of all, one in which the characters are paper cut-outs on popsicle sticks. I should really take off more points for this but the drama is so good that I just can't.

So many messages can be inferred from this story, but Kare Kano, to me, is about confronting your inner demons, accepting who you really are behind the mask, and trying to live honestly with yourself.",1482105600,3,1641,5.007326007326007

Okay, the anime itself starts off good. The trouble of pretending someone you arent, then trying to change and being who you really are. The romance is cute and it can be funny too.. but where the hell is the ending? It just stopped suddenly. You don't even know what happens at the end. Its a decent anime but you don't quite get the full ending. Luckily the manga saves this part if you want to redeem yourself. All and all, its okay!",1467763200,,448,4.333333333333333

It looks like the people who where working with this series where tired and didn't care what happened to it. In about 5 different episodes they don't give you new content they just recap of what has happened over and over. Also theirs an episode where they don't even use the animation, to put it more clearly, its like they just took pictures of the manga that was based on and tried to pass it as an episode. Its not a spoiler that it doesn't have a real ending. Its more of a preview of what they where suppose to show in a new season but never got around to do one. I would have given more stars if it would have had a better ending and a better animation.
