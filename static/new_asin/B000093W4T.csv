1879167,2,B000093W4T,"Yes ladies and gentlemen- today I was tortured with TWO low budget flicks.  Not to mention another low budget movie I saw the other night, so that makes three of them in a row.

Pray was the name of the low budget film I watched the other night and it was the only decent one of the bunch.  Take in the fact I made a pointless two hour car ride to a store that was supposed to be open on Mondays but instead was surprisingly closed, and yup, today felt incredibly pointless to me.

Breakaway just stinks, plain and simple.  Another typical generic storyline about thieves stealing money.  This is one of two problems I was able to spot right away.  Such a storyline has been done a million times by now, and it's just become completely pointless.  Who cares if they're able to breakaway with the money or not?  I certainly don't care.

Heck, let the bad guys take off with the money and everyone live happily ever after.  Build a storyline around a set of people starting off as the bad guys, then using the money they steal to do something good in the world by the conclusion of the movie.

The other problem with the movie is that it's not even fun to watch.  It's not even fun to laugh at.  It tries to be serious, but the acting is definitely weak all around.  Not weak in a laughable way either- more like in a very BORING way.

This movie definitely reminds me of Die Hard, but much worse because it's just a knockoff of something done much better years ago.  Don't waste your breath with this movie.  Don't even waste your breath just thinking about it, in fact.",1268006400,,1569,4.315068493150685

1879169,3,B000093W4T,"This is a decent made for TV action movie. It takes lessons from Willis and Schwarzenegger on how to shoot enormous rounds of bullets, make lots of explosions, and kill bad guys in a number of ways. Dean Cain as the off duty suspended cop and Eric Roberts as the level headed leader of the heist team. The robbers are after a large amount of money transferred to the bank from the mall on Christmas Eve. All the actors are reasonably good at their roles. The acting is above par for most B actioners and the story is plausible and the characters lines are done well enough you don't feel abused with giving it the time to watch. For a price below ten dollars it will make a nice inexpensive gift for most men. The DVD is fair quality but does not include extras.",1199232000,,762,4.298611111111111
1879170,3,B000093W4T,"While I must admit that I love Dean Cain and miss Lois and Clark desprately, this movie was a bit unoriginal.  Think about it:

1879171,3,B000093W4T,"If you have been dying to see a ritzy mall decimated, blown up, shattered, broken, etc., then BREAKAWAY (where in the world did the title come from?) is your cup of egg nog.  A lot of noisy, really noisy, action scenes fill the screen, and being in a mall, just think of the things you get to blow up or shatter:  store windows, tvs, mannequins, mirrors, etc., etc.  And it's even better because it's on Christmas Eve in Chicago.  A man whose son is dying of leukemia wants to steal about 10 million dollars so he can get his son the 250,000 operation.  What does this kindly father plan to do with the left over money?  Open a clinic?  The movie is implausible as all heck, but it's done with such fervor and kinetic energy, you find yourself getting caught up in it, knowing how implausible it is.  Dean Cain seems to be having a good time in his Bruce Willis impersonation and Erika Eleniak is lovely to look at and is certainly improving as an actress.  Eric Roberts fills the thief's shoes nicely, but one has to ask if he will ever make a ""real"" movie ever again; he seems to get stuck in these made for tv or straight to video thrillers.  Another annoying aspect of the film is that being a tv movie, we get the commercial breaks, and the time between these segues is unusually long, even for a DVD.

I enjoyed my 90 minutes with this movie:  it has a lot of action and Cain and Eleniak are sympathetic, but the drunken Santa was a misfire, and the ending was a little too extended, aside from the fact that it tried to make us feel sorry for Eric Roberts, despite the fact that several people got killed because of his actions and we won't even mention the destruction of property.  But, heck, have a good time with it; you'll forget all about it the next morning.",1108425600,5,1772,4.317220543806647

1879173,2,B000093W4T,"Though I gave only two stars, this made-for-TV film is not as bad as you expect from that rating.  It gives always something to watch, but ... just look at this story, OK?  A Chicago cop Lt. Morgan (Dean Cane) finds himself trapped in a shopping center where a group of theives try to steal the money.  And his wife (Erika Eleniak, a girl jumping out from a giant cake in ""Under Siege"") is also trapped there; and the time is Christmas.  Does that sound familiar?  The situation is directly from one famous Bruce Willis action classic, and moreover, Morgan tries to get in touch with another cop outside the place to tell what is going on, by cell phone this time, not radio.
The hackneyed plot, however, is not to blame; actually, the film is mildly engaging.  But the lack of new touch (and money perhap) in action scenes is felt too obviuosly.  There is some original things about the film -- a hired Santa with a small bottle hidden in sleeve is one of them -- but they just pass by without being impressive nor effective.
The actors are not bad.  Dean Cane plays a guy to whom we can easily relate, but more surprising is Eric Roberts (Julia's brother, well, just in case you forget), who should be given much better materials than here.  His 'villain' betrays our expectation, showing more humane side than Allan Rickman's often thatrical mannerism.  After all, he is an Oscar-nominee, and is really a good actor.  It's just people forgot about that.  A shame.
Not bad as you may imagine, and above average as made-for-TV film, ""Breakaway"" is good for a rainy day afternoon.  Excuse me for giving rather unkind review, though, because I expect more from these two actors, who could do better.",1061856000,8,1698,4.582781456953643

7989369,4,B000093W4T,"As far as Christmas action movies go, there are very few that exist.  John Frankenheimers Reindeer Games comes to mind as one of them, but most people would like to forget that one was ever made.  Id like to review one here that is simply good entertainment--the 2002 made-for-TV movie Breakaway, starring Dean Cain, Erika Eleniak, and one of my favorite villains of all time, Eric Roberts.

The movie opens with the dramatic music of John Debney (more on that in a minute) and shows various angles of shoppers inside Chicagos busiest mall, Chicago Place.  With Roberts narration running over this, he explains to his crew of thieves that on Christmas Eve, there will be twelve million dollars in untraceable cash in Chicago Places basement vault...and they're going to take it.

Enter Cornelius Morgan (Dean Cain), a lieutenant on the Chicago P.D. who cant afford to give his wife Cat (Erika Eleniak) what she wanted for Christmas.  His attention is soon diverted to the Lotus Flower Society in Chinatown, where a group of Triad gangsters attempt to rob the club.  In the ensuing shootout, Morgan accidentally wings the head of the Lotus Flower Society, who is sort-of like the Mayor of Chinatown, and this pompous ass decides to sue the city of Chicago for forty million dollars in damages...and personally lists Morgan as a co-defendant.

With all this hanging over their heads, Morgan and Cat attend a childrens Christmas concert, which features both Morgans daughter and Jimmy Scalzettis (Eric Roberts) son.  In a brief scene after the performance, Morgan sees Scalzetti speaking to his wife about his son Anthony, who has leukemia and needs a bone marrow transplant.  The operation will cost in the upwards of millions of dollars (since ex-cons cant get insurance, something I had never thought of), which explains why Scalzetti and his crew are taking down Chicago Place.

Unfortunately, Cat works at a jewelry store at said mall, and is staying late with an indecisive customer on Christmas Eve.  Morgan, feeling that a recent fight with Cat needs to be settled before the sun goes down, buys her flowers five minutes before the mall closes...and spots Jimmy Scalzettis crew stepping through a security door.  With only a few moments to make a decision, Morgan decides to tail them back into the labyrinth behind the mall and just misses them taking a service elevator to the basement.

Morgans response to all this is a hearty Retired my ass... as he prepares himself for what is the craziest, most action-packed TV movie I have ever seen.  Breakaway has things that just aren't done on a TV movie budget, and I really wish there was some kind-of behind the scenes material available for this, because it would explain how they did the stunts and gunfire and explosions on such a limited budget and without too many stuntmen.

In the gun battle between Morgan and Petreovich, a taller-than-tall Russian thug with some kind of combat shotgun for a weapon, Morgan is running behind payphone bays (which are exploding brilliantly), the railing of the malls upper floor (which is sparking brightly), and a snowman statue (which detonates into shards of confetti and cardboard that always make me proclaim Blow up the snowman, blow up the snowman!).  All of this is filmed in John Woo-like slow motion, adding to the agonizing brutality of what Morgan is enduring not only during this gunfight, but throughout the entire film.

My dad, after watching this movie, described it as Die Hard in a shopping mall, and thats exactly what it is, because Morgan has to use all of his wits and anything available to him in order to take down Scalzettis crew and Scalzetti himself.  One of the more interesting things this film brought to light was pioneering the use of shampoo as a deterrent to your foes.  This may sound hilarious to you, but when Morgan is facing Simulus in the upscale department store, he spreads shampoo near an escalator exit.  When Simulus comes running up with guns blazing, he goes sliding through several displays and ends up shooting the head of a mannequin (another moment that made me happy; mannequins freak me out).

There are also several twists and turns in this movie that surprised me and raise it one notch above your average action film.  One thug that the movie leads you to believe is dead actually comes back to attack Morgan a second time; apparently his injury was not that serious.  Additionally, Scalzetti takes some hostages, including Morgans wife Cat, which can only ramp up the tension about ten thousand notches for our hero.

As for the acting, its about what youd expect from a TV action movie, but the absolute stand-out roles here are Erika Eleniak as Cat Morgan and Eric Roberts as Jimmy Scalzetti.  For Erika, here was a role that was not asking her to be half-naked all the time or to show her breasts (can we say Under Siege, anyone?).  She really got to show that she can act and make it be believable, and make herself be sympathetic to the audience.  Hats off to Erika for a job well done.

As for Eric Roberts, the casting couldn't have been better.  He pulls off Jimmy Scalzetti with the right amounts of wit, sarcasm, and cold-blooded criminal that I have come to expect from this very talented actor.  And while I tend to complain that he plays very one-dimensional villains, here was a villain that was two-dimensional--he wasn't taking down Chicago Place without a reason (he needs the money for his sons bone marrow transplant, remember?), and it wasn't like he hadnt tried other avenues (ex-cons cant get insurance, remember?).  This character was a desperate man with desperate means to take down an impossible score...and whether he makes it or not is up to you to find out.

The music was composed by two different musicians--the main theme was done by John Debney, which is a name I remember from other TV projects and action films.  The rest of the music was done by Louis Febre, who did an awesome job accenting the adrenaline-pumping action scenes in this film.

There is one quibble I had with Breakaway, and its that the film suffers from one-liner syndrome.  This happens with two of the lines that are repeated at least three times by different characters throughout the film.  In the first instance, Morgan says to one of the Triad gangsters, Now theres an easy way and theres a hard way.  Do the right thing.  His own partner, Rich, says it the second time.  The third time comes once again from Morgan when he has Scalzetti in his sights near the end of the film.  Now do you see what I mean by one-liner syndrome?  This is something that, oftentimes, first-time writers and directors suffer from, because they think they're being cool.  To me, it just comes off as bad writing.

The other instance of one-liner syndrome came with the line, Youre a class act, (insert character name here).  I caught that three times as well--first with Morgan, then with Rich, then with Scalzetti.  This sort-of thing happened a lot in 80s action movies too, of which I am a fan, but merely for the stunts and production design--not for the cheesy dialogue.  Something tells me this might have been an older script that was hastily updated when it was called into production, and they overlooked the one-liner syndrome that often plagued its 80s cohorts.

If you're able to put this aside, youll find a very decent Christmas action movie that doesnt scrimp on the effects and the stunts just because its a TV movie.  If you're a fan of Dean Cain, you won't be disappointed either, because he pulls off a very strong performance in this film as the cop that just won't quit.  And if you're a guy looking for some testosterone-fixin this holiday season, and you stumble on Breakaway, then lucky you--youre in for a holly-jolly good time.",1386720000,,7797,4.782089552238806
