  Being a big fan of Food Network through their variety of programs such as $40 a Day, Iron Chef and Iron Chef America to name a few, one of my favorites on the ntework is Everyday Italian hosted by Giada De Laurentiis.

  A hip cooking show which Giada shows the viewers how to cook Italian dishes and you get to learn a little bit about Italy and its food.

  With this 3-disc set, we are presented four episodes that take on three themes holidays (cocktail party, holiday dinner party, holiday side dishes and Easter celebration), Italian classics (Al fresco dining, power of pesto, Italian American  night and seafood delights) and parties (antipasti, dessert party, chocolate and birthday party).

  The video quality of the DVD was not as clear as I was expecting and was wondering if there was a bit of compression because some sections looked a bit washed out.  I found myself at times looking at the shows on my PVR comparing them to my DVD.

  But then again, I'm quite nitpicky on video quality and afterall, this is a cooking show and not a film or big budget television show.

  One of the benefits of the DVD is the added bonus footage.  Along with Giada's bio, you do get extra footage of her cooking other dishes which is a pretty cool added bonus to the DVD.

  All in all, if you love food and you love to cook it, Everyday Italian does a great job in being a hip cooking show with great Italian food, cool atmosphere and a beautiful host which makes the series that much enjoyable.",1220400000,7,1627,4.489726027397261
