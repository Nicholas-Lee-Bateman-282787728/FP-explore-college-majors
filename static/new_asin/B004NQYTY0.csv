As a teenager then, i did not know until later, and many years later, that i was in the presence of a Master! In fact, he was a ""Master"" literally, as he was the ""Hansei"" (master of the style), as he was adopted by his Japanese father (second father for him, other than biological), thus had the Crest of the Samurai Family Clan/school!! In fact, at that time, the only Caucasian in Japanese history, to head a ""school""/dojo!!! I know the stories in extreme depth, as Hansei Don (as we/I called him), was also like a father figure to me, and was very close to him.
That picture on the dvd, i can see, was taken at the old dojo in late 60's, on Long Beach Blvd, in LA. The dojo I studied with him. He was the best of the best, as many came to study with him, and learned during and after, they were very experinced in Aikido and Karate styles. So, had a chance to study with the best, beyond Hansei himself. In hindsight, it WAS a chance and experince of a lifetime!!! Even the karate world champ, after Chuck Norris, studied with our dojo students...even had a chance to spare w him too...what experince that was to, to get beat up by the best of that style too, lol.
Hansei Don's skills were legendary too. As 6'3"", i towered over him, as he was 5'7"",  and he used me and another 6 footer, in demonstrating at different venues. Was an honor to be tossed all over the place!...lessons beyond measure!! He was that good too! Amazing abilities, as a master of Jiujitsu, a master of Ken-jitsu (sword/katana), a master of the jo, bo, wakasashi, naginata, etc...ALL Japanese weapons! We used them in demos too, so saw his mastery in action, as well as felt the results...lol. He also was multiple black belt ranks in Aikido and Judo, & was a Kung-fu master too! There was no one at that time, nor since that have seen, with those credentials and mastery!!
As said, an honor of a lifetime to study his art with him, and formed the foundation of my life too! He was also a natural ""psychic"" too, and worked privately behind the scenes with the FBI, to solve missing persons and childrens cases...and had amazing results! The public never knew this! He was also the makeup man, for Bill Bixby, in the ""Hulk"" tv show, in the 70's, too. Multi talented! Again, an amazing human being he was!!!! I miss him.....",1519862400,,2421,4.356194690265487

The audio is full of a kind of background hissing due to the recording equipment of that time.  Also this was recorded during a seminar, so don't expect this to be instructional quality.
That being said, this dvd is a veritable goldmine of principle based empty hand aiki techniques.  It is said that a teacher is a bridge between the student and the material, and Soke Angier gives you explicit instruction on the nuts and bolts of the techniques using examples and self checks.  If I was giving it 5 stars based on that alone I think it would be enough, but there is more.
Don Angier is, in my humble opinion, one of the greats of the martial arts world and this video is a way to see him in his younger days in a teaching role.  Unless you were there, this is the only way for you to share in that experience.  When he is gone, this video will be a reminder of what a great educator he was.",1360195200,,1023,4.247422680412371
