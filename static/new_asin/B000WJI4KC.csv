8223570,5,B000WJI4KC,"Great bundle of Paris Roubaix races from the early 90s, especially if you remember them from the era.  But as soon as you put it in the DVD player, you will feel old!  No helmets, steel frames, down tube shifters, French riders winning races, and new-fangled suspension forks from mountain bikes (those will never take off...).  All here and nostalgic to see what ideas were cutting edge and which faded.  I was a teenager at the time and so wanted to have one of those Rock Shox on my road bike- just to look like a pro.  Alas, the road bike suspension idea faded as quickly as it came.",1353628800,,587,4.348623853211009
