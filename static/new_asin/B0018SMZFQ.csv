8270940,3,B0018SMZFQ,"The product image shows a box labeled ""Arhat Boxing"", and that is how it seemed upon arrival, with both the box art and the DVD art showing ""Arhat Boxing"". However, the contents of the DVD is indeed the Taiyi Huolong Palm as the product name says.

The demonstrations/instructions are performed by two people: Lu Zijian who is allegedly 115 years old at the time of recording. If true, I am quite impressed, given his apparent speed, strength and mobility; and a young performer. Lu Zijian is in an outdoor setting, like a field, and the young performer is shown against some cheesy fake background using a green screen.

There are complete demonstrations by both people near the beginning and end of the DVD. The routine is broken into 27 postures, and video is shown of both people for each posture. The instruction is provided by a voice-over narrator and subtitles, who describes the movements within each of the postures while a slow-mo/start-stop playback of that chunk of the young performer's entire demonstration routine is shown. It's mostly adequate, but a really poor and lazy way to instruct each posture. Instead, the young performer should have actually performed each posture at slow and normal speeds, with commentary of key points along the way. Oh well, its not going to get redone now.

The English subtitles are the typical awkwardly translated and sometimes misspelled subtitles seen in these gzbeauty DVDs; but they suffice. If this form sufficiently interests you, then these will be minor issues, as will the instructional method. One can find some snippets of this DVD on youtube, so you may want to check it out there first before committing to it.",1494374400,,1675,4.932624113475177
