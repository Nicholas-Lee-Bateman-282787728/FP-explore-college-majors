7809771,2,630107257X,"I watched CELLAR DWELLER online, in order to find out why it's never had an official DVD release. Well, after seeing it, I believe I know the answer. This movie is late 80s / early 90s cheeeze at its most pungent! The plot: a comic illustrator joins an artist colony (run by Yvonne De Carlo!), and discovers that her work calls forth a demon that kills and eats the other colonists. Now, I know that makes it sound like a masterpiece, but trust me, it ain't! First off, the demon is an overly-cute, seven foot pile of rubber. It inspires no fear, and gives hell itself a bad name. The only reasons I bumped this one up a star are 1- it contains the most idiotic, ridiculous piece of ""performance art"" ever filmed! And 2- The ending veers wildly from eye-rolling wimp-out, to downbeat, ""twist"" ending. After witnessing this, I'm surprised it made it onto VHS format. P.S.- For all Jeffery Combs addicts, he's only in the beginning for about four minutes...",1359417600,,955,4.558139534883721

7809773,3,630107257X,If you like comics or like to draw this movie may change your mind. It is a unique (a little low budget) movie about a comic book creature that comes to life and starts killing people. The Dweller himself is one of a kind. A comic horror that no movie collector should be with out.,1031356800,4,281,4.127272727272727
