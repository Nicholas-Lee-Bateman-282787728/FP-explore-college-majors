8520146,3,B007P5BMX2,A collection of 'scientists' sit around a table discussing the possibilities of the existence of a big hairy creature. With reports from around the globe and some video they ponder diet. Then it goes into weather it is from Native American tribes who send men out into the wild for their vision quest (they did not use that word) and they then become wild men. Weird. Occasional insight.,1525651200,,387,4.705882352941177
8520147,4,B007P5BMX2,"Entertaining, serious speculative documentary on the subject of Bigfoot (or Sasquatch, if you prefer).  Several scientists sit at a round table and discuss the sighting reports, evidence, and scientific possibility of said hominid.  They also examine the different possible ancestors of these crypto-creatures.  What I like is that they examine the different reports from all over the world, not just the U.S. and Canada.  I like the re-enactments (well done).  Whether one actually believes in these creatures, only believes in their possibility, or doesn't believe in any of it at all this show is very good and worth watching.  I hope it will be released to DVD soon.  Highly recommended.",1459641600,,691,5.2272727272727275
8520148,4,B007P5BMX2,"Fans of Jeff Meldrum might have noticed that there's a DVD accompanying his book, ""Sasquatch: Legend meets Science"". You might also have noticed that the DVD is pretty boring. I have the solution: watch this History Channel documentary instead, ""Bigfoot: The Definitive Guide"".

It's dominated by Meldrum, who is one of the few mainline scientists to take Bigfoot seriously. Most of the arguments will be familiar to readers of his book: Bigfoot reports go back to pre-Columbian times, there are sufficient food resources in the Pacific Northwest for a large primate to thrive, Bigfoot behaviour is compatible with ape behaviour, the Patterson-Gimlin film is authentic, and so on. The documentary is positive to other Bigfoot-type creatures, too: the Russian Almasti, the Chinese Wildman, the Himalayan Yeti, etc. Rare footage of the Bili ape (a previosuly unknown type of chimpanzee) is shown.

The last part of the program is the most speculative, claiming that Bigfoot might be a relict population of Homo heidelbergensis, the gigantic ancestor of the Neanderthals. This would explain why some Bigfoot reports describe the creature as human-like rather than ape-like. However, Meldrum doesn't like this angle, sticking to the ape theory. While sceptical arguments have been included, ""Bigfoot: The Definitive Guide"" is mostly a flesh-and-blood cryptozoology extravaganza. Perhaps too long for the hard line sceptic, but a real feast for the rest of us.

Four stars. One star off for the absurd shamanic stuff at the end.",1376265600,,1523,5.3375

In the summer of 2008, three Bigfoot sightings happened within ten miles of each other in the forest around Chilliwack Lake in British Columbia; on the night of June 18-19, a car driver and a truck driver sighted a Bigfoot in two different situations on the Bridal Falls Forest Service Road that were one mile away from each other and three-and-a-half hours apart; six weeks later and ten miles away in daylight, a two-foot rock is thrown at an experienced hunter near the Ruby Creek Forest Service Road by a fleeing black-colored being, whom the hunter said was not a bear.  Roger Patterson's 1967 Bigfoot film is featured and examined; close-up zoom views of the depicted Bigfoot's head and neck show a Homo erectus-type forehead, a slightly-projecting mouth, and a massive forwardly-angled neck that attaches high on the back of the head and projects the head downward somewhat in front of the body; because no modern human has these characteristics, the depicted being cannot be a modern human wearing a costume -- therefore, the depicted being is an unknown primate.  The documentary lacks awareness that some Bigfoot sightings indicate the presence of night vision with the eyes reflecting shined light as described in J.

Eric Shipton's 1951 photographs of supposed Yeti tracks in snow at 19,000-20,000 feet are featured, and Ian Redmond states that on a visit to Nepal that he noticed a number of food plants that were the same as those that mountain gorillas have in Africa.  Although the segment on Native American wilderness survival training is interesting from a cultural perspective, the training cannot explain the Bigfoot tracks that have been found, and the time for this segment should have featured Jeff Meldrum of Idaho State University describing the characteristics of track casts as he has done in various documentaries and in his important book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sasquatch-Legend-Meets-Science/dp/0765312174/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sasquatch: Legend Meets Science</a>.
