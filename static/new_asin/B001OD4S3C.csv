3729826,4,B001OD4S3C,"The end of the line (at least until the second movie and the January 2016 mini-series which is an unoffical 10th season for the series) for The X-Files has gotten a lot of flack from fans (along with the 8th and even the 7th) because of minimal Mulder. The show struggled during the 7th season but began to find some balance again with season 9 as we began to know our characters of Doggett and Reyes.

We got a new conspiracy story arc and there were some new and challenging stories (including one that took place in an alternate universe which should and could have provided an interesting story arc had it been pursued). I would disagree with those that indicated that the 9th season was tired

The 9th season introduced the Super Soldier plot line featuring some stellar guest stars (Lucy Lawless, Alan Dale, Cary Elwes, Terry O'Quinn) which helped to elevate even the occasional marginal episode. Interestingly, Chris Carter was going to leave around season nine and going to let others run the show but he stepped back in once he saw what Frank Spotnitz, Vince Gilligan and others had come up with for the ninth season. Returning also allowed him to return and close out the last season with a concluding episode closing off most of the plot points that had been established but not answered over the previous eight seasons.

The transfer to Blu-Ray looks extremely good. The 2K scans also feature, wherever possible, new compositing and transfers for some visual effects sequences as well.

The special features from the previous boxed set s are included here but nothing more substanial including international clips, audio commentary and various featurettes all in their original SD format (1.33:1 full screen as well).",1451433600,5,1729,4.870748299319728

8330400,5,B001OD4S3C,"Love the xfiles can't wait for season 11, I have all seasons 1-10, and the lone gunman so iam ready!",1513468800,,100,4.05
8330401,5,B001OD4S3C,"I highly recommend Season 9 (as well as 8) in which we see two new agents take center stage, Agent John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Agent Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish). Both are good actors and they bring a fresh approach to the X-Files. In a sense they are the opposites of Scully and Mulder. Mulder is the defender and supporter of the unusual and paranormal, Scully the opposite force and at times seems to be unable to deal with the concept of Alien even if a UFO landed on her head and she was to observe hours of scenes involving these aliens. In seasons 8 and 9, John is the one who does not believe anything he cannot categorize and measure with a ruler, while Monica is the one with theories and ideas that are far, far from normal and the usual. In his defense, John is a former policeman and is the type that cannot accept anything except the usual suspects, normal humans.

The story I want to describe is a powerful one, well told and for this alone I would purchase Season 9. The title is ""4D"" and is about parallel universes and the idea that there is more than one of each of us. This can be understood in greater detail by seeing the series Fringe, and I highly recommend this series to you also. It is superb.

In the story, Agents Doggett and Reyes are pursuing a serial killer who seems to be able to disappear from the crime scene with the suddenness that defies logic. The killer attacks Agent Reyes and she is dying in Agent Doggett's arms. He goes after the killer and you can see the determination in those eyes. Monica warns him he has her gun. During the chase, the killer materializes behind Doggett and shoots him in the back, near the neck. Agent Doggett ends up in the hospital with Agent Reyes by his side. He is paralyzed by the bullet wound and is not expected to ever walk again. Initially, the FBI in their infinite wisdom tries to blame Agent Reyes because it was her gun that wounded Doggett. This is maddening and seems to fit the ability of what we see with our current FBI.

What happened to Agent Reyes? She is now not hurt. The answer lies in the fact that the chase was through parallel universes and as Agent Doggett of the other universe enters ours and is shot, our Agent Doggett must go to the alternate universe since there cannot be two of us in one universe at the same time, according to the story line. This is not supported in the series Fringe, where the characters of the two universes work together to solve crimes and other adventures.

Agent Doggett cannot move, but he can move his fingers. The Doctors set up a machine to allow him to form words using his fingers. It is called a liberator and my son, Tommy, used one of these to speak with us after he had two strokes, five weeks apart, at the age of 10. These destroyed his ability to speak and to walk, though he was not paralyzed completely. He could not use his right side nor talk clearly. He makes sounds and few words at times, but mostly sounds. He does communicate with his eyes, his expressions, all it takes is time to understand and to learn what and how he communicates. I tell you this, my dear reader, because I am fully aware of how communication with some one so hurt works and how the liberator machine works and what it can and cannot do. Good communication with someone so physically challenged can be a difficult and hard problem, fraught with frustration and anguish. It requires time and patience. This story about Agent Doggett for me is a very personal one that I can fully relate to.

He tells the FBI with his liberator the identity of the shooter and how it happened. He tries to console Agent Reyes, who is stunned. She figures out how this killer does what he does from what Doggett tells her. Then the FBI sets a trap for him and the killer panics and they get him in the trap. She tells agent Doggett about the two universes and how he came to be in ours. She intuits this and is very intelligent to have deduced this.

You watch his fingers talk to her by the letters on the computer screen. She discusses with him her theories. He at first is resistant then relents to her logic and tells her that her John is on the other side and she can bring him back. He asks her to shut off the breathing machine so he can go. She refuses strongly and with emotion, as would any of us.

Later, after they caught the killer and resolved the situation, she comes to the hospital room and she locks the door. She is about to shut off the breathing machine and he watches her and you can see in his eyes fear at first, then respect for the enormous strength it has taken for her to do this. She is not doing it for herself, but for John. She does not want him to live like this, like a vegetable in bed. He smiles at her, encouraging what she needs to do for him because the internal strength to do such a thing is too much. You see she stops the breathing machine. The scene goes to his hands, his fingers.

He closes his eyes, his fingers, you clearly see, are now silent too.

She wakes up it seems, back in her new apartment, she had just moved in and John had stopped by to help her at the start of the story. She sees her things, and then she hears a voice. It is John, her John. She looks at him and tears fall and fall.

""Agent Reyes, what is wrong?"", says a shocked Agent Doggett.

She goes to him and they hug and her tears will not stop.
This my dear reader is a powerful story, well told. I would recommend Season 9 for just this story alone.
