8602144,5,B00E6PUYKG,"After seeing this movie in November, I bought my own copy and have watched it twice since.
It is cleverly funny. All the young actors are excellent, especially  the two leads.  This is the kind of romance you can enjoy multiple times. Its effect does not depend on surprise,  but rather on the chemistry between the two two lead actors. It's a modern day
Shakespearean comedy,  complete with a comedic chorus of oddball friends and enjoyable twists and turns.  Watch this movie  -- you won't  be disappointed!",1390435200,,509,4.781609195402299
8602145,5,B00E6PUYKG,Very funny!!  First saw this at Michael Moore's Film Festival in Traverse City.  Loved it!  And so did the rest of the fest--it won an award for best new director.  Must see!!!,1385769600,,176,4.40625

8602147,5,B00E6PUYKG,"I first saw this movie at the Austin Film Festival and was looking forward to a DVD release so I could watch it again. Funny, original, it shows how an independent film with no big movie stars can be much more entertaining than a film from a major studio. Great writing, good comedic performances.

Definitely not a family movie but, well, what do you expect from a movie with the word ""sex"" in the title.

I hope more people see it. It deserves an audience.",1382659200,,458,4.376470588235295
8602148,5,B00E6PUYKG,Saw this film at the Traverse City Film Festival in 2012.  It was a hit at the festival and on my Top 10 all time fav list!,1382400000,2,123,3.5555555555555554
8602149,5,B00E6PUYKG,"This movie is just fun. I've watched it a couple of times and still end up laughing out loud at some of my favorite lines. ""The night is still young."" In context, that line is hilarious and unexpected. All new actors, although I'm seeing the lead guy, Kenny Stevenson, in TV commercials lately. I get the feeling he's going to have a decent career. Anyway, it's a nice movie to watch with friends or on a date or whatever. Not a family movie though.",1382400000,2,449,4.357142857142857
8602150,5,B00E6PUYKG,"There are no big budget actors or special effects, but this is a truly funny movie. I was lucky enough to catch this at a film festival last year and waited for an official release. All movie goers were howling with laughter during the movie and couldn't wait to vote it to the top of the festival. One weak point for me was the female lead not always being plausible, overacting at times. But she recovers at times too, and the premise, ridiculously funny group of friends, and amazingly well-crafted lines make this a real 5 star movie for me.

BTW, would be nice if this came out in blu-ray.",1380585600,2,594,4.4
8602151,5,B00E6PUYKG,"Thoroughly enjoyed this film.  It was charming, funny and smart.  Well acted by the large ensemble of actors.  Well done!",1380499200,2,121,4.95
