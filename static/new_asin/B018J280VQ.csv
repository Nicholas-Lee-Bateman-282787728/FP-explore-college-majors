7553435,5,B018J280VQ,"Updated on 8-5-2017. This season is worth purchasing to just sit back and watch the master Kim (khaleesi) Spradlin in action. I just finished the entire season and had no issues with the Blu-ray discs. I watched every episode, every secret scene, every ponderosa video and all exit and day after videos. Smooth as silk, no issues at all.  I played the discs in my Oppo Blu-ray player. I also put one disc in my PS4 Pro to check it out and it worked fine. I bought the Philippines season on Blu-ray as well and no issues so far (I'm on disc 2). The picture is very crisp and clean. The season is in 1080i as broadcast but looks great. Each episode has an optional secret scene. Special features include: Tribal council voting, extended exit interviews, day after videos and all ponderosa videos. The Blu-ray seasons are a little expensive but I highly recommend if you are a Survivor fanatic as I am. Season 26-31 are up for pre-order on Blu-ray as well as seasons 22 & 23. Gabon was the first season shot in HD so I'm hoping they go back and put seasons 17-21 on Blu-ray.",1450828800,2,1071,4.409090909090909
7553436,3,B018J280VQ,"Survivor has delivered viewers many great seasons, but this ain't one of them.  In fact, in my opinion (and I've watched every season multiple times) this is the worst season ever made.  I'm still buying the discs though because even a bad season of Survivor is good viewing to fans of the show.  If you can't afford to buy every season or you are buying this for a gift, then give this one a miss - it's a boring cast, predictable winner and pretty much no awesome characters or situations that have you hanging on the edge of your seat.",1450310400,5,538,4.36
7553437,5,B018J280VQ,"Pretty good season. They defiantly need to do the one world twist again in another season sometime in the future. Also one of the best winners survivor has had. I wouldn't have made this a boys vs girls season because that almost never works save for S6 amazon

Update: I'm on disc 2 and all the episodes play great! Only downside is that all of the secret scenes/special features only play audio.(The problem is flipped for the dvds of redemption island and south pacific) I'm still happy because I purchased this specifically for the TV episodes, what does bother me is that they false advertise saying you get all of these extra features with the only caveat being there's no picture. Better to make these mistakes now before they release the good seasons comming up. Side note to cbs/amazon, please test your product on multiple disc players before mass production and shipment of said product.",1449446400,3,898,4.7935483870967746
7553438,2,B018J280VQ,"One of the worst seasons in the show's history, I can only recommend this set to die-hard fans and completionists. A boring and obvious outcome, a lack of interesting characters, and arguably the single most vile person ever grace the show get this one a thumbs down from this Survivor die-hard.",1449273600,7,295,4.803921568627451
