The stories are based on Sir A. Conan Doyles famous short stories and faithfully adapted to film. Jeremy Brett plays Sherlock Holmes and Edward Hardwicke plays Dr. John H. Watson.

The Second Stain.
Two high government officials visit Holmes on an important matter, a missing official document. Mr. Trelawney Hope explains its importance. Who else knew about it? Its publication could mean war! [Note their restrained language.] Mrs. Hope arrives later. A foreign agent was found murdered! A coincidence? Why is this letter held bak? Holmes and Watson visit the murder scene to see a stained rug. Who shifted it? Constable MacPherson explains. Holmes and Watson visit Mrs. Hope for a talk. She tells what happened! Later Mr. Hope finds the letter in his dispatch box! How did this happen? We too have our diplomatic secrets says Holmes. [Was this Doyles comment on the personal lives of the aristocracy?]",1403827200,,933,5.0519480519480515
7813577,4,630161173X,"I would have a hard time saying that this is one of the best in the series.  There is very little suspense, Watson's role is smaller than usual, and I'm not sure the story holds up.
Still, this episode does have several features to recommend it. First, the comical Inspector Lestrade is at his best.  Second, Brett's facial expressions are masterful. In fact, this may be his best performance. Third, the story is both deadly serious (consider that Conan Doyle wrote this 15 years before WWI) and hilarious, with Holmes' sexism and carelessness with matches providing good laughs.
In my opinion, The Hound is still the best in the series, but you really can't go wrong with any of them.",1007078400,,686,4.708333333333333
7813578,5,630161173X,"One of the top entries in this series, and Brett continues to imbue his already flawless Holmes with still more interesting facets.  A stolen letter, from a foreign hot-head, disappears from a government officials's  dispatch box.  Both the hapless official AND the Prime Minister (Harry  Andrews in an impeccable performance) are terrified:  it means war should  the contents become public.  Holmes realizes that too much time has elapsed  for the letter to remain secret, so ""prepare for war,"" he  advises.  A following visit from the official's furtive wife intrigues  Holmes and Watson further, but they will not compromise the British  government for the sake of a woman's wiles -- and still the contents don't  surface and so there just might be a chance.  A well timed murder becomes  the catalyst, and so -- the adventure begins.  Grenada has never been in  finer form than with this terrific Victorian mystery.  The cast plays with  seasoned perfection (Colin Jeavons joins in again expertly as the  waste-of-time Inspector Lestrade) and the results are wonderful! Edward  Hardwicke remains as comfortable as a favorite slipper in playing Watson,  and Brett's iconoclastic detective is just a joy to watch (his dismissive  -- and dangerous -- match-tossing, scrambling and snorting on the Lucas  parlor floor, etc.)!  Listen to Patrick Gowers beautiful musical motif for  Lord Bellinger and just enjoy this excellent and all too brief visit back  in time to the Victorian wonderland of Sherlock Holmes.",939772800,14,1511,5.2133891213389125
