It is also about a post-colonial evolving need to restructure and grow more politically conscious of Argentina's potential. The Peron era was only one historical part of its ongoing development and of course with development also comes a clash of ideas, support as well as opposition to political reforms.",1480204800,,413,5.2727272727272725
