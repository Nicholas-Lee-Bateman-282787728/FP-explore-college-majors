8397007,5,B003HD8F0Y,"A greatly insightful film into the Cuban health care system and their influence in the systems of developing countries. Excellent subject matter for those with an interest on what the rest of the world is doing in terms of public health, and how the efforts of a tiny country called Cuba can change the path of health care worldwide!",1330128000,,333,4.661016949152542
8397008,5,B003HD8F0Y,"This amazing video depicts the humanitarianism of Cuban physicians and their global impact.  These doctors not only work within their own communities as true physicians, but they also travel to the poorest and most remote areas in other countries to assist with medical care.  They often go into areas where the local doctors will not go.  They perform services with patients that the local doctors will not support.  Is this not the true calling of a physician?  Don't you wish we had physicians like this in our country?  OH...AND...this is all supported by the Cuban government.  Socialized medicine at its finest!!

As well, they are now providing scholarship opportunities to students in other countries to come learn at the medical school they have established.  The only caveat is that the student has to agree to go back to an under served community to work upon completion of their training.  This includes US students!!

We can all see that privatized medicine is not working.  Health care as a privilege rather than a right doesn't cut it.  Maybe it is time to try something different...???",1296086400,,1101,4.950819672131147
