2065121,5,B00027JYEO,"My son (4.5 yr) really love Real Wheel series. I already have some of the series in tape. But my love them so much, we decide to buy the whole set in DVD. After receive the DVD, my still watch at least 3 times of each vedio. Highly recommend if you have a boy from 3 to 5 yr old.",1189555200,,279,3.6666666666666665
2065122,1,B00027JYEO,I bought 4 dvd's from the real wheels collection and was very disappointed.  Lots of commentary and very little shots of things in action.  Did not keep the attention of my preschooler--or the adults watching with him.,1172361600,,218,4.864864864864865
2065123,4,B00027JYEO,"My son really likes the ""Dave Series"".  It's very informative and funny for my 4 year old.  The only thing I didn't care for about this series is that Dave seems to get angry (in a funny way) a little too much.  My son has commented about Dave hitting Becky.",1162771200,3,258,4.12
2065124,5,B00027JYEO,"My 3 year old son loves the entire series of these adventure videos!!  He asks to see them again and again!!  Sometimes the same video two or three times in one sitting!!!  Dave is a great host for the videos and he speaks to the kids in a friendly easy to understand way!!  Highly, highly recommended!!",1141862400,,303,4.357142857142857
2065125,5,B00027JYEO,"My little girl is infatuated with race cars.  While you can blame it on Van Diesel, this film is a much healthier choice for children with appetites for the fast and the furious!  In the words of my nine year old, ""it teaches the basics of what makes racing cars different from street cars and Dave is so funny while telling us how to be safe and follow directions.""",1099353600,8,366,4.2898550724637685
2065126,5,B00027JYEO,"What can I say this is for kids and they love it this isn't for adults, the first time watched was great, I now take my book with me if my boys want to watch....",1367280000,,161,3.6285714285714286
2065127,5,B00027JYEO,"My 3 year old son LOVES Dave & Becky - we have all their videos and we can't say enough.  Great videos.  Goofy but educational and perfect for younger viewers.  Completely age appropriate and fun for the kids to watch.  He loves all of them!  In this video Dave & Becky are race car drivers, go to NASA to the space training center and then go on a motorcycle trip.  Lots of fun.",1361491200,,379,4.123287671232877
2065128,3,B00027JYEO,"It's a bit corny with the narration by Dave, but my son (3 y/o) just loves it.  He enjoys the entire Real Wheels series.",1356998400,,120,4.0
2065129,5,B00027JYEO,"We had VHS copies of these old Dave and Becky ""There Goes A ..."" videos. Our children watched them over and over. It was so good to find them re-cut on DVD, and for quite reasonable prices. Now the grandchildren can enjoy them as their parents did.",1351728000,,248,4.297872340425532
2065130,4,B00027JYEO,"We bought this after we borrowed one of them from the library and our oldest son loved it. Unfortunately, our kids have watched it maybe 3 times now and lose interest after 10 minutes; they don't ask for it. I think it's a fun and educational way to teach kids about these things, so my husband and I are bummed that they're not excited about it. Yes, Dave is kinda cheesy, but the younger kids (toddlers, preschoolers) should enjoy it. I think they'd be more into it if we had started them at age 2. My 4 and 5-year old childcare girls always ask for it, though. I guess every kid is different. Still, I think the DVD is the perfect blend of humor, excitement, and information for kids, so I'm giving it 4 stars. The price is reasonable, so you could buy 1 DVD and see what your kids think of it. Our kids actually enjoy the ""There Goes a Bulldozer"" and ""Rescue Adventures"" DVDs, if that's any help.",1308787200,,900,4.3
2065131,4,B00027JYEO,"My 2 yo son is obsessed with space shuttles so I got this DVD for him.  He can watch it over and over and over again.  I like that he's entertained but the videos are kind of cheesy.  The acting is really bad and when people screw up their lines it's definitely not edited out.  Still, that's kind of charming.  The only thing I don't like is how Dave has to be this stereotypical male all of the time.  I feel like I'm watching Home Improvement sometimes.",1288569600,,456,4.183908045977011
2065132,5,B00027JYEO,"My 13- and 10-year-old practically wore out our ""Dave & Becky"" VHS tapes when they were little. I have been searching for these on DVD for our 3-year-old. I am so thrilled to have found them! The ""There Goes a..."" series is very informative, has a little slapstick humor from Dave Hood, and doesn't talk down to kids. ""There Goes a Motorcycle"" was the family favorite years ago, and we'll see what becomes the newest favorite.",1242864000,,426,4.618421052631579
2065133,4,B00027JYEO,"My Four year old son loves this DVD. It is comical and entertaining while presented in an ""informative format""...Like a documentary for kids! Well priced and super fast shipping makes it an A+. Will definitely order the other DVD's from this set.",1220140800,,246,4.880952380952381

8023176,5,B00027JYEO,"Although we didn't let my 18 month old son watch tv, he saw this at his Aunt's house and was OBSESSED. Everyday he would wake up asking for ""Dave"". The 1980s costumes and hair are hilarious and the dialogue is...at best...bad. But the kid loved it! Its actually educational though so that's a plus.",1419033600,,298,4.537037037037037
