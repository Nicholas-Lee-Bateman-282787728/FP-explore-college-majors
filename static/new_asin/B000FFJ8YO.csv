2562549,5,B000FFJ8YO,"This is not a movie full of special effects, big action or big name actors.  It is a very low key movie and in one or two places, it seems a little too ""low budget"".  But over all, it is just a solid, feel-good story.  I had seen it one time many years ago and when I ran across it on-line I had to buy it.  The story has fantasy, drama, action and teen romance that is fit for the whole family to watch.  In fact, it has some great life lessons for teens and adults alike.  For me, it has the character of a hallmark classic and I will be enjoying it for the rest of my life.",1356307200,2,576,3.7983193277310923
2562550,3,B000FFJ8YO,"The lesson in this movie that stands out in my mind is when the girl that Greg likes talks to him about the need for them to forgive their fathers, who both are in prison, for their activities that disgraced the family.  However, there are two elements to this.  I agree that complete forgiveness is in order if the father shows remorse for his crime.  What if he doesn't?  Or, even worse, what if he can hardly wait to get out of prison so he can seek revenge on those who put him there, or to commit more crimes?  This should provide good family discussion of various aspects of forgiveness.

The main theme of the movie, however, is the need to set a goal and then let nothing (honorable) get in the way of achieving it.  In athletics this includes intensive training.  However, it also includes mentally focusing on the goal until it becomes such a drive it is an automatic response when the challenge is presented.  The message is there, but not particularly smoothly delivered.  Parents should discuss with their children the necessity of training or study to achieve a goal, as well as the need to psychologically 'program' themselves to accomplish that goal.

I wish I could give this movie a higher rating, but, as is typical for many of these Feature Films for Families movies, I don't think the story was told particularly well.  Also, I think it would have been much better if Greg's mentor was a real Native American sports hero and not some 'spirit' of Jim Thorpe. The lessons given in this movie are very good, but they feel somewhat disjointed.",1169424000,6,1560,4.592057761732852
2562551,4,B000FFJ8YO,"Even for non-family audience, good spirit-lifting story, beautiful and contemplative cinematography.  Talented cast and production showcase mental and  surreal realizations and scenes.  Especially attractive for those that  enjoy Native American theme, stark but beautiful western land, and gorgeous  horse footage.",961545600,10,315,6.775
2562552,5,B000FFJ8YO,"A ""fantastic family film"" with a lesson on life, How at times, it is more important to be mentally prepared than physicaly. Wish they would Re-release it, Would buy it in a heartbeat. If you have children  between the ages of 5-14 they  would love this show!",951436800,5,258,4.468085106382978

8121645,5,B000FFJ8YO,If your a fan of movies that show the struggle and hardwork of a player both physically and mentally this movie has a great storyline.  Older style way b4 dvd/blueray. I have the vhs tape of it but it got damaged.  Was happy to find it online.  The ending I see was slightly changed but not to the point from the orginal where you notice. Its worth the watch.,1461024000,,359,4.173913043478261

8121649,4,B000FFJ8YO,"A truly good film for young adults 10-16 years of age. The ""Ghost"" of the great Native American athlete Jim Thorpe is on earth and living in the high desert of Kanab, Utah. There he befriends our young hero and takes him under his wing (pardon the pun) and shows him the ""ways"" of life.",1433980800,,286,4.218181818181818
8121650,3,B000FFJ8YO,"The title pretty much says it all.

The concept behind the movie is fine, and in a day and age where there is so much sex and violence promoted in Hollywood's films, at least this is a movie that the entire family can see.  Some may actually enjoy it, since the movie is filmed in Utah and there's much scenic beauty to be found there.

However,  with the exception of the charming Amanda Peterson, whose acting has always been superb, regardless of what she's appeared in, both the plot of this movie as well as the acting by most of its cast is at best mediocre.

Moreover, if you are an Amanda Peterson fan (""Can't Buy Me Love"" ""Listen To Me"" & ""A Year In The Life"") ""Windrunner""  would also turn out to be the last movie (or TV appearance) that she would ever make in Hollywood, after having had a fairly successful acting career as a child star, and co-starring
 in the 1987 sleeper hit of the year entitled ""Can't Buy Me Love.""

Why Amanda's acting career did not skyrocket after ""Can't Buy Me Love""  became the overnight sensation that it did remains a mystery to her myriad fans; many of whom have not only lamented about the loss of this  tremendous talent, but since her sudden departure from Hollywood 27 years ago,  created Websites and YouTube videos as an homage to what they believe was one of the most beautiful and talented actresses ever to grace the silver screen.

As a long time fan of Amanda's, myself, I would imagine that their frustration stems from the fact that even though her career was in high gear and her popularity off the charts by the end of 1987,  by 1989 the momentum that she'd had going for her in 1987 had largely fizzled out.

The speculation for why this occurred remains rampant nearly three decades later, and to this very day the reason for it continues to be a mystery,  since it is very difficult to understand why someone with  Amanda's enormous talent and beauty, did not eventually become the A-List Hollywood star that so many her fans thought she would.

In fact, both she and her co-star, Patrick Dempsey, became overnight teen idols as the direct result of Can't Buy Me Love's success at the box office; their faces being seen on the covers of teen magazines all over the world for several years afterwards.

However, even Patrick, although he'd met with more success than Amanda after ""Can't Buy Me Love"" would experience a decade of frustration in being repeatedly turned down for some of the more choice roles that he had auditioned for during his thirties,  and would have to wait for another decade before his dry spell would end, when he would finally snag the  lead character in a new series entitled: Grey's Anatomy.

As for ""Windrunner,"" this movie would end up going directly to DVD.

However, this could have been a great movie if the producers had been given  a better budget and with the exception of Amanda Peterson and Margot Kidder, access to  better known actors; since the movie appears to have emulated the 1984 summer blockbuster ""The Karate Kid,"" except without that movie's tremendous box office success.

Of course, movies are always subjective, so what appeals to one movie goer, may or may not appeal to another.

However, in this writer's opinion, if you want to see an enjoyable movie which has a similar theme, you'll likely find that the original Karate Kid (1984) will suffice, since it's the type of ""feel good"" movie that not only attracts large numbers of fans, but which has also become a cult classic  thirty years after it was produced.

Movies like ""Can't Buy Me Love"" (1987) and ""Risky Business"" (1983) have also become iconic, thanks to their quality scripts and the chemistry between their co-stars (Amanda Peterson and Patrick Dempsey in CBML) and (Tom Cruise and Rebecca DeMornay in RB).

This is especially true when they are compared to many of the high tech CGI animated action movies which appear in the modern day, where the scripts and the actors take a backseat to the movies' CGI special effects.

As such,  the saying the more things change the more they stay the same no longer applies in Hollywood, since the more things change in Tinsel Town, the worse they seem to get.",1403827200,,4178,4.635869565217392
