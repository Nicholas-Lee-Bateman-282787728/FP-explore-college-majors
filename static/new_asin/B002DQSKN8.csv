3912379,5,B002DQSKN8,"Michael Dudikoff is one of those fun action heroes who's always been there. This show gave him the oppurtunity to be funny,emotional and tough. Great cast and fun storylines that still play well today. My kids love it.",1204934400,,218,4.7631578947368425
3912380,4,B002DQSKN8,Other reviewers mentioned that there are a few little blips in quality -- due to source material.  Definitely a nice addition to DVD collection and price was in line with quality.  It was great to see all the episodes again and if a fan of the show I would recommend buying.,1203897600,,274,4.352941176470588
3912381,1,B002DQSKN8,"no extras, you can see where the commercials were shown during the episodes, bad picture, hardly better than on tv, no new sound. an exchange-item, if the series itself would not be exciting.",1201219200,,191,4.818181818181818
3912382,4,B002DQSKN8,"Where to begin Michael the American Ninja Dudikoff. Any one who was fan of Ninja series in the 80's loved this show. Excellent show well written and performed 15 out of 22 episodes. Canceling this show was a big mistake. I recommend it to anyone trying to recapture the good'ol 90's or just Ninja fans. The creators of the show would go on and do The Pretender on NBC. Granted some episode are a little corny, but hey it was the 90's popcorn era, still better than CSI, Law & Order any day of the week. Great fight scenes, cool car, funny at times. What was up with James Tolkan ties?!!! Great to add with any 90's nostalgia DVD collecton.",1199664000,2,639,4.333333333333333
3912383,5,B002DQSKN8,"This show is entertaining, funny, and great.  Michael Dudikoff is always a joy to watch and his fight scenes are always great.  Cobra is one of the memories from years ago that I have been looking for for a long time.",1179964800,,217,4.2682926829268295
3912384,3,B002DQSKN8,"Cobra is kinda interesting, the Pilot (Part 1 and 2) stand for itself but the Episodes...well I do not know. They used to much footage from Stingray (80s TV Series) and did not realy come up with the Action it says on the box. It is sometimes boring. I love the pilot...but that is it.",1398124800,,285,4.2
3912385,5,B002DQSKN8,A great series for anyone who like Michael Dudikoff. About an organization that helps people who can't get help from the police. I like the story lines & the action. Another Stephen J. Cannell series.,1396656000,,200,4.742857142857143
3912386,5,B002DQSKN8,"This was a gift for my nephew for Christmas.  I had never heard of this short-lived TV show, but I do like Michael Dudikof and my nephew enjoyed it a lot!",1391385600,,154,3.967741935483871
3912387,5,B002DQSKN8,i cannot believe i missed this show when it was on. it is great. written by stephen j. cannell where can you go wrong? i am a big fan of michael dudikoff and he does not dissappoint  in this show.,1380931200,,196,3.9
3912388,4,B002DQSKN8,"This was a well done series with interesting characters and a well written script but as I worked my through the episodes I became increasingly uncomfortable.  Since the series was set in western Canada the sky was often overcast which seemed to weight down the script.  The female lead was attractive but she often seemed over dressed to me.  But what I really found  offensive was the Dallas character which always had a cigar in his mouth or hand.  This was the 1990's and by then the hazards of second hand smoke were well known and smoking restrictions were in force.  So you have to wonder why this guy felt he could smoke in other people's presence any time he wished.  And didn't he care about his own health?  Finally, speaking as someone who restores old cars, every time they needed to go somewhere in their beautiful Cobra auto; they just started it and floored the accelerator, never bothering to warm it up even for 10 seconds--very bad for the engine.

But if none of the bothers you, you should enjoy the series.",1370476800,,1028,4.573770491803279
3912389,5,B002DQSKN8,"Simply the best of the '90s from Dudikoff. The last time i wached these series was in 1995 from Italia 1, I liked them most.",1360713600,,124,4.0
3912390,4,B002DQSKN8,"I really liked this show and feel it had the potential to go more than one season. The one-star ding is for the lousy packaging, I had to replace the original case with one able to hold four disks on separate spindles. No biggie, but if I can afford these cases so could the manufacturers.

Quoth the Raven...",1357948800,,309,4.327586206896552
3912391,4,B002DQSKN8,I really like this series I have been a fan of  Michael  Dudikoff  since the American Ninja series  and I've been a Navy Seal sense  under siege 1 and 2.  but very cool TV series.,1357084800,,179,3.9714285714285715
3912392,5,B002DQSKN8,I had this one in a VHS version and it is fantastic in a DVD version. I would recomment it to others.,1354406400,,101,3.6363636363636362
3912393,5,B002DQSKN8,"I purchased this series from a seller on amazon.com and I have to say this is a series that should have lasted longer than one season. Don't let the fact it lasted only one season fool you. This is a well- cast, well- acted and well- written series. It actually tells a decent story and that is not as easy to find today as it used to be. I highly recommend this series to anyone who likes action/ adventure.",1351987200,,408,4.177215189873418
3912394,4,B002DQSKN8,"Far superior to the similarly snake-named Viper show, this one actually reminds me quite a bit of Knight Rider, but without the talking car. Stephen J. Cannell probably should have gotten this one out when Knight Rider was on as these kinds of espionage and intrigue shows seemed to have run their course by the time that this one arrived. Unlike Knight Rider, the characters, although similar in layout are more developed as are the storylines and the way that they play out. Michael Dudikoff is believably physical and emotive while James Tolkan and Allison Hossack lend themselves quite well as the supporting cast. There are not any real letdowns, but again Dudikoff's character goes through a transformation not unlike Hasselhoff's Michael Knight in Knight Rider and similarly, a shadowy organization supports him in his battle against crime. Where Dudikoff falters is that he does not exude the same kind of charisma as Hasselhoff, but it is more exciting to watch him be physical during his own show. Overall, not a bad series and it stands on it own fairly well, but it is the last of a then dying genre and it fells like such. If you are into these kind of shows, you should enjoy it anyway.",1332979200,2,1200,4.746411483253588
3912395,4,B002DQSKN8,"great item. great series....great seller
heard about this series before but never watched it. now I own this on dvds which i enjoy.",1322438400,,131,4.739130434782608
3912396,5,B002DQSKN8,Let's me remeber the past shows of the 80's it was a different time.........You need to buy and you will like it for sure,1313539200,,121,4.083333333333333
3912397,3,B002DQSKN8,"MICHAEL DUDIKOFF IS PRETTY DECENT IN THIS SERIES. THE SERIES SHOULD HAVE MADE IT, HOWEVER, NETWORKS WERE PROBABLY GETTING SICK OF CANNELL'S SHOWS.",1297555200,,146,5.391304347826087
3912398,4,B002DQSKN8,"I remember this show back when it was on in the mid 90s and loved the show then. I was a huge Dudikoff fan and just love the car.  It doesn't take itself seriously either.  I have enjoyed watching the show again as I don't recall any of it and even though it can be cheesy at times, especially the old nintendo soundtrack, it is still fun to watch. I am almost done watching it again and have begun though to notice some of the same driving footage repeated in episodes but think a lot of shows similar would have the same problem. I would recommend though for some cheesy entertainment plus can't beat the price.",1296432000,4,613,4.275862068965517
3912399,4,B002DQSKN8,"I watched this in its original run back in the early 90s and I think I may have taken it far too seriously back then. It's not a great show, but it's not bad, either. Adoring Allison J. Hossack in her role as Danielle wasn't hard to do then and it's certainly not any more difficult now. For me, she's the highlight of the entire program. James Tolkan is perfect as Dallas and Michael Dudikoff...where to start? He's got a beautiful smile and some of the best hair going. Seriously, I mean that.

A few things I've noticed this time around: 1) Did COBRA have some sort of color dress code? This holds true more for Danielle than the other two; she seemed to have four colors in her Dressbarn wardrobe: red, white, black, and blue. At least Scandal threw in a little green from time to time and Dallas, well, he had those obnoxious ties. 2) What was with all the PURPLE in the episode called Haunted Lives? Really, watch it and tell me if you don't notice it. 3) The sheer amount of repeated footage staggers the mind. I'm not just talking about location shots of Avery Tower, either. Action shots are reused within episodes and from episode to episode.

Standout episodes include Lorrinda (LOL-worthy; Alice Ghostley is wonderful); Something in the Air (more for the personal interaction b/t Scandal and Dani than anything); Lost in Cyberspace (because it's so ridiculous and unintentionally hilarious); Precious (ROCKY TINDERBROOK and Dani in her black dress-naturally); and though I haven't rewatched it just yet, Honeymoon Hideaway (because I remember really liking it the first time I watched it and thought Dani and Scandal would have made a great couple).

I bought the set used and think what I paid was a fair price (including shipping, it was under $10). The DVDs themselves have no extras, but I've come to expect that from Mill Creek. I'm just thrilled the show's available on DVD now. I'm not sure I could find the old VHS tapes I have, even if it had crossed my mind to revisit the television of my early 20s.",1293580800,5,2022,4.626740947075209
3912400,5,B002DQSKN8,"This series is about a crime fighting organization called COBRA founded by the father of Danielle LaPoint, the lady portrayed by Allison Hossack.  Michael Dudikoff (""Scandal"" Jackson) stars as an ex-navy SEAL, and James Tolkan (Dallas Cassel) stars as Head of Cobra (an ex-FBI agent).  I got hooked on this series from the beginning.  Unfortunately it didn't last long.  Casting was absolutely perfect--especially James Tolkan as the head of Cobra and Michael Dudikoff.  The writing was absolutely super, all was absolutely great--fabulous & mesmerising episodes.  The only thing wrong was the audience that didn't appreciate this series.

There was humor, there was wisdom, there was intensity, mystery, action, suspense--everything--PLUS an AWESOME car, cute guy & pretty girl--I have no idea what cheesy dialogue some people are talking about--this series has great humor, wisdom and everything else that goes with a great series--there is no crudity, nothing that your teenager could not watch.  It is great writing, great television, and as I said, the only thing that didn't work was the audience unable to appreciate a work of television art.

This series is intense & mysterious without crudity as many of the popular shows today--it's decent--perfect for anyone.

Perfect for a gift to just about anyone, especially to oneself--this purchase and gift to me coming soon.  I remember being enthusiastic about this series, but I had to check it out from a library loan first because I didn't remember all the episodes.  I am thrilled with this series all over again.",1290124800,24,1572,5.244
3912401,1,B002DQSKN8,"Ok, I have given this title 1 star, not because it is not good, I know that it is, in fact it is a great series - the thing is that after buying the item from Amazon, I cannot actually play it because, contrary to Amazon's claims that the discs are playable in All Regions, I was very disappointed to find that they are coded Region 1. I have sent a complaint to Amazon and await to hear what they have to say for themselves.

I am writing this review so that anyone who does not have a region 1 or multi-region player like me, will not make the mistake of buying this title - if you do, don't say you were not warned !!!",1287705600,3,621,3.968

3912404,1,B002DQSKN8,"i used to watch this show back in the '90s
i don't know why, i can't say it's a complete
ripp-off of Stingray because it was also created
by Stephen j cannel , but it seemed like a lazy attempt
to sort of revive the Stingray series by namaing the
show after a different car and using stock footage
from that series in the intro.",1276128000,4,328,4.061538461538461
3912405,1,B002DQSKN8,It appears these people never saw the Stingray series in the 80s That's where most of the vehicles were taken from. I also noticed Nick Mancuso Driving the vehicles the editing is really lousy especially some scenes are blurred to try to make the footage from Stingray look new. Also there was a helicopter explosion taken from wiseguy as well. If they are going to make a series use real vehicles not recycled footage from old shows.,1268611200,6,434,4.64935064935065
3912406,5,B002DQSKN8,"I really love this series, I am surprised that I did not ever hear of it until I found it on Amazon. My wife and I will sit up late sometimes and watch an episode. To date we have watched about 1/2 of them. I think the car is a beauty all by itself. Some of the dialog is a little corny but I think it adds to the entertainment.",1266710400,12,328,3.7
3912407,5,B002DQSKN8,Loved this series when it came out and was very saddened when it got cancelled.  It can be cheesy but if you like Michael D you will enjoy the show.,1265500800,12,148,3.933333333333333

3912410,4,B002DQSKN8,"1980's B-action movie superstar Michael Dudikoff tears up the streets and the screen in Stephen J. Cannell's 1993 television series ""COBRA"". Former Navy seal and skilled martial arts expert Robert ""Scandal"" Jackson has been given a new face and an opportunity to become the leader of an elite undercover crime fighting agency named ""Cobra"". The agency is designed to help people who need assistance from outsiders to help them deal with the injustice's they face. As leader of the agency ""Scandal' is given everything he needs to get the job done and help those who cannot help themselves, even if it means going outside the law. He is assisted by other ""COBRA"" members Danielle LaPointe and Dallas Cassel. If you're a fan of Michael Dudikoff or the American Ninja movies than ""Cobra"" may be for you.

For the first time all 22 thrilling episodes of ""Cobra"" are available on DVD. This five single sided disc set from Vei has its hits and misses regarding the quality. While you do get all 22 episodes spread out over five discs there is some pixilation in some of the episodes and you can definitely tell where the commercials would have been inserted. The video and sound quality is pretty decent with some noticeable amounts of grain in some of the episodes and some fluctuation in sound here and there. My only real complaint is that the discs sit on top of one another in the case and they're hard to take out. You do run the risk of scratching them if there not already scratched when you get them. The disc menus and disc artwork are well done. I don't believe any restoration went into these episodes for this DVD release but in my opinion the quality is still really decent and Dudikoff fans should enjoy this set.

The Cast:
Michael Dudikoff......Robert ""Scandal"" Jackson
Allison Hossack.......Danielle LaPointe
James Tolkan..........Dallas Cassel

3912411,4,B002DQSKN8,"A fun but ridiculous action show starring Michael Dudikoff that aired in syndication for one season from 1993-94. Each disc has the episode titles listed on the front, and when you click on the episode you want to watch, up comes a description of the episode and some trvia, as well. Nice. The quality of each episode is solid.

My only complaint is that the discs are packaged with one disc kind of sitting on the other. They're not the easiest to get out and I'm a little concerned about damaging them. But that's minor, because if you're a Dudikoff fan like me, you'll love having this set. Definitely worth the money.",1226361600,,621,4.544642857142857
3912412,5,B002DQSKN8,"ok well not all 90's TV series rule there were some crappy ones. personally though, i always enjoyed Cobra. (not hard to enjoy when you grew up watching American Ninja)
there are a few episodes that stand out
The pilot has a great moment when Scandal Jackson (Dudikoff) and his new associate Dallas Castel (Tolkan) are talking to a crimelord and the guy says ""You're ego is writing checks your body cannot cash"" and Tolkan who said that exact line in Top Gun looks at him suddenly (I think Tolkan was expecting him to say something else and they decided to give the bad guy a different lines to make his reaction look better)
I'd die for you is almost an exact rerun of the Flash episode Beat the Clock, where a songstress was murdered and her husband is the one on Death Row for her murder. The Similiarities continue as The victim in the Flash episode was named Linda Lake and the Victim in Cobra is Mindi Lake. However, unlike the flash where the victim was actually alive and sufferring from induced amnesia, (another woman was put in a car crash so her face burned and her dental records switched to fake Linda's death) Mindi lake was actually positively murdered.
There are some others but I won't spoil them for you. all in all you won't regret getting this set.",1211328000,2,1269,4.4978354978354975

Again a show that they don't sell on dvd in Holland, so it was great to find it here. Praise the Lord for creditcards and Amazon :)
Loved this show when I was younger, have been a fan of Michael's since I was about 11 years old and once owned his Official website. As I am watching the show now, I have to say it's a typical 90's show, but still entertaining. And it's just great to be able to find it online, watching it brings me back to good times in my life :)",1205625600,2,659,4.15625
