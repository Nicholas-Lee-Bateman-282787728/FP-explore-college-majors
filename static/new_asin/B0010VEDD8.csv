8238682,3,B0010VEDD8,"This is a nice average little movie in a drop dead gorgeous setting - South Africa.  I love Maeve Binchy's books but they are not nearly as sappy as the movies that are made from them.  Maeve's characters all face challenges and have to change themselves in order to move on.  It had the usual - angry spoiled kids of a parent who left, etc., but it was a nice way to pass 90 mins. or so.",1520899200,,388,4.012987012987013
