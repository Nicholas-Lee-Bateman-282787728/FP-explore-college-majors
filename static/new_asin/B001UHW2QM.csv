8343805,5,B001UHW2QM,"Valu is a treat to watch because it takes us in to the heart land of Maharashtra and the sweet melodic,rural slang of the villages. Note the language, never has language sounded so pleasant on my ears. This is a story of Kusavde, a small village in Maharashtra and its simple yet complex people. The central character is a bull, VALU who has been blamed for everything bad happening in the village. Politics, a love story,a film maker and a host of other interesting characters all intersect in this movie about people who are more interested in making their own point than capturing the bull. The highlights The theme song which is great and is played every time the bull appears,loved the tune Atul Kulkarni's acting deserves a special mention because he is superb as the uptight forest officer and so is the rest of the cast. Umesh Kulkarni deserves a clap for choosing a unique theme and delivering. Here is a director to look out for. Once again, the language of rural Maharashtra is such a joy to hear. Rural Maharashtra searing in the summer or late winter has never been so beautifully shot. The landscape has been so lovingly shot..unlike anything I have seen before in a color movie with the exception of Tingya Very highly recommended for all lovers of Marathi cinema.",1259971200,,1279,4.688888888888889
