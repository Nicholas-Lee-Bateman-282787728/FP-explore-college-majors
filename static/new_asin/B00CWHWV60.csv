5743493,5,B00CWHWV60,"Angelique Hanesworth's Belly Dance Layering is an advanced teaching video that, if you have enough dance experience for the challenge, will be a ""forever DVD"" in your video dance library. It will have techniques worth practicing and refining for as long as you are dancing....as dance is a never ending path of learning towards perfection.

Over 2 hours of teaching, with the first being 14 combinations where you have specific techniques that get successively more difficult, and then choreography with a breakdown in sections...and both have practice sessions (the non-stop practice sessions have the choice of music only or voice over). This is all as Angelique puts it, ""a long term training companion,"" as you progress as a dancer. This video does not give a ""warm-up,"" so make sure to stretch and do your own warm-up before!

If you have the strength, flexibility, and knowledge of dance, you will really appreciate the challenge of this DVD. It's quite a bit above my level, but I loved it anyway...the trying was fun and educational, and good as a goal to aim for. The final performance by Angelique is gorgeous...ultra glamorous and the height of feminine beauty. Music is by Phil Thornton, and Drumspyder. Production is excellent, and Angelique is easy to follow and understand.",1386633600,8,1288,5.042253521126761

8586915,5,B00CWHWV60,Her movements are subtle bc shes got them in her muscle memory already. Learning them we exaggerate the moves and she breaks it down for you no worries. I love this. Its something to work up to right away and keep working on. Shes an amazing dancer whos subtle moves are what are I want to achieve in parts of my dancing.,1519430400,,321,4.193548387096774

8586918,4,B00CWHWV60,"It is very nice to see an advanced video on layering offered.  There are not a lot of them out there.  Angelique is lovely and talented and gives you a lot of material to absorb and get ingrained into your muscle memory.  As in other reviews, I will point out that these layering moves are small and subtle........  but you must realize, these small, subtle moves have intrinsic beauty and mystery.  These layering moves are meant to accentuate your dance.  Your entire dance should not be filled with the layering.  Both subtle layering and pronounced layering are to be lightly sprinkled in to create those WOW moments.  I have heard some say they don't like the combinations of layers taught in this.  My answer is, if you learn it, it will make you a better dancer AND you will be able to start layering combinations of your own.  It is worth learning!  Enjoy your dance journey!",1424390400,,883,4.596153846153846

8586920,4,B00CWHWV60,"Like in the other 4 star review there does seem to be a lack of definition in subtle movements. Such as when she says up roll down (belly roll) you don't see it at all. Many of her movements seem very bland and not accentuated at all. Almost like if she wasn't telling you what she's doing, you wouldn't know that's what she was doing. That, to me, is not good for an instructional video.

I give the 4 stars because this does actually have advanced moves and her movement for advanced things are more defined and you can mostly see what she's doing. It's the basic moves that are hidden and I could see confusing to some people. I feel like she learned complicated stuff first and then just barely got the basic moves down. There is some choreography that is advanced. However, I was not impressed with her performances. She's twirling most of the time and wearing shoes, which I rarely ever see anyone do.

Next question is, was it worth the $20 I paid for it. I would say mostly. I would say it's worth maybe $10-15 rather than $20. However, there being a lack of advanced dvd's to begin with, this is worth getting to add to your dancing.",1410134400,,1142,4.356807511737089
8586921,5,B00CWHWV60,"I am completely revising my review because I am now at the point where it is useful to me. When I first purchased it I had to put it in my collection of ""someday"" videos. I am ready now.  This  is one of the very best belly dance instructional videos out there.  I am thrilled to say that I know this will give me years of study and practice. I am very grateful to Angelique for putting this out there for us. It is stupendous!",1399593600,,427,4.0
8586922,5,B00CWHWV60,"I love this DVD. It breaks down belly dancing techniques clearly and precisely. A great workout and makes you feel like a true belly dancer. I definitely recommend it to people who want a good workout, like to dance and want to learn the true art of belly dancing.",1393372800,3,264,4.408163265306122
8586923,5,B00CWHWV60,"I received this DVD today and am very excited by the content. The combos are truly beautiful, subtly complex & a welcome challenge. It's going to take me awhile to learn each one but that's just fine :). I've reviewed the details of the first combination several times over and have begun the process of breaking it down into manageable ""pieces"", drilling the individual components and starting to layer a little bit at a time in very slow careful repetition. I love the added motivation  & future possiblities it provides to my practice. Thanks Angelique! This is a very welcome addition to my home practice and personal dance goals!",1390953600,3,634,4.81651376146789
8586924,4,B00CWHWV60,"The dance method in this program is about deep core layering and very short range of motion in movement. It is designed for the dancer with basics in place and seeking deeper knowledge in layering several movements to present as one combination.
The first half of the program takes 14 combinations evolving from moderate to quicker tempos into a non -stop practice section. For example, in combination one, Angelique layers figure 8s, snake arms with upper body undulations on traveling steps as chasse to  3/4 tempo.
The remainder of the program is all about placing the combinations into a choreography with options for nonstop drills which is a nice feature along with voice on or off during practice sessions
If you prefer larger, well defined, fluid and languid, layering movement in your belly dance, this type of layering is done quickly and some of the movement appears lost at times. Muscle memory makes the statement in this particular method.",1388188800,12,953,4.9937106918239
