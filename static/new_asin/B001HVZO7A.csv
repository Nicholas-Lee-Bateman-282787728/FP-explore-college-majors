3644537,4,B001HVZO7A,"The Alphabet Killer is a pretty good and solid thriller. Like the majority of thrillers, it starts out slowly, but gradually picks up as it progresses. I really enjoyed seeing the police investigation and psychological aspects of the movie.

I was especially impressed with Eliza Dushku`s performance in the movie. She delivers one of her most mature performances to date as Meghan Paige. Eliza did a great job of portraying the dedicated, but troubled cop, especially in the breakdown scenes, which are some of the most realistic portrayal of schizophrenia i`ve ever seen. I really think that this role is a nice step forward for Eliza. Also i feel that Meghan Paige is in a way the embodiment of the mental strain that investigators of serial killers go through. Just some food for thought.

Anyway like i`ve said earlier, The Alphabet Killer is a pretty good, well acted thriller. It isn`t the best thriller movie ever made, but at the same time it`s very good to watch and will have you thinking a lot about the case portrayed in it.",1232064000,2,1037,4.7555555555555555
3644538,4,B001HVZO7A,"Despite its rather lurid jacket, this DVD presents an intelligent, involving, somewhat fictionalized account of an actual series of child murders that took place in Rochester, NY, in the 1970's. The acting is excellent, with Eliza Dushku being given more scope than in her break-through movie ""Wrong Turn,"" where she was just another pretty, potential slasher victim.

Here Dushku has a more realistic adult role as a police detective. I was afraid the movie was going to veer off into the ""Ghost Whisperer"" supernatural - but no, we see early on that Dushku's visions are a symptom of the schizophrenia she battles.

So despite these macabre appearances, the picture maintains a look of steely gray/blue realism. Much of it was shot on location in Rochester, and as the commentaries for the DVD underscore, the downcast, depressed conditions in much of Rochester provide the ideal backdrop for the film's grim subject matter.

The photography is brilliant throughout. There are a lot of close-ups here, done in intense chiaroscuro. So the viewer is always led to consider what might be lurking beyond that edge of shadow - in people's hearts and minds.

There are two commentaries on this DVD - one by the Director, one by the writer. Both are good. But if you only have time to listen to one, I suggest the Director's Commentary. Rob Schmidt gives a good feel for what it was like shooting in and around Rochester, the site of the Alphabet Murders and two other series of killings, earning it, in some people's minds, the dubious title of ""serial killer capital of the U.S.""",1231632000,,1576,4.869402985074627

The drama around the personal and professional downfall of detective Megan Paige (Eliza Dushku) is well crafted and well played, and it just doesn't feel like something I've seen before, but every time the victims' ghosts appear to her I got the feeling that this movie might not be as original and fresh as it seemed.

The one big fault I found in it, was that the main character could see the ghosts of the dead children that were murdered (horrible job by producers, the ghosts didn't even look remotely realistic, very cheap) other than that the story line was pretty cool, I just didn't quit care for the ending. I give it 4 stars for the movie, that's being nice. Good effeort but Its not a movie id watch again :(",1380585600,,523,4.137254901960785

3644559,4,B001HVZO7A,This story is a modernization of a true series of Double Initial killings that ocurred in Western NY in the 1970s.

3644561,3,B001HVZO7A,"While the movie its self is a mediocre story, Eliza Dushku does an excellent job portraying a detective that's snapped. However, the story seemed a little incomplete and unresolved, it kept me entertained and intrigued in exactly how everything was going to happen.

When the main character has her episode near the beginning of the movie, it seems to be rushed into the story and almost out of nowhere. You're not given the proper information about any of her previous issues, nor are you made aware of her really, truly having any current issues. She simply goes from being basically okay and dedicated to the case to extremely unstable. It would have been nice to see more of a buildup and more to her past to truly connect with the character and the things she found herself going through.

If you're a Dushku fan, I'd recommend it, she does a great job with what she's given. The movie is far from a masterpiece though so there aren't too many reasons to watch it aside from her. I should restate that; there aren't too many reasons to purchase the movie aside from her.",1359331200,,1075,4.59375

But this movie was very interesting and had many twists and turns. It has a very interesting story line, I think you will enjoy it. It arrived quickly and was still factory sealed with the sticker across the top. I would recommend adding this to your collection.",1358726400,,407,4.513513513513513
3644564,3,B001HVZO7A,"I was very impressed by the first two-thirds of this movie and especially Eliza Dushku's remarkable performance as a perceptive detective hampered by mental illness. In fact, the whole movie is sensitively directed and finely acted by a terrific ensemble cast. Unfortunately, the movie falters in the final third, where a fictitious solution is provided, the least likely suspect is chosen as the killer, and the boundaries of coincidence (and credulity) are stretched to breaking.",1353974400,,481,5.426666666666667
3644565,1,B001HVZO7A,"One of the worst jumbled movies I have ever seen in my life.  This might have made sense if I had been stoned, but to me it had no real value at all and if the reason you rented the movie was to see Eliza Dushku topless, then you best be quick about it. This movie was supposed to be based on the true story of the double initial killings in Rochester, NY. Not my cup of tea for sure, but then you may just like it, who knows.",1347753600,,426,3.7865168539325844

3644567,4,B001HVZO7A,"This is more psychological portrait than horror movie.  Worth watching twice.  The first time you focus on the plot twists and the trying to figure out the mystery.  The second time, you appreciate how this is really a story of obsession and madness.  The film is very well constructed and the understated acting of all involved, particularly Eliza Dushku draws you into the mindset of someone loosing it as they get deeper into unsolved crimes.  By the end, you are seeing events through her eyes and it is difficult to tell what is real and what is imagination.  All the more disturbing because it is based on a true story. As another reviewer states, the low light and washed out colors add to the atmosphere.  And, how many films have you seen shot in Rochester?",1324339200,2,766,4.62962962962963
3644568,3,B001HVZO7A,"The box art on The Alphabet Killer (2008) looked really interesting, the premise sounded intriguing - especially the fact that it was based on a series of real murders, and it starred Eliza Dushku (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Tru Calling, Dollhouse), so I Netflixed it and settled back with my wife to enjoy something of a cerebral romp as we chased a killer through the clues.

Well, the movie doesn't quite cut it as a police procedural.  That became apparent the first time Megan Paige (Dushku) starts to see and hear the first dead girl.  The effects are totally creepy, with a skin-crawling voice and prosthetic visuals that definitely belong in a horror movie.  There's one scene where Megan crawls under a bed to get inside the mind of the murdered girl that actually made me jump, and I don't jump easily.

The storyline is uneven to a degree.  We never know why Megan Price is so obsessed with the case and I really wanted to know.  With stories like this, the motivation of the characters is really important.  We just don't get it in this one.

Dushku does a good job portraying the character.  Megan Price is a far cry from Faith in Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Echo, the character she played on Dollhouse.  As Megan Price, Dushku is fragile and barely holding it together, and I instantly sympathized with her.  I bought into the portrayal, but that made the missing motivation even more apparent.
The scenes are pretty good overall.  The story is set in Rochester, New York, where the actual murders took place back in 1971-1973.  The world looks very gray and industrial, thick and oppressive.  The horror imagery is almost black and white at times and pops out as very stark, very attention-getting.

Overall, I just wasn't as happy with the film as I wanted to be.  The movie doesn't deliver full closure for either the character or the plot.  In real life, the murders were never solved either, but in fiction I'd like to have things neatly tied up.  Megan Paige's resolution isn't a happy one either, and I couldn't believe when the movie ended where it did.
The movie is worth a look if you're a Dushku fan or are wanting a curious blend of horror and mystery and true crime, and if you won't mind being left somewhat abruptly at the ending.",1306713600,,2258,4.6
3644569,5,B001HVZO7A,"Eliza steals the show in this movie. She really draws you into the movie and makes you feel so many different emotions. Also, the blu-ray itself does a great job in all areas.

She becomes obsessed with finding the killer and when, after months of work, she fails to find any results she tries to kill herself. She is hospitalized in a mental institution for two years. When she is released the police department rehires her, but only as a file clerk. She discovers that the killings have begun again after a two year stoppage. Where was the killer during the two years? She persuades the captain to let her tag along with the detectives. She becomes overly stressed again, but does discover who the killer is.

3644571,5,B001HVZO7A,I'd never heard of this but checked it out cuz it was filmed in Rochester NY (an often overlooked city) and it has one of my fave actresses ... Ms. Dushku. The film is well paced and kept me on the edge of my seat until the very end. Dushku was perfect for the role ... moody and obsessed. With the recent arrest of the kidnapper I hope more people will watch this gripping thriller,1302998400,,382,4.1066666666666665
3644572,1,B001HVZO7A,"The real Alphabet Killer story would be a great subject for a film, but this version immediately drives off reality road into fantasy land and eventually ends in BS-ville. It's the type of movie you wonder why they even bothered to base on a real event. Clearly the writer had somewhere else they wanted to go. Why didn't they just go there without the ""based on true events"" tag. Not worth the time it takes to watch it. Even though Eliza Dushku is trying really hard to act her way out of this bad movie, her efforts fail.",1285977600,3,524,4.357142857142857
3644573,3,B001HVZO7A,"This was not a great thriller, but it was interesting. I knew enough about the alphabet murders to know that the case is still unsolved so I was not expecting resolution at the end of the movie, which was good, as I didn't get it. For those of you out there who did not know that, sorry to spoil the film for you, but I think that you will enjoy it more if you don't have the expectation that the case is going to be all wrapped up and have a ""happy ending."" This film is loosely based on the true story of the Alphabet Killer's crimes in that 3 young girls were found raped and murdered. The names of the victims have been changed and a lot of other details about the suspects in the initial investigation. Of course, Dushku's whole character is fiction, but she was a really interesting character in my opinion. She really drove the movie forward and, due to her schizophrenia, you were never sure if she was really seeing things and had a kind of psychic ability or if she was hallucinating or just off her meds. I never really bought Eliza Dushku as a hard-core police detective, but she did a really good job at acting crazy.

Cary Elwes is largely underutilized and plays a typical police detective. Timothy Hutton did a wonderful job as a paralyzed member of Megan's support group. These lead names were supported by a very good supporting cast, including a standout performance by one of the murdered girl's parents trying to answer the police's questions right after her body was found. Megan's partner (Tom Malloy) also turned in a solid performance as someone who was trying to make the best of a bad situation when he was forced to work with the resident crazy woman. Many of the supporting cast was only on screen for a few moments, but they really made this movie for me.

The special effects were well done and you, as the viewer, never really know what Megan is really seeing and what she thinks she is seeing. It is interesting as I felt like I was having auditory and visual hallucinations along with her as she was investigating. I also really loved her obsession with the case and how she felt like she could not move on without solving the murders. Megan's character aside, this is a fairly bland and by-the-book thriller. With her personal challenges, this movie became interesting enough to give 3 stars to. I don't think I will go out of my way to recommend this to friends and family, but it was definitely interesting enough to spend an hour and a half watching it at home. If they came out with a sequel (as I hear is rumored -- they kind of leave you hanging at the end), I would definitely check it out!",1274745600,,2632,4.424742268041237
3644574,2,B001HVZO7A,"I gave it a 2 star rating because it didn't really get into the killings. I lived in Rochester, NY back then. It all happened around the time my daughter was born. I knew a uncle to one of the girls. Yes, to this date they have not found the killer. It had the whole city in such a state that people from all walks of life were afraid for thier children. This movie could have more about the killings but, it's a good movie to watch.",1268870400,,433,3.9885057471264367
3644575,5,B001HVZO7A,"The reason I bought the movie was because it has a buff scene of Eliza Dushku, what I got was a surprisingly good thriller.  Not the best movie I have ever scene, not in the top 50, but it was entertaining, the acting was good, and it was suspenseful, defiantly worth a look.",1267315200,6,275,4.188679245283019
3644576,2,B001HVZO7A,"I have been a big fan of Eliza Dushku since I saw her in ""Bring it On!"" I also like her character in TV series ""Tru Calling."" She was in ""Wrong Turn,"" which is not surely the greatest horror movie, but still worth watching. That is why I am interested in ""The Alphabet Killer"" directed by Rob Schmidt, who is also the director of ""Wrong Turn."" Moreover, this serial killer suspense is, the film claims, ""based on the truth.""

In fact, ""The Alphabet Killer"" is very loosely based on the ""Alphabet Murders"" that took place in Rochester, in the 1970s, but the film's script focuses a police detective Megan Paige (Eliza Dushku) investigating a brutal murder of young girl Carla Castillo (victims' names are changed). Megan is an able police officer and her fellow detectives (including her boyfriend Kenneth played by Cary Elwes) know that, but she becomes too obsessed with the case. She starts seeing things and hearing voices, but is this because she is ""delusional""? Or is it because of some supernatural power she alone can feel?

Two years later, after medical treatment, Megan is back in the police department. Then a dead body of a girl is found. The killer is still on the loose.

The story intrigued me at first, but about 30 or 40 minutes in, I started to lose interest. The acting is very good. The grayish-colored photography captures the bleak atmosphere. But the film doesn't tell us much about the cases or weird things Megan sees or hears. Eliza Dushku does her best, but her character and pains doesn't convince because we are not given the detailed account of the murder cases, not even the hypothetic theories. In fact, the character of Megan aside, the storyline is pretty conventional.

A detective story with an emotionally unstable heroine is not a bad idea. The problem here is that her ""delusions"" have little to do with the way the film resolves its rather predictable whodunit part. It is a pity that the cast and the subject matter deserve a better story like, say, ""Zodiac.""",1265760000,3,2001,4.724928366762177
3644577,3,B001HVZO7A,"I liked this little serial killer film because it had a nice little twist and some disturbing images. The idea of the detective who is wrapped up in this murder case going insane is very intriguing as we don't know if she is actually going insane or if the victims are actually talking to her. The director does a decent job of trying to keep us guessing by throwing the usual suspects in our path, but in the end I figured it out before the killer was revealed.....ah you thought you could fool Mr. Know It All!? ....I think NOT! Regardless this is better than average for this kind of thing and I liked the ending.",1264377600,,616,4.318965517241379
3644578,3,B001HVZO7A,"The Alphabet Killer is a pretty standard serial killer flick that manages to stay compelling enough to keep you interested despite its flaws. Eliza Dushku (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Dollhouse) stars as Megan, a schizophrenic detective assigned to the murder of a young girl, which soon enough sets her down the path of a meltdown. Two years later, the killer strikes again and Megan is back on the scene, haunted by the apparitions of the victims all along the way. From a director like Rob Schmidt (Wrong Turn, Masters of Horror: Right to Die), you'd expect The Alphabet Killer to be a grisly, bloody opus; but the film instead focuses more on Megan's story and her quest. This actually works towards the benefit of the film, even though Dushku's wooden acting more often than not drags things down a bit. That aside, The Alphabet Killer is pretty compelling and offers one or two genuine surprises, and features genre stalwarts like Cary Elwes, Michael Ironside, Timothy Hutton, Tom Noonan, and Bill Moseley, as well as smaller roles for Martin Donovan, Carl Lumbly, and recent Oscar nominee Melissa Leo. All in all, while nothing special in the least, The Alphabet Killer is worth seeing for fans of the genre, and its bleak denouement manages to set it slightly above the rest of the pack.",1262476800,,1293,4.828828828828829
3644579,2,B001HVZO7A,"This movie might have been crafted into, at least, a fairly conventional cops & serial killer movie, but fails. It's a waste of a pretty decent supporting cast, including Timothy Hutton, who doesn't appear to get the kind and quality of work he deserves. There are many problems, including a silly answer to the whodunnit that you can see coming up the street way, way early.  And then, once revealed, the plot gets even worse. Most problematic, I'm afraid, is Eliza Dushku's performance. Actors talk about how hard it is to ""do crazy"" and this is as glaring an example I know of how NOT to portray a person with mental illness.  She's got all kinds of weird tics and an arm that seems to always be threatening to go Dr. Strangelove on her.  I'd diagnose any number of neurological illnesses before the schizophrenia which is supposed to be her affliction.  Her hallucinations are straight out of The Ring. Avoid this stinker.",1257897600,,926,4.697530864197531
3644580,3,B001HVZO7A,"This film is well acted and based on a real case from the 1970s.  The film has an interesting theme - is being mentally sound a handicap in catching criminal deviants?

Eliza Dushku plays an Upstate NY detective with adult onset of schizophrenia.  It brought Nietzsche to mind: when you look into the abyss (or monster), the abyss looks back at you.  Did her overwhelming drive to capture mentally unbalanced criminals bring on the mental disorder?  Or, did the disorder help her with her job and this particular failure, push her off the deep end? Interesting concepts however you look at it.  The killing of young girls and their voiced pleas for help to the detective were creepy and the right note for a thriller.  The whodunit aspect had the usual red herring and plot twist ending although predictable enough if you were paying attention.

Overall, the detective's struggle was overdone and lead to implausible scenarios that mucked this film into the sea of mediocrity.",1253923200,,976,4.872727272727273
3644581,3,B001HVZO7A,"The Alphabet Killer tracks an investigator (played by Dushku) who has the unique ability to become obsessed with cases until they are solved.  When a young girl is murdered, she is convinced she can solve it.  She quickly slides into a manic/maniac state: talking to herself, not sleeping, and obsessively studying the case.  When time elapses without a break, she has what appears to be a nervous breakdown.  She is diagnosed with schizophrenia and losses everything.  A couple of years later, slowly recovering, she gets involved in another series of murders.  Will she unravel this time?

Strained acting and some slow parts make this film less than great.  That coupled with a plot line that is pretty easy to predict made this your typical suspense/mystery/thriller.  The transformation into schizophrenia was pretty quick, but I thought it was done well.  The scenery, wintery Richmond NY, was compelling, and really added to the story; this part was well done, too.  Without the ""ghosts,"" the red herrings, and with a better ending, this would have been a better film.  I definitely think that if you are interested, this would be a good film to rent.

*Note: I have realized that the words ""based on"" or ""inspired by"" are legal words that films must use, even if they use just a fraction of a detail of a story that resembles something else.  The idea of a killer targeting 3 girls with matching initials is really the only link to the original 70s murders this film eludes to when it says ""based on.""  Just so you know....",1253750400,,1531,4.790076335877862
3644582,3,B001HVZO7A,"Well, it's hard for me to give a movie more than three stars if I can figure out the ending (right down to the smallest detail) mid way through.  This movie wanted to be good, it really did.  It wanted to hang with the likes of se7en and Silence of the Lambs (given that's a really big ""want""), but in the end this movie will dwindle into renter's obscurity.

The director, Rob Schmidt, does manage a few intriguing moments coupled with a touch of suspense, but if you really pay attention you'll solve this riddle with ease.

On a side note, I still can't take Cary Elwes seriously.  He was great in movies like ""Robinhood: Men in Tights"" and the classic ""The Princess Bride"", but movies like Saw left me laughing hysterically when I should have been cringing with fear and angst (the desperate reaching for the phone scene still makes me laugh).  Albeit his performance here was much better than Saw, I still struggle with him in serious roles.  As for Timothy Hutton and Eliza Dushku, both are strong actors and did the best they could with what they were given.

In the end I'm rating this film 3 stars (would have been 2.5 had it not followed an even worse film--HORSEMAN staring Dennis Quaid.  More to follow on that travesty!)",1248998400,6,1233,4.518018018018018

It was based on a true story from the 1970s.  I thought they did a great job on this movie and getting it close to the true story.

3644594,3,B001HVZO7A,"The Alphabet Killer is a pretty standard serial killer flick that manages to stay compelling enough to keep you interested despite its flaws.  Eliza Dushku (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Dollhouse) stars as Megan, a schizophrenic detective assigned to the murder of a young girl, which soon enough sets her down the path of a meltdown.  Two years later, the killer strikes again and Megan is back on the scene, haunted by the apparitions of the victims all along the way.  From a director like Rob Schmidt (Wrong Turn, Masters of Horror: Right to Die), you'd expect The Alphabet Killer to be a grisly, bloody opus; but the film instead focuses more on Megan's story and her quest.  This actually works towards the benefit of the film, even though Dushku's wooden acting more often than not drags things down a bit.  That aside, The Alphabet Killer is pretty compelling and offers one or two genuine surprises, and features genre stalwarts like Cary Elwes, Michael Ironside, Timothy Hutton, Tom Noonan, and Bill Moseley, as well as smaller roles for Martin Donovan, Carl Lumbly, and recent Oscar nominee Melissa Leo.  All in all, while nothing special in the least, The Alphabet Killer is worth seeing for fans of the genre, and its bleak denouement manages to set it slightly above the rest of the pack.",1235520000,,1299,4.828828828828829
3644595,3,B001HVZO7A,"Ostensibly based on an actual murder case that is still unsolved, this Rob Schmidt-directed thriller is more about obsession that it is about the ghastly crimes at its center.

After a 10-year-old girl is found brutally murdered outside of Rochester, New York, police detective Eliza Dushku becomes so fixated on the killing that she has a mental breakdown.  Two years later, after she's out of the hospital and back working a desk job, two similar cases occur and Eliza, who is now taking medication for her schizophrenia, is allowed to go along with lead detective Tom Malloy (who also wrote the screenplay) as a consultant.

Unfortunately, Eliza's horrific hallucinations return as she tries to prove a ""double initial"" connection between the slayings.  Her grip on reality continues to slip, and she herself becomes a fugitive as she zeroes in on the killer.

The fictional ending to the film is both sad and ironic.

Ms. Dushku delivers a chilling performance as a woman constantly on the brink of losing her sanity.  The fine supporting cast includes Cary Elwes, Michael Ironside, Timothy Hutton, Melissa Leo and Martin Donovan.",1234828800,,1134,5.064516129032258
3644596,3,B001HVZO7A,"I'll admit, I have a morbid fascination with serial killer movies.  They harness a raw energy that is almost overwhelming.  There is often a strange connection with the victims, the detectives, and sometimes even the killers themselves(or is it just me?).  Plus there is a stark fear generated by recognizing a pattern and watching people struggle to prevent further mayhem.

THE ALPHABET KILLER is a pretty well-crafted, fictional tale.  It's derived from some unsolved murders that took place in Rochester, NY, during the early 70's.  A few young girls with matching initials would turn up dead in nearby towns that were spelled with the same first letter (i.e. Carla Castille in Churchville, Wendy Walsh in Webster).

A female detective(Eliza Dushku) is on the case, and she quickly becomes obsessed with cracking it.  Actually, she's the one that starts to crack.  She gets completely consumed, the mystery eats at her mind as she starts talking to herself and hallucinating (same thing happens to me when I watch reality TV shows).

Anyway, the movie takes a pretty dramatic shift early on when this woman loses control and attempts suicide.  She is diagnosed with scizophrenia and admitted to a mental hospital.

Several times throughout this movie, we're shown the visions that this crazy woman sees--ghastly dead children that constantly haunt her.  This is done for shocking effect, but I thought it was completely overdone.  Kinda seemed like a ripoff of a Japanese ghost story film.

The story then proceeds as the police are completely baffled by the subsequent Alphabet murders.  The mentally unfit cop is put back on the case, possibly due to her past romantic relationship with the chief.  And of course, crazy is not something you can just sell on amazon.com.

Director Rob Schmidt does a decent job at mounting suspense.  This film attempts to be dark, but doesn't completely succeed.  It is interesting as a psychological descent into madness.  I thought the cast did a very solid job.  This has no gore or reenactment of the murders themselves, so some might get bored.  Worth a rental.",1234310400,19,2105,5.020231213872832

3644598,3,B001HVZO7A,"THE ALPHABET KILLER makes its way to DVD with a limited run elsewhere. After witnessing some of the things that DID make their way to the hallowed halls of the cineplex, it makes you wonder why they chose those movies over this one, a not too bad thriller.

I'm always wary of movies based on true stories such as this. There is no way to tell how much of it is true and how much of it is placed out for those of us to watch by someone using ""creative license"". Let's hope that most of it is true and that parts of it are WAY off.

Eliza Dushku plays detective Meagan Paige, a dedicated officer who strives to solve all crimes that come her way. When she gets involved in the murder of a young girl, she becomes obsessed with the case. So much so that she begins seeing the dead girl trying to communicate with her. Her involvement reaches such a state that she has a mental breakdown and is taken away.

Two years later, Megan has been released and is back on the job. Her ex-husband (Cary Elwes) who was her partner is now her boss. Given token assignments, Megan strives to live a normal life. But the murder of another young girl with clues similar to the one that tormented her brings her back full circle. She wants this case and she wants this killer.

As she begins to research the new case on her own, she begins to see the victims of both cases. They haunt her as she sifts through clues and interviews. All the while, she stays involved with a support group that deals with loss while slowly weaning herself off of the medications she is supposed to be taking.

Megan fills her every waking hour searching for the murderer. Clues take her and her new partner to several leads. But nothing concrete forms and her struggle keeps building. A solution is always just out of reach but as we view the movie we have to wonder, is what we are seeing real or the delusions in Megan's mind?

The killer is identified by the end of the film. So rest assured that there actually is one. At least I think he was actually there. Decide for yourself in this so so thriller that does a decent job of entertaining.

I've always enjoyed Dushku as an actress and feel she has been underused. But in this one her performance makes her abilities seem limited. I for one don't think that's the case but you couldn't tell that here. Then again perhaps it was the script, the direction, half a dozen other things. Only time will tell.

While it may seem that there is little to say here about the film, the fact is that there actually is little to say. It felt short but filled out, never matching other crime solving films made in the past. It offers very little in the way of something new with the exception of ghosts providing Megan clues, thus the part that makes you wonder how much is true.

All involved seem to do their best with the source material. And sure, the movie is better than watching some of the drek that is offered these days. But as for being a movie to run out and rent as soon as possible? Better to hold off for a rainy day.",1234051200,,3037,4.286212914485166
3644599,4,B001HVZO7A,"I LOVED THIS MOVIE!  I'm from Rochester, I remember the double initial murders, and I was the age of the victims when they happened.  Eliza Dushku is great!  The best part is the theories gone through in searching for the solution to this unsolved mystery, and they come up with some insightful one's.  On an intellectual level the movie is very frightening because it deals with how fear affects ourselves and those around us.  The reason I give this only 4 stars is because the movie should be set in 1970, but it's set present-time (and that isn't stated or obvious from the beginning)  I think they must not have had the funds to make it a period piece.  Scenes from Rochester were welcome, but I wish there had been more distinctive Rochester settings.",1233619200,,757,4.604477611940299
3644600,4,B001HVZO7A,"starring Eliza Dushku from (Buffy, Tru Calling) she stars as a detective pursuing a killer that targets young female children based on the first letter of their name.  As previously discussed in other reviews the plot for this one is actually carried out pretty well.  I found myself liking it more because of what her character was dealing with while pursuing this killer.  It causes her to pretty much lose it in more ways than one.  I don't like telling the plot of the movie, because it gives away too much for me.  I like to be surprised and see where the movie takes you.

The Alphabet Killer takes you on a nice ride and for the most part keeps your interest throughout primarily because of the actors/actresses that encompass the movie itself.  They make it more than attention worthy and at the very least worthy of a weekend renting by anyone to see what its really all about.  Not quite a 5 star movie but totally better than some of the other movie offerings i've seen in the past few months.",1233446400,,1004,4.478021978021978
3644601,4,B001HVZO7A,"The other reviewers have already gone over the plot so I'll just add my own opinion on the DVD itself:

I wish that there were more special features which is the reason I gave this DVD a 4-star rating and not a 5. There's the obligatory commentary, one alternate scene (which wasn't much of an alternate) for the first scene of the movie, and a ""making of"" feature which ... left much to be desired because all it was were film crews being visible behind the filming of certain scenes. I would really liked to have seen more interviews for the ""making of"" from the cast and crew. Seeing as to how the movie revolves around schizophrenia, it would have been nice to see some type of feature (or even a full-length documentary) on the illness and/or something about the real Alphabet Killer beyond the last part of the movie that stated he had yet to be found.

I enjoyed the movie itself and was stoked to find out that the same guy who directed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wrong-Turn/dp/B00005JMDZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wrong Turn</a>&nbsp;also directed ""The Alphabet Killer."" I was happy to find out that they are very different movies that happen to have the same actress in the lead role.",1233360000,,1243,5.029126213592233
3644602,4,B001HVZO7A,"The Alphabet Killer was a pretty good movie. The acting was good and the story was good although all the information wasn't accurate.

I wanted to see this movie because of the cast and because it was based on true events. This was a great movie to watch one time but I don't think I could watch it again. It didn't have quite enough mystery or action for me to want to watch it again.

Storyline: A serial killer starts killing little children so it is up to the detectives and police force to try to figure out who it is. At first no one believes that there is a serial killer on the loose and they all think Megan (Eliza Dushku) is getting too attached to the case and they think she is over processing the case. The detectives cannot solve the case so they let it go much to Megan's dismay. Megan starts getting haunted by the first little victim to the point she tries to commit suicide so she has to get mental help. During that time more victims are killed so Megan begs the police force until they let her back on the case of the Alphabet Killer. Rent the movie to find out if Megan can solve who the Alphabet Killer killer is.

If you like CSI I think you'll like this movie but again I'm not sure it you will want to watch it over and over again because it's kind of a simple movie.

I recommend renting this movie to see if it'll be one that you'll want to watch over again.",1233100800,3,1385,4.137546468401487
