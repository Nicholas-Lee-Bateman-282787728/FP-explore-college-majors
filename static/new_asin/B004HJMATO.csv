8429588,3,B004HJMATO,"A thriller with many-many-many twists.  Although Naseeruddin Shah and comedic giant Arshad Warsi do act well, the script is too twisty for enjoyment.  Both were magnificient in Dedh Ishqiya (a sequel maybe of this one?).  In that movie you can also enjoy the return to the screen of the glorious dancing-singing superstar Madhurit Dixit.",1449014400,,337,5.203703703703703
8429589,3,B004HJMATO,"Since it doesn't seem to be defined, here are the specs on the disc:
- Widescreen 2.35:1
- Video: 1920 x 1080
- Audio: DTS HD Master, Dolby Digital 5.1
- Subtitles: English, Spanish, German, Arabic, Tamil (though the print out lists Telugu and another Arabic track scratched with liquid paper)

Extras:
- 20min. Making Of
- 32min. Deleted Scenes

Video transfer and audio are great, and the subtitle track in English is of great quality. However, can't say the same for extra subtitle tracks- can't comment on German, Arabic and Tamil, but the Spanish track is quite horrible, as if translated straight from Google Translate, using ""hermano en ley"" for ""brother-in-law"" instead of using ""cuado,"" or simple gender confusion using the male pronoun when talking about Vidya's character.

Also, extras aren't subtitled, which is usually expected on Indian releases.",1422921600,,861,5.135714285714286
8429590,3,B004HJMATO,"This movie is about the power which a village woman comes to hold over 2 small-time crooks who are running away from a con and seek to hide in their friend's home. It so happens that the woman, the friend's wife, has just been widowed. The story narrates about the widow's ""agenda"", a kidnap and a signature gesture to establish that she is truly independent. She plays the 2 men, one against the other, and extracts pleasure from it.

The story is about a modern Indian woman, even a village woman, who is very different from the stereotyped docile and suppressed ""Bharatiya nari"" (Indian Woman).  The crooks suddenly realise that this widow can also drive a car! And, she is a very ""thinking and calculating"" human being!

Vidya Balan, the widow, is superb. This movie boasts of Naseeruddin Shah, the great actor of Indian cinema. Arshad Warsi does not disappoint, either.

This movie is simply the narration of a story which is different from what one expects from a Bollywood film. Its saving grace is the excellent performances by the trio mentioned above. You are not missing much if you pass up this movie.",1297382400,2,1113,4.721649484536083
8429591,4,B004HJMATO,"Many of the great films in the last few years have been made by directors who are new and promise to infuse new life in to the story telling factory i.e. Bollywood. Dibakar Bannerjee (Khosla ka Ghosla), Neeraj Pandey ( A Wednesday) Raj Kumar Gupta ( Aamir) and Anurag Kashyap( Black Friday) and Ayaan Mukherji  (Wake up Sid) are examples of accomplished young directors who have entered Bollywoood and are slowly rewriting its rules. I welcome its newest member Abhishek Chaubey who directs Ishqiya.
Ishqiya is a fresh take on the love triangle story with a crime story in the background. KhaluJaan (Naseeruddin Shah) and Babban (Arshad Warsi) are small town con men on the run from the boss after stealing some money from him. They stop at an old friend's house but their friend has passed away. Instead they meet his widow ( Vidya Balan) The widow is quite a manipulator and soon both fall for her charms. The widow soon hatches a scheme to make money and it includes kidnapping a steel merchant. Ofcourse the plan goes haywire and soon everyone suffers the consequences.
I have heard people complaining it to Apaloosa but the story lines are not similar the only thing common between the two films is the role of the conniving woman.
Ishqiya has been breathtaking shot in Wai, Satara distirct Maharashtra and in Uttar Pradesh. India looks so different through the eyes of these young directors. The landscape is lush and barren at the same time. The rural vista is simply beautiful and makes you nostalgic about India. Kudos to Mohana Krishna.
I liked the music but does not compare to Maachis or Omkaara however the track Dil to Baccha Hai is superb.
The acting accolades go to Nasseruddin Shah as the music trivia loving thief, Arshad Warsi as a lustful oaf and Vidya Balan as their wicked nemesis for believable performances. There are also many side actors and all act well.
On the whole Ishquiya is a great film and could have been a noir classic if the second half was tighter and the end satisfying. I five it four stars 6/18/10",1277856000,2,2038,4.692737430167598
