970187,5,6305081832,"From 1939, arguably the most oustanding year for films in Hollywood history, this eloquent, moving and touching film is almost a forgotten piece of masterful moviemaking.
Lewis Milestone faithfully brought to the screen John Steinbecks time honored novel about two nomadic workers sharing a simple dream of one day owning their own farm. Lon Chaney gives his most memorable performance (apart from his portrayal's as tormented wolf man, Lawrence Talbot) as the immensely strong, but simple-minded Lennie. Burgess Meredith, in a fine performance too, plays his jaded travelling companion, George Milton. The two men seek work on a farm bucking barley, but their situation quickly darkens due to the aggressive, bullying attitudes of the owners son, Curley (well acted by serial cowboy, Bob Steele) and his bored and lonely wife, Mae (Betty Field)
In addition to this masterly casting, there is marvellous support lent by Charles Bickford as the straightforward head ranch hand, Slim.....Noah Beery Jr. as the kind hearted and easy going cowpoke, Whit....and noted stage actor Roman Bohen is simply unforgettable as the crippled old timer, Candy. Bohen solidly contributes to many key scenes throughout the film, and his on screen relationship with his faithful, old dog is exceptionally moving (aided by a poignant score from Aaron Copeland)
""Of Mice and Men"" rightfully deserves it's place as one of the finest American films of the twentieth century. An inspiring piece of film making that will illict a wide range of emotions from fans of strong, story driven films. Simply, a must see !",978566400,42,1589,5.235294117647059
970188,5,6305081832,"I don't own the DVD, just a video, but this is the greatest movie ever made, without exception. It is perfectly done. The cast, the score (by Aaron Copland), and Lewis Milestone's direction are all done beautifully.  I know I may rankle some literary minds here, but being a huge Steinbeck fan myself, I have to say that this is the only time a film has done Steinbeck better than Steinbeck himself.  Lennie's death scene is the most moving and beautifully created ever in moviedom, and the film has little extras that apparently were in the stage version of the story that were not in Steinbeck's novel.  While other movies from this period often seem dated, this movie is still as real and believable as it ever was.  If you watch this film and are unmoved, then your heart must be made of granite. Buy this DVD; I know I am going to, because no movie (especially not the dreck that is the 1992 John Malkovich-Gary Sinise version)has ever been made that can touch this one. So I say this without irony - this is the best film made, ever!",974419200,6,1039,4.4526315789473685

970490,5,6305081832,"This movie is clearly dated.  It is based on an excellent short novel by and iconic American author, John Steinbeck.  It marks the Hollywood debut of Burgess Meredith.  Burgess Meredith went on to have a long distinguished career.  There are many other actors in the cast that merit notice.  The movie is fairly faithful to the novel. The movie was nominated for four Oscars.

I did not know that Gary Sinise has directed a newer version of this movie.  I have the greatest respect for Mister Sinise and am quite sure that the new version is excellent.  I purchased and audiobook of ""Of Mice and Men"" that is narrated by Mister Sinise and it was excellent.  I read it while rereading the novel and the audiobook really added to my enjoyment of the reread of the novel itself.

Regardless of the excellence of the remake by Mister Sinise, and I am quite sure it is excellent, I still love this original version as a timepiece.  If one is a student of Hollywood history, as I am, I recommend this version from that standpoint.  Thank You...",1475798400,,1038,4.551351351351351

970658,4,6305081832,"Based on the classic John Steinbeck novel and released in 1939, the story focuses on two traveling companions desperate for work in rural California during the Depression: George (Burgess Meredith) is of average stature and smart whereas Lennie (Lon Chaney Jr.) is big and mentally challenged.  They get a gig at a big ranch while dreaming of owning their own one day when the opportunity suddenly presents itself. Unfortunately, the arrogant son of the owner, Curley (Bob Steele), and his flirtatious wife (Betty Field) complicate matters. Charles Bickford is on hand as Slim, Roman Bohnen plays Candy and Leigh Whipper plays Crooks.

Ive been a fan of this potent Western drama/tragedy ever since I read the book as a teenager and both this version and the 1992 version are worthy film adaptions (I have yet to see the 1981 TV production with Robert Blake and Randy Quaid, which Ive heard is good). It seems that you just cannot do a bad ""Of Mice and Men,"" as long as you have decent actors and filmmakers.

Some people scoff at the moral of the story, as if it all comes down to shooting your aged, useless dog yourself, but its way more than this. Its a commentary on the nature of companionship and loneliness: Whereas George and Lennie compliment each other many of the other characters languish in isolation, like Candy, Curleys wife and Crooks, even Slim. Questions of strength, weakness, usefulness, reality and utopia are explored as the story leaves you scratching your head.

Comparing the two versions, I slightly prefer the newer rendition because its in color and is just overall better made with a superior score and cast with the exception of Lon Chaney as Lennie. Malkovich is very effective in the more recent version, but Chaneys Lennie is just more likable. While I don't like the addition of cussing in the 1992 rendition, its probably more realistic and it isn't so bad that it makes the movie unwatchable (for me anyway). In any case, Sherilyn Fenn is a vast improvement over the originals Betty Field, whos annoying and not desirable enough to pull off the part (but, then again, she might be desirable to male ranch hands with no other females within a dozen miles).

The film runs 106 minutes and was shot in California.

GRADE: B+

COMMENTARY ***SPOILER ALERT*** (Dont read further unless you know the story)

Curley's wife has only ever been valued for her sexuality, which she has learned to use to attract attention. Not only is she the only female character, shes also the only character not to be given a name in the book and the 1992 version, which emphasizes that shes a sexual plaything, currently owned by Curley. She was repressed by her mother and taken advantage of by men who made her empty promises. She prefers to believe that her mother stole her letters from the ""Hollywood"" man who used her, instead of accepting reality. She is married to a boor who places little value on her and so she seeks the only attention she can get from the men on the ranch as the only woman there: sexual attention. The contact with Lennie in the barn is as far as sexual as it gets. When she says ""It feels good"" to have her hair stroked, she isn't speaking sexually. She is enjoying the only nonsexual attention and affectionate touch she has had in a very long time, if ever. It is almost a meeting of children between this woman who long ago lost her sexual innocence but remains hopelessly nave, and Lennie, who also longs for soft things in his life. It is a beautiful, tragic scene.

Someone argued that Curleys wife wanted to get Lennie on her side so that he would kill Curley and she would be free to leave. If Lennie killed him, no one would believe him if he ever said that she told him to do it; and since she didn't do the deed herself, she could easily leave and start her life over, hopefully as a movie star. While an interesting theory, the young woman doesn't come across this devious or cunning in the story where her actions are more natural and nave. Similar to Lennie, she was a child in an adult body, albeit not mentally challenged. She was starving for companionship, but none of the other men would hang out with her due to Curley and the threat of losing their job. Lennie was alone in the barn and so she just took advantage of the occasion to converse with someone. Add to this the fact that Lennie was the only man on the ranch to humble (conquer) her arrogant SOB husband, whom she hated. Plus, she noticed earlier how Lennie appraised her with obvious awe. So there was a subconscious attraction and she wanted the gentle giant to touch her, stroke her hair; perhaps to ""reward"" him.",1451606400,,4641,4.608958837772397

Okay, so what's the problem then? Umm... Well... I can't help but wonder... Uh...

970809,4,6305081832,"This film faithfully captures the mood of John Steinbeck's classic novel. I believe one reason is that director Lewis Milestone allowed John Steinbeck himself to contribute heavily to the production. The tale is a superbly crafted slice of humanity that elicits sympathy, empathy and interest for the entire cast of characters involved. Lon Chaney, Jr.'s finest performance! But there is not one single sour or dishonest note from the entire cast. An entertaining as well as thought provoking experience. Would still prompt many discussions about the quality of life today.
The picture quality could have been a little cleaner but this film IS more than 70 years old. The sound quality is adequate. These points led me to give the overall of 4 stars. But the film itself remains a 5 star gem!",1437955200,3,792,4.962406015037594

971154,5,6305081832,"Long before he became ""Lon Chaney"" and cemented his horror legacy as the Wolf Man and various other monsters, Creighton Tull Chaney was a struggling actor trying to find his way in Hollywood in the wake of his legendary father's death.

Under studio pressure, Creighton changed his named to Lon Chaney Jr. and struggled in various B-Movie roles before landing the stage part that would open the door--however so slightly--to bigger and better things.

Lennie Small, a mentally challenged person who does bad things that are often out of his control. After getting the stage role, Lon Jr. would eventually win the screen role that would become one of his favorites.

Lennie travels with his buddy and caretaker, George Milton. George has dreams of one day owning his own ranch and letting Lennie tend to all the animals they will have. Lennie especially likes the idea of tending to all the rabbits.

Meanwhile, George and Lennie find work on a ranch, where Lennie encounters a girl who will lead to nothing but trouble--the same kind of trouble that lead to Lennie and George leaving another town.

There are a couple of moving scenes in ""Of Mice and Men""--one being the scene where Candy--a worker who befriends Lennie and George--has his old, sickly dog taken out and shot. And of course, there's the closing reel where George has to get Lennie out of the trouble he's gotten himself into--the only way he knows how.

""Of Mice and Men"" is a moving triumph--very well acted and very memorable.

I find this far superior to the Gary Senise/John Malkovitch version that was released a while ago, which seemed to rely on close-ups for drama.

I absolutely love this story and I love old movies, but for me this was just an OK film and the weak link is Lon Chaney. I know I'm going to take a hit for this from fans of Mr. Chaney, but he does a caricature of the dim-witted Lenny, without depth, portraying Lenny in an unflattering, stereotypical way that is degrading to mentally challenged individuals.  Obviously I do not feel that this was deliberate, but if I had seen this performance is a school yard, I would have thought it was a bully making fun of a special needs child.

Now if you have seen the John Malkovich version, THERE is an actor who knows how to play Lenny with depth, compassion and truth.

971502,5,6305081832,"Consider me a gigantic fan of this story, period.  The short story (very short) by Steinbeck is phenomenal, and both adaptations (that I've seen) are great.

For me though, this 1939 film version trumps the 1992 version by maintaining a smooth naturalism and emotional resonance that transcends mere depression but actually capitalizes on hope.  Mainly, this is due to the way George is portrayed.  For me, Gary Sinise was the weak link in the 1992 version, playing George with too much agitation to make his emotional connection with Lenny feel genuine.  Sure, that final scene still made me ball like a baby, but with this splendid version, Burgess Meredith delivers such an outstanding portrayal of earnest and humble love that I was really moved by him.

The story is simple yet very profound.  During the depression, George and Lennie struggle to find work.  They have dreams of owning a place of their own yet they lack the financial ability to make those dreams come true, yet they still hold to them.

Firmly.

Lennie, having been kicked in the head by a horse, is slower than the average man.  He is a big man, too big, for his childlike behavior gets him into trouble when his manlike physic comes into play.  Finally with work, Lennie and George find themselves closer to realizing their dream, but when tragedy strikes, in the form of a beautiful woman and a horrible accident, their dreams are shattered almost instantly.

I went on a pretty long explanation a few years back when reviewing the novel, so I won't really harp on it too much here.  The story is a universal story of loneliness, hopelessness and humanity.  Every character is longing for something, and every character is being held back and thus sharing in the holding back of those around them.  There are your central characters (Lennie and George) and their obvious trials and aspirations, but there are also the lives of Mae, Curley, Candy and Crooks.  They all are lacking basic essentials to human happiness, and in their attempt to find it they alienate and even jeopardize the happiness of those around them.

But, what this film adaptation does that the 1992 version doesn't is add a layer of hopefulness.  I don't mean that in an absolute sense, because the film is a downer and very depressing, but the way the characters are played shows that they haven't completely lost their hope, becoming cynical and pessimistic.  In the '92 version there is a lot of distilled agitation that bleeds through in the delivery of all the characters except Lennie (both Malkovich and Chaney Jr. are equally outstanding in their portrayals of Lennie Smalls).  Here though, there is an almost cheeryness, like optimism is still at their fingertips.

That is why Burgess Meredith should have been nominated for the Oscar.  Sure, Jimmy Stewart should have won, but Meredith should have been a close runner-up.  His beautifully composed portrayal of George (caretaker, friend, worker, dreamer) is so complete and so moving.  Just the way he shows mutual excitement when discussing his future plans with Lennie (an aspect of the '92 version I really didn't like, for George's frustration with Lennie's constant badgering about the rabbits gave George an air of destitute irritation) gives me a soft smile and a warm soul.

I won't say that the films conclusion is less heartbreaking than the '92 version, but it carries with it a sense of purity that dampens the pain.

The film is a knockout.  I prefer this to the '40 adaptation of Steinbeck's `The Grapes of Wrath'.  For me, `Of Mice and Men' really captures not just the authenticity of the situation and the reality of the desperation, but it captures the human spirit in all of its forms, showing us the harsh as well as the soft realities of what it is that makes us human in the first place.",1260403200,4,3817,4.811349693251533

Of course, this movie would not have been so great were it not for the underlying story, but these two great actors clearly cared about the characters they were playing, and it shows.

971602,5,6305081832,"I have watched over 600 classic films in my study and enjoyment of classic film. I have watched many films made from a novel--Anna Karenina, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, A Farewell to Arms, etc. It seems there is always something missing in movies adapted from a novel...a film cannot always grasp the depth and ""mind thoughts"" of a book, for a book is more for the mind and the reader's own inner vision and imagination, and a film must deal with the outwardly visual, and so being, much can be lost in the film story. However, was I surprised when I found this DVD at the library and brought it home to watch. It was amazing! I read ""Of Mice and Men"" as a required novel in high school back in the late 70's. I remember liking the story, and I bought my own copy of the book (just as I did with A Tree Grows in Brooklyn) and I read it over and over as the years went by. I haven't read it in several years, but when watching this film, I remembered everything that happened. I wasn't sure I was going to like Burgess Meredith as George, but he was very good. And the same with Lon Chaney Jr. as Lennie, and Betty Field as Curley's wife. Once the movie began, I felt these actors did a very good job portraying the characters as Steinbeck had them in his book. I was surprised with the realism of the film...quite gritty for 1939. Usually films really watered down issues and emotions back then, but this one was surprisingly quite open about them. I rarely cry watching a film, and this film had me crying...you felt so sorry for Lennie, for Candy losing his dog, for the 3 of them losing their ""dream"", and the ending...that was just an incredible ending for a 30's film. At our house we do not have TV and we carefully screen movies the children watch, and we stick to the classic years (1950's and prior) 98% of the time. I know some precodes, etc. are not for children, but I didn't think this film would be too strong for a child. Yes, because of the code, nothing was shown outright, but my 8 yr. old son really cried and was very sad when the gunshot sounded and Candy rolls over in his bunk. My son knew his dog was shot, and it was a strongly emotional scene without seeing anything! And my son cried when Lennie was in the barn with his little puppy who was dead from him being a bit too rough with him. Again, we don't see the dead puppy, but the implied idea is so strong, again my son burst into tears. I felt really bad for not being more careful for my son and his feelings; had I known this film was going to be so strongly emotional, I would have watched it when my son was in bed. I then knew I could not let him see the end; I figured if these 2 scenes of the dogs dying were so hard for him because of the implied realism and strong emotions, then the ending was going to be too. I was right, it was. And the final scene with George and Lennie is so well done, you felt what they were feeling. I was really crying...like I said, not many movies do this to me!  I think the direction and filming was well done; some interesting camera work caught my eye. I can't believe this movie is so ""forgotten""; it is just as great or even better than some of the other 1939 films- Gone With the Wind, Goodbye Mr. Chips, and MUCH better than The Wizard of Oz! I found I understand the story much better as an adult than I did in my youth. It is funny that schools make teens read these novels; because teens have not experienced life fully enough, they cannot fully grasp the truths of life such novels are presenting. Maybe some can, but I never did! Always, it was when I was older, got married, had children, experienced the routine and sorrows of life, that I could relate to such books; for I now have ""been there"" too. As an adult I could see the parallel of Candy's dog and Lennie. I never understood that when I was a teen in school. Anyway, this is an excellent film that no person who appreciates classic film should miss. I am glad I discovered it, and will definitely watch it again. I hear there are ""film as literature"" classes in schools now, and I would highly recommend this 1939 version of ""Of Mice and Men"" for such a class. Do please heed my warning though: if you watch this at home and have young children do not let them watch it with you; children are not ready to handle the strong emotions presented in this film. I would say wait until your child is at least 12 yrs. old.",1151366400,12,4405,4.194575471698113
971603,5,6305081832,"John Steinbeck's ""Of Mice and Men"" was brought to the motion picture screen in 1939 by director Lewis Milestone(All Quiet on the Western Front)and in doing so director Milestone produced one of the GREATEST American films of all time. It is certainly Milestone's GREATEST achievment. Aided by a great cast,Burgess Meredith,Lon Chaney,jr.(his greatest and the films best role)Charles Bickford,Roman Bohnen(outstanding as ""Candy""),and Leigh Whipper(here outstanding as ""Crooks"",also great as ""Sparks"" in ""The Ox-Bow Incident""),and a GREAT Aaron Copland score, this is a film that should be seen by All Americans,and be seen AGAIN and AGAIN.I've seen it at least 50 times over the 38(or so) years,and it has NEVER failed to bring tears to my eyes during certain scences,especially the ending sequence.

  I won't go much into the plot,of this little morality play,but it deals with the friendship of George(Meridith),and Lennie(Chaney) who are wondering field hands and their desire to ""have their own little place"".Depite their desire to own their own home and farm land(private property) this film was labeled ""LEFTIST"",and ""COMMUNIST""!Oh well!

  Cowboy actor Bob Steele(as ""Curly""),Noah Berry,Jr.,and Betty Field(as Steele's lonely wife) also contribute to the film's success. Betty Field, I did think she could have been better,but overall ,I guess she was OK.

  In 1949 Steinbeck,Milestone,and Copland picturized Steinbeck's ""The Red Pony"",it was NOT a success and I didn't care for it,the Copland score for Pony was outstanding.

  I have a question for film buffs out there. Did Roman Bohnen,uder the name of ""Rudy Bowman"",appear(as trooper Smith) in John Ford's ""She Wore A Yellow Ribbon""?It sure sounds and looks like him. Bohnen died in 1949 while on stage,for a production prouduced by the controversial Actors Lab(ultra-left politically) after having been grilled by the House Committee on Un-American Activities. MANY contributors to this excellent production had problems with the U.S. Congress and the Hollywood Studios arising from their political outlook and associations

971604,5,6305081832,"John Steinbeck's classic novella OF MICE AND MEN has also been a 1939 movie, a stage play, and an opera; it was remade as a movie in 1992, with Gary Sinise and John Malkovich.  I haven't seen the remake, but I can say that the 1939 version, under review here, is a near-perfect movie.  Burgess Meredith and Lon Chaney, Jr. are George and Lennie, the eternal, wandering pair whose only sense of home, of security, is found in each other.  The tiny Meredith (later of TWILIGHT ZONE and ROCKY fame) is perfect as quick-witted George.  I might add that while the novella's dialogue contains much swearing, this movie has none - yet one still gets a sense of George's acerbity from Meredith's exceptional performance.  The hulking Chaney is also ideal as slow-witted Lennie; as much as I admire Malkovich, I find it hard to imagine the role of Lennie played with more conviction, wonder, and unaffected pathos than it is here.  The film, with its Depression-era California setting, is beautifully photographed.  Like the novella, it is brief; no scene is longer than it needs to be, yet each scene makes an impact.  The musical score by Aaron Copland is not mentioned enough:  the composer's jagged, western-inspired style could not be more apt for Steinbeck; like Steinbeck's writing, its true genius is in its brevity.  The one and only ""wrong note"" in the movie is Betty Field as ""Curly's wife,"" Mae, who brings about her own and Lennie and George's destruction.  Lennie is supposed to be fascinated by Mae's soft hair, but there is nothing soft about Field's performance, and this lonely, victimized woman comes across as a none-too-bright tramp.  I can't help thinking that the role must certainly be played with more sympathy in the remake, but I still give five stars to the original OF MICE AND MEN.",1144195200,3,1802,4.796116504854369

This movie is very close to the original story.  While redone with later versions (on TV and in movies), this one should have a place in the film buff's library.",1142726400,3,436,4.333333333333333
971606,5,6305081832,"This screen adaptation of the John Steinbeck classic novel is a harsh,fantastic film that took the wind out of me with its frank and brutal depiction of desperation and longing. Movies about the Depression that were actually made at the time of the Depression by people who knew of what they spoke by necessity feel so much more authentic than later movies that treat the Depression as a historical event. The men in this film are quite literally living day to day, and the comparison of men

to dogs that serves as a running motif throughout the film feels like more than just a poetic device. Like dogs, these men were faced with the scary prospect of some day being of no more use, and there was no system in place to take care of them when that day came. Being shot like a dog put out of its misery by its owner really was preferable to the alternatives awaiting them.

I was surprised about how candid this film was, and how bravely it tackled some of the thornier issues of Steinbeck's novel. The incident between Lenny and Mae is divested of some of its sexual overtones, but much is implied anyway. And a scene between Crooks, a black work hand, and some of the other workers, in which Crooks explains in blunt language what it means to be black, tackles race relations as honestly as many films today.

Moments of this film are almost unbearably sad and poignant, but never in that over-sentimental way common to Hollywood films of this time period. Burgess Meredith is terrific in the role of George; he expertly conveys--without ever directly addressing it--the bond he has with Lenny and the degree to which Lenny is as much George's savior as he is Lenny's. Charles Bickford is also excellent as a rough and world-weary

worker. The cast's weak links are Betty Field--hopelessly overplaying her bored sex kitten--and Lon Chaney as Lenny, though both are very good in the pivotal scene that sets off the action of the film's finale.

John Ford's adaptation of ""The Grapes of Wrath"" from the following year gets all of the attention today, and one hardly ever hears of ""Of Mice and Men."" But much of what is great about Ford's film is also great about Lewis Milestone's, and he deserves credit for laying a fine blueprint for bringing Steinbeck's beautiful and heartbreaking stories to the screen.

I first saw it when I was 11 years old, and it shocked and saddened me the same way the Zapruder film did when I first saw it. (In other words, I burst quite unexpectedly into tears. I hadn't read the Steinbeck short novel yet.) I became a lifelong fan of Aaron Copland, the composer of the film's score, and I already liked Lon Chaney because of the Wolfman and Mummy movies, and also Burgess Meredith, pre-Batman and pre-Rocky. All I can say is, in addition to the very moving Candy's dog sequence, the end of the film in which the music softly swells up while the squirrel runs up the tree and the leaves fall has to be one of the most affecting scenes ever made. Also I found that as I grew older, the plight of Curley's wife Mae touches me profoundly. Just thinking of Slim saying ""poor kid, I shoulda let her talk"" makes me kinda sorta a little bit weepy. *sigh* a real gem. (And it's not really in B&W, but sepia.) I actually bought the movie on two LP's in the pre-video days, and my best friend and I used to sit and sob and listen to the last side of the four sides over and over in order to weep.",1113004800,16,1204,4.14957264957265
971688,5,6305081832,"John Steinbeck's masterful story of friendship is definitively brought to screen in Lewis Milestone's 1939 OF MICE AND MEN. This is a terrific movie, essential viewing for anyone with a tolerance for black and white.  The story is so universal and cleanly told this one is hard not to become deeply engrossed in.

  Lon Chaney Jr., rightfully, is the chief reason we remember this movie.  He nails the role of the feeble-minded Lennie, who wants nothing more than to tend his rabbits.  I've never seen this movie before, and I was surprised at how effective Burgess Meredith was as Lennie's friend and protector, George.  If Chaney steals most of the scenes he's in, Meredith is the reliable engine, grounded in humanity, that draws us in.

  OF MICE AND MEN has been remade once, in 1992, in a production starring John Malkovich and Gary Sinise.  For all of Malkovich's talents, I still prefer Chaney's performance.  More importantly, the 1939 production was contemporaneous with Steinbeck's novel.  If the latter movie is a period piece, the 1939 version is current events, and that does make a difference.

  Get out the hankies and get ready to be deeply moved.  An essential movie.",1106438400,60,1186,4.909090909090909
971689,5,6305081832,"Of Mice and Men unfortunately gets lost among other great films of 1939 such as Gone With the Wind, Stagecoach, Wuthering Heights and The Wizard of Oz.  However this poignant portrayal of the Depression era West stands tall in its moral values and simplicity.
George and Lennie are itinerant farm workers hoboing there way through the west.  The sharp minded leader George played superbly by Burgess Meredith has been looking after the dim witted beast of burden Lennie for years.  He has crafted a scenario where they will accumulate enough money to buy a place of their own.  He promises Lennie, who has a patholgic affinity for stroking soft things, that he will be able to tend the soft furry rabbits.  Lennie makes George repeat their plans time and time again never tiring of the story.
They find work on a barley farm but soon the uncontrollable Lennie gets into trouble and their plans get altered.
Lon Chaney Jr. was obnoxiously fantastic as the mentally challenged Lenny.  Burgess Meredith once again proves that he is one of the greatest character actors to ever have appeared on the American screen.",1050019200,10,1111,4.851851851851852

It is such a classic that the acting remains believable even today, 65 years later.  Don't believe me? Just try to sit through with dry eyes, the scene wherein all in the bunkhouse awaits the 'end' of poor ol Candy's dog who is put to sleep by the gun of a cagey ranch hand.  Alot of films this old lose their believibilty and lustre, as acting techniques and directing gets more sophisticated, however Burgess Merideth and Lon Chaney Jr prove two hard acts to follow.

For those who remember Burgess Meredith as only a villain in the Batman TV series of the 1960s, they should take a good look at this moving, splendid motion picture (with a fine performance by Mr. Meredith).

971692,5,6305081832,"The America of the 1930s was a hodgepodge of geography, but the terrain that most movie audiences could relate to was either Tara from GONE WITH THE WIND or the bitter dust bowls of the parched west. Director Lewis Milestone perfectly caught this sense of dry dust mingled with human walls of self-constructed isolation in the filmed version of John Steinbeck's OF MICE AND MEN. America was still caught in the tail end of a decade long depression that seemed quite capable of extending itself for yet another. Since America was not yet involved in Europe's troubles, it was natural for Hollywood to focus on internal matters that reflected the dust that seemed to settle everywhere. Lenny Small (Lon Chaney, Jr) and George Milton (Burgess Meredith) symbolized the alienation between man and an uncaring society. Bindlestiffs like them existed only as punching bags for anyone with a grudge to settle. The only solution for forced isolation was to painfully build an enduring relation with someone who cared. As Lenny tells George incessantly about how 'I got you and you got me,' the viewers could see that maybe he was right.
 Lenny and George are two tramps who seek only a place to call their own. To George, land is physical; it will provide security against the uncertainties of a dust bowl existence. To Lenny, land is internal; it is more of a time than a place. It represents a time to pet rabbits and feel the closeness engendered by the proximity of those rabbits to George. Both are fleeing from the rape charges shouted out by a woman in the previous town against the hulking, dim-witted Lenny. All Lenny wanted was to pet a pretty thing. Both escape to find work on a ranch, but the loneliness that plagued them as a pair on the road they learn afflicts others too. Nearly everyone on the ranch is isolated in one way or another. The most tragic loneliness is the one belonging to Mae, the neglected wife of Curly, whose own loneliness forces him to seek meaningful contact with his fists. Mae is a sexy flirt who might have been happy with a man who could have torn down the high walls of her own isolation, but Curly simply builds them higher as he makes sure that his jealousy keeps her increasingly deprived of human contact. Mae reaches out to the uncomprehending Lenny, and in her words to him of her need to impact on others, the audience can see that a twin set of monologues does not add up to a dialogue. Each is talking at not to one another. Lenny touches her hair and becomes excited enough not to hear her protests. He breaks her neck, and all he knows is that George will know that he 'done a bad thing.' The climax occurs when George finds Lenny hiding but is aware that a vigilante posse is just minutes away. George understands that the only service that one friend can do for the other is to kill Lenny. The scene that George kills Lenny is one of the most heart-rending in film. George again conjures up the mystery time and place that will let Lenny find a cure for his isolation. As George speaks, Lenny responds and for a brief moment actually is transported to the rabbit warren. The gunshot, like the reverberations of the horns that tumbled the walls of Jericho, similarly restore the isolation that had always been the status quo of all concerned.
 OF MICE AND MEN is noteworthy for many reasons, but an often unappreciated factor is the movie's point of view. Lenny, rather than George, is seen as the protagonist. He is in nearly every scene, and he is the focus of discussion when he is not. The audience tends to see the action from his perspective, even if George is the one who performs as a chorus, interpreting it. The movie seems to suggest that while the walls of isolation are high indeed, the need to break them down is one that lies in the souls of all concerned. Just ask Mae or Lenny.",1024531200,15,3840,4.555716353111433

971694,5,6305081832,"OF MICE AND MEN might have been written for the stage: it naturally falls into scene divisions, with a lot of its drama presented in dialogue.  Director Lewis Milestone, in making this film, broke that almost inevitable mold, rehandled the material and made it move in the flow-eddy-flow style of the screen and yet kept the essentials of events and characters true to their author's conception, which was, in itself the director's triumph.  The story about two unfortunate men who dreamed a dream of having a home of their own, with a garden to eat from, working for themselves with no boss to rout them out of bed in the morning, the privilege of loafing or going to the circus without anyone's permission......Just ""bindle stiffs"", migratory farm workers tramping from job to job, this dream meant heaven-on-earth to them, but things happened, those fatal things that can't be called anyone's fault, and their plans went astray.  As the painfully pathetic Lennie, Lon Chaney, Jr. had the role of his career (his WOLFMAN is decidedly a close second).  Milestone soft-peddled Lennie to a considerable degree, and toned down a lot of Steinbeck's violence, to say nothing of his profanity.  The unique Burgess Merideth is fine as George while the underrated Betty Field does commendable work as the flirtatious Mae.  Steinbeck's tragedy was theatrical but Milestone and Eugene Solow's script gave it dignity, inevitability and an unusual strain of excitement.",1005696000,8,1458,5.105042016806722
971695,5,6305081832,"This is the legendary film that brought Lon Chaney Jr. to star status with his portrayal of dim-witted Lenny.  Great story, great cinematography, great performances by Burgess Meredith as Lenny's ""guardian"", Charles Bickford and former cowboy star Bob Steele as the cruel Curly. Plot in a nutshell: George & Lenny are drifters, landing a job at a ranch and dreaming of the day when they own their own ranch, complete with a dozen rabbits for Lenny to take care of. Curly's wife flirts with the ranch hands, especially Bickford, which causes confrontations with Curly and the ultimate tragic ending. If you are a fan of Warner Brothers cartoons, you may be familiar with their over-usage of Chaney's Lenny in their films: ""gee, George""...""whadja say, George?""...""I wouldn't hurt 'im, George""...""George is my friend""...you remember, right?

971696,5,6305081832,"The greatest year ever for the movies was undoubtedly 1939. Of Mice and Men was a member of the class of '39 and was also one of the ten films to be nominated for best picture that year. Competing against Gone With the Wind it had little chance of winning, but merely to be nominated that year was an achievement. Of Mice and Men is one of the great films and one of the best adaptations of a novel. Only The Grapes of Wrath and East of Eden can compete with it as an adaptation of Steinbeck. The film is not as well known as it ought to be, which is a pity as it has a deeply felt story and some superb performances. It really shows the hardships of being a poor farmhand in depression era America and includes many details which give the setting authenticity. Burgess Meredith is wonderful as George while Lon Chaney Junior is a revelation as Lennie. Chaney is probably best known for his horror roles as The Wolf Man, but these roles don't really show his acting ability. Only in his brief role in High Noon does he show the acting ability that is so clearly evident from his performance in Of Mice and Men. George and Lennie's friendship and interdependence forms the heart of the film, but the film is also about loneliness. This is especially shown with regard to two characters, Crooks played by Leigh Whipper, who is excluded from the rest of the workers because of the colour of his skin, and Mae played by Betty Field, whose jealous husband won't allow her to talk to anyone. Field had a great acting talent and her film roles are very distinctive. Here she shows the loneliness and desperation for human contact of a woman who has married the wrong man. It is her search for some warmth that leads her to Lennie and this has unforeseen consequences for everyone. Both Lennie and Mae are unconscious of their actions, they can't see ahead and thus both are like children. What makes the film so great is that it does not judge them. The characters in the film are just people with various strengths and weaknesses. The story is thus very true to life and believable.
The print used for the Image DVD is superb. The picture quality could hardly be better with clear, sharp and detailed images. The black and white photography is truly beautiful. Unfortunately the sound quality is less good. There is quite a bit of background noise in some scenes. However, the sound quality is far from bad as the dialogue is always easily audible and the Aaron Copland score sounds fine.

It begins with two men running, they are chased by a group of men. They jump onto a moving freight train. There is a quote from Robert Burns about disappointments in life. A bus travels along the highway. George explains things to Lenny. The bus driver tricks them and drops them off ten miles short of the #3 Ranch. George warns Lenny about drinking from still waters. They are migrant workers who travel from farm to farm harvesting crops. They dine on canned beans. Lenny gets into trouble, he has a problem. George tells Lenny about a happy future, a change from their past. In case of trouble Lenny should hide there in the brush. George Milton and Lenny Small show up for work, late. They learn about their boss. One bunk has flea powder! They meet Curley, the boss son, who has an attitude and a new wife; he is jealous. Curley objects to her pet puppy. A thresher separates the grain from the stalks.

Curley objects to Slims gift of a puppy to his wife Mae. Lenny wants a puppy too. George tells Lenny to stay away from Curleys wife. Should Candy get a new dog? George talks about having his own farm, and his past life. They eat well after a days work. Lenny gets into trouble by himself. Mae is unhappy on the farm, she wants to go to the movies. They have a Chinese servant. What should Candy do with his old dog? Carl suggests shooting it. Others say the same. Candy agrees. Mae is lonely; she married to get away from her mother and has no place to go. George talks to Lenny about their plans. Candy has money saved up and offers to become their partner; he wants a place too. Curley attacks Lenny, who finally defends himself! Curleys hand is broken, but hes told not to tell what happened.

The workers go into town for entertainment. Lenny stays home and visits the barn to see his puppy. Mr. Crooks talks to Lenny about loneliness. Mae shows up and talks to the men. Later she taunts Curley, who responds by throwing her out. Candy reminisces about a dance hall in Bakersfield. Mae goes to the barn to see her puppy, then sees Lenny and his dead puppy. She plans to go to Hollywood and become a movie star. She was disappointed in the past. Lenny strokes her hair, she struggles but Lenny silences her. Then he runs off. George discovers the body! And Lennys hat. He tells Candy what to do. Mr. Jackson gives out firearms to the men, they will hunt Lenny. Theres only one way now to get Lenny out of this. Slim and George to that place. George talks to Lenny for the last time about their future. The other men come by, the sheriff takes the Luger from George.

This is a story about migrant laborers who go from farm to ranch to harvest crops, supplying extra labor when it is needed. They get room and board and $50 a month. In 1935 the minimum wage was 25 cents an hour, $10 for a forty-hour week. Aside from wages, are things much different today? Do they import workers for a few months? While machines have replaced horses and mules there is always hand labor involved, particularly for crops like fruit which requires picking by hand.",1520467200,,3087,4.391608391608392
