8324769,5,B0000CG1WA,"It's nice to finally see the original Macross subbed on DVD.  This is the volume 3 of the Animeigo discs, containing episodes 9-12.  As one reviewer mentioned, the AnimEigo version's images are clearer than the ADV version, so I think I'll go with this instead.",1406592000,,261,4.777777777777778
8324770,4,B0000CG1WA,"This is the third installment of 9 of the original Macross series.  Macross is the first third of Robotech as most fans would know.  I own the box set and it is phnenominal.  The story is deeper than the Macross arc of Robotech.  This remaster is better than the remaster of Mospeda or Southern Cross.  It almost looks like any series you see today; Not bad for a series made in '81. The images are really cleaned up well.  Vol 3  has ep. 9-12; Miss Macross, Blind Game, First Contact, and Big Escape. I give it a 4.5 out of 5 because they're not pitching the whole set.",1076544000,,570,4.222222222222222
