I seen films for rent in the store real bad so don't know why this isn't on Netflix or Blockbuster. This film should be available everywhere.",1378944000,3,272,4.666666666666667

5905310,5,B00EDVNHKW,I have seen this movie a few times during its production and I can honestly say that it is a great movie!!! It's story is so relatable and it is something that happens with today's youth everyday. Brandon is a great actor and does a great job of playing his character Adam. this film takes a dive into the LGBT community and is a must see.,1376697600,2,339,4.151515151515151

8604339,5,B00EDVNHKW,R.I.P Steven Michael Konduros (Eve) went to both premieres of the movie. It was great! I recommend it!,1492560000,,102,4.722222222222222

8604341,4,B00EDVNHKW,"Especially, for a low(er) budget Film(i'm assuming), I think these guys did a really great job.(And i'm not just saying that because I love Brandon Hilton.) I think the premise of the Film is very strong and I found all of the subplots interesting. The point of entry of the film(the beginning) was also very effective (where Adam(Brandon's character) looks a lot more ""nerdy"" and then makes his transformation) and I'm very glad they added that. Without that scene, the Film would have lost a lot of necessary context and may have even been at risk of being ruined. But ,being nit picky here, there were some small Editing glitches here and there, where I think things were cut a little too fast.  But putting all issues aside, I had a great time  and enjoyed watching this movie and I would highly recommend it. (Especially for someone on the LGBTQ spectrum.)",1470009600,,861,4.695364238410596
8604342,1,B00EDVNHKW,"The three things I learned from this movie was that:
1) Talking to your high school bully for five minutes with him saying you are the poster boy for being the perfect student will so negatively impact you, the only logical thing to do is to change your entire personality and your image.
2) It is ok to have sex with a stalker when you are drunk and so high on drugs you can't even function as longh as you fall in love with them.
3) As long as you are true to yourself and who you are, you can blame everyone else for the problems that you helped cause.

This movie is a torture to sit through and watch.  The characters are flat and one dimensional with no growth. The actors provide no believability with their characters.  The plot line is ill conceived, reminding me more of a daytime soap opera than a movie while the dialogue is forced with no emotion behind it.

Overall, this movie is one of the worst I have seen and do not reccomend anyone to watch it.",1411862400,,964,4.2228260869565215
