8021191,4,B00023BLOE,"Noticed they have the wrong description.

It's about 3 highly skilled criminals parolled (with explosive collars) to help police.  Each of the three episodes focuses on one of the ""recruits"".  Good piece of sci-fi with some original ideas/concepts.  Characters are unique and entertaining.  Story lines are decent and thought out.",1109030400,5,330,5.52
