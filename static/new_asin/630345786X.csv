660027,2,630345786X,"This film won on Oscar for best screenplay in 1945.  This is probably more of a reflection of the attitudes expressed in the script than any artistry contained within.  I can see where the film would strike a chord with wartime audiences with it's portrait of Nazi agents operating freely within our borders.  Today, however, the film is just incredibly dated in it's depiction of an omnipotent FBI and cartoonish Nazis.  I would rate this film higher but it moves at such a snails pace that it borders on the sleep-inducing. William Eythe as Dietrich, the American double-agent, has to be one of the most wooden actors ever to star in a major motion picture.  He was definitely competing with the coat rack in the magnetism department.  If you must see this film see it as a wartime propaganda relic.  And remember, you can purchase your war bonds at the theatre.",1128729600,6,864,4.682119205298013
660028,4,630345786X,"In the aftermath of World War II, the Federal Bureau of Investigation cooperated with 20th Century Fox Studios and together they produced a docudrama that reveals one of the crimes committed by Nazi spies within United States borders.  In retrospect, it is alarming to discover the FBI's methods of acquiring information.  Pondering the FBI process of gathering data, paranoia materializes, as it, unfortunately, is one of the necessary tools for uncovering possible suspects.  Further contemplation will allow the audience to think of the errors of paranoia, which could harm innocents.  It is fortunate that the House on 92nd Street offers a genuine view of a real case that might have caused a completely different outcome of the war if the FBI did not solve it.  Thus, it is nice to see one of these films where the good guys were right unlike other cases such as the unpleasant internment of Japanese Americans and Black Listing of Hollywood filmmakers.

In the beginning the audience is introduced to some facts about the film.  These details include the notions that the film is shot on location of the crimes, many of the actors actually are real FBI agents (this might be why some scenes feel very awkward, as the acting feels acted in some instances), and that this information could not have been released until after the drop of the first atomic bomb.  Consequently, the film moves into a visual and verbal narrative mode that describes some examples of how the FBI accumulated a wealth of information prior the United States entry into the war and the training of FBI agents.  Despite the rigorous training to find the truth, the truth tends to emerge through accidents.  The Christopher case on which the film is based came to the attention of the FBI through such an accident by foreign spies.  Nonetheless, the film continues to move in its intended direction of informing the audience about a successful prevention of major espionage.

The Christopher case follows the engineer William Dietrich who was approached by Germans, which he reported to the FBI. Dietrich's involvement made him a perfect double spy for the Americans, as he sought what plans the Germans had for him.  Through Dietrich a remarkable tale of spying appears and what makes it more interesting is that it is entirely based on a true story.  The story is portrayed through strong patriotic faithfulness, which makes the film feel a little too much like a propaganda film from the FBI.  In addition, the upbeat atmosphere removes the ominous mood of film noir that the film attempts to establish, and instead leaves the audience with a highly predictable, yet intriguing cinematic journey.

The House on the 92nd Street should not be approached like a film noir, as the story is more a reenactment of a true story and never provides the dark world of most noir.  Instead the film provides a fascinating docudrama that sustains the audience's attention from the beginning to the end through the FBI's approach to a fascinating case.  Sure, some scenes feel awkward in regard to the role performances, but this can be overlooked, as the story is more captivating.  In the end, the film offers a unique historical perspective of the mid 1940s FBI, which offers a terrific cinematic experience.",1127260800,5,3277,4.936247723132969
660029,4,630345786X,"This review is for the 2005 Twentieth Century Fox DVD

The opening of the movie reveals that this story is ""adapted"" from actual FBI investigations during World War II.  The synopsis of the film is that in the late 1930's there were a significant amount of spies living in the United States working for the German government.  During this era, the FBI was in charge of investigating these international spies and used the latest surveillance and crime technology along with infiltrating these spy rings with double agents.  Lloyd Nolan stars as one the lead FBI investigators and William Eythe co-stars as an undercover German spy working for the FBI.  The ring of German spies, headed by a beautiful German agent played by Signe Hasso, were attempting to infiltrate America's most sensitive military project: the Manhattan Project.  The headquarters for this spy ring is an apartment house on 92nd Street in New York.

I thoroughly enjoyed this film as the story had lots suspenseful moments and a decent amount of twists and turns down to the very last scene.  I think one significant problem with this film that kept it from being a truly great film is that it was heavily narrated and used a lot of FBI stock footage instead of using dramatic studio characters to present the story.  In essence it is a very well done semi-fictional espionage film presented in a documentary-style format.  It's not really a noir film, as hyped by Fox Studios, but a very entertaining movie nonetheless.

The B&W picture quality is very good but far from outstanding.  A lot of stock FBI footage is used and is clearly not of the same quality, especially in sharpness of Hollywood productions from the same era.  There are also tiny specs of film deterioration that can be noticed throughout the movie.  The audio is satisfactory.  The bonuses include real-time commentary by Eddie Muller, a photo gallery and the original press booklet.

660030,5,630345786X,"I have always had a soft spot for this flick.  To my knowledge it was the first to combine documentary and dramatic action in what is today done routinely, often cheesely, on cable channels. There are no relationships established or explored (not one kiss), no characters developed, this is all exposition, expertly and classily done. What acting there is, is sharp, to the point, and full of conviction.  What a pleasure to see Lloyd Noland and Signe Hasso, projecting absolute integrity as the unambiguously good and the irredeamably bad, both equally effective at what they do. One would have no problem trusting such a cop or fearing such a spy. The movie is obvious FBI propaganda,  even J.Edgar Hoover makes an appearance, but neither message nor method is ever offensive. The country was cheerily victorious in 1945 and one has to be truly morally stingy to deny its secret police a movie-screen cheer for its assistance in securing victory. The movie is also interesting as a historical artifact: it reveals tricks of the trade c. 1945 such as two-way mirrors, invisible writings, IBM card-file match machines, filming of suspects, encrypted postage stamps, micro-film credentials. Were audiences surprised by these back then?

The DVD transfer is of a very high quality.

Historically, German espionage in America was rather inept.  Far more interesting, we now know, from Venona intercepts and USSR archives, were Soviet schemes to penetrate the Manhattan Project and the highest levels of American foreign policy making.  Stalin already knew of the success of Trinity when Truman shared it with him and Churchill in the Potsdam conference in 1945.  The misdeeds of Klaus Fuchs, the Rosenbergs, Alger Hiss, and the like could provide fodder for interesting movies now that we have firmer grasp of what went on.",1126310400,39,1820,5.104377104377105
660031,4,630345786X,"The House on 92nd Street was one of the first Hollywood films to incorporate a semi-documentary edge to the noir/crime genre.  The film's technical accuracy is authenticated by actual FBI archive footage of Nazi subversives and location shooting at FBI headquaters in Washington.  For  the first time ever, J. Edgar Hoover's dictatorial  organization is  depicted as an organized, structured, and efficient government institution  whose existence and purpose is to preserve and protect national security.  Hoover allowed director Henry Hathaway unprecendented access to film FBI  secret equipment such as: two-way mirrors, video surveillance cameras, wire  tapping lines, and a demonstration of the immense fingerprinting tracking  system. Hoover gave his stamp of approval since the film justified the  Bureau's stand and actions against possible covert foreign operations  infiltrating America's military, political, economic, and educational  systems.  The film was released in 1945, weeks after the atomic bombing of  Japan and the plot revolves around Nazi spies and their quest for  information about ultra-secret plans dubbed Project 97.  Project 97  obviously refered to the Manhattan Project which was the actual government  code name given for the construction of the atomic bomb.  Dark European  mannerisms flood the film, as  evidenced by Hathaway's judicious choice in  casting.  Swedish actress Signe Hasso is nefariously convincing as the Nazi  spy ring's mastermind.  With the exception of Leo G. Carroll, the remaining  subversives are undertaken by unknown players.  Their anonymity to the  average American film buff heightens their deviousness and subterfuge.  Lydia St. Clair is absolutely chilling in her small but malevolent role as  a Nazi loyalist.  The cast is rounded out by newcomer William Eythe and the  dependable Lloyd Nolan who is perfectly cast once again as the paternal  figure for American justice.  The disappointment is Eythe whose lines are  delivered blandly.  The film's cinematography is true noir. Shadows seem to  move between every contrast of black and white.  This is a must see for all  classic noir lovers.",957225600,24,2156,5.595015576323988

660129,4,630345786X,"The House on Ninety-Second Street, 1945 film

This story is adapted from cases in the FBI files. The scenes are from actual places in most cases. The FBI started building up its personnel in 1939. They checked all mail to suspected German agents, and filmed everyone who visited their Embassy in Washington. They learned they were recruiting Americans as agents. One of them, William Dietrich, started working for the FBI. A German agent had an accident (fell or pushed?) And his belongings were given to the FBI. Cryptanalysts deciphered a message about Process 97, the top secret scientific research project of WW II. The Manhattan Engineering District?

Double agent Dietrich returned to America. His microfilmed authorization was quickly forged to allow him more powers. Dietrich visited the house on 92nd Street (the Yorkville district) and presented himself to Elsa Gephardt. (His authority was questioned as it was against Standard Operating Procedures.) The film shows surveillance in those days: conversations are recorded on phonograph records. (The story about re-transmitted radio messages implies the Germans had no records of Dietrichs telegraphy style or fist.) There is a meeting where a drunk talks too much; they take care of him so he will tell no tales. There is an important message about Process 97. This leads the FBI to investigate hundreds of people at that secret site. The guilty parties are discovered and their contacts identified. But a new message from Hamburg provided the original authorization! Dietrichs cover is blown. Elsa Gephardt uses scopolamine to get Dietrich to talk. The FBI arrives in time to stop and arrest them. There is a surprise in the identification of Mr. Christopher. [Would that disguise really fool observers?] The ironic ending seems weak. The secret of Process 97 was kept. No known events of enemy sabotage occurred during WW II. The FBI did a perfect job.

This story shows that the FBI was able to change microfilmed typewritten documents by 1941! No mention of the film used. A few years later they would claim this was impossible (the Hiss Case). Lloyd Nolan previously was in the Michael Shayne Private Detective movies.",1459555200,,2184,5.146478873239436

660208,3,630345786X,"The House on 92nd Street won rave reviews when it was released in 1945; indeed, it won an Oscar for Best Original Story.  To me, almost seven decades later, the award seems a travesty. A pedantic, monotonous and predictable waste of an hour and half, it holds interest primarily because of its documentary style via producer Louis De Rochemont and director Henry Hathaway. Some of the actors portraying FBI agents really were FBI agents -- J. Edgar Hoover himself appears briefly, though not speaking. We also get some very interesting views of presumed Bureau archives: Vast rooms of file cabinets, tended by clerks, along with electro-mechanical wonders such as a punch card sorter. Interesting stuff. Far more interesting than the unremarkable spy story that the film relates. Lead actor William Eythe is wooden, and while Lloyd Nolan is fine as the chief FBI investigator, he hasn't much of a script to work with. Leo G. Carroll does carve out a fine little corner for himself as an informer for Berlin, and the whole gang of Nazi spies is played by a wonderful lot -- including Harry Bellaver, Elizabeth Neumann-Viertel, Harro Meller, Alfred Linder -- who seem lifted directly from an old Fritz Lang crime or espionage film. Sadly, the largely uneventful screenplay pulls them down as well. The big mystery is the identity of ""Mr. Christopher,"" but after a while one can almost guess the solution. Otherwise, look for E.G. Marshall in, I believe, his first film appearance, uncredited as a morgue assistant. There's a fair amount of talent in this picture, but the story -- with that ironic Oscar -- makes it largely for nothing. I do love those big file cabinets, though.",1373846400,2,1677,4.904929577464789
660209,3,630345786X,"""The House on 92nd Street,"" (1945), an 88 minute, black and white American thriller from the immediate postwar period, is a crime drama/ spy story with many claims to fame.  The mystery has been classified as a film noir, which it is not, although it is in black and white, and does boast some deeply black scenes; perhaps it's best considered as an influential pre-film noir.  It was written by Barre Lyndon and Charles G. Booth, directed by Henry Hathaway, and produced by Louis de Rochement, who did similar honors for the ""March of Time"" newsreels that used to be played in movie houses before the features.  It pioneered the semi-documentary look in American filmmaking, which the public loved, and turned out for in droves.  The same team of Hathaway and Rochemont would shortly make another semi-documentary address film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/13-Rue-Madeleine/dp/B00008AOTM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">13 Rue Madeleine</a>, which would be followed by a boomlet of address-named films, and semi-documentary pictures.  And, similarly to 13 RUE MADELEINE, it is a ""now it can be told"" picture, held back until the end of World War II, so as not to give any information to the Germans and their allies, our enemies at the time.

Similarly to a newsreel, the film opens with a stentorian voiceover from an announcer who sounds true-blue Federal Bureau of Investigation.  He tells us that in the war years of 1939-41, America was overrun with German agents - the Axis powers suspected something was up, and it was.  (Russian agents were also very active at the time, for the same reason, but this picture does not touch on that aspect of the war.)  A fatal New York City taxi accident has occurred; during its investigation, the FBI discovers that the victim was a Nazi spy.  Enter Bill Dietrich, a handsome young German-American post-graduate engineering student.  The film tells us that the Nazis recruited him after he had visited Hamburg; the internet based Internet Movie Data base (IMDb) tells us that the actual man on whom this character was based was German-born; the facts were changed quietly at the request of the FBI.  At any rate, Dietrich goes to the FBI and agrees to be a double agent.  Handily enough, Dietrich is assigned to break the New York spy ring, and to find the mysterious, ruthless Mr. Christopher.

The movie is based on fact to a very great degree, according to IMDb. ""The scene near the beginning of the film where a man is killed by a car is based on a real-life incident.  The victim was identified as Julio Lopez Lido but was in actuality Capt. Ulrich von der Osten, a Nazi army officer in the Abwehr (German military intelligence). He was struck and killed by a cab on March 18, 1941, and his body went unclaimed for a time. The man who ran from the scene was actually Kurt Frederick Ludwig, known as Joseph K, a German agent who was eventually caught and sentenced to Alcatraz Prison. He was deported in 1953. The cab driver who hit von der Osten was a man named Sam Lichtman."" Furthermore, there was the Duquesne spy ring headed by Frederick Joubert Duquesne; the infamous Ritter case, and the work of real life double agent William G. Sebold. Finally, the early surveillance footage of the 92nd Street house and the perpetrator walks at the film's conclusion are real footage of Nazi agents.

Moreover, according to IMDb, ""The movie deals with the theft by German spies of the fictional 'Process 97,' a secret formula which, the narrator tells us, 'was crucial to the development of the atomic bomb.' The movie was released on September 10, 1945, only a month after the atomic bombs had been dropped on Japan, and barely a week after Japan's formal surrender. While making the film, the actors and director Henry Hathaway did not know that the atomic bomb existed, or that it would be incorporated as a story element in the movie. (None of the actors in the film mentions the atomic bomb.) However, co-director/producer ...  De Rochemont ... and narrator Reed Hadley were both involved in producing government films on the development of the atomic bomb. (Hadley was present at the final test of the bomb in Los Alamos, New Mexico, in July, 1945.) After the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, Hadley and screenwriter John Monks Jr. hastily wrote some additional voice-over narration linking ""Process 97"" to the atomic bomb, and Rochemont inserted it into the picture in time for the film's quick release.""  The film's makers also tried to ""film where it actually happened,"" which, in the case of this movie, meant in the inimitably gritty wartime New York City.  The house on 92nd Street actually existed - although on 93rd Street.  (It has now been demolished.)

So why is the film so little-known?  Several well-known actors were used in the film, and several made their debuts here.  But the protagonist was played by William Eythe, a man with some charm, and Tyrone Power-like square jaws and strong black eyebrows.  But, unfortunately, Eythe had an inconsequential film career; see bit parts in THE OX-BOW INCIDENT, THE SONG OF BERNADETTE, ON A WING AND A PRAYER, and was quite short-lived himself.

660247,4,630345786X,"Before and during WWII, there were many sympathizers all over the world with the aims and results of Nazi social and economic ideas.  There were also in the thousands many in sympathy with the aims and results of Communist Russia's social and economic programs.  Witchhunts began long before the ""McCarthy Era"".  The latter group were considered the more dangerous in advocating the abolishment of private property and overtaking the US Government, mostly with Moscow funding of agents here in USA, Russian immigrants or otherwise.

In the USA, the FBI had already decided that these Nazi sympathizers were of danger to the USA, most being of course German immigrants.  Using hidden film cameras, hidden microphones, and so on, upon the date of the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the FBI rounded up over 16,000 suspects during the war, interned or deported them.  This was quite separate from the FDR order to incarcinate 128,000 men, women and children of Japanese descent on the West Coast, considered spies and collaborators.

This 1945 film was produced and then released a month before the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima.  The actors and staff did not know about the bomb, referred to in the film as ""Project 97"".  The director was informed.

I can only speak for myself,that it was enjoyable as presented in documentary form, very seriously discussing international concerns, showing the real streets and buildings and pedestrians and cars of 1945 New York City.  The film's title refers to the address where a Nazi spy ring of German immigrants lived and worked, with others coming to that house for meetings.

A brilliant young American man, with German heritage and language, is approached by the group to spy with them.  He goes to the FBI with his knowledge, and they propose he go along with their proposal, off to Hamburg, get his spy training there, and when he comes back, operate as a double agent.  Quite a challenge!  Dietrich is up to it; having studied diesel engineering, he returns to New York and opens a consultant's office, from which he will do his spy work.

It's interesting to see all the women working the long, long files of the FBI headquarters, everything done by typing and notetaking, in endless stacks of file cabinets.  Women worked as the codebreakers, clerks, and many other paper-related jobs.  Men were at the top,but it seemed to be predominantly young women at work.

These shots were made in the real locations, so although it's somewhat fictionalized, it comes across as very real and very frightening.  But we see that the FBI is quick and able and on the ball, oh yes, with their hidden cameras and microphones, vans planted outside suspects' homes, etc.

The plot gets more tense,of course, as the spies don't trust each other, and in the end,there's a surprise twist about the big leader of the ring, with our dear Dietrich almost dead in his valiant attempt to save us from the Nazis.

But there's no doubt in watching this that any government can be excellent witchhunters, given the money and political will.  How many of these ""spies"" were very normal citizens, earning a few extra bucks to fink on neighbors or deliver notes and packages?  The low-end spy world was rounded up quickly; the big boys were left to operate at will,to lead the FBI further in to the top of the rings.

Interesting that even today, with the Cold War behind us and the Commies defeated, we have to still deport Russian spies, as was done last year in Brooklyn.  Chinese spies are our next great worry.  But don't worry folks!  The g-men'll get'em.",1363305600,,3578,4.830870279146141

660250,3,630345786X,"The House of 92nd Street is a 1945 black and white documentary style spy thriller concerning Nazi spy efforts to obtain A-bomb secrets, and the efforts of the FBI to apprehend them. It was based on a real FBI case.

Handsome William Eythe (1918-57) plays a college student recruited by the Nazis who becomes an FBI counter agent. Virtually unknown today, Eythe made a dozen films in the 40s (""Ox Bow Incident"", ""Song of Bernadette"") and then transitioned to theatre and TV in the 50s.

Pretty Signe Hasso (1915-2002) plays a Nazi agent and Eythe's contact. She began her film career in Sweden as a child actor, then transitioned to the U.S. in the 40s in films like ""Heaven can Wait"" (1943) and ""Seventh Cross"" (1944). In the 50s she moved to TV and theatre. This was her biggest role and she does a great job.

Dependable Lloyd Nolan (1902-85) plays FBI agent George Briggs, a role he would reprise in ""The Street with No Name"" (1948). Nolan appeared in more than 100 films between 1925 and 1986. He moved between TV and films and was nominated twice for an Emmy, winning for playing Captain Queeg in a 1955 version of ""The Caine Mutiny"". He never achieved A list status, but always turned in good performances, and in this film he gets second billing.

Versatile Gene Lockhart (1891-1957) has a small role playing a scientist supplying information to the Nazis.  Lockhart appeared in more than 100 films and was nominated as Best Supporting Actor in 1939 for ""Algiers"" (won by Walter Brennan for ""Kentucky""). The father of actresses Kathleen and June Lockhart, he's best remembered for his role as the judge in ""Miracle on 34th Street"" (1947), but I remember him best as Bob Cratchit in ""A Christmas Carol"" (1938).

Leo G. Carroll (1892-1972) plays a Nazi agent. Carroll appeared in 6 Hitchcock films, an accomplishment exceeded by only one other actor. Carroll is best known for his TV series ""Topper"" (1953-6) and ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."" (1964-8) but he gave excellent performances in more than 50 films, including ""A Christmas Carol"" (1938), Wuthering Heights"" (1938), and ""The Desert Fox"" (1951).

Harry Bellaver (1905-93) plays a cab driver who doubles as a Nazi. Bellaver started in films in 1938 and made dozens of films. He's best remembered as Detective Frank Arcaro from ""Naked City"" (1958-63).

This is the film debut of Paul Ford (1901-76), E.G. Marshall (1914-98) and Vincent Gardenia. Look closely to find them. Among other things, Ford would become famous as the hilarious Col. Hall on ""The Phil Silvers Show"" (1955-9), E.G. Marshall for ""The Defenders"" (1961-5), and Vincent Gardenia as Detective Ochoa in the ""Death Wish"" films.

Director Henry Hathaway (1898-1985)  is usually associated with westerns and especially with John Wayne. Hathaway and Wayne worked together on 6 films, including ""Shepherd of the Hills"" (1941), ""North to Alaska"" (1960), and ""Sons of Katie Elder"" (1965). Hathaway specialized in westerns from his earliest films - ""Heritage of the Desert"" (1932), ""Wild Horse Mesa"" (1932) - to his later films - ""5 Card Stud"" (1968) and ""Shootout"" (1971). Along with John Ford and Howard Hawks, he was a master of the western, although curiously enough his only nomination for an Oscar was for ""Lives of a Bengal Lancer"" (1935). It was Hathaway who directed ""True Grit"" (1969), the western that won Wayne his only Oscar. Here in the 1940s Hathaway dabbled in film noir, with such classics as ""13 Rue Madeleine"" (1945), ""Call Northside 777"" (1948), and my favorite Hathaway noir ""Niagara"" (1953).

Norbert Brodine is the cameraman. He was nominated for an Oscar 3 times, and won an Emmy for ""Letter to Loretta"" (1953). He filmed more than 100 films including James Mason as ""The Desert Fox"" (1951), Howard Hawks' ""I Was a Male War Bride"" (1949), Victor Mature's ""One Million BC"" (1941), and ""Of Mice and Men"" (1939).

The NY Times said the film ""barely skims the surface of our counterespionage operations, but it reveals sufficient of the FBI's modus operandi to be intriguing on that score alone."" It won an Oscar for Best Writing for Charles Booth (1896-1949).

FWIW - The film debuted after the A bomb had been dropped, but at the time the film was being made, no one knew that such a bomb existed. ""Process 97"" is the formula spoken of in the film itself. Interestingly enough, the producer (Louis De Rochemont) was in charge of making newsreels for the Government, and was aware of the bomb, so the story was developed in such a  way that no secret was revealed but in anticipation of the bomb's existence.

1945 was not a banner year for films. The top grossing films were ""Mom and Dad"", ""The Bells of St. Mary's"", ""Leave Her to Heaven"", ""Spellbound"", and ""Anchors Aweigh."" The big Oscar and Golden Globe winner was ""The Lost Weekend"" (Picture, Director, Actor). Notable films released that year included: Joan Crawford's Oscar winning ""Mildred Pierce"" and film noir classic ""Scarlett Street"".

War films were reasonably popular - John Wayne in ""Back to Bataan"" and ""They Were Expendable"", Boyer and Bacall in ""Confidential Agent"", Errol Flynn in ""Objective Burma"", John  Garfield in ""Pride of the Marines"", Burgess Meredith and Robert Mitchum in ""The Story of GI Joe"", and ""A Walk in the Sun"".

The film is more or less your standard spy thriller, which coming in 1945 adds little more than the earlier spy films (e.g., ""Confessions of a Nazi Spy"", ""Night Train to Munich"", etc.). Since this was one of the first films to adopt a semi-documentary style, it is noteworthy for that reason. It is also noteworthy as one of the first films to use on location filming (in this case New York City) which started a trend that continues to this day.

PS - Please note, almost nothing about this film qualifies it for the label of ""film noir"" even though the film is included in ""Fox Film Noir"" collection. Perhaps Hathaway's other films in that era got it mistakenly included.",1307232000,5,5908,4.843253968253968
660251,5,630345786X,"This is an excellent movie of it's time & style.

Most assuredly it is a bald face propaganda film but in the context of what was acceptable in the 1940's & 1950's, when I grew up it, is very entertaining.

Today with what we know about J. Edgar Hoover it is even more interesting. What propaganda! Just look at all those people in Washington DC FBI HQ who today are all replaced by computers. Check out the 1945 version of NCIS and CSI forensic investigation.

Signe Hasso is stunning though quite evil in this film. I would like to see something else she may have done in english language films.

Great shots of NYC when there were few, if any, towers on the upper east side. Just imagine what the rent would be on The House on 92nd St. at todays rates.

As for the performances:
An excellent character is portrayed by Harry Bellavar, later of TV's ""Naked City"". There are two small bits by later character stars E.G. Marshall and VIncent Gardenia [Bronson's foil in ""Death Wish""]
Above all, the unique charm of Signe Hasso, seen all too  rarely by American audiences- a compelling villainess in an era of male-dominated pro- and antagonist.

Not withstanding the propaganda element of the script and especially the narrative portion [ necessary to secure FBI support, no doubt], the dialogue itself is totally economical and germane to the situation.

I count this among no more than 10 films of the era I would cheerfully own and view frequently.",1298332800,5,940,5.032258064516129
660253,4,630345786X,"A World WarII spy story, released in 1945 and taking place around the beginning of the war, this is apparently based on two separate spy cases, melded into one.  Bill Dietrich (William Eythe) is a German-American recruited by the Nazis before the war as a spy - but unbeknownst to them he's a double agent all along, working in reality for Lloyd Nolan's Agent Briggs character.  Nolan would play a character with the same name in another Fox noir, three years later, William Keighley's THE STREET WITH NO NAME.  The plot in this one basically involves Dietrich as the center of an operation with intentions of smuggling American atomic secrets out of the country.  Dietrich is the money man, sent from Hamburg after several months training to New York to contact various agents, collect information, and relay it back to the Nazis.  Of course his real plan is to find out as much as he can about the German operation and bust it once he finds the head man, a mysterious ""Mr. Christopher"" who seems impossible to track down.

Filmed on location in New York, with lots of establishing shots in Hamburg and D.C. (FBI Headquarters), this was one of the first ""documentary"" - style crime or spy films.  Calling it film noir is something of a stretch I think (and so does commentator Eddie Muller); Dietrich is unquestionably a hero and the Germans are all fairly two-dimensional Bad Guys - there's nothing much in the way of a noirish moral dilemma here, and even the lighting and setups are more conventional and betray very few noir conceits, with a few nice exceptions like a seedy bar sequence where Dietrich has to deal with a drunken lout intent on exposing the Germans' whole plan before the FBI is ready.

Still, it's a pretty solid film, if derailed somewhat by the regular, monotonous narration which serves not just to let the clueless in the audience know what's going on, but also to reassure us that everything will turn out all right.  After all, if we keep getting reminded that this is a ""true story"", we're going to be pretty sure that it's a true story that turned out right - the FBI wouldn't very well be letting negative propaganda about itself out while the war was still technically going on.  Nolan is his typical competent authority figure and he's fine; Eythe, a minor star for a short while, doesn't make an enormous impression as Dietrich but he's OK as well; female German agents Signe Hasso and Lydia St. Clair offer some vaguely kinky menace (with St. Clair always wearing a leather jacket and having a slight lesbian air about her).  It's old pro Leo G. Carroll as Dietrich's best contact Colonel Hammersohn who makes the best impression, seeming to turn his typically kindly professorial air into an aura of menace with only the slightest change in attitude and expression.  Nicely done, old man.

The disc decent enough transfer of the film, accompanied as by Eddie Muller's always-excellent and informative commentary; while not among the greatest of films noir by any means (if you want to even consider it one) this is certainly important in the development of the documentary-style drama-thriller, and for its early emphasis on location work.",1277510400,2,3176,4.7842778793418645
660254,4,630345786X,"This film, although part of the ""Fox Film Noir Collection"" is emphatically not a noir.  (I'm joined in this assertion by noir specialist Eddie Muller, as stated in his commentary).  But it IS a good film, well paced, and quite watchable.  It is also, Muller mentions, the first docu-drama, and had some influence on how film noir developed; especially, the use of location shooting.  Here, we are actually taken inside the F.B.I. offices and shown, in documentary style, the tricks of their trade; such as their surveillance techniques and fingerprint archives.

The plot of the film centers on the F.B.I.'s protection of the Atomic Bomb formula (Process 97), from Fifth Columnist spies, before it was unleashed on Japan.  But as Henry Hathaway directed it, there is no mention of the Bomb itself; only the fictional ""Process 97"".  The Bomb, and it's association with Process 97, was later added in by producer Louis De Rochemont, who was also responsible for the ""March of Time"" news series.  The bomb was dropped on Hiroshima about a month before 92nd STREET's release, and Louis simply added the newly enhanced plot-line into the voice-over narration.  Pretty slick.

The performances are all very good, and the fact that many of the actors are not well known adds to the documentary feel.  In my opinion, a fun film for espionage buffs.",1269129600,3,1340,4.9375
660255,3,630345786X,"It's a good idea to buy the DVD of this movie and listen to the commentary by Film Noir expert Eddie Muller. You'll find out that yes, 'The House on 92nd Street' is based on two actual cases in the FBI's file concerning German spies during World War II. However you'll also discover that the story is very loosely based on those cases. So loosely that no German agent even came close to stealing the film's MacGuffin (""Process 97""), the 'formula' for creating the atomic bomb.

One of the best things about this picture is the on location photography. According to the DVD commentary, filming on location was difficult in those days, particularly due to the bulky sound equipment they had to carry around. This was the first time that the sound equipment was carried around in smaller suitcases and it made it much easier for the technical crew to shoot the movie.

If you live in New York City as I do, you'll get a kick out of seeing how some of the neighborhoods looked back in 1945. My favorite scene is right before we enter the beauty shop--there's a shot looking uptown on Broadway and you can see the elevated #1 train at the 125th Street stop. I can tell you that the train stop hasn't changed much at all (you probably can guess that I live right nearby). Although it appears that Tieman Place, which is one street south of 125th Street, appears to extend to the east. Today, the street goes as far as Broadway, since the Grant Housing Projects are now in the way.

Eddie Muller argues that 'The House on 92nd Street' is really not a film noir and I agree with him. You can thank the producer, Louis De Rochement. He was responsible for all those March of Time documentaries in the 30s and made the first widely-seen anti-Nazi documentary, ""Inside Nazi Germany"" in 1938. De Rochement teamed up with J. Edgar Hoover and half of 'The House on 92nd Street' is narrated in the style of those old newsreels. This tends to take away from the film noir feel and makes the film seem more like a propaganda exercise for Hoover and the FBI, then a drama with an uninterrupted arc.

That's not to say that some of the 'newsreel' scenes aren't interesting. They use the actual footage filmed by the FBI across the street from the German Embassy and you can see all these Nazis coming and going with their Seig Heil salutes! Equally impressive is the massive fingerprint file room at the FBI. Hoover bragged that the FBI had over 1,000,000 fingerprints on file during the War. Muller argues that this was an exaggeration. Nonetheless, when you see inside FBI headquarters, you will be impressed.

'The House on 92nd Street' is the story of a young American born college student of German ancestry, Bill Dietrich, who's recruited by the FBI to infiltrate a German spy ring (principally in New York City before and during World War II), which is on the verge of stealing the aforementioned 'Process 97'. He's played by Tyrone Power look-a-like, William Eythe, who tragically died at the young age of 38.

The 'inciting incident' occurs when a German operative is hit by a car and killed near Bowling Green in NYC. He blurts out a clue--the name of a shadowy and elusive figure by the name of 'Mr. Christopher'. Throughout the film, the FBI director Briggs (played by the ubiquitous and dependable Lloyd Nolan) is seeking to find out who this Mr. Christopher is.

Dietrich ends up infiltrating the Nazi spy ring. The sinister characters that make up the spy ring keep the story fairly absorbing. Focus on Signe Hasso as Elsa Gebhartdt, Lydia St. Clair as Johanna Schmidt and Gene Lockhart as the man with the amazing memory, Charles Roper. In addition to Lloyd Nolan, you'll probably recognize Leo G. Carroll, famous for the Topper TV series in the 50s and The Man from Uncle in the 60s (not to mention all the Hitchcock films he was in!).

There are a few nifty noorish scenes that crop up in '92nd Street'. One particularly memorable one is when the Nazi spies bump off one of their own informants who can't hold his liquor. They dump him down at the train tracks where presumably a train will soon run over his body.

'92nd Street' loses its verisimilitude during the film's climax. Dietrich is found by the gang and taken to the house on 92nd Street where they give him 'truth serum' and hope to make him talk. He seems immune to the powerful drug so Gebhardt is about to shoot him with a silencer when the FBI bursts in and shoots her and captures the rest of the ring. Of course it never happened that way (the real spies were discreetly rounded up without any fanfare).

'92nd Street' also focuses quite a bit on the technology of the time. Audiences back then must have been thrilled to see the remarkably new 'see through mirrors' and special chemicals that reveal watermarks on ordinary letters.

Unfortunately, all the documentary realism and propaganda undercuts the main drama. Most noirs focus on the main character all the time but here, Dietrich, sometimes disappears for long stretches of the narrative (here, the main character shares equal billing with a bigger star: The FBI!).

'The House on 92nd Street' is quite an interesting docudrama--more instructive as a document of its times than as successful drama. Watch it once and then again with the DVD commentary. After that, put it on the shelf!",1236988800,4,5311,4.644302449414271

660321,5,630345786X,"""The House on 92nd Street"" -- the first film made with the cooperation of the FBI -- tells the story of the FBI's bust of a Nazi spy ring who'd tried to steal the plans for the atomic bomb. The hero, Bill Dietrich, is an American of German ancestry who was approached by the Nazis to spy for their regime.  Instead, he volunteers his services to the FBI and becomes a double-agent.  After training at a Nazi school in Hamburg, Dietrich returns to the US as paymaster and radioman for the Nazi spy faction operating in New York.  This group, run by the hard-as-nails Elsa, controls other agents and informants and, in turn, is controlled by the mysterious ""Mr. Christopher"".  The intriguing and fast-paced story leads to a surprise ending that does not disappoint.

This film was the first-ever ""semi-documentary.""  It has aspects of a documentary: true-life footage inside FBI headquarters, genuine footage of Nazis in the US and their arrests, and G-men playing for the screen the same roles they took in solving the actual crime. The plot is interrupted, now and then, by documentary-like stentorian narration.  It is, however, a dramatization and the screenwriters took minor liberties with the facts (i.e., certain of the actual villains were married.)  It can also be seen as a commercial for the FBI, and 1945 audiences no doubt were left with a gee-whiz feeling when they saw the footage of the largest file room in the United States, with its millions of fingerprints; the detailed files on all potentially-troublesome foreigners (supposedly rounded up in one day); the FBI's one-way glass mirrors; the elaborate shortwave radio set-ups and the like.  Those who have seen episodes of ""The FBI"" have seen this sort of thing before, but it was designed to awe (and reassure) the film's post-war audience and jolt America's enemies.

The DVD includes erudite commentary by film noir historian  Eddie Muller.  As Muller points out, this film is not an actual noir.  Rather than focusing on one individual and his reactions as events close in on him (think ""Sorry, Wrong Number,"" or ""Crossfire"") this is a straightforward account.  Indeed, much of the plot is driven by the desire to show off the technology.  That does not mean that the plot is not extremely engaging -- it is.  The actors, including the minor actors, do a terrific job.  It is very easy to overplay evil spies so that they almost become caricatures (there is a ""we have ways of making you talk"" scene) but overall, they do a fine job with the material. And the direction and photography are first rate.

Watch the film once through, then watch it with the insightful commentary.  Take a look at the press book (included) and the photos.  I recommend it highly.",1151193600,17,2732,4.834408602150537
660322,4,630345786X,"""The House on 92nd Street"" was the first ""docudrama"", ushering in a quasi-documentary style of filmmaking that would be prominent among film noirs and thrillers of the 1940s and early 1950s.  In this case, the story has a factual basis. The real cases of the Hans Ritter and Frederick Duquesne German spy rings, from the files of the FBI, have been composited and fictionalized to create an archetypal story of the FBI's fight against German espionage during World War II. Producer Louis de Rochemont obtained unprecedented cooperation from the FBI to the extent that the filmmakers were even allowed the use of FBI surveillance vehicles to inconspicuously photograph the streets of New York, and FBI surveillance film is included in the movie. This was the first film to be shot on location in the streets of New York City -new camera technologies were developed for the purpose- as well as inside the FBI's facilities in Washington, D.C. and Quantico, Virginia. Many of the federal agents in the film are portrayed by real FBI agents.

In 1939, an American diesel engineering student named William Dietrich (William Eythe) is offered a job by German agents. Dietrich reports the incident to the FBI, which engages him as a double agent. After completing espionage training in Hamburg, Germany, Dietrich returns to the United States and makes contact with a ring of German spies led by Elsa Gebhardt (Signe Hasso), answering to a mysterious superior called ""Mr. Christopher"". Around the same time, a German agent killed in an auto accident is found to be carrying a note that says, ""Mr. Christopher will concentrate on Process 97."" Since ""Process 97"" refers to the top secret A-bomb program, the threat to national security is serious. Inspector Briggs (Lloyd Nolan) of the FBI is assigned ""The Christopher Case"". Keeping in communication with Dietrich, who is entrusted with transmitting the critical information to Germany, and conducting close surveillance of the nuclear research facility, Briggs hopes to identify the traitor who is leaking the sensitive information.

The real ""William Dietrich"" was a German-American named William Sebold who did, indeed, work as a radio transmitter for Germany and a double agent for the U.S.. The cases upon which this film is based did not involve nuclear secrets, however. ""The House on 92nd Street"" is sometimes misidentified as ""film noir"", though it couldn't be farther from the noir sensibility. This is an extroverted, straightforward propaganda film whose primary purpose was to justify the FBI's domestic surveillance, its increase in staff from 2,000 to 15,000, and the internment of thousands of ""dangerous enemy aliens"" (mostly Japanese Americans), all at the taxpayers' expense. The film's second agenda is to take the audience into the clandestine world of spies, double-agents, and the cutting-edge technology used by law enforcement to protect the national security during the war. This is where the film excels, giving the audience a tantalizing tour of a subculture that few Americans knew much about. Characters take a backseat to all of this, and they are really one-dimensional, existing only to further our understanding -or opinion- of the covert war.

The DVD (20th Century Fox 2005): Bonus features include trailers for 4 ""Fox Noir"" films, a ""Photo Gallery"" slideshow of 27 movie and publicity stills, an ""Original Press Book"" with more than 20 ads and articles from the film's original release (zoom in to read the articles), and an informative audio commentary by film noir historian Eddie Muller. Muller would be the first to say that ""The House on 92nd Street"" is not film noir. He explains which aspects of the story are real and which are fictitious, discusses the film's politics, cast, themes, performances, and Louis de Rochemont's role in its creation. Subtitles for the film are available in English and Spanish. Dubbing is available in Spanish.",1149897600,3,3924,5.1748031496063
660323,3,630345786X,"The film follows through an FBI case regarding German spies in New York City stealing information about the making of the atomic bomb.  At the time, the semi-documentary style of the movie was groundbreaking and influential.  The film does provide an interesting (although obviously entirely uncritical) look at FBI proceedings, but, in terms of film noir, its quite disappointing. Star William Eythe is very dull and his character is very uprighteous.  He never doubts his actions for a second.  There is also no femme fatale to entice him.  (Signe Hasso does make a good impression as the villain.) And, given the docu-drama style, the film lacks the visual games between lights and shadows that have come to define what we regard as film noir.  (There are no lights peeping through the blinds here.) I enjoyed the film and was glad to see it, but quite frankly I don't think I'll ever watch it again.",1142899200,3,903,4.8311688311688314
660324,4,630345786X,"I remembered the name and the theme of the movie but nothing else. I love espionage, mysteries, detective stories so I decided to order it. It is  amazing to see how far technalogy has come since the 40ths. Every instrument that they showed looked so ancient. FBI also had a different, good reputation that it has now.",1142899200,3,318,4.578947368421052
660325,4,630345786X,"""The House on 92nd Street"", a wartime propagandized docudrama is a microcosm of the counter espionage techniques used by the FBI in what was known as the Christopher case.  It was discovered that precious secrets concerning the construction of the atomic bomb were being earmarked for transmission to Germany.

The FBI led by chief investigator Briggs played by Lloyd Nolan, recruit and implant a mole with the homeland Nazi spy hierarchy.  This man Bill Dietrich, an engineer played by William Eythe gains the confidence of an espionage network headed by Elsa Gebhardt, a dress designer, played by Signe Hasso.  The ring operated out of a brownstone on 92nd St., which was a safe haven for U.S. based German agents and was under constant FBI surveillance.  Eythe is responsible for establishing a communication center with a direct hook up to Hamburg.

With persistence the FBI manages to trace the tendrils of this spy operation to thwart this threat to national security,

Director Henry Hathaway using actual FBI film footage, some featuring the esteemed J. Edgar Hoover, effectively conveys the bailiwick of this sensitive operation.",1135036800,5,1138,5.185792349726776
660326,5,630345786X,"This film is interesting to me for the following two reasons:

1.  It takes off from the portrayal of two of the main characters and becomes a character study of them within the context of a police spy thriller and war film,as well as a historical documentand a picture of my city,New York,right after WWII when I was growing up.

2.  The film becomes an Expressionist film noir in the last few minutes, with the death of the female leader of the German Nazi spy ring who is shot accidentally by one of her own henchmen, while trying to escape from the FBI who have surrounded the house. Photographed in a cloud of tear gas,starkly lit in light and shade in a half-darkened house, the ambiguous figure of the ""transvestite"" female spy is heightened and moves the picture momentarily into another realm.

The second story running besides the one of the double agent,played by William Eythe working with the FBI agent,Lloyd Nolan,to crack the spy ring run out of a house (actually on 93rd St.originally,not 92nd St.)is the study of the two curious Nazis,Signe Hasso,a Swedish actress playing Elsa, a German spy posing as a dress designer who is leading a double life dressing as a man to facilitate her movements around the city and the English actor Leo G. Carroll,playing Colonel Hammersohn,who recites his important distinguished romantic background to William Eythe when they first meet, as a spy during WWI,evidently unapprehended,and who dresses in the manner of someone from around 1910,carries a walking stick and has stylized gestures and is the one who is at least partially responsible for saving's Eythe's life at the end of the film. Who are both of these people?

These two finely thought-out characters,plus the intensity given in the portayal of the fine supporting cast of Nazi collaborators, particularly Lydia St. Clair as a fierce Gestapo agent are part of what makes ""The House on 92nd St.""really interesting in its attempt to give dramatic and well-written frames for some of its more fantastic characters and their twisted reasons for doing what they do. That they have lives outside of the film to speculate upon only gives more depth to an unsual motion picture.",1131753600,6,2185,4.907859078590786
