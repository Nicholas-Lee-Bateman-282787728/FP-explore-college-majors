7895616,4,6305809631,"This movie was very good.  With an A actor in the lead it could have been released in the theaters.  (Peter Dodson) did a fine job as an under cover agent that is compromised and must hide from the bad guys until the trial.  He goes stir crazy while stuck in the boonies and his boss sends out (Dina Meyer) to keep him company.  I am still not sure why a civilian was sent up there, but ignoring that part of the story line and the movie picks up.
Of course the bad guys find out where he is hiding and they send up two assasins to get him.  (Francesco Quinn) a hit man from the old country and (John Polito) a semi retired mob hit man.  The bantering between these two hit men on the way to Califorina, and ther obvious lack of experionce with the country make this a must see movie.
Don't let the cover fool you.  Dina Meyer never wears any thing resembling the outfit on the cover.  The acting in this is very good though and makes this a movie you could watch more than once.  Much better than most of the straight to vidio fare.",1045699200,23,1033,4.099502487562189
