It's just that I'm not up on current films and videos, so some of this went past me, I didn't quite know what they were mocking. The Titanic parody was great, but what I really loved was the Cher And Her Wigs spoof. I hope to see more from these two. I sure miss Ab Fab...",1114128000,2,397,3.975
2197528,5,B0006Z2KZW,"I have always been a fan of Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French; they are the funniest actresses in the world, bar none. And after four DVDs were released of some of their best sketches, I was sure that this was all that was going to be shown in America. But, I have been proven wrong, for here is the first of two new DVDs being released by BBC - DVD! Clearly, you can see that this DVD will include the hilarious special for ""Titanic"" but it will also include the spoof on ""Making-of"" documentaries that is hosted by Jennifer Saunders co-star Joanna Lumley from ""Absolutely Fabulous""! At this moment there isn't much information on what else will be included, but in a recent BBC America cataloge it stated that this DVD will have 4 1/2 hours of F&S which is quite a lot more than the other DVDs, which usually run for not even two hours! So, it seems we might be getting closer to having nearly every moment from the long-running series avalible here in America! Mark your calender, because French and Saunders : On the Rocks and Back with a Vengance will be released on March 1st! Also, on a side note, if you want a copy of BBC's hit soap opera ""EastEnders"" (which will be released publicly on March 1st as well), you can find a copy on the BBC America Shop website for sale...right now! It has been on sale there for almost a month already, so if you want this copy you can get it on bbcamericashop.com before most! If only they would do it with these DVDs.....",1107734400,18,1465,4.3699633699633695

8043977,5,B0006Z2KZW,"I should not have to review any work by French & Saunders!  Their work speaks for itself.  Whether it's a parody of a Hollywood Blockbuster or the ladies doing a brilliant send up of the Corrs, Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders are in a league all to themselves.  Be prepared to laugh.  Laugh until your side hurts.  Laugh until you cry.  Be sure to watch all of the bonus material.  A can't miss.",1262563200,5,397,4.3561643835616435
8043978,2,B0006Z2KZW,"Again, I love both Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders and am a fan of British comedies, but this was terrible.  I am glad it wasn't very much money, but wouldn't buy anything they do together again.",1231286400,,197,4.472222222222222

8043980,4,B0006Z2KZW,"If you are a French and Saunders fan, you have to get this DVD. As usual, the writing is fresh, the outlook of each character is unique and hilarious. I'm a huge Saunders fan, so in my book, there's not much she does that I can find fault with.",1142812800,,244,4.0
8043981,3,B0006Z2KZW,"This DVD features 15 sketches from French & Saunders, and the 1988 and 2002 Christmas specials.

The sketches are OK, but do not represent the best of French & Saunders.

The 2002 Christmas special will probably not appeal to those who are not familiar with British TV. The opening scene is a parody of BBC One's on-sceen identity and the special continues with lots of references to British TV.

The real highlight of this DVD is the 1988 Christmas special. This was French & Saunders at their best and this DVD is worth purchasing for this alone.",1117929600,3,548,4.628865979381444
