775920,5,6304061951,"I have not worked out in a really long time and I am totally out of shape, but this workout has really motivated me to keep up with excersing. I was able to keep up with the excerises and I was constantly reminded by the  trainer how to position my body.  I have tried numerous workouts tapes and  I have found this to be the best!  It is a great combination of both  aerobics and weight training.  Just as you start to really sweat in the  aerobic section, you move into a weigth workout.  Karen Voight keeps your  form correct and tells you about each different move that she is doing.  This is one of the only workouts that I have done that was not at all  painful or uncomfortable to do (on my knees etc...).  The scenery is  beautiful and does help keep your interest also.  I Highly recommend this  workout to all -- beginners and advanced.",953251200,5,846,4.265822784810126
776038,5,6304061951,"I began using this tape to get ready for my 25th wedding anniversary (52 yrs old).  I've been using it off and on through the years and find it appropriate for my current age - 70.  I've never hurt myself using it as I did in the gym a few years ago.  In the beginning, I took my time - about 2 months to complete the entire video - using it daily.  I'm in great shape and have no problem doing all the exercises.  I highly recommend it.",1395100800,,437,3.9204545454545454
776039,5,6304061951,"I usually do advanced workouts like Cathe, P90X, Insanity, etc.  But, there are days when you just want to do an easy workout without wasting your time.  Well, this is a fun workout that fits that bill.  I love the scenery and the short sequences Karen uses.  The music is 80's pop, which is actually really motivational and just kind of makes you want to smile.  I'm in a snowy area dealing with the winter blahs and this workout provides a nice mental lift with all the tropical scenery.

Even though it is a relatively easy workout (beginner/intermediate level), you can increase the intensity by increasing the weight and exaggerating the cardio moves.  The choreography is really easy, so pumping it up is doable.  You can also use ankle weights during the leg toning section.  With the exception of the seat work toward the end, the maximum rep count is 16, so if there are moves you don't like (push ups), you don't have to do endless reps of them like in some workouts.  There also isn't much equipment needed that you don't already have such as a chair, mat (or carpeted floor), and hand weights (can use soup cans if needed).  It is 54 minutes long.

Karen looks amazing and is not at all annoying.  As mentioned with other reviews, Elle makes some quirky/ditsy comments, but thankfully doesn't talk much in the workout.  I wish this was redone in a CD format as the VHS quality is blurry and doesn't do the scenery justice.  This one is definitely in my 'oldie but goodie' video library.",1390262400,2,1498,4.578947368421052
776040,4,6304061951,grateful to have found this item. the vhs has some qinks when you play it but i guess thats to be expected??,1316390400,,108,3.9545454545454546
776041,4,6304061951,"I love this workout. I lost my old one and I was glad to see they still sell it. I lost 20 pounds in about a month (diet and exercise). Karen created a workout that uses every part of your body, and I never felt healthier afterwards. In two weeks, I was addicted and I can't wait for my dvd to arrive so I can start again. My abs, arms, and legs looked amazing. Best of all, Karen isn't annoying and perky and doesn't have that annoying techno music, so if you are into that, then this video will not appeal to you. However, if you just want someone to kick your butt, it is.",1252108800,,575,4.008695652173913
776042,5,6304061951,"i have had this video since 1994 and have done it hundreds of times. it is actually the sole reason i keep my vcr! i love the variation the circuit training offers and for being almost 15 years old, the music, scenery and even elle and karen's outfits have stood the test of time. the thing that's so great about this video is it does exactly what they say it will do in the beginning. if you do it for 3 weeks, every other day, you will notice a huge difference. whenever i need to tone up and get into shape for a specific event, i always turn to karen and this video because i know i will get the results i want.

i have tried to get many friends on this workout and its proven to be too long for some and too difficult for others. its taken years but i can honestly say the time flies and i don't dread any of the segments anymore.

i really wish they would put this on dvd for the tried and true fans who own several copies (i have a back-up!). i have purchased other videos by karen byt none have given the the results and enjoyment this has. oh yeah - the parts where elle talks is pure comedy for me and i mock her throughout the entire tape which adds to the appeal (for me at least). example ""i feel like i'm in the army!"" while she is doing a modified jumping jack. priceless...",1233619200,,1289,4.050980392156863
776043,5,6304061951,"I'm ordering my second copy of this exercise tape.  My first one finally gave out after years of use.  I'm glad Amazon still carries it.  This is a great workout tape!  It's fun to do and very effective.  This tape has one of the best ab exercise that I know.  It also has great workout using hand weights.  My only complaint is that they still sell this as a VHS tape instead of DVD.  Luckily, my machine plays both.  Some things are timeless.  This workout is one of them.",1228953600,,474,4.224719101123595
776044,5,6304061951,"This is by far my favorite work out tape ever and when I say ever I mean I have had this as part of my collection for about a decade now.  The workout has three areobic sections and three strength training sections that work all areas of your body.  It is not grueling or repetitious, instead you go through various moves that are easy to follow yet change enough that you don't get bored.  I have noticed a visible difference in my muscle tone due to this workout.
This is one of the only exercise tapes I use but I also watch my diet and exercise in other ways to suppliment my workouts, but I think you would still be able to see great results from this tape alone.",1203638400,,668,4.162790697674419
776045,5,6304061951,"This video just plain rocks! I started using this tape when I was 18 and got amazing results. I am now 31 and still come back to it when I need to lose weight and tone up. It's SO effective, but not too hard that I injure myself. I always have sore knees after doing the Firm. There are no lunges in this video which I love. The cardio is TOUGH and makes my lungs burn and the toning is just perfect. Lots of arm work so be prepared. This is a great tape to get your butt in shape and have fun at the same time. LOVE IT!!",1197244800,,521,3.7889908256880735
776046,5,6304061951,"I loved this video. It is easy to do, yet you will be pleasantly sore the following day, you can feel that you worked every muscle. But don't take that wrong...it feels great!! After working with this video, anything else is too fast or too annoying. This video has a great pace, beautiful scenery and music, and is EASY to learn and get used to. The first few times I couldn't really do the last segment of aerobics, but after pushing myself, I realized it is necessary and it became easier!!  I have since lost this tape while moving, but I am gonna buy it again on Amazon.com!!",1193616000,3,580,4.37037037037037
776047,4,6304061951,"I used this video for almost ten years until the tape finally wore out and broke. It's a great workout...really fun. It works your legs, arms and abs and it really gets your heart pumping. The scenery is great and Karen Voight is amazing!",1193270400,,238,4.431818181818182
776144,5,6304061951,"Like many of my fellow reviewers, I've owned this tape for years and while I am addicted to buying new exercise DVDs, I will never part with this workout. In 45 minutes I feel like I've done a full body cardio/strength training workout. I love the intervals of cardio and strength - I've read many articles that state how good interval training is for you. The cardio sections are great at getting my heart rate up and by the time I get through the strength training segment, I'm recovered and ready for cardio again.  Cardio gets more intense each time and the last one always wears me out!  The strength training exercises are tough  you will feel the burn! The arm section (strength training segment 2) is the most challenging for me but I love it!

And yes, this video has the most beautiful background you can imagine!  The colors are vibrant and the scenery is gorgeous. I love the background music, too, especially Sting singing 'Smooth Like A Wave"" during the abs and cooldown...or maybe that's just because it's at the end and I know I'm almost done!

Elle's comments are kind of funny, but I think she's enjoyable and she's really working out in the video. I love Karen's cues and the way she gives little clues to make the exercises more instense.  My favorite part, though, is after the cool down when they show a blooper of a giant wave takung over their set while (for some unknown reason) they continue to try and finish their workout before they give in to a big fit of giggles!",1172188800,,1494,4.511111111111111
776145,4,6304061951,"I enjoy this video, especially the toning segments. They really give me a workout without my thinking, ""when will this be over?"". The aerobic circuits aren't too difficult, but a couple of them require deep squats, which are really hard on my knees. I just don't do them, but then I feel like I haven't worked hard enough! But I get up a good sweat with this video regardless. Karen does use some travelling steps which will require a fair-sized area in which to work. This video feels more ""friendly"" than some others, with Elle speaking some lines and the views of the lovely outdoor setting. I just wish it were on DVD so could skip to my favorite parts, or use the toning segments here and cardio circuits elsewhere. Karen cues appropriately and is no hyper, whooping fluff chick and I appreciate that! I'm sticking with Karen.",1148601600,2,831,4.621621621621622
776146,5,6304061951,"I've used many different workout videos in the past, I had this one and used it often back in 1998. My personal opinion of this video was that it was the most enjoyable and challenging set of workouts out of my entire collection. Be warned that some of the more intense excercises require a lot of room to move so do this some where that is spacious.",1145836800,,350,4.2388059701492535
776147,5,6304061951,"Like alot of other people, I've had this tape for a number of years.  I just started using it again a little while back and realized how great it is even a decade later.  The moves are pretty basic and gradully pick up intensity as the tape progresses.  The scenery is beautiful and the music selection fits the exercises well.  The hour really does fly by.  I read somewhere that you should give yourself  7 days to get into any new habit.  I will admit the first week back into this tape I thought it was going to kill me!  Once I got over that hump, it is just now part of my routine 3 times a week (although Karen Voight's website states you can use it five times a week)  Like many others, I wish this would be released on DVD and have expressed that thought via Karen's website.

I recommend this video to anyone who wants a challenge.  It's a tape that I find I don't get bored using.  Great music, beautiful scenery and moves that you can really stick with, nothing overly choreographed.  You will see results within a month if you stick with it.

One more thing, I don't understand all these negative comments about Elle McPhearson, people must be jealous (understandibly so since she is a knockout!).  The comments she makes are few and far between and she never makes out that she is any kind of exercise expert, she just gives simple tips in layman's terms.  If this video is 55 minutes long, her total comments, during the exercise (not including intro) can't total more than 2-3 minutes.  Get over it people.",1140220800,6,1522,4.41726618705036
776148,4,6304061951,"Although the cover of this workout featuress supermodel Elle MacPherson, don't let that fool you--the instructor of this video is none-other than world-renowned fitness instructor Karen Voight.  This is a circuit workout, which means there are aerobic segments which alternate with weighted toning intervals.  Karen and Elle appear together in a variety of beautifully scenic Hawaii locations, and although Elle introduces the various segments, Karen takes over from there.

The workout starts with a 4 minute warm-up.  This was classic Karen Voight:  basic moves such as marches and side-steps combined with arm movements to warm up both your lower and your upper body.  Next comes the first aerobic segment, lasting about 4.5 minutes.  Again, Karen uses very simple moves (hamstring curls, knee-ups), and she ups the intensity a bit at the very end with some hops.  For the first toning interval, no weights are used, but Karen and Elle use a bench; a chair works fine.  Seated in the chair, you'll do various leg extensions, move on to tricep dips, and then finish on the floor with push-ups for a total of 5.5 minutes.

The second aerobic interval is very similar to the first; it also adds a bit of intensity at the end with jumping jacks, and it's about 5 minutes long.  The second toning segment is longer (11 minutes) and works a greater variety of muscles.  First, you'll use the dumbbells to work your arms and shoulders in a standing position.  Next, you'll lie over your chair or bench (I used my stability ball here) in a an all-fours position for glutes work.  Finally, you'll move to a seated position for some additional upper body work with the dumbbells.  The last aerobic segment starts with some mock jump rope, and then Karen performs moves inspired by different sports, including basketball, football, karate, and swimming for 9 minutes total.

The last toning segment is performed on the floor.  You'll start with abs work, and as always, Karen attacks the abs thoroughly with a variety of crunches.  You then lie on your back for additional glutes work via several pelvic lift variations.  Finally, Karen has you lie on your stomach for just a few back strengthening moves for a total of 8.5 minutes.  The workout ends with a 6.5 minute cool-down performed entirely on the floor; Karen leads you through some seated and lying yoga stretches to the tune of ""Fields of Gold"" (although the artist is not Sting), bringing the total time for the workout in at about 54 minutes.

The interaction between Karen and Elle reminded me very much of another supermodel fitness video, Cindy Crawford's A New Dimension--there, instructor Kathy Kaehler leads the workout, but Cindy makes frequent comments, as Elle does here.  Some might find these quips annoying, but Elle seemed genuine to me, and she certainly deferred to Karen as appropriate.  In addition to the song mentioned above, much of the music in this video was recognizable as hits from the late 80s/early 90s, including ""Some Like It Hot"" and ""Break My Stride.""  Finally, I think this video would appeal to a wide range of fitness levels:  beginners could modify down by keeping the cardio entirely low-impact and by using light or no weights, and more experienced exercises could add light hand weights to the cardio segments, utilize ankle weights for the leg work, and increase the dumbbells for the upper body work (but beware: Karen does a lot of reps, and as an intermediate, I found using 5 lbs. tough!).  Overall, this is a very solid interval workout with a timeless feel, and I'd definitely recommend it.",1127606400,4,3589,4.91044776119403

If you can get past Elle's somewhat moronic comments (my daughter and I know them by heart, and actually they never fail to give us a good laugh, which makes the time go more quickly: ""Think of bending your shoes...especially if they're new...like mine!"" Auuuggghh!)The excellent well rounded workout, Karen Voigt, and the beautiful changes of scenery more than make up for Ms. McPherson's aimless prattle. As often as I do this, it is still physically challenging.  Highly recommend!",1127347200,3,651,4.752212389380531

Okay, so Elle's forced perkiness is a bit annoying, but if you can zone out and ignore her, Karen has put together a great workout which has changed as my fitness has improved - you can easily modify the intensity of the moves for your fitness level.

I really enjoy the circuit training style, and this is the video that definitely got me addicted to Karen's workouts - every time I've done this workout, at the end I've always wanted Karen's body, not Elle's.",1112140800,3,609,4.28695652173913

776218,5,6304061951,"This workout video is very good, the scenery, the music, the exercises themselves are very tasteful.
It is an ""interval training"" workout video. It is roughly 4-5 mins warming up, then starts to the first aerobics section, moves on to some toning for the legs for some 10 mins then moves to aerobics section 2, then again to some more toning for the legs and arms, then back to aerobics 3 and so on, till the end there is a 6-7min abs section.
The aerobics sections, eventhough they are short, they bring the heart rate up.
The video is a great change of pace video for those days that you want to workout, and want a little of aerobics and a little of toning the whole body.
Although, the video is roughly an hour long, time flies rather quickly.

Karen Voight is a great motivator, and Elle's down-to-earth persona ensures that the home-exerciser isn't discouraged by her 'perfect' appearance. The video is divided into sections that interchange between aerobics and sculpting, so that no body part is neglected. The Hawaiian scenery is inspiring, and the music is well chosen (though now dated). I'd recommend this video to exercisers of all levels. Advanced exercisers can use heavier weights during the weights section, and beginners can slowly work their way up to completing the whole routine. It's an effective workout video that puts the fun back into exercising. Recommended for those that want to improve their fitness level, tone up or lose weight.",1070841600,2,856,5.16546762589928
776220,4,6304061951,"I thought this was a great workout.  The set was a beautiful natural outdoors set, perhaps filmed in Australia.  The background varied, and the music did too.  The music was vocal rock, for example, INXS.
The workout:
It's circuit training.  Three aerobic segments and three weight-training segments.  The aerobic segments get harder and higher impact each time.  The first is very gentle, the middle one concentrates on your legs and butt.  The last one is a mixture of various sports movements - skating, swimming, basketball, and boxing.  It's the most strenuous, but it's also the most fun.
The strength-training workouts are very hard.  I only had 5 pound weights, so I couldn't use light weights like Elle.  She does a full leg workout, an abdominals and glutes workout, but the arm workout seemed to concentrate most on the triceps.
This video requires handweights, although I stopped using them and continued without when my arms got fatigued.  Optimally, you would also have a weight bench, but an armless kitchen chair will do you just as well.  A sturdy one - both my antique chair and my director's chair were unable to hold up to my weight during one of the butt toning segments.
My back muscles and hamstrings are probably the most sore after this workout, as the other workouts I've been doing have not emphasized these areas.
The instructors:
Karen Voigt is fantastic.  She talks just the right amount and her cueing is amazing.  The first time through I didn't miss a single step, because she clearly let you know what was coming up next.  Elle is a nice person.  Her motivational speech in the beginning was great.

The mix of aerobics is interesting and surprisingly fun and I can really feel my lower body muscles after the tough workout segment on the mountain/rocky area. The scene is beautiful and Karen is, as always a great instructor. Like other reviewers I like that Elle lets Karen lead, there's a comfortable rapport between them.

The moves are introduced slowly as part of the warm-up, and then combined in a high-energy, fun way for the final aerobics segment. Also, the aerobic portions specifically focus on the muscles used in the prior and next weight-lifting segments - warming up and cooling down those muscle groups. Karen gives clear instructions, and the filming is easy to follow. It's a intermediate workout, and remains one of my favorites after years of use. I give Elle credit, because she's clearly the student in this tape, rather than pretending to be the instructor. She & Karen are a nice combination.",1013558400,11,708,4.908333333333333

I have had this video for 2 years now and It is one of the few video's I can always get myself to start and finish - Plus it includes individual sections to tone each part of the body.  This video may be to light for people who like to work at advanced cardio levels",1006905600,6,492,3.9
776286,4,6304061951,"Elle Macpherson can be quite annoying in this video, but I found that getting mad at her gives me even more motivation!  Plus, Karen Voight is a great instructor, and she does a great job in this video of combining aerobics with weight training.  You'll be tired after doing this video, but you will see results!",1002758400,3,312,4.553571428571429
776287,4,6304061951,"Karen Voight really makes this tape. I bought this tape because of all of the hype that was surrounding Elle Macpherson and all reviews saying that this wasa a good workout. I find this tape is excellent for easing back into working out. Don't get me wrong, it is a challenge but after I while it gets a bit easier. The tape has Karen Voight leading Elle through a circuit of cardio and toning.
The sections vary between cardio and toning and the exercises are easy and fun, things that don't require a bunch of equipment.
Elle Macpherson is a pain in the behind. Her comments were irritating and distracting and I wanted to reach into the televison and smack her silly. At times I thought I saw Karen Voight roll her eyes at her. If you can ignore Elle then this is a good one to own for lazy days.",999648000,2,799,4.298013245033113
776288,5,6304061951,"I borrowed this one from a friend a year ago and have conveniently forgotten to return it.  This is one of the best all around fun workouts ever.  The 1 hour tape is kept upbeat and is very well balanced.  If you can get passed ""Elle"" complaining about her thighs you'll love it.  Karen Voight is the supreme instructor.  I would highly reccomend this one.",997142400,4,356,4.415384615384616
776289,4,6304061951,"I purchased this video some years ago and used it quite often during that time as I was on vacation and wasn't doing my usual fitness routine - I liked the video back then. I actually found it again a couple of weeks ago and had forgotten about it - tried it out again and found it to be less of a workout then it was a few years ago ( Although I think this is a good thing :)). My comments on the video : (1)the scenery is pleasant but overall the workout feels a little rushed. Its as if the camera crew only had a very limited amount of time to shoot the video (ie. a couple of hours). (2)the video divides the workout into several different cardio sections interspersed with weight training including upper body with weights and two lower body sections focussing on abs,legs, and butt. Overall, The video is pleasant to watch and not boring. (3) Karen Voight combines different sports-inspired moves (from swimming, boxing, and basketball) with more traditional squats, grapevines, hamstring curls, push-ups, sit-ups etc... (4) This is perfect for someone who would be considered in the beginner category,if you are more in the intermediate category, you would probably want to do this on a lighter day. With the pleasant scenery in this video and even though the workout feels a little rushed, it will make you sweat if you are a beginner and you will feel good even if you are more of an intermediate exerciser.",996019200,,1417,4.582677165354331
776290,5,6304061951,"I originally purchased this video because it was filmed in Hawaii.  Then after I got into it for the first time I really enjoyed it.  Like most people, my drive to workout dwindled.  A while later I was recovering from cancer and was ashamed of my skeletal form.  Looking through my workout video's I pulled this one out again.  At first I was only able to get through the warm-up.  As I got my strength back I was able to get through the entire tape.  I loved the video so much after that, that I wore the tape out.  I have never found a better video that has worked my WHOLE body, not just concentrating on a few parts.  This video really contributed to MY personal best.",978998400,8,673,4.2362204724409445

Although I would like to have  more workout time devoted to aerobic exercise on this program, this video  is extremely valuable when it comes to isolation and, especially, upper  body exercise.  Although I jog and cross-country ski, my upper body gets  somewhat neglected during aerobic exercise; my arms and shoulders in  particular.  This tape fills in the gaps beautifully with its hand weight  program.  I only wish the publishers would re-issue ""Your Personal  Best;"" I had to give back my friend's copy!",953596800,,676,4.824561403508772

7860929,5,6304061951,"I bought this when it originally came out in the 90's and have loved it ever since. My poor VHS tape finally bit the dust so I turned to Amazon for help. Unfortunately it doesn't come on DVD but I found a new VHS tape anyway. I'm currently recording it with my digital camera to put it on a DVD-R just in case I kill this tape too! I absolutely LOVE this workout video. I keep returning to it every year because I love the moves, the music, Karen. ..EVERYTHING!  I've seen it so many times that I even say all of Elle's attempts at humor and wit right along with her. (Huge nerd) I recommend this video for anyone who still has a VCR or who has the time to convert it to DVD! It's a keeper!!",1419120000,4,691,4.007246376811594

It was hard at first I even skipped the last cardio workout for a couple weeks because it was to difficult for a beginner but once I got stronger it was great. Elle is annoying but you can learn to ignore her.,1396915200,,290,3.693548387096774
7860932,5,6304061951,"I am 54 and slender (115 lbs) and while my background is in medicine, health education, and nutrition, I hate to exercise, even though I feel better when I do. While I have tried many other workout tapes, I have had this tape for over 15 years and it's the only one that I enjoy exercising to. The program consists of a warm-up, an aerobic interval, leg work, another aerobic segment, then arm and upper body work using light dumbbells (good workout), another aerobic segment, which is more strenuous, abdominal work, then cool-down and stretching.

This program is for beginner/intermediate and provides a great workout for ALL ages, especially those of a more ""mature"" age who really need an effective program that is easy to follow and you can adjust each move to your own physical capabilities. Karen Voigt guides you along very well and is not annoying like most instructors. The scenery is beautiful and the music easy to listen to and a good pace.

I cannot recommend this workout program strongly enough -  a MUST HAVE!",1395187200,2,1027,4.758426966292135
