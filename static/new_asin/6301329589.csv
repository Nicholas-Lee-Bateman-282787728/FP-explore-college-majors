331504,4,6301329589,"maybe I'm jumping the gun, but the way Frank speed picks scales is messing up my tried & true alternate picking (that I learned from his Chopbuilder video!).  There is a disclaimer in the booklet saying ""there is a slight trade off"" by using his technique.

Instead of constantly alternate picking scales, he also uses small, 2-string ""sweeps"" to get to each next string.  Maybe this will be benificial in the long run, but right now this technique is messing me up when I play some of the alternate picking licks I already know.  I can't see the light at the end of the tunnel that assures me the time spent learning all this new stuff is going to make what I already know much faster.

however, the arpegios section, in which he sweeps several strings at a time, are good.  I know because I had already mastered some similar ""sweeps"" prior to buying this DVD and they integrated seamlessly with my alternate picking.

The lessons are well constructed/taught and the video is very professionally edited.

I suppose the jury is still out...I can always edit this review, so I'll get back to you.",1105920000,9,1095,4.608247422680412
331505,5,6301329589,"Frank Gambale is not only an excellent teacher but is also a touring and playing musician.  His style of teaching is precise, balanced, and very thorough. When I first started using this of course it was slow going, but just as he taught, it became natural and effortless once I caught on.  It is full of gems of new ideas and arenas I had never known existed in the world of guitar playing.  It stretched my knowledge and playing ability to a new level I had not even considered before.  It doesn't matter what style guitar you play this will be an additon into your minds encyclopedia of guitar knowledge.",1099094400,5,607,4.490909090909091
331506,2,6301329589,"I find this video to be pretty much useless. The arpeggio section is pretty much a waste of time, since he plays the same arpeggio but in different positions over and over. He doesn't offer much in terms of licks, mainly just how to move up and down scales\arpeggios using his approach. You do get to see him play live, which is a treat because he is so fluid. The last lick pretty much sums up the whole video, I would not even bother with the rest. So I would recommend staying away from this and maybe just finding some licks on the net.",1063843200,3,540,4.201923076923077

7812088,5,6301329589,"No wonder Frank Gambale is dubbed the King of Sweep-Picking on guitar. His sweeps are more difficult to execute than your average Malmsteen sweeps. It however sounds jazzy and fusiony which will add sophistication and sassiness to your technique once mastered. Frank is also a great teacher. He also demonstrates economy-picking which will add fluidity, almost legato-like effect to your scale-runs. These techniques once mastered will have you shredding. The only thing then left for you to do is to then practice,practice and practice.",1195776000,,537,5.404761904761905

7812090,5,6301329589,"When I see Frank Play with brilliant artists such as Ckick Corea and Holdsworth, he really contributes a ton of what he has in him to the music as a whole. His brain cutting speed incorperated into wide arpeggio sweeps and giant scalar runs can just about swipe your memory! I've always wanted to know exactly how he did those things and the DVD is what I've been looking for.

The way that he teaches keeps you very interested. It's great for anyone whos looking for mega shredding ability. Even if your not a Gambale fan Its still well worth getting because you can take what he's given you and bend and twist it into fitting what you do.

If you are a Gambale fan or want to be chek out:

  1. Chick Corea: live at montreux(DVD)

  2. Centrifugal Funk(CD)

Some of the best Gambale playing(in my opinion)",1168041600,5,807,4.398648648648648
7812091,5,6301329589,"The previous reviews appear to be from people with some serious jealousy issues. Look, for those seriously looking to up their game, here is the one reason every guitar player should own this video ... Gambale's sweep picking style.

I first became aware of his amazing technique when his video was playing in a Sam Ash store. I pay attention to the picking technique of players because mine needs work. So, I am watching this guy play and I realize ... he is laying down these ripping fast runs, yet his wrist, forearm, and pick seem to almost never move. As I continued to watch, I realized just how inefficient most players are when it comes to our picking technique.

Who cares about his weird hair style! The man can play. Just ask Chick Corea.",1149811200,10,749,4.54074074074074
