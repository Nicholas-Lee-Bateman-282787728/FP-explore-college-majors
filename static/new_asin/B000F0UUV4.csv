Hopefully that will stop anybody else being misled like the previous reviewer.",1216252800,2,256,4.840909090909091
8116109,1,B000F0UUV4,"Bad mistake. But my fault. I thought it was the seasons worth of dvd's (looking at the picture). Turns out it was only disc #1. I paid 25 dollars for one disc and got the whole set recently for 28 at a shop in the mall. I will be more careful the next time. So I have 53 dollars in the set. Oh well, live and learn. Just make sure when you buy something from here and or anywhere you are getting what you really expect. Makes it look like you are getting the full set, but look below and it is Disc #1 only and you can get the whole set for under 30.00 dollars. Shop smarter friends and don't be hasty.",1200009600,6,602,3.902439024390244
