5682401,5,B00BYEWR2K,"I've watched every episode of the Borgias, some several times.  I am very impressed with the ""Spirit of History"" that runs through the show, with the acting, and with the innovative use of visual detail in the cinematography.  For instance, if the family is having dinner, you can see exactly what fine Italian food they're eating.  In fact, I could swear you can almost taste it.",1373155200,5,380,4.7272727272727275
5682402,4,B00BYEWR2K,"I'm ready for The Borgias:The Third Season but make sure you look at the number of discs, the amount of time, what extras you get IF they ever do a Directors cut so you don't just get a similar product. I've bought both the regular version of The Borgias Season 2 and the Directors Cut Season 2 thinking that there would be extra footage that didn't make it into the 56 minute format on Showtime. The regular Season 2 actually has 4 minutes more than the Directors cut. Go figure.

Let's talk about Season 3 of the Borgias: Without direct spoilers but to let you know what's coming in this season You'll get to see the Pope alive after S2's cliffhanger and how he manages to clear out the sneaky betrayers, Lucrezia's wedding to Alfonso and the aftermath, Micheletto helping everyone but himself, Cesare gaining an army and a wife, Lucrezia manipulating situations without the cunning to see 2 steps ahead in the Chessboard game of life, Cesare and Father having an all out confrontation about past and future actions, Alfonso (from S2) a pawn of just about everyone, Guilia saying goodbye to one and hello to another, the close bond between Rodrigo and Vanozza, the dangerous ego of Rodrigo/Pope Alexander VI w/plans for his family, the dark dance of Lucrezia's desire fulfilled, Catarina Sforza - the Tigress of Forli make pointed appearances, what ""happened"" to the Hebrews during the time of Alexander's rule of Rome, Cesare taking command of one thing he's always wanted but hesitant, still, until the very end, about taking it all.

There is something about each episode in season 3 that stands out but episode 10 with Lucrezia's opening soliloquy only to end as it does w/an almost ecstasy arch of her neck as she's next to certain characters leaves us all wanting more.

I really am sad to see that this series ended but after watching Season 2 and Season 3 you could tell that something was going on. The dresses were almost the same in Season 3 vs. Season 2, that had each episode with a different dress, different surroundings. They skimped on the sumptuousness and lavishness that was Season 2 vs. Season 3 which was, IMO, more focused to storylines that pertained close to home. S2 was had a wide open feeling in contrast with many players on the chessboard compared to the more intimate S3 season.

Of course, S3 has its detractors: Where is DellaRovere? Too much time was spent on the military aspect of 1 castle: Forli when in S2 the French marched through Italy all the way to Naples. On the whole S3 is needed for the more intimate storylines per episode to move the arc of the Borgias along the timeline as we all thought there would be season 4. It was a shock then to everyone that quickly changed to unhappiness that the flower would not bloom again in fullness like season 2 because Showtime cut off the show after episode 7, leaking episode 8 and 9 online and then making the announcement that it was Neil Jordan's fault for only writing enough for a 2 hour movie vs. Neil Jordan's people saying no, they just wanted to do a movie to wrap it up, countered by Showtime saying it was too expensive.

Even though it steams me that the money goes to Showtime - I wouldn't be without this Season 3 pack for my collection of The Borgias because there is an ending w/episode 10.....We'd just like more and if they ever get it together and there ever is a Season 4 you'll need this in your library.",1372118400,12,3414,4.571895424836601

5682405,5,B00BYEWR2K,"The third season of The Borgias has concluded on Showtime and what a ride it has been!

The Spaniard pope, Rodrigo Borgia, is reeling from the revelation that his eldest child, Cesare, is responsible for the murder of his beloved son, Juan (Cesare confesses during the second season finale!).  A rift is formed between the Borgia patriarch and his heir, leading Cesare to seek advancement through defiance, intrigue, and warfare.  Rodrigo is, reasonably, fearful of Cesare's actions, but he finds himself dependent on his son's cunning stratagem to create a Borgia empire.  Meanwhile, Lucrezia Borgia finds herself married to a naive, young prince from Naples who offers very little aid when she deals with his troublesome relatives who look down on her bastard Borgia (aka Spanish) lineage and illegitimate son.  If that's not enough, Cesare and Lucrezia are on the cusp of finally consummating their unspoken sexual attraction.  Is incest a taboo even a Borgia would refuse to commit?

This season simply left me breathless!

The scenery, the props, the costumes, the cinematography, the direction, the acting are all sumptuously (yes, sumptuously in the most decadent, delicious way) and expertly handled.  Very few television shows give their audience such a cinematic viewing.  Taking in an episode of The Borgias is a heady experience that leaves me craving the next installment.  This season is must have for any TV lover!",1370822400,55,1429,5.1965065502183405
5682406,4,B00BYEWR2K,"Note: I have seen every episode in HD via XFinity On Demand.

Showtime's finest series is back for a third-and lamentably, their final-season. Despite numerous inaccuracies (Micheletto being depicted as homosexual and illeterate, for example), the show is generally accurate per the look of 15th century Italy and with most of the details of what transpired within and without the Vatican walls. Academy Award winner Jeremy Irons is once again at the head of this infamous dynasty, and the acting has only gotten stronger. Francois Aranud does a very credile British accent. Except for the gay scenes, which were not only inaccurate, ut unneccessary, the storylines remain strong.

Question: Where was the youngest Borgia brother? He was last seen in Season I. And why weren't there clear views of Lucrezia and the Duchesa nude? The series is uninhibited when it comes to female nudity, so why didn't it show both of these gorgeous women naked?

5682447,4,B00BYEWR2K,"I just finished watching the third and final season of The Borgias via Netflix. The series dramatized the exploits of the infamous Borgia family  father Rodrigo (pope Alexander VI, 1492-1503), and his notorious offspring, Cesare and Lucrezia.

In this season, pope Alexander (Irons) recovers from an assassination attempt and immediately purges the disloyal members of the college of cardinals. The new appointees are forced to participate in the legendary Banquet of Chestnuts, which Alexander uses to extort their loyalty. In the meantime, his arch-rival, Caterina Sforza, schemes to create an alliance against him. The king of Naples forbids the newly-married Lucrezia (Grainger) from bringing her bastard child to Naples so she turns to her brother, Cesare (Arnaud), for help and comfort. Alexander plans a crusade against the troublesome Turkish pirates while a discontented Cesare considers an alliance with France. In Naples, Cesares henchman, Micheletto, removes all objections to Lucrezias baby. Cesare returns to Italy with the French army in tow, which Alexander perceives as a threat. Palace intrigue forces Lucrezia to flee Naples for Rome. Jewish merchants assist Alexander in eliminating the Turkish threat and also help him corner the sulphur supply, necessary for the manufacture of gunpowder. Finally reconciled with his father, Cesare lays siege to Caterinas fortified city, Forli, and returns to Rome triumphant with his vanquished prisoner in a gilded cage.

No doubt the writers employed some dramatic license in this series but the reign of the Borgias in Rome was an undeniable indicator of the absolute corruption of the institutionalized church at the time. Pope Alexander VIs only goals were the acquisition of greater earthly power and wealth. The Gospel of the early church of salvation by Gods grace through faith in Jesus Christ alone had devolved into formalism, legalism, and sacramentalism presided over by an authoritarian and spiritually toxic hierarchy. Only fourteen years after the death of Rodrigo Borgia, Martin Luther nailed his 95 theses to the door of the All Saints Church in Wittenberg.

I enjoyed this series although there are some unnecessary rough edges used by the writers and directors meant to bolster viewership. The acting is generally good throughout but Holliday Grainger is excellent in the role of the conniving Lucrezia. Francois Arnaud definitely grew into his role and is quite convincing in his last season as the diabolical Prince. Irresolute Jeremy Irons once again demonstrates why he was the wrong choice for the steel-willed Borgia patriarch. The costumes, sets, and special effects are outstanding. Showtime cancelled The Borgias following the third season but series creator, Neil Jordan, published the script for a two-hour, never-produced finale via ebook available from Amazon.com.

It has everything : great acting ,  gorgeous costumes, with elaborate sets and mesmerizng music by Trevor Morris, a most talented Canadian composer of electronic music  (it really was the music that  captivated and 'drew me into' the dramas , most of the time).
Well , in truth, the series IS horribly violent, with sex , greed, violence , power , corruption, lust - all the monstrous human vices (sic)...
Sometimes the dialogue did get a bit stilted, but overall, the acting was superb, beginning with the great Jeremy Irons...

It is astounding to think that some 500+ years later, we as humans are still wallowing in the same mire...., thus there are many lessons to be learned from this story and this page in history, I suppose, with the hope that the Roman Catholic Church is reforming ---- Think : the great and admirable Pope Francis in office currently ( what a contrast to the Borgia pope !!!!)
There is some consolation in knowing that the Borgias, despite all their sins as outlined above, did support and enable the flourishing of the  great art and culture of Renaissance Italy...",1432944000,,1173,4.642512077294686
5682473,5,B00BYEWR2K,"This is great entertainment; a vast story of ambition, warfare, ambition, greed, power, incest, and murder takes place at the height of corruption of the Catholic Papacy.  Jeremy Irons continues to amaze with his ability to depict a man of ruthless brilliance and ambition who controls organized Christianity during the Renaissance. Alexander VI would have to be considered to be one of the most interesting Popes of all times since his secular ambitions outweighed his clerical duties. Irons is most convincing when he is angry or conniving, which is the way we see him most often in the third season. Alexander VI, previously Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia, continues to strategically place members of his family, such as arranging for his daughter to marry a prince from Naples and his son Caesar to marry a noblewoman from the French court. Whereas the facts are bent a bit through the entire series, there is no doubt that the struggles of the Italian Peninsula made for great drama.

In the third season, Caesar Borgia takes charge and proves his military and diplomatic genius.  Caesar Borgia was the model for Machiavellis classic book, The Prince. Caesar Borgia grows during the three seasons from a Cardinal under the control of his father to a man of intense ambition and strategy in the final season. The entire three seasons mark the growth of Caesar away from his fathers shadow to assuming the control of armies attempting to control all of central Italy.

Whereas the first and part of the second season focused intently on the rivalry of Alexander VI and Cardinal Della Rovere, the third season clearly shifts the rivalry from Alexander and Della Rovere to Caesar and the amazing Catherina Sforza, the Lioness, and one of the most interesting women of the Renaissance. Colm Feore is outstanding as Cardinal Della Rovere. Gina McKee was beyond outstanding in her powerful portrayal of Caterina Sforza.  The writers gradually move the conflict from the Pope and the Cardinal to Caesar and Caterina where there is much drama.

Lucrezia Borgia, the daughter in the Borgia family, marries a prince of Naples and Spain, Alfonzo of Aragon, and their rocky marriage makes for much drama in the third season. Unfortunately for Holliday Grainger, the actress who plays Lucrezia Borgia, her character comes across as extremely self absorbed and spoiled.

The third season, like the first and second, is never ending entertainment. The film is beautifully realized with outstanding costumes and sets. Historic fact is stretched a good bit but the film makes up for it with high drama.",1432598400,3,2582,5.032786885245901

5682493,5,B00BYEWR2K,"Having waited ten months for the next and sadly final instalment of this superb drama we have, as usual, gobbled the whole season up in unseemly haste. This review contains slight spoilers for the end of season two so if you've not seen it then skip the following paragraph.

The action follows on immediately from the nail biting finale of Season two with our Borgia pope fighting for his life following Della Rovere's poisoning as the avaricious cardinals vie to become Alexander's successor.

The depth of political intrigue makes West Wing look like a kitten playing with string and it is impossible to describe any of the goings-on without completely spoiling the season. Suffice to say that Cesare continues to be unappreciated as he strives to further cement the papacy's hold over the squabbling family states while Lucrezia struggles with the consequences of her conflicted amorous feelings. Throughout the seemingly endless labyrinthine plotting, shifting allegiances and messy deaths, the splendidly reliable and implacable Michelotto continues to shine as the apparently only trustworthy person in the whole country.

With the same obsessive production values, huge cast and sumptuous costumes & locations it is sadly no surprise that again, the network bean-counters axed the show before the fourth and final planned season citing the financial cost as the main reason. Also, I somewhat cynically & perhaps pretentiously suspect that the writing and plot design were just too elegant and complex for the American mass audience. Whatever the reason, it is a shame that they wouldn't even finance a final two hour `wind-up' episode to satisfy the enthralled audience as the extant season three does end somewhat abruptly. Notwithstanding the ending, this season is a must for anyone gripped by the intricacies of 15th Century Italian politics.",1421539200,2,1854,5.299319727891157

Some facts have of course been eluded, romanced, some characters don't appear in the fiction (There were two more Rodrigo Borgia's sons who also had a part in the rules of Rome) but overall it's remarkably faithfull to the real story.

Much of this season is ugly as people act out of their lowest motives. I'm not saying the show isn't entertaining - it is! - but you know you are coming to the end of a glittering era and the glitter is in the past. Jeremy Irons is far more restrained in his performance. Many scenes show him praying from his breviary, and there can be no doubt he is truly praying and not faking. He has abandoned his mistresses apparently, and his biggest intrigue is to secretly buy up gunpowder to prevent warfare. He has surrendered the worldly role to his son Cesare, who connives, conspires, attacks, negotiates with relish. There is an extremely moving scene in which the father and son reconcile. An argument between them happens very quickly, and both men are adamant. Until a miraculous double forgiveness ensues. The scene is so beautiful - almost Shakespearean - I almost forgot this family was murderous and treacherous. But that is the power of drama and acting.",1412208000,3,1128,4.78974358974359

5682535,4,B00BYEWR2K,"The third season of the Borgias"" by Neil Jordan had its moments but, with it being canceled, it offers an underwhelming close to what was an excellent historic drama. The series focuses on the Spanish family that held the papacy and the Papal States in its grasp at the end of the 15th/start of the 16th centuries. While the music, sets and costumes are all excellent, this series is held together by a wonderful group of actors including the masterful Jeremy Irons as Pope Alexander VI, Franois Arnaud as Cesare Borgia and Holliday Grainger as Lucrezia Borgia. But there are problems as some of the great supporting cast members--namely Lott Verbeek as Giulia Farnese and Colm Feore as Cardinal Della Rovere--essentially vanish for this season. While there are some dramatic developments this season, the ending left a bad taste in the mouth. The various Borgia family members also spend less time with each other than they had in previous seasons, leading to less interaction between the lead actors. The special features continue to prove unimpressive. Not a bad season but the series deserved a better send off than this.",1405382400,,1125,4.957671957671957

T consider the inner turmoils an interesting revelation. The Borgia's is well worth watching in the historical vein of the Catholic Church and political machinations within it.

I had to go to Wiki and read about actual historical end of Borgia family and all main protagonists. WARNING! If you like the main three characters, don't research the history. It is far from 'Hollywood ending'.
To the creators of the show I want to say thank you for masterfully depicting one of the less known but more exciting periods of history of Europe and Italy, in particular. Yes, you did take some artistic freedom in rolling out the story where some facts were silenced in favor of more scandalous versions of 'pretend truth events'.

5682577,5,B00BYEWR2K,"We just finished up ""Season 3 uncut edition"" and enjoyed it just as much as seasons 1 and 2.
This series was mostly shot in Hungary, but certainly looks as if it could have been the Vatican.
Yes, if you like to learn some history while seeing stunningly beautiful architecture and costuming,
plus enough sex, violence and intrigue to match other docu-dramas, you will enjoy this.
Showtime had planned 4 seasons but (as is often the case with series) canceled the final season
as they were not gaining enough in revenue vs the costs involved (perhaps had they taken into account
total global sales over several years they would have seen it profitable).
Though not all the major figures related to the Borgia family appear in the series, the characters
that are portrayed were all actual people at the time.  The casting is great, the acting very good,
the pacing and cinematography are excellent.  The final season presumably would have shown
Cesare obtaining his own little kingdom (which he wasn't able to hold onto), and perhaps the death
of his father the pope.  Alexander VI's papacy lasted only about 6 years.

The ""special features"" are remarkably thin.  Showtime pretty much shoved the final season out the
door to DVD and Blu-Ray as cheaply as possible to pick up the extra revenue.  There are a bunch
of trailers (all of which simply reprise scenes you see in the series) and interviews with six or seven
of the actors (I would have enjoyed hearing an interview with the actor who played Micheletto but, it's
not there.  It would have been great if they included maybe a half-hour special on the actual history,
perhaps to the end of Cesare's life and the family's effect on the rest of Europe--but, no.  The blooper
reel isn't that funny.  Blu-Ray might be even better with the scenery though it shows more blemishes
on actors' faces.  I was satisfied with DVD quality.  If you haven't watched Borgias at all, buy the
full set of three at a discount!  Brief full-on (male) nudity; partial female nudity; some swearing; many
scenes of combat but not gratuitously gory.",1391385600,3,2078,4.773743016759776

5682583,5,B00BYEWR2K,"Alicia here--Michael wanted me to do a review for the both of us so here it goes (some spoilers) :

I thought I wouldn't adore another cable Revisionist Drama after Spartacus, but The Borgias  won me over!  Casting? Excellent . Writing? Okay, I would say better than Spartacus ALTHOUGH Spartacus is still mah number one. I mean, come on--buffo guys in barely nothing, beautiful schemers, adventures and battles....LOL....

The Borgia scene stealers were Lucrezia played by the angelic looking Holliday Grainger  and Micheletto (Sean Harris) whose soulless stare could send shivers down spines. Lucrezia had this way of making me want to strangle her and hug her simultaneously.  Micheletto intrigued me as we got hints into the dark aspects of his heart.  Not to be outdone, Jeremy Irons as our salacious pope kicked bootay and took names.  Now, I will admit I was underwhelmed with Irons in Episode One of Season One.  Not sure if he was still feeling out his role or told to play the entire thing like he was half asleep, but by the middle of Season One he wore those cassocks like he owned them. Sexy Cesare was also a standout, dealing out death with all the casualness of  ordering a cheeseburger at McDonalds' yet his loyalty to his father and sister was unshakable.

And when Lucrezia and Cesare went where no sister and brother should go--I was throwing stuff at the TV and screaming ""Dude, that's your sister!""

What a perfect family to love/hate -- the hubby and I were hooked.

What I adored about The Borgias is how director Neil Jordan played with known history enough to make it compelling, but wrote in a way to excite imaginations. I also enjoyed the fact that the acting isn't the over the top thespian style you may find in Shakespearean theatre--it's even handed, poignant and yet passionate.

So, I was looking forward to season four--but learned there won't be one.  There is a petition that is up that fans can sign to save the show [...]share ti with all yah know so we can give this exciting cast another year to thrill us with the derrign do of the Borgias.

That said, even if we fail, the third season ends on a good note.  Though History tells us otherwise, we end with The Borgias on top. Should they be? No, they should pay for their crimes--and they do eventually.  But come on, we still rooted for them didn't we? -- Alicia Wife of Michael :-)",1390089600,4,2375,4.627684964200477

The ""feel"" of the quality production in a wonderful immersion experience.  The storyline however continues to unravel at a snail's pace.  After season one I read Christopher Hibbert's excellent book ""The Borgias"".  It was a great read and went through the whole Borgia saga in detail.  I read through the book in less than the 10 hours of Season One.  We've now been watching the three seasons of the Borgias DVD for nearly thirty hours and I don't think we are half way through the book.  Producers have made a fatal flaw in slowing down the story to this pace and historical series won't sustain the 8 seasons it would take to complete the story.  Sad as the quality is so good the story deserves to be completed.  I think will go down as an unfinished masterpiece like some of the early silent epics that ran out of money and time.",1389398400,2,936,4.5843373493975905

We picked up quite a bit of local history to include French Army's pillaging of Luca, Palazzo Farnese, Savonarola's followers huge Bonfires of the Vanities, Piazza Navona and Vatican Gardens.  It is no less historically accurate than HBO's Rome Series.

Season 1 and 2 were so gripping my wife and I often stayed up hours later than intended because we just couldn't peel ourselves away from the show, but we were not going to bed so late on this season.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the season, but the script seemed a bit different as if they changed writers...?  I love the costumes and the entire set.  It seems very authentic.

On a historical note, I really wonder how accurate this is.  I know this is a work of fiction based on some historical facts and a producer's view to make it more entertaining...I'm not a historian, but Giuliano Della Rovere was recorded as trying to kill Rodrigo Borgia multiple times to 'cleanse' the Chair of St. Peters and was upset that HE had not won the title of Pope himself.  Like the narrator says in the beginning of the movie ""Braveheart"", history is written by those kings/rulers that win the wars and live the longest, and the history written by the Pope (Giuliano Della Rovere) after Rodrigo Borgia died would carry enough weight to be believed through centuries, right?  The Borgia's were portrayed as being able to murder and poison almost anybody they wished at any time they wished, so why was Giuliano Della Rovere able to survive so long and so many attempts on his life?  Further, after Rodrigo Borgia passed, Giuliano Della Rovere again did not become Pope.  What happened to this Pope...?  He lived for ~18 days (or 23?  I don't remember exactly) before being killed, and then Giuliano Della Rovere was finally named Pope and ruled for many years after.  Also, Giuliano Della Rovere had a father or grandfather that had been Pope, and from what little reading I've done, he seemed to almost think he should have been named Pope, almost as if he was the heir apparent to the Chair of St. Peters.  I don't know if I'm right, but you have to admit, it is a little fishy since Giuliano Della Rovere had many years to tell tales to people recording history.

This series tracks what we know about the family history from a high level.  Nevertheless, it is fiction.  There is material that cannot be verified for sure and some that probably is not true.

5682629,5,B00BYEWR2K,"""The Borgias"" began with a bang, showing the chicanery behind  the election of Rodrigo Borgia to the Papacy. The season ended with the family at peace. Season two was lively, especially with the dealings with Savonarola and Juan Borgia's failures with Caterina Sforza. It ends with a huge cliff hanger, the poisoning of Papa Alexander VI. I don't think it is too big a spoiler to say that his life is saved in Episode 1, by Lucrezia (hinting at her knowledge of poisons, for which she is famous.)

What seems to work better in season 3 is the sense, over the 10 episodes, that we are finally working toward a climax with is advantageous to the Borgias. We even see, perhaps a bit more clearly, how their various stratagems work or do not work, and how Lucrezia especially got her reputation.

The problem of dealing with all the different names and characters is cleared up a bit, since so many of them are familiar to us now. It's remarkable how many of the most interesting characters are real, historic figures, such as Niccolo Machiavelli (who is perhaps more famous today than any other character in that era) and  Michelotto Corella, Cesere's right hand man, spy, bodyguard, and assassin. Machiavelli did make several mentions of the Borgia schemes in his work, ""The Prince"" but I'm not sure he was as much of an ally of the Borgias as this series makes him out to be, and I know he was not an agent of the de Medici rulers of Florence

The series could have ended with the death of Alexander VI, since his reign was only 13 years long, but it doesn't. It ends with the Borgias at a high point in their career.

One thing I love about this series, in contrast to ""Game of Thrones"", is that it fields goodly sized armies, and its battles do not take place in the dark. I'm especially fond of how cleverly a siege is carried out. I really hope that is an historically accurate scene. There is one scene involving ships which is very similar to a scene near the end of Season 2 in ""Game of Thrones"". ""The Borgias"" carries it off with greater drama and cinematography.

There is little value to buying the third season if you have not seen the first and second seasons, as you will miss all the background of the enmity between Naples and Rome and the Sforzas and the Borgias and the alliances between Rome and France.",1382227200,,2320,4.483412322274882

5682631,5,B00BYEWR2K,"The second and third (final) seasons of the Borgias represents some of the best dramatic TV that has ever been seen. This historical drama tells of the family of the Borgias, the Italian Dynasty with Spanish origins, who ruled the Roman Catholic Church around the turn of the 16 century during the time of Leonardo Da Vinci, and Machiavelli. Jeremy Irons stars as Pope Alexander the VI. Francois Arnaud portrays Alexander's son Cesare Borgia who helps his father rise to the head of the Catholic Church. Holliday Grainger is cast in the role of Lucretia Borgia, Alexander's daughter. The show is a visual feast for the eyes best seen on blu-ray.",1382227200,,645,4.81981981981982

For some strange reason, when you put the disc into your disc player, the playback always jumps right to the first episode on the disc.  If you want to watch a different episode, you have to press the menu button on your remote to go to the menu where you can then select the episode you want to see.  Very strange.

What is even more puzzling is when my Sony disc player displays the name of the disc, it displays ""Oz, Season 3, disc X""  Very weird.  These faults do not in any way detract from the series, but it does call into question the quality control of the manufacture.

No one still knows why they canceled it other then it costs a fortune to make it because it won many awards. Part three of the Showtime series. This is a bit of true history well played out by an outstanding cast. The Borgia Pope was a crook and quite successful at it and this Showtime series is a tell all of this devious family which is well documented in history.

5682646,5,B00BYEWR2K,"Taut plotting and beautiful sets and costumes make this period drama a delight.  I spent all three seasons on the edge of my chair while assorted baddie degenerate cardinals, nobles, and suchlike schemed and plotted to do in the goodie (although degenerate) Borgia family, headed by Jeremy Irons as Pope Innocent VI.

The Italian Renaissance was a complex culture, characterized by ornate language and Machiavellian personalities proficient in multiple intellectual and artistic pursuits, who were hammering out numerous irons in very hot fires.  In this video many authentic details are brought out in passing, and the overall tone reflects the spirit of the times; but dialog and characterization are simplified to appeal to a modern audience and advance the plot.  Irons' Pope, papal as he must be when greeting emissaries and corraling wayward cardinals, is at heart a Morisco peasant, shocked at the toxicological indiscretions of his utterly charming daughter, blind to the vicious ineptitude of his pox-ridden elder son, dismissive, even distrusting, of his brilliant younger son: an iron paterfamilias who is nonetheless easily gulled by his women--daughter, mother, mistress--all working in cahoots.

In short, the Borgias, though wealthy, powerful, and ambitious, engage us ultimately as the kind of people we all know and understand, so that the historical events of their long-gone culture have the vitality of the twists and turns of life.",1380844800,,1452,5.435555555555555

This one starts out right and I am looking forward to watching the rest of it. It looks great in hd as well. It was cancelled due to the fact that its' very expensive to make, and that shows in the lavish costumes and sets.

However, it is not for the faint of heart because it contains a lot of sex and violence as did the first two seasons.  All players in this time of Pope Borgias are devious and treacherous in attempting to gain power and money including the pope himself.  Everyone wanted the power of Rome and what it represented and would do anything to gain the power that the pope held (sort of the ""off with their heads"" mentality of King Henry the VIII of England).  And, the pope was powerful.  Although there are people in today's world who will do anything for the almighty dollar and what it represents, I'm glad that our current pope is humble and giving.

One gets a little tired of what seems to be explicit sex, (probably they were more ""earthy"" in those days?), and graphic violence - somewhere there is an ongoing story buried in this scenario. One cannot fault the acting/costumes. Overall, I am somewhat dissatisfied, but, needless to say, was bound and determined to see the end, which was very dramatic. The Pope's son, Cesare, and daughter, Lucrezia, are so corrupt towards the end, it definitely makes a point that familial influence ultimately tailors their destiny !! Jeremy Irons depiction of Pope Alexander hits just the right balance - is he honestly fooling himself as well as his congregation !!

I have all three seasons and the storyline weaves perfectly between seasons.

The Borgia's--is as close to historical truth as we can get. There isn't a single misplaced actor in the series. It is obvious to me where a layperson would miss; the writer did his homework!

Well Done!--I,who also writes historical fiction, highly recommend this three part series. Shame on the Hollywood money people for canceling the drama. Only Hollywood can create such exceptional work and then let idiots ruin it for us.

5682698,5,B00BYEWR2K,"The Borgias is a Showtime period drama set in late 15th century Rome. The specific focus of the show concerns Rodrigo Borgias' ascent to the papacy and his efforts to stay in power through the turbulent events of the period.

The show commences in 1492, the year that Alexander VI became Pope. Of course, most people will also recognize that year as the same in which Columbus discovered the New World. This date therefore provides an easy connection to the historical timeline that most people can easily relate to. Once Borgia becomes Alexander VI, the saga begins, and the series describes the machinations made to maintain Alexander Sixtus on the throne. This is a difficult and sometimes brutal history, and those that are familiar with this history will not be surprised at the events that unfold in the subsequent episodes. The show is largely historically accurate, both in the broad brush strokes and also in some of the minute details.

Season Three picks up with the dramatic ending from the last episode of Season Two, and continues to play out the historical drama to a relative high level of accuracy from the actual historical record. There are some dramatic licenses taken, but they appear to be few and far between. It's unfortunate, though, that the series was cancelled during this season before the fourth season could be made, because we can here more clearly seen the story arc as it would have unfolded in that last planned season. But the show's cancellation should not be a reason to not get the released three seasons, because the series has a great amount of content that it tells, and you'll find yourself having a mini history lesson as you watch the show unfold.

There is little reason to repeat the expansive written information that has already been provided about this series by other reviewers, including the specific details covered in each episode. We can easily confirm, however, the extremely high quality production values of the show. We can also echo the view that the acting in the show is extremely well done. As companies like Showtime, HBO, and Netflix continue to make extremely lush, well-developed dramas, we see that this trend has now achieved the pinnacle of television production at this current time, one that is now rivaling, and sometimes, surpassing, full screen movies. This is also the case with The Borgias. This is a show that is supremely well done, and it shows in every scene. The art sets, the costumes, the colors, the settings, and on and on are superbly well done. In fact, it seems we are watching here something of a quality level that would not even normally be seen in a full screen movie.

The acting, of course, is of greatest importance, and we see with an outstanding cast including Jeremy Irons that the cast are up to every bit of the task and make the story come alive on the screen. It has been rumored that the show cost Showtime approximately $2.5 million per episode to make. That runs out to roughly $25 million per season. When you watch the show on a high definition television BluRay player, you can see where some of that money was spent. The show is lush, lavish, and it makes one marvel at how such shows are being made  today. Filming was carried out primarily in Hungary, and there is some use of CGI and certain scenes, but these are barely noticeable, and in fact sometimes are not noticeable at all. The architectural backgrounds to many of the scenes are simply superb, even when they are CGI.

The Borgias had a loyal following for the first three seasons on Showtime. However, in a trend that we have heard all too often before, ratings were not as high as Showtime had hoped, particularly in Season Three. The show was originally slated for a four season run, but because the ratings were slightly disappointing in Season Three, Showtime decided to cancel the series at the end of the third season. This means that the planned Season Four of The Borgias does not exist, and likely will never be made. (This is not unlike the situation that occurred with the critically acclaimed show ""Boss,"" starring Kelsey Grammer, which was canceled after two seasons because of low ratings, but was considered to be one of the best dramatic shows on television in recent memory.) But in spite of the disappointment that no Season Four is to be made, this is no reason not to watch The Borgias for those first three seasons. (The same is true of Boss, as well; watching its first two seasons can be an amazing experience, in spite of the truncated ending of the show.)

The Borgias is an excellent historical drama that will help you to learn much about the period, and the papacy of Alexander VI. It has some difficult scenes, but the show has seemingly done a reasonable job of attempting to portray the story without making it so consistently brutal that one would not wish to watch it. Watching the show in Blu-ray format with a high-definition television can provide some of the sharpest clearest and most colorful presentations that we've seen to date.

This is an easy five-star recommendation for anyone enjoying historical dramas, or for those interested in the period.",1377129600,3,5163,4.754464285714286

5682708,1,B00BYEWR2K,"I'm giving this one star because this series just ends without any kind of closure.  In fact, I've cancelled my subscription with showtime because of this. The series was nothing short of brilliantly done and they decide to just cut it off without any kind of explanation, so it is as though you are watching a movie that you enjoy and it just cuts off and that's it folks!  That's what you are going to get watching this series and feel like you were ripped off. No the Pope does not die. Even Cesare Borgia does not die in battle like he's supposed to. What kind of rip off is this to just cut off just like that. So don't buy it.

I wrote to Showtime the following statement: ""I think it was very cruel of you to cut off ""The Borgias"" Season 3 like that.  It is as though you were watching a great movie and it cuts off and that's it folks.  I have cancelled my subscription to Showtime and boycotting you all because of this cruelty, and all of my friends are doing the same.  I think you all are horrible evil people to cut off The Borgias like that without any kind of closure and I will never again buy anything you all put out ever again!""

I suggest you all boycott Showtime and never buy anything they make again, at least until they make Season 4 and put closure to this.",1376956800,4,1282,4.186991869918699
5682709,5,B00BYEWR2K,"In this season they try to throw a lot of significant moments at you so it moves very fast. The upside to this is that it is by far one of the most eventful shows I have seen in a long time. The downside is that there will be some moments where some things seem a bit ""cheezy"" or under acted. Don't let that take over your judgement. Be understanding and know that it is because they have to move quick for you to get the real BANG at the end. They do an amazing job at showing how power can aide in transforming a person, by bringing various qualities to light that would otherwise lay dormant. In some instances this may seem like power corrupting and at others it might seem like power enhancing. Both Borgia children really come center stage in this season; doing so much more than in both other seasons combined. It was not predictable at all and you could give this show 5 stars on the clothing and decor alone!

The power of family, the power of a name. Prior to this season I don't think I spent much time thinking about how many things are only possible through the trust you can gain from family and close friends. The deception, the strategy, the trickery. Indeed, without the bonds that the various families share much more brute force warfare would be needed and the show conveys that. No odds are too great so long as the opponent has utilized every possible method of tricking his opponent. This theme comes up a lot and it is amazing how many lives get saved through deception and dark planning vs traditional warfare.

The only thing missing I would say would be a genuine sense of love. I could never really see or understand why any two characters loved each other with the exception of perhaps the Pope and his wife. For ever other character I felt their love was forced; no real back story or battle required for them to be together.

I highly recommend this show. No other series has put fourth the importance of presentation, decor, reputation, trust, honor, friendship, and family. I can't find one word to unit all of those themes but the show itself does a great job of letting you know they are all important and inseparable. In my opinion, this is by far the best out of all 3 seasons.",1376784000,,2213,4.405867970660147
5682710,4,B00BYEWR2K,"It is the costuming and the scenery that continues to stand out element in this series.  The acting for Ceasare and rodrigo excellent (4), but juan  not so much.  Indeed the Juean character seems to get really to the point where he is unbeleivible....not so much the actors fault but the story makes him waaay to 1 dimensional. Over all the story is some good acting but outstanding sets and costuming, again the filmography was what saved it for me.  I think the Juan storyline lost credibility as Juan became an effective scapegoat for all problems in this very very conflicted family.  Many of the conflict with rodrigos many lovers seemed to contrived, yes i see a bias here, it is a european prospective, but even so after his 1st wives first fit anytime he serially cheated, the female cocolded would just seem to shrug and say ...to the effect ...well thats rodrigo.  Well i understand the european point of view....but that is taking it to far, particularly whithin the circumstances...he seemed amazingly immune to problems here other than the ""bad guy"" enemys who discuss his lechery but thats it. ...I do think irons did play part of the apostate well, he asked for forgiveness but so compromised his soul it was meaningless...i think the frustration will well acted as aell as the deep self hatred that character had.",1376784000,,1329,4.781659388646288

You should be praised and chastised for the Borgias.  The first for the ongoing quality of the series; the second for closing shop at the third season, leaving a dedicated and loyal viewership hanging.  There was talk of a Borgia movie to wrap things up--sensible, with cast and settings at hand.  But Showtime decided against this.

Viewers are where profits ultimately come from.  You should study this truth, and rethink your decision on the concluding film.  Hopefully others will communicate this to you as well.",1376352000,4,533,5.057471264367816

5682719,5,B00BYEWR2K,"It is such a shame that this is the end of The Borgias. I know in the end it came down to budget, but why start something, try to keep it as authentic as possible, and then abandon it? It's sad because this series is beyond beautiful. Lush, and jarring and opulent. So nearly perfect. Sure, it's not very historically accurate...in fact, hardly at all. But I was so utterly hooked way back in season 1, that it truly didn't matter all that much to me. The characters are intriguing, the costumes, to die for. The acting is just superb, once again thanks to Jeremy Irons who just HAS to be ridicuolusly perfect no matter who he plays. The entire supporting cast is honestly just as good, with extra attention paid to Sean Harris who plays Micheletto with such a sad, but ferocious spirit. So many heartbreaking moments here in this Season. Just the intrigue and mystery, war and incest, angst galore, is enough to constitute The Borgias as one of the most well-done series in quite a long while. Neil Jordan is just so good at what he does. He knows exactly how to set the mood, how to toy with the audience. It's maddeningly delirious and it really is a shame to end it like this. Though I must say, the ending was sublimely delicious, and not a cliffhanger in sight. But then again, what constitutes an ending? Who is to say what is a right place to leave things, and what is wrong? In this case, knowing there was supposed to be more is driving me a bit mad. Like dangling a carrot.

5682722,1,B00BYEWR2K,"If you watched the first two seasons of The Borgias, then you'll probably watch this one for the sake of completeness (which will be hindered as this turned out to be the last season after all). There're several theories of why this happened. I suspect Neil Jordan simply lost interest in the project and wanted to get back to making movies. Or, perhaps, the writers simply backed themselves into the corner by deviating from the historical events and persons the show is supposed to be based on so much so that it has become mostly a historical fantasy.

I suppose the show can still be enjoyed if all you care about is nice visuals and further development of Lucrezia and Cesare's relationship. That (and Michelotto) is the only bright spot for me in this mess of threads left hanging (what happened to della Rovere?) and unbelievable plotlines. Caterina Sforza as the main villain and leader of resistance against the Pope, the entire Neapolitan adventure of Lucrezia the Kingmaker - none of this has almost any basis in reality.

Oh, and I really don't understand what happened to Cesare's hair. It was good in Season 1, why did they have to tinker with it? Francois Arnaud is a handsome man, but the hair in this season doesn't suit him at all. Yes, it's a superficial complaint, but as I've said, it's a superficial show anyway. While I actually did enjoy it in the beginning, I've come to believe they've largely wasted the budget and the superior cast they managed to assemble.",1376006400,3,1485,4.707692307692308

5682725,5,B00BYEWR2K,"The Borgias is IMO the best TV Show ever produced.  It has everything.  Best writing, beautiful costumes, makeup and hair, scenery, lighting, music and choir and not to forget a fantastic group of amazing actors to carry it off.  Jeremy Irons (Rodrigo Borgia - patriarch) who becomes Pope Alexander V1, Francois Arnaud as his highly intelligent and ambitious son Cesare Borgia, Holiday Grainger, his beautiful and savvy daughter Lucrezia, Sean Harris as the loyal and dangerous Michelletto, Cesare's bodyguard and friend, Joanne Whalley as Vanozza dei Cattenei, Rodrigo's ex mistress and mother of the children, and Lotte Verbeek as Julia Farnese, Rodrigo's younger mistress, David Oakes as Juan Borgia in S1 and S2 but not in S3.  These group of outstanding actors are the glue that holds together the fabric of the storyline from 1492 to about 1501 - ably assisted by Peter Sullivan as Cardinal Sforza and Gina McKee as Caterina Sforza, the Borgia's enemy and Colm Feore as Guiliano della Rovere the Borgias arch nemesis.  Not to forget Julian Bleach's marvellous portrayal of Niccholo Machiavelli and Simon MacBurney's Johann Burchardt.

Neil Jordan has brilliantly plotted a storyline close to actual history in the telling of The Borgias.  There is never a dull moment, the scenes build beautifully and the editing is superb.  Action scenes with Renaissance weaponry is amazing as are the scenery and props.  Direction in Season 3 has been a lot tighter too and all the threads are well linked between episodes.

The Borgias is a visual feast, providing passion, plotting, curruption, ambition and politics all wrapped up in the marvellous package of Neil Jordan's visionary expose of Renaissance Italy.

This wonderful show has been cruelly cut off at the knees without a proper conclusion by ending it at Season 3.  So much story still to tell and much left unfinished.  The decision by Showtime to cancel, is short sighted and left so many of The Borgia's fanbase furious and upset.  Including me.

A Season 4 or the two hour wrap up movie ""The Borgia Apocolypse"" as written by Neil Jordan is absolutely vital to finish this epic story.",1373414400,27,2144,5.0339943342776206
