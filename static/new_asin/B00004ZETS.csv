7928833,1,B00004ZETS,"Unlike the sublimely trippy Tempest 3000, Freefall is NOT the kind of game that should sell you on a NUON-capable DVD player.  The music and rendered animations are adequate, but the technical elements lack the polish you would find in a game title for a more mainstream system like the Playstation.  Controls are stiff, graphics are plain (think first-generation PSX or Saturn), and gameplay is enervating.  I bought it because of the interesting premise (who wouldn't want to be a skydiving supercop), but the bland visuals and total lack of speed and energy make this game a choice for NUON completists only.  It just doesn't cut it in today's marketplace.",1028332800,,659,4.963636363636364
7928834,4,B00004ZETS,"Freefall is a great game with a fresh concept. It's highly unlikely that you'll play anything quite like it on any other platform. The controls are tough to get used to at first (you'll definitely want to invest in a gamepad for this title!) but persevere and you'll be able to appreciate the game and the originality behind it. I must admit that the graphics are sharp and extremely crisp, even on a standard A/V connection. The NUON processor definitely shows its power in Freefall. If you're looking for a challenging game that will take some time to master, I recommend you pick up Freefall and try it out. A fine example of Nuon gaming at its best!",998956800,3,653,4.5423728813559325
7928835,4,B00004ZETS,"Freefall by Total Arkade Software is one of the most unique titles to be released on any platform in recent memory, indeed, titles this far off the mainstream usually are frowned upon. That being said, TAKS has crafted what can best be described as a 360 degree free-falling joyride. As a member of the jump police of 3050 A.D., it's your job to keep the skies clear of joyriders and trouble-makers, problem is that there are a lot of lunatics out there. Freefalling at top-speed, you must rotate in 360 degrees while blasting and manuevering, taking out targets to complete missions and 'persueding' criminals to see things your way. Dynamic control scheme, ground-breaking gameplay & techno soundtrack all contribute to a game that breaks the action shooter mold in every conceivable way.",978048000,3,790,4.992424242424242
7928836,5,B00004ZETS,"Freefall 3050 A.D. is a totally new concept in video gaming. You are a cop(known as the Drop Police) in the year 3050 and you fall down shafts throughout skycities exceeding speeds of 100 mph(up to about 180) being able to rotate in 360 deg. avoiding obstacles and blasting bad guys, upholding the law and such. Over 16 mission based levels. This game is VERY hard at first, but once you get the hang of it, it is one of the coolest and original games there is. Once you get the hang of it, it is really fun as well(which is always a good thing ;) It's very cool to have an original game like this, and this is another purchase that is a reason to buy a NUON-enhanced DVD player. In fact, you will only find this game for NUON-enhanced DVD players, and it would definently be worth your time to take a look! Received a great preview/review by Gamefan magazine that I think explains it very well.",972604800,17,895,4.3017751479289945
