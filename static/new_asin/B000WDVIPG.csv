2967220,4,B000WDVIPG,"Word problems have been a problem for people for years.  The trick is pulling out what you need to know to solve the problem. This dvd has taken that anxiety away from my girls who are in the 2nd and 5th grade. As a mom, I have to make study and homework fun and as stress free as possible so it's a positive experience. Rock and Learn products help me with this quite a bit. I don't mind spending money on these dvd's at all.",1379721600,6,426,4.011764705882353

2967223,1,B000WDVIPG,"This video is boring and does not even teach word problems as it states it does, just regular math problems.  I was hoping to teach my students things like make a list, act it out, etc.  Essentially, you watch a standardized test taken and videotaped -snoozer.
