7071784,2,B00UXWOR9K,"I really wanted to like this, but so far it is just boring.  Uninspired plot with main character motivations that make zero sense.  Fully 1/3 of the first four episodes (all I could make it through) where scenes of scantily clad girls holding each other in compromising positions while crying in pain.  Not interesting, not fun, and the only way I think it could possibly be sexy is if the viewer is some kind of sadist.  I expected more from the studio that brought us Kite, Elfen Lied, Queens Blade, Ikki Tousen, Aesthetica of a Rogue Hero, etc.",1433548800,6,547,4.551020408163265
7071785,3,B00UXWOR9K,"The series starts off slowly and pretty painfully, and most of its ecchi scenes are NOT for the feint of heart, BELIEVE ME.
BUT it does have more than its fair share of pretty memorable and funny moments, and it really shows that women of all kinds should NEVER be underestimated.
And its messages are clear and kinda admirable, actually: if you take on all of the pain, oppression, abuse, and humiliation that life throws at you, fight through it all, stand your ground, and NEVER EVER GIVE UP until you HAVE come out on top of it all beautifully and quite possibly victoriously, then you really do have what it takes to be THE STRONGEST IN THE WORLD.

3 out of 5 stars here, but on a scale of 1 to 5, I would have to give it a 3.22 out 5.
I know that's probably kinda weird, but I rest my case here.

If you want a short anime series that kills time all at once AND does so in a way that makes you want to watch more of this show to see the scenes that make you laugh, want to fight on with the heroic Sakura here, kick butt like her, and see more than handful of very lovely, badass ladies, then THIS an anime series for you.",1432598400,3,1128,4.076576576576577

7071787,2,B00UXWOR9K,"So, I watched the first episode with my friend on Crunchyroll, and by the end of it we were half dead.  It would only be months later until we had the inspiration to marathon something bad, and this came back into the picture.  The aching cries of this series will forever be scarred into our minds like the amount of wrestling that went on in this show.  10/10",1430092800,3,361,4.279411764705882
7071788,3,B00UXWOR9K,"When I heard there was another ecchi, fanservice-heavy anime coming out from ARMS, the producer of the popular anime, Queen's Blade, I was pretty excited. After watching WBTSITW, i was pretty disappointed. The show is heavy with fanservice, but 95% of it are the same cleavage and panty shots over and over again, most of which aren't nude.

In my opinion, the show is just boring. There's one episode where Sakura is put into a certain wrestling move for pretty much the entire episode and she just cries in pain the whole time. Just really bad filler. You would think a show where the setting is mostly in a wrestling ring could be interesting but it's not. The ring never changes, it always the same boring white, no new colors, pictures, etc.. It just seems like lazy design to me.

I had to force myself to sit through it, hoping it would pick up and reward my time but it does not. It's a fairly predictable ending and the payoff isn't worth the time invested. I will say the animation is pretty good, but that's about the only good thing I can say about it.

 I'm more of a ecchi/fanservice anime kind of guy and usually enjoy stupid, low-brow animes focused on boobs, but I still can't recommend this anime. Perhaps if there was more nudity, but alas there is not. Skip it, save yourself the time and just rewatch Queen's Blade again.",1430092800,36,1342,4.510288065843621
7071789,5,B00UXWOR9K,I played the first episode in the middle of the day with loud speakers. Now all my neighbors think I watch kinky porn openly at 3 in the afternoon with my windows open.,1428796800,22,168,4.121212121212121
7071790,5,B00UXWOR9K,The perfect fusion of epic wrestling intensity and phenomenal J-Pop Idol fame embedded into this enchanted ecchi anime leaves meek audiences uncomfortably choked into submission and the adamantium-hearted fans surviving all episodes with senses of uncanny achievements similar with real life hardships both physically and spiritually so I fiercely recommend all legitimate anime clubs to launch campaigns in honor of this untouchable masterpiece!!!!!,1457913600,2,450,6.158730158730159
7071791,2,B00UXWOR9K,"The show starts with a fun and ridiculous premise - a pop idol loses a bet and is forced to become a professional wrestler. It soon goes downhill from there. The show is extremely repetitive, both in plot and animation. The number of times you will see the EXACT same scene of the lead pinned by the Boston Crab Hold is enough to stop counting, and each time is the same animation with the wrestler pinning her down swapped for a different color scheme. The repeated animation is also true for the pop music dancing, wrestler finishing moves, and more. Despite that, there is still some tension due a decision the lead character must make. Her choice is taken entirely out of her hands, and it ruins it. However, there is a ton of fan service. While I personally really disliked Wanna Be the Strongest in the World, I can say that people looking for fan service should be at least content with it.",1457740800,,897,4.475609756097561
7071792,1,B00UXWOR9K,"You think this show would be hot watching girls wrestle but No. Anybody enjoy the WNBA, no. Fan service was the only thing that kept me watching and that  was not enough.",1452902400,,170,4.3125
7071793,5,B00UXWOR9K,"Story Synopsis:  Sakura, lead singer of girl group 'Sweet Diva', joins pro wrestling to fight Rio.  Rio is a professional wrestler who looked down on Sakura, her friend, Elena, and pop stars in general.

Wanna Be Strongest in the World, is a better watch then what I initially gathered from its reviews.  The main character of Sakura, hellbent on revenge against a wrestler named Rio, goes through a lot of training and beatings.  Despite me being of the male gender and watching mainly for fluff, I found myself slowly rooting for Sakura during her trials.

It definitely helped that the English vocal actress for Sakura, Elizabeth Lewis, had the vocals down to a tee.  There is a lot of screaming to be heard, and this actress did not spare her lungs.  I completely give her credit in bringing out my emotions, to like and actually root for Sakura as the story progressed.

In contrast, I watched&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tokyo-Ghoul-The-Complete-Season-Blu-ray/dp/B0102AL0RY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tokyo Ghoul: The Complete Season [Blu-ray</a>] with strictly intellectual interest only.  It was a better show in all respects than WBSITW [title].  However, I didn't feel myself having any emotional attachment, to any character in the story.

As for content, 'Wanna Be Strongest in the World' would not be suitable for anybody under 17.  There is some nudity via shower scenes, and the 'camera' has a mind of its own during the matches - the face of characters isn't always the focus.

Still, it's 'deviant' rating is lower than that of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/High-School-DxD-The-Series-Blu-ray/dp/B00CU6WBMW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">High School DxD: The Series [Blu-ray</a>].  With no male protagonist in WBSITW, there is no focus on male gawking, fondling, or pursuit of female flesh.  Instead, there is actually a lot of positive messages and camaraderie.  If you can separate it from the fluff of course.

I don't know if I would recommend 'Wanna Be Strongest in the World', despite the fact that I actually enjoy it.  Most reviewers seem to give it a so-so rating, and it can be seen that way.  So if you'd like to err on the side of caution, wait for a price drop - I myself will add it to my library when it does.

*As of this review, I have watched 6/12 episodes [DUB] via FUNimation streaming service.",1444176000,4,2420,5.382978723404255
7071794,4,B00UXWOR9K,the anime was ok it's its to much submission orgasm in the middle of the ring I have to cut down my tv so people want think I'm watching wrestling porn but it's a cool show to me,1444176000,2,178,3.710526315789474
7071795,2,B00UXWOR9K,"I thought this show had a lot of potential but ended up falling way short.

Some of the things that hurt the show.

Pacing - Too much time spent just hearing Sakura moaning. Ok, we get it, it hurts.
Cheap Animation - It happens, fans know shows have to keep to a budget but too much cutting of action scenes and recycling wears on folks.
Uninspired character designs - how many characters have long black hair with the same body style? Sakura, Misaki and Juri all look alike to me. Just slightly different hair color with different clothes and eye color. The world champ Jackall looks a bit too much like Freezing's Elizabeth and Girls und Panzer's Kay.
Too many characters - I thought the Idol group was ok, but there should have been a lot less wrestlers. Adding the Moe late in the show (Ep 9) was just a waste of time.
Show's Audience - The show started teasing some fanservice early on but they got away from that, if you are going to make a fanservice show go all in or don't bother. Idols and wrestling are good hooks to get people to check out the show, but not implementing the two sides made the show blah. They could have added in another song for Sweet Diva but considering the final product I guess that would have been asking too much.",1443312000,12,1249,4.356223175965665

8708667,4,B00UXWOR9K,"Sakura Hagiwara is a female idol singer who wants to be the strongest wrestler in the world. That is mainly what the show is about. We watch as she chooses her path to becoming the strongest fighting various opponents and dealing with the hardships of wrestling. Besides the story this show is all about ecchi and for me that was my favorite part. There are scenes that get you excited and are intense when it came to wrestling matches. So much boobs and a lot of booty. 3/6 of the OVA are purely for fan service with a ton of bare breasts. The last 3 deal with a tag team match. If you like sexy girls, big boobs and a lot of booty then I think you will enjoy this show.",1518825600,,671,4.129770992366412

8708670,2,B00UXWOR9K,"For the love of - how many times did the main character have to lose in exactly the same way? All that whimpering was as boring to me as it was for the audience in the anime. One theme: Don't give up. Nothing subtle about this one. A combination and comparisons between the two worlds of idols and professional wrestling make this a weird anime. As the majority of the dialogue feels like whining or crying out, it's difficult to enjoy the Japanese voice acting. So much crying out is not my thing, it made this very difficult to watch. The animation is ok, with a fair bit of fanservice - especially if you're into zooms of crotches. The characters and story are pretty poor. Where is the coaching?! 50 loses? It was an interminable four episodes before the main character finally stopped whining. Perhaps a real amateur would find themselves losing to the same move, but this was boring. And the reward to the viewer for getting past this? More losses, but it finally moves on to the training montages, better fighting back, and the slow return of her fans from her idol days, plus some wrestling fans. And then the wrestling turned into K1? The set-up, with the collision of wrestling and idols, especially with its focus on various characters affected by the choices, could have been really good. But the series lacked punch. The characters and pacing sapped the emotional impact from it. I do like that no one is evil, just doing their thing. Could be 3 stars, because it clings to the idol side, giving it a better dimension. But all that screaming drops it to 2.",1490227200,,1569,4.567375886524823
