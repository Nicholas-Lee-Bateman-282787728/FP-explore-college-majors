6999897,5,B00T40NVIK,"Wonderful production, full of laughs and surprises!  I've never seen a Shakespeare play with men performing the women's roles and I must say it was brilliantly--and comically--done.  It actually adds to the humor, because the men aren't trying to convince the audience that they are women, just portraying women as best they can, without it being clownish or offensive.  On the contrary, doing the play this way gives a real feeling for how it must have been performed back in Elizabethan times.  As a big fan of Shakespeare, I was delighted!",1430352000,32,542,4.923076923076923
6999898,5,B00T40NVIK,"Shakespeare would be humbled and honored by this masterpiece of a production where everything is adorned with perfection and executed with grace, beauty and eloquence.

6999899,5,B00T40NVIK,Although this production was unbelievably brilliant and necessary for your library if closed captions/subtitles would be helpful to you then you will want to buy instead from Amazon.co.uk as Opus Arte provides them (Region Free) whereas Kultur does not. The price is very close to the same and shipping less than you would imagine. While you're over there pick up a bundle of Opus Arte/Globe collaborations. Kultur skimps again (confirmed).,1425600000,53,440,5.3
6999900,5,B00T40NVIK,"Brilliant production, makes Shakespeare accessible to people who don't think they 'get' Shakespeare (my hubby - he Loved It!). Superb acting, directing, staging. Wildly fun, funny, brazen, witty, tense, gentle, clever. The Globe also offers interviews with some of the cast - these interviews are also very helpful in further understanding the times, the society, the traditions,  social norms,  and  the clothing/costumes.  Great entertainment.",1497744000,,445,5.90625
6999901,4,B00T40NVIK,"A first-rate theater experience. Stephen Fry and Mark Rylance are wonderfully entertaining.  Two master performers.  Unless you have read the play recently or are familiar with it, it is hard to follow the lines spoken by Aguecheek, Belch and Feste.

6999908,5,B00T40NVIK,"STUNNINGLY good: superbly acted, outrageously funny - and the proximity of the audience makes it all the more ""real"" effective.  I do not hope ever to see a more lively and wonderful Twelfth Night, and the all-male cast were superb - what a feeling we get of being there, in an Elizabethan theater!  Brilliantly filmed and the dialogue crystal clear, by actors who now not only how to ""put it across,"" but also to make it undersytootr - at the end we were all clapping at the TV, something I have never done before.

I am now going to buy a Globe production of several more plays.  If they are nearly as good, it will be money well spent!",1484438400,,638,4.336134453781512

6999929,5,B00T40NVIK,"If there's a better video recording of a stage-mounted Shakespeare play, I haven't seen it -- and WHAT a production. It was taped in the new Globe Theatre in London with a single set that's both beautiful and amazingly flexible. Best of all is the cast, headed by the finest stage actor in the world, Mark Rylance, who is both hilarious and touching as the Countess Olivia. (The cast, like Shakespeare's original casts, is all-male, which gives rise to one of Shakespeare's favorite sources of humor -- male actors playing female characters who are disguised as males.) The problem with the play in most modern productions are the clown scenes with Sir Toby and Sir Andrew, which depend for a lot of laughs on puns that no longer make any sense at all. They're endurable here, but the revelation, aside from Rylance, is the Malvolio side plot, which is usually pretty much a drag in that modern audiences generally feel more sympathy toward the pompous house steward than Shakespeare's presumably did. Here, though, he's played by the wonderful Stephen Fry, and not only do you understand every line he speaks as clearly as if it had been written yesterday, but he brings a kind of steely strength to the scenes in which he's shamed, and that helps the viewer from watching the rest of the play in a mildly depressed state. When Rylance and the company did this in New York, they alternated it with a production of ""Richard III"" that, by all accounts, was as fine as this. Wish they had put it on video. Oh, and the video direction is brilliant -- never intrusive but always picking out the place on the stage where the audience's attention should be. We'll watch it at least once a year.",1451174400,10,1688,4.648829431438127
6999930,5,B00T40NVIK,"Now my favorite performance of any Shakespeare tale!
I watched this and have to admit I originally bought it because I'm a huge fan of the Bard, but also of Stephen Fry--well, he's great in this, but he's not the greatest part! Mark Rylance is absolutely amazing as Olivia, and had me in stitches with the subtle humor that they were able to convey--you can't get this from merely reading the words, and I'm so glad and caved in and bought the DVD--I will now ""invest"" in ALL the globe's productions, and this is a great start to my collection.  I did have other DVDs (particularly Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet, Othello, Henry V and so on) but those are movie productions and as such, they're amazing, but this--this leaves me spellbound in its theatricality--the sets, the music, the musicians alone deserve 5 stars!  It's amazing.  I've had it less than 3 days and I've watched it twice already!",1449964800,,893,4.67515923566879
6999931,5,B00T40NVIK,"Mark Rylance is an absolute comic genius as Olivia. Stephen Fry is the best Malvolio I've seen. This production, at the reconstructed Globe, is a glorious all-male rendition of the play. Be prepared for pure joy. I have never seen so much physical humor teased out of any Shakespeare play before. The only negative comment I can make is that I was annoyed by the ""groundlings"" leaning elbows and heads on the stage, but I guess that is probably what they did in the 1600s, too.",1449705600,3,477,4.558139534883721

6999933,5,B00T40NVIK,"Brilliant. Brilliant. Brilliant. HOLY HELL -- utterly BRILLIANT. It begins carefully, as per the dictates of the Bard's character-driven words (i.e., there ain't no explosions or blood, so it's kinda slow for the folk who love the Transformers movies). But roughly 10 minutes in, the fireworks begin. Yes, the cast are all men -- you forget by the middle of Act II. And then you're done until the end. Twelfth Night is one of Shakespeare's TRUE ensemble pieces. Almost every role is juicy enough to catapult the actor playing the part. In this production, you'll find several. Stephen Fry and Mark Rylance are showstoppers -- they both sneak up on you, too. The break-out character for me in this production is Sir Andrew Aguecheek, as portrayed by Angus Wright (Barty Crouch, Senior, of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire). Peter Hamilton Dyer's Feste was (again, for me) the weakest link in this almost flawless presentation of my favorite Shakespeare comedy.",1449014400,,962,4.9813664596273295

6999935,5,B00T40NVIK,I have all of Shakespeare's plays  and multiple copies of many including Twelfth Night.  This particular production is a real standout with all the characters being played brilliantly by male actors.

6999941,5,B00T40NVIK,"Shakespeare performed at its very best!  Rylance (Olivia), Fry (Malvoleo) and Chahidi (Maria), especially, are brilliantly comic in their roles.  It's fun to show this to young people and others who claim not to like or understand Shakespeare: although they may miss the meaning of some racy double entendres or morsels of complex word play, they will surprise themselves by finding much to delight in and laugh at.",1440633600,4,415,5.088235294117647
6999942,5,B00T40NVIK,Any show with Rylance is worth watching. One of the best actors working today. Barnett is also a plus.,1440374400,2,102,4.421052631578948
6999943,5,B00T40NVIK,"This is the immediate, visceral experience of Shakespeare that I never had in high school or college. I couldn't believe how wonderful it was. I saw Richard III with Mark Rylance in New York and it was such a revelation to me that I ordered this DVD. And again it was wonderful. The story and action was never presented TO the audience, as in 'this is good for you...now take your vitamin.' Instead it was a delight: surprising, funny, dramatic, sad and witty. Mark Rylance, in particular, plays his part as if the words and thoughts are occurring to him as spontaneously to him as to me. Even though I was not physically there I still felt a connection with the men (it's an all-male production) on screen. So wonderful! I watched it with my kids, 13 and 10, and they loved it too. While they didn't understand many of the phrases they nevertheless understood the actors and laughed out loud--even asking me to rewind and play some parts again! They also felt very sorry for Stephen Fry at being so ""abused."" He can't help it, he has such a sympathetic face. I think this production would be amazing to anyone, whether they know the words by heart or are hearing them for the first time. Loved it!",1438300800,14,1198,4.5

6999948,5,B00T40NVIK,"I saw this production when it played on Broadway and was absolutely astounded.  A lot was made about the all-male cast, but that's not what made it a great production - it was the sheer brilliance of the performances and direction, both of which transcended any hint of novelty.  Mark Rylance as Olivia is astonishing, and he is surrounded by similiar high-quality performances.  This is THE definitive production of one of Shakespeare's best plays.",1435881600,7,449,5.04054054054054
6999949,5,B00T40NVIK,"Having seen Mark Rylance as Thomas Cromwell in the Masterpiece series WOLF HALL, I have recently become a huge fan of the actor. He is amazing as Olivia in TWELFTH NIGHT, and every bit as excellent in this comedy as he is in a drama. The only other actor of this company with whom I was familiar is Stephen Fry, who is great as Malvolio.  I should note that TWELFTH NIGHT is my favorite of Shakespeare's comedies & I have seen it numerous times in very varying productions. This production is the first one I have seen which is done in ""original practices"", which means that it is done as it would have been done in Shakespeare's day - costumes, music, acting style all of Shakespeare's period, and the female parts taken by men. Aside from Mr Rylance, I especially liked the actor who portrayed Maria , Olivia's servant.  The play is presented at the new Globe Theater in London in front of a very appreciative audience. (My only quibble is the reaction shots of the audience - I would much rather have seen what they were reacting to, but it's a small quibble.)
I believe that this is the same production which was brought to Broadway a few years ago . If you like Shakespeare, this DVD is very worth having.",1435881600,20,1210,4.445945945945946

8700204,3,B00T40NVIK,"There's much to like about this performance, and, generally speaking, I have great respect for Mark Rylance's artistry and his courageous advocacy for the Shakespeare authorship question, but here his grossly overacted and buffoonish Olivia ruined it for me on the whole.

While technically a comedy (which in Shakespeare often just means that the stage is not littered with bodies when the play is over), Twelfth Night is often quite melancholy in mood, but you would never have guessed that from this performance. Rylance gives us a clownish, screaming Olivia, usually acting as if he can barely remember his lines; he somehow reminded me of R2-D2's companion 3-CPO here. To make matters worse, the audience, by contagion, bursts into laughter at the most inappropriate spots.

If you want the play itself to be the thing, I would instead recommend the (older) performance from the Stratford Festival (and that's Stratford in Canada), despite the cuts.",1534464000,,954,5.188311688311688

8700206,5,B00T40NVIK,"This DVD shows Shakespeare's comedy at it best.  Like nearly all of the Bard's comedies, ""Twelfth Night"" nurses a sharp nettle, namely the sadistic treatment of Malvolio.  London' Globe Theatre grasps the nettle by using the *Adorable* Steven Fry as the Puritan steward.  Our reaction to the torture of Malvolio is heightened by Fry's essentially sweet interpretation.  How can the mistreatment of so adorable a man qualify as 'comedy'?  As always, Shakespeare challenges us to explore how cruel people can be to anyone who is pronounced to be 'Other.'

Equally effective is Sir Mark Rylance as Olivia. A note of explanation here:  The Globe often uses men to portray women, as this was the custom in Shakespeare's day.  Rylance may not be my favourite Thomas Cromwell in ""Wolf Hall"" -- but he shines as Olivia, milking every laugh to be found in the script. His shocked reaction to seeing Malvolio in yellow garters is priceless.

The Globe players all display aristocratic 'careless ease' -- 'sprezzatura' -- in this enchanting play.  They explore and manipulate the text in ways which are authentic and inventive.  If anyone reading this is a teacher, please buy this DVD for your class!  You will not regret the investment.  10/10 for this peerless edition.",1522627200,,1261,5.0048076923076925

Mark Rylance, Stephen Fry,and a host of talent are a joy to watch and I did begin to appreciate the humor of a somewhat clich plot. It was filmed during an actual performance. Hearing rather than reading was an important experience for me as a reader.",1503792000,,416,4.56

8700213,5,B00T40NVIK,"Stephen Fry and Mark Rylance are brilliant. Excellent depiction of the bard's play from The Globe Theater. If you have ever been there (I have), you can appreciate how wonderful this must have been to watch. Small, exquisite touches like Rylance hovering from stage right to stage left, nary a footstep seen. Many laugh out loud moments.",1498780800,,337,4.9298245614035086
