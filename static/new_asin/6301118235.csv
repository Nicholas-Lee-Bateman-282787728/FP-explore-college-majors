7809710,4,6301118235,"This is an early Jazzercise tape for home exercise- released in 1988 Jazzercise founder Judi Sheppard Missett takes you through  an 8 minute warm up, 33 minutes of aerobics including lots of cardio pumping low and high impact dance moves, then a 10 minute cool down.

AS always with Jazzercise start out with plenty of floor space, comfortable clothes and then go- choose your level to start with and pick up the pace as you improve.

Good cardio work to mix up your schedule of weight training/ sculpting routines.",1111968000,9,515,4.764044943820225
