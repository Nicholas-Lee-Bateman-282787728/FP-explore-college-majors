2204351,2,B000784X1C,"This movie claims to be based on the book ""One Child"" by Torey Hayden, but I have read the book and this movie is a very superficial rip-off of the book. The movie overlooks many important details from the book and doesn't take time to properly develop the characters. If you read the book, you come away feeling like you have experienced something life changing. That's because Torey Hayden writes with such intense feeling and emotional depth. This movie barely touches the surface of what we find in the book. The movie, of course, is about a dedicated special education teacher who tries to break through the wall of defenses that this six-year-old girl has built up around her. The child has suffered so much abuse and neglect that she is incapable of trusting anyone. The movie doesn't spend enough time showing what this child was like before the teacher finally broke through to her. And the movie also doesn't spend enough time exploring the range of emotions that go through the mind of the teacher (as well as the other children) as the child slowly begins to emerge from her self-imposed emotional prison to join the real world. I have found that movies are almost never as good as the books they are based on. But at least some movies try to get close to what the book is saying. However, this movie doesn't even seem to try. It just glosses over the book in a half-hearted attempt to entertain its audience and toy with their emotions without giving them anything of real substance. Well, I say ""shame on them"". In my honest opinion you should forget this movie and read the book. The book was published in 1981 and is available through Amazon.com. If you read the book first, I can almost guarantee you won't like the movie. At least that was my experience.",1319414400,2,1772,4.610759493670886

2204353,4,B000784X1C,"This was a made for television movie that I saw as a teen, and thought it was good. I bought this movie, and I still think it's good. Kathy Lee Crosby plays the teacher, Maggie, and does a wonderful job. She lives with her boyfriend, and Kathy Lee is a special education teacher at a public school. One day she gets a new student, Caitlin, played by Ashlee Lauren, and she's a trouble child that was left by her mother at a young age, by abandonment. She ties her to a fence on the freeway and never comes back for her, so she's raised by her poverty stricken father, who is so poor he can't afford clothes and proper things for little Caitlin. She is only six years old, and she's is evil. She vandalizes property, smears excrement on walls and attacks other children in the classroom. The state has branded her as psychotic. When Maggie tests Caitlin, she realizes how smart she is, and finds that she is way above her age level. With love from her teacher, and patience, she turns herself around, and becomes a more ""tamed child"", and can function properly in class. Just when Caitlin is doing so well in school, she gets molested by her father's friend while in his care. Caitlin then has a major setback, but is so loved by her teacher, she comes around and survives the ordeal. Maggie does such an awesome job with Caitlin that she even challenges the law to help her be educated. This is a true story about what a person can do for someone else they feel is worth the time and effort. Because of this teacher, Caitlin got to live a normal life and be put into a normal classroom in just one year.",1218153600,3,1603,4.346666666666667

About a young, very disturbed child who attacks other children, vandalises etc. As the child is put into a special needs class at school her teacher realises how hard it is to handle her and cope with her being in her classroom. Social workers decide its best to put her in care due toher behaviour. Anyway, as her school teacher begins to see a difference in her, how she comes out as a bright young child. She will do anything to keep her in her class, determined to help her and stop her from being put into care!

The two begin to bond very well and won't give up on the child!",1152316800,5,643,4.103174603174603
2204355,1,B000784X1C,"Well... This movie was inspired by Torey Hayden's One Child book... Un-inspired seems better to describe this thing! It's NOT the Torey's story, who was true. It's just a bad movie with a crying story...

Buy the book, is really good... But please not this movie... Save your money!...

2204356,5,B000784X1C,"A woman who believes in a troubled child must go against the law in order to help her in this made-for-TV drama, inspired by a true story. Six-year-old Caitlin is a deeply disturbed child whose violent and disruptive behavior prevents her from attending school or day care with other youngsters. However, Special Education teacher Maggie Barnard  senses that there is a great intelligence in Caitlin, and she believes Caitlin can be taught if someone can find out how to reach her. However, not everyone Maggie works with agrees with her assessment, and as she attempts to break through the walls of anger and abuse that surround Caitlin's mind, she must also do battle with a system that sometimes does more harm than good to kids.

This is  such  a well done movie and is a movie that  you find yourself watching again  and again,theres just  something so good about it!",1115164800,7,872,4.773333333333333

8045687,5,B000784X1C,"This film was my first, albeit unofficial, exposure to Torey Hayden's works. She didn't even know it was made until someone told her about it, and they never credited her in the credits.

That aside, This is a wonderful story about a special-needs teacher who isn't afraid to actually CARE about her students. In this day and age of political correctness and stone-stepping where the only ""care"" some teachers do it if their school gets sued or not... This sort of thing is exactly what the world needs. Don't let the porn-sounding title dissuade you. The original work ""One Child"" and this loose adaptation are worth sharing.",1360022400,,626,4.850467289719626
