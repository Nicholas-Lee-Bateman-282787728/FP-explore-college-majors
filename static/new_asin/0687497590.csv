7788178,3,0687497590,Really could have done without the DVD. Really!  The book is great all by itself.,1433289600,,81,4.4
7788179,4,0687497590,Excellent study on the Book of Revelation,1419465600,,41,5.0
7788180,5,0687497590,"Dr Metzger does a good job explaining this difficult and often misunderstood book.  His approach to understanding John's message to us is excellent and consistent with many of the learned scholars I've studied. I recommend this DVD and the supporting books to anyone wanting to understand and possibly teach this book  to others without all the ""spooky stuff"".",1388534400,2,360,5.189655172413793
7788181,1,0687497590,I would not recommend this to anyone. It is not as it is advertised and refers to what was going on during the fall of the roman empire rather than prophocy,1377302400,,156,4.064516129032258
7788182,5,0687497590,"My Bible study group appreciated the way this series was presented.

It allowed each of us to consider the book of Revelations rather than getting caught up in the hysteria of the Left Behind series.

Although the video could have benefited from additional presentors, it still gave us enough reinforcement to move into excellent discussions.",1269561600,,342,5.2
