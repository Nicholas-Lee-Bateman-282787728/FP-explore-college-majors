Always amusing, and often brilliantly funny, inventive, surreal series about a rich family gone terribly wrong, and the one
sane one trying to hold things together.

Sort of what you might have gotten if George Bernard Shaw, Kaufman and Hart and Monty Python had teamed up to do
a spin on a traditional sitcom.

The acting is terrific, from top to bottom. Even producer Ron Howard's narration is great.

Not every joke works, but as it gets weirder and weirder (and funnier and funnier), all I could think is ""how the hell did
they ever get this on network TV? And thank god they did!""

On re-viewing, I found the first season a little less brilliant, a little more repetitious, but maybe that was because they had
to fill 30+ episodes. The second season, with only 18 episodes, goes through the roof much more often, with more clever
twists and ideas per episode, and more aggressive weirdness. And the third season is truly insane (occasionally over-the-top,
but usually successfully), with the addition of elements like Scott Baio's Bob Lawbla character, and self-referential episodes
like `Save Our Bluths' slyly commenting on the series' coming cancellation - one of the worst mistakes in the history
of television.",1345420800,,1302,4.9
