1648884,5,B00005QJIX,This movie is my FAVORITE movie of all time. Its setting is in a favela in Rio de Janeiro. The setting is up to date unlike the old Orfeu. Its a romantic movie. Its about to unlikly people falling in love while trying to change the ways of people in favelas. There is an awsome carnaval scene that makes you feel like you are in it. To bad you can't jump into the movie! This movie is full of beautiful music ! This is why I had to buy the sound track with it!!!!1 I love it and I hope you do to! Don't miss this one!,1041897600,3,517,3.8411214953271027
1648885,5,B00005QJIX,"I did not see the original ""Black Orpheus"" and I am not from Brazil, but I really loved this movie.  I has a lot of reality from everyday life all around the world.  I got to see a side of Brazil that was wonderfull also, it was shot during he actual carnival.  The colors, the shots, the music it's simply beautiful.  The fact that the movie is a tragedy makes it more wonderful.  I recomend it to anyone who likes to see foreign movies.  I fell in love with the carnival scenes, the excitement of the Brazilians and the costumes are all so beautiful.",1025222400,,552,4.259615384615385
1648886,5,B00005QJIX,"I am giving this 5 stars mainly because it is so much better than the normal foreign film. Most foreign movies just don't seem to have a strong impact on the viewer. This one does! This is supposed to be an updated version of the classic ""Black Orpheus"". I have to say that the original really needed to be updated. The stories are similar yet there are enough differences to keep you interested. The new version is based in a favela (slum) in Rio. A new girl arrives and quickly captures the attention of a local music star that still lives in the favela called Carioca Hill. Real life music star Tony Garrido plays the music star Orpheu who is preparing to lead his local samba parade group to victory at the huge Carnaval Parade which is watched by the entire country. In addition to samba music the film features Brazilian rap and beautiful orchestra scores. The music CD alone is worth the price! Viewing this movie I thought that the love story between the two leads was incredibly moving. This movie is sad, yet happy. Many Brazilians weren't happy with the original ""Black Orheus"". They claimed that it was a fake portrayal of Brazil designed to boost tourism and make Brazil seem exotic. The new ""Orpheu"" will anger some Brazilians with it's violence and negative portrayal of the police and slum life in Brazil's notorios favelas. However this movie really made me think about how our world is and how precious life is. As a side note I should mention that one activity that is growing in popularity in Rio is a jeep tour of a favela. The tours are safe and the favela people appreciate the small yet growing income from these tours.",1016668800,7,1643,4.5728813559322035
1648887,5,B00005QJIX,"I have the original VHS, but it's in Portuguese with no subtitles. I love this movie so much that I've pre-ordered the DVD so I can share it with my non-portuguese-speaking friends.
Not only you get the Orpheus myth in a new light, you get beautiful music, stunning sights from Rio and from the Carnival, and an insight about the ""slum culture"".
Direction is excellent. Murilo Benicio (the drug lord, can also be seen in ""Woman on Top"") steals the movie with great acting in but a few scenes. Toni Garrido (Orfeu) is a better singer than actor, but does a decent job.
If you like this (I'm sure you will), you should also see ""Bossa Nova"", with Amy Irving and Antonio Fagundes, also available in DVD.",1012262400,2,700,4.519685039370079

7950826,3,B00005QJIX,Beautiful but not even close to the original,1410825600,,44,4.625
7950827,2,B00005QJIX,"Some classic films should never be remade. That is of the producers know they will give the very greatest effort.
Such is not the case here. Don't wastes your time and money. Stick with the original. If you must, purchase this dvd just to make comparison. If there must be a remake...change the location and a few plot devices. How about New Orleans, La during Mardi Gras? There's an interesting start. Reference that Marpessa Dawn who playe Eurydice in the 1959 original is from New Orleans. Just a thought.",1347494400,,508,4.719101123595506
7950828,3,B00005QJIX,"Director Carlos Diegues knows how to capture atmosphere with his camera and effects and when that atmosphere is the splendid garish gaudiness of Carnival in Rio de Janeiro there is plenty to entertain the eye.  'Orfeu' as a story, supposedly a re-interpretation of the Orpheus and Eurydice myth updated to current times and set in the slums (favelas) of Rio, is just not there.

The title character Orfeu (handsome and talented singer Toni Garrido) does sing and play his guitar, his playing ends the night and serenades the rising of the sun, but here he a quasi-Rap star, beloved by his townsfolk Eur?dice, and by all the women who come into his view.  Eur?dice (Patr?cia Fran?a) enters his life, as she comes to Rio after the death of her parents in the provinces, and the meeting results in instant love.  There is violence from the police invasions of the slums, drug lords such as Lucinho (a disastrously  misused Murilo Ben?cio who happens to be one of Brazil's biggest stars), female envy from Orfeu's many ex-lovers (Isabel Fillardis, Maria Cei?a), and parental concern from Orfeu's parents Concei??o (Zez? Motta) and In?cio (Milton Gon?alves).  But the story, or at least a semblance of one, gets buried in all the extravagant production of police raids and the Carnival parades: it just ends without much point - except that there is a reprise of the musical theme from 'Black Orpheus' to carry you back down memory lane.

Though the quality of acting is generally substandard by comparison to most great films out of Brazil, the style of acting is supposedly the accepted norm for the popular Brazilian novellas on television.  And the sensual presence of Toni Garrido does raise the quality of the movie. But if the art of 'Black Orpheus' or Jean Cocteau's 'Orphee' is what you are expecting, this film will not satisfy.  If you are looking for a colorful, splashy extravaganza about Rio during Carnival, here is your ticket!  Grady Harp, April 06",1144281600,2,1960,4.876506024096385
7950829,4,B00005QJIX,"You get a decent roller coaster of sights and emotions from the film. The best part of the movie for me is how the main character is forced between his mother's pagan world view, or his father's born again view. He is at the prime of his life and only wanting to have fun, but a death makes him confront his beliefs and start taking life seriously.",1141344000,,348,4.208955223880597
7950830,1,B00005QJIX,"Like a few other reviewers, I really wanted to like Orfeu.  I am fascinated by Brazilian culture, especially the spectacle that is Carnaval.  And, who could pass up listening to a soundtrack by the wonderful Caetano Veloso?

Having seen City of God, however, I believe that director Carlos Viegues presents an overly-romanticized version of life in the favelas.  I can take a little bit of fantasy, but come on!  In present-day Brazil, wealthy urbanites take helicopters from their houses to the city in order to avoid contact with the poor.  How are we to believe that the character of Orfeu, who has supposedly gained famed and fortune through his musical talents, can walk the streets without getting mugged?  Call me a cynic, but I just could not get past this detail.

Another unfortunate aspect of the film, to which others have referred, is the acting.  With a few exceptions, most of it is melodramatic and thus hard to take seriously.  The romance between Orfeu and Eurydice seems hurried - they fall madly in love with one another after one or two brief encounters.  Then there's the police raids of Orfeu's neighborhood, during which  the sargent strolls about the streets amidst the sprays of gunfire.  It just doesn't seem realistic that real cops, whether in Brazil or other countries, would be so careless.

To sum it up, I would recommend Orfeu only to those who are looking for pure fantasy.  Apart from the film's portrayal of Carnaval, there is not much to be learned here.  I suspect that Marcel Camus's original Black Orpheus is a much better movie.",1125014400,2,1570,4.823970037453184
7950831,2,B00005QJIX,"I really wanted to like this movie. Black Orpheus is one of my favorite foreign films.  First of all I liked the brilliant colors and the cinematography was spectacular.  The problem I had with the film is that the actress playing Euridice gave a lackluster performance.  The actress that played Mira should have played Euridice. Secondy, if you're going to bring the story into the 21st century writing is important.  The film while sticking with the basic story line left out some really important components such as the macumba scene in the original.  I guess modern day Brazilians aren't as spiritual as they were 45 years ago. And also it seemed that the focus was more on the violence in modern day Rio than the myth and love story. Which in my opinion took a back seat.  The characters weren't the central focus of this movie.  Very poor direction here.  I will have to say that Toni Garrido is an exellent singer and has an immense amount of presence which was wasted in this movie.",1101600000,10,990,4.617142857142857
7950832,4,B00005QJIX,"This was a pretty well done film. Although it is not as good as the original (1959's ""Orfeu Negro"") it comes pretty close. I would recommend renting both this and the original to compare the two first. This version definitely appeals to a younger crowd than the older version, but it was still produced in a very tasteful, well crafted way. Also, the soundtrack to this film was quite impressive, so if you enjoy the movie be sure to check the music out as well. Unlike a lot of movie soundtracks which don't include tracks from the movie, the soundtrack to this film does a pretty good job of including the music from all the memorable scenes. Overall, this movie is definitely worth checking out.",1074470400,11,698,4.592
7950833,5,B00005QJIX,I stumbled across this movie during early morning.  I watched it until the end.  Next I purchased the DVD.  This is the story of unexpected love that very inspiring.  It shows change and the effects of one soul on another.  The cinematography manages to capture the essence of Carnival without neglecting the story.  It is definitely a DVD purchase.,1054598400,2,349,4.830508474576271
7950834,4,B00005QJIX,"This movie was loosely a remake of ""black Orpheus"". But this one is set in modern day Brasil. I have jiujitsu friends who have told me that life in the slums of Brasil is similar to how it is portrayed in this movie. It has a dark ""Amorres Perros"" feel to it.",1042070400,,259,4.0
