1483701,5,B00005JMAS,"i think eddie is one of the funniest comedians, but if you're easily offended stay away becasue he holds nothing back. i thought this was very funny i also really enjoyed his i got the hook up stand up dvd. i was in tears. if you only wanna buy one, i would recommend that one but if you want two then get this one too they are both very funny but the other one is just crazy!",1077926400,,376,3.896103896103896
1483702,1,B00005JMAS,"This movie, first and foremost, is somewhat funny. Its content, however, is very questionable and highly controversial. Eddie's frequent and bothersome use of the N-word is outrageous. In the beginning of this Documentary, he rationalizes this as follows: the more I use the N-word, the lesser power it has. To me, this is quite infantile. The more you say any word, the greater power it has. This is a fact. Advertisers, for example, are fully aware of this; and that's why they bombard us with their brand names every day through billboards, frequent TV-ads, etc.
The last, but not least, controversial and bothersome issue is failure to realize the futility of physical punishment of kids by their respective parents. Eddie somewhat, believe it or not, subtly encourages parents to be tough on their kids in punishing them severely. Punishment accomplishes nothing but encourages rebellion even more. It's a proven research. Eddie himself, as well, appraises his mom for beating him inhumanely when he was a kid; and he gives her and her punishment the credit for his success. This, however, is questionable since Eddie himself mentions he was just released from prison for double-homicide. Physical punishment doesn't work. Early childhood discipline through love-colored advise and admonition is the key to bring forth fruitful young people. I am not, someway or another, one of those parents who abuse this style of discipline and end up being friends to their children and not parents. Discipline is the key word to be noticed here. These are only some of the controversial issues the movie is packed with. It's recommendable to note, if you buy the DVD, the controversial nature these issues to avoid systematic brainwashing through entertainment. Best of luck to all.",1069459200,4,1776,5.14878892733564
1483703,3,B00005JMAS,"This movie had it's moments. I wasn't sure about renting it because ""I Got The Hook Up Comedy Jam"" was horrible,but this sounded funny. It was A LOT better than ""I Got The Hook Up"",but it wasn't as funny as I thought it would be. He uses the same two cuss words every sentence. One is the ""F"" word,and the other is the ""N"" word. It is okay for a black comedian to say the ""N"" word in front of a predominantly black audience,but it gets old FAST.The best part is when he plays piano. When he first went on stage,I wondered ""Why is there a piano there""?Even though this isn't as good as I thought it would be,it is much better than either Jamie Foxx DVD!",1068940800,,652,4.141732283464567
1483704,3,B00005JMAS,"Funny in places. My favourite part as far as laughs were concerned was Eddie's brilliant impersonations of celebrities at the very end of the show. Was aiight, some cute recollections about his family and growing up. Very brave to have his family featured and show a glimpse of the real interactions and relationships within his family. However I was left feeling this performance lacked a coherent theme. He had some real potential for an even better/funnier, possibly meaningful show following the theme of his family and their quirks.",1068681600,,537,5.113636363636363
1483705,3,B00005JMAS,Eddie's Family stole the show basically. Eddie got stuck on some words far to long for me&the Documentary dragged a bit but Eddie had some cool moments.the take on Sammy Davis Jr&Bill Cosby were funny. He didn't bring it this time on Michael Jackson like He has in the past. Hit&Miss overall but the Family element section of the Routine Hit home.,1068249600,,347,4.612903225806452
1483706,4,B00005JMAS,"This was hysterical.  I was in tears.  The jokes were funny and his family is a hoot. The only warning is that it is pretty vulgar, so if you're easily offended don't get it.  I'm surprised it wasn't rated X!  But I plan to watch it again or at least buy it! I highly recommend it.  Much funnier than Jamie Foxx's DVD!",1063929600,,318,4.064516129032258
1483707,3,B00005JMAS,"""DysFunKtional Family"" is a stand-up comedy film with a documentary twist.  Most of the film is footage from Eddie Griffin's live onstage appearance in his hometown of Kansas City, Missouri. In his hour-and-half-long performance, Eddie Griffin cracks jokes about race relations, household pets, women, men, and a whole lot of sex. But his commentary on his family is arguably the comic's funniest material. Interspersed with jokes about Griffin's Uncle Curtis who wants to be a porn star and has a video collection to prove it, his Uncle Buckey, an ex-con and ex-junkie, and Griffin's overbearing but loving mother are snippets of interviews with the family members themselves. -Proof that Griffin is not exaggerating when he describes his dysfunctional and farcical family. Those are ""DysFunKtional Family""'s good qualities. In truth, I found Eddie Griffin's family to be funnier than Eddie Griffin. Most of Griffin's performance struck me as someone acting as if he is funny as opposed to actually being funny. That may go far with a live audience that is caught up in the moment, but it falls flat for viewers watching the movie at home. And Griffin uses two particular words a few times per sentence in his stand-up routine. One word is a racial slur; and the other is a four-syllable vulgarity. Griffin claims that using inflammatory language repeatedly robs it of its meaning. Using this sort of language casually might do that, but hearing these two words several hundred times like a broken record within the space of 90 minutes is trying, boring, and gives the impression that Eddie Griffin is unable to get the audience's attention with his humor alone. Fans of Eddie Griffin obviously like his style. If you're a fan, you might appreciate ""DysFunKtional Family""'s concert material more than I did, and you will likely enjoy the additional footage of Griffin's family. If you're not already a fan of Eddie Griffin's, this movie is unlikely to convert you or even entertain you.",1063324800,3,1987,5.057926829268292

1483920,4,B00005JMAS,"Another very funny preformance of Eddie Griffin featuring all new material and inculde family members sharing stories of Eddie when he was younger.  He still brings it hard and I have to agree with another reviewer that the sexual material in the comedy show was a bit much, but still funny as hell.  The two parts that I had the most fun with was the religious material in the comedy show, and when he did fellow black comedians doing something else instead of becoming very funny comedians.  The whole show is roughly 90 minutes and you will laugh so hard I cry in mutiple parts of the show.

I know everyone has their own opinion and this is mine.  Would Iwatch this again never!!! However the man is really funny.,1389830400,,368,4.2
1484021,5,B00005JMAS,"Many have spoke out of the excessive use of the dreaded ""N"". Frankly, I would rather listen to the word N 100 times. than explicit sex jokes.

This was my first look at Eddie Griffin, and I was surprised at how hilarious he can be. Here, as inbetween the concert snippets, he has taken the viewers back home where he visits and interviews family and his old school where the dream started.

This guy has an ability to reenact scenes with family with such clarity; he is loud, boistrous, animated, and hysterical.  Watch, as he reenacts how his uncle shoots up heroine.  And, listen, how truly hilarious he describes the ""discipline"" his mother gave.  He can impersonate celebrities, in a different light.  . Griffin's act is with non-stop humor as he takes over the stage.

Yes, we get to know several family members. But please, you can do without Porn Uncle and his album of explicit images and his porn collection.  Some family members are in the audience. But, don't embarrass your mama, please. Some of that explicit sex talk can be eliminated. If anything while your mama is in the audience, blushing.

Yes, I believe there are 100 uses of that dreaded ""N""  word which no one, absolutely no one,  is allowed to say, but African Americans.  Again, that word has been so ingrained in certain comic acts, it is beginning to sound like ""bambi"".   Rizzo",1384992000,,1354,4.658227848101266

I enjoy watching stand-up comedians, and have seen many, many, many talented comedians.  Since ""laughter is the best medicine"", this specific show by Eddie Griffin is as good as adding 20+ years to your life.  I have never laughed so hard, and was in actual pain (stitches in my sides), tears streaming, throat sore, carpet abused from my rolling repeatedly on it.  Hahaha!
OK, now...just a warning, for those who do NOT like vulgar language:  I don't think there are even 10 sentences that didn't have the F-word, etc.  However, as I don't normally care for vulgar language, in this case, it was his genuine, sincere and appropriate use of it that lifted the show from very funny to totally hysterical!
Eddie Griffen, in Dysfunktional Family, hits the nail on the head about the pains so many of us experienced growing up in the 70's and 80's, and beyond, and makes you suddenly feel so FREE and LIGHT, as you laugh away, easily relating, to his exceptionally talented tales of his own personal, humble upbringing.
Hope you try it, and enjoy it as much as I did.",1327708800,,1220,5.333333333333333

I curse like a sailor but I am a Junior at UC-Berkeley, one of the most prestigious universities on this planet. Its just comedy, I find it freakin' hilarious because alot of the things he said were true. Some of the things he said, many would agree on but would be too afraid to say it themselves.

1484057,4,B00005JMAS,"Eddie Griffin's DysFunktional Family is a pretty funny movie if you like urban comedy. Griffin touches on everything from sex & 9/11 to religion and family.

I'm sorry to say, but people should know what they are getting into.  It's not exactly uncommon for profanity or other ""offensive"" content to be thrown around in a stand up comedy.  If you want something that's not so controversial, stick with the PG stuff.  We all need to ease up on the sensitivity issue and lighten up, esp when you're watching a stand up...",1185235200,,471,4.4941176470588236
1484059,4,B00005JMAS,"This is a pretty good DVD. One has to hand it to Eddie for revealing such dysfunctional family behaviour that would usually be kept secret. He has really aired the dirty laundry on this show. The good thng about it is that ALL families have a degree of dysfunctionality about them.

There are several sidesplitting jokes to be enjoyed by all. The jokes are indeed quite funny, but I have to say that I have heard very similar jokes told by Richard Pryor. In fact, the similarities extend into Eddie's physical humour. Perhaps it evidence of Pryor's influence on comedians that came after him that there should be such striking similarities.

As is customary with Griffin performances, it's all about the jokes. There is precious little socio-plitical commentary. that is okay though, because the jokes are good enough to keep you interested. I for one, prefer to watch satirists and socio-political commentators of high calibre (eg Chris Rock, Dave Chappelle and Michael Colyar). Eddie is the funniest guy I know who does little commentary.

I would strictly rate this dvd at 70%, but our 5 star rating system does not permit. Worth watching",1159660800,,1141,4.901554404145077
1484060,5,B00005JMAS,eddie giffin is by far the best stand up comedian ever.who cares if he cusses and uses the n word. he makes up with jokes and how he talks about his real life growing up. it was inspiring and hilarious. i highly reccomend this movie/documentary/stand up comedy.,1139443200,,261,4.574468085106383
1484061,5,B00005JMAS,"I don't know why there's so many bad reviews about this dvd. Eddie Griffin is a great comedian and incorporated parts of his life to better tell his story. He did use the ""N"" word excessively but so what? Rappers do it all the time to express themselves but everyone is complaining about him using the word for some reason. I think his standup routine comes in close second to Dave Chapelle's ""Killin Em Softly"".",1118102400,6,412,4.506666666666667

In Dysfunctional Family I have to salute Eddie Griffen because I truly did doubt his capability to perform a descent stand up let alone a great one but he sure pulled it off. In Dysfunctional Family Eddie basically talks about his life and obviously his hard and good times with his Dysfunktional Family. I was surprised how he even made jokes about the really hard times with his family and made them hilarious like having to live with his uncle for a bit and watching him do drugs, or when he first met his father when he was a teen. Some of these stories are outrageous but you believe them because his family is there the whole time talking and laughing about the stories. Eddie Griffen surely does have a unique and Dysfunktional Family and I'm glad he shared their stories. This is a great stand up every time I see this I'm laughing for the next few days trying to get theese jokes out of my system.",1117584000,8,1116,4.319047619047619
1484063,5,B00005JMAS,"Other people rating this seem to downgrade it based on cussing. I don't have a problem with cussing - this is in the tradition of Richard Pryor, Eddie Murphy, and others - and it ranks up there with them. If you expect something else, that's your bad. This is some of the funniest stand-up I have ever seen, he had me crying. The man is hilarious, and needs to put out more of this type of off-the-chain material, instead of being all bottled-up on Malcolm and Eddie and Baby Daddy and stuff like that. I feel like this is the REAL Eddie Griffin.

Also, this is called a documentary of him returning home, but that's inaccurate, it's a stand-up show with cuts of his family and hometown interspersed.",1111968000,12,700,4.46875
1484064,4,B00005JMAS,"I absolutely loved his imitation of his white grandpa.  I hear old folks talk like that, black and white.  He does say the n-word a lot, but I think he's saying that moreso to refer to his buddies or just as an interjection.  Granted, if a white guy said that onstage, we'd never hear the end of it in the press.

His family was pretty interesting as well...made it be known that Eddie got his start by hard work and being creative rather than some follower brother who just sits around listening to Tupac and gets his start without having pie-in-the-sky overboard dreams like so many other black stars who get one hit and try to live like Bill Gates.  Yeah, his Uncle Bucky is funny but he's probably as trustworthy as a stray dog around a table full of McDonald's quarter pounders.  His Uncle Curtis is hilarious (I sure do love hairy p***y) - Amen, no doubt! - with his porno dreams and his mother seems like your average loving Midwestern hardworking woman.

Eddie's show is some smal tidbits from his Voodoo Child days, but it does the job of being funny by itself.

The audience track is WAY too loud though, sometimes muffling up what Griffin is saying.",1105401600,,1160,4.4904761904761905
