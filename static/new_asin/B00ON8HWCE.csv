8684341,4,B00ON8HWCE,"This is an exceptionally good DVD of an excellent ballet class. The exercises are equally good for a class with or without pointe shoes. It is full length and includes the teacher's demonstration of the exercise as well as work by the dancer on both legs. My only criticism and the reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the fact that he used a very experienced professional..an Etoile..as his demonstrator. I believe he chose her because of her exceptional feet hoping they would be an inspiration and motivator for dancers to work harder with their  pointe work at the barre to gain strength, confidence and ability in their  pointe work. She is certainly a good example. Nevertheless, having been a performer for so long she took many liberties with strict academic style for an effect she has successfully developed over the years. It was pretty to look at and at times impressive but was academically incorrect. Specifically her port de  bras was all over the place, her fifth was often open,not clean to be able to balance on her overly arched feet..or possibly to emphasise them even more......she 'placed' her foot rather than used the floor for a proper tendu...he even repeatedly tells her to brush/use the floor,close her heels,look into her arm(elbow) for the balancs and so on but she just continues to do her own thing as a performer. Thank God he  demonstrated everything academically correctly, even if at times he was only marking. I think this is a pity because this DVD is essentially a very valuable educational tool which belongs in every dancer's and teacher's library  as it gives the inexperienced viewer the wrong impression regarding overall academically correct execution. They will then  try to  emulate her rather than him, since she's the demonstrator, and will in fact ruin or confuse their technique. Pity in an otherwise excellent DVD which, by the way, also includes instructive interviews with the dancer, Andrey Klemm and the Directrice of the Paris Opera.",1429315200,,1988,4.934131736526946
