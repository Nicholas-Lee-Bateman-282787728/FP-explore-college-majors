8358522,5,B0029XMXBK,"More famous for his trilogy of growing up in Scotland Bill Douglas was an undoubted socialist. Here he sets out to tell the tale of the Tolpuddle Martyrs. They were a group of farm workers and labourers in the nineteenth century who decided to do something about the unfair working conditions and wages that were being forced on them by unscrupulous and over privileged land owners. So they formed one of the first ever trade unions.

Whilst this was not a crime in itself, it did not stop the authorities from stitching them up and having them `transported' for seven years to Australia to face all the privations of convict status in the burgeoning colony.

The story is told through the lens of a lanternist and there are many references to the forms of entertainment of the time. The actors are also very noteworthy, Keith Allen, Philip Davies, James Fox, Vanessa Redgrave, Imelda Staunton and Barbara Windsor to name but a few. A special mention to Alex Norton who played over ten roles including the aforementioned lanternist and I never spotted it.

This is a beautifully filmed piece of cinema with fantastic attention to period detail filmed at Cerne Abbas in Dorset. There is real filth and detritus and the grime on the convicts always looks genuine. It is long at 176 minutes (my version - the BFI restoration) but is a great chronicle of a vital piece of our history and also a unique piece of cinema - absolutely essential viewing.",1424908800,,1445,4.726190476190476

How great that it is now available in DVD format.  I only feel sorry for the previous reviewer having failed to be able to watch it: sort out your equipment!
Comrades is very different to the Douglas trilogy but, in its own way is as fine.  The contrasts between the two halves of the film, set in England and Australia, are superbly done. The muted light of Dorset contrasts with the harsh light of the Australian penal colony and the wide expanses of virgin land.
Linking the film together is the figure of the projectionist, who takes on different aspects of the history of the moving images.  At times his exploits are anachronistic and at times whimsical but he provides a unifying thread.
The actors playing the parts of the Tolpuddle martyrs, trades-unionists who were prosecuted and exiled for the temerity of resisting a reduction of their pitifully small wages, are superb.  The figure of George Loveless is one that stays in the mind long after the finer details have gone. He stands for the heroic nature of the exploited worker.",1266105600,6,1171,4.715686274509804
