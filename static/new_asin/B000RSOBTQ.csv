8278599,5,B000RSOBTQ,"TITUS is an horrific William Shakespeare play that transcends the description ""tragedy.""

In two and a half hours, we see in this stylish Julie Taymor film: a father kill his son, two boys murder their stepdad after they rape a girl and leave her alive but horrendously mutilated, also the beheading of two of the main character's sons and him consenting to the lopping off of his left hand.

There's striking scenes of hallucinogenic quality, also a peek into an empiric bath hall of enormous proportions with a human level of decadence that exceeds its dimensions. Several more murders occur, none more shocking than the last four and before the curtain comes down, the unwitting are turned into cannibals. You have NEVER, EVER seen anything like this linguistically literal adaptation of ""Titus Andronicus"" that's set in a nightmarish WWII-era Roman state.

Highest possible recommendation.
