1172484,5,9089700188,If you are looking for the ACE of ambient art Tony Helsloot is the only one! He is far superior to any other on the market today! Once you purchase any of his DVD's you will agree I'm sure. I have bought several of his DVD's and hopefully have all of his collection.,1307404800,2,266,4.037735849056604
1172485,5,9089700188,"I really enjoyed Blue Seas and nearly all the videos that I received from Isis. They are perfect for relaxing.  I normally watch the videos before bedtime, they help me to relax. I especially enjoy the videos that have natural sound, I feel as if I am really there.  The quality of their video is very beautiful, clear and sharp. The ones I did not enjoy so much was the ones where they added birds and music, however, their videos where very beautiful. They have an excellent video called ""Rain"" which I enjoy, however, I wish they could have one with thunderstorms in the mountains or the forest. I would also like to see videos with that are purely from UK and Ireland, the scenery in those places are beautiful. Also having a video showing the night sky with the moon,stars and if possible other planets of our solar system. I realize that is a lot to ask, but there is no harm in asking.",1306713600,24,892,4.4

Because we cannot get to the ocean, I thought this would be enjoyable for him; and I was correct.",1457222400,4,279,4.56

1172502,5,9089700188,"This DVD is perfect after a stressful day. Many different shots of seas are shown here. Particularly the associated wave noise create a very relaxing atmosphere. I liked the shots of water in the reflection of the sun best. The vibrant colors support this. You often have the feeling of sitting on the beach or on a rock and looking at the blue sea. Also, there are settings where clear water lapped on the shore stones which acts very soothing. A very nice DVD that I 'm going to watch very often.",1447545600,,498,4.423913043478261

1172504,5,9089700188,"I have several in his series.  This is one of my favorites and my husband's too.  I didn't want a tropical beach dvd with sandy white beaches.  This dvd was just what I was looking for.  This dvd shows rocks and beaches with waves gently rolling in.  The beaches look a little more rugged and remote.  Somewhere you would love to spend some alone time.  Beautiful sunsets and colors.  Great nature sounds!  So very, very relaxing.  Love this one!",1445817600,7,446,4.531645569620253

1172542,4,9089700188,I received the product quickly.  I am using it in a dental office in an operatory to give my patients something nice to look at while they are being treated.  I ordered the Nature and Ocean DVDs.  I am really happy with the Ocean DVD.  I have yet to get through all of the scenes since I switch my DVDs frequently but so far I like it and the picture is clear.  The Nature DVD seems to be a little outdated or it just looks like some scenes just don't look as clear as others.,1421712000,7,476,3.968421052631579

1172548,5,9089700188,The ISIS ocean videos are all excellent - I have bought them all but this is my favourite. If you cannot get down to the beach this is the next best thing with a range of different seascapes in different lights. and all excellent quality sound and visuals. If you want to try a relaxing Ocean video this one will not disappoint.,1399852800,3,328,4.306451612903226

1172566,5,9089700188,I love this DVD.  It is relaxing and does not have squawking seagulls. Others I have seen were nice but the squawking seagulls ruined it.,1355788800,2,137,4.48

you will find anywhere on earth. I thought the ""Clouds""
one the most beautiful I had ever seen but now I just
purchased, ""Blue Seas"" and it also takes my breath away.
If you have trouble sleeping at night or not, you can
listen to the ocean as you go into slumberland and wake up
and go right back into a dream world. I also got ""Lotus
Pond"" which is so great for meditation. I think you could
look the world over and never find  as many lovely
scenes as those in The Ambient Collection. They are also
very reasonably priced.",1336780800,11,584,4.261261261261262

I tried watching anyway, and was completely disappointed.  The images aren't clear, the sound of the waves do not match what's on screen, it's painfully obvious that prerecorded sounds were added.  Ridiculous, at best.  I'm returning ASAP.

Try ""Best Hawaii Beaches 1/Waves Relaxation Nature"" DVD's instead.  A much better quality line of products that showcase some gorgeous scenes with real LIVE wave sounds.",1499212800,7,536,5.162790697674419
