8151267,3,B000JJSJ8C,"I bought the digital comic ""Terminator: Hunters And Killers"" last week. I have been a big fan of the movies and the comics. In fact,I've read the comic this was based on. It was  really good story. A new model Terminator that is closer to human. The bridge between the T-800, and the liquid metal T-1000. It was still a good story, but the voice acting could have been better. Especially the Terminators in H.A.K. ""The Other Sarah Conner"" Story was good too. A fourth Sarah Conner and a female Terminator in 1984. But the last story.....""Showdown In Death Valley"" I could have lived without. I'd rather have seen ""The Burning Earth"" in the collection.  Worse....They didn't show how it ended. It only showed part 1. But all-in-all......it is worth the time to see.",1437004800,,764,4.6940298507462686
8151268,1,B000JJSJ8C,"I am a big fan of the Terminator movies and television series.  I am a fan of many animated movies.  When I saw The Terminator: Hunters and Killers, I was excited to see new material in the Terminator universe, and I thought this could be the best of both worlds.

I was wrong.

I may have missed the mention of ""digital comic,"" or perhaps it was not there at the time I ordered it.  Regardless, I thought I was getting an animated movie - to be clear, that is NOT what this is.

This is essentially a comic book that someone reads to you.

The art is still, not animated in any fashion.  In my opinion, the art is mediocre, and its mediocrity is only exceeded by that of the voice talent.  To say that I was underwhelmed would be an understatement.  My primary feeling after viewing this video was wishing that I could have the preceding hour and a half of my life back.

If you are considering purchasing this DVD, be aware of what you are getting.  As Sarah Connor would say, ""The future is not set"" - you still have time to avoid wasting both your time and money on this dvd.",1254268800,4,1079,4.209756097560976

8151271,5,B000JJSJ8C,"I'm  big fan of these comic DVDs. They take the actual comic book images/stories and create anime-style movies that you can sit back and watch on your television. Amazon also has these for the Micronauts and for Marvel superheroes such as X-Men, Hulk, and Daredevil among others which I recommend anyone should check out. These DVD are inexpensive, high quality, and can even be a reading tool since the dialog/narration text remains on the screen as it is spoken just like the look of a comic book.",1125792000,23,499,4.735632183908046
