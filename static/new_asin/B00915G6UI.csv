5231855,3,B00915G6UI,Story lines are far fetched and clearly the writers don't know where to take the series anymore.  Time to retire it.,1353715200,3,116,4.523809523809524

5231881,5,B00915G6UI,"I am a HUGE fan of the original series and also liked the reboot. This season focused on more real life drama between the cast and things we go through in life. I will say, this is their worst season (as in writing) and had a feeling it would be canceled after season five as they all signed 5 year contracts. The ending of the series is almost satisfactory. The Silver storyline lingers and does not finish; however, other stories work out in fans favors.

If you have collected the first four, you may a well see how the series ends!
Enjoy, Luke.",1427932800,,548,4.320388349514563

5231884,3,B00915G6UI,"I only watched season 2012 on 90210.  It was good.  My daughter has tried to keep up on it.  The series is good, and had a lot of good actors.  I am keeping track of some actors on that show.  So I give it a 3 for that.  I would have to see the rest of the series to judge more.  I do not mind writing reviews  if it is on the series I watched.  I was keeping track and try to follow Wes Browns career.",1420156800,,402,3.5813953488372094

5231911,5,B00915G6UI,"I enjoyed this show right up until its last season.  With ""reality tv"" dominating the tube...it was nice having something else entertaining to watch.

5231931,3,B00915G6UI,More of the same. Just ordered this because we missed it when it first aired and didn't gave it recorded on DVR. This show gas definitely started to jump the shark at this point. Story lines are starting to seem drawn out and/or repetitive.,1384041600,,240,4.4772727272727275

5231950,4,B00915G6UI,"Is not a perfect show but teens seem to get very involve with it, since it present some of the drama or situations that they experience in one way or another.",1376006400,,158,4.129032258064516
5231951,5,B00915G6UI,This show is great! So addicting but not as good as the original 90210. I Still love this show it is a good drama for sure!,1374105600,,123,3.769230769230769
5231952,5,B00915G6UI,"I will miss 90210 so much! It was my favorite teen drama since it began in 2008 and until May of this year. This show was so dramatic, filled with sex and twists that I'll never forget. The cast worked so great together for five years, and I will miss looking forward every week for a new 90210 episode, but it was a great season overall. Obviously, this season doesn't feel like a final season, because the show was cancelled right before the season finale (now series finale) was supposed to be filmed, so if you haven't seen the last episode, don't expect anything big or fancy, but at least the writers found a way to give everybody a closure. The CW did a really bad decision, they will never find anything like 90210 ever.

This season gets closer to the characters' feelings, with Dixon's car accident, Silver trying to have a baby before gettng diagnosed with breast cancer, Naomi breaking up with Max (they were end game! I suffered when they split up), Annie's new writing career (writing about her escort days from season 4), Adrianna dealing with her fame and her dark side (AGAIN); so this show always managed to let the audience see the characters' feelings with a little bit of craziness, but that's what it made it so interesting and addicting, right?

I'm planing on watching the complete series again when I get this set! I still feel like I'm not ready to let it go, so it's great to have the seasons on DVD forever. Goodbye 90210! You were amazing!",1373500800,10,1468,4.535849056603774
5231953,5,B00915G6UI,It's an awesome show just sad that there will not be season 6 truly worth my money and time the cast is awesome as well,1373414400,,119,3.8

5231957,5,B00915G6UI,"Loved the last and final season...wish they would have gone into more detail of how everyone is going to go on, but that probably would have taken another season!

5231998,3,B00915G6UI,they didn't share the spot light  basicly they stayed on niaomi life and troubles all the time everything was about her they could have added more celebritys to make the show more entertaining bring back some of the old love intrest they had with former cast members instead of keeping the love intrest only among the now cast members,1368835200,,334,4.661016949152542

5232001,5,B00915G6UI,"In my opinion, the first 2 seasons were the very best, but I'm still completely addicted to this show. Although I liked other seasons better, season 5 has definitely been great and has certainly managed to keep me on the edge of my seat, being why I could give it no less than 5 stars.
