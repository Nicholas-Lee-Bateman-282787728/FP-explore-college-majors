2941468,5,B000VHY8DW,"I really enjoy this video. I bought it for a General Psychology class. It not only includes footage from the original Milgram's experiment, it re-administers the experiment in modern day. It also includes footage from the Zimbardo prison study, as well as discussing the Abu Ghraib incident. It seems to keep the students interested. It is approx 40 min long, which is perfect to show during class.",1271203200,7,398,4.955223880597015
2941469,5,B000VHY8DW,The video was very informative it covered a modern version of the Milgram Experiment and also touched on the Stanford prison experiment of 1971. This video was perfect for my Social Psych class it covered most of Chapter 6 for me... Plus the students commented on how they found the video very interesting... Kept their interest .. very important,1220832000,7,346,4.88135593220339
2941470,5,B000VHY8DW,"I am a psychology teacher and have found that this program is very effective in introducing social psychology to my students.  It is well made and is approachable enough for the students to follow along.

I especially appreciated the additional case studies and experiments (such as Zimbardo's prison experiment) that the special addressed in detail.",1199404800,19,350,5.345454545454546
2941471,5,B000VHY8DW,"I'm a psychology professor and this DVD is a great addition to my class.  Not only does it discuss the Milgram experiment (and re-create it), but it discusses the Zimbardo prison study (complete with video excerpts from the original experiment).  It also discusses the Abu Graib prison situation in comparison to Zimbardo's study and has a brief interview with Zimbardo.

Another interesting fact is that the re-creation of Milgram's study differentiates between male and female subjects.  It also interviews subjects afterward and questions them about their behavior.  Truly great for an hour video and for the price.

Also explanatory enough to be fascinating for a ""layperson"" - my husband loved it!",1198454400,26,702,5.2792792792792795
2941472,5,B000VHY8DW,As a psychology professor I found this video to be an excellent way to start a conversation on the concept of obedience. Milgram's work sheds such light on human behavior that to be able to rerun parts to the experiment for the show was great. Most students think we have changed since Milgram's time and the video shows we really have not. The other stories on Zimbaro's work and a current news story add to the discussions. I highly recommend it.,1198195200,35,448,4.54320987654321
8218643,1,B000VHY8DW,The DVD didn't work. I think I was scammed.,1505260800,,43,3.888888888888889
8218644,5,B000VHY8DW,"This engaging study of both the Milgram Experiment and the Stanford Prison Experiment does a great job of examining the ramifications of these landmark psychological experiments.  It puts them into context, and challenges the viewer to speculate what he/she would have done as a subject of these studies.  Great for people interested in psychology.",1487635200,,348,5.425925925925926

8218647,5,B000VHY8DW,"This special is quite good for high school students. I don't think it would work at a higher level as it leans a bit toward being a tad dramatic here and there. However it is/was very good for my high school students. We watch this after we have discussed the Stanley Milgram, Solomon Asch and Philip Zimbardo Experiments. It provides a visual for the students of Milgram's experiment. It is pretty fascinating that when they redid that experiment in 2006 (I believe) they found that they got almost exactly the same results. That really creeps out my students. I love that. It makes them remember. Philip Zimbardo makes a cameo (which is cool). They also bring in the Abu Ghraib prison incident and an incident that happened at a McDonalds which is also about compliance to authority. I would recommend this video to any high school sociology or psychology teacher.",1413244800,,866,4.78
8218648,5,B000VHY8DW,"I use this video in my high school English classes when I teach 1984. It is a great overview of the psychological experiments I was already using as a basis for my students to understand human nature and power, but it keeps their attention more effectively than I was able to. They are also drawn in by the visual material, as they can see the people partaking in the experiment and hear the ""yells"" of the test taker. Very well done and clear.",1383696000,,444,4.36144578313253
8218649,3,B000VHY8DW,"Although the video is well done and great for psychology, ethics, research methods or sociology classes, a significant downfall of this product is the lack of closed captioning. The result is that certain interested parties cannot purchase this and use in many class rooms maybe a violation of the American with Disabilities Act and some schools' policies. Keep this in mind before purchasing this video.",1383696000,2,404,5.230769230769231
8218650,4,B000VHY8DW,"very good for use in my psych class, however there was not a great deal of explanation - it is more of a rerun of the show - still a good one!",1380844800,,142,3.46875
8218651,5,B000VHY8DW,"There are many psychological obstacles to doing the right thing.  This report does a nice job of covering ""obedience to authority"" and ""the power of the situation.""  But, the most interesting aspect of this story is the you will watch it, and like everyone else you will still say that you ""would never do anything like that.""  But, sorry, you would.",1373414400,,350,4.704918032786885
8218652,5,B000VHY8DW,"Philosopher Edmund Burke once said, ""All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing."" This ABC Primetime telecast emphatically illustrates that point.

I first saw the original Milgram experiment in an educational psychology class when I was a college student in the mid-seventies. While this recreation is not as extreme (the ""shocks"" only go up to 150, the original went to 450), the results are still as conclusive:  people are capable of doing unspeakable things so long as someone in a position of authority tells them to.

I show this film (the first fifteen minutes anyway) to my students during our reading of ""Adventures of Huckleberry Finn."" It leads to an interesting discussion of why some people/groups do the things they do. What role did political leaders, church leaders have in the acceptance of slavery? I even use the study's findings to explore why the lynching of Colonel Sherburn failed. I bring this video up again when we read Orwell's ""Animal Farm.""  [Note: I choose not to use the McDonald's or the Abu Ghraib scenes in the classroom because of some of the graphic (albeit censored) footage.]

Original broadcast date:  Jan. 3, 2007; running time:  34:36  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",1330041600,3,1227,4.980392156862745
