8592198,5,B00DDNMQJO,"Wonderful set.  All films have English subtitles (For the hearing impaired), French and Spanish, too if needed.  I didn't see it stated anywhere on the site or box.  My 88 year old mother needs the subtitles.  Films are B & W except ""Hans Christian Anderson"" and ""Guys and Dolls"" which are in color.  Films are also ""Full Screen"" except ""Guys and Dolls"" and I'm not sure of the aspect ratio on it because it almost fills my analog TV screen but not quit.  I really like that each movie is on a disc by itself and all but two films even have bonus extras.  I received so much more for the price of the set then I expected.",1435536000,17,621,4.211864406779661
8592199,5,B00DDNMQJO,"The 6 films are:  The Bishop's Wife,  The Best Years Of Our LIfe,  The Pride Of The Yankees,  Wuthering Heights (L. Olivier, Merle Oberon),  Hans Christian Anderson,  Guys And Dolls.  A great selection but no extras known.",1371513600,9,222,4.837837837837838
