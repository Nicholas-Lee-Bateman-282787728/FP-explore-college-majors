7913735,5,B00000JSJO,"I love the City Hunter collection and this tale is no different- the City hunter is just too cool and he rights wrongs and handles the bad guys- his never ending quest for a ""good time""- is always funny as his assistance- ""handles him"" which is really funny- and i also love the secondary characters like Falcon- the large mercenary which is a good friend to him---- those two make any fight scene- exciting- so this is well worth every penny---
buy it  you won't regret it",1279238400,,473,4.436781609195402
7913736,5,B00000JSJO,"This one was only 50 minutes, so I expected a story with a paper-thin plot and pretty much no action. Well, it's got the paper-thin plot, but a ton of action that made me forget there's even supposed to be a plot. The cool retro music that played when Falcon fights Gomez is great too. This is also the funniest City Hunter of the first four released here. The end scene with Joe and Falcon is hilarious. The dubbing is fine save for the fake accents and Kaori's annoying voice. Joe's transition from a perverted maniac to a cool, collective assassin in under 2.37 seconds ruins the mood sometimes too. Regardless, it's shoot first, ask questions later in this video. Buy it.",992908800,,675,4.540983606557377
7913737,3,B00000JSJO,"I was hoping the quality of the anime would be a step up from the two previous series and the movie, but alas no.  However visuals aside this particular story is action from the word go.  There's not a lot of time for funny business (but it's there).  Ryo and friends basically stumble into an international incident in Japan, which begs the question of 'how is that sooo convenient?'.  Since there is so much action in such a short amount of time, it leaves you feeling somewhat cheated for story, however it probably only feels so, in the way the anime is conducted, but still, it's not a strong story to make a special anime out of.",979689600,,635,4.401709401709402
7913738,4,B00000JSJO,"The motion pitcure of City Hunter had me laughing for hours, So did this film. Dispite it's average animation the story, characters, and allover hilarious situation will have you busting a gut. In ""City Hunter: Bay  City War"" Joe, a.k.a City Hunter, is stuck on a island that is the  opening site for a grand hotel and amusment park. Yet when terrorist take  over the hotel, obvious rip off of ""Die Hard"", to use a new  computer system to hack into the U.S. defense system to launch a nuclear  war it is up to Joe and his friend Falcon to save the day. Even though it  isn't till near the ending that Joe acts seriously and Falcon ends up doing  most of the work, while trying not to kill Joe. For fans of the City Hunter  series this is a must, considering it's a lot better than ""City  Hunter: 357. Magnum"". This film wil also entertain fans of the action  genre looking for a great escape from reality, since when has anything in  the City Hunter series been even remotely real. Warning this film contains  violence, language and some mature themes. Suggested age for this film is  13 and up.",961200000,,1095,4.415
