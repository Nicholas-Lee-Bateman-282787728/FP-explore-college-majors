I recommend the 10 minute solution series (pilates or target toning) for time constrained individuals (I know I am)

an okay purchase, but likely to end up in a friend's house.",1175731200,9,240,4.690476190476191

2703615,5,B000LC4CHO,"I decided to get back in shape about six weeks ago and you know how difficult it is getting started. This DVD has kept me on track because everytime I consider not working out, I tell myself ""it's only 8 minutes"" and do it. My favorite is the ABS and the stretch because it is something I will usually skip and this DVD has me motiavated. At first it was hard, but do-able. Three levels are displayed, easy, moderate and advanced. I am happy to say I am seeing results and I am able to do some of the advanced level moves. I highly recommend this DVD if you are busy and want to see results.",1145404800,4,591,4.103448275862069
2703616,5,B000LC4CHO,I received the training video and love it. The work out gets your heart going and it don't take all day to do. You don't regret doing it. I look forward to my workout days. Keep up the good work.,1140652800,4,195,3.9
2703617,5,B000LC4CHO,"This workout is formidable for those who don't have a lot of time to work out. It targets all major muscle groups, arms, buns, thighs, abs and it includes a stretching section. Several exercises are performed to target each muscle group, so the workout is never boring. Moreover, the exercises are very simple to follow..One can definitely feel the burn, a sign that the exercises are working.",1137974400,10,393,4.880597014925373
2703618,3,B000LC4CHO,"I just got this DVD and I have to say overall I am a little disappointed. Lets face it, if you are doing an 8 minute video you probably want a simple, easy to use video. You like Easy to do excercise without distractions.  It seems like they tried to work too much into these videos and it leaves them feling cluttered and confusing.

Especially on the leg excercises, if you are anything but a beginner you need a stabilization ball AND ankle weights!  The instructer waists as much as half of her alloted 30 seconds per workout instructing the other two people working with her, it is as if they haven't reviewed or prepared ahead of time.  I find it distracting and frustrating.  There is also time wasted putting on and removing ankle weights as well as getting and removing the ball.  If so much instruction is needed for each excercise it probably shouldn't be in an 8 minute video.

On the up side these videos are very up to date with a modern setting.  They are not nearly as cheesy as the old ones.  The DVD menu makes it very easy to find and use the workout of your choice. The excercises are new and fresh,  I would say they are more difficult in general than the original 8 minute videos.

I have a feeling I will continue to use my old ones more than this new one simply because they are simpler to use and still effective.  ( even if they are a little cheesy)",1136678400,29,1375,4.286821705426356

These aren't taped in a fancy studio with celebrity assistants, but a good workout doesn't need those things.  Some days I do 3 of the 4 on this DVD; some days I'll just use 1 or 2 along with another DVD for variety.

2703796,5,B000LC4CHO,"After the birth of my son, I struggled finding the time to get fit and toned as I did not have a lot of time to do it. I found this and started doing the arms, thighs and buns without weights. After about three months, other people really started to notice and say things about how good I looked.  I then realized it was working and after about five months, I increased to 5lb weights and and 5lb ankle weights.  I now have the program memorized and do it about five times a week and it only takes about half an hour which is feasible during nap time or after bed. My body has completely transformed because of this little gem. I am in the best shape I've been in in years.  It's not super big on cardio but that works for me as I have a heart condition. Buy it, stick to it and you won't be disappointed.  It's tough going at the start but well worth it.",1420588800,3,855,4.041420118343195

My Physical Therapist told me that these are great for the front of the body, but you should also be working the back muscles as well. That will prevent back injuries. so if you all ready have strong back muscles it is good, if not, this may not be for you.",1397347200,,417,4.225
2703921,5,B000LC4CHO,I have purchased so many workout DVDs.  This is the only one that I have made a part of my daily routine.  I love how I can pick which part of my core I am going to target.  The 8 minutes is done before you know it.  I love that they have the time countdown while you are working out.  I started jogging several months ago and that is my main exercise.  I have been using this as a supplement to that and have been concentrating the Abs.  LOVE it!!,1394668800,,448,3.911111111111111

I bought this DVD mainly for the ""core"" part of it and I don't feel it does a good job providing effective ab exercises.  I know it's only 8 minutes, but these exercises just don't cut it.

I just think ""well I'll do one of the sections and that will be better than nothing"". But then I do a section and I feel energized and motivated to do the others. Pretty soon I've done over 30 minutes of very effective strength training! The exercises are excellent for general strength as well as specific toning.  I have used a lot of videos and taken a lot of classes and the exercises on this DVD really are the best of the basics for your whole body.  I sometimes pause the DVD during the arms section and do extra reps because I don't get enough of a workout in the 8 minutes.  And I think it would be good to add in back exercises.  Overall I highly recommend this DVD!",1369958400,,768,4.059602649006623
2703928,2,B000LC4CHO,"I was so surprised and disappointed that this DVD is actually for sale. The workouts would be good, but the recorded sessions are so disorganized and ""fast"" between the different moves.  By the time I have watched her do the particular move and then do it myself, the 30 sec or 45 sec for that move is done and she is demonstrating the next one.

I really wish they would sell the original ""08 Min Abs"" (sold on VHS) as a DVD!!",1368230400,,427,4.195121951219512

2703984,1,B000LC4CHO,"I have a few issues with this DVD - namely:

The lady talks too fast, you can hardly make out what she is saying;

When she's giving instructions, the clock starts and by the time I'm in place, I have 20 secs or less left to work out;

What benefit would I get from it?  ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, and I am not a beginner, I've been working out for years.",1329868800,,348,4.0
2703985,5,B000LC4CHO,"Good work out tape, moves fairly fast so you need to be able to get down on the floor and up from the floor very quickly or you will miss some of the repetitions that are going on on the tape.

2703988,3,B000LC4CHO,I had a VCR tape years ago with the name 8 minute abs that was great.  I purchased this one hoping that it was the same thing and it's a lot tougher.  I am older and it's too much for me.  I think it's too advanced for my age.  It's a good workout if you are younger.,1311033600,,267,3.6315789473684212
2703989,3,B000LC4CHO,"I thought I wrote a review for this earlier, but I guess I didn't. Its not that hard to do and the workout doesn't make you feel sore the next day. I like hard ones that you can really feel as your doing them. I love that its only 8 min long, but just wish it was a bit harder workout.",1309996800,,285,3.6885245901639343
2704032,1,B000LC4CHO,"We were not impressed with these 8 min core workouts at all.  We were actually hoping this would be a great replacement & comparison to a VHS tape we used to use and really liked.  However, this didn't compare at all. The quality of the recording is really bad, the exercises change to frequently to even start to feel a burn, the buns exercises were the same exact ones they use on the thigh workout.  Was not the least bit sore the next day. Didn't even feel like I worked anything. Would not recommend for the money. Going to keep searching for the 8 min Abs with Jamie Brenkus I used to have on VHS.... Ten times better workout & results!",1301270400,5,642,4.289256198347108
2704033,5,B000LC4CHO,"This DVD workout is great. I do the abs, arms and part of the thighs as a warm-up before biking or walking and can definitely see the difference in my abs & chest & arms. It's also hilarious to listen to the host tell Dan that he's repeatedly doing everything wrong in 8-minutes thighs! Straighten that leg, Dan. Put your legs on top of the ball, Dan. We're not doing the curl yet, Dan. Poor guy.
To answer people who say the exercises aren't 8-minutes, there is some pausing between a few exercises where the host is explaining the next move but once you know the routine you'll be able to just go right into the next move without waiting for her to start and thus get your 8-minutes. I do agree with the ones who say getting down to the floor and then back up from the floor in 8-minute arms is tedious; the chest flys really do work though so just get up quickly (without hurting yourself) to maximize your workout time.",1291593600,,923,4.310344827586207

It's by the same outfit, and advertizes it's from the creators of ""the original.""  Well, it may be from the creators.....  but it's a TOTALLY different workout.  :08 Minute Abs used to require no pressure or involvement of knees (mine are bad) and this new routine assumes that you have the knees of a 16-year-old.  Impossible to use.  I went back on line and found another copy of my original VHS tape; don't know if I'll be able to use this DVD at all.",1283212800,3,565,4.194444444444445

I also like the fact that it goes back to a main menu after each workout b/c some days I do not have time to do all of them and it makes it easier to pick & choose what I want to work on each day.  I have now been doing it for only 2 weeks and feel a definite difference.  It's so easy to work this short toning workout into your day. It is also EXTREMELY easy to follow along.  Even the first time, you don't feel like you were trying to figure out the exercise & then they were done with it.  You do not require the ball that some people complained about not knowing.  You can do this w/o it or add it later.  You do require a small set of weights for the arm section.  I definitely recommend this dvd!",1275436800,,876,3.816666666666667

They start the clock while the instructor is explaining the exercise and you don't actually start the set until there's about 15-20 seconds on the clock, which is nothing I guess once you know the workout well, it's okay, but I really disliked that. I loved the original 8 minute abs and thought this new version didn't come close to the original.

I didn't want to build crazy Madonna-like bulk but just to tone and this video is perfect for that! I love that it's got all body parts in one video: Abs, butt, thighs, arms... And if you do them all it's like its own workout. It offers different levels of difficulty and you can incorporate weights or not. This video is definitely worth it for how much it cost.",1243555200,,560,4.242990654205608

2704100,5,B000LC4CHO,I love this work out. You can pick and choose what areas you want to work out. The best part is that they are only 8 minutes. So if your a busy person you can afford 8 minutes out of your day to do them. If you want to could also do them on your lunch breaks.,1240617600,,259,3.56140350877193
2704101,5,B000LC4CHO,I am VERY pleased with the 8 minute Core workouts.  I wish they would make more.  They are just the right amount of time and I mix it in with working out on my Elliptical machine for a well-rounded workout.  Thank you!,1240531200,,218,4.142857142857143
2704161,5,B000LC4CHO,This is a great video even though only eight minutes long.  I would suggest that if you can find a new one on line the better.  I purchased two used tapes that did not work.  I finally found a new one and my abs are looking good!!,1240185600,,230,3.851063829787234
2704162,5,B000LC4CHO,"I have to say I think this is a GREAT workout DVD.  If you are tight on time, like I am, you can still find 8 minutes in your day to work on one thing.  And it is a good workout--it will make you sore!  The first day I did abs and arms--was sore for 2 days.  So then I did thighs.  I thought to myself ""hmmm, that was not as hard as the other two sections"". But I was WRONG:  sore for 2 days in my legs.  That's a good thing!  Other reviews are right about the knees, though--if you have bad knees you won't be able to do a lot of the exercises.  Also, be prepared--you need a lot of equipment handy:  mat, dumbbells, stability ball, even a stable chair.

I got this DVD from a video store, and after 3 late fees I am purchasing one.",1238716800,,733,3.8523489932885906

Now after I had my daughter I was looking to buy the DVDs to get back into shape again; this workout is nothing compared to the original, which was MUCH more intense had you sweating and you could FEEL the burn.  This newer version gave me a workout but not to the point that i could feel the burn and I haven't worked out in 9 months!!

The ab/thigh/bun workout sections are great, and in my opinion the abs workout alone is worth the purchase price.  The arms and stretch sections are not to my liking, but for buns/thighs/abs this is still my #1 favorite exercise DVD.  Please make sure to do some lower back exercises to balance your abs though, even just 50-100 toe touches.  I really threw myself out at first when my abs got strong.",1213488000,,565,4.311320754716981
2704205,4,B000LC4CHO,This is a fine video for short 8 minute workouts.

Firstly it seemes like they were rushing to make the 8min deadline.
The lady was not giving details like when to inhale/exhale which I think is very important and was also missing out on a lot of details(I think she was assuming that we all know all the details).
Very generic routine's and fails to inspire.
Keep looking and I am sure you will find better Dvd's out there. Pass this on.",1209081600,2,455,4.241379310344827

2704209,5,B000LC4CHO,"I bought this DVD about a month ago, with the thought that I should be able to find 8 minutes in each day to work on my core strength.  I now do the Abs workout every morning first thing.  Do I now have a six-pack?  Nope - like everyone else I have a little fat around the middle.  But what I do have is a noticeably stronger core - not only the abs, but all the supporting muscles on the side and back.  The workout offers three levels, and I was able to get to the advanced level fairly quickly.  After only a month, I can now feel rock solid muscles around my entire mid-section.  And this has translated into better posture, a stronger back, a flatter stomach, and a reduced chance of injury during my other activities.  Again - I am only doing the abs section, but I can imagine doing this every morning for the rest of my life.  Highly recommended!",1205539200,14,854,4.190184049079755
2704210,2,B000LC4CHO,"This is an ok DVD for those of us who are time crunched and I like the fact that it incorporates all types of areas in one tape. But it was only difficult for me the first few times I did it. The arms one was the only part that was consistently hard. The rest, in particular the abs, seemed too easy and did not give me the results I would have liked. Plus...it is pretty low quality and often cuts away during the count, throwing you off if you don't have much rhythm :)",1205020800,2,471,3.968421052631579

2704255,1,B000LC4CHO,"I used the Original VHS tape about 7 years ago and it worked wonders. I used it after I had my daughter and it gave me a flat stomach in no time. I've tried, cardio, pilates, yoga everything since I had my son 6 months ago and nothing seem to work. So I wanted to upgrade my ""Original 8 min abs and buns"" VHS to the DVD version and bought this. I tried this and I have to say I am very unhappy with the workouts

I did not feel the abs workout except for 2 routines. The buns and thighs workout was more or less the same. If you have weak knees and back you will not be able to do these effectively because most of the excersises are lunges of some sort and squats. In the Original the exsercises felt better on the knees and I felt that I have had a good workout on my muscles after the 1st 2 or 3 minutes itself. The arms section in this is good (not better but good) on this.

Some find the original cheesy because of the 80 style and the commentary. But I think its better cause the instructor reminds you to keep your posture better and keeps of motivating you (although in cheesy ways) to go through the routine.. In this dvd I was getting bored after the 1st 2 minutes.

Now if you have not used to the original, this would seem great. Since I was looking to replace the original (VHS) version this was a dissapointment to me.",1192060800,,1333,4.06083650190114

I like that you go through the sections so you have a chance to breathe in between as it sits at the main menu waiting for the next selection.  Get some water, catch your breath and move on without having to pause, rewind, etc.  You just click on the next section when you're ready to go.

Wasn't sure what to think of something with ""8 minutes"" as the description, didn't seem like you can get benefit out of that, but when you put the 5 sections together you get a good, 40 minute workout.  And you'll feel it in every part worked!  What's tough is the ""buns"" section really works your legs too and then when you get to the ""thighs"" section, you're working them again.  So they really get a good workout!
