The acting was mostly fine, the direction and writing sometimes brilliant but too often too painfully obvious, similar to that moment in too many movies when we the audience might scream ""no no for god's sakes don't open that door!""

This is a film that went nowhere and said nothing, nothing about the heart, the soul, the human condition, about being alive...pointless empty calories, a sugar doughnut of sound and  fury masquerading as history and signifying...nothing...

4124033,3,B003H8859A,"After finding secret pro-appeasment (for the Nazis) recordings Anne (Garai) becomes involved in a secret, violent conspiracy, set in England in 1939.  After one of her friends who speaks out against Hitler is found dead, Anne begins to dig deeper into the reasons for his death.  This is a very interesting movie.  It is both compelling and slow moving.  It is tense but it drags in spots. It kept me watching but my mind did wander a bit.  This is overall a good movie but you need to be in the mood for it.  You really feel for Anne and the way her life begins to fall apart.  I am a fan of historical movies so I really liked that aspect of it.  This movie had the feel of a made-for-TV movie, although it would have been an HBO movie with the quality of it.  I recommend this but again, it's not for everyone, and you need to be in the mood to watch a movie like this one.  I give it a B-.

Would I watch again? - Probably not",1297987200,12,930,4.082872928176796
4124034,4,B003H8859A,"""Glorious 39,"" set in England in the summer of 1939, tells about Anne Keyes (Romola Garai), an attractive young woman who is enjoying modest success as a film actress.  She is the adopted daughter of Alexander Keyes (Bill Nighy), a career politician and member of Parliament.  Anne still lives in the family home with her father, mother Maud (Jenny Agutter), diplomat brother Ralph, and socialite sister Celia.

One of Alexander's friends stops by for dinner and during a tempestuous conversation expresses his disapproval of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and his efforts to appease Hitler's Nazi regime.  Anne begins to suspect a conspiracy is afoot when she finds a set of phonograph records that document conversations of men discussing state intelligence secrets.  When Anne tries to share her discovery with others, they're soon found dead.

The plot is fascinating and fresh.  It deals with a group of Brits convinced that England could not possibly prevail against Germany and who use every means from political influence to  devious machinations to keep England out of war.  This historical background blends nicely into a suspense thriller when bodies start piling up.  It contains excellent performances and crisp direction by Stephen Poliakoff, who helmed many dramas for the BBC.

4124035,4,B003H8859A,"As someone who is doing a report on the Appeasement Movement in Great Britain, this film does have a lot of historical context. And although in 1939 it never quite comes to ""espionage"" like it does in this movie, it is a clever little thought. The movie does address the fact that throughout the 1930's and after the Great Depression, the British upper class were fearful of the communism from Russia invading their country thereby destroying their lifestyle and they were willing to support anyone who would stop that from happening. Some people don't realize that this is what made appeasement of Hitler possible (for GB) in the first place. Chamberlain could have never made the decision without the support of the upper class. However, it should have been addressed in this movie that this was not a black and white issue at the time. At the time in 1938, there was really no other choice than to appease Hitler. The fact is Britain was absolutely not ready to go to war, nor would they have the support of their country for going to war with a country who merely wanted more land to live in. That is not to say, though, that how the Britain handled the political situation post-appeasement was appropriate. Chamberlain sent Halifax's men over to Germany to try to negotiate peace up until the right before they declared war. Talk about a lost cause.

So, in response to the actual movie: I thought the landscape was beautiful! As were the clothes. I just thought visually, it was stunning. And the acting (for the most part) was decenet. Romola Garai had some pretty intense moments, although her character took an somewhat predictable turn. She did the best with what she was given, to say the least. Also, I loved David Tennant's little blurb about Hitler. But then again, it's David Tennant, c'mon.",1291507200,12,1806,4.733333333333333
4124036,2,B003H8859A,"I expected this to be a historical movie about the British movement to appease Germany just before World War 2, with a murder mystery thrown in. However, its purpose is to be a horror movie--which is why the plot doesn't make sense. Viewers are forced to continually watch a sensitive, beautiful, likeable young woman increasingly betrayed by almost everyone she loves, plus people she barely knows. She's lied to, humiliated, imprisoned, starved, terrorized, and is forced to watch her friends brutally murdered or discover their corpses. If you empathize with her, and it's hard not to, it feels like being psychologically tortured yourself. Why put yourself through this experience? The only things this movie has in its favor are beautiful settings and costumes, and you can see those in plenty of other movies and TV series.",1288569600,18,829,5.102941176470588
4124037,4,B003H8859A,"I must strongly disagree with the first reviewer.

The plot is quite intriguing and the acting mostly quite good. The music is lushly romantic in the manner of Ralph Vuaghan Williams, who was composing his beautiful 5th Symphony, the ""Pastoral""(1938-1943) during the period the movie is set. The film score celebrates the quiet English rural landscape just before England is forced to join the war against Germany.

And this is important: the country ""castle"" and surrounding countryside owned by the wealthy is the incarnation of the elegant lifestyle the appeasement movement so desperately wanted to protect.

So, good actors, appropriate score, great setting/ phtography, and a good plot, even with the far too convenient ""discovery""* concerning Anne near the end.

I was wrong. It is a truly awful film with absolutely nothing to recommend it. The script is wooden and lifeless, the acting as poor as you might expect from such a poor script and the direction so clumsy that any sense of tension that might be built up is very quickly lost.

4124048,2,B003H8859A,"The movie should have been named Glorious 38 and it would have made more sense and could have given a credible explanation for Prime Minister Chamberlains never understood monomania for avoiding a war with Germany. In 1938 when Hitler was preparing to invade Czechoslovakia both Germany and Hitler himself were vulnerable. An attack by France and the United Kingdom would have easily defeated Germany and ended Hitlers dictatorship. His generals knew this was the situation, as did the generals and most state department officials in France and UK. If the two countries had backed Czechoslovakia, Hitler not only wouldnt have attacked but the loss of prestige might have cost him his office. Why Chamberlain didn't seem to understand this has never been explained; and he was the key; France followed his lead. Thus a successful English conspiracy to convince Chamberlain that there would be a war and it would be a long one again if he didn't give away most of Czechoslovakia would have been more credible. That the heroine doesnt succeed in exposing the conspiracy would add punch to a movie set in 1938.

Aside from being set in the wrong year, the movies plot has holes big enough for a panzer division to rumble through. The plot is like molasses at times. Also the motivation for the story given in the introduction and the conclusion is poorly done. It seemed obvious that the family could let the heroine go after her evidence was gone and her mental instability had been established. Why would she want to hear the story from a then child 50 years later?

Didnt Stephen Poliakoff learn from Alfred Hitchcock how to direct a thriller?",1419465600,,1642,4.860714285714286

4124052,5,B003H8859A,"If you are in search of a synopsis, THIS is NOT THAT.  Here's what I can offer & contribute as an American viewer...
 'Glorious 39' develops somewhat slowly. It also may have potential to grow on U if given the chance. I will point towards a couple  (unfortunate)  flaws nagging in this well crafted film. But first...
  *****  STRENGTHS : There are many plenty of positive elements to highlight:
its subject matter, underlying texts, exceptional cast & performances, scenic' locations, mindful Hitchcockian flavors, wonderful costume, AND profound moments in dialogue.

  ~  Yet, there are 2 MORE 'coinciding' reasons that garner an 'Anomalous 5' star rating: ~
First, the performance of Romola Garai throughout.  She is & has deservedly  been widely recognized and acclaimed. No exception here.  (In  all fairness, I try and remain objective but I openly admit; THIS IS my favourite lead billing of my VERY favourite actress.) Nonetheless, her captivating film presence & portrayal is reason enough for one to consider a VISIT or REVISIT of this film & just appreciate it... :)

  As Anne Keyes,  Romola Garai carries the lead role & interprets her character in rhythmic stride. From the privileged world as the eldest (and adopted) daughter  of a British Member of Parliament, she leads us through her psychological downfall. A victim of betrayal & treachery, her journey into a darkness remains in a perfect motion. Even a certain physical wear & tear  is (eventually) displayed in part with subtle body language and 'guttural achings'.

  Second and realizing it takes a team to succeed more so than ever here, the 'confinement' of Anne Keyes is Glorious 39's towering apex in story & presentation. We are presented with correlating sequences & a series of dramatic character scenes. And as an outcome of circumstances during her 'confinement' continues, it climbs even a RUNG HIGHER.

  Take special note of the eye/door crevice scene about halfway through the 'confinement'. You'll soon find Anne engaged in anger, confrontation, desperation, frustration, sadness, helplessness and (possibly) a  private surrender. It is a true struggle delivered in an effortless flow.

  Subsequently, Writer/Director Poliakoff superbly captures Anne's 'LOOK of RESOLVE.' 'THE APEX'.  THE MOMENT when all she's encountered CULMINATES perfectly in her Romola Garai's face.

  With a few minor adjustments in tying in the story line ,Glorious 39 could have ended right there... (sigh...) For those approximate 18 minutes, regardless of any shortcomings elsewhere, it stands as one of my absolute favourite slices of drama on film. In some ways, they just may be...

  ***** WEAKNESSES: Aside from the POSSIBILITY of an acquired taste (what genre of art actually isn't?) or its somewhat slower pace, this film does suffer some drawback on more than one occasion from awkward attempts in believability.  There are spot holes in script and at times its characters come across as over-directed or forced.
  ***** OVERALL:  You can do much worse in experiencing a 2 hour + feature film. You can't do much better than a stellar Romola Garai.....accompanied with the supporting & basis elements around her, on all cylinders and in unison. I find  Glorious 39 as engaging & entertaining as a movie can be. I still & will always luv this movie, any flaws (if @ all !), like NO OTHER. - An Anomalous 5.",1413849600,2,3382,5.117216117216117

The adopted daughter of a British aristocrat stumbles on a murderous plot to keep England out of the second world war, a plot in which her family is deeply involved.  The main portion of the movie details her struggle first to figure out what is going on and then to escape from the web her family is weaving around her to keep her from revealing what she knows.

The movie is beautiful to look at and well acted.  It is quite suspenseful until the last 10 minutes when it all falls apart.  The final scenes of the movie make no sense.

4124058,1,B003H8859A,"Respecting creative artists and their struggles, I rarely take the time to slam a poor artistic product. But I will make an exception. The script of this film should have almost instantly been thrown in the bin. Indeed I have put the DVD in the garbage bin after watching it. It is a not particularly interesting, not at all historically credible reworking of the theme of appeasement in 1939. At times the dialogue put into the mouth of a fantastic actor like Bill Nighy was excruciatingly artificial and he seem to have been directed to say wooden cliches. Even the way the actors walked together was like day one in drama school. So appalling script, poor acting by good actors, and therefore I assume really bad directing. And even the camera work was shoddy. I suppose the pitch for the movie was Remains of the Day meets Downton Abbey meets Appeasement and the result was a disaster that should actually be shown in film school to illustrate how not to script or make a movie. Sorry about that Bill Nighy as I love everything else you have ever been in. But what were you thinking when you read the script and took the male lead?",1402444800,,1135,4.541463414634146

I got quite a surprise after watching this film and did some research to find out that the appeasement policy was indeed very popular and that Churchill was more of a lone, or the loudest or at least well known voice against it.

I thought the film was intriguing and suspenseful and made a very interesting comment on the times. The plot can even be believable set in those times and now knowing as to what lengths governments etc go to to cover up and distort the truth or a dissenting voice - on that point nothing much has changed sadly.

scenery, you will like it for this as well. I thought the film over all was artistically creepy and I enjoyed that very much. But it comes together well enough to make sense in the end, sort of...which is also what I liked.",1357084800,10,684,4.393700787401575

Having just been tortured this weekend with movies that were far worse, I have to say that I frankly enjoyed this thriller of pre-WWII English life. The political climate and thoughts pro and con from aristocrat to the average Englishman varied widely to my surprise. I didn't realize that many of the aristocracy were against the war and had reacted in such violent means in order to avoid war to save their own way of life - no matter what horrors others in Europe were facing at the same time from Hitler. As the movie progressed, I didn't know who to believe or not believe as one by one individuals were killed.  The movie, for me, at least kept up the suspense, though I hate to watch my darling Jeremy Northam play a rather despicable man. Word of warning, if you're an animal lover, stay away. Disturbing images. The slaughter of pets after the declaration of war was frankly appalling.  I found it very difficult to watch, especially when one's lover is found hanging from a hook upside down in a barn with other carcasses waiting to be burned.  In any event, the movie kept my interest and kept me guessing.  In spite of its merits, it's not quite worth a five star rating.",1332633600,3,1260,4.508771929824562

From what I have seen here, some in this group (whole aristocratic families, in fact) were evil to the point of murdering those who disagreed with them. Why was this film not seen widely, and why are there are (at least on the jacket) no reviews whatsoever? Perhaps it is a shameful chapter in British history - ""dirty laundry"" some want buried?  I find it peculiar in light of the fact that the cast is magnificent, the photography gorgeous and the plot line totally absorbing.

The film, with an excellent cast of British actors (including one of the stars of the excellent TV series Downton Abbey) is about a partly true conspiracy to keep Britain out of WW2. People who know about the conspiracy are turning up dead, and only a young British actress seems to have any insight into the events. The problem for me, and I imagine for many viewers, is the murder mystery aspect of the film gives way about half into the film to a psychological / horror-type film. Not quite horror (and quite watchable), but for anyone wanting to know more about the conspiracy, the work of behind-the-scenes British fascists like Oswald Mosley, or just hoping for an old-style murder mystery will be very disappointed. This film could have been much better; the writers just seemed to run out of dialog and ideas.

I could not have been more wrong. What I found was a typically Hitchcockian story of charming, upper-class villainy directed by a man who clearly didn't have a clue as to what he was about and a cast of high-powered actors, all of whom were sleepwalking.

Other reviewers here and on Amazon UK have accurately pointed out the lack of internal consistency and logic. The same charges can equally be laid against Hitchcock's works--but Hitchcock was a master of filmic magic and misdirection. This film's Poliakoff absolutely is not. Hitchcock, in storyboarding this film, would have used more than a few closeups to focus the drama directly on the heroine in what is at bottom a damsel-in-distress plot. Poliakoff, on the other hand, dotes on medium- and long-shots to inundate us in pretty views of candy-box-sweet landscapes. Hitchcock would have realized that the screenplay was full of pointless bloat and cut the running time by a good fifty percent. Poliakoff clearly doesn't appreciate that little problem. And finally, Hitchcock would have provided the film with a real ending rather than the dull thud we get here, which improbably manages to be simutaneously ultra-whispy and a kick in the viewer's teeth.

There is just one reason to See this film: to hone your appreciation of Alfred Hitchcock's art.

4124074,1,B003H8859A,The movie has beautiful scenery and some fine actors. What it is missing is a coherent plot.

Her family - who are all part of the conspiracy - try to teach her a lesson by kidnapping her nephew while she is supposed to be baby sitting and instead falls asleep.

(1.) Scripted to the point that you wait for an actor to say some highly scripted, artificial line then the director says cut and edit then the next actor says their line and the director says cut again and edit. Thus we have no flow, no emotion, no humanness. Just stitched together improbabilities. Also called acting by line memorization - unemotional and unrealistic with poor to no character development.

Extremely unrealistic character behavior in response to situations e.g. Anne is locked in a room and tries breaking out by banging on doors and window shutters with her hands when all she had to do was grab one of the iron lamps and bang away. The supposed suspense of who's the evil bad guys  was too predictable and not very suspenseful - been done many times before.
(3.) Unrealistic, low budget, scenes like recently mown vast rolling fields with not a stitch of machinery or a single farm hand to be seen. Scenes taking place that are bizarre and unrealistic with no explanation e.g. people dying; military road blocks in the middle of nowhere.
(4.) And, always a sign of a cheap not-well-thought-out production is a heavy reliance on borrowing props from some museum to create a cheap quicky period atmosphere. The give away is that the clothing is always impeccable; cars, homes  and furniture are 100% dust free - all the time.

4124078,4,B003H8859A,"Though there have been books and other films that deal with the dissidence between the aristocrats and the general populace of England around the topic of WW II, this beautifully executed 'historical thriller' brings many aspects of those discrepancies of opinion to light in a manner not unlike the similar thought processes in Germany at the same time: the gentry of Germany turned a blind eye to the events surrounding them (The Final Solution) in order to believe in what they chose to believe as a promise for stabilization and world importance as a genteel country.  Writer/Director Stephen Poliakoff has based his examination of this problem on focusing on the life of one particular character whose fate was the standard of the dispossessed.

The year is 1939 and the aristocratic family of Sir Alexander Keyes (Bill Nighy) and his wife Maud (Jenny Agutter) are living what seems to be an idyllic life with their children Ralph (Eddie Redmayne), Celia (Juno Temple) and the eldest, Anne (Romula Garai) who we soon discover was adopted before the Keyes discovered they could bear children on their own.  Anne is a beautiful creative actress who seems to make the family proud.  The family is visited by an old friend Hector (David Tennant) who at dinner is very vocal about the fact that Hitler is a threat to England and that England must stop Hitler before he destroys them instead of pursuing a course of appeasement of Hitler that would prevent disturbance of their elegant way of life on the island of Britain.  It is obvious that Sir Alexander is more concerned with his duties as a member of parliament and his maintenance of his family history and wealth, and his responses to Hector as well as to the mysterious Balcombe (Jeremy Northam) from the Foreign Office and the young Lawrence (Charlie Cox), a new member of the Foreign Office who is courting Anne, suggest subterfuge.

The family is visited by the very proper Aunt Elizabeth (Julie Christie) and while the entire family is on picnic, an infant transiently disappears while under Anne's care.  From this point the story takes a dark turn: Anne continues filming in London with her close friend, actor Gilbert (Hugh Bonneville), and Anne discovers some phonograph records in the basement of the Keyes home, records that contain not fox trots but instead 'conversations' from meetings.  Suspicions about evil derring-do arise when the family learns that Hector has committed suicide soon followed by the suicide of Gilbert and eventually the bizarre discovery of Lawrence's body among the pet animals ordered to be put to death to make the people of England more ready for abrupt changes.  War with Germany begins and changes the atmosphere and results in changes in the Keyes family: Anne is imprisoned by the family because 'she is really not one of us' and unravels the harrowing mystery of the Keyes' family involvement in the dark events of the present and the past.

The mood of England of 1939 is beautifully captured by cinematographer Danny Cohen and the musical score by Adrian Johnston illustrates the dichotomy of the free-spirited Anne and the dark underpinnings of the Keyes family.  Romola Garai is excellent in her treacherous role as are the other stars.  Small roles by Toby Regbo, Christopher Lee, Corin Redgrave and others make this a cast rich in some of the finest British actors of the day.  GLORIOUS 39 ('Glorious' is the nickname given Anne) is an enlightening film that addresses many significant issues too infrequently addressed by works of history.
