5726184,2,B00CLH06H2,"Having been a ""Stripper"", I find this movie"" I'm A Stripper"" a complete puff piece and insult to the ""Stripping"" side of the Adult Entertainment business. After catching the tail end of this pseudo documentary on television, I was curious to see what I've missed and did the film makers give an accurate portrayal of what it is really like being a ""Stripper"", and the answer was NO.  I was shocked to see that a movie about ""Stripping"" had zero full frontal nudity at all, why do a movie about ""Stripping"" and leave out the most important part???  You see more nudity on basic cable tv and in advertising ads. Why is the male nude body something to be ashamed of, when again the title of the movie is called ""I'm A Stripper""???  In this movie you are being shown a super sanitized version of what supposedly happens at these guys ""Stripping"" jobs with no full on nudity. The only exception I'll spare is the boring/cheesy Las Vegas show ""Thunder from Down Under"", which is more like attending an undergear party full of hot muscular guys, most of us know that Chippendales and Thunder from Down Under are not really strip shows. These guys in the movie are working bachelorette parties and seedy clubs where from my first hand knowledge of working both, you have to get completely nude and keep a erection. This doccumentary glosses over everything and leaves people not "" in the know"" of what really goes on at Strip clubs/bars around the country. The reality which is NOT shown in this film, stripping is not glamorous at all! I would say save your few dollars and invest in a Playgirl/Playboy magazine, that way you get to see the full monty!",1367971200,13,1645,4.58843537414966

5726203,3,B00CLH06H2,"I enjoyed that this documentary interviews a wide spectrum of male strippers, from glitzy stage productions to the club scene, even the renewed burlesque variety. I found the interviews to be really interesting in exploring why these guys enjoy being strippers. The production values are good. However, for being a documentary series about strippers, it disappointed in blurring what viewers most likely would be wanting to see: the bare asses and frontal views. The first episode showed a number of clear bare ass shots, but then the other episodes started blurring the views, sometimes even when the guy was just wearing briefs. This downgrades the overall quality of the series.",1478649600,2,681,5.2

that's their whole life. I would be ashamed to have raised a kid that turned out like that. something is really lacking in them as human beings.
what happens when they get old and they fall apart and start drooping every where? I would imagine there a lot of suicides in this profession as the years catch up with them.a pitiful waste of huminity.",1475539200,,646,4.577586206896552

5726246,2,B00CLH06H2,"First off I am giving this review a low 2 so it is more like a 1.  I really expected something more here, not anything like Magic Mike but something more deeper than what I got. I wanted to see the good and the bad, what made these guys be who they are and so many more questions but what you get basically is more like an episode of MTV's Real life docu-drama series that profiles things like this.
I will say the men are attractive and so much more in depth could be told of their lives and as for the star of the movie Jeremy, that guy with the way he is going unfortunately will be dead or broken within 10 years the way he lives his life.",1409702400,3,643,3.9461538461538463
5726247,5,B00CLH06H2,"Yes, they all have their good times with regard to partying, sex, alcohol, drugs, and entertaining others, but it is still work. This film was an eye-opener to the male side of the stripping profession. And, man, the guys in this film are hot; there is nudity too. There is approximately 1 male stripper per 8 female stippers, and the woman make more of the money. But, if a man is interested in entertaining alot of woman and making a living, you might want to look into it.",1408838400,5,475,4.409090909090909
5726248,1,B00CLH06H2,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. This isn't about gay men, it isn't about straight men it is about a group of D-bags you really would rather not know exist in the world.  I guess the point was to disappoint.",1396137600,2,198,4.076923076923077
5726249,5,B00CLH06H2,I love this short film and the men are so sexy but to bad not enough danching and too much talking.  If you like strippers get the girls or guys together and pour out the Martinies and the Martins too lol watch and have fun!,1392076800,,224,3.977777777777778
5726250,5,B00CLH06H2,A whole different way to look at Male Strippers  some things you never thought of are revealed  sort of the X version of the Movie Magic Mike  it is interesting if you ever wondered What that lifestyle is about  a fun insight into a private world it was cool i enjoyed it,1390953600,,271,4.153846153846154
5726251,4,B00CLH06H2,"I am personally acquainted with several men who strip.  I liked this documentary for the most part. I think it was fairly honest.  My only complaint would be that it doesn't go far enough to paint a complete picture: the filmmakers seem to be squeamish, to shy away from the deeper issues.  For example, I know men who don't mind stripping, but I can't think of ONE who would say he loves doing it.  I would like to know why.  I have met men who have some longstanding emotional wounds after stripping for an extended period. I know that customers can get rather abusive, and the stripper is trapped between holding onto his integrity and pleasing the club owner to keep his job. I think we need to hear about those situations in order for this to be a complete portrait of strippers. I also don't think the doc looked far enough into gay stripping, which is a world unto itself: the only stripper that addressed that is straight himself.  Particularly in Montreal, gay male strippers are a dime a dozen, and it would have been interesting to know more about it.",1390003200,10,1062,4.505208333333333
5726252,4,B00CLH06H2,I found this DVD to be interesting but not very extensive.  Worth the time but would like more examples and details.,1387152000,5,116,4.523809523809524
5726253,5,B00CLH06H2,"I thought this doc did a great job of getting into the heads of 4 different guys and what motivates them to work in the adult industry.  There was so much going on psychologically with each guy.  It was also pretty hilarious - especially Jeremy and the King.  There were many times when I was absolutely shocked and couldn't believe what I was seeing or hearing.

The guys are hot, the music was great and I really enjoyed this insight into the lives of dancing men.",1368057600,9,466,4.383720930232558
8583113,5,B00CLH06H2,Interesting doc on the real life world of male strippers.,1524009600,,57,4.8
8583114,4,B00CLH06H2,I wonder if a lot of the guys (and a couple of the women) have watched the show themselves and are aware of what meatheads they're made out to be. Such transparent BS. But it's a different slice of life (looking at you Canada) and the episodes are well-paced.,1519603200,,259,4.3061224489795915
8583115,4,B00CLH06H2,"As an entertaining mini series about strippers, this is a pretty good series.  You can't possibly think that this is going to be a very educational documentary.  It does, however, offer an insight into strippers personal vs. professional lives with a wide variety of examples in terms of the type of strippers: pole dancing type, bachelor party type, gogo dancer type, naked down to nothing on-stage type, etc.  I like that they talked about the various types of strippers and in each episode offers a small sample of strippers who were willing to speak about their thoughts and sharing their personal lives including meeting their parents or significant other, etc.  The series added a human aspect to these individuals and not just wild problematic people in society.  Each show included commentaries and interviews done by a radio DJ psychologist who offers the more social and psychological explanations as to what drives people to participate in the industry.  The series comes from the idea that this is a profession and not just some sinful behavior.  It is human nature and has been part of society historically, and will not disappear even if there are people who may view it as a sin or a social dysfunction.  So, if you have already made up your mind that stripping is wrong, don't bother watching this series as you will never appreciate it.  However, if you feel that strippers are human beings in a profession that offers them a job, then watch the series as it will give you some behind-the-scenes understanding of what motivates these individuals to do what they do, and how there is a huge section of society that serves as an audience.",1487548800,,1653,4.833333333333333

8583118,4,B00CLH06H2,"This was an interesting series to watch.  Most gay men at some point have been to strip clubs - especially those who go to Montreal (which is featured) - and have some familiarity with the scene.  What you thought you knew and some of what you didn't know was presented candidly in this documentary.  The film making is good quality.  Some of the personal stories are fascinating.  Involvement of family members and friends provided insight beyond the titillation factor of seeing men undress.  The series covered stripping for money, as entertainment, as art, and as a lifestyle.  It uncovered the sex, drugs, and the tawdry side of the scene; but also the need to make money, find self expression, and enjoy life.  Fetish, vaudeville, performance art, transgender, webcam, and bisexuality are topics also explored.  Full frontal nudity is not shown, so if you are expecting that you may be disappointed.",1486339200,3,905,4.98
