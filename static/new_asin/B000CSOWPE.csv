2472886,5,B000CSOWPE,"Georgian dance does not get the recognition it deserves. This DVD has fantastic footage and music from a performance of Georgian dance. We showed it to friends after our trip to Georgia and they were amazed at the athleticism and grace of the dancers. Not only is this a great DVD to watch, but the music alone puts you in the mood for a Georgian Supra.",1233964800,,353,4.363636363636363

2472890,5,B000CSOWPE,"As a culture Georgia is virtually unknown in the west beyond its unique and powerful vocal traditions. This is the first commercially available DVD of Georgian dance that I've come across and I am very happy to give it a five star recommendation on its own merits as well as in the hope that Georgian dance will one day be as much appreciated as Georgian music.

To the uninitiated, Georgian dance is kind of like ""Riverdance"" performed sideways. Reactions of people who have never seen this before have ranged from ""Holy Hell!"" (a work colleague) to ""Oh my God!"" (my 12 year old son).",1137715200,17,585,4.625

8101814,5,B000CSOWPE,"Georgian Legend is an incredible DVD about country of Georgia's dance that demonstrates culture, traditions, energy and history of Georgian people. It shows spectacular performance of one of the best Georgian folk dance group ""Erisioni"" in France and Switzerland. My four years old son fall in love with this DVD and keeps watching it over and over again. I would recommend this DVD to all Georgians living outside of their motherland and to all people who would like to get introduce to Georgian culture and history and who whould like to enjoy the beauty of the dance!",1294272000,3,570,4.88659793814433
8101815,5,B000CSOWPE,"Magnificient show, a must-have DVD for Georgians abroad. Right now this is the best DVD of georgian national dances available anywhere.

Also loved bonus material on DVD, and small video about country Georgia. If anyone wants to get familiar with this country - must watch it! You'll get to feel Georgian spirit through the songs and dances.",1245369600,,348,4.721311475409836
8101817,5,B000CSOWPE,"Georgian Legend is one of the best DVDs I've purchased through Amazon. It is a great show of performing art and culture. I don't know the language, but I can understand the story through the amazing steps by the artists. Different from River Dance, they dance on toes. Different from Ballet, they dance on knees. The sparkles from the swords clashing tell the bravery of men. Women and men, old and young, their great performance tells the ledend of the culture. I hope I can find more like this one through Amazon.",1234828800,,515,4.608695652173913
