8510452,4,B000LAZDQU,"I borrowed this from the public library.  While it is not exactly knee-safe, it's not terrible, either, as modifications are presented.  It is of moderate difficulty, especially if the dance style (is it really dance?) isn't your thing.  The instructor is upbeat and the moves are pretty fast.  Worth having in the video library for something a little different.  The first time through I was having trouble following but the next time it seemed a lot easier.  I definitely got my heart rate up.",1509753600,,495,4.833333333333333
8510453,1,B000LAZDQU,"This aerobics DVD was definitely converted from VHS format. The image is all pixelated, barely in color, and takes place in some freaky room with black tape all over it.

The main girl doesn't look anything like the one on the cover. In fact, it's a completely different person. There are 5 people in the video, all wearing dr. martins (no sneakers or gym wear) and the music is from 1988.

If you for some reason do buy this DVD, there is 1 good part.. the end where the teacher goes CRAZY and starts tap dancing like crazy to this 80's music and everyone circles around her clapping. VERY WEIRD INDEED.",1193270400,38,604,4.4324324324324325
