7885900,5,6305229376,"I liked this movie very much.  I do not know much about the conflict in Northern Ireland and I abhor violence, especially violence done in the name of religion.  This story is more like Shakespear's Romeo and Juliet as it is about the attraction between two young poeple from different branches of the same culture. Plus, I am just a little bit biased as I am a great fan of Gabriel Byrne's.",1036368000,4,391,4.416666666666667
7885901,5,6305229376,"All the drama of the Irish troubles embodied in an adolescent romance.  Samantha Morton is amazing & heartbreaking - torn to bits among her family, lover, and conscience - without her the movie might just be a decent effort, but she gives it soul & torment.  The music and imagery are also wonderful.  NOT a light popcorn movie - this one will stay in your heart & head.",1027382400,5,370,4.411764705882353
7885902,5,6305229376,"This strong portrayal of family values, honor and the effects of religion and society in Northern Ireland are balanced with the sweet undertones of romance in this wonderfully written movie. Focused on life after the 1994 peace treaty, the story shows the heart and soul of an ancient fight. Gabriel Byrne and Richard Harris both gave strong performance as well as the two young actors. The movie helped to put a human face to the reality of Northern Ireland's conflict.",1008633600,4,470,4.8875
7885903,4,6305229376,"""This is the Sea"" was an unexpected surprise. Although the movie is a romance, the real drive is the ongoing fighting in Northern Ireland. The film is a little choppy in a couple of places probably due to editing, but otherwise it moves along nicely telling the story from both a Catholic family and a Protestant family, and the portrayals are not what one might expect. The real gems of the film are the two young lovers, Ross McDade and Samantha Morton. McDade is truly awesome and it's hard not to fall in love with his character, Malachay, and Morton is right on target as the sheltered Hazel. This is a good film worth watching.",990230400,6,633,4.51304347826087
7885904,5,6305229376,"""This is the Sea"" is one of those wonders that come along once  in a lifetime. I was sitting around late one night, searching for a movie  when the came on HBO..after viewing it, I immediately ordered it and owned  it. It is incredible: terrific acting, great music by Mike Scott and the  Waterboys, Richard Harris and Gabriel Bryne give good, albeit unnoticed  superb performances. And the young actors Ross McDade and Samantha Morton,  if you want a story that fully shows the ""troubles"" of Northern  Ireland,well i say this is it for, ""this is the sea"". Enjoy  it....I watch it over and over again.",965952000,10,601,4.6571428571428575
