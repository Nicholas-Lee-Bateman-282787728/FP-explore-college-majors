8120512,5,B000FBYRT4,I loved the book but I bought it to give to my grandson.  Im not sure it's going to be his style if writing not enough descriptive action.  Perhaps too much garden description. It is written for past readers I feel more when I was young.,1475798400,,237,4.130434782608695

8120516,5,B000FBYRT4,"Based on the novel Tom's Midnight Garden by Phillipa Pearce, this charming and beautifully filmed 1999 children's drama is engaging, the only pity being that the DVD is not available as a Region One DVD. Luckily I was able to watch the entire movie thanks to a kind soul who uploaded the movie on Youtube.

The story focuses on the experiences of a young boy named Tom (Anthony Way) who is sent away for a short while to live with his Aunt Gwen (played by Greta Sacchi) and Uncle Alan (James Wilby) while his brother recuperates from measles. Initially Tom is bored by the lack of interesting activities for an active young boy like him but he soon makes a startling discovery - the ancient grandfather's clock in the huge manor they live in (actually it's been subdivided into apartments) chimes thirteen times at midnight. When Tom goes downstairs one night, he opens the back door, and instead of being greeted by dustbins, he finds a beautiful garden.

Soon Tom discovers that another alternate reality exists, one in which he is invisible to everyone but a young girl named Hatty (Florence Hoath) and that Hatty lives in the 19th century together with a mean aunt who hates her, and a brood of indifferent cousins. As Tom and Hatty develop a strong bond, he discovers something else - even when Tom visits Hatty every night, he finds that a longer time has passed in Hatty's world so that soon Hatty has grown into a teenager experiencing the pangs of first love.

The story is unique and interesting, and though I can recall watching other similar time-travel type stories, this production is engaging because it is beautifully filmed, capturing the charms of an English garden in full bloom and also well-cast. The young actors playing the roles of Tom and Hatty deliver amazingly engaging performances. I hope this production is available as a Region One DVD soon because I'd like to have it in my home DVD library. There's also an older production of the same title made in 1974.",1350345600,6,1988,4.706896551724138
8120517,5,B000FBYRT4,I thought this was one of the most charming children's movies ever.  I loved it and am hoping I'll be able to find it in DVD format for the US soon!!,1345248000,7,149,3.806451612903226
8120518,5,B000FBYRT4,"I've just watched this on BBC iPlayer and it is a very nice fantasy story. The ending reminds me of that Mel Gibson film about the guy frozen who comes back to life and meets his 'sweetheart' at the end who has aged, whereas he has not. I've just looked it up, it's 'Forever Young'. However, that's only the end, so enjoy the 'trip'.",1339372800,4,333,4.21875
8120519,3,B000FBYRT4,"As a family film, this isn't so bad. I call it odd because there are a few oddities that are never really explained. I'm sure many parallels will be drawn with 'The Magic Garden' and rightly so. Nevertheless, it is obviously not a US film as there are no product tie-ins, violence, and inane dialogue. It is a gentle film that would be light entertainment for the adult and a charming story for children.

A multi-region player is necessary to view this film.",1217030400,17,459,4.530120481927711
