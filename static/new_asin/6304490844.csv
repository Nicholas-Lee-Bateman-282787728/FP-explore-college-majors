891055,5,6304490844,I had this years ago while teaching. After retirement gave all my resources away. I'm now back teaching preschoolers both at our school AND our church. A great way to teach the true reason for the season of giving.,1391040000,,214,4.512820512820513

891057,5,6304490844,"This was a great DVD to teach children the origins of ""Santa.""
My grandchildren, aged 8 and 9 yrs. really enjoyed it and were surprised
that Saint Nicholas was a Priest and Bishop...The only thing I thought was ""hokey"" was that Nicholas gained a great deal of weight while incarcerated. Not too likely! Other than that I loved it. Highly recommend!",1364860800,,348,4.721311475409836
891058,5,6304490844,"""Nicholas the Boy Who Became Santa"" is a well produced short biographical cartoon of Saint Nicholas set in the town of Myra in the fourth century Roman Empire. The story is quite short, only thrity minutes long, and it spans his entire life. For this reason, I think that the cartoon was made to appeal to young children, though I think there is no reason why teenagers or adults wouldn't also enjoy it.

The cartoon follows both the historical and legendary information that we know about Saint Nicholas, including the death of his parents when he was young, his generosity with his inheritence and his imprisonment during Diocletian's persecution of Christians. Above all,the cartoon dramatizes the difficulties faced by Christians during this period and emphasizes Nicholas' generosity. This production is not intended to be a full biography of Saint Nicholas and as implied by the title, it tries to show how the Santa Claus tradition is rooted in the life of a historical saint. The cartoon ends with Saint Nicholas as an old man with a white beard in his bishop's garments giving gifts to people in Myra on Christmas Eve.

If you would like to teach the origins of Santa Claus and Christmas gift giving to your younger children, this film would defintiley be for you. This cartoon would also be for you if you are curious about Saint Nicholas and the historical roots of Santa Claus. If you want a detailed historically accurate biography of Saint Nicholas you will not be fully satisfied but keep in mind this is a thirty minute cartoon. I recommend this story above all because it teaches us about Saint Nicholas' generosity.",1320796800,11,1633,4.849462365591398
891059,5,6304490844,This is a great movie!  I show it every year to my Sunday School students.  It explains the Christian origins of Santa Claus and how Nicholas believed in giving away everything he owned.  Very entertaining and informative!,1299110400,,222,4.945945945945946
891060,5,6304490844,"This is the story of St. Nicholas... a real boy who became known for his giving spirit.  Speaking from a Traditional Catholic's perspective, this movie does an excellent job explaining how the story of Santa came about... from St. Nicholas, of course!  Clean movie (and I am REALLY, REALLY picky), highly recommend!",1290988800,9,315,5.038461538461538
891061,5,6304490844,"Forget the flying reindeer and talking snowmen.  This short video is a great way to explain the real St. Nicholas and the origins of Santa.  I've given this video as a gift several times and it is always well received.  The animation is somewhat dated and less sophisticated than what you get now, but it is still a good purchase.",1289260800,,330,4.466666666666667

7873046,5,6304490844,"My daughter loves this movie--although I haven't watched it but once, she has watched it numerous times since she got it for Christmas and I'm glad  she likes it so much.  This has a positive message about selflessness and giving of yourself to help others, even if it costs you.  Saint Nicholas was a wonderful example of true Christianity, and I'm happy to share this movie with my daughter to teach her about people of the faith.  We have several movies by this company, and all of them tell wonderful stories that children can easily understand and relate to.  I highly recommend this movie and really any other movie by CCC.",1457049600,,629,4.63063063063063

7873051,4,6304490844,"Has a very 1980s animation feel, but the story is great and it really helped my 3 year old understand the Catholic origin of Christmas and also eased her fear of Santa.",1419638400,,168,4.28125
