4398344,5,B004KV92W2,"My daughter saw part of it in her world history class and asked to see the whole thing when she got home. Goofy, but entertaining...a Bollywood High School Musical with a strong family theme.",1426896000,,191,4.647058823529412
4398345,5,B004KV92W2,"This is an updated style of Bollywood family saga with ample dance and song interludes. There is the classic Bollywood sharp left turn midway through the film from the melancholic backstory to the vivid, playful ""other side of the world"" with the estranged elder brother in London with his family. If you enjoy traditional yet moderately progressive Bolly films with a predictable storyline that is well-acted, well-written, and with a generous sprinkling of laughter, wit, joy, and life lessons, this may be a film you will enjoy. The cast is 5 star, and it's nice to see SRK, Hrithik, Kajol, and the inimitable Amitabh Bachchan [and more!] together.",1426204800,5,651,5.037037037037037

Made me laugh, made me bawl my eyes out but most of all, it made me appreciate my loved ones and especially my parents.

I have watched this a gazillion times...so worth my time and money :) :) Love the soundtrack  ",1473120000,,253,4.1020408163265305
4398369,5,B004KV92W2,"Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham is a must watch movie for people of all backgrounds and all languages. Amazon's video quality is top notch and the English subtitles allows individuals of all languages to appreciate and enjoy the movie. Although the movie is on the longer side at 3 hours and 31 minutes it is undeniably a classic Bollywood movie.

The movie includes valuable lessons on life, love, and marriage. It explores the dynamics of various family relationships to include the bond between a father and son, husband and wife, brother and brother, or the voice of a mother. It is an intricate balance between drama, song, dance, and dialogue. Furthermore it presents many opportunities for comedy (while at times a tearjerker) and is best heralded as a must watch!",1471305600,,764,4.922480620155039

4398371,5,B004KV92W2,"A story of the difficulty a father has in expressing his vulnerable  emotions. A mother that try's to express her view points and is over looked, and then finally has the last word. The father and husband a strong powerful businessman that is passing on his business and family traditions onto sons. Very good story line and all the main characters - well known actors play excellent rolls. The dancing in the movie is excellent. I enjoyed every moment of this movie. This movie is well balanced, drama, comedy, and romance.",1465257600,,524,4.758241758241758
4398372,5,B004KV92W2,"We are totally crazy about Bollywood films, the music, the dancing, the ridiculously romantic stories and the integration of Indian culture into their stories is wonderful.

A warning: be prepared for:
1) subtitles
2) very long movies
3) very long song and dance routines (try staying sitting down-you will want to get up and try to dance)
4) old fashioned drama and romance",1464566400,,374,4.936507936507937

4398374,5,B004KV92W2,I love this movie!!!! It has readable subtitles and good quality. Does not buffer at all.,1462060800,,89,4.625
4398375,5,B004KV92W2,"Easily one of the best films of all time. It is my favorite, hands down.

This story is about family, about the gap between the old and the new that children and adults of the time could relate to. it spreads a positive message and may be an emotional roller coaster between happiness and sadness (wow that title is pretty accurate isn't it?) but it will definitely leave you wit positive feelings afterwards.

The romance and humor is beautiful, the acting is superb, the film holds up to modern standards perfectly. The writing and pacing is excellent.

The songs are great, this film is timeless. I'm sure most people reading this review have already seen it, this was a film that was - is - incredibly popular, and rightfully so. If you haven't, I assure you this is worth the time to watch.",1458432000,,795,4.545454545454546
4398376,4,B004KV92W2,"Watching Bollywood movies with a friend who is a die-hard fan. This one is apparently one of the major films that is referred to in many others, and it features some of the biggest names in Bollywood (Amitabh Machchan, Shah Rukh Khan, etc.) and some famous scenes. I appreciated the acting and especially the dancing by Hrithik Roshan and others, but the film felt extremely long and predictable to me. The women are just set, stereotypical characters who don't change or grow, the male leads do an awful lot of dramatic posing, and the title song gets repeated I don't know how many times. I guess this is a classic and everyone interested in Bollywood needs to watch it, but I probably won't watch it again.",1457222400,,709,4.634920634920635
