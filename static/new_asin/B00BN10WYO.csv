5656948,5,B00BN10WYO,"I've recently started buying a lot of Korean movies in order to listen to real live semi-authentic Korean conversation to help me learn the Korean language. I wish with Amazon Instant Videos you could turn the subtitles off but I find just ignoring the subtitles if you're learning helps and they're there to help if you need them. This movie is funny, cute and corny but funny and the characters will have you laughing.",1393027200,,420,4.6891891891891895
5656949,4,B00BN10WYO,"I bought this as a gift for my daughter's birthday (she had it on her wish list)...and watched it with her. It was kind of a strange movie (especially if you are not used to other movie culture styles), but all in all a cute movie; which we both enjoyed!",1390608000,,254,4.1
5656950,5,B00BN10WYO,Wonderful movie!  A must for your video library .  Funny and light hearted. Jang Keun Suk is awesome as always.,1383004800,2,111,4.5
5656951,4,B00BN10WYO,"You have to suspend disbelief and just go with the premise of a man agreeing to be a woman's pet to watch this, but Jang Keun Suk is so cute that it's worth it. Somewhat of a guilty pleasure for me it's done the great service of getting me to read the manga it was adapted from, Tramps Like Us. The one thing I really don't like is the amount of hitting. Really?!? You get upset, frustrated, angry and the only response is to start whacking your pet? Someone should call the Humane Society on that girl!!",1380672000,3,504,4.206185567010309
5656952,5,B00BN10WYO,OMG Jang Keun-suk is my favorite!!! This movie is so funny and just flat out a feelgood movie!!!! Watch it!,1379289600,,107,4.4
5656953,5,B00BN10WYO,"Jang Keun (or Geum) Suk is perfect in this role.  He's just so CUTE!  That smile of his just gives me the giggly goosebumps.  JKS is a laid back dancer that just needs a warm place to stay for a while.  Enter the lady who has bad luck with all sorts of love dating disasters.  Her brother, who is friends with JKS, suggests that he bunk down with the sister.  She is no longer interested in love, but is willing to put up with a ""pet"".  So the agreement is made.  He greets her at the door with a smile & gratitude.  He is appreciative of her cooking & in her care of him.  BUT then things progress nicely.  He is still her pet, but she starts 'worrying' about how he is doing when she is not home, etc.

Watch the movie THRU the credits....extra scenes are included.

Enjoy!",1376265600,11,775,4.120805369127517
5656954,5,B00BN10WYO,"I've lost count of how many times I've watched this.  It's a cute little comedy that will lift your spirits when they are in need of a lift.  There's something about Jang Keun Suk's speaking voice that is very melodic and soothing.  Just make sure you get one with good subtitles (these were on the better end).  And I have looked and looked, but i can't get that clock in the U.S.! Someone manufacture one for us!!!",1374364800,,416,4.363636363636363
5656955,5,B00BN10WYO,I had been looking for this for sometime now and I am glad to have finally found it here. And it's not dubbed so that's a bonus,1373328000,,127,3.740740740740741
5656956,2,B00BN10WYO,"I read the manga, I've watched the J-drama series. I was looking forward to seeing this version of the story. Unfortunately, the subtitles drop out frequently, often at lines I know from watching and reading other iterations are important in character and plot development. (My Korean is nowhere near good enough to help me confirm it, though.) It's intensely frustrating, and not even turning on the Amazon subtitles will get around the issue (they never show up, except to tell you music is playing). If this one problem were fixed, I'd give this video a much higher rating, as the cast is charming in their roles.",1480982400,,616,4.820754716981132
5656957,2,B00BN10WYO,"The chemistry wasn't there, feel like the main actress was phoning in her performance. Have no idea why she would logically agree to this arrangement so the premise seemed shaky. Romance felt forced and very predictable story line.",1477612800,,231,5.105263157894737
5656958,3,B00BN10WYO,"This is a cute romcom. It is based upon a staple of Korean movies and dramas: a couple who, for their disparate reasons, decide to live together under false pretenses so as to provide them with a ""beard"" that permits a single man and a single woman to live together. Ji Eun Yi (Kim Ha Neul) is a high powered career woman who is unable to sustain a romantic attachment with a man and who is beginning to reach an age where she is hearing ""spinster"" whispered behind her back.  Indeed, she is beginning to feel lonely and wishes she had someone to go home to at night. Kang In Ho (Jang Geun Suk) is a dancer who is unable to dance because he is haunted by a mistake he made that caused the woman he was dancing with to sustain a career ending injury. He would like to become a choreographer, but he is between careers and without a place to stay.  He is brought to Eun Yi's home by her brother and a deal is negotiated between them to permit him to live with her on the condition that he takes on the role of being her dead, but not forgotten, dog Momo.  Both being veterans of movies and dramas Ha Neul and Geun Suk are able to generate comfortable and droll performances that yield good chemistry and prevent the movie from sliding over the edge into slapstick. There are several scenes of the two of them interacting as mistress and dog, including one where he climbs into her bed to sleep, that are sweet and amusing.  And that's how the movie is kept from becoming tawdry; everything is kept sweet and the sexual undertones inherent to the mistress/pet relationship are largely suppressed.  There are the usual elements, the triangle with the ex-boyfriend, another with a pretty young girl who can't understand why In Ho is interested in an old lady. But there isn't much new here. The dialog is ordinary, the cinematography is ordinary, the plot flirts with being trite, the acting is almost too relaxed and the movie never quite rises to being funny. But they look good together and there is nothing offensive. If you are a real romcom fan (as I am) you will probably watch it more than once.",1477526400,,2098,4.424870466321243

5656973,3,B00BN10WYO,"Okay so where to begin? As a whole the actual movie was meh . This is in regards to plot , character building, and relationship building. The story itself had potential but ultimately falls short. It was right on the verge of pulling me in and investing in the characters and their relationship with one another. To be brief I didn't get a romantic spark between the lead woman and either parties of her love triangle. Did she really grow and learn something through the course of this movie? Lukewarm love triangle aside, I am a Jang Geun Suk fan. He is a talented actor for certain. The choices he makes in regard to character development are refreshing. He is really adorable in this movie (exactly like a lost puppy) , I always enjoy watching his subtle character nuances. I love his more dramatic roles but in this movie he proves his comedic timing is just as tremendous. Watching him was where I got the most enjoyment. Here is the thing, when he is acting I'm always awaiting to see what choice he'll make or what route he'll take with a character , and I always end up being pleasantly surprised. Jang Geun Suk made me laugh for most of this movie and if he wasn't in this movie I don't believe momo's character would have been half as interesting , heck this movie wouldn't have been half as enjoyable.

Side Note: The crawl had me in tears and Mandy had me swooning.",1456272000,,1377,4.442687747035573

5656977,2,B00BN10WYO,"I know this movie is based on a manga, but it's still too far-fetched for me as a live action piece. Since I couldn't get behind the main gist of the whole story line, I couldn't really get behind any of the characters either. I think this one would be better suited for the tween generation.",1449705600,,292,4.232142857142857
5656978,4,B00BN10WYO,"A cute movie worth an evening. Why the male did not get the epic beat-down that was coming to him from the handsome ex is anyone's guess.

The female office worker/friend of the female lead is a conniving b**ch that needs a rope around her neck - FAST

The subtitles were FUBAR in this movie. Whoever was in charge of the subtitles needs a new job. Brush up on your Korean, maggots!

I think the female lead (the cute Kim Na-neul) needed to pull the stick out and mellow out. She nearly got massively screwed in the end.

Why she ended up the way she did in the end was mystifying...can't they just date like normal couples? What do I know?!",1449014400,,641,4.2727272727272725

The characters were quirky yet realistic, the comedy was in the right place and didn't feel forced and the romance was genuine. It seems like everyone making this movie had a lot of fun.

We rated this movie a 4 out of 5 stars because the cinematography was odd at times with some scenes that could have been done much better and the subtitles were broken in a few spots. Other than that: great movie to watch as a couple snuggling up on the couch :).",1441324800,,595,4.173913043478261

However since I am very used to the dramas, it felt like the movie moved too quickly and the ending fell off sharply.  On top of that, the subtitles were missing and also not very accurate.  Which isn't the movie's fault, but Amazon's.

The movie itself was very cute and had its funny moments throughout the movie but it did leaving me wanting more funny or cute moments.

I see that a lot of the reviews complain about 'missing' subtitles - but I'd like to clarify that they aren't actually missing as such. I've seen this subtitle 'skipping' issue a lot online in general. If you scroll back the movie and re-watch it then the subtitles usually appear when you re-watch that part. I agree that it's annoying, but it's incorrect to say that the subtitles aren't there... I think maybe it's a streaming issue but, as I've said, it's not exclusive to amazon as I encounter the same problem regularly on other sites - some of which offer the option of pop-out subtitles which bring up all the subtitles in a separate window so you can check it for anything that gets skipped instead of having to rewind the scene.

5657022,2,B00BN10WYO,"Biggest issue: the Amazon Instant Video version of this has a huge subtitle problem, in that about half of the spoken lines are not subtitled at all. The subtitles that exist seem okay (ignoring typographical issues, like the ""^I"" that precedes all the subtitles that were supposed to be italicized), but when you don't know what they're actually saying half the time, it's a lot harder to follow the story.

The movie itself seems like a relatively standard star-vehicle rom-com. The underlying gimmick is a homeless dancer imposing himself on his friend's sister, through an ill-conceived (by the sister) ""deal"" of sorts in which he agrees to be her pet. This deal is taken literally only to the extent that it benefits the dancer; he takes great liberties with it when doing so would be more convenient for him.

The woman is presented early in the film as a strong, career-driven woman, but her portrayal overall is not so generous. She lets this man take advantage of her, with the implication that she really wants to be controlled and manipulated. To me, it really seemed more like an anti-feminist story.

Due to the subtitling issue, I only got about half-way through (and probably shouldn't have bothered with that much). I assume by the end of the movie, the boy gets the girl and we learn just how submissive she really would prefer to be. At least, that's where the movie was headed where I left off.",1411689600,,1413,4.735772357723577

He's been kicked out of his home by his parents who do not accept his new career goals and she's having a hard time in every aspect of her life - family, love, and work. I really appreciated her eventual realization that he wasn't there for room and board, but because he enjoyed their time together (especially her lack of expectations, since she knew nothing about him).

Be sure to watch the adorable scene in the end credits where she loses a bet and has to be HIS pet for a day.  Too cute.

Regarding subtitles: they are all there, but instead of coming up when the actor begins speaking, it seems timed to end with their speech instead.  It makes for an odd watching/reading experience.  The subtitles are better on Hulu, but you have to sit through commercials. I found it worthwhile to watch it there first and do my re-watching here.",1409356800,,1011,4.527472527472527

5657027,5,B00BN10WYO,I saw this on Netflix and it was titled YOU'RE MY PET.  I loved it! It made me laugh.  Such a cute Korean Rom-Com film.  Then it was dropped on Netflix and I couldn't find it on Hulu either so I search Amazon.  I was so thrilled to find it there.  I love having it as part of my K-Film and K-Drama collection.  Good English Subs.,1409011200,,329,3.909090909090909
5657028,5,B00BN10WYO,I am hooked on this movie.,1408579200,,26,3.5
5657029,1,B00BN10WYO,"I actually really enjoyed the movie once I finally found somewhere to watch it, but I'm sad to say it's almost unwatchable here on amazon.  It's missing subtitles all over the place on this site for some reason.  Most of the time it's the first phrase or line of one of the actors at the start of a conversational scene and that gets very annoying very quickly because you'll hear them say something to another character, but you only get subtitles for the response they get, and no idea about what was asked.  Once I'd understand, maybe twice, but I watch a lot of subtitled movies and tv shows and the number of missing subtitles that happened in the first 15 minutes made me sooooo frustrated.  I finally closed down my amazon window at 26mins into the film and went to find the movie elsewhere which was also irritating as I had to wade through several poorly subbed versions before finding a decent one.  Over all it's a cute little rom-com and while I know people who watched the tv series or read the manga may not be pleased with it, I liked it.  I'd give it a good 3-4 stars in terms of the actual movie because I think everyone should watch a slightly corny and fun rom-com every once in a while.  However, as far as watching it through amazon I have to give it 1 star only due to, well, the fact that you really can't watch it here. Please Amazon...do not subject your paying Prime members to such subpar subtitles.",1406419200,19,1426,4.378787878787879

5657031,1,B00BN10WYO,"I watched it yesterday and today don't recall a single thing about it.
Oh yeah, I vaguely remember some actor playing the role of a schnauzer or was it a mutt?
Undoubtedly this was a head-scratching, brow-raising, nonsensical comedy... and ""Much Ado About Nothing!""",1403568000,,265,5.045454545454546
5657032,4,B00BN10WYO,"Took a chance and watched a movie with subtitles, takes a bit of getting use to but I really enjoyed this comedy and will probably watch it again.  Some of it was silly but layered with a lot of truth, and I'm a sucker for a happy ending.",1402790400,,238,3.9583333333333335
5657033,1,B00BN10WYO,"I don't speak Korean but I can hear and read when subtitles are clearly missing. I noticed them from the start then finally got fed up. I can't believe no one else has commented on this, here is one example of 2 different scenes right after each-other. From 1:28:40 (time remaining) to 1:27:50 (time remaining) When she is sitting at the table with the guy talking about pet names, she is talking but nothing is being translated and then it gives his response to a question. The next scene is with her & her father, again she talks, no translations and he gives an answer to a question.

I enjoy watching foreign movies because I don't get to travel a lot. So it's a sight to see checking out the different countries. Unfortunately guessing on what they are saying isn't fun for me.",1400112000,3,782,4.468531468531468
5657034,1,B00BN10WYO,"This is the stupidest, waste of time ever. I tried to give it a chance. I'm a guy, -a romantic at heart. I like a lot of Korean movies and happen to think their film industry is first rate. However, I couldn't force myself to watch this to the end. The premise is so ridiculous, but I knew that going in. I was just giving it a chance, hoping somehow they could pull it off. Even if you're a 13 year old girl, I don't think there's any hope or redeeming qualities in this movie. Skip it. You'll thank me later. There are much better movies out there.",1399075200,,550,4.101851851851852

5657038,5,B00BN10WYO,"I have been a fan of JGS since Mary Stayed out All night with Moon Geun Young.  And I have pretty much every single show that he has done including Beethoven Virus which is his only serious role.  Kim Ha Neul caught my attention in A Gentleman's Dignity; she was funny there and even more so with JGS.  I very much enjoyed the two of them working together in this movie.

Now if they could only put it on DVD so I can purchase it.",1396915200,4,430,4.023529411764706
5657039,2,B00BN10WYO,"First half of the movie was extremely corny, and it got better when the plot got a little interesting, then by the last 15 minutes it got corny and boring again. Male lead looks like a girl and wears makeup.  He'd look much better with black hair too.",1396569600,,251,4.229166666666667
5657040,3,B00BN10WYO,"I think a lot more could have been done with this film but I found much of it silly and the acting was not up to par to what most Korean actors are capable of. Definitely geared to the younger generation. I miss the important spiritual messages that are in the older Korean films. I know someone mentioned that the male lead was hot but if you like your men looking like girls, then maybe. Overall, I kept telling myself how stupid it was especially during the first half of the film, almost turned it off but I always tend to hang in there. Would probably be an enjoyable film to watch with your girlfriends, definitely a chick-flick.",1395705600,3,635,4.389830508474576
5657041,3,B00BN10WYO,"Similar to the manga Tramps Like Us, this is a light romantic comedy.

Would have given more stars if had better acting. I love the male lead but it is very different from his other roles and could have been better.  Or maybe something was lost in the translation.

Would give a PG rating for sexual dialogue.",1395705600,2,309,4.385964912280702
5657042,5,B00BN10WYO,"I'm a huge fan of JGS and was really excited to watch yet another movie with him starring - and it didn't disappoint!  This was such a cute movie that had me laughing at some parts and fangirling at others (i.e. him crawling on the floor towards her).  For me, a good movie keeps me entertained and involved throughout and I definitely had this.  An additional star for casting attractive male leads both older and younger, especially while playing Wii sports...just watch it and you'll know what I mean.",1395360000,6,504,4.640449438202247

I've watched this movie several times since it arrived.  It's one of those fun to watch favorites for a rainy day or just when you want to see something happy.",1393545600,,350,4.40625

8571285,3,B00BN10WYO,"I like  Jang Keun-suk  but wasn't so thrilled with this movie. They gave him long, lighter long hair, probably because the main character's childhood dog was a golden retriever, but it wasn't a very flattering look for him . You don't learn till the extra footage in the credits that he accepts being pushed around because he has 5 sisters. Knowing that early on would have explained alot about his patience & understanding. Kim Na-neul was unreasonably irritating alot of the time & it was hard to want her to end up with any guy. I watched this twice & my opinion was better the second time, though Jang Keun-suk was so much better in Your'e Beautiful & Baby & Me
About 1/3 of the movie is not translated into the English subtitles. You miss alot of conversations & have to guess. It's watchable but would have been better with a more complete translation !",1522972800,,859,4.535483870967742
8571286,4,B00BN10WYO,"I love the movie, but the subtitles were not so great. Namely, they cut out at inopportune times.

8571287,5,B00BN10WYO,"Not what I expected, but was very pleasantly surprised. Geun Suk does not crawl around like a dog, which I was glad of. He absolutely made this movie! His expressions and cute looks are priceless. He does this side head movement that is just too adorable. Look for it. Not much development of the story, but a short and cute romance none the less.

8571291,5,B00BN10WYO,"Loosely based on the Japanese manga (comic) Kimi wa Petto (You're my Pet) aka Tramps Like Us, I've watched the Japanese series based off of the same manga and enjoyed it. I was curious when I saw it, because I enjoyed the manga, too, and was curious what sort of spin they'd put on it. It was definitely interesting that they actually gave the pet a bit more backstory to explain how he came to be in the box, and what happened before, rather than her just coming home to find him in the box.

All in all, I'd actually say that this is definitely a fresh spin on the series, seriously condensed into a movie. It's been a while since I've read it, but there are definite deviations from the manga, such as the master character being more feminine, rather than the fan of wrestling, K-1, and shonen (for boys) anime who smokes that she is in the manga. From the looks of it, her ex doesn't leave her for his mistress, either. Though, everything else is pretty close. Typical spiteful wench side character (a stock character in Asian Dramas), confusion abound, and overall, I definitely give this five stars. It is worth a watch.

8571293,3,B00BN10WYO,"An ok movie that shows what women really want from a guy (someone who can make them laugh and teases them, not someone who treats them with respect and is kind). The main character (i.e. ""homeless dancer"") with long hair was somewhat effeminate, but otherwise likable. Would I watch it again? Only to learn how to tease and make women laugh so they'll fall in love with me.",1481587200,,373,4.5
