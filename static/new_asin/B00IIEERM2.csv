8642310,4,B00IIEERM2,"This is the Real Anzio Battle! is an Original Video Anime, a double-length episode that falls at the end of Episode 7 in the TV series. It's IN JAPANESE. There are NO SUBTITLES. It's still PRETTY GOOD.

First thing I noticed was that it was packaged for the Japanese market. That is to say, no security tags and no impenetrable seals. Break the flimsy plastic wrap and you're in. Additional swag is minimal  a book of screen-shots and tank specs, and another one of character pencil sketches.

Watching it in Japanese without subtitles was fun, and frustrating, because I can only pick up one word in twenty or thirty (OK, forty). On the other hand, this was GaruPan at its finest, and much of it didn't need translating. The one place I missed it most was the meeting between Suzuki Takako (AKA Caeser) the Roman history expert and gunner for the History Clubs Hippo Team and Hina-chan (AKA Carpaccio), a childhood friend with a similar interest in things Italian, now attending Anzio.

I won't go into a lot of detail, because spoilers, but there are some plot elements that I think its OK to talk about: like Yukarin pulling another intelligence mission onto the Italian school ship (based on the never-completed WWII Italian carrier Aquila), and the fact that, this being an Italian school, food plays a big part (Yukarin has a plate of the Anzio Schools idea of omurice  omuspaghetti). Otherwise, much of the first half is a training montage.

The Anzio tanks are typical of the poor-quality systems Italy fielded in WWII, all the more so because Anzios finances are in a typically Italianate state of disrepair. Their big gun tank is a Carro Armato P-40 (75mm gun), equivalent to the PzKwIV, purchased with their lunch money; they have several M41/Semovente 75/18 self-propelled guns, equivalent to the Hippo Teams STUG III with Caesers friend Carpaccio as the gunner for one of them; and a bunch of cute little CV33s, more properly called tankettes.

On the Oarai side we only have the original five tank teams  we see the Porsche-Tiger being overhauled, and the Hall Monitors have only just signed up.

The battle starts with a [redacted] surprise, and soon breaks up into a running fight between the P40 and PzKwIV, a slugfest between Caeser and Carpaccio in their self propelled guns, and everybody else and all the CV33s that are scampering around like well-armed mice. Its exciting and hilarious at the same time. It ends with a re-enactment of the closing scene from Episode 7, after which theres a party. And after the final credits, which for once include the opponents tanks and not the Oarai tanks, we find out why Duce Anchovy didn't show up in Episode 11 to congratulate the Oarais.

This OVA was a little more cartoony than the standard episodes  the Ducks pick off CV33s running along a ridge like they were targets in a shooting gallery; the CV33s keep flipping over and over and ending right side up, the two SPG's spend as much time ramming each other as they do shooting. Since it doesnt mean much if you haven't seen the original anime, I think all of this was the production team having fun and dropping in in-jokes and playing off tropes. They skimped a little on the animation, but not where it counted. So, the food scenes were mostly stills, and in one shot of the Rabbit Team zig-zagging it was just the girls heads that moved. On the other hand, all the combat was animated with the same loving skill as the original anime.

Extras include a discussion of Italian tanks by Yukarin and Anchovy (in Japanese, follow along with the pictures), and coverage of a couple of the Oarai GaruPan festivals, including appearances by some of the Seiys (which end up looking about as inane as those things usually are).

If you're a GaruPan fan, its worth spending the Japanese import price and putting up with the lack of english. Maybe you only get half of whats going on, but with GaruPan, thats still 10% more entertainment than any other anime will give you. If I could understand what they were saying, I'm sure I'd give it five stars",1423008000,6,4060,4.701408450704226
