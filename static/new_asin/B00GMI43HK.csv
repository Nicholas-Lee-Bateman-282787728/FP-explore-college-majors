Basically, you get an introduction to the DC Training System, then Jason Wojo along with his workout partner show you, IN THE GYM, how to workout to get maximum muscle building effect.  They show you 2 different workout programs that you alternate for maximum benefit.  They also talk about nutrition because it's a huge part of any workout program.  They don't add fluff and give you exactly what you need.

One cool thing I found is the little TWEAKS they show you within the workouts like the explosive stretches that play huge part in the success of building muscle.  Also, how you should hold the barbells, how to push properly, time intervals, etc.  I think that's the stuff that makes this a good program, those little bodybuilding trade SECRETS they talk about throughout the DVD.

One last thing, I did some research and here's what I found out about Jason Wojo which is another reason why I bought this DVD over someone else:

-  He's a professional bodybuilder.  Hell, if I'm going to learn how to build a muscle, mind as well be from a PRO. Btw, the program works for us regular guys too.  I think he started as a skinny guy :)
-  He's a former junior USA Champion.
- He's got a university degrees in Exercise, nutrition and a PHD in Immunology, I think.  To me, that means he knows how human body works and responds to exercise.

Did it work for me?

So far so good.  I have to honestly say that after trying different programs, this is the ONLY one that worked for me and I actually saw results.  Not only did I see change in the way I look (bigger biceps and my chest started to show better) but I got stronger too! And that's after few weeks.

Grant it, you bust your butt in the gym but it's well worth it!  Oh, yeah, you BUST your butt.  But you get results too!

And having a girl do a double take is a plus too :)

Hope this helps.",1393891200,,2064,4.230769230769231
8624604,5,B00GMI43HK,"This is truly a one-of-a-kind video on one of the most innovative and effective training programs out there.  I've been weightlifting consistently for more than two decades and I've suffered through several rounds of competition prep, numerous training injuries, countless frustrations, and a few surgeries along the way.  I have never been a strong advocate of training videos or a subscriber to the latest and greatest training fads.  But this video combines the in-the-trenches experiences of a national level bodybuilder with a revolutionary training program that can help even the most seasoned weightlifters push through the most stubborn plateaus.  Highly recommended for anyone who is interested in getting more out of their time in and around the gym, with faster progress and better results!",1393200000,,801,5.435483870967742
