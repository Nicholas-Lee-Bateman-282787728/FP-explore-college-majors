2835131,1,B000QBYD5Q,"I'm a huge Voltron fan from way back.  I loved this comic book when it came out and was dissapointed that it ended before it's time.  Now, for the review.  Ever wonder why there aren't more comics turned into DVD versions?  Yeah, that's cause it kind of sucks.  Yeah, it's nice to hear all the sounds and music.  But it's just the art from the comic manipulated to give a sense of animation.  Lips don't move which is a little disorienting since you almost think people are talking in an inner monologue.

If you love the comic, just read the comic.  The music and sound fx in your head will be way better than anything on this disc.",1187827200,36,633,4.296610169491525
2835132,5,B000QBYD5Q,My kids loved the DVD!  The artwork is great and kept their attention.  They want to watch it over and over.,1187308800,3,108,4.095238095238095
2835133,1,B000QBYD5Q,"According to the website for Eagle One Media, the maker of this product, the company is a well known producer of video comics. That is comics shot to be played on a DVD format. That being the case, i wonder if that's what this product will turn out to be, as it is based on a series of Voltron produced comics going by the same name,'Revelations.' The website indicates that the product includes sound effects and actors' voices, which means, even if it is a video comic and not a feature-film animation, it will still, nonetheless have the feel of an animated feature film. I think potential buyers should be aware that is may not be an animated feature and bears no relation to the original makers, producers, etc. or the original Voltron cartoon series.",1180569600,22,756,4.607407407407408
2835134,5,B000QBYD5Q,"if you love Voltron then the more you own the better off you are.

I just want them to hurry up with the last two lion sets the red one and then the black one. I am not sure what the black one will look like but i bet it will look cool.

a must own for everyone",1179878400,3,261,3.4827586206896552
8195390,3,B000QBYD5Q,"My fault, but if you are looking for a new Voltron cartoon, this is not it. it is a comic books set to a DVD, interesting but a little let down. Nice story, just wish it was an actual cartoon.",1392940800,,192,3.825
8195391,4,B000QBYD5Q,Needless to say this is a Very motion Comic  I love the Format.  I am a huge fan of animation in almost any form.,1386115200,,113,3.6666666666666665
8195392,5,B000QBYD5Q,"This was my favorite cartoon back in the day so i had to get these when I saw them on sale.  The cases are nice and well constructed, the quality of the DVD is great on my 61"" TV and I can now watch good ole Voltron whenever I want!",1356480000,,232,3.64
8195393,3,B000QBYD5Q,It's the follow up to Paradise. Again it's comic anamation. Like the golden book videos of the 70's & 80's. Still pictures with naration basicly. Still an interresting prequel story.,1355270400,,182,5.1
8195394,1,B000QBYD5Q,"In case you havn't gotton it.
This is not the voltron you saw on TV.",1269648000,2,68,3.6
8195395,1,B000QBYD5Q,"Avoid this at all cost. For what I paid to get a bunch of images with lousy voice acting turned out to be an unwise purchase. I like Voltron and never really had any of it's movies. I may have recorded some of the tv shows back in the day but this was my first purchase and I'm writing this to warn all of you that it's bad. Real bad. I don't even think it deserves 1 star. No real animation, like the description says, it's called comics animation. It's where the images you would see in a comic book is moving some but there is no motion within the subjects of the film. But what makes this title even worse is the acting. Sounds like 1 person is voicing 3 of the characters (maybe more) and not doing a good job at it. Don't waste your money...or time. This is the first time I ever bought a DVD and trashed it right after watching.",1250899200,9,835,4.066666666666666
8195396,1,B000QBYD5Q,"had i know it was a comic read to you, i would not have bought both new one that came out,, DO NOT BUY,, ITS A RIP OFF,, NOT WORTH A PENNY!!!!!!!!!!!",1242950400,3,149,3.6875
8195397,1,B000QBYD5Q,"This is NOT something I would even give to my enemies.
Sound is very bad.
It is a comic book style video. No movement at all from any action and the voices are off.
At times, the color fades in and out.
Each chapter is displayed further ruining the movie.
This gives Voltron a bad rep.
You'r better off buying the indivual seasons.
I would not reccomend this dvd to anyone!
It should be yanked off the shelves.",1204848000,8,410,4.269230769230769
8195398,2,B000QBYD5Q,"This product is an animated comic book.  It is just the images of the comics that were sold on store shelves.  It did not say that in the format, and that was frustrating when recieving the DVD as it were.  In the format, on the initial description it should have said Animated comic book, or digital comic book.  So that others know that it was not a motion picture.  Thank you.",1199577600,16,379,4.28169014084507
8195399,1,B000QBYD5Q,"This is a horrible adaptation of a comic book to the small screen.  Seriously, by the comic version!",1188518400,5,100,4.555555555555555
