2603456,5,B000GAKPYU,"Don't let the fact that it has pictures on the front now fool you. This is the same minimalist DVD Vos has been selling on his website and at appearances for over a year. Many comics might want to hire some people to do a multi-camera shoot at large theater gig in order to give some sort of illusion of success or compotence, but not Rich Vos! This is basically recorded off the monitor at the Stress Factory, a small (but great) club in New Brunswick, NJ. There is no fanfare, no extras, no backstage interviews.

But you know what? That's just the Rich Vos experience. He's not a bright guy, and he doesn't know any better. You're better off cutting right to the chase. He is a pisser on stage. He bangs out a great set, he's in his element on home turf and killing. And that's the important thing.

Vos is a guy who does one thing, and only one thing right. In life and on his DVD. If you're looking at this you came to see some good stand up, and that's exactly what you'll get. It captures the experience of sitting in a club and watching him work. And nothing else.",1159401600,11,1072,4.224390243902439
2603457,5,B000GAKPYU,"Not since Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory has an orange colored dwarf been so entertaining. While he doesn't sing, his act will make you laugh. The only pity is that his professor-loving wife doesn't also make an appearance on the DVD.",1156896000,9,241,4.761904761904762
8129929,5,B000GAKPYU,"Vos is one of the funniest comedians around, and an NJ staple.  I give this 5 stars because I already love Vos.  If you haven't seen him live before, get this AFTER you see him live.  To be quite fair, his scripted comedy is okay, but not great.  But he's FANTASTIC at working off of the audience, and usually spends a good portion of his show doing so.  He is funny, and very witty.  One of the few comics that can be witty without having to be smart!",1434067200,,452,4.079545454545454
8129930,5,B000GAKPYU,It's like staring directly into the sun. It makes the eyes hurt. Reminds me of  Mr Ed reruns when he talks.,1384732800,,107,4.095238095238095
8129931,5,B000GAKPYU,"This is an hour long show, but about 15 minutes was blah.  Otherwise, so funny.  I'm surprised this hasn't had more reviews.",1369785600,,124,4.590909090909091
8129932,5,B000GAKPYU,"one of the funniest comedians out there. very funny dvd, you will love it. if you are a fan of comedy, this is a must have. Rich Vos is even funnier as guest on opie and anthonys xm radio show where he shows off his real improv talent by delivering quick one-liners. if you can tollerate his down syndrome like lisp then you will really enjoy this dvd.  he may be borderline retarded but he can still entertain a crowd better than most.",1208995200,,436,4.253012048192771
8129933,4,B000GAKPYU,"Vos or ""Ole Doll Hands"" as he is called by people in the know, put out a wonderful dvd.  He really is a very funny comic who is often underrated and overlooked.",1201392000,2,160,4.0
8129934,5,B000GAKPYU,One of the best stand-up comics out there.  This DVD was great!  I laughed through the whole thing.  Well worth the money!!,1192838400,2,123,4.5
8129935,5,B000GAKPYU,"I met Rich Vos in Vegas and found him to be one of the coolest of all successful comedians. He is down to earth and truly respectful to his fans. He may be an idiot with a poor vocabulary on the O & A show, but I'm sure that's all just a comedic setup for the boys...at least that's what he said. Seriously, I bought the DVD that night and then lost it somewhere in a drunken blur in vegas, but I don't mind. It was a worthy donation. Buy the DVD, and catch his act live on the O & A Traveling Virus tour. And then be sure to check out [...] for some real entertainment.",1185321600,,570,3.8803418803418803
8129936,5,B000GAKPYU,"Rich Vos. Arguably one of the worlds biggest failures in life, managed to put out this extremely funny DVD. It amazes me that a guy with the intelligence of a wet sock can be so funny. But it is great, so I would recommend that you pick it up if you like to laugh.

Also, watch a ""comedian"" who looks like a fat Nepalese lesbian (Bob Kelly) break Rich's arm on youtube. Just search rich vos birthday and strap in kids!",1183593600,4,418,4.160493827160494
8129937,5,B000GAKPYU,"I checked out Vos at his performance today. He was funny on stage. After that he went to hang out at the bar and I approached him with an intent o buy this DVD (the version he had didn't have a front picture). I approached him in my character, and oh boy, did I discover something or what? He doesn't like to be challenged at improv, at least with me. Did he feel that my character is potent enough to break his confidence? For some reason he thought that my accent hails from Israel, and he started playing games with me telling me to pay in shekels (Israeli currency), I played along, but he refused to sell the DVD. I felt that he was intimidated by the challenge I brought upon him. He did play along but defensibly. I left the conversation because I had to go pickup groceries, and when I did I found 5 shekels in my pocket, since I came from a trip to Israel recently. So I headed to the place and saw the audience outside, some willing to buy the DVD, I reached out to him to give him that 5 shekels, saying ""I brought you some shekels"". To which he replied, ""Get away from me, I am serious now, I am doing business"", as he tried to balance a stack of DVD's leaning on his chest as he was receiving money from an interested customer. All that looked so funny, if one can only imagine :). I turned around and left. This was the upclose and personal with Rich Vos.",1180051200,3,1369,4.150375939849624
8129938,5,B000GAKPYU,This is a must have for any Rich Vos fan.  Rich is a great comdian and a real decent guy.  I am a die hard fan of the Opie and Anthony Show on XM and love Rich Vos when he is on.  I go to all his shows in the PA and NJ area. Rich is always hanging out after the show with his fans unlike some other comdians.  I recommend this DVD and if possible go to his show when he comes to your area.  You won't regret it!,1160352000,4,411,3.522222222222222
