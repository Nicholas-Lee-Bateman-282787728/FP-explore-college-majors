8643281,4,B00ILJKJ80,"It's hard to ruin a gorgeous piece of music like the Bruckner Seventh, although Daniel Barenboim made a good stab at it in his 1992 recording with the Berlin Philharmonic for Teldec. Fortunately, the concert documented on this Blu-ray with the Staatskapelle Berlin at the Philharmonie Berlin on June 25, 2010, marks a considerable upgrade. With a few reservations that rein in a wholehearted endorsement, Barenboim and his orchestra from the Deutsche Oper present an uplifting experience from that week in 2010 when Bruckner's last six symphonies were performed on consecutive nights, displaying the Seventh Symphony's beautifully blended colors.

The booklet says the edition being used is the ""original version."" Judging by a reproduction of the title page of Guttman's 1885 score, that means the first published edition, but in his abruckner.com website discography, John F. Berky identifies Barenboim's as the 1954 Nowak edition. Berky also says Eugene Jochum's 1964 Deutsche Grammophon recording with the Berlin Philharmonic is the Guttman edition, even though the disc says it's Nowak. Truth is, Guttman and Nowak are nearly identical, and almost every conductor makes his or her own modifications to whichever edition is primarily employed. For instance, the first horn in both Guttman and Nowak has a pickup note at the very end of the introduction right before Letter A. Letter A arrives at 2:30 in this recording with no pickup note. You'll hear it in Jochum and also in older recordings such as Furtwngler and Hornstein, but not in more recent ones labeled Nowak.

The major difference most listeners will want to know is whether a performing version has the cymbal crash, triangle, and timpani at the climax of the Adagio that Haas cut from his 1944 edition. Barenboim includes them. (Recordings by Karajan and Thielemann are labeled as being the Haas edition but, in an odd contradiction, incorporate those percussion instruments nevertheless. Some recordings avoid the issue by not naming any edition at all.)

After Barenboim takes his place on the podium, the camera zooms in on one violin, which begins the Allegro moderato's opening tremolo with such a deft touch that we cannot tell precisely when silence turns to sound. Then the camera shifts to the cellos, placed center-left next to the first violins, as that section sings out the seven-note theme -- backed by a solo horn -- that forms the germ of the entire symphony. Following that theme's initial statement, the horn is replaced by warm violas who join the cellos, next to whom they are seated, to continue the first theme in a rich fusion of tones. It's so simple ... and so breathtaking.

Barenboim lets the music unfold naturally, flowing without effort. The gentle second theme at Letter B (3:49) is the first of many variations of the opening motif, as is the third theme at Letter E (6:57), before which Barenboim effectively realizes the two-measue ritenuto. Felicities  abound, from conductor and performers and sound engineers and camera operators. Barnboim's rubato is never distracting, his tempo fluctuations don't sound out of place or call attention to themselves. When the second violins take over the lead with the first theme at Letter N (12:45), the camera catches the advantages of Barenboim's dividing violins left and right. At measure 307 (14:53), the second flute enters a beat early, but such minor slips happen in live performance. The horn section acquits itself admirably throughout.

When we arrive at the first part of the 53-measure coda at Letter W (18:36), ""Sehr feierlich"" (very solemn), the camera focuses on Barenboim's baton as he marks a full measure with only basses and timpani sustaining a note almost too softly to be heard, then strings begin a nine-measure crescendo that peaks fortissimo with cellos and violas at measure 400 (19:22) and violins at measure 401, before sinking back down in a gradual diminuendo to the second section of the coda at Letter X (20:17), ""Sehr ruhig"" (very quiet). From here, Barenboim facilitates one of the magic moments of symphonic literature as the movement's opening theme gradually rises over the last 31 measures to a ringing fortississimo for full orchestra that leaves us on dizzying heights.

How to follow such glory? With the most magnificent symphonic Adagio written since the Beethoven Ninth, which Barenboim and his musicians deliver in full measure. The first movement opens with cellos and horn; the Adagio opens with violas and a quartet of Wagner tubas, or tenor tubas as they're called in the score, supplying subtle shades of coloration, blends of caramel and dark chocolate, with a sophistication that belies the image of Bruckner as some sort of naive village peasant and demonstrates his underrated powers of orchestration.

The cameras in the Philharmonie provide excellent views of the tenor tubas at work, and audio engineers capture all the sound in wonderful DTS 5.1 on this Blu-ray. The first three and a half measures offer another variation of the symphony's opening theme -- the shape of the phrase on the page is obvious -- and lead into three emphatic chords in the strings that express a deep spiritual longing. That same phrase occurs in the final section of Bruckner's Te Deum, at the Latin ""non confundar in aeternum"" (""let me not be confounded for eternity,"" or ""let me never be dismayed""). The liner notes repeat the common misconception that the Seventh was composed after the Te Deum and that this passage in the symphony is thus a quotation from the choral work. The actual chronology is a bit more complicated. Bruckner wrote a draft of the Te Deum in May 1881 but stopped short of the closing fugue in which the ""non confundar"" theme occurs. He set aside the Te Deum to begin the Seventh Symphony, which he finished in September 1883, then completed the Te Deum. Whether the symphony quotes the Te Deum or the Te Deum quotes the symphony might be impossible to determine.

The tenor tubas play a lovely chorale at three measures after Letter C (25:58) before Barenboim directs a gentle entry into the heavenly second theme at Letter D (26:18). The first theme returns at Letter G (29:10) and undergoes much elaboration, including the surprising and exotic change of key at Letter K (31:38). Violas and second violins take over the leading voice as the second theme returns at Letter P (34:29), moving toward the tenor tubas' broad statement of the ""non confundar"" phrase at Letter S (36:24). In the following pages, as the orchestral volume swells in the throes of an overwhelming question, that phrase undergoes a subtle transformation, from the fearful plea, ""Let me not be dismayed,"" toward the assertion, ""I will not be dismayed,"" until one measure before Letter W (39:07) an ecstatic fortississimo is reached, crowned by the massive cymbal crash at Letter W (39:11), accompanied by triangle and crashing timpani.

It's a moment of exaltation worth experiencing with both eyes and ears.

And then Barenboim does something remarkable. At the volume's sustained peak, he throws open the orchestra to timpanist Torsten Schenfeld. I can't imagine Karajan relinquishing control like that. But Barenboim's placing his faith in Schenfeld's hands is well justified. If I were in that orchestra, I would be hearing him, feeling the vibrations of those timpani he's pounding, instead of looking at Barenboim in this section anyway. And Schenfeld is a total joy to watch. Percussionist and self-appointed critic-of-all-music-classical David Hurwitz says only brass players enjoy performing Bruckner. Ask Schenfeld about that.

That cymbal crash comes halfway through the symphony, both in the pages of the score and in performance time, one indication that Bruckner is more attentive to overall structure than he's often given credit for. The denouement after this climax might be even more beautiful that the music that has preceded it, featuring as it does the tenor tubas and horns in intimately tender interplay. Good camera work here is an added asset. The Staatskapelle Berlin's horns are magnificent after measure 190 just before Letter Y (40:43), as are the tenor tubas at Letter Z (42:13), before they join together with the horns at 42:37 to bring this noble Adagio to a close.

After these two mighty movements, a lot of listeners lose interest. Partly that's because many conductors allow the Scherzo and Finale to run down into a routine jog to the finish. Barenboim's Scherzo threatens to be the ruin of this concert. Bruckner's marking is ""Sehr schnell"" (very fast) -- ""sehr"" being German's strongest intensifier for ""schnell."" As far as I know, this is the only place where that instruction appears in Bruckner's work, and he also specified to conductor Felix Mottl his insistence on a fast tempo here. Of course, ""fast"" and ""slow"" are relative terms, and comparing times among different recordings is complicated. Some timings include the silence before the Finale begins; plus, few conductors observe the full three and two-thirds measures of quiet before and after the Trio. Look at older recordings -- by Oscar Fried, van Beinum, Schuricht -- and you see Scherzos under nine minutes. Hornstein in his 1928 recording takes from 9:16 to 9:28, depending on who's counting.

Barenboim's 10:32 goes too slowly, especially considering he pauses only a second or two before and after the Trio. That Trio is where this performance really sags. Bruckner's indication is ""Etwas langsamer"" -- a little slower, not ""at a crawl."" Ironically, Barenboim becomes more animated in this movement, embarrassingly so at one point in the Scherzo's repeat. At measure 196 (52:56), he gives the wrong cue to the trumpets, pointing upward when the musical line goes down. The orchestra plays fine, though, particularly timpanist Schenfeld, who has the perfect touch at the Trio's beginning.

The Finale is when audience members often start sneaking for the exits. This is no mighty apocalypse such as the Bruckner Fifth and Eighth offer, and too many conductors dash it off as inconsequential. After Barenboim's weak Scherzo, I was pleasantly surprised to meet the best Finale I've ever heard. Under Barenboim's direction, the movement becomes a dance of celebration, cosmic play rather than cosmic apotheosis. That's not the destination we might expect, but it's where the triumph of the mighty Adagio -- ""I refuse to submit to despair"" -- has been leading us.

The Finale's first theme is another variant of the symphony's opening motif, and the ""walking bass"" accompanying the second subject at Letter C (55:18) is delightful. It's the marcato third theme at Letter F that often sounds ugly, like the heavy trudge of deformed monsters. That's how it comes across on Barenboim's 1992 recording. Here, while remaining emphatic, the theme is presented with a lighter touch that makes it a more natural part of its surroundings, helping the entire movement flow more easily.

Through to the end, orchestral execution remains high. I'd never before noticed how beautiful the flute solo at measure 137 is until I heard it played by Thomas Beyer (59:33). At measure 152 (1:00:05), the tenor tubas recall their chorale from the Adagio, which at measure 159 (1:00:26) merges into the first movement's second theme, as Bruckner further establishes -- or reveals -- in an even less linear fashion than in his Fifth Symphony, the entire symphony's thematic unity.

Barenboim's flexible tempos, the fermata before Letter S (1:10:53) he holds so effectively -- everything aims toward the movement's climax at measure 311 (1:06:07) and the big slowdown immediately afterward at two measures before Letter Z (1:06:25), where the third horn gets a rare solo reprising the Finale's first theme and commences the final coda, which rises from pianissimo over 16 measures to break into -- miracle of miracles -- a triple-forte return of the first movement's glorious coda at measure 331 (1:06:55). For once, this return does not sound like a contrived ""deus ex machina"" ending, but what has in fact been the secret goal all along. As the symphony concludes in a blazing radiance, we might say with T.S. Eliot that we have arrived where we started and know the place for the first time.",1464739200,3,13152,5.333172613307618
8643282,3,B00ILJKJ80,"Unfortunately one of the other reviewers is correct - there is an intermittent video fault with this bluray: the shots of Barenboim often flicker in the background, though with my Oppo player it doesn't happen as often as he seems to suffer it. A pity because the performance and sound are very fine.",1459468800,,300,4.679245283018868
8643283,2,B00ILJKJ80,"This is an awesome blu-ray, great music, wonderful performance, BUT with a fatal flaw!  I bought Symphony No. 6 in this series and loved it!
Loved it so much I ordered Nos. 5, 7, 8, and 9 to get all the Mature Bruckner Symphonies.  No. 5 is great like No. 6.  BUT Nos. 7,8 and 9 have a miserable video fault that is intermittent.  It looks like the picture goes all herringbone, checked, overlaying the whole screen sometimes or just the background behind conductor Barenboim.  Sometimes it is there, then a great picture quality for a while (a min. or 3) then it will come back for a few seconds or a min.  I thought for a while it might be my equipment, but it is repeatable every time, the video messes up at the same places every time and often.
The audio quality is AWESOME and just makes you love having these performances.  AND the picture quality is OFTEN so great you can see everything, Mr. Barenboim, comb your hair!!!  Sorry, joking, he is a MASTER!!!!!  Conducts each and every symphony from start to finish by memory!!!!!  No sheet music for this genius conductor.
These blu-rays are ruined for me, so I tried to return them, but I am an overseas customer, half-way around the world, and Amazon's return policy from overseas REALLY SUCKS now, so I am stuck with them.  AND I figure even a replacement disc will be defective too.  Only you will know, I will not find out.
I hope this helps somebody out there.
God Bless, Wayne",1445212800,,1439,4.450381679389313
8643284,3,B00ILJKJ80,"When the first in this series appeared (4th symphony), I complained about the ratio of cost to timed content. It was advertised for $36. Eventually, market forces prevailed, and you could get it on Amazon Marketplace for around $20

The next two (symphonies 5 & 6) came in at $25 (Amazon sold these for $22, less on Marketplace.) Great value, great performances. Now here we go again with a $40 MSRP and Amazon selling for $35.for Symphony #7. Even Marketplace wants $30!

Why this inconsistency? To be clear, this is a very good cycle, with only #8 & 9 left to release.

You can get other #7's a lot less expensively - Thielemann and Welser-Most, both on Bluray for around $20.

I'd love to buy this disc, and look forward to reading the reviews from buyers who didn't mind paying 50% more then they should have.. Ah well - I'll just have to wait 'til its price drops. It's a shame, because Accentus is cheating itself out of a lot of sales with its pricing inconsistencies.",1399075200,4,975,4.5227272727272725
