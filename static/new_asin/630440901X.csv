I saw so many movies back then. Even adult films. ( I don't mean porns. Porns are prohobited in Korea).
There I saw this film NO COMPROMISE(KOREAN TITLE: POLICEMAN).
Then I had a chance to get a VHS tape.  And for some strange reason I forgot that tape.
Now I searched every site and finally got this really rare dvd from amazon.
This movie is not like one of those gangster legend <THE KILLER> or <A BETTER TOMORROW >.
This is a real life serious cop movie dealing with one side: a cop who is dedicated to searching for the criminal who robbed the bank. Husband and wife who is pregnant and about to have a baby.. On the other side: the criminal husband and wife desperate to run away and deliver the baby.
Now sometimes we cannot avoid but to stand on the criminal side because the director make us do so. We kind of support thath the husband and wife should be safe from cops because they are in a really bad situation bleeding to death. Husband is injured bad and wife is bleeding after the birth.
The tension made me very interesting and that made me searching for this dvd.
I really kind of pity on the husband an wife side although they are criminal.
But also the cop is a well known actor, a star actor who played the part at the movie <THE KILLER> as a cop.
So the thing is I couldn't hate both sides.
That was the main reason I liked this film.
Also the strong back ground music made this movie serious too.
When the last scene where the husband kidnapped the cop's child and the cop succeeded to kill the husband, that moment was not all relieved.
There is also pity that the husbad died.
This movie is well script and I think it deserves a good apploud in many ways.
But the sad thing is it is such a rare movie to find.
You will be lucky if you can find this film in a illegal download site.",1453507200,,1991,4.195822454308094
