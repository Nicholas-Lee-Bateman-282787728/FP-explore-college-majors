3589722,5,B001G0H2QI,"A truly delicious Can-Am documentary.  Top notch in content, presentation, as well as Pete Lyons narration. Vintage footage abounds and is interspersed with modern day footage shot at several vintage race venues. The film moves through a fairly chronological order of the racing and then moves into a more in-depth dissection of each car. Several of the eras drivers participate in modern day interviews. An added bonus is a lengthy interview with Can-Am builder Peter Bryant which is captivating for the hard core race fan as well as the newcomer. Brief biographies of some of the top names of Can-Am also abound.

This DVD is a must have for Can-Am or road racing fans. It is more than capable on its own, giving insight and a historical revisit of the glory years of road racing, but also is an excellent companion to Pete Lyons book `Can-Am' .",1245369600,15,847,4.755102040816326
3589723,4,B001G0H2QI,"Not as good as I was hoping for.  I saw one race at Road America and never forgot how awesome these cars looked, sounded and performed.  I wanted the dvd to show more closeups of the cars to see the details and hear some of the thunder I remember from those monster engines.  You may still enjoy this DVD.  NOTE (next day):  This is a better DVD than I originally thought.  I've increased it to 4 stars because as I watched it a second time (without just previewing it)  I found a lot more of what I wanted to see & hear.  I doubt anything better is available.  If you know of something you like better, please advise.",1484006400,,618,4.169491525423729

3589725,4,B001G0H2QI,"Synopsis of the fantastic and brief lived CAN-AM series races and the its various racing teams from 1966 to 1974. The only truly unlimited race car category where, the McLaren M8 with a GM 520 cu.in. engine, with almost 1,000 HP, reigned supreme, reaching speeds in excess of 220 MPH at road courses more than 40 years ago!",1475020800,2,323,4.586206896551724

3589729,5,B001G0H2QI,Amazing!! I loved every thrilling second of it. Video and audio are awesome. The best I've ever seen and makes up for all of the poor attempts made by others at making such racing film documentaries. It truly displays how amazing these cars were.,1457308800,,246,4.613636363636363
3589730,5,B001G0H2QI,Great video that is pretty informative. The video is not high definition but that is due to the original recordings not being high definition to begin with. I enjoyed this video immensely and would highly recommend it to anyone who remembers these cars and drivers.,1447632000,,265,4.911111111111111
3589731,3,B001G0H2QI,It was fun to see the old cars. Would have liked more old film clips of races. On and all a good way to be introduced to the old Can Am series.,1445126400,,143,3.5
3589732,4,B001G0H2QI,"Bought it because I was able to attend several

3589734,5,B001G0H2QI,"If you live through those days of ""The Great Bruce & Denny Circus"" at CAN-AM, this is a must have - great reliving the past excitement and certainly a great DVD to keep in one's own private stock of ""DVDs That Was Part of My Life's Interest"". Pete Lyons also wrote some great books (especially on McLaren) to add to one's collection",1432166400,6,332,4.370967741935484

Tried in two separate players that play other Dvd's without issue.
Had to assign one star to get review to post -- reality at this point is zero.

3589740,4,B001G0H2QI,"Amazing footage of can-am racing.  It's difficult to find as much footage in one place!  A few minor gripes: The majority of the footage came from 2-3 events.  I would've liked to have seen more variety.  Also, the format was very straightforward, going through each car or team one at a time instead of telling an overall story of can-am.  Still a great DVD.",1423094400,,359,4.546875
3589741,5,B001G0H2QI,"excellent video, I am a fan of the can-am series, I only wish it did not change as it did. Those cars were awesome, in power, and looks, especially the Jim Hall Chaparrals.

3589743,2,B001G0H2QI,"If you want details of the cars get this. If you want to see racing excitement, don't. It has very little actual race footage and the whole DVD is about as exciting as watching grass grow. I had expected to relive the races of my youth but was very disappointed.",1412208000,2,262,4.26

3589746,5,B001G0H2QI,"Big blocks and even bigger balls. You can see all the greats in this video, an essential addition to any gearhead's library.  Get the CAN-AM The Speed Odyssey with this and it will round out your love for CAN-AM.  This is a different format than The Speed Odyssey.  With DVD chapter titles like, the roots of can-am, penske, mclaren and cooper, carroll shelby's ""king cobras"", lotus v8 sports racers, early days of chaparral and the can-am kicks off and with Pete Lyons narrating and a CAN-AM panel of the the men who drove these beasts, you will definitely get an idea of what CAN-AM was all about and why we should bring it back.  The DVD also goes discusses the different vehicles from BRM to the Shadow and everything in between.  Turn it up!",1407542400,2,746,4.537313432835821
3589747,4,B001G0H2QI,"This Can-Am DVD is more informative than the ""Speed Odyssey"". There's not as much footage as ""Speed Odyssey"" but the interviews were quite interesting.",1403049600,,151,5.333333333333333

3589749,5,B001G0H2QI,Great footage of the Can-Am of the races.  Also great commentary by drivers and owners.  Another great DVD is the  Legends of Can Am which would be a good companion to this.,1388361600,,173,4.34375
3589750,3,B001G0H2QI,"Besides getting way too much of Pete Lyons, the rest of the video was fair.  Way too much current footage of cars at Laguna Seca, and much of the period footage is poor.  A few interesting insights from participants from back in the day.",1299801600,,237,4.363636363636363
3589751,3,B001G0H2QI,"It's a pretty good video content-wise, but the production quality is horrible. The historical footage, and even much of the recent footage was mastered at incredibly low resolution. Only the narrator and other indoor shots have full dvd resolution. All the other footage is painful to watch due to the pixellation and lack of detail. Come on, guys...",1285891200,,350,5.051724137931035
3589752,5,B001G0H2QI,"For us babyboomers who followed Pete Lyons from afar in Autosport in the 70 s, this brought it all home!  The sight of the original shadow going round Leguna Seca (still overheating) and then hearing Vic Elford & Goerge Follmer admitting they mad enough too drive it was priceless.  What moteracing was like before computers!  When drivers were not trained by image consultants to say the right thing!  This is a great insight to racing in the 70's",1262822400,8,448,4.705128205128205
8303252,5,B001G0H2QI,"I have been following sports car racing for many years and the Can-Am series is and will always be my favorite.  I have seen every Can-Am held at Road America in Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin and watching this DVD brought back all the excitement of those days.  You could almost smell the exhaust and burning rubber, and could almost hear the roar of those big-block engines, and could almost feel the ground tremble and your pant legs slapping against your legs as they roared past you at speed.  To anyone who has experienced a Can-Am race and would like to relive that feeling, I heartily recommend this DVD, it is well worth the money.  Kudos to Pete Lyons as the narrator and to the many Can-Am drivers who appeared in this DVD.",1524096000,,727,4.526717557251908

8303257,1,B001G0H2QI,"The Amazon-Duke tragedy does not let up. Here is what could have been and what should have been an outstanding documentary, the ONLY good VIDEO -- and excellent in that regard -- of this most amazing sports car racing series unlike any before, then, now, or likely ever -- yet Duke and Amazon can't get copies pressed with decent audio. And they are only too willing to offer you the gagged and choked versions, probably having bought a ton of product locked in by a ""do not return for credit"" arrangement. So we and history should suffer because Mr. Dukie and Bezos Boy don't yet know how to market their wares?  Hurray for the visual aspect of this DVD, but mourn a total failure if you want to actually hear the deep, throttled roar of these unlimited displacement motors ranging to more than ONE THOUSAND horsepower. You might even want to pick up on a bit of the narration, interviews, etc. Very famous and deservedly so racers have something to say to you, but forget about your efforts, as they say in Hawai`i, ""to try listen"". I returned one unintelligible DVD from whence it came to Duke directly, politely asking for a swap for something that might be heard, and have been completely met with more silence as -- Blimey! I am being ignored!  Still am. Definitely not at British way. (Remember the correct spelling of A-S-S is the same for them as in the States.)  Really wanting a decent copy, I bought again, this time from Amazon which -- as usual, always seeking to mollify its public -- made a quick replacement for the coffin-appropriate copy, but when only the same dull whispering could emanate and I sought yet another swap, guess what? A further substitution was NOT permitted. You get in line for a refund only.  But we don't want your damn refunds! We want this DVD at a sound level that will shake the neighbors into frantic activity, thinking alien space heroes are descending in their Cosmic War Racers.  I am told what needs to be done is taking the original file and re-recording with proper sound levels and a sound person who knows what is up. Or maybe how to train decibels. It's not rocket science. It's keeping your eye on a needle. But no one did, or the pressing itself was dead. So order here and you will spend $15 - $25 for basically a silent movie. And these are the most powerful, fastest, most radical and LOUD racing machines ever to turn a wheel on any of God's macadam-gray race tracks. I asked Duke to take on the fix, but they were unmoved by the literally thousands of dollars I have spent over the decades buying their materials featuring this sort of racing, including the 24 Hours of Le Mans -- getting close to a complete set of the annuals, now, in both print and video, along with TT and Moto-GP bikes and all manner of other breath-taking excitement.  Of course, Amazon gets its share and cares as much about the sotto voce -- not at all. My first return was really muffled, with only something like indistinguishable sounds, while for the second, it isn't completely impossible to make out the faintest of exhaust coughing and something pretty near a spoken -- even shouted -- word in English. But why would you want to be so limited? Are you satisfied to go to the movies and bring a folding chair to set up outside? How about your favorite band playing underwater? What a GD treat is that? This is a monstrous injustice to the history of this most supreme auto racing contest of all time. Be on the alert for recreations coming to a track even if not near you -- tens of thousands of spectators turn up to see these things run even when necessarily restrained to some degree. But Duke-Amazon have no excuse to hold back. In doing so, they're guilty of ruining this marvelous, not-going-to-be-a-fair-record of supreme speed, design, color, and courage.

Damn them. And don't buy from them.",1498608000,2,3842,4.575581395348837
