8581880,5,B00CHQS9FS,"Four more half hour shows featuring Ida Lupino on a DVD-R. Sound and Picture okay.  Enjoyed this series more that Vol 1. Programs are:  Masquerade, Eddie`s Place, All My Heart and One Way Out. Cast includes: John Bryant, William Talman, Walter Coy, Edward Platt, Scott Forbes, Frances Robinson, Paul Fix, John Daley, Noreen Nash and Glen Gordon. Vol. one and two are a product of their time and some of the dramas may seem outdated by today`s standards.  Still a great watch for film noir and crime drama fans.",1394064000,3,510,4.707865168539326
