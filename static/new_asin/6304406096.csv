867739,3,6304406096,"Re-tread of Thunderball is actually slower than Thunderball, which is amazing.  Max von Sydow makes an okay Blofeld.  The main villain is actually better than Celi in the original and Connery is his usual great  Bond self.  But movie has a few odd moments, like the video game battle  between Bond and the villain.",940723200,,314,4.7407407407407405
867740,4,6304406096,"Never Say Never Again is essentially a remake of Thunderball.  Same story line, cast names (mostly), same basic idea.  Except truly the films are totally different.  Connery returns as James Bond for the finally time, and  with him he brought a film which has been widely criticized as being a bad  example for a James Bond film.  How can you have a James Bond film without  a James Bond Theme or an opening gun barrel?  They could at least have had  an opening cross hair or a pre-title sequence.  When you look at it, many  consider it an action film starring Sean Connery, whose name happens to be  James Bond.  Never Say Never Again is an interesting film to see,  unfortunately, currently, those who haven't seen it probably won't.
  The history of the film goes back to the 1950's when Bond author Ian  Fleming teamed up with Kevin McClory to work on a screenplay.  The  screenplay never fell through, so Ian Fleming took the ideas from the  screenplay and wrote the novel Thunderball.  Kevin McClory saw a version of  the novel, sued and eventually won the rights to the book.  McClory then  teamed up with Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman to produce the film  Thunderball.  The terms would be that McClory would give up his rights for  10 years and he would then be allowed to remake the film.  18 years later  Never Say Never Again was born
  So that is why Never Say Never Again  is like that.  Why it is so different from the other Bond films.  007 fans  are split in half when it comes to accepting or not accepting it in the  Bond family.  The future of Never Say Never Again lies in the hands of MGM  now.  So it is up to them weather or not it will ever see the light of day  Again.
I ask that MGM strongly look into re-releasing this title.  What  better way to get back at McClory then to make money off of something he  fought so hard to make.
Also Kevin McClory I think you should put to rest  your future Bond plans.  You had your chance to make a Bond film, you did  it, its over.  Stop fighting so hard and enjoy the Bond films that are  coming out.
Come on re-release this title.",940032000,2,2107,4.309278350515464
867902,5,6304406096,"WHY? its an awesome movie, while not an official release under same terms as others its still within 007 canon. Connery and Basinger is all you really need to know.",1519171200,,164,4.5
867903,5,6304406096,Just writing this as a note to others that this Italian version is only labeled as an Italian version on the cover...it plays completely as a standard English version in US players.

867904,4,6304406096,"Sean Connery is back as British Secret Service in this makeover of Thunderball. Thunderball - the basis for this production- was a tough act to improve upon. This movies retains the storyline of stolen warheads and a good deal of great Bahamanian scenery however it adds in a touch of stylised video game arcading that was an obvious attempt to be au courante.  It could have been omitted,  I felt.  What was a bit of un-pc that snuck its way into an otherwise well-known plot were the scenes in Northern Africa. Here 007's lady friend was on the block to be auctioned off as a slave to some males.  This shocking turn of events while terrible is not unheard of even in modern day times for certain areas and religious groups.  This bit of grim realism added something Thunderball lacked as food for thought. In conclusion,  this film has more sidebar subplots, and is heavily stylized,  oh so eighties,  and not as nailbiting as tbe preceding version.  It may not be to everyone's taste.  While worth watching it is a rather grim,  less campy 007 film.",1514332800,,1053,4.60752688172043

867907,3,6304406096,"Despite being a remake of Thunderball, this technically isn't part of the Bond series. This was made at the same time as Octopussy, and came out 4 months after Octo released. IMDB says that the producers won a lawsuit to make this, but the settlement said it had to be a Thunderball remake. Connery was clearly too old when this was made, which is evident by some of the fight scenes. The majority of it is alright, but age doesn't work well with 007. Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson) makes an appearance, which is welcome comedy.",1510876800,2,523,4.515789473684211

868079,1,6304406096,"NSNA is a very odd film. I was anticipating this with great joy for the return of Sean Connery, and then sat through 2 hrs and 14 minutes of this mess, which couldn't quite decide what it wanted to be. Connery's fine as 007, and fits into the role of the aging superspy, who's stuck with working for a new ""M"", who has no regards for the ""Double 0"" agents. Then we get blonde bimbo, Domino, as portrayed by the vapid Kim Basinger, who displays no recognizable personality, other than as a plaything for the movie's psychotic villain, oddly portrayed by Klaus something-or-other. Who cares? The only bright light for me was Barbara Carerra's hilarious turn as Fatima Blush. Rowan Atkinson's doing his ""Johnny English"" bit,which is hilarious in his own movies, but oddly out of place in this film. The worst aspect of the movie is the DREADFUL jazz score by Michel Legrand. What were they thinking? Finally the so-called ""climax"" of the movie is as flat and anti-climatic as can be. I've had better times watching Dean Martin's Matt Helm movies, than this piece of seaweed.",1496275200,,1071,4.702127659574468

868195,5,6304406096,"Great Bond film. Even though Connery is older he still plays the best BOND. Kim Basinger is a great Bond girl and hot as hell. Even though this movie follows the story line of Thunderball, this movie is very different from the original in so many ways. I believe the lack of better characters in the MI6 agency in this movie is due to the competition with the Bond film Octopussy released the same year, Im sure with both films shooting and casting at the same time caused a conflict of characters in these movies. That is why the fantastic Desmond Llewelyn who plays Q is in Octopussy but not Never Say Never Again. But Connery is by far the best Bond, with Roger Moore a very close second, and now Daniel Craig in third.",1492905600,,722,4.355555555555555

868586,2,6304406096,"I did not know about the missing footage on this DVD until I began reading reviews here. I really hate reading about such things!

There should be a law against those who obtain a license to reproduce any such features, from cutting 'anything' out of the original copy.

Also, those who own the original masters, should not license to anyone that doesn't sign a contract stating that the film would be reproduced in it's  original content.

I had seen this numerous times with other films. One particular title being Death Wish 2, (with Charles Bronson). I had discovered that there were 3 different masters floating around of that film.

At one point Orian Pictures had purchased (and owned) that film. When I spoke to them, they did not even know about the other masters out there. What they had purchased was actually a cut and edited master of that film. I never did discover who owned the original uncut, unedited version of the film. And I had never seen that version re-released on DVD. There was controversy over a rape scene in the movie, giving it an 'X'  rating. Actually kind-of tame when compared to what's shown these days!

I was also disappointed that there are no special features included with this Bond film . I own all the James Bond films, beginning with the boxed collection that became available, (that I can write a small essay about itself)! All my other Bond films do have special features.

I think it a real shame that this Bond film isn't recognized as an 'authentic' James Bond film, and included in the boxed collection!

Anyway... All this wasn't the reason I originally came here. I did want to point out that this particular DVD does 'NOT' have English subtitles for the deaf or hard of hearing. There are subtitles in two other languages, but not English.

I came here looking for a different version of this film on DVD, that might have special features included, and English subtitles. But I'm certainly not going to spend $50 for it, (if one even exists)!

If anyone knows of a different version of this film that has special features, and English subtitles, I would appreciate a comment listing it. I do not care if it is a blu-ray or not. None of my Bond collection is in blu-ray.",1475625600,,2220,4.623409669211196

869360,2,6304406096,"As it would seem Mr. Connery again appears as James Bond 007 in 1983. A decent performance, as actors are usually contracted to play the respective roles. In this case Mr. Connery is stuck with a hapless script, and does his best since he has had a lot of practice. The same is true of the rest of the cast and is the movie's saving grace. Comic relief aside, the gadgets needed some punching up as the two agents are shot out of a nuclear sub via nuclear missiles and using rocket packs to glide down to Earth. At least the US and UK agents are working side by side and Alex has James' back. I can't say I liked this one as much as the other Bond movies, because I didn't. I do have the 50th anniversary Blue-Ray set and this film is conspicuously missing. Not many memorable lines in this one like Goldfinger ""No Mr. Bond. I expect you to die!"" Classic. But nothing even remotely like that. I am curious to know why Mr. Connery did this one. However, the motives of the supporting cast are rather transparent, they all expected to be immortalized in an endearing Bond movie we've all come to expect, only to  subjected to a less than mediocre script treatment which is then passed on to the audience, unfortunately. I couldn't tell if this was Mr. Connery's worst outing only because it has been a while since I have Disney's ""Darby O'Gill and the Little People"". In all honesty, Darby was an early effort, but Mr. Connery should have known better at this point in his career. The bright side to this film is that there some Hollywood heavy hitters supporting this one, yet not enough to save it from being less than a 'B' movie. I'm glad I did finally see it, as there other Bond movies I have not seen, like all of the Dalton and Brosnan era ones. I'm in no hurry. Lazenby was a hoot, I need to see that one again as well. Definitely worth a look, by no means will I include this one in my collection..-Troy Lawson",1463961600,4,1918,4.313019390581718

Never Say Never Again  is loads of fun with the usual tongue-in-cheek Bond humor; gadgets galore requiring substantial suspension of disbelief; and bedded, beautiful women. Special effects are not what they are in any recent Bond film, but for their time, pretty cool. My favorites of the cast?

-Basinger is throw down
-Car/motorcycle chase is one of the best ones of the series.
-Fatima Blush -- Barbara Carrera -- is throw down
-Video-gaming to the DEATH!  Where else have you seen that?  Nowhere, that's where

870244,3,6304406096,"While Sean Connery may be the best Bond ever this is definitely not his best Bond film.  Besides the fact that the producers were unable to use the Bond theme or the gun barrel sequence this movie seems like a low budget film and not much of a Bond film.  The Eon made films look sleek, well made, and seem to age very well.  The sequences in this like the bomb hi-jacking and the computer game battle seem to be right out of well exactly where they were the early eighties.  John Barry the composer of most of the official Bond films is very much missed as Michael Legrand's score is probably the worst score for a Bond film ever.  The commentary with Irvin Kershner the director and Bond Historian Steven Jay Rubin is so much of the director recapping what is happening on the screen Rubin doesn't get much chance to speak at all.  Rubin correctly says that the story of this Bond film needs to be told since it does not get the attention that official Bond films get but very little of that gets out.  I enjoyed Rubin;s commentary for the other unofficial Bond film Casino Royale very much so I was eager to listen to this one but was disappointed.  Kevin McClory the man who is probably most responsible for this film being made  is mentioned very little at all I found this astonishing.
The good points of the film the cast.  Sean is back looking better than he did a dozen years earlier in Diamonds are Forever and has good chemistry with his cast mates despite almost everyone being younger than he.  He delivers lines like only he can after being splashed by a girl who proclaims ""I got you all wet"" he replies ""yes but my martinis still dry"" and the aw shucks it was nothing really look after Largo tells him he was a very good secret agent.  Kim Basinger is gorgeus in her younger days I find her underwater scene with her beautiful golden hair glowing a highlight.  Although it stretches the imagination to believe that twenty something Basinger is into fifty something Connery they do seem to have good chemistry together.  Barbarra Carrera is a delight as the villainess and seems to be having a great time playing the sexy lethal assasian.  Her walking throughout the film seems to be very dance-like and her joy when Largo gives her another chance to kill Bond is one of her highlights as is her death scene where she attempts to get Bond to put in writing that she was the greatest pleasure in his life.  Bernie Casey is a very good Felix Leiter maybe the best he and Connery work well together and have a great chemistry its a shame they don't have more scenes together.  I find Klaus Brando a serviceable villain he is best in his slightly physcotic scenes.  While Algernon as the unofficial Q is refreshing the new M and Moneypenny are not.  Moneypenny is not very attractive and has next to no sexual chemistry with 007 and M as an upper crust British prick who has little regard for the aging 007 is different but not very original.  The action scenes are not among the best but the car motorcycle chase is quite well done.  All in all for all the effort that Schwartzman and McClory put into getting this film made the result is not as stunning as one would hope.  For a complete history of the making of this film and the battle McClory waged with Fleming, Broccoli, and their heirs read Seller's Battle for Bond its a must for Bond fans who enjoy behind the scenes history.",1456617600,,3397,4.436392914653784

870375,4,6304406096,"This was the one Bond film I did not have in my collection but Santa was good to me this year.  Enough has been stated already about the film's pluses and minuses, acting, storyline and the myriad opinions about this film that was produced independently of the Broccoli family production crew and that it came out at about the same time as one of the other Bond films from that production company.  The BR I received says it was made in the U.S. and that it is the Collector's Edition.

All my reviews, when it regards Blu Rays, focus solely upon the actual quality the review is just about the quality of the video and audio on BR.
Keep in mind, however, that the quality of what you see and hear is also dependent upon the quality of the TV monitor you are watching on as well as the home theater set up you are using. The monitor I use is a fairly new Panasonic ZT 65"" plasma and the amps, speakers, cables, BluRay player and Surround Processor I use are hi end esoteric gear to provide me with a more realistic and objective perspective.

Video Quality.....
  I do believe that the film was remastered in this edition as a cleaner video reproduction would be hard to find.  Color grading is perfectly natural with normal skin tones and no popping colors.  Small details in skin pores, hair and even in the darker scenes are easily discerned.  I have read other peoples technical reviews and can't say that I really agree with many of them.  At no time did I notice any filmic scratches from an old master recording or any artifacts of any kind.  Nor do I believe that some of the colors were washed out as one reviewer pointed out. Yes, the opening scene does appear to have been taken, perhaps, from another master as it has a darker, oh so very slightly grainy appearance but it was hardly noticeable.  Average Mbps rate is pretty high in the low 40's.
Does the resolution match that of most of today's films? No, but we are looking at a really fine video quality from a film going on its 3rd decade.

AUDIO QUALITY...
  Great that they have transferred the audio to a 5.1 DTS HD MA lossless audio, however, as is often the case with many films, they failed to put time and money into the audio mix.  I do not recall whether the original film was in mono or stereo, my guess is that it was stereo and in some of the music soundtracks you can hear the left and right music mixes but as for the film itself, there was no discernible use of the surrounds, no real panning between front and rear sound stages nor left and right surrounds.  While there is plenty of action in the film, I felt as if I were listening to a mono + mix.  Most of the audio will be coming from your center channel and there was little use of your LFE channel, the low audio end simply did not go that low.  It is because of this lack of any real audio directionality that I took a star off the Blu Ray's rating.

Extras....There were some very interesting extras, shot in 2008 regarding how they recruited Sean Connery for the last time, discussions regarding the courts orders about this film vs Thunderball and a very introspective extra on the women in the film and how they felt about it and their roles.  Interesting to me is that Kim Basinger is the one major female role and that she, who had many on the set issues, was not interviewed for this extra.  There is also the typical director's commentary, photo gallery and trailer.

In summation, despite the lack of audio directionality, this is about the best resolution you will probably find for this film,  No, it is not the best of  the Bond films, nor is it even close to the best, but for completists who want the entire collection, this was a fine offering.

I do hope this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase.

870376,5,6304406096,"Never Say Never Again is a fascinating film, with a very interesting history. The only Bond film made since the series took on iconic status to be made outside of EON Productions (technically, there was another - the goofy 1967 spoof starring David Niven as James Bond, which included Woody Allen in the cast!), which owns the iconic Bond music and other vital elements of the series; this film nonetheless starred the original Bond, Sean Connery, re-making one of his best films - Thunderball. It's fascinating to see where the film remained faithful to the story, and where it departed. It's also interesting to see how the film would fill in the details of the film - who would be cast as M, Q, etc.

Ironically, the film stays true to the ""spa visit"" opener that was included in Thunderball, but for better reasons - Bond is getting old (in the original book, it was to recover from a poisoning at the hands of SPECTRE at the end of From Russia With Love, something that they never included in the film), and there are delicious scenes between Fatima Blush and Jack Petachi that we don't see in the original. Max Von Syndow is quite good as Blofeld. Interestingly, the enemy agency in the film is SPECTRE, which EON had not been allowed to use officially from the time of the original Thunderball in 1965 until just this year, with the release of the inferior SPECTRE. Interesting use of a snake to assassinate a man driving a car. Kim Bassinger is stunning as a dancer (I think that's really her doing all those acrobatics - she'd studied ballet, after all!). The role of M is not filled well, just some twitty bureaucrat played by a stiff Edward Fox (brother of James Fox from Performance, the film that nearly drove the actor mad), but Q's role is played with vigorous humour by Alex McCowan, who gets great lines like ""I hope we're going to have some gratuitous sex and violence."" Klaus Maria Brandauer is decently creepy as Maximillian Largo, Bernie Casey is near-perfect as an African-American Felix Leiter (great idea - and maybe Idris Alba can play him instead of Bond, for those who can't think of a non-white British Bond after Daniel Craig), and Pamela Salem does a pretty good job as Miss Moneypenny. The film is also directed by a pro - Irvin Kershner, best known for directing the best Star Wars film, The Empire Strikes Back. The film was released in the same year as EON's Octopussy, and was successful - although it didn't earn as much as the other ($160 million to Octopussy's $183 million). Love the appearance of Rowan Atkinson (Mr Bean!!) in the film, as a twitty embassy clerk. Many of the crew members had just finished work on Raiders Of The Lost Ark. Steven Segal worked on the film as a fight co-ordinator, and during one session accidentally broke Sean Connery's wrist! Bonnie Tyler was originally going to sing the theme song, but didn't like it and bowed out; it was sung by Lani Hall (who?). Marketing for Octopussy for that year was very cognizant of a rival film appearing in the same year, and harped a lot on the Bond legacy... it also made it more urgent that they re-sign Roger Moore and not debut a new actor in the role.

The film has a lot of great scenes, and many creative shots, such as the health club fight scene, and the ""pre-credits"" scene is a tricky twist that was (sort of) adapted in The Living Daylights; it also has some wonky stuff, such as multiple use of video games (replacing the standard Bond vs villain card game with a Bond vs villain torture video game called Domination!!). There's also a nutty sold-into-slavery scene that seems particularly out-of-sorts with the franchise (potshots at EON perhaps, as with so many other things in the film?). Compared with the original, there are hardly any underwater shots (and who can forget that amazing underwater battle between Largo's forces and the British commando forces), although at least there's some nice saxophone for the underwater scenes to fill the dialogue void, and the whole ""Tears of Allah"" item is just plain silly. Funny dialogue like ""Dummy warheads will be replaced by nuclear warheads. Have a nice day."" Great nuke-flying-over-kids-playing-with-sandcastles-on-the-beach scene - campy, fake, but fun. There's a clever/kinky massage ""interrogation"" scene between Bond and Domino that's a nice touch. ""My game is Domination. I designed it myself."" The motorcycle chase scene seems to allude to scenes from For Your Eyes Only. Curiously, though, many of the transitions are choppy, perhaps a Kirshner trademark as we see the same things even in The Empire Strikes Back. There's no assassin sidekick for Largo, but then again he didn't have one in Thunderball either. Brandauer's Largo is pretty good, with his ironic ""you were a very good secret agent"" line. ""Sweet - like money!"" Cheezy wink at last shot.

The film got great reviews when it was released, especially from major critics like Roger Ebert, who could see that Connery was still a more sophisticated Bond (and a more Bond-like actor in general) than Roger Moore had ever been. Interestingly, the Thunderball story was nearly re-made in the 1990s with... Timothy Dalton.

870379,3,6304406096,"Bond James Bond.  This is the unofficial bond.  It is still Bond and it is still Sean Connery just a different studio and parent company.  Due to rights issues, MGM was able to make this non canonical james bond and its good.  This is not the best bond movie, but its not the worst.  Sometimes you might feel some dejavu if you saw the official one.
As far as quality this is probably (blu-ray) the best we will get. Has a nice picture, but not amazing like the ones in the 50 bond set, still has some nice sounds and different audio tracks.  Some noise an other artifacts are still seen, but much better than the DVD.  MGM is no more and this movie is OOP so only whatever copies are left is whats left of this.  I don't think anyone will bring out another version with 4K BDs but we will see.  James Bond parent company will probably want to stick this one into the never existence from now on.

870420,4,6304406096,"Irvin Kershner's compelling remake of the classic 1965 James Bond film ""Thunderball,"" with Sir Sean Connery delivering a brilliantly stylish performance that is filled with self-deprecating humor which makes this a welcome return to his legendary iconic role of James Bond after 12 years away from it, and it is a major treat indeed. The story concerns the nefarious ""SPECTRE"" head Blofeld, nicely played by Max Von Sydow, he has stolen two nuclear warheads from NATO air command with the help of his deadly female agent Fatima Blush, played marvelously by Barbara Carrera, in a memorable Golden Globe nominated performance. Biofeld threatens to detonate the atomic bombs in major cities if he is not paid the extortionate ransom. Chief overseer of this hideous plan is the billionaire Emile Largo, played brilliantly Klaus Maria Brandeur, who has one of the bombs hidden in an underwater cavern. Bond pursues Largo around the globe in an attempt to find both bombs and stop him, visiting such places as Monte Carlo and North Africa during the course of the mission. Astute direction by Irvin Kershner, with solid supporting performances by Kim Basinger, Bernie Casey, Edward Fox, Alec McCowed, and Rowan Atkinson. Well-crafted with beautiful cinematography.

870648,5,6304406096,"While NSNA doesn't have production values on par with EON's Bonds, it is still an excellent Bond film in it's own right. It feels a lot like an official Bond film in many aspects including the humor, writing, action, and presence of Connery (though Bond's character seems written differently here, a bit less dry and suave and a bit more charming and energetic like George Lazenby's portrayal). NSNA does bring Connery back, and he gives a fantastic performance as Bond. His age certainly does make you raise an eyebrow during love scenes, and watching every woman in the film stare at him with lust in their eyes is very awkward, but adds a bit to the fun fantasy world that we want out of Bond films like Goldfinger or TSWLM. Aside from that, Connery does a fantastic job delivering lines and looks very believable and physical during the action scenes. He also looks like he's finally having a joy in the role again, something that was sorely missed in YOLT and especially DAF. NSNA is loaded with great action, from the opening of the film to the fight at the health spa to the motorcycle chase to the finale battle between the CIA and SPECTRE. At the end of the day, the general and die-hard Bond fans will usually hate NSNA solely for the fact it was an unofficial film in the franchise, which is a shame because its well crafted, well shot, and well acted by the main cast. It has a pretty jazzy and smooth soundtrack as well. A fun movie with some fantastic aspects to it. IT is nowhere near being dreadfully bad like DAF or TMWTGG.",1428710400,,1540,4.503571428571429

fight budget cutbacks, an ""M"" that knows nothing of what the ""Double O's"" are
about, and the standard ruthless SPECTRE henchmen and henchwoman. For the experienced
James Bond fan, the movie contains a lot of subtle humor that pokes fun at some of
the characters from other ""Bond"" movies. Although this movie was not produced at
EON studios, and was not directed by the Broccoli family, it has the action and

There is no nuance in this video. Everything has to be explained by a director not sure the viewers would get anything. The story line is almost amateur. The setting of the battle underground is laughable. It looks like a child's fantasy run wild. The statues in the underground lair are from every region in the middle east.

871737,4,6304406096,"Trivia note: Sean Connery and Roger Moore both made seven James Bond films.  You might even recall 1983's Battle of the Bonds at the box office where Connery's finale, ""Never Say Never Again"" lost out to Moore's sixth Bond, ""Octopussy.""  Yet, in 2014, it's the novelty of Connery's movie that frankly deserves a second look.  Despite its turbulent production history (i.e. plenty of lawsuit action), ""Never Say Never Again"" revives Connery's legendary Bond persona - with two significant twists.  Twist # 1: """"Never Again"" casually remakes 1964's ""Thunderball,"" as terrorist organization SPECTRE initiates a worldwide extortion scheme courtesy of two stolen nuclear warheads.  Twist # 2: 52-year old Connery good-naturedly spoofs his well-known 007 ambivalence by playing Bond as a clearly aging, fifty-something relic who defies that he's simply too old for this secret agent stuff.

With the movie anchored by Connery's timelessly suave presence, the film's villains Klaus Maria Brandauer as wily industrialist Emile Largo and Barbara Carrera as exotic, flamboyantly-dressed assassin Fatima Blush undeniably steal the show.  I agree with other reviewers that Carrera's Fatima Blush is an obvious precursor to Famke Janssen's similar Xenia Omatopp in 1995's ""Goldeneye.""  The ensemble cast also includes: Kim Basinger as Domino; Bernie Casey as Felix Leiter; Edward Fox as the new M; Alec McCowen as Q (or Algernon, as he is referenced here); Max von Sydow in a terrific Blofeld cameo; and a young Rowan Atkinson as a bumbling diplomatic liaison.  Pamela Salem's Ms. Moneypenny gets merely a glance, so it's disappointing that her character is essentially ignored.  Yet, overall, it's a pretty solid cast amiably playing Lorenzo Semple Jr.'s campy script to perfection.

While the locales (England, the Bahamas, Monaco, etc.) are superb, Michel Legrand's jazzy instrumental score (plus Lani Hall's lounge-style title song) are merely adequate narrating the film.  ""Never Again"" compensates with witty, overt humor and some priceless Bond quips.  The stunts are hardly spectacular but are at least very believable for someone Connery's age and his impressive fitness.  Further, there is a curious element of unpredictability, as neither the famous spear-gun ""He got the point"" scene, nor even Bond's escape from Largo's shark-infested swimming pool are recreated here.  ""Never Again"" instead acknowledges the 1980's Atari era with Bond's ""Wargames""-style video game face-off in a Monaco casino vs. Largo.  Bond also gets a fun motorcycle chase and some excellent underwater action, including a final scuba showdown with Largo.  Wickedly fun Fatima Blush's antics also add some much-needed zest to the Bond-Largo feud.

The flip side is that you'll know what's missing and what's still coming.  There isn't a gun barrel walk; no flashy pre-credits sequence; no signature Bond theme; no slick, razzle-dazzle editing; and no other familiar franchise faces.  No matter the few surprises, anyone who has already seen ""Thunderball"" is familiar with the plot and its outcome.  Additionally, despite good chemistry with Connery, Bernie Casey's Felix Leiter is relegated to Bond's sidekick, as the script never explains how he conveniently just shows up whenever needed.  Basinger's Domino is a standard damsel-in-distress, but she shares some nice scenes with Brandauer and Connery.  To a charming Basinger's credit, her implausible, age-defying romance with Connery plays better (and isn't nearly as icky) as the similar Roger Moore-Tanya Roberts couple for 1985's ""A View to a Kill.""  There is one exception: late in the film, a close-up of Connery & Basinger's horseback escape from some baddies over an African castle wall into the ocean is just laughably bad.

In summary, the breezy ""Never Again"" rates arguably as one of Connery's lesser Bond films, as it is on a par with 1967's ""You Only Live Twice."" Even so, it still far outclasses 1971's similarly campy yet uninspired ""Diamonds Are Forever.""

Score: 3 /5 stars.  ""Never Again"" ultimately retains a very watchable magic featuring the original Agent 007 one last time.",1400198400,3,4121,5.418495297805642

871827,3,6304406096,"Sean Connery swore off playing James Bond again after 1971's ""Diamonds Are Forever.""  He kept his promise until a rival studio threw tons of money his way, an offer he couldn't refuse.  Connery was just in his early 50's and from the neck down looked fit as a fiddle.  But his hairline was but a wisp and his craggily face showed a bit of wear, probably from playing golf in the sun.  Because of some legal disputes with Fleming's original novel, MGM released the film backed by numerous production studios.  Roger Moore's ""Octopussy"" was released the same year.  Oh the fun.

Directed by Irvin Kershner, this film is actually a remake of ""Thunderball"" which first hit the screen in 1965.  SPECTRE is back this time headed up by Max Von Sydow as Blofeld and next in command, Klaus Maria Brandauer as Largo.  They have managed to kidnap a couple nuclear missiles from the U. S. Air Force.  They want a bazillion dollars or else they will blow up stuff and kill a lot of people.  007 has actually been placed on a desk assignment along with the rest of the double 0's by M (Edward Fox) who doesn't appreciate their value in the modern era of espionage.

With little choice, and pressure from the Home Secretary, Bond is reactivated and charged with recovering the nuke-armed Tomahawks.  Bond tracks down Largo to the Bahamas but is constantly thwarted by Fatima Blush (very good Barbara Carrera), a sometime playmate of Largo's and his constant bodyguard.  Bond's romantic focus is Domino (Kim Basinger), who keeps company with Largo but is also the sister of an Air Force officer who switched sides and became a casualty.

This is a fairly routine Bond outing, aside from the flamboyant Carrera.  Connery pulls off the coolness factor without question but it is also pretty evident he had plenty of body doubles and stuntmen do much of the heavy lifting.  As with all of the Bond films the locations (Bahamas, France, Monaco, England and Florida) are great as is the photography.  I did miss the opening sequence of Bond shooting at us from the iris-like tunnel.  Herb Alpert and wife Lani Hall, handle the title song and Michel Legrand did the film score.  I only had a DVD released in 2000.  For the most part it looked pretty good on my rig.

871828,5,6304406096,"NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN [1983] [Blu-ray] [UK Release] Sean Connery is James Bond!

Sean Connery is back for his final performance as agent James Bond in this high-velocity action thriller. Agent 007 is hurled into a pulse-pounding race to save the world from Armageddon when two atomic warheads are hijacked by the evil SPECTRE organisation.

FILM FACT: Due to Great Britain's strict policy with regards to animal violence, one scene showing a horse falling into the ocean was cut, brought on by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals [RSPCA], which is the largest animal rights group worldwide. This is only available to be viewed on an uncut German PAL DVD. The music for Never Say Never Again was written by Michel Legrand, who composed a score similar to his work as a jazz pianist. Phyllis Hyman also recorded a potential theme song, written by Stephen Forsyth and Jim Ryan, but the song, an unsolicited submission, was passed over given Michel Legrand's contractual obligations with the music. Neither the famous opening credits nor the James Bond Theme or the 007 Logo were allowed to be used.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: Never Say Never Again begins with James Bond unsuccessfully taking part in a series of simulated missions for MI6. There's a new ""M"" [Edward Fox] in town who isn't fond of the ""00"" branch; he's relegated Bond to assignments as an instructor and has all but disbanded the ""00"" forces. Bond isn't getting any younger at this point, so he's ordered to clean up his act and to get into better shape by checking into a health spa. There, Bond accidentally uncovers a plot put in motion by SPECTRE, and the organization's ruthless leader Ernst Stavro Blofeld [Max Von Sydow], to steal several nuclear warheads, threaten the world and collect a giant ransom. When the warheads go missing, MI6 panics, reactivates Bond and sends him on a mission to the Caribbean to work his double-0 magic on the situation. Once in the Bahamas, Bond encounters Maximilian Largo [Klaus Maria Brandauer], an agent of SPECTRE who lives on a giant high-tech yacht. Bond will re-team with his old pal, CIA Agent Felix Leiter [Bernie Casey], and Largo's girlfriend Domino [Kim Basinger] to put a stop to their nefarious plans.

Never Say Never Again features a number of great action sequences, from underwater fights, to motorcycle chases; as well as an unfortunate reliance on some primitive blue screen work. Fortunately, the film is so effortless in its direction and story, that none of this is particularly bothersome. Never Say Never Again also benefits from one of the strongest villains in James Bond history; Klaus Maria Brandauer turns in a bravura performance as Largo, while managing to stay within the realm of reality and avoiding the megalomaniacal histrionics that often accompany Bond villain performances. He's simply fantastic in the role. Kim Basinger is an acceptable Domino, but comes across as something of a hard sell when compared to Thunderball's Domino, Claudine Auger. Finally, Max Von Sydow is an effectively creepy Blofeld that seems to have a bit more personality than those of the Eon Productions films. His addition to the cast, along with that of Mr. Brandauer's, gives Never Say Never Again one of the strongest rosters of villains in the history of the franchise, bar none.

Invariably, the question always arises: Is Never Say Never Again as good as Thunderball? Not really. The story is virtually identical, of course, but Never Say Never Again doesn't have the style of the original. Thunderball was one of the pivotal James Bond films and helped to cement many of Bond's signature trademarks. His sense of style, along with his decidedly sexist behaviour, was an aspect of James Bond's character that has followed him through the decades. It's fresh and almost charming in Thunderball, while already looking dated in Never Say Never Again. Regardless, Never Say Never Again is very entertaining and faithful to the James Bond character. It might not achieve the heights of the other James Bond films from the sixties, but is just as good.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Never Say Never Again Blu-ray release represents the first serious attempt at presenting the film in a manner befitting a Sean Connery Bond film. Presented in a nice 1080p encoded image and the film's original theatrical aspect ratio of 2.35:1, Never Say Never Again looks pretty darn good. The primary problem with the release is print damage; there are a number of scenes where print scratches and dirt become obvious, marring this otherwise excellent presentation. I noticed more issues cropping up during the film's special effects shots, particularly during obvious optical composites. Clearly, Never Say Never Again hasn't been run through the restoration process at Lowry, like EON Productions' films have. Regardless, the good elements outweigh the bad in Never Say Never Again. Contrast is generally impressive, with rich black levels. Colours are slightly washed-out, but that's probably the nature of the film's early-eighties photography. Detail is moderate, but appropriate given the source material. Grain is slightly inconsistent, with heavier grain appearing in special effects shots where optical printing was used. It's nothing out of the ordinary for a film of the early eighties. Lastly, there aren't any noticeable compression-related issues with Never Say Never Again and the film has been given a high quality encode. While the film doesn't rise to the same video heights as most of the other James Bond films, this is still a worthy upgrade from any previous version of the film. Never Say Never Again looks better than ever on this Blu-ray disc.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  I was fully expecting Never Say Never Again to be a disappointment in the audio department. Surprisingly, the film has been given a substantial update in its sound mix, thanks to a potent helping of 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio encoding combined with some serious audio remixing. There's a nice atmosphere throughout the film that mixes in a number of rear directional effects in action sequences. Dialogue is, for the most part, isolated to the centre channel, while the film's somewhat awkward musical score takes root entirely in the front soundstage. For a movie from the early 1980s, Never Say Never Again will never sound as up-to- date as, say, Quantum of Solace. Not that it necessarily should, for that matter. I was duly impressed with this updated soundtrack's restraint. It would have been easy to remix the track to the point of being ridiculous. Never Say Never Again is again highly recommended.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary with Director Irvin Kershner and James Bond Historian Steven Jay Rubin: Director Irvin Kershner is  joined by 007 Historian Steven Jay Rubin, who claims that this is one of his favourite films. Something tells me that any movie with James Bond in it would qualify as one of his favourites. For a Bond historian, Rubin makes some surprising factual errors, such as stating that the Blofeld character hadn't been seen in a 007 movie since 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service', when in fact he made appearances in both 'Diamonds Are Forever' and 'For Your Eyes Only.' The track also has a little too much play-by-play recapping of the action on screen. Regardless, this is a pretty engaging conversation, especially when Irvin Kershner describes his problems with how much of the novel he had to include versus how much of the previous 'Thunderball' film he wasn't allowed to use.

Special Feature Documentary: The Big Gamble [1983] [480i] [4:3] [16:00] An overview of the history of the project, development of the script, and the legal problems that the producers faced. Director Irvin Kershner admits to being bored by the script and the final action scene.

Special Feature Documentary: Sean is Back [1983] [480i] [4:3] [8:00] The cast and crew reminisce about working with Sean Connery and offer him their highest compliments.

Special Feature: The Girls of Never Say Never Again [1983] [480i] [4:3] [10:00] A discussion about the casting of Kim Basinger, who was intimidated by the cast and her husband, and had a bad experience making the film. The still-lovely Barbara Carrera [Fatima Blush] says that she enjoyed improvising much of her role.

Theatrical Trailer [1983] [480i] [4:3] [1:00] The Blu-ray disc menus calls it a theatrical trailer, but this is clearly a 4:3 pan and scan TV spot. Probably because MGM/Fox couldn't get the trailer material out of Warner Bros.

Finally, the inspiration of 1980s fads dates this film, besides the title song sung by Lani Hall with Herb Alpert trumpet solo (it's the exception and not the rule, after all, when a James Bond title song isn't dated) and a terrible score by Michel Legrand, the plot nods to a pop culture dominated by Jane Fonda workouts and video-game arcades, especially one suspense sequence pits James Bond against Largo in a wired-to-kill game of ""Domination."" Instead of Desmond Llewelyn as ""Q"" and Never Say Never Again offers Alec McCowen as Algernon. In one of the film's most dry funny scenes, is when Algernon tells Bond, ""Good to see you, Mr. Bond. Things have been awfully dull around here. Bureaucrats running the old place, everything done by the book...Now you're on this, I hope we're going to have some gratuitous sex and violence."" While it certainly isn't the best of the James Bond films, Never Say Never Again is far from being the worst. In fact, it's a remarkably entertaining diversion in the James Bond universe that manages to entertain while showcasing Sean Connery's final take on the legendary spy he helped create. James Bond fans will love the film's tongue-in-cheek manner and will get a kick out of seeing a slightly older Sean Connery in an unexpected return to the role that made him famous. This Blu-ray release of Never Say Never Again is clearly the finest presentation of the film that has ever graced home screens, though an unfortunate amount of print damage does detract slightly from the experience. The film's audio presentation is generally impressive, if restrained; supplements are, however, lacking in depth. Ultimately, Never Say Never Again is a strange footnote in cinema history that manages to be genuinely enjoyable, while showcasing a number of exceptional performances and it was a brilliant film for Sean Connery who finally bowed out of the James Bond franchise and now I have the final Sean Connery James Bond film added to my other James Bond Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!

While I understand criticisms of the score of NSNA, and also understand it's not as glitzy as other Bond movies, with gadgets and such, I have to say that this is a solid movie.  I saw it when it first came out, and have grown to like it more with each viewing.  Connery is in great shape and there's alot of action.  I'm going to risk the scorn of many Bond fans, but in all honesty, this film holds my attention much more than Thunderball, You Only Live Twice and certainly Diamonds are Forever.  While I love the spectacle of The Spy Who Loved Me and Octopussy (my 2 favorite Moore Bonds), this movie is more down to Earth...which is precisely how Connery wanted it (I agree, and also agree with Connery's distaste for outer space angles in Bond movies).  If I had to pick one Connery Bond movie, this would be it.  I like From Russia With Love and Goldfinger, but the more modern elements of this movie do something for me that the previous ones do not.  And, Connery is in total command (if only he'd had a better toupee).  I'm not thrilled about underwater scenes in ""any"" movie, especially as a finale.  But, the ending of Thunderball bored me, too.  The 60's Connery Bonds seem dated, even though I enjoy them.  For whatever reason, even though it's over 30 years old, this movie doesn't seem dated to me.  I wish Connery had done one more, from this era (the 80's).",1390435200,,1622,4.377926421404682

This was Sean Connery's sad attempt to show he could still play James Bond several years after Roger Moore had taken over the part.  Since it was made by people who did not have the rights to the 007 franchise they decided to re-write ""Thunderball"" (evidently not owned by the franchise at the time).  They did a very poor job and this is not even considered to be one of the 007 movies.  The original (Thunderball) is by far better; better acting, better script, better all around.

871900,5,6304406096,"I could never understand why would Amazon group together all reviews for different versions of the same movie. When I am thinking about buying a Blu-Ray disk I am not at all interested in whether there are any extras on a DVD of the same film! And most reviews are about the DVD version which appears to be missing a scene while still selling for twice the price of the Blu-Ray. Sometimes the logic of retailers and their customers escapes me completely. Personally, I stopped buying DVDs long time ago since I can't justify paying even a quarter of what a Blu-Ray goes for.

Therefore, I decided to add a review of the Blu-Ray disk. People who never saw the movie (if they exist) and are interested in the review of the actual film should go to Rotten Tomatoes or IMDB or any other specialized movie website.

This disk is not included in the ""official"" 50th-anniversary collection which supposedly includes ""all 23 Bond films"". The rational is that this particular movie was produced by a different company or something like that, which of course is completely irrelevant to most of the viewers (why on earth would I care which company produces the movie?). However, quality-wise it makes sense to compare the ""Never Say Never"" to the disks from the collection set.

Video quality - OK, nothing spectacular as in recent movies and with some scenes where you can actually see that this was transferred from an old tape (no remastering, I guess), but still better than any DVD I own. So four stars for that.

Sound quality - DTS 5.1, but of course, you can't really add any effects without completely reworking the soundtrack and it's clear that was not done here. But it's an old movie, so I guess one should be grateful it's not mono or something. Also four stars.

Extras - I don't care for those, so I did not look.

Menus - thank God, the movie starts right away - I mean, I put the disk into my player, press ""play"", and the movie starts. This way I don't have to wait for menus and legal notices and press a lot of buttons! That pushes the disk to five stars!",1388275200,5,2066,4.510695187165775

871959,3,6304406096,This item was ridiculously overpriced. It must be a result of one of the poorest written James Bond scripts as it surely was not the actors. E.g.

871967,5,6304406096,"This is one of my favorite James Bond films, a stylish and mature take on the character that grows on me with each viewing. Sean Connery, who had quit playing James Bond for the second time after completing his sixth film ""Diamonds Are Forever"" in 1971, returns here 12 years later for one last fling at the role in a loose remake of his own ""Thunderball"" (1965) under a different production company. This 1983 film opened in the same year that Roger Moore played James Bond in ""Octopussy,"" doing comparable box office. One only needs to watch these two films side-by-side to see the difference between Connery and everyone else. Unlike later incarnations of James Bond, Connery plays Bond with the perfect mixture of stylish detachment and seriousness, being neither buffoonish like Moore and Pierce Brosnan nor too serious like Timothy Dalton and Daniel Craig. If you've never watched Connery's Bond films, you're missing out.

Connery always liked ""From Russia With Love"" (the second Bond film) best and despised the adolescent emphasis on gadgets and jokes that he felt overwhelmed his character by the time of ""You Only Live Twice"" (1967) and ""Diamonds."" This 1983 film is his effort to ""do it right again"" one last time, bringing Bond back to the character-driven basics of the first two movies. Here he overcomes the film's downscale sensibility (so very different from what later Bond films became) with a great performance that makes this film (in my opinion) one of the best Bond movies, if not the best in the whole series. Like ""Dr. No"" and ""Russia,"" there is very little adolescent humor here, as Connery plays an aging spy called back into action one last time with self-deprecating flair. This Bond knows he is old, but intends to live his life to the fullest, and it's a pleasure to see a film that lets Bond get older after suffering through so many other stars (especially Roger Moore) who refused to let the character age or develop. And to put it bluntly, Connery is simply a better actor than everyone else who has tackled this role, which shows in his keen grasp of the human core of a character who seems on paper little different from the psychotic assassins he battles.

In this film Connery also gets excellent nemeses in Klaus Maria Brandauer, Max von Sydow, and Barbara Carrerra. Kim Basinger, Rowan Atkinson, Bernie Casey, Edward Fox, Ronald Pickup, Gavin O'Herlihy, and Alec McCowan make likable allies. These are easily some of the best actors to do James Bond, if not the best cast ever assembled for this material, but they also (with the exception of Carrerra, whose fun scenery-chewing stops just short of being too much) do it with realism under the sure hand of ""Empire Strikes Back"" director Irvin Kirchner. If your taste runs to the more adolescent and outlandish Bonds, you will probably not enjoy this film's jazz riff on an aging hero, but you'll love it if you're a fan of the original Connery films -- which, by the way, are simply better movies than almost everything that's followed. That's why the newer Bonds keep rehashing the originals.

Other than the prestige picture-feeling of ""Skyfall,"" ""Never"" is a cut above most James Bond productions in the quality department. From the director and technical crew to the cast, everything about it has a class that exceeds the EON Bond films. The characterizations are nuanced and complex, the humor organic to the plot rather than forced, and the gadgets in service of the story rather than dominating it. Most importantly it provides a classy ""farewell film"" for Sean Connery, who plays here an aging spy called out of retirement to battle evil one last time. Not only is it a better sendoff movie for Connery than the fun lunacy of ""Diamonds,"" but it's really the only proper sendoff movie that any Bond actor has ever received, even daring to let Bond retire(!) at the end. Other than the over-the-top Fatima Blush and a few brief but effective action scenes, the film resolutely avoids the cartoonish elements and over-the top FX of other Bond films, returning the series to its starting point as it sends off its original star with class.

Some viewers complain that this movie feels too much like ""Thunderball"" at times, but I really didn't notice it beyond ""Largo"" and ""Domino"" coming back. After all, *every* Bond movie follows a formula that recycles certain situations, feeling vaguely like prior films. (In one Daniel Craig film, they actually dip a girl in oil and lay her out just like a similar unlucky girl in ""Goldfinger,"" and ""Die Another Day"" is just a long assembly of greatest hits.) On the other hand, ""Never"" works so hard to create its own personality within the basic plot framework of ""Thunderball"" that it feels incredibly fresh, showing us new things like the tango scene and video game battle which are much appreciated for daring to deviate from the old pattern.

As for the continuity of this film with others, I must point out that the Bond films are so filled with continuity errors (i.e. Blofeld not recognizing Bond in ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service,"" one film after they had battled face to face as different actors) that it's impossible to watch them all straight through and feel it's quite the same series. There's also the retcon issues of Daniel Craig's films, which clearly reboot the series from the start with a new timeline. Over the years, I've realized that it's easiest to watch the Bond films by actor rather than by year, appreciating each actor's take on the character as a self-contained series unrelated to the Bond films of other actors. Watching the films by actor rather than in chronological order, it becomes clear that Connery's films (despite their ups and downs) have the best continuity and overall consistency of quality: If you watch all six of the Eon-produced Bond films and finish up with ""Never Say Never Again,"" you'll have a satisfying experience of an entirely self-contained spy film series.

After watching the Connery movies, you can decide if you want to watch Lazenby and Moore (best paired since Moore's films are the only ones which really acknowledge the existence of Lazenby's one-shot movie, even resolving its climax in the pre-credits sequence of ""For Your Eyes Only"") and then Dalton, Brosnan, and Craig. The older I get, the less I'm inclined to watch the non-Connery films myself. Connery's stuff feels the most original; unfortunately, most Bond films after Connery feel like a copy of a copy of themselves.",1383782400,11,6488,4.861663652802894
872049,2,6304406096,"Thanks to some bizarre copyright issues, the rights to the James Bond novel Thunderball were never completely held by the traditional Bond production team.

Thus, another movie or movies could be made by another company with a screenplay based on Thunderball. Never Say Never Again was the result in 1983, with Sean Connery returning as James Bond 11 years after he had last played the role in Diamonds are Forever.

Roger Moore's tenure as Bond was winding down in 1983, though that year's official Bond entry, Octopussy, still outgrossed this movie. Connery looks game but a little tired here, and the pacing seems off, and the movie overlong by about 20 minutes and one too many changes of locale. Klaus Maria Brandauer does make for a surprisingly sinister Bond villain, while Barbara Carrera and Kim Basinger do OK work as Bond girls evil and good, respectively.

The tone shifts even more abruptly than usual for a Bond film, from parodic to serious and back again. That may partially be because of the screenwriter, Lorenzo Semple, who helped turn both the Batman tv series of the 1960's and the 1980 Flash Gordon film into smirking parodies of themselves. It's not quite Camp here, but it's close. M and the rest of the Bond hierarchy take the most severe beating, though Rowan Atkinson's first big-screen appearance, as an MI6 operative played solely for laughs, also grates. Bernie Casey is fine as CIA agent Felix Leiter, and actually has something to do other than supply exposition.

The prime oddity of Never Say Never Again is that the first thirty minutes or so play like a dry run for the recent Bond movie Skyfall, as a rundown James Bond faces suspension and the Double-O program itself faces termination in the wake of political changes. An historical oddity, Never Say Never Again also acts as a weird psychological test -- viewing a James Bond movie without the familiar soundtrack never feels entirely comfortable. That the score for this movie, and the title song, are both unremittingly terrible doesn't help things.",1383782400,3,2041,4.907246376811594

One noticeable difference is how much Bond's womanizing ways are toned down. In the original film he gropes  his physical therapist, and eventually blackmails her into having sex with him, which is uncomfortable for someone with modern sensibilities to watch. In the remake, she becomes the aggressor and seduces Bond.

The bizarre thing is Sean Connery starring in a remake of his own film, in the same role. I'm not aware of any other actor having had this opportunity. But it's pretty clear from the formulaic script and lackluster performance that he was in this for the money or to revive his flagging career.

Yes, I'm aficionado of highbrow cinema like the later works of Pier Paolo Pasolini and the entire filmography of Japan's master filmmaker Akira Kurosawa, but I have a huge soft spot for movies that other people would just call terrible, like pretty much anything from the Troma library and the hundreds, maybe thousands of the post-Leone ""Spaghetti Westerns"" which featured Italians pretending to be cowboys in movies made by people who had never even been to the area once known as 'the Old West,' let alone knew anything about what happened there, which is why those movies often featured cowboys fighting ninjas or something absurd like that. I digress.

""Never Say Never Again"" falls somewhere in between those two types of movies. On the one hand, it's a James Bond movie, you can't expect it to be very realistic or ground by rules like ""there's no such thing as lasers!"" However, it's not a movie that you would think is going to be super serious, it's not ""The Godfather,"" it's not about the politics of international espionage, it's, like I said-- a James Bond movie.

From what I understand, this movie was produced by a guy who worked on ""Thunderball,"" a previous ""Bond"" film, he somehow obtained the rights to remake ""Thunderball"" and did so out of spite against Cubby Broccoli, whose production company, I believe it's called EON Films, has produced every ""official"" James Bond movie to date. Anyway, this vindictive producer got the rights and despite the movie being made solely with the intention of upsetting Cubby Broccoli, it's a fairly good movie. Sean Connery reprises his role as James Bond for the first time in twelve years and as he always was as Bond in the past, he remains darned good at it. The movie is directed by Irvin Kershner, who also directed hits like ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and a personal favorite of mine, the highly underrated ""RoboCop 2.""

The movie is, as stated, pretty much a rehash of ""Thunderball,"" however with an aging Bond who is no longer in his prime. He goes to a health center to get back in shape where he discovers a madman's plot to-- you know the rest. If you haven't seen it, it's not going to do any good for me to write out the entire plot. I will say, it's full of memorable scenes, the opening scene with Bond infiltrating a tropic stronghold was very memorable and kept me interested the rest of the movie, but my favorite scene had to be when James Bond plays a deadly video game against the maniacal Maximilian Largo, brilliant played by Klaus Maria Brandauer who I remember watching in Disney's ""White Fang"" as a kid.

872377,1,6304406096,"Buyer Beware! If you purchase a used copy of this DVD, chances are it will have missing chapters. It will either freeze up or skip. The problem is that MGM originally released a defective product. When this was discovered, they offered their customers a free replacement. Now, less than scrupulous people are capitalizing on the situation by selling off the defective ones. You may find yourself a victim of just such a seller if you purchase a used one. I purchased mine from GoHastings who advertised it as being in ""Very Good"" condition. Actually, Amazon states that a DVD that is missing segments is ""Unacceptable,"" so a rating of ""Very Good"" is an outright lie. Because the new one is so expensive, I offered to keep the DVD ""as is"" if they would discount the price. Apparently, they thought an ""Unacceptable"" DVD was worth the full price and would not discount it. So, beware and make sure you are not purchasing one of the defective DVDs--contact the seller and get some guarantees or see if they are willing to check it for the missing chapters.",1369612800,3,1053,4.697297297297298

The realism displayed within this Movie is on par with real life scenarios and results.

For instance in the beginning; when one goes to the Home, one would expect the kind of care he had received.

But seriously, the directors did a great job pushing the envelope of making sure the audience was being entertained by believable actions.

The only thing a James Bond fan is going to miss with this particular Movie, are the one liners after he kills or somebody has had an accident.  I never understood this until I read some blurbs about licensing issues, then the pieces fell together.  (ie. See Never Say Never Again Wikipedia, ""was not produced by Eon Productions"")

It was good to see Sean Connery back in the ""saddle"" after the lamentable performances of Roger Moore hamming it up. It has pace, but what gives this movie that ""bit extra"" is the stylish direction of Irvin Kershiner. The performances by Barbara Carrera and Klaus Maria Brandauer are larger than life, but never drift into pure caricature. And there are the nice touches of humour.

First off I did not buy this off of Amazon, I was lucky enough to find this at record store just my luck because it is out of print, WTF MGM! (for those of you who are not aware MGM bought the rights to this film a couple years back, just so they own everything Bond related).  The great thing about this movie is of course the return of Sean Connery to the role of Bond, if it wasn't for him this movie would suck soooooo much.  The reason being is because this is a remake, meaning everything here has already been done previously in Thunderball, and yet because of Connerys return this is a must have for Bond super fans.  The movie starts off with a great opening action scene, but the problem with the intro is that you don't get that familiar gun barrel sequence that we all know love and the theme....well its kind of lame.  Once movie gets going its really not that bad, idk why fans hate it so much there have been cheesier EON Bond movies.  This movie has grit, like all of the earlier Connery Bond movies its just great to have to have that again.  Sean Connery just has this likability about him, he was the first cinema Bond and he paved the way for all the other actors.  If you are a die hard fan and you get a chance to pick this movie up, do it because you never know when or if you will ever come by it again.

872874,1,6304406096,"i know, i know, you'd think it would've been that uneven farce version of CASINO ROYALE from 1967, but nope: THIS is the low-water mark of the ertswile spy's cinematic career. if this film had been directed by Ed Wood and starred Gilbert Gottfried as Bond, it would take all of their ""talents"" pushed the proverbial 11 to make a cheesier, less satisfying film than the one we ended up with.
in this truly pointless, shameless vanity project, that crown prince of overrated, Sean Connery, compounds the sin of being merely adequate for the part AND the sin of failing to recognize that he had passed his prime, at least where this sort of character is concerned, with the sin of callous, cold-blooded mercenaryism. there was no attempt whatsoever to do anything new with the character and/or premise. it's well known that the film is basically a carbon-copy of THUNDERBALL, and has always been well known. i think the damn thing may well of been marketed as such.
the rhythm is all off. despite the instantly recognizable kinship to THUNDERBALL, it feels about as much like one of ""Cubby"" Broccoli's Bond productions as THE GODFATHER feels like SESAME STREET. one might expect more from director Irvin Kirschner, if only because he did the absolutely faultless THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. but one does have to remember that, while Star Wars and James Bond share the trait of being escapist franchises, they're not exactly twins. no, the real culprit here is the  overzealous producer, one Jack Schwartzman.
(although, given Kirchner's confession in the commentary that he feels THUNDERBALL was the very weakest of the Bond films, it does become plausible than he would simply give up ""trying"" at some point.)
the cleverest thing about the film (and even this only just barely qualifies) is the title. it has nothing to do with the plot: reportedly coined by Connery's wife, it refers to his vow to ""never again"" play James Bond a decade or so earlier. (Connery has always freely admitted he's disliked the character from the get-go.) and quite frankly, even if you don't know that story, it's not exactly a backward message on an Ozzy Osbourne album, now is it?
one must also consider that it was released hot on the heels of the not exactly perfect but still far more satisfying Roger Moore film OCTOPUSSY. this doesn't exactly create that unsavory feel of milking the cash cow, but it doesn't exactly detract from it, either. i've said it before and i'm willing to say again as often as i have to: the definitive 007 is Roger Moore, and that's all there is to it. whatever stories you've heard to the contrary are just a nasty rumor started by the same idiots who keep saying the Holocaust never happened.
i'm certainly not suggesting that Connery is a poor actor. he would grace not one, not two, but THREE of the very greatest films of the next couple years: HIGHLANDER, INDIANA JONES & THE LAST CRUSADE, THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER. i'm simply trying to point out where people get confused: the Bond films were the original action franchise - it was the beginning not merely of the franchise, but the subgenre itself - so Connery was admittedly the most TRENDSETTING Bond, but that's  a matter of circumstance, not ability. it's not unheard of to be first AND best, but nobody is best SOLELY because they happen to be first first. by that logic, Icarus - who fashioned crude wings from stray bird feathers and flapped his arms, only to see them melt when he got to close to the sun - achieved more than the Wright Brothers would.
simply put, Connery is like Edgar Allan Poe, who invented the detective story, and Moore is like Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who fine-tuned and perfected the detective character via Sherlock Holmes. in other words, Connery may not be the pinnacle, but he still made a vital contribution to the series.
the official series, that is. NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN is a bastard, leech cousin. too little too late.",1356825600,2,3926,4.7299270072992705

This is a remake of Thunderball years later, both staring the same actor, Sean Connery. Since Thunderball was an official EON release, and after a legal battle Never Say Never Again was released later independently, Never Say Never Again is sometimes counted as an ""UNofficial"" Bond movie. You can read a lot about this conflict on the Internet, but in my opinion even though this movie was made 12 years after his last Bond movie, Connery is a little older, wiser, and mature as an actor, and does a fine job. Though the underlying plot of both Thunderball and Never Say Never Again are essentially identical (bad guy steals two nukes... Bond has to find them) and even though there are underwater fights and stuff, both movies have their good and bad points. I enjoyed this one and it kept me entertained.

And it was quite good. Who knows the way they can make movies today maybe they can come out with an alternate version since EON productions bought the rights to the film maybe it will happen and make it like the rest of the films. I reccommend people to watch it. Go to youtube ""never say never again offical 007 style opening'""",1344211200,,494,4.15625
873073,5,6304406096,"Was very impressed with the lengthy backstory involving all the studio and legal problems that went along with trying to make the film, which was not making Mr. Broccoli (he of the orig Bond Franchises) very happy at all.  Seems his studio went through all the legal meanderings trying to put a kabosh on the whole movie, and much to NSNA's producer, the late Jack Schwartzman, that did not happen!  Was also happy to see it in HD as well!
Overall the film was pretty much as I remembered it from years ago -- maybe better for NOT having seen it in some time.  I have to agree with the director that Barbara Carrera was not used to her fullest potential in prior roles, and so she made the most of this one -- thanks in large part to dierector Irvin Kershner.  A great lady villan -- over the top perhaps, but great!  Kim Basinger, on the other hand, did not look like she was having much fun, although most of the scenes with Connery were well done.  Kershner finally found out that Kim's halting acting was due to her boyfriend and/or husband being on the set (her hairdresser) and she was looking to him for direction instead of playing her role as written.  Kershner threw him off the set, and that may have lessened the tensions in later filming for Ms. Basinger...
Connery was not lacking much from his earlier efforts as 007; perhaps a bit drier and a tad slower, but he also did not try to ""fake"" his age or abilities.  His timing in every respect was spot on and his actions still like the 'Old Bond'.  Klaus Maria Brandauer was very good as the easily psychotic agent of SPECTRE -- cool and calculating, deceptively creepy and taken to instant violence.  You could not find a better leading cast overall than this film.
Since most filmgoers will not have to be told much about Bond films at this stage of the series' life, let me just say that this one has better earmarks of Ian Flemings original than a lot of the later movies.  In fact the more you dig into the details of this film the more surprised you're likely to get!
Music by Michel Legrand--""A""; cinematography by Douglas Slocombe --""A""; supporting characters -- ""A"" all the way!  Bernie Casey as the genuine Felix Lighter, Edward Fox as the crusty and by the book ""M"", Max Von Sydow plays the head of SPECTRE with a very believable demeanor (and the usual white Persian cat), and Lani Hall produces a very pleasant Pre and Post rendering of ""Never Say Never Again"".  And 'yes', that is Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson) playing a rather inept agent ""from the Home Office"".
So, did I miss the obviously naked silhouettes of ladies tumbling over and over and all that other ""franchise"" stuff?  A hearty ""NO!""  Yes, this film is a rehash of sorts of ""Thunderball"", and though it lacks the 20 minutes of underwater fighting in the original, and maybe (just a maybe) not quite as thrilling a finish (though the 1st version has a speeded up finish which looked quite 'tacky' and maybe just a bit implausible, if not downright impossible), though I thought that this ending was very satisfying and in keeping with what had gone before.  I would also say that the Blu-Ray is a cut above the regular DVD, especially in the sound department.
I use a SONY 46"" HDTV, SONY BLu-Ray player and some Monsoon speakers to do my listening and viewing.  A real shame that Monsoon  are no longer around, as they made a very superior sounding product.  The SONY items I bought from Amazon, and have not been at all disappointed with anything  they have sold to me.  If you have not seen this film, then I hope you will try it out -- it's as good as most of the original Connery Bonds and maybe, in some aspects, better.
By the way, try out Amazon's resellers for a great used Blu-Ray -- you'll save a lot of $$$ and still get a terrific film!",1340755200,5,3784,4.447178002894356

That would have been a good premise for an original Bond movie, but not a rehash of Thunderball.  Looking back on it all, didn't the producers realize that they were making an almost exact copy of Thunderball?  Oh yeah, Kevin McClory was the producer and he was still angry at Ian Fleming for the novel.  Perhaps this was McClory's attempt to say ""I can make Thunderball better than you can!""

Anyway, Connery does a good job as an older Bond in the game one last time.  The action, gadgets, and humor are all there, but you'll swear you've seen/heard it all before, and you have.

Apparently Kevin McClory sought to do yet another remake of Thunderball in the 90's with Timothy Dalton but nobody was up for it.  I think he was just obsessed with Thunderball, but luckily, new producers came around for other Bond films (not counting A View to a Kill, which was really just a re-telling of Goldfinger).

873160,5,6304406096,"No matter what critics, fans or naysayers state to me Sean Connery is the ultimate Bond. Suave, charismatic and completely sexy (even in his fifties when this movie was made) Connery has had many actors (most notably Daniel Craig) give him a run for his money acting as the super spy agent, but Sean Connery, who originated the role, will always be this character. So, in 1983 it was with great relief Connery was persuaded to reprise the role in ""Never Say Never Again"", the second Bond film released that year. However, this particular movie was not produced by the original Bond producers, but by an independent franchise and different studio. That is why you won't find this movie in other box sets that house other Bond films.

 The title of this film is derived from a quote Connery gave way back in 1971 after he did ""Diamonds Are Forever"" when he said he would never play James Bond again. At 52 he looks even better than he did in previous Bond outings (if anything he is more handsome). In this version Bond investigates the theft of two nuclear weapons by SPECTRE.

 Among the beautiful women in ""Never Say Nevr Again"" is Kim Basinger and Barbara Carrera.

It uses the James Bond 007 trademark, it stars Sean Connery who is in most opinions THE Bond and the story is based off the Thunderball novel. It is part of all that is Bond, so every true collector should own Never Say Never Again.

Being aware of how horrible the movie was, I never cared to watch it or to seek it out for that matter until I grieved for not owning every Bond film.  I decided once I got the DVD to give it a chance.  Wow, where do I start?  Quite possibly one of the worst movies ever made and by far the worst of any ""Bond"" film.

First of all, Sean Connery just looks too old to be playing this part, sorry Sean but the grey only looked good in Red October. Props for being able to work with what you were given though.
Secondly, this in an adaptation of Thunderball, a mediocre film in itself.  There was nothing truly great about Thunderball so why remake it?
Third, Rowan Atkinson always plays a hell of a part in any movie but this one...nu uh. His potrayal of Nigel is more of an interruption than anything.

I could go on and on, but the is no reason to pick apart this movie.  Bottom line, its boring.  There is no spark or magic in it like other Bond films.  The characters are ill-conceived and the plot is the same old SPECTRE crap.  None of the dark Bond or comic relief Bond no Bondness (haha new word) what so ever.

Still, it moves at a good pace, the jokes are OK, the villians are fairly sinister, Kim Basinger gives a passable performance, and if you're not comparing it to other Bond films, it is pretty good.

Even at its worst, Bond is still better than most.

873307,4,6304406096,"1983 was a big year; especially for movies with 3s (Return of the Jedi, Superman, Jaws and even this, Connery's third final Bond film). Not only that, it was the Battle of the Bonds. EON Productions ""official"" Roger Moore film Octopussy vs. the triumphant return of Sean Connery in this ""unofficial"" remake of Thunderball (due to a lawsuit of Kevin McClory against Ian Fleming then Cubby Broccoli). Though many plot elements are similar (the theft of two nuclear warheads, SPECTRE, Domino, etc.), there are also a lot of differences. Largo (played by Klaus Maria Brandauer) is a philanthropist, whose vessel The Flying Saucer (the English translation of Largo's boat from Thunderball Disco Volante) is a fully functional villain hideout, which is one of the pluses of the film. Another plus is to the characterization of Largo. In the first film, he was more intimidating and involved. In this, he's slightly insane (even admitting to it in one of my favorite scenes). But he's also involved and very sophisticated, who doesn't let Bond's antics seem to bother him as much as in Thunderball. Domino (played by Kim Basinger) I'm kind of on the fence. In this she pretty much wants to be with Largo (though insinuating earlier that she might leave him, though only playfully bringing it up) and doesn't seem to mind being his mistress until Bond tells her about the death of her brother. In Thunderball, she's much more vulnerable and emotional towards Bond and actually doesn't like being kept around by Largo. And when it comes to evil henchwomen, Fiona Volpe wins out over Fatima Blush (played by Barbara Carrera). Carrera plays Blush to over the top but she does mix elements of Volpe and future Bond bad girl, Xenia Onatopp. As far as action goes, this ones very light on it. The fight in the health spa could've been trimmed a bit. And even though the motorcycle chase doesn't have any gadgets, its still quite exciting. And the final assault on Largo is also quite fun and exciting, saving the big explosvies for the finale. And lastly, music wise, this is near the bottom of my list (but above DAD and QOS). The music is jazzier and can be, at least to me, quite obnoxious. It doesn't seem like a Bond score at all (which may be the effect they were going for anyway, but at least David Niven's Casino Royale had a big brassy score. Coincidentally Herb Alpert, who played the theme of that film) does have a solo in the end credits). And Lani Hall's voice I just don't like, she sounds off key sometimes to me.

It's the first title in that format I've seen that doesn't look smashing. I don't know whether it's the source print or laziness, but this is a grainy, unremarkable DVD, appropriate for a very unremarkable Bond film. Yes, it's nice to see Sean Connery back as 007, but the tone is very jokey, a la Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home and this is the most dated Bond of all.

Typically, the secret agent lives in an unchanging universe of beautiful women, lavish resorts, expensive cars and dry martinis. But in Never Say Never Again, the real world intrudes to an unpleasant degree. Poor Kim Basinger is seen doing aerobics and kicking up her heels at every opportunity. Worse, when Bond is following her in a casino, she leaves the main area and walks into a video parlor and Bond has to stand next to a bleeeping and blurping video game while trying to look suave. It's cheesy and awful and pained in a way even the late Roger Moore entries never were. There's tongue in cheek and then there's tongue on the ground in embarrassment.

Unfortunately, the filmmakers had to recycle the story of Thunderball one of the best of the EON series and a peerless production.  Once the story gets going, the proceedings just aren't very convincing. Indeed, things here somehow manage to look even more dated and tacky than the Moore movies made around the same time.  There's a ""tense"" video game face-off with the villain that was probably dated when the film first screened and is ridiculous now.  (There's also a terrible 80s era VH1 theme.)  The film meanders on to a forgettable conclusion, especially when measured against the original film.  The documentaries and director's commentary on the DVD make no bones about the film's flaws.

873353,4,6304406096,"Never Say Never Again is an unofficial, non-EON Bond film that was released in 1983, directed by Irvin Kershner. The film stars Sean Connery, Kim Basinger, Edward Fox, Max Von Sydow, Alec McCowan, Bernie Casey, and Klaus Maria Brandauer. The musical score is composed by Michel LeGrand, and the title tune is sung by Lani Hall.

A little history lesson for the unfamiliar. In the late 50s, Ian Fleming had written several James Bond novels, and was desperately trying to make a film out of one of them. These attempts never quite worked and were met with skepticism, so Fleming teamed up with Kevin McClory, a brilliant writer. The two created a screenplay, but Fleming had it turned into the next Bond Novel (Thunderball) at the=2 0insistence of his publishers. This caused McClory to start a series of legal battles that continued well after Fleming's death, and even rambled on in some shape or form until McClory's death in 2006. McClory won the rights to make his own Bond film after ten years from Thunderball's theatrical release had elapsed. What resulted was 1983's Never Say Never Again, an unofficial, non-EON film that brought Sean Connery back to the role. The title was a joke on Connery saying he would ""Never Again"" play Bond (this story may not be a hundred percent accurate and may omit some major details, but it should give you a general idea of how this film came to be.)

It is also due to McClory's owning the rights to the SPECTRE organization and the Blofeld character that they never appeared in most of the post-60s Bond films.

As you probably guessed, the plot is more-or-less identical to Thunderball. Bond heads down to the islands to foil a SPECTRE plot, which involves the terror organization hijacking nuclear weapons and holding the world hostage. Bond has aged, and is more of an instructor than anything now - but following a health spa visit, he finds some intriguing details that lead him straight into the fire. Teaming up with long-time CIA buddy Felix Leiter, Bond sets out to deal with SPECTRE by any means necessary.

This film gets a bad reputation for no good reason. Just because it's not an official EON production doesn't make it an inferior work. Hell, it's better than at least half of the EON movies. Sean Connery plays Bond here very well, despite his age, and actually puts a new and interesting spin on the character, making him more human. He seems to want to retire and even (gasp!) eventually settle down with his leading lady. There are some g reat performances here, and it's great to see that this take on the Thunderball story makes Felix Leiter, played brilliantly here by Bernie Casey, a more important character (see? Casino Royale wasn't the first film to feature an African-American Felix Leiter!) Yes, some scenes do feel a bit dated, and in a few areas it lacks the classic Bond touch only EON could do.

But all in all, this is a more-than-worthy Bond title. Doesn't quite rise to the heights of the sixties Bonds, or even the original Thunderball, but it's better than just about anything that came after, including nearly every Roger Moore film. The film came out the same year as Octopussy, and while that film grossed more, Never Say Never Again is by far the superior movie. It was great to see Connery get one last shot at glory, and he does it nicely. Strongly recommended, Never Say Never Again gets 4 stars out of 5 (though I wouldn't put this one quite as high on the Bond pedestal as most the EON films I give 4 stars to. Do esn't mean it's not great though.)

Let me start by saying that Never Say Never Again, as an unofficial film, never got the Lowry Digital Images treatment that the official movies did. As such, home video releases of the movie have always been hit-and-miss affairs. This marks the first attempt to actually make the movie look decent, and for the most part, it succeeds. There's some print damage and dirt here and there, and grain does spike heavily in a few scenes. Likewise, the increased definition makes blue screen a nd rear projection work all the more obvious. But as a whole, this is the best Never Say Never Again has ever looked and sounded, and given its nature and history, it isn't likely it will ever get a better transfer than this. There's more good than bad points about the transfer, though.

Again, not an abundance of material here since it's not an official film and has never been given the Ultimate Edition treatment. But unlike older versions of the film, at least there is SOME bonus content here. Director Irvin Kershner (you may remember him as the director of The Empire Strikes Back, the finest film in the Star Wars series) and a Bond historian team up for a commentary, which is an enlightening listen. Four featurettes are included, while short they re a worthwhile view for the film. Topping it all off is a photo gallery. No, not a great collection of features, but I'm glad they bothered putting anything on here. It's at least an improvement over the bare-bones releases of the movie we've endured for so long.

Don't say ""Never"" to when you'll watch this film. Official or unofficial, it's a damn good classic Bond picture. Connery's last outing as 007 is an underrated classic that is waiting to be discovered, or in some cases, rediscovered. Don't pass this one by.",1241654400,14,5311,4.672727272727273

873355,3,6304406096,"For years I have had questions about Never Say Never Again that remained unanswered for lack of special features or director's commentary to explain some of the elements in this film. Finally, we hear from the director and a Bond historian about many of the backstories about how this renegade Bond film was made, and the many challenges the producers had to overcome to complete this film. I never realized just how much of a nail-biter it was for the producers to crank out a coherent movie due to all the script, logistical, budget, and legal issues that dogged the film every step of the way.
But most of all, I really wanted to understand how the AWFUL musical score got added to this film. It was really a by-product of the low-budget and chaotic schedule to get the film completed that such a counterproductive score was added. Irvin Kirschner did not approve of the score that Michel Legrand produced because it failed to convey the proper on-screen emotion, but it was too late in the production cycle and there was no money available to commission a new score. It was interesting to note that Legrand has more history and comfort writing songs than a theatrical score, and it showed clearly in this film. It was a huge editing challenge to mix and move the music that they had to scenes of the movie.

To my surprise and disappointment, the director and some other crew members had wanted Howard Shore to create the music, but some unnamed other producers were against it for reasons unexplained (probably money). If only a more mainstream composer had created the score, it would have lifted Never Say Never Again to a whole new level. The irritating music is a constant negative throughout the movie and undermines scene after scene. The opening title sequence is marred by the terrible title track, and the main NSNA theme is so melancholy and of such poor sound quality that it gives the whole movie a B-movie feel.

Another fact revealed in the commentary is how ruthlessly the Broccolis fought this movie in court. They literally dragged Jack Schwartzmann into court almost daily during production of NSNA to dispute script changes that the Broccolis claimed were outside the scope of the allowable screenplay. Somehow, the Broccolis were getting information about all the script changes as they happened to fuel their complaints in court.

I appreciate the candor that Kirschner relates in the commentary about the musical score issues, and some other production problems, that explain some of the forces that kept NSNA from being a truly great film. At least I feel better knowing they tried to make the best film they could, and indeed, made a better film than they had any right to considering the constant budget and legal issues that dogged the film.

With the exception of Kim Basinger, who looks great in this film, the actors did a superb job in this movie. I think this was Sean's best performance as Bond besides From Russia with Love. And as others have noted, he looked much more fit in this film than in Diamonds are Forever 12 years before. He deserves a lot of credit for returning to Bond and delivering a performance with the right balance of strength, wit, and acknowledgement of age.

Oh, and don't miss Rowan Atkinson as Bond's contact in Nassau. Mr. Bean was never so funny.",1240272000,29,3312,4.75304347826087

The pciture quality on this disc is great, BUT if you recall watching this on cable all those years ago (they wore this movie out), then even on BD, you will be reminded of a picture that looked similar to back then.  While it is in HD and good, it still has that haze or slight dullness to the picture that you recall.  Even on BD, whenever I see a film from the middle of the 1980s' (usually 1983-1988), I see this haze or slight dullness/smoothness in the picture that was a clearly about the medium or type of film used then.  Don't get me wrong, it is still detailed and 3-D (especially on a Panasonic Blu-Ray), just looking like film stock.

Along with the picture is some of the same type of sound from that era as well.  You know, that un-EQ'd sound where there is a lot of bass and mids, but lower treble.  While better on BD, it still has those traits.  I have noticed this on Lethal Weapons as well.  They clearly fixed it as much as they could, but it is not a like a fix on the remaster Terminator 1 BD where that is how redone audio should be done.

On the positive side, there was plenty of unique action scenes, particularly early on, and the two villains were interesting. I thought Klaus Maria Brandauer was the more intriguing of the two because he was so low-key and looked the ""nice guy next door."" He wasn't your normal Bond villain.

This had plenty of ""skin,"" for a PG movie, especially with Kim Basinger starring, never being an actress known for hiding her figure.  All in all, it's a ""fair"" Bond and nothing else.

873405,2,6304406096,"At the time of this film's release, the critics went absolutely bananas about Connery's return as Bond.  One critic, in a moment of pure insanity, declared it the best Bond film since ""From Russia, With Love.""  The critics sneered at the Moore Bond film released earlier that summer ""Octopussy.""  When it was released on videotape several months later, the critics continued to fall all over themselves in praise.
The film has since been reevaluated and now, 26 years later, it is now recognized for what it really was: a mediocre and totally unnecessary remake of the far superior ""Thunderball.""
There have been numerous books detailing its making and we now find that Warner Bros. was ready to pull the plug on this tired mess of a film and it took Connery stepping in and taking control that ennabled the film to be finished and released.
Look lets face it: Connery was the best and still is the best James Bond.  The film does also have a nice supporting cast: Klaus Maria Brandauer is an enjoyably insane Largo, Barbara Carrera is also outlandishly nuts, Kim Basinger looks good as Domino, Edward Fox is a pompous M and Max Von Sydow is given little to do as Blofeld.
The problem is that the film is totally unnecessary, there are no scenes that improve on ""Thunderball.""  ""Thunderball"" had the greatest underwater fight scene between the US Marines and Blofeld's stooges at the film's conclusion, it still has not been improved upon in any underwater film.  This film does not even attempt to improve upon it: the underwater confrontation between Bond and Largo is a confused mess wherein one cannot even tell who is who.  This is indicative of all the action in the film and the entire film itself.
This film is a mess, made solely to have Connery's name in a Bond film again.  The much maligned (at the time) Moore Bond film ""Octopussy"" was far more exciting and enjoyable.  Justice was served when the Moore Bond film made more money than Never Say Never Again. Moore even mentions the satisfaction that gave him in his recently published autobiograpy.
As stated previously, Never Say Never Again is now finally being recognized for the mediocrity that it always was, see the original Bond classic ""Thunderball"" instead.",1237680000,6,2229,4.798955613577023
873406,3,6304406096,"At once the victim of impossible expectations after years of false starts and rumors about Connery's return to Bondage and also a breath of fresh air as the Roger Moore Bond films increasingly floundered, Never Say Never Again was a welcome riposte to the worst excesses of the EON franchise in 1983, but time hasn't been that kind to it. There are certainly some horrible miscalculations, Carrera's cartoonish villainess Fatima Blush (like Faye Dunaway on steroids), Edward Fox's self-parody as M, Pamela Salem's moronic Moneypenny and an embarrassingly over-the-top Rowan Atkinson's horribly unfunny Nigel Small-Fawcett among them, not to mention that problematic and much-despised easy listening score from Michel Legrand.

A famously troubled production, with Cubby Broccoli frightening studios, investors and co-stars away through years of lawsuits and Connery taking against the film's inexperienced producer Jack Schwartzman so violently that he would reportedly hide whenever the actor came anywhere near his office, most of the scars aren't visible in the finished product. Thankfully the worst excesses of the legendary unfilmed but sadly rather silly and OTT script Connery and Len Deighton penned in the early 70s, Warhead (which climaxed with a hang-glider attack on the Statue of Liberty and boasted a villain with his own underwater lair), were also toned down, albeit largely for budget reasons. With only a watered-down version of their radio-controlled sharks remaining, this version is at least a little more grounded than the rampant silliness that had seen the Bonds stray unrecognisably far from their roots in Ian Fleming's novels. Despite uncredited co-writers Ian La Fresnais and Dick Clements pilfering their earlier movie spinoff of Porridge for some of the jokes, the more streamlined screenplay flows better than Thunderball, which was always the clunkiest of Bond scripts in its desperation to throw everything including the kitchen sink into the mix, but it's also less fun. Odder still is the very American feel to the film, with a clean, spare look that's uncomfortably at odds with Connery's previous outings.

On the plus side, Klaus Maria Brandauer is particularly good as Largo, Bernie Casey brings an easy familiarity to his role that makes him one of the best of the many Felix Leiters in Connery's tenure, and Alec McCowen and Max Von Sydow are fine in undemanding parts while Robert Rietty, who voiced Largo in Thunderball as well as numerous other Bond characters over the years, turns up briefly onscreen for a change. It's also thankfully light on the gadgets that got particularly out of control in the EON series during the 80s and the action scenes are for the most part well-handled, with an excellent fight with Pat Roach the standout despite a particularly lame gag ending. Enjoyable but no enduring classic.

I guess because they stray a bit from the norm.  This one's maligned because it's not an ""official"" James Bond film.  It's got a few faults, but those are heavily outweighed by the good.  In fact, I find myself wanting to re-watch this one more than quite a few other Bond films.  It's very refreshing seeing Bond as a human being.  Connery's body, like his car, shows wear, but as he puts it best, ""it's still in pretty good shape.""  In fact, the fights in this one are very believable.  Sean has a tough time of it in many situations and has to actually think his way out of the box which is extremely refreshing.  I've always found real guys struggling to fight their way out of tough situations more exciting than super hero types versus human punching bags which is all too prevalent in films.  Here's a quick list of the bad just to get it over with (and to prove I'm not one of those love all Sean Connery Bond guys): no Monty Norman Bond theme (man! but they didn't have the rights), the actor playing M plays it mockingly, Rowan Atkinson (whom I absolutely adore) is completely out of place as a cartoonish doofus in what is overall a relatively serious entry, not Desmond Llewelyn as Q, some may find the video game scene dated, some may find the running time a little long.  Now for the good (oh, yeah!): Connery is fantastic (human, charming, witty, tough, etc.), Barbara Carrera creates one of the sexiest and most wicked Bond villainesses ever, Kim Basinger is smokin' hot, Brandauer's Largo (the main baddie) is one of the slimiest and realistic Bond villain's in history, gorgeous locations and beautiful underwater photography, suspenseful shark scene, the exploding pen (boom!), a terrific opening twist, witty one-liners spoken to perfection by Connery (""I made you all wet."", ""Yes, but my martini's still dry.""; ""Mr. Bond, I need a urine sample.  Could you fill this beaker for me?"", ""From here?""; ""You know that making love to Fatima was the greatest pleasure of your life."", ""Well, to be perfectly honest, there was this girl in Philadelphia..."", ""SHUT UP!"", ETC.).  If you haven't seen this one, definitely check it out.  It's a blast!",1236729600,2,2309,4.650246305418719
873496,4,6304406096,"Yes, the year was 1983 and Connery, Sean Connery, was back - back in action as James Bond, secret agent 007. Well, the movie, in and of itself, was certainly better than its official franchise competition ""Octopussy."" However, it could have and should have been even better. A long and difficult project from the beginning, it had the good fortune to have Connery as its main attribute. And here he is in fine form looking much fitter, in fact, than he did in the 1971 ""Diamonds Are Forever."" The initial half hour is a breeze that unfortunately the movie cannot sustain in its entirety. There are many fine moments interspersed thereafter but the overall translation of storyline to screen suffers a bit in the execution. Nice touches abound but definite improvements would have been welcome in the way of certain character portrayals along with tighter editing as the film progresses. As previously noted, the Michel Legrand score does not even approach the quality level of John Barry's work. However, with the exception of a few lame and inappropriate cues, it really is not all that terrible. An interesting note is that the original theme song (as sung by Phyllis Hyman) had to be shelved due to legal reasons. A very catchy and Bond-like tune, it is not available as a special feature in this re-release. Try an Amazon.com MP3 download if you are interested. Overall, ""Never Say Never Again"" is a fine entertainment that seems (now that the official franchise has eschewed many of its trademark trappings) more in sync than ever before with the entire series.",1236384000,3,1566,4.868913857677903
873497,4,6304406096,"The result of Kevin McClory's lawsuit against Ian Fleming (and much later Cubby Broccoli) over THUNDERBALL, it has Sean Connery returning to harness as Commander James Bond 12 years after departing the series. A film that had a torturous history. Originally announced in 1976 as JAMES BOND OF THE SECRET SERVICE (McClory's agreement with Cubby Broccoli & Harry Saltzman called for him to be able to remake the story 10 years after THUNDERBALL's release -- some have speculated that the two Bond producers didn't believe the character would survive that long. Connery once described Broccoli & Saltzman as ""Two guys sitting across a desk, looking at each other and each one thinking, 'That bugger's got half what should all be mine.'""), he was promptly sued by Broccoli & company. Later Sean Connery would come on board with British Spy novelist Len Deighton (THE IPCRESS FILE, FUNERAL IN BERLIN, et al) to write a new screen treatment now called WARHEAD. Connery even went on a scouting trip to NYC to check out locations (including the Statue of Liberty). As legal entanglements dragged on, McClory eventually sold the rights to Hollywood lawyer (and Talia Shire's husband) Jack Schwartzman. The film managed to lure Connery back for a reported $3 or $4 million. Basically using the THUNDERBALL scenario (legally, it couldn't stray too far from the original story) NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN is a curious film. While it works when Connery is on screen (and he is alot), somehow it isn't totally satisfying. It lacks the sense of urgency and worldwide menace that the original had. The Legrand score stinks (the fault of Sean Connery who insisted on him), the finale lacks the drama epic scope of the original underwater battle, Kim Bassinger is lovely but lack Claudine Auger's charm; Klaus Maria Brandeur -- a fine actor -- is interesting as Largo but everything seems less than the original. Of standout mention: Barbara Carrera as Fatima Blush -- sexy and murderously deranged. However her character departs half-way through the film. Edward Fox as M doesn't make it, Bernie Casey as Felix Leiter is fine but Pamela Salem is a weak Moneypenny. Rowan Atkinson, a fine comedian, is completely absurd as British Embawsy nebbish Nigel Small-Fawcett. Some nice touches: Aftering water sking into Bond's arms at a Bahaman bar...
Fatima Blush: I've made you all wet!
Bond: Yes, but my martini is still dry.
Released the same year as the Eon series 13th outing, OCTOPUSSY, the Moore film made more money. Also of note, the same year George Lazenby played a character only referred to as ""JB"" in THE RETURN OF THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E. So all three of the guys who had -- up to that point played 007 -- were all doing so again somewhere in the world! Besides a new transfer there is audio commentary by director Irvin Kershner and 007 scholar Steven Jay Rubin (THE JAMES BOND FILMS: A BEHIND THE SCENES HISTORY), featurettes on the road to NSNA and a look at Connery's return.

873498,5,6304406096,"The special features on this Blu-ray release are as follows:
Commentary with Director Irvin Kershner and James Bond Historian Steven Jay Rubin (the author of THE JAMES BOND FILMS: A BEHIND THE SCENES HISTORY). This is the primary special feature and an interesting listen, even though Kershner does resort to describing the on-screen action. Anyone who heard Kershner's commentary for ""The Empire Strikes Back"" (the best of all the Star Wars commentaries IMO) will not be surprised. Kershner is engaging and amiable and Rubin provides a historical perspective (while trying to keep Kershner on-topic) in what is overall a fun track.
Three featurettes are presented arguably the most valuable of which is ""The Big Gamble"" (16:24) which covers much of the legal background to the movie production and the history of the production. Included in this documentary are new on-screen interviews with Rubin, Kershner, screenwriters Lorenzo Semple, Jr. (who left the movie midway through), Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais (who finished the script) and actress Barbara Carrera (who still looks incredible). Also included are interviews with actress Talia Shire (the wife of late producer Jack Schwartzman, but better known as Rocky's wife in ROCKY) and Schwartzman's son John.
Also present are ""Sean is Back"" (8:04) which features Kershner, Carrera and Schwartzman discussing how wonderful Connery is as an actor and how he helped the movie to get made and ""The Girls of Never Say Never Again"" (10:07) which covers the casting of the actresses. As a fan of Carrera's I was interested to learn that her original role was much smaller (to her chagrin) until writers Clement and La Frenais entered and that the hat she wears in the movie was full of small weapons.
In addition are The Theatrical Trailer (1:27) and a Photo Gallery that includes 62 still photos including shots from the movie, publicity poses and some behind-the-scenes shots.
The picture quality as you would expect is the best the movie has ever appeared in on home video. There are a couple of instances of print dirt and scratches, but overall the quality, particularly in terms of contrast, is an improvement over all previous incarnations of the movie.
One area where this release scores top marks is in the audio department, this is largely thanks to an impressive 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio encoding combined with some extensive audio remixing. Dialogue is situated squarely in the center channel with a number of rear directional effects in the action sequences.
When Kevin McClory teamed up with the Eon company to make the movie Thunderball in 1965 he was contractually obliged not to exercise his rights to the James Bond character for ten years, Sure enough in 1975 McClory started pitching a 007 script titled Warhead to all the competing studios, but it wasn't until 1983 that Never Say Never Again actually made it to the silver screen opening opposite the inane Roger Moore vehicle Octopussy. Never Say Never Again (a title suggested by Sean Connery's wife) has on display a variation of the plot that McClory had produced over 20 years earlier.
Faced with not being able to include the iconic familiar gun-barrel sequence at the beginning of their 1983 Bond movie, Taliafilm (named after Shire) had to cone up with their own graphic image. What they decided upon gives the first clue that we are about to experience something different, a breath of fresh air and a good kick up the rear end to a series of movies that had become stale through resorting to self-parody and recycled dialogue and villainy.
Yes, NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN is a retelling of the THUNDERBALL storylines worked out between Fleming, Bryce, Whittingham and McClory. It's technically speaking not a remake of the 1965 picture though, but a different version of the story using characters that appeared in the earlier drafts (such as Fatima Blush).
And from the moment the screen fills up with all those 007's and the audience is drawn in, we know right away that Connery is back and better than ever, and looking much fitter than he did in DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER.
The title song has been attacked by 007 fans over the years, but I actually like it quite a lot (in direct comparison with the rest of the admittedly rather limp soundtrack which was a rushed subpar effort with a production running low on funds). I have found myself over the past 20-plus years humming the theme song to myself (sometimes at the most inopportune moments) and so it has obviously become seared into my consciousness as only a catchy tune can.
And here we come to what is the 1983 movie's pretitle sequence. But instead of interrupting the flow of the story with yet more images of nude women and silly fluorescent effects the titles play out for the action allowing the audience to immediately find its feet and settle into the pace of this thrilling picture.
Of course it's not the first time that we have seen Bond killed off in the opening minutes. We saw it first at the hands of Red Grant in 1963's FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE and then again just four years later in YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE. Here Bond is on a training mission and for those with keen eyes its really quite obvious (no muzzle fire from 007's gun). As such it works a little better in the little details, and when 007 rescues the leggy millionaires daughter held captive she plunges a knife into him.
It is at this point that the factor of a new M really pays off. We see Edward Fox sternly watching the exercise on tape. We see another unidentified character (presumably Tanner). Its not until the very last minute that Connery's 007 is revealed - alive and well.
Following on from a dressing down from M is one of my favorite sequences in the movie - namely Shrublands. It's a favorite of mine because we really get introduced to my favorite character in the movie Fatima Blush, a character included in the aborted 1950s scripts. The 1965 movie has Fiona Volpe, but Volpe lacked the super-charged charisma, biting wit and ego-maniacal psychotic nature that Barbara Carrera simply oozes as Blush.
Look at the tenderness she shows to Jack, followed immediately by her bashing his head against the wall. Witness her dispatching of Jack and then crooning over her pet snake, and who can forget her final confrontation with 007 - ""guess where you get the first one.""
Carrera steals every scene she is in. She dances on her way to kill Bonds French ally and like a black widow spider she seduces 007 and then attempts to kill him with a device to attract a special group of sharks attached to his air tanks.
The second highlight is the appearance of Indiana Jones alum Pat Roach as Count Lippe. Who cannot appreciate and revel in the fun fight in which Roach's Lippe plays the indestructible Jaws role, minus the embarrassing buffoonery that Richard Kiel brought to the EON franchise. Bond throws everything at Lippe to no avail and then in an amusing conclusion the character is blinded by Bond's urine falling back into a collection of glass cylinders and test tubes.
Connery's reaction is classic.
In an attempt perhaps to counter the familiarity of the group of has-been actors inhabiting the SIS offices in the EON series at the time, this Connery movie has the most impressive list of actors to inhabit any Bond movie. In addition to the already mentioned Connery, Fox, Carrera and Roach we also have the incredible Klaus Maria Brandeur as Largo, the revered Max Von Sydow and Bernie Casey as a black Felix Leiter (hey, why not?!).
Brandeur plays Largo with just the right amount of understated menace and Casey is probably the second best Leiter of the series (after Hedison). You really get the feeling that he and Connery's 007 are the best of buddies, their interactions and playful barbs appear genuinely affectionate and respectful of the other,
The one A-list actor who really lets down the rest of the team is Kim Basinger. She admittedly didn't have much to go on, but it is in this one respect that Claudine Auger and the 1965 EON effort takes the honors.
Some have said that it is with Bonds arrival in Nassau, that this movie tends to wander a little. I respectfully disagree. It is here that the majority of Carrera's scenes appear and here that Connery has his first confrontation with Largo. I have yet to really understand the computer game the two play, but it works nicely in building up some real tension and suspense (name a Moore 007 -villain scene that achieved the same level of pent up pressure - I can't). The final line from Connery - "" I wouldn't know, I've never lost"" is also probably one of the best 007 comebacks in the entire series.
Yes, this section of the movie also features some of the best dialogue, the promise of which had been ably shown in the brilliant Q-scene earlier in the picture. The lines come thick and fast and are genuinely witty in comparison with some of the gags in the Moore series of pictures. In addition Rowan Atkinson nicely doesn't outstay his welcome as comic relief and his ""don't know his mother"" line always makes me smile. Other gags that work include the cigarette lighter gag at the casino and the ""your place or mine"" bomb at the hotel.
The ending in Africa is over a little too soon and the small battle in the underground caverns lacks the scope of some of the 007 pictures. But I think it works well in the context of the rest of the picture and is not the confusing, overlong mess that really mars the 1965 effort. Its cleaner and tighter, just the way I like it.
Yes, even though Roger Moore is my favorite 007 actor, ""Never Say Never Again"" is my favorite 007 picture.
Irvin Kershner, who directed the best of the Star Wars movies, again brings us a franchises crowning achievement with a steady directing hand, incredible witty dialogue, superb performances by an amazing cast and Sean Connery returning revitalized after a 12 year absence from the role that made him famous.
It's the one 007 movie that I have watched more than any other.
After the movie was obtained by MGM-UA (the company that produces the EON production) there was talk among fans as to the possibility of the gun barrel sequence being added to make it part of the ""canon"", and indeed one fan put together a version of the movie with a gunbarrel, EON-style opening credits and traditional Bondian music that met with much acclaim in fandom.
I for one do not think that this unique James Bond 007 movie should be tampered with in that manner and equally happy to see it emerge on Blu-ray. I heartily recommend this movie.",1233619200,29,10544,4.740337506804573

873505,3,6304406096,"I wouldn't go out of my way for this if I wasn't a Bond completist, but NSNA seems to me to be a fair-to-middling Bond outing that compares favorably to its contemporary (1983) 'official' competition, OCTOPUSSY.  Despite a low budget the film doesn't feel cheap, the recycled plot is one of the better ones, and Connery, although hamming it up a bit as a middle-aged superspy, is still everybody's favorite Bond.

If you're comparing this to the early Connery, or even the Pierce Brosnan period, forget it - done at the height (depth?) of the Roger Moore period, NSNA is full of tongue-in-cheek, but handled better, IMHO, than the corny Moore scripts.  Q-Algy was less overdone than John Cleese, though James Fox's ""M"" dialogue was sometimes a bit too over-the-top, Barbara Carrera had to make do with a part that was all ham, and Rowan Atkinson - well, was Rowan Atkinson, which should tell you all you need to know about THAT!  On the other hand Klaus Maria Brandauer was a SUPERB villain; Max Von Sydow was kind of wasted in the Blofeld role, but I prefer him to Telly Savalas!?!  Kim Basinger was decent eye-candy; the rest of the roles were adequately handled.

There are some distinct weaknesses in NSNA, particularly the flat and somewhat absurd climax (why would Domino have been there at all?!?) but the fight scenes were generally good, and Brandauer rises above the material to be, IMHO, the best villain since GOLDFINGER (at least until DIE ANOTHER DAY.)

873567,4,6304406096,"1983 was ""the battle of the Bonds"". That year both Roger Moore and Sean Connery starred in two separate James Bond film, the former (Octopussy) was produced by the ""official"" makers of the Bond films while the later (Never Say Never Again) was produced ""unofficially"" by a group led by Kevin McClory who held the film rights to Thunderball. Surprisingly enough is the ""unofficial"" film that is better despite the obvious flaw of missing elements from the official films and the fact that Never Say Never Again is a remake of Thunderball.

Never Say Never Again has the distinction of sporting one of the best casts ever assembled for a Bond film. It all starts with Sean Connery, returning to the play Bond for the first time since 1971's Diamonds Are Forever. Connery might be older then he was then but he looks better here then he did in Diamonds Are Forever. Gone is the bored Bond of Diamonds and in is an older version of the Bond of the early Connery films. The Bond of Never Say Never Again is the sleek and dangerous shark of Dr. No or From Russia With Love, just a few years older. Connery's delivery of one liners and dialogue is as dead on as it ever was. The one downside to Connery's age is his believability, especially when it comes to the ladies of the film. Let's face it even Connery, despite being in top physical shape, looks as odd as Moore when he is bedding women half his age. Yet despite this believability issue, Never Say Never Again shows Connery in one of his better Bond performances and a definite improvement on his two earlier Bond performances.

Kim Bassinger plays Domino in one of her early film roles. Bassinger plays the role with considerable confidence for a relative newcomer and she makes the character believable. Bassinger holds her own against her co-stars and has considerable chemistry with them as well. In fact she may well outshine her Thunderball counter-part played by Claudine Auger.

Then there's the villain, Maximilian Largo played by Klaus Maria Brandauer. Brandauer's Largo is everything a James Bond film villain should be: suave, charming, evil and above all believable none the less. One can believe in the villain of this film, a billionaire playboy with an evil streak in him that remains well hidden. Brandauer makes the role realistic and chooses not to fall into the trap many other Bond villains have fallen into by going over the top. Brandauer plays Largo with a silent menace and charisma unseen in many adversaries of 007.

The excellent cast extends into the supporting cast as well. Barbara Carrera makes a fine henchwoman in the guise of Fatima Blush and the screen lights up when ever she appears. Max Von Sydow makes a rather nice appearance as Blofeld, though his appearance is more akin to a cameo role.  Rowan Atkinson makes an early screen appearance as Bond's bumbling contact in the Bahamas that makes for some of the best scenes in the film. With all that the highlight of the supporting cast comes from the MI6 staff from Edward Fox's M who makes for a great contrast to Bernard Lee, Pamela Salem who make s affine Moneypenny and the icing on the cake with Alec McCowen's wonderful Q. The supporting cast has a couple of misfires though in the form of Bernie Casey as Felix Leiter (the first African-American to play the role) and Gavin O'Herlihy as Jack Petachi who both seem to lack credibility in their respective roles. Otherwise this film sports one of the best casts ever assembled for a Bond film.

On top of an excellent cast the film has several other essential ingredients: good action sequences, good special effects and good direction. From the opening Central America sequence to the fight at Shrublands to the underwater sequences and motorbike chase, this is a film where the action sequences are not only great but service the plot as well for the most part.  The film also sports good special effects in terms of cruise missile models, explosions, and all the things we expect from a Bond film. Irvin Kershner, then fresh off doing The Empire Strikes Back for the Star Wars series, brings a tight sense of direction to the film especially in sequences like the substation of nuclear warheads and the subsequent theft of the cruise missiles.

Yet this film is far from perfect. Never Say Never Again is easily one of the most dated of the Bond films with its heavy use of 1980's computer sand video games.  While technology dates any film after a time, this film's heavy reliance on it, especially in the hijacking of the cruise missiles and the Domination sequence makes the film look incredibly dated some quarter of a century after its release.  The script also tends to suffer from predictability due to the very fact it's a remake of Thunderball.

Yet for its predictability the script for Never Say Never Again is pretty good.  The script sports good dialogue scenes, not a single cringe worthy one liner (how many of the Roger Moore era scripts can you say that about?), some humorous situations, and yet is watchable and tense for the most part. Once you look past he fact that it's a remake, there's quite a lot of good things in the script for the film.

Music is in fact the biggest weakness of the film. Due to the ""unofficial"" status of the film, the James Bond Theme could not be used. That said this could have shown with the right composer that a Bond score without it could work. Unfortunately first choice James Horner (fresh off Star Trek II at the time) was passed over in favor of Michael Legrand, whose score is far from adequate. Legrand's score is totally out of place in a Bond film and there is only of or two places where it actually works. To make matters worse the film is also lumbered with one of the worst title sequences ever to grace a James Bond Theme.

Yet despite being heavily dated, somewhat predicable, and having a bad score Never Say Never Again is still a good Bond film. With one of the best casts of any Bond film, good action sequences, good special effects, good direction, and some terrific dialogue. Never Say Never Again proves that ""unofficial"" isn't a bad thing.  In fact it is better then quite a few official films and is better then Octopussy and the winner of ""the battle of the Bonds"".",1219449600,7,6243,4.652450090744102
873568,4,6304406096,"You know, I saw NSNA in theatres as a young teen, and having been brought up in the Moore era, I really did not see it as a bad or good movie, just an action movie.  In later years, I kept hearing this was the orphan James Bond movie, that it really wasn't very good, and that when the Bond films were being released on VHS in the early 1990's, it was not worth looking for.  I promptly forgot about the movie's existence.

Then something happened.  Over the two successive DVD releases of Bond films over the last decade, I started remembering mysterious, hazy scenes of a chess game that caused the players to feel the pain of their decisions, with a round-faced bad guy who loved the water.  Sean Connery played the lead role.  Ooooh!  And then there was that really, sexy bad lady in (what was for 1980) a very brief bathing suit.  But what movie were these scenes from?  Oh yeah!  Never Say Never Again.  The power of negative reviews!  I decided to watch it again and yes, it did have some bizarre production values for a Bond film.  The opening music is truly awful for the scenes shown. (Irving, my Empire Strikes Back friend, what were you thinking?)

But by the end of the movie, the good plot points outweighed the bad.  There were some moments of humor...perhaps too many for a Bond film...but I didn't feel as if I wasted 2 hours of my life.  I enjoyed it.  And while I prefer the Broccoli/Salzman productions, I think seeing an alternative like this is rewarding.  Even if you don't like it as much, it's a different take.  Mind you, after many years of being a habitual fuddy-duddy, I now now enjoy trying new things and looking at different perspectives.  You may not.

873569,3,6304406096,"For many Bond fans, the return of Sean Connery in this ""unofficial"" Bond entry, was an exciting opportunity to experience the Connery magic and charisma before the earlier pre-Roger Moore years. Released in 1983, the film competed head-to-head against Moore's entry, ""Octopussy"" which, to some critics of note, one of the better Roger Moore efforts.  Obviously, this production had a more engaging cast, an entertaining story, and some good actors: Maude Adams and Louis Jourdan as Bond's nemesis than ""Never Say Never Again.""

While it's good to have Connery back, looking actually fitter than he did in ""Diamond Are Forever"" in 1971, and wearing a faultless toupee, the film manages to fall short on a number of levels.  Viewers should note, it is a different film; for instance, no gun barrel logo in the pre-credits sequence, or the familiar incidental Bond theme music we all recognize.

Bear in mind this film, in actuality, is simply a remake of Terrence Young's ""Thunderball"" (1965), that represented the apogee of the James Bond franchise. Some of the other leads turn in a respectable performance, Bernie Casey, as an African-American Felix Leiter, is adequate as is Klaus Maria Bandauer in the role of ""Maximillian Largo,"" a change from ""Emilio Largo"" from the '65 film, originally played by Adolfo Celi. But he is simply not menacing enough.  The sequence at the casino between Largo and Bond is rather odd; they play a silly tabletop video game called ""World Domination"" rather than baccarat or chemin-de-fer. Not really effective, nor does this really belong in a Bond film.

Barbara Carrera as Fatima Blush, reprises the role of Fiona Volope(Lucianna Paluzzi in ""Thunderball"") the film's femme fatale, in what could be considered an over-the-top-performance that borders on the hysterical with her outlandish costumes, hats and formal evening attire. Kim Basinger, as Domino, although lovely to look at, comes off as rather dull and uninspired. We long for an actress like the lovely former Miss. France, Claudine Auger, who, although not an actress by a long shot in the original ""Thunderball,""  managed to bring an aura of sophistication, beauty, and unavailability shared by most Bond heroines before they succumb to the charms of 007.

""M"" played by Edward Fox, is competent and irascible, but too young for the role--only illustrating how much we truly miss Bernard Lee and Lois Maxwell (Moneypenny) from the original series. In all, the film has a distinct look and pace that strikes one of a lavish made-for-tv production; not a quality Bond feature despite some exotic locations and interiors.

Despite Bond's rocket powered motorcycle, and an explosive fountain pen, the gadgets are few (thankfully), and the film is really an opportunity for Connery to prove, once again, HE is the James Bond everyone recognizes, knows, and respects above all others in the franchise's forty-five plus year history.",1215648000,2,2924,5.164904862579281

So, it was the perfect candidate for a remake, and for copyright reasons, that's just what Never Say Never Again is. And it's a welcome return for Connery as Bond.

Being made by different producers, the movie doesn't have the classic gun barrel sequence or the Maurice Binder opening credits, but it still feels like a bona fide James Bond movie, much thanks to great locations, fun gadgets and Klaus Maria Brandauer's great villain.

My main problem with Thunderball is the sleep inducing underwater sequences. Even though this movie is just as long as Thunderball, the underwater sequences are shorter, and there's more excitement before the climactic scenes (I actually enjoyed the admittedly very dated video game scene).

So I'm going to be blasphemous and say I actually enjoy this movie more than Thunderball. It's a fun movie, and a must see for all Bond fans.",1214784000,2,1112,5.607142857142857

873635,3,6304406096,"At once the victim of impossible expectations after years of false starts and rumors about Connery's return to Bondage and also a breath of fresh air as the Roger Moore Bond films increasingly floundered, Never Say Never Again was a welcome riposte to the worst excesses of the EON franchise in 1983, but time hasn't been that kind to it. There are certainly some horrible miscalculations, Carrera's cartoonish villainess Fatima Blush (like Faye Dunaway on steroids), Edward Fox's self-parody as M, Pamela Salem's moronic Moneypenny and an embarrassingly over-the-top Rowan Atkinson's horribly unfunny Nigel Small-Fawcett among them, not to mention that problematic and much-despised easy listening score from Michel Legrand.

A famously troubled production, with Cubby Broccoli frightening studios, investors and co-stars away through years of lawsuits and Connery taking against the film's inexperienced producer Jack Schwartzman so violently that he would reportedly hide whenever the actor came anywhere near his office, most of the scars aren't visible in the finished product. Thankfully the worst excesses of the legendary unfilmed but sadly rather silly and OTT script Connery and Len Deighton penned in the early 70s, Warhead (which climaxed with a hang-glider attack on the Statue of Liberty and boasted a villain with his own underwater lair), were also toned down, albeit largely for budget reasons. With only a watered-down version of their radio-controlled sharks remaining, this version is at least a little more grounded than the rampant silliness that had seen the Bonds stray unrecognisably far from their roots in Ian Fleming's novels. Despite uncredited co-writers Ian La Fresnais and Dick Clements pilfering their earlier movie spinoff of Porridge for some of the jokes, the more streamlined screenplay flows better than Thunderball, which was always the clunkiest of Bond scripts in its desperation to throw everything including the kitchen sink into the mix, but it's also less fun. Odder still is the very American feel to the film, with a clean, spare look that's uncomfortably at odds with Connery's previous outings.

On the plus side, Klaus Maria Brandauer is particularly good as Largo, Bernie Casey brings an easy familiarity to his role that makes him one of the best of the many Felix Leiters in Connery's tenure, and Alec McCowen and Max Von Sydow are fine in undemanding parts while Robert Rietty, who voiced Largo in Thunderball as well as numerous other Bond characters over the years, turns up briefly onscreen for a change. It's also thankfully light on the gadgets that got particularly out of control in the EON series during the 80s and the action scenes are for the most part well-handled, with an excellent fight with Pat Roach the standout despite a particularly lame gag ending.

Enjoyable but no enduring classic. It's worth noting that a special edition of this title will also be released some time in the future.",1202860800,,2961,5.242616033755274
873636,3,6304406096,"Even a bad James Bond movie has considerable entertainment value.  Unfortunately, Never Say Never Again IS a bad James Bond movie.

This time, SPECTRE has stolen a pair of nuclear weapons and is demanding tribute from the world's wealthiest nations.  Bond, played by Sean Connery, finds himself up against a megalomaniac and his own boss, M, who disapproves of the 00 agents.  The 00 boss disapproving of the 00's is one of a number of script elements that doesn't make much sense to the alert viewer.

Connery's acting is the only selling point of this film (Too old?  No way!)  Klaus-Mara Brandauer as Maximilian Largo is a peculiar villain that certainly comes off as mad, but not really threatening.  Barbara Carrera as Fatima Blush is more than threatening, but perhaps she is hamming it up a bit too much for the cameras.  Kim Basinger has all of the beauty of a Barbie doll, but her character, Domino Petachi has only slightly more personality than a Barbie doll.

The Bond women have all of the sex appeal that you expect, but the gadgets, the stunts, the soundtrack, and the climax all fall short.  Viewers with some passion for 007 movies will not want to miss this.  More casual viewers have better options available.",1199232000,,1228,4.740566037735849

Yet, I went to see it when it was first released & liked it. A remake of the classic ""Thunderball"", it's flawed & imperfect, but still an enjoyable film. It was great to see Sean Connery again in his ""007"" status, playing an older Bond, but one which hasn't lost his knack for adventure & romance.
While some of the trademarks are missing---understandably, since it was made outside the home studios of MGM/UA---it's the film itself that counts, and Connery makes the most of it, showing all the other Bond actors how it's done. He slips back into the role so easily that it's as if he never left.
It also benefits from a first-rate villain in actor Klaus Maria Brandauer as Largo, a baddie who's more complex than the sum of his parts. Kim Basinger--here at the beginning of her film career--plays the typical Bond babe who finds herself in a power struggle between Bond & Largo.
This is a much-maligned film that deserves a second look.",1196208000,4,1107,4.567839195979899
873639,2,6304406096,"At a time when Roger was playing Bland, James Bland... the prospect of an unofficial Bond movie enticing Sean Connery to return to the role was mouthwateringly tantalizing.  And at the time it came out in 1983, the competition was one of Moore's weakest efforts, Octopussy, making the Bond versus Bond clash seem one sided in this movies favour. Never Say Never Again has a larger budget, stronger cast and is based on an Ian Fleming story.
Alas, the end result turns out to be not much better than a parody of the earlier Bonds, and despite a strong cast the script is so clunky and obvious that the wit and panache of Bond is missing.  Worse, the music is anachronistic and dated.  Of course, for legal reasons, they could not use John Barry's timeless themes, but all the more reason one would have thought to spend more time getting the score just right for the tone of the movie. Perhaps the most serious crime of all.. it is more than a bit dull.  You find yourself waiting for an action scene to come along, then when one comes along, you wish they would get it over with.  Aside from an effective bike-chasing-car scene, no other action scene resonates after the credits have rolled.
It's not all bad.. Kim Basinger is a lithe and lovely Bond girl, and Klaus Maria Brandauer is a deliciously quirky villain.  A few scenes hold up - the dance scene when Bond tells Domino her brother is dead, the fistfight at Shrublands with Pat Roach (from Auf Wiedersehen pet), and at least we don't have the dreadful speeded up boat scene from the otherwise far superior original, `Thunderball'.
Finally, with the `official' Bond movies so well digitally remastered and sound remixed, the very poor quality of the sound mix and blemished print are all the more obvious.  Sound is very boomy and with no surround mix - speech is muffled, and I had to turn up the volume much higher than usual to hear any detail.  Aside from one trailer, there are no extras.
The worst of Moore's Bond outings can still be enjoyed, even when the grin is mixed with a groan... here though, the grin has become a fixed grimace, and the pleasures are few and far between.  Connery's charisma pulls us through without feeling obliged to give up half way through - but the temptation is never far away.

873640,3,6304406096,"I am sure that there was some bizarre legal reason why they had to re-use the plot of Thunderball -even with the same names - for Connery's return.  While I grew up on Connery's Bond and think he is by far the best (just like 60s rock is the best!!), it is beyond me why they couldn't come up with something more original for his swan song.  Roger Moore just could NEVER measure up to Connery, who is a wonderful actor, believable yet under-stated, and always adding creative detail.  Unfortunately, this is so tightly scripted and directed that little of Connery's creativity comes through.  The result is a plodding re-hash, really exactly the same story, just updated with suitably nubile younger women.  (Bassinger and Carrera are indeed wonderful and alluring, and Connery isn't awful, but he alks through this rather indifferently).

I must say I liked it, but that was because I was 9. I just went back and recently watched this movie again, and now I see the reason of the criticism (sp?) for this movie. It really is that bad. Here is my reason for hating this movie:

1. The action scenes were a joke. Camera shots too long, looks like they were edited together in 5 minutes, and lame vehicle choice for the chase scenes. The music was a joke too, instead of music to fit the mood we get Elevator jazz music! WTF!

2. This is basically a Thunderball remake, and a pretty pointless one too. There are very big changes (the burst button being on the dashboard of the bike instead of the handle WTF?), and no reason for them.

3. This was NOT the 007 I knew! This was not the smooth-talkin', flirty Bond that we got in the old and new movies! He wasn't the smart Bond who would do things his own way in Life-or-Death situations, he'd just do the old cliched escapes.

4. The dialogue is cringe-inducingly bad! Example:

Fatima: You're still wet!
007: Yes, but my Martini's still dry.

5. The music! HORRIBLE! We'd get that cliche'd DA DA DAAAAAAA music in suspenseful scenes, and some elevator jazz music in action scenes.

6. The acting was unintentionally hilarious. Kim Basinger's wooden performance had me laughing at times, and Sean Connery stinks the role BIG TIME. Rowan Atkinson sucks too, he is a funny actor, but there's one place he dosen't belong: In a 007 movie.

7. The sets look bad, the NSNA looks like it's been around for 100 years, and the whole movie looks like it was made on a budget of $20. But that's completely understandable, much of the film's budget was spent on getting Sean Connery back.

873722,1,6304406096,"Apologies to those of you who seem to actually like this film, but when I re-watched it recently after not having seen it in ten years or so, I found it to be . . . well, nearly unwatchable.

What's so bad about it?  Well, how shall I begin . . .

(1)  Sean Connery is a dud.  There can be very little doubt that Connery is THE James Bond, but here, he seems like he's just going through the motions.  To be fair, he had no decent material to play.  The only positives in the performance are the small little touches he puts in to show that he is playing an aging 007; he seems suitably worn-out at various points, and that adds a tiny layer of believability to the character that has never been there before.  But these are grace notes; by and large, Connery is stiff as a board here.

(2)  The action scenes are uninspiring.  I'm not the biggest fan of the Roger Moore Bond films, but even the worst of them have terrific action scenes.  Here, the action is strictly second-rate.

(3)  Kim Basinger and Barbara Carrera, though great to look at, give terrible performances.

(4)  There is literally no reason to see this in favor of ""Thunderball,"" of which it is a remake; the original remains one of the all-time great screen entertainments, and this remake makes ZERO improvements.  In fact, the plot merely becomes muddled.

(5)  There are a series of awful performances in supporting roles.  Rowan Atkinson's comic scenes, though brief, are painfully unfunny, not to mention out of place.  The actor playing the ""new"" M is odious; and whoever it is playing Q isn't very good, either.

(6)  The music is bad.  The title song is boring, and the score by Michel Legrand frequently sounds as if it came from a Bugs Bunny cartoon.  I couldn't care less that the James Bond theme is missing; it's not what isn't there that's bad, it's what IS there.

All in all, I'd have to say that -- unless we're counting the 1967 version of ""Casino Royale"" -- this is THE worst of the James Bond movies.  It's worth seeing if you've never seen it before . . . but that's about it, in my opinion.",1159660800,12,2082,4.382198952879581

  However, 12 years later, Sean Connery returned to be ""James Bond"" one last time in NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN.  This film is a rarity to see and is not part of the ""official"" James Bond package.  It is declared ""Unofficial"" because it was made by a different production company, not EON Productions.  You will notice how different the film is by the style it is filmed in and the original cast members were not included.
  M (Edward Fox) believes that James Bond (Sean Connery) has slowed down with age and has been put on a strict diet.  Bond reminds M that he now teaches and hasn't been used as a double 00.  Don't worry.  Bond will be right back in action as soon as he finishes his ""therapy"" with Miss Fearing (Prunella Gee).
  Blofeld (Max Von Sydow) is back in action and will use Largo (Klaus Marie Brandauer) and Fatima Blush (Barbara Carrera) to avenge James Bond.
  Bond's mission is to go to the Bahama's and get closer to Fatima Blush and in Nice he gets to massage Domino (Kim Basinger).  All in a day's work for James Bond.
  Sean Connery was 52 at the time of filming and proved he was still in vigorous form.
  This film was the longest ""James Bond"" film ever made at 2 hours, 17 minutes. Rated PG.

873774,5,6304406096,"""Never Say Never Again"" is a fantastic action thriller directed by Irvin Kershner. It is the remake of ""Thunderball"". However, it is still an enjoyable action packed adventure movie.

Sean Connery plays his role brilliantly, despite his age (53). This is vintage Sean Connery, an older, wiser and audacious man. He has not lost his touch with ladies. Kim gives a good performance as the bad guy's pal. Barbara Carrera performs her role as the sexy, clever and wicked Fatima Blush very well. Klaus Maria Brandauer is also a remarkable villain while Irvin Kershner's direction is commendable. Rowan Atkinson makes an interesting and amusing appearance.

Among some of my unforgettable scenes are the opening war-game teaser, the battle with Lippe at Shrublands, and a great motorcycle chase. Despite his age, Connery is surprisingly very fast, agile and very witty.

The plot is sound and interesting. A SPECTRE agent under the command of Ernst Blofeld infiltrates a US Air Force base located in the United Kingdom and steals two Tomahawk cruise missiles. James Bond must find them before they are detonated. The characterization is superb and I liked the ending.",1156896000,4,1161,5.132275132275132
873775,3,6304406096,"If you've gotten tired of the formula Bond movies, Never Say Never Again is an interesting change of pace. Legal battles based on the rights to the Thunderball novel led to this remake being done by a different studio than the other 007 films. They managed to bring back Sean Connery, who had said ""never again"" after finishing Diamonds Are Forever (hence the movie title).

The original Thunderball movie is still better in terms of epic scale and production values, but for me this film beats out Diamonds Are Forever and most of the Roger Moore entries. It helps that Connery still has his edge even as an older Bond, and in general it's just fun to see a different take on M, Q, Moneypenny, and the villains of SPECTRE. Unfortunately while MGM finally got the rights to this film, they refuse to acknowledge it into the regular Bond movie canon. So while the dvd cover is similar in design to the other Bond special editions, the disc has no bonus features other than a nice booklet and trailer. Oh well.

In Diamonds Are Forever, it seemed like Connery couldn't give less of a ****. Yeah, yeah I know Connery was sick and tired of playing Bond by the time Diamonds Are Forever came around, but the fact that Connery was being paid one of the highest salaries in movie history to appear in Diamonds Are Forever made his lack of effort in Diamonds Are Forever inexusable. In Never Say Never Again, even though it wasn't a ""real"" Bond movie, at least Connery did make a decent effort. Connery also seemed to be putting on some weight in Diamonds Are Forever. Considering Connery is 12 years older in Never Say Never Again than he was in Diamonds Are Forever, Connery is in pretty good physical shape in Never Say Never Again. Connery was, however, getting kind of old and wrinkly and, like I said, he's not as good as 007 as he was a couple decades before, but he really was no worse than Roger Moore was at that time-to tell you the truth, I would have rather had Connery in 1985's View To A Kill, Roger Moores last Bond movie, than Roger Moore.",1152057600,,1196,4.32

Does any of that matter a damn when you consider that it's Sean Freakin' Connery back in the role of James Bond? ABSOLUTELY NOT!  Even a not so good Connery Bond film is still better than most.  This film delivers most of the things you want out of a Bond film, and the only things it doesn't are due to copyright mumbo jumbo (the most disheartening being the famous gun-hood opening and signature music being missing, and of course, the late great Desmond Llwynne not appearing as Q). Connery is lean and mean in this one, and in fact looks better than he did in Diamonds Are Forver. And beside, this film is way better than the Roger Moore film ""Octopussy"", which was released the same year, and for some unGodly reason did better at the box office.  By this time, I think most will agree that Roger Moore was begining to wear out his welcome, and so (since it would be a few more years before the great Timothy Dalton made the role his own) it was a great time for Sir Sean to come back one more time and remind us what James Bond is all about! Cars! Women! Collateral Damage!!  And honestly, I don't think anybody who wasn't told previously would have ever even known that this wasn't and official Bond flick.

873861,3,6304406096,"I don't think anyone was more excited than I was that Sean Connery was coming back as James Bond in 1983.

The official Bond film that summer was OCTOPUSSY, the first post-RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK entry (although really showing his age by this point, Roger Moore's role was much more active and that film did have some cool action sequences).  But I was really looking forward to NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN.

The film starts out well enough.  The gun barrel opening and signature music are sadly missing here, but Connery looks great and the touches of humor--supplied by Lorenzo Semple, Jr. (who wrote some of the ""Batman"" series campiest and funniest episodes)--set the right mood.

But the movie runs out of steam.  Barbara Carrera's character is infinitely more interesting than Kim Basinger's basic bimbo, so the movie suffers when her scenes end.  I'd hoped, since this was a one-shot deal, that Connery would finally face Ernst Stavro Blofeld, but the script remains too faithful to the basic framework of THUNDERBALL.

I'd read an interview with Connery and he said the filming of NEVER SAY NEVER was a disaster, that it was more frustrating than his six previous Bond films put together.  He was even called back to shoot more scenes so the movie would make sense.

It's too bad.

Because the original 007 deserved much better.

(Useless trivia: Klaus Maria Brandeur, who plays Largo, was originally cast to play the Russian sub commander in THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER in 1990--but was replaced by Sean Connery after a scheduling conflict.  I thought that was interesting since they played hero and villian in this movie seven years before).",1115251200,,1642,4.863309352517986
873862,3,6304406096,"This movie was released in 1983 soon after the release of the Roger Moore Bond film ""Octopussy.""  While fans may have welcomed Sean Connery's return to the screen as James Bond, this ""unofficial"" Bond film falls somewhat flat, and ties it with some of the weakest Bond films in the series.  This movie is a re-working of the 1965 film ""Thunderball.""  This film proves the adage of leaving well enough alone.  While there are plot aspects of this movie that are improvements over the original, this movie does not have the depth or quality of the original.

We remember the essence of the plot.  Bad guys steal two nuclear weapons from the good guys, and black mail the good guys for their return.  Jack Petachi is the greedy drug-addicted U.S. Air Force officer who aids S.P.E.C.T.R.E. in stealing the nuclear warheads.  Jack's sister Domino is played this time by Kim Basinger.  Largo masterminds the theft and is effectively played by Klaus Maria Brandauer.  Brandauer's Largo is psychopathic compared to Adolpho Celi's business-like Largo.  I found Brandauer's Largo scarier because psychopaths are scary people, but I have always wondered how much any organization, even criminal organizations, could trust a psychopath.

In the tradition of other James Bond movies we have Fatima Blush, played by Barbara Carrera.  Fatima is a good match for Largo in this version.  She enjoys killing, but around Largo she seems almost like a dog on a leash.  Felix Leiter is African-American in this version, well played by veteran actor Bernie Casey.  M (Edward Fox), Q (Alec McCowen) and Miss Moneypenny (Pamela Salem) are also present.

This movie feels as though it is from some other dimension.  When Bond visits Q it is as though there have been no double oh agents for a long time.  There is an air of budget cuts.  Q's lab, quite excellent in the ""official"" films, appears to be a machine shop in the basement of some building, looking cheesy.  When Q asks Bond whether there will be gratuitous sex and violence, I was not sure whether I was appalled or annoyed.  I got the impression that early portions of this film were snubs or poking fun at the ""official"" movies.  M's character in this movie was absolutely awful.  In the other Bond films M is always quite dour, focused on the interests of Great Britain.  Edward Fox's M seems somewhat pompous and political; this may be another snub that I did not understand.

There were portions of the movie that I liked.  Largo's boat in this movie was extremely sophisticated, though it did not split apart like Largo's boat in ""Thunderball"" did.  Bond's motorcycle was also cool, though the cars in the other Bond films were better.  I also thought where Bond and Domino were taken in North Africa was well done, and the auction for Domino was excellent, as was Bond's rescue of Domino.

There were a few other unusual items in this movie.  The cave set near the end looked more like Indiana Jones than James Bond.  There are also a few places where the movie drags just a little, very unusual for a Bond film as they are usually plotted for continuous action.  There were also strange things that the movie failed to explain.  For example, where did a U.S. helicopter come from to drop Bond into the well?  It should have been an aircraft carrier, but in this Bond film the producer did not bother to explain the details.  Another question, since when do U.S. submarines carry cannons?  The gun firing from the submarine did not look very realistic, since it was more than likely drawn in after the fact.  The whole discussion of budget with respect to Q's branch was likely to help explain why the movie had so few special effects, but it makes the movie come across as cheap.

Being a completist, I had to have this Bond movie.  However, it is one of the lesser movies in the series.  The movie has moments that keep it solidly in the three star range, but there is a lot of two star material here.  Even the DVD release was cheap, with only a trailer on my edition, though the version I have is in widescreen.

This movie probably should never have been made.  Those who are collecting the Bond films will want it, as will those who want all the Sean Connery films.  However, there are better Connery Bond films, and there are much better Connery movies.  I admit that I have watched this movie several times, but it always fails to impress me.",1111795200,2,4393,4.661458333333333
873863,4,6304406096,"I watched this movie and I have also seen ""Thunderball"", of which this is a remake and I must say I prefer this one by far.

- Maximilian Largo is much better in this one than in ""Thunderball"", he actually looks like a real criminal mastermind rather than an Austin Powers caricature

- The chicks are at least as good, especially Bond's beautiful and dangerous lady opponent

- It doesn't feature the lenghty and boring underwater scenes + the disturbing shrill screaching and painful sound effects of Thunderball

- The technical equipment is more up-to-date and believable than in Thunderball, I actually liked the video game that gives you electric shocks, great idea

- The locations are beautiful, not half of the time filmed in semi-darkness where you can hardly see anything, as is the case in Thunderball

- Fast paced action and plenty of humour, especially in the first half of the film

The only real point of criticism I have is that the end is too drawn out and the actors appear a bit unmotivated towards the end. All in all a great Bond movie and I must say, my favourite of all the Connery Bonds. I know this is sure to be an unpopular opinion here, but the 1960s Bonds all appear either technically flawed, everything has a movie set plastic look, or they are ordinary spy movies without the typical Bond extras.",1111276800,4,1330,4.610169491525424

His acting is good as always, but it is like watching him in a remake of ""Hunt for Red October"". What's the point? I liked the original ""Thunderball"" but I don't need to see a remake that lacks inspiration.

Although i thought that the character of th villain (Now what was his name) could have been refined a little but the women all in all made up for it. I do agree that this was quite a raunchy Bond movie and i must say that Barbara Carrera does a wonderful job as Fatima Blush.

Then again, up to that point, I liked every James Bond movie I'd seen (which had been all of them except for the Pierce Brosnan pictures). But Never Say Never Again was one I was curious to give a second look, mostly because all this talk of Harrison Ford returning as Indiana Jones made me curious to see how Sean Connery fared as the superspy action hero in his fifties. The answer, not very well (though Ford at his current age appears in better shape than Connery was at the time), and if this were an official Bond entry, it'd be in contention with Moonraker and Live and Let Die as the worst of the series.
The film is a virtual remake of Thunderball; Bond is up against madman Largo, a megalomaniac who has a plan for worldwide blackmail by stealing two American nuclear warheads. On his side is Blofeld (Max Van Sydow) and the sultry, but dangerous femme fatale Fatima Blush (Barbara Carrera). Bond eventually gains the services of Largo's girlfriend, Domino Petachi (Kim Basinger), and sets out to bring this terrorist plot to an end.
Never Say Never Again stinks up the screen right from the beginning with its silly title (which obviously relates to Connery's bid to play Bond) and certainly doesn't improve when we hear the awful main theme song. Right off the bat, a lot of traditional Bond elements are noticeably missing, the pre-credits shot of Bond approaching the screen, John Barry's famed score, and an exciting opening that should pave the way for the rest of the picture.
Bond movies generally rely on three things: the charisma of its leading man, the effectiveness of the villains, and spectacular action sequences. Sean Connery has actually never been my favorite as 007 (I've always preferred both Pierce Brosnan and Roger Moore in the role), but he still makes a good impression even at the ripe age of fifty-three, delivering silly lines with a sense of conviction that few actors could muster. He's not quite as good with the action sequences, he moves a bit too slow during the fight scenes and the use of stunt doubles are often easy to pick out (the motorcyle helmet is the most obvious).
The supporting cast is subpar without exception. Klaus Maria Brandauer is one of the weakest Bond villains, Barbara Carrera is over-the-top without being fun or even sexy, and a young (though admittedly quite foxy) Kim Basinger represents the bane of good acting. Connery struggles mightily hard amid the crap that surrounds him, but he can't save the day here, and he's eventually dragged down by the awfulness.
Never Say Never Again was directed by Irvin Kershner, the same man who gave us The Empire Strikes Back. Virtually none of the outstanding qualities of that film are evident here. This picture has the look of a hack job, it's poorly edited and crafted without a sense of flair. Most of the action scenes are terribly boring, the only lively setpiece being a motorcycle chase that's quite fun to watch, but doesn't match up to the series' most impressive action sequences.
Never Say Never Again was released the same year as the Roger Moore Bond film Octopussy, which wasn't a great film, but memory serves that it was at least a passably enjoyable action movie that boasted several excellent action sequences. There's a reason why Never's distributors prefer not to acknowledge the movie's existence, and why it's the one Bond movie casual movie fans probably remember in infamy or don't remember at all.",1066262400,11,3510,4.774671052631579
874036,1,6304406096,"This is BY FAR the worst James Bond movie ever. It starts out pretty good (except for the crummy title song): Sean Connery is back in action as 007, he has a lot of great lines, and there are more beutiful women than usual. But about halfway through the movie I begin to realize why most Bond fans refuse to acknowledge ""Never Say Never Again"" as part of the series. At this point, the script writer apparently ran out of dry one-liners, because not another witty thing comes out of Bond's mouth for the rest of the movie. And is it just deja vu, or am I seeing ""Thunderball"" all over again? What idiot wrote this? IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME AS THUNDERBALL! The story is the same, and the characters even have the same names! The only difference is that ""Thunderball"" was a good movie and ""Never Say Never Again"" is not. This would have been forgivable if the movie was just Sean Connery playing James Bond one last time for fun, but the thing is, it isn't fun! Halfway through the movie one of Bond's female accomplices is gruesomely murdered and what little ""fun"" is left in the movie ends. It's strange that Bond never even mentions the girl who gets killed. I mean, come on James, the lady just died for you, you could at least say something about her!
From here, the action starts to pick up. You'd think that the film would become more exciting because of this, but actually it gets more boring. I almost fell asleep a few times, and I'm not the kind of person who falls asleep during movies. A few scenes which should be entertaining, like an escape from a seaside castle and a gun battle in an underground cavern, are as boring as can be. Its amazing how incredibly dull a 007 action scene can be when it doesn't have Monty Norman's James Bond theme playing in the background. At this point I am thinking ""Please God, make the movie end!"" But it doesn't! It goes on and on and on. Every time I think it's going to end, it really isn't. Finally, Domino kills the villain, Largo, with a speargun (just like in Thunderball). But it is an underwater scene, and Largo is wearing scuba gear, so I can't see his face and I'm not even sure if she killed Largo or just some anonymous goon! I'm guessing that she killed Largo, because the movie (thank you God!) ends soon afterwords. Sean Connery: It's great that you came back to play James Bond, but you should have refused to do the movie until they came up with a better script. I, like other Bond fans, do not even consider this horrible disgrace to be part of the series. I'd like to pretend that it never happened.",1063324800,6,2564,4.377358490566038

874039,1,6304406096,"WHAT IF someone else had the rights to do a needless retread
of THUNDERBALL? WHAT IF an elderly James Bond was called back into
service? WHAT IF Sean Connery said yes to this proposal? WHAT IF
Kim Basinger were a Bond girl? WHAT IF you were asked to believe
that Blofeld and SPECTRE were still around? WHAT IF there is
another Bond film in theatres at the same time? You have all your
answers to these questions embodied in a film call NEVER SAY NEVER
AGAIN.
I just viewed this film for the first time and was compelled to share
my reaction to it with the world. What can I say? Having been a fan
of the Bond films for the last 24 years, I thought this particular
entry was a joke. The whole approach of a retired agent being
recalled for service to a now defunct ""00"" branch is the perfect set
up for a parody. The new cast (Q, M, and co.) simply doesn't work.
This may be my refusal to accept different actors in the familiar
roles, but I don't seem to suffer this problem in the newer Bond
films (THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS till now). Perhaps this is due to the
fact that the new films aren't using an aging performer in the
role of Bond. Sean Connery may have been the original Bond, but surrounding him with a completely new cast simply
comes off as laughable. Everyone may have been older than need be for a Bond film in A VIEW TO A
KILL, but the all important chemistry was still there! Not true in this particular installmet, which is devoid of everything that makes us love the real Bond movies!
Kim Basinger???? I guess they thought this was inspired casting.
Inspired next to the rest of this films casting maybe, but not
beyond! To all of you who give this film good marks, do the
audiences really get thrilled over watching a relationship ensue while featuring such a large age gap? I can't speak for others, but I find this aspect of the film distasteful.
The action. Again, uninspired, unthrilling, and laughable. This
film simply lacks everything that makes a Bond film enjoyable, from
the action to the gadgets, music, women, and a truly memorable
villain. This version of Largo is a joke. OOoooh, he will ""polite""
James Bond to death. His menacing video game was the most IGNORANT
thing I have ever had the displeasure of sitting through. Oohh
the ""suspense"" of it! Just watch the obvious closeups of Kim Basinger
during this sequence for proof of the ""suspense""! Truly a joke if I
have ever witnessed one!
All in all, I cannot recommend this dribble to anyone! NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN, maybe Mr. Connery should have
said NEVER when asked to do this! This is the stinker of all Bond films. Stay away from it at all costs!",1046649600,3,2631,4.4268041237113405

Overall I think it's a decent film, leaning further to the campy style than Connery had in his previous Bond films.  I own a widescreen video and the widescreen dvd. I kept the video for one good reason:
THE DVD VERSION IS EDITED!
When Bond enters the casino after disposing of the tubby bouncer with a cigarette case (or bomb with a tino gyroscope) the entire scene where he meets Domino (playing Centapede) is gone! As is the following scene where he buys her a drink (another ""Hard or soft?"" moment), as is the next scene when Largo meets Bond and invites him to play Domination with him!  This entire sequence is cut! Why? I don't know. Maybe Atari objected.

874041,1,6304406096,"Wow i never thought that i would be saying this as an avid Bond fan but this movie is horrid. While none of the official 007 films were truly terrible. A couple of Roger Moore efforts less than spectacular. If i compare this to A view to a kill NSNA makes the latter seem like a great film. Here is what is wrong with the movie.
The Plot- There is no plot it is just a remake of Thunderball. Something invloving a couple of nukes. They should have come up with a completely different plot line for this film.
The Action-Man was this slow paced i am sorry they talk to much and for what little action there is it is not very exciting at all.
The Performances-Sean Connery dusted off his tux for one last time and should have never done so. He is to old and is a little thicker around the waste. Hard to imagine love at first sight. Edward Fox as M, Compared to the Fatherly Bernard Lee, Edward Fox's interpretation is shrill and very irritating. Kim Basinger is stiff and not very alluring looks like she is crying all throughout the movie. probably because she found out that this was not an official bond film. Pamela Salem portrayed Miss Moneypenny, i can't pin point it but there something that i just do not like about this person. Lois Maxwell will always be the only Moneypenny. Kalus Maria Brandaur makes for a very uninteresting Largo. Barbra Carrera as Fatima Blush sutibly attractive but kind of over the top.
The Direction- Slow paced and needed to be more action. Irvin Kishner to a huge step back with this because his previous was The Empire Strikes Back. The locations were very mundane and not very exotic. One thing Bond films have been. And finally
The Music-Here is where the movie suffers alot, First no Gun barrel opening sequence and no Pre title sequence, Sleep inducing theme song by lani Hall and Michel Legrands score now this was just one lazy careless score, The music is supposed to fit with what is going on in the film seems so out of place and from a different time and last but not least NO Jame Bond Theme you know it is a 007 film because of the classic theme somthing lacking. I just could not watch this film because everything seemed so wrong. This Movie is just an utter disgrace and Sean Connery should hold his head in shame for doing this movie He made 007 and always will be 007 in my book but this is what happens when Money talks. So if you want to see an offcial bond film from the same year watch Octopussy while not Moores best it is a fun film and his alot better than this piece of ... I would love to Give it zero stars but cant",1044057600,5,2579,4.308641975308642
874042,3,6304406096,"This movie was a sweet farewelll to the only man who will ever really ""be"" Bond. 1983 was a wild year for Bond fans. We had NSNA and the abomination Octopussy in the theaters. NSNA is of course, a remake with a few plot differences of Thunderball.
Kim Bassinger has the same blank look that she has in all her movies and her hair was so over bleached that it looked frizzy and darn near fried in every single scene. She's a long way down from Ursula Andress. The villain isn't as frightening as the original Largo. Still, NSNA is a terrific Bond fim because of Connery. Like all the Connery films the action is played seriously. There's humor of course but the movie itself isn't a joke like Octopussy.",1041120000,,702,4.407692307692308
874043,3,6304406096,"I remember watching this film several years ago, and I detested it. Recently I viewed it again, and while I found it is somewhat entertaining, 'Thunderball', one of the best Connery films, is still far superior.
 To start, Sir Sean Connery does look a bit old for the part, but still gives a fine performance. Kim Basigner is passable as Domino, and Fatima Blush ( the villainess role, played better by Lucianna Paluzzi in the original) , while somewhat overacted by Barbara Carrera, she at least manages to be memorable. One of NSNA's biggest flaws is Klaus Maria Brandaeur as SPECTRE agent Largo. He has none of the menace or charisma of Adolfo Celi in the original, and does not come off as a very convincing villain. The other chief problem is that the movie manages to be both inconsistent and overlong. The action sequences range from decent (the shark diving) to almost abysmal (Health spa, motorcycle chase). Worst of all, the spectacular, climactic underwater battle in 'Thunderball' is replaced by a boring gunfight. And for every enjoyable scene (the cigarette case gag) there is a stupid one to complement it (the childish videogame duel). I don't think it was necessarily a bad idea for the screenwriters to veer away from the traditional Bond games (cards, etc.), but a videogame! Couldn't they think of something better?!?!
 Overall, NSNA is not a bad film at all, and certainly is watchable. However, the inevitable comparisons that come with remakes to their originals do weaken the film.",1041033600,3,1505,4.921259842519685

The movie is filled with double meanings.  For instance, M believes that James is overweight and too old to keep up as an agent.  This parallels how some felt that Connery was past his days as the well known spy.  There are other little quotes, as well as a wink, to let you know that this was all intentional.  For James Bond, and Sean Connery, fans, this is like an added treat.
I do wish there were more of von Sydow in the movie, but the movie does well focusing on Connery.  The movie is also a little dated with the video games, like Centipede, that are shown in the casino.

Anyway, Fleming found the committee to be relatively useless,left, and then wrote the novel Thunderball, which introduced Blofeld and SPECTRE in to the novels. Shortly afterwards, producers Albert R. Broccoli and his pal Harry Saltzman wanted to start a series of Bond films. Kevin McClory felt he had originated Blofeld and SPECTRE and some of Thunderball`s story line and that Fleming had
stolen the ideas from him. And Kevin wasn`t about to let Thunderball go to the screen without him. The legal battles that went one are to complicated, but what came out of this was: Fleming would retain the literary rights to one Enrst Stavro Blofeld and SPECTRE, while McClory would retain the screen rights. Albert and Harry were free to film a filmed version of Thunderball as long as McClory was the producer. In addition, McClory was allowed to produce his own remake of the story, just as long as he didn`t start production until after 1975. The legal battles are also the reason why Blofeld doesn`t appear in any of the films after Diamonds are Forever was released in 1971 (except as an unnamed character in the pre-credits seqeunce of For Your Eyes Only, Broccoli`s good riddance to whole damn mess). Never Say Never Again is McClory`s remake of Thunderball.
And unfortunately, he did`nt have the rights to any of the series
trademarks, though, so unfortunately, you will not hear the immortal James Bond theme or see the famous gunbarrel opening. McClory obtained Sean Connery for the role of agent 007, who vowed that after Diamonds Are Forever he would NEVER play Bond AGAIN (hence the title of this movie).

The reality is somewhere in between, and closer to the former opinion, sadly.
The biggest problem is that, despite the presence of Sean Connery and, at least nominally, M, Q, Blofeld and so forth, it doesn't really seem like a 'Bond Film'. There isn't a great deal of action, the film doesn't appear to have had much money spent on it (presumably most of the budget went towards Connery's salary), and as for Connery himself - he seems to have lost the 'edge' that he brought to his first stint as Bond. This version of the character seems too nice and cuddly, and it doesn't help that he gets to wear some terrible clothes (and what appears to be a toupee).
Particular mention must be made of the incidental music, which, curiously, is mostly light jazz / be-bop, even during the action sequences. It's terribly jarring and doesn't work at all, almost as if the producers were trying to evoke a 60's atmosphere, but in a really bad way.
More than this, the core problem - the one that kills 'Never Say Never Again' stone dead - is that this film was done with greater style and flair in 1965, as 'Thunderball'. There's no reason not to buy that, instead.
As for the DVD itself, you get the film and a box and the trailer.",1009929600,2,1440,4.376865671641791

They didn't even change the plot or the character's names. When hollywood rips off shakespeare plots like ""hamlet"" at least they change names and add/remove stuff. If Sean was to make one last bond film, why couldn't they pick a film he never made, like a Roger Moore bond flick, or a new plot entirely? This movie is senseless and stupid. The only redeeming points are seeing Kimmie basinger in her hot outfits, and seeing her underwater in scuba gear. Also, there is a scene where she is to be sold off as a white slave, that's interesting to contemplate, as the arab creepy guys count out their coins to purchase her! Forget this movie, and go get Thunderball.",997401600,,970,4.517045454545454
874215,5,6304406096,"I think you know the story behind this film! Kevin Mclory, Ian Fleming and Jack Whittigham wrote a film screenplay (starring James Bond 007) that introduced for the first time SPECTRE and Blofeld. The screenplay, had 10 different variations. But when Fleming adapted one of these variations of the screenplay into a novel named ""Thunderball"" and saled a lot, Mclory sought out to get the rights for any treatment to the storyline of this book, and any film adaptions. Meanwhile, Albert Broccoli and Harry Saltzman had already began the James Bond 007 series with Dr. No, FRWL and Goldfinger. So they had to co-operate with Mclory to make this film a reality. Mclory's plan with them included a possibility for remake of this film, 10 years after its first release. Nobody believed he would do such a thing because most didn't even believed that the series would continue that much. In 1975 however he tried to make a film based on a screen play written by himself, Len Deighton and, yes, even Sean Connery. But it was delayed because of 1977's TSWLM. Then in 1983, the phenomenal ""Double Bond Duel"" happened....
Now, lets go into a more detailed review of the film itself. The film's plot, similar to ""Thunderball""'s, has two nuclear missiles steal from the newly re-appeared SPECTRE (as I like to put it), and blackmails NATO and the UN to hold the world for rensom, if they are not given share of the UN's anual payment from their oil fragment. So the MI6 operations are sending James Bond 007 to clear up the case.
To that matter, I don't think this film is a total REMAKE of ""Thunderball"", but a some-sort-of-variation of the theme, that happened to follow THUNDERBALL, as well as the other Bond films. The two films are no way similar. NSNA was much more exciting and amzing Bond film, maybe because it was done by others than Broccoli and co. Even thought it's not an original movie either (the plot remains intact with ""Thunderball), the film had elements that provided a different take of the theme and thus a differently presented film. This movie marks the re-appearence of the original (and still best) Bond, Sean Connery, thus the return of an edgier 007 (no offence to Moore, but only in LALD, TSWLM and FYYO Moore showed his edge). Here, Bond must use his brain and body to get out of trouble, and not rely only to Q's gadgets (as in most of the Moore's Bond films). Also, there's some kind of aknowledgement of Bond's age, that has never been shown in the EON films. But aside Connery, the supporting cast is brilliant. Klaus Maria Brandauer is excellent as one of the most original villains of the series, Max Largo. Thought it is supposed, as in any remake, to follow the original character's performance, but in this case, Klaus Maria decided to create his own, unique representation of the character. In fact, he acts really different from the original '65 Largo - he acts like a cousin or brother or something like that (meaning he is different). His Largo, even without the characteristic Celi's scar, is far superior. He shows a menacing, intriguing face of the absolute lunatic in every sence of the word, a very dangerous side of evil, gleefully insidious, that when it is ""in trouble"", he shows his real face, rather than a quite wealthy gentleman, the public mask of his personality. He is the first of the neuro-phychic, realistic modern day villains we see in the present Bond films (such as Alex Travelyan, Frank Sanchez, Renard etc.)- he's a three-dimensional villain in a way that only the few great Eon/Bond supervillains (Goldfinger, Scaramanaga, Zorin) truly are. Compare Brandauer's Largo to the original, or even later bad guys like Drax and Stromberg, and you'll see what I mean. Elegantly nefarious Max Von Sydow, even for his limited on-screen time, certainly ranks as one of the best Blofeld's, and while not the best, he is the only one who actually borrowed the style, charm, charisma and coolness from the novels' Blofeld, giving him an air of danger, polite menace and fear. He had the potential to be the best. Unfortunately, his short appearence doesn't let him to be voted as the best Blofeld, but certainly one of them. Barbara Karrera is, well, the archetype of the femme fatale of the series, and certainly the inspiration of Xenia Onatopp of Goldeneye. Kim Basinger, in the beggining of her carrer, seems to be the most succesfull (on her further carrer, as I note) Bond girl, since she had the oppotunity to expand her carrer aside the Bond femme, unlike other Bond girls. She is blatant, more of pupil of Largo's in the beggining, and, as in ANY Bond movie, she falls inlove with Bond. In fact she is the one to put him on retirement (for awhile, of course). As for the MI6 cast, well, they not be as  memorable as the prototypes, but they succeed on creating something unque. Edward Fox is wonderfull as Bill Taner (yes, as Bill Taner, because, for me, as M, he is awful and totally out of character!), he shows the leadership that a chief of stuff must have. Alec McCowen as Q Algy is, for me, exactly what R was in The World Is Not Enough, an inferior officer, and as the original Q is missed in here (propably for a short vacation), he is the temporary head of Q Branch. Anyways, he is wonderfull! Rowan Atkinson (Bean), well, he is the comic relief in this film, and he works it out as the incompitent agent.
The pacing of the movie is fine. Irvin Kershner (the only american director for a Bond film) gives an exciting thrill-ride, and while the script is somewhat flawed (yes, it could have been better), Kershner comes up and makes up for it. The plot is not allowed to ""thicken"" too much before Bond is allowed to save the world with his usual blend of savoir-faire and (not too much)gratuitous sex and violence. Overall NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN is a class act. In my estimate, Thunderball was really over-the-top because overdone/extended underwater sequences (particularly the battle finale) made the fourth Bond outing a bit ""soggy"". NSNA is a better picture than Thunderball because it does not try to be an epic. Having Sean Connery back in action was supposed to carry the day as he put this solid 007 adventure through its paces. I think it worked. To fans this ""remake"" with the real Bond is a ""thrilling prospect"" that won't let you down and NEVER could...
So, what we have is a very entairtaining Bond film (and certainly one of the best), that needs to be in the canons. For me, the Bond series has two Phases: The first includes the first 14 official Bonds (6 with Connery, 1 with Lazenby and 7 with Moore), and ends with this one as 15th (7th with Connery), and the second Phase started with the last 5 ones (2 with Dalton and 3 with Brosnan-so far). But how can NSNA be accepted in the official series? Well, its simple: Take  M, make him Chief of Stuff Bill Taner, who again replaced M, who was again on leave, delete some M references, and take Q Algy and make him the TEMPORARY replacement of the Q Branch ('cause Q is ill here or he is also on leave). Make the film take place in 1986, a little time after A View To A Kill. So, with that way, we'll have the end of the ""old ones"" era (old ones, meaning Connery, Moore, Maxwell, Lee, and in any cases opening the door for a new generation of Bond, M, Moneypenny etc.), so that the circle would be completed, and to be followed by a new start - The Living Daylights, Licence To Kill, Goldeneye and continue... If you liked my ideas, send me an e-mail to supbat4@hotmail.com and tell me your opinion.
In any cases, this is the most underrated Bond film of the series. What needs to be done for now, is a Special Edition DVD-vhs that will include the open-narrel opening, will re-arrange the training exercise in the beggining as a pre-title sequence, include newly created title sequence with the traditional way, will include some important deleted scenes within the film-not in a deleted scenes section (such deleted scenes as Blofeld's death etc.), and will in any cases improve the picture and sound, and in this case the movie itself, like in the other ones, now that its rights were bought by MGM/UA. As for the current DVD, lets not talk about it. I think it is obvious, how much MGM respects this ""really underestimated Bond picture.",997056000,2,8265,4.621768707482993

However, when I started over with DVD, ""Never Say Never Again"" was and still is the only one I had not purchased again - and I won't. Why? It simply does not belong in the James Bond series. Not only because of superficial details such as the absence of the 007 logo and of the usual actors playinq M, Q, and Moneypenney, but also because the film has basic flaws. I could sum them up by saying ""Why make a second ""Thunderball"" when the first one was much better?"" In ""Never Say Never Again"", for example, the plot is a much downgraded version of the plot in ""Thunderball"", so the director has to fall back on old tricks  like beautiful girls and car chases to keep the audience awake. I will pass quickly on details such as the so-called "" state-of-the-art-submarine that threatens the world""... with a hull form that has not been used since the fifties. Sometimes they should know that paying attention to details is necessary in order to create a masterpiece. The humor is not better, and the glass of urine thrown at the face makes me think, once again, of a very bad copycat act. At least, in the movies of the twenties, they threw cream tarts at each other's faces. There is little of interest in that disaster of a movie. If it was meant to be a classic of the genre, we have seen much better. If it was meant to be a parody, which is what I rather think, it falls short of the mark.

It is not so full of modern day Bond weapons or gadgetry, but it is more like the first half dozen, a little more sophisticated where Bond had to use his brains & stealth to get himself out of trouble rather than fantastic pyrotechnics. There are the compulsory vehicles, beautiful women & well known characters in the form of Leiter & ""M"" & the inevitable down to the last minute conclusion, so all in all, despite the lack of the usual gun barrel beginning & Bond theme, it is a thouroughly enjoyable film in the vintage vein of Bond.

874311,4,6304406096,"Holding the rights to Thunderball, Kevin McClory decided to make a new Bond Film in 1975.  Amazingly enough, Sean Connery was interested in playing Bond again if he had script approval.  The film originally was going to only loosely based on Thunderball, but after a few years of legal battles with EON it became simply a remake of that earlier film.  Still, it is a good Bond film, even though it does have its flaws.  The most obvious strength that Never Say Never Again has is Connery, Sean Connery.  Even though he looked his age, he looked fit and ready for the usual Bond action.  In fact, he looked like he was in better shape than he was for his last Bond film, Diamonds Are Forever, in 1971.  The plot of the film very closely follows that of Thunderball, with some updating of the details and technology for 1983.  Director Irvin Kershner (The Empire Strikes Back) does a fine job with the movie, and the cast gives some excellent performances (including Klaus Maria Brandauer as Largo, Barbara Carerra as Fatima Blush - her performance and character seems to be the blueprint for Xenia Onatopp from Goldeneye, Kim Basinger as Domino, Bernie Casey as Felix Leiter, and the great Max Von Sydow as Blofeld).  The weaknesses of the film?  It doesn't quite LOOK as spectacular as the official Bond films - it has a lower budget look to it than the EON films.  Another flaw: the characters of ""M"" and Nigel Small-Fawcett, both of whom seem like they belong in a Bond spoof rather than the real thing.  Both of them ruin their respective scenes due to the attempts at comedy by Edward Fox and Rowan Atkinson.  The music is often great (some really good Jazz), but at other times seems inappropriate for particular scenes.  The lack of the ""James Bond Theme,"" also detracts a little from the film (but not much).  But when you've got Sean Connery, a solid plot, and a good (overall) supporting cast, you've got a winner.  NSNA could have been better, but for a Bond film outside of the official EON Productions banner Never Say Never Again acquits itself quite nicely.

A little (but not too much must go to Connery). In the entertainment biz, you just don't participate in projects to line your pockets. He was and still is one of the great screen actors but the role of James Bond had long since passed him after ""Diamonds Are Forever"". I liken his playing J.B. one more time to baseball player Cal Ripken continuing to play. We go and see both of them do what they do, but we realize (as in the case of N.S.N.A.) that they don't do it at the same level anymore. Sprinkle a little blame on Kevin McClory for even bringing the film into existence over his bitter feud with Ian Fleming, et al. And finally, the director (whose name escapes me)...after years of Cubbi Broccoli's highly polished productions, (except for Dr. No which is one of the greats but did not have a big budget so it's a little rough) N.S.N.A. looks like some 1970's B grade film shown before the main feature at the weekend drive-in.
On a personal level, the movie is hard to watch for me because it is a re-do of my fav J.B. film and novel, ""Thunderball"". As good as ""Thunderball"" is, is how bad ""N.S.N.A."" is. The controversy surrounding the script has been well documented so, I won't rehash it here.
In closing, although I gave it one star, I do encourage everyone to see the film at least once but, preferably AFTER you have seen all of the other films. To purchase it though, I would strongly suggest spending your hard earned money elsewhere. I speak from experience. I own the film myself, but because I enjoy the other films more, I have only watched it once or twice in the five years I've had it, compared with the 53 or so times I have watched ""Thunderball""....of course that's just my opinion....I could be wrong.

For starters it is definitely pleasing to have Connery back one more time as Bond, but what makes ""NSNA"" a better film than ""Thunderball"" are the supporting players.  The danger that Largo presents to Bond here is much more affecting and dramatic than in ""Thunderball"".  The action sequences are more ingenious, the art direction is more elegant, and the performaces are more well tuned.
Whether you prefer ""Thunderball"" to ""NSNA"" or not, ""NSNA"" is still a great Bond entertainment.

That scene is where Bond surprises Domino. She had previously seen him at the health spa where he gave her a rub down, she thinking he was a member of the staff. The scene that is missing is where Bond introduces himself to her and she stumbles over her lines ordering a ""Bloody Mary with plenty of Worchester sauce.""

874466,3,6304406096,"This 1983 remake of ""Thunderball"" is one of the three ""orphan"" films in the Bond Canon (the others being George Lazenby's fine but not wildly popular solo outing as Bond in ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service,"" and Woody Allen's hilarious Bond spoof ""Casino Royale"" with David Niven).
""Never Say Never Again"" was not produced by the Broccoli-Salzberg Eon Productions group, and features unfamiliar actors in familiar roles. The look and feel of ""Never Say Never Again""  departs widely from the usual Bond formula.  What this film DOES have is Sean Connery, and Connery's presence onscreen more than counterbalances the lack of familiar elements.
As in ""Thunderball,"" SPECTRE steals nuclear warheads and threatens worldwide chaos and destruction unless their extortion demands are met.  Klaus Maria Brandauer plays a hammy, smiling and sadistic Largo, and Kim Basinger plays a translucently sexy Domino. Adolfo Celi's 1965 Largo radiated more evil, but Basinger's Domino shows more comedy and depth than Claudine Auger. A wonderful character addition is Barbara Carrera as Fatima Blush, who may well be the most purely erotic of all the Bond girls.
Connery shows he is THE James Bond for all time, despite his age. He carries off his reprise with martini-dry wit and a roguish charm that none of his successors have ever matched. Watching the still dynamic middle-aged Connery, one has to question why he was ever replaced by the bland Roger Moore.
""Never Say Never Again"" has a rambling plotline and some really atrocious film editing, both of which are unpleasantly distracting, but the action sequences are engaging and well-crafted.
Watching Connery enjoy his romp through the role he made famous, one has to wonder:  Could he ever play the Ultimate Bond Villain?",971654400,8,1763,5.175438596491228
874467,5,6304406096,A 007 PICTURE STARRING SEAN CONNERY CAN NEVER BE CALLED UNOFFICIAL...BUY IT!,966988800,3,76,5.416666666666667
874468,5,6304406096,"When Kevin McClory teamed up with the Eon company to make the movie Thunderball in 1965 he was contractually obliged not to exercise his rights  to the James Bond character for ten years, Sure enough in 1975 McClory  started  pitching a 007 script titled Warhead to all the competing studios,  but it wasn't until 1983 that Never Say Never Again actually made it to the  silver screen opening opposite the lame Roger Moore vehicle Octopussy.  Never Say Never Again (a title suggested by Sean Connery's wife) has on  display a variation of the plot that McClory had produced almost 20 years  earlier.
Faced with not being able to include the iconic familiar gun-barrel sequence at the beginning of their 1983 Bond movie, Taliafilm (named after the wife of the producer and Rocky actress Talia Shire) had to cone up with their own graphic image.  What they decided upon gives the first clue that we are about to experience something different, a breath of fresh air and a good kick up the rear end to a series of movies that had become stale through resorting to self-parody and recycled dialogue and villainy.
Yes, [NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN is a retelling of the THUNDERBALL storylines worked out between Fleming, Bryce, Whittingham and McClory. It's technically speaking not a remake of the 1954 picture though, but a different version of the story using characters that appeared in the earlier drafts (such as Fatima Blush).
And from the moment the screen fills up with all those 007's and the audience is drawn in, we know right away that Connery is back and  better than ever, and looking much fitter than he did in DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER.
The title song has been attacked by 007 fans over the years, but I actually like it quite a lot (in direct comparison with the rest of the admittedly rather tame soundtrack). I have found myself over the past 20 years humming it to myself (sometimes at the most inopportune moments) and so it has obviously become seared into my consciousness as only a catchy tune can.
And here we come to what is the 1983 movie's pretitle sequence. But instead of interrupting the flow of the story with yet more images of nude women and silly fluorescent effects the titles play out for the action allowing the audience to immediately find its feet and settle into the pace of this thrilling picture.
 Of course it's not the first time that we have seen Bond killed off in the opening minutes. We saw it first at the hands of Red Grant in 1963's FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE and then again just four years later in YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE. Here Bond is on a training mission and for those with keen eyes its really quite obvious (no muzzle fore from 007's gun). As such it works a little better in the little details, and when 007 rescues the leggy millionaires daughter held captive she plunges a knife into him.
It is at this point that the factor of a new M really pays off. We see Edward Fox sternly watching the exercise on tape. We see another unidentified character (presumably Tanner). Its not until the very last minute that Connery's 007 is revealed - alive and well.
Following on from a dressing down from M is one of my favorite sequences in the movie - namely Shrublands. It's a favorite of mine because we really get introduced to my favorite character in the movie Fatima Blush. The 1965 movie has Fiona Volpe, but Volpe lacked the super-charged charisma, biting wit and ego-maniacal psychotic nature that Barbara Carrera simply oozes as Blush.
Look at the tenderness she shows to Jack, followed immediately by her bashing his head against the wall. Witness her dispatching of Jack and then crooning over her pet snake, and who can forget her final confrontation with 007 - ""guess where you get the first one.""
Carrera steals every scene she is in. She dances on her way to kill Bonds French ally and like a black widow spider she seduces 007 and then attempts to kill him with a device to attract a special group of sharks attached to his air tanks.
The second highlight is the appearance of Indiana Jones alum Pat Roach as Count Lippe. Who cannot appreciate and revel in the fun fight in which Roach's Lippe plays the indestructible Jaws role, minus the embarrassing buffoonery that Richard Kiel brought to the EON franchise.  Bond throws everything at Lippe to no avail and then in an amusing conclusion the character is blinded by Bond's urine falling back into a collection of glass cylinders and test tubes.
Connery's reaction is classic.
In an attempt perhaps to counter the familiarity of the group of has-been actors inhabiting the SIS offices in the EON series at the time, this Connery movie has the most impressive list of actors to inhabit any Bond movie. In addition to the already mentioned Connery, Fox, Carrera and Roach we also have the incredible Klaus Maria Brandeur as Largo, the revered Max Von Sydow and Bernie Casey as a black Felix Leiter (hey, why not?!).
Brandeur plays Largo with just the right amount of understated menace and Casey is probably the second best Leiter of the series (after Hedison). You really get the feeling that he and Connery's 007 are the best of buddies, their interactions and playful barbs appear genuinely affectionate and respectful of the other,
The one A-list actor who really lets down the rest of the team is Kim Basinger. She admittedly didn't have much to go on, but it is in this one respect that Claudine Auger and the 1965 EON effort takes the honors.
Some have said that it is with Bonds arrival in Nassau, that this movie tends to wander a little. I respectfully disagree. It is here that the majority of Carrera's scenes appear and here that Connery has his first confrontation with Largo. I have yet to really understand the computer game the two play, but it works nicely in building up some real tension and suspense (name a Moore 007 -villain scene that achieved the same level of pent up pressure - I can't). The final line from Connery - "" I wouldn't know, I've never lost"" is also probably one of the best 007 comebacks in the entire series.
Yes, this section of the movie also features some of the best dialogue, the promise of which had been ably shown in the brilliant Q-scene earlier in the picture. The lines come thick and fast and are genuinely witty in comparison with some of the gags in the Moore series of pictures. In addition Rowan Atkinson nicely doesn't outstay his welcome as comic relief and his ""don't know his mother"" line always makes me smile.  Other gags that work include the cigarette lighter gag at the casino and the ""your place or mine"" bomb at the hotel.
The ending in Africa is over a little too soon and the small battle in the underground caverns lacks the scope of some of the 007 pictures. But I think it works well in the context of the rest of the picture and is not the confusing, overlong mess that really mars the 1965 effort. Its cleaner and tighter, just the way I like it.
Yes, even though Roger Moore is my favorite 007 actor,  ""Never Say Never Again"" is my favorite 007 picture.
Irvin Kershner, who directed the best of the Star Wars movies, again brings us a franchises crowning achievement with a steady directing hand, incredible witty dialogue, superb performances by an amazing cast and Sean Connery returning revitalized after a 12 year absence from the role that made him famous.
It's the one 007 movie that I have watched more than any other.
After the movie was obtained by MGM-UA (the  company that produces the EON production) there was talk among fans as to  the possibility of the gun barrel sequence being added to make it part of  the ""canon"", I for one do not think that this unique James Bond 007 movie  should be tampered with in that manner and equally happy to see it emerge  on DVD.

874471,3,6304406096,"NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN was Sean Connery's return as Bond for one final shot as one of screens most famous heros.  The movie is a little overboard on fun and silliness and is a very similar story to Seans most famous Bond  movie THUNDERBALL.  James Bond (Connery-still good) is somewhat retired and  not as fit as he once was as the movie opens and is told to get in shape at  a health spa if he is to continue his duties as a government agent.  Meanwhile the fiendish criminal group S.P.E.C.T.R.E. has got plans to steal  nuclear weapons from a NATO bomber and have their agent Largo hold the  world ransom with the bombs.  Bond must track down Largo and the bombs  before it is too late and millions are killed.  Connery is trying to fit in  what was at the time the Moore era of Bond movies and while Connery still  is a great James Bond despite his age, the Moore films were much more  different then the older Connery capers.  Moores' movies went for fun and  stunts Connery's were serious and had more down and dirty spy action.  The  silliness abounds on many levels such as when S.P.E.C.T.R.E. sends a  destructive oaf to kill Bond at the health club and ends up wrecking just  about everything but Bond.  Or the fact that Largo is nowhere NEARLY as  menacing or mean as the Largo in THUNDERBALL.  One true highlight of the  film is the villiness Fatima Blush who is an outragously wild hit woman who  wants to make sure that she gets Bond.  I will give Fatima 1 star and the  rest of the movie 2.  This movie is fun and only fun nothing more.

I  even don't understand if the film was a plage, comedy or did the producers  really want to produce a cheap action where just a name Bond sells high  profits. Rowan ""Bean"" Atkinson didn't also fit to his part.  Finally, the good thing is that the movie I call Connery's worst is not  officially listed as a Bond movie.",964396800,9,752,4.391304347826087

874547,2,6304406096,"Why Sean? Why? You were the definitive Bond. Your wooden performance in a bad James Bond movie, You Only Live Twice, was still enough to cause it to outgross 3 to 1 a good James Bond movie, On Her Majesty's Secret Service.  Your farewell to the Bond series, the runaway hit Diamonds Are Forever,  showed that you could play a different, campy, self deprecating Bond in a  comic book adventure and still make it believable. In fact it proved that  you could do it better than Roger Moore, whose first two efforts, while  directed in the same style as DAF, are just plain lame by comparison and  almost put the series into permanent exile. In fact, it wasn't until  Moore's films were given a bigger budget and he less to say, that his  movies came close to generating the excitement of yours. That said, you  really let us all down when you made this stinker. Why? You had nothing to  prove and lots to lose. Well, you lost. Moore's competing effort,  Octopussy, was just flat out better in all aspects. Fortunately, Moore  showed his true colors in his final 007 flick, A View To A Kill, which  managed to combine the worst aspects of both his lame outings and his  cartoonish ones. Okay, now for a few details about Never Say Never Again  itself.  Connery does bring his inimitable screen presence here, as the man  immediately makes any movie, no matter how much of a mess it may be,  watchable. However, because of well known external factors attributable to  this not being a UA/EON production, nothing, including Connery's portrayal,  seems particularly Bond-like even though this is a remake of a previous  Bond film which starred Connery! Here, the Largo (not imposing enough) and  Domino (not as exotic) characters are inferior to the originals and  although the Fatima Blush character generates excitement isn't she just a  more over-the-top (and therefore less believable) version of Fiona Volpe?  And don't even get me started on that horrid score. The movie is too long  and while I don't mind a Bond movie with more dialogue than action (From  Russia With Love and DAF both fit in that category, but are among my  favorites), when the action does appear it just doesn't seem all that  exciting or credible. That fight with the henchman at Shrublands was just  plain silly and the whole climax of the film was boring. It felt like the  characters did all this talking for nothing. All these factors add up to  this Bond movie being put into the ""Avoid"" pile, along with The  Man With The Golden Gun, Moonraker and A View To A Kill. Poor Sean, you  should have left well enough alone. If it makes any difference, I'll always  think of your final Bond scene as hugging Jill St. John aboard the QEII  rather than winking at the camera while in the swimming pool with Kim  Bassinger.",960163200,2,2791,4.645491803278689

874549,2,6304406096,"_Never Say Never Again_ is the only serious Bond film not released by MGM/UA.  That lack of continuity shows to the point of distraction.  Here, there's no gun barrel sequence, no funky titles, no great opening song, no  recurring cast members.  There's not even the James Bond theme.  In fact,  James Bond himself barely puts in an appearance.
What's here is a  makeover of _Thunderball_, arguably  the plot-weakest Bond of the 1960's.  To be sure, the supporting cast (with the exception of the missing series  regulars), is far superior to the original.  Klaus Maria Brandauer is  perfectly menacing as Largo, and it's a shame that he had to waste his one  shot at Bondian villainy with this off-brand Bond.  Likewise, Kim Basinger  and Barbara Carrera turn in fine performances that put Connery's original  _Thunderball_ girls to shame.  And, no other Bond can boast the use of  Rowan Atkinson, who brings just the right comic touch to his role of the  British Consular official in the way that Desmond Llewellyn often did in  other Bonds when he traveled out in the field
But the strain of trying to  make a Bond film just using the elements that were legally available to the  production crew is obvious.  In writing Bond as an older man, the writers  get into immediate trouble.  If Bond is older than he was in the original  Thunderball, then he had to have been married, and Blofeld had to have  already murdered his wife.  Yet, Connery here makes no reference to that  fact, despite being faced with Blofeld.  Nor is there reference to  Blofeld's last tangle with Roger Moore's Bond in _For Your Eyes Only_,  released only two years earlier.  Worse, the attempt to follow Kevin  McClory's original vision of Bond as a grittier character leaves us with a  Bond that's checked his snappy comebacks at the door.  Much of the grim  humor of the MGM/UA Connery is gone, replaced by a certain Any Spy quality.  It's no surprise that Connery himself seems confused as to his identity  when he reads the line ""Bond, James Bond"" as a question, more  than a statement.
Now that Eon Studios has finally acquired the rights  to all Bond films, some of the problems with this little anomaly might yet  see vital refurbishment.  Perhaps when MGM/UA releases it next it will at  least get new titles, soundtrack, and, most especially, the retrofitting of  the James Bond theme.
None of that will make up for the lack of Desmond  Llewellyn as `Q', or Lois Maxwell's ""Moneypenny""-or indeed of the  lack of Bond himself--but with the right amount of tweaking the original  film could be brought more into harmony with the other Bonds MGM already  distributed.",956880000,3,2651,4.771618625277162

Having said that Connery aquits himself admirably in the  role, just avoiding looking as old as Roger Moore.

The script, with contributions from Dick Clement and Ian Le  Frenais sparkles with wit and is helped by such star turns as Rowan  Atkinson, Klaus Maria Von Brandauer, and Kim Basinger.

874617,5,6304406096,"I think this is a great Bond film, I don't know why it was never properly released on video. There is absolutely no problems with it. James Bond is played by Sean Connery and the Bond girl (Domino) is played by Kim  Basinger. I would give it a five star review and say BUY IT!  It is mainly  about a man about to detonate two nuclear warheads without any demands.  There is only one gadget in it and that is a pen with an explosive nib. He  uses it for a explosive get-away. Edward Fox plays ""M"". 007 gets  stabbed in the ribs on the training course at the beginning of the film, he  finishes th etraining course in 1 min 47 secs. My overall mark out of 10  would be 9 and if you are just reading my review to get an opinion before  buying it, I would say it is a terrific video and you should buy it (It is  only available from amazon.com)",944956800,3,840,4.006024096385542
