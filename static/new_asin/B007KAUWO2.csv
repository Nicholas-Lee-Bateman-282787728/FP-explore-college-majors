5092965,5,B007KAUWO2,"First of all, this is a review of the actual movie/film as originally broadcast on HBO.  Second, it is not meant to be a comment on purchased DVD extras or such, or delivery problems and such, but finally, I will base this review solely on this film's worth as great cinema (IMHO), and despite my own general political views.  Anyone who wishes to learn more of my own political and social views generally, should read my various reviews and Listmania list comments.  Basically, I am left of ""center,"" whatever that means, these days.

This is a review of the movie and content itself however, and I have watched it several times on HBO on-demand, which might say a bit about how much I liked, and love this.  Regardless of one's political leanings, I think all on all sides, can learn a lot from this movie.  It is very well done by director Jay Roach, with solid references and great performances all over the place.  Special kudos to Julianne Moore, who is the whole show here, and boy, did/does she nail Sarah Palin or what?  This is an obvious Emmy in her name.  Despite the naysayers FoxNewz, radical right, etc., this truly portrays a quite ""fair and balanced"" view on Sarah Palin and the presidential race of 2008.  Other cast putting in great performances include Woody Harrelson and Ed Harris.

This movie is one of the reasons why so many still pay for HBO.  Once in awhile, they will produce and show, something as good as this.  And sadly, for those without HBO or any ""subscription"" to such, this would proably go unknown.  But I'd like to spread the word.  This is a great film, and I hope both left-leaning and right-leaning, really get a chance to watch this, without any expectations or politically self serving motives. To anyone considering a buy here though, you should see this film at least once, uncut, before you buy.  Conservatives and liberals will see what they want to here, but overall, I think it presents a pretty accurate and objective picture of Sarah Palin's VP run, and I will never understand some strong objections to what is presented here, either by Palin herself, or the Republican party, or the extreme right-wing phone it in, ""born agains,"" and just about anyone given air time on Fox Newz.  Not to say anything about the MSNBC wing-nuts.  Overall, for myself, what's all the fuss?  If anything, this actually creates a sympathy for Sarah.  Bottom line is she was out of her league, and as much blame directed at her, is equaled by the persons shown who did a lousy job of vetting and presenting her.

If you see it and like it, buy, because I think this will go down as one of the most honest, comprehensive, ""political"" movies of all time.  It compares for me with previous ""political"" films like ""The Candidate,"" ""Seven Days in May,"" ""Advise and Consent,"" ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,"" and many others.  I think as time goes by, more positive reviews will come this film's way than not.  But all of this is just my own opinion.

The movie is, when all is said and done, actually kind of a positive take on Palin, and creates much sympathy for the woman, and for John McCain.  It makes its main point however, without flaw.  And that is, that Sarah Palin not only was never qualified for the office she ran for (one heartbeat away from the presidency), but also that she was surrounded from the beginning with too many ""support staff"" and DC insiders and image-makers, who only played a game with her and tried to make her into something she never was, nor is still to this day.

I find it strange that most Palin supporters (no matter what reality was and is), have put this film down so much, and in many cases, have completely shunned it all, just like Sarah Palin has done herself.  This is so wonderfully well-done, from a film technique aspect alone, and truly so ""fair and balanced"" about Palin, that strong objections to this content ring hollow at best, among both the liberal and conservative elements in the two major parties, and the mass-media alike.

For those looking for a validation of their ""liberal"" views, they will find affirmation here, but it is a false one and doesn't dig deeper.  I am no Sarah Palin fan, nor will I ever be, but even I felt a new kind of semi-respect for her after watching this many times.  It is obvious she was the wrong choice for the office she ran for, but one can only wonder what she might've been, and who might've been president, had her ""handlers"" been anything approaching honest human beings. Sure, she was simply unready for all of this, but I am left with the feeling that if Sarah Palin had just gotten out of the way of her own shortcomings and ego, as well as those who chose her and pushed her onto the public without much regard for her as a person, things could've been a lot different.

Overall, regardless of one's personal political ideas and ideals, this is a first class political film as well as a continually absorbing and entertaining movie.  I only wish it could've been expanded into a several hour mini-series, cause what IS shown, is absolutely, damn interesting, every moment of it.  Another five-star original HBO effort, you betcha (wink)...",1332633600,10,5167,4.603711790393013
5092966,4,B007KAUWO2,"Released almost a year to the day after Barack Obama took his place as President of the United States, Game Change landed into the political soccer field with a wallop, and quickly became the talk of the DC insider circuit. Written by Mark Halperin and John Heileman, the gossipy tell-all proved to be the final escape hatch for a lot of supposed experts who saw their careers waylaid by piss poor decisions, leading to a level of backstabbing and leaked information that was virtually unprecedented. It made for an entertaining read, like skimming through the National Enquirer while in a check-out line. And much like those scandalous rags with their silly celebrity headlines, most of what was inside turned out to be true, despite all the protestations by those the book would highlight.

Game Change was pretty even handed in it's dirt digging, exposing some ugly facts about Hilary Clinton's 2008 campaign as well as the bedroom shenanigans of John Edwards. For HBO's new film adaptation of the book, from the same guys who gave us the excellent Recount a few years ago, the focus is squarely on the Republican side of the ticket, and the roller coaster that was John McCain(Ed Harris) and his polarizing running mate, Sarah Palin(Julianne Moore).

Consider the film less of a biopic and more of a fact finding mission, as writer Danny Strong attempts to uncover how a dedicated war hero with a campaign proudly boasting ""Country First"" could nominate someone as hopeless as Palin to be within a breath of the Presidency. The obvious answer is desperation, but there's more to it than that.  It takes a concerted and sustained level of willful ignorance for something like this to happen, and it starts right at the top. Centering mostly on McCain's senior adviser, Steve Schmidt(Woody Harrelson), who first put forth the idea of selecting the popular Alaskan Governor as a means of rallying the flagging conservative base, the campaign's highs and lows are seen mostly through his bloodshot eyes. Palin's nomination would not only give the base the red meat it so desired, steal the thunder from the mega popular Obama machine, and possibly even rally the Clinton supporters to their side. The campaign needed a game changer, and Palin was it. She was the world's most charismatic lump of clay, ready to be shaped. Or so they thought. She was new to the national stage, however, and was instantly a liability in terms of experience. Could McCain give up his principles and select someone he knows isn't ready to be President, all just for the sake of a victory? Would he be ""Country First"" when it really mattered?

For those who follow the political grind on a daily basis, there's little new to learn about who Sarah Palin was back then. She was a simple, determined mother who got caught up in the glitz of the global stage. When she accepts the vice-presidential nomination, her calm and reserve is unbelievable, shocking everyone in McCain's camp. However, it isn't long before they realize just how big of a mistake they've made, and all the attempts to pull a Pygmalion on her are going to be utter failures. The film shows her disastrous, often mocked interviews with Charlie Gibson(although the ""Bush Doctrine"" question is left out) and Katie Couric, where Palin is stumped by a simple question of what newspapers she reads. The constant criticism forces her into a mental breakdown of sorts, and any attempt to help her is met with resistance. Uh oh, time to start goin' rogue!

The film is especially fascinated with two defining character arcs. One is Palin's transformation from an unknown hockey mom into an egotistical, perpetual victim who terrorized her staff, leading to some claiming she was mentally unstable. The other is that of Schmidt, who comes to see how the decision he made in choosing her was the most awful mistake of his career, that didn't just threaten McCain's campaign, but also could ruin everyone's reputation forever. Oh, and it might damage the country's standing in the world, too. Julianne Moore is going to get all the attention for her performance as Palin, and she darn well deserves it. After so many Palin imitations, not the least of which by Tina Fey, playing her in any realistic manner is tough, but Moore nails her folksy manner and Eddie Haskell charm perfectly. If this was a feature film, Moore would be a shoe-in for Best Actress right now. Harrelson shouldn't be overlooked, either. His Steve Schmidt(aka the ""Schmidt Head) bears little resemblance to the real man, now an excellent MSNBC contributor. The only thing they have in common is the bald head. Harrelson creates his own version of Schmidt, a man conflicted by his pledge to do everything to win and his desire to maintain some dignity.

Few people come out of this smelling like a rose, although it's not entirely a hit piece. Palin does come off as someone completely overwhelmed by the experience, even if she entered it for all the right reasons.  There are some genuinely effective moments that portray her in a positive light, or at the very least show why she resonated with so many people. One of those scenes comes fairly early on, as she's speaking about her disable son, Trig. To have someone of Palin's stature have a personal stake in advocating for children of special needs struck home with a lot of people. As she began to lose more of herself to the needs of the campaign, Palin lost that connection and was consumed by the need to say and do anything to win. It became all about her need for more of the spotlight. Ultimately she comes off as nasty, mean-spirited, conniving, and worst of all.....dumb.

Jay Roach and Danny Strong do their usual excellent job navigating the political waters with a mix of humor and darkness, as they did with Recount. The 2008 campaign is arguably the most fascinating in this country's history, and the film only shows us one small sliver of it. As well as it shows the dramatic surge of enthusiasm Palin provides to Republicans, we never get to see the equal amounts of fear she inspired in the Democratic base. In fact, we only see Barack Obama and Joe Biden in stock footage. HBO may be looking at the first leg of a possible trilogy here, with the next showing the combative primary between Hilary Clinton and Obama. Then...if we're all lucky, maybe we'll get to see Obama's historic Presidential campaign from his perspective?",1332288000,104,6407,4.812897366030881
5092967,5,B007KAUWO2,"I am not sure if this is possibly a comedy or maybe a horror film. Assuming that it is largely 'true', I can only say that the world luckily escaped a major calamity.
An honest man, John McCain, committed a huge blunder by letting his relatively respectable advisers and campaign managers choose a wild gun as candidate for vice president. Seeing that Obama had acquired monumental celebrity status, and was leading strongly in the polls, they jumped on a desperate act of wishful thinking by selecting the awesome SP as running mate. They realized soon enough that some more vetting might have saved much embarrassment. The woman was entirely clueless, but on the other hand a talented campaigner and actress.
We  all know what happened next. American voters were not daft enough to vote her into office.
She still hangs out there, making noses and doing damage, but essentially her influence seems to be contained within a large radical minority of illiterates.

The film does a credible job at reminding us of a period of danger. We can't possibly know if everything happened exactly like this, but the public scenes match my recollections and the unknowable ones look plausible.
Julianne Moore is a better SP than SP herself. She clearly outpalins Tina Fey, who was her own kind of genius. Ed Harris is his usual solid professional self as McCain. Woody Harrelson is the man to blame, he plays the genius who picked SP for the job.

There are moments in the film when one is tempted to sympathize with the poor woman, when she seems like a hunted victim.
There are also moments when one wonders how these losers are going to turn their losing position around.  The standard formula of underdog movies gives us surprise victories against all odds.
What a relief to realize that this is a quasi documentary, not an underdog fiction.",1332028800,54,1834,4.794303797468355
5092968,5,B007KAUWO2,"""Game Change"", the HBO movie that premiered on Mar 10, 2012, is a relatively brief part of the book, ""Game Change"", written by John Heilemann and Mark Halperin and published in 2010. Basically, the book covers both the Democratic and Republican primaries and general election of 2008. The HBO producers - and Tom Hanks was one of them - decided t0 concentrate on the REAL ""Game Change"", the selection of Sarah Palin by John McCain as his running mate.

Okay, three years, almost four, have passed since August 29, 2008. It was John McCain's birthday and also the launching of the Republican ""secret weapon"" - Alaska's governor Sarah Palin - as his running mate. Cast a woman for the VP slot, McCain was urged by his advisers, including Steve Schmidt. So the campaign searched around that early August for a ""game changer"". They looked at some of the Republican women governors and senators. Hawaii's governor Linda Lingle? Nah, not glamorous enough.  Texas senator Kay Bailey Hutchison? Too old. Maine's two senators, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins? Meh...definitely not glamorous enough. All hardworking Republican women politicians who had worked their way up the political ladder, earning respect from their constituents and their political colleagues.

However, Sarah Palin, then the first-term governor of Alaska... Now, there was someone with sex-appeal that never appeared to end. (Remember, these are white, middle-aged Republican men doing the choosing - and vetting). Not shown in the film was the fact that Sarah Palin had been on Republican ""radar"" for a while. She had met - and charmed - members of the Republican establishment during two Alaskan cruise stops in Juneau, where she was introduced to Bill Kristol and other Republican stalwarts.

In so much of a hurry to blunt the edge that Barack Obama had received during his nomination, held a few days before the Republican convention, McCain and his staff - after a minimum of vetting - asked Sarah Palin if she would accept the nomination for Vice-President. ""Yes, sir"", she sure would, seemingly very self-assured by the chance to hit the big time and sure that it was ""God's will"" that she accept the nomination, despite her woeful unpreparedness for the second highest job in the world.

Anyone reading this review knows that Sarah Palin was one errant cancer-cell away from the Presidency if the McCain/Palin ticket had won in November. The movie, ""Game Change"", with great performances by Julianne Moore, Ed Harris, and Woody Harrelson as well as by an excellent supporting cast tells the story of that 11 week campaign/nightmare as McCain and his team slowly learned how unprepared Sarah Palin was for the job of Vice-President. As the possibility of having unleashed Sarah Palin onto the country finally became clear to Steve Schmidt and Nicolle Wallace, they began to realise the folly of the campaign's decision to nominate Palin. The acting is matched by the intelligence of the screenplay and direction in ""Game Change"". I think it will end up as one of the classic American political movies and serve as a warning that a wink and fancy pageant walk do not make a viable Vice President.",1331942400,26,3167,5.013307984790875
5092969,5,B007KAUWO2,"""Game Change"" is an awesome movie about the McCain/Palin campaign. The film doesn't portray McCain in a bad light at all, and really focuses on what a complete imbecile Sarah Palin (played with Tina Fey-like precision by Julianne Moore) is. I really hope that some of the things in the film are exaggerations, because if Palin really is this much of a moron (and yes, it gets much worse than her claiming that she can see Russia from her house), then I am even more terrified of what this country has come to than I ever was before. In some ways, although the film definitely paints a picture of Palin as being an ignorant (and perhaps even mentally unstable) woman who is absolutely 100% unqualified to hold a government job of any kind, ""Game Change"" also shifts a lot of the blame on McCain's campaign advisors, who suggested Palin for the VP slot without ever doing their homework on her. Yes, she had no business being associated with that campaign in any way, but the real blame falls with the power-hungry strategists who foolishly appointed Palin to the position of McCain's running mate.

I really enjoyed the film, which is amusing and also downright scary at time. The performances are excellent, and Moore will walk away with a Golden Globe for sure.",1331769600,240,1262,4.684684684684685

5092974,4,B007KAUWO2,Spot on in look and sound this is about the 2008 John McCain campaign that is floundering. He has his staff (literally) Google possible VP picks and they come up with the Gov. of Alaska. It appears an out-of-the-box pick and it is put forward without realizing that neither of the two groups responsible for vetting actually DID any vetting. Soon gaffs occur. A sad mess.

5092977,5,B007KAUWO2,"I want to cut some slacks on Sarah Palin, she just had a baby, her daughter was pregnant, her oldest son away at war, she was going through many difficult and complex situations, however, she should have said no when they wanted her for VP, one of the things I assumed is the negative rhetoric, the resurrection of the racial tensions, etc were born with the arrival of Sarah Palin to the political arena",1510876800,,404,4.472972972972973
5092978,5,B007KAUWO2,"As someone who was horrified and disgusted with the Palin addition to the McCain campaign, and with Palin overall, I was hesitant to watch this movie and relive those horrible months. But as a long-time veteran of political campaigns, eventually I couldn't resist. And this movie is actually really, really good. My 5-star rating is for acting and realism and not because I love the storyline, which is tragic. (Disclaimer: I am an Independent who voted Obama but have immense respect for McCain, and was devastated to see him debase himself with the selection of Palin as running-mate.)

Game Change is a close-up of politics and political campaigns that usually only insiders get to see, including the cold-blooded calculations we make to win above all else. It also highlights the intense pressures of campaigns that lead to mistakes like lack of vetting, even on a Presidential campaign where the stakes are the highest for the entire country. Our country easily could have ended up with a second-in-command who knew absolutely nothing about anything other than snowmobiles and shooting wolves out of helicopters. If these mistakes can happen on an intensely-scrutinized Presidential race, think about what is missed when nominees are vetted for Supreme Court (life-long appointments), Cabinet Secretaries, etc. Please, think about it.

The credit for the quality of Game Change really goes to the outstanding acting of Moore, Harrelson and Harris. If those characters hadn't been believable, this movie easily could have been a cheap farce. Moore was particularly outstanding as Palin - still in awe that Moore could so fully embody such a shallow, grasping character that is such anathema to who she is as a real person with such accuracy. Moore never once strays into the easy path of caricature - she portrays Palin with as much depth as Palin may actually be capable of.

If you're interested in a painfully accurate look inside how national political campaigns work and how decisions that effect all of us are made, take the time to watch this movie. But be prepared to be horrified.",1508976000,4,2093,5.060869565217391

5092982,5,B007KAUWO2,"This is my third attempt to post a review: Why does Amazon block reviews with words that are in the movies they show? Good grief!
So the McCain campaign was looking for a bold move, and they decided to pick Palin for Vice President and didn't thoroughly vet her. What. Could. Possibly. Go. Wrong?! This movie will show you in detail. Julianne Moore looks SO much like Palin, I had to look closely at the first news footage to tell it was her and not Palin giving an actual interview. I have the upmost respect for Senator McCain and have developed an admiration for his somewhat cantankerous style. I believe that Ed Harris is one of the finest actors of our time so I was somewhat eagle eyed about how he would embody McCains mannerisms. I was disappointed that he ignored one of the most well known facts about McCain, that he cannot lift his arms above his shoulders due to the torture he suffered as a POW. This particular physical quirk combined with his belligerent delivery has led the press at times to compare him to Popeye. Favorite lines: Joe is perfect, were both mavericks hated by the a-joles in our parties, it could have a tremendous healing effect on the country. This is a woman with a gun, John, the base is gonna do back flips There is a dark side to American populism. Some people win elections by tapping into it. When you lose the moral high ground to Dick Cheney, its time to rethink your life. It was disturbing to see that the rumors about Obama being a Muslim and not an American apparently flourished during this campaign and Palin was instrumental in fomenting the rumors and lies. She is the female Trump  a true narcissist. When she was getting praise and good press, she was happy, but when she wasnt, she pouted and threw tantrums. The movie depicts McCains character accurately as we are seeing it being played out in current events with the GOPs unilateral attempts to repeal the ACA.

5092987,5,B007KAUWO2,"It's hard today to realize how ""out there"" it seemed when Sarah Palin was selected as the as VP candidate for the McCain campaign in 2008. People were amazed at the choice on either side of the political spectrum: Republicans and Democrats. And she had fans and detractors on both sides of the party divide. Selecting Palin was intended to be a ""game changer"" and in that it certainly succeeded though perhaps without the desired results...

If you are a fan or detractor of Sarah Palin or are just interested in presidential politics Game Change can be a compelling movie. It is for me and I think captures Palin's high and low moments in public pretty accurately. Accuracy of the behinds the scenes stuff is harder to know but seems to fit with the public Palin I saw in the campaign.

The casting and acting is excellent. Juliane Moore out does Tina Fey in ""becoming"" Sarah Palin's character in the movie. Ed Harris is extraordinary as John McCain getting many aspects of his body language down precisely. And I always enjoy Woody Harrelson. As Smitty he is excellent. Production is very well done and the story moves along at a pace that keeps me interested. Good acting, directing and cinematography and story line make this a good movie for me.

After the 2016 elections I was surprised to find myself drawn to a movie about the 2008 presidential campaign. But it made a unexpectedly comforting movie for me somehow.

5092994,3,B007KAUWO2,"This documentary is an excellent expose of political handlers and the lengths to which they'll go to try to make a candidate look and act the way they want.  McCain and his people picked Sarah Palin, a woman who courageously stood up to the Republican ""good ole boy"" network in Alaska and made many positive changes in that state.  When she was selected, she had the highest approval rating of any governor in America.  She was picked by McCain's team because she is beautiful, articulate, charismatic, and a proven leader with a record of accomplishment.  What more could they want  from her?  Well, for beginners, her handlers seemed shocked that she didn't know much about foreign affairs.  Apparently, they wanted her to be an expert in national and international affairs.  They tried to press her into their mold through countless briefings.  Her handlers also wanted her to look more sophisticated so they dressed her and her family in designer clothing and changed her hair and makeup.  Mrs. Palin worked hard to try to fit their mold, but it frustrated her.  She already carried a tremendous emotional load as the mother of five with a special needs baby, a pregnant teenage daughter, and a son who had just been deployed to Iraq.  None of her handlers had any sympathy for the load she carried as a mother.  In my opinion, she is the hero of the McCain campaign.  Her handlers all come across as condescending, power-seeking ""know it alls"" who just don't get it. To his credit, prior to his concession speech, McCain expresses appreciation to Palin and acknowledges her gifts.  Clearly, Sarah Palin is a beautiful, charismatic, accomplished woman who values God, family and America.

5093031,5,B007KAUWO2,"I watched this because I was sent some weird chain e-mail that originated with Breitbart stating it was full of fallacy and lies.  I knew that someone must have hit the nail on the proverbial head. It has been apparent to anyone with perception that Palin was not particularly bright since she hit the national scene. Her ""word salad' attempts at being clever that have come out in complete gibberish have become legendary during this election cycle. The fact that she has continued to back Trump at this point in the game (11 days away from the election) in spite of his blatant and sexist attitudes toward women show she is not playing with a full deck. This film shows her as someone who just didn't have a clue about protocol or decorum but had a gift for memorization. That seems to be the only explanation that she was able to get as far as she did on the national stage. It reminds one of Jerzy Kozinski's character Chance the gardener from Being There. People wanted to believe in him so whatever he said seemed plausible and they read something into nonsense. Trump is the same. Harris and Moore both shine in this.",1477526400,3,1124,4.536945812807882
5093032,4,B007KAUWO2,"Very well done. Julianne Moore did a wonderful job impersonating Sara Palin. Without having the freedom to joke around as Tina Fey, she equaled if not surpassed in imitating Palin's demeanor, looks, and speech pattern. The script actually presented a Sara Palin who in many respects was much better as a candidate than I recalled from the press coverings. Woody Harelson also excelled as the campaign manager, as did the McCain impersonator. This film reminded us of the hypocrisy, dishonesty, and shallowness that characterize modern political campaigns. 4 stars",1477440000,,563,5.337078651685394

I did take their portrayal of Sarah Palin's knowledge of foreign policy with a grain of salt though. I mean, I find it real hard to believe that she didn't know that Germany was our enemy in both world wars. That's a bit of a stretch.",1475452800,2,330,4.253968253968254
5093051,3,B007KAUWO2,"The film is hard on Palin and is uncomfortable viewing whatever your politics. John McCain was behind in the polls but was desperate to win. In order to excite potential voters, he was willing to pick an outsider from Alaska as his running mate. Palin knew nothing about foreign policy and was clearly unqualified to be president. However, Republican voters apparently liked evangelical Christians who worshiped Ronald Reagan. Palin was charismatic and had an attractive personality, which is something not captured by Julianne Moore in the film. The movie turns into a hatchet job and I began to feel sorry for Palin. Towards the end of the film, Palin starts to enjoy the limelight and becomes almost delusional. The real Palin has since become a national joke in liberal circles.

Nobody in the film comes out of it well. The film questions McCain's integrity. He was an old man in a hurry and was already 72. He could have died in office leaving Palin in charge. He seemed prepared to take the risk to get his hands on the presidency. The film made me worry about the health of our democracy. Presidents have an almost impossible job given America's role in the world. It requires someone with a huge intellect, but they also have to be likable and thick-skinned. Game Change is depressing because it illustrates that politicians can get elected on charisma alone these days. Competence and common sense are considered boring attributes. FDR and Lincoln may have been Americas greatest presidents but it seems unlikely they could get elected today. It is only a matter of time before someone like Sarah Palin actually wins the presidency.",1475280000,,1642,4.906474820143885

It attempted to show what really went on from the concept through the selection through the campaign.  Ed Norton gave a most sympathetic performance of John McCain, and Julianne Moore was convincing as Sarah.  Woody Harrelson was also convincing.  The movie was about what went on behind the scenes, and portrayed both sides as equally culpable in that disaster.  I had some of my thoughts confirmed about that whole mess, and learned some more.

BTW - this is non-partisan.  It didn't favor nor deprecate either part.  It was just about the story.",1474848000,2,718,4.626984126984127

On the other hand, I felt the movie could have been really interesting if it totally zoomed in and presented everything solely from Sarah Palin's perspective. Make her sympathetic even while she was doing clearly ridiculous or inconsiderate things.

This version tried to do a little bit of both and fell short in both respects.

5093110,5,B007KAUWO2,"Although this movie is ostensibly about Sarah Palin and John McCain, I felt much more drawn the the characters of Steve Schmidt (Woody Harrelson) and Nicole Wallace (Sarah Paulson), the long-suffering speechwriter, unintentional therapist, and babysitter for Palin. Just about anyone else would have dope-slapped Palin upside the head, but Wallace and Schmidt are professionals and interested mainly in doing their jobs, which is to give their best and win the election. This could be seen much more clearly four years earlier when they helped lead George Bush to his second term as president. I feel as though I've come to know those two people over the past few years as regular commentators on MSNBC as economic conservatives who do their best to make the world a better place. I say this as a staunch liberal who disagrees with much of their worldview, but who respects their inherent honesty and compassion. The writers, Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, were evenhanded in their approach to those involved in the McCain bid for president and provided, in my view, a balanced portrayal of events and the people involved. The acting was first-rate, especially Ed Harris's characterization of McCain and the portrayal of Palin by Julianne Moore, who resisted any inclination to reduce the role to a caricature, but instead gave Sarah Palin depth and dignity.  That said, though, although Sarah Paulson looked the least like the woman she was playing, she seemed to inhabit the person, showing the dedication and moral fiber of Nicole Wallace under such trying circumstances. Cynics will find much to complain about in this movie, because it doesn't buy into the notion that all politics are dirty and without redeeming qualities. Rather it is a portrayal of individual human beings doing their best.",1469923200,,1802,5.1084745762711865

5093133,5,B007KAUWO2,This is a very good film. It is dominated by the performance of Woody Harrelson as reluctant McCain aide Steve Schmidt. Watching Harrelson's increasing anxiety and fear as Palin's obvious incompetence becomes evident shows what an accomplished actor Harrelson is. Julianne Moore does a very good job too in her portrayal as Sarah Palin. She somehow avoids making her performance of a woman who in my opinion is a gross caricature not a caricature. I actually had a small bit of empathy for Palin after watching this. As portrayed by Moore Palin is simply a very charismatic woman who happens to not be intelligent and might have emotional and/or psychiatric problems.,1468540800,,667,5.018018018018018

5093143,3,B007KAUWO2,"Good acting helps this somewhat didactic film along.  Julianne Moore is splendid and spookily accurate in ""inhabiting"" the Palin role. This isn't a hatchet job, but a pretty good assessment of how an unprepared but self-confident woman was lured into accepting a task that was far beyond her abilities, or at least far beyond her preparation. In a way the film is an indictment of the U.S. political system and the U.S. voting public for favoring flair and charisma over substance and depth.  We see the same situation at work as we head into the G.O.P. convention this July. I have no way to know for sure, but I think the film is a little too gentle in its treatment of John McCain--I'm not sure he was quite as uninformed about Palin's lack of qualifications as the film portrays.

As a story and character treatment, and as a somewhat imagined account of a personal/political catastrophe, it's a good film.  It's less successful as a work of ""art""; there's some wooden dialogue that seems to be of the high-school skit ""teaching civics lesson"" variety. A few of the informal meetings between jaded political operatives seem pretty concocted.

Woody Harrelson does a good job portraying the frustrations of Steve Schmidt, and Ed Harris is excellent (isn't he always) as McCain.",1467849600,8,1280,4.853211009174312

5093145,4,B007KAUWO2,"Especially interesting in 2016 when John McCain's political ambition has again gotten the best of him.  He gave us Palin in 2008.  Now, he can't put the interests of his country ahead of his desire to be re-elected to the Senate.  I'm a 21-year, active duty Navy vet and can't understand how he so easily forgets what a real hero knows:  Country first, it takes moral fortitude to denounce demagogues like Trump and keep no-nothings like Palin where they belong---in the wilderness.",1467763200,,482,4.841463414634147

5093197,4,B007KAUWO2,"Image, not substance, threatens our political process.  Whatever you think of Sarah Palin's philosophy, she was unprepared to take a political office and made decisions for the country--but she nearly had the chance. This telling of how she was chosen nd prepped as the VP candidate is very well done.  Julianne Moore is brilliant and even sympathetic in portraying a woman who can't admit she is in over her head. Ed Harris as McCain doesn't skip a beat.  Woody Harrelson as the campaign manager,, is as usual, competent and believable. The story is compact, clear and, if you sit back for a minute to reflect, chilling.

5093202,4,B007KAUWO2,"A serious political drama, based on reports out of the 2008 McCain-Palin campaign. Julianne Moore is excellent in the leading role. The movie's focus is on the factors why Gov. Palin began to separate herself from her advisors and handlers and ""go rogue,"" as they say. Palin's policy differences with McCain were one factor; the movie also suggests that Gov. Palin felt alienated and browbeaten by McCain's advisors, who appear to overreact to Palin's lack of foreign policy knowledge and begin to treat her badly. It's an interesting re-creation of what probably went on behind the scenes of the campaign. The movie also shows Palin ""finding her voice"" late in the race. One I wasn't quite sure about was the portrayal of McCain (by a fine actor whose name escapes me now) -- he seemed much more calm, reasonable and wise than we often see him, and less given to profanity. However, there is always something of the honorable soldier in him, and his statement to his top advisor (Woody Harrelson) about the choice of Palin at movie's end seems about right. If you are interested in how campaigns work ( or don't work), this is worth watching.",1464566400,,1143,4.777777777777778

5093206,4,B007KAUWO2,"The real eye opener here was that Palin was a pre-cursor to Trump. She was doubted for her apparent lack of intellect and presidential qualities. But, my how - by the end of the movie - the tables had turned. The people who vote could care less about what's going on in Russia, or even whether you can see Russia from Alaska. The people/voters care about messaging, and the feeling of connectedness to the candidate. Clearly, Palin connected with Republicans voters. She talked their talked. As we are seeing now. Trump is doing the same. You can tell by his speeches that he, like Palin, ain't spending time studying foreign affairs. He's shootin' from the hip, giving the people what they want. Say goodbye to the era of the uppity, Harvard-educated president. We can credit Palin for that.",1464048000,,792,4.746376811594203

The film reminded me of how frantic I felt when I learned something of Sarah Palin as the running mate of John McCain. The woman should have been the head of a ""know nothing"" party. Woody Harrelson was terrific in the role of Steve Schmidt who ran McCain's campaign. Having seen (and listened to) Schmidt after that election cycle ended,  he realized it was a,mistake it was to have her on the ticket.",1463875200,,503,4.588888888888889

Very good film, very entertaining on one hand, and quite upsetting that things moved along to the final outcome that we all watched before our own eyes.  If the story line is even 50% true to fact, I've lost even more respect that I one time had for John McCain.  To be upfront, the fact that I watched the 6pm news back when McCain announced his (their) choice of Sarah Palin as his V.P., that is when I lost half of the respect I had for McCain.  However, very good film, suggest anyone with any political fascinations to watch this one.",1463184000,,655,4.266129032258065

5093225,5,B007KAUWO2,"It's a presidential election year, and a candidate on the right is an ignorant, unpricipled demagogue with a gift for stirring up the basest, most hateful passions among certain segments of the American electorate.  There is danger in the air.

No, we're not talking about 2016, but about 2008. As one views this well-made film, with its focus on Sarah Palin's opportunism, incompetence and personal instability, the feeling grows that what took place eight years ago was some kind of prelude or dress-rehearsal for the current campaign.  I saw it last  night, and it lelft me with butterflies in my stomach.  But it's thought provoking, and well worth your investment of time. Ms. Moore channels Sarah Palin in a virtuoso performance.",1462924800,,735,5.041322314049586

5093238,5,B007KAUWO2,"In 2008, John McCains republican presidential campaign is loosing ground to Barak Obama.  In a move to recover voter popularity, McCain's camp selects the vivacious and popular Governor of Alaska Sarah Palin as the Vice Presidential running mate.  Her infectiously positive personality immediately infuses the champagne with energy, and soon she is being coached by McCain advisors on what to expect as the VP nominee.  To their dismay, it is immediately apparent that the true level of knowledge and understanding possessed by Palin is woefully inadequate to do the job.  True to her self image as a winner and viable candidate, Palin refuses to accept her deficit until it is too late, and brings the campaign and election to a bitter end.
Amazing performances by Julianne Moore, Ed Harris and Woody Harrelson, plus an excellent script make this is one of the best political movies of our time.",1461801600,,896,5.033783783783784

5093252,5,B007KAUWO2,"I've been wanting to see this film ever since I heard about it. 4 years later, I did. Really good film. I liked the pace of it in that it didn't take exhaustively long to introduce Palin into the story. She's brought in at about the 15 minute mark to allow ample time to portray what the process and behind the scenes ongoings were like in the McCain campaign. And don't listen to the disgruntled extremist conservatives who bash the film over ideological leanings, even despite some of them admitting they never actually completed the movie, let alone got that far into it. Had they actually watched the film, they would've realized that in the beginning and middle of it (which encompasses the majority of the film) Game Change and Julianne Moore do a really good job at doing what Sarah Palin herself couldn't do, and that was-humanizing herself to the people. Truth be told, I ended up sympathizing with her and her family, the film was that good at swaying me. But don't get it twisted, I still vehemently disagree with 99.9% of her political, social and economic views and don't want her near any public office making decisions that can affect even a town dog, let alone people.

And McCain is depicted favorably here too. To his and the film's credit, they showed McCain's uncomfortability with a lot of the extremist supporters who held Islamophobic, xenophobic, racist, and jingoistic sentiments just as it had happened in real life (remember the old racist and clueless woman standing up and telling John at a rally that she thought Obama was Arab? As if that was somehow a negative thing). And Woody Harrelson did a really good job in this film portraying Steve Schmidt. I enjoyed seeing him and his character in scenes. I l loved seeing the behind the scenes stuff that was going on in the campaign. That's the butter of this film. Overall, 5 out of 5 for the film, I would definitely recommend it.",1460505600,,1910,4.667655786350148

I do, however, take issue with one thing: Palin was not some unsuspecting rube pulled from obscurity into the limelight.  In reality, she was lobbying for the vice presidential slot for at least a year, courting (and being courted by) influential Republicans at every turn.  So don't feel sorry for her -- she knew what she was getting into.  Or perhaps she didn't, which would be even more disturbing.",1455580800,,466,4.7875

I actually felt compassion for SP, (wasn't expecting that) as her acceptance as the running mate was sincere but terribly naive. I came away with more respect for John McCain, particularly the way he treated the woman  at the rally who called Obama an Arab. He acted very statesman-like, something missing from the present set of Republican nominees. I respect Sarah's decision to continue her pregnancy knowing she was having a child with down's syndrome, but what I cannot stomach from this woman is the obligation to educate herself in favor of her popularity. I thought this portrayed her accurately as I found myself feeling sorry for her on occasion, but she's a woman who refuses to acknowledge that she was too naive, and simply not prepared for a role of this nature.",1454284800,,833,4.825174825174825

5093366,4,B007KAUWO2,"As a relatively steadfast Republican, I could only hope and perhaps imagine that what went on behind the scenes with respect to Sen. McCain's campaign team's selection of then Gov. Palin as his 2008 running mate, was as close to what the movie portrayed.  I believe Ed Harris's characterizations of McCain is as close as Hollywood will ever get to the real Sen. McCain.  As for Palin, Moore was also a great choice.  Had the role been given to Tina Fey (per her timely SNL comedic impersonation of Palin), viewers would have taken the screenplay as a Palin character assassination and/or whether the movie might be nothing more than spoof.  I believe Woody Harrelson's campaign manager character was convincing.  I would recommend this movie to anyone, regardless of their political affiliation, as a well done docu-drama, but not as a tool to influence their respect of either McCain or Palin.

I also remember the sucession of head-shaking events that were touched on in the movie -- starting with Senator McCain's selection of a running mate, and effectively going down the yellow brick road from there. The whole process seemed bizarre at the time, but seeing the process compressed into a two hour movie made me appreciate how really bizarre things had become behind the scenes.

As for the acting, I thought Julianne Moore was scary good as Sarah Palin (which was reinforced by the fact that Ms. Palin apparently wasn't a fan of Ms. Moore's portrayal -- oh, and of course Ms. Moore's Emmy).

What is compelling it that this is obviously such a real and believable tale of a pernicious American conceit that what one person ""feels"" is just as intellectually valid as what can be verified through empirical processes.  I am reminded of the one-time observation of Leonard Nimoy's Mr. Spock (I paraphrase): ""Fascinating.  What a crude, noisome, petty, illogical being.

The real-life Nicolle Wallace (Palin's handler during the campaign) said the movie was ""true enough to make me squirm"". My only complaint about the film was that it gave the impression that McCain lost the election because of Sarah Palin. In fact, he lost because the sitting Republican President (George Bush) had started two wars he couldn't finish - one in a country (Iraq) that had nothing to do with 9/11 - nearly doubled the national debt, and left the country hemorrhaging more than half a million jobs a month.

I think the only way the RNC let this movie be released was if it bashed Palin (right move) and if it made McCain, and the rest of the Republican party look like the moderates everyone wishes they would be.

I feel this showed someone who took the hand she was dealt and made the best of.  Not like the rest of the world doesn't elect those who don't have experience and just hope for the best. How can we expect perfection in others when we don't have it in ourselves.  Those who are trying to fix the system are usually those who are outside the system.

5093418,5,B007KAUWO2,"EXCELLENT movie.
Woody was fabulous, as he always is in any and every role he takes on. Haven't seen a movie yet where he hasn't been absolutely perfect.
Julieanne Moore was amazing as Sarah Palin - there were moments I was just in complete awe at how well she brought out the emotions. Damn, she was GOOD.
Ed Harris has always been one of my favorite actors ever, and he didn't disappoint either: at times he seemed more John McCain than John McCain.
Every single other actress and actor was also ""pitch perfect"".

Entertaining movie to watch as well, though rather chilling in it's implications - not to mention the fact that ""John McCain"" admits at one point in the movie that there is a dark side to American politics.
It's a true shame that in his quest for personal fulfillment, he appealed to and brought that dark side into full flower.

Although this movie detailed Sara Palins understanding of foreign policy as a complete blank page you could not help feeling sorry for her. She was being used by McCains inner sanctum as a ploy to convince party faithful that they cared about everyday people. This was the hogwash. It backfired and they got what they deserved.

Anyway, the movie struck me as pretty reasonable and believable. Although not an expert in acting, I know what I like when I see it, and I thought Julianne, Ed, and Woody were really good. The language was considerably more blue than in my current world (I'm retired), but as I remember when I was out in that cruel world earning a living, not really all that bad.

5093456,4,B007KAUWO2,"Enlightening to see behind the scenes in a political campaign that couldn't stop itself from making a colossal mistake. If anywhere near accurate -- and Schmidt and Wallace say it basically is -- the sloppiness and abdication of responsibility portrayed in this movie in vetting McCain's running mate couldn't have been more lethal to his chances than if they'd all been progressive Democrats. Julianne Moore captures the stubbornness and cluelessness of Palin perfectly, and Harrelson gave a believable performance as Schmidt who saw the disaster train heading to them all and still couldn't jump tracks. Harris played McCain in a lackluster way that didn't do anything to enhance the politicians reputation as a maverick, but if Harris was going for old, tired, and discouraged, he nailed it. Paulson as Wallace reveals more of  the frustrating impossibility of what the operative was saddled with than Wallace typically admits to in public, which is probably to Wallace's credit. The movie shows that just because someone can fire up a crowd with enthusiastic nonsense statements, that doesn't mean she is cognitively or emotionally fit to run a country (although it may say something more sad about those crowds who eat it up).",1441843200,,1231,5.185929648241206

The story was compelling & seemed pretty much how I remember the surface of the campaign going with all the gaffes, jaw-dropping amateurism that Palin often wore as a badge of honor, and complacency as her ever-swelling crowds slurred Obama. But with all the potentially rich material (or maybe not?), either the story was a rehashed account of a one trick pony drawn out over two hours or the actors simply dialed in their performances. Whatever the case, there was a hollowness to the film that left something to be desired.

5093477,5,B007KAUWO2,"I wish I had seen this when it first came out, but it was still very good viewing today. The acting is excellent. Julianne Moore as Sarah Palin is fabulous. I'm perplexed that the Rebublicans were so shortsighted as to pick a VP candidate largely on her anti abortion viewpoint. They were in a bind, according to the movie, wanted a woman running mate and stuck with this premise no matter what. I wish this party would give this stance up for the sake of their existence. Palin was a good woman, but was not vetted appropriately and was very weak with her foreign affairs knowledge. The movie seemed fair showing the strengths and weaknesses of both herself and McCain. Many efforts were made to rectify problems, but to no avail. Often such movies depict at least some bias, but this movie/documentary seemed very fair and accurate.",1440633600,,834,4.680272108843537

5093479,5,B007KAUWO2,"I thought this was an excellent ""behind the scenes"" portrayal of John McCain's campaign for President and the difficulties his aides encountered once Sarah Palin came on board.  Julianne Moore is AMAZING as Sarah Palin!  She nails it!  Watching this movie makes you realize how FRIGHTENING it would have been if John McCain had actually become president, because if he had died in office -- OMG!!  America would have to hide in shame from the rest of the world.  At the time of this campaign -- and to this day - I am utterly still astonished that someone so completely uninformed about our country AND about the rest of the world could ever have been considered for the position of Vice President.  This is a ""must-see"" film to remind Americans that they should always look for INTELLIGENCE and SUBSTANCE in a candidate -- NOT glamour or celebrity, especially if the candidate's brain is a void!  I personally don't keep up that much with politics or even the news, but compared to Sarah Palin, well -- let's just say that she makes even ME look like a genius!",1440374400,,1061,4.641711229946524

5093481,4,B007KAUWO2,"The 2008 race between Obama and McCain was one of the most electrifying political contests in a long time. Anyone not realizing that the addition of Sarah Palin as McCain's running mate was the catalyst in pushing the race into legendary status is in denial. I'm not at all a Palin supporter. But, I came away from this movie totally sympathizing with her. Not that I felt she was treated unfairly, but that the McCain campaign picked her without knowing how much of an insanely poor decision it was. Palin is who she is. They pulled in this poor, ignorant woman and pushed her out there to be eaten by the wolves, and in the political arena, this was GOLD!
The book that this movie is based on has its detractors that claim it's based on facts, inside information and gossip. The authors claim they verified everything. In the world of politics, there's no doubt they found people willing to spill the beans on the McCain/Palin campaign.
It doesn't take long to totally forget that you're watching Julianne Moore portraying Sarah Palin, and not actually watching Palin. She's outstanding!! I've always been a fan of Moore, but holy crap - she nails this!
Woody Harrelson's performance is the standard Woody Harrelson performance. He's a good actor but he basically portrays the same character in every role. That's not to say he's bad. He's convincing.
Ed Harris' portrayal of John McCain is spot on.
But, the main focus is of Palin. The moment she becomes totally self absorbed just after the debate and turns the campaign into her own personal race to stardom is legendary. And she's still trying to ride that wave.
Game Change is really a brilliant example of how politics is in no way about what's best for America and everything about just being the winner.",1440288000,,1763,4.7272727272727275
5093482,5,B007KAUWO2,I've watched this about 10 times over the years.  Loved it every time.  Julianne Moore more than earned her Emmy.

5093490,4,B007KAUWO2,"Good drama about Sarah Palin's part of the 2008 GOP ticket: her selection, impact, detriment to ticket, and in a way ultimate enduring impact on American politics. As such, the movie focuses on her and the McCain camp in the Presidential election that year, rather than being a more evenhanded look at both sides, like the source book of the same name this movie is based on. (Obama already being a ""game changing individual"" in that election, there's no examination of him or H. Clinton's campaigns.) This is not a true representative look at a presidential campaign the way ""War Room"" was of Bill Clinton's campaign, but a drama based on the 2008 Palin run for VP.

GOP viewers will probably dislike this movie, finding much ""lame-stream media bashing"" in it. But the reality is that Palin was a disaster for the McCain ticket (evidenced from the ""Couric interview"") after her initial surge. (As the book ""Game Change"" points out, when even longtime McCain supporters decided not to vote for him for president because of Palin, you know you've made a bad selection.)

The acting is excellent in places, truly capturing people who are still in our consciousness, though some can be wooden performances and not perfect selections. Yet overall, the excellent ensemble cast enlivens the backroom political atmosphere.",1439510400,,1315,5.0
5093491,5,B007KAUWO2,An interesting look at the Palin nomination. Julianne Moore is great as usual.  This movie was more fair to Palin than I expected. I left even more relieved she did not become vice president.,1439424000,,191,4.617647058823529

5093494,1,B007KAUWO2,"It started off pretty well, but not surprisingly, it sunk down to the depths of Hollywood elitism. Sarah Palin is not a stupid woman, quite unlike she's portrayed in this hatchet job of a film. If McCain had allowed her to go after Obama on his do nothing record as a state senator and also as a US senator, very probably the election results would have been different. Julianne Moore played a believable Gov. Palin and Ed Harris, although he didn't look much like McCain, played him as the foul mouthed career politician who blundered his way into snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. It's just amazing that Obama can say he hopes to visit all 57 states and gets a pass on it, but Palin says you can see Russia from parts of Alaska and is made to be the butt of jokes on SNL for weeks at a time. I guess Tina Fey owes her career to that dimbulb Sarah Palin. The more I write, the more annoyed I become. Actually this movie was trash through and through.",1438992000,5,960,4.30939226519337

It also is 'based on true events' so who knows how accurate it is. I did enjoy the parts of the storyline where they are trying to vet her for the debates or interviews.

Makes me feel major empathy for putting a human being through this to win a campaign. However, slime filth ridden politics are the norm. Hopefully more Americans are coming to see the light and refuse to accept the prevalence of avarice, lies and corruption.

Why would people care how a politician's campaign played out, especially one that did not win? This is a fairly unprecedented hit piece by a liberally run cable channel (that I have not subscribed to for many years due to this biased leaning), with no other intent but to smear a political party, and a rising star within it, with a script that is easily proven to be fabricated and gratuitously embellished in many ways.  If you have no better political arguments than to use a fictional drama to malign one of the left's most feared politicians, and you rely on this sort of thing to make you feel better about your mindless hatred for Republicans, then you will LOVE this movie.

While she's not my kind of politician and I find her abrasive I can see that she was truly not prepared for the election antics and she reacted accordingly. In the  final scene between her and John McCain when he advised to not align with the Limbaugh Republicans and also told her she is a just a hockey mom, I can see how this might further push her over the edge.

5093529,2,B007KAUWO2,"Based on a true story doesn't mean the movie is a true story. I followed politics more closely than most for years. I know that Sarah Palin herself is a cartoon character. Julianne Moore's performance here, if you want to call it that, is an even more cartoonish version of the actual cartoon character Palin. That's par for the course as far as Julianne Moore is concerned. She is not now nor has she ever been a good actor, let alone an award worthy actor. Every scene with the hack Moore seems as if she's struggling. Her delivery of the dialogue is slowed in order for her to maintain the Palin accent. The expressions on her face throughout are practically nothing like the real Palin either. Since this is a movie on how the choice of Palin affected the election, the total and utter failure of Moore to in any way capture the real Sarah Palin makes it impossible to call this good. Of course critics loved Moore's portrayal. Critics are liberal and this movie takes a stupid person they all hate and makes her look even more stupid and more ridiculous. The book this is based on was written by political reporters Mark Halperin and John Heilleman. It wasn't written by anybody associated with the campaign so to go back to how based on a true story means practically nothing, it's hilarious to take a book written by 2 men who weren't there, cast the movie with 100% liberal actors who also have no clue what happened but are highly motivated to make all conservatives seem both evil and stupid and then have the super majority of liberal critics call this fiction and this horrible Julianne Moore performance award worthy and fantastic in all ways. It's even more hilariously insane to read reviews here where people write things as if this is 100% what happened. This movie is no more real than Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter. If you think otherwise, you are a sheep that knows very little about the real world. This is coming from me, somebody who's going to be 45 in 11 days and was a Democrat until age 41 and am still more liberal than most today, hates all of politics now and knows that Hollywood is filled with just as many lying hypocrites as the Republican party is.",1435881600,3,2187,4.511335012594459

5093550,5,B007KAUWO2,"Obviously many people are going to have opinions about this movie simply based on their opinions of Sarah Palin.  We will never know what actually happened but there were many scenes in the movie that were accurate.  If you were watching TV or on the Internet at all during this campaign you saw what Ms. Palin was doing and saying and the ""fervor"" she created.  As for the actual movie I  thought that Julianne Moore did an excellent job portraying her and deserved the awards she got for the movie.  There were many times that I didn't see the actress but the real person she was portraying.  That is what I expect from a good actress.  This movie was entertaining.  This is also what expect from a movie of this kind.  Some of it I agreed with and some of it I didn't.  It wasn't a documentary.",1432857600,,797,4.360544217687075

5093553,5,B007KAUWO2,Good movie. Julianne Moore presented Palin in a fair and insightful light.,1431561600,,74,5.25
5093554,4,B007KAUWO2,"I appreciated this movie as a movie and there are two unequivocal stars.  Julianne Moore and Sarah Paulson as Nicolle Wallace.  You sense Nicolle Wallace/Sarah Paulsons need to succeed by the greedy, hopeful, awed look in which Nicolle Wallace looks into Julianne Moore/Sarah Palins face, and how eagerly she shakes her hand.

Politics aside, this is a fascinating film, and all the performances are riveting, and I appreciated this film as a film.

I will say that it made John McCain more moral, and human, and empathetic, and even Sarah Palin/Julianne Moore comes off very human.  She is thrust is an uncompromising situation; she is terrified beyond belief, but she excels, and she delights in the attention she is getting.  She asserts herself, purposefully thwarting McCain.  But she is limited in her abilities, and frustrates everyone around her.

Love her or hate her, I like that the film highlighted Sarah Palins charisma.  You saw her going out of her way to cull favor.  How mothers who had children with disabilities murmuring that no one spoke to them like Sarah Palin did, and I especially recall how she didn't want a boy with Downs Syndrome to be shy, telling him to look up, because she wanted to see how handsome her son would look.

This film is a vindication of sorts for Republicans involved in the 2008 election, and I have to say the players came off very well.  Their fervor and earnestness and even disdain for racism against Obama were vividly displayed.

I appreciated this movie as a movie.  Julianne Moore is Sarah Palin.  Not just in speech and appearance, but in every nuance, and you guess Sarah Palins dark heart and demons.  Also captivating is Sarah Paulson, who I never really knew, but she almost overpowers the film, because she is so darn natural.  Woody Harrelson is also great  who knew Woody from Cheers fame would reach such heights of controversy.

Its a great film.  And I liked it regardless of its accuracy, though it does feel accurate.  It is not set out to condemn Palin, or redeem the Republicans.  It told a story.  And I enjoyed the story.",1429228800,,2094,4.7555555555555555

McCain never wanted her, but couldn't fight the others when it came to picking his running mate!  The others who had many reasons to think she'd be an asset, but overlooked the pregnant daughter, the husbands group associations, the use of her office to get people, and the fact she was falling apart at the seams!  It was a great movie, and explains so much!  It makes you feel very sorry for John McCain!

5093587,3,B007KAUWO2,"Despite the fact that I would have a lot to disagree ideologically with the producers of the movie, I thought it was a fairly good movie, entertaining and with good acting by all the actors.

There movie is undoubtedly a liberal movie, but unlike most that did not get in the way of it being entertaining or engaging. The movie portrays Palin in a very negative and unsympathetic light, as stupid, selfish, and vindictive. McCain, however, is presented in a much more positive light than I would have expected. He is portrayed as a smart, rational politician who simply Wants What's Best for the Country, though we are never told exactly what that is or why it's better than what Obama wants. Liberals would say he ""admirably"" refuses to advertise the anti-White tyraids of a ""Black preacher"" Reverend Wright because ""there is s dark side to America, and some politicians may want to appeal to it, but I never will."" He is shown to be visually unnerved by the enthusiasm for which crowds of supporters oppose Obama. Might it be because he is a Black man named Hussein? The horror! This is the rare liberal movie, which described neocons as they hunger to be described as ""moderate"" and ""not racist."" The real McCain is a lot like this, in his concession speech congratulating Obama for ""overcoming the old injustices that stained our nation and the cruel and painful bigotry of the past. In the movie and in real life, he happily fulfills his moral duty as an old White man to step aside and hand over power to the morally superior non-White.

On the factual accuracy of the movie it is based almost entirely on hearsay, and of course McCain and Palin deny everything, although it is notable that Steve Schmidt, a character in the movie and the real life ""senior Mccain campaign strategist"" has said about the movie that ""Ten weeks of the campaign are condensed into a two-hour movie. But it tells the truth of the campaign. That is the story of what happened."" Whether or not we believe this movie's narrative of Palin, the fact that Schmidt was the ""senior Mccain campaign strategist"" tells us how incompetent, or simply apathetic to his own success, John McCain was. Perhaps the GOP really is America's ""controlled opposition.""",1410998400,5,2230,4.744845360824742

And the story is a spot on portrayal of the events involving McCain's selection of Sarah Palin as his VP running mate (events that had been well chronicled by several political scholars).  Julianne does portray Palin in a somewhat sympathetic light, but even with that factored in, the story shows the many cringe inducing moments of Palin's campaign efforts--which showed Palin as being extremely unqualified to run for high office.  Truth is indeed stranger than fiction.

In the movie, Ed Harris' McCain character alludes to Palin being one of the future leaders of the Republican party. But in the hindsight of history--the current to date record shows that Mrs Palin has done nothing to deserve that sort of prediction.  In fact, she is a national laughing stock.",1405555200,,828,5.0588235294117645

If the campaign was half as disastrous as is portrayed then I don't see how John McCain and his advisors survived those last months. And I find it retched that Sarah Palin was chosen in the manner shown, it seems that all they cared about was winning @ any cost.
If you are a Liberal; you will laugh and say, Oh, look how close we came to a catastrophic meltdown of the process used in choosing the person to fill the highest seat in the land and if you're a Conservative youll see it as, Sarah Palin being hung out to dry, allowing her to take the brunt for all that was wrong w/ the Bush Administration, while the Senator put as much space as was humanly possible between him and the President.
Woody Harrelson, Ed Harris and Julianne Moore mirror their actual counterparts; the acting was outstanding; and there were times when I forgot that it wasn't Ms. Palin herself on the screen.
In the beginning Woody Harrelson asks the question of the American people, Do you want a celebrity for President; or a national hero? Sadly by choosing the woman they did they put the biggest celebrity of 2008 out front; and almost w/ in reach of being only a heartbeat away from the most powerful position in the world.

5093616,5,B007KAUWO2,"After having seen this film, I do have a bit more respect for Sarah Palin. Not for her political and philosophical views but for the fact she had to endure media coverage which few of us will ever have to sustain. Most of us do not understand what it is like to be ripped to shreds in the media. I do not believe the media has ""liberal bias"", but at the same time the media is always looking for a good story. When political celebrities hit the stage at the national level, they become targets of a lot of scrutiny. If a political celebrity from a smaller state becomes involved in a presidential campaign, the media begins dissecting them with a microscope. While this is not necessarily unfair, it can be quite jarring for those not used to it.

""Game Change"" is one the best film I have seen thus far in 2012, with the exception of ""Tinker Taylor Soldier Spy"". ""Game Change"" takes us behind the curtains of a US presidential campaign, exposing the great wizard as being just very human people trying to do their best to win a presidential election. When John McCain's campaign stagnated towards the end of the summer in 2008, his advisers recommended he needed a ""game change"", something new which would ignite interest in their candidate. Their strategy was adding little-known Alaska Governor Sarah Palin to the republican ticket as the vice-presidential nominee. The film explores both the good and not-so-good consequences of this choice. Palin became both an over-night sensation and the target of political journalists who questioned her qualifications.

Julian Moore offers the performance of a lifetime as Gov Sarah Palin, a likable ""hockey mom"" from Alaska who knows how to make great speeches and connect with voters. Her introduction and her speech at the Republican Convention made her the star of the 2008 presidential campaign, only out-shown by Barack Obama. During one scene, McCain's political advisers point out she and Obama are the real stars, excluding McCain and VP Joe Biden from such accolades. At the same time, she was uninformed about a lot of current issues outside of Alaska and became the target of a slew of attacks by political journalists who felt she was ultimately unqualified for the job.

I do remember being amused by the caricature of Palin by Tina Fey on several Saturday Night Live sketches, some of their best comedic material in years. In this film, clips of those sketches are shown with Palin and her family members watching. I realized those things can be very hurtful to newcomers and their families if they're not used to having their images displayed simply for entertainment purposes. (To SNL's credit, one of the sketches involve both Palin and Hillary Clinton, which demonstrates they were poking fun at both sides.) Palin had never before been on the national stage, and ridicule does occur from many unforeseen places. When the media began digging into aspects of her personal life which were irrelevant to the campaign itself, particularly concerning her daughter, I did feel the media had gone too far at the time, and that does seem to be the message here.

I believe the portrayal was honest, and I don't believe this was meant as a further bashing of Sarah Palin. One of the points of the film was that the national political stage is something different than local politics. An Alaskan evangelical governor who may have won her office because of charm and charisma may not translate as well on the national stage. The press did bring the many skeletons inside Sarah Palin's closet, something most of us would not appreciate. At the same time, that is the national press' job. I want David Gergen, Katie Couric, Mark Shields, David Brooks, Anderson Cooper, John King and Wolf Blitzer to tell us who these people are. This is not about bashing people for the sake of bashing people. It is about informing us about who we are electing. And fair or unfair, that process can be a bit brutal for those not used to it.

5093624,4,B007KAUWO2,"Talk about pinning your political future on one roll of the dice and that dice is virtually unknown Sarah Palin, newly-elected governor of Alaska, as your partner on the GOP ticket in 2008 US presidential election. This docudrama is one of the best portrayals of the world of big-time politics where decisions are often made more on gut instincts rather cool-headed calculation and cunning. The campaign was maverick John McCain's one big opportunity to take the White House on behalf of moderate right-wing interests. The problem here, however, is that times have changed. The GOP based has moved further to the right and a new Democratic star in the person of Obama has arrived on the scene. Lurking in the weeds, ready to ambush the campaign, is a whopper of an economic recession. McCain's strategists told him that victory was only possible if he was prepared to do the unthinkable and find a VP who was both a woman and appealed to the conservative base: a decision that would tie his hands and prove a huge miscalculation. The film focuses on how Palin became that improbable candidate that was expected to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, and why she proved to be such an abysmal failure. Everything covered here is well-documented reconstruction of the story: Palin is seen as an air-head, intellectually lazy, full of herself, dishonest, and indifferent to issues. How could the powers that be get it so wrong? While I am not convinced that Palin's nomination was the main cause of GOP losing the election, it does point to what happens when those in charge don't do their due diligence and ask the right questions in vetting a candidate whose geopolitical knowledge amounted to knowing that Russia was on the other side of the Bering Strait.",1387065600,,1759,4.847176079734219
5093625,4,B007KAUWO2,"How accurate is this movie?  Being honest, I can't really know (nor can you), but it seems reasonably accurate based on what I observed during the campaign, though some reviews allege discrepancies that could have been avoided, so I'll rely on their fact-checking and deduct a star.

Otherwise, the movie (let's not say documentary) is very entertaining and gripping (in fact, I've watched it twice), and it insightfully depicts the kinds of troubling machinations that occur in politics, and which surely occurred big time during McCain's campaign.  The acting is also top notch across the board.

What to conclude?  Some may want to defend Palin, but it seems quite clear that Palin was grossly underqualified to be VP, much less President, in terms of her temperament, intellect, knowledge, and experience, and the movie conveys that well.  McCain and his team made a whopping and foolish mistake picking her, and we're lucky that she didn't find her way into the White House. Scary stuff ...",1386979200,,995,5.036585365853658

I'm sure there are even fewer who can forget the spot-on impersonation of the Governor by SNL's Tina Fay.  Well, Julianne Moore brings us another stunningly accurate performance that will leave you simaltaniously baffled and rolling on the floor...line these three ladies up and you'll be hard-pressed to identify the real person.

Based on the book of the same name which goes much further and analyzes just about every aspect of the 2008 presidential election, this movie has no short-comings despite the fact it only shows us 1/3 of it's printed source material.  I do have to say that I most enjoyed Ed Harris's performance as John McCain.  Perhaps Julianne Moore's performance might have had more of an impact had we not seen Tina Fay's performances beforehand.  That isn't to say that Ms. Moore's performance wasn't steller and deserving of praise, but Mr. Harris' performance gave us some serious prospective on John McCain's character, expanding it far beyond what the media has often shown us.

Still in disbelief about how someone of such meager qualifications came to be chosen as a vice-presidential nominee, I was eager to see this movie, but came away from it feeling pity for Sarah Palin and ashamed at the people who made such a mean-spirited and cruel film.

Based on a book that covered the_entire_2008 presidential election- including the primaries- the filmmakers chose to_only_dramatize those instances in which Sarah Palin is made to look like a mentally unhinged idiot. Now, I have no reason to doubt that these scenes actually happened; several of the principals have verified their accuracy. I don't think she was a qualified candidate. But to make an entire movie for the sole purpose of laughing at and mocking a woman for her lack of eloquence and knowledge seems like the height of malice and immaturity. Would these lefties who get such a kick laughing at Sarah Palin's discomfiture want their own mothers or wives to undergo the same media lynching because they didn't know what the Fed was or couldn't give a lecture on the origins of the Korean War?

The Left has an strange and unhealthy animus for Sarah Palin that seems to send them into apoplexy whenever she ""rears her head"" in public. For someone who never held national office, their hatred for her is remarkable, and the fact that this horribly hateful movie was even made is evidence for their derangement.",1379635200,,1481,4.873015873015873

John McCain perhaps comes off as a little too perfect. We see a compassionate maverick whose only fault, it seems, is that his top aides did a poor job of vetting his running mate.

Game Change raises the important questions of whether it's more important to stick to your more noble instincts when doing so will mean you have no chance of winning the election and leading the country that you love.

On reflection, perhaps too many in the cast of characters come across as noble and good intentioned. No doubt many are but in real life things tend to get scrappier, dirtier, certainly on the campaign trail.

How they arrived with Sarah Palin is not really explained in any deth other then  a.few misconceptions they had based on her Alaska tenure as governor.
The film quickly shows.the real Sarah Palin whose understanding ,I should.say lack of understanding , from everything from political geography to elementary government terminalogy. YOU can see the jaws drop on the McCaine team as she did not know the difference between north and south Korea or what the FED was. You really started to wonder if this ignorance was just limited to their choice or was it more wide spread within congress. Do we have reprenatives elected on charisma alone
Julianne Moore was so convincing at her disapproval of her own running mate Ed Harris who plays McCaine on certsin important topics and how she.needed to straighten the public out on her important message. ""USA,USA.
What this film did was to show that when  push came to shove she could pull off her lack of.any knowledge and still gather so much support. Her self importance was stressed .It was.like.watching THE WIZZARD OF OZ where Palin was behind the curtain pulling her own strings.

5093663,3,B007KAUWO2,"Most people, particularly liberals, like to point their fingers at Sarah Palin and say, ""John McCain lost the election because of her!  She's a dimwit!""  That would obviously be wrong.  I said six months before the election -- much to many of my Republican friends' chagrin, who weren't friendly after my remarks -- ""McCain can't win.  He's too old.""  During an election, people aren't necessarily looking at today; they're looking eight years down the road, as they should.  And voters were correct to think that he wouldn't be capable of leading perhaps earlier than that eight-year point.  Truth be told, if Mr. McCain had chosen Barack Obama as a running mate, Mr. McCain STILL would have lost, as Mr. McCain was such a weak candidate.  Perhaps even against (God forbid) twilight-zone-candidate Joseph Biden in 2008, assuming that it would have been possible for Mr. Biden to run for president.

And surely Mr. Biden was never a viable candidate, and never will be.  Much is made in this film about Ms. Palin's lack of foreign policy knowledge.  I remember one point in the movie that Woody Harrelson said something like, ""She doesn't even know why there IS a north and south Korea.""  Well, I don't even know the full history myself, and I surely know more than the average about politics.  But while Ms. Palin should have had understanding of issues such as these, particularly as a vice presidential candidate. . . .

At least Ms. Palin seems to understand United States law overall, something that Mr. Biden does not.  For example, all you have to do is read a little about the advice that he gave his wife about using a shotgun.  Now, even children in the US know that you can't shoot a gun through a door, or shoot a gun in the air, some advice that he seems to like throwing around.  I'm not for gun control, but I am for gun control when it comes to Mr. Biden.  Thank God he has the Secret Service to protect him; we surely don't want him carrying a loaded gun around.  (And his behavior during the vice presidential debates was completely unacceptable.  Naturally, laughing at your competition is not a valid argument, kind of like mine until this point, which I am now about to explain.)

Now naturally, I am throwing out potentially a red herring myself -- ""Changing the subject"" as it were -- when I discuss Mr. Biden in this review instead of the subject of the film, Ms. Palin.  And perhaps the same goes for Mr. McCain as well, who I personally have no feelings for either way.  I just want to throw out a warning to the left:  as soon as Mr. Biden is out of office -- he might run in 2016 but he has no chance of winning, or even getting his party's support -- the right will have their day.  ""Paybacks are a female dog,"" as they say.  And he will be skewered at that time by more than one documentary.  And he will drift away into obscurity, as he should.

(Quick little reason why I didn't like this film:  why trash someone that's already been trashed ad nauseum before?  Why didn't they bring something interesting to the table instead?  And why didn't they admit that Mr. McCain had zero chance in that election himself?

Ed Harris nailed John Mc Cain and I found myself realising I didn't know the ""real"" John McCain as well as I thought I did. His language is horribly colorful. I expected his (John McCain's) character to be more poised, more polished, but he is brutily crude and I found myself thinking he is a bad mouthed jellyfish without the sting. Woody Harrelson can do well with any role and just gets his teeth in and won't let go, so he comes off very authentic.  Julianne Moore is inspiring! Untill this role I did not realise how talented she is!!  Bravo!
Now the tough part.  IF you have been a follower of American Politics as I have, you'll find yourself not so much a fan after this movie. So many including very prominent (top placed politicans) have NO scrupples. There were no real characters that stood up amd said, ""we cannot inflict Sarah Palin on the American people and the world for that matter"". In the movie she held her baby son, but I must say I have seen NO video of her doing this, and if you watch the videos and not the movie you will notice that it is her youngest daughter that held the baby more than anyone. I used to scream at the TV, ""isn't there one of you idiots that are afraid this sweet little girl is going to drop this growing baby"" (Trig)!! I felt so sorry for her. The older girls hardly held the baby, the father almost never and Sarch herself, had other more important people to take care of -- mainly herself.

5093686,5,B007KAUWO2,"I present to you the party which brought us Michelle Bachmann, Mitt Romney, Rick Santorum, George W. Bush, Mike Huckabee, Paul Wolfowitz, Ann Coulter, Rush Limbaugh, Rick Perry, Todd Aiken, Richard Mourdock and Sean Hannity.  {Is there any wonder that Bobby Jindal called Republicans ""The party of stupid""?}  In this pantheon of intellectually challenged politicians and pundits, one would think that it would be mighty difficult to surpass them all.  Mirror mirror on the wall....who is the most clueless Republican of them all?  Answer:  Sarah Palin!!

GAME CHANGE is a ""behind the scenes"" look at John McCain's political Hail Mary that was ultimately picked-off and returned for a Touchdown by the Obama campaign in 2008.  Needing to gain some traction in an untenable milieu, he felt that he needed a person to energize the conservative base and propel him to victory.  Seemed like a much better idea at the time than it did in retrospect, but his gambit was to choose a woman who was a couple years removed from being mayor of Wasilla, Alaska.

This is a very well done film.  Tina Fey is a brilliant comedian and the nation owes her one for her SNL satiric reductio absurdum that she imprinted on the notion of having Sarah Palin as the VP of the United States.  However, Julianne Moore's task was more daunting than Tina Fey's as Moore was not doing a parody of Palin.  The resemblance was remarkable & she nailed Palin's mannerisms;  a few times I had to do a double-take to confirm that it wasn't the former governor of Alaska whom I was watching!

Ed Harris is terrific as John McCain & one feels sorry for a war hero who ended up losing control of his own campaign.  The best performance in the film, however, belongs to Woody Harrelson.  Portraying campaign advisor Steve Schmidt, one feels empathy for the man who suggested Palin to be McCain's running mate, only to discover later that he had created a political Frankenstein.  Harrelson has come a long way since playing a dumb bartender on CHEERS.

Ultimately, this is what I call an end-of-the-world movie that is structurally similar to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/By-Dawn-s-Early-Light/dp/B00021R7CG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">By Dawn's Early Light</a>.  Like DAWN's / LIGHT, this is the story of the world coming right to the edge of apocalypse, only to back away from the precipice at the last possible moment.

If you're anything close to being a rational American, the same is likely to happen to you as well!",1365552000,10,2618,5.027842227378191
5093687,3,B007KAUWO2,"I notice there are a lot of far right reviewers screaming ""all lies"", which is most assuredly untrue, in fac the film didn't go far enough and fabricates quite a few accounts:

1) Sarah Palin was not ""discovered"" by an aid and thrust into this. If that had been the case, I probably would've had more sympathy for her and dismissed her mean girl antics. She had applied for the spot and met with McCain in Feb of 2008. While she was a surprise pick (AKA McCain's ""Hail Sarah"" pass), she was known and had pursued this, enitrely of her own intiative.

2)Likewise, the Bill Ayres thing had already been tried and failed. Everyone knew about it. SP brought up the ""pallin' around with terrorists"" because they were losing so badly at that point, they were grasping at straws.

3) As noted above, John McCain more often than not threw temper tantrums and behaved like a baby. He was nothing like the way he was portrayed.

4) Palin didn't ""do okay"" in her Charlie Gibson interview (basically it marks the beginning of her rapid descent) and her debate performance was hardly a winner. While she didn't throw up on herself or run screaming out of the studio, the film ignored her bizarre winking, constant ""maverick"" insistance and laughable non-stop references to Wasilla and portraying it as the epicenter of the universe.

The only news outlets or pundits who credited Palin as having won, were deeply conservative ones. Everyone else awarded the debate to Biden. Which really didn't matter, because they were trailing wildly at that point and John McCain had repeated embarrassed HIMSELF in his debates. Plus it was the Vice Presidential debate, it meant nothing-----Lloyd Bentsen cleaned future VP Dan Quayle's clock in their debate---and he still lost horribly.

5) It's interesting that Steve Schmidt is portrayed as the voice of reason here----because all those horrible ideas from the McCain campaign were his! He's the one suggesting ""suspend the campaign"", which made McCain seem like an ineffectual moron. In fact this film makes all the advisors appear to be supposedly smart people making really, really bad decisions.

6) During the BBQ they discuss Palin desperately missing her family. The Palins actually were with Sarah for the bulk of the campaign, so while it's udnerstanding the debate prep time would've perhaps sequestered her for a few days, it's hardly as if she were separated for them for an extended time. Also, Track's job in Iraq was to chauffer visiting VIPs around the safer parts of the country. He was forced to enlist because of a ""prank"" he pulled, involving cutting school bus brake lines.

Basically, Sarah Palin read the telepromter well and made some sneering remarks at the Republican National Convention. This marked the McCain Campaign's brief (2 week) lead during the election. The rest of the time was one of the most absurd campaigns (for both McCain and Palin) ever.",1364774400,54,2909,4.910386965376782
5093688,5,B007KAUWO2,"I felt compelled to write my first review on amazon as I thought the quality of the movie was truly amazing. The movie does a phenomenal job of painting a broader picture of the election 2008 especially McCain's campaign.
1. The movie paints that Sarah Palin is someone who cannot handle pressure and there is ample evidence in the media about this.  She is often seen scolding the major networks and being defensive
2. The movie depicts that she has poor knowledge of the world. Yes, i remember the Russia being visible from Alaska story.  I am not so sure if that is too much of an evidence to conclude that Sarah may not be a great VP.
While there may be exaggerations in the movie, it proved itself a great entertainer. It is rather scary that our country may have come so close to electing an incompetent and incoherent official to high offices should the evidence is true.",1364688000,5,878,4.515723270440252

5093693,5,B007KAUWO2,"I know this is a film based on the 2008 Republican presidential campaign, but I found it to be an ABSOLUTELY fascinating story of EXPECTATIONS and of REALITY.  Before becoming the Governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin was the mayor of Wasilla -- population 7,831 (2010 census).  She was tapped to be the running mate of John McCain (whom I admire) with high hopes of wowing the American public.  She did so in the beginning -- until she started talking.  Bit awkward since she clearly showed no knowledge of American policies (domestic or foreign).  My hat off to Julianne Moore for portraying Sarah Palin so perfectly, and to Woody Harrelson and Ed Harris for their great acting!  Moral of the story - even with the best intentions by a group of very smart people, you can't make up for the person's ignorance. This movie reminds me of Will Rogers' quote:  ""When you know you are full of bull, keep your mouth shut.""  All that aside, this is a wonderful movie to see!",1364428800,2,962,4.584795321637427

I am sure she wanted to be in aposition where she could do more but unfortunately with the time and pressure was not prepared on time to do so. For this reason she gets mocks without compassion by the opposing party and media. She withstood couragelously like the patriot that she is and today continues to fight for American rights.

If this movie is mostly true, at least I  now understand how she could be so terrible in interviews but a ""comedy"" hit at the podium; her debate prep reminded me of how I studied for a final in a course I rarely attended.",1363651200,,492,4.051546391752577
5093701,5,B007KAUWO2,"This is very realistic with Moore's acting being extraordinary. She really seems to actually be Sarah Palin in the movie including the accent she adapted to sound like Sarah Palin.
I am not a Sarah Palin fan but Moore's balanced portrayal left me feeling much more sympathy for what Palin and her family went through in her deciding to accept the nomination for Vice President than I had previously felt.
While we all know Palin has made a lot of mistakes and has showed her basic ignorance about a lot of issues on national TV, I never really thought about what humiliating herself like that made her feel. Yes, she seems strong as nails and confident in public but in the movie some of this is depicted as bravado and I think that anybody ridiculed the way she was ridiculed had to have some human reactions as a result...e.g. depression, self doubt and anger.
I think that, even though I disagree with her political position, I would respect Palin more if she could just admit that she is wrong or misinformed about certain things. The fact that she defends her mistakes in the light of them being blatantly false makes me think she would be dangerous in a powerful position and this movie supports my opinion in this area.
As usual Ed Harris gives a great performance but Woody Harrelson gives one of the best performances that I have ever seen him give and that is saying a lot. I hope he won an Emmy like Moore did for this movie.
One final thing. When this film came out there was considerable criticism that it was not an accurate account of McCain's choice to make Palin his running mate or a fair portrayal of Sarah Palin.
I disagree with that criticism and my stance was formed by many other sources besides the book of the same name on which this movie is based. These sources are not only other books and articles but Palin's own words and actions. Almost everything in this movie that is not a dramatized depiction of the characters in private can be corroborated by other reputable sources and, therefore, I think this movie is very informative as well as very entertaining
Anyway, I HIGHLY recommend this movie and bought it for several people...including somebody I know who LOVES Palin...for Christmas and they all liked the movie as much as I did. Truly a ""must see.""",1363478400,2,2286,4.591687041564792

I don't know what it was, exactly. There's just something about it that makes me not want to leave five stars.  I would recommend this movie to others.",1361577600,2,577,4.218181818181818
5093719,5,B007KAUWO2,"The acting of the 3 main characters (Julianne Moore, Ed Harris and Woody Harrelson) is just right on. The back story is fascinating. It's amazing to see Julianne Moore's portrayal of Sarah Palin that you forget you're watching a character in a movie. It's definitely an eye opener for American Politics.",1361577600,2,303,4.96078431372549
5093720,5,B007KAUWO2,"Wow, I don't think I've seen a movie this good in a long time, and really that shouldn't be a surprise, it isn't a block buster cinema release. It isn't the genre that generally attracts work of this caliber and it seems so well nuanced and balanced.

Firstly, I don't know how accurate the details are. Wikipedia mentions some responses from characters that feature heavily in the film (in particular Steve Schmidt portrayed superbly by Woody Harrelson) indicating it is pretty on the mark. However so much emphasis seems to be put on the accuracy of Sarah Palin's character portrayal (by Julianne Moore in a truly stellar performance) but that is not what this movie is about. It is about the politics and process of choosing Sarah Palin and the effect this then had. It is immaterial if she took a lot of notes and didn't know this or that. I'd argue that the public is aware of what these bits are derived from but it does not impact what the movie is trying to communicate: In politics you have to make choices and your ideal solution may not be available. This is cast in McCain's choice of running mate for the 2008 election and I think it done extremely well.

And I think this movie is made for all audiences, be that left or right leaning (or middle ground), in that it uses Palin as a metaphor that decisions have lives of their own, be that internal (i.e. her family, background, knowledge and character) or external (such as what happens after you choose, here nominate, them). Thus the accuracy of the Palin character is immaterial, and on that subject, it isn't really that she is portrayed negatively, if anything I feel that her efforts were very genuine. I may not agree with conservative politics in the USA (or in Australia for that matter) on every point, but the movie did not portray her as a nut.

But enough about Palin, and whether or not she is in this movie. The movie is a drama that compacts several month of campaign work into about two hours. The acting from everyone is superb, that includes everyone, be that minor roles to the top billing. Direction, by Jay Roach, who I had not realized I enjoyed the work of, does a great job. The camera work is clean, the on screen dialog is focused and intense.

What makes the movie so good though is how it is put together. Everything is fantastic, with the only detriment being that the last 20 minutes or so just go too quickly. But that is probably the strongest defense I can give to the notion that this is not about Palin, but about the decision and the politics. If this movie had been about her (the person) the movie would have been 15 minutes or more longer and gone into more examples of things she did on record that portray her in a negative light. Instead it mostly forgets about her ... escapades, and instead focuses on where the decision lead.

Being based on something incredibly publicized to the point that there was nothing in the movie I hadn't heard in the news in Australia, I'd guess that this movie won't surprise anyone ... SPOILER ALERT: McCain does not win the election. But that's okay, because it gives you an insight into what might have been some of the internal discussions that might have occurred. Incidentally, I would also argue that the accuracy of those is not that material, because the objective of portraying a (real or fictitious) decision is complete. Also, being political the movie certainly had the potential to be a bit dry, but it wasn't. The actors are stellar and keep you interested and the quirkiness of Palin and intensity of Schmidt keep you engaged. This movie truly is a testament to just how fantastic Harrelson and Moore are, but (again) every actor in here does a fantastic job.

If you have any interest in politics or enjoy some food of thought, this is a movie you should give a go.",1361577600,2,3821,4.546511627906977

This woman should NEVER have been nominated for the Vice Presidency.

They threw her into the deep end of the pool with no preparation.  Watching her subsequently sink might have been the preferred outcome for an openly gay Democrat like me -- but it's precisely because I'm gay that I can't stand watching somebody thrown into a situation in which she (or he) is guaranteed to lose.

I gave this 5 stars because I think that even if you're like me, and you don't like Sarah Palin, you'll come away from this movie appreciating the degree of real work it took for her to get as far as she did, and how hard it must have been for her to realize that she was playing out of her league.

Had Senator McCain won the presidential race, this uniquely unqualified, opinionated, and exceptionally ill prepared individual might have become the head of the most powerful country in the world. How this became a real possibility should be of the greatest importance to all citizens of our country. No story better illustrates both the weaknesses and strengths of democracy as a form of governance. Nor has her political party learned the lessons of this story, as the most recent presidential race demostrates.

  The story is of recent origin and, as far as this observer can recall, what is portrayed on the screen is very close to what actually happened. More than that, it tells us in detail much of the story that we were not privy to. The portrayals of the major individuals involved, by Woody Harrelson, Ed Harris, and especially Julianne Moore, were exceptionally lifelike and convincing. That this production was available only once on television and never in motion picture theaters is unfortunate, since it richly deserves a uch wider audience.

Rick Davis was McCain's campaign manager and his character (played by Peter MacNicol) is featured in this film...what he says in this quote from the film is, unfortunately too true. The game change in the movie plot is of course the nomination of Sarah Palin, the governor of Alaska, as McCain's vice presidential candidate. And, while I think the liberal bias of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann (the co-authors of the source book, ""Game Change"") are reflected in this film adaptation, the movie is - surprisingly perhaps - not a hatchet job on Sarah Palin. She and her candidacy are shown with some fairness and sympathy. John McCain and the members of his campaign staff are also portrayed fairly, for the most part. The performances by Julianne Moore as Palin; Ed Harris, as McCain; and Woody Harrelson as Senior Campaign Strategist, Steve Schmidt, are superb, with the edge going to Moore...her portrayal of Palin (at least physically) is even more dead-on than Tina Fey's.

5093730,5,B007KAUWO2,"In 2008 the McCain campaign found themselves needing a 'hook' to win the presidential election. They were facing a very tough race.

It is a different environment than the 1984 campaign, where Geraldine Ferraro made history as the first ever candidate nominated by a major political party. But it was 'safe' for the GOP to now nominate a woman VP candidate. There would be no incumbent president in the Oval Office, women served as Attorney General, National Security Adviser, and Secretaries of State. They weren't 'breaking bariers'. They were trying to win voters.

Observing rail-close Democratic primary competition between front-runners Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, McCain's campaign believed in their strategy. Party officials obviously believed that women upset/frustrated about Clinton not obtaining the Democratic presidential nomination would defect over to the GOP ticket.

Rushing to get these votes, the GOP team did forget to carefully screen prospective candidates.

So instead of picking the experienced Olympia Snowe or Susan Collins (among other GOP moderates), they ended up with Sarah Palin. This little-known Alaska Governor was a favirote among social and economic conservatives. She was not however, prepared for harsh national spotlight.

Teenage daughter Bristol was not following the party abstinence only platform.  And Sarah Palin lacked basic domestic and foreign policy knowledge. Great at delivering 'sound-bite' quotes, she lacked the intellectual depth expected of federal executive officials.

If she was supposed to represent the 'modern woman' GOP party officials apparently still did not like or trust us. McCain became nationally portrayed as ill-prepared and dangerous if inside the Oval Office. His polling suffered because of the trade off through nominating Palin. She was the best campaign ad which the DNC could have concocted. Election exit polls found only 39 percent of voters believed Palin was ready to lead the country in the event of a crisis when McCain was unavailable. Gaffes about Revere and Russia expertly muted Obama's 'inexperience'.

The actors and script writers did a hauntingly realistic job. It actually looks like their real-life persona. The McCain campaign itself becomes humanized. They desperately try to make the best they can with this horrible experiment gone bad. She's wrecked any practical chance he has at the presidency and he's actually being nice to Palin and her family. Amazing.  I still wouldn't have voted for him.

Ed Harris does a great job portraying McCain, who seemed to truly want a positive change for this country and Woody Harrelson was an awesome campaign manager.  The radical conservatives will surely go on a tirade about how this is a leftist piece of propaganda but the fact is, the movie was made with the support of aids who had direct contact with Palin throughout the campaign and saw how ignorant she was of politics.  It's no surprise she stepped down from the governor's office shortly after all of this.  Anyway, this is a very entertaining movie (NOT a documentary) of the 2008 campaign and one that I'm sure will be used frequently in the future of political science studies (I've already recommended that it be shown for extra credit at my school).

Pailin is shown in this film to be a woman thrown into the national spotlight without any preparation nor vetting by her own party. She's shown to have little historical knowledge which we know to be true from the many interviews and statements she made during and after the Presidential campaign. She's portrayed as a devoted mother and wife, charismatic yet provincial, narcissistic and emotionally immature. She's represented as a political fighter who suffers from intellectual atrophy, the polar opposite from the traditionally conservative McCain.

Moore's performance was outstanding and she nailed many of Pailin's mannerisms and speech. The script if anything attempts to redeem the negative perception of traditional Conservatives who mixed themselves with radical right wingers which lead to the highjacking of their own party. As Jeb Bush has remarked Ronald Reagan nor his own father, George H.W. Bush, would have enjoyed much success in today's ultra-conservative, intensely partisan Republican party, a hint towards the Tea Party movement which Pailin calls her base.

5093755,5,B007KAUWO2,"""Game Change"" is not a political cliff hangar if you followed the presidential campaign of 2008 and followed Sarah Palin to the present. What makes it a cliffhanger is that this person could have been a heartbeat away from the presidency, a candidate so ignorant that she could have answered the question without qualm, is she smarter than a 5th grader.

The movie begins with Steven Schmidt being asked a question on ""60 Minutes"" by Anderson Cooper, and he goes back in time when John McCain, who is running dead last in the primary, asks him to be his senior campaign strategist. We see McCain, played by Ed Harris, magically capture the Republican Party's nomination for president but well behind Obama in the polls. As his team observes, Obama is a celebrity and they decide they need the same to close the gap with Senator Obama. But who can match his charisma? They find Sarah Palin (played by Julianne Moore) and select her after only five days of vetting. She seems to have everything necessary to appeal to the conservative base, plus she is beautiful and has charisma. And can she ever speak? She dazzles the conventioneers and the campaign team when she steps out on stage and adlibs about a hockey mom being a pit bull only with lipstick.

The drama begins when the campaign manager Steve Schmidt, played by Woody Harrelson discovers that her knowledge of world affairs is less than he expected. Her answer to a question from him about relations with the British gives him concern. Harrelson's reaction is almost imperceptible. His eyes narrow slightly like the driver who notices the tiny crack in his windshield and wonders how soon it will take to spread across the rest of the glass. How far does her ignorance extend? When will the press find out?

The crack certainly widens as Sarah takes copious notes she cannot remember, like the squirrel that hides nuts but can't remember where he hid them. Her foreign policy education begins with information a first year history student would know. She begins to withdraw after being inundated with information and the absence of family. It explodes with the Couric interview and the recriminations against her and from her.

The script portrays John McCain as a man who refuses to take the low road of negative politics, a man who wanted a campaign he could be proud of. The high point of his character is shown again when he takes the microphone from a woman who refers to Obama as an Arab. His only concession to his team is to release the story of Bill Ayers, a former terrorist. This they hand off to Palin who asks the crowds, ""Who is Obama?"" The frenzied throng calls Obama a terrorist, a Muslim, and a foreigner. When McCain asks the same question, we see his facial expression tighten when he gets the same answer. It is clearly not what he wanted to appeal to in the crowd---the hate, the racism, the hostility.

As the campaign progresses Palin begin to insist on having things her own way and blame others for her shortcomings. Even the campaign manager finally tells McCain he can no longer control her, that she has gone rogue.

What this story revealed was how easy it is to stir a crowd to a frenzy of hate and hostility. Sarah Palin appealed to a crowd that included hate mongers. It reminded me that this country could and can turn the stars and stripes into the jackboot of the swastika, that the greatest threat to our democracy will be the cloaked in the flag of patriotic appeal, and Sarah had the appeal just as surely as Hitler did in Germany.

The performances of every actor were powerful. (Pay extra attention to the facial expressions). The screenplay and direction was equally top notch. The talents of all added to the drama and suspense even though we knew the outcome. This is high drama, even for politics.

I like Moore's portrayal, but the story is too one sided, slanted againt Palin obviously to be believable. It makes no attempt to round out her character and end up being a mediocre movie.

As far as Palin was in local politics, she got things done and was really involved in defeating corruption. She really cared about people. Do I think she was ready for the limelight or vice-presidency, no, but she is not a bad person. Under such pressure I'm sure many of us would crack as well, but still the movie obviously paints a one sided character, and if you can't see that, you really need to ask yourself what kind of a person get off on hating others so much.",1358035200,4,1162,4.350230414746544

If you are liberal then you'll find the movie does a great job of pointing out how terrible a person Sarah Palin was. If you're a conservative you'll find that the movie is little more than a hatchet job. But if you're like I feel most people are, sort of in the middle of those two camps, you'll see both aspects of that in this film.

GAME CHANGE is about the elections of 2008 when Barak Obama came out of nowhere and used the flames of popularity to win the White House. His campaign was well run and people seemed to adore him much to the consternation of competitor John McCain (Ed Harris) and his staff. The movie shows them discussing how to take on Obama and win votes away from him and that results in a choice that felt to many like it came out of nowhere, the choice of Sarah Palin (Julianne Moore).

But it wasn't out of nowhere. As the film shows it was a savvy move to attract voters who were viewing McCain as nothing more than the same old ancient white man who runs the country. Choosing Palin was a risky choice but it got the press and the public interested. Chief strategist Steve Schmidt (Woody Harrelson) is tremendously pleased with his choice once the numbers begin coming in and it looks as if McCain might actually have a chance to win.

Up to this point the movie seems pretty even handed and displays a side of both McCain and Palin that seem like normal people who have moved on to positions of power. Neither seems evil or out to do damage and both love their country and what to do what's right. That all changes as the movie then tries to show Palin as perhaps the most stupid person on the face of the Earth.

As the strategists try to prep her for interviews and to make speeches, Palin appears to know absolutely nothing. Their depiction of her almost nears the point of where you wonder if she has the ability to even know how to tie her own shoes. Not only that but the film shows the pressure of having to perform, having to suddenly be thrust before the intense scrutiny of the press and all without the election team having done the necessary background checks they were supposed to because they thought someone else had done it.

The change in the film also shows in how they felt voters changed as well. When Palin is first announced the crowds go wild and money begins coming in to help support McCain. When she fails at several interviews suddenly the film tries to lay the blame of the fall of McCain on Palin's shoulders. This seemed a bit odd to me since I recall that campaign and how crowds continued to flock to see Palin up till the last minute and continue to do so even today.

As the film progresses we see Sarah Palin changing from the soccer mom governor of Alaska to a power hungry witch who thinks she knows more than those trying to help her. I have little doubt that there is some truth in that because the saying that power corrupts. I also believe that the pressure must have been tremendous on Palin who was suddenly thrust into the spotlight. Anyone might think they are prepared for that but the intense scrutiny that the press brought down was unlike any seen in recent times.

So how is the movie? Interesting from start to finish. It does show a lot of what goes on behind the scenes during an election, perhaps not as well as THE WAR ROOM documentary about Bill Clinton's election, but it gives viewers a look at what happens when the doors are closed off to the press. The performances are what surprised me. Ed Harris does a fantastic job as McCain making him someone that maybe more people would have voted for if he'd come off this good. Harrelson also does a great job as a man who was to be the architect behind a successful for the Presidency who sees it all fall apart.

After all the acclaim and awards Moore won for her performance here I was stunned to see how weak it truly was. I felt more like I was watching Tina Fey do her impression of Palin than I was seeing an actor perform a role. She has the voice and look down but where was that side of Palin that we didn't see before cameras? According to this film and Moore's performance there was nothing the least bit sympathetic about Palin. She comes off as naive and then a total witch with nothing in between. She's portrayed as being so incredibly stupid as to not know the simplest of things taught in junior high civics classes. Having been the daughter of a teacher, a news anchor, a mayor and a governor, I found it incredibly disingenuous for her to be displayed this way. It felt more like a cheap shot than a does of reality.

As I said from the start, your own belief system will decide how you feel about this movie. If you love Palin you'll be angry and if you hate her you'll dance in the streets. I didn't go to either extreme. I just felt like a great topic for a movie was squandered that so much more could have been made of. Then again Hollywood seems determined to portray any conservative character as evil and bad so I shouldn't have been surprised. It would be nice to see an even handed portrayal of both liberals and conservatives show up but I won't hold my breath waiting.",1357776000,5,5249,4.331637843336725
5093758,5,B007KAUWO2,"First of all you must rememeber that this is a movie based on a book that was done with interviews
of the Campaign staff OFF the record. That is both good and bad. That allows you moments that you would not get, that would be lost to history. The downside is that those people are not quoted.
There is no accountability for their accounts.

The Movie is not the book; the book is much more  expansive, it covered BOTH campaigns for POTUS in 2008. The movie is a slice of the book that only dealt with McCain and his staffers on how Sarah Palin was selected. It was an incredible and insightful film. If you are a Republican or a Democrat, who is a political junkie it is a must for your collection, if you are an American who just votes and then goes back to his or her life than it is still entertaining.
As an Alaskan born and raised who thinks the real political hero in AK is two term Gov. Tony Knowles, it shows Palin at her best and worst.
She was chosen because she is an attractive, courageous populist, who is ambitious, talented, but who's knowledge of basic American history is worse than that of an 8th grader. It shows as we saw in the Curric and Charlie Gibson interviews in real life, that she was asleep in college classes. You don't have to know the major leaders of Pakistan, Irag, or Syria, to be a Gov. of Ak, as a person who could have been a heartbeat away from the leader of the free world you do.
If you hate Palin, than you will cheer this film, if you love her than you will feel the McCain staff did a hatchet job on her. It will not change your mind. IF you watch it with an open mind
however, you will learn so much more about her, McCain, and the way we elect our leaders.",1357603200,6,1702,4.154545454545454

5093760,5,B007KAUWO2,"This matches up with the content I read in Joe McGuinness's book about Sarah Palin relative to her education and knowledge about law, government, geography and other basics of what a well educated person should know.  I frankly would expect a high school graduate to know these basic things about our constitution and law. The film concentrates on her being given special classes on these subjects by persons brought in by McCain's strategists and advisors when they discovered to their horror these huge gaps in her knowledge.  She also had a lot of trouble being tutored in these subjects.  Actually, the people to blame are the campaign advisers.  They just assumed Palin knew the basics but were wholly concerned with how she would appear to voters on the ticket and did not do basic background checks on her. That someone was allowed to run as vice president for this country not knowing anything about the constitution, where countries are located, different systems of government, and so forth was absolutely horrifying.  Julianne Moore does a wonderful job portraying her, even rendering her somewhat symphatetic at times as no one ever asked her about these things before her asking her to run!

I know people in these campaigns are focused on the winning but one would think that with the military and nuclear capabilities that the President has that they would have been compelled for their own personal safety to ask some basic questions but no they did not.

A word about Ed Harris as McCain: He does an absolutely engaging job of McCain.  I can understand why McCain had his supporters since he is a guy who always wanted to do the right thing and especially serving his country whether as a soldier or as a figure in its government.  If he has a flaw, it is that he was too trusting of his advisers. He trusted them to do all the usual things with Palin that one does to be secure in a political campaign and they didn't do them.

This review has nothing to do with Palin's personality, family, her other qualities or her beliefs, just like the film was not concerned with those elements.

5093762,4,B007KAUWO2,"""Game Change"" is an insider look at the McCain '08 campaign mostly from the point of view of Ed Schmidt and (unsurprisingly) shows both him & McCain in a fairly positive light.  Sarah Palin does not fare so well, although she elicits sympathy in the early stages of the story when she seems overwhelmed by the criticism and mockery she has to endure.  Later on, when she gains her confidence and ""goes rogue"" to further her own career at the expense of McCain, she's portrayed in a much less positive light.

It's an entertaining and often very funny story, Moore is brilliant in her portrayal of Palin as an edgy awkward woman prone to sullen silence and broken jerky speech.

But the point most reviews seem stuck on is how accurate is it?  I don't think it really matters whether the facts are 100% true.  The Palin-isms in the movie are just a subset of those which are a matter of existing public record.  And the film isn't overtly critical of the GOP, or the tea party or any political movement.

What the film is critical of is the culture of entertainment and showmanship that has entered American politics and is endemic on both sides.  Forget your own political leanings and watch the film as a warning of what might happen if we continue to allow elections to be run like episodes of The X Factor.",1355011200,5,1309,4.512711864406779
5093763,3,B007KAUWO2,"""We need to create a dynamic moment in this campaign or we're dead."" During the historic election of 2008 John McCain was trailing Barack Obama and was in danger of falling farther behind. He was losing all demographics and with the Republican convention approaching he needed a shot of life to his campaign. He got it in his choice for running mate. Sarah Palin gave them the jolt they wanted, but this movie shows the cost of that bump. I am a huge political junkie and was looking forward to this movie. I will start by saying the the acting is incredible. Ed Harris looks and sounds like John McCain and Julianne Moore pulls off the impossible, she may be a better Palin then Tina Fey. The actual movie though is just OK to me. I liked it and could really go either way with Palin but it felt to me like almost one long attack on her. Could have just been me but the movie portrayed her as almost bi-polar and dumber then we think she is (which is hard to do). I recommend this and I did enjoy it but I'm interested to see how much of this is accurate and how much is ""doctored"" for dramatic license.

5093765,1,B007KAUWO2,"First let me say that I'm not a big Sarah Palin fan.  I think it's best that she is no longer in politics -- at least not as an elected official.  She was underqualified and unprepared and became a huge burden to an otherwise deserving candidate.  However, this portrayal of her is not accurate, at least not according to those who have spoken out about it.

Julianne Moore and Ed Harris are brilliant actors who do their craft proud in this movie.  The script is believable and the dialogue is good, which lends an air of credibility.  The film has a very high production value, as well.  All in all, the picture is well-done.  It's too bad all this talent is wasted on such an obviously politcally motivated production.

John McCain himself stated that the film is primarily fabrication with just a hint of truth to make appear to be the truth (a common tabloid tactic).  His family, and others, have made the talk show circuits, and they have all said that even the portrayal of John McCain, which is not directly depricating to the Senator, is not accurate, either.  This is similar to the HBO production Too Big to Fail, in which John McCain is portrayed screaming at the top of his lungs, shaking is fists over the bailouts.

The fact that HBO dusted it off to present it several times during the week prior to the most recent election should be a great indicator of the creators' motivations.",1354492800,20,1399,4.552
5093766,1,B007KAUWO2,"Sarah Palin has been one of the most attacked political figures in history. The left has promoted vicious, malicious lies about a wonderful woman, wife, mother, ex-news anchor, who ran her own business, was a successful mayor and governor before she ran with McCain for Vice President. The truth is that her experience in business and government leadership by far surpasses that of Barack Obama before he became President. His business and leadership experience is literally non-existent as we can see now with an economy in shambles and a disastrous foreign policy. Unfortunately the left who, by the way, claim to be the champions of women, circulated vicious lies about her and her family, ridiculed them, harassed her and her family, burned down her church, jammed up her schedule as governor with numerous, bogus trumped up lawsuits forcing her to resign as governor due to all the time wasted on these lawsuits and sent a liberal media journalist to move in next door to her house to find dirt on her. No dirt was ever found. On top of that Hollywood decided to make a movie portraying her in a negative light. Sounds like she must have been a huge threat to liberals as a young vibrant woman in politics! For this reason the left set out to destroy her with their out right blatant lies as they do in this movie.

Any minority who dares to run for office as a conservative is viciously attacked by the left despite the left's portrayal of itself as the champions of minorities. We saw this with Palin and Bachmann. We saw Herman Cain get railroaded with unsubstantiated accusations of infidelity. No proof was ever necessary. We saw the same happen with Clarence Thomas. We are also seeing this with US Rep. Army Col. Allen West. The left is more viciously racist than any conservative ever was if that minority happens to have conservative beliefs.

If the lies in this movie were of a liberal candidate, the left would have been up in arms with accusations of sex discrimination against the makers of the film. Just more proof that of leftist hypocrisy. If you take this movie seriously and factually, I'd like to sell you some ocean front real estate in Kansas.",1351814400,22,2171,4.725593667546174

Political science is just that.....a science in so many ways.  The acting is suburb, and the script never misses a beat.  I had to keep reminding myself that Sarah Palin herself wasn't onscreen.  Julianne Moore IS Sarah Palin in this movie, both physically and spiritually.  It's an astonishing performance.  I didn't think the movie unfairly criticized Palin.  In fact, it brought to light her likability as a person who can stay true to herself under extreme stress.  Although I don't share Palin's political views, I admire her, and I think she is politically relevant in the sense that she represents where she came from very well.  However, I also found the movie to be somewhat frightening.  Our political system can take an unprepared woman, squeeze her dry for calculated gain, and present her as a person who should be a heartbeat away from the presidency of the US.  I found myself literally getting CHILLS (the kind you get from FEAR) during parts of the movie because it was painfully evident that our political system is so deeply superficial.

5093772,5,B007KAUWO2,"This latest high-quality HBO film covers the 2008 Presidential election where Arizona Senator John McCain chose Alaska Governor Sarah Palin as his running mate. The film is based on a lengthier book entitled Game Change: Obama and the Clintons, McCain and Palin, and the Race of a Lifetime by John Heilemann and Mark Halperin, but this film focuses specifically on the McCain and Palin aspect of it, with the two being portrayed here by Ed Harris and Julianne Moore. Politics are a touchy subject, particularly in the current political climate and in reviewing Game Change I intend to limit my review to the film itself. My own political beliefs have no effect on the overall quality of the film and I don't follow politics religiously anyway. The familiarity I do have is not extensive enough to allow me to point out every fictional and factual scene in the film on a whim, but I guarantee this film will stir up controversy. McCain and Palin have already condemned it. While there's certainly material here to offend people, it's hard to argue what a well-acted and well-put together film this is.

The story starts in August of 2007 with John McCain enlisting Steve Schmidt (Woody Harrelson) to work on his campaign as the Senior Campaign Strategist. Moving ahead, McCain wins the Republican nomination and wants Joe Lieberman as his running mate. His campaign rejects this idea, noting Barack Obama's surging popularity and the need for McCain's campaign to find a ""game changer,"" someone who will appeal to both conservatives and women. The campaign thinks they've struck gold when they offer the job to Sarah Palin, who is officially selected as McCain's running mate after an extraordinarily brief vetting process. While her speech at the 2008 Republican National Convention is well-received, the campaign comes under attack. Palin's knowledge of foreign policy is nearly nonexistent and her knowledge of domestic policy doesn't fare much better. Her disastrous Katie Couric interview (which is covered in-depth) makes everyone involved think they may have been too hasty with their selection.  As Palin's following grows, she becomes increasingly harder to control...Ultimately, according to the film, losing the McCain campaign the election.

The impression the film gives about Palin is that she's a sympathetic simpleton who was exploited by her own party for political gain. Still, if I was her, I wouldn't want to watch this film. If you were conscious during the 2008 election, you probably saw many of the things portrayed here on the news; regardless, I'm sure there's some bias. It's hard to believe Palin could be this incompetent, but the film does portray her as a victim in a sympathetic light.  Whether you feel it's fair (Steve Schmidt claims it's truthful) or biased, it can't be argued that the film humanizes John McCain and Sarah Palin.

The performances will be a major point of discussion. Ed Harris has more of a supporting role as McCain, but he portrays him as a man of honor, principled and driven, with some good, admirable ideas of how to run his campaign. McCain is made likable and sympathetic. It's hard not to be fond of him once the film has ended. Harris' performance would not be nearly as effective without the work of the makeup artists involved. They did a stunning job making Harris look the part and it's easy to forget you're watching him.  Harrelson essentially plays the lead role, portraying the mounting frustration and stress of trying to keep the campaign afloat. The front-and-center performance comes from Julianne Moore as Sarah Palin, in a role that will probably win her an Emmy.

This performance is remarkable. Not only does Moore personify Palin physically, she captures the speech, the facial expressions; the whole essence. It's not a caricature or an impersonation, it's an embodiment. Even more remarkable is that it's so easy to let this performance fall into parody, but Moore has total control over the tone. She also succeeds in making Palin sympathetic, even while portraying her as a dedicated mother, stubborn, controlling, driven, and egomaniacal. Those who watch the film with an open mind will have a higher opinion of McCain than Palin, but it's still an enlightening glimpse of the woman.

Besides any perceived bias, there are some light jabs that will piss off Conservatives but this film should be embraced for how effectively and astonishingly it makes you empathize with McCain and Palin. This is especially odd when you consider the film is helmed by Jay Roach, director of Meet the Parents and the Austin Powers series. Tackling the complex personalities of the people involved draws you into the story and despite much of it being fresh in the American viewer's mind; it flies by in its suspenseful two-hour running time. Since the film is about recent events, it does incorporate bits of real life. There's some camera trickery that is sometimes too brave (it's clearly not Joe Biden standing across from Palin at the Vice Presidential debate), but for the most part it's fluid and effective.

With McCain's campaign a thing of the past, the film doesn't seem to make any political statement, although McCain's parting words to Palin certainly reflect the current state of affairs in the GOP. Game Change can't be strictly factual (no two-hour film could be really), but it is great, intellectually stimulating entertainment. It may even be inspiring enough to make you want to conduct your own research.",1343260800,7,5492,5.026373626373626

The book discusses all of the 2008 presidential players, so the movie was a bit of a surprise for me on that front.  That said, it was a riveting surprise - lol!  The story is told through the eyes of two former McCain campaign aides and the story they tell is one of negligence, confusion, unpreparedness and high stress as it pertains to how they picked, vetted, and ultimately threw under the bus former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin.  The movie is very good so I don't want to give too many details.  What I'll end with is that it made Sarah Palin appear human - not a ridiculous caricature of herself which is often how she comes across via the media.  Personally, I don't like or agree with her politics and believe that the McCain campaign should never have chosen her to be John McCain's vice president in the first place, BUT ... if HBO's Game Change is a true account of how John McCain's final presidential run imploded, I can honestly say that Sarah Palin was thrown into a pool of quicksand with no reasonable or easy way of getting out!

5093777,4,B007KAUWO2,"I should say, firstly, that how accurate are many of the details in this film, I do not know.

John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign was running into trouble. It was losing to Obama, a charismatic man, who was five times better funded. It needed to do something to turn it around.  So it decided to select a relatively unknown Alaskan  Governor Sarah Palin as McCain's running mate mainly, as she was new, a woman, exciting and had charisma. So the film begins.

She proved to be a mixed blessing because politicians need to know today, a lot of the trivia, and she did not, they need to know a lot of important stuff and much of it she did not know either.  She lacked a lot of experience too. She also had a mind of her own and did not take to well instructions. Furthermore, she went through big mood swings. Still I think the film went overboard about all of this as it is not like Obama had that much of all of this either as the film points out, and he beat Hillary, a woman who had it all.

I thought the film was well acted. I thought the characters were interesting, probably because in real life, they are interesting.

I thought it was nicely presented, and it certainly made me think.

It's worth seeing.",1338508800,2,1219,4.3392070484581495
5093778,4,B007KAUWO2,"Lots of well-quipped laughs.  Love Woody Harrelson.  Love Julianne Moore.  Love this satire!

Ed Harris (Man on a Ledge), as always, does a fine job playing a more-likable-than-reality John McCain running in the 2008 presidential election.  I'm not taking a jab at McCain so much as suggesting that the writers and director allowed Ed Harris to be as charismatic as Ed Harris, rather than the rash McCain who described Obama as ""a man who has no major life accomplishments...beating an American hero by double digits...simply sailing on his charisma and star power.""  McCain's campaign team is horrified that ""this guy [Obama] is raising money like he's some sort of a human ATM machine.""  The use of campaign stock footage presents Obama as exactly what we all saw during the campaign while meta-analyzing Harris as McCain.

HBO has a strong resume when it comes to non-theatrical films.  Cinema Verite (2011), depicting reality television before there was reality television, captivated viewers leaving them gasping over a time before Snooki and ""The Situation"" were poisoning television with alcoholic tendencies, recreational steroid abuse and Jersey-Italian grammar.  Recount (2008) managed to tickle both humorous and strong political senses.  I'm not suggesting that HBO's filmmakers didn't clearly have a biased (anti-Palin/McCain) agenda in this story, but they did an excellent job of pulling back the curtain and revealing the Great and powerful Oz; the demons mitigating the reality of how our political system functions and the campaign designs architected for their circumvention.  Such vexing reality is painted with lines like ""Lieberman is the right thing to do but the wrong way to win...none of these middle-aged white guys are game changers.""  The solution: ""So find me a woman.""  Perhaps aiming closer to satire than history, this is handled by a Google search complemented by viewing speeches on YouTube--as if the campaign team had no clue about any of these women.

Woody Harrelson, wandering somewhat askew of his normally beaten path of sarcastic and histrionic humor, does an exemplary job playing McCain's media-damage-controlling campaign manager, Steve Schmidt.  The humor is all in the situations and Woody delivers them with a straight face that keeps me smiling whenever he has screen time.  He always seems a bit nervous supporting the notion of Palin, a high-risk/high-reward nobody who is ""so outside the box that she'll help [McCain] recapture the Maverick label,"" all the while credibly serving as her Jedi Master offering guidance and tenets of political success.

As the moose-hunting, mother-of-five Sarah Palin, Julianne Moore amazes as usual.  While being admonished of the frequent, harsh, unfair examination her private life would undergo she simply smiles glibly, explaining that the Alaska primary was ""pretty rough, too.""  Her speeches' fur-ruffling feminism, considerate attention to small towns and special needs children, and family ideals are tinglingly uplifting--so much, in fact, that we momentarily forget where this movie will inevitably lead us.  A momentary interaction between Palin and a mother of a Down's syndrome child even broke me to tears; in the movie she practically had my vote (early in the movie, anyway).  She starts to win the campaign team's belief that they can actually win...all except for Nicole Wallace (Sarah Paulson), who quietly dreads that what Palin doesn't know will serve as rat poison to the campaign.

Not knowing why North Korea and South Korea are different countries or what the FED is, believing the Queen of England to be the head of British government, and that Saddam Hussein attacked the USA on 9/11--Palin requires high school-level history lessons and explanations of recent current events to stand her ground in interviews.  Deeper in the race the expressions of campaign personnel, once awestruck by the podium words of a strong woman, have been distorted to expressions of horror; horror of the child-like ignorance Palin has for even the most basic concepts of the government and history of American history.  Woody Harrelson is eating a grapefruit during a scene in which Palin is being prepped...I've never seen an actor make a grapefruit look so painful to eat.  These scenes are soul-crushing and it just gets worse as we approach Palin's breakdown.

I endorse this political satire very much and would like to close with a few not-yet-mentioned favorite quotes:

""It's not that she doesn't know the answer.  It's that she clearly doesn't understand the question.""

""She's a great actress, right?  Why don't we just give her some lines.""

Debacle after debacle... ""If John McCain wins, then this woman will be one 72-year old man's heartbeat away from being the president of the United States.""",1337644800,7,4801,5.276315789473684
5093779,3,B007KAUWO2,"More than anything, ""Game Change"" is a character study; the character in this case being Sarah Palin. The film portrays her as a complicated, powerful woman who was suddenly thrust into the international political spotlight, then forced to deal with all of the pressure, scrutiny, adoration, criticism, and condemnation that followed.

""Game Change"" will probably not please many people, at least from a political point of view. People who despise Sarah Palin will probably think the film is too sympathetic towards her, as she is portrayed as a devoted mother and wife, as a charismatic public figure with the ability to connect with people in a way that few politicians do, and as a person genuinely committed to her Christian faith. At the same time, those who love Sarah Palin will probably think the film portrays her too harshly, showing her as not terribly intelligent, combative, naive, and narcissistic. In a way, the film's greatest strength is also its weakness - it portrays a polarizing figure as a complex, real human being.

All character-driven films that succeed have to be cast with excellent actors, and Julianne Moore's exceptional, multi-faceted performance completely anchors the film. Moore's performance was especially critical in this case, because aside from her performance as Palin, there is not much else of interest. Woody Harrelson gives a strong supporting performance as Steve Schmidt, the advisor who first champions Palin as John McCain's running mate and then comes to regret it, but the character is never really fully fleshed out. And Ed Harris, a fine actor, is rather wasted playing John McCain. The character is portrayed as a benevolent, paternal figure, far from the volatile loose cannon he is rumored to be in real life. Palin's family are mostly relegated to being supportive and loving, and the drama of daughter Bristol's pregnancy is mostly glossed over.

Aside from being a character study, the film does succeed in making one strong, good point about modern politics: that today's politicians are required to be charismatic and telegenic; more like film stars than intelligent, thoughtful, experienced public servants. Palin was chosen mostly due to her attractiveness, charisma, and her gender (a calculated maneuver to lure female voters). And the film also suggests that President Obama was chosen by the American people for mostly the same reasons.",1336348800,53,2403,5.236363636363636
5093780,5,B007KAUWO2,"The book Game Change was essentially a gossipy look at the 2008 campaign. HBO wisely took the most compelling story - Sarah Palin's rise - and made it into a TV movie. The result is really compelling. From what I remember from the book, the movie is not blatantly inaccurate and some of the more shocking anecdotes about Palin are verbatim from the book. However, even more interesting is how the movie exposes Palin's flaws while making her a sympathetic character. We see her mean streak and frailties, her harsh treatment of aides and love for family. It's this dichotomy which makes the movie more than an attack or criticism on Palin and transforms it into an engaging character study. Julianne Moore did an amazing job as Palin. I also loved Woody Harrelson as Steve Schmidt, who also comes across well. Definitely recommended for political junkies.",1336262400,11,855,4.863013698630137

5093782,3,B007KAUWO2,"After reading the excellent book of the same name I had great hopes for a serialization.  My initial disappointment at the news that HBO would only be creating a 2 hour movie based around Sarah Palin (who only warranted - and received - a few pages in the book) was somewhat tempered by knowing the producers were behind ""Recount"" and the cast included Julianne Moore, Ed Harris and Woody Harrelson in the main roles.  Now I've finally seen it, my feelings are mixed.

I wish I could be more glowing about the acting.  Harrelson is almost one-dimensional as Schmidt.  In the circumstances, Schmidt would have remained professional but been a whole lot angrier and even shocked with Palin's lack of knowledge and having to focus so much energy on her presentation.  Harris's McCain was much too ""cool"" for a man who has a reputation for being alternately cold/stilted and hot-tempered.  Finally, although Moore captures some of Palin's essence - from her ability to connect to her audience to her notorious conniving, she wasn't as fluid or confident as Palin.  Where was the word salad - that refuge of unconnected words Palin finds time and time again when she speaks, or the bared-teeth snarkiness?  There were glimpses of the voice but not enough. Moore was trying so hard to perfect the accent she abandoned the character.

I will forego some details (makeup, wardrobe, music - all good) but focus on the ones that made headlines.  One was plot, and that was a weak point.  I very much doubt Sarah Palin calls her husband ""First Dude"" in bed or that she winks at people that regularly or peppers her speech with so many colloquialisms - surely a caricature?  I equally doubt McCain's campaign team spent their downtime exchanging Dick Cheney jokes.  I can't believe the whole room would erupt in applause because Palin pronounced Ahmadinejad's name correctly in a debate rehearsal, and key moments of the book - such as Joe Lieberman praying with Palin - were missing.  Indeed, perhaps the most embarrassing mistake Palin made was to accept a phonecall from the Canadian comic team the Masked Avengers - and flirt like a silly schoolgirl with an obviously fake Nicolas Sarkozy.  That incident above all others made Schmidt's blood boil.  And rather than McCain examining the political fall-out of inaction over the financial crisis, when he received a call from Hank Paulsen he - according to the book - handed the phone to Palin who - in typical fashion - chattered for ten minutes about unrelated nonsense.

The other key weakness was the transitioning between archive footage and Moore's Palin.  It was not seamless, and it could have been.  The movie had a big enough budget that the editing should have been perfect.

The nagging question for many is, ""What was the point of this?"".  To counter the finger-pointing (aimed at Schmidt and Nicole Wallace) in ""Going Rogue""?  We didn't need ""Game Change"" (the movie) to tell us that Sarah Palin was an irresponsible VP pick.  She proved it over and over again during the 2008 campaign.",1334361600,13,3040,4.846899224806202
5093783,3,B007KAUWO2,"Read the book & just saw the movie. I think Sarah's dynamic personality & gorgeous looks were not fully realized in the competent performance of Moore. I am NOT a Palin fan but SP certainly is anything but stupid! While being totally unqualified to run for the office of veep, blame the McCain committee for not putting Country First. SP brilliantly saw an opening for her star personality & the chance to make millions long after McCain would be forgotten. Palin came off as very devoted to her family (5 kids & lots of angst with some of them), & if she went into meltdown at times , who could blame her?
Recently she said (very quick on the uptake as always) that she would be ""very interested"" in having a daily show on OWN if Oprah's network is failing & ""maybe they need some conservative points of view"".
Dumb like a fox!
SP was chosen for being a woman but ALSO because she was absolutely opposed to abortion for any reason at all & being the mother of a disabled baby that she had at 44 & knew was going to be disabled while pregnant....that was THE consideration in her being chosen.

5093784,5,B007KAUWO2,"The presidential election cycle of 2008 was one of the most, if not the most, explosive of its kind in American history.  Eight years of a neo-conservative administration led by George W. Bush, along with two crippling faraway wars, Hurricane Katrina, and a world economy tottering on the brink of Armageddon, had led America to demand a big change in the way things were done in Washington.  It was the way that change was going to come about, though, that was the issue.  And once Barack Obama, the then-junior U.S. senator from Illinois, and an African-American, had won the Democratic Party's nomination for president, the Republican contender, Arizona senator John McCain, was caught flat-footed...until someone bought up the notion to put as his running mate a total unknown in Alaska governor Sarah Palin.  This was what was documented in the Mark Halperin/John Heilemann book ""Game Change"", which has now become a made-for-cable movie from HBO.

The book focused on the GOP side of the 2008 presidential ledger than the Democratic side (even though Obama had his moments against former First Lady Hillary Clinton during the Democratic primary), and thus the focus of the film is on McCain, well played by Ed Harris.  He is in a quandary as to how to preserve the ""maverick"" image he had built up for himself in the 22 years he had been representing Arizona in the Senate, while solidifying the ultra-conservative base of his party, which clearly doesn't relish the idea of change coming from an ""unknown"" like Obama.  After having considered several of the guys who challenged him in the GOP primaries, on the advice of his campaign advisor Steve Schmidt (Woody Harrelson), the choice is made for Palin (Julianne Moore), who at that time had barely any political experience, first being mayor of Wasilla, Alaska, and then having spent barely eighteen months as that state's governor.  Harris is somewhat dubious of Moore, until she shows fierceness to politics that rivals even his own.  But as the film, and the book it is based on, document, their pairing, while it does energize the 2008 campaign, also brings out some of the nastier aspects of rural and semi-rural America, and a whole lot of questions about Moore being properly prepared for the onslaught of questions being lobbed at her by the ""liberal media.""

While it may be easy for some to dismiss this as a slap against both McCain himself and the GOP in general by people who clearly lean leftward politically, GAME CHANGE works wonders because these left-leaning actors are able to get into the skin of those on the opposite side of the political aisle and see what those people see to give the whole thing clarity.  Harris, who portrayed Watergate conspirator Howard Hunt in NIXON and NASA flight director Gene Kranz in APOLLO 13, does a solid job of portraying the fiercely independent McCain, while Moore, who was in THE FUGITIVE and THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK, does a good turn as Palin, revealing not only the Alaska governor's seeming ""ditsiness"", but also her appeal to the ideologists on the extreme right fringe of the GOP.  Harrelson, who I thought was well overblown as a religious nut in 2009's ""2012"", is equally cagey as Schmidt, whose technical advice was well used by director Jay Roach and screenwriter Danny Strong in the making of the film.

Edited with a lot of TV footage from the various campaign stops that McCain made during the campaign, GAME CHANGE vividly depicts not only what the 2008 campaign looked like, but also gives us an idea of what future presidential campaigns will be, with the presence of cable news, Internet blogs, and, most especially, YouTube.  On a more disturbing level, however, it may also show just how much nastier these campaigns are going to get in the future, which makes it not only a compelling item to watch, but also one to be discussed intensely, which is the hallmark of great filmmaking, cable or otherwise.",1333497600,7,3944,4.87593423019432
5093785,4,B007KAUWO2,"I hope and pray that US presidential politics are not as depicted in the movie.

She was doing okay as the Alaska governor and then she gets thrown into the campaign and she becomes 'unstable'. Or she already was. What I realized after watching this film is that Palin WAS just like any other god loving woman in this country. They say that money or power can change a person. Maybe in this case, the power she gains shows who she truly is? Hmmm.",1332720000,8,665,4.123076923076923
5093787,5,B007KAUWO2,"GAME CHANGE is a surprise of a movie. Many viewers delayed watching it because either 1) they are committed Sarah Palin devotees or 2) they are embarrassed that she ever was up for Vice President of the United States.  So it is a surprise that the film seems to be more a biopic, showing all sides of the Alaskan Governor who could see Russia from her house. The film does indeed point out that she was an uninformed, not too bright, misplaced pawn put on the Republican ticket as a gimmick to win some attention away from Barack Obama -  and there she succeeded.  But this film tells us more about our broken electoral/campaign process than most of us realized. The fact that the film is adapted (by Danny Strong) from the journalists' Mark Halperin and John Heilemann book they wrote as insiders to the entire fiasco gives this tragically comedic tale veracity. Jay Roach manages the direction like a spy camera on the wall.

John McCain (Ed Harris) is the Republican candidate for President in 2008 and his platform lacks popular support: Barack Obama is clearly a celebrity frontrunner destined to win the election. It is the idea of political strategist Steve Schmidt (Woody Harrelson in a brilliant performance) to find something to garner public support - and he and his colleague Rick Davis (Peter McNichol) land with the idea of finding a woman candidate to pull the women's votes. They select Alaska Governor Sarah Palin (Julianne Moore in a bravura performance), do a very poor job of screening her qualifications, and suddenly Palin is the running mate; the crowds love her, she speaks to people in small places, and uses all her personal baggage to her advantage.  The problems begin when it becomes obvious that she lacks intelligence, is severely uninformed about foreign policy, the economic crisis, the Federal government, the various wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, and terrorism, and in general is a source of embarrassment whenever she opens her mouth in an interview or debate, despite the courageous attempts to coach her by correspondent Nicolle Wallace (Sarah Paulson) and Mark Wallace (Rick Livingston).  She takes notes on cards, trying to learn politics, but continues to make gross statements to the press and the public.  She begins to crumble, giving signs of mental illness, and cannot cope with the criticism and the absence of her family. Ultimately she is given a script to memorize in case she is asked any questions.  She seems to means well but she simply is unfit for office.  The film ends with McCain's defeat and Palin's fury that she can't make a concession speech!

The pacing of the action is brisk and the cast handles the delicacy of a biopic with sensitivity. Julianne Moore's sensitive portrayal never stoops to mock but simply shows all sides of the strange personality and mind of Sarah Palin. The film relives a fascinating moment in American history, one that hopefully will never be repeated.  Grady Harp, March 12",1332633600,12,2962,4.892215568862276
