8683891,3,B00OJA4GVG,"Having seen The Toy Shoppe in person years ago on Kenny Rogers' Christmas tour, I remembered it fondly and was excited to see it again.  I think this is probably one of those cases where my memories of the musical were better than the real thing.  It didn't help that the production quality of this DVD version was so poor.  It looks like this was just a recording taken with a consumer grade video camera or two, from just in front of the stage during a regular performance in Branson.  I'm sure being in the room watching that performance, it was probably quite enjoyable, but the compressed video, the stage lighting and shadows, and limited camera work, take a lot away from the experience when translated to video.  Also, no subtitles?  Again, a sign of low production values for the dvd. . .",1422489600,,797,4.538461538461538
