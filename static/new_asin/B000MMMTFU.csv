8170162,2,B000MMMTFU,"First of all, let's be frank. The chief selling point of this compilation is the inclusion of Rozz William's infamous ""Pig"" short film. The original home video release of the short film went out of print almost as soon as it was releasd, going for big bucks before it finally got re-issued recently on DVD. So for a lot of people, curious about the short, this DVD was a means to own the short without shelling out about $100 for the DVD.

Musician Rozz William's short, described as an ""exorcism of demons"" by those who knew him, is both haunting and homoerotic, with Rozz Williams as a faceless (often hooded or only seen via his hands by way of first person POV filming) figure who takes a hitchhiker (also hooded) to an abandoned building for fun. What follows is an extremely homoerotic and extreme BDSM-type series of events, between Williams and the hitchhiker, which is 100% real. Behind the scenes, the hitchhiker was a fan of Williams and his music and basically agreed to let Williams do whatever Williams wanted to him (including pierce him and take blood from him and squirt it all over him by way of a syringe). So basically what ensues is a rather graphic form of performance art, with said faceless fan serving as a willing participant for Rozz William's violent and sexually charged impulses.

The plot for the video is paper thin in terms of lack of motivation and the only ""dialogue"" is a segment where Williams and the Hitchhiker converse in sign language. There is implications that Williams's character is motivated by a book ""Why God Permits Evil"", a book filled with Nazi and anti-Christian imagery that his character is seen reading during the course of the film. The ending itself adds to the mindscrew, with the implication that the hitchhiker was just a figment of William's character's imagination, as if to say that he was imagining himself being tortured for whatever imaginary slights and sins he feels he may have committed.

As ""Pig"" is the main selling point, the rest of the videos are basically afterthoughts. ""Hollywood Babylon"" is a pathetic joke of a short films, an uber-short film that tries to trade off the name of the famous Kenneth Anger tell-all book. ""Le Poeme"" is a generic reading of a poem while film from an autopsy airs and it fails on all levels to be interesting. ""Adoration"" is the most straight-forward short (and the oldest, being made in 1987) while ""Dislandia"", is a surrealistic short about a mask wearing young girl that makes even less sense than ""Pig"" does.

Outside of ""Pig"" and maybe ""Dislandia"", the whole thing is a wash. If you don't have the cash to buy the original release of ""Pig"" or the recent ""Pig/1334"" combo pack, this is a decent alternative for you that won't break your bank.",1364428800,,2755,4.721413721413722
8170163,3,B000MMMTFU,"""Cinema of Death"" is a hard DVD to review.  A collection of five pieces of what could be called ""video art""; they are all black and white (except for the last one) surrealistic scenes involving disturbing imagery themed on death and pain.  The films are often intentionally grainy, often lacking anything like a story, and reminded me of a mix between the famous ""curse video"" from the film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ring/dp/B000088NQR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ring</a>&nbsp;and the original film in the Japanese&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Guinea-Pig/dp/B000679MJ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Guinea Pig</a>&nbsp;series.

I could not imagine watching these as straight films.  There might be people interested in doing this, but the lack of storytelling, the focus on blending imagery with sound, and the surrealistic savagery simply cannot hold my attention for the length of each piece, about 20 minutes, with some shorter and some longer.  What I did find is that they work perfectly as a sort of moving wallpaper, something to run in the background at a Goth/techno club or during a Halloween party.  The bizarre and disturbing nature, the lack of cohesive storyline, all provide an atmosphere that enhances another activity.  On that hand, ""Cinema of Death"" works very well, and it is from that viewpoint that I am reviewing the DVD.

""Adoration"" is the first piece, and is sort of a one-act play about famous Japanese cannibal Sagawa Issei who invited Dutch student Rene Hartevelt to his house for a literary conversation, then shot her in the neck and spent the next two days indulging in necrophilia and cannibalism with her corpse.

""Dislandia"" is a free-form surrealism piece involving a young girl, papier-mch masks and a variety of other disturbing imagery.  For some reason, this segment reminded me of the game&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lunch-Money/dp/B00064LY1Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lunch Money</a>.

""Pig"" shows&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Christian-Death/dp/B000006XL0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Christian Death</a>&nbsp;front man Rozz Williams in a wordless bondage and piercing show that is the most realistic, and thus the most difficult to watch.

""Hollywood Babylon"" is a grainy tour through the California Museum of Death, housing photos from Kenneth Anger's famous book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hollywood-Babylon/dp/0440153255/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hollywood Babylon</a>, including Marilyn Monroe's autopsy photograph.

""Le Poem"" reads Rimbaud's ""The Drunken Boat"" over the top of an actual autopsy.

As far as the DVD goes, there are some interesting special features where the various directors introduce their films, and what their intentions where while shooting.

People looking for a gore-fest aren't going to be too happy with ""Cinema of Death"", even with the very real ""human as meat"" scene from ""Le Poem"".  It is much more of an ""artistic"" style, although I use the term loosely.  I still think it makes a great background movie, and can wrench a few squirms out of party goers not expecting to see a penis piercing and a dead man's eyelids being cut off.",1221609600,3,3351,6.265795206971678
8170164,2,B000MMMTFU,"I AGREE WITH THE LAST REVIEW , I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED.ADORATION WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT I ENJOY.",1181865600,,95,4.333333333333333
8170165,2,B000MMMTFU,"I was interested in this primarily because I collect Cult Epics films and purchased it on blind hope that I would enjoy it. It consists of 5 short films: Adoration, Dislandia, Pig, Hollywood Babylon, and Le Poeme. It also has Director intros and 5 postcards with a still from each film. I have to say that I am overall disappointed with the collection. First off, Pig, this title had already been release by Cult Epics in a much nicer set with extras that are not included here. But the movie itself is great for Rozz Williams fans or people just into the student film, symbolic type cinema. Dislandia I hated, I don't know if I missed something but there just wasn't any art to it for me. Hollywood Babylon is a tribute, and consists of Nico B. panning a camera on some museum pictures. I don't know what I was supposed to see in that. Le Poeme was interesting, not much in the way of a movie, but more of an expression. Now as for the last, which they have on the disc as the first, Adoration. This one I loved, it was great as a short film, as an artistic piece, and in terms of cinematography. I recommend you save it for last. I won't go much into what each of the films is about because the only thing you might get out of most of these films is just seeing them without knowing what to expect.

So in short, I recommend this primarily to collectors due to its low production quantities and the fact that it's individually numbered. As far as people looking for artistic cinema or a gore fest as the title might suggest, I think you'd be dissapointed.",1178928000,4,1557,4.332191780821918
