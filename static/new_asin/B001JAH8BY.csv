8334401,4,B001JAH8BY,"This film contains a lot of satire and makes fun of sterotypes and bigotry. It is not making ""fun"" of Turkey or the Armenian Genocide. Instead it is using it as a comment on how American sitcoms will use a headline as a ploy for greater ratings. Think about most TV shows during ""sweeps week"" or when they have ""a very special episode"". If english and american culture are not your primary, this film may go over your head and just anger you, so beware or enjoy, whatever the case may be.",1282780800,,488,4.315217391304348
8334402,1,B001JAH8BY,"A truly awful short that trades in racist stereotypes, and ultimately makes its producers seem like bigger jackasses than the characters in the film. A ""comedy"" without comedy. Bigotry with a bow. Don't waste your time, or money.",1282003200,,229,5.052631578947368
8334403,1,B001JAH8BY,"This is no Borat, and at 7 minutes, it is no Saturday Night Live skit either. The elements that make off-beat, campy films great are missing here. Perhaps that is what it will become noted for. Hey, it worked for Ed Wood. Before writing this, I gave it another chance and watched it again on YouTube. Groan. It's no Ed Wood either. ""Kiss my kabob."" (As they say several times in Turkish Sitcom.) On the plus side, it gives one perspective, thus making it easier to identify the shorts that really are gems.",1279843200,,506,4.451612903225806
8334404,5,B001JAH8BY,"OK. You'll either get this film or you won't. Chances are if you were born before 1960 this will just seem like an odd little film that confuses you.

This film comes at you so fast that when you see it the first time you might laugh a few times but will probably just say, ""huh?"". But after you watch it the second and third time you'll get it, laugh at it, laugh with it, and enjoy it. Personally, I got the references the first time and was really amused.

As far as this DVD being a collectable item, that would depend if any of the actors or the director become famous. I did some research and one actor looks promising (Kahil Dotay) although it seems like the most press he received was for a film done in 2005. After that, it appears that he has just done co-star roles on TV. Collectable? Who knows? Worth watching? Yes!",1226620800,3,828,4.234177215189874
