Learned more about fats in these few minutes on the DVD than I could have in HOURS of research on a zillion websites and medical texts.  Thanks, Mary!  Nice work!",1437177600,,288,4.377358490566038
8148717,5,B000J20D88,"If it's a fatty food, then it must be harmful to your health, right? Isn't that what we've been told our entire lives from all those so-called health ""experts?"" Yep, it sure is-but what if they've all been completely wrong about fat? Well, Mary Toscano explains in this just over one-hour DVD that low-fat and fat-free eating is NOT the way to go if you are looking to lose weight and be healthy.

You NEED good healthy fats in your diet and Toscano walks you through the benefits of consuming foods with omega-3 fatty acids and even saturated fats like coconuts which are chock full of medium-chain triglycerides. Through the useful graph presentations and and cute pickin' and grinnin' original songs from the guitar-playing Dan Barnett, this DVD will arm you with the facts about fats that you'll never hear from the mainstream medical establishment.",1242950400,3,853,4.882758620689655

Mary was able to cover so much valuable information in such a short period of time and make it easy for the viewer to understand.  Thank you Mary I want to share this video with all my family and friends and finally eat my avocados in peace....,1210032000,2,527,4.147058823529412
8148719,5,B000J20D88,"Fabulous Fats is a wonderful educational video providing a basic overview of fats in the diet.  From watching the video, I gained a better understand of the different kinds of fats, their role in the body, and how to distinguish between ""good fats"" and ""bad fats.""  Mary Toscano conveys this information in an informative, yet playful and memorable way.  I highly recommend this video, as it provides important and easily understandable information on one very important aspect of improving diet and health.",1201392000,2,507,5.158536585365853
8148720,5,B000J20D88,"Mary has done it again! She takes the mystery out of complicated, long, hard to pronounce words and tells it like it is!  Her use of visual aids really helps one understand the role of fat in our diet and the songs help store the information in our brains.  I also recommend her other wonderful DVD on sugar, Sweet Fire.  You can't afford not to own these DVDs.",1175990400,,361,4.279411764705882
8148721,5,B000J20D88,"Fabulous Fats is a ""must see"" for any one who cares about their health or the health of their loved ones.

Mary presents the clear, understandable, and obvious facts in ""Fabulous Fats"".  Her simple yet informative style was interesting, and not at all condescending.  And after each section, the information is summed up in a song written and performed on guitar by a friend.  The songs are catchy and help drive home the information.  It really works well together.

After seeing ""Fabulous Fats"", it became clear to me that in an effort to follow the ""no fat"" trend, I was actually depriving my body of critical fats!

I had developed asthma 5 years ago, and that seemed to be at least partly due to my diet. I've had allergies all my life, and in an effort to be healthy and active I changed to a low fat, soy/wheat based diet. Then I moved to an area where new pollen and allergens triggered severe asthma attacks.  I added flax oil to my diet, several times a day, and in a matter of a few weeks my allergies were the best they have ever been, and while I used to need near toxic levels of hormones and inhalers to control my asmtha, now I haven't used them in almost a year now.  Also, a few patches of dry skin I've had for years are now gone!

Not only did I make good changes in my diet, I understand why they are important.  And this means that I actually am much more careful about what I eat, knowing the difference it made for me..",1159920000,,1443,4.287822878228782
