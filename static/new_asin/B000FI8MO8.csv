8122692,5,B000FI8MO8,"If you want conventionality, there are clearly plenty of choices but if you want something different - read the Amazon description - if it sounds intriguing to you ... this movie is great. It's wall to wall weird and kooky with wall to wall nudity of all kinds. The women are gorgeous - they are nude. There are lesbian make out sessions, there are fetishes, there is rope bondage and there are crimes committed by women and to women. It is what it is - it's doesn't try to soft pedal anything and the film-makers should be applauded for having a vision and sticking to it regardless of how unPC it might be in today's times. If you prefer your films more conventional, stick to Steven Segal - if you're intererested in the world wide spectrum of films - ones that edgy and not safe, then check this out and the whole series - they're all great.",1202083200,6,845,4.388535031847134
