5000238,5,B006JY3OCW,"What more can one say about Hercule Poirot?  As he states himself, he is the best and most famous detective in the world (circa 1930s).  Settings and character actors are outstanding.  David Suchet is inimitable.  I have grown fond of Detective Chief Inspector Japp, who appears in the early series.  Plot is always entertaining. My only complaint is that the British film makers need to improve their audio recordings.  Especially when there is a heavy accent and the microphone is not well placed, it is difficult to discern exactly what is being said.  This Series provides very good value.",1490486400,,593,4.929292929292929

We had purchased the episodes that were on A&E and there were a couple of them I recalled seeing on A&E.

I found these videos and the others I've bought very enjoyable, but I don't think Dame Agatha would! If you're a purist, you may  not appreciate these, but I did, once I got used to them, although some of them cross a line that I am sure Agatha would not approve of, and neither do I. I like Hugh Fraser as Hastings much better than the man who plays him in the videos with Peter Ustinov. I think he has class and is an excellent foil for Poirot. I miss him in the shows where he's absent.",1448064000,2,573,4.026315789473684

I can watch them all, put them away for a while, pull them out again and start over.  Just be careful when ordering any of the Poirot sets.  It's too easy to end up with the same movies under different jackets on the DVD's.",1372118400,,346,4.134328358208955

5000331,5,B006JY3OCW,Great Series - I Was disappointed in the Mix of Shows - I got this confused with the Classic Collection and some of those overlap on this DVD - I had previously purchase the Classic Collection 1 and 2 but still satifistifed with it after all ilt is David Suchet!

5000335,5,B006JY3OCW,Another beautifully directed and produced series of Poirot mysteries.  The production of this series is second to none and is such a wonderful change from so much of the rubbish produced today.,1357171200,,193,5.03125

5000341,5,B006JY3OCW,The blu ray makes it much better. For some reason the scenes in darkness have snow in them. Other than that great stuff.,1353542400,4,120,4.260869565217392
5000342,5,B006JY3OCW,This was an excellent quality DVD. There was no duplication on this series with the other episodes in the series.,1353542400,,113,4.7

5000344,4,B006JY3OCW,"I thought the Poirot Series 3 was fantastic, especially for the price. I never watched Poirot back when it was on television. I am fortunate to have the chance to get any of them on DVD. I was blown away when I received them in 4 days too!",1351036800,,239,4.0
5000345,5,B006JY3OCW,"Owners of the old DVDs of the shorter Poirot shows will know they got shortchanged on the video quality--those were terrible transfers to DVD. The new Blu Rays are entirely different and well worth the cost of reinvestment. Even though shot on Super 16 film, they look excellent--sharp, crisp, colorful, and so alive. You know how great the acting and design and scripts were, now you can really see it all clearly. Don't delay, order your Blu Ray copy today.",1350259200,,459,4.75
5000346,5,B006JY3OCW,Poirot is one of the greatest detectives (sorry Sherlock) in my opinion and David Suchet plays him perfectly.  I must say that I like the newer ones but that is just because they are longer.  This is a great set that every Poirot fan should have in their collection.,1346544000,,266,4.408163265306122
5000347,5,B006JY3OCW,"What a pleasure it was to receive Poirot, Series 3, from Amazon. We, almost immediately, viewed our new acquisition.  As always, David Suchet was the perfect Poirot, solving his cases with the use of his ""little grey cells"" and the assistance of Captain Hastings, Chief Inspector Japp and Miss Lemon.  We love the attention to detail and wonderful dialogue. It is such fun to try and solve the mystery with our own little grey cells before the ending of each episode. Please give it a try, you will have a great time!",1345593600,,517,4.608695652173913
5000348,5,B006JY3OCW,"Now that Acorn has included captioning, these are better than ever.  David Suchet is phenomenal as Poirot.  A must have for every video library if you like Agatha Christie and/or Poirot.",1344643200,,186,4.967741935483871

8499897,3,B006JY3OCW,"This ""remastered"" DVD set leaves a lot to be desired. The only thing that seems improved from the original DVD release is the colors, which are more vivid. It's not sharper; there's still a lot of fuzziness and the picture seems even less sharp in some places.

The worst, and most surprising thing about this DVD set is that at least one episode is actually slowed down. It becomes apparent when the theme music plays, and the actors voices seem deeper. This failing is repeated on all of the first 3 Series DVD sets.",1518393600,,518,4.51063829787234

8499900,1,B006JY3OCW,"Not sure what exactly to say because I had to stop the Dvd before the episodes began...which showed some VERY DISTURBING previews for other Dvd's.  All I will say is that from now on I'll have to try harder to make sure the Dvd is ""family friendly"".  None of these Dvd's are rated so I have to go by what reviewers say but I'm never purchasing anything by ""Acorn"" or ""BBC"" again.  They're just too ""iffy"".",1514851200,,405,4.302631578947368
