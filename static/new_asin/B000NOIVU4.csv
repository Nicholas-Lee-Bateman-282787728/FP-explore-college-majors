2773037,5,B000NOIVU4,"I recently became a fan of House throughout the course of the 3rd season, and needed to catch up. The two-season set of DVD's was perfect for me.

I'm so glad I ordered it to watch on DVD without all the sappy commercials and so that I could view the show in order. The episodes do stand alone but the story among the main characters is the best part and worth waiting to see when it comes out on DVD instead of upending your life to catch it on TV every week. Not being a TV person, it's impossible for me to find anything to compare it to. I'm sure anyone would enjoy it.",1245542400,,571,3.9310344827586206

I am thrilled to be able to see them without commercials and back to back.  It provides continuity and the episodes are pretty interesting.  This is just a great show.  Hugh Laurie is a real find and the rest of the cast is great too.  Just wonder if this man ever gets involved with anyone?  Guess not, like Captain Kirk, House is ultimately married to the ship.  Too bad.  Love to see some more action with House and someone else.",1238284800,,580,4.247706422018348

It was Dr. Gregory House that healed me from ATDS (Acute Television Distress Syndrome). Now I can finally watch a great show on t.v each week, and enjoy the dvd whenever I want. House is filled with great drama, humor, sex appeal and exciting hospital intrigue; with the most handsome and beautiful doctors that you'll ever see on television. Best wishes to Robert Sean Leonard, Lisa Edelstein, Jesse Spencer, Omar Epps, Jennifer Morrison, and of course the Dapper Doctor, Hugh Laurie, himself. The show is filled with amazing acting, intriguing stories, and mystified heart felt music. This is what tv should be! Don't miss an episode!",1228348800,,813,6.069565217391304

2773074,5,B000NOIVU4,"House M.D. - Seasons 1 & 2
House is the perfect show for everyone. Yes, I said it. Everyone. There is drama, gore, intensity, comedy, and romance. If you are not a fan of those, then you hate everything. If you are looking to get into House, I suggest picking up this set. If you do not even know what House is, then this is the review for you.

In my recent review of House M.D. - Season 2, I described the stories main drift as this:

""House is a painkiller-addicted doctor who walks with a limp due to a muscle being removed in his leg. He is the best doctor in the hospital, but is often apathetic and hates patients. The storyline of a common episode will depict House and his team trying to find out what is wrong with an abnormal patient. They will come up with a solution and find out it is wrong. Then they continue to find solutions until they find the right one. Along the way, there is plenty of gore and snide remarks on behalf of House. Almost every episode has this underlying pattern.""

House is developed in Season 1. Everything I described in the last quote is showed in Season 1. House's sense of humor will have you laughing, but will never ruin the moment. His attitude about his job makes him interesting. While he does not care about his patients, you find him eventually caring about things. It makes it seem like his heart is not as cold as originally thought. This makes him a dynamic character.

House has a team of doctors that help him solve these cases. Carmen, the over-caring woman. Foreman, the dynamic black man. Chase, the odd Aussie. Each one of them has a fair share of character build-up during Season 2. Foreman changes multiple times progressively making you care more about him.

Season 1 introduces you to House and develops his character. Season 2 develops his team's character. I prefer Season 2 for all the dynamic characters that are created. I gave both five stars though and they are both fantastic. The Season finales for both are fantastic. There are a few extras on each season that you might find interesting. The show itself is worth five stars alone without it. You will find this show to be completely captivating, and you will be craving more.",1222041600,3,2199,4.4875
2773075,5,B000NOIVU4,"I loved this program, lost time to watch the third season.  Will buy it eventually",1200528000,,82,4.466666666666667
2773076,5,B000NOIVU4,"I don't really get a chance to watch much episodic television (when the good stuff is on, I'm either already asleep or have gone out somewhere for the evening) - but being a fan of Hugh Laurie, I knew I would love House.  I finally had a chance to watch an episode - while recovering from the flu! - and it confirmed that I HAD to keep watching. I immediately bought all available box sets and set out to watch about three or four episodes a night.

Dr. Gregory House is brilliant and truly does not give a tinker's dam what people think. The things with which he gets away - what he says to his colleagues, patients, and superiors - are a vicarious treat.  Who wouldn't want to say a lot of what House acerbically delivers in each and every episode?!

What is so compelling about his character is his total unwillingness to bend, whether it is his methodologies or his opinions. Here is a character that - in any other situation - would be one that you KNOW would be set up to metamorphose in some way; perhaps the ""bully"" becomes a kinder, gentler person by episode's end.

Not the case with House.  He is everything contrary to what we perceive to be characteristic of a ""hero""; he's a bitter, Vicodin-addicted misanthrope, whose interest in his patients is solely for the medical puzzle they present. On the rare occasions that he appears to connect with a patient, it is always within HIS own parameters.

But you wouldn't want him to change. That's what keeps him strangely likeable and believable; he's a damaged person (his leg injury is really secondary) and is what he is, take it or leave it. He doesn't actually like many people at all - he won't even meet his own patients unless he absolutely HAS to; even though he's a genius diagnostician, he's horrible at relating to people.

We find ourselves alternately cheering his successful unorthodox actions or aghast at his crude insensitivity, and we keep watching!  The medical jargon, while complicated at times, never makes the audience feel left out; explanations are skillfully woven into the dialogue before you have a chance to scratch your head in confusion - and without slowing the pace.

This is a highly recommended medical drama with enough suspense and mystery to keep you involved. If you haven't seen the early seasons, you would be missing out on some intense character background and stories.

Differential diagnosis, people! Go!

It was only a three disk set with shows on both sides, and for some reason, my DVD player had a difficult time recognizing ""Side B"".  It kept telling me there was no playable disk in the player, so I had to keep trying over and over until finally it would play.

My wife & I managed to stumble on a few more shows during year 2, and got hooked solid during the 3rd season.  We are both huge Sherlock Holmes fans, and we could see the similiarities, but we did not realize they were so intentional until the address on the door ""B"" and front entry ""221"" were displayed in one of the final 3rd season shows.  (I did not realize they were also shown as ""221B"" during the 2nd season).  So House & Wilson are a reincarnated Holmes & Watson, the rest of the parallels you have to dig around for yourself (more fun) or look it up on the web.

We are watching these now as an addiction, every other night 2-3 shows at a time. We only have 8 shows of the 2nd season left to go, so we need to preorder season 3 soon.  The writing & directing are absolutely solid, on every episode; well, actually there was one episode at the beginning of season 2 that was ""off"" chemistry wise, but every other episode has been a gem, with fast paced intelligent dialog, wit, sarcasm and emotional tension, despite the techno-medical-speak.  I have not been this hooked on anything from television since...Star Trek?

Understand though, that these are not really medical stories, they are detective stories in a medical setting.  And everybody lies.",1183852800,26,1402,4.466666666666667
8179868,5,B000NOIVU4,"House Seasons One & Two

Gregory House MD is a modern version of Sherlock Holmes, a character who is shown to be most observant and knowledgeable than his co-workers. The camera is the Dr. Watson to record the events. The location is the Princeton Plainsboro Teaching Hospital in New Jersey. Everybody lies is his slogan. House acts and does what he wishes (as if he owned the business). Would his temper tantrums fly in the real world? Would his pill popping also be acceptable? Hollywood makes drama and entertainment, fictional reality. This show has a very high amount of drama and personal conflicts. Is that its attraction? There is a recurring plot. A patient arrives at a hospital. There are conflicts about the diagnosis. Finally Dr. House correctly diagnoses the problem and the cure.

Watching this show is not a substitute for seeing a doctor for any problem. The important lesson here is that a problem cannot be solved until it is correctly diagnosed. Think of that when you read opinions in the newspapers or hear opinions on the radio or television. Do they really know what they're talking about? Or are they just putting out lies or half-truths to promote an agenda that they are being paid to do? How many people die yearly from a mistake in their prescriptions? How many people die each year from a doctors mistake? [These figures are not readily available.] For comparison there are about 31,000 deaths each year in 1994 from firearms in this country (about 1 in 10,000). Before the 1968 Federal Gun Control Law this figure was about half. Motor vehicle deaths are much higher (there are more of them in use every day). The actual rate is more informative than a simple count. This show, like some foods, is best taken in small doses.

Season One has twenty-two episodes on three double-sided DVDs.
Disc 1 Side A and Side B have four episodes:
Pilot; Paternity; Occams Razor; Maternity.
Damned If You Do; The Socratic Method; Fidelity; Poison.
Disc 2 Side A and Side B have four episodes:
DNR; Histories; Detox; Sports Medicine.
Cursed; Control; Mob Rules; Heavy.
Disc 3 Side A has four episodes, Side B has two episodes:
Role Model; Babies & Bathwater; Kids; Love Hurts.
Three Stories; Honeymoon.

Season Two has six single-sided DVDs, each with four episodes.
Disc 1: Acceptance; Autopsy; Humpty Dumpty; TB or not TB.
Disc 2: Daddys Boy; Spin; Hunting; The Mistake.
Disc 3: Deception; Failure to Communicate; Need to Know; Distractions.
Disc 4: Skin Deep; Sex Kills; Clueless; Safe.
Disc 5: All In; Sleeping Dogs Lie; House vs. God; Euphoria - Part 1.

Bought this set to get a flavor of it (price too close to cost of season 1 alone not to buy set), and enjoyed so much House's approach that got the rest of the series on DVD.  House is a genius at diagnosing illness, but uses trial and error to narrow it down--tries treatments before testing in interest of time--doesn't value human relationships on the surface, but you can see that it is there for a select few.  He also opposes authority on principal--what is expediant and makes sense controls--and lives by the philosophy that everyone lies...including him!  ""Enjoyable"" humor when he confronts an ill patient, patient family member, etc who he thinks is lying. Very cleaver show--though last season (5) disappointing as seems to have lost focus on diagnosis and spending more time on ""human relations.""  The show's draw is its focus on the process of diagnosis and how humanity is interwoven in that, now (season 5 and 6) the writers have flipped that.  Less interesting, so makes this season 1 and 2 set more enjoyable to savor what was.",1260489600,,1347,4.800865800865801
