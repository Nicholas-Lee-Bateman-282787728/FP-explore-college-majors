8393562,1,B003BFCNJM,I wish that I could give negative Stars. This is a product that will only play on Region 2 players. It is in German. Maybe I'm a dummy and did not realize this but I do not think that it was very clear at all. And their customer service was horrible when I tried to return it. They were going to make me pay for shipping it back and charge me a fee filing fee. It might be a bit of a racket. Hope no one makes the same mistake that I did,1471737600,,437,3.7096774193548385
8393563,5,B003BFCNJM,This kitschy and dated retelling of Flash Gordon is a must for the cheap trashy sci fi buff. Don't miss this one,1455753600,,112,4.136363636363637
8393564,5,B003BFCNJM,this is a awesome movie. love this movie. this movie is a cult classic. the action is good the story is good and the music is good because it's by Queen and the acting is good. Flash Gordon is a football player who gets sent into space to save his world by a evil alien who wants to destroy the planet for the fun of it. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do,1449273600,,376,3.8333333333333335
