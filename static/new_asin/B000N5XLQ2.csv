8611181,5,B000N5XLQ2,DVD received in excellent condition and very informative.  Exactly what I wanted. Really getting into physics and it's products like this that really help a senior with very little formal education.,1316995200,,198,5.387096774193548
8611182,1,B000N5XLQ2,"I was not able to finish this movie, but I checked it out hoping to show it to my students. I would give it 5 stars if my goal was torture. I was pulling my hair out after only a few minutes. The basic idea is to Bohr you to death with monotone talking and low grade animation. It starts with the history of the atom by showing Greek statues and putting you into a mind melting coma. I would like the 20 minutes of my life back that this movie stole from me. If you don't believe me buy the used one for 57 dollars instead of the new one for 21, that will make you feel better once you watch it.",1251072000,3,595,3.845528455284553
