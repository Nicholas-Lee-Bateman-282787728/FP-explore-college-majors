The colors pop like tropical feathers, the characters' faces are illuminated by the camera like portraits. I saw this on the ""big screen"" when it first made the art cinema circuit. I was captivated. I have been trying to own a copy ever since. Now I have to decide if I can afford to spend this kind of money on a VHS, know what I mean?

Anyway, I dare you to watch this movie without being transported by the glorious melange of sets, performances, costumes, the portuguese language, and the unbelievably engaging indigenous dance and music that majically filter through Hollywood conventions withough losing their authenticity.
