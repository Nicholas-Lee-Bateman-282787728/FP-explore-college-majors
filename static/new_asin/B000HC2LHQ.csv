2632963,5,B000HC2LHQ,"It wouuld be difficult for me to truly describe the wonderful shock that is The West Wing's final season.  I, like so many, had given up on The West Wing when Aaron Sorkin left, wished the show cancelled during its atrocious 5th season, and, honestly, found the show an irritating fantasy during the Sorkin-helmed 4th season anyway.  Something astonishing happens during ""The Ticket,"" the season's first episode - you feel, in its incredible pacing, structure, and emotional understatement - that Aaron Sorkin has not only returned but has regained all of his abilities as a writer.  That he is not at all involved with the show means that writers like Eli Attie and Deborah Cahn have finally gotten their work as writers to both revive the lightning-quick trademarks of The West Wing while also justifying the often-unswallowable plot maneuvers of its previous two seasons.  It occurred to me during ""Message of the Week,"" a nimble and thrilling episode, that campaign-trail politics had never been so accurately represented, if they'd truly ever been attempted at all.  That means The West Wing had found a reason to exist again, and that sense invigorated all the stories it surrounded - the White House's ""leak"" story, or the regional conflict between Kazhakstan and China.  And, in a winning surprise, it also revived its still extraordinary cast - Bradley Whitford especially turns the stress of campaigning into a frayed study of stress and exhaustion, and with Janeane Garofalo at his side, he finds a sparring partner of incredible energy.  The two's chemistry makes the workplace seem as vital a beast as this White House ever seemed in its prime.",1155340800,159,1657,5.025547445255475

2633084,5,B000HC2LHQ,West Wing is a really great movie series! I'm sure the stuff you see in this is very similar to what actually used to happen back then on the hill. I think it's gotten even more smarmy these days on the hill than in those days. But it's a lot of fun to see the kind of battling politicians do between themselves to get the things done that they want to get done. If you like political comedy-drama this is the one for you!

I thought the pre-election part was boring and I cared little for the importance they gave C.J.'s role as Chief of Staff.

2633203,4,B000HC2LHQ,"Great series, although the first 4 seasons were better than the last 3.  The scripts were much weaker after Aaron Sorkin left the series.  Characters were forever acting contrary to their previous stances to create a false sense of tension.  Still, it was fun to see and head and shoulders above most of television shows offered today.  Alan Alda and Jimmy Smits were welcome additions to the series' last years.

2633405,4,B000HC2LHQ,"I had a real love/hate relationship with the 7th (and 6th) season of The West Wing.

What I hated:
I thought they destroyed the character of CJ and way too much air time for Will and Kate (Josh Malina and Mary McCormack), two characters that I never liked. I would have preferred that the campaign be the main focus and not just every other episode.  I know that they did it to save money on salaries but it resulted in me pretty much only watching the weeks that were centered on the campaign. I'm pretty sure I wasn't the only one skipping the been-there-seen-that West Wing, that had only CJ and POTUS as characters I cared about and by the end, didn't really give a hoot about CJ.

What I did love:
The Campaign!  I liked how they presented both sides while still making it a show about Santos' campaign.  I thought Senator Arnold Vinick (wonderfully portrayed by Alan Alda) was a worthy opponent.  He really seemed to be a good man, just not the man I was rooting for to become the next president. Patricia Richardson (Sheila Brooks) showed a different light on her acting skills by showing us a smart, savvy and compassionate aid to the Senator.

Senator Matt Santos Campaign - Love love Jimmy Smits in this role and Teri Polo did a flawless job portraying Helen Santos, wife of the candidate, supporting her man even though she wasn't thrilled about how the campaign and the ending results of the campaign could and would affect her family.  I think Senator Santos was everything we want in a politician, smart, fair, wants to do the right thing and make a difference while keeping his fellow Americans safe, healthy and educated.  It's television, I know we don't get that in real life which I think may be why I loved Santos all that much more.  He was the ideal for me, not reality.  It's television, not real life.  His character is allowed to be ideal.

Josh Lyman - Bradley Whitford, this is by far his greatest role and he eats up every scene.  From high energy and exceitement, to the depths of despair of great loss, from manic to calm, from rejection to love.  I loved going through this campaign with Josh Lyman, Donna Moss, Lou Thorton, Annabeth Schott, Leo McGarry and the rest of the Santos crew. I learned a lot and was entertained a lot.

I think the campaign episodes of this season are great, the WH scenes left a lot to be desired.  But overall, despite it's problems, the good parts make it a solid 4 stars for me and it was still better than most shows at that time, and still a lot of fun to watch all over again.",1382918400,,2542,4.432258064516129

2633459,5,B000HC2LHQ,"Without a doubt in my mind, this was the finest television show of it's kind.  Aaron Sorkin is an intelligent and articulate writer.  The characters are compelling and the story itself so 'nail on the head ' for the American political condition, that you will be unwilling to stop watching.
Taken from the headlines of the times, the episodes made you laugh, cry, clench your fists and above all : think.
My favorite show off all time.",1375056000,,435,4.636363636363637

2633467,5,B000HC2LHQ,"The Debate was (for me) one of this series better shows, because it was just like the real debates.  The time it took to write the debate, gage reaction, and say almost nothing for an hour is truly our political system.
They argued about everything, made no definitive decision about anything while asking you to trust them.  The acting was great!!!
Who won the debate? --Lets see one candidate said I am going to do something but I need more money.  The other candidate said I am not going to do anything so I am going to give some of the money back.  Both tried to stay true to their narrow minded parties, but found it difficult because their parties were too constricting.

Neither candidate could say what they were going to do, because they never read the executive powers of the United States??, but they both knew everything else about government, like what type of joke Abraham Lincoln told before he was shot.

Hire me, to be your CEO of your electric company, I know how the light switch works but I don't know anything about electricity- Trust Me.

My favorite part was CAFTA only works if the government is going to physically protect American jobs, which they said they would but didn't.  oops!!

I still have 3 episodes to go, and I'm trying not to obsess over how much I am dreading reaching the end of this amazing series.

Of course, it portrays a democratic administration and that fact alone is enough to provoke the hatred of some of our current political extremists. Consultations on activities inside the White House provided by Dee Dee Myers and Peggy Noonan add to the authenticity. There is so much quick and pointed dialog that we expect to watch it again in the near future, just to see what we missed first time around. Perhaps not for the politically uninclined or those not interested in how the government works. Otherwise, a superb series.",1371945600,,623,4.777777777777778

There is no closed captioning (subtitles in English), unlike the DVD's for the first five seasons.  I would guess that I could not understand as much as 25 pct of the spoken words, because of this.  There are many places where characters speak quickly, or several people talk at the same time.  The producers should have had better judgment, and more respect for the viewer.

Although the last 2 seasons shift away from the White House and to the Presidential race, the writing is still smart and riveting.  I do miss seeing President Bartlett as much and the story line for Toby could have been handled better as well as other obvious contrived love encounters.

In particular, I loved where my favorites ended up: Donna, Joshua--who wasn't always a favorite--C.J., Danny, and of course brilliant, difficult Toby. It was hard losing Leo, but there's not much you can do about it when a great actor dies other than write it into the storyline. I also loved the plot line about Vinick. Alan Alda did such a great job, and it was hilarious watching him realize that Santos really, truly, honestly did want him to serve in an important capacity.

It took a couple of years for what was previously a close-knit group of actors to be themselves again as their original TV personas. However, I think that this last season brought the series back up to the quality level of seasons 1-4. I particularly liked that in the end every loose end was tied up, every cast member was given a positive future, and long-requited loves were finally united. Most touching was the eulogy for John Spencer, the actor who played Leo McGarry, and who died tragically just weeks before the filming of the final episodes.",1365724800,,672,4.65546218487395

The overall story arc and the acting of both Jimmy Smits and Alan Alda are fantastic. Both of their characters are likable, interesting, and their race to the presidency is even balanced. I still felt this season fell a bit short on writing though. Some of the story lines were superficial, underdeveloped, or just unbelievable. So while I felt the season was good, there were definitely parts where I felt like I was being fed mediocre chow waiting for the main course. I have the same feelings about season 6.

I do wish the show had continued with the Santos' administration. With Josh, Sam and Donna still with the show and others from the original series making guest appearances, it might have had great ratings. Too bad they didn't at least try it. Maybe all those who love The West Wing as much as I should put together a petition and send it to NBC. Tell them we want The West Wing back. Get Sorkin back at his keyboard and do eight more years.

2633656,4,B000HC2LHQ,"And so, we have reached the end of the Bartlett Administration saga and the end of The West Wing. Season Seven has us following the presidential campaign and the last year of president Bartlett in the White House. This seems to have upped it's game since the last series and although it still lacks the spark of earlier series, it still offers up political intrigue and drama in spades. This series has a live broadcast episode, which happens to be the Presidential debate and it makes for gripping viewing. You almost feel as if it is real and the live element adds to the tension and power of this particular episode. There is also an episode written by Bradley Whitford, who is the actor who plays Josh, and this is pretty good. This series looks at the aforementioned presidential campaign, as well as the genocide in Sudan, a oil conflict in Kazakhstan, a nuclear power plant crisis in America, a top security leak at the White House and the transition from one administration to the next and the resolution to this long running political series. Sadly John Spencer died during the filming of this series and he is honoured here by Martin Sheen The scriptwriters also managed to write this into the story with sensitivity, whilst being credible to the series, in fact Leo McGarry`s funeral is used as an end of season roll call of all the previous actors who have been in the series` and is a nice way to revisit past characters. This manages to tie things up neatly and still leaves things feeling fresh and full of hope. It is emotional, but not over sentimental and you will finish the series with a sense of satisfaction and a tinge of sadness at it's ending. This is an exceptional political drama and lived up to it's high standards right to the end.

2633657,5,B000HC2LHQ,"I mean, nowadays you're supposed to be a cynic. You're supposed to prefer entertainment that is cynical. Or you're going to have people in your face, forcing you to do penance for ""questionable tastes"". And they won't let up on you until they've made you crawl; ""You like THAT $#@&? What's WRONG with you?"" One friend of mine told me; ""That show should have aired on the Hallmark Network with all the other goody-goody #$%@"", which as a critique was a bit better than usual. But this series depicted a Democratic President who wasn't really one of those lefties who loves criminals and America's enemies--he served real, decent Americans. Kind of an avuncular version of Bill Clinton, who I voted for both times, even though the second time through I'd switched to the Republican party. We got to see the absolutely right man to play Jed Bartlet in Martin Sheen. We got to see Alan Alda play a serious role. We even got to see John Goodman play a straight role, when he didn't have Alda's advantage of normally playing witty roles. Goodman is ""slob comedy"" in the true Steve Martin/ Jim Carrey tradition, but he nailed it. And we got to see a developing romance between Josh and Donna, two nice types who any lover would not hesitate to take home to meet Mama. I mean, usually TV or movie romances have ""moved on"" from the Cary Grant/ Deborah Kerr mold to a more ""sophisticated"" (which is to say ""slightly tawdry, tempered by a bit of class"") model. Josh and Donna were a what-if: what if soaps had good people rather than the decadent mean-sprited dreamboats they have now. I mean, when those two were on, the President Of the United States played a supporting role. I rooted for them week after week, and when Donna landed the job working for the new First Lady, taking her out of Josh's chain of command, legitimizing their romance, I went; ""YESSS!!"" like I'd been watching a sports event and there had just been a dazzling play. And dirty politics. There have always been dirty politics. Aaron Sorkin didn't build a never never land of naive decency--the dirty politics were there but they didn't rule Washington the way all the haters on the internet posts would have you believe. The fact that this series won all those Emmys is one of my best pieces of prima facie evidence that America isn't gone yet.",1291852800,,2309,4.62043795620438
2633658,4,B000HC2LHQ,"The West Wing is one of the greatest dramas in television history and the content is five-star all the way. However, I'm giving this DVD box set four stars for a couple of reasons.

One reason is the lack of English subtitles. I like and expect subtitles and I'm not even hearing-impaired, so I can only imagine the frustration this issue causes for those who are hard of hearing. I'll never understand why a show is closed captioned for broadcast but then doesn't include subtitles on its DVD release. The cost of adding subtitles would seem to be negligible, so omitting them always frustrates me.

The special features on this set are sparse, but my single biggest complaint is that it only includes the West Coast version of the live debate episode (two live versions were produced, one for East Coast viewers and one for West Coast viewers).

I'm a bit of a television purist in that I want to own the definitive archival version of what was originally aired, so it would've been really nice to have both versions of the live episode.

2633663,4,B000HC2LHQ,"Okay, so it's the last season of the show.  So that means they have to bow out gracefully and wrap everything up.  With six years before this, there's a lot to do.  The seventh season is not the best, but it's well-done and it does  end the series well.  Most of the season is dominated by the election of the next President.  Matthew Santos (Jimmy Smitts) vs. Arnold Vinick (Alan Alda) is an engaging plot arc.  Neither candidate is a clear moral victor, although the way the show is written, we're clearly meant to be in Santos' camp.  Let's put it this way: just about everyone's story ends more or less the way you expect it to - not that that's a bad thing.  Almost anyone who has ever been on the show gets at least a cameo.  About the only low point of the season is the live Presidential candidate debate.  It was probably more interesting when it aired originally, but on DVD it's a little slow, especially compared to the fast-paced, tight dialog of the rest of the show.  It just feels out of place spending so much time in one setting when the show usually jumps around quite a bit.

2633676,2,B000HC2LHQ,"It's hard to say much about what makes this final season so lackluster without spoilers. But it's clear that good characters created by incredible actors cannot overcome bad dialogue. The first four seasons written by Aaron Sorkin gave us extraordinary character development: it's the reason so many reviewers praise The West Wing as the best TV drama ever. Bad writing always reduces everything to plot. Of course plot is important, it's what moves the story along. But great writers know how to move story through character development not just the events themselves.

What makes the writing in the last three seasons (five, six and seven) so disappointing is that the characters' core values change. Not because the characters change these values themselves but because the writers who took over from Sorkin at the end of season four fail to understand that people cannot change their core cultural and family values the way they change their clothes.

Martin Sheen says and does things in the later seasons that his character, President Bartlett, would never say or do. Likewise Janel Moloney...her character's values, especially in the last two seasons, are particularly mismatched with everything we know and love about Donatella Moss. The characters of Alan Alda and Jimmy Smits (both great actors) also suffer at the hands of bad dialogue and thin story line.

Unfortunately, the bad writing, weak plot lines, and incredulous character motives don't apply only to the characters I've mentioned. I loved the first four seasons so much, I felt disappointed for the actors and all the fabulous characters they had created for this great show to play out so badly at the end.",1231718400,6,1679,5.098181818181819

2633679,5,B000HC2LHQ,"Watching The West Wing always gave me the sense that, flawed as our leaders may be, they have the country's best interest at heart, and they work incredibly hard. Everything we always loved about this series is there in the last season: the scripts, the cast, the acting. If the early seasons seemed to describe the Clinton Administration, the last season, almost eerily, presaged the presidential election of 2008. There's the little-known,  minority Democratic senator (Jimmy Smits), young and handsome,  campaigning against the Republican veteran (Alan Alda), decent but ruthless, who's too liberal for some in his party. Santos (Smits) chooses a seasoned politician for a running mate; Vinick (Alda) chooses a running mate from the evangelical right. To add to the sense of immediacy, there's even a debate between Alda and Smits that was filmed live. Aside from Smits and Alda, the cast is stunning: Kristin Cheoweth, Stockard Channing, Janeane Garafalo, Ron Silver, Marlee Matlin, Patricia Richardson, Lily Tomlin, Allison Janney, Richard Schiff, Bradley Whitford, and Martin Sheen. And, of course, the wonderful actor John Spencer, who unexpectedly died before the season was over. The way his real death was acknowledged in terms of his character remains incredibly moving. Finally, there's the the outstanding writing that creates suspense without violence and gives the feel of being inside the White House, the campaign plane, and the hotel rooms where decisions are made.",1230336000,,1483,5.387931034482759

I hated the much-hyped debate episode, and found the two candidates to leave a lot to be desired.

However, I will say that the convention episode is one of the greatest from the entire series.  It literally saved this season for me, and finished off the series strong.  If you are a big West Wing fan, you need to watch it, just know that you may be a little disappointed.

2633707,5,B000HC2LHQ,"The creators of this show decided to end the series with a thunder, and therefore delivered a season that has it all. There are clear parallelisms between some of the situation seen in the show and those faced by the current administration, and the criticism could not be clearer. There are many comments regarding ""Stay the course"", and even though it is based on a different environment, the message comes through loud and clear, and with a good level of sarcasm. Also, talking about the inexistence of an exit strategy for a war that the US may march into should ring some bells.

We are used from previous seasons to see a team in the White House that is trying to govern in an ethical way, but instead of facing an ""ideal situation"" to do so, has to compromise and do things little by little. This is still true, but the main focus of this season is on the race for the presidency between Matt Santos and Arnold Vinick. This makes for some exciting episodes and the fact that Vinick is not a typical Republican leads to some very interesting situations. I bet many people wish that the debates we get to see in real life were as good and revealing as the one we witness during this season.

Then there is the romance. If you are one of those that during the previous seasons was always waiting for relationships to develop between some of the characters, and saw that it was not happening, you will now have your redemption. I understand why the writers crafted it this way, since too much romance in the past would have take focus away from the main issues, but now they really went all out and made good in their unpaid debts.

The usual cast does an outstanding job, but Jimmy Smits and Alan Alda are so amazingly good in their roles that they place themselves a step above the rest. It will be hard to see these actors in other roles in the future without thinking of them as the president candidates Santos and Vinick. I also liked the idea of bringing in Janeane Garofalo, an actress that is known for her strong political activism and that plays the role displaying that passion.

Of course, I cannot write a review about this series without mentioning John Spencer and his untimely death. This actor was the heart and soul of the show and the fact that he played a character that shares many characteristics with his real persona is not a minor detail. The episode ""Requiem"" is one in which you can feel that some of the members are not acting at all, but showing their true emotions and appreciation for Spencer instead. The creators of the series did a good job in modifying the script to deal with the unexpected event, and should be praised for this.

The quality and success of this show through its seven years has set the bar extremely high for any future political series. And the reasons behind this are clear as water. I hope someone in the future can come even close to this altitude, but I am not holding my breath, since the odds of that happening are not too good!",1195344000,,2991,4.470695970695971

The guest stars of the previous six years make one last curtain call (particularly in the excellent and emotional ""Requiem"").  The final few episodes really drive in the feeling of mortality and the fleeting nature of time.  All good things...

The DVD set, however, leaves much to be desired.  There are some artifacts visible on HD sets, and for whatever reason, the producers decided to stop including closed captioning with the fifth season (perhaps the most annoying omission).  The special features, again unlike the early seasons, are sparse and less than compelling.  As a DVD set, it is highly disappointing.

I'm sure the writers did their homework.",1188432000,,409,4.1
2633714,4,B000HC2LHQ,"The long denouement of the West Wing, which essentially started with creator Sorkin's departure at the end of Season 4, wraps up with this 7th season.  We have an election, a transfer of power to the new administration, and the departure of many of our beloved characters from the White House for the last time.  Along the way we have some nifty inside looks at what it's like to run a campaign and a country - this is, after all, what the West Wing does best.  If the stories aren't as compelling as they were in earlier years, and if some soap opera aspects creep into the show, we can forgive it because this show is still better written than any other on TV.

The show is at its best when focussing on the lower-level characters.  That's not to say the bigwigs aren't well played - Jimmy Smits is just as good here as he was as a NYC cop on ""Law and Order"", and Alan Alda has never been better.  But we see the faces, debates, and interactions of the bigwigs in real life.  What we don't see are the spin-doctors, the lawyers, and the junior staffers behind the policies and the talking heads.  Originally, Sorkin's vision was to focus solely on the likes of Josh, Sam, Donna, etc., and the best shows of the season are when these characters come to the fore and we learn about the inside workings of a national campaign.  Of vital importance are the two spin-doctors, Republican Bruno and Democrat Louise, and pollster Joey Lucas.  These are the people we don't see in every episode, but they are also the guts of these campaigns, and it's fascinating to watch them work.

So the individual shows work, but what about the season as a whole?  As mentioned, there is an unfortunate tendency in some episodes to senitmentality, and no fewer than 5 of the 11 title characters who were previously single end up in relationships by the end of the season (I think this is more than the rest of the series combined, which had 3 notable realtionships involving main characters: Josh/Amy, Sam/Mallory, and Charlie/Zoey).  This is somewhat counteracted by the reappearance (especially in the John Spencer/Leo McGarry funeral) of many forgotten characters: Mallory, all three Bartlet daughters, Sam, Joey Lucas, Special Agent Butterfield, Danny Concannon, Amy, Bruno, and even Emily Procter returns from CSI:Miami to reprise her role as Ainsley in one episode.

What about the season as an extended finale for the series as a whole?  I would have liked to have seen more of the original main characters - especially the non-title screen characters like Ginger, Ed and Larry, Nancy McNally, and Debbie, played by the always entertaining Lily Tomlin.  I do like the new characters though: Louise, played by Janeane Garofalo, and Sheila, played by ""Home Improvement""'s Patricia Richardson, are stellar additions, as are most of the lesser new characters in the two campaigns.  Even Harper, my least favourite title character, started to grow on me as the season wore on.

Overall: a very strong season.  There are no shows on the level of ""The Supremes"", ""Posse Comitatus"", or ""In the Shadow of Two Gunmen"" but the episodes are mostly strong and it's certainly a better season overall than either 5 or 6.",1184976000,,3194,4.743218806509946

As the seasons were sold in DVD, I bought each one.  I have found that the shows I love are always cancelled.  I am glad this one got to run 7 seasons, but would have preferred that it continue.  By buying this product, I can ensure that it carries on in THIS home anyway.  I liked the interactions of the characters, the realistic conflict, the intelligent dialogue.  I basically hate politics (and most politicians) in the real world, but WEST WING made the incomprehensible entertaining at the least and at its best, made motivations more empathetic.  The features and interviews were well worth watching.  I admit, I have not watched the final episode yet.  (Postponing the inevitable.)",1173312000,,842,4.751724137931035

2633772,4,B000HC2LHQ,"The final and last season of West Wing.

The last season takes the focal point away from the White House, focusing more on the Presidential Campaign. I was marvelled by Alan Alda 's performance in the last season (season 6). His performance in this season made me want to vote for him instead of Jimmy Smits.

I felt the loss of of John Spencer deeply. I got to know him in West Wing, and he just captivates the show with Martin Sheen. West Wing is always about the story that goes on, some of us are disappointed when Aaron Sorkin stop writing for the series. But the last season certainly has its highs and lows. I want to see more of Bartlet, Toby and CJ before they hand over, I did but each episode just left me wanting for more.

Well, I am not an American. The show brought me into America Politics in the most interesting form, I felt the urge for more seasons of West Wing but it cannot be.

The ending of the story tooks its lead from the issues happening right now. I feel every American should watch the show, and be proud of your Democracy. But we should learn to accept the differences of others as the Earth is only just so big.",1168473600,,1143,4.229357798165138

2633789,5,B000HC2LHQ,Having been a fan of the West Wing for a few years I was very much looking forward to see how the series would conclude and tie up any loose ends. I felt that Series 6 left me with the impression that episodes involving the present Barlett administration were not as interesting as earlier episodes with  more focus being placed on the new presidential race. Congressman Santos seemed to light up the screen in much the same way that Jed Barlett did in earlier series. That has changed with Series 7. The writers have managed to weave in stories which draw parallels and divergences between the presidential race and the Bartlett administration. The teaser in the first episode sets the series up well and what follows kept my interest until the final words of the last episode. Altogether a satisfying finish but I would have loved this fine drama to continue for many years to come.,1168300800,,884,4.666666666666667

The seventh season nevers comes close to looking like a series that has past its prime, on the contrary, it is as good as it has ever been. It runs up to the conclusion of the Bartlet presidency but every episode is fantastic and leaves you wanting more. The characters are fantastic with some very clever writing and whilst the series concludes in a satisfying way I couldn't help but wish that there was another series or at least a spin off so we could see what happens to some of the characters in the future.

Only one crticism - not enough Charlie. He has been my favourite character since Sam left. Sam also makes an appearance in a number of episodes. So overall very, very entertaining veiewing. Can be watched and enjoyed over and over again.",1168300800,,887,4.36969696969697

As a foreigner it helped me to understand the complexities of the American political system, although having subtitles in English would have made some fast-talking parts much easier to follow. The only downside to the whole series was that most of the people featured were basically nice people, and sadly we know that this is not the real world.

My favorite part of Season 7 was a guest appearance by New Jersey's own Bon Jovi (yeah, I know he's a huge Democratic supporter, that's his only downside though).

2633816,4,B000HC2LHQ,"If you never have seen this show, then there are only two routes you can take.  EITHER 1) Watch all 7 seasons of the series, or 2) Watch the first 4 seasons, and then stop the final episode of the 4th season with about 1-3 minutes to go so you'll miss the cliffhanger.  I would highly recommend only watching the first 4 seasons.  However, if you insist on watching past the 4th season, then be prepared because there is a huge drop off in quality.  The creator and writer Aaron Sorkin was fired after the 4th season.  Season 5 was horrible, and season 6 was better, but a shadow of the shows former self.  Season 7 could never be as good as the first 4 seasons.  That said, it was so dramatically better than season 5, and a lot better than season 6.  It was, if you will, a nice gift to the fans that stuck through the bad years, and which let the show exit on a positive note.  This season still ranks #5 out of 7 seasons, but like I said, if you had to live through seasons 5 and 6, it was a nice reward.

That's not to say the season didn't have its faults.  First, like I said, it wasn't as good as the first 4 seasons, so don't expect THAT much.  Second, it seemed as though they (writers, producers, network, you name it) were attempting to create the possibility of spinning the show off with a new President and cast.  The ratings weren't good enough, so they stopped trying to spin it of and focused on concluding the season.  Third, this season was almost 2 different shows - 1 with the former administration and 1 with the two competing candidates for president.  At times, the show would focus exclusively for an episode on either the campaign or what was going on at the White House.  That's easier to deal with on DVD, but was frustrating during the live season.

Finally, I don't want to spoil anything, so don't read on if you don't want a spoiler.

Ok, you've been warned.  Finally, one of the cast members passed away suddenly during the season.  I won't say who, but I will say that they had a very moving episode which both continued the story lines while paying homage to their fallen friend.  In the end, the show went out in a good way, and Season 7 was a nice reward for those who suffered through Season 5, and lived through season 6.  Like I said at the start, you might want to stop watching after season 4, but if you insist on plowing through past season 4, then this is a must own.",1167868800,,2413,4.245614035087719

2633818,2,B000HC2LHQ,"The only thing I have to say is that I loved the West Wing.  This show was one of the best shows on TV.  When Season 7 was moved to Sunday nights, I knew something was wrong, and I was right.  The entire season was awful.  The way to send off a show like this should have been more of what the show was all about.  Not the elections.  The entire season was devoted primarily to the elections.  I didn't care who won or who lost, it didn't matter, because we knew that this was the last season, and we wanted to get the last taste of the original cast and the original story lines, the driving force of the show.  The introduction of new characters is pointless, when the show was going to go off the air.  All the characters working on either the Republican or Democratic side was for nothing.  The last episode was the worse of all the episodes.  The way it ended with no fanfare, no love from each of the characters, just them walking away, that's terrible.  I was shocked that the producers actually put out such a bad product for their last season.  I now understand why the show got pushed to the Sunday night spot.  No one was going to watch it anyway.  Buy this DVD only if you want to have the entire collection.  But if you want true West Wing material, Seasons 1 - 6 1/2 are great.  Half of Season 6 was worthless as well.

2633820,5,B000HC2LHQ,"I've been a big fan of the show and couldn't wait to get my hands on the 7th and final season. Very, very emotional final season.

I usually don't care much for the bonus material, my expectations are quite low but the West Wing season 7t went BELOW LOW ! No interview, no look back on the 7 seasons, no behind the scene, no nothing ! The only bonus material is to watch the live debate from the director's chair (and watching him snaping his fingers every 4 seconds gets old after 1/2 a minute), or to watch a making and rehearsing of that live debate. That episode was exciting when showed on TV, not so much on DVD and it is certainly not interesting to see them rehearse (kills the legend really). Somehow I'm not that surprised by this lack of bonus material: I can't remember a single DVD season that had any good ones (and I've seen them all), and just remember that NBC refused to pay any extra money to have a special program aired with the last very last episode... That's cheap yeah.

About the subtitles, season 7, like season 6, does not have any english subtitles (french & spanish only). Since I'm not fluent when it comes to the speech speed of these guys (Josh & Toby, you're killing me !), I always appreciate having english subtitles to keep me on track with the story, and so that the small jokes aren't lost on me. Well, this time around I had to put the french subtitles (my native language) and just hated it... Very bad translation overall, and I understand that it's difficult (impossible ?) to translate jokes, but can they at least try to make it funny ?",1165190400,2,1581,4.374149659863946
2633821,2,B000HC2LHQ,"This show was always way too naive and idealistic to be believed.  A critic from the Village Voice called it a ""liberal fantasy camp"", which it is.  It comes from that philosophy that politicians ""do the right thing"", and political operatives put aside their personal differences and do what's best for the country.  It doesn't happen that way, it never has, and, sadly, probably never will.  This season had a couple of unbelievable occurences, like Alan Alda's portrayal of a Republican pro-choice (!) candidate.  The GOP would never run a pro-choice candidate, ever.  Even the addition of the politically aware Janeane Garofalo didn't save this show.  Now, if they had let the cynical, acerbic Garofalo write some episodes, that would have been interesting.  Janeane actually knows more about politics than most of the pundits (and probably the writers of this show) combined.  I do agree that a tribute to John Spencer should have been included.  Regardless of your opinion of the show, there should have been a tribute of some kind to him, considering he was such an intregal part of the show.  Anyway, the show has been cancelled, and hopefully a more realistic political show will come about.",1165104000,,1199,4.974874371859296
2633822,5,B000HC2LHQ,"The important thing to celebrate, when discussing the seventh season of The West Wing, is it's originality.  While the fifth season, and a good chunk of the sixth tried desperately to reclaim the glory of the Aaron Sorkin days, the seventh visually and emotionally recreates itself into a new, living, breathing creation.

The same characters featured in the first three seasons, arguably the highlight of most fans' experience, return true to form, yet newly created in the closing episodes of the sixth, and the entire seventh season.  Visually, the camera moves in new ways, colors are used to create mood.  Emotionally, solid new character fuel the stories of the people we already love, and add to an already impeccable cast.

Seriously, if you didn't watch this on T.V.- and most of you didn't- you should buy it soon.  The stunning end to seven seasons of excellence out does any television show in history, and rebuilds a franchise so many said was dead.  And it was, ultimately- people stopped watching.

In the final ten episodes of the season, once the writers and producers realized that the show would not be back, it's almost as if they were picked up for an endless number of seasons.  It becomes fast, urgent, gripping and unique.  The actors bring solid meaning to the words, and the storyline flows smoothly to an ultimately satisfying- if not bittersweet- end.

The West Wing IS the greatest television show in history and ends of the same great note it began.  Even at its worst, West Wing was better than anything out there, and at its best, it is a sight to see.  Do yourself a favor and buy this season- you WILL NOT regret it!",1165104000,3,1650,4.7272727272727275
2633823,5,B000HC2LHQ,"Alan Alda must feel blessed to have been such an integral part of two of the greatest shows in television history.  The creative forces behind the West Wing gathered their collective strengths and gave the series the ending it deserved.  Decades from now I'll be pulling out these discs and watching them.

With horror and sadness we learned last December that John Spencer had suddenly passed.  West Wing fans grieved and sent their prayers on behalf of Mr. Spencer and those who had actually known and loved him.  We can see that some of that love and respect gets translated to the show and the episodes that swirl around Leo's death are among the most heart-breaking I've ever seen on screen.  When Kristin Chenoweth as Annabeth tells Bradley Whitford as Josh that Leo has died her tears didn't look at all like ""acting"". The same can be said for the expressions on the faces of all of the actors at Leo's funeral, ending with Martin Sheen as President Bartlet.

The storyline of this season centers on the Presidential race with Jimmy Smits portraying Congressman Matt Santos against Alda's Senator Arnold Vinick.  This ticket was clearly the fantasy of the liberal writers as even the Republican candidate is pro-choice, insults some NRA-type vigilantes and all but thumbs his nose at the religious right.  As Vinick's campaign is derailed somewhat in the aftermath of a nuclear accident in California a particularly shrewish right-winger is brought in to help the Senator woo back the republican base.  Ron Silver continues in his role as Bruno Gianelli, the political strategist who only cares about winning - and knows how to do it.  Patricia Richardson is effective as Vinick's assistant who tries to keep him on track.  Janeane Garofalo serves as sparring partner to Josh as Lou, a democratic operative who gets almost as much pleasure from seeing Josh flounder (which he inevitably does for brief moments) as from helping her political causes.  Teri Polo plays Helen - candidate Santos' wife - and this character always seems a little less enthusiastic than would be appropriate for the wife of a man who may become president.

Aside from the sensitive and respectful way the real-life death of John Spencer was worked into the fictional story, this season gets a few other things right.  Where we may have been frustrated in the past at the lack of love lives of most of these characters for years - all in the service of their country - this season we get to see most of the principal characters hook up in one way or another.  First daughter Ellie gets married in a White House ceremony curiously missing both of her sisters. (Although all three daughters make Leo's funeral.) Through their own obvious attraction and Donna's persistence Josh and Donna finally get together.  In the opening of the first episode we're glad to see in flashback that C.J. and Danny Concannon have married and have a child, and in other episodes we get to see Danny's gentle courting techniques on one of the most powerful (and powerfully nice) women in the world.  It's also gratifying to see some ""old friends"" show up in the final episodes such as Rob Lowe's return as Sam Seaborn.  (Sam is recruited to duty by Josh in a scene that pays homage to the earlier flashback scene from season two when Josh conscripts Sam to the first ""Bartlet for America"" campaign.)

To the shows writers, directors, actors, and the professionals who shot, set and costumed the show: Bravo! I'll miss you dearly and watch these shows with enduring pleasure.

To the pinheads who decided to release these DVDs without any significant extras: A pox on your houses.  While the first seasons came with full sets of subtitles, documentaries and commentary tracks in which performers, directors and creators couldn't withhold their obvious glee - this season comes with next to nothing.  The first seasons came with subtitles in English, Francais and Espanol.  The last two seasons have not had an option for English subtitles.  What if the viewer is hard of hearing?

What is the reason for these deficiencies? Laziness? Complacency? No doubt the almighty dollar played the major role.  This show - and this show's fans - deserved better.

Rest in well-deserved and honored peace, John Spencer. Adieu, West Wing.",1163980800,94,4285,4.8812154696132595
2633824,4,B000HC2LHQ,"With all The West Wing's Emmy Awards, it was truly a landmark series. For it to go off the air with a ratings wimper, well, that's the way it goes sometimes. But quality-wise, the show rebounded nicely from the low point that was its fifth season. The real shame here is the lack of any extras worth watching. When there was no show retrospective before the final episode, NBC blamed the actors who wanted money for their time. Why there was nothing done for John Spencer or any insight on how his death changed the final season is a shame on those who put this package together, obviously on the cheap. And what is with the ""See other disks for extras"" prompt that is on all 6 disks? Yes, the episodes are quality television, but the product that is Season 7 is a MAJOR disappointment. This show earned its status, to treat it like an afterthought is plain sad.",1163376000,8,862,4.427672955974843

My point is the awful, awful DVD.  No English-language subtitles (for the second year in a row).  Only two special features, both about the debate episode.  No insight from the actors about their take on seven years of ground-breaking television.  No tribute to John Spencer.  I feel as if the folks at Warner Brothers Television knew they had their market well in hand, so the quality of the product really didn't matter.  ""No bother, we'll sell enough anyway.""

2633839,5,B000HC2LHQ,"When season 7 premiered on Sunday nights, I knew in my heart of hearts that this was the first nail in the coffin of the greatest television show in history. I was right. I consider myself to be one of the biggest fans of The West WIng and own the first 6 seasons on DVD. It's true the show lost alot of its magic and ratings when creator Aaron Sorkin left after season 4 but John Wells gave a valiant effort to the series. This season focused mainly on the race of the new president. Democrat Matt Santos was brilliantly played by Jimmy Smitts. Alan Alda one of the greatest actors to ever grace the screen was phenominal as Republican nominee Arnold Vinick. With the cast that this show had it's amazing this show was not at the top of the ratings. However there was some fluff in this season with the wedding episode, I felt that was a bit contrived myself. With the shocking loss of John Spencer I felt that it was the final nail in the coffin. A week later NBC announced that it was going to cancel the show at the end of the season. This gave the writers an opportunity to put closure on the show which I felt was well done with the final episode ""Tommorow"" and we said goodbye to our beloved characters. One thing I loved about the West Wing, when anyone returned to the show, they used the original actors and we see alot of familiar faces pop into this season including the triumphant return of Sam Seaborn played wonderfully by Rob Lowe. I don't think another show will ever be as good as The West Wing so I would encourage everyone to buy this series. It was smart, funny, sad, frustrating and just plain entertaining. Great show that will be missed!",1162598400,11,1661,4.344051446945338

The series, which owes its genesis to the movie, The American President, is probably the best and most detailed study of the happenings at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue ever created for popular culture.

The seventh and final season brought back the sharp feistiness of the Sorkin/Schlamme days.  Nearly all the main character stories were resolved; however, the Charlie/Zoe storyline was left hanging. This series was definitely not worthy of such a cowardly decision.  (While it could be debated that Charlie was not a main character, the relationship was a major storyline over several seasons and worthy of a definitive resolution.)

John Spencer's death was an ironic and unexpected blow to the series.  I'm glad that ""Leo McGarry"" was remembered in a way that was befitting both the character and the man who portrayed him.

Without a doubt, the entire series is a definite keeper!",1161820800,27,1103,6.032051282051282

I cannot expresses adequately how sad I am that this show is cancelled. In my heart of hearts, THIS is my government. This is my president and his staff and all the machinations of the crucible that is democratic government in Washington.

Because of this show, I refuse to watch regular TV anymore. I refuse to be subjected to commercials.

I watch seasons 1 thru 6 all the way through, again and again.

Sure, the writing is better with some writers than others and some episodes and seasons are better than others. I DON'T CARE, I LOVE THEM ALL AND WATCH THEM ALL.
I am waiting with baited breath for season 7 to come out on DVD. I will buy it the first day, the same as I have with all the other seasons.

I won't subject myself to the [...] of regular TV & cable any more, ever again.

However, too many episodes centre around the election and the end result is, frankly, laughable.  A Democrat wins office AGAIN - this is in complete contrast to the general trend of American political history.  But worse than that, the program makers have denied themselves the chance for some excellent drama.  If Bartlett had had to hand over to a Republican there would have been real tension... Nonetheless, Alan Alda is outstanding as the Republican nominee and much more interesting, chrasmatic and (Yeah!) presidential than Jimmy Smits.",1158278400,20,657,5.238095238095238

The episode I'll play the most in series #7 will be Alda's emmee award performance in the debate episode. Amazed that Channing could receive an emmee nom for a comedy series (""Out of Practice"")after her horriffic portrayal of Abby Bartlett in this closing episode, but if this 7th season teaches us anything, it's about the transitory nature of politics. Some great episodes, some not so great episodes, I'll buy it, because you won't see something (a study of the Presidency) of this quality and detail in a long, long time.",1157155200,19,648,4.954128440366972
2633844,3,B000HC2LHQ,"As last season ended Matthew Santos had just grabbed the Democratic nomination and Arnold Vinnick received the Republican nomination.

This season is about the Presidential race.  And while a real presidential race is only a few months, this takes almost the entire season.

Now, this is told from the Democratic point of view but it is obvious that Alan Alda has more charisma as an actor than Jimmy Smits.  So therefore, most views (an the TV academy) are rooting for Vinnick. Therefore, the producers and authors have to create a nuclear accident for Santos to squeak by Vinnick at the election.

To complicate things is a real tragedy.  Last December actor John Spencer suddenly died.  This meant that, the season only two thirds shot, a main character has to disappear.  They handle this well until after the Leo's death is announced on election night.  Then they turn this into a series of dramas that do not play well.

Further more, by this time NBC had already made the decision to cancel the show.  So, why not be realistic and let the show come to a natural ending and not this overblown and contrived ending.

The final episodes reunite many of the ongoing semi regulars. This is good to see and let them make a final appearance and close some loose ends.

Am I saying do not buy this dvd. NO! I am saying that you should buy this to complete your collection.  This is a MUST HAVE SERIES!!  Just wish that they could have created a more realistic finaly to one of the GREATEST shows of our time.",1155945600,34,1507,4.57089552238806

Something that neither I nor Alda would do in real life for a party that would never support a candidate like Alda. I suppose the West Wing was arguing for something better than we got in those years.
The fantasy West Wing floated far away from reality and lost the viewers that supported it.

Santos and Josh struggle on. Josh comes apart without Donna but carries on.  The Bartlett White House is lost in tepid stories that are not that good. But, still Martin Sheen and Allison Janney do a magnificent job.  Worst of all, we lose John Spenser for real.  The world without Leo is sad indeed.
