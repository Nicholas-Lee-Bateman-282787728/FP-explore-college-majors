5970625,5,B00F8OUC0G,"I'm really starting to dig this whole ""briefs"" compilation thing that these guys are putting out.  This one in particular was the first where I actually legitimately jibed with each segment.  The thing I like about these DVDs is, you can put one in, watch a ""movie"" (or in this case, a short), come back a few days later, watch another one, and so on...  It's like reading a book of short stories.  It actually took me three weeks to finish ""Green Briefs"" and, yeah, I was entertained the whole time.  And what, it was like, twenty bucks or something?  Yeah, I'd say I'm happy with the purchase to say the least. :)",1397952000,11,615,4.398230088495575
5970626,3,B00F8OUC0G,"There is a short in this collection--the Shabat--that I rented as a solo short and liked.  However, the other stories are pedantic at best. We've seen it all before. The abusive father, the bullying brother...these are important stories, but in the context of film and storytelling (creative endeavors), should be told in a more original and less hackneyed manner. With the exception of the Shabat short, I did not view any of the other important topics covered in this collection in new way or through different eyes or from a new perspective.",1397779200,,544,4.913043478260869

5970629,5,B00F8OUC0G,"What can now say, more then amazing!  I am so truly have with this collection of shorts.  I have the blue and the black set but there is a film called. The symphony of silence is an amazing tear jerker, what a truly touching story and yes I would truly recommend you pick this film series up right away :-)",1389225600,4,306,4.083333333333333
5970630,5,B00F8OUC0G,"Green Briefs is a collection of five gay-centered short movies, all related in some way to family. All five are closely focused on very specific circumstances, and each one may be meaningful to people who are in or have been in exactly the same very specific circumstances. They could be called ""issue"" movies, each meaningful only to viewers who are concerned about its specific issue. Only one of the five manages to transcend its narrow issue to touch people in ANY kind of situation ANYWHERE. That exception is Shabbat Dinner.

Only one of the other titles (Kimchi Fried Dumplings) gives any clue as to the movie's subject (a mixed-race Asian-American family); the other three have generic titles (Pride, The Commitment, The Symphony of Silence) that give no hint what their subjects might be. The fact that Shabbat Dinner most boldly announces its narrow, Jewish focus and then explodes that narrowness is tribute to its courage and the skill with which it was made.

Even more remarkable is that Shabbat Dinner's ""skill"" is not at all apparent in the beginning. It is by far the worst looking and sounding, the least professional movie of the five. The photography and the sound are some of the worst I've ever encountered. It looks like it was recorded on a huge, 10-pound 1980s VHS camcorder - on 30-year-old tape - by a restless ten-year-old. The camera is only occasionally in focus and jerks randomly from one extreme close-up to another. The dialogue - while always understandable - sounds like some parts were recorded on the camcorder and other parts were dubbed in later. Viewers who like to criticize ""production values"" will have a field day with it.

What it does, though, and does with astonishing power, is capture the thrilling awkwardness of adolescent sexuality like no other movie I have ever seen. The two boys could not be clumsier, less cool, less attractive to an outsider. They are not at all beautiful physically, but they discover something in each other of such raw, irresistible power that they crash into each other like stars colliding in the center of a galaxy. It is joyful and breathtaking, and it transforms those two graceless, pimply adolescents boys into something far more beautiful than the most idolized star in Hollywood.

Two of the other short movies - Pride and Kimchi Fried Dumplings - are about caring for aged parents and reconciling either with them or with siblings who are caring for them. As far as I'm concerned, helpless old people belong in nursing homes, not tied like millstones around their children's necks, so I have no sympathy with young people who get themselves into such situations. If you do, then you may like those two movies. (I'm old myself, by the way, not a self-centered thirtysomething with better things to do.)

The Commitment is about a gay couple trying to adopt a baby, and The Symphony of Silence is about teenage bullying - both currently popular issues that happen to be meaningless to me. The movies, while earnest and probably effective for their target audiences, don't manage to transcend their narrow issues.

I generously gave this DVD two stars at first, but I'm going to raise it to five ONLY because of Shabbat Dinner. Those 14 minutes are well worth the cost of the DVD. The other 97 minutes are worth watching only if their issues are meaningful to you personally. They were not to me.",1387756800,2,3382,4.842560553633218
5970631,5,B00F8OUC0G,"Five gay short films filled with family drama, including:  ""Pride"", ""The Commitment"", ""Shabbat Dinner"", ""Kimchi Fried Dumplings"" and ""The Symphony of Silence"". One of my favorites was ""The Symphony of Silence"" that took me on a roller coaster of emotions if you are open to seeing the film for its self worth. Many people do not like short films, But in my opinion, I feel that this one hit home on so many levels. Not just because of it's gay content, but for it's content in general. I am not one to tell people to buy a film. But I will tell you to keep an open mind and judge for yourself.",1387152000,17,593,4.294642857142857

5970642,4,B00F8OUC0G,"For the last film, it was well acted and the plot make sense. However, am I the only one that had more sympathetic for the bully brother crying at the end because of his great performance? The gay brother, bullied and all throughout the movie, didn't gave a performance that made me cry or emotionally invested. Also I thought the eulogy was a little preachy, given that her son just committed suicide. Overall, all watchable and worthy films.",1423612800,,443,4.6923076923076925

5970645,4,B00F8OUC0G,"There are five short films, and each presents an interesting story. PRIDE is about the relationship between a son and his homophobic father, after the old man has become senile due to Alzheimer disease. The old man has been brutal and thrown his son out of the home, when the gay son was 17. Now the old man is ""dropped into the lap"" of the son, as he and his partner are about to begin a Pride celebration. THE COMMITMENT is about a gay couple who wants to have a family by adopting. I really enjoyed SHABBAT DINNER about two couples who get together for dinner, and allow their two teen sons to get to know each other in the bedroom. One is openly gay, and the other is just curious. I was ""marooned"" to the bedroom of a buddy several times as a teen, but I never had the experience where the buddy was gay, which is really too bad. It would have resolved a lot of issues for me, a lot sooner. KIMCHI FRIED DUMPLINGS is about a family reunion at Christmas, where the older gay son brings home a new partner after a sad break-up of his former partner. The very sad ""SYMPHONY OF SILENCE"" is about Zach who is bullied, not only by the jerks at his high school, but also by his older brother, who is one of the biggest jerks. Each of these films is a decent story, and well worth the watch. The story is very sad, and I will probably will never forget it.",1420070400,,1353,4.1679389312977095

The next two were 14 mins each and were quite good.  The final one - ""The Symphony of Silence"" running for 40 mins, was the one I found most impacting. It deals with bullying and the consequences and impact on a family, particularly one member - the brother. Watch it and you may need your tissues.  I felt it was very powerful and the anti-bullying message very powerful.",1415664000,2,542,4.4

5970657,4,B00F8OUC0G,"Like most short-film collections that I've seen, this one features movies that get increasingly better as the show goes on, both in terms of basic story construction and the quality of the acting.

The first short, ""Pride"", had a somewhat predictable plot, while the second one, ""Commitment"", struck me as well-intentioned but ultimately unbelievable. (If I were the adoption coordinator working with the couple in this particular movie, I'd scratch them from the list as soon as I witnessed their unhinged reaction to the disappointing news that occurs toward the end of the film. And, perhaps equally troubling, they get all kissy-kissy again just as suddenly as things erupt. Okaaaay, Sybil ...)

The last three shorts (""Shabbat Dinner"", ""Kimchi Fried Dumplings"", and ""The Symphony of Silence"") are the most rewarding. Amongst these three the themes vary widely -- whimsical coming-out, the healing of broken family connections, and bullying, respectively. ""Symphony of Silence"" is by far the most accomplished film in the collection, perhaps fitting its serious theme.

This was a nice way to spend a Sunday afternoon. Recommended for fans of short films who understand going in that they're not going to be getting premium production values. What counts most here is heart.",1407024000,2,1278,5.285714285714286

They were meant to present a message because even today we have friction in all forms toward LGBT men and women, and how we react molds how others will respond.  All of these were funny, or sad, or informative, or entertaining, but they were worth watching and are memorable.

This collection of five shorts (none of which, by the way, contain the hunky young man in a green swim suit pictured on the cover!) displays wonderful screenwriting, cinematography, editing, acting, and storytelling.  I concur with other reviewers here that the final short, ""Symphony of Silence,"" was excellent and very moving, but the whole collection was well worth my time and all were thought-provoking.
