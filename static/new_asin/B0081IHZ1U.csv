8523953,5,B0081IHZ1U,"I watched this drama so fast - totally addicting.  I always know when I really like a drama because I find myself missing the characters when it is over (ex.  Padam, Padam, Secret Garden, Protect the Boss to name a few) and I found myself sad the story was over.  Leads were really strong and can't wait to see them in other K-D's.  If your a drama addict like me you will not want to miss this one!  I recieved a very good quality product and the subtitles were wonderful.",1374969600,3,473,4.211111111111111
8523954,5,B0081IHZ1U,"I loved this drama. I'm glad I purchased it for my own. The actors and actresses were excellent in their roles. The story line was typical, except the multimillionaire became rich through his own efforts and through trials and tribulations rather than through inheritance. He meets up with a female cop who has her own code of ethics. She's tough and strong and yet vulnerable. Officer Cha Bong-sun has been on her own since the age of 14, Seo Jae-hee, the talented multimillionaire, lost his parents at the age of 13 and all that his parents left for him was stolen by relatives. This they have in common but not much more than that. One thing I liked about this drama was that Office Cha stayed strong and true to her character to the end. She didn't end up a weakling like the lead female roles often do in K-dramas. You can see the age difference between the two actors in the lead roles but who cares? They were believable and excellent. Yoon Shi-yoon played Seo Jae Hee (cute) and Lee Ji-ah was Officer Cha. Han Go-eun played the female you love to hate (Park Hwa-young), Seo Hyo-lim was Kim Dal, the girl who totally annoys you. Great, feisty love story.",1365552000,3,1161,4.507109004739337
