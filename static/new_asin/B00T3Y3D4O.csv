8720564,5,B00T3Y3D4O,"True enough, this is not a conventional documentary on William Burroughs.  Those are already out there, and they're much appreciated; yet to add another suchlike film to the list would seem both uncalled-for and unneeded.  Instead of this, we have WSB In The Dreamachine, which is a unique and extremely valuable addition to what is already on the shelf.  In this film, nothing is recycled from previous sources; the approach and attitude is totally fresh, and there is much to admire.  The 1997 visit to Burroughs at his home is in itself a rare and intimate standout, and worthy of the project as a whole; more than that, it is something that would never properly fit into the confining format and time restraint of the typical documentary.  This film is made up of such nonconventional gems.  Highly recommended.",1508889600,3,815,4.869565217391305
