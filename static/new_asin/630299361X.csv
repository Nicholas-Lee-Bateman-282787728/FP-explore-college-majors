535042,4,630299361X,"Another trilogy comes hot on the heels of the E-Space trilogy, which saw the debut of Adric and the departure of Romana and K9.  The next transition paves the way for new companions and in Castrovalva, a new Doctor.
The Keeper Of Traken, the Fourth Doctor's penultimate story, is the first story of this second transition and involves the Doctor and Adric, now back in normal space, invited to Traken at the behest of the Keeper, the powerful inwho serves as the organizing principle of the Traken Union.  What is the Traken Union?  It's ""a whole empire held together by people being terribly nice to each other,"" where ""evil just shrivels up and dies.""  Pity something like that doesn't exist on Earth.  The Keeper, now nearing the end of his reign, feels some kind of evil coming to Traken, and it somehow involves three good people--Consul Tremas, his new wife Kassia, also a Consul, and his daughter from his previous marriage, Nyssa.
There's also the Melkur, what Trakenites call evil beings who are trapped upon landing on Traken, calcify, and pass harmlessly through the soil.  This Melkur, a white statue with an angular face, seems to be taking its time dying.
On Traken, the Doctor and Adric, with aid from Tremas and Nyssa, get caught up investigating a mysterious force whose profile pattern is somehow familiar.  By episode 2, it's clear that there's more to the Melkur.  In fact, it may be more than just a statue.  To quote the text on the video sleeve, ""the Doctor smells a rat of the oldest kind.""
One thing that gives me pause is the character of Proctor Neman.  Clearly, Traken's powers to refute evil do not extend to people who take bribes, as Neman does.  Another point of interest is the chaos and omens that Trakenites attribute with the Keeper's imminent demise.  Things waver between ""benevolent wisdom versus irrational fears and intuition.""
Sarah Sutton shines in her debut as Nyssa, who's established as scientifically adept, a good partner to Adric.  Anthony Ainley (Tremas) also debuts in the first in a series of recurring roles in the series.  Denis Carey (the Keeper) played Professor Chronotis in the Who story Shada and later the old man in the Who story Timelash.  John Woodnutt, who plays Consul Seron, complete in a hairdo that makes him look like an elderly William Shakespeare, also had previous Who appearances:  Spearhead From Space (Hibbert) and Frontier In Space (the Draconian Emperor).
Tom Baker's his light-hearted self.  In the beginning, when Adric points out that ""a lot of time, you don't really make a lot of sense.""  the Doctor says, ""Ahh!  Oh, you've noticed that, have you?""
The concept of a planet of harmony is interesting, but unfortunately, we see it in a time of transition.  Strong characterizations by the supporting players give life to this story.  Oh, and there's a twist ending in the final minute of this story carried through to the next story.",1042070400,6,2913,4.832661290322581
535043,4,630299361X,"Season 18 continues on a definite high. Although the story is fairly traditional, certain points make it a much more interesting set of episodes than others of its kind. For one, the planet of Traken and its inhabitants are given some culture...not extending beyond the most elite of elite, but it's _something_ anyway. The idea of the Source, with the Keeper and Consuls, is actually a science fiction sort of concept, rarely seen in ""Doctor Who"" (although this season, more than any other, would feature such ideas). The ending, too, is very nice, and for viewers of the time must have been quite a shock.
The acting is also quite good. Tom Baker is definitely on-form, although slightly more light-hearted than in the last few stories, and Matthew Waterhouse's companion of Adric hasn't yet become annoying (he will soon enough, early in the next season). Anthony Ainley and Sarah Sutton both do very commendable jobs in their 'guest roles' of Tremas and Nyssa, and without a doubt Geoffrey Beevers steals the show as the villain of the piece.
This story leads into the next two stories, ""Logopolis"" - the last story of season 18, and Tom Baker's final performance as the Doctor - and ""Castrovalva"" - season 19's opener, which saw the introduction of Peter Davison's Doctor. These were originally conceived as a sort of linked trilogy, and without giving away how they are connected for those few who don't know, it really does work.

I rate it 5 stars but Logopolis is better still.  The compaginion gets very annoying in later DW stories.

535045,4,630299361X,"What's the saga of Dr. who without a true arch-rival.  Only the enigmatic renegade, The Master, kept the Doctor on his toes, and it's hard to imagine  life that went no further than some wind-up toy soldiers with a bad allergy  to gold (Cybermen) and would be conquerors of the universe who can't even  climb up a flight of steps (the daleks).  Supposedly doomed by the expense  of his lost regenerations, and the death of actor Roger Delagado, the  master returns, ravaged and dessicated but not without an idea.  He lures  the doctor to the idylic world of Traken, home of a powerful being known as  the Keeper of Traken, where a solemn ritual will pass the mantle of keeper  to a new generation.  With its elegant foreshadow of the end of the Tom  Baker years - the era that introduced Who to America, ""Keeper of  Traken"" presents death as an evil emerging from a pastoral garden free  of entropy.  Scenes in which the master appears, eliminates the keeper's  would-be successor and ultimately assumes the body of another Traken  disturbingly hint at the Master's evil, especially for a show originally  intended for children.  Even before the Master reclaims a new mortal form,  his voice alone is enough to give anybody shivers.  Lackluster effects  never dissauded Who fans, and the cool determined voice of Whovian evil is  better than all the CGI of a season of Star Trek Nex Gen.

535063,3,630299361X,"This is a piece that features a cool concept with the idea of Tracken, a peaceful world where evil can't thrive, the re-introduction of a Who Villain last seen four seasons before,

The weakness of the story is the pacing was somewhat tedious, getting off to a weak start as the Incumbent Keeper steals into the TARDIS and delivers backstory in Part 1. This story feels like it should have been 1 or 2 parts shorter which shouldn't have been hard given that this was the longest season of Doctor Who since Patrick Troughton had been the Doctor. Also, there are some odd turns that don't make sense within the context of the plot and a weak three Stooges-esque scene of the Doctor knocking out three guards.

Still, this does feature Mathew Waterhouse providing his best performance yet as Adric. (I know that's not saying much) And Anthony Ainsley turning in a solid turn as Counselor Tremas. Overall, a I'd give the episode a 5/10 rating. It didn't really use its concept to the full potential and the result was a story that crawled too often.",1418601600,,1045,4.612903225806452

535097,4,630299361X,"I just re-watched this story for the first time in many years. I was struck by a few things, most of them positive.

First, this is the first time we have seen the Doctor without Romana in three Seasons. I loved the Romana character, but it is refreshing to see Baker without her or K-9. Second, the chemistry between Baker and Matthew Waterhouse is very good. Had Baker done one more Season you could see this relationship developing nicely. I always felt we missed out on one final stage for the Baker Doctor. There is renewed energy in the Keeper of Traken and it would have been nice to see that continue. Although Baker was tiring of the role at this point, it was really Nathan-Turner wanting him to leave that ultimately pushed Tom Baker out.

Waterhouse and Davison clearly did not have the same chemistry and the Davison Doctor dismissed Adric right from the beginning. Also, Nathan-Turner unfortunately overloaded the TARDIS with far too many companions when Davison started and the Adric character was the one that lost out. Sorry Tegan fans, but they should have killed her off with her Auntie in Logopolis.

The only disapointment watching this again after so many years is the return of the Master. I was glad to see the Master back, but the build up is so long, and Baker's scene with him at the end of the 4th episode so short, that in the end it is a little ani-climactic. I know it is just setting the stage for the next episodes, but they could have made the Master's appearance a little more dramatic.

Overall an excellent and refreshing Baker episode. This is truly one of the last of the Great Doctor Who adventures as the series under John Nathan-Turner begins a downward spiral after this, until finally you get to the Sylvester McCoy adventures which look like cheesy home videos. Enjoy this from the end of Doctor Who's Golden Age.",1185148800,2,1858,4.621212121212121
535098,5,630299361X,"A lot of anagrams went into the making of ""The Keeper of Traken"".  That's the fact you'll remember best after watching the story's DVD release.  Three of the four guest commentators (author Johnny Byrne, and actors Matthew Waterhouse and Anthony Ainley) make much play of the origins of the names ""Adric"" and ""Tremas"".  For fun, Ainley also comes up with an anagram for story editor ""Christopher H. Bidmead"".  The result is reprinted in the title of this review, and it almost makes sense.

Of course, ""The Keeper of Traken"" doesn't need a whole lot of effort invested into the DVD to highlight its strong points.  Tom Baker's penultimate story is one of ""Doctor Who""'s finest-looking entries. The combination of Byrne's first ""Who"" script, a small well-portrayed cast of characters, Roger Limb's melodious background score (so unlike his later militaristic ""DW"" themes), and the intricately designed sets make ""Traken"" a joy to watch.

Waterhouse played the sole companion in this story -- a rare instance where the Doctor has no female companions.  But while the much-maligned Adric has taken his lumps in mainstream fandom for a quarter-century now, ""Traken"" stands as one of his better stories. Waterhouse and Tom Baker's exchange of witty banter for this story's first three minutes works very well and stands as a ""what might have been"", had not the changing nature of the production removed Baker from the cast and added two extra companions to the TARDIS within a matter of weeks.

The plot's fairly simple, though it's spiced up, as with all Season 18 stories, by Bidmead's keen ear for techno-babble.  ""The Keeper of Traken"" is really a morality play at heart, dressed up with the science of ""bio-electronics"".  When Kassia (Sheila Ruskin, the story's weakest link) tries to save her husband by turning to an inanimate extraterrestrial Evil, the Melkur (Geoffrey Beevers provides the voice for an unnamed stuntman in an uncomfortable looking costume), Traken's paradise falls apart.  Not merely in an array of pyrotechnics, however, or in a display of histrionic acting, although those are both on display.  Rather, it's the minor flaws in each individual which Melkur exploits to bring paradise to its knees.  Pulling the strings is the most flawed individual of them all -- for Melkur cloaks an even greater threat, the dying Master, last seen thwarted in ""The Deadly Assassin"".

Pay special note to Anthony Ainley's first Doctor Who appearance -- though he doesn't become the Master until the story's final minute, it's all here! The over-acting! The snarled words! The incomprehensible stressing of odd syllables!  As the Master within the Melkur wields ever great power over first Kassia and then over the entire planet, characters fall prey to their own vices -- greed for money, greed for power, and in one notable case, one character done in by his own compulsive honesty.  The story ends on one of Doctor Who's rare tragic notes -- but fortunately, to quote Melkur, this is only the beginning, and for the Return of the Master story arc, the best is yet to come.

The DVD release of ""Traken"" features one of the more entertaining commentary tracks, devoid of the repetitive on-set anecdotes that plague a lot of the releases of Troughton and Pertwee-era episodes.  Episode writer Johnny Byrne spends a lot of time describing the thought processes that went into his development of the world of Traken, and both Waterhouse and Sarah Sutton are clearly fascinated by his ideas of the millennial society -- both separately express regret that they didn't speak to him during production and thus missed out on a lot of his intended themes.  Waterhouse does spend far too much time repeating lines of dialogue and reading the closing credits in a baroque voice, however.

The nicest discovery on the commentary is Anthony Ainley, who recorded this track (and one brief video clip as an Easter egg) shortly before his death in 2004.  He doesn't speak much, but his interest in the script, the sets, and the anagrams all lend great value to the track.  It's a shame he never recorded another.",1182729600,2,4104,4.976573938506589
535099,5,630299361X,"The ""Keeper of Traken"" is doomed. Well, yes, he's nearing the end of his millennial lifespan here, but I mean this storyline is doomed, doomed to be eclipsed by the pivotal storyline following on its heels, doomed to be merely the beginning of the end for Tom Baker's tenure as the Doctor, doomed ever to be the prologue. Which is to some degree intentional, since it's clearly written in such a way as to loosely link up with ""Logopolis""--and the Traken Keeper's impending demise subtly foreshadows the Fourth Doctor's. Or sets the tone for it anyway. And yet this is an exceptionally fine story in its own right and on its own terms, a classic tale of cosmic cycles, succession crises, and deceitful tempters in the midst of harmonious gardens (no, not Paradise Towers).

Indeed, this story is really mythological in scope and tone, doubly so in fact, with subtle and sophisticated but discernible echoes both of the old Arthurian legends of a faltering and rising king whose biorhythms are keyed into those of nature and society and of the serpent in the Garden of Eden from Genesis. All of this gives ""The Keeper of Traken"" an eerily unusual level of depth and mystique, and yet these archaic themes are alchemically transformed into science fiction motifs very much at home in the ""Doctor Who"" fictional universe in ways that are not only plausible but compelling. This kind of alchemy is (and has been) easily botched, too, so this is quite an achievement. The story is anchored squarely in reality though by a number of means, including a finely crafted script with many little comments and scenes adding up to give a real sense of a complex functioning Traken society, incredibly good acting by the supporting cast (including Anthony Ainley, who makes Tremas totally believable as a person), and some of the most gorgeously imaginative sets and costumes you'll ever see on ""Doctor Who"" (and that's saying a lot).

There's a lot more to commend in this story, too. Tom Baker is still giving the role of the Doctor his all even though at this point he could take it easy (what are they going to do, fire him?), the Doctor's mentoring relationship with Adric is still endearing at this early stage, Nyssa is gradually introduced rather nicely as the story progresses, and the return of an old arch-foe is weaved rather neatly into the story and hinted at elusively until the end. Plus there's an unintentionally funny incident (funny in a grade school way) obviating any need for a bloopers reel as a DVD extra.

But wouldn't you know, after praising this story to high heaven on its own merits alone, I'm going to go and mention that it's also included in a DVD set along with those next two storylines ever overshadowing it, and actually recommend this set in terms of good old convenience and simple economics. Yes, unless you have a specific interest exclusively in ""The Keeper of Traken"" (your cousin was the cameraman, say), the fervent ""Doctor Who"" fans amongst you might as well go with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-New-Beginnings-The-Keeper-of-Traken-Logopolis-Castrovalva/dp/B000NJXG8G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who - New Beginnings (The Keeper of Traken / Logopolis / Castrovalva)</a>.

This series is particularly well-acted, featuring, in particular, a notable appearance by Anthony Ainsley (who would go on to play the Master in future episodes) as all-around good guy, Tremas, who breaks from the council of elders to help the Doctor and his companions do the right thing.  In this series we also get to meet Nyssa, who will become a regular after this episode.
The costumes and sets in this series were particularly good, and the baddie in these episodes, the Melkor, is especially creepy, both due to his powers and to the fact that he is not what he seems to be.  As usual, there are a few lapses in logic and the Doctor, as is frequent in the Tom Baker years, manages to solve a few too many predicaments with overly convenient technology, but the suspense holds throughout and the ending sets up the pathos for the next series, ""Logopolis,"" which is the final Tom Baker series.  Much has been made about how Tom Baker seemed to walk through episodes and get overly jokey near the end of his tenure, but in this series and ""Logopolis,"" Tom Baker shows some of his best work.  Guess he wanted to go out on a high note.
Absolute must viewing before seeing ""Logopolis.""",1077148800,2,1472,4.539622641509434
535103,5,630299361X,"This story is set on the happy and peaceful planet of Traken. Nothing bad happens here but evil does occasionally appear, where it is eventually transferred into good or just disappears. The great keeper appears inside the Tartus at the beginning of the story, which tells anyone who knows the Doctors Tartus that something big is about to happen. The Keeper warns the Doctor about a growing evil on Traken and how this evil will destroy their world without his help. Of course, the good Doctor cannot resist interferring and heads for Traken. Once there, the Doctor is once again set up for a crime he did not commit and lands into custody while his comrade, Adric attempts to help. This story is the first episode for a new travelling companion, Nyssa. She is the daughter of the to be elected Keeper of Traken. She is as brilliant as Adric when it comes to contraptions and does her best to aid Adric in helping the Doctor to get out of yet another pickle. This story again involves the master who disguised as the Melkor (Melkor is what everyone on Traken calls anything that is evil), which in this story is a statue with red glowing eyes. The master wants to regenerate into the Keepership and repower himself. He almost succeeds at it too.  This story is one of my favorites and includes the Master in his most hideous form, which I really love. hehehehe. I like him all grossed out! Buy and add this to your collection and you will have made a really great choice.",1063929600,,1472,4.533834586466165

7834575,5,630299361X,This was the last of my VHS Doctor Who collection. I don't know how they did it back then but the transfer was clean with no imperfections whatsoever. Another classic find for me at the time but has since been replaced by the dvd equivalent.,1493424000,,241,4.377777777777778
7834576,5,630299361X,"Received defective disc, but seller was prompt and speedy with a working replacement. Also, the seller was pleasant and professional, and overall a pleasure to work with.

As for The Keeper of Traken, it's one of Tom Baker's above-average outings and I enjoyed the heck out of the story. This, the E-Space Trilogy, Logopolis, and Castrovalva comprise one of the best extended plotlines in Baker's (and Davison's) run.",1492387200,,417,5.132352941176471

Two Reasons, 1, Both the New Beginnings box set and the separate story is out of print. 2, If I buy it separately, the disc might be defective and I waste 54.00 on an item that doesn't work. So I don't know how I am going to get this, because I really want it.",1469750400,,363,4.126760563380282

7834582,1,630299361X,"Good story, but it looks like there are tons of defective discs still floating around out there, including the one I just ordered from Amazon Warehouse Deals (Aug 2015). The disc itself appears undamaged, but it will not play at all. My computer says there's no disc and the DVD player just sticks on 'loading' forever before eventually spitting it out.

Kudos as always for Amazon's return policy, but it's disappointing to see how after so many years, the defective ones for this episode are still in circulation and being sold.",1438819200,3,530,4.824175824175824
