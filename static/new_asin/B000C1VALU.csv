2451528,5,B000C1VALU,"I really liked this movie. I was surprised that Quentin Tarantino was one of the producers, his stuff seems to have a bit of a bizarre twist, and yet this movie was like ""Disney"" friendly.  The actors were great. It wasn't ""Disney"" predictible.  The plot was good and it flowed along nicely.  The theme of the movie is about relationships. I definitely recommend this movie.

DALTRY CALHOUN

Before I even began watching this film it had two great things going for it, number one would definitely be that Quentin Tarantino Executive Produced this film. The second thing that this film had going for it was that Johnny Knoxville was the lead actor in this film, so naturally I had to have this film. The film its self is from first time writer/director Katrina Holden Bronson and I for one think she did a masterful job with this film. Her Direction and vision for this film was masterful, and film was also extremely well written with vibrant 3 dimensional characters that seem to just stay on your mind long after the film is over.

The story follows Daltry Calhoun as he is kicked out of his aunt's house for being a lazy slacker that sells drugs, all the way to being a successful businessman who own his own company. When he was kicked out of the house he left his girlfriend and daughter behind, which ended up being something he regretted for the rest of his life as he tried to find later when he became successful in the grass seed business. Years later he would get his wish when the two showed up in the town he was staying in and surprised him. It turns out that his ex [May] was dying and wanted Daltry to take care of his daughter June. Daltry though shocked happily took over and started to get to know his girl, but obstacles laid in the way. His company was going down hill, he had a some what of a romantic relationship going on with a storeowner named Flora, and his yard he wanted to turn into a golf course was growing oddly shaped things. So Daltry faced all challenges head on, and eventually conquered each.

If there ever was a performance that Johnny Knoxville deserved an award for it was with this one. His performance in this film only helps to further this mans career into more diverse roles. The scenes he shines in particular in all involve him and Sophie Traub, and Elizabeth Banks. Elizabeth Banks is another who deserves a lot of credit for this film as well, her portrayal of June's mother May is incredible. She shines in moments when she seems the most vulnerable such as the scene with her and Knoxville in bathroom while she is taking a bath, and moments discussing her illness. Juliette Lewis is great as always in her role as Daltry's love interest, and David Koechner is brilliant as Doyle, Daltry's gardener who befriends June. Another stand out performer is Kick Gurry as the man Daltry brings in to help save his business. Gurry really shines during a scene involving him and Sophie in side a barn discussing her being under age. And speaking of which Sophie Traub is amazing in this film and deserves as many awards as possible for role in this film, if their ever was a breakout star she is the one.

Mr. Tarantino made a wise decision by being a part of this film, it is a great coming of age story that I recommend to anybody who loves film or just wants something to watch. Daltry Calhoun is a diamond in the rough of horrible films that are being released; I highly recommend this great film.",1170028800,,3097,4.472566371681416
2451532,5,B000C1VALU,"I've read a lot of reviews that said this was a bad movie.  It wasn't--it was a great movie!  It was nice to see Johnny Knoxville in a role outside of the one we're used to seeing him in in Jackass.  He played a sweet guy.  I like movies with happy endings, and I felt that this was one of those movies.  I'd recommend it to anyone, especially if you're a Johnny Knoxville fan like me!",1167782400,2,385,4.0131578947368425
2451533,4,B000C1VALU,"In tiny Ducktown, Tennessee, Daltry Calhoun's burgeoning sod enterprise is threatening to go bust when the teenaged daughter he abandoned 14 years ago and her mother pop up out of the blue. May, the mother, is terminally ill and wants Daltry to take care of their daughter after she has gone. Now Daltry must try to come to grips with suddenly being a father raising a child he doesn't know, while facing financial ruin.

Katrina Holden Bronson wrote and directed this leisurely-paced slice-of-life dramedy about a man living down his past and his smart, musically-gifted daughter, June. Daltry Calhoun also is about  heartwrenching loss and about hope and a sort of redemption. The film is funny and touching, and tinged with an undertone of bittersweet sadness. Bronson draws out very mature performances from her actors. Knoxville is pretty darn good as Daltry. Nothing of his Jackass persona is seen here, but instead, the viewer is witness to a startlingly layered performance by the erstwhile wildman. All in all, he seems to be rounding out just fine as an actor. Elizabeth Banks (Seabiscuit, Spider-Man series) is beautiful and quietly effective as the dying mother. Juliette Lewis is warm, vulnerable and sweet as the woman who loves Daltry. But young Sophie Traub tops them all. She is an eye-opener and excels in her every scene. The picture's more about her than about her dad, so it's a good thing whoever picked her for the role has either an eye for acting talent, or just got very, very lucky.

I didn't even know this film existed until it was recommended by a friend. Based on how much I enjoyed The Ringer, I decided to give Daltry Calhoun a try. I'm glad I did. Yes, it's a tiny, unprepossessing picture. But it's got heart.

The special features are run-of-the-mill but nice: a film commentary by Director Katrina Holden Bronson and Executive Producer Quentin Tarantino, several deleted scenes with explanatory commentary, some amusing outtakes, and a ""making of"" featurette.",1152835200,5,1996,4.967065868263473
2451534,5,B000C1VALU,"Ignore the critics.  This is not a movie with a fast-paced agenda, but so what.  It is a movie about personal relationships and love.  It is a movie that is unpredictable and filled with things we can all relate to.

June, played by Sophie Traub, is a fourteen-year-old girl who is trying to get a grip on where her life is headed.  Traub is an outstanding actress and steals the show with her amazing performance.

I found the dialogue, acting, and filming to be superb in this movie, so please ignore all of the people who are quick to shoot down this production.

Johnny Knoxville is not the star of this film, and I believe he does a great job in his supporting role.  He plays it as real as it gets, a man who is trying to save his business while trying to connect with his teenage daughter whose life he has not been a part of for fourteen years.

I enjoyed just about everything in this movie, and I believe given a fair chance, you'll enjoy it too.

Give this film a shot.  I think you'll find it a breath of fresh air among the stuffy choices in the DVD world.

See ya next review!",1149033600,7,1090,4.21256038647343
2451535,2,B000C1VALU,"I felt this had a slow-moving plot.  It took a long time to unwind and then had a rapid wrap-up.  Suddenly everything was resolved and the film was over.  I was very disappointed with that.  I was never particularly interested in the storyline either.  I did like the narrative from the girl's perspective and it was...sweet, but overall it was flat and clumsy.  You can find many things better to watch than this.  You will not have missed much by skipping this one.",1146182400,,467,4.554216867469879
2451536,3,B000C1VALU,"This film is listed as a ""dark comedy"", yet there was really nothing funny about it.  The storyline is fairly poor, although Johnny Knoxville comes off as a decent actor.  The movie does have a certain dark aire about it - but I honestly didn't find any aspect of the film to be truly noteworthy.

It may be worth a single viewing, but there's really nothing special about it.",1144368000,2,376,4.420289855072464
2451537,4,B000C1VALU,"This was Johnny Knoxville's 'other' film of last year, pretty much ignored at the box office.  And that is a great shame.  Released in between 'Dukes of Hazzard' and 'The Ringer' this film shows another side to Knoxville as an actor, and probably shows off his acting ability way better than the mugging and pratfalls of the other two movies.

The story follows the malcontent Daltry (played by Knoxville) from rather ignoble beginnings to the founder of a seemingly successful company and hailed as a hero by the town in which he has settled.  Unbeknownst to everyone, Daltry's business is failing (he sells grass - the legal kind!) and his life is complicated even further by the sudden appearance of his ex-girlfriend and their now 14 year old daughter, played brilliantly by newcomer Sophie Traub.  In some ways, the film is formulaic to the nth degree - mom is dying and so wants Daltry to face up to his responsibilty for his daughter and guess what? he does! - but it's also a very engaging, sweet, funny and at times desperately sad film.

Knoxville might surprise people with his performance in this.  Yeah, at times he's still a bit clunky, but 99% of the time he delivers the goods and gives a great performance as Daltry, creating a genuinely likable character, hitting the right balance of awkwardness in his scenes with Traub, but also managing to make a convincing on screen couple with Juliette Lewis, who plays his love interest, Flora.  He does best in some of the film's darker, sadder moments, displaying a vulnerablity that is very touching.  Lewis, an vastly underrated actress in my opinion, really comes into her own in the second half of the movie.

The dvd extras are slight but good value.  The commentary with the writer/director Katrina Holden Bronson, producer Dannielle Renfrew and exec-producer Quentin Tarantino is chatty and fun to listen to.  They also provide a commentary for the deleted scenes.  The bloopers are funny but not hilarious, and the 'making of' is short but sweet - and if nothing else should serve as a lesson to future film makers to not give Johnny Knoxville a golf club and tell him he to create chaos.

This film might not have set the world alight, and I am not sure it ever will, but it's a wonderful film to watch and enjoy.  The characters are a delight, and the plot solid - things which are often lacking in even the most successful of films.  Do yourselves a favour and check this out.",1138838400,7,2448,4.684579439252336

What more could I say?",1395619200,,106,4.35
8095125,1,B000C1VALU,"You were probably drawn to this movie because you're either a fan of Tarantino or Knoxville.  After all, those are the names on the cover.  Based on the cast, you think this is an edgy comedy full of guy humor.  INCORRECT!  I've seen PBS astronomy documentaries with more jokes in them.

This is a coming-of-age wishful fantasy about a 14 year old girl who is an avatar for the writer/director, a woman named Katrina Bronson.  It's full of neither shock nor humor.  On the contrary, the plot, which is as agonizingly brainless as they come, is set up in the first ten minutes.  A girl finds out that her father, who abandoned her and her mother when she was a toddler, is now a rich sod salesman who desperately regrets it and wants them back.  Also, the girl wants to go to Julliard and her mom is dying of cancer.  The sod business is in financial trouble for reasons too stupid to get into.  The remaining 80 minutes are female teenage navel-gazing.

Can this girl get into Julliard, teach a retard to read by giving him flash cards, and look good in a dress if she takes off her glasses and retainer?  Can her dad save his sod business and marry a local lady he's been having a monogamous relationship with for a decade and a half?  Yes, yes, yes, yes.  Obviously.

UNFORGIVABLY BORING!!!!",1365984000,2,1293,4.461538461538462
