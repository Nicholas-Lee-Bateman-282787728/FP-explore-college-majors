8663526,4,B00L33XDXY,"I love the cover, the feel of it and everything! The pictures are great! I miss them so much already. Only disappointment is that, they didn't show the concert day! Such a shame, especially if the fans sang happy birthday to Him Chan. I wanted to see concert action as well, just like their last tour DVD.",1429228800,,305,4.368421052631579
8663527,3,B00L33XDXY,"I love it, but it really killed it for me when they spent almost NO time recording in Texas. Hell, even when they we're IN Texas they were saying they couldn't wait to go to the next place. Ouch. At least we got the footage from the game they went to though, that was cute. However, I REALLY wish they would have done some behind the scenes and performance clips like they did for their first USA tour.",1421539200,,402,4.166666666666667
