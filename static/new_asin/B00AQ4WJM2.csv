5467526,4,B00AQ4WJM2,"I ordered this new set from Tracy Anderson (where it's been out since the fall of 2012) even though I'm not pregnant since I'm just about to start Tracy's Glutecentric Metamorphosis program and wanted something a bit easier before starting the more challenging Metamorphosis set.  Since there are a lot of reviews geared towards pregnant women already and in hopes that my review might help other non-pregnant TAM fans who, like me, also picked this up to add variety to their workouts, I thought I'd offer my thoughts.

On the Metamorphosis Community forum, several people have offered suggestions about how to use this program.  Although the set contains nine workouts and is designed to be used so that you do a different workout for each month of your pregnancy, several forum members recommended spending just two weeks (instead of four) on each workout if you're not pregnant so that you're changing up your workouts more.

A different person suggested doing the workouts in the following order if you're not pregnant:

--first do months 9,8,7
--then months 1,2,3
--then months 4,5,6

The reasoning behind this sequencing is that the first and last trimesters are a bit easier, when pregnant women are experiencing morning sickness (during the first three months) and less overall energy (during the last three months).

The nine workouts range in length from 35 minutes to 57 minutes long:

Month 1 -- 35 minutes
Month 2 -- 38 minutes
Month 3 -- 57 minutes
Month 4 -- 38 minutes
Month 5 -- 40 minutes
Month 6 -- 44 minutes
Month 7 -- 40 minutes
Month 8 -- 45 minutes
Month 9 -- 44 minutes

To do all of them, you'll need a set of two- or three-pound weights (Tracy never wants you to use more than that, and the high-rep nature of her workouts usually won't allow more than that anyways), a chair, and a small towel for some of the stretching.

They are primarily focused on Tracy's muscular structure work (there's no cardio), but my heart rate has still gone up with these workouts.  Most of the leg exercises have about 20 reps per leg, compared to the leg exercises in Glutecentric and Hipcentric, which start off with 40 reps per leg.

Also, in many of Tracy's other workouts, there is no stretching, and this set does have some stretching at the beginning and end of each workout, which is a nice change of pace. She also takes more time to explain many of the moves/exercises, which is very helpful since a lot of her other workouts aren't really cued.

The pacing is also a lot slower than it is in the Mat Workout or in the Glutecentric workouts.

The background music is classical in nature, and gives the workout a more relaxed feel than her other workouts that have techno music.

If you are pregnant, Tracy gives lots of form pointers, and she provides modification suggestions.  There are also clips from Gwyneth Paltrow, Molly Sims, and a female doctor talking about various aspects of pregnancy.

All in all, this is a great set even for those of us who aren't pregnant or planning on becoming so.  At the current price that Amazon is selling it for, it's a great bargain and a great way to try out the Tracy Anderson Method to see if it's for you.",1363132800,19,3171,4.632142857142857
5467527,4,B00AQ4WJM2,"I just got this and am 10 weeks pregnant so I've only done the 3 month workout. I'm pretty fit and used to exercising, and found the leg toning exercises here to be really good. The type of workout that you feel in your butt and thighs the following day.

Pros:
- great exercises to lift and tone your butt
- not a cardio workout, which is hard with pregnancy fatigue
- very nice set and production quality
- comfortable running time (~45 mins)

Cons:
- she doesn't really explain some of the moves, just goes ahead and does them. So I'm not sure if I'm aligning right or lifting where I should be lifting
- this really drives me crazy: workout DVD's where the instructor sticks to their own right and left. So she'll say, ""kick your right foot"", but since she kicks her own right foot you end up either having to kick your left or doing the opposite of what she's doing and then always having to keep in mind that when she says right you go left.
- she does 20 reps of each exercise, and some of them are composed of 2 moves. So it feels like you've been lifting your leg for 5 minutes straight by the time you hit 20. Just feels very slow and drawn out. Would probably work better if she split them up, doing 10 on each side and then repeating.",1363132800,2,1246,4.16597510373444
5467528,5,B00AQ4WJM2,"I ordered this as soon as I found out I was pregnant, in October 2012 and have been following it every other day or every three days depending on my availability and professional schedule. I am pregnant with my first child, am a regular yoga practitioner and needed to continue some form of physical activity adapted to my pregnancy.
I am so happy I found this method! I agree with other reviewers, Tracy's super friendly and encouraging attitude is a pleasure to work out to. I also love the fact she is pregnant while guiding you through the programme and the little interviews featured are a nice nurturing touch to all moms-to-be.

The workouts suit me fine so far (I started in month 2 and am now in month 7). They do give you some balance and very moderate cardio challenge, but are mostly based on 10 to 20 reps of movements performed standing, knelling on ""on-fours"". If you are fit, it is a nice way to stay in shape with pushing yourself. Tracy insists this is not the time to push yourself to become stronger or more flexible, a very important advice to me.

You will need three-pound weights and a yoga mat. I also recommend cushions as the kneeling exercises caused my knees to go black and blue in the beginning (probably an issue with the way I was performing the movements). I love that the DVD changes every month as new muscles are targeted and you do not get bored with the programme - not to mention it adjusts according to the stages of your pregnancy as months go by.

Some month killed me and I was looking forward to finishing them, but I really noticed how the first two to three sessions with a new DVD gradually became easier and my body was really becoming trained. I also thought some (some) of the moves were performed very quickly without much of an explanation on placement (especially one similar to triangle pose in yoga). So unless you have some knowledge of yoga or anatomy, you could easily hurt yourself by pushing too far using the wrong movement.

I found myself sometimes pausing the DVD to catch my breath or slow down a bit. Some of the legs moves I reduced to 16-17 reps. But overall, I am extremely pleased with my purchase and really feel as though I have someone guiding me along the way to maintain an appropriate physical activity. My butt looks better now than it did before I got pregnant and my arm flab disappeared - though I was not overweight before pregnancy. And I love Tracy's attitude, she's such a great support and really brings sunshine into the room with each session! :)

This work out is highly recommended to those of you who are already fit and comfortable working out. I would not recommend it to someone unfit, overweight or not familiar with any form of workout. Be honest with yourself before considering starting this programme. The rest is commitment, consistency and as Tracy says ""all you will do will help us get you back in shape quicker after your baby is born!""

One major warning: as for all video workouts, you really need to be confident about your knowledge of your body and anatomy as well your ability to correctly align and reproduce the moves Tracy is showing you. My ballet and yoga background definitely helped me a lot (I understand what an attitude is, or internal rotations). I would recommend using a mirror to check your form and alignment if you can.

PS: if you are eager to know, I have gained 18 pounds at 7 months, am 5'9 tall and am not restricting my diet whatsoever - only ensuring I choose healthy, ""real"" foods instead of processed meals.",1361318400,19,3542,4.533646322378717
5467529,1,B00AQ4WJM2,"I was hoping to have a more encouraging review written at this point, but unfortunately the customer service team at Tracy Anderson's website have let me down. I ordered the Pregnancy Project dvd series plus weights the better part of two weeks and just today received the weights and a slip telling me the dvd is on backorder. I was quoted a 5-7 day shipping time at the time I placed my order. Unfortunately, the website leaves me little recourse other than an email address for general inquiries. No customer service line, no direct email to customer service. If this is how she runs the shop on her website, I can't say that I hold much hope for her dvd.",1361059200,4,658,4.491666666666666
5467530,3,B00AQ4WJM2,"I loved TA's Post-Pregnancy DVD and felt that it alone flattened my stomach after my first baby. So despite her strange and non-descriptive queueing (not to mention her ultra shady past) I still consider myself a fan.
I am currently 26 weeks along with my second pregnancy and saw TA came out with the Pregnancy Project. I was so excited and paid for the early release on her website. I have only done months 4, 5 and 6 so far but am highly disappointed. The workouts clock in at under 40 minutes each and the only part of me that feels sore after are my wrists from spending so much time on my hands and knees. The 3 workouts I have done are extremely similar, there is a short warm-up which I usually modify because I cannot keep my balance with all the up and down motion, a short arm segment which doesn't challenge me and then we spend the rest of the workout on our hands and knees ""shaping and lifting the butt"". A lot of her moves are dancy and are a bit vague or thrashy for me but I understand that is her style. I also cannot help but mention that it is very distracting to see her constantly adjust the ill-fitting neckline of her outfit and maybe it is because this is my second time around the block but I didn't find the anecdotal pregnancy advice from her celebrity friends interesting or helpful.
I am not afraid to challenge my body or push myself during pregnancy so this DVD set just wasn't for me. I wish she worked our legs and core a bit more. I will continue to do her workouts one day a week or so if I need an easy day. If I am looking for a ""prenatal"" workout though I much prefer my Summer Sander's Prenatal DVD, of course Karyne Steben's Perfect Pregnancy DVD and still love doing Core Fusion Body Sculpt throughout my pregnancy.

**UPDATE: now that I am month further in.
I have to say this DVD is growing on me. I am definitely feeling more challenged than I was a month ago and her month 7 DVD has much less time on the hands and knees. TA has a very different style and personality than I do but I appreciate having her DVD in the mix.",1360800000,8,2068,4.209068010075566
5467531,4,B00AQ4WJM2,"I ordered this from Tracy's website as soon as it came out in October- right after I found out I was expecting. I was a gymnast for ten years and worked out consistently 4-5 times a week leading up to my pregnancy. I was a decently fit person going into this pregnancy and I have a lot of discipline. I wish reviews had been available to me before I purchased the item.

My first trimester was exhausting and I didn't have the energy to exercise much. I came home and went to bed as soon as my four year-old allowed. I started on the Tracy Anderson series right around my 11th week and have been doing it since then and am now 37 weeks. I will amend this as needed.

YOU'LL NEED: a small towel (a hand towel will suffice), two three-pound weights, an exercise mat (should be thick, or your knees might hurt a bit; I use folded blanket to increase the thickness), a chair and some space; I really only need about two or three feet of space surrounding my mat.

You won't use the towel or the chair for all months but be aware that you will need them handy. You will definitely need the three-pound weights and will use them in every month. You don't use more than three-pound weights because you do a high number of reps with each set and you don't want too much blood flow to be diverted from your growing baby. Also, have water available nearby because she times out the moves and the rest periods so your heart rate stays increased but you don't have time to leave your area to get water.

LENGTH: About 40-45 minutes long.

PROGRAM: Five minutes of stretching, 10-15 minutes of arms, then 15 minutes of legs/butt then more stretching. Don't skip the stretching. The arm moves are typically two parts. Her arm moves are different than the ones I usually do and the high amount of reps makes me feel the burn. The butt moves come in 1-3 moves per rep and move your legs and butt at all different angles to really target the butt. I never thought body weight exercises were much worth my time (I'm a leg press type of gal) so I was pleasantly surprised to notice that the exercises were not only challenging but have made a visible difference in toning my butt.

While the exercises seem to directly target your arms and butt, other body parts such as your transverse abdominal muscles (your corset), low back, thighs, calves, and shoulders are hit indirectly with balance shifting and other movements. It is a full body workout, even if you think you're just working out your butt and arms.

Tracy's voice and demeanor are pleasant and ecouraging. SShe smiles and counts enough that you can keep track but not too much so you get annoyed (I hate it when people count for me). She explains why you're doing the exercises and what they achieve.

This is not the only prenatal exercise DVD I own or do; I own the Perfect Prenatal Workout by Karyne Steben, Summer Sanders Prenatal Workout, Suzanne Bowen's Long and Lean Prenatal Workout, 10 Minute Solution: Prenatal Pilates and Yoga Pregnancy: Pre and Postnatal Workouts. I feel all of the DVDs I own are essential to my prenatal exercises and wouldn't own just one, as all of them serve very different purposes.

PROS: lots of body weight exercises, nine DVDs- one for each month, ability to turn off annoying music, different than usual moves, challenging moves, alternative moves given, appropriate for pregnancy stages,

CONS: the bonus features suck, some of her moves are weird (I'm looking at you- month 8), obviously placed products on the coffee table behind her, at times she messes up her counting, she yammers too much in the beginning of some DVDs, some moves aren't very well explained

RESULTS:
increased energy
thinner and more toned arms
a more lifted and round butt
less sore back and hips (I had a low back injury)
my belly looks and feels more supported than in my previous pregnancy by my obliques
I make healthier eating choices
I sleep better at night

In summary, I think The Pregnancy Project is a great video for everyone of all skill levels to use during pregnancy. I wish I had had it during my last pregnancy!",1360540800,214,4086,4.536684782608695
5467532,5,B00AQ4WJM2,"I love Tracy Anderson!  I was doing her Metamorphosis work out prior to getting pregnant!  I was so happy with my results from Metamorphosis I didn't want to let it all go once I found out I was pregnant!  I ordered her Pregnancy Project from her website when I found out I was pregnant with our first child!  I love that she has a DVD for each month as our bodies adjust to pregnancy.  She is very positive and just has a sweet personality!  She explains the moves very well to be sure you do them correctly which I appreciate.  The first couple of months (DVD's) are an hour long, and then when you get to month 4 the work out drops to a little over 30 minutes.  The workout doesn't have any cardio per se, but her workout definitely gets my heart rate up and I feel like I get a great workout!  I do some cardio (stationary Bike) twice a week on the days I don't do the DVD's.  I am in my 2nd trimester and I haven't gained any weight yet!  I also am still wearing all of my pre pregnancy clothes.  I have a ton of energy and never did have any morning sickness!  I also get lots of compliments from my hubby on my booty! :) Tracy's method works so well for me!  Tones me in all the right places without bulking me up!  I also feel very comfortable doing the workouts while pregnant!  I would recommend this work out to any of my pregnant friends!",1358726400,8,1350,4.114942528735632
5467533,5,B00AQ4WJM2,"I was doing metamorphosis when I found out I was pregnant I started this set of DVDs.  The moves are easy and she goes much more slowly than her other DVDs. I am in my second trimester with my first baby and have only gained 7 pounds and I am still in non-maternity clothes. Doing the workout has helped keep my energy up and my joints from hurting.  I can tell if I miss a workout day because my hips start to ache. Buy this now if you want a fit, easy pregnancy and a way to ensure your body will come back faster after delivery.",1357257600,18,531,4.0
5467534,5,B00AQ4WJM2,"I ordered this DVD directly from Tracey Anderson's website in November 2011 so I believe it's the same as this one to be released on Amazon in 2013.
This DVD is brilliant.  I love it.  I am already fit and exercise about 4 times a week with intense cardio, cycling, weights and pilates.  Tracey understands what is appropriate for someone who was fit before pregnancy and wants to continue exercising safely.  There is no cardio per se - it's all strength training, but it does get your heart rate up.

For me this DVD is perfect because I do a special prenatal exercise twice a week (fitball cardio and weights), one pilates class, then I can just do this DVD once a week or when I can't make it to class.

PROS:
* Tracey is kind and encouraging.  She cues the exercises clearly and doesn't talk too much.  It's great that she is actually pregnant in this video.
* The environment that she exercises in is pleasant and you can turn the background music off if you just want Tracey's voice.
* 1 DVD for each month makes sense as your body changes so much each month, as do the rules about what you can and can't do.
* All the exercises feel 'right' to me.  Nothing feels strange or unsafe.  I trust the exercises to be safe in pregnancy.  There is no lying on your back or traditional ab work.
* There are little interviews and extras about common issues in pregnancy which I really enjoyed watching.  You hear from other (famous) mothers and an obstetrician and they all seem to give very good and encouraging advice.
* It really works to help keep your legs, butt, arms, shoulders and upper back strong.  My muscles are (pleasantly) sore the next day.  The exercises work your abs indirectly to help you keep a strong core.
* I find it helps relieve and reduce my lower back tightness and pain.  I enjoy the workout and look forward to doing it at the end of a stressful work day sitting in an office chair all day.

CONS:
* If you're unfit, you might find this a bit tough, but definitely give it a try as it's so important to exercise during pregnancy.
* On the other hand, this DVD alone would probably not be enough exercise for me or for someone who is fit.  I think it works best if you combine it with some other activities, like a class, or some walking/swimming - but then again I'm not usually an exercise DVD person!

Highly recommended!",1356739200,169,2350,4.375576036866359

5467538,4,B00AQ4WJM2,"Overall, I really like these workouts. I was skeptical of how challenging they would be as I was very fit prior to pregnancy, had not tried Tracy Anderson's workouts before and the workouts only use 3lb weights for arm exercises. Boy, was I wrong! These DVDs are a great workout and work muscles that you don't typically use.

One of my favorite parts of these workouts is the stretching that Tracy incorporates. This has been very helpful for me in preventing injury and aching, especially as I'm getting into my third trimester.

Some of the DVDs are a bit longer (45-60 minutes). Although I was very active prior to my pregnancy, I have found it difficult to workout for extended periods of time during my pregnancy, so I prefer the workouts that are closer to 30 minutes long. It's also more difficult to fit in a 60 minute workout in the morning before leaving for work vs a 30 minute workout (especially after a night when you've had trouble sleeping). I've found myself alternating between a couple of the shorter videos and eliminating the longer ones in the set because of this.

Most of the pregnancy DVDs I tried were not challenging enough for me, but The Pregnancy Project has definitely helped to keep me on track. I like to alternate between Tracy Anderson's DVDs and Joy Southworth's Body By Trimester DVDs (this set is a bit more challenging, works up more of a sweat and incorporates more weights).",1511136000,,1416,4.678714859437751

My gripes -
1. Too much over extension of back, which in all other videos and instructors tell you to stay away from. There's already so much pressure in that area, even in early pregnancy with the increased relaxin. I just didn't feel safe doing these moves. I was afraid of injuring my back.
2. Weird ""comfy living room"" atmosphere.
3 Music is strange.

There's other pregnancy videos I love so much more - Suzanne Bowen's Slim & Toned and Barre Method Pregnancy Video. Oh and Blooma's yoga series.",1487289600,2,589,4.547169811320755
5467549,4,B00AQ4WJM2,"I've done Tracy Anderson workouts before, so I'm used to her ""method."" I didn't know about this video during my last pregnancy, so I only did her post-pregnancy workouts (which were very helpful). I'm currently 15 weeks and have been doing these workouts since month 2. Several of my friends have also done this workout and have shared their opinions with me. Thoughts thus far:

- If you're used to cardio-based workouts and are extremely/moderately fit going into pregnancy, these workouts will seem boring and fairly easy to you. If I was feeling good, I would do the video AND a cardio workout. However, as Tracy mentions in the videos, the goal is to keep your muscles toned and moving during pregnancy without taking away from the baby. You have time to get in great shape and fit after pregnancy but the goal during pregnancy is to stay healthy and active for you AND your little one.
- There is only one DVD per month of pregnancy. If you are used to having variety in your workouts, this will seem VERY boring to you. Some days I searched Youtube for pregnancy workouts or went on long walks because I needed more variety. The DVD's also range from an hour to a half hour. The hour workouts can definitely get boring after doing them every day.
- HOWEVER, the workouts are very effective if done correctly. A lot of Tracy's arm and leg movements are very specific and if you don't hit the move precisely, you won't feel the exercise as much. If it doesn't feel a little challenging, you're probably not doing it right. She does a great job explaining the movements and angles you're supposed to hit. But again, I have done her workouts before and have experience with her movements.

Overall, this may not be the most exciting workout, but I think it's great for pregnancy. My goal is not to set any records or be in the greatest shape of my life. My goal is to provide the best for my baby and to feel good and healthy during my pregnancy. I think this video is the perfect combination of caution during pregnancy while still providing the challenge your body needs.",1483574400,8,2076,4.548128342245989

5467556,3,B00AQ4WJM2,"This DVD will delight fans of Tracy Anderson, but if you don't have an appetite for her incredibly repetitive small movement style, this will bore you to tears. Even with different discs for each month I couldn't make myself do any disc more than once.

She provides limited advice on proper form and her movements can be too fast and sloppy to keep more injury prone people safe. I give this a soliid B-, good for a rainy day but definitely not for every day. I thought it was interesting that her clients shown in the tutorials don't look particularly fit,  just thin. That's diet, not exercise, sorry.",1475452800,2,604,4.583333333333333

I was fit before pregnancy; I get more of a workout sitting on the couch than this workout.  I think the movements are made up, I have no idea what muscle groups she is trying to work out. Not that this impacts the workout, but she is wearing a black unitard with her chest falling out and she has on platform sneakers.  That alone should tell you this isn't a workout. You are better off walking and looking up workouts on YouTube and Pinterest for each trimester.",1471737600,3,562,4.375

5467565,5,B00AQ4WJM2,Excellent exercise video for pregnancy. I love that it breaks down the workouts by month. I wanted to stay as active as possible during pregnancy and doing these workouts a few times a week helped!,1468886400,,197,4.6571428571428575
5467566,5,B00AQ4WJM2,"Background : I'm a shade under 5'6"", 143 pounds, 36 years old and 17 weeks pregnant with my first baby.  I'm a runner and yoga instructor, but my first trimester left me so sick I couldn't work out.  I didn't start the videos until now.

PROS :
-I love that it goes month by month.
-I love that you can turn the music off and JUST listen to Tracy.
-I LOVE that Tracy is also pregnant, and you can tell that she's breathing harder than she does in her non-prenatal videos.  This makes me feel better!  It makes me think, ""Oh, good!  If she's breathing hard too, then I'm okay!""
-I normally don't watch DVD ""extras"" (I mainly just stick to the workouts), but this has some really good, short (that's key for me!) little blurbs.

CONS:
-It's hard!  (But isn't that why I bought a TA video in the first place?  Yup.)
-Some other review (from a PT) said some of these exercises shouldn't be done by pregnant women.  I guess I'm going into this as a yoga instructor, and I'm really aware of alignment, so that doesn't bug me.  For some people though, that might be good advice.",1467763200,2,1071,4.305
5467567,5,B00AQ4WJM2,"side note: i'm writing on my husband's prime account, but i did want to share my thoughts on TA preg video's anyways. I'm a devoted exercise enthusiast, i do it all HIIT, spinning, running, barre = all of it. I'm now pregnant with my second child and i've been doing tracy's method after a few weeks of post birth with my first child, doing the post preg first video (which BTW- is incredible and that plus regular all routine's above, literally got me in the best shape of my 33 yrs on this earth at 120 lbs and 5'6, i was super lean and totally ripped until i got pregs again). I am a HUGE tracy fan and this video along with other forms of cardio (i'm talking anything you are possibly up for: swimming, running etc) WILL keep you in top notch shape as long as you don't completly eat your face off (i do not diet either btw). I'm on my 6th preggomonth now, have only gained 12lbs and do these video's if not every day, every other one interchangeably with other forms of cardio. i whole heartedly recommend her videos and think any exercise fanatic should include her method into their routine. It's very different than anything else and sculpts you lean and toned. Buy this now and all her others- you'll get over feeling stupid and hating her, then out of nowhere after a few weeks once you start seeing the results you'll instantly become part of her cult....TRUST ME!!!!!!!!",1467590400,5,1382,4.44488188976378

It actually relaxed me and my body felt amazing after each workout. As someone that was once overweight (200 lbs in high school) I was so worried about weight gain during pregnancy. With these videos, walking, swimming, and healthy eating I only gained 15 lbs during my pregnancy and stayed very close to my goal weight.",1467244800,2,484,4.773809523809524

I felt like I still needed to be challenged while staying safe being pregnant. This workout is great has all 9 DVDS for each trimester but you can use them for any trimester since it's so safe.

Her form is terrible, the reps are too high, the count is too fast without any break, and she constantly works out the same muscles over and over while completely ignoring other muscles. As someone who works out almost daily still at 32 weeks and still lifts at the gym and is in good shape- this is by far the worst pregnancy dvd I've tried to date.",1463184000,4,454,4.416666666666667

Each month is tailored to fit the needs of you and your growing baby inside. Tracy provides workouts that are great for someone who wants to continue to be active during pregnancy, but is unable to do normal activities like pre-pregnancy such as biking and rollerblading.  The workouts are easy for someone who is not a fitness guru.  Tracy is easy to follow along to.  It also is great that she was on the journey right along with me during my workouts.  When I was doing the 5 month pregnancy workout videos, Tracy also was 5 months pregnant.  This made the workouts realistic for the season of pregnancy I was in.

This is by far the worst purchase I've ever made in terms of a workout DVD. I am 100% convinced that Tracy is making up moves as she goes along with a complete lack of proper form  throughout the exercises. There are points in the video when her face itself seems very confused throughout the workouts.  The video is poor quality, the shots and angles make it extremely difficult to ensure your form is even close to being proper and overall the video is poor. I literally just chucked it in the trashcan  10 minutes prior to writing this review.

This Tracy Anderson DVD is easy to follow. You really only need a yoga mat and some light weights which I already had and if you don't, you can do without. There are 9 DVDs, one for every month so you can alter your moves and do different exercises with your growing body.

I am 5 months pregnant and did months 3 & 4 knowing that I knew how to modify if they were too difficult and I think Tracy is overly cautious and planned these DVDs for people either new to exercise or maybe people who focus on cardio alone and are new to any type of barre, Pilates or strength training. This is much easier than your standard Barre class!

The DVDs from what I can tell could be merged into 3 (one for each trimester) and just be longer workouts. Each one ranges from 25-30 minutes of work and I barely broke a sweat doing one so I decided to do half of another, but they were so similar that I felt bored.",1451952000,,674,4.106060606060606

5467623,5,B00AQ4WJM2,I love this video set because it tailors to each month of your pregnancy and it is very doable. I attempted to do the workout 3 times a week but towards the end of my pregnancy only made it about once a week. I would always feel much more energetic and flexible throughout the week when I did this workout. I especially like how it is a new video each month to target specific needs and make it feel new again.,1436659200,,410,4.074074074074074
5467624,4,B00AQ4WJM2,"This DVD set is no joke. I was someone that ran 5 days a week and often did beach body work outs prior to pregnancy. Since this is a DVD you change monthly I was very surprised to see how challenging it was in the later months. I just started month 9 yesterday and even that DVD pushes you to the limit. If you aren't someone that exercised prior to pregnancy and enjoys pushing yourself, steer clear. You could always do modifications or less reps, but you really lose the point of the work out. If you want a challenge get the set!",1436486400,3,533,4.184466019417476

I was all about getting fun new pregnancy stuff so I ordered this, but it just wasn't for me.

5467627,3,B00AQ4WJM2,"I've had this workout on my wish list since finding out I was pregnant. 9 workouts for the price is pretty amazing, and I love the idea of a workout specifically designed for each month. I used months 1-3 twice each during my first trimester, and previewed the rest of the months before deciding not to continue.

PROS:

- Tracy is very pleasant to workout with. She has a calm, encouraging demeanor that's helpful when you're not in the mood to exercise.
- The set is pretty and soothing, designed to look like a living room or nursery depending on the month.
- The movements are dance-based, focusing on engaging smaller muscle groups and retaining control over each movement.
- 9 workouts for $20 on amazon. Pretty amazing deal.

CONS:
- She consistently uses poor form when executing certain movements. She frequently arches her back when doing work on all fours (bad if you're not pregnant, terrible if you are).
-  Pace is too fast to be safe. She emphasizes high reps, but performs them at a rapid pace that might be causing the issues with form (lots of all fours attitudes and kick backs performed quickly with an arched back and a ""jerk"" like move at the end of extension would be painful if imitated exactly).
- Clothing gets in the way of seeing the precise movements at times. She wears all dark clothes, but sometimes the bottoms are too loose to see if she's fully extending through her knees. The sneakers, though super cute, make it difficult to see when she's fulling pointing or flexing a foot.
- In the first trimester there's a lot of work that requires balancing on your side/hip, with limited options for modification that don't full sacrifice the range of motion. This can be painful, even with a thick pilates mat, if you don't have a lot of padding on your hip bones.
- Some of the upper body work involves sitting on your knees, bending down to the floor and back up. This can be terribly uncomfortable if you're working through nausea or dizziness, and there's no clear reason given for why you need to perform these tricep exercises with this motion.
- Later trimesters rely on a lot a kneeling leg work. Obviously this is an attempt to make room for the bump, but she demonstrates poor posture (spine arched/sagging down instead of in neutral) which means you aren't safely strengthening that lower back and possibly putting strain on it.
- Some of those moves in the later trimesters might become dangerous if you're not experienced with exercise/dance and know that you need to maintain a completely different posture from the one she's modeling.
- Doesn't offer modifications for every exercise. Some are provided for standing exercises, but most done on the hands and knees have no alternatives offered.
- A number of the exercises are needlessly complex, and her rationalization for the complexity doesn't always make sense.

CONCLUSION:

The exercises are based on ballet/dance floor barre exercises, so they're nothing new. They're probably very effective, but I would recommend researching posture/form for different types of barre or pilates exercises to make sure you don't injure yourself. If you're an experienced exerciser and pay attention to form, this is a pretty good bargain that it can't hurt to try. Just pay attention to where you might need to modify, and listen to your body (which she will remind you to do).",1435190400,2,3362,4.787931034482758

So now hats fixed this was perfect.  I just started feeling good enough to work out.  Normally you get past morning sickness and start to get more energy, not me.  Just now getting that way.

5467658,1,B00AQ4WJM2,"I have been using at-home exercise videos since Jane Fonda, and I am a certified Yoga instructor, who has been teaching for over ten years.  This is the worst exercise video I have ever purchased.  Not only is it poorly designed, it is irresponsible.  Though it may not pose a risk for your pregnancy, there are other concerns.  I am a fit 37-year-old in the third month of her pregnancy.  For the first two months, I stayed in shape by walking, doing light strength training and pre-natal Yoga.  I purchased Tracy's DVD at the beginning of my third month.  Though I had never tried one of her exercise programs before, I was honestly lured in by her list of celebrity clientele.  The third-month DVD is 56 minutes long, over 40 minutes of the DVD are on your knees.  The first time I tried the DVD, my knees hurt (in a bad way) for three days afterwards, and I have no existing knee problems.  I went out and bought a 1-inch mat and knee pads, to try the DVD again: still, my knees were taxed.  Further, she has you do over 100 reps (on each side) of something that she calls ""attitudes.""  The movement begins on all fours, and then you slightly turn your hip outward as you lift the corresponding leg up and to slight diagonal to the opposite side.  She mentions nothing of proper alignment.  Even with proper alignment, this many repetitions of such a movement poses risks to your lower back.  And, again, with no pre-existing back problems, my lower back was in pain for two days after the second attempt to do this video.  Perhaps, if you are 22, 5'2"" and 110 pounds, this video may not pose a problem for you.  But, as a fist 37-year-old at 5'7"", I would never, ever recommend this video to anybody.  There are many better options out there that do not pose risk for two of the body's most high-risk areas: your knees and lower back.",1423872000,20,1839,4.4226190476190474

5467660,4,B00AQ4WJM2,"This review is long overdue as I'm now doing round two during my second pregnancy. There are things that I really like about these videos and other things I really don't like, but it kept me in good shape throughout my pregnancy so the 4 stars is on the workout itself. I really like that it changes monthly, that I that I don't need much space, and that it is challenging in a good way. I feel like it does work. Now for the dislikes: first, Tracy won't shut up! She should really do one without her voice and directions because having her stop to give direction every time drives me nuts makes it really drag on. I just want to turn it on and bang it out. Then, she goes SO slow. Once I get the hang of each video I literally do it on fast forward and just look at the screen to reference what the next move is. One Tracy rep takes forever, then on top of it she stops to explain. So all in all I would recommend this workout and think it does work (maybe a little too well since I think it gave me stretch marks on my hips from my butt toning so quickly) and I'd also recommend Tracy do a no voice, to the point version. That would make it 5 stars.",1423612800,,1151,4.008695652173913

This doesn't feel really safe, like some of the moves are throwing your body out of whack. There isn't any attention to good form. Since I know a little bit about lifting and have done other workouts, I feel like I can modify the moves to feel safer for my body.

I love that each month has a new workout that caters to the size of your bump as well as the typical energy levels during that time. She takes it slower in the first few months when you feel exhausted and nauseous. But don't think for a second that this set is going to be easy! Tracy pushes you through the whole 40 weeks - I'm on the last disc and expected it to focus on stretching and breathing to prepare for labor (wishful thinking). Nope, I sweat more than I did last month! But it's never too much, and she always encourages you to do only what your body is telling you is ok.
~What you need: 3 pound weights are used each month, and a chair is used most months. You will also spend ALOT of time on your knees so have a very thick mat! I have hard wood floors so my mat felt paper thin after a few minutes. I needed to put a towel under my knees, and they still hurt. So now I moved to a bedroom with soft carpet :)
~Also, it's worth noting that this is not a cardio set. You will sweat (but then again you are pregnant, so you probably sweat grocery shopping) but don't expect to use this set to ""get in shape."" Her goal is to prepare you for labor/delivery and keep your muscles toned so you can get them back easier after delivery! I used this set a few times a week when I had the time/energy, and I walk at least 30 min every day. I still gained 40 pounds so far.

5467694,4,B00AQ4WJM2,"I see what everyone's saying. She doesn't really explain the movements. So at times, you'll find yourself catching up by trying to replicate her movements. Also, I wish she would say little reminders to help my form. Ie: would be nice if she said things like 'don't forget to breathe.' Or 'make sure that your body doesn't twist too much here and focus on making your spine aligned' etc. Just because I think your body tries to overcompensate to help your balance, ESP with a new center of gravity with your belly, and it would be helpful to have those little reminders, since you're focused on catching up on the movements...

That being said, it's nice that she's pregnant too, and you feel connected that she is doing the movements with you. When I go to other fitness classes, I wonder if the instructors know what it's like to be pregnant and/or question if a particular movement is ok for the baby. So since she is pregnant in the videos, makes me feel better.",1418169600,,966,4.551724137931035
5467695,2,B00AQ4WJM2,"I purchased this based on the good reviews and ignored the bad ones.  That was a mistake.  I considered myself in relatively good shape prior to pregnancy and I was looking for something to keep me in good shape throughout my pregnancy.  While there is a heart rate increase the movements are awkward, very repetitive, the camera angles make it difficult to tell how she is doing them, and her form seems very sloppy and a majority of the time you are on your knees.  I had to put layers of mats down just to make it through the whole workout.  It caused significant lower back pain and hip pain for me.  I would recommend being very cautious if trying to do these everyday, I feel it really contributed to the problems I'm now having to see a physical therapist for.  The reason I gave it 2 stars instead of one is 1. the arm exercises work different muscles then  a majority of workout dvds out there 2. Tracy seems as frustrated and awkward as me doing these exercises.",1417996800,5,972,4.391061452513966

I was looking for something to transition from my regular workouts to a lower intensity regime, and I thought this would be great! However, I did not like this video series at all.

She doesn't properly explain how to do the moves, she rushes through a lot of it and doesn't use proper form (as far as I'm concerned). The dialogue is awkward and doesn't not encourage participation or enthusiasm. Tried them twice then shelved them. Haven't touched them since.

5467725,3,B00AQ4WJM2,"So far I've only done the first two DVDs but already I am finding them to be sort of frustrating. The first month I was able to do fine but the second month has the most awkward moves (especially using the chair) so I don't really know what to expect for the rest of this series. Some of the chair moves were so strange to do and actually felt really uncomfortable on my knees so I would definitely not do these workouts if you already have knee problems.
Not only are some of her moves confusing, but she takes no breaks whatsoever. She doesn't stop to let you breathe or even to stretch in between moves, which I find rather annoying.
I have done many, many, MANY workout DVDs and this, by far, is the hardest to follow. She doesn't always set you up for the moves but instead just goes immediately into them so when you watch it the first time, you may get completely lost and need to catch up often.
Additionally, as some others have mentioned, she doesn't always keep a consistent count and sometimes she doesn't even remember what exercise she is doing! This is a problem for me because then it creates an imbalance since one side of your body is getting a slightly different workout than the other.
I still plan on getting through the entire series but I cannot say that I would recommend this set to pregnant ladies. I'd rather stick to a yoga DVD or even just go swimming.
Also, I haven't bothered to watch any of the other extras. As soon as I saw Gwyneth Paltrow's mug in the first DVD, I turned it off knew never to watch those again!",1415836800,2,1546,4.316151202749141
5467726,5,B00AQ4WJM2,"Your review and experience of this product are all going to depend on what you are looking for. Do not expect to pick this up in month 5 and use it for a few months and be totally fine. Also if you are not really someone who did much with workouts when you were not pregnant, I am not sure how this DVD or any workout no less is going to help you.

My wife works out pretty regularly. I would say 4-5 times a week. She does T25 and Insanity ( pre-pregnancy ) So when we purchased these dvd's we had no idea what to expect.

The box comes with all 9 DVD's in there and they are all labeled for each month. My wife added little 3 pound weights just to help advance it a little bit, but go at your own discretion.

If you are not a workout person, or someone who did the video previous than maybe just go walk around the park. My wife was used to these type of videos because she worked out with the Shaun T line of products already.

I am doing this on laminate floors but have a thick yoga mat (at least 7mm/.25 inches) where I do the workout on. I rolled up my mat so that it's 3x as thick and it was still very painful.

(Her workouts seem to be like jerky dance moves). Secondly, while pregnant, I can not do, nor feel like its appropriate to be doing fast jerky movements. Slow, stretchy, but strengthening movements are more appropriate and comfortable for a growing mother.

Lastly, though I almost resent the extras that include celebrity advice on motherhood. Someone who makes that much money and is that out of touch with reality shouldn't be giving advice on how easy/hard it is to be a mother.",1412380800,,682,4.73109243697479

I loved that Tracy was pregnant during the series and grew as you grew so she could totally identify with all the different aches and pains. And I trusted that she wasn't putting me or my baby through any strenuous exercises which was NOT the case with other ""prenatal"" workout DVDs. I also loved starting a new DVD each month. Not only was it fun to mix up the workouts from month to month, but every time I reached a new DVD, it was a milestone in my pregnancy! She really does cater to your growing belly and all the stretching and arm/leg workouts end up feeling really good...and they work! My butt was still smallish and rock-soild at 40 weeks. A couple of small negatives...in the month 3 and 4 DVDs Tracy doesn't count the reps (I skipped 1 and 2 but the same may be true for those). I HATED being down on the floor, lifting my leg for what felt like hours and not knowing how many reps I had left. But she counts off more in month 4 and even more the rest of the time so if it bugs you too, stick with it! The stretching she does at the beginning of the DVD is great but she doesn't end with much. Just some arm swinging that didn't make sense to me. I started doing my own stretching after which I think helped. But the positives far outweigh the negatives!",1407456000,5,1403,4.142857142857143

I didn't end up using them more than a few times a month because I didn't feel that they got my heart rate up at all, and because you are not lifting more than 3 lbs weights, I didn't feel that the video was a good strength training workout either.  However, I would recommend these videos to someone who is totally exhausted by pregnancy, because it is a good workout for days when you don't feel like moving (it's not strenuous!).  Also, I would recommend these videos to someone who wants to have a shapelier bottom, because half of each video focuses on ""lifting the butt, or keeping the butt lifted.""",1402531200,4,798,4.482758620689655

5467801,4,B00AQ4WJM2,"I've only done months two and three of the workout but they are great for when you're exhausted and don't feel well. Pre-pregnancy I ran long distances, used Jillian Michaels DVDs. I ran a half marathon 6 weeks pregnant. So I was a searching for something to keep working out throughout my pregnancy but I knew I'd be unable to maintain my previous workouts. My opinion thus far - these are tough! I definitely feel like I'm working out even it high I'm not lifting heavy weights or running. I'll continue to update as I get further into the program. I love that the economy month workout was only 35 min perfect because I was so tired and sick that was about all I could handle! The third month is about 55 min and ALOT of butt/ thigh work. I personally would like a little more arm work but I just do push ups and planks on other days. Tracy is very soft spoken ( as I said earlier I'm a huge Jillian Michaels fan) so it was a bit to get used to I like it but it took a work out or two to adjust. She is terrible at cues! Great at explaining the next move, but then will say ok we're doing 20 and crickets..... Nothing is said sometimes she even changes sides and if you're not watching you could I miss it. She's better in the month 3 DVD but it's still OK 20 reps this side, quiet....... Then maybe you'll hear her say OK other side 20, and again quiet.......

Update: I've worked out with 4th month DVD the queuing seems to have improved, or I've gotten used to Tracy's queues. I really like that the workouts change every month I don't have time to get bored with the workout, I mix up my workouts with running, body by trimester and Tracy so I only do this DVD once, maybe twice a week. Month 4 focuses a lot on the booty and keeping it high and tight which is great!  The workout is just over 30 min, so very easy to fit in even when tired. I routinely get compliments that people can't tell I'm pregnant except for my bump. I'm only 5' tall so I was afraid I'd balloon. Working out consistently has helped keep me healthy and fit.",1401494400,2,2039,4.159493670886076
5467802,4,B00AQ4WJM2,Excellent!! Was sore after... not to bad but defiantly broke a little sweat! Wish I had this from day one I found out I was preggers!! But I'm planning on using it after the baby until I can do more intense workouts!,1401321600,,216,4.166666666666667
5467803,5,B00AQ4WJM2,"I think this set of DVD's is the perfect pregnancy workout. Now, I haven't been doing it as often as I should, but every time I do, I think that there is no reason for me not to do it more often. It makes you feel like you had a good workout, but aren't overly exhausted afterwards. She is very motivating without being annoying. I don' tike the music that plays, but you have the option of watching with just Tracy's voice and no music.",1401148800,5,437,4.152941176470589
5467804,5,B00AQ4WJM2,"Pros:
1. 30-35-minute workout for each month of pregnancy on 9 discs.  This makes it easy to fit in an AM workout at home, especially on days you cannot imagine heading out to the gym.

2. Easy to do at home, even in an apartment living room with limited space.  Basically, you can do the workouts within the area of a standard yoga mat.

3. Simple equipment-- yoga mat, chair, 2-3 lb dumbbells. (If you were not strong on weights before, I recommend doing 2 lb instead of the 3 lb recommended because you do a number of reps and 2 lb made me feel the burn without straining).

4. Easy-to-follow workouts overall.

5. Option to turn off background music and just hear her voice.  (I highly recommend this option. You will get bored of the music if you do these workouts a few times a week.  I put on my own workout mix in the background to stay motivated.)

6. 2-part workout format of arm series then leg series.  I found it helpful to even squeeze in at least 1 series (about 12-15 min.) on a particularly busy day.

7.  If you do all the reps and watch your form you will definitely feel your muscles being worked.  I have been doing the workouts 2-3 times a week for about 3 months now (2nd half of 1st trimester and now part way through my 2nd) and do feel that it is keeping the non-bump areas of my body toned and strong.  Actually, I expect to mix in these workouts even later post-pregnancy.  Aside from excluding direct ab work, they would be challenging enough for a general gym-goer.

Cons:
1. 9 separate discs-- would be nice to have fewer and just select the month workout to play.
2. Product placement/promos throughout the series, though at least they are separate DVD chapters so you are not forced to watch them every time you put on the DVD.
3. Not a lot of variety.  For instance, for the early months, you do arm series (mix of different ways to move arms with dumbells) which is good; however, all the leg series is done from a down-on-all-fours position.  However, this is a workout you will feel and is part of a whole pre-natal workout routine, not a stand-alone.
4. Minimal warm-ups and stretching.  The workouts include some of this, but if you are doing these in the morning I recommend doing your own warm-up first and extra stretching after.",1401148800,2,2271,4.415865384615385
5467805,5,B00AQ4WJM2,"I love the Pregnancy Project.  Tracy is encouraging, but not annoying, and she's realistic.  She even tells you that if you're not feeling great and you don't get your workout in that day, that's ok.  The workouts are great.  I'm slightly sore the next day, but in a good way.  She's pregnant herself in the video, so she really does know what your limitations are as a pregnant woman, such as balance, being able to bend a certain way, etc.  I bought several pregnancy workout videos, and this was the only one I really needed.

I was a runner before pregnancy, so I consider myself to be in shape, but these DVD's do an excellent job of targeting muscles I wasn't toning while running. I highly recommend these DVD's to anyone who wants to stay in shape during pregnancy.

5467822,1,B00AQ4WJM2,"To be fair...I didn't purchase this set until my 6th month of pregnancy so that's the only video I've tried. Therefore, it would only be fair to rate that one. Starts off with a brief stretch, not very thorough. Then you start on arms. There seemed to be no technique involved. The person on the video was just kind of swinging her arms around. She didn't mention which muscles were being utilized, stretched, or worked and her movements didn't seem controlled. She suggested 3 lb weights so I tried 5's to see if I could get a better workout but I didn't feel like i was accomplishing much. After, is a leg routine, no weights involved. She's a little more descriptive here but no work to quads or calves. It was primarily for stretching the hip flexors. Good for childbirth. She used a lot of dance terminology to describe movement. I had to remember high school dance team terms. All in all, this video seems ok if you're not used to working out and just want to get moving. Otherwise, it doesn't seem too beneficial.",1399507200,3,1020,4.518918918918919

5467864,5,B00AQ4WJM2,"I bought two DVD's that were highly recommended by the Amazon reviewers: The Perfect Pregnancy Workout Vol 1 Sculpting & Tracy Anderson, The Pregnancy Project

The Perfect Pregnancy Workout - Vol 1
Love this DVD! I was in a modern dance company before getting pregnant so I was already fit.  However, I was told to take it easy and not over do it.  So on this hiatus I really craved a pregnancy workout that wouldn't over exert me but would give me the same energy I was used to before.  I started this workout at 5 months and found which parts I could do at the beginner level and advanced level (or even combining the two to make an intermediate level).

Pros:
-Multi levels shown at the same time or alternating so you can choose on the spot what works best for you
-You can watch the instruction section before starting the workout so you know the proper form of each move
-Warm up and cool down included
-Kegel exercises are thrown in intermittently which is a huge benefit for labor prep
-Great pace; the flow between each workout is smooth without being too fast but still keeps you warmed up and moving
-Inspiring! The DVD is taught by a Cirque du Soliel trapeze artist, so seeing her very pregnant, fit, and sculpted is a great motivator

Cons: (It's hard to say what I don't like about this DVD because it works really well for me, so I'm going to try and be nit picky)
-You're not sure how pregnant she is so it's hard to tell how far into your pregnancy you can do this workout without it being too much.  So you'll have to gauge that yourself.
-Warm up is a little short but that might be a personal preference because I'm used to longer stretching periods

And that's it.  I honestly love this DVD!

Tracy Anderson: The Pregnancy Project
Perfect for all levels! I started this DVD at 4 1/2 months and loved it.  Tracy is great at motivating and keeping you focused. The level of difficulty IMO is between beginner and intermediate.  And because of that you still get a good workout without over exerting yourself. I would say that this DVD is designed more for anyone who wants to workout, whether you were fit or not before pregnancy.

Pros:
-A special workout for each month of your pregnancy.  MAJOR plus.  Since you experience something different with each trimester this helps so much in keeping you fit during each stage.
-Each month comes with interviews from people who have used Tracy's workout, so you get an insight into how they benefited and get some inspiration in the process.
-Warm up and cool down included
-Great pace and she talks you through everything
-You workout your whole body with easy to follow movements.  You don't know you're working out your abs until you're sore the next day :D
-You can choose to play the DVD with or without her music.  So if you don't like her music choices you can play your own and still hear the instructions

Cons:
-There isn't an instructional section that you can look at before starting the workout so you learn as you go, but it's hard to check your form while doing the workout

Hope these reviews help!",1398643200,2,3078,4.493716337522442
5467865,4,B00AQ4WJM2,"When you get the DVD set, look closely at your discs.  When I received mine, I counted to make sure I had all nine...fine.  I got to month five of my pregnancy and went to get the new disc and saw that I didn't have month 5.  I had two month 7s.  Too late to complain now, too late to exchange.  The workouts are good though.  Enjoy!",1398211200,,333,3.8955223880597014
5467866,5,B00AQ4WJM2,"I love Tracy.  I used her Metamorphosis series to get in shape for my wedding a few years ago so I knew I'd get results with her.  Anyway, during my first pregnancy I was so scared to do too much so I walked every morning and swam a little tiny bit.  My body ballooned up anyway and once I was able to lose that weight my butt and abs were just not the same-so flabby!  Going into my second pregnancy (almost 5 months now!) I knew I needed some extra help so I purchased this set.  First of all, I think the price is great for what you get (9 months of workouts) and I just can't say enough about how much I love her program so far.  I was a little hesitant to purchase it at first because of some of the negative reviews (bad music, ""unsafe"" exercises) but I'm so glad I didn't listen!  I'll be honest, I haven't been really consistent with my workouts but from what I've done I've noticed a HUGE difference in my body-and so has everyone else!  I'm almost to the month 5 DVD and so far the workouts have been challenging but nothing scary at all.  Tracy stresses again and again to listen to your body and if it feels uncomfortable don't do it.
Anyone who's used a Tracy DVD before knows her music is probably going to be bad (which it is) but you have the option of working out to just her voice OR voice and music.  I opt for her voice only and use my own music.  Also, I think this series is much more guided than any other Tracy workout I've used in the past-she really explains the movements and COUNTS thank goodness!  I'd highly recommend this series and will definitely use Tracy's post pregnancy DVD to help get back in shape after baby #2 arrives.  5 stars!!!",1398211200,4,1671,4.184375
5467867,4,B00AQ4WJM2,"I regularly worked out prior to my pregnancy and I was looking for a workout that was safe for the baby but at the same time something that felt like I was working out. I tried other workout DVDs and they were too easy for me.. Tracy Anderson's Pregnancy Project is the only one that leaves me satisfied post-workout. She really challenges you throughout and you really feel like you're getting the best out of your workout. I do warn any potential buyers that this might not be the DVD for you if you're not used to working out or if you're not used to challenging workouts. Tracy really pushes you and you're body's probably going to feel sore after. It also really helps that she herself is pregnant throughout the whole series. If you're used to working out and are looking for something that will challenge you but at the same time be safe for your little one, then I completely recommend the Pregnancy Project",1397952000,3,915,4.518072289156627

5467869,2,B00AQ4WJM2,"This is a very slow-paced workout video and would be great for someone who has no experience working out and would like to ease into fitness during their pregnancy. However, this is something I would consider doing on ""Rest Day"". My intention isn't to brag about my fitness level, but it needs to be known to women who are looking for a really good workout during their pregnancy, and have been working out leading up to it that this program just doesn't deliver.

I immediately noticed she was wearing high-heeled sneakers during the workout, and this made me feel like I couldn't take the workout seriously. At the same time I ordered this fitness regimen, I also ordered Linday Brin's Complete Pregnancy DVD(s). While it's a bit ""corny"" and the use of the term ""buncakes"" in reference to your butt feels a bit juvenile, at least you get a workout with that program. I was able to sweat, and there are variations for days when you are just exhausted, and days when you feel great!

For some reason, Tracy' series is very different from all the rest: while before I struggled with the thought of doing my daily fitness routine, went on procrastinating till late evening and eventually just got too sleepy and gave up, this one, which I started towards the end of Month 3, has been motivating enough for me to actually start doing it first thing every single morning. I think what sets it aside is the fact that there is a different routine for every month - it's less boring, and also gives you a nice feeling of going through a well-structured journey with clear milestones. For me it's also just the right level physically, if done daily - challenging enough to actually tone my muscles and give me some sense of achievement, but not so tough that I would dread starting it every time.

I'm now looking forward to doing the post-natal DVD.

Upd. I continued doing this DVD all the way up to the day of delivery and can add now that i had a very easy and quick experience this time (less than 2 hours for the whole thing, completely unmedicated), and my body is in quite good shape for a 39yr old who just had her 2nd child.

Let me tell you, go ahead and skip over any review written by somebody who wasn't pregnant when they did this or any other pregnancy workout, they have no clue what they're talking about.

That being said...

I love this series!  I'm writing this now b/c my workout yesterday was the only thing that kept me going all day - it was like taking a power nap...I'm 26 months pregnant and was extremely fit prior to pregnancy and these workouts are awesome - I don't ever feel sore or tight from them but I do feel them working.

You have to get over Traci as she isn't really entertaining at all but that's ok! she's pregnant as well and going through all the things you are which is what makes this series unique.  Each month is 'tailored' to a woman's body and its changes during pregnancy.  Month-to-month her body is changing and the workouts are adjusted accomidate your expected energy and flexibility levels.  I will do the workout each day for a week until I have it down and then play something else on the TV while I do it for the remainder of the month b/c the videos themselves are boring.

These workouts will NOT get you into shape if you weren't before and if you're a cardio junkie like I am they will not satisfy that itch, I also run for cardio in addition to these.  What they give you is a full body workout suited to the pregnant body that keeps you moving and stretched which I find has worked wonders for my body adjusting to all of the changes, it stretches me and gives me energy.  I do a workout about 5-6 days a week.

I will update this upon completion of the 9 months....

Tracy's moves seem very unorthodox, almost like she just decided to make these moves up and some don't seem safe to be doing while pregnant.  Before I was pregnant I pretty much did every Jillian Michael DVD under the sun so I've seen my fair share of new moves but Tracy's just seem bizarre.  With that being said, the bun workouts for months 4 and 5 seem to do the trick but like I said they don't necessarily seem safe.  I highly recommend Summer Sanders' Prenatal Workout.

I've seen Tracy Anderson on infomercials for her regular line of workouts and heard many great things so I wanted to try this one.  I have to say that I wasn't comfortable with many of the exercises and they were jerky and awkward to me.  I also found myself lost as she doesn't give much direction on how to do the movements.  I didn't like the exercises on the floor involving the chair.  Overall I felt out of my element w/ most of the movements.  I am accustomed to workout DVDs and taking direction from them.

Unless you are already a dancer or gymnast, some of the moves are unsafe.  I felt alarm bells going off in my head when I was doing her workouts.  When I did research on her to see what her background is I found she has no formal training or certifications.  Maybe some folks are okay with that, but this was not the workout for me.  Didn't care for her personality either.",1394150400,5,491,4.293478260869565
5467882,5,B00AQ4WJM2,"I decided that I should start exercising more regularly when I was 22 weeks along. I am reasonably active, but wasn't doing anything in the first half of my pregnancy because of morning sickness and travel. So I wasn't sure how I would feel jumping into a new routine, but this DVD is great, it is low impact, safe moves that still push me. She does arm work involving 3 lb weights and then drops them for the leg work, which involves being on your hands and knees and lifting your leg up and behind you at various angles for 20 repetitions. You will want a floor mat with some good cushioning.
The 'all-fours' leg work seems to work the back a lot, too, which is great for me because I tend to get some back pain and sciatic nerve pain, later in pregnancy. I am hoping to avoid some of it this time.
I have done all the DVD's from month 1-6 and then on a day when my back was feeling a little glitchy I tried the 9th month just to see what it involved. I really like all of them, but I think month 6 was my favorite so far.

After doing them 6 days a week (plus walking 1-2 miles) I feel like they are helping with my strength and energy levels.
I have decided to order a second pre-natal DVD off Amazon to mix up the routine though. I ordered ""Expecting More- Sarah Haley's Daily Sweat Pregnancy Program"". It looks like it has a higher intensity cardio factor which will be a good balance with this DVD hopefully.
I like Tracy Anderson's personality, she doesn't do the cheesy commentary throughout the workout, just a little at the very start of each workout, but then she gets into the routine and is right to business.",1393977600,7,1623,4.252427184466019

However, I was pleasantly surprised when my arms and butt were sore after doing this.  I did not start this DVD until the 4th month.  I was active before doing this DVD, but mostly walking and yoga.  It is good to keep my arms and butt toned in addition to my other activities.  I like how she has you sitting or kneeling for the entire arm workout and on all four for all of the leg/butt work.  I feel like this video is really helping me stay toned without being too strenuous.  It is also nice that minimal equipment is needed (3lb weights and a chair).",1393804800,3,654,4.225806451612903

5467885,1,B00AQ4WJM2,"This review is for Months 1 through 5.  I stopped using these videos at Month 5 b/c I have found other prenatal exercise videos that I prefer.

If you plan on getting this video, please note that most exercises are on done your hands and knees so you will need a really thick yoga mat.  Also, you will need a set of 3 lb weights.

I'm going to be very honest here - I purchased this video b/c I wanted to look as good as Tracy Anderson during my pregnancy.
Before pregnancy, I attended 2 - 3 ballet barre classes a week and felt really strong and fit.  Based on the picture and the reviews of this home workout video, I thought it would get a good workout.

I found the videos hard to follow.  There is very little instruction on good form for the exercises and Tracy does a lot of subtle movements in her body during the exercises that she does not mention.  The camera angles are weird and due to the camera angles and vague instruction, sometimes I didn't realize that I was doing an exercise incorrectly until the 2nd side.  Since I like to make sure my form is correct, I was constantly straining my neck to watch the video while I was on my hands and knees, which is a majority of the time.  I started using my laptop to play the video on the floor, so I wouldn't have to constantly look up.

However, I did like the arm exercises b/c they were different and seemed to work muscles that other videos don't focus on but do not think it is worth purchasing just for the arm workouts because the videos are not separated into different sections.

I would not recommend purchasing these videos.",1393200000,6,1596,4.283333333333333
5467886,3,B00AQ4WJM2,"I was really excited about ordering this DVD set. I found Tracy to be motivating and energizing. I liked all of the stretches and upper body workouts. However, the lower body workouts ( the leg and butt lifts ) started to give me a lot of pain in my pelvis. I talked to my doctor about this and he said that I should minimize those kinds of movements because the pelvic ligaments in a pregnant women are lower and therefore more likely to cause pain. I was disappointed that I cant really do all of the exercises because it is not safe for me to do so. However I did really like her upper body workouts and I am still planning to get her postpartum DVDs.",1393200000,2,654,4.198412698412699
5467887,3,B00AQ4WJM2,"I had high expectations for this video set since the reviews for it were pretty good.  The videos are easy to follow, but repetitive and low impact.  I would have liked more of a variety of exercises and if she would have done exercises that were a little more challenging to start, then demonstrate the low impact version.  I use the dvd's about once a week, but wouldn't buy them again if I had known they'd be like this ahead of time.",1392854400,,437,4.304878048780488
5467888,5,B00AQ4WJM2,"I am a fan of Tracy and her method, so I am not surprised that I am IN LOVE with this gorgeous workout collection.  It is a gentle but efficient workout.  I will implement Tracy's prenatal set 3x a week throughout the rest of my pregnancy.  I love Tracy's sweet demeanor in these videos, as well as getting to see her grow along with me!  I am implementing both of Suzanne Bowen's dvd's to compliment Tracy's workout set (I find Suzanne's more challenging, but not overly so), but I look forward to my days with Tracy so much more.  These dvd's offer a sweet and peaceful vibe that really lifts my mood.  Could not recommend more highly, and I plan to gift this set to every pregnant friend of mine.",1392681600,4,699,4.338461538461538
5467889,5,B00AQ4WJM2,"I like this program a lot, and I appreciate that there is a different workout to begin each month.  As someone who gets bored easily, I need that.  That said, I own a lot of maternity workouts. If I was doing only this video, I would still get really bored.  There are at least 20 repetitions per body side for each move.  You just do the moves and count.  I don't look forward to putting the DVD in.  It seems like I did in the first trimester, but by end of the 3rd, I'm a little tired of lifting my heavy legs 20 times in a row with the same move.  I did always get excited for the new month's video, and I do think it is very effective, though!  I know it has helped me to at least feel confident that my hips and butt aren't getting out of control!",1392595200,,753,3.9403973509933774
5467890,5,B00AQ4WJM2,"I cant say enough about this package of videos. I started doing Tracey's mat dvd about a month before I got pregnant with my second child. I was starting to try to get pregnant and still have 5 pounds to lose which looked more like 10 to me in pictures to get back to my pre-pregnency weight of 133. My arms looked puffy, my face looked puffy, my breast were saggy and my butt had fallen. I was in a panic thinking id never look like my old self again. I had been running, walking swimming but nothing could get rid of that mommy puff. I started seeing results from the matt workout right away losing 2 lbs and tightening up a bit, but then turned up pregnant just 3 weeks into it. thus the nausea, exhaustion, and bloatedness made me feel like crap and I packed on 5 pounds of extra blood and fluid and early pregnancy stuff. I ordered the pregnany project pronto since i had seen the results from the mat workout and believed in tracey's method at that point. I started it right away and it was just what i needed to keep myself motivated to work out even when i felt like crap. knowing i could turn it off if i wanted to ( she even says so), i would tell myself, just do the warm up, or just get 15 minutes in now and maybe try 15 minutes later. honestly shes so good during the sickest of my weeks when i could only do 15 to 30 minutes a few times a week, i was still seeing results. Then I was able to do the full workouts and I progressed. My mother who is my biggest critique told me today that I look smaller than i did before I got pregnant(at 14 weeks). I knew it was true but it was nice to here. At 14 weeks, im still in my size 4 pants, and all my other clothes. Im not showing at all and im not puffy and i haven't gained a pound since my first weigh in. I eat about the same as I did before, but I do indulge in a little extra ice cream (2 or 3 times a week) my weakness. Baby needs calcium right? Where i saw the biggest results was my trouble areas-the love handles shrunk and tightened up so i have a nice little waste- Ive never really had a tummy issue even after a baby, my arms tighted up and slimmed up with much less sag and more definition, and under my chin, I actually have a jawline and my cheek bones are more noticeable. other bonuses were that my butt lifted and I have less cellulite than I did, I was born born with the stuff so im not expecting it to be gone, but its less than i had when i wasn't pregnant. My thighs also thinned up. Also the skin across my chest and collar bones is more tight making my now swollen boobs look more defined and awesome in a push-up bra! So ive done months 1 - 3 and love that they still focus on the abs. I think im still going to be able to carry this baby high and tight like I did the last since I have so much strength in my core from front to back. You don't realize when you are doing the workouts that focus on the arms or he legs are also working your core. or when you are focussing on the legs you arms are still being used. The results are just amazing. shes knows what shes talking about. I was a bit skeptic when I first pulled out the mat workout out, but i am a skeptic no more. and cant wait to see what she can to do me after baby #2. I had doubted id ever be my former self. but now Im giddy thinking i might be able to even do better. The motivation and the results has also motivated me into being a little extra careful with what im eating. I can see myself doing the 9 videos in reverse after baby. slowing working my way up to doing abs again and trying her postnatal videos after that. That being said, this workout works for me. it may not be your thing. Why it works for me.....1)yoga pilates and bar and other dance based workouts have always given me slimmer results than other more "" masculine"" type workouts as I like to call them. Anything with weights makes me bulky and puffy and gain weight and also doesnt seem to target my trouble areas that i listed above 2) I like tracey. if you don't like the instructor...it hard to spend an hour with her every day or even a few times a week.  I find her videos calming, i like her voice and her music doesnt get under my skin, but you can also mute the music and add your own if it gets old. I love that she doesn't talk much. takes a bit of getting used to the workouts but when you are doing it all the time you get sick of hearing the same instruction over and over. 3) she works muscles to exhuastion, this just works period. but the best part is you don't even really realize that you are exhausting them. 4) I like how her body looks and looking at her makes me get through it. Ive workout out with male instructors on videos and just cant say with them because i look at their big muscles and say ""i don't want that...what am i doing here"" I want to be tiny, slender, with slight definition, feminine!  So if you can agree with my last few points, give it a try...you won't be disappointed",1392336000,18,4941,4.020325203252033

I bought this DVD hoping it would serve to keep me toned but safely, and I love it! I feel like Tracy still targets the areas that I'm most concerned about during this time.

5467921,1,B00AQ4WJM2,"I have done Tracy Anderson's DVDs before and thought this would be a good support though out my pregnancy. It was ok up until month 3. But as you progress in your pregnancy you really want to be guided by someone who is connecting you much more with your changing body and a trainer who is much more aware of breath work and how to take care with moving in and out of positions when heavily pregnant.

I did not think that all the exercises were particularly safe or took into consideration the strains and stresses on the body in later pregnancy. The movements felt very counter intuitive focused mainly on inanely targeting maintaining muscle tone and not at all about connecting with your body or adapting movements to support the changes taking place. I got a lot more from doing pilates and yoga than I did from this DVD and would not use it again in any future pregnancy.

For the final stages of pregnancy, yoga is far more beneficial as it focuses on working with the breath and a much deeper level of endurance and understanding of the body and what is needed in preparation for birth. This is of course a personal trainer's angle on working out in pregnancy and seriously lacks awareness of how to work more effectively and intuitively with a pregnant woman's body.",1390348800,2,1275,4.563318777292577

I personally just did not like the workouts at all. Almost none of the exercises made me feel like i have done any work out at all besides making me very uncomfortable. I felt like there were a ton of versions of one single exercise rather than working more body parts. A lot of woman love it, it just didn't work for me at all",1390003200,,519,3.9056603773584904

I have only used it a few times because I've had a lot of problems with severe nausea/morning sickness, sciatic pain, foot problems etc. I wish I could use it more regularly though because I do love it. Before becoming pregnant I did a variety of workouts but I tend to like things that are a bit more intense. My go-to's are p90x and insanity although I also run and use kettlebells among other things. Due to this I thought this workout would be slow-paced, ineffective and easy, and that she would probably annoy me. I was wrong. The workout went by pretty quickly and although it didn't use weights most of the time, it was challenging enough to have me sweating and for my leg and butt muscles to be shaking. My arms felt pretty worked too and my muscles felt nicely relaxed after completing the workout. Despite it being a little slower paced than what I'm used to the time flew by.

5467924,2,B00AQ4WJM2,"I work out a lot and have done a lot of classes as well as videos at home, so was anxious to stay in shape when I got pregnant but in a safe way. That is my one plus for this: Overall, I trust Tracy that she knows what's safe and unsafe for a pregnant woman. That being said, she is not a great teacher on video. I pulled the muscles in my low back twice (6th month and 8th month) and am now unable to move without great pain--just what you need more of while pregnant! The problem is that she doesn't provide instruction on how to properly position yourself and it's hard to gather them from her camera angles. From other classes, I know for the most part how I should be in certain postures, but I obviously lapsed a few times and injured myself. She does not do a good job of protecting the low back. Also, she uses momentum with weights and doesn't tell you what area she's working. Rather than count (she counts to 20 a ton), she should be reminding viewers to breathe, how to hold postures correctly, and other helpful reminders to make sure the workout is effective. I would certainly not recommend this to newbies who haven't done her videos or a lot of other dance-based classes before. I also found them to be a bit boring, but I'm one who needs variety in workouts, so it may suit others. Overall, I say PASS before you get hurt!",1388188800,4,1340,4.23828125
5467965,1,B00AQ4WJM2,"How does this trainer have such a large celebrity clientele? Her instructions on the moves are non-existent and the quality of the DVDs is very poor. She just starts doing moves that seem quite sloppy and unstructured (which I would think is not very safe during pregnancy) and doesn't give any instruction on how to perform the moves correctly. For the most part, the videos appear to be filmed by a single camera at one angle with no close ups of specific moves--this makes it hard to see exactly what she's doing at times. Couple that with the lack of instruction and you're left to improvise some moves.

To be fair, I did try a few of the DVDs, but they do not get any better. I get a better workout cleaning my house.",1388188800,8,723,4.395522388059701

Otherwise, I really like the video, it is cold here and the sun hardly comes out hence not much inspiration to exercise outdoors this time of year!

I was/am physically fit and I do have a dancer background from growing up. Just take your time and practice the moves. Like any new routine, sometimes you have to practice to make sure your form is correct.

With this set, you can be sure that you are staying active during your pregnancy, preparing your body for childbirth, and making it easier to get back to your pre-pregnancy body.

Just to clarify, there is no cardio component to this set. In the regular TA method there is a dance cardio and muscle structure component.

Every month, Tracy and a handful of other women who have used the Tracy Anderson method (including Gwenyth Paltrow, Christy Turlington) also talk about various subjects dealing with pregnancy, which is fun to watch.

5467991,4,B00AQ4WJM2,"Don't expect cardio out of these videos, but definitely Tracy will make your arms and butt burn (and hopefully hurt the next day).  Positives: I felt completely comfortable the entire video doing the exercises, it helped my lower back and hip pain (I am currently in my fifth month), and Tracy talks about the right amount.  I used 5-lb weights instead of 3 because I am used to lifting weights, so that helped make it a little harder.  It is encouraging that she is pregnant with you and it is obvious that she is challenged by the workout as well.  Negatives: Don't expect to break a sweat, I complimented the video with jogging/biking/other cardio (if you are used to exercising), and sometimes I felt like the motions were repetitive.  Overall, the other pregnancy videos I've tried are awful and feel like a waste of my time, so at least this one makes me sore in the right places and helps the places that shouldn't be sore feel better.",1382400000,2,942,4.583333333333333

5467993,3,B00AQ4WJM2,"I literally just started my first workout yesterday. I am 11 weeks and this is the first time I have really been able to workout since I found out I was pregnant. I was too exhausted in the beginning. I thought the workout last night was pretty intense. I regularly worked out before my pregnancy. When strength training I would do videos such as Jillian Michaels and Brazilian Butt Lift (I know, the name is corny but the workout is actually amazing for your lower 1/2). All of my strength has been in my legs my entire life. I stopped working out for about 6 weeks after I found out that I was expecting. Last nights workout kicked my butt literally. I have no doubt that it is a great lower body workout and I am very sore today. I was able to do all the reps, but could only do the workout for about 30 minutes before I stopped. My body just wasn't ready for it. I think I was just a little surprised at how intense it was for a pregnancy video. The main reason I gave this 3 stars is because the video is just a little strange. Tracy doesn't do much explaining of what the moves are working and some of the moves are a little bizarre. She switches moves very quickly at times with little warning. She also does not have any breaks between the longer sets. Sometimes a move is actually 2 moves and you do 20 reps. Then she quickly moves to the next one that is working similar muscles. I don't need an actual break between sets, but would like to focus on a different body part to give the other body part a break. I am going to stick with the workouts though and am happy with the purchase. I just don't know how I feel about the entire workout.",1381881600,,1650,4.175548589341693

5467998,2,B00AQ4WJM2,"I ordered this DVD set the week I found out I was pregnant. The Pregnancy Project is a very good idea in theory, but in practice it wasn't for me. If you are in really excellent shape at the time you get pregnant then this might be a good option for you. If you are strong and patient, then I'm sure this DVD will keep you toned throughout your pregnancy. I am in decent shape and regularly do workout DVD's, but this is probably my least favorite. Tracy does not explain the exercises very well, so it can be difficult to follow and she does so many reps of each movement that it gets very boring. The worst part of it is if you are not extremely careful to have perfect form, YOU WILL HURT YOUR BACK. I much prefer the Summer Sanders Prenatal Workout.

So far, I'm pretty pleased with them, though I'm only on the month 4 DVD.  I was a dancer for more than 20 years, so a lot of her moves and timing are familiar to me with that background.  I don't find her to be annoying or talking too much during the moves.  I don't always feel she gives you good explanation on form; she tends to be more specific with the simpler exercises and give less instruction on more complex ones.  Still, its nothing outrageous and easily done correctly.  I do get a good work out from the DVD, and I am noticing a difference with the strength training.  I'll have to find another option for cardio as it gets colder, but I think I'll continue or increase my use of the DVDs!",1380672000,,855,4.2024539877300615

I think it's kindof a boring program--very repetitive--like you'll be doing an exercise and look up and be like are we STILL doing this (because a lot of times she doesn't count or anything)? Really didn't want to continue using after month four because I was just over the style of the workouts.  I usually prefer yoga DVD's, so I'm going to go that route.  If you're a Tracy fan, go for it.  If not or if you don't know yet, watch her youtube videos to see if you like her style first--because nine months of Tracy is too much for me.",1380672000,,702,4.125

Let alone the fact that they are an hour long,  as someone who works  for a living at a physical job I just don't have the energy or patience for it at the end of a long day",1380412800,3,345,3.9
5468004,2,B00AQ4WJM2,"I normally use Tracy Anderson's regular program and I like it and see good results from it so I thought I would try her pregnancy program now that I am expecting. As a Doctor of Physical Therapy, I don't think this program is actually safe for use. I understand her philosophy of being in a quadruped position (on hands and knees) to give the uterus room, however this position also encourages excessive lumbar lordosis or curvature in the lumbar spine. A pregnant woman already has too much lordosis and increasing that angle places excessive shear forces through the spine which causes nerve root compression leading to back pain and potentially sciatica. Exercises in the quadruped position would be safe if a woman had adequate core strength and stabilization to maintain a neutral spine, however a pregnant woman does not have this level of core stabilization. Tracy's form throughout the DVD is poor and I would be fearful of someone mimicking her form in which she does not ever maintain neutral spine and is putting a torque forces through the hips and pelvis, essentially shredding the lumbar spine. Like I said, I like her normal program and plan to resume it after pregnancy, however I don't feel this is a safe product for myself and would certainly advise against it for my pregnant patients.",1380412800,137,1305,4.856502242152466

Form is super important for her DVDs, otherwise it could feel like you're doing the same move over and over.  But, if you do it properly, you'll get a good combo of strength and stretching from this DVD.  There isn't any cardio, so if you're looking for that it's best to supplement this with some walking or low-impact aerobics.  But, I'm glad this DVD is part of my collection.",1380326400,,545,4.454545454545454

It helped me stay stronger then in my first pregnancy and my husband said my arms and legs where sexier then before my pregnancy when I just ran.  I did find month 4 too hard for me but I think that was due to shingles which unfortunately I had at that time and was unable to get out of bed for 2 weeks.

I took off one star b/c I found her to be annoying (too much -this will fight under arm flab e ct. Comments which made it seem shallow)  but in hind site she was right...  but my goal was to stay strong to have a faster recovery and I think these did that.

Yes, it is a simple workout, but how complicated should things get when you are pregnant? It seems to me too many women want to abuse their pregnant body into submission. Here's a spoiler: if you are pregnant you will gain some weight. Best thing to do is eat healthy, keep moving and don't worry about looking like Giselle bundchen two weeks after giving birth. That is part of why I like this DVD set. Tracy Anderson doesn't seem like she is setting unreasonable goals. Keep your arms and legs strong, keep your butt in shape if you can, enjoy the process of being pregnant.",1377820800,,710,4.298507462686567

Not for women who like taking care of their bodies or exercising hard.",1377820800,2,366,4.352941176470588
5468026,4,B00AQ4WJM2,"I am borrowing these DVD's from a friend, but I still feel compelled to write a review. So far I've worked out with months 3 and 4, as I am only 4 months along right now, but I'll keep this up to date as I get further along. I was very active before my pregnancy and I continued with my same exercise routine until the 3rd month when the high impact exercises started getting to be too much for my achy boobs. That's when I substituted the Pregnancy Project for the plyo, high intensity and high impact exercise routines I did before.

I can tell you that first week, I definitely felt the effects of the new moves on my legs, butt, and even my obliques. It was a great new work out that seemed to work other muscles I apparently hadn't been using before. It basically focuses the first half on upper body exercises and toning, then the last half on leg exercises. Because there isn't much cardio involved with this, I use my elliptical machine for 30 minutes a day 5 days a week. I also do a yoga/pilates fusion 1 hour exercise twice a week in conjunction with this, just to have more variety and to work different parts of my body while stretching.

There's a few negatives I do have. Other people have complained that she doesn't give much instruction with form, which I concur with. It takes a lot of hit or miss to figure out what the correct form is, but when you do it enough, you will get used to doing it right, and there is lots of repetition, so you do have lots of opportunities to figure it out. You'll know if you're doing it right if you can feel the tension in the part you are working. Another negative I have is that, yes, there is quite a lot of exercises that involve you kneeling and it can be pretty annoying and tiresome to the knees, but I just put two hand towels under my knees and it cushions them perfectly. As for the acid reflux complaints, well I luckily haven't experienced that yet. Another negative I have is that while it does help to keep your muscles working, it doesn't have cardio, or much stretching, which is why I do other forms of exercise in conjunction with TAPP. You can't really get a full body work out with this, but I think it's perfect for keeping your arms, back, abs, legs, and butt muscles working so you don't lose too much of them.

As for the other complaints about it being ""repetitive and boring"" well, that's what exercising is, repetition. I wouldn't expect anything else other than repetition especially when it comes to muscle training. And for the complaints about the music, it does give you the option to turn off the music and just listen to her voice. You can always play your own music from your Ipod or something.

So I am very happy with these work outs so far, and I honestly feel like I have had such minimal pregnancy discomforts because I keep up with this routine as well as my cardio, yoga, and pilates. If you are experienced in fitness like me, you will appreciate this. If you are exercising for the first time during this pregnancy I think it's a great way to start.",1377734400,3,3047,4.340350877192982

If you have been doing the method, its still challenging and a great way to keep up what you were doing in a careful way. I love that there are workouts for each month, and you can go back and forth to keep it interesting & challenging. Another thing I think that is so important with her workouts is connecting your mind, body and challenging your balance-  because these elements only help when you're body is shifting so much... and it helps you get through the marathon of your life- delivering that baby.

It's an ok workout to do when you can't get the motivation to go to the gym, and I suppose technically it's a decent workout- but there are sooooooo many reps of everything so it's a bit mind numbing. (The secret is simply doing about 400 leg lifts each workout- hard to argue that's bad for you, after all.)

I did TA workouts before so I know some of her moves & my body may have had some conditioning. I really love the arm sequences & the workout changes every month, which accommodates changing bodies and keeps boredom at bay. I have experienced most weight gain in my back & arms. When on all fours, the leg sequences really are tough. You need to hold good form to work out you abs and not strain the back. Some
moves do strain your wrists but over time I have found this to be less of an issue. As a FTM, I feel toned and firm throughout this pregnancy and although I may only get to the workout 2-3 times a week - I have been consistent. I think the real test will be postpartum recovery & results. I really value TA results. She does cue a little better in the latter months (and this has always been a shortcoming of her 'style' - which I kind of appreciate because if she cued to much, I would find the delivery too boring after repeated playing).

5468079,5,B00AQ4WJM2,"I love the workouts, I didn't get this DVD until month 5, but after a rapid increase in weight gain, this DVD helped to curb that. It does focus mainly on arms and glutes, but other areas are worked in the meantime. Tracy is very encouraging and offers a challenging workout without pushing you too hard through pregnancy. I really enjoy this DVD and the different months and exercises she offers.",1373846400,,397,4.605633802816901
5468080,5,B00AQ4WJM2,"I love this workout! I am 5 months pregnant with my second child and it has made a huge difference compared to my first pregnancy. I am petite at 5'3"" and 110lbs and ended up gaining close to 40lbs with baby #1 so I was really hoping to find a workout that catered to my pregnant body the second time around. I love this workout for the variety, length, and because it's effective. The first 3 months are a little longer, around an hour, and at month 4 they shorten to abt 30-40 minutes. I can do this workout while my toddler is napping and still have plenty of time to shower and get stuff done around the house. I like to mix it up going back to the previous month every now and then, and with the shorter workouts I like to combine it with a little cardio if I can make it to the gym. Don't kid yourself though - this is TOUGH! It is a full-body work out that really targets your arms, butt, legs and abs. I am right on target with my weight gain and I feel CUTE this time around. Highly recommend this workout!! I plan to do the post pregnancy workout and I've already gifted this DVD set to a friend.",1373673600,4,1106,4.077981651376147

These videos are challenging but safe. Tracy does a great job of explaining the movements. I 100% recommend these videos. I wish I found them at four weeks instead of twelve weeks.,1373587200,,333,4.387096774193548

I mean, I run 2 miles every other day, and this still pushed me.  I know workout videos can really be hit or miss, but this is a definite HIT.  I actually felt it so much in my muscles that I will continue to use this even after giving birth.  It's so affordable considering there are NINE dvds!  Definitely motivated to strength-train safely during this pregnancy.  I didn't have this resource during my first pregnancy and it took a long time to bounce back.  Excited to see how this affects my recovery time this time around.  Also, I only have 5 lb. weights at home, and that was too much for these exercises so I just did them while holding nothing.  I would recommend buying the recommended 3 lb. weights prior to starting...and actually, if you are still just trying to conceive...buy this now, so you can get started asap as soon as you see your two blue lines.

This is my fourth baby, I'm 38 years old, and I am very motivated to be in good shape throughout my pregnancies and quickly get back into shape after.  I have a lot of pregnancy workout DVDs, and was excited to have something new.  Here is my normal (non-pregnancy) preference: I love P90X, Jillian Michaels ""No More Trouble Zones"" and ""Ripped in 30"", etc.  I think if someone is already a fan of Tracy Anderson's method, they will probably like her pregnancy version also. I bought this because she was mentioned by Gwyneth Paltrow as the way she got back in shape after her pregnancies, and Gwyneth obviously looks great. Tracy, however, was not my style. She is not even wearing workout clothes, but is wearing a black lace cami and wedge booties.  Doesn't scream serious workout to me.  And it didn't feel like a serious workout either.  I used months 1-4, a few times, and then gave it up because I didn't care for it.  I went back to modifying my existing Jillian workouts, my Prenatal Vinyasa yoga DVD, and The Perfect Pregnancy Workout, Volume 1, which I have used for all pregnancies, and find to be very effective.",1373241600,,1170,4.569377990430622

However, the leg workouts are nothing but rear leg lifts (she is trying to ""keep the butt lifted"").  You literally do rear leg lifts, with slight variations, for the entire leg portion of the workout.  I got pretty bored with it in month four and was very disappointed to find that it was more of the same in month five.

5468142,2,B00AQ4WJM2,"I was optimistic when I ordered this 9 disc DVD, despite some negative reviews.  In hindsight I should have heeded the advice from the negative reviews.  A little background on me: I have been active all my life, a collegiate athlete and a fitness instructor during and immediately following college.  I am knowledgable on proper form and technique and the importance of adequate queuing and instruction to prevent any improper alignment or movements which could lead to injury.  It's because of this last statement that I was so disappointed in Tracy Anderson's video.  Mind you I've only completed the Month 2 disc, so perhaps there's a chance my opinion will change as the months progress, but I felt strongly enough about my experience with Month 2 that I wanted to write a review to potentially help others.

The queuing is basically nonexistent and she rarely ever discusses very important things like keeping your tummy tucked in to protect your back during some of the moves she's giving instruction to.  Her movements are so quick that I found it very difficult to watch my form in the mirror to ensure I was executing the movement safely.  Often times throughout the workout she doesn't say a word (boring!) where as a fitness instructor that's where you can fill the audio with reminders for things like not hyperextending your elbow when lifting a weight over your head, keeping your shoulder away from your ear, or always being conscious of pulling your belly button in to protect your back (which is going to get enough strain as the pregnancy progresses).

I believe her intentions are in the right place, and she may have a very different way of communicating in person or in a group setting, but from my perspective I was disappointed that I spent my money on this DVD as opposed to a couple others that made my short list.  On a positive note, the room she's filmed the video in is decorated beautifully and her hair and makeup look fabulous, so if you're looking for those features in a workout DVD this is a ""don't miss""!  ;)",1372032000,4,2045,4.716292134831461

So doing this for the first time definitely left me sore for a couple of days. However, after sticking to it, it got easier and still left me feeling like I got a good workout in. I like that there is a different DVD for each month. I am about to enter my 4th month in a little less than 2 weeks, and I've been switching back and forth between month 2 and 3 dvd's for some variety. Tracy is much better at keeping up with her reps, compared to her mat workout, but I still feel like she could explain the exercises better before she starts them so that there isn't a lot of pausing in the middle of reps so she can explain how it's supposed to be done. When I'm working out, I want my intensity and heart rate to stay up! Overall, I get a good workout and feel like all my muscles are being worked.",1371772800,,942,4.01595744680851

And we are really tired when pregnant even if we do sport and still have muscles ok, but Tracy is working with the chair even at the 7th month like without overweight, with full of energy.

I used to be a dedicated exerciser, getting up before the sun and driving 45 minutes to the gym just to get a workout in before work.  I ""fell out of exercise"" and came up with every excuse when I was posted to the country for work.

After reading some of the reviews, I was worried that this workout would be not challenging enough for me, given my prior commitment and dedication to exercising and keeping fit, but found that it was not the case.  Tracy works muscles in me in different ways to my gym workouts, so ""not being challenging enough"" would never be a problem.  Her workouts are just the right difficulty, just the right length and she is easy to follow.

Tracy's approach to ""home video workouts"" is friendly and welcoming, and I feel comfortable inviting her into my lounge room every day to help me on my way to keeping active during my pregnancy.

I highly recommend this if you need a little motivation to keep you active in these exciting 9 months.",1367452800,,1099,4.465

Both of those instructors are much more animated during the workouts and give helpful pointers about the different moves.",1366934400,,501,4.837209302325581
5468272,4,B00AQ4WJM2,"I'm so glad I ordered this.  It wasn't available until I was starting my 7th month so I have only done the month 7 & 8 workouts but they are great.

I think it's helpful to know where other reviewers are coming from, so: I'm regularly pretty active. Weekdays I alternate between jogging 3 miles or going to a toning class at the gym (weights/push ups/etc) & indoor soccer 1/week.  I was able to keep that up the first 3 months & then I dropped soccer out of common sense :) and then eventually swapped out jogging in favor of 30 min on the recumbent bike around month 5.  I was eager to get this DVD set b/c I wanted a workout that was both challenging & tailored toward pregnancy.  I thought it would help me gauge how wise it was to continue with my regular gym class during the week.

I find the workout to be challenging & a decent length.  I saw other reviews complain that it's redundant to do everyday for a month straight.  It doesn't really bother me. I usually do this every other day (mixed in with gym class or biking) so I don't really get tired of it.

The first few times you do a workout her extra tips & pointers on form are great and important to make sure we're doing things correctly.  I kind of wish there was another version without the tips, optional modifications, etc. (that's my only tiny complaint b/c you kind of want to keep moving and be efficient with your time).

Oh and the 3lb weight thing threw me off.  That sounded tiny... usually I'd use 8lb weights at the gym.  But I have to say her exercises are different, you do like 20 reps in a row instead of a few sets of 8-12 so I'm going with the program.

Anyway, I think Tracy is great.  I love the peace of mind while doing these exercises that they are good for me during pregnancy.",1366934400,3,1768,4.204747774480712
5468273,2,B00AQ4WJM2,"So, in full disclaimer, before my pregnancy I was doing Insanity. Which means, I'm used to workout videos, like a hard workout, and am coordinated. I was attracted to this video as I know she trains a lot of in shape stars and has a great reputation, and I also liked it was a series of DVDs instead of just one, but I was really disappointed. I found this video really hard to follow and actually painful at times. It seems like a lot of the workouts are on the hands and knees which is really tough as you begin to gain weight with the pregnancy. Additionally, that positioning for any length of time really hurts your back when you're prego. And she puts you in that position for lengthy amounts of time.

Tracy has a great, endearing personality, but the music is slow and boring. Unfortunately the diagonal camera angles and her outfits make it difficult to see what she is doing with her movement, and there's not much description of the exercises as she does them. (I agree with another reviewer who said she's more or less just counting up instead of describing what she wants to achieve or isolate.) Often the movements seem very similar to one another without enough contrast between them, so it feels like you're working out the same areas over and over and ignoring major other important muscle groups and parts of the body.

Overall, I'd skip this and go for another video. I tried the Long and Lean Prenatal and really liked it and found it to be a better (and more comfortable and uplifting) all over workout.",1366848000,,1524,4.518115942028985
5468274,5,B00AQ4WJM2,I worked out regularly (5-7 days a week) before finding out I was pregnant. This I a fun and very relaxing workout. Some days I don't have the energy to do anything more intense than these DVD's offer. I have realled enjoyed them so far and look forward to continuing throug the system as my pregnancy progresses.,1366761600,,313,4.508771929824562
5468275,5,B00AQ4WJM2,"its broken down by month which is great.  Being in shape prior to pregnancy, this workout actually feels like you are doing something compared to other pregnancy video.  highly recommended for ppl that want to have a serious workout for pregnancy",1366588800,,246,4.975609756097561
5468276,2,B00AQ4WJM2,"Three things I didn't like about this workout and all are very important to me in a workout.
1. She absolutely does not give enough description on proper form form the moves. Are her knees directly under her hips? Are they a little wider, in front, behind? I have no idea because she never says and the camera angles are normally at a weird diagonal. She talks very little which I don't mind, but I need the basics. Sometimes she'll say things like ""you should be feeling that."" Where should I feel it? I am sore some times, but I don't know if it's because it's working or because I'm doing it wrong.
2. Seems like the same muscle groups are worked repetitively. I'm a person that wants to hit calves, triceps and lower back, not just butt and shoulders. Which seems like those are the 2 muscle groups she focuses on, but I can't be sure because she never says.
3. Not near enough stretching. Seems like some of the actual exercises are designed to stretch while toning though. I just don't think it's healthy to do a 30-60 min workout with only 45 sec of stretching at the end.

Things I liked.
1. Her. I like her personality. She's not too chatty, doesn't make stupid jokes. She's really pleasant.
2. Her set. The atmosphere is really calming and serene.
3. All of the moves do seem totally pregnancy focused. I did regular workouts during my last pregnancy, definitely too much ab work. I bought this DVD set because I really want to be cautious this time.

This is what I thought after doing the first 3 months, maybe I'll update as I progress. I'm going to stick with it and probably try some others.",1366329600,4,1606,4.422297297297297
5468277,5,B00AQ4WJM2,"I really love this dvd set and I love that it moves through the different stages of pregnancy with me. While it is challenging (especially for those without a dancing background as she does use dance terms to describe movements with little explanation as to what the move consists of) and may be tough on the knees for some, I can definitely feel and see the results from that very first workout!",1366329600,,396,4.513888888888889
5468278,5,B00AQ4WJM2,"These workouts are effective but not too hard to do.  I love that there is a new workout for each month and the further along I get, I now get excited to switch up to the next month. Months 1-3 really did help keep my nausea under control too.  I didn't take it away (I wish!), but it did help.",1366329600,,294,3.8833333333333333
5468279,2,B00AQ4WJM2,"I should have heeded some of the reviews that said this workout was hard on your knees and hips. Um the WHOLE VIDEO of the month I did (I think it was 3) was on the knees or hips and it was quite painful by the end (and not in the I'm getting a good workout painful kind of way). My hip bones and knees were bruised the next day and were very sore. I am not a large person and am quite fit, so it's not like I had a lot of extra weight on them. It was just way too much time to be spending on your knees and hips. I won't touch any more of the DVDs that came with this set again because it was that bad. I recommend Suzanne Bowen's Long & Lean pregnancy workouts, The Perfect Pregnancy, and the What to Expect DVD over this one.",1366243200,,728,3.7960526315789473

5468341,5,B00AQ4WJM2,"I think this may be the video that finally sells me on Tracy Anderson.  I've been intrigued by her method for years because I love dance and I like the idea of lots of cardio and toning combined, but have struggled to get on board with her almost complete lack of cuing.  These videos (I've only done months 2-3 thus far) are quite different.  She talks a lot more about correct form, and although she's still never going to be accused of over-cuing, it's all very clear and comprehensible.  Also, I've been really nauseous and fatigued, and the workouts so far have been a great combination of very manageable (probably because you're not moving anywhere very fast) and really challenging.  I used to be in terrific shape, but my strength/cardio has suffered since I had my last baby (no time!), so I can definitely feel the repetitions.  That said, I can also feel a real difference in my energy level and overall body tone after just a week or two.  And, learning moves that I've seen her use in other videos, I wonder whether this won't be the transition set I needed to feel more comfortable with her other workouts.  We'll see.

The pace is also a lot slower, but I'm really enjoying it.  It feels quiet and focused and calming to me.  All in all, I'm very happy with this set so far.

I think the bonus materials are pretty silly, but occasionally entertaining.",1366156800,3,1368,4.538775510204082
5468342,5,B00AQ4WJM2,It is a great product . It is exactly what I was wanting. An alternative for the strengthening part of my workout. I still do additional cardio but this is the perfect addition.,1366156800,,177,4.393939393939394
5468343,2,B00AQ4WJM2,"I'm in my 7th month and have been doing this workout since the beginning.  I bought it because I liked the concept of having a new workout each month, tailored to what my body needs at the time.  This was my first experience doing a Tracy Anderson workout, and I had high hopes.  Unfortunately, I found the workouts to be very boring and very repetitive.

Each workout is about 45 minutes.  Some are longer, some are shorter.  After a warm up, it moves into arm exercises, which I actually like.  They are unique moves and they've made my arms toner.  The leg exercises, which make up the majority of the workout, are where I take issue.  Most months, you are on your hands and knees for almost the entire time doing leg lifts.  Each movement is done about 20 times on each leg with only slight variations to the move.  The problem is that the movements are basically hitting the same muscles over and over again with no relief.  It's not the challenge of it that I have a problem with, it's the fact that it doesn't feel like a balanced workout.  Now that I'm in my third trimester, I've actually found the exercises to be straining on my back.  Some require arching your back, which doesn't feel like safe form during pregnancy.  The cool down portion is hit or miss.  Some months include a good amount of stretching to focus on those tired glutes and hamstrings.  Other months skip leg stretching all together, which makes no sense to me.

Finally, I do not like Tracy's style.  She does not provide much instruction during the videos and mostly just counts out loud... to 20....over and over again... for 45 minutes.  I prefer instructors to talk through the moves, explaining why they are important and giving tips on form.  I always try the video out in the beginning of a new month, hoping it will be better than the last month.  But, I end up just using it for the arm exercises and then switching to something else to work my core and legs.",1365984000,62,1949,4.461756373937677
5468344,3,B00AQ4WJM2,"Before getting pregnant I excercised 3-4 times a week with moderate to high intensity. I mainly workout to dvds. I searched for a dvd designed for a pregnant women that still had a high enough intesity so I could feel like I had an effective workout. I received this dvd set in the mail at 24 weeks of pregnancy. I reviewed the 5th & 6th month disk I did not like that I would be on my hands and knees for 20 minutes. For my comfort I decided to start with the 7th month dvd where you are only on your hands and knees for 3 excercises. I did feel the burn while I was doing the video and the next day.
I was very happy with the fact that I felt like I worked out and targeted my legs, butt, back, core and arms.
I did not like that there was no explaination of where I should be feeling the burn or what muscles were being worked.
I had to use my past knowledge of how to adjust some of the positions so I would not injure myself.
Since I did not use this program from month 1 I am not sure if the moves are better explained in the beginning months.
I would not recommend this to a beginner because of the intensity level and the lack of explanation of how to make the movements safe and effective.
Overall this dvd set is a good value for $20.",1365984000,,1244,3.98
5468345,4,B00AQ4WJM2,"Let me begin by saying I am really enjoying The Pregnancy Project now that I've got my own little routine with it figured out.

The first time I used her DVD (at the very beginning of my fourth month) I was sore for three days afterward and really disheartened.  It made my thighs feel so tight, I had trouble walking up the stairs.  I learned my lesson quickly though and now I do my own warm up before I start the DVD workout.  I do ten minutes of walking with my Wii Fit but a walk around the block or maybe some laps through your house will have the same effect.  It's just that you do not want to start this workout with cold muscles or you will regret it.

Tracy doesn't take any breaks between exercises but I will usually pause once or twice to drink some water (because we all know how important hydrating is during pregnancy).  I've also learned to be more realistic with myself.  Some of her leg workouts are tough if you aren't used to them and rather than forcing my legs to get to 20 reps for every movement, I stop at 15 per leg for some of the more challenging ones.  I don't get as frustrated and I'm able to better keep my form.

Another bit of advice, make sure you stretch a lot after you finish the DVD.  She incorporates some stretching at the end, but for me it just isn't enough.

Overall, I like her workouts.  I feel like I am doing myself a favor by exercising now and hopefully I won't have such a hard time getting back in shape post-pregnancy.  I never feel completely exhausted or like I have over exerted myself.  You can tell she is knowledgeable about what works for a pregnant woman's body.  The DVDs all have extra segments on them, some are more interesting than others but I do like hearing about what other people went through with their bodies during their pregnancies, especially since this is a first for me. I like that I have the option of turning off the background music and having just her voice because frankly, I never like listening to workout music.

I use the DVD about three times a week.  Sometimes I get tired of doing the same workouts, so I will change it up and do the three or five month workup.  I've also been doing yoga and some kind of light cardio throughout my pregnancy.  I'm 20 weeks today and have gained 8 lbs so far.  My OB said I'm right on track for a healthy weight gain. I just want to try to stay at least somewhat toned in my arms and legs and I feel like these workouts are helping me do that.",1365379200,7,2470,4.223880597014926

5468347,4,B00AQ4WJM2,"This workout was great if you need to take it to a very calming level. She utilizes the dance type workouts to keep you long and lean. Very good if you want a calming workout just to keep you stable.
- Stay positive, if you feel tired, press pause and continue with the workout after you get a grip. You can progress yourself in the 9 months, but you have to keep going... listen to your body, and stay positive.",1365120000,3,412,4.1625

5468349,3,B00AQ4WJM2,"Just received this at the 5 month mark.  I already do barre classes three times a week, plus cardio 2 days.  I bought these for the weekend and when/if it becomes too difficult to get to the barre class.  I felt like the 5 month DVD was pretty pointless and left a lot of room for error and possibly soreness and injury to your abs and/or back.  She does a lot of fast movements with the legs and hips and never mentions not over-extending.  I found it to be uncomfortable and this morning the only thing that was sore were my shoulder joints, not muscles.  It's probably going to be fine for some and not for others.  I will stick with doing it once a week in addition to my other workouts, but glad this isn't what I am depending on to stay fit during pregnancy.",1363564800,,764,4.191780821917808

Tracy gives very good instruction in this one and counts the reps for you. There are 20 instead of 40 or 60 like her other videos. It is not a voice over like her other ones either, she is actually speaking during the video which is nice.

8555898,2,B00AQ4WJM2,"Im currently 7 months pregnant.  Im by no means Mrs. Fitness, but I do workout daily, sometimes twice a day.  Im in decent shape, before and during pregnancy.  I attend small group classes and do various Beachbody workouts.  I can lift heavy for a female and use good form.  I decided to give this a try a few months ago.  The arm moves feel like she is just making them up as she goes.  They are pretty much all swinging motions, which use momentum and not even the muscle.  If you're looking to tone up your arms from this, youll have to find something else.  The leg moves, however, are rough.  Like I said, I work out often, and the leg moves were even hard for me.  You definitely feel the burn! Theres way too many reps, especially for being pregnant.  Even before pregnancy, I was never a fan of being down on all fours for too long.  I wouldve liked it if she did half of the moves standing/holding onto a chair and the other half down on the floor.  Its too long to hold on your wrists.  The quality of the videography is also poor.  She often starts the move with her back leg, so you can barely see what shes doing/how its bent/turned out.  Its not until she does the front leg that I realize exactly what the move should be and that I did the first leg wrong.  She also tells you after a move is done on both legs how you couldve modified it.  At that point, its too late because the move is over.  Her good job motivation during the videos is very forced, its almost comical.  Ive never done Tracy Anderson workouts before.  I do own some of her videos, but just never tried them.  Im interested to see if shes like this in her other videos or if its just exclusive to this pregnancy set.  Im not relying on this as my pregnancy workout. I will continue to do a video here and there when I have some extra energy and time.  You may as well just go swing weights around for 10 minutes than rely on this for a solid arm workout.  If you didn't work out before, I don't know how you would get through the leg moves.  Theres far too many. Ive even had to shut it off halfway through. I wish there were more pregnancy focused workout videos on the market, because this one unfortunately misses the mark.",1526428800,,2211,4.2023809523809526
