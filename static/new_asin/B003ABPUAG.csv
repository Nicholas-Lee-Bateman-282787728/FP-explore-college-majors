4101425,2,B003ABPUAG,"The film starts out promisingly: as the millennium approaches, a young man, posing as the editor of a bogus magazine, conducts interviews with various media personalities (actors, stand-up comics, models, rock bands). However, these all turn out to be confrontational meetings to expose the superficiality of modern ""culture."" These short bits are satirically on the mark and sustain the film for the first 15-20 minutes. Unfortunately, once this premise is established the film has nowhere to go. If this had been a short film it would have been brilliant, but stretched out to feature length, interest peters out quickly.",1328832000,,623,5.303030303030303
4101426,1,B003ABPUAG,"Dan Zukovic, the filmmaker, thinks he is some kind of Jim Jarmusch here. But let me tell you, Dan Zukovic is no Jim Jarmusch. Never mind the ""plot."" There is no humor here. And the girlfriend of the lead character is simply annoying. Mark Ruffalo went on to some good roles after this, however. There are very long moments of no dialogue, and lots of attempts at creating some kind of moody meaning out of the vapidity here. I hope this didn't cost much to make because whatever was spent, was wasted.",1296604800,,501,4.456521739130435
4101427,4,B003ABPUAG,"I've been waiting for *years* for this to be released on DVD. I had a copy that my dad recorded off of IFC when it was broadcast after it came out and I've lived in fear of the day when the vhs tape wouldn't work anymore because I have never run into anyone with another copy. It's a really quirky interesting comedy with some truly memorable moments... it's not perfect and it might not be the most appealing to a more mainstream comedy palate, but if you like indie comedies it's a really great one, in my opinion.",1280707200,7,516,4.275510204081633
4101428,4,B003ABPUAG,"I think the humor of this very quirky comedy will entertain you; this movie did get a distribution deal in 1996 (and played in theaters all over the US) through Carl Ikahn's Stratosphere Entertainment, and was supposed to get released thru Fox-Lorber Home Video.  Both of these companies no longer exist, but happily ""The Last Big Thing,"" true to its title, holds up through time!",1268784000,4,380,4.846153846153846
8392927,5,B003ABPUAG,"True nostalgia for the younger GenXer.  This film is unpredictable as it is unsettling with just the right comedy and intellectualness to make you ask ""what in the hell did I just watch?"" at the end.  If you want to know about the last days of LA life pre-internet.  This is a worthy snapshot!  Enjoy!",1485216000,,301,4.418181818181818
8392928,5,B003ABPUAG,I love this movie. Saw it stuck waiting for a snow storm to pass so i could catch a plane. Ever since I have  looked for it,1478131200,,123,3.5555555555555554
8392929,5,B003ABPUAG,"Excellent movie, very sharp and witty!
Unfortunately it wasn't released on DVD for a long time neither it was shown much from late 90s,
and relative topicality of this satire is gone now, for everything that's ridiculed and criticised in this film has become an everyday, standard and widely-accepted REALITY in modern eh, culture.
Yet it's still fun to watch, though with some surge of nostalgia...",1456099200,,399,5.0606060606060606
8392930,5,B003ABPUAG,"This was awesome. One part in particular that stuck with me was the comment saying that in the future life would be full of people publishing self funded magazines that were all about themselves (instagram, twitter, facebook) The movie is very self aware and the commentary on society is generally straight forward and the message is clear: culture is going down on itself.",1427587200,,373,4.936507936507937
8392931,5,B003ABPUAG,"I saw this movie in the theater in 1996. My friend and I loved it so much that we went back TWICE to see it. I even got in contact with the producer, David Barnett, some years later. He ended up sending me a bunch of promotional material for the movie including post cards, posters and the DVD soundtrack, which I still have! Then a few years later I saw this DVD on some bootleg website and had to have a copy. The copy wasn't great but it was the first time I had seen the movie in nearly 10 years. Now that there's a ""REAL"" DVD version of this movie out I am ordering a copy TODAY.

This movie is not for everyone but if you get this type of humor then you will LOVE this movie. It's sardonic and dry done better than I've seen in any other movie. This relatively unknown movie deserves to be considered a cult classic.",1409097600,,822,4.074074074074074
8392932,5,B003ABPUAG,"The movie is kinda wierd maybe even revelationary, I liked it. Another big plus is that the main character in this movie drives an AMC Eagle .. and so do I , for the last 20 some years, so I had a connection. I watch it from time to time, always see something I missed.",1407801600,,269,3.909090909090909
8392933,5,B003ABPUAG,"Fantastic cult indie finally available on DVD! Actor-writer-director, Dan Zukovic, plays Simon Geist (Zeitgeist), a sardonic and dead-pan sinister misanthrope promoting a non-existent Los Angeles magazine, The Last Big Thing, as he wages an apocalyptic campaign against America's obsession with superficiality and pop culture media directives (""the culture has gone down on itself"").
However, as the tale unfolds through Simon's relationship with his roommate and would-be disciple, Darla (who seeks to create her own magazine devoted to Simon's philosophy, Geist Has Fallen), we find that at an earlier period of his life, Simon the outsider actually wanted in. Unhinged and hysterical. Now if only indie fans could at long last get a DVD release of Tom Noonan's 1994 What Happened Was... as well!",1369699200,2,798,5.495934959349594
8392934,5,B003ABPUAG,"I like this because it is, quite simply, a clever assertion of where American culture is heading. It is just smart, funny, and oh so true.",1345161600,,138,4.346153846153846
8392935,5,B003ABPUAG,"I really enjoy this movie.  It's not easy to achieve, so we don't often see the perfect blend of intellect and dark humor.  Sardonic, intelligent, and hilarious this movie is a masterpiece.",1344038400,,189,4.875
8392936,3,B003ABPUAG,"really weird, silly movie with some great dialogue. i like it, but i don't know anyone else who does tho",1330819200,,104,4.25
