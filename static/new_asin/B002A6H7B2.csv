It's a shame that we Americans are not allowed to see such great cinema as this film, a hard sell in America with its uncompromising downbeat look at life, while we're bombarded by endless moron pop corn movie garbage that numb the senses of our young people with idiot superhero characters, extreme violence that celebrates violence for violence sake, idiotic, convulted stories that make no sense unless you graduated a lunatic asylum. This Brazilian film is a work of art, a powerhouse, moving emotional experience, however bleak its view on life. I recommend it to anyone desiring and daring to see a film that forces you to think. The performances of its cast are magnificent, and I greatly admire both directors of the film who have a long history of collaboration, Daniela Thomas and Walter Salles. Guess Walter decided to return to Brazil where he can make the personal films that he'd never be allowed to make here, without selling out his soul, vision, and artistic integrity.",1259712000,3,1040,4.948571428571428
