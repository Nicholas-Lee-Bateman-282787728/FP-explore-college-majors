1829935,5,B00008976O,"Yes, this is where the predominantly comedy/adventure ""Dragonball"" series begins its tranformation into its more action oriented sequel, ""Dragonball Z"".  Also, this is where you will discover in full detail the origin of Piccolo, one of DBZ's most popular characters.  The saga begins with the murder of Goku's best friend, Krillin at the end of the 22nd Tenkaichi Budokai (AKA World Martial Arts Tournament).  In a rage, Goku rushes off to avenge his fallen friend, but is unaware that Krillin's killer happens to be the most powerful underling of the evil Piccolo Daimao, who has been set free after years of imprisonment to turn the Earth into a living Hell once again!  This DVD set contains only the first ten episodes of the saga, but it just keeps getting better beyond that.  If you're a true DB/Z fan, I highly reccomend you buy this and the rest of the saga.",1059523200,4,868,4.76

Along with his army of demons, Piccolo was close to conquering the entire planet when a brave group of martial artists tried to stop him.  Master Roshi was among the group, and his master, Mutaito used an ultimate move known as the Evil Containment Wave to seal Piccolo in an electronic jar. But the attack took too much energy and Mutaito died from exhaustion. Roshi threw the jar into the sea and expected to never hear of Piccolo again, but he was released!
  What could an invincible monster possibly want with Goku's Dragon Ball? Eternal Youth! Can our heros stop Piccolo, or will he conquer the entire planet just as he intended to do many years ago?
  This saga in Dragon Ball is the major turning point where the series and it's sequals turn from light humor and battles to epic struggles and massive fights.  This DVD set is graphic and full of violence, so younger audiences should be careful.  The storyline will not turn back to humor until the Majin Buu Saga in Dragon Ball Z.  This saga contains great fights and a very interesting storyline.  It is my favorite in Dragon Ball, though I like the Majin Buu Saga of Dragon Ball Z just a bit better.(They have similar stories if you think about it.) I recommend this set to any fan of Dragon Ball.",1159660800,,1673,4.580536912751678
1829958,1,B00008976O,"As a general rule, martial arts films are fairly stupid. Animated martial arts films are, as a general rule, terminally stupid. I will be the first to admit that the Dragonball Z material, which is extensive, isn't the most absolutely stupid, although at times it comes perilously close.

Those who are unfamiliar with this subset of the genre, the Dragonball series concerns the dynasty of muscle-bound martial arts superheroes founded by an alien (Seiyan), Goku. He was sent to Earth to destroy it as an infant, but forgot all about it an became the closest thing to Li'l Abner seen in modern anime (he's hugely strong, mild of manner, and innocent to the point of impraticality.

You would think the series would actually be about ""Dragonballs"". Well, it sort of is, occasionally. These little orange balls with stars on them, if collected together, allow the possessor to call up a gigantic magic dragon that will grant a wish. At times where's a lot of plot business connected with rivalry in getting the balls. However, at other times the dragonballs completely disappear. This is one of those times.

Instead we get lots of martial arts and of course the other thing associated with Dragonball Z, overabundant and overdone ""comic relief"" -- which is too self-consciously ""comic"" and from which there is little relief. A lot of this is provided here by a stock Dragonball character, Hercule. The reader is referred to an other ""Hercule"", Clouseau's assistant in the early Pink Panther films (and clearly a parody of a third Hercule, namely Poirot). The Panther Hercule is only marginally brighter than Clouseau ... the Dragonball Hercule is more than marginally less bright. Despite the clearly greater martial powers of the Goku dynasty and other fighters, he always manages to retain the title of World Martial Arts Champion through some fluke. For a while, Hercule has no idea he's benefitted from other than his own skills, but by the time of the ""Bojack"" film, he's well aware of his position at the bottom of the totem pole.

You won't see much it here, but Dragonball comedy tends to use laughable names for its characters, particularly villains -- such as the perennial Garlic Jr.

As is usual with Dragonball, there is a martial arts contest and it turns into a serious threat to the continued existence of Earth. The threat is then dealt with (with lots of cliffhangers) by a member of the Goku dynasty. (By the way, nobody ever explains how the continued mating of the Goku dynasty members with Earth people fails to produce weaker and weaker offspring. If anything, this genetic dilution seems to produce stronger results. On the other hand, expecting things in this series to make any real sense in the real universe is very, very foolish.

The ""Bojack"" film is fairly harmless and will no doubt fascinate kiddies whose educational prospects are limited. Nevertheless, I urge you not to buy this turkey. The reason is simple: it is preceded by 2 blatant and obnoxious commercials that can't be bypassed. If you want to watch the film, you have to watch the commercials.

Shades, we hope, NOT of things to come.",1153958400,,3129,4.870300751879699
1829959,4,B00008976O,"I brought this movie and thought that it would be like the other ones but it was not. Don't get me wrong this is a great movie but I realzied some things they did that they didn't do in the other movies. First of all I was surprised to see Hurcules skin darker normaly it's lighter. Secound of all they put in minor swear words in one scean Trunks uses the H word after he starts fighting one of the final fighters. Im not sure why they did that but hey Dragon Ball Z has swaring in it sometimes. The movie is about when the Z fighters go to a tourtment and enter a humongus fight were the last 4 opents stading will go to the finals. Gohan, Trunks, Vegeta, and Krillin make it to the finals and must fight the opents know from another world but are realy Bojacks heachman. Soon after meating Bojack Krillin, Vegeta, and Trunks are dafeated and only Gohan is left after Gohan is nearly at death he Goku was watching the whole thing on telvision and brakes the rules of Heavn to help Gohan. After Gohans standing agian is only task left is to deafeat Bojack and this is no game. This movie is good but I was expecting a little more action and fighting.

Story(3.5 out of 5): Classic Dragonball Z, I liked the tournament setup it makes the world tournament mor important.

Visuals(5 out of 5):  Slick fights make this as enjoyable as eating fudge.

Characters(4.5 out of 5): We have a new classic villan Bojack! And his gangsters Zangya, Gokua, Bido and Bujin.

Sound(1.5 out of 5): Nothing a little boring but amps up during the fight scenes.

Action(4 out of 5): You have to love classic fights like this one.  Its all out brawling style makes this a classic to remember.

Villian Deaths(4 out of 5): You gotta' love em'.  Super Saiyan 2 Gohan + Bido and Bujin and Bojack = BOOM! Awesome villain death!

Overall(4 out of five): Not the greatest DBZ movie but a musy buy.",1129680000,6,750,4.529850746268656
1829961,5,B00008976O,"This is a really good movie. There is just one problem I have with it... the villain. Bojack looks tropical colorful fruity, and I can't actually feel him being a bad guy at all. The greatest scene in the movie is when Gohan goes Super Saiyan 2, and kicks the crap out of Bojacks men. This movie is rare, but if you can get your hands on it, then your gonna watch a real good movie.",1126828800,,382,4.0394736842105265
1829962,4,B00008976O,"I've noticed that a number of fans were disapointed by this entry in the movies and I ask why?  Is it because there is a slight possability that this happened within the DBZ Universe timeline (Considering that from a time standpoint between Cell and Majin Buu there was 5+ years).  Or is it because the villian (or villians) Are at least somewhat origional?

The story with Bojack is that it has been at least a year since Cell was vanquished and this rich old guy decides to hold an intergalactic Tournament with special guest fighter Mr. Satan (or Hercule).  During this tournament all the Z fighters with the exception of Goku and Vegeta participate.  However in the final rounds a new villian emerges to destroy the earth.  With Goku out of the picture and Vegeta lacking the will to fight it is up to Gohan to stand and fight.

The reason I like this more than say Super Android 13 or the second Cooler film is that it could potentially take place within the Universe, the villian is actually cool (instead of a redneck Android or robotic hasbeen) and for once it leaves the fate of the world outside of Goku's hands.  Granted he interfers ever so briefly but it is up to the rest of the Z fighters (which include Krillian, Trunks, Piccolo, Yamcha, and Tien) to fight for the sake of the world.  In this matter I am very pleased with the movie and highly recomend it.  This kind of reminds me of the Garlic Jr. Saga in that it didn't need Goku to defend it, and in the end the earth did fine without him (no I am not a Goku hater).",1098403200,18,1536,4.3578947368421055
1829963,3,B00008976O,"Movie 9 finally comes on DVD. I was happy to see this because movie 9 has always been a personal favourite of mine. I just really like all the different scenarios that they fight in.

Audio 2.5/5 - There was nothing particularely wrong with the audio, but once again, Funimation fails to put it in stereo. We only get regular mono for this one yet again, which is really poor for a DVD release.

Video - 5/5 - Once again, the video quality was perfect, just like in the previous movies. Funimation this time, has not messed with the picture like they do in some of the episodes. Next, I have to addresss the widescreen issue. All 13 Dragonball Z movies were in fact, created in FULLSCREEN. However, they were first released in Japanese theatres. So Toei Animation cut out some of the picture to make them widescreen. Then, once released on VHS, they took the chopped up widescreen version instead of the original fullscreen. Funimation, however, recieved the originals from Toei, and now, for the first time ever, we can see the original un-chopped movies, which is great. I admit the widescreen versions seem alot better because it makes it feel more like a movie, but the movies were originally fullscreen. If you search around the web you can find screens comapring the DVD with the original vhs widescreen version to see the chopped off difference. So, that's that.

Subtitles - 2/5 - The subtitles were really bad in this one. First, I have to address the error at the beginning when Kaio-sama and Goku are watching Mr. Satan on TV. The subtitles read ""So Cell is the one who defeated Cell? That's okay I guess"" when they should read ""So Mr. Satan defeated Cell? What a joke!"". That was a real let down to see that error, because I loved that line. Next, once again, Goku uses the word ""ain't"" again, it's horrible (really ruins his character). But it wasn't as over used in this movie as in Movie 8, so it's not that bad. Still though, the rule should be, if you can't speak proper english in the first place, do not do the subtitles. They also continue to spell ""Saiya-jin"" as ""saiyan"", which is also in-correct. Funimation uses the rest of the japanese nomenclature, so this is another half done job again. The reason I'm giving such a low rating as well, is because I know Funimation can do better. The last episodes of Dragonball where Son Goku fights Ma Junior in the Tenkaichi Budokai, the subtitles are absolutely flawless. Overall though, they subtitles are easy to read (they're white instead of the standard yellow though).

Story/Action - 4/5 - I really enjoy this story. The original fans know this is a classic, and it's a great interlude in between the 3 Brolly movies, but alot of new American fans are getting sick of the whole repetitive fighting against big bad guy type thing. That's fine for them, but I loved this movie. The tournament setting is really, really awesome. Takes me back to old days in Dragon Ball when the Tenkaichi Budokai used to be really important. The tournament set up is also really cool, as is the conversing between characters during it. Mr. Satan also gives us some good humor. Bojack is a really cool character, and the fight scenes look beautiful in the battle zone settings. Very classic ending with a classic song as well. Great movie, and a better story than say.. Movie 7 (thought the story was already laid for that with the androids).

Overall, 3.5/5 stars this one gets. Though the DVD may seem over priced, it's still cheaper than the Japanese VHS because those are not only quite rare, but the shipping is a fortune. But I leave it to the true fan to decide wheather to buy this or not based on my review.",1097539200,6,3668,4.585365853658536

The story line is lame, the fight scenes are unoriginal, the bad guy is under developed, Gohan isn't emotional, and this movie was basically made to seperate the ""Brolly Saga.""  In the japanese version you are going to get better theme songs, and some more violence but you are going to be missing the modernized sound effects.  In the Funimation version you are going to get the usual techno theme songs that don't overlap the series at all, poorly translated lines, and cooler sound effects/Vegeta's speech.

C'mon!  This is one of the greatest fighting series ever, get a little original!  Make a two-hour feature with a big back-drop story combined with something at least a little unpredictable!  There are still a few DBZ movies out there that have yet to come to the US (with at least one really good one that I've seen in Japanese - the one where trunks gets his sword), so I haven't lost all hope, but I fear that this franchise may have ""jumped the shark...""",1096416000,4,849,4.28125

The tournament takes another turn, and it's interrupted by a new foe named Bojack. Who is he, and what exactly does he want? -summary

Bojack: Unbound is the ninth movie in the long running Dragon Ball Z series, and I have to say it's not only among my most hated movies in the franchise, but also in the anime genre altogether. Even for a DBZ movie, there is no imagination or any attempt whatsoever to at least make the already beaten path the least bit tolerable. It's so by the numbers that after watching the first eight movies, you can actually create a checklist and start marking off plot related elements as you go.

After a few very boring fights and mind-numbingly lame comedy; Trunks, Gohan, and Krillin advance in the tournament and leave for a new area to continue fighting. From there they meet Bojack, his minions, and then several brawls occur. DBZ is an all out action anime, this is something we all know and there's nothing wrong with that. However, this movie is just way too by the numbers and very bland. The side characters are nothing but bodies to be dominated. They make very dramatic appearances as if they're going to actually pose a threat, yet they're beaten quicker than they show up. If a new viewer came into this movie first, I can't imagine them wanting to delve deeper because no one comes off looking like a bad ass at all. Bojack and his gang are nothing but cookie cutter baddies with about as much personality as a pimple between them all.

This movie takes place after Goku's death which occurred during the Cell Saga, and his son Gohan arose as Earth's new protector. Instead of developing him in that way, he comes off needing support from his dead father. There was so much potential to develop the entire cast as a team, plus mentor Gohan along the way. Instead, they clearly find a way to cram Goku into it, thus proving there was no way the show could have possibly survived without him. Many fans believe that this movie can actually fit in the DBZ main continuity in between the Cell Games Saga and The Great Saiyaman. Well, without nitpicking in the characters dialog it actually can; but that's not a reason to praise this movie.

While the backgrounds have moments of looking very good, from the peaceful looking prairies, to the dark and menacing ruins in the battle ground. The animation unfortunately is the usual reused-cels found in the DBZ series. In other words, very quick, blurred motions passing off as action, the laziest path to take when it comes down to delivering action scenes. There really isn't much choreography, as there's a heavy reliance on a light show. While plenty of the explosions and energy attacks look nice, the actual fighting has always failed to register with me. Up to this day I still haven't heard the sub, and I have no desire to. However, the dub is pretty good with the usual suspects featuring Chris Sabat playing both Piccolo and Vegeta, along with Eric Vale as Trunks; and please don't come into this expecting the fun rock scores you heard in Cooler's Revenge or Broly: The Legendary Super Saiyan. Instead, what you get here is something mums will use to put the kids to sleep.

Everything about this movie screams ""lazy money draining succubus"". If someone told me it took Toei Animation 10 minutes to come up with this movie, it would be lies to me and I'll swear it took less. In closing, this movie is only for Dragon Ball Z fans. Everyone else do yourself a favor and avoid it. If you're looking for a fun anime feature minus the psycho-babble, Redline or even Read or Die would make better choices. If you want something with a deep storyline that doesn't run for 10 hours, Area 88 OVA will be a great choice. Skip this 50 minute waste of time.
