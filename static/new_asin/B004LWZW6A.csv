4406050,3,B004LWZW6A,"Watched the movie with the family. It was 'ok'. I liked the acting. All the actors were great.
It wasn't the greatest movie we've watched lately. Watching the trailer made me expect more. The 4D thing, didn't work for me. Scratching on a piece of carton, had no effect other then me taking my eyes from the screen, to see what I was doing. The opening scnenes were the best (in my opinion). I felt all the good stuff was shown in the trailer, so I was left hoping to see more, which just wasn't there in the movie. The story and moral was good. But I did like the openign scenes and the overall acting by allt the actors. They did a good job.",1314921600,,642,4.144
4406051,5,B004LWZW6A,"I saw the movie with my five year old son...was a little skeptical about seeing it because of the poor reviews from the critics, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that I was engaged throughout the movie and genuinely enjoyed it!  My son LOVED it and has spoken of it for days!

We saw the movie in 3D, but probably would have enjoyed it equally as much in 2D as the 3D effects were rather subtle and did not add significantly to our overall enjoyment.  The fourth dimension was smell and we received scratch-n-sniff cards when entering the theatre.  The smells on the card were numbered and you scratched the numbered smell when the corresponding number flashed on the screen.  This was interesting and a novelty for my son, but I wouldn't have missed it if it was not there.

A note about the first review posted here on Amazon...the review is not consistent with my experience at all.  It doesn't even sound like we saw the same movie.",1314662400,10,942,4.5058823529411764
4406052,5,B004LWZW6A,"I don't know WHAT the previous reviewer was talking about, I don't think he even saw the movie! First, the 4th dimension is smell, that's not a spoiler. I don't understand the reference to Joel Fleishmann(???). The kids from the first three movies ARE in this film, but they play Jessica Alba's character's niece and nephew, not the kids. I was very happy that they brought them back, it tied all the movies together very nicely (and it was nice to see them all grown up!). During the movie, numbers would flash on the screen, matching numbers on a card you got when you bought your ticket. Good old scratch and sniff! The reaction from the audience with one of the numbers was a riot! That made this movie so much fun! I saw the movie in 2D, so I can't comment on the 3D effects. All in all, a really fun time at the movies!",1314316800,5,825,4.294871794871795

4406629,3,B004LWZW6A,"Spy Kids 4: All the Time in the World is the fourth installment of the Spy Kids series that was resurrected after eight years of absence in 2011. This family film adventure movie by Robert Rodriguez stars the originals - Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara - together with Jessica Alba,Joel McHale,Rowan Blanchard,Mason Cook,Ricky Gervais and Jeremy Piven. The story of the fourth film is about a family that seeks the help of Spy Kids - Carmen and Juni Cortez - after they are threatened by a nemesis who intends to take over the world.

Marissa Cortez Wilson is married to a famous television reporter and has step kids Rebecca and Cecil,who happen to be intelligent kids and who apparently don't want their stepmother around so much. Apparently,Marissa happens to be a retired spy and her world is turned upside down after a new nemesis - Timekeeper - plans to take over the planet. In her mission,she seeks the help of the Spy Kids to stop Timekeeper's evil plans.

At this film,the series has obviously run its course. It should have not been brought back to screen considering that the fourth film has been characterized by the same old plot that worked in the original such as under-aged kids acting as spies,nemesis that have the same mission of taking over the world and bringing back the new special effect particularly the crummy old AromaScope. It is apparent that the children who have enjoyed the first three films have grown up as adults just like the original Spy Kids cast and they have definitely outgrown the fun,excitement and entertainment that it is expected to provide. The box office results is a testament to that as it was the lowest among all four films. In the end,it is time to put a halt to the series.",1430179200,,1724,4.686468646864687

4406917,1,B004LWZW6A,"There's just no other way to describe this unholy piece of crap. Everything about this movie simply sucks. It was supposed to be in 4D when it first came out, and man was I disappointed when ""4D"" was just a cheap scratch and sniff paper. The only jokes in the WHOLE movie revolve around farts, boogers, armpits, poop, and barf. Come on! I mean, there's some kind of gross-out crap joke every ten seconds. Not to mention completely laughable special effects, unlikeable but rather gross characters, and the most unrealistic 3D I have ever seen. They also add sound effects that more likely to be in a Looney Tunes cartoon. Everything sucks. The whole time going too fast concept is too confusing for kids, and the ridiculous amount of idiotism (i.e. a girl losing her head in a computer world, and her head getting stuck in someone else's butt, or shooting bad guys with barf bags, used ones might I add) is too messed up and dumb for anyone older than five. Parents - take my advise. Skip this crap. Don't turn your kids into semi-retarded delinquents, and don't waste the insides of your stomach throwing up halfway through the movie. And if your kids are going through a fart joke-loving phase, I recommend Dave Pilkey's Captain Underpants books. It's a fun read as a third grader, it doesn't necessarily rely on poop jokes too much, and it's pretty entertaining. As for this, just don't waste your time and attention cells.",1406419200,2,1426,4.685258964143427

Ms. Alba is particularly beautiful in any show she is in.  The other three are just plain funny.  I also loved to see how Carmen Cortez grew into such a beautiful young lady. I am glad that Ms Alba was playing her step mom because Ms. Alba doesn't look old enough to be anyone's Mom.  There was a lot of silliness, a lot of slapstick, and a lot of just plain fun.

4407234,4,B004LWZW6A,"We have the entire Spy Kids series.  This one really stresses the importance and value of ""Family.""  Jessica Alba's character is the StepMom & she plays a Spy. Understandably, it's difficult for the kids to accept a second mom in their lives after the death of their own mom.  This movie comically brings home the idea that love is special - and if someone wants to take the time to love you and care for u, then don't waste time on silliness.  And since you never know how much time you (or anyone else) has, take the time to love & enjoy them while u have the chance.

The kids are hilarious & their sibling rivalry provides lots of laughs. The Spy Dog is charming (love his British accent) and is also a fun addition.  Granted, you have to suspend disbelief in just about everything but it's definitely a light hearted, fun movie.  It's enjoyable for the entire family & the message is a good one.  I especially like how it emphasizes that kids can do anything because adults 'over-think' things.  Kids have so much imagination & aren't encumbered by what can't happen or can't be done.  It's fun to watch my wee ones react to the empowerment of wee ones in this film.  The only critical thing is that some of the lines are 'cheesy' and one line says something like ""Ohhh....shiiiit"" and then a slow ending is added on in a 'tongue-in-cheek' manner so it sounds like ""ohhh..shitake mushrooms.""  Of course, my wee one immediately started saying it and will likely go to school and use it (lovely!) but other than that, it was good overall family fun.",1365811200,2,1552,4.503571428571429

4407511,3,B004LWZW6A,"Filmmaker Robert Rodriguez may be known for his action and violent films but he's also known as family man who is dedicated to his wife and children and it led him to create a family action adventure film series known as ""Spy Kids"".  So far, three ""Spy Kids"" films have been released: ""Spy Kids"" (2001), ""Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams"" (2002) and ""Spy Kids 3: Game Over"" (2003).

All three films would do remarkably well in the box office and combined, have made over $460 million dollars worldwide.

While the third film was supposed to be a conclusion to the ""Spy Kids"" series, with the films doing so well, why not continue it, especially for a new generation of children.  The idea of having to do another film was after Robert Rodriguez who was working on ""Machete"", saw Jessica Alba (who also stars in the film) trying to take care of her one-year-old daughter Honor Marie and saw her diaper ""exploding"" and trying to change her daughter while trying not to get anything on her.  So, the idea of ""Spy Mom"" came to mind for a new ""Spy Kids"" film.

Beginning in 2001, we were introduced to two children named Carmen (played by Alexa Vega) and Juni (played by Daryl Sabara) who find out that their parents were spies for the organization OSS (Organization of Super Spies).  Through circumstances, both children find out their parents previous careers and now both are pulled into the world of being a spy and the kids take on various missions for the next three films.

With ""Spy Kids: All the Time In the World"", consider this film as the passing of the torch as Carmen and Juni return to meet the new ""Spy Kids"": Rebecca (played by Rowan Blanchard) and Cecil (played by Mason Cook) Wilson. And like the previous films, ""Spy Kids: All the Time in the World in 4D"" did very well in the box office, making $70 million in the U.S.

Now ""Spy Kids: All the Time in the World"" will be released  on Blu-ray and DVD on Nov. 2011.

VIDEO, AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Spy Kids: All the Time in the World"" is pretty much a film where you know Robert Rodriguez loves to showcase a lot of CG, weaponry and cool gadgets via technology in his ""Spy Kids"" films.  With that being said, every Robert Rodriguez film we have reviewed have been awesome when it comes to picture quality, audio quality and special features.

The same can be said for this fourth film.  First, I must say that if you want the best version of this film, you definitely want the Blu-ray version!  Otherwise, the DVD is presented in Anamorphic Widescreen (1:78:1) and in Dolby Digital 5.1.  On DVD, picture quality is good, the picture quality is clear as one can expect on DVD but I can imagine that the special effects is possibly even more vibrant on Blu-ray.  It's important to also note that if you have a 3D enabled Blu-ray player and television, by going with the Blu-ray 3D release, because this film was made with 3D in mind, it's another reason to consider going for the 3D Blu-ray release.

The Dolby Digital 5.1 sounds great on DVD as you can hear the kids' rocket flying in air, the weapons blowing up the front door... but if you want more of a punch and want an even more immersive soundscape, definitely go for the Blu-ray release!

Subtitles are in English SDH.

JUDGMENT CALL:

A fun children's film and a passing of the torch from the original Spy Kids to the new Spy Kids.

""Spy Kids: All the Time in the World"" is a film that many children who grew up in early 2000's have remembered watching as children.  And similar to the original cast who started shooting the film when they were younger and are now adults (actress Alexa Vega is now married), it goes to show how quickly time passes by and that why ""Spy Kids"" is one of those films that probably can be made due to new technology, lasting potential as spy films, even children spy films will always have potential and similar to the 007 James Bond films, they can always be enjoyed from one generation after the other.

While the film stars Jessica Alba and funnyman Joel McHale, this is all about the new kids and of course, possibly seeing the original Spy Kids, now adults, one last time.

While the film wasn't loved by film critics, I watched this film with my 8-year-old son and sure, as an adult, for me...the scenes with a pregnant Marissa  (played by Jessica Alba) is quite absurd and I would have never imagined Jessica Alba and Joel McHale ever playing husband and wife in a film.

But watching my son smiling while watching the film, may it be the constant fart jokes or the robotic dog farting as well, needless to say, he enjoyed the film and wanted to see it again.

So, my feeling is that these popcorn action films geared for children, there is always a place for them. Whether or not the adults love the story or not, when you have a good balance of humor and action, the truth is that children, love it as indicative by looking at the box office returns.  This film has been a box office hit because children want a film with a lot of action and just to sit down and have a fun and exciting time.  And needless to say, these kids will laugh at anything that involves flatulence.

The film is rated PG and as a parent, aside from a pregnant woman fighting crime while in labor is a bit of a far stretch and with Alex Vega screaming ""Holy Shi...taki Mushrooms"", I heard my son repeating those words quite a bit.  So, I had to tell him...""please do not say this anymore and definitely not at school, because it sounds like the actual bad word"".

But other than that, for older children, I think they will love this film.  For those who grew up with the previous ""Spy Kids"" films and are more conscious about character development and plots, sure they may find this film a bit too childish for their taste.  But as a family film, I tend to observe my son and nephews when watching these films for children and whenever I can hear them laugh and smile throughout a film, I know they enjoyed the film and it's all that matters.

For the young-at-heart, I know the grownups might not all enjoy the film but for those who do, I do recommend considering the Blu-ray release as it is more immersive and the picture quality is much more vibrant and detailed.  And also, if you own a 3D television and Blu-ray player, the 3D version of the film may be what you are looking for.

Overall, while I found ""Spy Kids: All the Time in the World"" to be an OK family film with a lot of action and laughs, it's a popcorn action film that is definitely for the children and if your kids love action and the constant fart jokes, they'll love this film!",1335571200,,7672,4.433975731620271
4407512,1,B004LWZW6A,I'm supposed to write a review on this and I don't know why. I do not know what this is or what it is about and I don't recall ever purchasing it.,1334793600,,146,3.59375
4407513,1,B004LWZW6A,"I saw the first SpyKids movie and rather liked it.  Then we heard that the second and third installments were less impressive, so we passed on them.  However, the local theatre had showings of SpyKids 4 at $4/adult, free to children, so on a rainy weekend, we took the children (ages 2, 4, 6, 8,and 11). I only got on-line to write this because... well, it was so bad, I couldn't let anyone else waste $8 (or even rental price) on this movie.

The jokes are vomit/feces based, slapstick at their mildest.  The children are sarcastic, selfish, and destructive.  They have no regard or respect for adults, show greed when given treats, and cannot follow the simplest of directions.  What an example for our children!  Not once did they ever so much as even smile at their baby sister, for the most part, they were so wrapped up in themselves that they completely ignored the baby.  The father was as self-absorbed and egotistical, so I suppose it's no surprise the offspring ended up in the same way.

None of the time travel concepts in this movie held a shred of logic - I swear, I lost brain cells just sitting in the theatre suffering through it.  The villain supposedly goes back in time and each time comes back older, but every incarnation of himself that is shown is the exact same age, for example, with the exception of the 30-something villian who comes back as an elderly man.  We never did figure out the helium-voiced thing, though.  Even my kids thought it was inexplicable and ridiculous.

Jessica Alba... how on EARTH did you end up here?",1334534400,2,1553,4.583333333333333
4407514,5,B004LWZW6A,This was an enjoyable movie for the whole family.  I recommend the entire series (which i purchased) on amazon.  My 5 year old son and his friends have watched this movie at least 10 times in the last three weeks.  Even adults find themselves sitting down and enjoying it.,1334275200,3,272,4.510204081632653
4407515,4,B004LWZW6A,"If you're not a fan of the SPY KIDS movies then you should be. Sure, the movie is promoted as a made for kids film but the fact of the matter is that Robert Rodriguez series is made for not just kids but the kids in all of us. And it holds true in his latest installment SPY KIDS 4: ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD.

This time around we have a new set of kids since the originals have grown up. As the movie opens, Marissa Wilson (Jessica Alba) is the top OSS spy and on a mission...even though she's due to give birth the next day. Still able to tangle with Tick Tock her able bodied enemy Marissa wins the day, retires and heads for the delivery room.

A few years later we get to see her dealing with family problems now. She's married to Wilbur Wilson (Joel McHale), a reality TV star whose show has him hunting for spies. In addition to the new baby she has two young step children as well. Cecil (Mason Cook) gets along with her fine but his older sister Rebecca (Rowan Blanchard) resents her step mother and always makes her the butt of her pranks.

Of course Marissa is called out of retirement when Tick Tock escapes and lines himself up with a new enemy, The Timekeeper. They've set out to start the Armageddon machine and take over the world. The only thing that can prevent it is a stone encased in a necklace that Marissa just gave Rebecca. Asking for it back starts a whole new problem as Rebecca gives her a prank instead of the necklace.

Left home, Rebecca and Cecil find themselves under attack by Tick Tock's henchmen which initializes the home defense system Marissa installed to protect them. Soon the kids are off to a secret panic room and discover their unusual dog Argonaut is actually a robot. As the henchmen close in the kids are tossed into small rockets and whisked away towards OSS headquarters with the henchmen in pursuit. Of course they escape and make it to base.

There, they're introduced to their cousin Carmen Cortez (Alexa Vega) of the original series now grown up and working at OSS. Carmen tells them all about their mother and heritage and the Spy Kids program, now defunct. Soon the kids find themselves involved with trying to stop The Timekeeper on their own with the help of a few gadgets they were given as gifts and the whole family winds up in the middle of saving the world before the end of the film, including their other cousin from the original 3 films, Juni (Daryl Sabara).

Like the other films in the series this one isn't a movie intended to win over Oscar members. While some have panned the movie saying it displays Rodrigeuz' selling out I disagree. What it shows is his ability to entertain people who go to movies and it does so in spades. The movie does feature a number of gross out jokes for kids but that's the core audience of the film. It also offers plenty of laughs and some fantastic special effects. The fact that many are intended for 3-D doesn't hamper the movie at all.

Alba and McHale do a great job as the parents here, one aware and the other not much so of the spy heritage of the family. Both Blanchard and Cook do commendable jobs as the new kids on the block having had some small shoes to fill. And it's nice to see Vega and Sabara able to return to their original roles as adults. Let's hope they can all stick it out for at least another film.

This is the definition of a popcorn movie. A movie that is meant to entertain and make you laugh a little, to stretch your imagination and to just make you have fun. It does all of that. There's nothing offensive here and the movie's safe for family consumption unless you're offended by jokes about passing gas. If not then rent this one and watch it with your kids. If you don't have kids watch it anyway and remember when you were a kid and thought all of those James Bond gadgets would be cool to have. The movie offers more entertainment in 5 minutes than most do in 2 hours. Have fun!",1332806400,,3917,4.334242837653479

Jessica Alba is a loving mom and step-mom, a nice portrayal of a blended family. The dad's character is also interesting, but you should really watch the movie.

Jessica Alba in her black spy outfit looks great, though, and I kind of wish she had been cast as either Natasha Romanov or Selina Kyle in the Avengers or Batman movies respectively. She doesn't embarrass herself in this sub-par film and I've been impressed with her growth as an actress the last few years.

4407650,4,B004LWZW6A,"The Spy Kids are back, and yet you just might have to wonder why director Robert Rodriguez decided a couple of years ago to all of a sudden decide to make another Spy Kids movie. If you were like me you thought you remember reading that, Spy Kids 3D: Game Over was the last movie in the series, even with Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara. This movie in part seems to be a remake of the first movie, the only remaining cast members with a lot of more screen time then other cast members are Alex Vega and Daryl Sabara. The Spy Kids are now Spy Teens, or at least very late in their teens. The Spy Kids world as competely changed I will leave that for you to discover if you have not seen the movie. As the movie begins we meet one of more new characters Marissa, (Jessica Alba) who is a secret agent for the OSS and she is on a mission finding a villian named Tick Tock. She is expecting a baby and manges to defeat Tick Tock even with going into labor. And has a baby girl named Maria, she retires for the safety of her two step children, or them finding out that she is a secret agent, doesn't this sound very familar. She is the stepmother of twins Rebecca and Cecil Wilson (Rowan Blanchard and Mason Cook). Rebecca also no respect for her and loves to play pranks on her, Marrissa is also married to their spy-hunting reporter Wilbur Wilson (Joel McHale). And like a lot of other fathers in movies, he is wrapped up with his work and TV show that he doesn't have a lot of time for them. Of a sudden time starts to seem to run out, and Earth is being threatened by someone only known by ""the Timekeeper"" (Jeremy Piven). And now Marissa is called in for the mission, she has to bring the baby, and leaves a red-sapphire necklace (the key to the Timekeeper's plan) with Rebecca, but his thugs manges to get into the house, and they have to go to the safe room, where they see a video where she reveles to them that she is a secret agent. They of course don't believe it, their dog named Argonaut talks to them., and revels that he is a robot dog, they mange to escape and head to the OSS. Marrissa finds out that have left and is there and she calls in her niece Carmen Cortez (Alexa Vega) is there to welcome them, and takes them on a tour of the OSS. She also mentions about her brother Juni (Daryl Sabara) and how they don't speak of him anymore which more or less he had left the OSS. And like always I am going to leave you to find out if you don't already know what happens.

Jessica Alba stars as a retired spy who's lured back into action when a maniacal supervillain threatens the free world. She's joined in her mission by some newly recruited spy kids. The movie will probably appeal to the little ones, and there are moments of visual inventiveness, but for the most part adults may be less than charmed this time out.

I can't tell you how many times we've watched those first two movies--we can all quote them, yet my kids still chose them to watch. This is great family entertainment--so much better than a lot of the stuff out there. I wish there were more movies out there like this one.  I don't know if I can take another Barbie fairy/princess movie!

I highly recommend this as great, family oriented entertainment-with the bonus of family values--even if your family isn't conventional!",1323043200,,895,4.347305389221557
4407655,1,B004LWZW6A,"For kids under the age of 13 that probably haven't seen the previous movies and consider any green screen and CGI action as engrossing and really don't care about acting and storyline then give it three stars for them.

For everyone else over the age of 13 the story is going to be boringly uncreative; green screen and CGI effects just passable and certainly less than what even video games and TV offer especially the flying, action and freeze frame effects. The acting by all ages was too scripted i.e. read-the-lines robotic. Freezing time as well as family discord between the children and parents is the same old worn-out storyline hook used by unimaginative writers. The holographic computer monitors and gadgets with lots of colored lights and bizarre effects is totally been-there, done-that unimaginative.

On the money making side this version as well as past Spy Kids versions do make a lot of money off of their cheap production costs.",1322956800,2,948,4.91875
4407656,4,B004LWZW6A,"My kids ages 5 and 7 really liked this film, so I decided to rate it 4 stars, although on my own I would have given it 3 (I am not the target demographic after all.) I think Antonio Banderas and Alexa Vega lifted these films a bit in the past, and without them, it is feeling tired. In this one, a new generation of parents and kids are introduced, and they do OK, but lack the charisma of the original. The tone of the movie is different too - much more focus on humor, and a fair amount of slapstick. The highlight for me was Ricky Gervais voicing a robotic dog - he gets some of the best lines of the film, although my kids didn't quite get him. Jeremy Piven has some good moments as a two-faced agent/villain, but he also overplays it at times. Jessica Alba and Danny Trejo are fine, but don't compare to Banderas and Vega.

The plot is so-so, although I did appreciate the stepmother/blended family theme, as I do think that is relevant to many modern families. I also appreciated that even though this is an action movie, it is more focused on humor than violence. And as I said, my kids really loved it, they were riveted throughout, so for a family film, that gets it to 4 stars in my book.",1322179200,18,1198,4.208695652173913
4407657,2,B004LWZW6A,"Nearly ten years have passed since the original ""Spy Kids"" hit the screen in 2001. After two sequels, one so-so and the other pretty bad, the fourth installment of Robert Rodriguez's family picture series arrives.

In ""Spy Kids: All the Time in the World,"" a retired spy Marissa Wilson (Jessica Alba), now a mother of one daughter and two step-children, is called back into action once again, when the world is threatened by a mysterious villain ""The Timekeeper."" Her husband Wilbur Wilson (Joel McHale) and two step-kids Rebecca (Rowan Blanchard) and Cecil (Mason Cook) know nothing about Marissa's true identity until they too get involved in a fight against the evil organization.

With so many familiar story elements, ""Spy Kids: All the Time in the World"" almost makes us feel like watching the original, but with less imagination. All the freshness is gone out of the franchise. The story doesn't make much sense (and honestly I couldn't understand why or how the entire world is in danger). Cheesy special effects are acceptable (in fact, welcome) if gadgets are fun. No such luck, as they are only recycled ideas from the past ""Spy Kids"" movies. Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino might have saved the unoriginal plot development. No such luck, either. It's nice to meet Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara again as grown-up Carmen and Juni Cortez, but their presence only reminds us of the original.

Of course this is an opinion from an adult. But I think not many children would follow the unnecessarily complicated storyline (and its confusing wrap-up). They may find the film's toilet jokes very funny. I don't know. But when there is a better ""Spy Kids"" movie made ten years ago, what is the point of making an inferior one?",1317254400,7,1729,4.874149659863946

Mistake.

The characters are different, the plot is less engaging, and there is far more gross-out humor. The kids actually hated it and about an hour in just stopped it and asked to watch the original again instead.

Soanother cheap, bumbling remake to capitalize on a successful brand. Should have known. *sigh*",1517875200,,407,4.704225352112676
8435058,4,B004LWZW6A,"We love this movie. All the movies in the Spy Kids are solid family movies, with the usual potty humor and precocious main characters, but the potty humor is not too heavy-handed and the kids are precocious without being bratty. This particular installment of Spy Kids features a kid with a hearing impairment, cameos from the original cast, and a surprisingly deep theme about letting go of the past/dealing with loss. Much more enjoyable than the average kid movie, if you can get past the fart jokes and talking animals.",1514764800,,523,4.822222222222222
