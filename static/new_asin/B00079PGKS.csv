8159811,5,B00079PGKS,"The most remarkable part of this DVD set is how  you get to see the changes in new york city between the 1930s and 1960s. Of course, the city itself is the same, but the way people dress and act and the cars could not be more different. It's also nice to see that no matter what the era these people had a lot of hope for their future. The futurama fair was the most interesting to me, as people thought we'd have flying cars by now. STill it's all fascinating and I might want to buy the other volumes soon.",1154044800,,508,4.02970297029703
8159812,5,B00079PGKS,"I don't think I would have liked either of the films on this two movie set as much if I saw them alone. What makes it work is having them both back to back.

The reason is that the first film is set at a World's Fair in New York in the 1930s where the people are trying to predict what life will be like in New York in the 1960s.

Then the next film is a World's Fair in New York in the 1960s so you get to see exactly what people got right in the 1930s and what they got wrong (hint: there were no flying cars.)

Seen back to back they show how human expectations clash with actual historical experience.",1146700800,,605,3.902439024390244
