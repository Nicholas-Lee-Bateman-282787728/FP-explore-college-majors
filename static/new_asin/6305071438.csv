959007,5,6305071438,"The Spanish Inquisition was a terrible period in history, as many people perished and were savagely tortured for unjust, political and fanatical reasons - nothing to do with God. This painful subject could not be left unexplored by the audacious Italian filmmakers of the seventies, who also understood the erotic side of the story. One of the films generated by these minds, based on a drama by Victor Hugo, is the provocative and absorbing ""The Sinful Nuns of St. Valentine"" (Le scomunicate di San Valentino).

Directed by Sergio Grieco, the film mixes historical data and eroticism, and it opens with a man by the name of Esteban (Paolo Malco), running for his life. He is trying to escape from three guards from the Inquisition, and one of them manages to hurt him. Luckily, he was close to a convent, and he is assisted by Joaquin, the handy man of the building. Luckily, too, Lucita (Jenny Tamburi), Esteban's girlfriend, is also there, as she is days from receiving her vows, against her will. Her father doesn't like Esteban, as both Estefan's family and Lucita's family have been enemies for decades. To prevent Lucita's wedding, her father fabricates a lie, and contacts the Inquisition, accusing Esteban of heresy and of assassinating a priest. Unfortunately for Esteban, while he is hiding in the convent, Lucita's libidinous roommate is murdered and she is accused of the crime. Enter Father Onorio de Mendoza (Corrado Gaipa), a cruel inquisitor who is determined to burn Lucita in front of an audience in Seville, and use her as an example of sin. At the same time, the convent's abbess (Franoise Prvost) lusts after Esteban.

It is said that ""The Sinful Nuns of St. Valentine"" was inspired by the late Ken Russell's ""The Devils"" (1971). You will be the judge on that. However, I found the film sophisticated when compared with other erotic exploits from the period. It has a smart, solid story, full with suspense and nudity. And, if there is a message, maybe it's this: ""Fanaticism is often nothing more than the other face of madness."" If you think about it, maybe this translates well into our current congressional witch hunts. (Italy, 1974, color, 93 min)

959008,3,6305071438,"The Italian genre which was dubbed 'Nunsploitation' over two decades ago came to fruition with the notoriety of Director Ken Russell's masterpiece 'THE DEVILS'-1971 and almost every Euro genre director worth his mortadella got on the band wagon either with full length features or brief sequences within their films.  Here we have Director Sergio Grieco's 'THE SINFUL NUNS OF SAINT VALENTINE' aka 'LE SCOMUNIATE DI SAN VALENTINO'-1974  which incapsulates every theme in the genre.  We have lesbian nuns, torture by sex starved priests, family banishment due to taboo relationships, and the proverbial burning at the stake motif. It has a terrific performance by leading lady Jenny Tamburi and scattered cameos by some great Euro actors: Franco Ressel who brought great villainy to many a Western; Bruna Beari as a neurotic nymphomaniac who has a habit of biting her lovers; and if you have a keen eye, you will recognize Corrado Gaipa who played the wheel chair bound Don who shelters Michael Corleone in the brilliant Sicilian sequence of Director Francis Ford Coppola's 'THE GODFATHER'-1972 here playing the sleazy inquisitor Father Onorio but the film never elevates beyond its exploitive images.  Director Grieco touched many genres from sword and sandal to Horror and also made the memorable Ken Clark Agent 077 quartet of films does fine with the material although the hap-hazard music score by Lallo Gorri switches from Classical guitar to boppy dance motifs like an on/off light switch causing extreme mood changes for this viewer. Redemption/Image Entertainment was one of the first companies to release a handful of rare Italian Exploitation titles in the late nineties on DVD and Laser Disc and are now getting the Blu-Ray treatment. This is the identical 2.35 negative used in the 1998 DVD release with nothing really changing except for the clearer 1080P image and mono sound in its Italian soundtrack with optional English Subtitles.  As with all of their Blu-Ray releases so far, its not worth the upgrade if you already have the DVD but if you are a fan if these types of films, you may want this for the collection.  Trailers for other Redemption releases are the only extras.",1370217600,,2193,5.094707520891365
959009,3,6305071438,"""The Sinful Nuns of St. Valentine"" takes place during the Spanish Inquisition.  Esteban (Paolo Marco) is falsely accused of heresy by the father of his girlfriend Lucita (Francoise Prevost) and is wounded while eluding capture.  Esteban takes refuge in the convent where Lucita has been banished by her father and is hidden by Joaquin, a servant.  Joaquin brings Lucita to Esteban and she tends to his wounds, but when Lucita's cellmate Josefa (Bruna Beani) is later found stabbed to death, the abbess (Jenny Tamburi) accuses Lucita of the murder.

Though this exploitative film is decently acted, it is mired in melodrama and sometimes unintentionally laughable in its cinematically bizarre evocation of the Inquisition, complete with erotic goings on, torture, and demonic characters.

In Italian with English subtitles, the Blu-ray release contains trailers of other releases in the label's Redemption series.",1370131200,,912,5.485714285714286

959011,1,6305071438,"Le Scomunicate se San Valentino (The Sinful Nuns of Saint Valentine) (Sergio Grieco, 1974)

I have to start off by asking how you can begin with a title like The Sinful Nuns of St. Valentine and manage to go so hideously wrong. And yet here I am, having watched Sergio Grieco's ridiculous attempt at making a nunspolitation flick last night, asking that very question, because The Sinful Nuns of St. Valentine goes so hideously wrong at every turn it could have, resulting in an incoherent mess of a movie that you would do very well to avoid at all costs.

The main thread of the plot involves Lucita (The Psychic's Jenny Tamburi), a novice at the Convent of St. Valentine during the days of the Inquisition. She's hopelessly in love with Esteban (The House by the Cemetery's Paolo Malco), who's currently being hunted by said Inquisition on suspicion of heresy and the murder of a bishop (which of these two things is more serious depends on which Inquisitor you happen to be talking to at any given time). Lucita's friend Josefa (When Men Carried Clubs and Women Played Ding-Dong's Bruna Beani in one of her final screen appearances) is also a novice, but has a lot more trouble, shall we say, conforming to the rules, which leads to a lot of topless flogging (and some turned-on nuns). On her way to an audience with the abbess (Spirits of the Dead's Franoise Prvost), Josefa is murdered, on the same night Lucita and Esteban plan to run away together; when Lucita is found wide awake and dressed in her bed, pretending to be asleep, the Inquisitor in charge of the case (The Godfather's Corrado Gaipa) assumes her to be guilty. Oddly, she does not protest her innocence, despite the abbess believing she had nothing to do with it...

...none of which actually makes one bit of difference considering none of it actually goes anywhere. Character motivations are subject to the whim of Grieco (who also wrote, ""loosely inspired by a drama by Victor Hugo"", we're told) rather than any attempt at continuity; these characters are nothing more than plot devices, and Grieco makes no pretensions to anything more. That's the main problem with this movie; one can't get invested enough in the characters to care once things start going really off the rails in the final half-hour; it's impossible to even hint at the events of same, but I think they're meant to inspire horror, and instead we get nothing so much as mild amusement. *",1368057600,,2431,4.72877358490566
959012,3,6305071438,"First of all, I am tired of people criticizing these Eurosleaze/horror films as if they were expecting some Spielberg epic. No one but NO ONE watches these for the ""story"", okay? Complaining about the lack of story singles you out as a doofus, because you are talking to the wrong crowd.
I preach to the converted, and as far as this film goes it has only a smattering of what we're looking for in this genre. The nudity is there...kind of. Not a lot of it, but enough to warrant some interest in the film throughout it's entire length. I was hoping this would be similar to ""The Convent of Hell"", an erotic graphic novel which tells the story of a group of nuns which mistakenly summons the devil, who then goes about raping them and turning them into nymphomaniacs. Not quite the plot here, as it happens.
A dash of very minor and brief lesbianism (one mild scene) is the best on offer here, and a ""sex"" scene between the abbess and the ""hero"" is completely forgettable. The end of the film, which is awash with topless nuns in some sort of weird, possessed freak out, is a decent climax. The main nun--a young girl falsely accused of murdering another nun (which is the basis of the story, if you care)--is the best looking, but unfortunately has almost the least on display. Of course, something which the director calls ""violence"" is present, but....whatever. Towards the end of the film a topless nun hanging is as extreme as it gets. However, there is a stirring moment when the nuns' true spiritual allegiance is revealed by a
creepy painting on the wall late in the movie.
The dvd notes claim it is all remastered, and maybe it is. And boy are they proud of how they transferred the audio to DAT and reprocessed it!
  The trailer for the film is in Italian with no subtitles, and Redemption has added some sort of 5 minute prologue during which some goth girl introduces the film (see editorial review above).
Now, it's great that Redemption has taken such an active interest in their products, but several minutes of jabbering by some lady with white contacts trying to be scary is just stupid. Skip to Chapter 2 where the film starts.
In closing: it isn't Jean Rollin or ""Bacchanales Sexuelles"", but it's adequate.",1056585600,45,2225,4.5879396984924625
959013,4,6305071438,"Although it isn't actually a horror film, it's still worth checking out if you're into the whole Euro horror/sex film thing.

959014,3,6305071438,"The Sinful Nuns of St. Valentine starts off suiting enough with some naughty, naked nuns and progresses onto more nun related nudity and so forth. However, I'm not quite sure why this is considered a horror flick. There is next to no gore or suspense or horror for that matter. The transfer is decent for this sort of film however the subtitles can be quite annoying. I gave this movie 3 stars because of the storyline, the acting, and the nun related nudity. However, if you are picking up this film for the ""gore"" or ""horror"" content, look elsewhere as this is not the film you want it to be.",987552000,8,594,4.409090909090909

The abbess is corrupt, and the Priest is power mad (during the Inquisition), the resulting corruption leaves the nuns in all manner of perversity.  Not the greatest in ""Nunsploitation, but not bad"".  There is a minor amount of nudity, compared to others of the genre.
One thing though, it seems as though many of these directors; Franco, Rollin, and others, though they might not have directed this type of movie, where the Catholic Church is involved, seem to suggest that despite the outward appearance of holiness, there are corrupt people.  This is true, but it is the people, not the principles, that are corrupt, and it doesn't matter if they wear a habit, or a Roman collar, but these people ultimately pay for their corruption.  With that said, mildly intriguing.",1430697600,2,947,4.709090909090909
