8581126,5,B00CF0EUNG,Viewed this on Sky TV and retained it on my Sky box Hard Drive. I often view it and it has become one of my favourite music pieces. It is perfect! I then wondered how I'd cope if I lost it off my hard drive - which I cannot down load from. To ensure I'd always have it I purchased the DVD. Thank you!,1472774400,,300,3.703125
8581127,5,B00CF0EUNG,"Harnoncourt, unquestionably one of the leading musician of the past half century, shows his age now when he enters the stage and stands in front of the musicians, but once he begins conducting you are aware of the fire of inspiration and dedication that still burns within him. I have his version of Beethoven's Missa Solemnis, recorded I believe the same year as this Mozart concert. I cannot dispel from my mind Leonard Bernstein's performance (only cd) which expresses the totality of the work as drama and spirituality. I do not think Harnoncourt believes in those aspects that impressed me with Maestro Bernstein. In any case, these early works of Mozart display the charm, intimacy, creativity and freshness we associate with Mozart's name, and Harnoncourt evokes all of the youthful energy of the works from his forces. Yes, this old man is animated by the same youthful energy we find in these works, despite their age. I thoroughly enjoyed the performances of all the forces - orchestra, chorus and soloists. And Harnoncourt's rigorous aesthetic actually produced music of surpassing lightness. Yes, the sounds take flight. This was the opening concert for a festival, it certainly must have put people in the right frame of mind and heart for what followed. That's how it affected me: I was cleansed, uplifted, ready for the rest of the day, whether it was work or play, I was in a good mood for what followed the music.",1414627200,,1430,4.888888888888889
