8327593,5,B001NOMOSI,"Starkly ambiguous starting from the first sequence in the zoo - which are more captive the humans or the animals?  The initial shots is visually striking in tracking with the leopard spots behind the fence grid.  The circumstances of the film shoot must be kept in mind - it started before the arrival of the Soviet tanks in August 1968, and  the crew returned from hiding to finish.  Nominally it seems to be about the evil and collaboration with the Nazis, but is really an allegory collaboration with evil in general and Communist state security in particular.  The ultimate comment is that if one collaborates with evil, one will be able destroy what one loves most (and by extension one's country and fellow citizens).  The ambiguity is heightened by the reference only to ""The Party"" - is it Nazi or Communist?  The surrealism heightens the disorientation and leaves the viewer struggling to establish a point of view, literally and figuratively.

I actually enjoy this film. It's more of a wake over beers than funeral with dirge, so typical of the Czechs. it says something profound while remaining lively and irreverent (to paraphrase Shaw on Mozart). In that regard, it's funnier than Don Giovanni, only somewhat darker.  (Admittedly it veers deliberately into Horror genre)  The Second Run DVD is beautifully produced. Had this film not disappeared from 1969 to 1989 it surely would have been considered a central classic of the Czech New Wave.",1356912000,,1455,4.950617283950617

8327595,5,B001NOMOSI,"Quite an amazing film, this, by Juraj Herz. A kind of allegory of Nazism, nominally set during the Second World War, about an eccentric cremator (hypnotically played by Rudolf Hrusnsk) who gradually becomes more and more megalomaniacal as the story proceeds, shot with deliberately expressionist techniques. It convincingly shows how people were able to make themselves believe in ideas of superiority and racial purity. Echoes of Polanski's 'Repulsion' are hard to resist, as well as comparisons with David Lynch, who you might imagine being influenced by it  ... The excellent U.K. DVD (Second Run) has a nice little intro by the Quay Brothers. This review is based on my viewing of the U.K. Second Run DVD.",1232841600,10,709,5.112068965517241
8327596,5,B001NOMOSI,"Quite an amazing, chilling film, this, by Juraj Herz. A kind of allegory of Nazism, nominally set during the Second World War, though you never actually see any German soldiers or fighting, about an eccentric cremator (hypnotically played by Rudolf Hrusnsk) who gradually becomes more and more megalomaniacal as the story proceeds, shot with deliberately expressionist techniques. It convincingly shows how people were able to make themselves believe in ideas of superiority and racial purity. Of all the films I've seen that attempt to show the twisted logic that enabled anti-Semiticism to grow and become the monster it did, this is one of the most  compelling. Echoes of Polanski's 'Repulsion' are hard to resist, as well as comparisons with David Lynch, who you might imagine being influenced by it  ... The excellent U.K. DVD (Second Run) has a nice little intro by the Quay Brothers.",1232668800,2,890,5.13103448275862
