2901550,5,B000TJ6OZ2,"I own a number of dance workouts and this is my favorite so far.  There is a  step guide in a separate chapter, which can be used to learn the steps in half time.  This is great because Jennifer does not have to slow down the tempo of the workouts to teach the steps in half time.  The step guide is a fabulous idea and makes this DVD superior to most dance workout routines on the market.  Because of my familiarity with dance DVD's, I only had to do the step guide once, but it was very helpful.

During the workouts, Jennifer still introduces each step with the feet first, followed by adding the arms. And she does the typical build of multiple steps for each routine.  To learn the routines, I focus on learning the steps first and then I add the arms in later attempts.

Jennifer is an excellent instructor.  She does a great job of providing good advance cues for step changes.  She also cues ""left or right"" that is the opposite of her left or right (mirror form), so it is easy to follow her lead.

Potential customers may be put off by the fact that this is a hip hop dance routine.  Never fear.  I really liked mixing things up from the usual Latin and Jazz routines.  But, be ready for a lot of hip action.

I am at an age (54) and weight where my knees do not tolerate a lot of abuse.  I was still able to do almost all of the routines or I could easily modify what Jennifer was doing to be a little more knee friendly.  (No frog stretches for me!)

All in all, I highly recommend this DVD for people who want some exercise with a lot of variation and a high fun factor.",1202428800,379,1583,4.134426229508197
2901551,4,B000TJ6OZ2,"I really enjoyed this DVD.  Like the other reviewers, it's a lot of fun and time flew by.  The instructional chapter was great where you can learn to do the moves first before attempting the rest of the DVD.  I've tried the other DOTI DVDs and this one is my favourite!",1202428800,2,269,4.235294117647059
2901552,5,B000TJ6OZ2,"This is a great workout. I enjoy it very much, it gets the blood pumping. I work out with this about 3 times a week and I love it!",1200960000,3,130,3.5172413793103448
2901553,5,B000TJ6OZ2,I have to say I totally love this workout. Jennifer is my all-time fave instructor because I understand the way she cues and the way she moves. Her smile doesn't look fake and she looks like she enjoys what she's doing. I have a lot of exercise dvd's in my collection and this is one I use when I have a day when everything just sucks. It makes me move and it makes me feel so much better about myself. I love the moves - they feel new and can be a little challening at first - and I want them to be. Once or twice a week it fits perfectly in my routine. Buy it if you like Jennifer's other dvd's (or any other Dance Off The Inches or Prevention-dvd's) - you'll love it.,1200614400,6,670,3.9703703703703703
2901554,4,B000TJ6OZ2,"This is a great DVD. It's a lot of fun and one that you won't dread doing if you add it to your collection. However, I have been dancing for over 20+ years, all different styles, from ballroom to hip hop and I have found it difficult to get all the steps down my first time trying this workout. That doesn't mean it's not doable, but it WILL take you a few workouts to get the choreography, arm movements and flicks. In the meantime, you should listen to Jennifer and do what you feel rather than worrying about how you look.
Having said that though this is still a great heart-pumping cardio and even if you don't get every move down, you will get a good workout since you are constantly moving. The step guide tutorial is helpful but doesn't allow too much practice (you practice a step 3-4 times before moving on) so repeated viewings help, but nothing is better than doing the steps in the workout itself.
I love Jennifer Galardi's workouts, her choreography and personality. And am I the only one who thinks she looks just like Jennifer Aniston?? lol Her cuing and form are great as always and she has just the right amount of pep. And I love her process of starting off a move and then building on it so you can perfect the base move and then add arms and styling.
This is a great DVD if you are looking for a little more of a challenge in your dance workouts (those of you who use the 10 Minute Solution DVDs know what I mean), the time goes by rather quickly and she does incorporate some great, fun and sexy dance moves. Go Jennifer!",1200009600,20,1542,4.302405498281787
2901555,5,B000TJ6OZ2,I love this DVD! You can learn the more difficult steps ahead of time by using the instructional portion of the DVD. Then you learn 3 different styles of hip-hop for the aerobic part. The whole DVD is a lot of fun and you forget that you are exercising because you're just having a great time!!! This DVD is for beginners and intermediates. Advanced exercisers may need a little more.,1199059200,21,384,4.5
2901556,4,B000TJ6OZ2,"DOTI Hip Hop Party, led by Jennifer Galardi, is a party in a box!  Very fun hip hop moves...time just flew by!  The workout runs 41 minutes with warmup and cooldown.

Unlike the previous DOTI's (which have pretty simple choreography), with this one you might want to actually view the step guide before jumping in...there are several moves that Jennifer says she covered in the step guide, she just starts the move in the workout with very little instruction and I was lost a couple of times!

The music in this DOTI is Much Better than the music in the other ones...it very much matched the routine.  Hip Hop Party is also more intense than any of the other DOTI's...and more fun as well!

The only reason I didn't give this one 5 stars is that it's quite difficult to do on carpet.  Lots of twisting movement that can torque your knees if you're doing this one on a carpeted surface.  I had to modify LOTS to make this workout work on my living room carpet.

Highly recommended to intermediates with dance experience AND a non-carpeted surface to work out on!",1198454400,173,1061,4.513089005235602
2901557,5,B000TJ6OZ2,"Finally!  I have finally found a workout that i wouldn't be embarrassed if my husband caught me doing it. The moves make you feel like your in a music video, and the music stays stuck in my head all day. I really loved the incorporated different parts of the world into the dancing the most.  It had a very sexy and modern feel.  I have many many dvd's which will soon be collecting dust for a while.  Jennifer has become my fav instructor.  She does such a thorough job leading you into the next steps verbally so you don't have to rely visually to keep up.  This way you can really get into it! Since purchasing this dvd, i have ordered all of Jennifer's dvd's.  I am a huge advocate of dvd workouts. My friends always take my word on dvd workouts, since i have lost 60 lbs in one year without going to the gym once.  Thank you Jennifer for making such a fun workout!",1198022400,10,869,4.192771084337349
2901558,5,B000TJ6OZ2,"I love this dance workout.  I own many dance videos and  this one is definitely going to be one of my favorites.  Very fresh and innovative new moves.  Lots of body swaying and hip shaking.  It is very dancy, not aerobic style at all.  I felt like a real dancer while still getting an excellent workout.  This will take me a few times of doing the video before I will get all the moves down.  But I love how it is consistent with Jennifer's other videos in that it is structured into different parts.  I can choose to do one part or all three.  Love this video and love Jennifer!",1197331200,2,579,4.181818181818182
2901559,4,B000TJ6OZ2,"Jennifer Galardi sure can dance.  I cannot (well, not like her) and so this can be a little frustrating because you want to get the moves down, but some are involved.  Having said that, this is a fun workout and even if you don't do the moves exactly, you will still reap the benefits of having done a half hour or so of cardio.
The Old-School style of dance is my favourite here.  She takes some time to help you learn the moves, but you'll possibly need to watch this several times to get it right.  I like the Throw Down moves and the Slithers.  The 15 minute tutorial on how to do the hip hop style is helpful, but as long as you don't concentrate too hard on perfecting your moves, you'll have fun too and enjoy this as much as I do.",1196380800,97,738,4.097222222222222

2901565,3,B000TJ6OZ2,"I'm a very average at zumba - definitely nothing special, with no background in dance. I got this video for the weeks I can't get to my class, but it was just a little too easy for me. Not quite aerobic enough for someone in their early 30s in middling shape. The last dance was the closest to what I was looking for, and if they'd all been at that level it would probably have been okay. Probably better for someone who is just starting out.",1468195200,,442,4.151162790697675

2901576,2,B000TJ6OZ2,Tried to cancel this order but wasn't quick enough I guess. I realized I had this already the morning after I ordered it. So I thought well I'll give it a try. I'm sure it would be a great workout for some one with coordination but I didn't even finish the opening step guide before I was frustrated and annoyed that I had wasted 15 min just trying to learn the steps (and failing) I bought the Tracy Anderson cardio dance at the same time and I do like her. I wish I was more advanced so I could do these dances I'm sure they work even more muscles. It's just not for me.,1454198400,,572,4.026315789473684

I was hoping to get more fit and gain more confidence in myself as well and I have to say, I tried this dance video for over a week and it shook my confidence even lower. I know there's a learning curve with these dance videos to learn the steps and the order of them. I have 2 other Dance Off the Inches videos and I love them both (Country Line Dancing and Firm Up). However, the instructor in this one just goes too fast for me. She does not teach the steps to the dances in pieces of slowly, she doesn't lead at all, so you have no idea what step is next until she's already done it and you're left standing there feeling like an incompetent idiot the whole time. I could not get the hang of these steps and it was annoying that she doesn't lead you at all. If you're not real coordinated or not already a dancer, I do not recommend this particular video.",1429747200,,988,4.097938144329897

There apparently is a guide that breaks down the moves, but I didn't look at that (I pick up choreography pretty well). 2. I did get a good work out. 3. It's only about 40 minutes long, so I may use it on Fridays when I just want to get a quick workout in. Would I buy it having seen/done it? NO.

I'm sure I looked like a total idiot trying to do the same moves (even during the lesson)  I wouldn't be surprised if there is a video of me on you tube somewhere.

I workout with this DVD several times a week and combined with the atkins diet and this DVD I've lost about 20 pounds already.
Best workout purchase so far.",1398988800,3,442,4.6075949367088604

Jennifer was outstanding with her instructions in the Guide and I was able to follow along without hurting myself. :-) I've had 3 back surgeries and this really helped me get back to basics. I didn't feel like I had to rush through it and be perfect at it. She lets you know when it is time to pop and I love it...,1398038400,,364,4.0

1. half the girls were very attractive, so that was a plus.
2. Jennifer comes across as charming and personable.
3. The dancing is not too hard to follow, i thought, even if you don't go over the dance steps beforehand. imho.

cons:
1. the exercise portion is not broken down into different sections, in case you want to rest or just do one portion that day.
2. the dancing did not make me lose my breath or get a good aerobic exercise.",1395705600,,442,4.261904761904762

2901651,5,B000TJ6OZ2,"OMG I just rec'd this video and I just know this is going to be amazing. I've looked at clips of MANY hip hop workout videos both on Amazon and YouTube, and this is the first I've seen that is actually hip hop the whole time.

Many others SAY they're going to be hip hop, but they're more like glorified aerobics class with some sort of hip hop moves blended in. This video makes it seem like I'm REALLY going to learn a lot of hip hop moves by doing it.

It seems like it's going to be a great pace as well. Fast enough that I'll get a good workout, but the step guide portion, which is separate from the workout video, will allow me to learn the steps apart from getting the workout.

If you're wanting to actually learn real hip hop, while getting a workout, I highly recommend!",1394064000,,781,4.158940397350993

Not only is the instructor great at leading the viewer through the dances, but she has a great attitude and is very positive.

2901666,5,B000TJ6OZ2,"I purchased this DVD last year and finally gave it a try this year. I was worried I wouldn't be able to keep up with instructor or do the dance moves. So here's what I did: I watched the Step Guide first and did one segment of the 44 minute program every day. Eventually I built my stamina up to where I was doing 2 segments, 3 and then finally the whole routine. If I thought I was doing the wrong step during the routine I faked it(because we ladies are all good at faking it) and then after I was finished I went back over the move and practiced it until I got it right. I discovered that not only was I burning calories and getting a fairly toned midsection,but I actually ENJOYED working out as opposed to just exercising to get it over with. This DVD is fun and I can shake it like a fool in my living room. No one has to see me, and I get a good workout in too. It's a win-win situation! My advice: if it seems intimidating then just do a little bit each day and work up to it. Btw, I'm 40 ish, and a former couch potato and this got me in shape fast.",1380153600,3,1058,3.925581395348837

I likes that she has the step guide and the steps were not too hard.  I wish her music was better but other than that for 10 bucks it is great!

It should be noted that Hip Hop is not my favorite dance style (I like it but prefer Jazz or Ballet), but I still love this dvd.  I also think it gives a little more intensity than the other workouts in this series, which is also a plus.

2901689,5,B000TJ6OZ2,"i just counted, I have 7 exercise DVDs that I rotate through (not counting the 3 or 4 I donated to the library used book shop) and this is currently my favorite.

It was genius to create a step guide. The more experienced exercisers will say how ""boring"" a DVD was in a review but what I think they are reacting to was how *every* video had to teach you a grapevine or tap step. If they didn't, then the beginners would complain.

I felt like there was alot more dancing and less of the""you are doing great"" comments than other videos have. This video moves along at a good pace. The last segment is quite fast. I would have appreciated the final step up in speed to have come earlier in the DVD but just as there are ways to modify down, you can always modify up by taking a move deeper or really throwing your arms into a move.

My final comment is that I would have felt stupid trying these hip hop moves out in a gym situation where I am older than 75% of the class and considerably flabbier after two 9 pound babies. I could do this in the privacy of my own home and not have to worry about other people's reaction to my unfortunately ample tummy doing those rolls!

The only reason that I'm giving it four stars instead of five is that it is quite a workout. I'm used to the 10 Minute Solution with Jennifer, which is a workout, but much less intense and I expected this one to be more similar than it is. This DVD will definitely make you sweat.

2901742,4,B000TJ6OZ2,"With over 250 reviews here for this disk already, my one may not make any difference, but I did want to mention that parts of the routines may be stressful to spinal disks. I have been using Jennifer Galardi's Cardio Hip Hop disk regularly without any problems, but I do have to modify the moves that involve too much twisting or fast impact. The first time I worked out to that disk, the twisting moves stressed my bulging lower back disk.  This Hip Hop Party disk did so even more, with its many more twisting moves and hops.  I was in a lot of discomfort for a week after the first time. I tried it a second time today, modifying moves to minimize or eliminate twists and impacts, so we'll see if that helps. I am avoiding just the last two moves completely for now, as they are the fastest and are higher-impact.

This disk has sexier moves and moves that feel more like dance than those on the CHH disk. I noticed a couple reviewers wrote that the moves are too hard, and it seemed like they gave up trying. Just like any new video I've tried, you have to practice them several times to feel comfortable with the moves and get them down pat, so don't give up so easily! The moves really are not that hard.  It just requires repetition. The more you do them, the sooner they will feel more natural.

Jennifer is a good dancer, good at giving instructions and good at calling out the moves. I like that her crew looks like a group of average, healthy women (ie: not models or pros), and it takes place in what looks like a small dance studio, which lends it a feeling of intimacy. Whether or not the moves are authentically hip hop does not diminish the fun. And it's a cheap disk, so why not try it?",1359244800,,1703,4.27639751552795

2901745,3,B000TJ6OZ2,"One thing that I really liked about this DVD was that she was ""mirror image"" to me.  When she said go to the left, it was to MY left, her right.  It was easier to follow that way.

I was disappointed with the music.  The music was barely heard in the background.  I didn't feel like I was dancing, but just doing an exercise routine.

Many of the moves were hard and require practice to get them down right.  But I felt there wasn't enough movement.  I'm sure I wasn't doing it as strongly as she was, BUT after 45 minutes I was barely breaking a sweat.  Worked out with it 3 times to make sure I was doing as much as I could.  I still couldn't do all the steps, but it doesn't account for the fact that I COULD have been moving more.",1358985600,,734,4.0

2901758,3,B000TJ6OZ2,"Though I enjoy this workout now, I already know I won't be using it for very long.  There are no modifications, and there is too much ""freestyle.""  It just makes it difficult to pace oneself.  And with so much freestyle time, I'm already starting to feel a little bored.

There is a step guide included in the chapters.  I used it twice before I did the workout.  It was very helpful.  The workout has a good warm-up followed by several dance segments, and the cooldown.  Jennifer starts out slow, but by the end of the workout, I am just pouring sweat.  That's a good thing, but the workout is really, really intense at the end.  I prefer having the most intense part of the workout between halfway and two-thirds towards the end.  Each routine embedded in the workout is a build; more and more steps are added to the routine as your work out.  Each routine has freestyle time in it as well.  OK, the freestyle really bugs me, I guess.  If there is an instructor, shouldn't she instruct?

There are some hops and jumps, just so you know this is not a no-impact workout.

I like the instructor and may buy another of her workout DVDs, just to see if her other workouts are a little different.  Can't beat the price, but you may want to consider paying more for a workout that combines aerobics with resistance training.",1357948800,,1319,4.451882845188284

Galardi's ""Hip Hop Party"" is a little challenging at first, but you will quickly catch on if you watch the accompanying step guide first. I have not had any professional dance training, but after viewing the step guide, I did the workout just fine, perhaps missing a step once or twice.

I can see myself doing this video again, perhaps once a week when I want to change up my running/weights routine. Note that you will need some room to do the routines, so push the coffee table and sofa out of the way! :)

Galardi is a great dancer -- much better than the four other women behind her. The only annoying thing in the video were shots of the other dancers -- they seemed to keep looking at each other and laughing, as if to say, ""Look at me, I'm on TV!""",1356048000,,848,4.29375

The instructor did a lot of talking and trying to act ""HIP"" she DID use authentic hip hop moves, I was born in that era, but the manner she delivered it was comically.

I play it once, some days 2 or even 3 times per day (like if it were practicing choreography); it is an excellent calories burner to reach my workout goal. Together with other routines (to keep variety) it has helped me to tone beautifully my body, specially my waist, while combined with better eating habits.

This video is not high impact aerobics. What it is are carefully selected body movements that will workout your arms, legs, abs, hips and butt under the guise of dance moves. If you stick to it in no time you will surprisingly have a more toned dancer's body. The trick to really feeling the burn is to learn the dance moves first with the 10 minute step guide. Once you learn the routine you can then move on to the lively 30 min workout. The better you know it the more effort you will put into it and the more you'll get out of it. For all you people with knee problems like myself there will be some moves you will not be able to do. For me it was only 1 move that I couldn't do. 99.5% of the video I could do. I enjoy it. It's one of those videos you won't get bored with.  I just bought it so I haven't lost weight with it yet but I get a good workout using it that I can do in a little over 30 min.

Yes it's fast pace and has a lot of dance moves, and that's what makes it a good cardio workout. Some say that the ""real"" hip hop moves are missing.

First of all, I'm not really sure how the second and third dances are considered hip hop. The first workout, yes, definitely had some hip hop edge to it, but I'm curious where the hip hop influence is in the second two. I love Jennifer's hip hop style, and I really felt it lacking here.

Secondly, I felt like these were perhaps some of Jennifer's weakest dance moves to date. Jennifer is a great instructor and she can break down and show you each step better than anyone else I've tried. You learn some fairly complicated steps without any frustration when working out with her. Here the steps are boringly easy. Walk up for four steps, walk in circles... what's the fun in that?

I actually enjoy the fact that this isn't true Hip Hop nor does it have traditional Hip Hop music.  Just a fun dance workout.  The music isn't brilliant, but not horrible either. You can watch clips of this at Collage or I'm sure somewhere on Youtube.

I really enjoyed the Dance Off the Inches Belly Dance (Bollywood) workout as well.

All of the Dance off the Inches series are fairly low impact, however, I have lost 5 lbs and about an inch in my waist within the last month just doing these workouts and some weight training at the gym. I am an advanced exerciser and have been working out for 20 years and normally do Cathe, Amy Bento, Kelly Coffey Meyer step, boot camp, kickboxing style workouts and didn't think these would do much since they are such low impact.  I wanted to learn all of the routines so I could add all the workouts into my mix.  Well, I enjoy all of them so much, they are all the cardio I have been doing.  I think since you use your hips and abs a lot in these workouts, I am losing more inches and toning up quicker.  So, don't let the low impact fool you!  If you enjoy these workouts and put some energy into them - you really will dance off the inches!",1297209600,,1489,4.189473684210526

First, the ""music"" they play in the background is bad beat loops.  I realize they probably can't use actual hip hop songs, but could they at least work with a producer who can give them decent beats to use.  Then there's the instructor with her ""are you serious?!"" comments - ""put a little bit of that urban shoulder into it""; ""you can throw me some face...whatever you want, cuz it's all about your ATTITUDE"".  I'm expecting ""like, oh my gawd becky"" to come out of her mouth any second. Lastly, the choreography is ridiculous!  The ""sexy"" segment makes me feel anything but sexy.

It's also a good ""me time"" while my baby naps. I've done another hip hop video (Lia Montelongo's Hip Hop Body Shop), so maybe that's why this wasn't too challenging to me, but I can see how it could be for first timers. Some reviews say they couldn't even break a sweat - WHAT?? You must be an awesome dancer then (or I must be really horrible :). Anyway, this is a good work out, it gives you that good-tired but still energetic feeling in the end. By the way, I recommend watching it first (without trying to follow), just to observe the moves, 'cause then they don't catch you so much by surprise. I haven't done the step guide and this has worked for me.

It looked like fun but i felt it required more skill and coordination than I have and I didn't make it all the way through, or feel like I enjoyed what I did do enough to try it again one day. Luckily, I checked it out from the library. But you might enjoy it. It's hard to say but maybe, f you have no experience with hip hop and aren't truly interested in getting some moves down to take to the club, pass it by.

2902068,4,B000TJ6OZ2,"Dance Off the Inches: Hip Hop Party is a little slow compared to other hip hop workouts, but it still is extremely cardio and a lot of fun to do.  Jennifer Galardi leads, and she has a really fun personality and teaching style.  The workout is divided into three totally different hip hop styles that are each fun to do in their own way.  The sections on the DVD are:

Warm Up - Jennifer starts out with a funky style march before going to some chest and hip isolations in this warm up.  Then she'll finish up with one or two more easy dance moves.  It's all very basic, but it's still effective.

Basic Hip Hop - This routine is a lot of fun, consisting of some funky dance moves that are pretty easy to pull off and really fun to do.  It consists of easy moves such as slides, marches, stomps, and butterflies, but Jennifer adds upper body style to make it more cardio and more funky.  It was definitely, my favorite of all the routines.

Sexy Smooth - Now this routine seemed to be a mixture of Jazz, Striptease, and Arabian dancing.  It didn't move too much over the floor, but it still managed to get your heart rate up.  There are a lot of moves in this dance that involve the hips, but there were also a few body roll moves, kick ball change moves, and more.  It definitely had a sensual feel to it which is a bit different from normal hip hop workouts.

World - Last was this routine that fused hip hop with Latin and Bollywood dance moves.  It was a lot of fun as it contained lunges, box steps, chest pumps, and more with some very fun arms that made it all the more fun to do.  This was definitely the highest impact of the three workouts, and it was a really nice fusion of dance.  NOTE: This is the same routine as the Cardio Dance download that is available here on Amazon, on exerciseTV, and on Jennifer Galardi's website.

Cool Down - The cool down was also amazing.  It had so many feel good stretches that stretched out the entire body.  It was a great way to finish the workout.

Step Guide - Also included on the DVD is a step guide that breaks down some of the moves slowly in order to allow you to learn them slowly and use them in the workout.  This makes it a great DVD for beginner exercisers/dancers while the intermediate/advanced dancers/exercisers may just want to jump right into the workout.  NOTE: The step guide is not included in the downloaded version of this DVD available here on Amazon Video on Demand.

Overall, this was an amazing workout although it went slower than normal hip hop workouts.  The three sections were all fun yet different enough to keep the interest of the viewer.  I would highly recommend it to all levels of exercisers and hip hop dancers.  It truly is a blast to do!",1280102400,7,2728,4.318897637795276
2902069,5,B000TJ6OZ2,"The video shows simple techniques to start with, it is really helpful for a beginner that doesn't have experience in hip hop.  It is fun and energectic.

this dvd might not be a very good option for people who r really fit and have been working out for years. i've been working out for 2 yrs now, and i have done rigorous workouts like kickboxing. and this workout made me sweat a lot. and i can feel my muscles working. what more can i ask for?

I love love that I am learning moves I see in the music videos.  I feel like I can go to any party and steal the dance floor.  The workout is fun and goes by fast.  She divided the video into three styles of hip hop: street, sexy and world.  The street dance steps are what you would see in a TLC, Michael Jackson or Usher video.  The sexy dance steps are what you would see in the Pussycat Dolls or Beyonce video and the World dance steps are what you would see in a Shakira or Slum Dog Millionaire video. I love the music.

I have gone to the step guide several times but she doesn't take a lot of time breaking it down and there is not very much time allotted for practicing the step after she shows you.

2902094,3,B000TJ6OZ2,"I read many of the reviews for this DVD prior to purchasing it, and against my better judgment assumed most people were just exaggerating or not used to exercising. I was already familiar with Jennifer Galardi having done one of her ab workouts on exercise tv on demand. In spite of wondering where the bloody hip hop was in the clip I watched on Amazon prior to purchasing, I pulled the trigger on making the purchase because Jennifer is a good instructor.

My first impression upon doing this DVD was that it was easy, slow and not in any way shape or form Hip Hop. Seriously... using the words ""hip hop"" in the title is like false advertising! Those words have no business being associated with this DVD or its content at all. But I let it slide because after completing the DVD (and the step guide) I was sweating, my abs felt tighter and I did feel as though I had worked out.

Jennifer is a very good instructor. The step guide is a huge asset to the DVD. I did the step guide before taking the plunge (per other reviews' advice) and it helped tremendously. She is easy to follow, the steps are relatively easy to do and to manipulate, and on the off chance you get lost or miss a step it is easy to catch up.

That is kind of where I run out of positive things to say about this DVD. I've said it before but I will reiterate... if you are looking for a true hip hop DVD, this is NOT the one for you! The music is so lame and is in no way hip hop at all. It sounds like some dude in his basement decided to try playing with a lame drum machine while using Tetris as his inspiration. It doesn't go w/ the name of the DVD, nor does it go with Jennifer's style or the moves she's teaching.

There are like two random old-school ""hip hop"" moves she throws into her routines, but that is it. I'm sorry, but the box step and kick-ball-change do not constitute hip hop dancing. And just because she says things like ""bring tha noise"" and ""I wanna see you partaaaayyy"" doesn't mean the routines are hip hop related.

I read a review prior to purchasing this DVD that said something like just because she's wearing cargo pants doesn't mean it is a hip hop DVD. I now know fully what that person meant. I tried to like this DVD and still do throw it into rotation. But I find that every time I do it now, all I can do is focus on the absurdity of the difference between what is in the title of the DVD versus what content is actually on it.",1277164800,10,2436,4.16348195329087

I purchased this based on the reviews from those at my level so had realistic expectations and hope I can guide someone like me. If you are an advanced exerciser who has familiarity with dance videos and can pick up dance steps quickly (most hip-hop videos have similar moves), you'll be doing this video easily on the first run and having fun. I think the moves are very simple. The down side is that they are also limited and repetitive so you'll get bored quickly with it, probably by the second or third viewing. Done alone, I don't feel ""worked out"" enough. However, it's  great to have it in your repertoire for variety, or to use as a fun warm-up with a little cardio before doing another toning video such as her Ballet Body which I really enjoy. The 2 done back to back (if you have time) complement each other well and provide a full workout for the advanced exerciser. I think Jennifer Galardi is a very good instructor.

Like any workout program, you get out what you put in. For me, that means in order to get my heartrate up I really have to make big moves and squat low. You could just go through the motions and not break a sweat but that is true of any workout DVD.

Jennifer Galardi is a great instructor! She is really up beat and clear and the whole thing is cued brillantly. I'm looking for other DVDs from her now!",1269475200,,697,4.08029197080292

Very upbeat, good music and the instructor is fun.  Really works the abs and back muscles.  Once you get the steps down, it takes about 30 minutes to get through the entire routine.  I didn't like the cool-down, stretch at the end because it relies on your own ability to balance and hold a stretch, but that's my opinion.

I'm quite a bit overweight and rather out of shape, and somehow this DVD didn't get my heartrate up.  Bringing groceries in from the car gets my heart going, yet somehow this dancing didn't.

So, to sum it up:  If you'd like to learn hip hop with a bunch of middleaged white women to the most boring music on the planet, buy this DVD!",1268092800,20,533,4.166666666666667

The steps in this video, for me, even with the step guide, were a little more difficult than necessary. That's not to say that they are very difficult at all- after a while I get it down just fine. I mean that the moves just weren't that fun or that great a workout for all the confusion I was experiencing. I've been to many dance classes that are totally fun and a totally great workout. This is only so-so on both counts.

First of all, it's difficult for me to know how to move my body when she's standing toward me in the video as opposed to in front of a mirror like I experienced in classes. This makes a big difference. Second, the music is just not much fun- it feels like cut and dry workout DVD music as opposed to something that will really get me moving. I don't know whether I should have expected anything different, but these were the two things that struck me.",1267315200,,953,4.236263736263736

2902204,5,B000TJ6OZ2,"This is Jennifer's best DVD. It is fast paced enough to be a good aerobic workout, but you could also take those sexy moves right out onto the dance floor, or onto the stage for a belly dance performance! The  moves are varied and the transitions are smooth, but you will have to work hard to keep up with it.

Don't be misled by the ""10 easy steps"" mentioned in the DVD description, however. This is not a beginner's workout. Although there is a step guide, the steps would definitely not be easy for a non-dancer. Even if you leave out the arm motions when you first start out (a good strategy to use with a new DVD), there are a lot of complex movements that involve a lot of hip action and torso motion, along with the steps.

You'll need good balance, lots of flexibility and quick reflexes to do this workout. If you have some dance/ aerobics experience, stick with it until you get it! As you start to master the steps, you will get hooked on this irresistible workout. Doing this regularly will give you a great dancer's body.",1262822400,,1034,4.375

2902206,5,B000TJ6OZ2,"The DVD is really well made. I believe that is advisable that you have a lithe bit of dance background, not because of the steps because they aren't difficult, but because of the pace. The choreography is really fast and you really have to loose yourself to dance. I am not a dancer but I used to go to dance classes in a gym and I didn't found it very difficult to keep up, but it really burns and if you contract the abs thought the dances it really gives you dancer abs.",1261353600,,473,4.096774193548387
2902207,4,B000TJ6OZ2,"I've had this DVD for about 6-8 months and I love it. I don't do it every day--I prefer to exercise outside, but for rainy/windy/too cold days, this is great. Usually when I start this workout, I am feeling sluggish, like I'd really rather sit on the sofa for an hour or something and I have the idea the workout is going to be a struggle, but after about 3-4 minutes, I get totally pumped and really start enjoying myself. The time flies by like nothing and before I know it the video is over.

Pluses:
I really like Jennifer Galardi's manner. She's peppy but not annoying and she's serious but not intimidating.
It's a good workout. I always feel sweaty and invigorated after.
It's an excellent rainy-day workout.
I have actually used moves from this workout on the social dance floor. I use the ""salsa walks"" all the time and the hip-cracks, too.
I have owned it for more than six months and have used it about 3 times a month in that time, and the program has not yet become either boring or irritating.

On the downside:
I don't think this is a workout for beginners. I've been dancing all my life and it seems easy to me, but I think the way she phrases some of the directions would not make sense to someone with no dance experience. For example: ""Put a body roll into it; make it a return.""

The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5--I don't know why fitness videographers ALWAYS feel compelled to cut away from the main person or just show their legs or something. It's probably artful, but I get confused when the camera shifts away from Jennifer to focus on her feet or on one of the other dancers.

The music is not what I would pick, but it's not horrible, either.",1260230400,,1683,4.333333333333333

So it's a great challenge, but also loads of fun, because it's got more of a dance feel than an aerobics feel.  Sometimes these sorts of dvds can be annoying becuase they are aerobics with a dance twist; this is more dance than aerobics.  Jennifer is very likeable, and the moves are very doable.

For tummy tone and legs tone I recommend Jillian Michael's ""No more trouble zones"".  This work out is fun and challenging.

2902249,2,B000TJ6OZ2,"I got this for my teens who want to both dance as well as exercise & tone their muscles. They are not experienced with hip-hop or street style dancing, so they thought it would be fun to learn this while exercising. I also did it with them for fun.

It is basically a good exercise video, but we all think it is a little challenging for beginners. The instructor does go through the basic moves before the exercise sequences, but she really goes through them too fast for beginner level dancers. It is more like what you would expect in an imtermediate-advanced level dance class, where the lead shows the choreography to the other dancers, and then they do it all together.

There is also no build-up from basic level to more advanced moves- it is just a relatively fast introduction to all of the moves, regardless of difficulty level, followed by putting them together in the dance sequence.
It would be better if this section was slowed down in time (slow motion) for the tricky moves, and if they spent more time going through the moves more carefully. The camera doesn't really show the angles well for learning the moves, either.

When all of the choreography is put together, it is too hard for beginners to follow along. Also, it is fast-paced and if you are not ready for some pretty strenuous cardio training, you will find it difficult to complete the sequences.

We are going to try some other more basic level videos to learn the basics and build up our skills, but we will keep this one for later, when we're ready to tackle it.",1251849600,11,1543,4.539568345323741

I would recommend this for younger people, there's quite a bit of jumping and other movements that aren't too easy on the knees.  I really liked doing it, though sometimes, especially because my laptops sound sytem is pretty awful, I kept losing the beat.  Would not recommend this unless you can turn it up pretty loud, because when Jennifer's talking the beat can be hard to hear at lower sound levels!

When I went looking for dvd or video to exercise with I wanted something that included my love for dance and finding this video has been very helpful.

First the instructor is very personable...she makes you want to do her moves, but has 4 people behind her of different work out levels. Are you new to work out...pay close attention to the chick in the red on the left rear of the group she's is low impact. Blue and yellow in the front which show hot to maximize the impact of the work out and the last helper is medium impact.

The moves themselves are very easy. There is a step guide if you get lost but honestly it's not really needed. The dvd ease you into the moves by isolating one part then adding the other parts gradually and before you know it you are completing an entire move. You feel it working in your legs and thighs easy. I used to have problems with dance workouts only getting my upper body involved this video includes your whole body your arms and chest, abs and hips, legs and thighs and everything in between.

Not only are the moves easy to do they are effective. I was 247 lbs when I started...I didn't look like it but trust me I felt every pound of it. I never been this big and so wanted to do something about it, diet alone will not lose your weight...it will hinder it from fluctuating which is a good thing in itself. But within a week of doing only the first hiphop routine I weighed in at 235 lbs...Now I've moved on to the sexy, sassy hip hop routine and I cannot wait to see how that benefits my body! Everyone should do this...it's fun and effective and easy. And you don't have to be watching the DVD to do it...grab a MP3 player and get jammin'...it's really hard to forget how to move like that.",1247097600,14,1959,4.289189189189189

Coming from someone who loves a hard workout, who normally loves to work out to Billy Blanks Tae bo boot camp (excellent also), this is a wonderful in between workout. In her dance moves, she really focuses on cardio and abs..I would highly recommend this dvd",1242259200,,360,4.231884057971015
2902330,5,B000TJ6OZ2,"I'm currently training for a marathon, but I needed something to help me with my core cross-training--and this sure did! I run an average of 25-30 miles a week but despite this, I was sore after the first day of using this video. The sides of my body got a work-out like I didn't even know you could experience.

Also, much to my surprise, this worked my calves. I thought I had calves of steel given my running mileage, but the little bit of Latin up on the toes really works your legs too.

Jennifer Galardi is a great instructor too. I own a number of different exercise videos and she by far is my favorite instructor. She's real, fun and easy to understand. The step guide is a must! I went through it the first three times I used the video--if you've never danced before like me--you're going to spend a few sessions learning to understand all that is happening. I loved this video so much, I've begun taking a street/hiphop dance class--something I never thought I'd do.

You get cardio and strength training;the steps are designed to cover both territory. I'm so glad I bought it. It probably helps that I love to dance and have been dancing for years.

Some of the moves can be a bit complicated but nothing that cannot be learned by exercising the steps a bit. I guess this was also exciting for me as I love learning new moves.

Anyway, this program moved to the top of my prefferences since my first attempt and it is still there since. I ordered other Jennifer Galardi dance programs after seing this one, with the hope that I'll find some of the same exciting approach to dance&fitness that I found here.",1240272000,,707,4.595238095238095

So, I thought that I might be able to do this dvd with little trouble.  However, it is clear to me that when I actually have to count and learn choreography, I'm not so coordinated to do it!

If you are not coordinated, you will be very frustrated doing this video.  The step guide is fantastic in teaching the moves.  But, when you incorporate them into a routine, I personally got very lost in some of the more complex changes.

I only paid $7 for it, so I'm not out a lot of money.  I will continue to try it out until I get it.  There's no question, you will bust a sweat really quickly.  It's definitely a work-out!",1240185600,,756,4.0134228187919465

Jennifer helps you every step of the way.  She builds on the routine by repeating steps several times before adding another one.  I highly recommend this video.",1239408000,,332,4.377049180327869

I think I may just play the DVD on mute and listen to my own music!",1239235200,,341,4.0
2902393,4,B000TJ6OZ2,"First let me say that I have danced all my life. I am not a professional, but I've always picked up choreography very easily.  That being said, I found this video to be lots of fun!  I did do the ""step guide"" before beginning the actual workout, which made the rest of the video run very smoothly. By no means did I find the steps difficult.  They are very basic dance moves, although I don't know how hip- hop they are. They actually reminded me a lot of cheerleading choreography I've done, a kind of gentrified hip- hop with sharp moves and isolations. This is by no means true street hip- hop choreography, so if that's what you want this is not the video for you! If you just want a fun easy video you can jump right into, this is it.

You start with a pretty basic dance warm up, gradually learning steps (although it goes pretty quickly so if you are not a dancer you should do the step guide first!) and connecting them to form the first combination. There are three combinations, each one increasing its pace and complexity.  They are fun and vary a little in style.  I also like that they are itemized on the main menu- so you can just do one or two combinations if you don't have time for all three.  There's also a cool down at then end.

I really like Jennifer the host. She is not one of those super perky instructors who annoy you well before the video is over.  The girls in the background are clearly of varying dance training, which I like.  I wouldn't say any of them seem like professional back up dancers.  This makes you feel like they're just doing this to have fun, not show off to each other. Also, you don't feel like you need to prove yourself while doing this work out.

Even though I didn't find this choreography challenging, I definitely got a good cardio workout! If you do the entire video at full pace you will be sweating and smiling!",1239235200,,1869,4.308571428571429

The instructor, Jennifer, is motivational and provides cues prior to each move making it extremely easy to follow once you've learned the steps.  I was an aerobics instructor years ago, so it didn't take much to learn and perfect the moves.  The only issue I have (as is usually the case with most exercise DVDs) is the lack of stretching and floor work concentrating on the abdominals, upper body, and hips/thighs.

Even the step guide was tough.  I had to watch each move several times - sometimes in slow motion before I had a grasp of what she was doing.  She would go very slowly with the feet moves which were easy and then go very quickly on the arm moves which were more difficult.  Hip Hop is not a good fit for me.

It has been such a bad winter in MA that I have done this video more than usual.  There's not too much introducing or talking about the other dancers, which I find irritating.

It was also important for me to find a program that was fun to do so I would be more likely to stick with it. OMG, this is definitely the workout for me.  It is definitely fun and definitely gets your heart rate up while teaching new dance moves.  Although the dance moves are a bit challenging in the beginning the instructor makes an effort to take it slow at the beginning in order to give the audience a chance to learn the moves.

I'm not sure where some of the previous reviewers got confused but the title does say DANCE of the inches HIP HOP party. Real talk? This is exactly what you will get! I really am not a fan of cardio (though I realize it's necessary) I prefer weight training. But this is more like my memories of dancing the night away at ""the club""..sans the drunken come ons. Don't be a surprised if you start feelin your inner ""video vixen"" emerge. If you were to see the dance moves first, you might dismiss them and declare that you couldn't do them. However, with the way Jennifer breaks down each step into parts and then combines each part to create the whole step, I would agree that this IS along the lines of HIP HOP for beginners...(or at least those of us who are a little out of practice. It's 1 part old skool hip hop, 1 part video hottie, and 1 part Bollywood/Latin combo. Agreed, some of the moves may be difficult on carpet, but I think they can be modified accordingly.

I have a couple other dance videos and I don't get the WHOLE body workout feel I do with Jennifer, who leaves me feeling great afterwards.  Only negative thing is I don't recommend this video for beginners with little to no dance experience though. I've danced all my life and can catch on quick enough to get the full benefits of the workout...whereas a beginner might get too frustrated at the advanced dance steps.",1225324800,,568,4.461538461538462

I don't pretend to be any kind of a dancer, and certainly have never even tried to do Hip Hop, but it is fun to try it in the privacy of my own home.  I really like that the setting is a studio type & the 4 extra ""dancers"" are of a variety of skill levels, so I don't feel like an idiot and I can see that there are different ways to do each move (hand movements and such).  The instructor doesn't spend a lot of extra time going over each movement so it doesn't get dull nor does she interrupt the flow, which are problems I have with the two other videos I bought at the same time.

However, it was very fun once you let yourself get into it, and that makes it seem like you are not even working out. It's one of those video's for if you are just starting that will pump you up to get you in the fitness routine, and it is also for the more intermediate execiser for those days when you just don't feel like doing a hard hard workout and just want to have fun but yet still break  sweat.

I've done video-led workouts for 20 years, and Jennifer is my favorite: 1)She has a perfectly inspiring body, yet doesn't seem to have an attitude or a pride problem 2) She teaches choreography very well without being too easy or condescending 3)She's excited and happy and encouraging, and yet somehow she's not annoying in any way at all!

Jennifer is pleasantly upbeat without being annoying.  You can tell she has dance training, her moves are precise and well-chosen.  The step guide is wonderful, I can go through and get each move down pat before I start the workout.  If you're looking for genuine hip/hop dance moves, you won't really find it here, but remember that this is an aerobic workout, not a dance routine. There is a little bit of African, Samba and jazz-like dance in one of the segements, and all of them are fun and upbeat.  The music is good, too.  For people who are already in shape, this might not prove strenuous, but it got me sweating.

Not having exercised really in 2 years, i am out of shape. The workout really made me break a sweat, and, a day later, I felt obliques and upper thigh muscles aching (in a good way.) I have numerous dance workout DVDs; this one, is definitely a keeper. I'd say, even without the dance background, try to go through the step by step section, and give it a try. Its worth it.

HIGHLY recommend this workout, it was a blast and i had so much fun i got through the whole thing. recommended for beginners as you can stop early after the first few sections or even advanced as you can really put your whole body into it, its all up to how much you put yourself into it. good workout for all stages. i feel good and im looking better.

2902739,4,B000TJ6OZ2,"I got this dance video because I had a baby not too long ago and I wanted to tighten back up.  I will admit, I got this one and two others ones, and this one is my favorite.  However, it is not a cardiovascular workout.  I like fast paced workouts, and this one definitely is not--I don't see how the person who left the feedback saying you must have hiphop dancing experience got that notion from...

It is effective, I will say.  I haven't noticed much of a change in my stomach, but my legs and arms are tightening up.

I did not go through the step guide..I went straight to the routines.  I will say, maybe one or two of the moves take a little more coordination, but after doing the video a second time, I got the hang of them.  Now I have all 3 routines memorized, but I like the first and second one better than the third.

I think I am going to use this routine every other day, and use a more cardiovascular, high-paced one on the other days.

Jennifer is a very good teacher, however.  I used to be a cheerleader, and it took me a while to catch on to the dance moves.  However, Jennifer teaches in a way that is not too fast, and she makes it easy to learn.

HOWEVER--I am only 20 years old, and I am not too badly out of shape, so this may be bad advise for for someone older and/or more out of shape.",1210550400,9,1314,4.046511627906977

I even went to the section of the DVD with individual steps, she goes over them once and then speeds it up. It then proceeds to the next step. It's very hard to keep up with.

It was extremely helpful to go through the step training so when I actually ran the exercise session, I was able to follow with little difficulty the first time.

Each chapter teaches diff styles of moves, but you will always repeat previous learned moves from that chapter & also previous chapters.
I liked the moves, they weren't watered down or if they were it was only a little. Jennifer is relaxed here, she was never annoying in my opinion, she only mostly gives you cues to help move your body right which is what you need most, no fake encouraging or weird personal tidbits others might give. With the step guide, I had no problem following & though I didn't get it perfect, I never felt frustrated because I knew I'd get it within a couple tries for two reasons: The step guide was a great help & helps to keep the pace going so you don't get bored or lower your heart rate & because the actual speed of the moves is a little slower then it should be. The moves are done more like 3/4 speed & I felt like I was a little stuck on learning speed. It wasn't that annoying, but I swear I could tell even Jennifer wanted to go a faster rate. If she did, this would be perfect. As it is, this is great for beginners & a lot of fun.

2902775,4,B000TJ6OZ2,"The first time I tried this DVD, I didn't like it.  I thought the moves were much too complicated and I would never get them down right.  (It should be noted that I have absolutely no dance experience and don't generally do aerobics type DVDs either.)  I didn't touch the DVD again until I was getting bored with my yoga DVD.  I've since done it twice, and it's grown on me.  Most of the moves can be learned after a few viewings.
  The Sexy Smooth Hip Hop portion is my least favorite.  The steps aren't particularly hard to understand, but that section has a lot of hip rolls and body rolls.  As someone who's not so good at pulling off hip rolls, it makes that section of the DVD frustrating for me.  I can always skip that section, though.
  The Basic Hip Hop section was the easiest in my opinion, especially after going through the step guide.  I also liked the World Hip Hop section, which I thought had the most interesting moves.

CHAPTERS  (Note:  The chapter listing in the booklet is incorrect and leaves out the World Hip Hop chapter.  This is the chapter listing from the DVD itself with my notes on the contents and length of each section.)
1.  Introduction - This is basically what you see in the video preview on this page - Jennifer's introduction of the DVD. (1.5 minutes)
2.  Warm Up - Marching in place, shoulder rolls, isolation stomach moves, hip rolls (4 minutes)
3.  Basic Hip Hop - Slides, punches, butterfly, throw down, pelvic thrusts (10.5 minutes)
4.  Sexy Smooth Hip Hop - catwalk, hip rolls, kickball changes, body rolls, drags (11.5 minutes)
5.  World Hip Hop - lunges, salsa twists, box step, chest pumps and pops, heel digs, shimmy shakes (11 minutes)
6.  Cool Down - breathing exercises, plis, stretches (4.5 minutes)
7.  End Credits (1 minute)

Also included:  Step Guide (15.5 minutes, despite the fact that the box says it's only 10 minutes)

PROS
- The instructor seems to be genuinely enjoying herself.
- The moves are pretty fun and interesting, so it's not boring.
- It's actually a good workout.
- You don't have to lie on the ground or own any weights, bands, or other supplies.
- Most of the routines consist of one movement to which she then gradually adds more movements, so you have a little bit of time to get used to doing the movements and transitioning from one to another.
- The movements match up well with the music, so if you get off it's easy to pick back up again.

CONS
- Some of the instructors comments are annoying:  ""Show me what you got!""  ""Smooth like honey!""  ""You guys are getting hot!""  ""Oxygen is free, guys!""  ""Like you're taking off your shirt!""
- A couple of movements may be difficult for people with bad knees, particularly the butterfly.  Overall, though, I think this workout should be doable for most people.
- Like some of the other reviewers said, there are a couple of moves that are difficult on carpet, including the slides.  For these, I just accept the fact that I will not be able to slide as smoothly as she does since I'm on carpet.
- The step guide would have been better if it had gone a little slower and included more practice of the steps.  The box boasts that the step guide is it's only ten minutes (which is wrong, it's 15.5 minutes long), but I think it would actually be better if it were longer because that would mean that she was taking the time to teach you the moves thoroughly.  Think about it - she has to teach you 10 different moves.  Even at 20 minutes, that would mean she was only spending 2 minutes on each move.  She does a good job with the time she has, starting with the legs and then adding the arms, but for some of the moves she only puts it all together and does it at tempo once or twice, so I found myself skipping back a few times before I got them right.  I would have preferred if she repeated the moves a few more times so that I would have time to mimic her and then make any adjustments necessary to get the moves down completely.",1208217600,132,3957,4.389270976616231
2902776,5,B000TJ6OZ2,I like this video because it is a fun way to exercise.  You are dancing so it makes the time fly by and the dancing you do is exciting and fun.,1206835200,,143,3.6129032258064515
2902777,4,B000TJ6OZ2,"This is really really fun to do doesn't even feel like a work out although you can feel it later!!  My only problem is with the slides, it was hard to do on the carpet!!

I have a vast collection of workout DVDs and have never been compelled to write a review about any of them. But this by far, hands down is the best most fun workout I've done.

About the video:

First, it would be very beneficial to view the Step Guide. The steps aren't difficult, but it makes everything gel together better when you know what's coming up next for the routines.

Second, Jennifer's cues are way better than a lot of the other aerobic videos out there. She has high energy and makes you want to dance.  The best part is if you miss a step just dance, shake it, pop it, feel free to express yourself any way you want and step right back into the groove of the routine.

Third, the music is great.  I'm very picky about my music and this makes you want to dance.  It's not that fast techno stuff, or the ""typical dance aerobic"" music with a sped up tempo to make it fast enough to ""dance"" to.  The beat of the music just makes you want to POP it!

Fourth, it's just plain fun!  You're getting a great workout, legs are burning, abs are tight, heart rate is up there. It's not like the usual boring cookie cutter aerobic routines that still remind me of the 80's and 90's even though it's 2008 and videos produced within the past few years still have that 80's and 90's feel to it.

Usually it takes me a while to warm up to a workout routine because I have to workout and working out is monotonous and boring but good for you. But this one quickly hooked me.  It really felt like I was at the club back in the day with the girls, and when a good song came on we'd all scream ""I love this song,"" run out to the dance floor shaking our booties and just having CRAZY, SEXY, SWEATY FUN!",1204675200,22,1816,4.166189111747851

2902781,5,B000TJ6OZ2,This tape is fun.  Very easy to follow.  I have definately noticed after a few weeks not so much losing weight but I believe inches.  My pants fit differently.  Makes me more motivated to do this,1203292800,6,195,4.333333333333333
2902782,5,B000TJ6OZ2,"I enjoy this video. It never feels like a workout at the time because it's fun, but the day after doing it, I always feel more toned and can tell I did something. I really like being able to work my middle without having to lay on the floor. I have a good sense of rhythm, so I have no trouble with getting the steps. For those that struggle, there is a step guide at the beginning.",1202860800,7,382,3.9740259740259742
2902783,4,B000TJ6OZ2,"This is a pretty good workout; Jennifer Galardi is a good instructor, she is not overly perky or annoying and she does a good job leading into the moves. My only caveat is that it is not quite the ""dance"" video I was expecting. It does get your heart rate up, and I could feel my abs getting a workout, but the dancing is not really what I would consider dancing. All in all a good workout though.",1202688000,2,397,4.102564102564102

8209616,5,B000TJ6OZ2,This DVD really helped me to loosen up rather than feel kind of wooden in my body within the privacy of my living room was part of my journey of moving beyond a difficult time in my life.
