8606163,5,B00EJX2YL2,"He is 5 and has gotten into football and has really enjoyed this show (Nickalodeon). This show uses real NFL players from different teams in each show so he can really follow these players elsewhere.  It's a cute show and the story-line is fine - group of kids who play on a footballl team who are also ""guardians"" whose job it is to protect football shaped ""mega-cores"".  The enemy is alien/robot type folks who are trying to steal the mega-cores from each team.",1391817600,3,463,4.566265060240964
