5676627,5,B00BUWD7F2,"Military history buffs like myself will really like this DVD about the Vietnam War. I learned things I didn't know about the War that surprised me. With Charlton Heston narrating I expected a 'hawk version' of events as in ""We(the US)didn't lose the War we just weren't allowed to win it"" which may very well be true. But instead, the documentary was very well balanced in its presentation of both sides of the war and it showed the ignorance and arrogance of the Gov'ts on both sides of the conflict. The DVD has no CC/subtitles but one great thing about 'Chuck Heston', he is an awesome speaker on film! I highly recommend this DVD and the other ones in the Secrets of War series.",1368921600,9,682,4.508064516129032

5676632,5,B00BUWD7F2,This is a very true presentation of the war. One thing I learned from it was that the Vietnamese approached President Wilson for help in getting the French out of their country. He refused. The Vietnamese had no other choice but to ask Russia for help.,1399852800,,252,4.5
5676633,2,B00BUWD7F2,This was a great disappointment to me. All of the segments touch base on so-called secret missions or op's. What a joke. Waste of my money & time. I have a complete library/achieve photo's and segments of this war. I personally thought this was a joke.,1391990400,,252,4.5

5676636,4,B00BUWD7F2,"These chapters are dependent on few and somewhat biased sources though the bias is, at least, bilateral since the PAVN veterans all mouth the party line as to how heroic were the North Vietnamese in standing up to and ultimately defeating the all-powerful Americans.  In those interviews no mention is made of the massive Soviet and Chinese aid North Vietnam received.

Unfortunately, the notion promoted by the US military to this day that in Vietnam the Americans scored all those ""battlefield victories"" goes unchallenged here.  In truth the whole idea of what a victory is, even what constitutes a ""battle"", had to be re-thought in that conflict.

There also are some outright distortions, such as the reason behind Operation Linebackers I and II--the notorious ""Christmas Bombing"" of Hanoi.  It was not Hanoi's intransigence that caused the Paris peace talks to stall.  The problem was the administration in Saigon--our own side, that is--that showed a sudden and very ill-timed independence and balked at signing the accords, knowing it had no popular support in the South.

For sheer quantity of material this disc is worth the $7,00 price and more.",1375833600,7,1156,5.117021276595745
5676637,4,B00BUWD7F2,I had seen other videos on the war and they were mostly standard  videos from the American perspective with the addition of a few personal stories from troops.  This has a section on Ho's life and you get a very interesting story from his side too.,1374019200,4,248,4.369565217391305

8574266,5,B00BUWD7F2,"This is far more objective than Ken Burns' anti- American work shown on Public Television, which merely repeats the left- wing anti- American propaganda seen on college campuses in the sixties. Interestingly, such demonstrations by phones idealists started to wane after the draft was eliminated. There are numerous books by historians which share the view of the war presented here. For example, see the works by Peter Braestrup, Philip Jennings, Lewis Sorley, Mark Moyar,  and Wriest and Dodge. Unfortunately, most of those who teach today-- particularly in
""higher education""--are left-wing and anti- American and will probably show Ken Burns' propagandistic PBS series instead of this. Burns' production was predictable for all those acquainted with his work. One of the chief advisors on this production was Peter Arnett, who was fired years ago by CNN for fabricating anti- American stories about the Vietnam War and later by NBC for doing the same during the second Gulf War.",1511395200,,982,5.294871794871795

8574269,1,B00BUWD7F2,"This series relies on an unknown british academic (what role did they have in the war?) and a selective narrative that posits it was all the north, and soviet Russia, and China's fault. There was no support for the vietmihn in the south, and the usual ""we would have won if hippie politicians would just let us win"" nonsense.

To this day, people still cant understand the ideology of their enemy, who fought for nationalism far more than for communism. They eventually went to war with all of their communist neighbours to preserve a Vietnam free of foreign domination, long after the US left Vietnam.

First some basic facts.

During World War II, the U.S. collaborated with the resistance group the Vietminh and their leader, Ho Chi Minh, in their fight against Japan. In the postwar period, however, the U.S. feared Communist expansion into Southeast Asia. In 1954, as France withdrew its forces in defeat, the Geneva Accords established the countries of Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam. Vietnam was partitioned into north and south sectors until elections to be held by 1956. Fearing a victory by Ho Chi Minh, the Eisenhower administration collaborated with the South Vietnam leadership to prevent elections and subsequently sent military aid and advisors. Under President John F. Kennedy, the number of advisors increased to more than 16,000, some of whom engaged in counterinsurgency efforts and actual combat. Although Kennedy opposed large scale U.S. involvement, his successor, Lyndon Johnson, began regular bombings and escalated troops to more than 500,000 by 1967. Johnsons successor, Richard Nixon, scaled back to 39,000 U.S. troops in Vietnam by September 1972, but initiated bombing raids into Cambodia in 1969 and sent ground troops there in 1970. The U.S. and North Vietnam reached a cease-fire agreement in January 1973, and the South Vietnamese regime fell in April 1975. More than one million people died during the war, including an estimated 925,000 North Vietnamese, 184,000 South Vietnamese, and 57,000 American soldiers.

This series holds that anti-communism was the central and all-pervasive fact of U.S. foreign policy from at least 1947 until the end of the sixties. After World War II, an ideology whose very existence seemed to threaten basic American values had combined with the national force of first Russia and then China. This combination of ideology and power brought our leaders to see the world in we-they terms and to insist that peace was indivisible. Going well beyond balance of power considerations, every piece of territory became critical, and every besieged nation, a potential domino. Communism came to be seen as an infection to be quarantined rather than a force to be judiciously and appropriately balanced. Vietnam, in particular, became the cockpit of confrontation between the Free World and Totalitarianism; it was where the action was for 20 years.

U.S. involvement in Vietnam is not mainly or mostly a story of step by step, inadvertent descent into unforeseen quicksand. It is primarily a story of why U.S. leaders considered that it was vital not to lose Vietnam by force to Communism. Our leaders believed Vietnam to be vital not for itself, but for what they thought its loss would mean internationally and domestically. Previous involvement made further involvement more unavoidable, and, to this extent, commitments were inherited. But judgements of Vietnams vitalnessbeginning with the Korean Warwere sufficient in themselves to set the course for escalation.

Our Presidents were never actually seeking a military victory in Vietnam. They were doing only what they thought was minimally necessary at each stage to keep Indochina, and later South Vietnam, out of Communist hands. This forced our Presidents to be brakemen, to do less than those who were urging military victory and to reject proposals for disengagement. It also meant that our Presidents wanted a negotiated settlement without fully realizing (though realizing more than their critics) that a civil war cannot be ended by political compromise.

Presidents and most of their lieutenants were not deluded by optimistic reports of progress and did not proceed on the basis of wishful thinking about winning a military victory in South Vietnam. They recognized that the steps they were taking were not adequate to win the war and that unless Hanoi relented, they would have to do more and more. Their strategy was to persevere in hope that their will to continueif not the practical effects of their actionswould cause the Communists to relent.",1492041600,,4570,5.226466575716235
