8443997,5,B004VSZDRW,"Michael Denney's teachings can be deceivingly simple, but once you work with them you will instantly feel the power behind them. I have a dozen of his videos and work with all of them regularly. If you own any of his videos don't make the mistake of watching them once... I find the teachings to be multi dimensional and each time I review them I refine my technique as I gain a deeper understanding.",1485129600,5,400,4.418918918918919
8443998,1,B004VSZDRW,"I didn't get much of anything out of this video.  The techniques are rehashed or watered down for the most part, and aren't very effective or worthwhile.  It is overpriced for what it is.  Just my opinion.",1317945600,,205,4.486486486486487
8443999,5,B004VSZDRW,"Celestial Qigong level 2 builds upon the exercises of the level 1 video and adds some new techniques. The last portion of the video is dedicated to teaching the ""Heaven Earth Qigong"" meditation. I find that it really helps integrate the power of the other exercises in a very beautiful way and gives a sense of connectedness to the Universe I have not felt in other styles of energy work. I highly recommend this video series to anyone serious about qigong or energy work in general. I would recommend watching the Celestial Qigong Level 1 video first then watching the level 2 video... Great Stuff!",1303948800,5,599,4.714285714285714
8444000,5,B004VSZDRW,"Celestial Qigong Level II adds deeper levels to the practices on the level I DVD and adds a couple new practices. If you have ever learned ""closed door"" temple style qigong, you will recognize the unmistakeable power that comes from an authentic lineage practice. The exercises in these DVDs have that kind of power. I especially appreciate the Heaven Earth Qigong meditation. I use it to help absorb and ground the powerful energies created by the exercises. Once again in this 2nd DVD, Mr. Denney teaches very simple exercises that are deceptively powerful. Will there be a level III? I hope so...",1303430400,6,599,4.882352941176471
