8640200,5,B000J10HCQ,"I have over 40 DVDs and LickLibray,and HotLicks DVDs are some of the Very Best. This is a Great Theory from a Great Player Jamie Humphries DVD.I recomend his Danny Gill,and Andy James Quick Licks DVDs Highly. I own the 3 part Danny Gill set,but this one DVD all though there are 2 ,this first Fretboard Navigation part 1 was better than Dannys 3 Theory DVDs put Together. This is from a guy who has played over 15 years and teaches. Check out this DVD ,and the Quick Licks DVDs From Danny Gill,Andy James,and Jamie Humphries .They All Teach very Well,and Play even better .LickLibray Rocks,and is the BEST I
 have seen.",1233878400,3,619,4.526785714285714
