8407252,1,B003W4GDNO,"I used to think that maybe some of the UFO videos are real, now I think that all of them are fake.

It is simple. Almost all of the videos or pictures are blurry. Why is that? It is simple, because those videos and pictures with clear images were already analyzed, and they were determined to be identifiable objects. Only those blurry ones can be called ufos, and if those images were clear, they would have been determined as non-ufos.

This is the same thing for this ""case"". First of all, how come he was able to record so many UFOs at so many different times and dates, how come none of the neighbors saw those UFOs? Second, how come those UFOs only appear when he was around, how come those who are not related to him saw any of those UFOs? Most importantly, none of his videos have any objects which can be used to compare to the UFO. If he didn't know at first, he should have known when he started talking to other people about UFOs.

All of his videos were about a round object in the sky with nothing else to compare to. If you were an alien, would you be that stupid to show up at this guy's home for so many times and do nothing? What is the purpose of your trip then?

Therefore, I conclude, this case is 100% fake.",1315699200,3,1229,4.172995780590718
