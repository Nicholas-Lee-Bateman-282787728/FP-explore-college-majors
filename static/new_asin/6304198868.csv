Ellcia is a nice series with that's halfway between a ""fantasy"" series and a ""science fiction"" series. King Nabosu recovered greater technology in ancient ruins. It didn't take long before he took over an entire continent and surrounding islands. It also didn't take long to before he got too bored for his own good. When a sacred book is discovered with a bunch of prophesies blah blah blah, you know the rest,  an adventure begins!
The English version of Ellcia was produced by ADV films, so if you've seen any of their shows like  Neon Genesis Evangelion  you'll recognize a few voice actors. Over all, the dub wasn't bad, but wasn't exceptionally good either. I couldn't tell you what the sub was like since this is the VHS version! Last time I e-mailed ADV films they didn't have any plans to release this series onto DVD. They should, you could have both dub and sub in one! You should bug 'em about it!
Although the running time is 50 minutes it seems a lot shorter than that! It goes by pretty fast, that must be a sign of how good it is. It's sad to think there are only 4 volumes in total.
