The 1938 version referenced current event implicitly. These films record the outlook and culture of the time when they were produced. The 1948 version is serious with some added humor. The 1979 version was made after the fact. The enemy is explicit, but we know how it will turnout after blood, sweat, and tears. The good guys win in the end. A secret message must be carried to Whitehall. Just what it is isn't explained, but it must be important to justify the kidnapping and murders. You can compare the 1938 version to some of Eric Amblers novels from that time. This movie is a version of the locked room mystery story.

The 1938 version tells about a coded message hidden in a song. It cant be detected by any search of the messenger. Can music accurately carry a detailed message? It shows how a person can be kidnapped and a double substituted for the original. I Was Montys Double tells about a real-world example. The small group of Englishmen on the train use their pistols to stop their attackers. Could the idea of body substitution be used in modern times?

The 1979 version is more colorful and happier in tone. Amanda Kelly gets star treatment. In this version Miss Froy simply disappears (until she is found hidden away in the baggage car). Again, pistols are used for protection. There are changes in details from the original story, both are worth watching. There were people in Germany who opposed the Third Reich by supplying information to the Allies. One general kept in touch with the British (The Two-Headed Spy).",1427241600,,1570,4.701818181818182
8091456,4,B000BREOLS,"This is about the 1979 filming, the 1938 is well enuf known. Firstly it is in full widescreen here, even tho the packaging doesn't say it. The cinematography is gorgeous. Cybill Shepherd is too, so that's why I say it's enjoyable.
But the minuses are in the (non)acting of Shepherd and Elliot Gould. They don't take their acting seriously, act like they're acting stupid. That keeps this film from being great. Cybill is just foolish, but Gould is a dumb ugly blotch who makes me puke.
The PAL video format can be played on computer DVD drives. The region 2 is your problem to resolve. I say this movie in widescreen is worth having available in North America.
Note also that this was produced by Hammer Films of England, their last production. In fact it was so last that they went bankrupt before completion and Rank Organization got ownership of the film. See the Hammer credit at the end.",1262736000,2,892,4.616352201257862
