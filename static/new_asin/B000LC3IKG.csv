2701604,5,B000LC3IKG,"'From the Vault' satisfied me as an old school Shawn Michaels fan. It had all the great classics from the 80's through the end of the 90's. This release will not have any repeats from that collection and will give us some of the more rare Shawn Michaels match ups and of course it will chronicle his return from 2002 to the present. Here is a list of matches and features that I ganked from silvervision.co.uk:

2701621,4,B000LC3IKG,"NOTE: This is a one disc version of the previously released 3 disc set featuring only the documentary & bonus extras that were included on the original set.

""Shawn Michaels is one of the most talented gifted individuals inside the ring but outside he's a self obnoxious jerk who takes the tights & goes home if he doesn't get his way"" is the infamous line stated by Jim Cornette that pretty much describes the reputation & career of Shawn Michaels in many people's eyes leading to him being one of the most controversial superstars in the history of the WWE & for the first time, you hear his story in his words.

The documentary kicks off talking about Shawn growing up on an air force base & becoming a wrestling fan at age 12 to the point where he started doing Ric Flair promos & wrestling in his pool. Shawn tried college but quit to get trained by Jose Lathario & started in World Class & Mid-South Wrestling. The next story is how he met Marty Jannetty in Kansas City & brought him up to the AWA a month after he was there. They're ""life in the fast lane"" lifestyle & the fued between Doug Sommers & Buddy Rose over the AWA tag team titles is talked about next along with how it lead to them coming to the WWE before Jimmy Jack Funk led to them getting fired. They're experience in working Continental Wrestling and alternating between Memphis & the AWA before making it back to the WWE is discussed. They're second run in WWE is discussed along with the story behind their tag title win being recalled & erased from the record before the story behind their breakup & the impact of the Barber Shop segment that happened between Shawn & Marty. Shawn's morphing from The Rocker into the Heartbreak Kid with Sensational Sherri (R.I.P.) giving him credibility, Mr. Perfect coining the nickname ""Heartbreak Kid"", and the importance of the Intercontinental Title. The story behind Shawn bringing in Kevin ""Diesel"" Nash (and what Rick Steiner had to do with it) is briefly talked about before moving on to why he was suspended in late 1993 & how that indirectly planted the seeds for the WrestleMania 10 ladder match. How the Kliq was formed along with what exactly they're ""backstage power"" was along with various opinions of the group by people such as Vince & Ted Dibiase is talked about. The story behind the WrestleMania 11 match with Diesel is talked about before the story behind Shawn being attacked in a New York nightclub and how Triple H came up with the idea for Shawn to do the ""Owen Hart"" angle where Shawn passed out. Who's idea it was for the WrestleMania 12 Iron Man match along with how Shawn trained for it is talked about next before they go into detail about how Shawn was very bitter & heavily opinionated despite being the champion at the time. A very interesting part was Shawn, Triple H, and Vince giving their sides of the story behind the infamous ""curtain call"" in Madison Square Garden. Shawn's homecoming at the Royal Rumble '97 was briefly discussed before his forfeiting the title because of the knee injury in Feb. '97 is talked about along with what his mom had to do about him ""losing his smile."" His Hell In The Cell match with Taker & pushing the envelope with DX are both talked about before moving on to Survivor Series '97, how involved HBK really was with the whole incident, and how that effected him backstage is heavily discussed. HBK's injury in the Royal Rumble casket match and wrestling though the injury at WrestleMania 14 while being bitter about passing the torch to Austin is talked about. How Shawn found his wife Rebecca (who he saw on WCW Monday Nitro), got married, and had a child is discussed along with Shawn's heavy downward spiral that led an incident backstage at RAW the week before WrestleMania that resulted in his falling out with Triple H before he found religion though his wife's bible study. The return to WWE is talked about next along with what exactly Triple H had to do with. How important the WrestleMania 19 match with Jericho was along with the heavy details about why the feud with Hulk Hogan resulted in HBK being a heel for a month is talked about. His fued with HBK along with ""infamous"" McMahonism/God angle is talked about before they go into the DX reunion & why Shawn wouldn't go where he did with the original DX. The documentry closed out with the WrestleMania 23 match with John Cena & how Triple H's injury figured Shawn into the title picture along with how everything was on HBK (not John Cena) to deliver.

DVD extras include the debut of his ""Heartbreak Hotel"" interview segment, his ""Tell Me A Lie"" music video, and his infamous ""Larry Bling Live"" spoof of Hulk Hogan. There were tons of interview outtakes & bonus stories such as Shawn earning his varsity jacket as a sophomore in high school, how his mom approves of his outfits, the backstage fight that started the Rockers breakup, his wrestling school that produced Lance Cade & Brian Kendrick, discussion on his WrestleMania 21 match against Kurt Angle, Shawn's thoughts about the ladder he used at WrestleMania 22, and Triple H & Chris Jericho talking about the HORRIBLE brown tights Shawn wore at Survivor Series 2002.

In the end, this was a good presentation on Shawn's career as we got his side of the story & answers on various incidents & subjects that have plagued not just his career but his personal life as well so I recommend this.",1396137600,,5394,4.603950103950104
2701622,5,B000LC3IKG,my fianc loves shawn michaels and has wanted this dvd got it works great she loves it and its got a lot of his best matches and a great story shes watched it 20 times since shes got it lol. but all in all love the dvd and thank you for the perfect Christmas gift for her,1370476800,,270,3.754385964912281
2701623,5,B000LC3IKG,This three disc set is worth every penny. I had seen this before and had to have it. It goes into detail about Shawn Michaels in-ring career and also discusses some of the personal issues he faced throughout his life. Some of it is truly heartbreaking to say the least. But it ends well. The very reason I respect the man is because of the major life changes he has made (as said in this DVD). Anyhow I highly recommend this DVD to anybody willing to watch it.,1368576000,,460,4.238636363636363

2701625,4,B000LC3IKG,"This dvd set really focused on HBK before he became liked by fans... this is almost a Part 1 and My Journey is a Part 2.  My 9yr old loves HBK, so this was perfect.",1356134400,2,164,3.6857142857142855

2701627,5,B000LC3IKG,I have been a fan of Shawn Michaels since his debut in the WWF as one half of the Rockers.  I have purchased four of his DVD sets and this is by far the best of them all.  The interviews alone are worth the price.  Also included are some of his best matches from the latter part of his career including the rematch on RAW between himself and John Cena which was just a blast to watch.,1321660800,,384,3.961038961038961
2701628,5,B000LC3IKG,"This is a great DVD set that will go along quite well with the From the Vault set.  Disc one is a documentary on the life of Shawn which is really good.  The only thing I don't like about it is his parents who kind of have this air about them that they never wanted him to do this for a living, that he was meant for something bigger then being a wrestler.  I wonder how they feel about him being named as maybe the greatest of all time.  I don't hear people say that his dad was the greatest pilot in the history of the Air Force.  To me, seems like Shawn turned out ok.  There are also some promos shown, some deleted scenes and some stories that didn't make the final cut.  As far as the documentary goes some of the things I wanted to hear about was good like his suspension from WWE in late 1993 early 1994, the Clique, the time he got beat up outside a night club in New York, the DX stuff and of course the Montreal Screwjob.  It's all here and it's pretty insightful.  Disc 2 and 3 are matches.  The first match you see a very young Shawn taking on Billy Jack Haynes in WCCW in 1985. Not much to talk about as this wasn't a very good match.  Up next is the Midnight Rockers agaist Buddy Rose and Doug Somers for the AWA tag titles.  It was a pretty good match and the Rockers do win the tag titles but still it was just ok.  The next one is Midnight Rockers taking on Super Ninja and Ninja Go for the AWA tag titles.  Again just a pretty good match.  Then we get teh Rockers against the Brainbusters (Tully Blanchard and Arn Anderson) in MSG.  This is the first real good match of the set.  I actually have about 5 or 6 of their matches and these guys could go.  This is a great example of just how good these two teams were.  Up next is the ""lost"" match for the WWE tag titles when the Rockers ""won"" the tag titles from the Hart Foundation.  Honestly, this is a good match but because the ropes broke during the match and Vince deemed it not worthy for TV, he cut the match and made the Rockers give the titles back to the Foundation.  It's ironic that today that match would have been played and fans would have loved to have seen the ropes break.  Also watch Bret and Shawn both give the referee a hard time trying to tell him to stop the match, stop the tape and fix the ropes.  Classic!  Up next is a very good match from the Royal Rumble 1991 when the Rockers took on the Orient Express.  This may be the Rockers best PPV match while in the WWE as some of the stuff they did made you just sit there and scratch your head as to how they did that.  This was a very very good match.  The next match is Shawn's first single title win when he beat the British Bulldog on SNME for the IC title.  The match is pretty good but he would have even better ones with the Bulldog in the future.  The last match on disc 2 is the entire Royal Rumble match from 1995.  This was when Shawn went coast to coast and won the thing.  It's not long just around 40:00 but still worth seeing.  I liked seeing some of the old characters that the WWE had that time like Mantaur and I think Max Moon was in it too.  Great match!  Disc 3 has more matches and starts with the a lost classic from In Your House II when Shawn took on Jeff Jarrett for the IC title.  On paper this match looked to be boring and trival but when these two went at it they tore the house down.  This is a great match that I am suprised has not been released on DVD before now.  Up next is a fantastic match with Bulldog and Shawn at KOTR 1996 for the world title (see I told you they would have better ones).  This match was hold for hold move for move good.  I do feel that Bulldog was one of Shawn's greatest opponents in his career and after viewing this one you'll see why.  Up next is another gem from Raw when Shawn took on Triple H for the world title.  This was another great match as most of his matches with Triple H are.  The ending is classic where you think Shawn won or did he win or wait what's going here?  Great match.  I am suprised the next match is on here as it is when he and Marty teamed back up for the first time since 1991 to take on La Resistance on Raw.  This match is just one that is good to sit there and go back in time but it's not that great.  Up next we get the match from Vengeance where Shawn took on Kurt Angle.  A lot of people were mad they didn't put the Wrestlemania 21 match on here but honestly, I think this match may be better.  It is has a little bit faster pace and has a few more highspots in it.  This is a good one.  The last match is the match with John Cena from Raw that went over 50:00.  We get to see about 38:00 of the match, so you don't get the full match but you get enough to know that this was a good one.  I think it was better then their Wrestlemania 23 match but not by much.  All in all this is a really good DVD set.  There is a great documentary feature and then you get a series of very good matches.  What else is there to say?  This is one good set!",1321488000,,4982,3.956740442655936
2701629,4,B000LC3IKG,Not really into WWE. I watched it with my husband. I did cry when Shawn Michaels left because he was one of the few people that actually made me want to watch. I'm sure this was a good DVD.,1310860800,,189,3.871794871794872
2701630,5,B000LC3IKG,"Sure there are a few flaws, but overall this is a must own wwe dvd set.  The main flaw is that their is very little shown of Shawn Michaels time with D-X.  But when you consider how long his career has been (Which makes me feel very old), the you know WWE did the best they could with this set.  Just wish they had made it larger and included more footage of Shawn Michaels with D_X. They were my favorite tag team in the WWE period.",1292457600,,433,4.011627906976744

2701632,5,B000LC3IKG,"Very good collections of Shawn's matches. Good DVD, impossible to get all of his classic matches into one single collection!",1272153600,,124,5.25
2701633,5,B000LC3IKG,"3 Disc Collector's Edition (2007)

Today I'll be reviewing ""The Shawn Michaels Story Heartbreak & Triumph"" DVD collection that chronicles the career of Shawn Michaels (at least until 2007).

This is a career story of the real guy Michael Shawn Hickenbottom as well as the arc of the character known as Shawn Michaels. He talks about his start and childhood with interviews from family and friends. He watched wrestling every Saturday and idolized wrestlers like Ric Flair.

There's a lot of detail into the career of The Rockers with Marty and how too much partying made them lose their way and get fired at one point. Eventually The Barber Shop incident happened provoking many boys to ask, ""Why, Shawn, why? Marty is your friend!"" Shawn's start as a singles competitor was slow, but he did a great job establishing his heel turn and singing his own theme song and becoming The Heartbreak Kid. He had a lot of doubts about the crazy flamboyant wardrobe and methods but the more he got into it, the more people hated him and he became a great heel.

The story continues through the Clique years with the stable that involved Shawn Michaels, Triple H, Kevin Nash/Diesel, Scott Hall, and Sean Waltman. During this time Shawn still mouthed off in public and at one point got into a fight with some Marines at a bar leading him to fake a concussion in the ring later. When Kevin and Scott were leaving to go to WCW, Shawn wanted to have a last curtain call with the guys which would mess up the kayfabe (aka the faux action and storylines that promoters want fans to believe) mixing up babyfaces and heels and the audience enjoyed it, but it shocked the higher ups in the business that they could undermine the business that way by breaking the fourth wall when those guys were leaving.

There was a lot of buildup to the creation of the Ironman match between Shawn Michaels and Bret Hart and the types of training he engaged in and the fact that he came down from the ceiling (in the way Owen Hart would die from a fall years later) and the match itself was truly amazing but since it was a WrestleMania match, for some reason it isn't on this set. Such a bummer to build us up and not let us watch it!

Shawn has always been one of the flashiest, best in ring performers. He particularly excels at the emotional moments, no one appears hurt better than Shawn and he knows how to take punishment along with dishing it out. After a long run as the WWE champion, Shawn's personal problems caught up with him too much and he had to leave and get himself right.

The story continues with his drug abuse, finding his wife, finding religion and becoming a healthier person despite all his back injuries. In the WWE, it explores his Hell-in-a-Cell main event return, the creation of D-Generation X and all its hijinx. Then into the rivalries with Mr. McMahon, his best friend Triple H, and others including the most famous - The Montreal Screwjob. Shawn talks about what he was ordered to do and how he tried to make the best of it.

There is no doubt that Shawn has had a great and varied career and has struggled with many celebrity problems with drugs. He will be facing The Undertaker at WrestleMania 26 to try and end Taker's undefeated streak at the risk of being forced to retire so we'll see what happens next.

Matches:

Many of the matches are classic matches with the Rockers. The two really worked well together with the high flying stunts but it's obvious that Shawn is the one destined to go farther. Probably my favorite match of the bunch would be with Triple H when Shawn was trying to work his way back into the business again after injuries and getting over personal problems. The WrestleMania rematch with John Cena is disappointing because the match AT WrestleMania was sooo good. That was the first time I ever watched wrestling was WrestleMania 23 and that match was a really lengthy one with lots of back and forth in momentum and the crowd liked both so there was no real heel. I'd say the real disappointment in this set is that Shawn is known as ""Mr. Wrestlemania"" and most of his best matches were at those events and not a single one was featured in this set. My husband actually got to go to WrestleMania 23 and I did NOT because I thought he should take someone who knew more about it since I was a newb. I have never heard the end of it......ever.....since I do watch now and enjoy it very much.

DVD Extras:

Besides the 14 matches, there are three promos: ""Heartbreak Hotel"", ""Tell me a lie"" music video, and ""Larry King spoof"", all of which are VERY funny. There are four deleted scenes from the documentary, ""Wrestling Academy"", ""Bible Teacher"", ""Colorado Expedition"", and ""Who's the Greatest 'Wrestler'?"" These mostly go a little more into Michaels' training background, spiritual background, and the rest. There are also 8 deleted stories that didn't make it into the documentary for not fitting for whatever reason. Some are from family members and some from fellow wrestlers and they are more telling of his personality growing up and more detail into the Rockers fight, etc.",1270944000,,5897,4.620821394460363

The Shawn Michaels Story- Heartbreak & Triumph
Heartbreak & Triumph is an incredible story of one of the best wrestlers in the world. Shawn Michaels is often compared to masters of the ring like Ric Flair, Bret Hart, and Triple H. However, Shawn is in a league of his own. The Heart Break Kid is a highflyer, a technician, and a brawler. He can take any style and make it his own. Very few wrestlers can say they can do that. Even fewer superstars excel when they do this. Shawn Michaels is loved by the common fan and the hardcore internet fan. Shawn Michaels is on of the best wrestlers in the world and this is a great set for him.

Heartbreak & Triumph is a glorious three-disk set. The first disk contains a documentary about Shawn's life. The other two disks are filled with great matches from his career. The documentary is one of the better ones I have seen. The story begins with Shawn being born. His mother wanted a girl instead of him, but his mother learned to love him. Shawn's love of wrestling began when he was twelve years old. He and his friend actually wrestled for a talent show. They move into his early career in AWA, and his part in the popular Rockers tag team. They then move into his WWE career and his egotistical problems. They talk about Shawn's drug and injury problems. They go through his entire career until Wrestlemania 23. The story is very good and filled with emotion. The story itself probably earns this set five stars.

There is also a good amount of extras on the first disk. Promos, deleted scenes, and stories are all here. The deleted scenes include his feud with Kurt Angle, which was left out due to Angle leaving for TNA. The extras are all great, except a music video I did not like much. All the matches are great and perfect choices.

-Disk 2-

Shawn Michaels VS Bill Jack Haynes (WCCW, 1/11/85)
This is just a quick squash match. Michaels looks good, but quickly loses.
RATING- No Rating

AWA Tag Team Championships (AWA, 2/10/87)
Midnight Rockers VS Buddy Rose & Doug Somers(c)
This is not the bloody battle described in the documentary. However, this is the first Tag Title win for the Midnight Rockers. The match is slow, but entertaining. The Rockers do not use much of their fast-paced wrestling in this match. Rose and Somers dominate most of the match. The match is slow, but has its moments.
RATING- 7.5/10

AWA Tag Team Championship (AWA 6/12/87)
Midnight Rockers(c) VS Super Ninja & Ninja Go
Let me say that the two Ninjas are ridiculous. They only do a ninja stance every now and then; nothing else is ninja about them. Regardless, this match starts fast paced with the Rockers getting the advantage. The Ninjas gain control later in the match and does not relinquish it for a long time. This match is much better than the previous match is.
RATING- 8.5/10

The Rockers VS The Brainbusters (Madison Square Garden, 1/23/89)
This match is wonderful. The Brainbusters consist of Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard. There is some fast-paced action, comedic action, and good tag team wrestling. This is my favorite tag team match on the set.
RATING- 9.5/10

2 out of 3 Falls Match
WWF Tag Team Championship (October 1990)
The Rockers VS The Hart Foundation(c)
This match was erased from history due to one of the top ropes breaking. I will say that this match feels like a big mess. Both teams hesitate a lot and moves do not seem to flow right. The top rope is fixed for the third fall, but the match is not working correctly yet. In addition, there is not commentary for this match. Still, it is not all terrible. The match just lacked fluidity.
RATING- 7.5/10

The Rockers VS Orient Express (Royal Rumble 1991)
This is another good tag team match. Orient Express controls most of the match, but The Rockers get their offensive moments. Both these team put on a good showing.
RATING- 8/10

Intercontinental Championship (Saturday Night's Main Event, 11/8/92)
Shawn Michaels VS British Bulldog(c)
British Bulldog had just beaten Bret Hart in their historic match at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Summerslam-1992/dp/6302260922/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Summerslam 1992</a>. This match is a fantastic showing. Bulldog uses his power to control the match. There is a good technical showdown at one point. I loved the ending, but I do not think the crowd understood what happened.
RATING- 9/10

Royal Rumble Match (Royal Rumble 1995)
If you do not already know how this one ends, you have never watched wrestling. While the ending is an epic moment, the Rumble itself is not epic. In fact, the 1995 edition of the Rumble is horrible. There are only five true stars in the match; two of them are eliminated in a matter of seconds. The other three dominate the entire match. Those three are Michaels, Bulldog, and Luger. Everyone else in the Rumble is just a pawn for them to throw out. In addition, the intervals between entrants were only thirty-seconds. This means people were constantly coming in nothing truly interesting ever happens. The final two is epic and bring this match up slightly.
RATING- 6/10

-Disk 3-

Intercontinental Championship (In Your House, 7/23/95)
Shawn Michaels VS Jeff Jarrett(c) w/ The Roadie
Many are claiming that this match is a ""lost classic."" This match has been lost in time, but it is not a classic. The match is good, but by no means a classic. Shawn out wrestles Jarrett until Shawn takes a sick spill until the outside. Jarrett then controls the match. Roadie interferes from time to time. Roadie would go on to be known as B.G. James later in his career.
RATING- 8/10

WWF Championship (King of the Ring 1996)
Shawn Michaels(c) VS British Bulldog
Mr. Perfect is an outside referee for this match. Mr. Perfect has been aligned with Bulldog and Owen Hart lately, so the match is bias. Michaels tries to take away the upper power of Bulldog by working on his arm. The match is back and forth. This is even better than there other match on this set. The problem is the weird ending.
RATING- 9.5/10

World Heavyweight Championship (Raw, 12/29/03)
Shawn Michaels VS Triple H(c) w/Ric Flair
This match took place in Shawn's hometown. The crowd is hot, and this match is electric. Triple H and Michaels go back and forth the entire match. Shawn takes a sick dive to the outside onto Flair and Triple H. Shawn even locks on the Figure-4 onto Triple H. The match has an exciting closing minutes. The ending is odd, but I loved it.
RATING- 9/10

The Rockers VS La Resistance (Raw, 3/14/05)
This is a one night only return on The Rockers. Shawn and Marty still look great together. The match is short, but it is nice to see them together again.

Shawn Michaels VS Kurt Angle (Vengeance 2005) (Match of the DVD)
After&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WrestleMania-21/dp/B0006SSNXW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WrestleMania 21</a>, no one thought this match would take place again. Angle was drafted to Raw though and the match was on. Angle focuses on the neck of Michaels for most of the match. There are some sick spots including a German Suplex onto the announce table and a powerbomb into the turnbuckle. This match is epic. You will love every second of it.

Shawn Michaels VS John Cena (Raw, 4/23/07)
Use the bathroom, get something to drink, and get ready to stay glued to your seat for nearly an hour.

2701636,4,B000LC3IKG,"Overall it's a good DVD set. The documentary is excellent, so are the extras. As far as the matches go, what I like is that they haven't included matches previously released in 'From The Vault' DVD set. Unlike the earlier set, this set contains some of Shawn's excellent but low profile matches. This DVD set combiner with From The Vault DVD set makes a good Shawn Michaels collection. My only complaint is that neither of these two DVD sets contain the HBK vs Kurt Angle match that took place at Wrestlemania 21.

I wish the WWE releases another 3 disk DVD set on Shawn Michaels some years from now. That would make a complete collection of HBK's career along with the previous two DVD sets.",1221782400,,692,4.536

2701638,4,B000LC3IKG,"Well, I just watched the documentary part of Shawn's new DVD and it is really good stuff. Nowhere near as much obscure WWF footage as I'd have liked, but still some good action and AWA footage. Plenty of attention to Shawn's great return from injury, but it was hard listening to Shawn talking about going through depression since he thought about suicide and also, that he wasn't competent to be able to take care of his family since he couldn't wrestle anymore which caused him to do drugs and booze.

And unfortunately, they focused A LOT on the screwjob and Triple H had a lot of needless crap to say, even Ted Dibiase seemed to harp on Bret being 'bitter' still and how Shawn wants to patch things up (although I'm sure WWE just asked Ted to say that for them just to make Shawn look good). They showed clips of Bret smashing stuff up whilst talking about how much grudge he has, fair or what. Hunter also said how Bret was going to walk out the next night, when not under contract, which is bullsh** because he still had another 30 days left on his contract and would have dropped it anytime if Vince had let him. Hunter is just being a complete revisionist nitwit and Shawn tells a different story with each interview he does regarding Montreal. (In the Heartbreak and Triumph book, Shawn says he was the mastermind behind the whole thing, on the DVD he says it was Vince's idea and he was doing what he was told.) Personally, I think the DVD would've been much better without spending so much time on it. It's so disappointing that WWE had taken great strides in patching things up with Bret over the years only for this crap to be released and shown and take it right back to square one. *Sigh*

So, aside from the Montreal crap (it never gets old and WWE will never let it die), HBK's DVD is amazing and easily the best Superstar DVD since Flair and Hart. There's a few more matches I would've preferred to have on there like Vs. Bret Hart from Survivor Series 92, Vs. Chris Jericho at WM XIX, or Vs. Shelton Benjamin on RAW in mid-2005, but I'm really grateful WWE went all-out on releasing rare / classic matches instead of just rehashing stuff on From The Vault.

This DVD set is absolutely worth getting for any HBK fan. Hell, even any wrestling fan out there.",1218672000,,2274,4.422434367541766
2701639,5,B000LC3IKG,"THE SHORT: A load of great matches plus a documentary that is surprisingly straightforward and fairly objective. Don't be afraid to get this if you already own ""From the Vault"", both combine to make a great Shawn Michaels retrospective without overlapping matches.

THE LONG: Let's get this out of the way immediately- Shawn is one of the best performers in the history of the business. He is also one of the most cocky and manipulative. That being said, I was very satisfied with the way this dvd looked at his career. This is one of the WWE's most straightforward and genuine dvds.

In the documentary, Shawn briefly discusses growing up and then swiftly moves to his early days in the AWA and his partnership with Marty Jannetty, who shows up to add some welcome testimony as well. We then move on to Shawn's solo career, his early days as the Heartbreak Kid, the forming of backstage power team ""The Clique"", and his eventual exit and return of the company. Of course all the expected milestones, friendships and enemies are covered. Shawn comes across as pretty candid, and if I may say more turned down and believable than usual, as he covers sensitive subjects such as Montreal, drug abuse, and his religious interests.

Unlike Bret Hart's documentary, which featured Bret speaking almost exclusively (to at times the dvd's detriment), an air of authenticity is lent to this release as people as high up in the company ranks as Pat Patterson, Triple H, and Vince Mcmahon both celebrate Shawn as expected, but also freely admit to having several problems with him as well. Triple H describes being fed up with Shawn's drug abuse and Vince and Pat complain more than once about his attitude and stubbornness, and it was refreshing to see them being blunt about it and not beating around the bush in typical shrugging ""But it's HBK!"" fashion.

For his part, I don't think Shawn completely redeems past behavior and alleged incidences of him playing politics and refusing to job to other wrestlers, but maybe they caught him on a good day- I do believe that, despite Shawn still being Shawn, he comes off here as more personable and self-aware than I've ever seen him. He cracks a couple jokes and has moments where the cynic doubts his honesty, of course. But for the most part he seems relaxed enough to leave the HBK persona behind and be real, and not just WWE's version of ""real"". Let's put it this way- this is the least ""show-bizzy"" I've ever seen Shawn, and it was a compelling documentary.

As for the matches, it's Shawn Michaels so of course you're getting your money's worth as far as wrestling is concerned. A favorite of mine is the legendary untelevised match of the Rockers vs. The Hart Foundation, where had it not been for the top rope breaking the Rockers would have been officially declared tag champs. Shawn complains about the quality of this match although the performances are solid, and I can't help but be thoroughly amused when Jim Neidhart is startled cold in the middle of the ring, eyeballing the broken rope, and loudly declaring ""GOD **** IT!!! SON OF A B****!!!!!"" Before resuming the match.

Is there more I would have asked for? Aside from personal favorite matches, honestly not much. I still think Shawn used to be a complete jerk behind the scenes and nothing will make me totally accept that. But I was very satisfied to see a more mature Shawn covering this and many other subjects, and also happy to see people chime in to give their own thougtful comments about things such as Montreal and Shawn's behavior. An informative and engaging documentary couple with some fantastic wrestling. What more could you want?",1212969600,,3656,4.7586750788643535
2701640,4,B000LC3IKG,"My only complaint would be the lack of high profile matches.  Sure, those may be available on previous dvds, but previous dvd's have a tendency to be difficult to track down.

I'd have loved to have seen newer matches added to previous selections, perhaps Shawn's personal picks, the picks of his peers....  Just something higher profile than a bunch of AWA matches, Raw matches, non televised matches, or follow-ups to big PPV shows w/o the same high profile implications.

How can you have a DVD featuring the ICON, the SHOWSTOPER, and MR. WRESTLEMANIA w/o a single Wrestlemania match on any of the 3 dvds.

Regardless, this was a very entertaining collection.  Michaels has earned a reputation over the years.  Some of it good, some bad, but disc 1 of this set gives you a lot of perspective on what Shawn dealt with throughout all phases of his long career.

A great story, pretty good matches, and a must have.",1212105600,,915,4.710691823899371

Going so much into his life on disc 1 was the right thing to do.  Plus not really sugar coating any of his out of ring problems was the right way to go to show that even the top guy in the compnay can have problems like anyone else.  For disc's 2 and 3 having 14 matches that had never been on dvd(excluding the 95 Rumble match now due to the collection) was a way I'm am so glad they went.  If they had just put recycled matches would have put this collection down to maybe a 3 1/2 stars instead of the 5 I gave.  Here you find early matches from WCCW against Billy Jack Haynes to his classic non-title un scheduled iron man match against John Cena.  The gems of this collection be the 1995 match versus Jeff Jarrett for the IC title and yes even with Jarrett this is a classic match.  The other gem was the World title match from Raw on December 2003 from San Antonio with Triple H(and how could these 2 not have a great match).

2701643,5,B000LC3IKG,"I originally bought this as a Christmas present for a fellow female employee who is a big Shawn Michaels fan! I finally bought it for myself a few days ago and I have to say I wasn't dissapointed at all. While I am not a die-hard Christian or Bible thumper, I was raised in a Christian home so I guess some of that still remains with me. I mention this because I was touched by the outside of the ring story of Shawn's. I would recommend this for that type as well because there is a great lesson in falling and redemption here too.

Back to the review, this is also a great trip down memory lane for long time fans like me to see Shawn from back in his AWA days. I began watching wrestling in 1985 and I viewed the AWA as weak in those days. The Midnight Rockers was one of the few reasons I watched the AWA back then because they were different from Nick Bockwinkle, ""Playboy"" Buddy Rose, ""Pretty Boy"" Doug Sommers, the late Ray ""The Crippler"" Stevens and others. Nothing against them as they were great performers but I think The Rockers brought a breath of fresh air to that territory.

It also visits the break up of The Rockers, his time with the late Sherri Martel, behind the scenes fights with management including Vince McMahon, the infamous ""Curtain Call"" in Madison Square Garden, the infamous Montreal Screwjob (more on that one), his leaving the WWE due to his back injury, his marriage to former Nitro girl Whisper (Rebecca Hickenbottom), his drug problems, his brief falling out with HHH in 2001, his conversion to Christianity and his return to WWE.

For those that either own or seen Bret Hart's WWE release, this gives Shawn's side of the Montreal story. On that, I believe Bret was screwed over. However, I hold Vince more responsible than I do Shawn. Shawn was/is an employee of WWE. He did what he was told to do by his boss. While it was low what he did, I think most people (myself included) would've done what Vince wanted. Ultimately, the buck stops with McMahon.

For the record, I do think Bret brought it on himself a bit by not agreeing to job that night BUT what McMahon did was still wrong.

Back to this, I think most fans or even a fan of documentaries will be pleased with this. I haven't gotten to all the extras yet but so far, I like it! High recommendation!",1205971200,2,2296,4.392941176470588
2701644,5,B000LC3IKG,"Before I watched this DVD, I could have written everything I knew about Shawn Michaels on the back of a postage stamp. I missed Shawn's first stint in the WWE so never knew much about his background. I was always interested to know more though because I enjoy his athletic and high-flying wrestling style.

The documentary on Disc 1 is 2 hrs, 2 mins long and does an excellent job of discussing the key moments in Shawn's personal and professional life. I was actually surprised by how honest it was. It showed that Shawn could be arrogant and selfish, and wasn't always liked by others. Shawn was also honest about how drug problems and pain affected his life. The overall picture of Shawn, by the mid to late 90s, was a man who was successful in the ring but unhappy outside of it, and was on a path of self-destruction. The DVD then shows how Shawn turned his life around and returned to WWE. At first, although he got married and had a child, he was still using drugs...but through developing a stronger Christian faith he was able to give up drugs and become a happier person who is also nicer to the people around him. It was brilliant to watch a wrestling story where there is actually a happy ending!

The documentary is enhanced by comments from Michaels' family, people he used to work with, Vince McMahon and other wrestlers - particularly Triple H, Chris Jericho and Marty Jannetty. The documentary is very emotional, a real feel good story by the end, and it gives the impression that Shawn has learnt a lot from his past mistakes. The Extras on Disc 1 include some deleted scenes from the documentary, a really good `Tell me a Lie' tribute video, and a funny promo where Shawn dresses up as Hulk Hogan.

Other reviewers have outlined the matches on Discs 2 and 3 better than I could - but I do think it is a great range of old and new matches. For those of us from the United Kingdom, it's really nice to see the Michaels v Cena match filmed in London in 2007. I am particularly happy that WWE mainy chose matches that aren't available on other DVDs and they didn't include any Wrestlemania matches either, because most fans already have those on DVD.

Overall, this DVD is highly recommended for all WWE fans, including people like me who didn't have any knowledge of Shawn Michaels before the 2000s.",1203811200,4,2315,4.5178997613365155

Ultimately, I realize they can't fit in everything (and I know future DVDs will fill in some holes), and I'm very pleased with the matches they did choose.

2701650,5,B000LC3IKG,"This 3-disc DVD set is not a complete chronicle of the career of ""The Heartbreak Kid,"" but is a pretty good representation of one of the most dynamic performers in the WWE. It covers his early life and his desire to be a wrestler, at the Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas, to his early career after High School in which he began wrestling in Texas and Louisiana, to his fateful meeting with Marty Jannetty and their pairing in the old American Wrestling Association (AWA) as the Midnight Rockers, where they defeated ""Playboy"" Buddy Rose and ""Pretty Boy"" Doug Somers for the AWA Tag Team Championships. After dropping the belts, and still under contract to the AWA, the Rockers went to New York and the WWE and made a huge splash there, even winning the WWE Tag Team Championships from the Hart Foundation (Bret ""Hitman"" Hart and Jim ""The Anvil"" Neidhardt) in a non-televised 2-out-of-3 falls match. Unfortunately, because of the match being unrecognized due to the top rope snapping, the titles were returned to the Hart Foundation, and the Rockers continued on till a fateful segment on Brutus Beefcake's Barber Shop in which Michaels superkicked Jannetty and threw him through a plate-glass window, thus becoming ""The Heartbreak Kid"" and pairing up with ""Sensational"" Sherri Martel. He defeated ""The British Bulldog"" Davey Boy Smith for his first singles title, the Intercontinental Title, his first of three. Michaels also had some personal troubles behind the scenes, which caused tension between himself and the wrestlers in the dressing room and WWE Chairman Vince McMahon, even after Michaels won the WWE Title from Hart in a 60-Minute Iron Man Match at Wrestlemania 12 in 1996. His forming of the multi-federation organization known as ""The Clique"" (Triple-HHH, Scott ""Razor Ramon"" Hall, Kevin ""Diesel"" Nash and Sean ""X-Pac"" Waltman) is highlighted, as well as his falling-out with Triple HHH and eventual reconciliation. Shawn found faith thanks to his wife Rebecca, and he and his wife have two beautiful children today and are both strong Christians. Michaels has won at least 3 World Titles, the World Tag Team Titles, the Intercontinental Title and the now-defunct European Title, making him the first-ever Grand-Slam Champion of the WWE. Michaels' career is covered on Disc 1; on Discs 2 and 3 are some memorable matches, from WCCW (World Class Championship Wrestling), the AWA and WWE. Tag matches with Jannetty from the AWA and WWE are profiled, as is his first I-C Title win from the British Bulldog, as is his 1995 victory in the Royal Rumble, winning and lasting even though he came in at Number 1. His third I-C Title win is shown on Disc 3, winning over ""Double-J"" Jeff Jarrett, as well as a match on Raw with then-World Heavyweight Champion Triple-HHH, as well as a reunion with his former tag team partner Jannetty in a win over La Resistance, a match against Kurt Angle at the 2005 Vengeance Pay-Per-View, and the Disc (and entire set) is rounded out with a win on Raw over then-WWE Champion John Cena in a non-title match that went nearly an hour.

Those things, you never hear about in the 80s, 90s, all you hear, is that wrestlers like Hogan, Batista, Lashley, etc, never use steroids, and are perfect human beings, which is not true.

2701657,2,B000LC3IKG,"This was obviously an attempt to follow the formula of Bret Hart's DVD (which is fine because it was a great DVD). The same plot points, if you will, are followed. The beginning, conflicts, family, etc. Ok, any other wrestling DVD has it, but if you look closely, Bret's was done much better than many (if not most) before it.
Back to THIS DVD: Some parts did seem rushed, but overall it was an excellent main program (I have most of HBK's matches, so watching disc 1 was my intention). However there WERE some things missing:
1. His rivalry with Kurt Angle. When I say ""missing"" I make a BIG understatement. If it wasn't on the discs with matches, fine, I have it on WM21...but to NOT mention it at all??? The months building up to it, the promos; the imitation Angle did; the appearances of MJanetty and SSherri? To not mention an EASY candidate for Match Of The Year 2005 is more of a political move (Vince still being mad at Angle for leaving and so forth; I won't get into it here) than anything else.
2. The overselling of Hogan's work during their SummerSlam 2005 match. Watch it on YouTube. There's footage of it there. Why not get into the personal thoughts on Hogan?
3. Shawn (or no one else, for that matter) never responded to Bret's claims that Shawn told Bret to ""get the f**k out of my ring"" after HBK won the belt at WM12 in 1996. They admitted their role in the Montreal incident; HBK admitted he was difficult at times...so why not go there?
It's a good DVD, worthy of any collection, I just wish it were less ""glossy"" since HBK seemed more ""real"" than the rest.",1198886400,7,1580,4.395904436860068

I especially liked the territory footage which showed a very green Michaels, who could barely speak on camera and had to rely on Jannety to carry the interviews. It was amazing to see how much Michaels devloped into the orator he is now and to hear Jannety is pretty sad, as he sounds like his brain is now mush due to some of the drugs he has taken.

The only real complaints is what was left out. They edited out the section on Kurt Angle (probably because he went to TNA) and the last half of the DVD is very rushed and doesn't really focus on some of Michael's latest items. Also, Sid is never mentioned, nor do they review the feud that He and Jannety had over the IC Belt. Chyna is never mentioned, there are no interviews with Hall, Nash, or Sean Waltman (only Hall is working for TNA so they could have used the other two) so you felt that a lot of the story wasn't being told from another perspective.

Also, Bret Hart fans will be enraged not because of Michaels giving his side of the Montreal hit, but because of the blatant lie given by HHH when he states that Hart's contract was going to expire the day after Survivor Series. In actuality, Hart had more than 4 weeks left on his contract and cold have lost the belt any time anywhere during those weeks.

I have been a big fan of the direction WWE has been going with their DVD's. Infact for a while it was the only thing they were doing right. This is no exception, Like Hulk Rules and the Ric Flair & Bret Hart collections before it; HBK's 3 disc treatment is easily one of the best sets that completely cover a marquee superstar's career.

I have been a Shawn Michaels fan for several years now. Going back to the Rockers and when he went solo. So I felt this DVD was tailor made for someone like me. And while I did not have the time to watch all the matches on the collection (I'll get to those over time), I always enjoy hearing about the lives of my favorite wrestlers. No matter who, I always feel they have interesting stories that are not like anybody else's How they get to be in the business, what do friends and family think about wrestling and being a wrestler, the rise in popularity and (if necessary) the winning of the heavyweight title, are all questions I want to hear about. Well this collection delves so deep into his career, that the 2 hour documentary on HBK covers just about everything I ever wanted to know.

You get to hear how HBK got into wrestling, his admiration for one Ric Flair, how he met Marty Jannety, becoming a singles wrestler, working with Sensational Sherri, the concussion angle on RAW vs. Owen Hart, his drug fueled party nights, his pill popping, his take on the Montreal screw job, the formation of DX, ""The curtain call"", wrestling in pain and his amazing comeback after being away for nearly 5 years. All this combined with exclusive photos, and video from matches, friends, family and other WWE wrestlers. All I can say it is very well done, and if you were a fan then, only know him from his comeback or are just beginning to enjoy him now, this is a great collection to find out about this AWESOME individual who long after he's gone with have left an indelible mark on the WWE and all future stars.

The one match that I am so excited that is in this set is an SNME match vs. The Hart Foundation. That was taped, but never aired. The top rope breaks. The match is a dud, The Rockers win the Tag Titles, but since Vince decided not to air it, it never happened. I think it's great that they put that on the disc. I am not go into every match, as people have already done that a bunch of times, but with this DVD set, the previous ""From the Vault"" collection, you really have a great representation of what this guy was about inside and outside the ring.

The matches on this set are like icing on the cake, especially since they did not include a lot of matches you can find on other collections. Brushing the dust off the IYH: match vs. Jeff Jarrett and the SNME match vs. The British Bulldog was a nice touch and going all the way up to an April 2007 match vs. 21st century superstar John Cena,  makes this a must own collection. With Christmas right around the corner, how someone could not get this for the WWE fan on their list is beyond my scope.",1196467200,,3116,4.328767123287672
2701664,5,B000LC3IKG,"I got this the first day it was out, and I watched the documentry right away, and damn was it good. You find out so many personal details its amazing. Shawn isn't afraid to talk about his demons he's had, many of which I have never heard about. Its a shame we almost never had the best entertainer ever, but I'm glad we did.

Some complain his best matches aren't on here. Thats because they are on other dvds, but rest assured, I'm sure when HBK is done in the ring.....we'll get a super DVD Set with probably this documentary (which is perfect) added on with what he's done since. Then all his best matches will be put on there....and will there ever be a lot of them. No one can match his Showstopping performances. He can and has made anyone look like a superstar.

This is a must have for ANY Wrestling fan. You will not be disapointed",1196294400,,840,4.276729559748428
2701665,5,B000LC3IKG,"First off, as others have mentioned and others yet haven't gotten the idea, this Shawn Michaels DVD collection perfectly COMPLEMENTS his ""From The Vault"" collection. I really like the choice of matches here. Every always wants the long and bloody matches. However, I thought it was smart on WWE's part to put the HBK/Cena rematch from London. That was an awesome match that I unfortunately missed and have been praying would be released in some way. Also, the Rockers matches are awesome to watch, especially the one with the Hart Foundation, when the Rockers ""won"" the tag team titles, only to have the match stricken from the records after the Hart Foundation signed a new contract with then-WWF.

The documentary was one of the best I've seen since they put out the Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts DVD. Now that was a hard documentary to watch. The extras are also nice too.

All in all, this is another good DVD collections from WWE. Instead of giving matches that have appeared on other DVD's, they chose here to bring some gems from out of the vault many of us haven't seen. The Michaels/Triple H match from Raw, I never even saw, but I think was better than many of their pay-per-view matches. In conclusion, if you're a Michaels fan, get this DVD along with ""From The Vault."" These two DVD's together offer some of Michaels best matches, many of which people often overlook.",1196294400,2,1375,4.7012448132780085
2701666,5,B000LC3IKG,"The past few WWE DVDs have been hit or miss with some of the features on them.  Rey's DVD was awesome, for matches.  It was lacking with biography.  John Cena's had a biography, well done.  With those two, I didn't know how to treat this one, given Shawn is my favorite wrestler for the past...almost 20 years.  The biography on disc one was amazing.  They brought his friends, church people, family and wife.  The matches on disc 2 and 3 were very well put together.  The only match I wish were on here was the Elimination Chamber from 02.  That is a hard match to find and was hoping we'd see it.  Chamber or not, this is still one of the better DVDs WWE has released (I'm still putting Ladder Match as number one!!)",1196208000,,718,4.291044776119403
2701667,5,B000LC3IKG,"Man I just watched the Shawn Michaels documentary. I wasn't even the biggest HBK fan going into it, but damn it's an awesome documentary. It's over 2 hours (Just the documentary) and covers EVERYTHING. It has comments from Janetty, Jericho (a lot of him), and lots of people in his life. HBK recounts his greatest highs, and the lowest points in his life. I wholeheartedly recommend it to any true wrestling fan! My favorite part is the ""lollipop incident"" with Ken Shamrock.",1196208000,,475,4.804878048780488
2701668,5,B000LC3IKG,This DVD is simply amazing. The greatest wrestling DVD fit for the greatest wrestler of all time. The matches were nice choices as well. 100% worth every single penny.,1196208000,,167,4.793103448275862
2701669,4,B000LC3IKG,"The DVD is great but why wouldn't you include the ladder match from Wrestlemania X? or the sequel from Summerslam?
Other than that, it was a great DVD! Great, but it could have been perfect w the addition of the ladder matches!",1196208000,,227,4.428571428571429
2701670,5,B000LC3IKG,"If you're an old-school WWE fan who enjoyed watching HBK during his younger days, this is a must buy.  If you're a younger fan who only knows the ""new"" HBK, this is still a must buy.  Shawn Michaels is one of the greatest WWE wrestlers in history - arguably THE best wrestler in WWE history.

This layout of this DVD is very similar to the Bret Hart DVD that was released a few years ago.  Disc 1 contains a very lengthy documentary (at least 2 hours) on HBK's entire life up to this point.  His parents briefly talk about his childhood and his passion for wrestling, which started at age 12.  Then it details his high school days, college, the beginning of his wrestling career, the Rockers, the long road to the WWE, the beginning of his singles career, the Kliq, his title reigns, his drug and attitude problems, DX, the Montreal Screwjob, his back injury, his return, the new DX, and more.  Shawn is very open about his past mistakes, and gives a deep inside look into the backstage politics of pro wrestling.  This is one of the most emotionally-charged documentaries that WWE has ever released.  It's sometimes hard to believe that Shawn has been with WWE since 1988, and he is basically the only ""original"" that can still wrestle like he's in his early 20's.

The other 2 discs feature matches that span from 1985 to 2007, including some forgotten classics like his Intercontinental Title match with Jeff Jarrett in 1995.  There are also some decent extras, including his original ""HeartBreak Hotel"" segment on Raw in 1994, and his Hulk Hogan impersonation on ""Larry King"" before SummerSlam 2005.

Personally, I was more excited about this DVD release than any other WWE DVD in history.  It's a steal at $19.99, but I honestly would have paid $50 or more for this.  It's really that good, especially if you're an old-school HBK fan.  Five stars without a doubt.",1196208000,,1868,4.652439024390244
2701671,4,B000LC3IKG,"What can I say, WWE got it right this time around.  The Doc. alone is worth the price for the dvd.  If you are a fan of the ""Heartbreak Kid"" then you want go wrong with this dvd set.  This is WAY better then his first 2 Disc release a few yrs. back, I've already found one hidden easter egg, but I'm not telling where its at lol, try and find it yourselfs.",1196121600,,356,3.8493150684931505
2701672,5,B000LC3IKG,This is perhaps the best dvd the wwe has ever put out! I actually wrote an e-mail to wwe about 10 months ago and suggested that they put out a dvd just like the book. Just like they did for the stone cold truth book then the dvd. i was just so excited that they finally came out with a ne Shawn Michaels dvd after 4 years. I just watched part of it and it is very well put together. I suggest any old school wwe fan go and buy this dvd!!!!!!!!! THE GREATEST WRESTLER OF ALL TIME HBK!!!!!,1196121600,,487,3.9292929292929295
2701673,5,B000LC3IKG,"I read Shawn Michaels book of the same name. I think I gave it a three star rating but I cant remember. The beginning of Michaels career is highlighted pretty well but after that it dwindles down.  I like they showed old footage of Kevin Nash; Ive always wanted to see it and I cant believe they put in some footage of him as Vinnie Vegas. I forgot how funny the orignal D-X was until I saw the chapter on them. A good biography on Michaels but the end does seem kind of rushed. Vince also kisses up to Shawn alot as the story progresses.

The matches are unqiue and something WWE should continue. They released 14 matches that are not on his other dvd set and some of them are classics and a few of them could have been left out for better gems. His first match against Billy Jack Haynes was a quick squash and the annoucer even flubbed his name. You cant go wrong with any Rocker matches, they are all good. Can you imagine Rockers VS Hardys? That would be awesome. The 95 Rumble was short and showed just how much little talent WWE had at the time. Im shocked to see Jarrett on here but it is a lost classic. I really enjoyed the match and I hate Jarrett. His almost half hour match against Bulldog is anther classic, better then the one for the IC title. I wish they would have put the Iron Man Match with Kurt Angle on here. That is probably the only misstep. All in all- a great set. However, WWE could have put a few more matches on here- granted a full Royal Rumble and a few half hour matchs can take up some room. I would have also liked to see a few more promos as well because he has a ton of great ones they could have used. I cant understand how Dusty Rhodes crappy WWE promos were and they put at least 30 or more on his set. Highly recommended set for a few lost classic matches and the story is pretty good up until Rock Bottom. It makes you want to dig out some old VHS or DVDS of HBK and remember just how he is probably one of the greatest wrestlers of all time.",1196121600,5,1982,4.079487179487179

2701675,5,B000LC3IKG,"Shawn Michaels is such a good wrestler that even if the WWE were to release a 10 disc DVD set it would seem incomplete. Yes, there are a lot of matches not on this collection including great fights against guys like Sid, Vader, Y2J, HHH, and more, but there's also a ton of great matches that are on this set.

Highlights include a retrospective on Shawn's career and a few rare classics like HBK vs. Jeff Jarrett at In Your House 2, HBK vs. HHH on Raw, and HBK vs. John Cena from Raw this past April.

If you already own HBK: From the Vault, this is a great addition to that DVD set considering none of the matches are repeated on this DVD.",1195603200,,641,4.161290322580645
2701676,4,B000LC3IKG,"First off, I totally agree that there are some matches missing. THe HITC against the Undertaker will always be a classic. It's also a high crime that his match against Marty Jannetty was left off, even though it won PWI's vote for best match of the '90s!!! And I agree that the SS 92 match with Bret should have been on here. However, to the point of Razor Ramon at WM 10?? I think that was on the From the Vault collection. There are also tons of other matches that could have been on here as well. I agree with the match he had as a Rocker when he faced Ric Flair and they could have put the one on there against Ted Dibiase from the same era.

But, to get for all of his classic matches, Time Life would have to handle the collection and put out a new DVD every month for a year. I would love to see the infomercials for that though.

I for one, am getting this collection for the Rockers matches it has on it though. The Orient Express match from RR 91 is perhaps the greatest tag team match of all time. And I have wanted to see the Tag Team title match in Fort Wayne, IN for years!! As have all other Rockers fans. And yes, the other matches are almost as great and represent alot of important history in the WWE. So for those reasons, I think this collection is definitely worth the price.",1194566400,,1296,4.118577075098814
2701677,5,B000LC3IKG,"NOTE: UPDATED THIS REVIEW IN 2015

There's nothing that can be or hasn't been said about anything regarding Shawn Michaels that hasn't already been said weather your talking about his performances in the ring or his controversial life outside of the ring but now you hear from Shawn Michaels himself on these subjects on this DVD set ""Heartbreak & Triumph"" along with others such as his family (wife Rebecca, his parents & childhood friends) & superstars including Triple H, Vince McMahon, Marty Jannetty, Tully Blanchard, Ted Dibiase, Chris Jericho,  Jim Ross, Sensational Sherri, Pat Patterson, Bruce Prichard & John Cena.

The documentry kicks off talking about Shawn growing up on an air force base & becoming a wrestling fan at age 12 to the point where he started doing Ric Flair promos & wrestling in his pool. Shawn tried college but quit to get trained by Jose Lathario & started in World Class & Mid-South Wrestling. The next story is how he met Marty Jannetty in Kansas City & brought him up to the AWA a month after he was there. They're ""life in the fastlane"" lifestyle & the fued between Doug Sommers & Buddy Rose over the AWA tag team titles is talked about next along with how it lead to them coming to the WWE before Jimmy Jack Funk led to them getting fired. They're experience in working Continental Wrestling and alternating between Memphis & the AWA before making it back to the WWE is discussed. They're second run in WWE is discussed along with the story behind their tag title win being recalled & erased from the record before the story behind their breakup & the impact of the Barber Shop segment that happened between Shawn & Marty. Shawn's morphing from The Rocker into the Heartbreak Kid with Sensational Sherri (R.I.P.) giving him credibility, Mr. Perfect coining the nickname ""Heartbreak Kid"", and the importance of the Intercontinental Title. The story behind Shawn bringing in Kevin ""Diesel"" Nash (and what Rick Steiner had to do with it) is briefly talked about before moving on to why he was suspended in late 1993 & how that indirectly planted the seeds for the WrestleMania X ladder match. How the Kliq was formed along with what exactly they're ""backstage power"" was along with various opinions of the group by people such as Vince & Ted Dibiase is talked about. The story behind the WrestleMania XI match with Diesel is talked about before the story behind Shawn being attacked in a New York nightclub and how Triple H came up with the idea for Shawn to do the ""Owen Hart"" angle where Shawn passed out. Who's idea it was for the WrestleMania XII Iron Man match along with how Shawn trained for it is talked about next before they go into detail about how Shawn was very bitter & heavily opinionated despite being the champion at the time. A very interesting part was Shawn, Triple H, and Vince giving their sides of the story behind the infamous ""curtain call"" in Madison Square Garden. Shawn's homecoming at the Royal Rumble '97 was briefly discussed before his forfeiting the title because of the knee injury in Feb. '97 is talked about along with what his mom had to do about him ""losing his smile."" His Hell In The Cell match with Taker & pushing the envelope with DX are both talked about before moving on to Survivor Series '97, how involved HBK really was with the whole incident, and how that effected him backstage is heavily discussed. HBK's injury in the Royal Rumble casket match and wrestling though the injury at WrestleMania XIV while being bitter about passing the torch to Austin is talked about. How Shawn found his wife Rebecca (who he saw on WCW Monday Nitro), got married, and had a child is discussed along with Shawn's heavy downward spiral that led an incident backstage at RAW the week before WrestleMania that resulted in his falling out with Triple H before he found religion though his wife's bible study. The return to WWE is talked about next along with what exactly Triple H had to do with. How important the WrestleMania XIX match with Jericho was along with the heavy details about why the fued with Hulk Hogan resulted in HBK being a heel for a month is talked about. His fued with HBK along with ""infamous"" McMahonism/God angle is talked about before they go into the DX reunion & why Shawn wouldn't go where he did with the original DX. The documentary closed out with the WrestleMania 23 match with John Cena & how Triple H's injury figured Shawn into the title picture along with how everything was on HBK (not John Cena) to deliver.

Matches Include:
vs. Billy Haynes - This was a real quick match where Hayes was in control before Shawn resorted to tactics that quickly moved the momentum in his favor only for him to get caught when he decided to show off.
""World Class Championship Wrestling"" Jan. '85

Rockers vs. Brain Busters - This was Arn Anderson's & Tully Blanchard's debut at Madison Square Garden with the Busters attempting different tactics only for Rockers to return it right back to them with more force winning the exchanges & using their speed to stay a step ahead of the Busters while heavily worked over the arm before the Busters were finally able to bait one of them & isolate him from his partner taking away the speed advantage grounding him in a nice back & forth encounter.
""MSG"" Jan. '89

2 Out Of 3 Falls Match: Rockers vs. WWE Tag Team Champions Hart Foundation - It should be noted that this match has no commentary as both teams were evenly matched early from using various double team combinations to playing to each other's strengths as the Rockers relied on their speed while the Hart Foundation used their power & technical wrestling with each team attempting to focus on a specific area of the body leading into the second fall with one team getting more aggressive in singling out one opponent from his partner keeping him in their half of the ring & grounded on the mat using their numbers advantage before a freak accident caused the top rope to break which had it's effects for the rest of the fall as a team got real desperate going into the third fall where they kept using illegal tactics to keep the advantage while their opponents were able to use the teams momentum against team & take advantage of mistiming in what was a very hard fought match that unfortunately was never seen for close to two decades.
October '90

Rockers vs. Orient Express - Orient Express attempted to get the early advantage attacking from behind & double teaming only for the Rockers to beat them at their own game with double team combinations in & outside of the ring before they slowed things down grounding their opponent while taking advantage of various moments of mistiming allowing the Rockers to continue to work over both opponents at once as a team through multiple double team combinations or as one individual against both to the point where it took illegal tactics from the Express for them to change the momentum in their favor including Mr. Fuji making his presence known on the outside while relying on their martial arts style in what was a competitive match.
Royal Rumble '91

vs. Intercontinental Champion British Bulldog - Bulldog easily showcased his strength early as Shawn attempted to move him only to kept easily being shoved down causing him to resort to illegal tactics in order to execute some offense in his favor only for Bulldog to quickly gain it back with power moves & easily stopping Shawn dead whenever he was attempting to gain momentum before Shawn was able to use his momentum against him allowing an opening to heavily focus on a part of the body that neutralized his power while using some desperate tactics of his own resulting in a match that was heavily significant in Shawn's career.
""Saturday Night's Main Event"" Nov. '92
[Best Of Saturday Night's Main Event]

Royal Rumble Battle Royal - A couple of notes here in that Pamela Anderson was at ringside as she was set to escort the winner to ringside for the WWE Championship match at WrestleMania XI while this was advertised as ""the fastest Royal Rumble in history"" as the interludes between participants was every 60 seconds as this Rumble featured such highlights as who were the first & final two participant, who was out for revenge against certain participants for what happened earlier in the night, a 1,000 pound battle between two giants, another man's stand out performance, and the controversial finish in another match that was a significant to Shawn's career as he made history in this match.
Royal Rumble '95

vs. Intercontinental Champion Jeff Jarrett - This started out with each man trying to show off & ""one-up"" each other such as Jarrett doing HBK's pose on the top turnbuckle & Shawn doing Jarrett's strut resulting in Jarrett tried to break Shawn's momentum by constantly stalling on the outside & breaking the referee's 10 count at 9 to avoid a count out. When the match continued, Roadie tried to get involved only for Shawn to not only toss Jarrett onto Roadie on the outside but also dive onto both men from the top rope. Jarrett was able to regain the momentum when he back dropped Shawn over the top to the floor opening the door for Roadie to get involved as both men choked Shawn on the ropes, connecting with his own clothesline off the apron, and causing Shawn to lose his balance on the top rope allowing Jarrett to hit a superplex. Both men continued to trade momentum but Roadie got involved one too many times that not only resulted in a Sweet Chin Music that not only knocked Jarrett out for a three count but both men out of the WWF for the time being. This is a very underrated match in both men's careers due to the fact that it happened during a period that WWF was very low on viewership & crossover appeal along with the fact that it didn't happen on one of their bigger shows but this was definitely a ""lost classic"" encounter in both men's careers with a funny side note here but there was a moment when Vince's headset wasn't working with Lawler having fun at his expense.
""In Your House"" July '95
[Best Of In Your House]

WWE Championship Match vs. British Bulldog - It should be noted that Mr. Perfect was assigned to be the special outside referee due to the controversial ending to their previous PPV match, Owen Hart was on commentary for this match, and Bulldog was not only managed by Jim Cornette during this match but also had his wife, who was accusing Shawn of sexual harassment during this time, in his corner as well. Bulldog showed off his power advantage early by shoving Shawn to the floor twice resorting in Shawn going for the strategy of grounding Bulldog while also using his lucha influenced offense like catching Bulldog in a head scissors sending him to the floor followed by a frankensteiner off the apron. Bulldog decided to also try to ground Shawn but kept getting outpaced by Shawn & eventually got caught in a armbar takedown. Bulldog's strength came to his advantage with moves like pressing Shawn over the top to the floor only to press him back into the ring before going back to grounding him in the ring. Shawn kept trying to fight out of it with various move attempts only for Bulldog to have counters of his own such an attempted frankensteiner into a powerbomb. This was one of the best quality singles performances in Bulldog's career during this period while Shawn was really on his game during this period as well resulting in a quality encounter.
King Of The Ring '96
[Best Of King Of The Ring]

vs. World Champion Triple H - Shawn received this title shot in his hometown of San Antonio both men were feeling each other out early working on different locks on the body as Shawn was able to play mind games with not only Triple H but Ric Flair on the outside as Shawn used his superior speed to his advantage using Triple H's own momentum against him & always staying a step ahead with a counter for anything he did along with having no issues using a shortcut of his own before Triple H was able to heavily focus on a previous injury of Shawn's with heavy punishment in the ring & taking advantage of the ringside environment on the outside as they traded momentum with Shawn taking advantage of Triple H injuring himself while Triple H got assistance from Ric Flair when possible along with both men countering the other's tactics to the point where not only one man was bleeding but more than just the two participants felt the effects of this match in what was a competitive encounter.
""RAW"" Dec. '03

Rockers vs. La Resistance - This was not only the first time The Rockers had teamed up in 14 years as Marty looked like he hadn't lost a step heavily working over the arm along with The Rockers delivering their classic double team offense such as the dual crossbody causing La Resistance to resort to illegal tactics to gain the advantage isolating & grounding one opponent as this was a basic ""tag team wrestling 101"" match that was not only a backdrop to The Rockers reuniting but also Marty's first nationally televised wrestling match in 7 years.
""RAW"" Mar. '05

vs. Kurt Angle - This was their WrestleMania 21 rematch that started out with both men being very evenly matched working themselves over on the mat with different types of takedowns & working over the same area of the body before Angle heavily worked over the head & neck grounding him along with hitting impactful offense such as various suplexes including one on the outside of the ring onto the announce table & a powerbomb into the corner while HBK fought back with punches & chops along with his high flying across the ring & off the top rope as they traded momentum countering each other's signature moves while executing their own in a match that saw both men beat each other into exhaustion & matched the ""instant classic"" quality of their previous match.
Vengeance '05

vs. John Cena - This was a non-title rematch from WrestleMania 23 as both men had the same game plan in the early moments feeling each other out & going for a single body part while also having counters to each other's offense & utilizing the same moves such as a headlock takeover before Cena heavily focused on the neck area while Shawn took advantage of an opening allowing himself to target the arm also using the ringside environment to heavily work it over to the point where Cena was showing the effects such as only able to execute a bodyslam with one hand as both men traded momentum with leading to some impactful action both in & outside of the ring along with sequences resulting in a match that went close to an hour that has been regarded in not just one of the best matches in both men's careers but also the history of RAW.

This DVD doesn't include most of his more memorable & high profile matches but more of his rare performances along with other significant highlights in his career (first official & ""unofficial"" championship victories along with his history making performance in the 1995 Royal Rumble) which makes this one unique set to pick up if your a HBK fan.  In the end, if your just looking for more of his high profile & memorable matches then his other DVD sets (From The Vault; My Journey; Mr. WrestleMania; Superstar Collection) might suit you better but this is a DVD set I would recommend.",1192924800,29,16496,4.658653846153846
