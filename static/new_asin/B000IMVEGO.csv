8146347,1,B000IMVEGO,"He masquerades as a trainer that doesn't employ aversive techniques and yet he has used shock collars and even states, that he will use them again. He's not up to date on the science of animal behavior nor does he care about the animals emotional well being. I'd return the DVD if I could. He isn't relevant in today's training climate, that recognizes animals as having an emotional well being that needs safe guarding. It appears he will use any means to get the result he wants. Regardless of what's best for the animal. Very disappointing.",1515715200,,543,4.666666666666667

8146351,2,B000IMVEGO,"It's called the fundamentals of animal training, but you won't see Bob Bailey go through the process of training an animal. It all seems to take place in a room (I watched an hour and looked briefly at the rest), with Bob Bailey talking about the theory of training, and a lot of post-production slides on the screen, primarily with text. Where are the live chickens? Or dogs, since this is from a company called Dog Sports Video? I'm not criticizing Bob's knowledge or teaching, but this is not at all what I expected from an expensive set of videos.",1423180800,,551,4.52
8146352,5,B000IMVEGO,"This isn't a ""how to"" training video so if you're looking for that you might be disappointed. Bob Bailey is a great speaker and explains things in clear language. With all I've heard about Operant Conditioning, Classical Conditioning, Skinner, Pavlov, etc., etc. in the past, I've never really understood these until I listened to this DVD.",1391299200,,340,5.089285714285714
8146353,5,B000IMVEGO,"Bob Bailey is terrific and all new dog trainers, as well as serious amateurs, should be exposed to his work.",1381968000,,108,4.45
8146354,4,B000IMVEGO,"I was disappointed in this DVD set because it is merely some recorded lectures given at a dog trainers conference. DVD 3 has a lot of the same material as DVD 2 (he shows the same slides). There is a lot to think about on this set, but the content is limited.",1320710400,6,259,4.0
8146355,5,B000IMVEGO,"The videos are great. They contain much of the material he teaches in 'Chicken Camp,' without the chickens. I've gone through two weeks of his four week chicken camp and he changed my life as a a trainer. His teaching of animal learning is clear, direct and interlaced with memorable quips and sound bites you can take with you as you train. They just get stuck in your head.

Bob has been training many species for decades and is one of the key individuals helping advance applied behavior analysis out of the lab into the field.

I also highly reccomend Bob and Miriam Bailey's ""Patient like the Chipmunks (The long version) issued on DVD in 2006)"" for priceless footage and history of people pioneering the use of positive reinforcement training in the field as well as a history of the legendary Animal Behavior Enterprises.

Watch. Observe. Listen.",1223337600,9,853,4.789115646258503
8146356,5,B000IMVEGO,"If you are serious about animal training, whether you are a professional or a hobbyist, then you MUST own this video.  The fundamentals that Bob teaches are based on decades of data on thousands of animals across roughly 150 species.  Other trainers might choose their methods because they think they're the best -- Bob Bailey has tested his methods and knows that they are the most effective and efficient.  These are the same methods used by Keller Brelend, Marian Breland Bailey, and Bob Bailey to run an extremely successful training business.

There are no ""recipes"" in this video, no ""train your dog to sit by following these steps.""  These are the fundamentals of training which you can use to develop, implement, and troubleshoot your own training plans (or more effectively use the plans of others).  Learn these fundamentals, *practice* them, and your training ability will improve immensely.  No matter what species you are working with -- dogs, horses, cats, chickens, parrots, killer whales, fish, etc -- you can use these methods.

The first 3 discs cover the fundamentals of training, and are about 4 hours in length combined.  The fourth disc is a little shorter, and covers a few minutes of Q&A with Bob, and then Bob discusses running a business.  This a huge bonus for professionals, but can be a bit of a turn off for hobbyists.  Nonetheless, the first 3 discs are so valuable that they alone are worth the cost of the set.

Very educational, but also entertaining!  Bob shows some great videos of spy cats, dolphins, and chickens that he and the Brelands trained.  There are also videos of his workshop students training chickens.  These are amazing examples of what you can accomplish with the fundamentals of training.

You just can't go wrong with this video!",1212624000,14,1783,4.8933333333333335
