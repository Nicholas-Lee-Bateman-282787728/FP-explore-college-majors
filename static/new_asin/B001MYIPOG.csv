8322401,5,B001MYIPOG,"This 2 disc multi-segment documentary covers most of the major battles of the Marine Corps in World War 2. It was first made perhaps in the late 40's or  50's and is in black and white. Having quite a collection of WW2 documentaries and not seeing any reviews of this production, I was afraid I might be getting a duplicate set of something I already owned. This was not the case.
  Even though each of the segments has footage pertaining to that particular battle, some of it is repetitious just to fill in time. The narration is informative and interesting and seems as though it may have been produced by the Marine Corps itself although I can't be certain for sure. The set is broken down as follows:

Disc 1: Counterstrike
1. The Battle of Midway (this is NOT the John Ford documentary)
2. Bougainville
3. Rabaul
4. Tarawa

Disc 2: Beginning Of The End
1. Saipan
2. Tinian
3. Peleliu
4. Iwo Jima
5. Okinawa

  I found the segments of Bougainville and Rabaul interesting since they seem to be left out of most documentaries dealing with the Pacific War. All in all this set is worth the price and should be considered by anyone with an interest in the subject.",1330560000,3,1164,4.483412322274882
