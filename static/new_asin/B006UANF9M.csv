5019822,4,B006UANF9M,"We bought this on sale at Sam's club ($8), just figuring it would be nice to have some Jetsons for a change.  Well, the commentary on episode 1 said that the first season had only 24 episodes, and that the series was remade many years later (mid-1980s).  This started me on a Google search to learn more, and yes, the 1962/1963 season had 24 episodes then the series was cancelled. I don't think I've ever seen one of the 1980s ""2nd Season"" episodes, but from  what I've read, I don't think I'd like them.  Anyway, the ""Special Features"" section on disc 1 mentions the two episodes with commentary by Janet Waldo ""voice of Judy Jetson"", and also says there are more special features on disc 4....Disc 4?  huh?  There are only two in this set!  Now, you can get the complete 1st season, all 24 episodes, here on Amazon for about $25, but I'd rather just spend another $10 to get the other half of this set.  Anyone know where I can get that?",1408838400,6,940,4.362068965517241
5019823,5,B006UANF9M,I was afraid that these would be the 1990's remake of the cartoon.  But they weren't.  This is over six hours of the fantastic classic Jetsons.  This two disc set is no disappointment.,1403568000,2,184,4.515151515151516
5019824,5,B006UANF9M,"My husband and I grew up watching the Jetsons so naturally we wanted to introduce a classic to our boys. They love it. I also recommend The Flintsones, Tom and Jerry, and Loony Tunes.",1389657600,4,183,4.411764705882353
5019825,5,B006UANF9M,I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD.  I can't wait to share it with my grandchildren.  The Jetsons are wholesome entertainment.  You never have to worry about something inappropriate popping up.,1359504000,3,188,5.413793103448276
