8232148,4,B000YDOOGY,"Introducing ""Storm Hawks"", a brand-new, high-flying action series as seen on the Cartoon Network.  And by high-flying, these adventures really soar !

Join Sky Knight Aerrow and his squadron as they fly to new heights as the Storm Hawks protecting the world of Atmos and taking on the likes of the evil Cyclonians.  There's lots of non-stop action and some humorous bits that somehow remind me of my old favorite series ""Ed, Edd n Eddy"".

This DVD has 5 great episodes which are:

""The Age of Heroes"" (Parts 1 and 2""): Aerrow and his team aren't as great as the original Storm Hawks, but the brave Sky Knight and his team will achieve greatness once they attempt to thwart the sinister plans of Master Cyclonis.

""Gale Force Winds"": The Hawks attempt a rescue mission to save a young girl held against her will.  Or so they thought.

""The Code"": In order to win a Phoenix crystal, the Storm Hawks compete against an elite group of Sky Knights.

""Tranquility Now"": Finn loses Junko's signature weapon, the Knuckle Busters, and Junko doesn't feel like himself when they are once again up against the Cyclonians.

The bonus features aren't exactly what you'd think they'd be, however.  Even though they are ""The Storm Hawks Squadron"" and ""The Storm Hawks Weapons"", the features are merely montages of the characters on the show and their weapons in action.  As another bonus, you'll get an exclusive mini-comic included with this DVD, which is also nice.

Either way, this all-new action series will really have you on the edge of your seat as you feel as if you're flying, too.  So give this show a chance, and look for new episodes on Cartoon Network.",1201651200,6,1650,4.723776223776224
