6936075,5,B00RW5AFV0,Simply amazing! I got a complete workout from having every muscle in my body clenched throughout this entire thriller. Right when you believe you know what's going to happen next....you are horrifically wrong. Loved every second! Flood Reed is a twisted genius!,1434153600,5,261,5.238095238095238
6936076,1,B00RW5AFV0,"I am really baffled by the 5 star reviews that this so-called ""film"" received! Once again, I ordered this movie based on the first two reviewers comments, thinking I was in for a big treat! Boy, was I wrong!!!  For one thing, the ""actors"" were so lacking in skill on ANY level that I could not even finish the movie. I watched it for well over an hour, until I just couldn't stand wasting any more time on this movie. What, exactly, makes this particular movie stand out to anyone who raves about it?? I just do NOT get it!
Personally, I thought the plot was ridiculous, the acting worse than terrible and the entire ""film"" a complete waste of my time and my money! The story actually could've been SO much better with a skilled writer and/or a skilled director AND some decent actors, but as it stands, I absolutely hated this movie and I'm NOT that hard to please! But, when people give something of this caliber a 5 star rating, I have to wonder how many horror movies they have REALLY seen and what was it about this one that was scary or even, watchable?",1434067200,4,1059,4.348484848484849
6936077,4,B00RW5AFV0,"This movie is unpredictable, gruesome, bloody, and has all sorts of interesting scenarios. It's nasty and it is a heck of a lot of fun for people who get a kick out of Fangoria. The editing was fantastic and spot on. It is nice to see Adam ""Flood"" Reed a New Hampshire home grown Director hit his mark and terrorize the hell out of us with this local horror movie.",1433894400,18,364,4.214285714285714
6936078,5,B00RW5AFV0,"That time all the horrors of a road trip gone wrong met in the woods and ran some cannibal-crazed evil up your a**, American Backwoods: Slew Hampshire is the terror that unfolded. The film is written and directed by Flood Reed, a man whose lumberjack stature and woodsman appearance is as sexy as it is intimidating. Qualities that are only outweighed by his insanity and talent for creating a mind-f**k, cluster nut explosion of entertainment.

Overall American Backwoods: Slew Hampshire is a fun, twisted blend of Darwinian horror and a hunger games of Deliverance inspired terror that should make you second guess that road trip to North Americas hidden gems and honey spots. The story is elevated, next level insanity, the characters are dark and evolved. The special effects and atmosphere is exciting and full of classic horror energy placed in a truly modern piece of entertaining terror. A must for any horror fan regardless of which subgenre gets you off!",1430870400,12,964,4.987577639751553

6936092,1,B00RW5AFV0,"I am giving this movie one star because zero stars is not an option. If zero stars were an option, I would easily give it zero stars, and even that would be generous. Typical ""young people in the woods get killed"" movie. In this movie, our young people clearly did not stand a chance because they were being killed by not 1 bad guy (say maybe, Bigfoot, etc) , not 2 bad guys (say maybe Bigfoot and maybe a crazy guy with an axe or something, but they were being killed off by 3 bad guys ... Bigfoot, crazy local hunters and a lost tribe of woods-dwellers (sounded like they were of Viking-origin). The young people were doomed form the moment they set foot in the woods. The production wasn't that great ... pretty dark most of the time. The victimized young people were your typical bunch of nitwits, and were hard to identify with and/or like. On top of all this, the Bigfoot creature was the poorest example of a Bigfoot creature that I've seen in a long time and resembled the lost tribes people so closely that it was hard to tell this Bigfoot from a lost tribesman. Watching this movie will use up one hour and forty-two minutes of your life.... one hour and forty-two minutes of your life that you will never see again. This one hour and forty-two minutes would be better spent doing most anything else, like counting the number of tiles on your floor, or counting how many steps it takes you to get from room to room in your house, or anything else!

Flaming homosexuality from some hillbilly scumbags from New Hampshire. I'm sure the boys up there love being portrayed that way. LOL! If you want to see a twisted, chaotic movie with some blood and guts and homosexual hillbillies along with a mystery tribe of killers, then tune in.

Well, that's NOT going to happen; terrible dialogs, confusing camera work, weird characters (not in the good way) and when you finally see some gore, it's only for a few seconds and most of the time you can't even figure out what it's supposed to be.
The movie is boring and really bad. I decided to watch it till the end since so many people wrote ""terrible gore and splatter"" in their reviews, but the gore in the film was just not satisfying.

6936112,5,B00RW5AFV0,"The Story was a wild twist and turn of originality and gruesome reality. The acting was accomplished and never once took away from the sordid tale of ""teenage problems"". For a movie with obviously very limited budget the film maker really delivered with his own unique take on an american backwoods horror story.

I wasn't sure if I was watching the movie or the latest Manson video.  There is a sincere lack of continuity, and the choppy shots do nothing to increase the ease of understanding of this film.  It's more like a David Lynch film mixed with a tiny bit of Rob Zombie thrown in.

6936120,3,B00RW5AFV0,"Having listened to much of the commentary after watching Slew Hampshire, I almost gave the movie an extra star. Filming and post production extended through a period of years, yet the finished feature belies its low budget (300k); from a visual perspective production wise on a par with many a studio funded effort. Watching the movie, the shortcomings typical of countless other indie horrors were far from evident. For one, the acting was uniformly strong. Two, the production design never felt cheap. Hell, even the gore FX looked great. During Slew Hampshire's runtime there were occasions when the thought struck, that if this were an Edward Lee novel, or Richard Laymon, it would be right up there with their best works. Now, to what made this potential indie horror classic nigh unbearable to watch and as a result a crushing disappointment. The director needed a professional editor, or should have never attempted the task alone. This particular applies to the second act. The inserts, somewhat mimicking what Rob Zombie did with his early movies, were certainly used to excess, though these alone were not my primary gripe. Neither, particularly given the post viewing realization of the production's limited budget, were the paucity of master shots. Those elements are forgivable thanks entirely to a cast of truly outstanding young actors, and credit to the director for eliciting performances that do not merely convince. Many of the ensemble are given scenes wherein, despite the leftfield quirkiness of the material, they mold characters with whom one might easily engage in celluloid romances. So, the acting and script are strong, the direction variates from brilliant, to outstanding to adequate to poor, though is never inept. As mentioned, it's the editing that destroys it. Repeatedly, within a ten second time frame, there are twenty or more cuts. When will these young directors learn that every needless cut disturbs the rhythm of a film and pushes the viewer further away from the material? I would actually say shame on Midnight Releasing for not hiring a professional editor after picking up Slew Hampshire for distribution, then recutting from all available footage. Here you have a potential future cult classic. Flood Reed certainly understands the need to skew formula, and knows how to direct his actors. But so does Martin Scorsese. Didn't Scorsese cut his professional film-making teeth editing Woodstock? Yet there's a clear reason Matha Schoonmaker's name appears during the opening credits of just about every picture Scorsese ever made. As things stand, Slew Hampshire is ultimately a laudable failure.",1438732800,,2640,5.243498817966903

The film carries and eerie, trippy vibe, mixed with a gritty film style. The result is a terrifying atmosphere, with a constant feeling of dread. It has a pretty standard lost-in-the-woods, kidnapped-by-hillbillies kind of set up until the tribe and the creature are thrown into the mix, then things start to get really interesting. A disgusting blend of gore and rape make for a horrific film that make something like 'Deliverance' look like a a nice vacation in the woods. The addition of comedic relief make the film a whole lot of gratuitous fun for gore fans.

Dayo Okeniyi is excellent as mature one of the group, Bro. I always enjoy seeing the director's play horrible characters, particularly in horror. Director/writer Flood Reed shows off his multi-talent abilities as hillbilly Bags. If you love over the top violence and gore, you won't want to miss 'American Backwoods: Slew Hampshire'.

6936151,5,B00RW5AFV0,"It's great to finally see originality in movie-making. As a horror buff and somebody sick of the same old Hollywood trite, American Backwoods: Slew Hampshire was an absolute indulgence to watch and get into. The storyline was streamlined, the characters were both funny and imaginative, and the backdrop reminded me of home. In Hollywood, it's the same storyline, same plot, same character development; but in Slew Hampshire, Reed has broken new ground. Maybe for some, you need to have a sagacious understanding to grasp the character's entertaining banter. I think that may be the reason for some not-so-gracious reviews. Because otherwise, this flick is fresh and the non-conformity to Hollywood standards makes it stand out in a sea of indies.",1434585600,7,747,5.233333333333333

6936157,5,B00RW5AFV0,"I had the pleasure of seeing Slew Hampshire at one of the New Hampshire showings, and what an incredible experience! Ended up purchasing the DVD from Flood Reed and Michael Todd Schneider after the viewing, and I'm excited to dive into the special features.

Slew Hampshire has such an interesting storytelling style with a plethora of characters to follow. The horror comes fast and brutal, if you're looking for gore and slime this is THE place to get it. Plenty of comedy strewn throughout, alongside visceral violence. A warning for scenes of sexual violence, but they *are* there for plot reasons and they're effectively disturbing (certainly not glorifying the behavior, like so many films with similar scenes). Acting by most is strong (especially Dayo Okeniyi) and fits the theme well. Special effects are fantastic, a few scenes have settled in the back of my mind, and I don't think they're going to leave for a while. The sets are spot-on, you can tell they filmed in New Hampshire which is obviously important to have in a film taking place in NH. It's difficult to fake the environments of the state, so I'm glad they filmed on location.

The editing is tight and conveys the frenetic confusion felt by the characters, lots of quick cuts and close-ups. Definitely one of my favorite aspects of the flick. The other aspect that really stood out to me was the incredible composition of the soundtrack. Raw synths and low drones, switching with locally-recorded bands...they mesh perfectly with the editing style.

It's heartwarming and inspirational to see such a great horror flick coming out of New Hampshire. Very excited for what Flood and Michael have planned next!",1434412800,7,1681,4.953900709219858

6936159,4,B00RW5AFV0,"This movie is unique in the sense that it evolves into a plot unforeseen by the viewer. I also am an avid collector of movies, particularly of the horror genre and for a true fan of horror to post this lacks creative freshness, I'd have to question your movie credentials. I award this movie 4 stars based on its independent status, but the clarity, special effects and acting might confuse you from a typical independently financed film. The writer/director/actor for this film is an undiscovered talent. If you're a true movie goer, you'll appreciate the misdirection the movie takes. Three New Hampshire bred friends on a trip to an obscure, remote strip club find themselves dealing with deranged rednecks seeking subjects for their twisted backwoods game. The rednecks soon discover, however, they're now the subject of prey from supernatural beings aiming to slaughter.",1434412800,11,875,5.125874125874126

6936161,1,B00RW5AFV0,"I bought this movie because the husband of one of my friends is in it. Because of this she got to see this years ago and told me that it was horrible and not to waste my time. She's no stranger to horror movies, but I thought that her reaction had to be exagerated. So I have waited for about three years for this to come out and I could tell her that she was wrong... she wasn't!

As far as my credentials go, I own well over a thousand horror movies and have seen just as many that I don't own. The script and acting were non-existent and it feels like they may have been making it up as they went along. The plot made no sense what so ever. I get the feeling that the writer/director just watched a double feature of Deliverance and Wrong Turn and decided to try to make them one movie.

The only positive thing I can say is that the makeup and special effects were good. They didn't try to do more than the budget supported and the effect looked good.

Please, if you value your time and money, stay away from this one. I own a lot of bad movies, but only once have I ever thrown out a movie that I purchased. This one brought that count up to two.",1434326400,6,1152,4.021834061135372

There are some things in this film that you don't see very often, in regards to some of the more violent scenes, which was nice. I enjoyed the genre mashing as well and it was done right so as to avoid convolution. The practical SFX were on point, looked great. All in all, for a lower budget indie flick, I thought this was great.",1434326400,9,507,4.462365591397849

6936167,5,B00RW5AFV0,"Im just going to come out and say this right now, no hyperbole  American Backwoods: Slew Hampshire is the kind of indie horror movie every filmmaker should aspire to make. It is such a well put together production, with a great story, incredible acting, and some extremely brutal practical gore effects, youll almost forget that you're watching an indie, but without getting the feeling of watching a glossed-over Hollywood schlock-fest, either.

The dialog in the film comes across very naturally, and I think that is a good mix of both the very creative, very well-written story, and the superb acting. The film itself starts out almost as a comedy with some hilarious one-liners, but delves quickly into very dark and straight-up horror, featuring some extremely grisly, practical special FX.

Stand-out performances by all of the cast, most of whom have no major titles under their belts, and especially true of Dayo Okeniyi, who plays one of the lead characters, Bro, and is an excellent actor. Since the movie was shot, Okeniyi has gone on to several major films, including a part in Runner Runner with Ben Affleck, and the upcoming Terminator: Genisys with Arnold Schwarzenegger. Also, I have to mention a fantastic performance by relative newcomer Tyler Rice as Dude-Guy, who was extremely funny throughout. The entire cast, though, deserves applause, as they were all fantastic.

Flood Reed has said that this is his love letter to the state of New Hampshire, and as someone who spent most of my life there and is a born-and-raised New Englander, I can honestly say that I don't think there would be a better way to sign a love letter to the Granite State than with a slew of blood, gore, and even some great laughs.",1434153600,6,1725,4.877133105802048
