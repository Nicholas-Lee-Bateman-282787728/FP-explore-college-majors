I like it the best because it is the most exiting, and I like it alot better then HAMTARO AND THE HAM HAMS because it has almost all the ham hams in it.  Best hamtaro film of all time!

YEAH!",1100995200,3,333,3.8529411764705883
1779453,5,B00006JDUW,"In this, the second volume of Hamtaro cartoons, you'll find three classic episodes from the first season of Hamtaro. They are 'Come out Bijou', 'Diamonds Of Sugar', and 'First Time at the Beach'. While the length of this DVD is lacking a little, when coupled with the first volume 'Hamtaro - Hamtaro and the Ham-Hams' you'll have enough to keep the kiddies occupied for awhile.",1063152000,4,377,4.815384615384615

7970029,5,B00006JDUW,"Bought this for my then 8 year old niece for Easter. It happily arrived quickly and she watched it the whole day! Works perfect, it's now 8 months later and she still watches it.
She had the VHS version but the VCR ate it. DVD is Much better quality!
I'd recommend it for any kid of any age.",1354924800,,291,4.0344827586206895
