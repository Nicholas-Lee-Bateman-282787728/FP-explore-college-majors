Understandably the quality wouldnt be 100% as its an old production and a rare find, but the packaging was good and quality of the disk was perfect although the picture jumped a few times while watching but it didn't disturb the enjoyment of the classic series.

Thanks very much, awesome buy of my favourite childhood series!!",1326240000,,343,4.913793103448276
8113111,4,B000EQ5V54,"After seeing the first installment of Josh Kirby Time Warrior, I was hungry for more. I was asking many questions at the cliffhanger conclusion of ""Planet of the Dino-Knights""...  Would Josh ever get home?  Would Zoetrope find all of the nullifier pieces and destroy the universe?  Would Azabeth and Josh ever get it on?  These questions haunted me until my  return to the local Blockbuster video.  I searched for JK2 but alas, it was  already spoken for...  I scanned all six covers and decided to rent JK5  ""Journey to the Magic Cavern"".  What can I say... I like  mushrooms.  I was glad to see that JK's distribution company had put a  brief synopsis of what I had missed in volumes 2-4.  Upon returning to Josh  and his crew, we find that Azabeth feels the need to bite people.  Not just  normal people, but mushroom people. Azabeth falls deathly ill.  Josh, Prism  and Doctor 1138 only have 12 yaba-daba's to find the muncher and save their  dear friend Azabeth. And like Josh said, ""You don't need to know how  long a Yaba-daba is to know that Azabeth doesn't have much time"".  Along the road the crew meets some zainy characters.  Fertatuchi helps the  crew make their way through nightmare cavern toward the treachurous  Muncher.  Another zainy character is Ding-Dong.  This throw back to the  bull-headed character of Scrappy doo had his father eaten by the Muncher.  Ding-Dong is out for vengeance.  It is with this character and the fatally  ill Azabeth that the all encompassing quote arises. ""I'd be honored to  kick muncher but by your side young Ding-Dong"".  Wow...  If that's not  power, I don't know what is.  One of the most tension filled scenes is when  Josh must cross a bridge that is hung above a flowing river of lava.  This  is especially difficult for Josh because in JK1, he is told that his  community has been reduced to nothing but a pool of lava.  Josh must  swallow his fear and anger and cross the bridge.  But the birdge had been  constructed poorly (possibly by mexicans) and Josh must hurry before he  plunges to his death.  I'll let you decide if he makes it or not :) Some  favorite quotes: ""She's the one whow took a bite out of my head""  ""I'm sure he's a real fun-guy"" ""My tounge has been depressed  enough for one day, Josh Kirby"" End",947203200,4,2275,4.5675
