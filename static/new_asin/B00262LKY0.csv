Michael Hordern had played a low-keyed Prospero with the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1978, and he pretty much repeated the interpretation in the BBC version.  Many viewers find that the strongest passages are the scenes of Caliban (Warren Clarke), Trinculo (Andrew Sachs), and Stephano (Nigel Hawthorne).""
