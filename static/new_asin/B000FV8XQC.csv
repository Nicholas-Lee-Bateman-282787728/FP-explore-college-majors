8127078,3,B000FV8XQC,"Basically this film is about an 18 year old girl (Alexa Vega best known from Spy Kids when a child actor) who gets abducted at gun point, beaten and mentally tortured by a thug while his clueless driver drives them aimlessly around Chicago in a panic.  Spoilers follow in the rest of this review.

Innocent starts off with 15 minutes of nonsense and rotating cameras around a guy and a girl walking at times, sitting down, then getting back up again along a pavement beside a lake in Chicago, where you totally feel for the guy as Alexa Vega's character takes him on a mental battle back and forth, with you tried to hold my hand, I'm freaking out, why aren't you doing this, and well I didn't really know what was going on and the guy looked even more confused. The guy was probably thinking, gees you're hot but someone just shoot me right now.  Unfortunately for him that's what happens when two guys in a bright coloured convertible jeep with flames down the sides (so not real subtle) pull up beside them and try and rob them.  When they don't have enough money the two are told to get into the jeep but the wannabe boyfriend cowardly leaves the girl behind and legs it.  This proves to be a fatal mistake for him.  A large part of the rest of the movie is her in the back of the jeep being violently assaulted and having the gun stuck into her ribs, forced down her throat and other stuff that makes you just want to beat the crap out of the abductor.  The movie makes no sense in the fact that no one intervenes, or even seems to notice a beautiful girl with a face covered in blood and tears clearly stressed. Plus the gun is visible most of the time. Not to mention the driver abductor also has blood all over his face. The two abductors don't seem to know what they're doing and it really makes no sense as to why they think she can get them a lot of cash.  Why the thug keeps assaulting her makes even less sense and although the camera cuts every time he hits her, it's still very uncomfortable and little stressful to watch.

The final 15 minutes makes even less sense with Vega on foot being pursued by the injured abductor.  She constantly just randomly stops and looks back waiting for him to catch up for reasons I can't fathom other than the film makers had to make the film a certain length or something.  Now she'd been in fear for her life the whole time, she'd have adrenaline flowing through her veins, there is no way he'd catch her but she just keeps stopping and waiting for him like a good little abductee.  Plus, where are all the other people?  Occasionally she will run past someone who doesn't try and help her, call the cops or anything, in fact they don't even seem to notice her.  For a while I was wondering if she was the one who got shot at the start and the whole thing was a coma dream or something. It makes no sense why this guy is so obsessed with running after her, she clearly doesn't have the money he needs and so many other people would have seen him anyway if he shoots her at that point if it's just to eliminate a witness.

Vega does a very good job acting, as I said earlier her terrified suffering in the back of the jeep is quite believable, it's just a very poor script she's having to act out and the abductees are pretty dim-witted cartoon like, at least that's the way the two actors who play them perform.  The movie seems to have been shot in one long drive (for that part of it) through the streets of Chicago, possibly they were only allowed to interrupt the traffic flow for a short time and had to do it this way, as the film is obviously very low budget.  This film isn't one continuous take though, there are pauses in between the in jeep action where little side stories play out such as a guy hiding behind a rubbish bin while the girl is beaten beside the jeep on the side of the road, then we follow him through his house before he calls 911 which dispatches the dumbest and laziest cops probably ever to hit the big screen who see the same unique painted jeep but dismiss it due to one digit being different on the number plate. You also wonder why she doesn't fight and try and escape while the cop car is behind them, obviously he's not going to shoot her with the police right there.

That's the thing, the writing is so stupid to be plausible.  The film also needed a way better ending and the first 15 minutes of nonsense could have been cut out completely on the editing floor.",1416614400,,4453,4.279761904761905

8127081,1,B000FV8XQC,"A ""non-stop thriller"" this film ain't.  I could not wait for this film to finish.
It is about a young woman kidnapped by two aimless young men driving around and around and around and around Chicago with no fixed destination.  As the man who has just gotten out of jail harasses and threatens the woman, their dialogue seems like one long improvisation -- and not a good one either.
This film is known as ""Innocent"" or ""Helix.""  That confusion is indicative of the film.  Reportedly, this film's claim to fame is that it is ""told in real-time, Helix is America's first action crime drama ever to [have been shot] in one continuous take without any edits.""
One plot summary claimed that the film is ""thought-provoking.""  That much is true.  While enduring this film I kept wondering why I wasting time on it, what this film was trying to say, why I even cared, etc.",1361923200,2,864,4.577922077922078
