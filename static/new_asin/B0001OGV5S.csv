2021494,3,B0001OGV5S,"This set includes shorts from Chaplin's early career, plus ""The Kid"", his first feature. If you are looking for anything but the Keystone comedies, there are better offerings. However, this is the best quality I've seen for the 25 of Chaplin's 35 Keystone shorts included in this set. That doesn't mean they're great quality, it just means they're as good as we're probably going to get. Realize, if you've never seen them, that the Keystone comedies are quite crude in their humor and don't show the flair and originality Chaplin was demonstrating just two years later in his Mutual series. However, to get viewable copies of most of the Keystones plus a documentary, the price on this set is not bad. I make the following recommendations for everything else:

The Mutual & Essanay comedies - Go with Image Entertainment's ""The Complete Restored Essanay & Mutual Collection"". If you are interested only in the Mutual comedies, which is where Chaplin really hit his stride IMHO, go with the more recent ""Chaplin Mutual Comedies"", also by Image. The restoration on the Mutual Comedies is visibly superior to the older one that includes the Essanays.

The First National shorts and later features - Go with the two volume collection by Warner Home Video. Everything is completely restored and extra features abound.

As far as Chaplin's Keystones, this set does not include the following:
Cruel, Cruel Love (5.5/10) - found in ""The Little Tramp: The Charlie Chaplin Collection"" with good quality, but watermarked.
Mabel at the Wheel (5.3/10) - same as above.
Caught in the Rain (5.8/10)
Her Friend the Bandit (7.2/10)
Mabel's Busy Day (5.5/10)
The Property Man (6.0/10)
Gentlemen of Nerve (5.6/10)
His Trysting Place (6.6/10)
Tillie's Punctured Romance (6.7/10) - Image Entertainment has a good print of this one.
Getting Acquainted (5.8/10)
His Prehistoric Past (5.5/10)

The ratings come from a popular film database. As for the missing Keystones, other than ""Tillie's Punctured Romance"", ""Cruel,Cruel Love"", and ""Mabel at the Wheel"", I'm not sure what other DVD collections might include them.",1196812800,32,2094,5.15

8015547,1,B0001OGV5S,"I haven't even made it through the""1st"" disc (actual disc labels do not match the DVD case list) and I'm extremely disappointed.
So far, every film is horribly pixelated with terrible contrast (might be digitized copies from the ordinal prints.... back in the 70's).  We used to have these films on Super 8 (destroyed in a house fire) and protected on a 6' screen they were nice and crisp with good contrast.  If I project there copies on the same screen it looks like crap!
Also, the first film has really annoying vocal descriptions of what's happening (wtf?!?!!!).",1480118400,5,567,4.775510204081633
8015548,5,B0001OGV5S,"This collection is great! I ordered it so that we could play it on our TV during a Halloween party. The party's theme was ""Ghosts of 1916"" and all guests came dressed as someone who was alive in 1916. Charlie Chaplin was just starting in films in 1914 and was gaining popularity by 1916 so this was nice ambience for our party. The big surprise was that our 7 year-old son sat down on the couch and started laughing his head off. We didn't think he would be too interested without sound but he loved watching Charlie Chaplin! Classics never die, right? We just let the DVD run through it's entirety. I'm really happy with this new addition to our DVD collection.",1477440000,2,662,4.434426229508197
