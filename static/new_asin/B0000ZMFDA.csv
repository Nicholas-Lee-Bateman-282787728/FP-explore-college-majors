The only thing is it is mostly about driving car 20, but I would buy this again.  Especially, from this seller, it was exactly as described and I couldn't believe how quickly I received it!

1964027,5,B0000ZMFDA,"A pretty good insight into one of NASCAR's most contraversial driver's.

It truly gives great background on ""Smoke"", and how he has become such a great all around race car driver.",1168300800,,179,4.774193548387097
1964028,3,B0000ZMFDA,"The DVD is fairly good. The downfall is that it is a slick, run-over of a championship season and lacks some of the real Smoke. the dvd would be a little better with more ""behind the scenes"" of NASCAR life. But if you are a tony fan, you'll enjoy it.",1167782400,2,250,4.02
1964029,5,B0000ZMFDA,"I've been watching NASCAR for a few years now and have really become a fan.  I never followed any one driver.  Not being that familiar with racing, the only driver I knew anything about was Jeff Gordon.  But in the past couple years I've really started to pay attention to the races and the drivers.  One of them was Tony Stewart.  The one thing I really knew of Tony was that unbelievable crash at Daytona.

Everything that had been written about him was his aggressive attitude.  As I've read more about him and watched him race, what I've discovered is that aggressive attitude is an amazing passion for driving, be it stock cars, INDY cars, or midgets.  This DVD points that out.  I rented it last week and have already watched it three times.  I will be adding this to my sports media collection.",1125100800,10,801,4.5
1964030,5,B0000ZMFDA,This DVD has actually been available for a couple of months and parts are already being televised on Speed channel. This is a great way to gain insight into a driver's life. The interviews with his family and the old photos are terrific. You realize that Tony had a passion for all things racing since he was a baby. His generous spirit in regards to his charitable works is admirable. I would love to see more of these DVDs of other drivers. FYI-Dale Earnhardt Jr's DVD is being released by the same company around February 2004.,1070323200,29,530,4.53125

8004934,4,B0000ZMFDA,"It was a gift for my father.  He really enjoyed it.  It shipped quickly.  And, service was to be expected.",1363219200,,106,4.2
8004935,5,B0000ZMFDA,"Since I had been a die-hard Stewart fan for five years once ""Smoke"" was released in 2003 and two more by the time I got it in May 2005 - I began rooting for Stewart during his final Month of May as a full-time IRL driver in 1998 and he's been my racing hero since -  I knew a large chunk of the information included in the DVD. Still, there was plenty to be learned and enjoy. As such, for the casual/new Stewart fan or fans of any other driver, it is no doubt a great insight into the greatest pure racer of his generation.

""Smoke"" features a nice collection of comments and recollections from his family, friends, team members, and fellow racers and several montages of clips from throughout his racing career up to that point set to a rocking 3 Doors Down soundtrack. The meat and potatoes, of course, is Stewart himself opining on a number of topics from his 2002 championship to his intensity to his clashes with the media to the danger of racing. It gives a good look at what made the man tick in 2003, and as he doesn't seem to have changed as a person too much in the last decade (despite professional changes like becoming a team co-owner, buying Eldora Speedway, and so forth), it remains good learning material for folks who would like to know what Tony Stewart is all about.

Perhaps the only thing that could have been better were if the documentary about twice as long so more recollections about his life and career prior to reaching Winston Cup could have been included. For that, though, there is Tony's book ""True Speed,"" which was released a year prior to the DVD and features heavy focus on his ascent through the open wheel ranks and is a must-read for any racing fan.",1362700800,,1690,4.410256410256411
