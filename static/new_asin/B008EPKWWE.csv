5157022,3,B008EPKWWE,"My 4 yr old is a die hard Thomas fan. He has watched every movie on netflix and has an insane amount of Thomas the Train Toys. He found out this movie was coming out back in MARCH! I've had to hear about this movie for that long, every day!! I had this movie ready to go, the day it came out just so I could hear the end of it. However, it's too scary and now he will not watch it again. He wants me to return it. I'm not sure why these movies have to have scary parts, they are certainly not for adults. He loves all the other movies with no problems, Day in a Diesel, Misty Island, etc. This one might be a little too scary if you have a little timid child. I'm sure there are other kids that are fine with it. But in my house, my 4 yr old is too scared to watch it again.",1348099200,6,774,3.754601226993865
5157023,2,B008EPKWWE,"It's a Thomas video. Your kids either love him or hate him. My 1 and 4 year old love him, so I grab any video I can find. I can't comment on the story much; again, it's a Thomas video made for kids. What do you expect? Daring plots, suspense, and drama?

However, what I couldn't stand was the video quality. I've purchased many blu-rays in my time and have seen a lot of different video qualities all around. I must say, this is honestly one of the worst. One of the older DVD's (far cheaper) has much higher video quality. Grainy blacks and washed out colors all around. It's not my TV/setup, other blu-ray videos are simply gorgeous. This is just completely lacking all around.

Again, I understand that my 1 and 4 year old don't care about quality, but when I shell out $20+ for a blu-ray, you would think it would be at least decent quality.",1348012800,9,846,4.314465408805032
5157024,5,B008EPKWWE,"I Thought This would have a bad ending like all the other movies. but no! it was exiting, good moral, and my son loved it!",1348012800,,122,3.92
5157025,4,B008EPKWWE,"It's a Thomas movie, my son loves him so we had to buy it. Just fyi, we got this at c o s t c o for a combo dvd/blu ray pack for fourteen dollars.",1348012800,,146,3.2
5157026,5,B008EPKWWE,"Blue Mountain Mystery revolves around Luke, a small green narrow gauge engine. He's afraid he'll be sent away if anyone finds out what he did. Through investigation and hard work, Thomas befriends Luke and learns what happened. After hearing Luke's story, Thomas sets off to find the yellow engine who fell off the boat.

BMM is a major improvement from the poorly constructed ""Day of the Diesels"" and the awful ""Misty Island Rescue"". The dialogue is no longer forced and there is not exaggeration on words. The film also has some hidden easter eggs on the biggest of Thomas fans will notice. Such are: The Marklin Engine (in scrap form) at the Dieselworks, The ""Rolling Eyes"" effect, etc. It's also the first time the Narrow Gauge engines are seen in FULL CGI!

The discs, on the other hand, are a mystery themselves. This is the first Thomas disc to be released in its native 23.976 frame rate. This allows for better quality overall throughout the film. But the main problem is the audio and the length.

The film runs (on the disc) for 1:03:58. It's supposed to be 1:01:27. Somewhere along the line, the film was slowed down and can be noticed in certain audio sequences.

The 5.1 DTS Mix is another problem. There is a lot of phasing and ""channel-switching"". This can be heard during the WORKING TOGETHER song in the beginning of the film. Listen carefully to the sound effects as well. It's painful to listen to a mix THIS bad.

Overall, with all technical aspects aside, BMM is a must own for any Thomas fan. The kids, and even the adults, will enjoy this sweet tale of the little green engine.",1347926400,18,1601,4.623239436619718

5157030,2,B008EPKWWE,"HIT Entertainment doesn't seem to realize that their core Thomas customer is over Thomas at age 7, because this movie opens with small gauge engine Luke confessing to Thomas how he accidentally murdered another engine. WTF number one.

But he was being lifted by Cranky at the time so whoever was moving him and hit the yellow engine was actually at fault, yet no one at Brendam Docks seems to remember or care. WTF number two.

So Thomas, who promises to keep Luke's secret so Luke won't be kicked off the island (WTF number three -- kids should not be learning to keep secrets about bad stuff other people have done to other people, WTF 3.5 because , immediately blabs (WTF number four) to learn that the engine who was murdered is actually alive (?) and repainted and now speaks English. He is Victor, and apparently spends enough time undersea to get rusted out (WTF number five) and need almost complete rebuilding.

Anyway, the diesels overhear Thomas (the part where a train is murdered, anyway) and decide that they're going to use this gossip as a tool to ruin the steam engines or whatever (WTF number six), and then the comedy of errors commences until Luke learns he is not an accidental murderer after all.

Bear in mind I only saw the beginning and the end of the film, I skipped the middle. Yes, I left my four-year-old to watch something I found pretty disturbing so I could get some stuff done, not great. But he loves Thomas and the things that I find bad are things he doesn't even seem to notice and probably won't until he's a teenager. And there are some good messages intermingled about the importance of making yourself useful, working hard, and doing right by your friends that maybe he'll get.

But in the meantime, I have to wonder if HIT Entertainment knows anything about their core Thomas audience and does any research into what is and is not appropriate for those ages. I am positive that, unlike other PBS banner shows like Daniel Tiger and Sesame Street, there is no panel of childhood development experts working on storylines, characters, or checking for scary content. Which is too bad, because as big a powerhouse as Thomas is, it needs to stop being cheap on its content side.

One star for the animation, another for keeping my kid's attention for an hour, and six known WTFs.",1506902400,,2316,4.636585365853659
5157031,4,B008EPKWWE,"This movie is a huge step up from previous movies like Misty Island Rescue and Day of the Diesels. The plot was good. The references to classic Thomas episodes (A Scarf for Percy, The Sad Story of Henry and Down the Mine) are good. Paxton was a good character in the movie and was very funny. Luke is adorable and his backstory was great. Owen and Merrick add a nice touch to the quarry even though they don't really do much. Winston is really bland. I'm glad Victor got a big role and also had a good backstory. I'm also really happy that the narrow gauge engines (Skarloey, Rheneas, Sir Handel, Peter Sam and Rusty) returned to the show. I liked some action packed scenes in the movie like when Luke saved Thomas from falling of the cliff, However the narrow gauge engines running away from Thomas while was trying to tell them about Luke from what Victor said to him, and how does The Thin Controller (Mr Percival) not know there is another engine (Luke) working on his railway. Overall this movie was very good and had some very heart warming scenes too. Not bad at all.",1505606400,,1074,4.429292929292929

5157060,4,B008EPKWWE,"My boys enjoy watching this Thomas movie. It has some good points about helping others and the new engine, Luke, is a cute and friendly character.

As an adult, I get a little frustrated that the story conflict is not very logical. The basic plot is that Luke feels guilty for causing an accident and has spent his life hiding in fear that he will be sent away. The problem is that really the workers, or Cranky the Crane, are responsible, if anyone is going to take the blame.  Why doesn't anyone bring this up? Wouldn't Sir Toppum Hat wonder where the engine went that he had ordered, and then had to have repaired? He evidently never looked for him as he acts like he's never heard of Luke before.  And the incident obviously wasn't a major catastrophe since Cranky barely remembers it when Thomas asks him for info.  Just because the movie is made for kids doesn't mean the plot shouldn't make any sense. This is almost more of a story about letting guilt distort the truth and ruin your life, which is a little deep for young kids!

But other than the plot issues, the movie has cute songs and good graphics and will be enjoyed by most young Thomas the Tank Engine fans.",1474416000,3,1175,4.421296296296297

In this excellent movie featuring the beloved blue steamie Thomas, trouble strikes at the Blue Mountain Quarry and Thomas is sent to help out his Narrow Gauge engine friends! While being really useful, he discovers a little green engine that hides in the tunnels. Thomas is determined to find out the mystery of this little green engine but getting to the truth is harder than he thought. Will he be able to help his new friend and get to the bottom of the mystery or will the little green engine be sent away from Sodor?! You'll have to watch and find out what happens.

My 4 year old loves this movie. It introduces new friends Owen, Merrick, Luke, and Winston and includes a set of fun new songs. This movie is sure to delight any Thomas fan and, like other Thomas movies, shows what it takes to be a friend and to help others in their time of need.

5157230,5,B008EPKWWE,"Personally, this is my favorite full-length Thomas movie.

Thomas is sent to help out at the Blue Mountain Quarry, and quickly notices a small, green engine darting around the tunnels. None of the narrow-gauge engines will even acknowledge the presence of the little green engine, but Thomas refuses to give up trying to discover who he is. When the little green engine is caught out in the middle of the quarry in front of Thomas one day, the narrow gauge engines help him escape but then reveal to Thomas that his name is Luke, and that he's hiding so that he won't be sent away from Sodor. When Thomas reveals himself to be a trustworthy friend, Luke shares the details of his story but begs Thomas not to say anything to anyone. Paxton overhears the story, telling Diesel, who makes it his mission to have Luke sent away. Thomas takes up a mission of his own, to keep Luke's confidence but help him realize it's all a misunderstanding and can easily be explained.

Luke is meek, kind, and a hard-worker. I just love his character. He's a refreshing character to see on screen and he truly makes this movie. His story is interesting and I found myself on the edge of my seat (yes, even with a kids' movie), hoping it would all work out for him and that Thomas would clear his name. It's a great lesson in keeping the confidences your friends share with you, going to the source of a story instead of believing gossip, and also standing up for your friends when they're in trouble.",1413504000,,1483,4.5092936802973975

That's all he wants to see, so I had to buy it for my iPad, but you need the Amazon app to view it.  Apple won't allow Flash Player or MS Silverlight to run on iPads.",1378944000,,306,3.9672131147540983

5157351,5,B008EPKWWE,"Having recently watched ""Day of the Diesels"" (which I couldn't stand), I had very low expectations for ""Blue Mountain Mystery"".  However, I must say, I was really surprised at how much I even enjoyed watching this movie.

Like ""Day of the Diesels"", this movie covers territory that many kids' movies and books have covered, in this case dealing with feeling as though one has done something so unforgivable that one must hide or run away.  Among the nice things about this adventure is that Thomas remains the main character of the film, but he's trying to figure out the circumstances of something that happened long ago, hence the mystery.  In his quest, at one point the engines in Tidmouth sheds are recalling incidents where they didn't do the right thing, and still didn't get sent away - even (the sometimes devious) Diesel.  (It illustrates very nicely the idea that parents don't withdraw love from children just because they are naughty.)

In any case, this is a really sweet, really watchable movie, and I hope that any other Thomas movies following it take their cue for telling a compelling story from this one.",1378252800,,1124,4.828125
5157352,3,B008EPKWWE,"Not the best Thomas movie that they have come up with.
My little boy is an avid 'Thomas' fanatic. (Toys, backpack, T-shirt, sleeping bag, etc.)
However, on this movie, my little man tuned out 1/3 of the way into the movie.
Most of the movie has dark colored scenes and tonal values.  No brightness or vivid colors at all.
We (parents) are wondering if this is a reason why our toddler tuned out so quickly.  Other Thomas
movies and cartoons he sits glued to the screen all the way to the ending credits.
Definitely a dud with our little man.",1377561600,,541,4.4
5157353,1,B008EPKWWE,"First, if the reader wishes to introduce their child(ren) to Christian morality tales/legends through entertainment they would be better served with titles from the ""Veggie Tales"" franchise.

With that noted; what must be written about ""Blue Mountain Mystery"" (and holds true for all the Thomas the Train DVDs--at least those titles that I have brought into my home) is simply that ""The Blue Mountain Mystery"" title--and by extension the entire franchise--overtly presents an ideological imperative for capitalism as the highest good and couples that ideological primacy to the Christian ethic of material subordination as the most natural role for the individual.

While certainly the franchise is intended for children one is remiss to simply overlook the franchise's value system. If we were to follow the value system present in the Thomas the Train series to its logical conclusion we would all be happy slaves to a fascist idealogical construct. To my mind with an ever careful consideration to my child's entertainment consumption, the DVD and the other Thomas the Train titles are more than just a little disturbing--they appear as something just short of propaganda cloaked in animation.

I would almost prefer that my son watch the sexist and misogynistic leanings of Disney's 'princess films' rather than the Thomas the Train series but I fear the wrath of my daughters.",1376352000,,1381,5.2681818181818185

5157363,2,B008EPKWWE,"I realize most people have given this video sterling reviews and I'm going to be in the minority, but here it is:

I do not want my child learning that when he does ""bad"" (a word we don't even use in my house) things he has to hide because he could ""be sent away forever"" (exact verbiage from the film and it is repeated over, and over, and over, and over again). Sorry, not my cup of tea. I don't want him learning that keeping secrets is okay or that his mother and father won't listen to him if he has a problem or concern. The moral of the story is given at the end of the film like in all stories, but studies indicate that children under the age of 6 are not able to extract a lesson at the end - they only manage to get a lesson out of small chunks of the story.

I'm not a big fan of Thomas stuff anyway because it tends to come from a more authoritarian and punitive viewpoint but this film really tipped the scale for me. We are done with Thomas.

The only reason I gave this 2 instead of 1 stars is because my son likes it. Sadly.",1369526400,4,1041,3.947619047619048

5157423,3,B008EPKWWE,"It is a good a story, but my son prefers the old way of animating Thomas, and I do as well.  If you do not mind getting creaped out by the overly emphatic mouth movements and the lack of rustic charm found in the old series, you might rate this a 4 or more, but we didn't like it, so it gets a 3.",1355011200,3,296,3.625

5157449,5,B008EPKWWE,"My boys love Thomas movies and this one is of course their new favorite!  With new characters (train, crane and more) it makes for new fun and excitement for kids.  My boys love seeing the new characters, which of course then they want to own!  ""Blue Mountain Mystery"" is a simple mystery for kids, which my 5 year old is totally into right now.  He is so curious and loves to try to figure things out.  The dialogue is simple and easy enough for young kids to understand, especially compared to the usual language of weird sayings they use.  This one has some action, but nothing really inappropriate (although it may be scary in some scenes but my boys weren't afraid.)  This movie comes after ""Day of the Diesels"" (I think) and I actually like this one a lot more.  I feel like the Thomas movies have improved and my boys have watched this one a million times already!",1350345600,8,871,4.433962264150943

5157451,5,B008EPKWWE,"My Thomas loving 4 year old saw this at the store and just had to have it (the movie at the store came with the take n play train Norman, which the character isn't even in the movie, so not sure why they packaged it with that train). I have to say that it's a pretty cute Thomas movie, much better than Day of The Diesels that was released last year :-)",1349827200,,353,3.9166666666666665
5157452,5,B008EPKWWE,"The movie was like most of the other Thomas movies, where there is a lesson to learn. Basically we are taught not to jump to conclusions, and to hear all parts of a story before forming an opinion. I thought it was great that my 6 year old asked questions and by the end learned that things are not always as they seem. He loves it and like all the others he has, has watched it at least 6 or 7 times already.",1349481600,3,409,3.9397590361445785

Even better that I can dfownload it and she can watch it on her Kindle anywhere which you can't do with the Prime shows.",1349481600,,343,3.816901408450704
5157454,5,B008EPKWWE,"My son got this for his 3rd birthday. The story has some suspenseful parts that kept him cheering on Thomas. He was very into it. It had a bit more drama than a typical Thomas story. Like a bridge falling down, or an engine falling in the water. But the engines, of course, can put aside their personal feelings and come to the rescue. He really likes this movie, and I'm glad I purchased it.",1349222400,,392,4.24
5157455,5,B008EPKWWE,"Since getting this movie last week, my son has watched it so much that he has it memorized.  There are new characters so he is very excited about that and a few new songs that get played endlessly.  This appears to be his favorite Thomas movie so far.",1348617600,,251,4.208333333333333
5157456,5,B008EPKWWE,"My youngest daughter enjoys watching Thomas The Train. We actually have even gone so far as to have visited Thomas twice in past years on Day Out With Thomas Events in our area (She is that much of a fan). With that in mind, she was excited to see this movie, as she had not as of yet. We have seen other Thomas movies, and all were always fun, with valuable lessons contained, usually about friendship and teamwork among other messages. This movie was no different in that aspect. The movie itself was engaging and kept my daughter's attention from beginning to end. My daughter loved the Working Together song and I know that is we had this on a CD we would be hearing it played over and over again. All-in-all this was a great movie with some new characters that you have not seen before. If your child is already a fan, or has just started getting to know Thomas, this is a must have for the home!",1348185600,,901,4.305882352941176
