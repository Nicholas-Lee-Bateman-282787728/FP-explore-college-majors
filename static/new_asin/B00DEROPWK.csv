8592682,5,B00DEROPWK,"What a lovely thing to own, picture and sound beautiful and so is the production, the entire scene at the ball is eye-popping from choreography to costumes. So happy.",1498867200,,166,4.758620689655173
8592683,3,B00DEROPWK,"First a clarification about this listing. It is NOT an ""Italian Edition,"" but a regular U.S./U.K. region-free release. The Amazon lister was apparently misled by the Italian title (""Cenerentola"") of the ballet. Now on to the content: I am an admirer of Christopher Wheeldon's work, and particularly of his ""Winter's Tale,"" which is certainly one of the most important pieces of choreography in the past ten years. However, truth be told, this particular work is not his strongest. He always has had a fondness (weakness) for ""silent movie pantomime"" and there is more of that in this piece than of demanding, complex dancing (and even less partnering). There is also a problem with the sound mix on the disk itself. The bass-level has been boosted to the EQ of pop music, unfortunately. It caught me completely by surprise since this is very unusual in a classical concert presentation, and it mars the effect of the music. However, with those caveats, for a light evening's entertainment, you could do worse, much worse. And if you want to do better, much better, check out the Blu-Ray of Wheeldon's ""Winter's Tale"" as dazzlingly produced by the Royal Opera House/Royal Ballet. His ""Alice in Wonderland"" is also worth considering, as are some of his more abstract one-act pieces.",1489104000,7,1280,4.985981308411215

8592686,5,B00DEROPWK,"I searched and searched for a copy of this (finally buying one from the Royal Opera House in England) and it was worth it.  This is an outstanding production with clever scenery and special effects, beautiful costumes, really good choreography and wonderful dancing.  Yes, the story is a little different, following much more the Grimm version than the other we normally see.  However, the DVD offers a commentary by Wheeldon and his assistant so I watched that first and learned a lot both about the story and the rest of the production.  It really enhanced my enjoyment and I wish other ballets offered this extra.
Larissa Lezhnina did the greatest ""drunken stepmother at ball"" dance.  She obviously had the time of her life with the character.  Anna Tsygankova and Matthew Golding were really good partnership in several productions and this one is no exception.
I'd give this one 10 stars if I could",1451260800,3,903,4.869281045751634
8592687,4,B00DEROPWK,"After much searching, I've finally found a ballet version of Cinderella that satisfies me. It's not perfect, but it's great. It follows the Brothers Grimm version of the fairy tale, so there is no fairy godmother character.  Instead, the tree grows on Cinderella's mother's grave, like in the Grimm story, and dancers represent her mother watching over and providing for her.  What I like best is that both Cinderella and the Prince characters are developed.  We see them in scenes as children, and they meet as adults before the ball, which makes the romance much more satisfying and believable.  Christopher Wheeldon choreographed this version, and he also created one of my favourite ballets, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.  The plot takes a page from the 1998 movie Ever After, and has one stepsister be kinder than the other, and she ends up with the Prince's best friend (something similar also happened in the recent Broadway version of Cinderella).  I am much more of a storytelling fan than a ballet fan (I have no dance experience or knowledge of choreography, only a love of watching ballet) and this version is excellent.  The costumes are lovely, and I especially enjoyed the performance by the Prince's friend.",1437264000,,1227,5.014778325123153
