4597888,4,B0057ZIE92,"If you've never been captivated by the magic of Tiger Stadium on a Saturday night, this documentary will bore you to tears. But if you've been there and grew up pulling for LSU and were there with your Dad and all the other screaming Tiger Fans, you will enjoy the history, the film clips, the interviews and will be pulled back in time as the memories come flooding back. The beginning is a bit slow and the old film reel interludes get old fast, but it picks up steam and you become grateful that someone got these people on film before more of them pass. Paul Dietzel, Billy Cannon, Jerry Stovall and so many of the old and new legends comment and tell interesting stories. Tommy Casanova, George Bevan, Bert Jones and all the great players from the 60's and 70's. Coach Mac. Nick Saban. Les Miles. John Ed Bradley was particularly eloquent. You only wish there were more clips and longer stories from all of these guys. The ladies wearing their dresses and high heels to games. Players playing both ways. It's a bygone era and this film will remind you of all that and more. Now, can someone tell me where to find one of those big, heavy bottom drinking glasses that had the 1958 games and scores on them. This film made me think of that glass that was in our house in the 60's and 70's and all the wonderful memories of cheering for the Tigers on Saturday Night in Death Valley (where it did rain on us once when we played Mississippi State in the 60's).",1324252800,4,1459,4.387453874538745
4597889,2,B0057ZIE92,"rather detailed, good historical information about LSU football but told in a rather boring manner. Not enough football game footage, sometimes disjointed in telling the story of LSU football",1322352000,2,191,5.620689655172414

4597892,5,B0057ZIE92,Bought this DVD for my father in law after seeing it on TV. Our family is die hard LSU football fans so it was a great documentary for us to watch.,1341792000,,147,3.774193548387097
4597893,4,B0057ZIE92,"Old War Skule was one of those films that I'd wanted to see since I saw a billboard advertising it in Baton Rouge. As a LSU graduate I had spent many Saturdays in Tiger Stadium and I thought a film about LSU football history would be a good way to spend a weeknight. Little was I prepared for this three hour comprehensive history of the team.

Narrated by John Goodman in a folksy tone, the film covers the history of the team and it's coaches and players from 1893 until. 2007. The film also covers so much more that it's hard to know where to begin. We get the story of the band and it's music, some Louisiana politics curtesy of Huey Long and a good deal of what type of character it takes to both wear and play for the purple and gold.

The film is divided by decades and the story from the 1950's through the present is the most well covered. I remember many of the featured games and it was fun to see the highlights again. Who could forget Billy Cannon's run or the ""bluegrass miracle"" ?  There are also interesting segments on the making of the championship trophy and rings.

If there is one shortfall here it is that the special features are only accessible online instead of on the disc itself. This is an excellent low priced feature that should be seen by LSU fans and college football fans in general. Highly recommended.",1339718400,,1336,4.353413654618474
4597894,5,B0057ZIE92,"This is a very well narrated, informative, and entertaining movie.  I enjoyed it a great deal and definitely feel like I got my money's worth.  I am even more proud to be an alumni of the ""Ole War Skule"" after watching this. Geaux Tigers!",1330732800,,238,4.386363636363637

4597898,5,B0057ZIE92,"Our whole family has enjoyed 'Ole War Skule' - the DVD - a History of LSU Football. I'd given my husband a gift certificate from Amazon for his birthday and one of the things he chose to get was this DVD. We recently loaned it to a friend who liked it so much he is ordering one of his own and one for his dad, an avid LSU football fan and season ticket holder for over 40 years.  I'm sure this DVD will go viral!!! Geaux Tigers!",1325808000,,429,3.9310344827586206
4597899,5,B0057ZIE92,"I got this for my dad for Christmas, and we watched it together Christmas morning. He couldn't pull himself away from the tv to go check on the turkey! I'm a huge Tigers fan (I was raised right!), my dad an even bigger fan. We both enjoyed it. Very informative and interesting. You learn a lot about the history of the game, the team. Coaches, players, and cheerleaders past and present talk about their experience (Hey Nick Saban!). You see the preparations before the game, old game footage, I could go on. John Goodman did an excellent job narrating this documentary. The fact that my dad who isn't into movies, sat down and watched this really says something! It's perfect for any LSU fan. Geaux Tigers!!!",1325116800,3,709,4.634920634920635
