2067296,4,B00028G4WS,"My son is a huge Caillou fan. I personally cannot stand the little brat (Caillou) and want the Canadian government to compensate me for pain in suffering for creating this cartoon. But alas, my little boy loves Caillou. The video makes my son laugh and has taught him to look beyond his usual play. He has interjected into his own vocabulary some of the Caillou-isms (""Gilbert, you silly cat"") into his every day life. Which is a good thing. It's a better video than most of the series (that have the weird little puppet Gilbert, Teddy and Rexy) and enjoyable for the Caillou fanatic in your life.",1232150400,5,597,4.588785046728972

8023610,2,B00028G4WS,"I don't know what to say about this dvd.  It has episodes, but these weird real person and puppet skits in between that my kids hate.  The quality of the video is not that great.  It is almost not clear.  My kids like Caillou, but this dvd is not press play and leave it.  I have to skip past all the skits, etc.  There are puppets!!!!",1242864000,12,335,4.0
