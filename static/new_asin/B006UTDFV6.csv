8504766,3,B006UTDFV6,"Wagner's Meistersinger is one of the longest operas iin the repertoire. . For a first class performance it requires singers of talent, stamina, musicianshiip and artistry. It also demands musicians and a conductor of similar talents. I know nothing of Nurember's opera company nor of the Staatsphilharmonie Nurnberg. To the best of my knowledge this is a debut recording for all concerned. I am curious as to the audience that the producers were aiming for. The cost of the DVD is reasonable but for a few dollars more either Bayreuth I or II is available as well as a wonderful production from Deutsch Oper and the set that has garnered most of the reviews, the Met's with James Morris, Ben Heppner and Thomas Allen. Then there is Bayreuth III for which the composer's granddaughter, Katarina must bear responsibility; this set has been savaged by audiences and critics. There is also a production from Zurich and one from Australia. And I nearly forgot, one from Vienna. Have I left any out?

How does one judge a performance such as this? On a positive note I must applaud the musicians of the orchestra and the conductor. It is a tribute to schools of music that these players possess the dedication and artistry at this high level. At no point do they flag in their performance--for an opera this long that is no mean feat. And after all it is necessary to start somewhere, e.g;, Karajan's initial engagement was in Aachen. Whether the conductor, Marcus Bosch will become a ""star"" conductor can not be decided on the basis of this performance, but it can't hurt. But what of the singers? Here the answer must be mixed. The theatre appears to be a relatively small one so that the question of stamina is less of a problem than in a larger house. How many von Stolzings have arrived at the second scene of Act III already played out? In this case Michael Putsch who sings von Stolzing wisely doesn't attempt any vocal heroics. However, it should be added that his performance can best be described as adequate. The Eva is a young attractive lyric soprano who might be in trouble if the house were larger and she is stressed by the passage beginning with Gut'n aben Meister which calls for spinto tones which are not hers to give. Our Hans Sachs, Albert Pesendorfer, is best described as routine. Perhaps if his acting skills were better his somewhat dry voice would have been less obvious. Perhaps this is something that is noticeable because a camera is frequently focused on him; the audience in the house probably would not be aware of what looks to be a perpetual scowl. I find that the voice lacks the warmth and humanity of a great Sachs. The David is somewhat better than adequate, but hyper active; the Beckmesser adequate as well.

It is better to draw a  weil over the sets; they are props that have been placed around the stage and unfortunately are not evocative of anything in particular. In the second act you would not know that the action takes place between Sachs' and Pogner's houses from what the set designer has provided. I have no doubt that financial constraints were largely responsible for this. This does lead me to reveal the fact that we have time traveled to what  looks like the middle of the 20th century; however, we have nothing like Bayreuth III which I gather is bizarre in the extreme. The set under consideraton is simply conventional except with regard to the costumes; there is nary a ""konzept"" in sight. At the end the audience applauds wildly for the musicians and singers but boos the director and his associates. I'm not quite sure this was justified, but in a democracy we are entitled to express our opinion and regie (again this was not a regie  production) has come in
for its share of criticsm--even in the country that has spawned it.

Why did I buy this set? Good question. I'm not even that happy with Bayreuth II except for Barenboim's conducting. I bought the Vienna set because it was a Vienna State Opera production and because of the conductor Thielemann  but the visual aspect of a 300 pound von Stolzing and  a thoroughly mediocre Eva conspire to  make me pass on this set. I find myself reaching for Bayreuth I and Deutsch Oper; they are both eminently satisfying and both have what for me are the best Sachs available and an overall high level of artistry from all the artists concerned. I can't ask for more. I have omitted  the Hamburg set since it is a film and this means the artists have been lip synched. Additionally it is cut. But it does have is one overriding virtue, Giorgio Tozzi's superb Sachs. When I can  be satisfied with the two great monologues I find this greatly underrated artist the most moving.

Incidental intelligence: there is a bonus provided. It is a series of conversations with the conductor and director; the language is German. Alas there are no subtitles provided although there are English subtitles for the opera.",1332201600,8,4911,4.677867902665121
