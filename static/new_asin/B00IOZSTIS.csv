6284540,4,B00IOZSTIS,"Once Upon a Time in Vietnam was an interesting example of how martial arts can be used to support a film's plot, instead of martial arts becoming the center of the story.

The film takes place in a fantasy world which is neither futuristic, nor set in the past. Instead, it had elements of both, although I'd say, the past gets more attention overall, since the weapons being used were mostly blades. However, in the next scene, Dustin Nguyen can be seen riding around on a motorcycle. It was a novel approach, however, the film could have been left as a period piece and worked just as well. What the fantasy element really did for the film, was allowed it to have modern to futuristic costumes.

Style and concept aside, the story was still good in its own right. The plot involved, Ahn, (Veronica Ngo) a deserter from the Emperor's Imperial Army. Her reasons for desertion were noble, since she wished to live a normal life. Imperial guards are forbidden to form relationships with one another and that's part of the reason for her dilemma. She eventually settles in a quiet village where she marries a baker and raises her son.

Eventually, another Imperial Soldier, Dao (Dustin Nguyen) reaches her village and tells her she must go back with him. This causes a problem for her, but in reality the dilemma is larger than we're led to believe. It turns out, deserters are supposed to be executed. So Dustin Nguyen is actually not following protocol by asking her to come with him. Instead, he should be trying to kill her.

Eventually a trio of soldiers track down Dao, who confront him over the situation. He battles them in saloon/brothel where he is slightly wounded. Also, Ahn's husband begins to realize that his choice to be married to an Ex-soldier is not the best lifestyle for him. It makes him a target as well. This causes a division between the couple and brings Ahn to the decision to leave. But before she can go, Roger Yuan, shows up. He's an elite guard and has the power to use fire in his martial arts. He and Dao battle at first, but eventually Ahn is brought into the fray. A series of twists and turns occur, especially involving Ahn's son, until the film reaches a conclusion. I won't spoil it for you.

Well this was a well-made production. It definitely had a different flavor to it then a Chinese Martial Arts film. In this film, the story is the main focus. The martial arts are more of a vehicle to help tell the story. That being said, the marital arts were good, but they weren't spectacular. There were definitely times where close camera angles were used, most likely to mask lower skilled attacks by the actors. I don't have a beef with that approach in general, I'm just pointing it out. Not everyone can be Jackie Chan. However, I think Dustin Nguyen and Veronica Ngo are both capable of performing better fights. The Vietnamese film, the Rebel comes to mind.

In any case, the special powers were a rather interesting addition. Yuan, of course had the fire attack and Nguyen had an ice-like or power attack. The more interesting attack was actually Ngo's, which gave her the ability to see her attack before she executed it. It could still be thwarted sometimes, but it was an interesting skill nonetheless.

Anyway the film is offered in Vietnamese and includes an English dub. There are also some behind the scenes interviews on the DVD and Blu-ray versions.

In the end, I gave the film a four. I thought the basic story was good. The fights and martial arts were also decent. I also liked the filming style and locations. However, the film had a deeper fantasy element embedded in the story which wasn't examined very well. For example, we saw illustrated pictures of soldiers and tanks involved in a battle of some sort, apparently from the world's past. But the film never went into that storyline. My only complaint, if any, would be to see more of this world, in the event that a sequel is made. Again it was a good story on its own, but the background world had a lot of potential, which got overlooked in my opinion. Otherwise a decent rental or possible purchase if you like martial arts films that rely more on the story instead of the fights.",1405900800,4,4193,4.588785046728972

Battle action has lots of fast/slow/stop camera and other effects, mixing martial arts, swordplay, and sorcery.  Indoor scenes look ancient.  Outdoor scenes look like a dusty western cowboy town.  The townfolk scurry away leaving the street clear for each showdown.  Outside town we have a desolate highway with trucks and motorcycles from a sci-fi dystopian future.

8644328,3,B00IOZSTIS,"Even though&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Rebel/dp/B0018PH3NS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Rebel</a>&nbsp;placed Vietnam on the map as a supplier of martial arts fare, the countrys relatively meager output makes it easy to forget about that over time. With Vietnamese action flicks finding international release at a rate of maybe one every two years, the need for quality among these films is extra important, and disappointingly, the 2013 entry  Once Upon a Time in Vietnam - falls short. Exceling on some fronts, floundering on others, and simply overdoing it otherwise, this minor epic scrapes an average but unenthusiastic rating from me. Its easy to imagine how cool this could have been had it a bit more sense when it came to some important aspects.

The story: In a time when Vietnam is protected by an army of elite warrior-monks, one of their number (Dustin Nguyen,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Game-of-Assassins/dp/B00LEK4E34/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Game of Assassins</a>) arrives in a rural town on a mission and is forced to confront his past in the form of a forbidden lover (Veronica Ngo).

The movie looks great, with a striking art design. A mixture of steampunk and video game-style fantasy makes for a visual tone thats simultaneously unique and familiar. Ive never seen its likes on film before, and the producers keep this look consistent, with even the being CGI well-integrated. The story, on the other hand, is less consistent. The plot starts out as director Dustin Nguyens take on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yojimbo/dp/B000K0YLZ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yojimbo</a>, but levels off into a family drama and a love angle between Nguyen and Ngo. The characters have their entertaining moments, especially Thai Hoa in his role as Ngos husband, but they're not so intriguing that Im on the edge of my seat to see how they work out their problems. Quite the opposite  Im slumped in my chair, waiting for the matter of Ngos sons paternity be solved so I can get back to the action scenes.

These action scenes are also a mixed bag. Nguyen can be one of the best kickers in the business if offered the opportunity, Ngo is still among our brightest hopes for a new female action lead, and B-movie dragon Roger Yuan (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shanghai-Noon/dp/B00003CXJ1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shanghai Noon</a>)  showing up in the last half-hour as the villain  always has something good to add, but their fights just aren't up to the standard karate junkies are looking for. For the most part, the brawls are modeled after modern Hong Kong output, which means that theres some wirework and a lot of unnecessary slow motion. These eyesores aren't omnipresent, and occasionally the choreography and pacing of a fight are good enough to power through these unwanted excesses, but unless you're a fan of overly-artistic kung fu, you won't find maximum enjoyment. Most action fans have seen these kinds of matches before, performed a lot better.

Id love to see Dustin refine his style of action filmmaking, but if this is the kind of work he intends to produce in the future, I will be a lot less eager to see subsequent directorial efforts. Rent this as a take-it-or-leave-it adventure, but do not expect to find a new favorite.",1450310400,,3443,5.6204238921001926
