6014918,4,B00FMISRJG,"Well, I've started watching the DVD's of this...  very bizarre... cartoon series.

Yes, it was a bad idea, and it should have never been done.  And yet...

As I've been watching the show, I find that I can not stop laughing.  Yes, Elmyra's character is devoid of her best parts, but the sheer absurdity of many of the cartoons is something that you can't help but laugh at.  The writers and the voice artists really tried hard to make this a good cartoon.  The premise may be seriously flawed, but they did find a way to make it surprisingly funny.  And the dialog, at times, is really very good.

There are also a lot of in jokes in the show that only real fans of Tiny Toons will get, such as an add for the Acme Acres Zoo on Elmyra's wall, the RED CRAYON, so labeled, on her desk, and a few other such things.  It's worth watching.

As far as the DVD's go, they are bare bones.  No bonus features, at least not on disc one.  Not checked disc two yet, but I don't expect there to be any.

Take if for what it's worth, and run with it.

The four stars is based on the flawed premise more than anything else.  And the way Elmyra was dumbed down.  (Watch Tiny Toons, and you'll know how that is possible!)",1396310400,6,1204,4.165217391304348
6014919,5,B00FMISRJG,"I loved it during my childhood and I love it now.
Pinky and the Brain was getting stale towards in the end and by adding Elmyra they made it a completely new show.
Although her being annoying sometimes it did add a fun new flavor to the show!
Great for kids and adults!",1395792000,2,269,4.09433962264151
6014920,4,B00FMISRJG,"This show is basically a spin-off of a spin-off spinning off two award-winning hit series !  Kinda makes you dizzy just thinking about it, doesn't it ?

Well, that's what ""Pinky, Elmyra and the Brain"" is basically.  Long story short, after another attempt at global domination goes horribly wrong, the little mouse with big plans know as The Brain and his crazy cohort Pinky have accidentally destroyed their laboratory and suddenly wind up in a pet store.  And if things couldn't get worse, the two rodents are suddenly purchased by ""Tiny Toons"" character Elmyra !  Even though they're now under a new roof, that doesn't mean our small schemers are up to their usual plans as long as Elmyra and her unconditional love of cute critters stays out of their way.

This complete series set has all 13 episodes on two discs such as:

""Patty Ann"" - The Brain utilizes a mechanical suit like that time he competed in a TV game show only this version makes him look like a little girl.  The only problem is that Rudy, the boy next door Elmyra has a crush on, falls in love with The Brain's new persona.
""Gee, Your Hair Spells Terrific"" - The Brain helps Elmyra win a spelling bee in order to win the big cash prize involved.
""The Cat Who Cried Woof"" - In order to keep Elmyra's cat Mr. Pussy Wussy from chasing Pinky and Brain, Brain concocts a formula making the cat think he's a dog !
""The Girl With Nothing Extra"" - The Brain tries to make Elmyra the most popular kid in school so he can achieve world domination through her and her antics.
""The Icky Mouse Club"" - If he can round up the neighborhood kids into a group, then maybe The Brain will be accepted as the kids' leader in the future.
""Pinky's Dream House"" - Pinky and Brain start living in a doll house fabricated by Elmyra as a request by Pinky himself.
""How I Spent My Weekend"" - Elmyra tells a story of how she, Brain and Pinky traveled to France in order to conquer the world with Brain's giant robot.
""A Walk in the Park"" - The Brain tries to switch the music to a theme park ride with a hypnotic version he created.
""Squeeze Play"" - Rudy steals The Brain's latest invention, thus he and Pinky must get it back.  However, there's only one obstacle they must surpass: Rudy's pet snake Tunk !
""Teleport A Friend"" - At the county fair, The Brain tries out his portable teleporter, but gets accidentally fused with Elmyra.  Brain has no choice but to pin his hopes on Pinky who falls in love with a pig.
""Fun, Time and Space"" - The Brain attempts to create his own black hole only to realize it's more unstable than he thought.
""Hooray for Meat"" - In his Patty Ann suit, The Brain attempts to be crowned ""Meat Queen"" so he can rule the world through meat by-products.
""The Mask of Braino"" - Not ""Drano"", ""Braino"", the masked persona The Brain undergoes in an attempt to earn the citizens' respect as their hero.

No matter how crazy they may be, The Brain's attempts at taking over the world - and his ""potty-mouth"" words - may not go as he expected, so don't hold your breath.  But there's at least one song in every episode which makes the series as interesting as the shows they're stemming from.  Not sure if this one and only season would re-air on the Hub Network, but at least you have the DVD set anyway.",1393545600,14,3267,4.389072847682119
6014921,4,B00FMISRJG,"Better than the critics gave it credit for. Pinky, Elmyra, and the Brain may not have been the most popular rendition of the Animaniacs' spin-off, but any Pinky and the Brain is far better than no Pinky and the Brain.

The most controversial part of the show is the addition of the character of Elmyra from Tiny Toons, whom the Brain amusingly refers to as ""the oaf."" Fans of the original pairing may not like her, but she does give the two mice something new to play off of, as she continually refers to the cerebrally enhanced rodent as ""Cranky big Head Mousie.""

PEB has some great new running gags, and one has to give the writers credit for trying. Willy Faust, the new villain of the series, is great as he attempts to capture P&B for his conspiracy's evil purposes.

One episode has an excellent ""My Fair Lady"" spoof entitled ""My Fair Brainy,"" with Elmyra standing in for Eliza Doolittle. Of course there's the typical parody songs of the musical, and really they're not half bad.

Give this series a try. It may be the last time we see Pinky and the Brain for quite awhile.

6014922,4,B00FMISRJG,"Since Pinky, Elmyra and the Brain ran from 1998 to 1999, it was past my childhood and before my kids so this is actually the first time Ive seen it, even though I remember hearing a lot about it.

I watched it on my own before letting my kids watch since Id never seen the show before and a few minutes in, I knew Id made the right call. While I know my four and five year olds would enjoy the silly characters and the wacky plot lines, I would not want them imitating the behavior and language that they hear.

I think older kids might be better suited for this show but my kids are at the age that they copy everything they see and hear. While I was amused and laughed out loud a lot, there is bit too much sarcasm and name calling for my kids to be watching. I feel like this is one of those cartoons that is actually geared more towards adults with jokes only adults would get and terms like peeping Tom used that I don't really want to have to explain to my kids.

That being said, I was thoroughly entertained! I loved Elmira and her ridiculous personality and antics. Pinky and the Brain and perfect sidekicks. I especially like Brains grumpiness and sarcastic comments.

If you are a fan of Pinky, Elimra and the Brain, the Complete Series is a must have for every fan! Id just do a preview before watching with little ones.",1390953600,2,1332,4.232283464566929

6014924,4,B00FMISRJG,"The original Pinky and the Brain was one of my favorite cartoons of the 90s but this spinoff fell into obscurity and I didn't catch much of it. Having rediscovered the series, I watched a few episodes and couldn't see why it's labeled as the abomination of Spielberg's creations. The humor is still there since I found myself laughing out loud as much as the original series. The removing of the ""Are you pondering what I'm pondering?"" gag didn't detract much since they found other ways to make it work. Even still, you have to give Rob Paulsen, Maurice LaMarche and the writers credit since they took this in stride and gave it their all.

All in all, it's worth checking out.",1443225600,8,678,4.557377049180328

6014928,2,B00FMISRJG,The original Pinky and the Brain series was much better.  This one lacks the technical and political humor.  Pinky and the Brain live with Elmyra in her home and no longer in the laboratory.  It's more suited for small children to watch.

6014932,5,B00FMISRJG,"Pinky, Elmyra and the Brain constitutes an offshot of the ever popular offshot, Pinky and the Brain, which was prominently featured in the animated series, Anamaniacs, produced by Steven Spielberg for Warner Brothers from the brainchild of the studio janitor - that had a run of four seasons (for both but for one season for this series), and takes off from where the exploits of two laboratory mice, namely, Brain -an ostentatious, bombastic, genius, bent on an ever bumbling attempt to take over the world, and his sidekick, Pinky, a conceptual contrast whose primarily vocabulary comprise of the word, NARF, after a naughty little girl, Elmyra, accidentally buys them concealed within the shell of a turtle, following their expulsion from ACME Laboratories where they were being used as laboratory mice, and revolves around their attempts to escape Elmyra's clutches long enough to pursue Brain's attempt at world domination while evading capture from the intelligence agency - who intend to use Brain's encyclopediac knowledge of science and avant garde inventions to their advantage in the US intelligence community's attempt at world domination.

I've just played this DVD I've bought from you but I could not find the Portuguese subtitles.

In fact when I went on reading the back of the DVD box, the mentioned information is:

 Languages: English & Espaol
 Subtitles: English & Francais

This is not what is mentioned in the ""Product Details"" section of the Amazon website:

 Language: English (Dolby Digital 4.0), English (Dolby Digital 5.1)
 Subtitles: Portuguese, English

The main reason for buying this DVD was the Portuguese subtitles, I have small kids and they are not fluent in english yet.
