I even bought the Japan release because it has the extra cd in there with ALL the songs from the DVD, as a collector it is a must.

I know it is different to play one of these larger venues vs the small place here in Baton Rouge where I always see them, but you can kind of see how the base of their set-list remains unchanged no matter what. They always seem to open with Rain Man, spinkle in a few of the ""hits"", a few off the new record, and then if you are lucky you might get Things My Father Said or one of the more rarely played songs.
We always get a shorter set, but I would love to have them skip the drum solo or Boom Boom just once and play Fade Away ... my favorite song of theirs, and everyone I know loves it, but being a B side it never gets heard.

Oh well .. if you like BSC then you will like this .. if you are a fan of good live rock then you will like this ... but probably not something the average person off the street would get in to.",1449014400,,1051,3.768181818181818
8728813,5,B013TZBPGA,"As Kentuckys Black Stone Cherry put the finishing touches on their upcoming fifth studio album, the band has released their first ever live DVD / Blu-ray. Filmed at LG Arena in Birmingham, England on October 30th 2014, this is the epitome of modern American southern rock; look no further as you won't find anything better. From the opening moments of Rain Wizard to the final seconds of Lonely Train, BSC is one continual eruption. The amount of energy on display is unreal; guitarist Ben Wells leg-kicks, sprints, and spins his away across the stage while rocking the Les Paul as only he can do. John Fred Young hits his drums so hard, you actually wonder if the kit will survive the incredibly enjoyable 20-song set.

Audiences sing along at every concert, thats nothing new. But the 8,000 in attendance at this particular gig sound as though they're 80,000 strong. So much so that vocalist/guitarist Chris Robertson lets the crowd sing the very emotional Things My Father Said in its entirety; how often does that happen? Not very! The bands display of gratitude towards their fans is undeniable, with everyone in attendance experiencing a night that will never be forgotten. Me And Mary Jane brings a smile to your face, Hollywood In Kentucky is a hoot, and Peace Is Free sends chills down your spine. Bottom line, every song evokes an emotional response. Bonus footage was filmed at Download 2015 this past June. Viewers are treated to a pair of great songs, Blame It On The Boom Boom and In My Blood from the prestigious, yet rain-soaked festival. Chris and Ben also sit down for an insightful and interesting interview.",1448409600,,1627,4.831541218637993
