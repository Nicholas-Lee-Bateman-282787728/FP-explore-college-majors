8118707,4,B000F7MKM4,"This production of Agrippina is brilliant though it must be discussed on some details, which are no details actually, as we are going to see.

The music is definitely at its best. It is Handel in its flexibility, mobility, vivacity and diversity. Each instrument has its own soul and the souls can join, they don't get drowned in some mushy soup of homogenizing unity. What's more the conductor is very careful to make the instruments play with the voices in such a creative way that at times we have real duets and even echoing duets from one voice to one instrument. That game is even brought to the absolute acme when Narciso in his last aria goes down into the pit, sits at the harpsichord and accompany himself on it. That's brilliant, especially since the alto voice of the singer is a perfect echo of the pinched slightly bitter notes of the harpsichord.

If the music captured the perfection of Handel's baroque spirit and mind, the acting is also very good. The singers are never abandoned to their own singing. They are always doing something and that something has a meaning. Lesbo is the one who moves the furniture around in a set that is a big scaffolding construction in front of what could be the entrance of a palace. The scaffolding has several levels and at each level there are platforms with beds or sofas. This set is a very good idea since that gives verticality to an opera that otherwise might have been too flat, too horizontal. That also gives the possibility to have some actors at all levels and the lights then designate the one who is concerned by the scene, and the others can move in the shade of the rest of the stage

As for action, dressing and undressing is quite common all along, with Nerone at the beginning and then Claudio several times with Poppea, and Ottone with Poppea in this turn in an explicit scene that will just get rid of the direct benediction by Claudio at the end. They also have some kind of banquet when Claudio accuses Ottone of treachery and the banquet starts with a toast from Claudio to turn sour right afterwards with the accusation and the rejection of Ottone by everyone. The final scene, when Claudio finally yields to Agrippina after teasing her a last time with Ottone on the throne, he is playing dice or some game with Pallante and Narciso and sharing the money of the innings.

But though they have given Narciso's part back to a male alto, they did not go as far as going back to the original score. Nerone as a tenor appears as an older young man who is infatuated with his mother to the point of some incestuous attachment if not relation amounting to intercourse. He sounds and looks like a pervert and not what he is supposed to be a voracious, covetous, gluttonous, rapacious teenager just after puberty. Then the going back to his mummy to complain about Poppea who pushed him away is absurd and Agrippina's thrashing and chastising is impossible since the man is a man and not a child. At this moment he deserves a good spanking but he does not have the age and the voice any longer that would justify it. Then his conversion to power and his rejection of Poppea and love is artificial and superficial. That conversion should make him vicious for future times and it does not because of that voice and age.

In the same way Ottone should be a male alto, in Handel's tradition, because he is the military hero, but also in Handel's artistic vision, because he is also a younger man who is awkward and shy with women and who is timid with the emperor. Then his suffering after being rejected as a traitor makes him with his baritone voice and his young physique look like some kind of romantic Werther whereas he should look like a baroque hero suffering and enjoying his suffering, lamenting and enjoying even relishing in his lamenting. From baroque exquisite suffering to romantic wailing and whining, there is some kind of a treacherous deviation. And the last scene of undressing and love with Poppea then looks artificial. In many ways Ottone is one of these young courtiers who are trying to capture the beautiful young lady over there and who has to suffer to deserve her, though at times that young courtier might yield to the flattery of the king or duke or whoever who suggests power for him, in exchange of the beautiful eyes of the girl he has seduced. That is definitely baroque and not romantic.

But then the show itself is so beautiful that we let that treacherous twist go and enjoy the rest, including the romantic rewriting and its contradictions.

On the other hand the DVD is of course filmed. It remains an opera and the mental reflective distance necessary for proper reception is always present and we will regret a lot the fact that there are no Italian subtitles, which forces us either to follow on a printed libretto or to know or guess the text. This is awkward and definitely a shortcoming, and a very long shortcoming.

The shooting is quite volatile and flexible and that is good. The images are not inert and immobile, far from it. The angles are varied and the cameras are multiple. Fine. There are many close-ups and even very close close-ups and that is good to capture the expression of the faces and the feelings of the characters. Details are essential, though in the real theatre they evade you except if you have binoculars. Full stage pictures are quite systematically used to give a large picture of what is happening, especially since the stage is used vertically as well as horizontally and there are some extensions in or over the pit. In the famous scene between Poppea and Claudio with Ottone and Nerone hidden away, this production puts Ottone under the bed, which is very Hollywoodian, and Nerone in the pit, which is very expressive of the nuisance he is being to Poppea at this moment: in the pit with snakes of course.

The camera at the end gives a frontal image of Agrippina up at the top of the scaffolding and Nerone down on the stage sitting on the throne. This is symbolical and it needs to be given as a full picture and then the image moves from the top to the bottom and back to the top and then the full picture. This means a lot about the relation between Agrippina and Nerone. Unluckily it cannot reinforce the fact that when Nerone was thrashed by his mother he should have become a vicious angry young man who was probably already concocting in his mind the assassination of this domineering mother, since the scene leads us to contemplating a perverse rather young man who is infatuated with his mother to some kid of incestuous attachment. In the ending of this production he appears too much infatuated with his mother and drowning in his enjoyment of the throne. He is a satiated young man not the vicious per vers mind we know he is going to become, and one can only become what one is already potentially.

The last thing I would like to say is that this production uses cutting shifts from one angle to another, from one camera to another and from one distance to another too much. This production does not use zooming in and out enough and when it uses a zooming in movement it is maybe too slow, and there is no zooming out afterwards. What's more travelling does not seem to be an action the camera or cameras know how to do on this stage. And that's somewhat displeasing at times. The constant jumping from one short sequence from a particular angle, distance or camera to another short sequence from a different angle, distance and camera, and by short I mean at times very, very short, is not the best for an opera like this one. It is a typical TV or cinema technique, but here we are filming an opera for a DVD. The reception is neither that of a film in a movie theatre nor that of a TV show or series on a small screen in a drawing room. That use of cameras, angles and distances gives dynamism to the image and the film, but it slices the opera up too much. An opera needs some continuity in the filming of a scene or an aria, at least some stability of vision, and zooming in and out and traveling is a lot better provided it is neither too fast nor too slow.

A very good production that might have been difficult to watch in the opera house itself but it is rendered very well on the DVD in spite of some artistic choices at the level of voices and filming that maybe are drawbacks.

8118709,5,B000F7MKM4,For the appreciation of art two attitudes are essential: an open mind and a personal judgement. When I saw this DVD for the first time I was flabbergasted. Playing young Handel like this is wonderful. I don't bother whether countertenors are replaces by tenors. All the singers do en excellent job. And the conductor Jan Willem de Vriend eaquals William Christie and Marc Minkowski. At the end of the opera I felt happy and full of joy. That of course is the power of Handel and the enthusiasm of the Vriend and his chamber orchestra. The staging was modern and adequate. It was a good idea of de Vriend to place the orchestra and the stage on the same level in order to enhance the dialogue between individual members of the orchestra and the singers. This opera interpretation is outstanding. Highly recommended.,1240704000,3,814,4.73943661971831
8118710,1,B000F7MKM4,"I cancelled my advance order for this DVD after reading the review in the October 2006 Gramophone, which accuses this staging of ""performance malpractice,"" citing the reordering of arias, the insertion of incongruous numbers from other operas, the transposition of roles, and a ""laboured conceptual production.""  All in all, it doesn't sound like a good way to spend $25.

I didn't notice that this DVD is in the PAL format until reading the first review here. My DVD player plays all regions and formats, so I didn't have any trouble viewing it on my TV. Amazon is usually pretty good about this, but I know the same thing happened with the Barenboim SIEGFRIED when it first became available here. At that time I did not have a region-free DVD player, and so I had to send it back and they replaced it with the correct format for the US market. I'm sure they will do the same with this AGRIPPINA if it won't play on your TV.",1159056000,5,713,4.288888888888889
8118712,3,B000F7MKM4,"Agrippina; Exceptional Playing, Inconsistent Video Quality
by Brian J. Hay

What saves this set is the quality of the performance.

Annemarie Kremer is wonderfully convincing in the title role. Her 'Agrippina' is lustful, manipulative and conniving and irresistibly sensual. Renate Arends is a delightful (and delectable) 'Poppea'. Quirjin De Lang projects a wide spectrum of emotion in the role of 'Ottone'. Michael Hart-Davis is in fine comic form as 'Nerone'. Piotr Miciski is a hilarious 'Claudius'. Jan Alofs voice resounds with an authoritarian ring in the role of 'Lesbo'. The passion in Clint van der Linde's soars above the stage as he sings the part of the smitten 'Narcissus'. Robbert Muuse makes a wonderful 'Drama King' of 'Pallante'. There's no one voice in this ensemble that stands head and shoulders above the rest. All of the vocalists are uniformly strong, both as singers and actors. That's rare in ensemble productions.

The photography and cinematography are excellent. Director Rob van den Berg had a clear sense of how the piece should be shot so as to insure strong flow of the narrative set by Stage Director Eva Buchmann. The camerawork, by Ruud Dirske, Frits Schrijvers and Rob Ijsbrandy, makes excellent use of both the lines created by the sets and the movements of the characters themselves. The lighting by Kees van de Lagemaat is great. The foregrounds shine with the radiance associated with the old Technicolor process. The backdrops are subdued but clear. The effect is consistent throughout the production and it creates a wonderful atmosphere.

And then there's the work of the Combattimento Consort of Amsterdam. Their musical performance is stunning. This group literally puts the ""I"" in the word inspired. Every note this group plays is filled with passion. Every musical phrase is spiced with drama. Their musical punctuation is clear and sharp. Their performances of the ballads flows like the gentlest river. They don't simply play the piece. For this performance they become the piece. Jan Willem de Vriend has a fantastic group of musicians on his hands. All that we in North America can ask is 'where have they been all these years'.

From there on things are inconsistent at best and a mess at worst. On the unit I have the video skips intermittently. The jumps' aren't big ones and they don't throw the sound out of synchronization with the images but they are noticeable. Backtracking over a hiccup and replaying the segment eliminates the jump (until the next one appears) so the problem is probably with the format of the disc itself. The player I have is pre-set for NTSC but it reads PAL. The fact that the DVD is formatted for Region 2 (PAL) wasn't included in the pre-release information supplied by Amazon. It probably wasn't their fault. They can only work with what they have and they'd have had no reason to question what they were given. Still, that issue should have been corrected at the source, preferably before the DVD was released.

The subtitles are lousy. And that's not an issue related to the disc format. It's just slipshod workmanship. It's true that the video was created for widescreen TV's but that doesn't explain this goof-up. The point size of the text is so small that the text is hard to read even when the image is zoomed to the third power. By then half of most of the characters' heads are cropped off! It's ridiculous. What Jurjen Stekelenberg was thinking when he did this can only be guessed at.

The 'extras' on the disc are interesting but flawed as well. The documentary about the way the work was produced is fascinating. The interviews were enlightening even if they had to be read in the form of subtitles. There's detailed information about all of the performers. But the aspect ratio on some of the footage used in the mini-bios is off. Did they think this wouldn't be noticed or did the budget just run low? Sheesh!

This disc is sort of like an Albatross with a gilded plume. When it was first released in North America many (DVD) players couldn't play it because it was formatted for Europe. Now that many players adapt to different regions the problems with the technical side stand out like a beacon. It's a good production of a strong work but there are issues that make it a test of patience. But, the musical performance is fabulous. It would get a five star rating on its own. The problems with the video and the format of the DVD cost it the other two.

That said, the musical performance makes the rest worthwhile.",1158624000,6,4520,4.821935483870968
