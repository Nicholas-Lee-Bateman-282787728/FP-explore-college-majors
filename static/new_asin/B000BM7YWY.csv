2423741,5,B000BM7YWY,"This is one DVD that you will definitely want to add to your resource library. Ronnie Earl is an excellent guitarist and instructor, and he covers a wide range of very interesting and easy to learn styles. Ronnie Earl is one of the most versatile guitarists on the scene, and it comes across in the material. Regardless to your skill level, you will benefit from the DVD. Whether you're interested in country style, electric blues, swing, or in continuing to build an awesome chord repertoire, this is one that you will definitely want.",1209513600,4,536,4.774193548387097
2423742,5,B000BM7YWY,"Having seen Ronnie play twice in the past year, I was delighted to discover this DVD. It was perfect for me , a blues loving intermediate guitarist. Although he plays a Strat on the DVD, most of it works quite well for acoustic guitar as well. The emphasis is on chord progressions, and some of the voicings he uses. There isn't much time devoted to soloing, and the licks that he plays don't make it into the helpful tab book. I've had this for about 6 weeks now, and feel like my playing has gone up about 2 levels, and at about half the cost of a lesson, it was money well spent",1199577600,6,581,4.150442477876106
2423743,5,B000BM7YWY,Ronnie knows the blues and knows how to teach it.  He breaks it down into manageable building blocks.  Ronnie doesn't need a band - just his foot and a guitar.  He seamlessly switches from playing rhythm to fills and back while keeping the groove.  This is one of the gems in the Hot Licks series.,1171670400,8,297,4.345454545454546
2423744,5,B000BM7YWY,"This is an interesting DVD featuring bluesman Ronnie Earl as the instructor.  There are multiple simultaneous views of Earl while he demonstrates what he is doing (including a shot of his intense facial expressions).  The first part of the tape focuses on substitute chord voicings that Earl uses to make the changes interesting (6 chords, 9 chords, 13 chords, etc).  The second part of the tape covers his style of soloing.  The main point that Earl makes (and it is the way he learned to solo) is not to worry about copying solos note for note, but to get the feel of the solo.  He advises playing along with such greats as Magic Sam and Otis Rush.  As another reviewer wrote, Earl uses a minimum of notes to achieve a maximum of expression and urges the student to do the same.

This is not a beginner's video.  If you have developed the feel for blues changes (eg, 12 bar blues), know your pentatonic scales, and want to add finesse to your blues, Earl is definitely an excellent player deserving your attention.",1150416000,36,1016,4.574585635359116
2423745,5,B000BM7YWY,"I've purchased several titles from the ""Hot Licks"" series and think they are all good, but this Ronnie Earl DVD is a wonder. I have spent so much time with this DVD and it has added greatly to my playing. I'm probably not a typical player: self-taught from age of 13 -20, then strumming every six months or so for about the next 40 years. Started seriously studying with a good teacher two years ago and while I've made great progress with my teacher, I sometimes get discouraged. This DVD gave me such a boost: It added nuance to my improvisation and contributed a great deal of color to my chord vocabulary. I've already spent hours with it and there's enough meat here to keep me going with it for weeks to come. Ronnie Earl is an amazing guitarist and his instruction style is genuine and earnest. I highly recommend this title.",1149379200,13,832,4.480263157894737
2423746,5,B000BM7YWY,Ronnie Earl Is One Hell Of A Guitar Player. The Most Important Thing About His Lessons Is That He Lays It Out In Such A Way That You Will Really Get It. I Truely Believe That This Dvd Will Inspire You To Reach Within Yourself And Play Better Better Than You Ever Had. This Will Be One Of The Most Important DVD'S You Have Ever Picked Up!,1145059200,8,337,4.044776119402985
2423747,4,B000BM7YWY,"Ronnie Earl is a man who wears his heart on his sleeve and that approach bodes well for this masterful and appropriately titled ""Blues Guitar with Soul"" instructional DVD.  The disc has proved an excellent primer for this intermediate beginner looking to find my own elusive voice amid limited Blues chops.  Earl is simple and clear, achieving his goal of offering the student an expanded Blues chord vocabulary along with an emphasis on inner passion soloing.  Complimenting Earl's expertise, this newly released DVD converted from a 1995 VHS is technically excellent, using three camera angles to completely depict the teacher's succinct ideas.  The DVD is very student friendly.  It's easy to push a couple of buttons on your remote and loop a segment until you internalize Earl's groove.

Earl seems very jazzed about teaching, but bounces around a bit, giving the impression of being pressured to get as much information out as possible within a finite amount of time, and being unsure of the chronology in which to spit it all out.  This seems to be a common caveat with instructional guitar DVDs.  I deducted one star, but I love the DVD.

My favorite idea was likely Earl's simplest:  Play your lead with only three notes.  (""Oops, I played four."")  Earl is a man with a big heart and soul, and if something like that can be taught, Earl is clearly the Bluesman to do it.  This DVD has greatly helped me to further elicit the Blues guitar voice that is in my own soul.  It feels wonderful.  Thanks, Ronnie.",1144713600,29,1514,4.769230769230769
2423748,5,B000BM7YWY,"I haven't heard much of this mans music although after seeing his instructional video I believe I will start checking him out.

Before I saw this video I believed that I understood the blues to point where my approach to playing blues became boring, this video changed my perception. The lessons are just what a person could use to play blues in the more traditional style.

Ronnie plays in the traditional ""call and response"" style showing when to chord and when to play single line stuff and you will get a great lesson in chording. Ronnie teaches mostly about those sweet sounding cords and comps that the masters --Muddy, the Three Kings, the Ice man, Freddy, Green, Earl, Robert Johnson, Buddy, and Gatemouth--used to bring this important American style into the forefront.

Don't expect to learn the Clapton or Stevie Ray Vaugh stuff although he does cover some of Jimmy. This is a lesson from a man who learned from the early masters and did not try to imitate as much as to synthesize his own style.

The way I look at it, you would pay me 25 bucks for a lesson and for a little more you can have this DVD. It is really good",1137715200,31,1132,4.480582524271845
2423749,4,B000BM7YWY,Not a great deal of content is provided but what's here is good stuff.  There's a good look at essential blues chords and how he uses them in the context of a12-bar progression.,1411862400,2,177,4.363636363636363
2423750,5,B000BM7YWY,"I think this is the best blues guitar tutorial DVD I have bought so far and I got quite a few  , Ronnie is a gentleman with a guitar ,
he sure knows how to play every note and how to get amazing blues sounds , he really feels it ,

I won't ever be tired of watching this video again and again , I strongly recommend it to serious blues guitar players",1379116800,,350,3.780821917808219
2423751,5,B000BM7YWY,Great help from Ronnie with improving my blues chops. He is passing on some nice root based  licks and ideas. I have incorporated some of what he is passing on in songs I have played for years. Great fun Great help.,1372550400,2,215,4.2439024390243905
2423752,5,B000BM7YWY,"Good over view of his style. Video  with several different views was very good. Very approachable instruction on his influences, ideas and techniques.",1370563200,2,150,5.521739130434782
2423753,4,B000BM7YWY,"I don't know much about Ronnie Earl, but this video is awesome.  I could spend a year working on the things he teaches in this video.  He explains everything well, shows you exactly how to do it, and breaks it up into logical parts.  Great video.",1363910400,,246,4.304347826086956
2423754,1,B000BM7YWY,I DID NOT REALIZE THIS WAS AN INSTRUCTIONAL DVD TO LEARN HOW TO PLAY THE GUITAR. I LIKE RONNIE EARL BUT I WANTED A MUSICAL DVD.,1362528000,,127,3.923076923076923
2423755,3,B000BM7YWY,"This is a somewhat disappointing DVD, Its not that his guitar playing is off , its good but its just not what I expected and what he is most known for - brilliant electric guitar work with a masterful mix of blues, swing and a touch of jazz. I didn't expect him to be playing so much in the style of Robert Johnson and other delta blues musicians. Actually. If you want to hear or learn that style you should find lessons from the guy who did the introduction, Woody Mann, he's the best.",1333497600,2,487,4.191489361702128
2423756,4,B000BM7YWY,"Just got this DVD and have only started, but I do recommend it for intermediate to advanced blues guitar players.  Theres a lot of great stuff a beginner could pick up, but it would be difficult - there are better places to start learning how to play blues guitar.  I've been playing guitar recreationally for over 40 years, so it's basically just a hobby for me.  I'm only 5 minutes or so into the video so far and there's quite a bit I've learned already.  Ronnie Earl adds a jazzy touch to the blues, so it's more than just string bends - lots of stuff on Jazz/Blues type chords that sound nice / different and give your fingers a good stretch sometimes.  Basically, I put on the video - you can view the TAB notes in an included printed version (very small print) - or it's on the screen - just hit pause to work through the TAB and find the notes.  Step 2 is to plug into my Fender G-DEC3 ""Blues"" amp and put on a slow 12 bar blues repeating backing track and try to play along using what I've just learned off the DVD.  For me it's a great way to learn and then immediately get to practice what I've learned.  Once I'm comfortable with what I've learned, I put the DVD on and repeat the process.  I plan to make it all the way through this DVD (in time) and hope to be able to incorporate most of Ronnie's teachings into my blues playing - an aggressive long term plan, but I'm having fun with it now, so there ya go......",1302220800,5,1428,4.163636363636364
2423757,5,B000BM7YWY,"This Hot Licks dvd is just great.  There is a slow motion lesson feature that adds a lot to the lesson.  The split screen is great and production value is............ great.
Ronnie Earl is unique.  He is a very humble man and down to earth.  His advice is direct and has a great teaching style.  There is a soloing exercise that he says to get the most out of 3 notes, he just ripped it up and always concentrating on playing with ""feeling and soul.""  Another bit of advice was to increase your chord vocabulary to make your playing more interesting.  His inside tips of playing 6th's, 9th's, 13's, and richer voicings is musical gold.  Yet, there isn't any snobbery going on, it is an experienced master guitarist, with a humble attitude, sharing what blues is to him.  He references many, many guitarists through the dvd and teaches their styles and how to make your own style.
This is the best guitar dvd I have seen, and I have seen quite a few.  It's pretty simple, well presented, and not super technical like most of the music school videos.  Anyone interested in learning anyone's style of blues should get this dvd.  There is so much in shuffle, 12 bar, turnarounds, phrasing, right hand technique, and single note pentatonics that it would become foundational information for the student.
Man, I'm excited that I have this dvd!!  Every exercise is available at half speed with pitch correction.  I've been a player for many years and I only get better by ""cutting"" up tunes and learning a piece at a time.  This is going to be a great tool in my development, I wish I bought it earlier.",1237248000,7,1596,4.5508771929824565
2423758,5,B000BM7YWY,"This DVD is a terrific learning tool for the intermediate level guitar players. Definitely not for beginners. His style is soulful minimalist approach, and creating the variety of sounds is the key rather than blazing through a lot of notes. If you like that rootsy blues sound, and want to learn how to play in that style -- get this DVD. If you like Robben Ford / Eric Clapton (excluding From the Cradle / Mr. Johnson) styles (at least their well known songs), this is not the right direction.",1223078400,6,495,4.573033707865169
8088821,5,B000BM7YWY,"I cannot say enough about Ronnie, the moves are brilliant.
Worth the money well worth it.",1502064000,,89,4.625
8088822,5,B000BM7YWY,"Not much more to say that the other favorable reviews haven't already. This guy is such a tasteful player, and the title says it all. Not just a series of lead licks, but a lot of chordal stuff mixed in, as well as a big dose of ""the inner game of blues guitar"". Some great ""jazz"" chords are employed, giving his message a more sophisticated and nuanced sound. Presented in a bit of a frantic way, as opposed to a lesson 1, lesson 2 approach. It's as though the producer just sat him down and said ""just tell us a little about what you do Ronnie"". I found this to be a refreshing approach, compared to most of the instructional DVD's out there. This video has a slow motion mode that maintains the original pitch, which enables you to better see what he's doing (which he doesn't always explain in detail). Between this and the included tab and chord charts, I've been able to interpret most of what's on the video. NOT for beginner blues man wannabes. You need to bring a little to the dance. Don't let the Lightnin' Hopkins style  stuff early in the video scare you off. There's plenty of straight ahead contemporary electric blues playing to follow. Because detailed explanations are not always offered up, this is a very dense with info DVD. Plenty here to keep you moving forward for months, but you'll have to dig for it. Highly recommended.",1484524800,,1347,4.497959183673469

8088829,5,B000BM7YWY,"this is an incredibly good and heartfelt effort by a younger Ronnie Earl!  I would say, designed for intermediate to advanced players, he earnestly helps us get inside his playing and thinking about chords, melodies, and overall feel for playing.  If you want to quickly get some tools to make your playing more smooth, bluesy, and soulful while drawing on some of techniques of the legends of blues playing get this dvd and soak it in.  Youll be pleasantly surprised by how quickly you can absorb the awesome tools Ronnie puts out there.  And, if you get a chance to see this legend in person DO IT!
