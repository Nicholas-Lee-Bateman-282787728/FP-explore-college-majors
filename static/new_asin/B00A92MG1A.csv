5401239,5,B00A92MG1A,"Thank you for this touch of good wholesome fun. We need more family value shows. The price is high, but worth it. Picture quality if good, sound also. Story lines are nice and fun with a lesson learned in most shows. I only wish someone would realease the rest of Family.",1356393600,2,271,4.333333333333333
5401240,5,B00A92MG1A,"Okay, if you come from the Eight is Enough generation(Wednesday nights before Charlie's Angels)like I did, then you had a favorite Bradford kid. Mine was Elizabeth, the youngest daughter. The episodes I most remember would have been from the last half of of Season 2, which is this collection, and the first half of Season 3. I think EIE made it's mark with Season 3, so definitely hoping for that release to follow. We need to be reminded that traditional values are a necessary way of life, as most television shows these days lack.",1355961600,7,534,4.691489361702128
5401261,3,B00A92MG1A,"Love this show and am looking forward to the release of season 3.
Downside of season 2 is being split into part 1 and 2.  Also the sound on many episodes was not lined up with the picture.  The cases were in miserable shape.  The seams were cracked and coming apart and all the teeth were broken so the DVD's were flopping around and falling out.  Pretty horrible for the price we paid.",1368489600,3,386,4.2465753424657535
5401262,5,B00A92MG1A,"good show, it is great to reflect how innocent some of these characters were and now to here their struggles..",1367280000,,110,4.55
5401263,5,B00A92MG1A,"I really love this Television Show from ABC which Aired @ 2000 Hour's { 8:00 P.M. } every Wednesday I think it was.  I have the Entire First { 1st } and Second { 2nd } Seasons of this Show.  I Can't wait untill the COmpany that has come out with this Television Show comes Out with the Remaining Three { 3 } Season's.
  As for myself, I have found this Televison Show to be Very Educational in one's Moral's, Respect, Understandiing of other's, the NEED of HELP and Everyone jumps in to HELP Out, Togetherness, Consideration of Other's, how and when to be Consoling of other's, making Sacrafices's for other's. and being Supportive of other's when someone is in NEED of Support.
  These are just a few of the Important things that we the Public can Learn, from this Show Eight is Enough.  I hope that they come out with the Finail Three { 3 } Season's of this Show Eight is Enough Soon, { the Company or Companies that have already come out with the first Two { 2 } Seasons of this Show }.",1361059200,,989,4.25668449197861
5401264,5,B00A92MG1A,perfect!!! i'm waiting patiencently for all the seasons to become avaliable so i can buy them- one of my favorite shows in the 70's. 80's,1360713600,,137,4.52
5401265,3,B00A92MG1A,The episodes my wife enjoys watching frozed. Afraid to reorder part 2 for fear it will happen again which sucks.,1358553600,,112,4.65
5401266,3,B00A92MG1A,"Purchased so that young daughter could enjoy show that we enjoyed in younger days. Only negative is that this season was broken up into two DVD's and is the reason for my 3-star rating. Kind of pricey, but wasn't a deal breaker. Hope future releases correct this issue!",1357171200,2,269,4.625
5401267,4,B00A92MG1A,"I am pleased to see 'Eight is Enough', season number two, now made available to the public... I look forward to the additional seasons as well..",1357084800,,144,4.576923076923077

5401269,5,B00A92MG1A,Very Glad they finally released this show on dvd since it was over due just because several people were waiting for it & I was one of them,1356739200,,138,3.9642857142857144
8548573,5,B00A92MG1A,"I have all the DVDs now of Eight is Enough.  It was my favorite show growing up.  I liked that Eight is Enough was a heartfelt show but not too sappy.  I could laugh and cry in the same episode.  I enjoyed Season 2 the most as the family dealt with Joan's death and the addition of Abby at the same time.  I liked that Abby was the ""stepmother"" and didn't magically become the ""mother"" overnight. Betty Buckley was a great addition to the cast and brought a unique element to the family drama.  The show holds up well in my opinion.",1453766400,,532,4.166666666666667

8548577,5,B00A92MG1A,They don't make shows like this anymore in this age of reality TV.  Good acting and a series that portrayed the characters meeting life's problems with the help of a loving family.  This series demonstrated that integrity and holding true to one's individual values were worthy traits.,1421625600,,285,5.042553191489362

8548581,1,B00A92MG1A,Another great show getting the crap DVD-R treatment from the idiots at Warner Archives. Don't bother. There is no guarantee these inferior transfers will play on your equipment. They even tell you this! Save your money and force this miserable studio to give us legitimate DVD releases for TV shows and movies!,1373760000,4,310,4.980769230769231
8548582,5,B00A92MG1A,I grew up watching this show. With so many characters on it you could always find someone to relate to. This was a really good show that was not afraid to tackle tough issues. They did not feel the need to make the family life shown to be totally unrealistic. Some shows had the kids acting like little adults and always understanding everything that was done for them was for the best and there was no whining or anything. This show shows a more realistic side. Looking forward to more releases of the remaining seasons of this show.,1369353600,,534,4.459183673469388
