This is the story of America's most shameful and elite club. Serial Killers. This series describes the who, what, when, where and how of these crazed criminals. This video is the same video as ""America's Serial Killers, Portraits in Evil"". They are identical video's DO NOT BUY BOTH.",1401235200,10,434,4.864864864864865
5166167,1,B008I1G6Y2,"After reading the reviews on your site I was lead to believe that this movie was going to turn out to be one of the most detailed and exciting movies that I couldn't wait to see!!  I even paid the same amount of shipping as the movie its self just because your site made it seem like everything I was looking for. When I received the movie I couldn't wait! I very carefully tried to open the case and instantly it had cracked. Thinking I was going to enjoy this movie and was lead to believe that there was no reason for me to ever want to return it. I sat down to watch it and was EXTREMLY miss lead on this movie I expected it to go into details on these physco  people. I couldn't even watch half of the first disk! it was so boring and never went into any detail on anything, instead I was very bored and could not even keep entertained. I am very upset I spent 30-35.00 on this movie that was nothing I even wanted to watch! I would love a refund on this movie and as well as have low expectations from amazon its self. This was my first and most likely my last time I will ever buy anything on amazon.com, unless they were ever even willing to take back this horrible movie that I over paid for. But I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't care about their customers anyways and aren't looking for people to want to continue buying items off of their site",1395100800,2,1360,4.128301886792453
5166168,4,B008I1G6Y2,"This was a very good series, very informative.  I would recommend this for anyone curious about serial killers.  A very good set for the money.",1386115200,3,143,4.68
5166169,5,B008I1G6Y2,This set is frank to the point and explains well about the cases involved. Not overly graphic however not for younger children.,1377302400,2,127,4.818181818181818
5166170,4,B008I1G6Y2,"The first ten parts of this twenty part collection is the America's Serial Killers dvd set that can be found on this site. The makers have added on an additional ten part series entitled Rampage: Killing without Reason. I already had the America's Serial Killers ten part series, so I was a little disappointed. The America's Serial Killers is a fine documentary set and can be bought fairly cheap on here. Whether to buy this dvd for the additional ten part series is a tough one.

I was happy with the series, but it did seem to use a lot of the same talking clips in numerous episodes and provide redundant information. The topics for the ten part series entitled Rampage were so similar in content, that a lot of the same information was given, but the area of study was covered well. Here are the titles of the 20 programs and it might provide you with some more information when deciding to buy or pass.

America's Serial Killers
Program 1: The monster within and mong us
Program 2: Killers without conscience
Program 3: The Bogeyman's gonna eat you
Program 4: Serial killing begins again
Program 5: Men who like to kill
Prgram 6: Homosexual serial killers
Program 7: Buddy serial killing
Program 8: The many faces of serial killers
Program 9: To catch a serial killer
Program 10: Why serial Killers kill

Rampage-Killing without reason
Part 1: Killing and killers
Part 2: Mass murders
Part 3: Spree murders
Part 4: Hate crimes
Part 5: Workplace killings
Part 6: School massacre
Part 7: Family slaughter
Part 8: Cult killings
Part 9: Bombers and arsonists
Part 10: Political killings
The workplace killings, school massacre and cult killings were all very well done. If you don't already have America's Serial Killers and you enjoy this type of subject matter, then I feel this is a fantastic collection. If you're like me and buying it having already owned the first ten part series, it might be less of a deal. Also, the additional ten part series is no where close to as good as the first ten part series in the collection, America's Serial Killers.",1354233600,25,2058,4.679558011049724
