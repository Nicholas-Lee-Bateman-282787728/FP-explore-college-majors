4047935,5,B0030ZOYG8,"Now up to 648 episodes, 15 movies, 10 regular OVAs, 6 Kaito Kid OVAs, and a Crossover movie: Lupin III vs Conan special. It was not well received here in the US, but gained some ground after the 5th box set, even reaching the top 10 list in Funimation dvds sold on Amazon.

It's still widely popular in Japan and is the 11th running anime series, the top ten with the most episodes (in and out of production) are:

1. Sazae-san at 6429+ episodes.
2. Doraemon - 1787
3. Nintama Rantaro - 1483
4. Hoka Hoka Kazoku - 1428
5. Prince Mackaroo - 1170
6. Soreike! Anpanman - 1100
7. Crayon Shin-chan - 815
8. Chibi Maruko-Chan - 793
9. Shima Shima Tora no Shimajiro - 726
10. Ninja Hattori-kun - 694

All except for Crayon Shin-chan have been Japan-only anime, but for good reason that most are only 5-10 minutes long, and intended mainly for kids. Often, Detective Conan would get great reviews from critics who loved the plots and cases.

Currently, there are no plans for more Funimation dubs, and I assume that was because of western taste when it came to anime. Most anime that are popular now are action, such as Bleach, Naruto, and One Piece. Rarely are mysteries or romance anime titles in popular demand here in the states, and I would not think Funimation is in any hurry to find the original dub cast, plus it would be a risk to just all of a sudden bring it back to American audience. Season five just stops short of before you actually meet Vi Graythorn aka Sherry (Shiho in the series), only 5 episodes away, and I won't spoil anything further, you will just have to watch the shows yourself! Funimation should have made a sixth box set to bridge at least some of the gap between the movies and the series, as you get a bit of a shock when you see this girl, Vi, and have not even met her within the series yet. For now, to see where this series has been and where it is going, either watch the full Japanese series, or find good subs.",1331769600,,1942,4.3123287671232875
4047936,4,B0030ZOYG8,"Case Closed, or Detective Conan as it's known in Japan, has long been a Japanese institution, with the anime just reaching its 15th anniversary. Unfortunately, the anime hasn't been as well received in the US, due to a variety of reasons but mostly because modern anime fans refuse to buy anything that's not brand new. (The manga has done much better.) As a result, the anime only got its first 5 seasons and the first 6 movies brought to the US and dubbed. 130 episodes and 6 movies is certainly nothing to sneeze at, however, and this will provide ample amounts of entertainment.
The dub still uses Americanized names (an artifact of its release in the 90's when apparently people were too dumb to figure out that Japanese people have Japanese names) but the subtitles have the original Japanese names restored as a bonus for purists. In general, I found that season 5 was pretty good but not the best season this show has to offer. Unfortunately, the episodes when it really gets good will not be coming to the US on DVD, but that's the way the cookie crumbles I guess.
Curiously, the last episode of the Japanese season 5 has been omitted, where a major new character gets introduced. This is probably the result of one of two things. Either FUNimation, while dubbing the episodes, counted hour-long episodes as 2 separate episodes so the episode count came to 25 without including that episode or they didn't want to introduce a new character and pay for a new voice actor and then stop the dubbing process. If they had continued it would have simply been tacked onto season 6 and they would have had no problem. (Ironically, they ended up getting a new actor for the character because she appeared in the movies that got licensed later.) I'm pretty sure it's the former rather than the latter, but no doubt both were influential in the decision.
All in all, I really enjoy this show and I would recommend getting it in a heartbeat. Slightly disappointed that we won't ever be able to complete the collection, though.",1331683200,2,2023,4.669467787114846

4047938,5,B0030ZOYG8,"Very happy with this season, it also completes the entire seasons 1-5 as released by Funimation, sad to see this be the final season released with English audio though. Great product overall, very happy with it and would suggest buying it to others.",1319760000,,249,4.813953488372093
4047939,5,B0030ZOYG8,"Great TV series!!!!!  This show is so awesome and has great characters!  Got it on time.  Only sad thing is that there is a good dozen more seasons, but only in Japan.  This also is missing 5 to six more episodes, but not sure why and can't find them.  All in all though, I love it and really can't wait for the next seasons!
Thanks!",1304640000,,333,4.061538461538461
4047940,5,B0030ZOYG8,"It's really sad that this may be the last dubbed episodes of Case Closed. I first began watching this show when I was around ten years old, and I instantly fell in love with it. It had been a long time since I had last watched Case Closed, but I recently got out some old DVDs of it and watched it with my little sister, thus reawakening my love for it.

  This is the first season I've ever purchased (I've bought DVDs with a few episodes on it, but never a whole season) and I was very pleased. I loved the case and how the DVDs were cleverly placed inside, and I especially enjoyed all the episodes. You meet knew people, see the old characters, and get to enjoy more amazing mysteries. I also enjoyed the few episodes that had ghouls and mysterious houses in them, and the appearance of Harley's ""girlfriend"" was a nice treat as well.

  I found the mysteries in this season amazing as well. I really liked how they kicked off the season with the episode of Jimmy's first love and the (what I thought) very clever mystery of a celebrity murder. My favorite episode was the one with the sisters though. It was so sad and had me even tearing up (haha). And the episode where Harley's having dreams about Jimmy getting stabbed was very interesting too. I enjoyed every second of the season though. Me and my sister devoured all  25 episodes within two days. I just hope that Funimation will dub more of this amazing show.

4047941,5,B0030ZOYG8,I loved Case Closed so much. I try to collect this show for my collections. please make more of this film. One of the best detective anime.,1279324800,3,139,4.185185185185185
4047942,5,B0030ZOYG8,"This was a great conclusion to a series available in the US currently.  I am trying to collect this complete series (including movies), but so few are currently available in this country.  The teen-aged detective, turned young child has really got interesting.  new rivals, which make even this boy genius  have to think hard about what happened.  including one which is a Master of disguise which I really want to see how gets brought to justice.  Come on, release the next few seasons for us fans in the states",1276214400,13,512,4.696629213483146

4047944,5,B0030ZOYG8,"Another wonderful 5th season of mystery cases and a young 10 year old boy solving each mystery! Sadly this is where the Cons really gets up over the Pros :(

Plot and Characters: (minor spoilers only) if you have NOT seen season 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or read my review on Season 1, 2, 3, and 4 its not problem! here is a quick recap. Jimmy Kudo aka Conan Edogawa is a brillian detective who can solve any case! One day Kudo gets poisioned and now is a little boy again solving cases with his girlfriend who dosnt know he got turned into a boy and her father who is a detective but not a very good one.

Pros: great writing again! each case is different, its one hell of an amazing series!! Coana is the best detective ever!!

Cons: It is a great series but this is where it ends. Sadly NO ending will be found here, at episode 130 ""The Weather Girl Kidnapping Case"" Funimation just stopped. For capping the end of the season yes but even more saddly Funimation just stopped DUBBING and producing the whole series to be shown on tv :'( . From the research on the web its said that Funimation had this on tv (cartoon network) at 5am to 6am (2 episodes) and they cancelled the show because of LOW RATINGS. Well what do you expect putting one of the best detective anime's on at 5am in the morning (excluding weekends) when barely (adlest that I know about) anyone is up and still mostly sleeping. I wish they would get the rights to start showing it again but it has been 9 years since it was first shown in English dub and I highly doubt they are bringing it back.

(Mini ending spoiler)

Over all: I love this series alot!! if you have been following the over all plot of Jimmy/Conan trying to find the people who posioned him well then it all ends here for the Funimation telling. Buy this series but don't expect anything else unless you want and or like to watch it in japanese dubbing from the internet",1430611200,2,1900,4.237569060773481

4047954,5,B0030ZOYG8,"I've enjoyed ""Case Closed"" aka ""Detective Conan"" since I first found out about it. It is such a fun bit of Anime. A clever plot device for the set up, and then some fascinating stories. Not all of them revolve around solving a murder. No, Conan and his friends partake of all the usual events of childhood, even as he struggles to deal with his girlfriend both as a child under her care and as a teen (albeit only as a voice on the phone). The character development and relationships are what set this series apart from being JUST an animated TV series about a boy detective. Watch it from season one and you'll be hooked just like me!",1400025600,,635,4.34453781512605

4047961,4,B0030ZOYG8,The show is great but I rated this a 4 star because the box set for season 5 arrived with a piece of the inside of the case broken off so I didn't even know it was damaged before it was opened but the break doesn't affect the closing capibilities of the case nor did it damage the dvds in any way,1375228800,,296,3.7903225806451615
4047962,5,B0030ZOYG8,I have really enjoyed this series. Any one who enjoys murder mysteries and detective stories will enjoy this series. It looks like with this new S.A.V.E. edition they just copied the Viridian Collection and repackaged in the S.A.V.E. case which is by no means a bad thing because the original Viridian Collection was a good quality set. I really have enjoyed this series and have watched all 130 episodes in a month the only down side is I wish Funimation would acquire the 500+ other episodes of this series and dub them as well!,1374710400,8,530,4.648936170212766
