5342324,5,B009JE18UE,"It is about time! This also comes with the banned short ""One Beer"" found within the episode ""Elephant Issues"". If you bought volumes 1, 2 and this volume then you have 82 out of 98 episodes. They should only need one more volume to release the remaining 16 episodes. With having released How I Spent My Summer Vacation, all they need are two more specials (Tiny Toons' Spring Break and Tiny Toons' Night Ghoulery). I hope they release both specials with the remaining last volume set. It is definitely possible, but since companies want more money, they may break the two specials up into individual dvd movies and then volume 4. Also, ANIMANIACS are coming out too! Be sure to get the last volume, volume 4!

EDIT: Also to mention, I was disappointed with the menues. There was clearly no thought into the layout or background images or pictures on each tab for each episodes. It looks so generic, meaning when you are making a dvd and you are creating the menu, you know how the software gives you options? There are always a couple of options where it's just a plain background. Well this is the case. So sad. With Animaniacs the last volume, at least they gave more thought into it.",1358035200,8,1186,4.568075117370892
5342325,4,B009JE18UE,"Th-Th-Th-That's right, folks !  The next volume of ""Tiny Toon Adventures"" is here for all your cartoon cravings.  This 2-disc set has 17 classic episodes starring those comic dispensers that crack up all the censors freely based on the Looney Tunes and these episodes are a bit more on topic with the chosen theme wraparounds.  (At least compared to the previous volumes.)  Here are some examples:

""Pledge Week"" - Buster and Babs Bunny (""No relation."") host a ""Tiny Toons Telethon"" with very little results.
""Going Places"" - Our crazy cast takes a field trip to the fire station, the art museum, and Montana Max's Merry Meats Company.
""Elephant Issues"" - More like ""relevant tissues"" or something like that.  Gogo Dodo, the craziest bird in Wackyland, takes a more serious approach to discuss common problems like Dizzy Devil's illiteracy, a new robot student, and the controversial ""One Beer"" episode.
""Hog Wild Hamton"" - It's time to party, Hamton style !  Let's hope our porcine pal doesn't get into big trouble with his folks.
""Toon Physics"" - Your host, Orson Whales compares physics in the real world with silly moments shown in the three cartoons.
""Buster and Babs Go Hawaiian"" - Three young, aspiring writers put our pair of hares in a wacky Waikiki adventure that's anything but a vacation to them.
""Kon Ducki"" - Plucky Duck attempts to write, star, and direct an epic film.  And it's not as easy as it sounded.
""Sepulveda Boulevard"" - Montana Max tells a tale of scriptwriters in the Valley as he attempts to steal an idea for himself.
""Take Elmyra Please"" - Elmyra has been taken for ransom.  Sure it sounds like a good thing, but her antics will make the bad guys take her back.
""New Class Day"" - Acme Looniversity is giving some new, albeit cliched, classes from superheroes, to silent films, to classic comedy acts.
""What Makes Toons Tick"" - Buster Bunny along with Calamity Coyote take trip back in time to certain first-time moments for certain characters.

I don't know when the fourth and final volume for ""Tiny Toons"" will be, but I do know that the fourth and final volume for another Steven Speilberg series ""Animaniacs"" will be finally out next month as of this posting !  So stay ""tooned"" for more updates to come !",1357776000,9,2239,4.75968992248062

5342327,3,B009JE18UE,"I have one complaint regarding this product, which will be the focus of the review.  While the first two ""volumes"" of the Tiny Toon Adventures collections offered 35 & 30 episodes (repectively), this latest volume contains 17.

Myself & my fianc contacted Warner Bros. about the banned episode ""Elephant Issues"" to be included on the DVD and spread the word via our fan clubs & forums were other fans contacted WB themselves and it was decided to be included.

Yes, I guess we are lucky to have them on DVD at all.  Our old VHS tapes won't hold out much longer (if they aren't unplayable already).

Warner's lack-luster approach to the menus borders on insulting.  Any 10-year-old with a decent DVD authoring program on his computer could do better.  At least with vols. 1 & 2 we got stills behind the menu choices.

I can live with the menus, but for me, the true insult is in the audio.  All the dialogue, music, and sound effects come solely from the center channel.  Separation between the left, right, and center channels was evident in the numerous broadcasts on numerous networks--why not on this DVD? Sure, video is paramount (and in this set, it's decent), but I love a good soundtrack, and the music and sound editing deserve better.

Between the menus and sound, I thought I may have received some sort of pre-production test copy.  Perhaps it was rushed since Warner Home Video wasn't going to include the ""Elephant Issues"" episode and then decided to at the last minute, supposedly due to fan requests.

This set does contain some of best episodes of TTA and you can definitely see the direction the creative staff was heading in as they moved towards Animaniacs.  So, yeah, fans are going to want it.  But the approach that companies like Warner and Disney take regarding their animated products sorely needs to improve.",1358726400,6,1447,4.67193675889328
