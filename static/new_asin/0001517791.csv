7787720,5,0001517791,"I went to a church aerobics class in the early 90's where they used this workout. I loved it so much I decided to buy one for myself. I have used this workout off and on over the years and have never stopped loving it. It is not only a well balanced workout, but the outstanding and timeless (scripture memory) music is good for lifting your spirit and getting you exciting about serving God. It features low, med and high intensity for all levels of ability. It is a pretty easy workout; however, the steps are a little hard to learn at first, but once you learn then it feels like flying...lot of fun!",1294790400,,603,4.298245614035087
