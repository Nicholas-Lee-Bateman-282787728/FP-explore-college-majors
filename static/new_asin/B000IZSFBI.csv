8239359,4,B000IZSFBI,"As one reviewer pointed out, it's really a beginner level workout.  However, a more experienced dancer should be able to her heart rate by layering on some extra shimmies.  It's slow enough that you can add styling and fit in extra movement to suit the energy level you have on any given day.  I think there may be one or two places where the music isn't on but that didn't really bother me.  I feel that this DVD has a place in my ""active"" rotation & that is more than I can say for 80% of them!  If you want a cardio workout, just keep moving - arms up, etc - or moderate with no arms or skip a spin.",1486857600,,602,3.9833333333333334
8239360,2,B000IZSFBI,"I have almost all the other IAMED DVDs and love them. I also, like Jindra as a performer so I couldn't give it one star. However, I felt this DVD did not flow well at all. From choreography to instruction it was a complete disappointment. As a seasoned dancer, I usually can find a DVD redeemable even if too basic, as I can pass it on to friends or students. However, this DVD was way too basic and redundant to keep any intermediate/advanced dancer's interest and way too awkward and poorly instructed to not frustrate a beginner. If you are looking for a workout try Jillina's belly dance workout video (even intermediates to advanced will find it not too boring). If you are looking for technique practice as a beginner look for any of IAMED intro DVDs (I loved Ansuyas basic DVD while learning) or for the seasoned dancer I love Sadie, Jillina's advanced DVDs or Ava Fleming. Happy dancing!!!!",1403222400,,898,4.61875
8239361,5,B000IZSFBI,"I absolutely love this workout dvd.  It has been part of my morning routine at least 4 times a week for over two years.  Jindra is an excellent teacher.  Her instructions are easy to follow and her voice is very pleasant and calming.  I lacked most of the muscle tone in my stomach area.  This workout dvd has helped strengthened the area for me.  Also, Jindra's routine is very accommodating and easy on my hip and back which suffered injuries years ago.  Jindra does a good job throughout the routine  advising how to avoid injury and to properly stretch.  I have recommended this dvd to all of my friends and colleagues.  Not only am I stronger, I have learned some pretty sexy moves!",1387324800,,687,4.512195121951219
8239362,5,B000IZSFBI,It's nice to have a workout DVD geared for the belly dancer and this is a excellent workout DVD.  I had no problems with Jindra counting as she leads you through the routines.  I liked the easy flow of the movements and felt I was able to not only get a good workout but also practiced my belly dance moves at the same time.  I would highly recommend it!,1350345600,2,354,4.101449275362318
8239363,2,B000IZSFBI,"BEGINNERS TO ADVANCED???? Uhmmmm It is maybe a good workout for beginners only...
Jindra is a good instructor... but the dvd is not well designed
the workouts are boring and you can't hear the music (imagine a workout without music!!!)",1227225600,5,235,4.9
8239364,5,B000IZSFBI,I love this DVD...I like that she counts many don't do that...A very good product from a peppy instructor...I just wish there was more...One of those that you don't want to end....,1194134400,2,180,4.65625
8239365,5,B000IZSFBI,"jindra is a highly trained professional dancer.  she is lovely, elegant and a fantastic teacher.

the other reviewer who complained about the counting must not understand that counting by a dance teacher is normal and expected in high level and professional dance lessons.  the counting facilitates understanding of where the movement fits in with the music.  perhaps the other reviewer does not understand how dance works with music in a numeric system.

jindra has lovely posture and attention should be paid to the sections regarding posture.  this is where you will learn to carry yourself as a dancer!

over all, a great dvd.  try it!",1186099200,8,639,5.019047619047619
8239366,1,B000IZSFBI,"Jindra looks cute and playful on the cover, but on the video she reveals quite unattractive manners. I could never understand instructors who yell at their students, and I get especially surprised when it happens to those who promise to teach us ""The Art of Belly Dance"".

And what Jindra screams at the top of her lungs is usually NOT instructions. It's mostly... numbers. I don't understand why she doesn't just allow herself and her audience to enjoy the music and the moves. Why ruin everything with meaningless (and extremely loud) counting and ""cuing""? Or, to get around Jindra's bad habits, why didn't IAMED include a ""music only"" option?

To make matters worse, the music was recorded at a much lower volume than Jindra's voice. If you want to hear the music, you'll have to make all your neighbors within 5 blocks listen to Jindra. And still, if you want to pay attention to *what* she yells, you'll have to strain your ears (I'm not sure if Jindra's diction is defective or it's just overall poor sound quality in the studio).

Not only does Jindra sound like a cheerleader, she also has gestures of a cheerleader. She is not the one from whom to learn grace and femininity.

Overall, these 3 workouts are just boring (especially the warm-ups and cool-downs that are too similar to each other and have little to do with bellydance moves).

What is especially annoying is that the section on posture was included TWICE in EACH of these workouts, resulting in 6 repetitions of the same (very simple) material!

As for the backup dancers, I didn't pay much attention to them, but I did notice that their costumes didn't flatter their figures at all. I think IAMED chose the worst possible outfits for them. I also noticed that one of the girls shimmies only one shoulder instead of two.

Finally, the camera wanders too much, and sometimes is in weird positions (e.g. from above).

I have another DVD by IAMED, ""Learn lavish layers with Ansuya"", and the two disks are just exact opposites of each other; I can't believe it was the same company... Ansuya's video is beautiful: the camera stays still, in a natural position; Ansuya speaks calmly and only matter-of-fact; she doesn't obscure the music with her voice... Well, Ansuya's grace is hard to beat, but still... Is it THAT difficult to at least refrain from screaming and compulsive counting? I don't think so, and one positive thing about Jindra is that she is very young, so hopefully she will have no trouble correcting her mistakes.",1163030400,6,2499,4.768518518518518
