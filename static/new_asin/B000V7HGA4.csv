While fictional, it is an excellent  way to reinforce the telling of Jesus' birth to young children.  I was very pleasantly surprised!",1451606400,,251,4.928571428571429

Every time I went over there throughout the Christmas season, he was watching any one of these movies (when allowed).  He loved them and watched them numerous times.
