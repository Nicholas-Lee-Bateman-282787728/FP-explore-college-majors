7893517,5,6305714932,"""Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman"" (DQMW) is one of my favorite TV series of all time.  I was a huge supporter of the romance between the 2 lead characters, Dr. Michaela Quinn (""Dr. Mike"") and Byron Sully (""Sully"") since the beginning of the series, which culminated in this wonderful wedding edpisode at the end of Season 3.  As one of the other reviewers said, they simply don't make epic romances like these on TV anymore.  The amazing acting chemistry between Jane Seymour and Joe Lando (who played Dr. Mike and Sully) was palpable from the 1st episode.  And Dr. Mike and Sully's wedding gave long-time fans all that they'd been waiting for, and more: Heartwarming romance, a bit of humor, action/adventure, familial love, and the return of several beloved characters.  The final scene of ""For Better or Worse"" is, in my opinion, one of the most beautiful and well-done TV love scenes ever.  This was a LOVE scene in the truest sense of the word.  Joe and Jane's subtle, stellar acting conveyed the deep love and long-brewing passion between Dr. Mike and Sully.  The result was a love scene that was heart-stopping sensual, romantic, and tender.  (And all with a minimum of skin shown and while preserving the ""PG"" rating befitting of a family show like DQMW).  In other words, every true romantic's dream come true!  Whether or not you were a fan of DQMW when it first aired during the 1990's, if you you enjoy romance, you'll throughly enjoy ""For Better or Worse.""  In addition to the VHS version offered here, you can also find it on the DVD Box-Set of the entire ""Dr. Quinn: Medicine Woman"" series, as well as on the Season 3 DVD.",1241481600,2,1630,4.660839160839161
7893518,5,6305714932,"I absolutely love this video. Its very interesting to me how a woman in the 1800s had to win the respect of a man to have equal rights. In doing all that she won the heart of an extremely cute guy in the process. I think that Jane Seymour and Joe Lando are the perfect actors to pursue these characters, very interesting characters. I just cannot say enough about this video and the whole series for that matter. You just have to get it. I highly recommend it for a person at any age. Preferrably a teenager and above.",1036972800,4,518,4.242424242424242
7893519,5,6305714932,"This was one of the best episodes of Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman ever. Jane Seymour and Joe Lando are magic together. The way they fought to have the type of wedding they wanted was very inspiring and romantic. I think that all their fans would love to see them together in another project. I continually look at all the reruns on television and I never get tired of looking at them. My goal is to one day own all the episodes, from the first one to the last one.",992217600,6,460,4.179775280898877
7893520,5,6305714932,"Mike and Sully continue their life and in this movie, there is lots of action!  I enjoyed seeing the same people of Colorado Springs again, and hope there are more movies coming!  I am sorry the series went off the air!",956793600,11,219,4.317073170731708
