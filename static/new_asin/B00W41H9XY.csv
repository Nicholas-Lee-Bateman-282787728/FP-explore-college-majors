8712055,4,B00W41H9XY,"I agree it's a fine movie, but it's in PAL format, which means it won't play on most DVD devices in the US. Amazon should have mentioned that. After buying this version and finding it didn't work, I had to rent the other one, from MARU entertainment -with the cartoonish, not photograhic, cover,",1462320000,,295,4.584905660377358
8712056,3,B00W41H9XY,"This is a Five Star movie.  That said, it doesn't play on US DVD players (wrong format).  However, it plays fine on my MacBook, so I can hook my MacBook up to my TV via an HDMI cable and things work perfectly.  To enjoy this film on your TV you need a laptop and an HDMI cable that will fit into a high speed port.",1461024000,,314,3.8
8712057,3,B00W41H9XY,"This is a comment not about the film itself (wonderful!) but about 3 different releases of the film on DVD:  Mr. Bongo50th Anniversary Restored Edition (a Spanish restoration; 2015), Mr. Bongo regular edition (2012) and the Suevia Films release as ""Campanadas a medianoche"" (2000).  The image quality of the Suevia Films is distinctly inferior to that of the other two versions and the image is far jumpier.  The most detail is captured on the Bongo50 version, but this seems to be done by reducing the dynamic range and heightening the exposure level, with the result that the image is really grey & white rather than black & white, and, for a restored version, there's still a lot of noise.  In all 3 versions, the image is very soft.  A quick search through the web indicates that some unnamed studio has plans to come out with a new release later in 2015, perhaps from the supposedly pristine positive print recently found and shown in France.  In any case, this masterpiece of cinematography definitely needs it.  None of the 3 versions I've seen is really up to par.  Has anyone seen the Sinister Films version (Italy, 2011) or the StudioCanal version (France, 2012) that was quickly suppressed for copyright reasons?  All but the last of these is available on amazon.co.uk.
Jan. 2018, update. I haven't seen the Criterion version that was recently released, but have now seen the Studio Canal version, which is absolutely superb, and doubt that the Criterion version could beat it in anything other than extras. The Studio Canal version looks as good as the first day it was seen, with blacks that are black and detail that stands out, and a camera that is no longer jittery--exactly the way an excellent quality B&W film should look. The only minus (and it's significant) is that the French subtitles can't be removed when watching it on T.V. They can, though, be removed if watching on a computer (for Mac users: watch it with VLC rather than iTunes; you have vastly greater control over the image, and VLC can remove the subtitles).",1439078400,19,2042,4.794871794871795
