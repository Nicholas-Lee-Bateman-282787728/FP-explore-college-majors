7910453,5,B00000ID1A,"This independent horror film featured many creative and artistic aspects including dark, atmospheric cinematography, intrigummsing and strange color schemes, and a rightfully ""captivating"" plot. As with any movie, there are sure to be some unfavorable traits, especially those within such an underground and low-budget film. With underrated acting from aspiring young actors, you still find yourself wanting to learn more about their dark, strange lives. Special effects reminiscent of 50's and 60's B-Horror Films that add a disgusting, yet exciting and riveting tone to each intense scene. Overall, the movie prevailed with an almost educational experience and a look back into the 90s.",1412553600,,688,5.689320388349515
7910454,3,B00000ID1A,"Connie Sprouts rents what has to be the most disgusting hotel room on the planet as a safe haven to harbor her 'offspring.' Turns out she is not quite human and is a fugitive from a greedy corporation than wants to use the alien lifeform hiding in her body for military weapons research.
Technically the movie is strongly made, well photographed and visually mounted. Where it fails is in the acting, which ranges from promising amateurishness to flat out horrid, and in the screewriting, which is unfocused in its exposition, fuzzy in some of its characterizations, and jerky in moving the story forward (perhaps this was a originally a short subject expanded to feature length?). Those interested in a Basket Case type scenario with plenty of off the wall humor might find something to like here, those wanting something a little more disturbing and/or frightening are going to have to look elsewhere.  Recommended to fans of the out there, but no one else.",997056000,,959,4.883435582822086
