7877776,1,6304828977,terrible quality.  Disc skipped. Threw it away after one try!  Rip off.,1488758400,,71,4.833333333333333
7877777,5,6304828977,"I love this and ""Firm Total Body: Abs Hips & Thighs Sculpting"", they have effective exercises to target the thighs and hips, and the workout isn't too long.  I also like how these are ""floor leg"" workouts, meaning they don't involve any standing/jumping/squatting/lunging for the days when my knees or feet are too tired from work.

By the way, I would recommend these two videos above the newer ""Body Sculpting - Fast & Firm Series"" Hips, Thighs, and Abs"" video.",1162339200,,463,4.775
7877778,5,6304828977,"I've had this tape forever and just peeked over to see if it is on DVD- currently unavailable unfortunately. This is one of those rare lower body tapes that is, blessedly, ALL FLOOR WORK. Yay! And what great floor work it is. Not too tough, but absolutely effective. You will see results soon with this very balanced, smart tape. Tracey Long is a good instructor, pleasant, good cueing and descriptions. This is a major winner in my repertoire. Love it!!! Great ab work also.",1158105600,2,475,4.666666666666667
7877779,5,6304828977,"I've been using this tape now for about four months.  Incredibly, I've gone from tight size 12 jeans to loose size 8 jeans without losing one pound! It's amazing how much tighter and smaller I am, and I owe it all to this tape.  Some of the tape uses ankle weights and dumbells, which you can keep increasing in weight so the tape never gets too easy.  I use the tape three or four times a week.  If you buy this tape, make sure that you send away for the free tape that ""The Firm"" provides- ""20 questions on fitness""- it's very informative.",993772800,10,541,4.223300970873787
7877780,5,6304828977,"This is an excellent workout for the buns, hips and thighs.  Tracy Long is an excellent right to the point instructor and will keep you right on queue all the way through. The tape does start with a very good abdominal workout.  Without it, you wouldn't see the same nice shaping of the hips.  Those core stabilizer muscles are essential for all other body shaping and should be worked every time you workout. This tape also works all the major muscle groups from the waist down including the all important pelvic floor muscles.  It's a short tape which is perfect for those days when you're running late but want to get in a good solid workout.  As with all Firm tapes, this tape can be adapted to the beginner through advanced levels by adding weights.
My personal experience with this tape is very positive.  I manage to slip this tape in once a week and have been watching my lower body begin to take on a very wonderful shape.  All in all, it's one of my favorite workouts because it's quick and simple (I won't say it's painless ;)  As with all Firm workouts, you will see results in 10 workouts.  I started seeing results from Firm workouts after only 4 workouts and the results just keep on coming.
I'd recommend this tape to anyone who wants to shape their lower body.  This tape can be used by beginner through advanced.  If it's too easy you can slap on some ankle weights until you feel it working.",974764800,40,1410,4.447470817120623
7877781,4,6304828977,"I've been using the FIRM videos off and on for about 3 months.  Recently I decided that I was going to start exercising ""seriously"" again and I added this one thinking that I could shape up my outer (and  especially inner) thighs.  While there are <some> inner thigh  exercises, it's mostly abs.  I would recommend using this tape in  combination with another exercise regime since it's virtually impossible to  do a lot of the ab work--the leg extensions!  (How do they DO that! )  without your back crying for mercy.  I would have preferred more inner  thigh work and less abs.  It's still VERY good though, and the FIRM tapes  are the best tapes I've ever used!  (Eat your heart out Oxycise and Body  Flex! )",950659200,21,711,4.531746031746032
7877782,5,6304828977,"The perfect video for someone who doesn't have tons of time to exercise.  It's not a long workout, but it gets the job done.  You don't need weights (but you can use them if you wish) and you don't need a step.  It's also  easy to learn the routine after you do it a few times.  Results come  quickly!",934502400,,301,4.016949152542373
7877783,5,6304828977,"This is an excellent lower body workout! I just recently started to workout again (2 weeks and counting). The video is completely floor work. I alternate this video with several others from The Firm library, and I am  already seeing results! Of course, this motivates me to continue. I am a  Firm believer! I have already ordered the Standing Legs video and I'm  anxious to incorporate it into my current video rotation. The instructor,  Tracey Long, is the best Firm instructor I've seen so far. If you want to  firm up your abs, butt, and thighs, you will not be disappointed with this  video. It's great for beginners.",922147200,4,621,4.703703703703703
