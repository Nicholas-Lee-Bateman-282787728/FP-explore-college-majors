8222732,1,B000WCUKHO,"Okay, for one ... GREAT information on the body and nutrition, overall. BUT, and I say this with assurance, It's NOT what you think it is.

I can remember when I was with AMWAY (great company) ... But, I remember my friend coming to me and saying, ""Hey, I'd like you to come by the house, tomorrow night, and check out a new business I'm looking at getting into ...."" ""SURE! I said"" and so, the next night follows, I show up at the house, and there's several people there, not just me ... but, like 10 of them ... and there's a guy standing in the front with a whiteboard, and marker, and begins to talk about how we all could make big bucks, and this, and that, and more this and that ... I am totally ""hooked"" .... and then ... at the very end of the presentation, an hour later or so, he finally says, ""I'm part of a business called 'X' and we are a leg off of ""AMWAY"" ....

Then, it hit me .... this was all about AMWAY .... and ""true"" you could get rich, IF you are successful at it ... and I don't have anything against AMWAY ... I did sign up and loved it ... Had fun!

Now ... back to this product ...

Here's my take: While I am and still am impressed with the information, I think this DVD is what's called a ""handout"" tool. Meaning .... It's a tool for me to give to somebody with the following statement: ""Hey, I have a great opportunity for you to help you with your diabetis ... and you stop it from progressing, and help heal your body up so you don't have the symptoms...""

Of course, you're going to ask me or say? ""That's impossible! No way! It's a disease!""

and I say, ""Is it really? Do you really know everything there is about diabetes? Tell you what ... I have a DVD that talks about it.... Check it out, and let me know your thoughts on it....""

I don't tell you anything about any products ... I just give it to you to watch...

The video does a GREAT job of ""hooking"" you ... and it makes quite good sense ... but, he never gives you the solution, because the solution is supposedly in the ""products"", of which, if you are interested, I would sign you up for the products ....

That's a very BRIEF overall initial take ....

I am led to believe this because if you watch the 2nd video, at the very very end, Rod talks about ""LifeHealth On The Go"" ... One, I can not find this product, anywhere on the net ... If you find it, let me know. Two, on the video, Rod says, ""If you have any questions, ask the person who gave you this video..."" BINGO!!!!!!, THREE, Rod NEVER mentions any specific foods, at all ... he generalizes ... and uses third person because he doesn't want you looking up factories making his product ...

As far as the video goes, itself .... Information-wise, it's good .... I'm not sure all of it is ""safe"" but, the discussions about how the cell works, and the difference between dehydration and cellular dehydration, and how niacin binded with other minerals and stuff actually helps it to really work, (and I hope that's true), is great information .... I plan on keeping the DVD .... hands down, because it's very encouraging to eat right... But, I think diabetes can be ""stopped"" .... and of course, I think it depends on how far along one is in the stages of diabetes .... and I do believe that diabetes is a collection of symptoms, and how the body/brain is tricked or convinced that the pancreas is spitting out too much insulin and can cause it to stop producing OR not produce enough.

Also: You can find him anywhere on the internet, i.e., no website... AND the phone number on the DVD is incorrect.... So ... some assumptions .... This is a fluke and somebody has a bunch of DVD's to sell.... :)

But ... the information, on the flip side, is interesting to say the least .... I am going to get some Chromium bound with Niacin.... :) CLASS 1 if I can find it.... :) Hope this helps .... BEWARE ... it's more information than anything ... You will find no specific solution.",1357862400,,3930,4.237967914438503
8222733,1,B000WCUKHO,"In this video he gives absolutely NO INFORMATION on how to fix or cure diabetes.  He simply talks about the fact that diabetes is just a symptom not a disease, but no information at all is actually given on how to heal yourself.  The only thing he does is tell you to look at his website for the information on some supplements and if you do try and go to his website you will find it no longer exists.  This is a complete waste of money, don't buy it nothing useful found in here.  If you want this I'll sell you mine for the cost of shipping...  It's worthless!",1271894400,4,563,4.128440366972477
