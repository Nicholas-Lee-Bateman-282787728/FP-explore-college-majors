7786270,5,B01HE7QI16,It's true that it's a low budget film but when I got a chance to see it I had a blast. Maria Thayer is an incredibly beautiful actress and fun to watch. If you're already a zombie fanatic and love the Walking Dead and such take a break from the darker side and give this zombie comedy a chance.,1466812800,,294,4.0
7786271,5,B01HE7QI16,"In environmentally friendly Portland, Maine, shy Deb (Maria Thayer) throws herself at pretty boy Ryan (Michael Cassidy) while at a bar. Neither remembers anything about the night before and Ryan wants to give her the boot from his apartment. Deb, meanwhile, makes it difficult for him. The next thing you know there is a local zombie outbreak.

This is a fun comedy romance with zombies. Maria Thayer nails it and I couldn't help think about how she was Emma Stone good. The comedy and one liners oozed sweetly during much of the film. The graffiti throughout the town was funny for those that bother to look at it. Original and fresh.

Guide: 1-2 F-bombs. No sex or nudity. Syd Wilder spilling out of her top.",1466553600,5,710,4.672

7786274,4,B01HE7QI16,"Turned out better than I thought. As far as zom-rom-com's go though, not the best. That honor goes to Shaun of the Dead. Also liked Life After Beth more but this still was a fun film.",1477526400,,183,4.111111111111111
7786275,5,B01HE7QI16,"This is a great little film. Decidedly light on budget and begging for a matinee or a late night of popcorn.

As soon as the cerebral palsy zombie bit, I knew this film was a keeper. Throughout it is a quirky comedy with a taste for American history and some laughs. In many ways it reminds me of Eight Legged Freaks but it only had a Kickstarter budget. Despite the budget: the characters and story drive it forward and makes the most of what they have to work with.

Deb is amazing. Like Ash from Evil Dead kind of amazing. But instead of a bloodied idiot, she's smart and annoying. You'll probably go mad from the bizarre personality. Ryan is less likely to make you reach for a rock, given he's got a rather more Starbucks quality about him. Together they make a good balance in an old jalopy that came with a gun in the glove box, ""Sorta"" fleeing the zombie apocalypse.

Oh, and throwing coffee at a zombie is a total waste!",1476921600,,929,4.327586206896552

7786278,5,B01HE7QI16,"Really enjoyed the movie and watched it several times.  Different spin on a Zombie movie with a really well written screenplay by writer Andy Selsor.  Maria Thayer does an amazing performance delivering some really well-written dialog.  She pulls off this off-the-beaten path lovable nerd, Deb Clarington, and keeps your attention throughout the entire movie.  Her sidekick, Ruby played by Julie Brister, was also very funny and engaging.  Just wish she had more screen time.  Also, some good moments and scenes with the other characters as well.

Overall very entertaining and definitely recommend the movie.  With Halloween coming up, this should be on your list.",1474156800,2,665,5.326923076923077
7786279,5,B01HE7QI16,"Excellent, even the evil governor of maine was great. Deb is a hottie.",1473984000,,70,4.461538461538462
7786280,3,B01HE7QI16,"Night of the Living Deb blends comedy with horror, a feat accomplished previously in Shaun of the Dead and Pride + Prejudice + Zombies. Here, the setting is modern-day Portland, Maine. Deb (Maria Thayer) awakens on July 4th after a one-night stand with the handsome Ryan (Michael Cassidy), feeling pretty good about herself and things in general. But her mood darkens when Ryan kicks her out and she encounters the zombie apocalypse. Now, she and Ryan have to set aside the awkwardness of the previous night and get out of town without  becoming a zombie meal.

Deb is a very funny heroine who always has a zinger at hand and is adept at turning an end-of-mankind scenario into a neat spoof of the zombie genre. Shes the smartest character in the film, with the guys either dumb or helpless when it comes to making quick, life-saving decisions. The pace gets sluggish toward the end, but the conclusion doesnt disappoint. Theres little chemistry between Ms. Thayer and Mr. Cassidy, which makes it hard to believe they found each other attractive enough to share a bed.

Special features on the unrated widescreen Blu-ray release include commentary with writer-director Kyle Rankin, actors Maria Thayer and Michael Cassidy, writer Andy Selsor, and editor Tony Copollo; bloopers; behind-the-scenes making-of featurette; and trailer.",1473120000,,1330,5.119815668202765
8765200,5,B01HE7QI16,"An unexpected delight! Ive been recommending this to family and friends since I happened to catch it on Netflix around Halloween. There aren't enough good new romantic comedies these days, and this mashup of zombie horror with a charming, semi-hapless heroine (the wonderful Maria Thayer) finding love has become a favorite.",1517011200,,324,5.372549019607843
8765201,2,B01HE7QI16,"I kept waiting for this movie to get better, especially after reading all of the 4 and 5 star reviews.  I was hoping for something more like Shaun of the Dead, and this just missed the mark.  There were a lot more cringeworthy moments than laughs for me.",1516924800,,254,4.270833333333333

8765206,2,B01HE7QI16,"If you get passed the first 15 minutes you _might_ get through the movie.  But honestly, Thayer just doesn't get the job done unless there are others in the scene.  I'm not sure what others see in this movie but it's not that great.

Even if you do make it through this movie... well, you might not really think it was worth your time.  It's like something you're just waiting to see if it gets better.  And it really doesn't.

We like goofy, fun movies...&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shaun-of-the-Dead/dp/B0018OFN4U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shaun of the Dead</a>&nbsp;is high on our list of laughs as well as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/John-Dies-at-the-End/dp/B00ATLJYL6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">John Dies at the End</a>&nbsp;and Bruce Campbell movies are held in high esteem.",1482364800,2,876,6.573913043478261

8765208,4,B01HE7QI16,"""Charming"" and ""cute"" are two words that you don't often use to describe a zombie film, but ""Night Of The Living Deb"" is both of those things. It's also funny, although most of the big laughs for me were at the beginning.",1478044800,,221,4.285714285714286
