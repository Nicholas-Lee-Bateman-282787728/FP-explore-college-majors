7931470,5,B0000560UZ,"In the opening fight sequence, one ninja jumps on top of another ninja's sword and uses it as a springboard to leap up on top of a nearby building's roof, at which points he scoots up to the top of the roof in a scene that was obviously played in reverse. With that very scene, you will know whether or not this film is for you. If you're not roaring with laughter by then, do yourself a favor and turn the movie off.

If you've ever played a beat-em-up video game from the 1980s, you already know the plot to The Super Ninja. It's the tale of a cop named John who also happens to be a super ninja, his partner Spencer, and their corrupt police captain. When John is set up and taken down for drugs, he retreats to the woods for a long Rambo-esque sequence, but later he must face the five elemental ninjas, which are unrelated to the five elemental ninjas in the film ""Five Elemental Ninjas."" At one point, after running sideways up a tree, John fights a ninja whose hands are on fire while music from Star Wars plays in the background. By then you should already be ""all in"" with this film.

About 1/3 the way through the film there's a 5-10 minute sex scene that's so long that I actually fast forwarded through it. Let's just say the super ninja apparently knows how to work his long sword and leave it at that. Fortunately once it ends we can get back to all the ninja theatrics, which are great.

If you only watch movies in French or love romantic comedies, this is not the film for you. If you love ninja movies and are thinking, ""I hope there's a guy who tunnels underground wearing a diaper and a Hitler mustache and leaps out to attack people,"" then boy have you picked the right movie!",1487462400,,1697,4.280373831775701
7931471,1,B0000560UZ,"I didn't really watch this movie all the way through as I couldn't get past the super grainy video. The video is worse than VHS quality. If you don't mind the quality of the video this could very well be a good movie. As for me, I fast forward to the fight scenes and called it a day. Thank God I bought a used copy and didn't pay some of the outrageous prices some of these sellers are trying to sell this for.",1289520000,,411,3.963855421686747
7931472,5,B0000560UZ,"Director Chang Cheh made over a hundred films many of which are hailed, by those who know this stuff, as kung fu classics. Famed action director John Woo was quoted as naming him as a major influence and when you see this classic it's easy to see why; When the action starts, it's breathless, over the top and doesn't stop.
A SPOILER FREE SYNOPSIS: Some nasty ninja have killed our hero's martial arts teacher. With the aide of a new teacher and some new fighting buddies our hero takes on the ""Five Element Ninjas"" (Gold, Fire, Water, Wood & Land).
Bottom Line: It's exciting, it's violent and if you like kung fu it's impossible to only watch this movie once. For more Chang Cheh brilliance try 'The Kid with the Golden Arms' or '5 Deadly Venoms'.",1002240000,9,749,4.514705882352941
