7876348,5,6304729219,"Oh yeah!  Look, I know I claimed that tape 5 was the best of the series.  Now that I've seen the ENTIRE series, I can easily say that this one reigns supreme.  Golden Boy, which has been all about making fun of anime, takes  it one step farther and makes starts making fun of ITSELF.  The director of  the series Tatsuya Egawa animates himself into the show, APPP studios  becomes ABCD studios, and it goes on from there.  Hell, they even managed  to throw in a star wars gag! For cryin' out loud, buy this tape! The best  Golden Girl yet, and cameos by all of the girls from tapes 1-5 make this  the ultimate in anime entertainment.",952041600,2,633,4.279661016949152
