Depending on when in 2007 this product was actually given a title, I'm either elated or flabbergasted that it exists.",1416960000,,243,4.809523809523809
8533626,5,B000QUU4SC,"Yes, I am Sharen's son, but I will give an unbiased review. I have a one year old and a two year old. What's great about this DVD and what makes it truly unique is that it provides awesome activities for you as the parent to do with your kids. I often find myself watching the kids and wanting to play and interact with them but don't know what to do. This DVD has tons of hands-on activities and ideas for playful, yet educational fun and most importantly is a catalyst to bring you closer to your children, physically and mentally. Some of the activities are a bit messy and involve food. My mothers words always stick in my head, ""What's five minutes of clean-up when you just spent an hour of quality fun time with your kids?"" Couldn't be more true. Also, there is a very ""green"" basis behind the activities because most of the supplies can be found around the house (paper towel rolls, cardboard boxes) and recycled after use. Remember, the first two of the three R's are Reduce and Reuse. You reduce by not buying new products and Reuse by creating a second use for them before they go to the recycle bin. I highly recommend this DVD for parents and other caregivers who love spending quality time with kids and want to make that time better.",1242172800,,1248,4.406926406926407
