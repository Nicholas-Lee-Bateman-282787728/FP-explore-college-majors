1834175,2,B00008AOTM,"13 Rue Madeleine started out with potential.  It opens at a British spy school (where everybody seems to be Americans or French) and the man in charge of schooling this batch of students (Cagney) is told one of the students is a spy and it's up to him to determine who.  Some quick scenes of spy training are shown depicting some of the training techniques employed by such schools.  This was probably the most interesting part of the film.
From there, the film jumps to graduation day and Cagney has determined who the spy is and is told to send this spy on a mission intended to decoy the Germans from the true date and location of the impending invasion of Europe. Things go wrong on this mission from the start and Cagney has to go in to clean up the mess.
The acting is only 'OK' by all but the mayor of a small French town and American actors play the German officers.  They even speak English when speaking amongst themselves.  While having 'Germans' speaking English detracts from the film, at least they spared us and didn't try to fake German accents.  Furthermore, the Germans are depicted as being competent with their duties instead of bumbling idiots.  For these reasons, the film rates two stars instead of only one.
However, this story missed out on so many chances to be a lot better.  The spy is discovered from the start of the film and there are no tense moments at all.  They could have written the film so that it appeared this one person was the spy but still left the possibility open for it to be somebody else.  Furthermore, there are no tense moments in this film at all.  There's no suspense and there's no action.  It's just a bunch of actors going about living their lives.
Even when the German intellegence agents are onto what's going on the movie just jumps right to the plot point.  There's a scene where the Germans are using radio direction finding equipment to triangulate the position of a British agent's broadcast and they find the agent within 10 seconds of the opening of the scene.  Again, a lot of cat-and-mouse scenes could have been written into this story but as it is it's too flat - too linear.  There's no drama, no suspense, and very little action.  Not much to see here.",1070236800,5,2222,4.503740648379052
1834176,5,B00008AOTM,"13 RUE MADELEINE is one of Hollywood's last stand against the Axis--a post WWII film that explains our  cloak and dagger OSS effort which helped whip those sneaky Nazis.  The Cloak and Cagney go well together in this film. Cagney captured my pleasant attention since  for once he was acting and not making a bully of himself.  13 must be measured against its' historical contribution to movies.  It does help explain the American fear of Nazi and Japanese spies at the onset of WWII.  We, in fact, had no credible military intelligence until the OSS. As Hollywood's attempt through this film to continue WWII should have rated only 4 stars, however I gave it the extra 5th star because the  German soldiers were not  portrayed as inept morons. This is a very entertaining film viewed in  an historical context.",993081600,12,810,4.76978417266187

1834185,3,B00008AOTM,"Every once in a while it is legitimately possible to think, to what if think,  about what would have happened in a military situation if certain information had been available about the enemys deployments, strengths, and such. If that that information had been used in a timely manner. In modern times one thinks about Stalins head-in-the-sand attitude toward Hitler with the signing of the German-Russian non-aggression pact prior to World War II after he had been informed by master spy Richard Sorge and others of the date on which the German armies would be advancing on Russia in June, 1941. And one can think as well about what would have happened if the Germans, who were desperately working on finding out the information, had known about the place and time where the second front was to be opened up, had known that it was Normandy. Seeking that information had been the subject of several novels and films, especially espionage thrillers, including the early docu-drama under review, 13 Rue Madeleine.

No question modern espionage is a tough racket, no longer as a rule is one nation able to gather information about another in wartime without some professional direction. Of course we all know of the CIA in America, and some may know of its precursor during World War II, the OSS. With the use of a little cinematic license the storyline of this film is based on one of the wartime files from that latter agency, a story about how one gallant team of spies thwarted yet another German effort to find out about the landing place for the second front in Europe.

As  I mentioned doing such spy work in modern times takes plenty of certain kind of skills, physical, mental and emotional and so the first part of the film concentrate on weeding out the professionals from the amateurs. And that nuts and bolts work has been entrusted to a well-thought of master spy, Bob Sharkey (played by old time cinematic gangster James Cagney) who is charged with creating teams who will eventually see action in Europe in secret locations in England. The film focuses on the creation of one such team, a team which to add to the intrigue has been infiltrated by a master German spy, Wilhem Kuncel (played by Richard Conte), who has been sent by the High Command to see if he can find out the landing spot.

Of course the Americans are on to Kuncel and to flush him out Sharkey has devised a fake mission for him and his team (while giving the other two team members a different mission, to get the French rocket scientist Dubois out of France and into Allied hands in order to tell them where the rockets the Germans have placed in strategic spots were located). But Kuncel was no fool, had been at the spy business for a while, and so he ditched his team (killing one and setting up the other) and returned to his own side. Kuncels escape leaves things in a tight spot since he can turn in every agent he trained with. So naturally somebody has to do in Kuncel and Sharkey despite his knowledge of the time and place of the landing volunteers. He wants revenge for those lost agents as well. Their mission had been aborted but they still needed to get Dubois to give them the locations of the rocket sites.

And by a circuitous route Sharkey does get Dubois out and singing to the Allies with the help of the French Resistance. But he also gets captured by a Kuncel-led manhunt and taken to 13 Rue Madeleine, the Gestapo headquarters in the area. The Gestapo torture him trying to get that damn information about the landing out of him. Sharkeys bosses back in England know two things; Sharkey is a goner under the torturous Gestapo regime and Kuncel must not get any information about the landing out of 13 Rue Madeleine. So with the traitor Dubois giving the coordinates they sent a bombing mission to level that location to the ground. And it was making Sharkey posthumously a hero. Like I said modern espionage is a tough racket.",1415750400,,3932,4.618025751072961

1834198,2,B00008AOTM,"This pseudo docudrama about United States Government secret agents code-named 077 during World War II is really a propaganda B-movie with a contrived story about a top German Army agent infiltrating Project 077 in Washington D.C. during WWII. Project 077 agents after alleged secret training are later tasked with kidnapping in France, the Frenchman who allegedly designed the secret, German V-2 missile sites along the French coast. I won't bore you with the entire story because it doesn't matter. It is all contrived.

For example, the secret German agent, a French woman and an American agent are flown to Holland to be dropped by parachute. While approaching the drop-zone, approximately one minute before jumping, the jumpmaster inside the aircraft attaches each person's parachute static lines to the aircraft wall. Yet, later we learn that the German agent somehow used a knife to cut the static line of the American's parachute, causing him to plummet to his death. Supposedly, neither the American, the French agent or the jumpmaster saw the German pull out a knife, reach behind the American, pull him forward and cut the static line. Those Germans are really sly: easy to see why they were the ""Master Race.""

This film did not age like fine wine: Plus, after almost 70 years from the so-called D-day invasion of France, the story is boring with a capital B as in B-movie with Jimmy Cagney playing a cardboard character eager to give his life for Old Glory. Unless you are addicted to World War II movies or are a fanatical Jimmy Cagney fan, there is little or no reason to waste your time watching pseudo patriotic gibberish. And, in case you think the action is in France, the exterior scenes were shot in Quebec City, Canada.",1373846400,,1740,4.894915254237288
1834199,3,B00008AOTM,"""13 Rue Madeleine,"" (1947).  This American postwar black and white World War II spy thriller was deliberately held back until the end of the war, to avoid giving the Axis powers any clue as to how our new spy service, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), worked.  It's a classic action/adventure/drama, directed by Henry Hathaway, filmed on location in Quebec, standing in for occupied France, in a semi-documentary style that was new then, and had audiences flocking to the theaters. Viewers may notice that, to be extra careful, the OSS is never mentioned by name in this film.  Louis de Rochmont produced; he and Hathaway had also made the New York based World War II spy thriller&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-House-on-92nd-Street-Fox-Film-Noir/dp/B0009X766O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The House on 92nd Street (Fox Film Noir)</a>, pioneering the semi-documentary style. 13 RUE MADELEINE now survives in an uneasy half-life, probably because of its star, James Cagney. The pint-sized former song and dance man -- and ultimate player of gangsters -- plays Robert Emmett ""Bob"" Sharkey, former spy himself, kicked upstairs to teach the first classes of fledgling spies at O.S.S.

Sharkey finds that one of his agents in training is a Nazi double, but decides not to arrest him.  Instead, Sharkey decides to feed the double agent false information about the Allied invasion of Europe.  Meanwhile, a team of agents goes to France to find a secret V-2 rocket depot.  But the German spy has not been fooled, murders another of Sharkey's men, and manages to rejoin his people.  He now knows too much and Sharkey has made a decision that came back to haunt him.  Knowing he faces tremendous risks, Sharkey goes into France himself to try to clean up his mess.

The young actors Red Buttons and Karl Malden have unaccredited parts as jump masters.  The young E.G. Marshall plays Emile.  The notorious Russian spies Ethel and Julius Rosenberg appear as themselves in archival footage.

The movie is dated, sometimes unrealistic, perhaps excessively patriotic and nave for modern tastes but Cagney and Conte have meaty roles and do well by them.  Oh, and the title?  13 Rue Madeleine is the address of the Gestapo in Le Havre, nearest big city to where the action in France is taking place.

1834203,3,B00008AOTM,"13 Rue Madeline(1947) is one of the many spy films produced after the war detailing the heroic efforts of the OSS and there ilk. This one is designed like a docu-Drama with one of the lamest of 40s and 50s devices: the overuse of a monotone narrator to explain the plot. It does not help to include such a meandering voice on an already leisurely paced film and it keeps this film strictly as a historical piece and little else.

The film could have certianly used a little more blood and thunder. If there's any consollation it's in the lead acting of James Cagney who delivers a full blooded performance. He's quite athletic in this and delivers the action nicely, what little there is of it. He also invokes that sense of hard boiled world weariness he brought his gangster characterizations especially in that conclusion as he laughs maniaclly at his and the enemy's imminent destruction.
Most of the cast can't begin to compare to this role, but there are a few standouts. Richard Conte has a diificult role as a German Double agent who despite being set up primarily as a villian still gains some sympathy. He was largely under utilized in most films but is a standout here. The same can be said for veteran actor Sam Jaffe as the leader of the Dutch resisitance who brings his usual amount of sincerity to a part that wasn't as well written as could be.

The film is certainly interesting and features a pretty exciting final thirty minutes, but there were(and would) be better genre pieces than this and this film is largely reccomended for Cagney fans who wish to savor another of the actor's charismatic performances.",1245110400,,1627,4.665505226480836

I always thought he was staying in the room at that time, but, having seen the film for the first time, I realized the room was filmed for that sequence.

It does not provide a lot of suspense or action.  It does not provide any great insights into WWII intelligence gathering or operations. The first part of the movie is a government primer on how thoroughly the intelligence agents are trained. The announcer's dramatic voice-over throughout the movie is intended to lend authenticity to the tale.

Cagney gives a credible low-key performance by subordinating his normally feisty character portrayal to the low-key script he was handed.  The dangerous German counterspy who infiltrates the intelligence operation is revealed early in the movie.  After that it is a story of sacrifice and duty to country.

Apparently, he was aptly named. One of his favorite ""spy-tricks"" was to parachute allied agents behind Nazi lines - usually ill-prepared and untrained and , to a person, never to be heard from again!

The OSS was the WW2 predecessor of the CIA and this very same tactic was continued with the same dismal results!

However, ""13 Rue Madelaine"" is an excellent and exciting  movie with a thrilling if not costly ending.

Cagney's character is a high ranking official in U.S. military intelligence who recruits a group of agents known as 077.  Their dangerous mission involves insertion into Nazi occupied Europe to confuse the Germans as to the details of the looming D-day invasion of Europe.

Cagney and his superior Charles Gibson played by Walter Abel, are alerted to the presence of a Nazi spy within their midst posing as one of the 077 recruits.  It is determined that Richard Conte playing Bill O'Connell alias Kuncel is the cunning German spy.  They purposely fail to expose him, hoping to have him spread misinformation they've been feeding him.

The shrewd Conte to be inserted with 2 other operative in Holland gets suspicious and kills one of the agents.  This will ultimately require Cagney to take his place.

Cagney drops into Vichy controlled France near Le Havre and with help from clandestine French Resistance leader and local mayor Galimard played by Sam Jaffe gets his plan organized.  He unfortunately gets captured and is held in Le Havre Gestapo headquarters at 13 Rue Madeleine.

Richard Conte does a nice job as the German disguising himself as an American and eventually has a showdown with Cagney. That's in the suspenseful last 30 minutes which saves the film.",1145923200,2,570,4.419047619047619
1834214,4,B00008AOTM,"We're in the middle of the Second World War, the Allies have decided on the location  where they'll launch their massive invasion of Europe, and spies are battling spies to hide and discover the facts.  Thank goodness we have Jimmy Cagney on our side.

  Cagney plays the rough-and-tumble spy Bob Sharkey in Henry Hathaway's 13 RUE MADELEINE (1947), one of a number of motion pictures released shortly after the war that celebrated the exploits of America's nascent espionage organization, the OSS (Office of Strategic Services.)  Although the movie ends in an exciting, if somewhat abrupt, scene behind enemy lines, a great deal of this movie takes place in what can probably best be described as a spy school.  The movie begins with a rather extended montage of stock documentary film of London during wartime before gradually, and neatly, folding it into the movie proper.  The first half of the movie concerns itself with the acceptance of a number of highly qualified candidates (including Annabella, Richard Conte and Frank Latimore), the rigorous training they undergo (Is that the brake of a train or a steam kettle you hear on the phonograph record?) and the discovery of a mole.  A mole whom, of course, they leave in place so that the enemy can be fed disinformation and, hopefully, lead the good guys to the bad guys and their cache of rocket bombs in the Low Countries.  Ah, spy movies!  Especially spy movies where our spies are better than their spies.

  As usual Cagney is convincing as the spy trainer who eventually is forced to take the field, and 13 RUE MADELEINE'S semi-documentary treatment works well.  Hathaway takes enough of a gritty realist approach to make this one believable, even if his presentation of the infallibility of Cagney the Spy stretches credibility.  The film is in good condition, and old film fans should look quick for Karl Malden and E.G. Marshall in bit roles.",1120694400,19,1909,4.900311526479751
1834215,4,B00008AOTM,"I don't care if this review is helpful or not. This film was made to show people what the Office of Statigic Services Did and was made for entertainment it is not a docuementary. Most of us have had a good time watching films about spies and enjoyed a good spy story. in 1947 the war was over for two years and a lot of people

still didn't know what went on or how it was fought and films like this showed people what the costs where and that people died.",1103414400,6,456,4.010989010989011
1834216,3,B00008AOTM,"This isn't a great movie. It is however, a good movie. THe potential is there for it to be great, but it doesn't rise to the occasion.
 The story might have been more engaging if it weren't done documentary style. Small things, such as the French and German characters speaking with the appropriate accents, would have improved the films quality.
I do however like the fact that there are no cheesy romantic subplots. It is also nice to see the Axis powers (in this case the Germans) being portrayed as competent individuals, rather than buffoons as so many other movies of the era do.
Ultimately, this movie is a must addition to my collection because of my love of Cagney. Originally, I had only seen the final scene of this movie when it was on AMC. I will not give it away, but I was so engaged by Cagney's laugh and the look on his face given the circumstances in the last minute of the film, I bought the film. If you're a Cagney fan, I don't think you'll be dissapointed. His performance is quite good. If you're not, then I think I'd skip this one.",1089590400,11,1056,4.387755102040816
