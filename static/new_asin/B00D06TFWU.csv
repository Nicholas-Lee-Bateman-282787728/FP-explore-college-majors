8588105,1,B00D06TFWU,"First of all, this DVD did not play on my DVD player, only on my computer, so I have to return it.  Second, the adaptation, you should know, skips the overture and much more, and does not employ a full orchestra--just a piano and some instruments, as far as I could tell.  Better to skip this and wait for a real production to be released.",1451606400,9,339,4.2
