The one chick can't even say Amityville right....I can't say ANYTHING good about this movie. If you want it for you Amityville collection, which is why I'll keep it, but it's worse than The Amityville Haunting. Grrrrr......",1411776000,2,318,4.8
6097745,4,B00GP382W4,"Okay,

Its Not BAAAAAADDDDDD .... but its close. Look, its an Amityville movie so for the most part, if your a fan of the film series then you know it has been on a downward spiral since Amityville Curse. This keeps a lot of classic source material and the Doctors performance is so over the top its enjoyable. Honestly hes great and not in a good way :D  Still, its on my shelf and nice to see another film to one of my favorite series. I don't see this movie sparking any interest for a revitalization of the series but what the heck, Ive seen and owned worse. The story is interesting enough to carry itself, so its with out a doubt worth a look. Also, as I said, If your a fan of the Amityville series, at least its better then Amityville Haunting ;P",1391299200,7,754,4.1931034482758625
6097746,4,B00GP382W4,"I am surprised that I made it past the first 20 or so mood setting minutes of this film. But after the obligatory set-up, the action and suspense finally arrives, and along with it, my smile. This is an interesting take on the Amityville saga, and worthy of a movie marathon viewing.",1389657600,4,283,4.461538461538462
6097747,5,B00GP382W4,"One of the most enduring franchises in horror-film history, Amityville-based thrillers never disappoint!  Just when you thought they couldn't do anything else with the infamous house... along comes horror-meister Andrew Jones with plans to expand it and turn it into an Asylum for the criminally insane!  That's a pretty insane concept in itself, so KUDOS!!",1389657600,7,357,5.472727272727273
6097748,2,B00GP382W4,"The film is written, produced, directed, and scored by Andrew Jones (Night of the Living Dead: Resurrection, The Feral Generation, Silent Night, Bloody Night: The Homecoming) .

Lisa (Sophia Del Pizzo) gets a job as a night time cleaner at the High Hopes asylum built on the same spot as the infamous Amityville haunted house. We later find out that some pagan worshiping Native Americans from Salem were massacred and buried there also. Lisa soon sees non-special effects ghosts and the staff doubts her. Oh where is Zelda Rubinstein when we need her? The first 20 minutes of the film is an introduction of the criminally insane patients and the cleaning agents used by the staff...which never played a part in the film. Seriously, Andrew if you are going to spend time telling us what kind of cleaners the hospital uses on different stains, you must bring this full circle and utilize it later on.

It is a low budget production shot in basically one location, light on special effects and action. The film consists mostly of boring dialouge connecting a few boring action scenes. I can't fault Sophia Del Pizzo for her role, she wasn't given much to work with. She didn't let the total lack of talent around her drag her down to their level. Unfortunately the film needed more than actors.

Not recommended viewing. 2 stars for the effort.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. Sex talk.",1384560000,2,1395,4.775933609958506
8625992,1,B00GP382W4,Not even worth 1 star but I had to rate it. Dreadful and boring. Worst movie ever. Don't waste your money like I did. I didn't even watch the whole movie it was that lame. I threw it right in the trash.,1519776000,,202,3.8333333333333335
8625993,3,B00GP382W4,"Here we go again with yet another entry into the franchise that has become synonymous with middle of the road offerings too many times already. That being said, even as a middling entry, this is not the worst Amityville film, but of course it's also far from the best of the lot. Speaking of lots, that's what this one involves. The story goes that the original Amityville house was destroyed and an insane asylum was built on the lot of land. The scares are few and the script is predictable, but there is a gritty, real, almost 'found footage' creepy vibe that propels the film along. For appropriate atmosphere, the filmmakers chose to use minimal lighting for deep murkiness and camera lenses washed in filters to accomplish their goals and it mostly works. The second half gets far more interesting and does so quickly. I just wish there was something that could have surprised me or elevate it to above average status, but in spite of it's better second half, it still only rates a solid but average 3 stars.",1513987200,,1014,4.638888888888889
8625994,4,B00GP382W4,Good show to watch. I liked it because it is part of the Amityville collection.,1488585600,,79,4.333333333333333
8625995,3,B00GP382W4,"I'm an obsessed Amityville fan so I'll even tough out the recent offerings. At first this film seemed like a total bomb but it ended up panning out better than I expected. The dark, claustrophobic vibe of the film works to it's advantage in retrospect and the acting isn't nearly as bad as some of the other recent ""Amityville"" films. Sophia Del Pizzo's good looks sure help out and she doesn't make a bad lead. Once you're pretty deep in the film it does get around to explaining things and delves into the history of 112 Ocean Ave. This one would be enjoyed most by fans of low budget supernatural horror and Amityville gurus.",1480291200,2,628,4.517543859649122
8625996,1,B00GP382W4,"This movie sucked worse than the Broadway show CATS!  It may not have anything to do with the house haunting, but it is a crazy house.",1477008000,,134,4.153846153846154

8626000,1,B00GP382W4,"This sequel does add something new to the series, but nothing that will save thus movie. Terrible script, actors, acting, camera work, plot, etc.  It is very low budget and very boring, although it is much better than the new 2015 Amityville death house, and Amityville haunting",1429056000,,278,4.914893617021277
