6078306,5,B00GIUVHJO,I like to watch closed caption shows and I don't think that hearing it in English would do it justice. I really enjoy Rolf Lassgard and I liked the character of Sebastian Bergman and I hope there will be more.,1398124800,4,209,4.25
6078307,3,B00GIUVHJO,"I am sorry, but this series was disappointing. I am a tremendous fan of Lassgard, particularly his early portrayals of Kurt Wallander. I felt his immense talents and persona were wasted on this character and a rather vapid story line.  Perhaps my expectations were too high.",1396396800,,274,4.956521739130435

6078319,5,B00GIUVHJO,"LOVE Swedish film and TV. if you have not gotten here yet, put your shoes on and get moving! anyone unfamiliar with the Swedish language may find it quite lyrical--i do. but their film and tv are some of the best in creation...Ingmar Bergman; Stellan Skarsgrd (and his talented and beautiful sons)...all Swedes.

this is an interesting and sometimes surprising series; i find american stuff unbearably predictable 98% of the time. their formulas do not follow Hollywood dreck.",1433721600,,476,5.102564102564102

6078322,3,B00GIUVHJO,"Just not wild about it.  The lead character is not one I enjoyed.  May try again, give him another chance",1431907200,,105,4.2
6078323,5,B00GIUVHJO,"This was great.  I can see the comparisons to Wallander- but I thought it was more like Cracker (British mystery)- which also had a dysfunctional detective at the helm.  Sebastian is often engaged in cringe-worthy behavior, but they did give him a motivation that makes you stick with him.  I'm glad I purchased this, as we enjoyed the dramas.",1431388800,2,343,4.779661016949152
6078324,5,B00GIUVHJO,"Well done, with a plausible ending.  The neurotic sleuth is reminiscent of Wallander, who works in an alleged paradise where no one has stable relationships.  Lots of loose ends that stimulate thought about what actually happened.  Quite interesting and taut.",1431302400,,259,5.425

8623625,5,B00GIUVHJO,"Sebastian Bergman: The Cursed One is a 2010 Swedish Two-Part Murder Mystery and Drama from Sveriges Television. The story line of the first part centers on the investigation of the murder of a fifteen-year-old boy, while the second part centers on the investigation of a cluster of murders of young women, which appear to have been committed by a serial killer. The main character is Sebastian Bergman, a renowned criminal profiler, who has been on a downward spiral after the devastating deaths of his wife and young daughter several years earlier in Thailand, as a result of the catastrophic 2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake and Tsunami. He is no longer actively working as a profiler, due to the fact that he has essentially been paralyzed by his overwhelming grief and guilt subsequent to the tragedy, especially because he was not able to save his daughter, who was literally swept out of his arms by the powerful Tsunami wave. While not exactly a paragon of virtue and integrity, Sebastian Bergman has enough insight to realize that he needs to restore purpose to his life, and that resuming his vocation as a police profiler, would give him the relevance and sense of self-worth that he has been lacking for so long. Unfortunately, his former colleague, who is now the head of the Swedish National Homicide Division, is very reluctant to welcome Sebastian Bergman back into police service, and have him consult on challenging murder cases, because of his past misdeeds. However, it soon becomes apparent that Sebastian Bergman is still a brilliant profiler, who is highly observant, perceptive, and analytical, and who has keen instincts, along with an uncanny ability to get into the mind of the killer, and to anticipate and preempt his next move. Sebastian Bergman: The Cursed One is characterized by great writing and plot development, as well as exceptional acting performances. The incomparable Rolf Lassgard is truly outstanding with his perfect portrayal of Sebastian Bergman, and his stellar performance reminds Swedish crime drama enthusiasts that he was the first actor to play the Henning Mankell lead character, Detective Kurt Wallander, and probably the best. Sebastian Bergman: The Cursed One is an excellent Swedish murder mystery and drama, which is decidedly gripping, suspenseful, and entertaining, and which merits a five-star rating, along with an enthusiastic recommendation.",1505088000,,2400,5.22020725388601
8623626,2,B00GIUVHJO,"Very disappointing. A camera that rarely stops moving: jumpy, shaking, waving from one character to the next - extremely irritating, making it difficult to connect at any level w/what is going on. Contrary to what some filmmakers believe, this does not approximate, or enhance, reality.
Additionally the script is mediocre and predictable, unlike quite a bit of good work coming out of the Scandinavian countries. I purchased this series (watched only the first episode) because of the fine, nuanced acting of Rolf Lassgard I have experienced elsewhere. Sadly, his skills are interfered with here.",1485820800,,597,5.361702127659575
8623627,4,B00GIUVHJO,Very exciting crime investigation,1485129600,,33,7.5
8623628,3,B00GIUVHJO,I love Rolf Lassgrd. Who doesn't? But why do these shows have to be so graphically violent?,1471132800,,91,4.411764705882353
8623629,5,B00GIUVHJO,Very enjoyable series. I would have loved more than 2 series though,1469318400,,67,4.666666666666667

8623632,1,B00GIUVHJO,"Sebastian Bergman is one of the most despicable human beings ever - I am sad that I wasted 3 hours of my life watching these movies

Tell me what woman would ever find this arrogant slop attractive - cant figure it - totally unreal",1451692800,,231,4.25
8623633,5,B00GIUVHJO,"Rolf Lassgard, who played Kurt Wallander, is superb as Sebastian Bergman, a brilliant but broken forensic psychologist. Bergman made a name for himself as a successful criminal profiler, but after the death of his wife and daughter he went off the deep end, and dove into alcohol and one-night stands. He is not a lovable guy going through a rough patch, he's a total scumbag who uses people and betrays them without a thought, the guy you wish you'd never met. Now he uses his brilliant insights to eviscerate people who annoy him, which is just about everybody. Like Britain's Cracker, Bergman is fascinating to watch, but you wouldn't want to know him.

This dvd set contains two episodes for a total of three hours viewing. The first episode corresponds to the book Sebastian Bergman, and introduces us to Bergman as well as Police Chief Inspector Torkel Hoglund and his team, the people who were Bergman's colleagues before he became lost. When he runs into his old friend and discovers there is a serial killer on the loose, Sebastian blackmails his ex-boss to get back on the team -- for his own nefarious purposes, of course. The team is investigating the murder of a 15-year old boy and Bergman, while being a total jerk and a misery to work with, lends crucial insights that lead to the killer.

The second episode corresponds to the second book in the series, The Man Who Watched Women. Here Sebastian is trying half heartedly to mend his ways, but usually inappropriately, sabotaging himself and everyone around him. Again he insinuates himself onto the team. This time a serial killer seems to be imitating the crimes of Edward Hinde, the killer Sebastian helped capture when he was at his peak and the case that made Sebastian famous.

The episodes hew closely to the books and are quite enjoyable, so whether you want to read or view, this series might be of interest. Set in Sweden.",1446422400,,1898,4.745454545454545
8623634,1,B00GIUVHJO,"I normally really enjoy these Swedish crime shows Wallander, series and movies are top notch. The Bridge is one of my all time favorites. But this archetype of the grizzled, alcoholic, emotionally troubled cop type is overdone to the nth degree in this. The plot is old, often used, and the acting is strained. I was thoroughly disappointed, especially at the price point.",1445904000,2,372,4.920634920634921
