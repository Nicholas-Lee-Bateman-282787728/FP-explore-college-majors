4364275,3,B004EPYZOE,"The power of finiancial gain compels you! (yawn)  Another serving of exorcisms the whole family can enjoy, yee-haw.  The wife dragged me to see The Rite, and it wasn't totally wrong I suppose.  I'll keep this demonically short and sweet.

It's another intriguing question of faith--an interesting examination of mental instability vs. demonic possession.  We get to see a young pregnant chick speak in a crazy voice and watch her body distort in unnatural positions.  Freaky for some, but you've probably seen it done before in a much more gruesome, intense fashion.  An actual possession would of course be a terrifying thing to witness, but here the battle of good vs. evil never really seems to materialize.  We witness Baal throwing out a few dark personal secrets while the priests toss back some holy water, but it stops well short of the horror element it could have registered.

This movie has some irritating elements--a few cheap jump scares that might work on some but they fiercely grate on my nerves.  The dream sequences are an overdone gimmick as well.  We also witness a demonic mule and some hellacious frogs that I thought were pretty silly.

Now for the good.  Anthony Hopkins totally saves this film from complete disaster.  He has creepy down pat, and he definitely electrifies the screen with his presence.

This movie does have some nice cinematography plus solid acting throughout.  Overall I enjoyed The Last Exorcism quite a bit more than this.  But for the young crowd or fans Of Hopkins, The Rite might very well be worth a look.  2.5 stars.",1296345600,6,1569,4.856603773584905
4364276,3,B004EPYZOE,"The Rite looked like it would be a mixed bag right from the start. The film seemed to suffer the same fate many other films before it fell victim to and that's giving away too much of the storyline in the trailers. On top of that, it was a film that revolved around exorcism which is a subject that usually leads to disappointing results. Expectations would lead one to believe that The Rite would have enough momentum to reel you in only to drop the ball during its finale similar to last year's The Last Exorcism (except hopefully without the appearance of a neon red, glow in the dark fetus). Luckily, the film has a few surprises up its sleeve.

The cinematography in the film is probably the first thing you'll notice visually. The opening of the film makes things like dripping embalming fluid, a swing set on a playground, and an overturned shopping cart seem more interesting than they really are. Rain is an element used fairly often in the film to usually signify when something has gone wrong or is about to. Whether the camera is placed up high to make it seem like you're looking down on the cast from the heavens or down low as if you're looking up at them from the depths of the earth, the rain sequences in the film are definitely some of the most memorable due to the camera work.

This is probably a pretty obvious statement, but the film is worth seeing for Anthony Hopkins alone. It's not that Colin O'Donoghue does poorly since he certainly has a strong screen presence and does a fantastic job carrying the film, but Hopkins just manages to trump that while stealing every scene he's in and rightfully so. Father Lucas Trevant is the strongest and creepiest role Hopkins has played since Hannibal Lecter and his best role overall in years. It's just amazing seeing a man in his seventies give a performance that's this physical and this absorbing. Speaking of distinguished actors, it was nice seeing Rutger Hauer as well even if it was just for a small role.

The dream sequences and hallucinations in the film may have been my hands down favorite. I've always been a fan of the surreal, the imaginative, the creative, and the things that don't seem to make sense at first but gain meaning as the film or story progresses. I never thought I'd find myself intrigued with the actions of a mule or that frogs could have an even deeper meaning than what you're probably expecting, but The Rite accomplishes this very well.

Thankfully, The Rite delivers an exorcism film that is actually worth seeing. It'll probably be forgotten about in a year filled with so many blockbuster film releases, but considering that January and February are usually filled with such monstrous duds at the box office The Rite manages to surpass expectations. While the film does seem rather reminiscent of The Last Exorcism and borrows the atmosphere from the Heath Ledger film The Order, The Rite is actually a better experience overall. With an engrossing performance by Anthony Hopkins along with a fairly strong cast all around, its fantastic cinematography, surreal dream sequences, and a satisfying conclusion that doesn't hint at a sequel, The Rite is actually a surprisingly decent film all around.",1296086400,111,3205,4.738351254480286

This is based off of real life events, though of course details have been changed. The thing I really enjoyed about it is that, while you can obviously feel the tension, it's not gripping you so hard you forget how to breathe.

4364316,2,B004EPYZOE,"As a film of horror, it has its moments, which only a seasoned actor like Hopkins can deliver. But for anyone who has read the non-fiction book on which this film is based, expect to see a very twisted and opportunistic plot unfold. Author Matt Baglio shadowed a Californian priest who eventually trained under a prominent Vatican trained exorcist in Italy. Neither that priest nor exorcist suffered from intense doubts about their faith, much less devolving into possession. In its earnest effort to repeat the commercial success of The Exorcist, the film producers have succeeded in calling into question the moral integrity of those in the Roman Catholic Church who administer to the afflicted and possessed. That alone I find offensive but perhaps you won't. Just remember that you are watching pseudo-reality, as with William Peter Blatty's adaptation to a horror novel of an actual possession decades before which led to The Exorcist.",1501804800,,940,5.150326797385621
4364327,1,B004EPYZOE,"Ouch!  Save your money and time.
My qualification for rating this movie one star is my 30 year study of Spiritual Warfare/Demonology.  The movie is based on the book of the same name by Matt Baglio, which is based on real people and events.

Let's get our definitions straight:
""Demon"" is a fallen angel, disloyal to God, a subordinate of Satan.  They are intelligent spirits without a body.  All are evil and have varying powers.  They hate God, the Heavenly Host and Humankind.
""Possession"" is when a demon is able to influence the body and mind of a human person whenever they want.  Many are very hard to exorcise from a human person and much work and prayer (and fasting) is needed.
""Exorcism"" is running the demon(s) out of a human person by an authorized priest using the authorized Ritual (""Rite"")  of prayer.  Sometimes it can happen almost right away, sometimes it takes years of sessions with really tough demons.

While the young priest in the book had a  way to go to strength his faith, the movie young priest didn't seem to know why he was a new priest, much less have faith in his God!  As such, a very poor candidate for exorcist, as you need very strong faith and belief in God and Jesus Christ, and no unforgiven sin on your soul (otherwise the demons will just tell you to  get lost, or hurt you as in the Bible).

The first third of the movie  roughly follows the book, but then goes off on a tangent all its own.  the rest of the screenplay seems to have been done by a non-Christian or an Antichristian.  Many scenes in the movie are not in the book and digress from the theme or are there only for sensational effect, such as the singular case of a young, possessed woman being pregnant by her father, and dying in abject suffering near the end.

The worst part of the movie is the Master Exorcist (Anthony Hopkins), Fr. Candido in the book, becoming possessed himself, hitting a little girl, and looking like some kind of monster, while our apprentice neophyte priest exorcises him.  Garbage!!  Never happened in the book!  This is serious stuff and not to be diddled with.  Again, not recommended.  Save your money.

4364333,5,B004EPYZOE,"The ""Based on a true story"" is a bit of a misnomer. It is really nothing like the book by the same name of which it was based other than there are priests involved. That said, it's an excellent, well done thriller that keeps it believable instead of going with heads turning 360 degrees, and pea soup. If you talk to any exorcist in the Catholic Church, they will tell you that this is very close to the real deal.

Sir Anthony Hopkins is a brilliant actor and he shows so much depth in his role as Father Lucas... Colin O'Donoghue really does a great job with the angst and rebirth of Father Michael. It is an excellent movie that will chill you to the bone despite lack of Hollywood CGI. After, I recommend reading the book it was based on. The book is actually written by the exorcist that Father Michael was based on, and discusses the topic in a way everyone can understand to get a better feeling as for what an exorcist is, what they do, and why it's needed even in modern times.",1491868800,4,986,4.2727272727272725

4364336,5,B004EPYZOE,"I loved this movie based on the experieces of a real life modern day excorcist and very informative and excellent lecturer from California.  I watched this movie bc as a nurse an empath and having questioned my faith and having been on the threshold of both life and death as a hospice nurse and growing up Roman Catholic, and being a product of Catholic education through the early 80s to my highschool education in 1995, I was rebelling against the conservatism of my upbringing...  I have recently realized the truth in my life and that I was very misguided bby new age movement although only dabbling..  Through prayer and suffering through oppression and in my depression I came across a Roman Catholic site b Sensus Fidelium and I listened to the lectures especially of two modern day priests and excorcists one of whom tis movie is based upon..  I have much work to do but this website has opened my eyes to much and helped me immensely to understand many circumstances in my life, how I invited them and what I must do through prayer to overcome  The most important is believing in the existence of the Devil, demons and Evil in modern day society.  This unbelief is a trap to get souls..  I am no religious zelot, but through many spiritual coincidences and through my prayers to Our Lady and Holy Trinity I believe I found the website and this movie takes the teachings of the Roman Catholic American priests full circle in a very real way  MUst watch and not Hollywood hocus pocus  highly recommend it to all esp Catholics suffering through spiritual oression and storms  .....5 stars",1483833600,7,1595,4.664285714285715

4364383,5,B004EPYZOE,"Now this is what you call HORROR!!!  - I loved Anthony's Hopkins role in it :)

***Spoiler Alert***

Michael, is a mortician but he wants to do something better with his life. He enrolls to study at a seminary school but his main objective is to obtain a college degree for free - he decides to renounce his vows when his studies are completed. Four years later, he writes a letter to his superior Father Matthew, telling him that he wishes to resign due to his lack of faith.

Father Matthew tries to talk to him on the street, but there is an accident and a young girl is seriously injured. She sees Michael's clerical garb and asks him to absolve her of her sins. He cannot bring himself to refuse her so he performs her last rights and absolves her of her sins, as she takes her last breath.

Father Matthew sees this and tells Michael that he cannot accept his resignation. He wants to send him to the Vatican in Rome, to attend an exorcism class. He tells Michael that it will help pay off his study loans. Michael agrees because Father Matthew tells him that he can resign afterward, if he wishes.

Michael works closely with Father Lucas and they attend to the exorcism of a young girl. There is a jaw-dropping twist but you have to see it for yourself!!!

It keeps you at the edge of your seat, gripping suspense, nail-biting scenes, causes goosebumps - overall, it is worth your money! One of my favourite movies of all time!!!

Father Glas and other renowned exorcists (Fr. Amorth, Fr. Pereira, Fr. Bashobora) have reported that many of today's problems result from the lack of faith. People do not believe in God. They also say that the devil doesn't exist. They think, just like the young priest in the movie did, that satan is not real.

it is a mental illness the church has managed to insert itself into.  The goal of the priest seems to be to get the ""possessed"" one to

Fictional in the sense that Michael is a deacon, not a priest yet, when he performs exorcisms. Deacons lack the necessary authority to perform exorcisms and also the power is lacking since the power is granted though ordination to the priesthood and at ordination. Of course God can grant power to whomever he wants, but God usually doesn't revert the order he himself established. I love the movie because it shows the reality of the devil still very active in the world and shows succinctly the hate and vile that the devil and his minions have towards God and his creatures, particularly human beings since we are made in the image of God. He hates the God he sees in us and so hate us to death. It is then so true that ultimately Satan wants all of us to commit suicide since he even doesn't have the power to take lives although he took Rosalias life somehow and that's because Rosalias dad had turned her over to satan by a curse. Overal the movie is good although the director took liberties in terms of the main character and his relation to the priesthood of Jesus Christ.",1444435200,,1179,4.488372093023256

4364626,1,B004EPYZOE,"This movie wants so badly to be taken seriously. It's loaded to the gills with signs of prestige, from the casting of Anthony Hopkins to the carefully selected on location shots that show you the tantalizing hints of ancient times strewn all about Florence. But it's all so flat. I'm not just talking about the deathly slow pacing, but just the general lack of any character who seems really motivated to do anything. You get the feeling that our hero, the young priest Michael (Colin O'Donohugh), is just sort of following up on this demonic possession thing because he doesn't have anything else particularly going on. The main impetus for his journey in this movie seems to be getting out of paying student loans. There's even a scene where a couple of characters are like, ""Well, we could wait for a real exorcist to get here, but that would take all weekend, so I guess we've gotta do it ourselves.""

The most depressing thing is Anthony Hopkins. Few other actors respond to and do justice to great writing than he does, but he's given so little here to work with that he just becomes this piece of ballast, using his famous gravitas to keep the movie from toppling over in the weakest tides like the flimsy balsa wood construction it is.

This is a movie you watch as opposed to a movie that grabs you and sucks you in. It manages to convey that Michael sees visions which are supposed to be deeply personal to him because they deal with his father and his mother, but the way O'Donohugh plays Michael it all just gets taken in stride.

I love movies about exorcism and possession when they work. They can be sleazy treats like Devil's Seed or they can be dead serious pieces of art that explore the dark side, like Daylight. This movie seems only to explore the dim side. Don't bother.",1435017600,3,1792,4.541795665634675
4364627,5,B004EPYZOE,I was actually quite surprised that this movie was able to send chills through my body. I thought it would be like every other possession movie where nothing happens and it drags but this movie was good.,1434758400,,203,4.513513513513513
4364628,3,B004EPYZOE,"""Choosing not to believe in the devil won't protect you from him.""

In 1973 filmmakers claimed they based ""The Exorcist"" on true events.  A few years later, filmmakers claimed they based ""The Amityville Horror"" on true events.  In 2011, filmmakers claimed they based ""The Rite"" on true events.  OK, ""inspired by true events,"" to be exact.  Draw your own conclusions.

And why is it always the Catholic Church that gets drawn into these things?  Why don't we ever hear about, say, a Southern Baptist preacher or a Methodist minister or a Mormon Elder or a Jewish Rabbi or a Hindu monk chasing after demons and devils?  It's almost a clich nowadays that any time a movie deals with demonic possession, they have to call in a Catholic priest to do the exorcism.  Doesn't anybody else believe in this stuff?  Is no other church up to snuff in the exorcism department?  I dunno.  Just asking.

So, in this one Anthony Hopkins, no less, plays the Church's leading exorcist, Father Lucas Trevane.  A favorite of the Vatican, he works out of Rome, he's that important, having performed thousands of exorcisms in his lifetime.  But we don't meet Father Lucas for quite a while into the film.  Although he is the center of attention when he's on screen, the story is really about a young man training for the priesthood and training to be an exorcist, Michael Kovak (Colin O'Donoghue).  If the film had concentrated more on Father Lucas, it might have improved things.

As it is, we get a movie about Michael.  We see his youth, the death of his mother, and his going into the family mortuary business at a young age.  Interestingly, Rutger Hauer plays Michael's father in a role all too brief.  Anyway, we also learn that the males in the Kovak family either go into the mortuary business or become priests.  After finding the mortuary business rather depressing, Michael chooses to become a priest, even though he's not all that convinced he wants to be one.

After four years in a seminary, Michael is about to take his vows when more doubts set in.  Michael's mentor at the seminary, Father Matthew (Tobey Jones), persuades him to try his hand at becoming an exorcist for the Church.  It seems that demonic possession is on the rise, and the Church needs more trained exorcists.  Besides, it means a free trip to Rome for the course, so Michael agrees.

Once there he meets Father Lucas (Hopkins), the Church's most-experienced exorcist, who agrees to help teach him, along with the Church's official Vatican courses in the subject.  Michael is still skeptical, questioning not only the validity of exorcism but the legitimacy of Father Lucas and his methods.  Frankly, he thinks Father Lucas is a fraud.

The story involves Michael, Father Lucas, and an investigative journalist Michael meets, Angelina Vargas (Alice Braga) as they pursue various supposed exorcisms.  Fair enough, but it's not exactly the kind of material around which to build an entire movie, being too thin in its approach.

The film is a little creepy, I'll admit, but it's not particularly scary.  Nor did the filmmakers intend it as a horror film.  That's the thing:  The trailers and the posters and the promotion for the movie make it seem like another ""Exorcist.""  It isn't.  You'll find no swiveling heads or green vomit here, although there are a few scenes that stretch credibility by going in that direction.

However, Hopkins is really quite good in the part.  His character takes almost everything in stride, at least until late in the film, making him almost comical.  Later, even his character begins to doubt his faith.  Hopkins dominates every scene he's in and almost makes the movie worthwhile; he just doesn't have enough to do to make us care about him or the story.

Mikael Hafstrom (""Vendetta,"" ""Derailed,"" ""1048"") directs a screenplay by Michael Petroni ""suggested"" by a book by Matt Baglio.  The filmmakers valiantly attempt to explain Michael's dilemma as a doubter, and by the movie's second half it does get quite a bit more intense as various inexplicable events beset the character.  The main problem is that we have already seen too many movies exploring the theme of a priest questioning his faith, and ""The Rite"" adds nothing new to the game.  Another problem is that the filmmakers want it both ways:  They want to produce a film that looks and feels entirely authentic, yet one that combines elements of standard horror.  It doesn't work.

Worse, ""The Rite"" is slow and often tedious getting to its point.  In an epilogue we learn that the phrase ""inspired by true events"" that opens the movie really means ""fictional.""  As long as the filmmakers were creating a fiction, maybe they shouldn't have tried so hard to make it seem real, while not convincing us it was anything but nonsense.  I'm more for the swiveling heads and green vomit.

Video:
Warner engineers do a good job transferring the movie to Blu-ray disc, using a dual-layer BD50 and MPEG-4/AVC encoding to reproduce it in its native aspect ratio, 2.40:1.  The picture looks beautiful, sharp and crisp, with colors natural and lifelike.  Solid black levels set off the hues well, emphasizing the fine delineation in the process.

Audio:
Using lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, the disc sounds almost as good as it looks, especially in the front channels.  The sonics are clear and clean, the midrange well focused, the highs extended, the bass and dynamics more than adequate.  There is not as much surround activity as one would expect from this kind of movie, though, mostly musical-ambience bloom with occasional side and rear-channel noises.  Still, I'm sure the audio track does whatever it needs to do in replicating the movie experience.

Extras:
The extras begin with a short featurette, ""The Rite:  Soldier of God,"" about seven minutes on the real-life priest who inspired the book; it's the story behind the story and also takes us to the real exorcism school in Rome.  Next, there's a brief alternate ending, which is spookier than the one finally used in the movie but cornier as well.  Then, there are several deleted scenes totaling about a dozen minutes.

The regular extras conclude with twelve scene selections; a gauge for expired time; BD-Live access;
English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese spoken languages; French, Spanish, and Portuguese subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.  A flimsy Eco-case holds everything, the case further enclosed by a light-cardboard slipcover.

Finally, since this is a Blu-ray Combo edition, it contains the feature film on high-definition Blu-ray disc, on standard-definition DVD, and on digital copy (the offer expiring May 15, 2012).

4364669,5,B004EPYZOE,"The Rite
 The Rite of the title is the Holy Rite of Exorcism, the driving out of demons from the body of a human victim.  The very idea seems old fashioned to many moderns.  This rite is none the less still practiced by the Catholic Church even in this day and age.  In fact, the Vatican receives some half a million requests for this rite to be practiced every year.  The film very creepily and realistically shows a young American priests introduction to the practice during his training in Rome.  It will scare your pants off.
 Director Mikael Hafstrom is most noted for his very successful thriller, 1408.  He is equally successful with The Rite.  He does without some of the more extreme special effects of this kind of movie but still manages to chill us to the very bone.
 Anthony Hopkins of course occupies the stage to the exclusion of any other actors in the scene.  He portrays an elderly priest who acts as one of the few active duty exorcists in the Church.  He lives in Rome, where our apprentice exorcist (Colin ODonoghue) encounters him.  There is enough ambiguity in the relationship to make it interesting.  There can be no ambiguity about the scenes involving the actual possession.  Burrr.
 Screen veterans Rutger Hauer and Ciaran Hinds provide expert supporting roles as the young priests scary mortician father and worldly classroom exorcism instructor respectively.
 The acting of Hopkins pulls this otherwise ordinary film into the better than most range.  The PG-13 film garners a full tree and a half saw blades.  It runs an average one hour and 52 minutes.  The modest budget of $37 million seems sure to make good on the investment.  It opened at number one at the box office.

If you would like to keep it for watching with family try purified pictures they do an excellent job of cleaning it up for you.
Alright, so what do I think of the movie? It was well done, had great acting, and was easy to follow. As a non-Protestant (Southern Baptist) theology major, however, I could not help thinking how the Catholics in the movie, which was based on true events, were really being deceived by such demonic manifestations. I say this because Roman Catholicism is replete with heresies, unbiblical teachings concerning salvation, Mary worship, superstitions; and its own grandiose claim to be the only true church that has the right and authority to dispense the grace of God. So, as I viewed the movie, I could not help wondering how brilliant the demonic realm really might be. All demonic forces would have to do is manifest a ""possession"" only to have the ""authority"" of the Roman Catholic Church appear to cast out the evil spirits. All the demons would have to do is play their part and become silent after an exorcism--leading the Catholics, and others, to think that it was successful. This would serve to convince people that the Roman Catholic Church has the authority that it claims. In turn, this would further propagate the false religion of Roman Catholicism. Is such a thing possible? Yes, it is.
""Many will say to Me on that day, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name perform many miracles? 23 And then I will declare to them, I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice. lawlessness."" (Matt. 7:22-23).
Notice how Jesus Himself says that there will be people who will cast out demons in His name, but were never Christians: ""I never knew you.""
I found myself wondering if my assessment was correct. Who am I to say what can and cannot be done in an exorcism? I've never performed one. I have encountered two men what thought was demon possession  people in a prison ministry. What did I do? I lead them to Christ no formulas. But, I found myself returning again and again to what the Scriptures actually say. I know that the Roman Catholic Church is false because of its many unbiblical teachings in critical areas. I also know that the Roman Catholic Church claims success at exorcisms. Therefore, because I seek to be true to the word of God, I conclude that in spite of all the appearances of successful exorcism, what might be really happening is the demons are playing along to further the great deception found in the Roman Catholic Church.

The only biblical way to help those under possession is to lead the person to Christ. It is the power of the gospel that they find freedom like everyone else not some ritual that talks to the demons to win an argument with them.",1421193600,,3200,4.7125

This is only one of many incidents that have been,made into movies about true events-- The Hollywood movie ""The Exorcist"" was made based on true events that really happened only it was a young boy not girl as they portrayed it--The movie documentary is called  IN THE GRIP OF EVIL--Our church showed this to junior high kids around Halloween time, and two boys came up to their teacher after class very nervous and said--We need to go to confession as soon as possible-- we've been messing around with a wheegy board!  It frightened them into the reality of what they were playing with which was dangerous fire!  It really pulls ones head out of the closet into the light of whats happening to us today--Evil is everywhere (but so is goodness) but to not warn our kids and educate ourselves about the spiritual cancer that's eating us alive today, is pure negligence on our part as adults and teachers of faith- If there is not an evil out there-- then ""why"" do we ""need"" a Savior?

The whole question of faith, and the role of the devil in it - which is central to the film plot - is not intelligently presented. There is also no intelligent explanation of possession given, nor are the representations of possession realistically represented (mules with red eyes? animal snarls and growls?). Over all, an amateurish screenplay. The directing is well done, with many nice shots, and Anthony Hopkins gives a decent performance.

Too bad the writers couldn't or wouldn't formulate a new angle and add a new perspective to this popular subject matter with more depth and dimension. Anthony Hopkins always renders a solid and reliably satisfying performance as does Ciaran Hinds; both consummate actors, true masters of their craft.

In today's world, exorcism displays worst kind of spiritual frivolity than ever before, and the movie is no less frivolous. And yet neither Vatican nor Hollywood is confining 'exorcism' behind the closet!

Apart from anything else, can't restrain myself from mentioning the disgraceful caricature by 'formidable' Anthony Hopkins, when his character was possessed by Ba'al.

I heard that the ""Great"" Gabriele Amorth introduced this movie in a film festival in Umbria. Amorth is well known for his distaste towards the other religious schools (eastern religions in particular). In terms of intolerance, Amorth is perhaps closer to the deadly seven demons, against whom he has battled throughout his life.

4364836,3,B004EPYZOE,"How long will Hollywood keep doing the same thing over and over again? In the movie, The Rite, Anthony
Hopkins plays a priest who is one of the few practicing exorcism. What is the difference between a person
truly possessed and a person who is mentally unstable and faking the possession? So goes the debate
among students studying at the Vatican. Hopkins is one of those priests.
Of course most of the film is set in Italy, but we could have the plot unfold in any small town in America,
although it does add some mystery when using Latin and dual linguistics from Italian characters who are
mostly representatives of the Catholic Church or children from local villages. But if you erase all foreign
factors youd get a mix of Sixth Sense and good old-fashioned Exorcist.
The storyline is executed reasonably well (sort of a pun there) with a few catchy spots of dialogue and music
that works with cinematography that exploits dark settings, remote locations, and certainly candlelight. And
the cinematographer, Ben Davis (best known for his work on Kick-Ass) made a great transformation of
what was described by my friend as Italian renaissance art to film. The dark tones are contrasted with
illuminated facessimilar to Rembrandt or Caravaggio.
With all of that said, the plot does weave on and off subject a lot. And the special effects, while in some
places were perfect for the mood and moment, were sometimes overwhelming and distracting. Hopkins
was  well good. His face was the perfect playground for puffed veins, black skin, pupil-less eyes (not
trying to give away too much of the plot here)! Still, sometimes the special effects of mystic energies
layered on one after another.
The final moments of the film seem to indicate that the producers are hoping for a sequence. I think the
lackluster acceptance of this film (both in reviews and by the empty theater that I saw it in) will prevent this.
And really do we need this next step? Exorcisms require faith. We got the idea.",1408406400,,1989,4.815789473684211
4364837,2,B004EPYZOE,"The biggest scheme the Devil ever pulled was the trailer to The Rite. It sure looked promising, but the film never really delivered. Perhaps I shouldn't have been surprised, since the concept is terribly unrealistic to begin with!

An atheist-sceptic trains for the Catholic priesthood (despite not believing an iota of the Bible and Tradition), and ends up at an exorcist course in Rome, where he befriends a devil-possessed exorcist, portrayed by Anthony Hopkins (OK, he was perfect for the part). After some supernatural haunting, including by a red-eyed mule (!), the sceptic becomes a priest-for-real, while the Devil presumably retreats into the woodworks. And yes, cats really are on the wrong side of the eternal battle.

The plot holes are obvious, the film is dragging, some twists are never explored in depth (what about the investigative reporter infiltrating the exorcist course?), and the horror scenes just aren't scary enough. But sure, it's interesting that The Rite seems to be relative positive towards Catholicism and exorcism, compared to The Da Vinci Code and other blockbusters.

4364886,4,B004EPYZOE,"It is a reminder for Catholics like myself that evil has a face and that is verified not by just this movie, but by the writings of many saints, including our contemporary writers like the late Fr. Malachi Martin OSJ (Jesuits) and by Vatican chief exorcist Gabielle Amorth.
Evil has a real face but often operates unseen, through places, people, animals, things. This may be too much for many modern thinking types in the modern world of psychiatric medicine and diagnosis of schizophrenia, psychosis, etc.
To frame all this within a timeline, we are living in the end times and the shadow of the 100 anniversary of Fatima and its secrets. October 13th 2017 is the said anniversary.
I was impressed only because of my interest in the subject and would have given it possible 3 stars except for Anthony Hopkins usual superior acting, where in his understated way, he manages to steal every scene, even with the softest phrase from his eloquent lips. The special effects were well done and from my readings of exorcisms (real ones), there is incredible poltergeist activities, superhuman strength, and in rare, rare instances of levitation (just like the 1972 movie the exorcist.)
I recommend this film not as a horror film but as a template for anyone thinking of assisting at a exorcist, to make them realize this is for real, not to be taken trivially.",1395360000,3,1353,4.8111587982832615

In the tradition of The Exorcist, this deals with occult subjects that the Christian Church didn't want published and now for some reason, they are allowing it. Maybe to tell people that it's about to become far more widespread? I know the ancient legends and from what I know, that would be one very good reason. Teaching people about what's to come might prepare them for the VERY ACCURATE depictions of demon-possession. Very real, very scary. Maybe this is to test your faith?",1392336000,,650,4.8125

I loved the story(truthfully I only write about the stories I love or like or completely suck).  The plot was easy to follow.  Both the story and Anthony Hopkins' performance deserved a five but Colin O'Donoghue's performance was thin and since he's the main character I summoned up a four.  His acting wasn't painful but with the clearly complex character that he had been given he missed the mark.  His performance was mediocre.  Anthony Hopkins gave a stellar performance as always.  By the end of the movie he made the hair stand up on my arms and sent chills down my spine.  When it was finished it was my bed time.

4364922,5,B004EPYZOE,"I enjoyed every minute of this film. Led by Anthony Hopkins at the top of his game, the cast brought a good plot to life, which argues for the quality of the Director and writers, of course. I found nothing in it that required being anything in particular religiously nor having any particular view on God, the Devil or the value of exorcists as opposed to psychiatrists. From my viewpoint, which matters little to anyone else, and not much to me, since it is not an area in which I have any particular current knowledge, it is likely that psychiatrists have people with whom they succeed (however defined) and people with whom they fail; the same is probably true of exorcists, however they may define success and failure. Whether their successes are due to having brought the patient to understand and overcome the source of his/her problems or are due to having driven or not driven the Devil out, is not a matter which weighed on me for the duration of the film. Obviously, if these are matters which arouse strong feelings in you, then, depending on whether you agree or disagree with the outlook of the film, you will or will not be able to watch with sufficient control of your emotions,  to enjoy it as a movie.",1374364800,,1219,4.566210045662101

Ultimately, exorcist succumbs to the devil himself and is exorcised by the now-I-believe American.  Hopkins' performance is sluggish and mostly devoid of his eyes, his best physical characteristic, until he becomes possessed.

This is a top notch film with the always excellent Anthony Hopkins, who once again acts his ass off! He takes this movie from a boring first half hour to excitement the rest of the way through. Not because there are a landslide of explosive special effects, but because his acting is an open pit of roaring flames! He is passionate and believable. This film deals with demon possession to a level of frightening belief. The film boasts based on true events, and always with that boast, I'm sure there is a boat load of untruth... However, being that I am of faith, there is plenty here to agree with and come away thinking and pondering my faith and lack thereof in the end.

I watched The Exorcist again after The Rite & it also builds very slowly - have people forgotten? fifteen minutes or more in Iraq - the mother making a film with student protestors - an estranged father who forgets his child's birthday - the priests's mother - medical tests - on and on and on - a long time before the high velocity scenes kick in. The Rite is not a possession horror flick but it has plenty of suspense and horror before all is said and done. It's also more theological & philosophical than other possession films - the addition of a young priest even more skeptical than Damien Karras was a great bit of casting. This is a worthy film & the book being somewhat different I recommend it too. Hitchcock would have liked this film - it has excellent F/X but it relies more on suspense than special effects. And, btw, The Exorcist could use an upgrade in the F/X used on Regan's face. And for those who say Hopkins saved The Rite, well, The Exorcist had a raft of good actors, but without Ellen Burstyn's utter believability as a mother whose world is literally going to hell it would never have worked half so well. The Rite deserves better reviews than the many 1s & 2s & 3s here. A solid 4 from me & I'd like to see a longer D's Cut version. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  ****",1344211200,2,1463,4.300724637681159

Unlike The Passion of the Christ, The Rite is not a powerful film. Unlike The Passion of the Christ, I feel The Rite could have been much better with a little more attention to detail. Attention to plot, for example. Since I'm engaging in rampant similes in this review, here's another: The Rite is similar to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gladiator/dp/B005DNO7MQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gladiator</a>&nbsp;with Russell Crowe in that both films really hang upon the outstanding performances of the lead characters: here, Anthony Hopkins. Anthony Hopkins is superb in this film. Without Sir Anthony, this film would merit a single star.

A good enough film, such as it is, though the cinematic bucket certainly sprung a leak. It could've been much much better. I don't recommend this flick.",1342396800,,1583,5.878260869565217
4365037,4,B004EPYZOE,"I had this film recommended to me by an apologist I like, and honestly, I can see why he liked it so much.  It's a nice, strong, faithful Catholic horror movie about the rite of exorcism.

First let me say that this movie is not for the squeamish.  It is a genuine horror movie, and contains genuinely-horrific scenes and imagery, made all the more horrific by the fact that, unlike over-the-top horror movies like ""Exorcist"" or ""The Shining,"" there's no excessive fixation on advanced graphics, dynamic visual sights or impossible contortions on the part of those possessed.

This film contains most things that people find objectionable.  Violent, demonic behavior, hate-filled exchanges between characters, the suffering of the innocent, blood, sexual innuendos and the most offensive curses (as near as I can tell) in our language.  Rest assured, this film is for those with strong stomachs only.  In fact, just to be on the safe side, I'd treat this film as though it were rated R, if I were you.

That having been said, I loved it.

A young seminarian named Michael, who only really joined the seminary to get away from his father, is sent to Rome for training on how to become an exorcist.  While there, he makes the acquaintence of an older priest named Father Lucas (played wonderfully by Anthony Hopkins,) who knows how the whole exorcism thing is done.  The two attend some exorcisms together, but Michael remains skeptical, until someone dies, and he begins to see visions himself; and realizes that someone new has been possessed.

The role of faith in the job of an exorcist is underscored throughout the whole second half of the movie, as is the reality of Satan and evil, and all of this plays into the final confrontation between the aspiring young exorcist and his enemy.

This film distinguishes itself by not only making the Catholic Church the good guys, but doing it in a realistic and sober way.  As I said, the toning down of the visuals usually popular in exorcism films is both more real and more terrifying than if they'd been included, and it hits much closer to home as a result of that.  The film ultimately ends on a high note; with the validation of sin, of the concept of the state of grace, and the importance of the sacrament of confession in maintaining it.

I can perfectly understand if horror movies aren't your cup of tea.  Most very religious people don't, as a rule, like them, and vice versa, but as a religious person myself, and a thoroughly non-squeamish person, I think this is one of the finest horror movies I've ever seen, from both a religious and moviegoing perspective.  It's not afraid to slap skepticism across the face, it doesn't take things easy on you, and it validates the beliefs of Catholicism in the process.  It was very intense, but also very good.",1342137600,2,2813,4.727459016393443

4365041,4,B004EPYZOE,"""2 months in Rome, how bad can it be?""

Read the book of the same title, then watch the movie when you've the time.
I prefer the book. In the book titled ""The Rite"", the lead characters were the reluctant exorcist trainee priest and the inquisitive and open-minded female journalist.

After watching this movie the second time at around 2-3 AM in the morning of 8th August 2012, I decided to add another star rating to this review. I guess this story must be told in visual imagery since most modern folks seem too lazy to read books these days.

Anthony Hopkins a great actor alright, but could do better if he had spent a little more time being a little more reverent in the actions of his priestly character. The movie would probably be best if it followed the storyline of the book. The graphics look realistic enough, not too many CGI embellishments.

Colin O'Donoghue plays the skeptical trainee priest quite well.

I immediately spotted two mistakes in this movie while watching it:

(1) The script writers had Anthony Hopkins say in front of the young priest in
  training: ""I absolve you of your error(s)."" This is erroneous. No Catholic
  priest will say this because adherence to error is an act of will on the part
  of the sinner. A function of a priest in confession is to ""absolve you of
  your SINS in the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.""
  Replace the word ""error"" with ""sin"" and the movie would have gotten it right.

(2) The 2 lead actors were playing Roman Catholic priests, not from the Eastern
  Rite. The sign of the cross should be placed from left to right, not from
  right to left as shown in this movie.

Apart from those 2 errors in the movie, the rest of the scenes were OK. Some scenes were very moving and successfully reinforced the point that God and the supernatural world DO exist! If you believe the existence of evil (most people do), then you must automatically believe in the existence of the Ultimate Good, and vice versa. I liked those poignant portions of this movie.

""(You've been running all your life....) You could have run anywhere, why run here (a Catholic seminary)?""

4365042,4,B004EPYZOE,"The Rite is an *extremely* slow-moving -but ultimately very satisfying- horror film.  If I were to judge it based solely on the first hour, I'd have to say it lacks considerably in the suspense category.  However a horror film THIS well made has to be allowed an appropriate amount of time to develop and careful attention and patience on the part of the viewers is a requirement in order to witness its greatness.

Basically the storyline is about a seminary student who travels to Italy and initially questions the existence of the devil but well... without spoiling what happens, let's just say, he changes his tune eventually.  At first he finds himself involved in an exorcism that a young pregnant woman is forced to persevere, and we witness some pretty decent acting on the part of the woman when her voice changes and the actual supposed devil takes over her mind and body.

Now some might find her behavior laughable if you've never seen an exorcism and don't understand (or believe) any of this stuff, and let's be honest, nothing will ever beat the original horror classic the Exorcist released in the mid 70's so her behavior wasn't *nearly* as frightening as the little girl who portrays the devil in that film, however for basically a repeat of what was better presented in the Exorcist, this is decent enough.

One problem with the movie is that for every suspenseful moment, there'd be several minutes of not so suspenseful (or in other words, downright boring) segments that accomplish very little of anything.  The second half of the movie is *clearly* when the film improves dramatically, and especially when Anthony Hopkins' character becomes the center of attention at the very end.  Without this segment, the film surely wouldn't have stood a chance of receiving more than a 3 out of 5 from me.  This is when the suspense increases almost to a boiling point which is amazing, and the way Anthony's character communicates with the seminary student and reveals to him things that nobody else could have possibly known are MAJOR highlights.

Basically the storyline is about making a believer out of someone who's too convinced the devil isn't real.  You will get to witness his journey and gradual change of thinking as the film rolls along (with scattered moments of suspense and a few exorcisms to boot).  Pretty satisfying overall and certainly worthy for all horror movie fans out there.",1333843200,,2412,4.87041564792176
4365043,4,B004EPYZOE,When I received this by mail I was stoked because I had just hooked up my surround sound system. I turned it all the way up n sat back and watched the movie. The bad thing is that it doesn't have special features or behind the scenes. Seeing as I read the book before watching the movie I expected more intense exorcisms but that wasn't the case. All in all it was good. I still think the original exorcist with Linda blare is still the best exorcist movie ever. This movie was still entertaining tho.

Would highly recommend to anyone, especially any Catholic who doubts the reality of these things in the world.  Many of the things presented in the film are similar to what Msgr. Cristiani discusses in his book that TAN books publishes about his experiences as a priest/exorcist in South America called Evidence of Satan in the Modern World.  I don't know if that book is still in print - however if you are feeling like you are 'slacking off' as a Christian, seeing something like this is a good jolt to the system to remind us all of our final end - as the Scripture says if we remember our final end, we won't sin.

I would be interested in reading the book after seeing the film and seeing how much the film deviates from the book which it is based on.  Again, great great orthodox Catholic film on the subject.",1330214400,5,944,4.491228070175438

4365047,4,B004EPYZOE,"A more thoughtful and intelligent film than was the similar ""Exorcist"".  The ""possessed"" people depicted undergo physical contortions, to be certain, but none beyond the capability of the human body i.e. no heads spinning around.  Therefore the viewer is still free to interpret the events as non-demonic psychological and/or physical phenomena.  Nevertheless, because of the degree of contortion and vocal changes, the viewer is led to ""believe"" that the unfortunate individuals in question are truly demon-possessed.
As both the exorcist-supremo and ultimate victim, Hopkins does his usual good job.  Still this film misses the genuine creepiness that I suspect the directors hoped to create.

It is interesting, however, to view the subject of present day ""demon possession"" and supposed exorcism in light of the history of the Roman Catholic Church.  Amazon offers a fascinating book, ""Malleus Malificarum"" [Hammer of Witches] which I have reviewed on Amazon.  It was written by two Catholic clerics and Inquisitors in the late 1400s and is an exhaustive study of how to identify--and punish--witches, warlocks and the demon-possessed.  Yes, demon possession was regarded as a terrible problem back in those days and the 'therapy' wasn't exorcism.  It was interrogation and oftentimes torture accompanied by burning at the stake.  Purifying flames were considered a more certain cure of demon possession than was priestly incantation.",1327449600,,1438,5.555045871559633

4365050,1,B004EPYZOE,"This movie is barely watchable for several reasons.  The first is that most of it is shot in near-total darkness, so it is hard to know what exactly is going on.  The second is that it is even harder to care.  There are two main characters: an elderly priest, played by Anthony Hopkins, who casts out devils while chewing the scenery, and a young seminarian, who has ""doubts"", and keeps asking for some evidence that devils actually exist.  Has nobody ever told him that belief in devils is a Properly Basic Belief for which no evidence is required?

There is also an instantly forgettable female journalist, and a few children who provide the typical ""look, I'm possessed"" stunts that about 90% of modern teenagers can probably do.  Add an unsurprising plot twist and a happy ending, and that's it.  The only scary thing about the movie is that millions of supposedly sane people actually believe this rubbish.

I read the book which the movie is ""loosely based"" and after reading it wasn't sure how a movie could be made of it. I don't recommend judging one based on the other. The book is somewhat dry....the movie....is Intriguing. I have read a lot on my own about exorcism and I'm a Roman Catholic. I was impressed by the research that was obviously done in making this movie. The story of the young American skeptic priest sent to Rome to learn about exorcism is compelling. I thought the acting wad First Rate. My only criticism was the ""red eyed mule"" and some of the other special effects that reminded me too much of the Amityville Horror
or Poltergeist. There  is enough in the book that it wasn't necessary. Sir Anthony Hopkins I agree, is restrained in his role, but I don't think it hurts the film.
The movie was publicized in such a way as to suggest some kind of anti-priest role for Mr. Hopkins and his role is clearly ""NOT"" which I'm sure earned the movie the ""panning "" it received from the critics, in large part.
  In terms of ""fright"" in my opinion the movie ""Exorcist"" Better....in terms of giving the viewer more of a background on exorcism itself, this movie is superior and thankfully was not used as a vehicle to slam the priesthood. As a Catholic, I actually felt the movie strengthened my personal Faith. Perhaps if I just wanted to be Scared out of my wits, I would have watched something else.

4365067,3,B004EPYZOE,"This movie is worth watching, it had potential, it had its moments, but suffered from self-inflicted wounds that were easily avoidable. The lead actors were fine, the writing was not. You would expect Hopkins to contribute a good performance and he did, the young priest was good as well. Without speaking a word, his facial expressions perfectly conveyed his skepticism and frustration with the old priest. These scenes were very well done, unfortunately those were his best scenes, the writing was such that his spoken lines were typical shallow Hollywood cynicism and rarely advanced the story.

Internal conflict and self-doubt within the minds of the characters is realistic and result in good drama. But there is a difference between a conflicted character, and a cynical character. Realistic conflict gives life to the story, cynicism creates exasperation in the viewer (or reader). The young priest did not quite cross over into cynicism, but he was close, and in my mind the movie suffers from this and never fully recovers.....although it tried.

This movie couldn't make up its mind - it didn't take itself serious enough to deliver a convincing outcome. The first 3/4 of the movie was typical Hollywood skepticism and levity about God and Christianity. During this time they threw cold water on their subject and characters, including plenty of ill-timed ""wit"", and then tried to ""pull a rabbit out of the hat"" in the end. It was forced, awkward, unsatisfying, and entirely self-inflicted.

In otherwise good movies, the ill-timed use of ""wit"" has caused more damage than any other blunder (this includes books as well). I'm not against it, and if used correctly it is fine, but in a supernatural drama, a subject so somber and serious, where you are trying to build up to a dramatic climax, every instance of ""wit"" and levity should be scrutinized VERY closely, and probably eliminated unless there is a noticeable contribution to the story. (I did laugh at the cell phone scene in spite of myself.)

A example of the proper use of wit and humor is the classic ""Jaws"". There was plenty of humor, wit and oddball characters, which all fit naturally within the story and were perfectly believable.

Worth watching. I love Hopkins. But plenty to complain about.",1319328000,,2271,4.997354497354498
4365068,3,B004EPYZOE,"It's difficult to see Anthony Hopkins as anyone but Hannibal Lecter.

The Rite is a film inspired by true events which basically means everything is a fabrication except for the smallest plot detail. For this film it was true that a student went to Rome to study to become an exorcist under the leadership of a priest who had expelled many demons.

Michael is the young priest who is full of doubt. He becomes a priest only to get away from his family's funeral home business. When he submits his resignation, his teacher advises him to travel to Rome to study to become an exorcist.  After describing his skepticism to his adviser there,  he is instructed to apprentice under Father Lucas (Hopkins).

Lucas has unorthodox methods (taking a cell phone call in the middle of an exorcism in one scene) and even wrestles with his own beliefs.

I'm not sure if they advertised this movie as a horror movie but it didn't scare me at all. They put in the typical cat-scream-and-jump at you for a cheap scare and the exorcism scenes are a bit intense.

This was made by the same people who made The Exorcism of Emily Rose so it will have a pro-God theme to it. Many people don't like that. For whatever reason, audiences want their evil but hate it when God and the Church is used in a positive way.

In the end, I thought this movie was interesting - there's a twist some may see coming a mile away - but not worth more than a free rental.",1318896000,,1433,4.401515151515151
4365069,4,B004EPYZOE,"Based on real events, ""The Rite"" has a backstory based on Matt Baglio's book of the same name so yes, there is a course for real exorcists at the Vatican. Also the real father who was the subject on the book by Baglio served as a consultant for this production, so instead of the whole hoopla you see in movies like ""The Exorcist"", ""The Rite"" goes into a more real thing, and tries to avoid going into mindless tactics of scary stuff that are made up (like turning heads on 360 degrees or vomiting pea soup, and makes even a remak on it) . As for the movie itself, it has as always its share of creeps and scary tactics, but the most important thing is that delivers a positive message. Good always triumph over evil. As a catholic I was impressed to the fact that the movie opens with a real phrase from John Paul II. Anthony Hopkins is superb in his role, as always and overall the other actors do a good job, but as always Mr Hopkins delivers. Good movie and with a great message, that depends on your overall vision of God, Christ and the fight against evil.",1318809600,3,1062,4.262376237623762
4365070,2,B004EPYZOE,"""The Rite"" had a terrific coming-attraction playing on TV the week before the movie's theatrical release.  Anthony Hopkins was prominently featured with an assortment of creepy expressions, and quick cuts showed a woman contorting her body, the horrified reaction of a young priest, and some shots of Rome.  With Hopkins' star power and a dramatic plot involving humans possessed by the devil, this looked like, finally, a good, old-fashioned horror film geared to scare the wits out of an audience.

 Michael Kovak (Colin O'Donoghue) has just finished four years of seminary school and is on the verge of taking his final vows, but has issues with his own faith.  When the Pope sends down an edict requiring every diocese to have a resident exorcist, Michael's superiors see this as an opportunity to show him the power of faith.  They send him to Rome for a two-month intensive course to prepare him for the role.

 In Rome, he is introduced to Father Lucas, an elderly priest currently attempting to exorcise evil from a 16-year-old girl who was impregnated by her father.  When Michael witnesses one session, with the girl flailing, twisting her body, and speaking English (a language she doesn't know), he is convinced mental illness is at the root of the girl's behavior.

 The rest of the movie is a philosophical dialogue on the presence of the devil in the modern world and how the devil is empowered by people's disbelief in him.  Hopkins is given plenty of opportunity to ham it up, channeling his Hannibal Lecter character and turning Father Lucas into the antithesis of what we believe an exorcist should be.  He's glib, tosses out one-liners, takes cell phone calls in the midst of an exorcism, makes joking references to scenes in a famous horror film, and treats his job with a laid back manner, with occasional outbursts, in the never ending battle of Good and Evil.

 The audience approaches a movie about possession with certain expectations.  We've seen a myriad of possession films, from ""Child's Play,"" in which a doll absorbs the personality and modus operandi of a murderer, to ""The Omen,"" in which the cherub-faced spawn of the devil goes on a killing spree to insinuate himself into a position of power.  What these films have in common is action, and plenty of it -- a feature blatantly absent in ""The Rite,"" which is far too tame.  The primary problem is the film's fence-balancing PG-13 rating, which doesn't allow for intense content, graphic visuals, or strong language.  In other words, this is a possession film for those who think they're too scary.

 Director Mikael Hafstrom is not great with pacing.  At 114 minutes, the movie drags considerably and never has a payoff worth waiting for.  It's sort of like having field seats to the seventh game of the World Series and having the umpires call the game a tie.  Totally unacceptable.

 We already know that Hopkins, given solid material, can be wonderful, but with mediocre stuff like ""The Rite,"" he compensates for drama on the page with histrionics, nervous tics, and ominous stares.  Scares are the easy kind -- an unseen cat suddenly jumping into frame and meowing, loud musical chords that attempt to amp up the tepid ""shock"" moments, and a camera that dances all over the place, trying to pick out an angle that will make the viewer shudder.

 Colin O'Donoghue, who makes his screen debut in ""The Rite,"" is adequate and manages to make his Michael Kovak sympathetic, but he becomes practically invisible as Hopkins upstages their every scene together.

 If you're in the mood for a superior film about possession, rent ""The Exorcist"" and see it done right.  Made 38 years ago, it is not only the best film about demonic possession, but arguably the best horror movie of all time.",1314921600,,3771,4.852895148669797

Hopkin's is amazing as usual.
The other priest was interesting to me as well.
The whole ""crisis of faith"" is always an interesting topic and I think the film would have been served well by staying in this vein instead of going down the usual ""shock"" road.
The acting from everyone was excellent.
The direction, pacing, score were all done well.
What ruined this film for me was...
The first half was excellent.
The second half dissolves into a bunch of spiritual, horror same old, same old that we've seen too many times already from superior films.
The second half of the film tries to take itself seriously but fails in its execution.
If the film had just retained that cynical, emotional crisis tone throughout this film could have been a great thriller.

4365086,3,B004EPYZOE,"For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews. I just want to give a few thoughts on this movie...

The Rite (2011) is a movie that is ""inspired by true events"", NOT ""based on a true story"", as many people erroneously believe. To me, this movie has been done several times before. It's basically a mixture of some elements from The Exorcist (1973) and The Exorcist III (1990), with some elements of the Omen movies and other exorcism/demonic possession movies, such as The Last Exorcism (2010) sprinkled in. Really. I won't include any spoilers for these movies in this review, in case you haven't seen them. Trust me - the story for The Rite is different, yet similar to these previous movies, if that makes sense. It seems that these demonic possession movies are all pretty much the same. As far as pacing goes, the movie drags quite a bit, but things pick up more later on in the movie. Anthony Hopkins does a good job acting. Really, the whole cast does a good job. The movie has a couple of humorous moments, some laugh-out-loud moments of camp, and some jump-out-of-your-seat moments. I prefer suspense rather than a sudden scare that comes out of nowhere, but whatever...

The musical score is decent. As I mentioned previously, this movie was inspired by and borrowed from the Exorcist and Omen movies, except these movies were done better, on the whole. Overall, I can't give a strong recommendation for this movie. It's an OK movie, that's about it.",1312588800,3,1470,4.715953307392996
4365087,4,B004EPYZOE,"Naturally, with both movies based on actual events, there will be some comparisons between this and ""The Exorcist."" There were a few moments in this movie when I thought of that old film and even it's sequels, but this is a very differant movie, and a very differant story. Nothing will ever compare to that old classic, quite possibly the scariest movie ever made, so let's forget it. It's not a competition.

This movie as a stand alone film about possesion was very well acted, very well written, and beautifly shot in Rome. There were a few jump scrares and better than that a few psychological scares. I hate cheap jump scares because any directer can do it. You have a nice quiet scene and then boom, something jumps at the screen and you jump too. But a psychological scare is very hard to come by and this movie has them.

In that old film, when regan spins her head slowly 360, it's a slow, stomach turning fright. Those are the scares I love and cherish, and this film has them. 4 stars out of 5 in my book.

Being a digital age movie, the Blu-ray looks outstanding. The only special features are deleted scenes. I would've liked some interviews and the like. But a good movie well represented is enough to include this movie in my collection with pride.

4365088,5,B004EPYZOE,"Here's a modern-day ""exorcist movie"" that is ""without the head-turning and pea soup,"" as Father Lucas Trevant"" (Anthony Hopkins) puts it early in the movie.

Without the gross stuff - although there are some scary and not-so-pleasant sights and scenes - it makes for a more intelligent look at the subject matter.

Hopkins, no surprise, is excellent in his role at the veteran cleric who has been through many exorcisms. His antagonist, so to speak, is a young seminary student who extremely skeptical. (In fact, in real life, a guy with that little belief in God would never be in a seminary.). Anyway, Colin O'Donoghue is good, too, in that role as ""Michael Kovak."" Set mostly in Florence, Italy, the photography is nice (see this on Blu-Ray) and the story flows smoothly, building in intensity as it goes.

It was very entertaining and is recommended.",1311638400,,854,4.875862068965517
4365089,4,B004EPYZOE,"Id like to start out by saying idk why youd see this if you don't beleive in the paranormal or demons. This movie was very good I liked the detail of just because you don't beleive in the devil doesnt mean it doesnt exist mentality, great acting and storyline. This is a great movie about exorcism and belongs right in there would recommend to anyone into these type of movies.",1310860800,,377,4.4
4365090,2,B004EPYZOE,"I'm the type of viewer who can generally accept just about any initial premise for a film as long as one basic rule is followed: no matter how outrageous or silly the idea, do NOT try to explain it unless you can actually convince me - in other words, I'm willing to watch and enjoy things that can't happen so as long as you don't give me a terrible explanation of why the thing that can't happen can (a good explanation, of course, is even better, but not needed).

The Rite failed that test. (Spoilers) The film follows a young man, Michael Kovak,  (Colin O'Donoghue) who is studying to become a priest, despite his absence of faith. He is sent by his mentor to exorcism school at the Vatican, in the hopes of rekindling that faith. When he starts making too much sense there - providing logical replies to everything the priest claims - he is sent to shadow a real-life exorcist, Father Lucas (Anthony Hopkins). Like the exorcism teacher, Hopkins cannot rationally challenge anything his student can offer. Perhaps the most memorable line of the film is O'Donaghue's ... ""It's gets complicated when no proof of the devil is somehow proof of the devil."" At any rate, there are various encounters with people who are presumably possessed - or in need of mental health checkups - ending with the death of a young, pregnant woman. By now, Kovak is convinced that the devil is not real, and the exorcism business is a crock. Until the devil takes issue with his disbelief and decides to prove to him that he is in fact real (despite his ultimate goal being to stay hidden). Thus begins the possession of Father Lucas; and the eventual ""redemption"" of Kovak and defeat of the devil.

The shining star of this film was the acting - all involved did a wonderful job. The script (aside from the plot) was good, as was most else...except for the story. That was laughable. Again, the premise - whether it's that demonic possession is a reality, or anything else - is fine; but offer me a ridiculous explanation, and you've lost anything you had going for you. Explaining the cure to demonic possession as the belief of and handiwork of a mortal who follows a god who is (obviously) too weak to rid the possessed of the devil himself is absurd. So too is the idea that demonic possession is the product of a lapse in belief in an all powerful, merciful god who relies on mortals to do his dirty work - a god who leaves the helpless to their fate, should a mortal man whose been to exorcism school not be around. In fact, the very idea of this all powerful and yet pathetically weak and useless god who relies on humankind to fight his battles for him is at the same time contradictory and idiotic. It is unfortunate that the film came to such a ridiculous conclusion...because, up until that point, it was decent enough. As it is, though, The Rite (especially with its claim to be based on true events) basically concludes that reason is irrelevant in the face of medieval superstition, and explains away the unbelievable by invoking religion.

He becomes Father Damien Karras in The Exorcist III--the possessed saint who needs to be freed from his bindings.

The visions, hallucinations, that kind of thing were appealing (if you're a fan of this genre) but the thesis set forth isn't really convincing at all.  In Italy there is a higher rate of demonic possession than anywhere else, yes, and you will see more priests performing the ritual.  Italy also has a high rate of sexual abuse with young women and incest than almost anywhere else in the country.  Spitting out nails and coins doth not a possessed person make, not even close.  Talk to any nurse who works at an ER and they will tell you that mentally disturbed people regularly swallow coins, even sharper materials like glass and cigarette lighters.  And they spit them out.

4365109,4,B004EPYZOE,"The movie centres on Michael Kovak (O'Donoghue) who works with his father in the family business as a mortician, but decides to attend seminary school and become a priest as per family tradition. During his time at the school, he suffers a crisis of faith and resigns his position, but after witnessing a fatal car crash and Kovak giving a blessing to a dying woman, his headteacher sends him to Rome to study exorcism, under the tutelage of Father Xavier (Hinds). When he constantly doubts the methods and facts surrounding exorcism, Kovak is sent to see Father Lucas (Hopkins), who shows him exorcism from a more practical perspective which makes Kovak question his beliefs and what is indeed real.

The first half of the film explores Kovak's struggle. The movie is quick to establish Kovak as a man in conflict, struggling with the decision to work at his family's mortuary business or to become a priest (which is stated in the movie as being the two jobs their family does), but it is his character's doubts about his own beliefs that provide the central theme through not only this part of the movie, but the entire movie in general. The pacing of this part of the movie and the development of O'Donoghue's character moved a bit too slowly for me and most of the scenes showed Kovak arguing with his teacher during classes. The film however picks up when Anthony Hopkins' character makes his appearance and Kovak begins to see exorcism in practice.

The second half of the film follows Lucas, with Kovak in tow, as he conducts exorcism sessions. Despite several instances where the supposed possessed person does and says things they can't possibly know or do, Kovak remains the doubter even when he begins to experience strange phenomena himself. The finale is one of the best parts of the film, where Kovak must put aside his doubts if he is to save a friend. O'Donoghue's character is developed a bit more in the second half but he was still a bit bland in comparison to Hopkins, whose character develops nicely and was much more interesting, providing the audience with a creepy performance reminiscent of Hannibal Lecter.

The scenes and dialogue between Hopkins and O'Donoghue are brilliantly written, with O'Donoghue constantly questioning exorcism practices and Hopkins delivering a calm and logical response from the religious perspective. O'Donoghue himself provided some excellent counter arguments based on science and medical fact and it is this battle of beliefs between Hopkins and O'Donoghue that provide the best entertainment.

The mood of the whole film is very sombre. Most scenes are shot either at night or are very dark and dismal. The film also draws on using dream and hallucination sequences to add that surreal element and the use of close-ups showing the demonic presence in victims were also very well done.

OVERALL
The Rite is a good film that can sit proudly as one of the better films about exorcism. Anthony Hopkins once again delivers a stellar performance in one of his better roles in years.

I am traditional catholic (pre-vatican II heresy) and was suprised by people that were not priests allowed in the school. It may be that it was more of a exorcism workshop.

Antony Hopkins was really possessed with playing the part. Colin O'Donoghue spends most of his time walking around looking confused. Alice Braga is too cute for the part and almost distracting from the spooky scenes.

The story itself is just the old rehash of belief and disbelief.  Of a coming of age story for many involved.  Parts of the dialog are tongue-in -cheek as they make reference to the original exorcist movie. Lots of spooky ambiance and not an over done sound track.

This event later unfolds and affects both Luca and Michael in a faithful way. To keep the thrill, I do not want to reveal specific details.

The opening scene introduces our main character who decides to use the Catholic church as a free ride to an education. His creepy background (growing up in a funeral parlor) adds to the mix. Before ducking out from under his vows he is pushed to attend exorcist classes that lead him to father Lucas, a radical exorcist played by Anthony Hopkins.

4365133,4,B004EPYZOE,"I had no trouble in giving ""The Rite"" four stars.  I've always been interested in exorcism -- it happens two or three times a year in my nightmares.  And I did have one very real experience with a ghost and had to exorcize him from my house.  I was only partly successful.

The movie is based on journalist Matt Baglio's 2009 book, ""The Rite: The making of a modern exorcist."" Baglio befriended Fr. Gary Thomas (one of the characters by another name) while in Rome and chronicled the priest's studies at the Pontifical North American College and his eventual apprenticeship with a local exorcist.

The film begins with a statement that 500,000 cases of demonic possession are reported to the Roman Catholic Church each year, and that this is a big increase.  It is not easy for a situation to be considered a real case.  The person must be throughly studied by a psychologist and a doctor and interviewed by a priest.  A report then goes to the Archbishop for further determination, before an exorcist is sent.

This is the backdrop for the movie.  Furthermore, care is taken to keep the movie more or less free of sensational events that depart from the true nature of an exorcism (at least as we know it).  There are no levitations or spinning heads.  The movie relies more on being thought provoking, and explores the question about having faith through believing that evil exist.  However, the pace is well modulated with enough action to keep you in your seat.

The acting is extremely good, and Anthony Hopkins alone is worth the price of admission.  In addition, Rutger Hauer has a small but meaningful role that gives a superb overtone of creepiness throughout the movie.",1306886400,2,1679,4.721649484536083

This whole exorcism thing has become generic and jaded like vampires - you've seen one, you've seen them all and this one in particular does not compare to the 1st one with Linda Blair that started it all in the 70's. This exorcist movie, just like others, brings forth questions such as:

Do people commit sin and evil deeds after making an intelligent and conscious decision to do so or are they possessed by some malevolent entity like a puppet on strings?

If you hear voices in your head telling you to kill yourself, is it a demonic whisper or is the person suffering from psychological disorders like schizophrenia or are both one in the same?

After seeing this, a few questions I asked myself:

Can people of MUSLIM, JEWISH and HINDU faith perform exorcisms or must they be done only by Catholic Priests in the name of JESUS CHRIST?

Why did ANTHONY HOPKINS become possessed by a demonic entity if he was a man of such deep and devoted faith and mental strength? I thought mentally frail people were easy target for malevolent, ill-natured entities?

Why does the devil really want to possess people and have us kill each other or kill oneself? what is his agenda and the final outcome?

4365156,4,B004EPYZOE,"If you're looking for Hannibal Lecter, look elsewhere. The ad shows the face of Anthony Hopkins in a Lecter-like mask with a Lecter-like demeanor, but this is no Lecter. This is Father Lucas, an exorcist, whose job it is to perform the rite that will free victims of their demons. However, even Father Lucas becomes possessed by a most notable demon and must be freed in ""The Rite,"" a dark and shadowy nod to the netherworld filled with dark and scary beings.

Although the film is entitled ""The Rite,"" I see it as a film of faith and belief despite the whole scabrous condition of sin and its need for forgiveness, evil and its opponent goodness, doubt and its reversal into belief. For it is the story of opposites that finally convinces Young, Maybe-Soon-to-Be Father Michael (played convincingly by Colin McDonough) that he is capable of fulfilling his role and obligations.

In-between comes the conflict between priest and demon with the outcome a victory for winner and possible death of life for the victim. Sixteen-year-old Rosie is pregnant by her abusive father yet shudders to admit it. The young priest watches and listens to Rosie's horrible ejaculations of hate and filth and becomes convinced she is psychologically unbalanced and needs a psychotherapist, not an exorcist. Yes, Michael is a doubter on the brink of resigning the priesthood before he becomes a priest. His seminary mentor sees in the young man a potentially beneficial priest and convinces him to undergo a two-month course in exorcism at the Vatican. ""Two months in Rome can't be that bad,"" he uses as a selling point.

The story is that Michael Kolvak is the son of a mortician and knows his father will not send him to college. His family has produced only morticians and priests, so he goes to the seminary with the plan of opting out of the priesthood after he gets a degree. His religious beliefs are practically non-existent, yet he goes to Rome.

During his first class he questions the concept of exorcism. In fact, one of the major premises of the entire film is the ability to question, to think out our beliefs, to learn our place in in the Big Picture. The director goes on ""to say"" that if we don't reach our own conclusions, our faith can falter and even vanish.

The film is set up with increasing tension, darker shadows, ever greater pulsating evil, and terrors both within and without. Even in the face of these apparent evils, he still hesitates. It's only when Father Lucas, who claims to be an ordinary man subject to his own periods of doubt and disbelief is possessed does Michael step forward to practice the rite of exorcism as he has observed Father Lucas perform it.

The only jarring note, for me, in the film occurs the day after the exorcism. Father Lucas is so blase he does not mention it. It's as if it never happened.

Does Anthony Hopkins still have ""it""? Most definitely. When he explains his own disappearing faith after so many encounters with demons, he pauses, then with a little smile, says, ""But I come back into the light.""

Note: I deducted one star because the director infused the possessed priest (Hopkins) with Lecter behavior and speech during his possessed state. Hopkins does not need to be Lecter in every film he makes.",1306627200,,3255,4.738515901060071

Colin O'Donoghue is pleasant in his variable belief and you want him to make it, whichever way he decides to go but, again, he just seems to glide through the movie bumping into the other characters in the movie.

4365161,5,B004EPYZOE,"Review of ""The Rite"" DVD

Michael Kovak (Colin O'Donoghue) has always been ""a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief."" (Isaiah 53:3) The only son of a Chicago funeral director, Itsvan Kovak (Rutger Haer) Michael lived literally down the hall from death his entire life. Unlike most young men who never experience death close hand, Michael is steeped in it, preparing bodies for burial with his father. As a young boy, Michael is coaxed by his father into helping prepare the corpse of his mother, by gently blowing on the red fingernail polish his father applies as he lovingly prepared her body, while whispering endearments into her ear. The image is forever seared into his memory, tainting his adulthood with a lack of faith and a sense of detachment.

When time came to make a decision about his profession in life, Michael knew well that his options were limited, as he told a friend, ""in my family; you either become an undertaker or a priest"". Michael chose the priesthood, not out of sense of mission, but as a way out of his bleak existence and a means to pay for college. After he is ordained as a deacon, Michael's guilt over deceiving his superior about his intentions impels him to write Fr Matthew (Toby Jones) about his decision to leave the seminary. He admits he has no faith and feels he has no vocation to the priesthood.

But fate intervenes before Fr Matthew can act. The two men are involved in a car accident where a young woman is fatally wounded and Fr Matthew looks on stunned silence as Michael blesses the victim reluctantly yet tenderly as she dies. He is impressed by this and convinces Michael to delay leaving the seminary until after he has taken a two month course in Rome. A course in exorcism; ""you're an undertaker, so you're not squeamish"" he adds with a gleam in his eye.

Not at all squeamish, Michael plays the role of devil's advocate in his exorcism class in Rome, challenging his instructor over whether the possessed are suffering from psychosis, and is nonplussed over a sudden power outage when the demon Baal is mentioned. In order to help Michael overcome his doubts about the existence of Satan, his professor, Fr Xavier (Ciaran Hinds) sends him to observe veteran exorcist Fr Lucas Trevant (Anthony Hopkins). Michael is joined in his doubts by Italian journalist Angeline (Alice Braga) who wants him to share his experiences at Fr Lucas side for the purposes of an article.  These two young cynics are about to engage in a life and death struggle which will evoke deep-seated fears and upend their worldview

An eccentric Welshman, Fr Lucas lives a lonely existence in an obscure corner of Rome, occupying an ancient villa whose courtyard is overrun by cats. Fr Lucas takes Michael's cynicism in stride, and advises Michael not to engage in conversation with the demon who possesses the pregnant teen who has come with her sister for her regular exorcism session. Michael is so captivated by her predicament that he finds himself drawn into a life and death struggle with the devil whose very existence he denies.

Although the movie trailer plays like a high-tech adaptation of ""The Exorcist"", to which exorcism films will inevitably be compared, there is more spiritual and emotional depth to director Mikael Hafstrom's work than Blatty's. ""The Rite"" more closely resembles the cinematic subtlety and theological accuracy of ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"", according to Fr. Gary Thomas, the priest from the book on which the film is based. Michael is a sympathetic character and the film's dramatic exposition of the tragic origins of his faith crisis help the audience sympathize with him as he confronts demons both within and without his tortured soul.  Even eccentric Father Lucas, played compellingly by Hopkins is more vivid than the ghostly older priest in ""The Exorcist"", yet the pairing of priests to defeat Satan is a familiar theme. Fr Lucas even makes a sarcastic reference to ""The Exorcist"" telling Michael, ""You'll see no spinning heads and pea soup here!"" What will enliven Catholic viewers is the authenticity of the phenomena of the exorcisms and the splendor of the priesthood when contrasted against the darkness of pure evil. Special effects enhance but do not overpower this compelling thriller and magnificent architecture of Rome augments the timelessness of the story.

For the many fans of the book by AP journalist Matt Baglio, on which the film is loosely based, screenwriter Michael Petroni has respected the basic story while raising the emotional stakes to great dramatic effect when combined with excellent cinematography and the masterful presence of Anthony Hopkins.  Priests who watched the film in the theatre with me had a positive reaction but pointed the following theological errors; as a deacon, Michael could not give absolution as he appears to do in the case of the dying woman, and that an inexperienced priest with emotional wounds and of questionable faith would never be chosen to become an exorcist. Too many weaknesses for Satan to exploit, they explained. The manifestations of possession (vomiting nails and frogs, unearthly voices, superhuman strength and knowledge of inner weaknesses) are absolutely accurate, according to Fr Gary Thomas, the real priest from Baglio's book, who had a less dramatic change of heart about the existence of Satan. When I asked him in an interview whether he believed that the devil was a being he responded, ""I believed when I met him"".

For older teens and up for frightening and macabre scenes, appropriate but vivid sexual innuendo (verbal references to incest and rape) and foul language. This film is best seen with parental supervision.",1306368000,4,5681,4.963196635120926
4365162,4,B004EPYZOE,"Matt Baglio's book THE RITE: MAKING OF A MODERN EXORCIST is described as 'In 2007, the Vatican's chief exorcist revealed an initiative to install an exorcist in every diocese worldwide.  Three days later, the Vatican denied the story. Father Gary Thomas was working as a parish priest in California when church leaders asked him to travel to Rome for training in the rite of exorcism. In Rome, as an apprentice to a veteran Italian exorcist, his eyes were opened to a darker side of the Catholic faith he had never known, and he came to see the battle between good and evil as never before. Journalist Matt Baglio had full access to Father Gary over the course of his training, and the astonishing story he found reveals that the phenomena of possession, demons, the Devil, and exorcism are not merely a remnant of the archaic past, but remain a fearsome power in many people's lives even today.  The inspiration for the movie The Rite, starring Anthony Hopkins, this book provides a uniquely intimate glimpse into the chilling world of a real-life Roman Catholic exorcist.'

And so with a few name changes to protect the innocent Michael Petroni adapted this book for the screen and in doing so developed a very understandable survey of the 'rite' of exorcism.  In the film the student is Michael Kovak (Colin Donaghue, a new young Irish actor) whose indecisions about things clerical harken back to his childhood when while living in a house used as a mortuary he is trained by his father Istvan (Rutger Hauer) and is forced to examine his mother's corpse being prepared for burial.  Knowing that Michael only choices for career were mortician or priest he opts, unconvincingly, for the  latter. After completely seminary but before taking his vows as a priest, Michael resigns form the seminary, only to be encouraged to proceed on a different course by his mentor Father Matthew (Toby Jones) who sends him off to Rome to learn exorcism because of a new demand for priests trained in that rite.  Michael goes to Rome and in classes given by Father Xavier (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds) is found to be an outspoken and sent to study with a brilliant exorcist, Father Lucas Trevant (Anthony Hopkins).  Michael learns during several exorcisms on a young pregnant girl (Marta Gastini) that in order to perform exorcism the priest must believe in not only God but also the devil.  Michael meets  journalist Angeline (Alice Braga) in his classroom who asks to accompany Michael on exorcisms (this is probably meant to be author Baglio's role), and in her presence we witness the transformation of Michael into a believer - with a few surprises arising!

Director Mikael Hfstr&ouml;m paces this film well and while there are no truly new insights into the field of exorcism, he does manage to make the acts appear fairly credible.  Hopkins gives his usual bravura performance and the rest of the cast thankfully underplays their roles.  Some of the scenes are fairly gruesome so it is not a film for the weak of heart.  And if the viewer is expecting a docudrama of Baglio's book, there will be some disappointment.  It is a movie and as a movie it is entertaining.

THE RITE is a somber, chilling examination of faith and religious ritualism--it delivers its terrors in quiet, unexpected ways:  a houseful of frogs; feral cats in the courtyard, the sudden slapping of a small child; lots of rain.
Colin O'Donoghue is quite good as the faith-questioning seminarian and Ciaran Hinds effective as the guiding priest.  But it is Anthony Hopkin's searing performance as the aging exorcist who commands the movie.  It's his best performance in years and reeminds us just how great he is.

As a fan of horror and Exorcist like films, I blind bought The Rite with hopes that it will creep me out and bring back that wild side of Anthony Hopkins, which has been dormant for years and years. Well, for the most part my hopes were met.

The movie is very well directed and put together in such a way that it just flows and it is quite entertaining to the viewer. Anthony Hopkins is actually kind of a funny character. Though the movie is quite serious, there were many parts, more in the beginning, which had my friends and I chuckling. Anthony Hopkins plays a great character, which is very devout, however doesn't seem to care anymore. He has a quite different approach to the whole exorcism thing than others do and this is why a Michael, a young student who is teetering on dropping out of seminary, is sent to visit Father Lucas. Michael doubts Father Lucas's motives and abilities. Michael is searching for a more scientific or medical evidence approach and less leaning towards religion.

The movie is very entertaining and fun to watch. A few parts will make you jump and squirm in your seat, but in the end it is nothing out of the ordinary for an exorcist like film and uses too many clichs. The acting is great and everyone works quite well together. Anthony Hopkins eventually starts to play a very creepy role and will freak you out.

Picture quality is perfect. There are some light scenes and many dark scenes and all look great. The audio is amazing. There are many little creaks and moans from the surrounds and the sounds and dialogue is crystal clear.

The extras were decent with the deleted scenes, however the Alternate Ending was the best part. The Alternate Ending should have been left in the film, as well as some of the deleted scenes, which greatly would have helped with character development and over-all interest in the film.

Over-all I should have Netflix'd The Rite and waited until it dropped to the $10 bin, however I blind bought it and I am sticking with it. It was very entertaining and I will watch it again. The over simplified clichs started to get annoying and almost took the scariness away from the whole exorcist thing. It almost makes it seem like it is not as big a deal as it really is. I hated that aspect of the film. If you rent or buy this make sure you watch the Alternate Ending and the deleted scenes. I wish they were in the film however they made me appreciate the film a little more. Based on the deleted scenes it seems as though someone (director, producers, writer) wanted this film to go a little deeper and in a different direction than the movie actually turn out. However all in all it is a good film and a good purchase. It is re-watchable so I am glad I own it.",1306108800,,2805,4.460038986354776
4365166,2,B004EPYZOE,"The Rite promised to be good cheesy fun if nothing else but the film is little more than a puzzle with all the right pieces put together by a blind person; it has all the right pieces but none of them are in order and the person organizing them has no idea what they SHOULD look like. Essentially The Rite is a remake of ""The Exorcist"" with a director that has no ability to make us see the horror hiding in the ordinary world and, well, without pea soup.

Priest Michael Kovak  (Colin O'Donoghue)hasn't taken his final vows and has sent a letter to his advisor Father Mathew (Toby Jones) resigning because he feels he doesn't have the faith necessary to do the job. So Father Mathew responds by sending Kovak for exorcist training in Rome.  It seems the church wants to have an exorcist in key areas because of the rise of complaints about demonic possession. His trainer Father Xavier (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds) recommends that Kovak who believes most people requiring an exorcism require psychological help because they aren't possessed by a demon spent time with Father Lucas Trevant (Anthony Hopkins) the leading living exorcist to assist him and learn from him. Trevant shows Kovak otherwise and when Trevant becomes possessed he must rely on Kovak to exorcise him.

Based on Father Gary Thomas' training as an exorcist and the book by journalist Matt Baglio who ended up chronicling Thomas' journey from priest to exorcist in his book The Rite: The Making of a Modern Exorcist, the film tackles the same themes as William Friedkin and William Peter Blatty's film (and Blatty's novel of the same name itself inspired by true events as this film claims to be)and even takes a somewhat similar approach to the material without any of the tension, power or influence of Friedkin's classic film.

The problem isn't that we've see everything in The Rite before (we have) but that we've seen it done better; there's nothing new brought to the table. Heck, I'm surprised that Warner wasn't tempted to label this as a sequel of sorts to The Exorcist as it would have attracted more people to its theatrical showing. The film performed dismally at the box office grossing $33 million and that's no surprise. With a PG-13 rating there's not much the director could do to construct a horror film that balanced drama with gross out effects to attract modern audiences. It also meant that director Mikael Hfstr&ouml;m (1408) didn't get the chance to make the film he probably wanted to--an edgy horror film that continues to examine the role of faith in a modern society beset by evil all around. All the film had was Anthony Hopkins who plays weird old guys really well and his role here was to act kind of crazy or, at the very least, inscrutable. While Hopkins is a terrific actor with the right material he isn't given anything to truly sink his teeth into here and without crossing the line into cheesy, the film has nothing else going for it. It plays like a TV movie knock off that we might have seen on the illiterately titled Syfy Channel.

The Rite looks decent on Blu-ray but with a bit rate hovering around 22 on average, it could look quite a bit better. Night scenes are a bit murky looking although detail and color appear solid enough. Still, the overall transfer for a film this new isn't all that great considering how new it is.

Audio sounds quite nice with a richly detailed 5.1 mix although most of the activity is in the front end less in the surround speakers.

The copy that I purchased blindly (a mistake I'll admit) is the single disc edition of the film. It includes deleted scenes but nothing else which should give those of you interested in the film an idea as to how well Warner regarded the film. There is a deluxe edition that features a DVD as well as an alternate ending and a featurette on the priest that inspired the film but neither one has a commentary track.

Unfortunately this film doesn't have The Rite stuff when it comes to scaring people. It also doesn't offer anything new. The drama is only mildly interesting and while Hopkins does the best with the material he's given, he isn't the real star here--that is O'Donoghue --  and there isn't enough screen time devoted to him in the film (he doesn't appear until 25 minutes into the movie). Hopkins may have taken the role in The Rite for a paycheck unfortunately his performance doesn't pay off in a film that doesn't scare nor does it bring anything new to the table.",1306022400,10,4455,4.634980988593156

I remember at one point in the movie I kept thinking when is this guy going to get it and believe.  I found it interesting that even the evil spirit was telling him to wake up and believe that it was real.  Often times for us in this world it is so easy to turn off your spiritual senses that you don't know when evil or good is at your door step.  I also thought where is God in this movie and it came to me: God is always there, but sometimes when your faith is lacking he will allow things to happen to you or others around you until you acknowledge the fact that he is there and that you can't do it alone and that he never left you alone in the first place.

4365171,1,B004EPYZOE,"I had just finished reading the book, _The Rite_, about two or three months before this movie came out in theaters. The book was fascinating, provocative, informative, and often riveting, so when news of the impending release of ""the movie version"" came to my attention I was thrilled at the prospect of seeing it. In the interim, though, I found out about a significant plot discrepancy in the movie (I won't spoil it for you) that sufficiently disgusted me--to the point where I chose not to see the movie in the theater but rather wait until it came out on DVD. On a whim, I ended up buying the DVD ($20) before I had bothered to take the time renting it first from a local Red Box rental machine ($1).  My mistake.

The first clue that the movie may not be faithful to the book's contents was its opening statement that it was ""Inspired by True Events."" This is not the same thing as saying ""Based on True Events,"" and there's good reason why the former statement was used instead of the latter: the movie has virtually nothing to do with the book. The movie is quite fresh in my mind (I literally just finished watching it), and the extent to which it bears any resemblance whatsoever to the book is as follows: (1) It has the same name. (2) A possessed woman who spits up nails occurs in both, though in the book she was not pregnant. (3) A priest goes to Rome to learn about exorcism from a seasoned, older exorcist. (4) The real life senior exorcist, Fr. Carmine DeFilippis (who happens to be mentioned in the movie), and Fr. Lucas (once, early in the movie) tapped people when the exorcism was done. That's where any and all parallels end.

The movie's plot is fairly straightforward. It involves a young Catholic seminarian named Michael Kovak who goes to Rome to learn about exorcism from an older, experienced exorcist named Fr. Lucas. While there, Michael wrestles with his own theological doubts as well as unsettling memories and unresolved issues from his childhood. He meets a female reporter whom he befriends, and she serves as a kind of sounding board for Michael.  Both of them ""want to know the truth""--he about God, and she about reporting facts--so their mutual journey proves to be a kind of revelation for them, both in their individual ways and simultaneously about the existence of the supernatural.

The main problems with the movie vis--vis the book are significant:

(1) The movie revolves in a big way around the fact that the seminary student (he's not yet even a priest, for crying out loud), Michael Kovak, is someone who doubts God's existence. I would even go so far as to say he is portrayed as an outright unbeliever, which is quite odd given that he is a seminarian. The writers were clearly more intent on showcasing this doubt/lack of faith than other aspects of the storyline, and it smacks of near ridicule of belief in the supernatural. I can only guess that perhaps the writers intended to show a progression of the character's own spiritual journey from doubt to belief, but it just comes across as contrived and plastic. In fact, Michael doesn't even come to believe in God until about ten minutes before the end of the movie.

(2) Except for a few dramatic scenes that occasionally punctuate the storyline, the movie trudges along at what I found to be a painfully slow pace. I kept looking at the elapsed time display on my DVD player to see how far along the movie was, hoping that ""any time now"" the movie would pick up and sustain its pace. I was still waiting for that to happen more than an hour into it.

(3) There are so many details in the book that were ignored, distorted, and/or misrepresented in the movie that made the movie lose most of its credibility. From where (in a cramped room that could barely fit four people at most), how (often using Latin prayers taken out of the Roman Ritual of Exorcism), and how often (usually more than a dozen times in a single day) the real-life Fr. Carmine DeFilippis performs exorcisms to where and how he lives (not discussed in the book but portrayed prominently in the movie), the movie takes all kinds of liberties. Here's another small example that demonstrates the director's inattention to detail. The real-life Michael Kovak, a priest named Fr. Gary Thomas, actually served as a consultant for this movie. He specifically instructed Anthony Hopkins to form the Sign of the Cross as up-down-left-right, but in the movie we still see Fr. Lucas doing it up-down-right-left. It may sound like an insignificant detail, but since the Sign of the Cross is such a major Catholic sign, and since it plays such a prominent role in exorcisms, to do it the opposite way is just ridiculous and careless.

(4) SPOILER ALERT! The most egregious element of the movie is when Fr. Lucas himself becomes possessed. This plot detail is absolute, utter nonsense compared to the book, which not only didn't even HINT at such a prospect but if anything strongly implied the absurdity of it. For the writer and/or director to put such an element in the movie was proof positive that the movie was fiction, not fact.

(5) The ""update information"" provided before the end credits, which normally adds credibility to the movie and provides continuity with the present, is clearly meant for dramatic effect and nothing more. It just isn't accurate. The first blurb reads, ""Father Michael Kovak is one of 14 exorcists practicing in the United States today. He now works out of his parish near Chicago."" The fact is that Fr. Gary Thomas went back to his parish in the Diocese of San Jose, CA and continues to serve as its exorcist. As far as the number of exorcists in the U.S. goes, it's hard to know for sure. Their identities are usually not publicized. However, it is safe to say that there is definitely a shortage of them compared to the demand for them. There *should* be one exorcist per diocese, and there are 197 dioceses in the U.S. Pope John Paul II really did emphasize the need to train more exorcists, but their number surely is not what it should be. The second blurb reads, ""Father Lucas Trevant has performed over two thousand exorcisms. He continues to practice in a township outside of Florence."" Fr. Carmine DeFilippis, who mentored Fr. Thomas, continues to serve as a exorcist in Rome, and though I don't recall the book specifically mentioning the number of exorcisms he has performed to date, based on the number he performs daily (which *is* mentioned in the book) coupled with the fact that he's been an exorcist for 24 years, I'd say that 2,000 is a very low estimate--in fact, distortedly low. By comparison, Fr. Gabriel Amorth, Rome's chief exorcist who has been performing exorcisms for about 2 years longer than Fr. Carmine, has dealt with 70,000 cases of demonic possession.

As other reviewers have accurately pointed out, Anthony Hopkins' performance is wonderful, and the cinematography is exquisitely done.  For me, however, those elements are overshadowed by how much of a travesty of the book this movie is. If you choose to watch it, I highly recommend that you rent it or borrow it from your library before you buy it. That way you can make a more informed decision about whether or not to plunk down your hard-earned cash. If you want to see a high-paced, provocative movie about exorcism that is based on real-life circumstances, I recommend you watch ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose."" Though some liberties were also taken with that movie, the essential details of the actual case are portrayed accurately, as are the elements of demonic possession.",1305763200,21,7567,4.711262282690854
4365172,5,B004EPYZOE,"I started watching this movie with much trepidation.  I am not Catholic and many movies of this type tend to be preachy.  This one does not.  It does not really touch much on the Catholic faith at all except in that the only true exorcists are Catholic priests, at least to my knowledge.  This is a movie about faith, plain and simple.  Sure, the subject is exorcism but when you peel away those layers it touches at the heart of every person who has faith or who has doubted, or like me, who has faith and doubts.  This movie is not for children - even given its PG-13 rating - I believe that a less mature early teen may find it disturbing.  Children today are so complacent about violence because they have been so overexposed to it, but a movie such as this they may find truly terrifying.  This is a thriller in the truest mold - one that frightens deeply without the gratuitous gore in the horror genre today.  Do not misread me, however, this is not a horror movie.  A psychological thriller is more of a description.

Anthony Hopkins is at his best here.  Honestly, I was far more chilled by his portrayal here than by his award-winning performance as Dr. Lecter.  Colin McDonoghue more than carries his weight as well as a young man who has lost his way. (I'd like to say more, but it would give away too much and I am not one for spoilers.  Just let me say that this movie is more than worth your time and I really can't imagine why it did not get more attention.  It has a stellar cast with many well-known character actors appearing in small roles.",1305763200,3,1560,4.3310344827586205
4365173,4,B004EPYZOE,"The Rite is a very good movie despite the horrible critic reviews.  Having missed it in theaters I rented it on Amzon's video on demand.  Like the Exorcism of Emily Rose, this is not a horror film.  If you are looking to be scared, this is not the movie for you. Though most horror films are more disgusting than scary.

The Rite begins with the character of who Michael Kovac fed up with working in his father's mortuary. He wants to leave but can't pay for college. So he decides to join the seminary so as to get a college education for free, even though he personally believes in nothing.  When he graduates, Micheal attempts to resign, but the priest he sends his resignation to is not fooled and indirectly threatens to force him to pay back the cost of his education.  He doesn't do this out of spite, but because he sees something in Micheal that Micheal doesn't see in himself.  Reluctantly, Micheal agrees to go to Rome for two month to study exorcism with the notion that if when he gets back and still wants to resign, he can without repercussions.

While in Rome, Michael challenges the professor of the exorcism course thereby publicly announcing his own doubts.  He is later sent to work with an older priest, Father Lucas, who is an exorcist and has been in the trade for some time. Lucas immediately shows Michael a possessed pregnant girl as proof of the existence of the devil. They continue to work on saving the possessed girl, who later dies in the movie. I like the scene where they first meet.  Fr. Lucas doesn't waste time with chit chat, he just immediately gets into the matter. Also, Michael meets a female reporter named Angeline while in Rome. They connect and become friends. At least the script writers decided to not put a romantic interest between them. Alice Braga does a good job of playing the professional reporter who connects with Michael as she too searches for the truth and has something in common with him.

As the movie progresses Michael is forced to face his inner demons. The flashbacks in the movie let the viewer know that he lost his faith when his mother died, but had obviously hung on to a bit of it as he has spent his whole life searching for the truth about God and the Devil. Colin O'Donoghue does an excellent job playing the doubting Michael as he is forced to face actual cases of possession and admit that maybe the devil is real. Never once did I think his performance was forced. He was able to display the character's inner turmoil and the fact that Michael truly cares about these people that Lucas takes him to. At one point he challenges the older Fr. Lucas saying that the pregnant girl needs a psychiatrist more than a priest. Even though you can tell that even he is wondering if maybe she is possessed as she knows things about his past that no one knows about.

Anthony Hopkins does a superb job as Father Lucas. When you first meet him he is a get down to business type and seems a bit off putting.  As the movie continues Hopkins manages to demonstrate the emotional side of the character without it seeming cheesy or forced. There is a scene in which Father Lucas is clearly distraught over the young girl's death. It is a very emotional scene that even you will feel Fr. Lucas' pain as he breaks down and cries and pleads with Michael to not let the devil destroy his soul like he destroyed the girl's. Hopkins also does a great job portraying the demonic taking over of the older priest until the final exorcism scene at the end. In that scene Hopkins puts a certain amount of class into it. Whereas in the Exorcist and in Emily Rose the final exorcism scene immediately starts with screaming and cussing and anything shocking that Hollywood can throw in; in The Rite, the final showdown with the devil starts off with the possessed Fr. Lucas displaying a certain amount of calm and class that only Hopkins can provide. He gets in Micheal and Angeline's heads instead on yelling insults at them.  Then, he slowly progresses into a more antagonistic character until he physically assaults Michael and the female reporter.

Naturally the movie ends with Lucas being purified of his demons, which is good because I hate sad endings. Michael takes his vows and maintains his newfound belief in God and the reality of the devil/evil. I like the parting scene between Micheal and Fr. Lucas. It's not overly sentimental, but there is a chemistry between the characters & actors where they have a newfound respect for each other as they have both witnessed something few ever see.

Like I said, the movie is not scary. I found it to be more of a spiritual journey type film that concerns Michael and Lucas as they both face their own failings and learn to accept that evil does exist and only with God can it be fought. But the movie also does not ignore science. Even the character of Lucas admits that there are a lot of supposed possession cases where the person is truly mentally ill. The exorcist is there when science can't explain what's wrong with an individual. The movie does leave it up to you the viewer to decide if you believe in the devil, or  science. It does provide believable resolution for the characters as they accept what's happened and move on with their lives.

The quality of the movie was very good.  I rented the SD version on video on demand. It loaded quickly and there were no problems with playback. Not once did it look pixelated. It actually felt like I was watching a DVD.  I may buy this on DVD when the price goes down some.  I recommend this movie to anyone that likes a good drama and isn't expecting another Exorcist movie.

4365175,4,B004EPYZOE,"I definately enjoyed the movie The Rite. Some people may say, exorcism movies are cliche, they have done it all before but in this case, we are given a side (or plot line) involving a young seminary student named Michael Kovak (who moonlights as a mortician) that, just as he is deciding that this is not the path for him, some extreme, life altering occurances make him rethink his decisions. Now, as he decides to accept the exorcism course in Rome and see for himself if he is making the right choices, he is still undecided and it will take Anthony Hopkins (Father Lucas) to shed some light (or dark) onto the situation in order to help Michael Kovak finally decide, does he truly believe in the path he is on? Even guidance from his Dad, played by Rutger Hauer isn't helping him.
Personal notes:
Why couldn't we get Rutger Hauer and Anthony Hopkins on the same screen? That would be history.
Without spoiling it, the twist ending that I saw where/how Michael Kovak finally decides his path was excellent. Fine writing and fine acting. Michael's character, even in the opening scenes, show you that he cares for the individual deep down inside.
The acting by the woman possessed (Marta Gastini) was excellent as well. I will be looking for more films with her.
One of the best lines that was good foreshadowing:  Father Lucas, ""Be careful Michael, choosing not to believe in the devil doesn't protect you from him.""
This is not Anthony Hopkins' finest work but it is worth the watch.
I suggest buying it for the fan of dark, religious movies that still have a story to be told.",1305676800,,1581,4.6063829787234045

4365191,3,B004EPYZOE,"Don't expect a horror film here. The subject matter of a new Anthony Hopkins film is Catholic exorcism, but, as his character Father Lucas Trevan says, you are not going to see pea soup in ""The Rite."" The film opens with the all-too-familiar ""inspired by true events"" announcement, and it seems the filmmakers mean it.

A young seminary student Michael Kovak (Colin O'Donoghue), undetermined as to his future, is sent to a new training course for exorcism in the Vatican. Contrary to what most of us would expect, the class does not look much different with very modern teaching equipment.

There, Father Xavier (Ciarn Hinds), a lecturer of the course, suggests that Michael meet Father Lucas Trevant (Anthony Hopkins), a hermit-like priest living with cats, performing an exorcism on a pregnant girl..

Director Mikael Hfstrm takes an interesting approach to the subgenre of exorcism with more believable situations and characters. We are not perfectly sure Father Lucas is really a reliable person. Michael, who is losing his faith, remains skeptic about him naturally. Despite the obvious flaws - overlong introduction wasting Rutger Hauer as Michael's mortician father, an underwritten role for Alice Braga and the film's overall slow pace - his approach works pretty well, with some interesting details. (During his exorcism, Father Lucas receives a call on his cell phone and he takes it.)

Unfortunately, in the second half the film takes a different course, which is a more conventional one. Without spoiling much, I can say we have seen a similar storyline before in a much better film. Anthony Hopkins delivers his over-the-top acting (which I enjoyed), overshadowing Colin O'Donoghue's weak performance.

""The Rite"" is not a terrible film. It offers an intriguing premise with a unique (some say realistic) views of exorcism, which is refreshing to see. The film plays it too safe, however, refusing to take any chances to develop it.",1302393600,11,1945,5.161904761904762

Thankfully The Rite is more subtle than the The Exorcist.  But the message is the same; namely, there are spirits among us, both good and evil, or at least evil spirits.  And evil spirits can have quite an impact.

Film was shot in Hungry.  I'm turning into a fan of Hungarian films.  Much more old fashioned, not nearly as teenager driven as Hollywood.  I like my films more adult, less youth focused.  And more subtle.  This is a horror film with a literary feel to it, like it was made with intelligent people in mind.  Sure there are the special effects.  But special effects are a very minor ingredient in this enterprise.

I'm Catholic, so watching a film that shows no disrespect for Catholicism was a plus for me.  But don't be afraid.  This is not a religious film.  It's a good old fashioned spook film about evil spirits.  Plenty of suspense.  Very well made, I would think this film would not be objectionable to anyone.

My youngest gets nightmares easily, and this movie didn't cause him any issues.  I'm so glad I took my 11 & 13 year olds to see this movie. I want them to know that all that they've been hearing their whole lives is true.  Satan and his demons are real and working harder than ever in this world and that my kids need to keep Christ close to their hearts at all times.  Priests that are trained in exorcism were on the set to advise so they could have this very close to reality!

4365195,2,B004EPYZOE,"I saw this movie last night and I have to tell you, my sides hurt so bad from trying not to laugh out loud in the theatre that I feared that I was going to cough up a nail myself.

Basically you have this young pretty boy actor who wants to drop out of priest school so he can do normal things like getting laid. But drat it, he owes too much on student loans. He is also a questioning rationalist who is unable to buy any of this 'God made the world in six day' hokum, so his superiors decide that sending him away to exorcism school in Rome for a few months will cure him of his skepticism. Sure it will..And I'm the pope.

There amoungst the marble archways and impressive study halls, he goes to class like only three times or something and looks at slide shows of people who live at my local mission. He also learns the signs of possession which are, apathy, trembling limbs, knowledge of something that they shouldn't know, stink eye, yoga contortions, baggy eyelids, and a voice like Al Pacino's.

Several times the film does a flash back into pretty boys past just to show that his father was a creepy mortician who traumatized him as a young boy with the embalmed corpse of his dead mother. In the car ride to the funeral, the boy glares in hatred at the dangling rear view mirror crucifix and bends the one he is holding behind his back when his mothers casket is being lowered into the ground. The part of the flash back that they left out was when he became a preteen goth and arm slicer.

According to The Rite, in order to banish a demon you have to at first know the demons name. What the teachers forgot to tell pretty boy, is that you can only perform an exorcism in dingiest most ill lit room available. This was actually covered in the exorcism schools evening classes on Satanic Home Decorating Design. Unfortunately, pretty boy was too busy hop scotching around with Anthony Hopkins to go to any of his classes anyway.

Pretty boys first hands on introduction to exorcism was in treating this rather flirtatious pregnant Italian chick who says things like 'Judas cross, and lickity split'. She also spreads her legs a lot while liking her lips like a porn star and saying the come on line of 'rape me'. I half expected Pretty boy to do a Leslie Neilson impersonation by suddenly undoing his priest collar and robe while delivering the line.
""If it's this consensual, it's not rape.""

There is also this possibly possessed little boy who speaks of seeing a red eyed mule, but like all little kids in The Rite, he is unceremoniously kicked to the curb like yesterdays news. I mean seriously, pretty boy and his (If I wasn't a celibate monk I would be getting it on with her) female side kick character go through all the trouble of exorcising a major demon out of Anthony Hopkins, and then just go on their merry way to live happily ever after. They just forget all about the little boy who is still seeing red eyed mule demons and getting the tar kicked out of him every night by them. The one thing you will come away with from The Rite, is that little children really do have it rough in this feature. If you don't believe me just ask the little girl that got back handed by Anthony Hopkins for having the nerve to ask him to bless her teddy bear.

In the end, the exorcism of Anthony Hopkins turns into a comedy roast from hell. Anthony Hopkins transforms himself alright, into one part Hannibal Lecter and two parts Triumph The Insult Comic Dog. The real comedy clincher was having pretty boy stop being an atheist on a dime, only to fallow his heart so he can't be wrong. That's what did it folks, that's what saved the day in this film. One second pretty boy didn't believe in the 6,000 year old world story and Anthony Hopkins was all in his face doing 'The Linda Blair' thing, and then the next second, pretty boy had suddenly found his faith right next to his missing bic lighter and ball point pen. Just like that Anthony Hopkins was cured...'Lickity split' as the Italian pregnant chick had said.

Now that I know how easy it is to change, I will never left a finger to do any actual real work towards self improvement ever again. I will believe in every diet fad and home exercise gimmick on the market before just taking a pill. Incidentally, when the film shows the red eyed jackass, that was actually the person who made this film.",1298160000,8,4366,4.401486988847584

The character of Matt Baglio himself has become a female journalist, with whom you're wondering if the seminarian will become inappropriately involved.  This sort of a plot line is standard, insulting Hollywood crap.

PERHAPS, this movie treats Catholicism with a bit more respect than other Hollywood fare.  Yet to recommend it is setting the bar entirely too low.",1297728000,26,795,6.841584158415841
4365206,4,B004EPYZOE,"The rite is a smart, thought-provoking exorcism film, centering on the drama of the lead characters' struggles with faith and doubt. The possession and exorcism rite are executed with much more believable subtlety than many exorcism films, and we benefit as a result (though Hopkins still gets to chew some scenery in the climax). We also benefit from the beautiful scenery of Rome, a visually inspired and fitting change of setting for such a film. All of the performances are top-rate, although the talented supporting cast (Rutger Hauer, Ciaran Hinds, Toby Jones) are underused. In the end, the audience is left with all the right questions regarding faith, doubt, the impact of life circumstances on belief, and the spiritual world. In the end, this is not the scariest exorcism film, but one of the best crafted.  You may not leave a viewing with nightmares, but you will leave impacted.",1297468800,7,892,4.9865771812080535
4365207,3,B004EPYZOE,"The Rite hovers between being a thought-provoking religious mystery and a decent horror film about demonic possession.  Unfortunately, it falls flat on both.

In a nutshell, a candidate for the priesthood (Colin O'Donoghue) who has faith issues (as well as a few other personal ones) is sent to exorcism school at the Vatican before he decides to give up the priesthood altogether.  His mentor in the intricacies of demonic possession is Father Lucas (admirably played by Anthony Hopkins).

The movie adds nothing new to the debate about demonic possession vs mental instability and we, of course, get the requisite demonic possession antics: twisting in weird positions, speaking in a smoker's voice, the VERY tacky (and rather tired) practice by demons of pouncing on one's weak spots and spitting them back with unbridled ferocity, still the usual church attitude regarding exorcism as a necessary evil/dirty little secret despite the fact that the call for exorcisms has risen recently blah, blah, blah, concluding with the horrible Hollywood tactic of sewing up everything nice and neatly at the end with everyone living happily ever after.

This is probably the movie's biggest fault (and the most insulting.) Perhaps if the audience had been allowed to decide for themselves just what choice the troubled priest-in-training made instead of deciding it for us, this alone would have dramatically improved the film.

The performances, however, are actually quite good, especially that of Anthony Hopkins and Colin O'Donoghue and it is because of this, the film is not a total wash out.  Colin is most effective as the brooding (and festive) priest with doubts contrasted by the usually very strong performance by Hopkins in his element as a seasoned but troubled priest himself.  Certainly works as a dinner and a movie outing but not much more than that, I'm afraid.",1296950400,6,1872,5.175496688741722
4365208,4,B004EPYZOE,"THE RITE may well have produced some mixed reviews, but I have to admit that having just seen it at my local multiplex theater, I found it a gripping enough experience although I was not particularly fond of the limp ending. The script should have provided a more satisfying conclusion.

ANTHONY HOPKINS, manages to create a full-bodied character from some very thin material. Matching him every step of the way as a young priest who is beginning to have too many doubts about his faith is COLIN DONOGHUE. He holds his own in every scene with Hopkins, who gives his creepiest performance since ""Silence of the Lambs.""

A major asset is the film's cinematography, especially for the scenes in and around Rome, and whether photographed in rain or shine. The film, in fact, owes a lot of its spellbinding power to the fantastic camerawork and the delicately haunting background score with its occasional uses of strong chords for shock value.

But it's Hopkins who anchors the film with his very ambiguous portrait of a priest who specializes in exorcism. The main victim is a young girl and her scenes of Devil possession are strikingly handled for maximum effect, but decidedly more low-key than the startling effects in ""The Exorcist.""

If you lean towards films about the paranormal or occult, handled with Gothic flourishes, you should find THE RITE a rewarding experience. For fans of Anthony Hopkins, they'll be glad to discover that it's his strongest and creepiest performance in years.

I should have went with my gut when I saw the first trailer, I thought now this is another one of those non-scary catholic mumbo jumbo hocus pocus movies to take my mind off of the real scary things about the catholic church.
Anthony Hopkins can be a great actor when the man has something to work with but not here, ol Tony is just collecting a pay check as he mumbles his way through this mess. Do not support this movie, instead watch the original Exorcist movie.",1296777600,5,793,4.293333333333333
4365210,5,B004EPYZOE,"I was pleasantly surprised by ""The Rite"". It was a very well-done, suspenseful, and engrossing movie, well worth viewing. Many critics had panned it, but what tipped the scales for me was the tour de force performance by Anthony Hopkins, one of his best in years. His range of voice, the make-up, his facial expressions, everything controlled and perfectly modulated. I felt as if I were in the hands of a master actor.
 Michael Kowak (Colin O'Donoghue) is a young man who works at his father's mortuary. He and his father have an adversarial relationship. The son decides to go to a seminary for four years. He is ordained a priest, but then he has serious doubts and is skeptical of his faith. After submitting his resignation, he witnesses an accident in which a young woman and his superior priest are injured. The woman is dying, and she begs Father Kowak to give her the last rites. He hesitates for some moments, and decides to give the rites. The other priest witnesses this. Later he cajoles Michael not to resign immediately but to take a course in exorcism in Rome. (A little monetary blackmail is involved in the superior's request.)
 In Rome Michael begins the course with Father Xavier (Ciaran Hinds). After a time the teacher decides that Michael is a hard case so he assigns him to Father Lucas Trevany (Anthony Hopkins), a longtime experienced exorcist.
 The cinematography in this film is excellent especially the street scenes in Rome and the strange courtyard of Trevant's house with its run-down features, iconography, and its typical army of Roman cats.
 The film wisely concentrates on two cases of people who have been co-opted by the devil. One is young pregnant woman, and one is a young boy. Father Trevant is trying to exorcise the devil from each of them, but in order to do so he must find out the name the devil is using. You'll be entranced by the use of the mule in this film. Both of the possessed people reveal stuff that only Michael would know or which give him great pause.
 Angela Braze plays a reporter named Angelina who becomes a witness to Satanic possession. Michael's character becomes more complex as we go further into the movie. Who in the movie is possessed and who is not?
 The scenes of exorcism are gripping and scary. I found the movie very involving, with superior acting by all involved in this finely crafted plot. Hearkening back to that earlier movie about exorcism, Father Trevant says, ""What did you expect, pea soup?""",1296777600,11,2478,4.724537037037037
4365211,5,B004EPYZOE,"The son of a mortican decides that becoming a priest will cure his crisis of faith. It does not, however, but one event makes him hang on to the faith he was almost ready to wash his hands of. Further, one priest decides that this person would make a good candidate for something new - a program of sorts. Exorist; something the church has decided it needs more of. The problem is that faith does not return that easily and that the priest is given an assignment to hang with another, older exorist and this leads to questions about many things. Amongst those is one thqat borders on a teen girl and the demon he says lives inside of her.
Is it really real?

The whole possession subgenre had suffered as of late, having few movies to truly hang its hat on. That was one of the reasons that this movie really made an impact, and why it was great to see a star like Anothy hopkins enter the ring. From the beginning you really wondered what, if anything, was happening to the main characters and if the ideas were being fed by over-zealous people or by truly hideous crimes. Making things better was the fact that the acting hid everything and that moments in the film really clouded the outcome. There were times when I thought that a slight-of-hand was happening and there were times when I thought that dreams were too strange to be real. This was countered by the teen and some of her comments, and by what seemed to be speaking through her. It had me on the fence.
I personally liked that because movies have problems standing this way. And when the answer comes it seems great - and better if you have some nice speal effects playing off every moment.

There are a lot of horror movies out there and a lot of things might seem to pull a person away from a movie like this. I was honestly surpised when I saw it being released, and I was not really thrilled about it - at first. Then I saw it and I liked it, thinking it would lose out only because it did not have a lot of hype and that the movies had hurt this because of how bad some were. Its sad to think that, but its even sadder when it is true.

Fans of the horror genre should enjoy this. Fans of Hopkins might also enjoy this. If you saw the previews and thought ""great!,"" then you might be like me and think that the movies needed to come out. In that case, you will be happy to watch this.

4365213,4,B004EPYZOE,"Another film about exorcism.  This time from the catholic priests perspective.  While the film really doesn't sort out the true catholic message behind exorcism and some of the content is perhaps beyond the scope of believability, the visuals are wonderful.  This remains a very good film, and it will make a great blue ray addition because there are just so many interesting things to look at in the film.  Special effects are very well done.  The movie is creepy, and in places will scare the crap out of you.  Hopkins plays a most interesting, unpredictible priest.  Many times, you'll ask yourself ""Did he really do that, say that??!!""  He'll also give you his best Lecterisms, so any fan of Lecter would thoroughly enjoy this film.

There are some fascinating shots of interior Rome, showing not it's glamor, but its crowded, hurried, real state.  Shots of and at the Vatican are wonderful.  In a way you will have felt like you very briefly visited Rome, saw some of its wonders, and saw some of its raw, human, crowded elements.

I was very happy I saw this movie on the big screen.  There is so much to see, to hear, and to feel, and to get spooked about. Go see it. You will enjoy it.",1296432000,5,1193,4.544600938967136
4365214,4,B004EPYZOE,"I just saw this in the theater and it was excellent!  Our story begins with a Catholic mortician (Rutger Hauer) and his young son, Michael (Colin O'Donoghue).  Fast forward about 10 years, Michael is a man and leaves the Kovak & Son family business to study to become a priest.  Four years later, Michael is graduating the seminary college but is very confused about his future.  He has not taken his final vows when he is sent to Rome for two weeks training on The Rite of Exorcism.  When he is encouraged to meet the less orthodox Father Lucas (Anthony Hopkins), he sets out on a path of understanding that far exceeds his expectation that demonic possession is just a psychological condition.

This slightly less than 2 hour film is well done, sufficiently scary, suspenseful, and reminds us that Satan is the master of illusion.  It is also a film about the importance of having faith.  Sir Anthony is outstanding in his role as a priest who has been performing exorcisms for some time in Rome. Although I rated the movie an overall ""4,""  Sir Anthony deserves a ""10"" for his acting (as usual).  He not only gets into a role, he BECOMES the role.  Colin does a very nice job as the priest candidate whose beliefs are challenged as he meets some of Satan's demons for himself.  Rutger has a small role, but as another reviewer already said, it was nice to see him again.  Filmed in Hungary and Rome, this show received lots of applause from the audience when it ended.

The real Michael lives in Chicago and there are 14 practicing exorcists in the United States.

Note #1--Please do not bring your young children to the theater with you to see this movie, unless you want them sleeping in your bed for the rest of your life.

Note #2--Even if you do not believe in demonic possession, remember that your perception BECOMES your reality.

For those who have known Primary Evil like I have and yes I have seen the bucket of nails and other objects that sometimes get coughed up, it is rather tame compared to the real deal. They did a good job in showing what has happened in actual exorcisms. Some are simple some are not and it can take years even decades to get free. It should be a good warning to not get involved in anything occult.

Hopefully, it will get more people to ask questions and come to God. For the Atheists who remain unconvinced, I suggest maybe and respectfully ask to observe some. It will take some time but when you come upon the real deal, you'll know it in the first 20 minutes. I do suggest wearing a pair of depends.
