7800171,3,1602743541,"Strictly for those who know of the Merrie Monarch Festival, shows only the main performances of the adult participants.
Would be nice if the added another disc showing the highlights of the rest of the Festivals.
Until the production company that produces this disc put out more capitol towards new video equipment for more shots throughout the performances will have to deal with the limitations of the shots and grainy reproduction.
Expensive for what you get but considering how much it would cost to stay for the whole week of the festival it's worth it.",1359072000,3,558,4.88421052631579
7800172,5,1602743541,Lived Oahu in the 80's.  we travel back to the islands every 2 years or so.  I have always loved hula both ancient and modern.  I was lucky to attend and learn from Auntie Maiki Kuma Hula.  Only for a short time but I will never forget.  I love hula so much and watching this DVD places me in heaven.  Thank you.,1355616000,2,312,3.9516129032258065

I have several videos of the Merrie Monarch Festivals and hope to be able to go there in person some day.  I would encourage anyone who is interested in seeing hula performed to buy this video.",1351468800,2,353,4.587301587301587
