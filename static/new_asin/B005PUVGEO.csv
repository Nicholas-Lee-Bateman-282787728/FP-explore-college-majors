4857686,5,B005PUVGEO,"In the past, as much as I hate to admit it, many of the Christian comedians I've heard just weren't all that funny. Too often the humor has been pretty 'corny'. The comedy on this series is really excellent and my sense is that any of the comedians in this collection would easily be successful in 'non-Christian' comedy -- they are funny people!

This is one of those rare Christian comedy DVD's that can be shared with non-Christian friends, and they will laugh themselves to tears.

This is a must have comedy series for anyone who loves to laugh, and doesn't feel compelled to need unrelenting foul language to make them do so!",1369267200,33,631,4.575221238938053
4857687,5,B005PUVGEO,christian comedians are great for the whole family i don't have to worry about letting my kids watch them without me or my husband because everything is appropriate,1362960000,8,164,4.892857142857143
4857688,4,B005PUVGEO,"DVD format was extremely puzzling to figure out how to get to all ""four"" episodes. Some of the comedy was really not funny and I found a little of it inappropriate though most of it is truly witty, clean humor and very funny. The pinnacle of each show is the finale: Taylor Mason's top-notch-drop-dead-funny-laughing-til-you-cry acts. He is oozing with talent and I haven't laughed so hard in ages: Everyone should enjoy this.",1361577600,5,426,4.930555555555555

4857691,5,B005PUVGEO,"Our house burned this fall and was a total loss - the thing our 9 year old was saddest about losing were the ""Thou Shalt Laugh"" videos.  We ordered the whole set to surprise him - and it ended up being a real bright spot of joy and laughter for our whole family that we will always remember for the 60 days that we had no home.  I wholeheartedly recommend this set!!!  Good good funny family entertainment!!!",1351036800,24,408,4.2727272727272725

Michael Jr., Paul Allen, Thor Ramsey and Taylor Mason are but a few of the very funny comedians involved! I do have 2 minor gripes, but very minor. First, it's 2 DVDs, not 4. Access to ""discs"" 2 and 4 are on 1 and 3. Secondly, Chonda Pierce is on the case, but appears in 0 of the DVDs, she hosts Thou Shalt Laugh 5, not included.

4857707,1,B005PUVGEO,Run. This is the worst so called comedy series i have ever seen. Taylor Mason is the only exception. He was truly funny. The rest of them bored me to death. I can't believe i wasted my money on this series. As Christians we can do better than this junk. Take Tim Hawkins for example. He knows how to be funny. He gets it. But save your money and don't be deceived by the title Thou shalt laugh. What a misnomer.,1455235200,,411,4.08641975308642

Never would I have even imagined that Christian comedy could be this funny. These  guys n gals show that we don't have to turn on trashy comedy just for a good laugh. They keep it all clean, and yet the jokes are funnier then ever. Some push it close on topics, but the topics are the same as any other comedians use...just used in a proper way with a little added twist for laughs. I'm addicted to the series! These shows are priceless!! A MUST SEE!",1445212800,,573,4.162162162162162

Anyway, this cast of comedians is hit or miss; some performances are hilarious (such as Michael Jr's), while others don't deliver or resonate at all. If no profanity in comedy is your thing, then this should suit you. Overall, it's a decent dose of comedy when there aren't better choices available.",1427068800,,443,4.55

4857732,5,B005PUVGEO,"Hilarious.  Good laughs for sure! As some super sensitive and perhaps extremist holiness reviewers have commented, there are jokes that can verge on ""risqu.""

4857734,5,B005PUVGEO,"Yes.....Christians have a sense of humor and Christian comedians are funny without being dirty.

4857743,5,B005PUVGEO,"A group of really good comedians in four events, spread across two DVDs. Some very funny material here, including bits from hosts Tim Conway and John Tesh. Two comedians really stood out to my family: Michael Jr., and Taylor Mason. Mason was so popular with the audience, he was invited to all four of the events, so you'll see a lot of him with his amazing ventriloquism and piano humor. (He has joined Brian Regan as one of our favorite ""clean"" comedians!)",1405555200,,458,4.597560975609756

4857746,2,B005PUVGEO,"Very, very, very disappointed with this purchase.  The DVDs are advertised twice on amazon.  They are first offered as a two set series where you get 4 DVDs on 2 disc for $17.99.  After reading the reviews, I opted to buy the 4 DVDs for $30.  Well, when I got them yesterday, it was only 2 DVDs and not the 4 box set that I ordered for $30.  What made matters worst...after I watched the 1st DVD I noticed DVD 2 is not included on the first DVD. (Same goes for the second DVD).  So, instead of combining all 4 DVDs you only get the first two and pay for ""4""!  I quickly returned these and asked amazon for a refund and they concurred.  It's a shame that Family Christian Media have not caught this mistake yet.  I'd be leery to buy the $17.99 set...PLEASE READ THE REVIEWS, many are not happy with this purchase.  As for as the content and the comedians.  A few are funny and the rest are really dry.  Then again, I didn't get a chance to see all the comedians because they WERE NOT included as stated on the DVD.",1402012800,,1013,4.138461538461539

We even tried it several times thinking she was doing something wrong.  She was not.  When I went back into my account to see about getting the 2 that we were shorted, it said that it was too late for me to return.  The ""great"" deal was not so great after all.
