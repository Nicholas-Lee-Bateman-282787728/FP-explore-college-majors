4155420,4,B003MGI4JS,"This is not a great film but it is better than some of the other reviews would suggest.  It was shot on a limited budget but is relatively stylish with good cinematography. Some of the reviewer's negative comments are inane.  Especially egregious is the reviewers comment about hating the movie because one of the characters punched a dog. Seriously -- the character is a violent criminal and he doesn't like dogs. (Of course the dog was not really hurt!  It is a movie.)

The real flaws are the heist scene which does drag a bit and the contrived ending.  But despite these limitations, this is a much better and much more realistic movie than films like Heist.  Mick Rossi does a fine job and Robert Miano is a reliable character actor.  I rented the film through Netflix and suggest you rent and not purchase it unless you are an obsessive collector of crime dramas.  I watch movies on a widescreen while rowing using a Concept 2 and riding a spinner so I watch a lot of movies.  Compared to some other films I have watched recently (e.g., Killing Zoe which I did not finish), this film is a small but flawed gem.",1344384000,7,1116,4.485148514851486

4155423,2,B003MGI4JS,"I finally got a chance to watch the DVD ""2:22"" and was very disappointed, first in the extreme violence I was so disgusted when the jerk hit the dog. I hate violence and even more when it is violence against a animal. Then I was shocked that Val Kilmer was on the screen for only a small part of the DVD. I am a Big Fan of Val Kilmer and bought this DVD without knowing to much about it because it seemed Val was starring in it. They should have listed Val as a cameo. I will not recommend this movie to anyone.",1289001600,2,511,3.970873786407767
4155424,5,B003MGI4JS,"This film isn't action packed, it doesn't have a huge cast of A list actors, what it does have is a lot of heart. This is a film where you get to know the characters in their journey. They aren't good guys but you still care about them and the others entangled in their craft. If you want a film that makes you think while enjoying the crazy story and characters in it then this is the film for you. What little action it does have is awesome, this film feels so real. The rave scene was great too! The ending has one of the most realistic death scenes ever too, just watch for yourself, great film!",1283644800,13,599,4.128205128205129
4155425,3,B003MGI4JS,"If you're a fan of heist movies like Heat and Ocean's 11, then 2:22 probably won't impress you.  While the film has its rare moments, as well as a solid cast, it simply lacks any real spark.

For this being Phillip Guzman's second film as a director, I have to give him credit for doing a decent job.  There are some great cinematography moments, and a few clever shots that keep things interesting.  Unfortunately, the writing by Guzman and lead actor Mick Rossi is average at best.  Pointless subplots, weak attempts at suspense, and ridiculous coincidences are what kept this movie from being shown in theaters.

The marketing for this movie is also questionable.  Val ""Straight to DVD"" Kilmer is prominently featured on the cover, next to a praising review snippet.  Which is confusing given that Kilmer, playing a paranoid jeweler, gets exactly four minutes of screen time in this entire movie.  Gabriel Byrne (Usual Suspects) has a ""blink and you missed him"" role.  No one on the cast stands out, save for Robert Miano, best remembered as Sonny Red from Donnie Brasco.  The most seasoned actor in the film, Miano has more than a few great scene-stealing moments.  I was also surprised by newbie actress Sandy Duarte, one of the most gorgeous women that I've ever seen in film.

Bottom line, this is a fairly average heist flick.  The heist team comes off looking like amateurs, and the film lacked any ""edge of your seat"" suspense.  Give this one a rent before you decide to buy the DVD.",1282867200,17,1493,4.710424710424711

4155443,3,B003MGI4JS,"Came so close to being a great movie!
An original heist idea and a good cast, bolstered with the presence of Val Kilmer!
Unfortunately, the heist was really the only creative idea in the whole movie, well I shouldn't say that, because a couple of other themes that could have been further developed. But, the director chose to focus 1/2 to 3/4 of the movie on the heist itself and every possible problem it would encounter! Not surprising, since the director also wrote the screen play, and it is always easier to fully develop one idea rather than several.",1399075200,,557,4.636363636363637

Val Kilmer's performance was good, but there was so little of it.  His character was no more developed than any of the others.  I miss the old Val Kilmer, as many others do.

Then a surprise seen of the actor dragging that beautiful dog out of the house & shooting it made me sick, & very angry!

4155464,1,B003MGI4JS,"Actually the menu in the actual disc allows for German and English, I watched it in English 2D and 3D.  Some may be fooled by the photo and participation of Kilmer, you may want to know that he appears for only a few minutes, so it is obvious that his name and photo were used to make the movie attractive (if one refers to Tombstone and The Saint).

The filming appearance is of soap opera video cameras quality, with a mediocre plot, and relatively unkonwn actors (to me).

At first I was about to trash it after I jumped a few chapters but before doing so I decided to give it a chance and watch it, and confirm my money was wasted on a movie I cannot return after opening.

 Fortunately is not a $35 3D disc.  It also appears that the use of 3D as label, in addition to Kilmer, was to intentionally give the appearance of a movie to watch.  If you want my disc let me know, is yours free, send me a self-stamped envelop.",1347840000,7,924,4.157303370786517
