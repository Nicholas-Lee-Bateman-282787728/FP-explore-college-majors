They are Frank Lloyd Wrights unknown legacy, and their practice forms a legacy for all women working in architecture today.""  This film asks a central question: Why has the work of these women, and so many others, been excluded from the narrative of modern architectural history? We need more films and educational material that promotes and showcases the work of women in architecture. Bravo to BWAF for producing this film. http://bwaf.org/foundation/foundation-about/",1418774400,,577,5.48314606741573
8376590,3,B002P3LPYU,The material is fine as a very basic introduction to its subjects.  The recording quality is basic and theapproach to the individual subjects is cursory.  Hopefully this offering is a precursor to more detailed work on the subject.,1398556800,,231,5.052631578947368
8376591,4,B002P3LPYU,"A movie made by BWAF. It is a great non-profit interested in women architects. I have ordered it for my university and might consider it for a class film. An important movie, I think, for architects interested in feminism and social justice!",1379289600,,241,4.761904761904762
8376592,5,B002P3LPYU,"Boy, what a PLEASANT surprise!  And that's the problem as most people including ""students"" of Frank Lloyd Wright, such as myself, are unaware of the women who worked and studied under this great architect. Yes, wi know women 'worked' for Wright, but had no idea what successes they were and how their contribution to the architecture of our cities and neighborhoods. I'm so glad to see this film and the research and effort that went into its production. ANY student of Wright or architecture should see this. My only complaint is to see more works of the women architects selected. A few photos of their work is represented but more information on them would be great. Searching the Internet Yielded tragically little. These women architects were wonderful; homes, factories, hospitals, civic buildings and more! I was amazed! I especially enjoyed the symposium and 'meeting' author Suzannah Lessard, author and psychologist Carol Gilligan and Gwendolyn Wright from PBS' History Detectives. I got to see a side of Gwendolyn I hadn't seen before.  Excellent video, most enlightening!",1314662400,,1083,5.182857142857143
