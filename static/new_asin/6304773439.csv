924381,4,6304773439,I have to admit that good writing or not this is one of my favorite escape movies and I wish it would come out in DVD.  My liking it has something to do with John's use of the typewriter and his ability to change the  direction of the characters through the machine.  Once he damages the  typewriter he needs to make a technical sevice call to get it going again.  You can't beat that.  We even get to see a perplexed Robert Wagner and the  rest of a great cast.,959040000,6,462,4.066666666666666
924382,2,6304773439,"Candy stars as a soap opera writer who finds himself inside the show and able to change things as he likes.
Another movie which wasted Candy's talent, has been overshadowed by other films with similar ideas doing them  better, such as Groundhog Day with Bill Murray and The Truman Show with Jim  Carrey.
Nevertheless, Candy's charm carries you through, and the movie is  watchable just for that.",944092800,3,395,4.865671641791045
924485,2,6304773439,"This is not nearly as funny or well-constructed as I remembered, and that's coming from someone who grew up loving John Candy and bought this film very much wanting to enjoy it.

There simply aren't any laughs or even many moments of modest entertainment in this fantasy-parody film that follows a television soap opera writer (Candy) trapped in his own fictional narrative. Candy tries to strain out some laughs by sheer force of will, but the script gives him nothing but unremitting exposition-speak, underwhelming action-adventure set pieces, and a coterie of desperately ""zany"" supporting characters. All of this to support a film that offers only a premise and a bag of underdeveloped subplots, never an actual story with any momentum or stakes. I give it two stars purely on cast, premise, and Candy's lovable everyman persona, which even this film can't fully stifle. The film feels disjointed, half-baked, and overly amused with its wacky but unfunny antics. If you want to watch John Candy be funny, go watch STRIPES, PLANES/TRAINS, UNCLE BUCK, or one of his other classics.  Nothing funny to see here, folks, move along.",1504224000,,1131,5.075268817204301

924490,3,6304773439,"This movie became one of my favorites on VHS, then on DVD in the early 2000's, so when the movie was available for digital streaming purchase, I jumped at the chance.  Immediately I noticed that the title song (Delirious) by Prince was edited out and replaced by some soul song by James Brown.  This was only a few seconds into the movie.  A few scenes in the start of the movie were just completely cut!  This includes the first time  John Candy's character goes to the ""New York Delicatessen.""  Also, later on in the movie, the piano playing scene at the party is very poorly overdubbed and different than the VHS or DVD version.  There's plenty others to mention, but I don't want to bash the film too much because it is still very funny!  Great soap opera satire and slapstick combine to make an enjoyable John Candy film.  Also, on a side note, Dylan Baker once again plays a very funny part in this movie in a small supporting role as he did in Planes Trains and Automobiles.",1491091200,,981,4.435754189944134

924494,3,6304773439,"KINO LORBER has reissued Delirious on blu-ray & dvd, the very old MGM DVD is long out of print
but the only effort Kino has given is upgrade the picture quality with new 1:85:1 1080p HD transfer
which does look excellent i must say very nice sharp & clear picture much better than the old MGM DVD for sure
the sound quality has been boosted up to 2.0 master mix
but that's all Kino lorber has done, there's no new extras
Director of the film Tom mankiewiz passed away over 7 years ago now
Richard Donner was executive producer on the film but he wasn't interviewed either
so all you get is the usual Theatrical trailer in HD but still a worthy upgrade from the old MGM DVD
Kino has reissued the film on DVD aswell which has the same content as the blu-ray just the usual Trailer
so the only difference is the picture quality the dvd reissue only has Digital remaster transfer & Dolby stereo mix
the blu-ray has 1080p HD transfer & 2.0 master audio mix
so whether you buy the Blu-ray or DVD it makes no difference at all except for the picture quality & sound
so 2-3 stars i give for the blu-ray reissue based on new HD transfer & new sound mix but no new extras
so definitey worth buying either the dvd or blu-ray, time to throw out the old MGM DVD",1486080000,,1248,4.2259414225941425

924549,4,6304773439,"I was a big John Candy fan through the 1980s. I remember seeing him in Stripes, Spaceballs, Summer Rental, Planes, Trains & Automobilesand Home Alone, but for some reason, Delirious doesnt get the respect of his other movies. This is my favorite John Candy (and Emma Samms) movie of all time. Part of it is because as a writer and a fan of television, the idea of getting into one of my favorite TV shows and be able to control the outcome has enormous possibilities for a fantasy. Plus, using the framework of a soap opera parody as the plot to carry it along makes it that much more funny. In the movie, John Candy plays TV producer Jack Gable who is in love with his leading actress played by the stunningly beautiful Emma Samms and struggling to keep creative control over his series from his co-producers played by Jerry Orbach and Renee Taylor. Meanwhile, he keeps stumbling quite literally into Mariel Hemingway as the struggling potential actress trying to get a role on his show and as a rival TV writer named Fetterman tries changing his universe even with his own typos creating havoc. After mysteriously ending up on his show, he keeps trying to write the plot to win Sammss heart through gleefully farfetched fantasies, but he instead keeps running into Hemingway. The best parts of this movie are its ability to parody the soap opera theme (brain tumors, favorite sons, absurd declarations, diabolical scheming, series contradictions, et al). Samms seems to enjoy herself in this movie playing a conniving vixen while the versatile Hemingway plays the All-American girl-next-door type with a bit of whimsical awkwardness, but much of the comedy comes from the male co-stars, particularly Raymond Burr as the head of the Hedison clan. Playing the comedy straight, Burr delivers almost every line as a catchphrase. (You cant even do that right, can you son?) Charles Rocket definitely hams up his role as the amnesiac son struggling to get his fathers approval, and Dylan Baker (Spiderman) as the preppy favorite son gradually wasting away due to the evil plotting of his sister. David Rasche from ""Sledgehammer"" (and now Impastor) plays Emma's handsome yet not-too-bright doctor boyfriend impervious to her venom and wiles as he tries to hold on to his soul and her at the same time. Robert Wagner, Margot Kidder and Margaux Hemingway have cameos along the way. Are there awkward scenes in the plot? Yes. Candys Jack Gable discovers way too easily how to manipulate the escapist reality of his TV show; one of a few scenes that is abbreviated to hasten the plot along. Does the movie have its goofy moments? Yes, but the film does cover the spectrum from droll to humorous without ever losing its steam. Is it funny when the characters start to notice things no longer make sense around them? (When did you start carrying a knife?) Yes. ""Delirious"" is a sort of ""Twilight Zone"" affair in which a soap mogul is haunted by his old characters, even those he has killed off. (Len? Len? We killed him off two seasons ago!) Even though this side of the plot is barely explored, what we have left is a Brady Bunch-level fantasy-comedy with all the raucous humor of a spoof of a daytime drama. At its core, Delirious is a love story linking Candy with Hemingway to discover what he really wants instead of what he thinks he wants. It has a strong cast, a script that bounces from the weak to the absurd to the amusing and an enterprising premise. Delirious is definitely a movie that I will encourage others to watch.",1477008000,8,3522,4.747145187601958

This is a movie about a writer for soap operas (John Candy) who hits his head and wakes up inside of his soap opera so that everything that he created (the hospital, the characters, the stories) is real. He is a real character inside of his own soap opera, and yet, he is still able to write for the ""show.""  So, he writes scenes, and then they immediately happen, and so he makes himself very successful within the town.

My favorite part was when John Candy wakes up inside of the hospital that he created and realizes that the hospital is real, not a ""set.""  He then runs into the doctor that he created, and in shock, he says, ""He is operating on people? He is not a doctor. He is an actor. And not even a good one.""

925013,5,6304773439,I think this is a hilarious movie for anyone alive or not in a coma. Highly remend comedy lovers watch it,1388880000,,105,4.0476190476190474

925015,5,6304773439,"""Delirious"" is a comedy type movie that stars the late John Candy as writer Jack Gable. Gable is able to creatively manipulate his reality with just the act of scripting his desired outcome on a typewriter. He even comes face to face with one of his written stories in an accident induced dream. The movie ""Delirious"" gently penetrates the issue of what could happen when a man or woman can simply ""write the outcome"" of their inner and outer world.",1379894400,,449,4.625
925016,1,6304773439,"I tried. I like Tom Mankiewicz. I loved John Candy. I wanted this to be a funny movie and thought it would be. Candy has never worked harder trying to make a totally unfunny script charming, but he fails because no one could, even if he were more adept a comic actor than Candy was, and someone better would be hard to find. Everything is heavy handed and after twenty-five minutes of depression over this terrible failure, I left the movie and started reading Mankiewicz book (autobiography) and forgive him. For the rest of you, buy the book and leave out the movie. He remarks he never understood why it failed. Perhaps he finished it and never watched it.",1377216000,3,659,4.546218487394958
925017,1,6304773439,"This movie wasn't quite what I was expecting.  Although I was expecting a movie set in a soap-opera type world, what I wasn't expecting was for the movie to be like one.  It was awful and silly and very boring.  I did not like the characters or the conflicts.  I did smile a few times at some of the jokes, but mostly I thought it was boring and unfunny.  I would not recommend this movie and would not want to watch it again.",1364342400,2,426,4.0843373493975905
925018,5,6304773439,"This is such a good example of John Candy's goofiness.  I enjoyed the story line, though of course you wouldn't want to take it seriously.  Seriously? John Candy! Seriously?",1363910400,2,173,4.931034482758621

925044,5,6304773439,John Candy is the star in this...do I have to Say More?This movie is about a Guy that writes a tv show. He gets knocked out and wakes up in his own story and now he must write himself out.,1333670400,,188,3.725
925045,3,6304773439,"This is a missed opportunity.  They certainly have a good premise to work with. The head writer of a TV soap knocks himself unconscious and finds himself trapped in the fictional town of his creation.  To get out of various predicaments he can write his way out with his trusty manual typewriter.  The possibilities here are endless but the scriptwriters drop the ball.  We get tired gags about waiting for the cable guy and what not.  Anybody who finds it funny to have Dylan Baker's character bleed from the gums, pull out clumps of hair, and have a large tumor grow on his neck raise your hand.  ""Delirious"" is made palatable by a game cast that includes John Candy, the aforementioned Emma Samms, and David Rasche from TV's cult classic ""Sledge Hammer"".  Recommended for Candy completists only.",1298246400,,798,4.781021897810219

It was quietly re-issued as part of The John Candy Triple Feature at the end of 2010 along with Canadian Bacon and Spaceballs. Even if you have or don't want those, it's still cheaper than buying an out of print copy of Delirious by itself! Now if they could just get around to doing a nice re-issue of my favorite John Candy film besides Planes, Only the Lonely.",1296086400,6,482,4.25

925088,5,6304773439,"When I first saw this movie I was a little too young to grasp what was going on. I later rediscovered it on DVD, and thoroughly enjoyed it!

If you've ever awakened and found yourself in a Lucid Dream, then you'll have some kind of idea what you're in for when seeing this movie. Imagine awaking to find yourself on the set of the soap opera that you write for, only it's not a set, it's become REAL! And imagine being able to use your typewrite to write anything into existance! Need a taxi? Write one approachers your house, and go outside to get in.

A wonderful fantasy! Now if I can just get these black bars off my tv, on channels 2 and 7! And if you're looking for an italian version of this, just do a little research for a movie titled ""Fuori Di Testa."" The Italian dubs are great! :)",1110499200,5,793,4.176470588235294

925091,4,6304773439,"John Candy was one of the true greats of modern comedy. Unfortunately, he spent most of his career performing in poorly written movies which did not allow him to display his comic genius. DELIRIOUS doesn't fit that bill, however, neither does it achieve the heights that it could have.
In DELIRIOUS, Candy plays a soap opera writer/producer of the hottest show on televsion. He finds himself constantly battling the other producers who always want to revamp the show and quite frankly would like to get rid of him. While driving in the country for a weekend vacation, Candy is in a car accident and awakens to find himself in a real version of the fictional town he helped create on his soap.
The movie is a lot of fun and toys with an interesting idea. However, much more could have been done with the ""life in a soap opera"" concept to have capitalized upon Candy's talent. The movie has an impressive cast including Mariel Hemingway, Robert Wagner, and Raymond Burr.
Overall a charming little movie that's a lot of fun. Great for an evening of escapist delight.",1014336000,19,1063,4.689839572192513
