8059193,5,B0009DWW40,"I am trying to develop and build a sales team, and this DVD showed some very good, timeless techniques articulated very well by Tom Hopkins.

I would highly reccommend this to any aspiring sales person - experienced or not. Even a great revision for experienced sales people.",1187222400,3,275,4.851063829787234
8059194,2,B0009DWW40,I expected more as I have his book in my library.  Seems a little old fashion and out of touch.  I kept looking for the pinkie ring.,1140566400,5,132,3.8518518518518516
8059195,4,B0009DWW40,"Interesting video that shows Hopkins delivering a motivating, rousing presentation in a very professionally-shot video that's worth getting.  This would be a perfect video to show to your sales team to get them a bit more motivated about selling, and to review some of Tom's classic verbal sales counters and alternative phrases.

I've enjoyed learning from Tom's training for many many years, it's nice to see him in a modern video shoot in an upscale presentation format.  Excellent value since also provides an audio CD in addition to the DVD.  Slick production.

This would be something I as a sales manager would want to have on my shelf, to show to my sales team.. then have them role-play out alternatives and customized phrases for specific selling situations.  Nice work.",1120262400,23,780,5.007751937984496
