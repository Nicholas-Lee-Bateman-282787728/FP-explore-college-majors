8165350,4,B000EU1OQA,"I have been playing bass since 2003 and am one of the few female bassists who plays a six-string bass.  My husband bought me the VHS version of this video way back when, before it was available on DVD, and I really enjoy it.  However, I have some unique abilities and specific teaching needs which make it more valuable to me than perhaps other bassists.  First, although I can read music, I play bass primarily by ear.  As the other reviewer points out, you cannot really see the instructor's hands very well.  What I like about the video, though, is that the bass riffs are audibly prominent enough for me to figure out by ear what he's playing.  In addition, he plays great recognizable bass riffs from ""Lady Madonna,"" ""Barracuda,"" ""Back in the Saddle,"" ""Sledgehammer,"" and ""Roundabout,"" among others.  In addition, because I am a woman, I have a unique set of ""groupies"" who follow me around in the hopes I will screw up, because everyone knows women cannot play bass, right?  So I learned these riffs by ear for the pure shock value.  Learning these riffs gave me the confidence early in my bass-playing career to silence most of the people who laughed at me and told me I'd never be able to play bass. This video motivated me to get good at bass guitar.",1259452800,2,1259,4.535398230088496
8165351,2,B000EU1OQA,"It's clear the guy playing the bass is a good bass player... but not a good teacher. He doesn't explain things at all which wouldn't be that bad if they showed you what he was doing with his hands but the veiw is so far away it is wothless. The only good quality of the video is the musical notation that goes along with the riffs (DVD Version). This is probably the only thing that makes this video usable. I like some of the other MVP guitar videos, but this bass video is not that good.",1163030400,,489,4.104166666666667
