Chopin's life certainly had its challenges, so it may have been an accurate portrayal. But somehow the creativity and beauty of the compositions failed to rise above the difficult life being portrayed, despite the pianist's best effort..",1525392000,,360,4.640625
8389966,1,B0036FOV42,"It's important to realize that Chopin's purported letters to Delfina Potocka were thoroughly proven to be fakes; the two did have a more or less intense relationship, but little is actually known about it.  Paulina Czernicka was a scam artist, and there was no conspiracy necessary to discredit her, as her work spoke for itself.  It was easy to show, for example, that her letters used words that didn't exist in the Polish language in Chopin's time.  While enjoying Igoshina's playing, please keep that in mind.  If you are interested in Chopin's life, please read from reputable sources-- none of the films about him have much to do with reality, unfortunately.",1299888000,5,664,4.954954954954955
8389967,5,B0036FOV42,"The existing biographies of Chopin concentrate on his music and not much on his personal character. He comes over more God like than human whose inventive mind is sometimes inspired and sometimes put off by his contemporaries. But this movie suggests that he was much more passionate and involved with people, especially with one woman, than we have been lead to believe. Knowing this has put a new cast on his music. Somehow knowing that Chopin was more 'manlike' than 'godlike' has, for me, added another dimension to his music. I think any Chopin devotee will come to the same conclusion. And the playing of Valentina Igoshina, apart from being a delight to watch and listen to, emphasizes the story being told by the film.",1282435200,,726,4.816
8389968,5,B0036FOV42,This is a marvelous video. The story is fascinating and true and the pianist Valentina Igoshina is absolutely superb!!,1280620800,3,118,5.2631578947368425
