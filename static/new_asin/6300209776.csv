7805709,5,6300209776,"Volume 2 of this series - listed for sale at this site - shows a young James Coburn in the 1st episode smacking his wife around because he thinks she is running around with Adam Cartwright.  The 2nd episode has DeForest Kelley (AKA ""Bones"" McCoy of Star Trek fame) playing ""an Apache-slaughtering Cavalry captain"".  Definitely not politically correct, but brings back lots of memories for us aging baby boomers.",1138147200,,411,4.942028985507246
