8435321,4,B004LYVL9A,"In the City of Sylvia is a film for those who enjoy watching people and for those who don't need a concrete story to be entertained. First and foremost, it depicts a young man observing the people of Strasbourg, France. He's a naturally curious guy, casually studying the behaviors and mannerisms of others, though some would consider his pointed, yet vacant, icy blue stares as going well beyond the comfort zone. These steadfast, invasive examinations of faces and figures often wind up as studies and sketches for his artist's journal. While he roams through Strasbourg, he also has hopes of finding Sylvie, a girl he met some years before. Will he find her?

If you're thinking of giving this film a try, keep in mind that very little drama occurs. More than anything else it's a fictional portrait of the people in the leisurely, picturesque city of Strasbourg as seen through the eyes of a young man. At times, the director's placement of the figures going about their various activities seem forced, as if some scenes were specifically arranged for advertising purposes. This detail tends to lend a sterile quality to the picture, however, most moviegoers content with people watching will find enough attractive city shots and day-to-day activities to hold their attention for the 84 minute duration.

8435323,5,B004LYVL9A,"As the previous reviewer noted, this won't be a film for everyone -- perhaps not even for some who enjoy films where ""nothing happens"" (even though Something does happen in that Nothing). This is that comparatively rare thing, a film that speaks in visual language, where dialogue & plot are ultimately beside the point. It's a film about emotion, memories, and the psyche of someone searching for someone or something thing he'll never find, because the flesh-&-blood embodiment & inspiration can never match the pure ideal within the seeker. And while this uses the classic configuration of the sensitive young man pursuing the dream woman, it could work equally as well with two men or two women.

But of course it's about much more than that, too. It's a meditation on looking, both for the characters & for the viewers, as well as a meditation on the fleeting, ephemeral nature of human moments that blow away like leaves, like strands of hair, like the pages of a sketchbook where we try to trap that insubstantial instant. I'm reminded of Andre Gregory's line near the end of ""My Dinner With Andre"" when he says, ""Who are we? We're phantoms. We're ghosts."" As are the fantasies & longings that drive us through endless streets, endless hours, searching for something that may not truly exist except in our own minds.

I suspect that this is a film that becomes richer with each viewing, and I look forward to watching it again soon. Highly, dreamily recommended!",1415318400,2,1469,4.825396825396825
8435324,5,B004LYVL9A,"Some viewers may suspect in the first 10 minutes this isn't their cup of tea.  I say without snobbery or pretension, watch it again one day when you are in a patient and reflective mood.  I promise there is something to it.  Paris and it's desirable women have a far more distinct rhythm and texture than I saw there as a 28 year old recently married man never being forced to slow down and observe it intensely, which is all this film does.  Be open minded and accept it's visual storytelling.",1361577600,2,494,4.395604395604396
8435325,3,B004LYVL9A,"In the small hotel room, somewhere in an unnamed city, an unnamed man (Xavier Lafitte) is seen writing something in his notebook. Then he goes out, walks to a caf, where he keeps watching people. You will know what he is watching or looking for, when he starts following a woman (Pilar Lpez de Ayala). But don't expect a Hitchcock-like mystery here. ""In the City of Sylvia"" is a kind of film which a small coterie of filmgoers will be attracted to. It is also a film that leaves others head scratching as to what it is all about.

Spanish/French film ""In the City of Sylvia"" is almost dialogue-free. It is not about story, though there is a small one that slowly unfolds. I don't know much about the director, but Jos Luis Guern is clearly interested in something else, like viewpoint and camera angle, or scenes themselves that are very beautiful. His camera frequently shows women, but their faces are often only partly revealed to us. The young man also records what he sees on pages, these women's fragmented images, which the camera shows to us, as if inviting viewers to share this young man's experience or memories.

Director's static camera reminds us of the works like Ozu and Kaurismki. Like them, Barcelona-born director Jos Luis Guern has a keen eye for details. Streetcars, caf, sunlight, even the smallest things like empty bottles left on the street corner make the sunny city (shot in Strasbourg) and its people look very real.

But Ozu and Kaurismki are also interested in people, or characters. The story may be simple in their films, but not abstract. Jos Luis Guern has pushed the envelope further, maybe, too further. What he thought unnecessary might have been essential to what he was after. Some may say, quite rightly, the film is atmospheric, creative, and where the film didn't explain, we can use our imagination. Others may say, it's arty and pretentious, so let's save our imagination for something else.

I happened to be among the latter party, so I only give the film three stars. The film's minimalistic approach is not my cup of tea. But you may feel differently. Either way the film is worth watching.",1284681600,4,2138,4.739247311827957
8435326,5,B004LYVL9A,"This film dispenses with traditional narrative and utilises a 3 day narrative structure: nights separate and punctuate the action of the days. We get variations on similar themes. The 1st day prefigures what's going to happen on the 2nd day,and the 3rd day is an evocation of the 2nd day. The film takes off from an investigation of women's faces as they mysteriously appear in photographs. Stories are based on what observation of people's faces suggest. The film-maker, Guerin, is observing and dreaming. Meaning comes from images and sounds. There are a series of motifs,including audio,which you hear each day,on different scales and at different distances, sometimes in vision,other times out of shot. These make the viewer aware of the structure of variations based on those same motifs,a musical approach. This replaces the idea of cinema as a psychological drama with the idea of echoes and symmetries in structure. Also, there is the use of gestures worked in as in a painting. The film is made for the viewer who will look and listen,reducing the anecdotal plot-line to a minimum, to prioritize the act of looking and listening.

The chief character is a young male artist,El(Xavier Latiffe), who comes to a foreign city,Strasbourg,which is medieval,timeless. He's on a quest,in the labyrinth of a woman,this city of Sylvia. He's like a `parfit knight' seeking a `shining lady',Ella. We need know nothing about him. He's a character who'looks and nothing more'.Defining himself slowly by what he looks at from shot to shot. As the dreamer,he's an icon upon which the viewer projects his own experiences,ideas. El is an active viewer,who dreams about what he sees,he is the Romantic hero from Romantic Art. He is a people-watcher with his sketch-pad at the caf,sketching outlines of heads,hair,faces, bodies seated at tables,eyes,the curves of mouths and knecks. Six years earlier he had met Sylvia at a bar. She is a ghost, a remembrance of things past, grown sweeter in the abstraction of memory. He attempts to recapture her essence and give form to the ideal by immersing himself in the special magic,the atmosphere of her city. The movement of the camera simulates his movements as he catches sight of the variety of gestures,faces, heads, in the middle of conversations,introspection,kissing,smiling,laughing,pensive. Dialogue is not heard,we don't need to know what they're saying,we understand. There is music of violins taking us into the world of the dreamer,outside space and time and reality,an illustration of the dreamer's gaze. The violinists modulate gestures,create a climate.

His vision narrows upon a young woman(Pilar Lopez de Ayala) whom he proceeds to follow around the city. We witness the city of bikes,pedestrians and trams in a flow of very harmonious movement which was easy, choreographically, to organise by Guerin. El,exists in a state of uncertainty,not reaching after fact:is she the one he is searching for?He half-heartedly calls `Sylvie',but she is distracted,walks on,moves away,disappears. This pursuit is driven by desire for the ungraspable ideal,so the camera moves behind the girl or in front,it turns corners,walks alongside her. The director creates the situation in which he's the hunter with the camera,waiting to capture the moment of revelation: he controls light,framing,performances,sets,all so as to be surprised by chance. El finally stands next to Ella on a moving tram and we get the first heard spoken dialogue, lasting for 10 minutes. He finds she is not Sylvia,but the dialogue is transformed as the tram moves,stops,pauses,starts,goes into shadow, light, set against the fluid passage of the city behind. We are like surprised viewers of each moment.

We see the use of documentary techniques in a fictional film. The documentary reality comes through sounds,voices, overheard dialogue,different languages,graffiti,people passing,shops,businesses,trams, bicycles,pigeons, weather .This film is about how all love stories begin with looking. What you see opens up lots of possible stories. The relationship created by a look is like a blank page,a white screen. Reflections and shadows,join gestures and expressions, in the bottomless well of images,illusions,recollections or memories. The dynamics of movement,expression,faces coming and going. New faces replacing others,the crossroads of possible destinies. This is cinema as magic in all its abundant recreation of moving reality and dream. This is no light-weight film but the real thing. As if to echo his quest,a graffitti refrain on many walls""Je t'aime Laura"" runs ahead of us. The artist's notepad is used as a moving image as the pages flick over, while he scrubs things out,draws or writes things down.",1272153600,6,4731,5.4165535956580735
