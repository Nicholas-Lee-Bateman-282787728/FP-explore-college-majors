8737503,4,B016X9KM7M,"Started off a little weak, I wasn't liking Coconut very much, but he earned his wings with his bravery in my, and my 7 & 8 year-old kid's, opinion. Very British (I think) accents and a little less glamourous than your typical Hollywood/Pixar type animation, but still very decent movie.

Also, I am very attuned to political messages in movies. I don't care if you are Red or Blue, Liberal or Conservative, Global Warming or Climate Change oriented, just don't shove it down my kid's throats. I don't want them having someone's agenda shoved down their naive little throats at a young age by anyone other than me and my wife.  This movie did not have any noticeable bias in my opinion. It was just a fun, coming of age story that my kids and I enjoyed on a Friday evening. I'd recommend it. I didn't give it five stars because I reserve that for movies like Avatar and Toy Story that REALLY stand head and shoulders above the rest. Four stars on a movie in my opinion is still 8/10 and a VERY high score.",1463443200,,1004,4.39247311827957
