Now I got another disc player, which can play PAL and NTSC, and all regionals. I really like that dvd and other releases from that artist.

8418761,4,B0048M18Y8,"1st off THANKS Sumner Erickson for helping to get Roky back to the masses! Great show & amazeing sound. Recorded live on Halloween night. Stand out tracks are ""Night Of The Vampire"", You're Gonna miss Me"", & Two Headed Dog. The Black Angels are a good back up band & seem to ""click"" with Roky. I just wish it had a few more songs, Roky has soooooo many classics! The cover art alone is worth the price of admission.",1373673600,2,415,4.265822784810126
8418762,4,B0048M18Y8,"Love Roky
Really like the Black Angels (he should've done his last album with them, NOT Okkervil River)
Didn't like that Roky just doesn't have the stuff it takes to do this music anymore and that the performance and recording wasn't great or greatly recorded.",1353974400,3,260,4.8
8418763,3,B0048M18Y8,"Ok this live footage of Roky from 2008 could have been so much better without all the creative effects and black n white images. when the full color appeared that was what i wanted to see! roky live in full color! why would anyone mess with this!?! why not release the whole concert as well? 37 minutes but it seems much longer because you get distracted by lame effects and edits of the concert. who cares about backstage banter??? the show sounded good but roky clearly cannot sing anymore or that night anyway. wish that there were more aliens songs than elevators. his backup band were good and the jug was annoying but wasn't it always? hopefully some other proper concert footage will be released for all to enjoy. roky deserves so much better. so unless you get this real cheap or for free, pass on it and by his music instead.",1346198400,2,834,4.493421052631579
8418764,5,B0048M18Y8,"First of all the Black Angels fit Roky's style to a tee. They were awesome for this and they weren't just a backing band they seemed to mesh with the classic sounds of Roky's material. I hope that in the not too distant future that they will release an album together. Roky seemed to be into the performance and really did an awesome job. Though time has come into the picture for Roky's voice he still has a way with the intensity of his performance and how he wants something to sound. Two Headed Dog blew me away on this disc. Well anyway Bloody Hammer would have also fit in very well for this occasion,but hey it is what it is and it's perfect. Raw, Creepy,Fuzzed Out,and a must own for any true fan! Tommy Hall would be proud of the Jug performance!",1297900800,3,755,4.286713286713287
8418765,5,B0048M18Y8,"This is a pro shot and well recorded 38 minute DVD of Roky Erickson with the Black Angels on Halloween 2008.  Roky's best band from his current comeback has got to be Cam King and The Explosives&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halloween-Live-1979-1981/dp/B0012X6FE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halloween (Live 1979-1981)</a>&nbsp;but the Black Angels are a solid band and really do a great job on the 13th Floor Elevators songs.  They even pull out the electric jug.  Some people will not like the fact that a bit of interview materiel is cut into the first song (Bo Diddly), or that the director used a lot of black and white effects shots in the live footage, or that the credits roll during the last song but it didn't take away from my enjoyment and I found it tasteful.  There are also some interview and backstage segments tossed in between songs but they are short.  Until they release the DVD of the ICELAND or Austin City Limits Roky Erickson shows with the Explosives this will have to do.  It is also too bad that the planned album with the Black Angels didn't happen and went to Okkervil River&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/True-Love-Cast-Out-All-Evil/dp/B0035YPYPO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">True Love Cast Out All Evil</a>.
