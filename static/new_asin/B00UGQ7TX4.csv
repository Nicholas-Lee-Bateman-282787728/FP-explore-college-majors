8706321,3,B00UGQ7TX4,"Fantastic cast, superb acting, spectacular cinematography. The story is mostly made up by Howard Fast sitting in a federal prison during the reign of the House Un American Activities Committee, though there was a Third Servile War in ancient Rome with some similarities. My problem? The movie is extremely violent - the PG-13 rating is bizarre and a model for what is wrong with the rating system. If Jean Simmons had once exposed her breasts, I'm sure the movie would have gotten an R. But evidently no level of violence qualifies - and no, I don't have any young children, but I was misled by the rating to expect the violence to be more muted. It was simply too much for me.",1528416000,,677,4.557377049180328

8706323,1,B00UGQ7TX4,"Do NOT buy this Blu-Ray. It doesn't work! When you try to play it...nothing happens. I tried EVERY possible thing and it failed. Sure, I can send it back wasting my time, gas and postage, but that just adds to the disappointment. Amazon is convenient, but they do not monitor quality control.
Oddly enough, there is some warning early on that it might not work; funny, that wasn't mentioned in the initial advertising. Unless you need another drink coaster, save your money and buy from somewhere else. I should have known when the price was too reasonable. You get what you pay for...at best.",1523059200,,593,4.711538461538462

8706329,5,B00UGQ7TX4,"This movie only happened because Kirk was ticked off that he didn't get the title role in Ben-Hur. It's amazing how some small slight of Hollywood history could spawn an absolute epic.
Spartacus is absolutely brilliant. Kirk is great, of course. But the supporting cast is magnificent. Laurence Olivier radiates this energy that dominates the screen. Charles Laughton steals every scene he's in as Gracchus, a scheming, world-weary, corrupt senator who is also devoted to the Republic. And of course Peter Ustinov, with his mix of comedy and cunning, is a joy to watch. They don't give Jean Simmons much to do, and I don't think this sausage fest of a movie could be made today without adding more women to the cast. But it is awesome.
The film won 4 Academy Awards, including best supporting actor for Ustinov. I'm left wondering why everyone was so ga-ga over Tony Curtis. He's the least of the major actors on the screen.
Now for some fun movie trivia:
Stanley Kubrick was not the first director of the movie! Director Anthony Mann filmed the opening scenes in the quarry, but then Douglas fired him after a week.
To create the illusion of the large crowds that play such an essential role in the film, Kubrick's crew recorded 76,000 spectators at a Michigan State-Notre Dame college football game shouting ""Hail, Crassus!"" and ""I'm Spartacus!""
It was a race to make the movie. Yul Brynner wanted to make his own Spartacus movie. It's only because blacklisted actor Dalton Trumbo was able to deliver a script in 4 weeks that Douglas won the race! I guess Douglas really was Ben-Hur!
This movie was a tremendous influence on films that came after it. From the use of cameras to direction to its effect on modern story telling. And how many times have you seen the line ""I am Spartacus"" parodied? Many, many times.
As I write this, the movie is selling on Amazon for $10 for the Blu-Ray. For that, you get a beautifully restored, very REWATCHABLE piece of cinematic history. Buy it!",1509667200,2,1983,4.734104046242774
