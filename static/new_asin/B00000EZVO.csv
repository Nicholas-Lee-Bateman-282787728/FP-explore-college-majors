7906159,5,B00000EZVO,This is a 3 video set that I think is great! They are 60 minutes each in color and B&W and recorded in SP. The first is JFK and retraces his days as leader of the nation. The second is The Beatles. This follows The Beatles from their early days in the Cavern Club to the tragedy outside of the Dakota. Great pictures and scenes from both private and public film collections. The third video is Hoover's FBI. Shows how J. Edgar Hoover transformed the agency.,1052265600,2,457,4.325581395348837
