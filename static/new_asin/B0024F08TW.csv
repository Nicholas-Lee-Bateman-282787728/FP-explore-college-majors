I am the webmaster of The Reba McEntire Network (Reba. Synthasite. Com) and I have created a video for the release of season 6. I am now editing this review, as I did post this a long time ago. Take a look at the video. It's kind of boring, but it's the best I could to on a computer that wasn't even mine. Anyways, about the DVD, I'm so glad that it is finally out on DVD! It's amazing. Just when we all thought that seasons five and six weren't going to be released, well, surprise. Here they are. The designers of the art work aren't doing as well as I had hoped. It would be a lot cooler if seasons 5 and 6 were released in box sets, and not just regular DVD cases. Also, they don't containa the episode lists at all. I had to go online, and print one out. I did that, and placed it in the case myself! Lol. That's the best I could think of! Another thing, I wish that these last seasons had some kind of special features like seasons 1-3 do. But, we can stay on the positive side, by just saying, ""Finally, the whole series of 'Reba' are now on DVD, and I can watch it whenever I want to!"". Just say that, and you will be good. I have the complete series of the show, and I'm so glad that I can watch 125 episodes in any order, at any time! I really hope all of you love the DVD! Promote this show to others who don't know it! I would definitely recommend this product to others! One thing you should know, Reba's hair is red. Do you know what red means? It means ""Promote me, I am ready for greatness."" Just a little thing that JoAnna Garcia says in 'Privileged'. Think that about Reba too! :) That's all for now. I'll see if I have anything to edit, or add to this review later on!",1240012800,9,2067,4.875

I have every Season of Reba and love them all. I bought them from Amazon.com and always got them at a good price. This is a funny family show that your whole family can watch together. Reba is a very good actress and so funny. She is the whole package. I always have a good experience with Amazon.com buying my DVDs. Good prices and shipping is prompt.

3845610,5,B0024F08TW,"This is a hilarious sitcom. The plot features Reba, a divorced mom with three kids, who has to put up with them, her son-in-law, ex-husband, and his new wife,  Barbara-Jean, the big blonde ditz. They get into all sorts of crazy situations, usually involving family fights, but sometimes wandering into the truly bizarre (they even managed a tasteful comedy about Hurricane Katrina). The dialogue is witty, the actors have perfect timing, and the plots are entertaining. Barbara-Jean, steals most of the shows, but all of the characters have their moments. If you want to laugh, I highly recommend renting this.",1278979200,,610,5.1

3845620,5,B0024F08TW,I was very excited to get the last season of Reba.  I have enjoyed this comedy for the past 6 years and I love the way it ended...brought to a natural conclusion of growing up (everyone including adults) and positive outlooks for the future.  A feel good show is a welcome relief in today's world of mindless television violence.  Thank you so much for the entertainment.,1253923200,,371,4.590909090909091
3845621,5,B0024F08TW,The last and final season of the Hart legacy. Reba is a class act and her show reflected that. It was a great show and would have continued had it not been for the merger of two networks that caught up in their egos rather than producing quality family TV.

Season 6 is great though i guess since they knew they were getting canceled they didn't hold back at all. Very disappointed about an edit that I noticed made on this dvd. When Barbara Jean and Kyra sing a spice girls song in Kyras bedroom was totally cut out. I don't know if that is the only edit or there are more since that is the only episode I caught on tv. I don't know if that was a music rights issue or if syndicated episodes were used on this dvd. But it is a great season I think the best one so i give it 5 stars the dvd i give a 1 cause of this edit nor does it mention this on the packing and no special features.,1245715200,4,710,3.8698630136986303
3845635,5,B0024F08TW,"These Episodes are SYNDICATED
The Average Time on most Episodes of any show is 24 to 25 Minutes

These are 20.

I understand that people have their Favorite TV Shows, but Why O Why would you Pay for something you could watch or Record on TV for FREE?

I bought Season 1 of Two and a Half Men and 1 of the Episodes was 18 1/2 Minutes. SYNDICATION at its Best. I'm guessing Seasons 2 - 5 will be no different.

ALL 4 seasons of ALF were SYNDICATED
Season 1 of Rosanne was SYNDICATED
Father of the Pride The Complete Series was Edited and SYNDICATED
WKRP had the Music Edited and Replaced because of Licensing.

To ALL of you DVD Companies

We the Serious Fans want The WHOLE Show. Not Mangled shows missing Critical scenes and music.

We the Fans don't want SYNDICATED shows.
We don't want the songs replaced.
We don't want anything censored for PC.
We want to see these shows the way we Originally saw them Broadcast.

We now have Theme Songs being Replaced.
The Original Theme Song ""Love And Marriage"" sung by Frank Sinatra was replaced by NASTY Elevator Music on the 3rd Season DVD and continued all the way to the Final season.

Proof that this Doesn't have to happen, MOONLIGHTING
After more than 2 years of Lobbying by Fans.... [...]....the first 2 seasons were realeased last May with ALL scenes and Music intact.
""I was unwilling to replace the Music"", said MOONLIGHTING creator and Executive Producer Glenn Gordon Caron, who now Produces Medium, ""I felt that was Integral to the show. That really Stymied its Video and DVD release for years"".

At one point, Anchore Bay Entertainment, one of the DVD distributors that held the Rights, Suggested cherry picking the episodes, Releasing only those that did not contain music.

""I said, That's Absurd, I have NO intrest in doing this, Caron said.

""If they can't promise that Every Scene and the Music is going to be a part of a DVD release, They're going to have alot of Pissed Off Fans.
Every Scene and at times The Music are both Critical to a TV Show"".

Only selected episodes from the show ""Ally McBeal"" have been released in The United States due to the High cost of Music Licensing.
BUT, In the United Kingdom, where different Licensing deals have been struck, viewers can order all 5 seasons of the show Complete and UnCut.
This proves 1 thing, America is CHEAP.
Way to go United Kingdom.

The 5 Stars above are for the UnCut episodes of this Great Show.

""Reba"" & thought ""Oh yeah...I'd heard she had a tv show"" but never caught it during it's original airing. And said ""What the heck,why not give it a shot?"" I have been hooked on this show ever since!! All the characters seem to blend together flawlessly & I never would have thought that such an established music artist would have such great comedic timing! A great series for the whole family!",1243641600,,550,4.622448979591836
3845638,5,B0024F08TW,"I was floored by how funny and charming this show is - a blend of ""I love Lucy"", ""Friends"", ""The Cosby Show"", and maybe a touch of ""Roseanne"" thrown in.

All of the characters really work as sympathetic and interesting people, starting with Reba. She is just perfect as the strong, somewhat harried mom trying to navigate all the unconventional changes life has thrown at her and her family.

By season 6, Cheyenne and Van have matured into more responsible adults, but are still flaky and endearing enough to deliver many of the show's laughs and satisfy fans who loved the innocent airheads of season 1.

The Brock and Barbara Jean story line was less satisfying to me -- I wish they hadn't experienced QUITE so much conflict in their marriage throughout so many seasons, but the implication by the end is that they will work it out and that they love each other, so that's good.

Barbara Jean and Reba are always delightful together.  And it is wonderful to have Kira back, as deadpan as ever, getting ready to go off into the world in her own way (despite Reba's efforts to control her).

Reba is my favorite part of this sitcom, I must admit.  She is pragmatic and funny and dispenses wisdom and sarcasm as needed.  If you have put off watching this show because it stars ""that country music singer"", I urge you to forget anything you've ever thought you knew about Reba McIntire and look at her work with fresh eyes.

She has excellent comedic timing and is so appealing in ""Reba"", and really pulls the whole show together with her contagious energy and enthusiasm. I hope at some point we are able to see her again in another sitcom.

Regarding appropriateness for children, well, I do let my kids watch it and they adore it, but the show may not be appropriate for all families, due to the adult situations it contains. The show contains frank and sometimes irreverant references to sex, teen pregnancy, mistresses, infidelity, skipping school, etc... And there is mild swearing too. Nevertheless, I think the show really emphasizes the most important family values -- loving and supporting each other, struggling to live with the consequences of your actions, and figuring out how to live a good, responsible life even when things don't go exactly like you planned. And it does all this in a hilarious way.

I hope Season 6 includes some extras like the Season 1 DVDs did, perhaps some more commentary from the actors or some more outtakes.  But regardless, A++++!",1242259200,19,2473,4.699074074074074

3845640,5,B0024F08TW,"Please release Season 6 in Full Screen!

Why on Earth did they cancel this show? I compare this show to the likes of Lucy! It should have been shown on the mainstream TV channels. Funny, entertaining and a joy to watch. It will bring laughter into your home. There are not many shows that our entire family can sit down and enjoy together. The writers of this series are phenomenal!

All characters blend together to make this one of the best comedies in TV history! I'm so tired of reality shows that have consumed the airways. I fear shows like Reba will disappear into the sunset, and our society needs the laughter shows like this produce. I have season 1-5 and I cannot get enough of them.

However, the rush to get Season 5 out, you can tell FOX did a poor job in doing. The packaging was not as nice as Season 1-4. Not the caliber of quality they put into the first four Seasons. But SO very thankful they released it!

Thrilled that Scarlett Pomers character (Kyra) returned for Season 6.

I'm so sad that there will only be 13 more episodes released in Season 6, yet I will enjoy this show forever! I plan on doubling up my set to make sure I am never without this show.
