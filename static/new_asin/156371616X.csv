186434,5,156371616X,An outstanding movie that offers relief for a grief-ridden  young child who just lost her Dad and is attempting to cope with her own injury to her left leg. Medicine has long known that animals put in close quarters with humans often heal up emotional wounds and this is especially true for horses. A movie based upon a True Story which is not difficult to believe whatsoever. The acting was superb with the exception of the scenes where the star loans her horse to another girl. Found the crying to be a bit much. While this movie was designed for very young children I found it to be very moving and in the class of feeling good type of movies. While the final outcome was completely predictable this movie is not a mystery or a type that needs to catch the audience by surprise. Rather it gives hope and right now we can use all of the movies with that theme that we can get.,1458950400,,878,4.321212121212121

186501,4,156371616X,"While this film teaches some good life lessons in taking personal responsibility for one's actions, I do have some nit-picking.

As a long-time horseman I find the preponderance of 'Hollywood's' portrayal of  equine movies to be quite annoying, i.e. the portrayal of mares with horses of the opposite sex; the so-called great, amazing, terrific, etc. trainer, rider, etc. portrayed by people who have obviously never been on a horse before or possessing questionable riding skills.

You can expect the plot to unfold as it does--or close to your outcome.  Only one mention of God in the dialogue, though.  I was hoping for more spiritual inspiration from this, but its unspoken.

It was beautiful to watch her ""talk"" (she is unable to speak in words) comfortably with the horses. I believe she gained from the movie the notion that horses are friendly and loveable...
This particular copy of the film I purchased for one of her pediatric nurses. We always bring our copy to hospital when she is in, and the nurse said she would love the chance to see it...so we gifted her at Thanksgiving. She was very excited to receive the film.",1356566400,,603,4.298245614035087

186533,1,156371616X,"I got this movie for my horse loving daughter after reading all these glowing reviews.  We suffered through the movie and had a good laugh over it afterwards.  I mean someone really made this movie and thought it was great????!!  The acting is 3rd rate, the dialogue is just strange and the whole story line is a bit bizarre.  My first idea that the movie wouldn't be great was when the mom was giving her daughter a little talk at dinner time.  Ok, here it is, not exactly:  Mom ""honey, remember the story I told you about the little girl who looked out her window and saw her brother burying the family pet, and she was crying?  Her father came up to her and took her to another window  and she saw a beautiful flower and she smiled. Her father told her she was just looking out the wrong window"". (HUH?)  The little girl then says, ""But dad is dead"".  And her father was dead, and what the heck kind of parable/story is that to tell a kid. It has become a running joke in our house, whenever my kid gets upset over something, I tell her to look out another window.

And the little girl actress/whiny girl named Sonny, couldn't they have given her crutches that actually fit her and teach her how to use them??  I think not, it was like this girl dragged her crutch around everywhere, bending her hurt leg like nothing was wrong with it.  Helloooo!
In no time at all does this girl befriend a dangerous horse and fall in love with it.  And she is able to buy it for $4. Hellooo, let's get real.  I know I am getting annoying with this review, but this movie was annoying.  The mother/doctor relationship is freakish, I didn't get it. One minute she is a mom at her daughters doctor office, the next minute they are eating out, and before you know it, he is proposing. What the heck?

And as others have said, why is the horse Ginger called 'she' throughout the movie, when it is plain as day that the horse is a male????  We can see its genitalia throughout the movie and most of us are not stupid.  Was there really not another ginger colored horse that was a female available for this part?  And this wonder girl, Sonny, she must be amazing to barrel race and win on a horse within a month of learning to ride.  Fantastic and so realistic. NOT.  Don't get me started on the mean girl who also barrel raced and her mom.  Bizarre characters indeed. Cheesy stuff.

This movie should really be a spoof of a real movie.  It has provided my kids and I with many jokes and laughs.",1326844800,5,2477,4.286637931034483

186538,5,156371616X,"Though there was initial tragedy, the young lady was blessed with a positive opportunity in what she loved...horses. Not just any horse, but one that was her pal.

The response to life is what we grow from and this movie shows positive responses and growth from it though at times challenging.

I have grown by doing positive tasks every day to eventually mature and consider others' benefits and raising their joy in life if I can. This movie is watched often so I can confirm that there are positives in negative situations...second chances again and again, despite one's prior errors.

We become from what we need to grow through; we never become better from an average, safe life. A better life involves some risk and learning from and never giving up just like the character Sunny Matthews!

A person not interested in becoming smarter about life won't get much out of this. But if they are stretching themselves daily or when they need encouragement even in the struggles in their life, this movie is a channel.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Power-of-Self-Coaching-The-Five-Essential-Steps-to-Creating-the-Life-You-Want/dp/0471463604/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Power of Self-Coaching: The Five Essential Steps to Creating the Life You Want</a>",1310774400,3,1296,5.734375

I put it on for my grandson and I was glued to it from the beginning.  This movie is based on a true story. Like most horse movies I expected it to be an adorable movie that would make me teary and wish I had a horse again. The movie ends with a complete surprise, the little girl has a very forgiving heart and what she does in the end was above what most would have done. I was speechless (and a bit teary) This is a movie I will watch again and again, and even purchase for the daycare and for gifts. A little girl and a few adults that see a true forgiveness and sacrifice.  Do not hesitate, just buy this wonderful movie.",1307232000,,754,4.046979865771812

186552,5,156371616X,"My daughters (Ages 10, 8, and 4) and I caught this movie on the local Trinity Newtork last night.  We were all glued to the set to watch this heartfelt movie.  I was pleased with the story line and actors.  I was quite taken by the deep sense of compassion and forgiveness that the main little girl character, Sonny, portrayed in the end towards another little girl.  As a horse owner, I did catch the fact that the writers used a male horse at times to portray the female horse ""Ginger"" in the script - however, my daughters did not catch this until I pointed it out to them.  As well as they used an Arabian at one point in time to show ""Ginger's"" fancy movement, when in fact the horse Ginger was ""said"" to be a Quarter Horse breed.  (Again, most people would not pick up on this and neither did my girls) Also, having over 30 years of horse experience including barrel racing, I know that it is highly unlikely that a little girl could jump on a powerful horse the first time and ride fast barrels like was shown in the movie... But this did not at all affect my daughters as they watched since kids of course are natural dreamers to a point of being unrealistic (which is a good thing).  I highly recommend this movie if you're interested in wholesome story line.  Note: there was a couple of times the word ""dang it"" was used in the beginning. There is also one scene in the beginning where Ben, the main adult character (cowboy at the ranch) strongly shakes the little girl Sonny, when she has gone into a presumed-dangerous horses pen without permission.  It should be noted that this movie shows how Sonny chooses to disobey at least 3 times, and thus, suffers the consequences of doing so.  As a parent, I liked how the movie shows kids that there ARE serious consequences to their disobedience. Excellent movie that I will get a copy of.",1164067200,34,1848,4.408823529411765

Although no care whatsoever was taken with the continuity of the horses who portrayed ""Ginger"" this uplifting kid flick is entertaining enough.

Terry Moore is cast as Dallas Judd, grandmother of Melinda Judd (Madeline Zima) and purportly former love-interest of Ben Taylor (Tom Amandes).
