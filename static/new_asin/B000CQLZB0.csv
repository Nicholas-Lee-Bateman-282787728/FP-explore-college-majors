8100432,3,B000CQLZB0,Movie was suspenseful and had comedic elements but was nothing exceptional. Supposdly a true story but find that hard believe in some of the situations protrayed. Definetly worth a rent or if its five or six bucks. Not a movie that will stick with you five years from know.,1242777600,,273,4.591836734693878
8100433,4,B000CQLZB0,"(3.5/5 stars)  Jaime (Ernesto Alterio) and Tomas (Jordi Molla) are left-wing university activists in Spain during Franco's rule. They expect an eight-month sentence for writing some nonsense about ""freedom"" and ""liberty"" on the walls of school property, yet General Marquino (Juan Echanove) talks the president into an eight-year sentence instead. With the help of fellow revolutionaries in Barcelona and Paris, the two hatch a plan to escape to freedom- and liberty-loving France. What ensues more resembles a romantic comedy than a dramatic adventure, though this is not to the film's detriment. Armed with false documents and a flashy red convertible, two young North American women meet Jaime and Tomas in order to escort them across the country. Both men have the hots for Susan (Allison Smith), an aspiring U.S. actress with a free spirit. Both ignore Canadian Kathy (Hedy Burress), at least until Jaime sees her naked. (If you ask me, both are rather fetching) The real scene stealer, however, is Jose Maria Pou as Carlitos Roa, the flamboyant ""reporter to the stars."" He is hilarious as he dotes on Jaime and tries to impress him with his celebrity connections. If you enjoy road movies, especially those in the Hope/Crosby vein, give this film a look. It is primarily in Spanish and French, with English subtitles, though some of it is in English as well. This is also worth watching if you are interested in seeing Allison Smith and Hedy Burress (and I do mean ALL of Allison Smith and Hedy Burress). The film has not been rated by the MPAA, though it is the equivalent of an ""R"" rating due to the aforementioned nudity and the occasional swear word.",1173916800,5,1660,4.928571428571429
